Warriors should trade Steph for lamelo ball and trade oubre for lonzo and fire Kerr and hire lavar
"He was a bad shooter who had an uncharacteristically good year when surrounded by a great team. Shooting statistics are very noisy, and seasons like that happen even to bad shooters. Just look at Lonzo Ball last season compared to every other season"
"its so annoying, both him and LonZo has the nickname name of 2 HOFers.   fuck Lavar Ball.. end ofc the one named Gelo cant play.."
"Lonzo doesn‚Äôt shoot going right, never looks to finish on a drive, and has no floater as of today.  To make things worse, his handle is currently below average for a lead ball handler.  He‚Äôs got really good defensive instincts, natural feel for passing, and has shown that he can be a decent spot up shooter.  Sad to see he hasn‚Äôt improved all that much. He always came off as humble and a good teammate. Someone you can easily root for."
Yes Ben Simmons is not capable of leading a team to a championship while being the pg of the offense that is what I mean. Ben is leagues ahead of lonzo cause of his size and he has better handles and better vision. But nonetheless the point still stands he cannot be the lead ball handler on a championship team cause he has the same issue as lonzo in the halfcourt just not to the degree lonzo has it. I never said Ben isn‚Äôt a good passer you put words in my mouth.
"You saying he isn‚Äôt  a good passer because he has no handles is pretty laughable ngl. You don‚Äôt have to have elite ball handling skills to make plays and be a good passer. If you can consistently get the ball to the right man and set them up to score you are a good passer, which Lonzo does.."
"&gt;Lonzo Ball, New Orleans ‚Äî $24,912,371  &gt;Surprised? Ball rates as a pretty valuable player by most advanced metrics, is still quite young, and last season showed marked improvement in one of his biggest weaknesses (long-range shooting). He may never be one of the two best players on an elite team, which argues against a max deal for him, but paying him like a high-end starter through his mid-20s doesn‚Äôt seem that crazy, does it?  &gt;In reality, I don‚Äôt see Ball getting quite to this number, but it‚Äôs good information from New Orleans‚Äô perspective. If the Pelicans can get him for four years at $20 million a pop or so, they likely will win on that contract by a pretty decent margin.  This is from John Hollinger."
"&gt;ESPN‚Äôs Bobby Marks took a look at the extensions that were and weren‚Äôt handed out on Monday and offered some analysis on Ball‚Äôs situation. Marks cited a pair of recent contracts as barometers for Ball heading into contract negotiations.  &gt;‚ÄúIf Ball stays healthy and plays at a high level this season, a new contract should start in the $16-18 million range next offseason, similar to the Hornets‚Äô Terry Rozier and Spurs‚Äô Dejounte Murray (keep in mind that the $16.8 million salary this season of teammate Eric Bledsoe ranks No. 22 among all point guards). The high end for Ball would be the four-year, $80 million contract that Malcolm Brogdon signed with the Indiana Pacers in 2019.‚Äù  This was written back in November before Giannis resigned with the bucks. A lot of teams were preserving cap space for next summer and now whats left?   Its obvious that a lot of you let your emotion cloud your judgement with contracts. Your opinion on lonzo are irrelevant, if he rediscovers his 3 ball then he will be highly sought after next summer. Someone is going to pay him big money."
Really. It's too early to say that Lonzo Ball is not a max player?
This just made me realise how nauseating the coverage will be if or rather when Bronny and Zaire make it to the NBA. I hope they do well but it's very unenjoyable to see young kids struggle under the spotlight that they don't deserve. This will be like Lonzo Ball but x100. I fear they will disappoint even though I don't have a clue about their abilities atm or where they rank amongst their peers.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high basketball IQ to understand Lonzo Ball‚Äôs game. His skill set is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the fundamentals most of what he does for a team will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Lonzo‚Äôs father‚Äôs patriarchal outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Greek literature, for instance. The real fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of Lonzo‚Äôs passing, to realise that it‚Äôs  not just him giving up the ball- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Lonzo Ball truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the truth in Lavar‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúAll three of my sons are going to be one-and-done.‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Lonzo‚Äôs passing and genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them.üòÇ  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Big Baller Brand tattoo.üÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏è And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 basketball IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personal kidsüòé"
Hard to play well with this team that can't space the floor. Remember Lebron when his PG was Lonzo Ball? That's the kind of spacing Luka has to deal with.
Fox loves to dominate Lonzo Ball
"Lonzo isn‚Äôt a point guard. He‚Äôs a very good defensive 6‚Äô6‚Äù wing.  He‚Äôs a good passer and can maybe hit spot up 3s, but he‚Äôs not a PG. he‚Äôs great with the ball in transition, but not in the half court.    Also, to be clear Lonzo sucks.  I just want Terry."
"Man if only we had good individual defenders like Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, or that Josh Hart! Maybe we could add in a great help defender like Steven Adams!  Then you know what we could do? Give them more than 18 games to judge whether or not its gonna work."
Not for Lonzo Ball lol
The disrespect to Lonzo Ball is real. He's steph with a 40 inch vertical
"He doesn't need to run the offense, he just needs to be a part of it.  What I said doesn't mean I'm saying Lonzo is good, I'm simply saying he's a better decisionmaker with the ball than Oubre is."
"Some players just don't play well in certain systems. Could be one of those things with Oubre. A couple months ago, we'd have been very disappointed if all Phoenix got from an Oubre trade was Lonzo Ball. He's a far better player."
"Lonzo is a ball handler in the sense that he can bring the ball up the court and make some decent dimes in transition. He has almost no half court game at all though. He can‚Äôt shoot, run P&amp;R, attack the rim, get to the line, etc. his passing can only be so helpful when he can‚Äôt attack to take advantage of it"
Is Windhorst just acknowledging a [week-old rumor](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/why-lonzo-ball-would-be-good-warriors-fit-kelly-oubre-pelicans-trade)?
"rpm says cj is the 2nd most impactful and and lonzo ball is the 14th most impactful and patty mills is the 15th most impactful. If you understood why the numbers are what they are for conley, which is the fact that he shares nearly all of his minutes with gobert, you'd understand why his RAPTOR is so inflated.  poetl also has played so few minutes, pointless to even care about what raptor says about him."
"Especially considering Lonzo Ball has gone back to being shit to begin the season, 32% from 3 on 7.5 attempts is a bit of yikes after taking a step in right direction last season (37.5% on 6.3 attempts)"
"&gt; No, I actually did not put any argument into his mouth  So show me where he said or implied "" averaging more assist makes you a better playmaker"" and ""Lonzo ball runs a better offense than Shaq""  I am more than happy waiting.  &gt;Giannis does try to play like Shaq.  False and the dude you blocked proved that.  &gt;I also never argued that, so you‚Äôre now straight up lying.  You literally said ""Giannis tries to play almost identical to Shaq."" Those are your words.  &gt;Enjoy your block.  Let me guess, 14 years old or younger, correct? Because the only kind of person this moody and petulant is under 15. You lost and you're incapable of accepting it."
"So averaging more assist makes you a better playmaker? Great, Lonzo ball runs a better offense than Shaq. Pay no attention to offensive systems at all. Pathetic, enjoy your block."
Lonzo Ball had a stretch of like 10 games where he led the league in 3pt percentage like 2 seasons ago. Keep dreaming Westbrick fantards.
"I just want to say that I *always* hated the Lakers. I gave them one night of rooting for them in Kobe's last game (bonus points that it was against the Jazz), but other than that I couldn't stand them hyping up Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma as the next big things. I also thought Brandon Ingram would bust (his poor free throw shooting did not inspire confidence in the KD comparison), so I'll take the ""L"" on that."
Prime Lonzo Ball*
Isnt Lonzo worthless as a ball handler in the half court?
"I don't give a shit about Lonzo Ball man I don't have a horse in this race, but I made a thread to get more opinions cause I really don't see how Graham is more impactful to winning  I've watched multiple Hornets games because of LaMelo Ball and I don't have a reason to be bias either way. Graham simply is not a good player"
"Graham is a better half court operator.  Lonzo a better flashy and open floor passer.   Graham has a 4.42 AST:TO ratio, Ball with 1.92   They're different types of passers"
"Just wrong, absolutely wrong yet again you moron. Literally just admit you don't know anything about the Hornets, it's okay   Your ""man"" Lonzo is a fucking bum. Get it through your head. He is a fantastic open court passer, useless in the half court. Great length and defender too. That's it   Graham is undersized, but he ain't JJ reddick levels useless. His off-ball D is just fine for what we're trying to achieve, which is a play-in. Just because a player is undersized doesn't mean they're a bad defender. His three point shot is back up and running after a poor start to the season. That's all that matter with him. His playmaking in the half court, his clutchness, and his threes.   Your man Lonzo is all of the following    - Useless in the halfcourt   - Defenses don't respect his outside shot   - Is scared to take contact (2.8 FTA for Graham to .8 for Lonzo)   - Doesn't even attempt mid-range to keep defenses honest   - 58% from the line    ----   The only way I would even consider it is if we're getting of Rozier"
"Graham is not that good and should lose his starting spot at any minute. 30/30 teams take Lonzo Ball, Lonzo has a TS of 50 while Graham is at 47.  You can take literally any advanced stat and they all give Lonzo Ball the edge. You can accuse me of not watching games (which I do cause of LaMelo) but there‚Äôs no way every single advanced stat is wrong.  I don‚Äôt give a shit about either, Lonzo Ball is unquestionably a better player then Devontae Graham"
Your man is shooting 33 percent from the field and is a total disaster on defense. Lonzo Ball a great defender  and a more impactful player then Graham. There is no reason for anyone to logically want Graham.  Lonzo Ball is literally more efficient then Graham which theoretically should be the only advantage Graham has on Ball.
"I said a lot of terrible things about Lonzo several years ago when he was on the lakers, but I'd totally be down to have him in Celtics green. He'd upgrade our guard defense, and provide a ton of court vision. He obviously needs to seriously work on his shot, because it's bad. It would definitely be tough to run him and smart on the court at the same time, offensively, but our defense would be legit with a ball, smart, brown, tatum, theis/thompson court. We probably wouldn't have to give up too much for him. He's probably worth whatever our crappy first will be."
"It was insane. I remember commenting on here back before Lonzo got drafted, I basically asked:  &gt;""If you guys think Lavar Ball is such a monster and a shitty dad, why are you rooting against Lonzo? If anything, shouldn't you be rooting for the kid who had to deal with all that shit?""  No one had a reasonable answer, the one guy who really tried to argue it said that he wants Lonzo to fail to bring down Lavar's ego. Actively rooting for a kid to fail at his career, just to bring his dad down a peg.   Like I hate Donald Trump with a passion (and with much better reason than anyone could ever have to hate Lavar Ball), but I can't imagine hoping that Barron fails in life just because it might embarrass his dad."
"Need a point guard that doesn't need the ball, tough on defense and can make shots. Perfect point guard for NO would be Marcus Smart. I'm not suggesting a trade for him, but that's the mold of pg I hope NO eventually ends up with.   Ingram and Zion are the playmakers for now. This team needs to build around those or they need to clean house.   In fact, what would someone say is the more important spot to find a better fit? Lonzo or Bledsoe?"
"[Article](https://theathletic.com/news/pelicans-jj-redick-trade-76ers-nets-celtics/mIuEEEjnKXQu) &gt;Redick, whose family resides in Brooklyn, is believed to have a strong preference to return to the northeast area. No deal is imminent yet, sources said.  &gt;Redick, 34, is averaging 7.9 points this season. He has been a ""Did Not Play-Coach‚Äôs Decision"" in the Pelicans‚Äô past two games. New Orleans has two young, promising guards in Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis who are on the precipice of rotation spots in the crowded backcourt.  &gt;The Athletic reported on Tuesday that teams were placing calls on Redick and Lonzo Ball, and that the Pelicans have shown openness to discussing both in potential packages.  &gt;The NBA has two upcoming dates relating to the March 25 trade deadline:  &gt;Feb. 2: The last day a player can be traded and still be aggregated in a multi-player transaction at the March 25 trade deadline.  &gt;Feb. 6: Most players who signed free-agent contracts in the offseason can begin to be traded."
Can I offer you a Lonzo Ball?
9/6/6. The lonzo ball triple single.

"I've been very negative about Kemba since the playoff in the bubble. He can't defend so he's the type of player that needs to outscore/outimpact his defensive liabilities.  In charlotte most of his scoring came from pick n roll instant 3 jumper(often contested or with the defender on his tail) or the typical small pg that weaves in for the lay up. In a team with 2 allstar already(3 last year with gordon), a contested jumper is never a good shot. Weirdly, that shot that he so often made and made him a fan favorite in charlotte never seemed to hit for us. Mostly, it's a bad shot selection when you have JT, gordon and JB on your team. He stopped doing that thankfully but his layups are often missing on his drives, etc. He's not the player he once was with charlotte and yes it might be a case of him needing the ball to get hot.  Either way, I think that he's not suited to play on this team when we have JT and JB above him especially since he's horrible on the defensive end. The worst part is I was wishing to get haliburton on that last draft and trade kemba but sadly he didn't drop all the way to us(picked 2 pick before ours) and we didn't make a move to get him. I think we need a tall pg that can penetrate with a good drive and dish the ball out to the jays while being able to defend.  All memes aside, a guy like lonzo would be perfect for us with the jays. I just can't stand his father but oh well.  Maybe I'm just hating on Kemba like I've been told several time in the celtics sub(only opinion that really goes against the mass). I think because he's such a nice guy and great team leader, some of our fanbase puts aside his lack of performance and possible fit when it comes to the game itself."
Lonzo Ball is a confusing fucking player
Yessir he‚Äôs showing it stats wise and in game even if it again his own brother I KNOW y‚Äôall saw that step back 3 on LonzoüòÇBALL IN THE FAMILY-is gone be lit
lamelo ball is what i wanted lonzo ball to be
Get blown out by the pelicans yesterday.  Lonzo has a career night from 3.  Lose to the hornets today.  Melo drops a career/season high.  Ball bros hate the bucks confirmed.
"I don't think it sustainable, because as great of a player he is. Jokic is a better passer than he is and is having an MVP season. Rudy is playing elite defense and is averaging around 13 pts, not great but it is a good value stat. Davis is a player who is by far the greatest vertical spacer and finisher in NBA History. (I say this because you have seen a player have no weakness in his play, he is an elite defender, an above-average shooter from mid and three, and his ball skills make it difficult for bigs to defend him in the paint). His only problem is that he isn't enforcing his will on the court. There are games where he will go off for 30 plus, but games where he will just have 18 pts. For him, he has to average at least 7 pts per game. Get to the paint if your shot isn't going in. You are impossible to stop.   &amp;#x200B;  Zion is playing great, but a lot of an all-star hype around a player is based on both how well your stats are and how the team is doing. The team is struggling with Steven Adams &amp; Bledsoe. They have to trade both of those guys. They provide no support for Zion. And they are going to trade Lonzo which will hurt because i think the pick and roll between those two is elite. Lonzo has great vision, and Zion has elite vertical finishing.   The biggest problem is, if they make it to the playoff, you are going against teams that are gonna make him shoot three similar to Giannis, I am wondering if he can do that at a high level. We have yet to see that from him. His weight as well."
Lonzo Ball not even close
"Lonzo easily.  Huge lack of a ball-handler on this team outside of Steph. Kerr's system is more geared towards smarter players. Also, he would be an RFA instead of a UFA which gives us more trade possibilities next year, provided we re-sign him."
I'd definitely want Lonzo. Adding a second player to the roster that would be looking to pass the ball to Steph would be a good add.
"I think Lonzo would fit well in the Warriors fast paced system, and he‚Äôs good at keeping the ball moving. His shot has been not been falling but that‚Äôs the case with Kelly anyway.   Lonzo also provides playmaking while Curry is off the floor, or can play the 2 with him. He‚Äôd provide more value than Oubre right now IMO."
"Doncic TS for this season is 56.2% and Westbrook TS is 46.1%. In fact Lonzo Ball has a higher TS than Westbrook this eason. Also 33% from 3pt isn't just ""barely below league average"". The league average for this season from 3pt is 36.5%."
If we don't like Markkanen enough to re-sign him why the hell would we re-sign lonzo ball lol
"Toughest part about this is the Derrick Rose era shouldn‚Äôt have even been his prime. Dude was young a.f and as we see in the comment section on any Lonzo ball post, point guards take forever to develop. D-Rose could‚Äôve been the goat with better luck and better injury prevention."

SHARES IN BIG BALLER BRAND **$BBB** SKYROCKET IN VALUE AS LONZO BALL EXECUTES ‚ÄúSHORT SQUEEZE‚Äù AGAINST HIS HATERS
"Lonzo ""LaMelo Ball"" Ball"
THE LONZO BALL ERA HAS BEGUN
"Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball, and a couple boxes of rice"
"Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball, and JJ. Reddick traded to the Pelicans."
"People might actually have to guard Lonzo Ball now and adjust game plans to him  üò¢üò≠  That's beautiful, man."
Okay. It‚Äôs going to be that kind of ball game for Lonzo. I do want him to succeed. Preferably with NOP. But I don‚Äôt want to sugarcoat the shortcomings of Ball or really any other Pelicans‚Äô player.
"Lonzo started off as Magic lite, then he was Steph with a 40 inch vertical, and now he's becoming Draymond Green without the ball kicking."
They have a much better situation for Zion than they did AD. Jrue wasn't as generous with giving AD the ball in the post as Lonzo is with Zion
"Ive got 7 pages to go of players, but heres how divisions are shaking out:       \*\*The Kitchen\*\*  Dwayne Bacon  Jordan Bone  Quinn Cook  Seth/Steph Curry       \*\*dopplenamers\*\*  LaMelo/Lonzo Ball  Jordan Bell  Rudy Gay  Kyle Guy       \*\*Scenic\*\*  Mikal/Miles Bridges  Dillon Brooks  Trent Forrest  Dearon Fox            \*\*Festive\*\*  Aaron/Jrue/Justin Holiday  Darius Garland"
"Marvin Bagley - this year makes $9m, then $11m then $14m QO, then RFA.  Is still only 21 and has a lot of potential as a big who will at least threaten some 3pters. Kings and him seem to be a bit at odds (at least his dad). He could still net some good assets that could pair with Fox/Haliburton/Holmes and they have Whiteside who could play filler mins at C.       Lonzo Ball - pretty versatile, but not very necessary to the team. $11m, $14m then RFA."
Lonzo Ball   lololololololololololololo
"Guys like Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball will have plenty of suitors -- versatile young guys that have size and upside. They're nowhere near the level of guys like Beal or Harden, but plenty of teams would take a flier on them."
"The 2 guys I had in mind immediately  stopped playing after 2019, they are 32 and 30 years old respectively and had great talent with some legendary showings. I'm talking about Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson. Both are still NBA calibre players easily imo in terms of skill but their character is just too tough to deal with along with questionable work ethic. Especially Beasley at times looked like the greatest player in the NBA when he decided to go all out and have a good day at the same time.  Currently in the league I'd say Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins. Andrew Wiggins showed many Superstar-level performances at this point of his career but those games are far inbetween. Lonzo imo shows great athleticism, defense and amazing passing ability as well as general BBIQ. When he goes hard on a drive he's showing glimpses of great finishing qualities and his physique is primed to bully small guard on both ends. His mentality holds him back though. Kind of low-hanging fruit to add to this would be Markelle Fultz lol   Some lower tier ones may be Kristaps and Lauri Makkanen, they look like Dirk on good games but injuries or mental troubles kept them away from having a breakout season into All-Star level (Lauri) or Superstardom (Kristaps). I'll also add Gallinari to the mix as he's an ultra skilled guy but always suffered bad injuries when he finally looked like he figured the NBA out. And a guy that was a Superstar but still never quite reached his peak would be Blake Griffin. Injuries once again held him back from having his best season. If some things went different he'd have a good chance to be a top 10 player, Blake could do it all and had great work ethic."
"Lonzo ball - but even when he was at LSU I thought he didn't have that killer mentality, his teammates quit on him in ncca tourney because he's just not a star that can motivate and elevate those around him.  The lakers should have passed on him and I think they would have if magic Johnson wasn't in control at the time."
"No, it‚Äôs the hate of the ball fans that outlandishly hype them up.  Lonzo is a great passer and defender.  He might be better than oubre, but the warriors really just need an ok passer, but a good scorer and defender.  We already have draymond and oubre has shown we can‚Äôt have two skunks on offense.  Draymond n lonzo just going to pass the ball back in forth until steph maybe gets through the triple team? The trades I‚Äôve seen were giving up more than just oubre too, which takes away our depth.  So it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it."
Your warriors team is full of low Basket ball IQ players like Oubre and Wannamaker while the team is set up for motion movement.  Terrible fit of players for a system that needs a lot of ''smart'' Bball players. Not sure why many warrior fans are against Lonzo he would be a good fit.
Lonzo Ball and it‚Äôs not close at all
Lonzo Ball
Yeah but I really don't care about Lonzo Ball.
please dont put lonzo ball and ben simmons in the same sentence
Brad's offense is very heavy PNR focused and Lonzo is about as bad of a PNR ball handler as there is at the PG position. It would be a terrible fit. Not to mention Kemba is just outright the best player in this deal.
"&gt;he won't control the ball with kyrie and harden and durant so he has to play off ball.  That's precisely what you want...  He's a great fit as an off ball passing/movement variable.  &gt;he can't shoot so his man will double one of the other guys each time  Yer applying his current form to the situation, and also joe harris has this covered fine.  The whole point is in another context, with different system, his form would improve.  Plus yer completely disregarding nash's pacing.  It's not that you have lonzo to catch and shoot, it's that you have him to play defense, board, get out and run, and make great passes, decisions, getting the ball moving early and often.    All of that shit settles between harden, kd, kyrie, and harris very, very nicely."
"I would get fired after 3 games max.   ‚ÄúCoach, they are packing the paint. We‚Äôve tried lobs to Zion the last 37 plays. It‚Äôs not working!‚Äù   ‚ÄúOk guys, I hear you. Let‚Äôs try this. Steven, you‚Äôre going to come here and set a screen. Zion, I need to you to come around this and cut to the basket (draws arrow to basket). Lonzo, make yourself useful and throw the ball to Zion. Let‚Äôs go guys I believe in you!‚Äù"
#CAN LONZO BALL DO THAT? I DON'T THINK SO
"Dude I was literally thinking about this today! I got wicked excited hearing that the Celtics and the Spurs had their normal jerseys and realized...holy hell I'm not happy about their normal jerseys I'm glad they're not clowns and putting up 80 different jerseys to sell to make money.  There's a reason the old jerseys have a rep that can't be reflected today, like a KD supersonics or a tampa bay devil Rays or a Montreal expos....this shouldn't be a fashion show corporate scheme.  You telling me right now you would get a whacky Brandon Jennings or Lonzo Ball jersey? ....good luck dude"
Lonzo Ball
"So Murray shit talked and punked Lonzo his rookie year and I was like ok this guy is a douche. Then he BALLED OUT last year in the playoffs and I was like oh OK, this guy can ball and is tight. Now this....hmm you know he might just be a douche"
As I have said repeatedly: Lonzo Ball is the best player on the Pelicans
"Free beal. We will take him for Burks,Noel and 2 1sts.   I Dont think theres a better offer than that unless you want the 6'10 lonzo ball from philly."

"The problem is the roster is full of REALLY poor fits. No one respects Zion's shot yet. So far Lonzo has proved last season was a mirage, and due to Ingram's growth they've taken the ball out of his hands which takes away his best skill - but they dont really have choice given Ingram's improvement. Adams is a non-shooter. People don't guard Bledsoe at the 3 point line. That leaves them with... who, exactly, that can shoot? JJ Redick and Ingram? Nickeil Alexander-Walker doesnt get enough PT to count so... yeah. Seems like the starting lineup needs a shakeup at a minimum. But even if Stan does that, not sure it'll matter. Oh and while Adams, Bled and Lonzo are stout defenders a\] that doesnt much matter if you can't get a bucket and there's no spacing on offense, and b\], Zion has been a HUGE disappointment on defense after being very good on that end at Duke. So far. There's plenty of time for that to change of course. But even so... it's just a really flawed roster with lots of flawed young players. They were never going to be any good."
"Bledsoe and Lonzo backcourt is horrible.   Zion flashes dominance but they don‚Äôt let him do what made him so fun at Duke. Play make and get the ball in the open court. You can see a little of it but he mainly gets 15 ft extended post touches.  Everyone is just hating on him because of the hype but he‚Äôs a victim of a bad situation.   Ingram‚Äôs game looks really good but he doesn‚Äôt play D that well and most of his shots are high degree of difficulty. He would be phenomenal in an offense that spaced out a little more. He sucked tonight tho I watched most of the Pels-Wolves game.   Adams is a horrible fit.   Bench is horrible, Reddick looks washed. Hayes is nothing special, NAW has moments both ways and no one else is noteworthy."
"With the wolves, I wouldn't have been surprised if lonzo ball turned into t-Mac and scored 13 in that time"
"I mean yeah their roster isn't amazing but you'd expect more out of team with a COTY, an MVP candidate in Steph, a solid 3&amp;D wing(at least recently) in Wiggins, a second #1 pick in Wiseman, plus Draymond who is still valuable defensively. Like we've seen worse teams do a lot better than play .500 ball. I mean for fucks sake Lebron somehow went 20-14 before he got injured playing with Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and the useless Luke Walton. Or when Russ willed his Thunder into the playoffs in 2016  This is nothing against Steph and Kerr, but for years everyone's always said Kerr was probably one of the best coaches in the NBA and Steph was one of the best players in the league. Yet there's always so many excuses. playoffs."
You really made an account just to pretend that you‚Äôre Lonzo Ball?
Lonzo Ball in a Rockets jersey just looks right.  Doubt we will get a deal done tho with Wall here
"They desperately need bench help, their bench is maybe the worst in the league. You have star power in Zion and BI, you just need to surround them with good 3 and D guys who don‚Äôt need the ball. Keeping Lonzo makes sense, because he‚Äôs almost the perfect version of that when he‚Äôs playing well, but paying him $20m-$25m a year would be an overpay if he returns to his early-season form.   Lonzo‚Äôs in a weird spot contract wise, because even at his best he‚Äôs not quite a star on the level of Fox, SGA, or Ja, but he‚Äôs still an extremely valuable player. He‚Äôs worth more than a role player but less than a superstar."
"The Golden State Warriors reportedly have interest in a trade for Victor Oladipo, according to Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer.  O'Connor noted this shows the team's plans to add another ball-handler in the mold of Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston, who each played key roles during the team's three NBA titles.  Oladipo has appeared in 15 games with the Houston Rockets since coming over in a January trade from the Indiana Pacers, averaging 19.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.7 assists with his new team.  The 28-year-old is set to become a free agent in the offseason.  Several big names have already changed teams this season, including James Harden heading to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a blockbuster four-team deal and Derrick Rose returning to the New York Knicks from the Detroit Pistons.   The Pistons are keeping Blake Griffin on the bench for the time being as they continue to explore trade opportunities for the six-time All-Star. The Cleveland Cavaliers are also holding Andre Drummond out of games in hopes of dealing him.   Teams will try to pursue other impact players such as Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine ahead of the March 25 deadline, while a young playmaker like Lonzo Ball or veteran role players like JJ Redick, George Hill and P.J. Tucker could all be on the move to help contenders.  For more NBA coverage, check out B/R's surprise landing spots for the league's top trade targets.

Lonzo Ball without a 40 inch vertical
Yea that‚Äôs Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe
"Point Zion is definitely a thing. They don't run it all the time, but Zion is probably our second or third leading ball handler behind Lonzo and maybe Bledsoe."
"Harrison Barnes but I don't see why the Kings do that.  Maybe Aaron Gordon, but his injuries are concerning.    Lonzo Ball maybe  and get back another pick from Pelicans."
"Maybe big Mitch or future draft picks if that was the case  I don‚Äôt see Knicks having much any current young player that would fit next to Zion and Ingram as well as Lonzo can.  Lonzo is the defensive, knock down open 3, finding guys in transition glue guy at the guard spot that compliment the offensive driven Forwards of Pelicans. Ideally you want a better ball handler and half court offense PnR master point guard to set up Zion and Ingram but given that Zion and Ingram can both handle the ball and create their own shots it‚Äôs less demanding of Lonzo to be that type of play maker, he just has to be the guy who does everything else to cover for Zion and Ingram on defense, team communication, setting up the other guy as the off ball passer and knock down open 3"
"Im not so sure about that. Assuming the Hornets wanted Ball, a deal for a few of the Hornet assets plus a separate sign and trade for Lonzo would make a lot of sense."
"can people please stop with the Lonzo to Charlotte stuff. Dude's going to get massively overpaid, and as it stands he'd probably be our 4th or 5th best guard. We are S T A C K E D at guard and have no bigs.   Also, I'm happy that LaMelo is attracting attention to the team and all that, but I want nothing to do with a full on LaVar Ball media circus, which would inevitably happen if the two good Ball brothers teamed up. Things are better when drama is low key around here."
Lonzo Ball is #9 in the NBA in RPM
"Yeah, Morant really came in hard in the clutch against the Pelicans with his crazy 35% shooting getting locked up by Lonzo Ball.  Get the fuck out of here, Pelicans fans know better than anyone else when it comes to Ja's deficiencies. He's a great young talent but your agenda is unbearable."
"Don't let your perception be skewed by these numbers though. Most guys get between 25-45 a night on average. The Myles Turner, Lonzo Ball, Thad Young types for example. Harden with the insane year he having usually gets about 60-70, although he has 72 tonight.  So 50+ is good, 60+ is great, 70+ is amazing  It just so happens McConnell's game tonight is the 2nd best I can remember all season (I recall Steph Curry getting over 100 one game)"
Lol I remember a post a week ago talking about how well Lonzo Ball was playing and how he had an outside chance at making an All-NBA defensive team. The Pelicans are one of the worst defensive teams in the league and that really makes sense when you look at this list.
"No, not putting a game on national TV that people are guaranteed to tune into - yes, because of a hot storyline involving a perpetual MVP candidate, a new superteam and big passionate sports &amp; media markets in Houston and New York - in favor of a game featuring two teams that aren't gonna draw ratings outside their markets would be a mistake. I get the basketball purism, but there's a business side of this. This isnt last year when it was fucking baffling why Steph/Klay/Dray/KD-less Santa Cruz Warriors and Zion-less 33-minutes-of-Lonzo-Ball Pelicans blowout losses were on national TV instead of Toronto and Denver, this actually makes sense. Jazz-Sixers isn't a ratings draw. If there was nothing else going on, sure, throw it on, but here it takes a backseat."
I‚Äôm not going to argue with you about this but Nicolo Melli and Jaxson Hayes are not better defenders than Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart...
"Yes, Lonzo Ball is a bottom 20 defender in the league  &gt;There‚Äôs a reason GTj is near the top of the list, he‚Äôs not a great defender being dragged down by his team. It isn‚Äôt a full indictment of his defense, but there‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs the worst defender on a bad defensive team.   Lol what are you talking about? GTJ is arguably the best defender on the Blazers..."
"&gt;Agree to disagree.  My understanding is we got Lebron and management realized we had a championship window.  They saw the young core play for a few years and decided that wasn‚Äôt their best chance to win a chip, AD was.  I agree that is what happened.  &gt;There may or may not have been some other move to make, but Butler doesn‚Äôt compliment Lebron nearly as well as AD does.   Arguably true, but Butler would've cost 1/10th as much to acquire, so really, who cares?  And James can seemingly play with anyone.  &gt;Some people will see it as a bad move I guess, but you‚Äôre in the minority.  I obviously am in the minority, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.  &gt;If we win again this year, are you going to admit it was a good move? Or will you still be on the ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt paid off yet‚Äù tip?   First off, whatever the Lakers win in this and subsequent years is really irrelevant.  Davis was a UFA this past December, and could've signed with anyone, Los Angeles included.  There was absolutely no need to spend a decade of assets to acquire him unless you believed the window was just 1 year -- in which case, again, that was way too much to spend for one title.  That said, I would not consider two rings ""paid off"", no.  As I said, historically, the Lakers win 2.3 titles every 10 years.  And they traded an entire decade of assets for Davis.  Two titles would be getting close, but if it winds up being a title last year and this year, followed by 10 years of bad teams, I am calling that no better than a mediocre trade.  There are many variables.  Maybe De'Andre Hunter never makes it back from his leg injury.  Maybe Lonzo Ball never gets any better.  Maybe those 3 first-round picks all wind up being late-twenties picks in shallow drafts.  Those are all possibilities.  On the other hand, Ingram is already an All-star, and putting up better numbers this year than Davis is.  And Ball is still younger than, say, Larry Bird was as a rookie -- not that they compare as players.  And Hunter was posting 17 ppg for Atlanta, and hasn't played a full season yet.  If all three of those guys wind up All-stars, and a couple of the first-round picks are very good players, then that trade looks really quite bad.  &gt;Personally I‚Äôm ecstatic that I get to watch Lebron and AD for years to come, calf strain and all.   Hopefully Davis winds up playing more, and not an expensive disabled-player-exception."
Alexa play Lonzo Ball rap. Me and shorty about to get DOWN.
Lonzo Ball is absolute dog shit whenever i watch the Pelicans
Lonzo Ball
"Honestly I think one of Ingram or Lonzo will have to go, and presumably it would be Lonzo. As great of a passer as Lonzo is he really isn‚Äôt a true PG, I‚Äôd have to think they bring in a starting PG eventually and there‚Äôs not gonna be a lot of ball to go around in that case."
Wait no Lonzo Ball?!?!? According to r/nba he is the second greatest three-point shooter only to Steph this year? Can't believe the soon to be All-NBA player isn't in the contest /s
"Nah, I was a BBB hater of Lavar, Lonzo and Gelo until I watched Melo. Then I became a fan because my favorite type of player is Kyrie/Iverson, handles with swag and LaMelo has that since Chino. He got me liking BBB after watching Ball in the Fam and shit.  Through out all that, I knew Lonzo is overhyped and Gelo is trash. and I was right."
"Yes Simmons is definitely a better playmaker rn. however passing is part of Playmaking, and lonzo's passing talent surpasses that of Simmons. Once Lonzo fully rounds up his perimeter game he might just be one of the best young point guards in the league. He already has the defense and the shooting, it's time for his ball handling and confidence to flourish"
"Since QuickNatural posted a fake Lonzo Ball stat line, he is scoring 1.1k upvotes per 8 hours, on a 130 upvotes to downvote ratio."
Lonzo Ball should considered for second team.
"""The lonzo ball tattoo sleeve makes attractive women want to have sex with you!"""
"How many players in the league have had as many negative posts about them on here?  Or better yet, how many non-superstars who are completely unproblematic off the court get as much negative attention as Lonzo Ball?  That's why he's getting shown some love."
Lonzo Ball
"I'm glad I blocked Posts about him since he was drafted. I almost forgot that he was in the league.  So please, if you make posts about him don't use ""Lonzo‚Äôs"" because I only filter out ""Lonzo"" and ""Lonzo Ball"". Thx!"
"He‚Äôs alright but he ain‚Äôt lonzo ball, have you seen his stats posted today, and yesterday, and the day before?"
I wouldn't say so. Lamelo is more of an on-ball creator while Lonzo is insanely good off the ball. They'd fit perfectly together
Ive actually been very surprised by this sub‚Äôs infatuation with Lonzo Ball. I thought it would die down when he went to the Pels but it‚Äôs actually gone up.
"Lonzo is going to get crazy overpaid.  He‚Äôs little more than a spot up 3 wing defender.  He is going to get paid as a lead ball handler, but he ain‚Äôt it."
For all the scrutiny Lonzo Ball gets (much of it from his dad's nonsense) he seems incredibly well adjusted and friendly as a person/nba player. Which is incredible being as though Lavar Ball is his dad lol.
"lmao I searched for ""Lonzo sleeve"" and found this  [https://www.etsy.com/nz/listing/733515995/lonzo-ball-temporary-tattoo-sleeve-for](https://www.etsy.com/nz/listing/733515995/lonzo-ball-temporary-tattoo-sleeve-for)  Now everyone can ball like Ball"
"I don't think anybody can get it done on their own. LeBron surrounded by Lonzo Ball and Larry Nance Jr. wasn't making the playoffs. And even with Kyrie and Love next to him the KD GSW just steamrolled him. Same GSW teams Harden would take to 6 or 7 with a one legged CP3 next to him if he's lucky.   LeBron's the second greatest player ever. MJ is the greatest. Even MJ wasn't getting it done on his own, he kept losing in the first round. People used to knock Wilt before that for not being able to beat 4 All Star HOFers by himself, which was dumb too.   It's definitely a team game, if we're going to hype people for succeeding with stronger teams you can't hold it against someone when they get a stronger team and get their turn at it."
"Since this comment was posted, Lonzo Ball is averaging 18.9/7.4/6.9 on 52/43/88 shooting."
Who is starting over Lonzo? I can‚Äôt think of a franchise that would take Devontae Graham or Malik Monk over Lonzo Ball right now
"Maybe the Ball father wasn't wrong after all. as soon as LaMelo Ball got drafted and started torching these bums Lonzo elevated his level of play. Following this train of thought imagine what would happen if LiAngelo ""the steal god"" Ball was in the NBA, and if the three brothers were in the same team? Championship guaranteed. NEVA LOSS"
"Lamelo‚Äôs stock skyrocketed the last couple of years. I think a lot of people that didn‚Äôt follow him closely still thought he was the undersized, half court chucking Ball brother. For so many years, Lonzo was seen as the super-prospect of the family that a lot of people missed how good Lamelo became."
"No.   But him growing up and consistently playing against older players, pros, and fucking Lonzo Ball made him learn how to impact the game with skill.  Once he hit his growth spurt it just became unfair."
Have you ever seen Lonzo Ball and Alonzo Mourning on the same NBA court? Neither have I.
"Since this post was posted, Lonzo Ball is averaging 18.9/7.4/6.9 on 52/43/88 shooting."
"Lonzo is much better than Ball and always has been.  And honestly, you should package picks and send Bledsoe off somewhere, not give up two quality young players that fit in Zion and BI's timeline."
"You would have to look very, very hard to find a highschool (public school too, they can‚Äôt recruit and offer scholarships) that has 4/5 starters end up in the NBA (well liangelo was fleshier, point still stands), three of them drafted top 10.   And it‚Äôs not like Chino didn‚Äôt play in the half court. Even at UCLA Lonzo was taking step backs and driving. It‚Äôs clear his half court ability isn‚Äôt cut for the nba but acting like he‚Äôs only played full court cherry pick ball is stupid."
idk if id say rj and lonzo were hits yet  and zion is definitely not a primary ball handler
Lonzo ball has a 40‚Äô inch vertical?
I can‚Äôt believe Lamelo is already this good. I was probably higher on him more than most but he‚Äôs already as good as Lonzo if not better. The game just comes way more naturally to him which is crazy. I thought he would get bullied way more in the league just because of how young and relatively skinny he still is. But dude can flat out ball and his shooting splits are impressive as hell.
"Worst fan take:  *After 1-3 bad games that an all star/MVP level player is trash/overhated/washed/exposed (aka those weird Facebook people that create accounts just to hate on like one player)  Worst YouTube Take: Lonzo Ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical  Worst Media/NBA Award: 2016 All NBA  Deandre Jordan being voted 1st team All NBA tied with James Harden not making any All NBA team (Kyle Lowry, CP3, Klay Thompson, Russell Westbrook and Damien Lillard) being guards who made it over him"
Lonzo ball-esque
"pine /pƒ´n/ verb gerund or present participle: pining      miss and long for the return of.     ""I was pining for my boyfriend""  You may not be aware, but we are in a thread discussing Lonzo Ball, and how good he has been playing recently. Some people here are frustrated Lebron takes too long bring the ball up the court compared to Lonzo. I'd argue he actually does try to push the ball up the court with those long passes, and while some do lead to turnovers, I still trust Lebron over Lonzo."
eh Lonzo was always super valuable to winning even when he was with us. Might not have always had the best box score stats but people seemed to play harder when he was on the court knowing they‚Äôd get the ball if they were open.
Lonzo looks like he‚Äôs been told to defer to BI and Zion which makes sense but SVG is insistent on playing the black hole of Bledsoe which really takes away from touches Ball should be getting. Yesterday in a 4 point loss Bledsoe played 34 mins and managed to be a team worse -20 and this seems to happen every game. Bledsoe needs to play 20 mins or less
"Ingram has more talent, but I also think he forces his shot a lot more. Lonzo plays much more in the flow of the offense. Also I can‚Äôt help but dislike how much he‚Äôs been forcing the ball in crunch time this year and almost none of them go in"
I‚Äôm still gonna call him Lonzo Air Ball
"Uh, Jason Kidd could operate a half court offense. Lonzo... Lonzo just looks like he doesn't want the ball."
"It‚Äôs kinda weird how the pelicans are using him as a spot shooter with Bledsoe playing PG, should be having lonzo playing the PG and dishing the ball out"
"And this is the biggest difference between Lonzo and Melo. Dude decided he was gonna pass before he even got the ball despite the closest defender being \~10 feet away. On the contrary, LaMelo is pulling that 10 times out of ten with the ultimate confidence. Lonzo gonna be kicking himself when he watches this clip back."
Tbf all that ball movement was about to lead to to an absolutely wide horn 3 for Lonzo. Just a good defensive play from Donte
Lonzo Ball getting so much love from r/nba recently. I don't mind it though

"The whole ‚ÄúLonzo pushes the ball well‚Äù has got to be one of the most overstated skills of any player in the league since Kevin Love‚Äôs outlet passes. It‚Äôs like everyone wants to talk themselves into Lonzo being better than he is. His D is above average, but not great, his three is (currently) above average but not consistently good.   He‚Äôs a solid player. A rich man‚Äôs Delon Wright. A poor man‚Äôs Fred VanVleet."
"In theory, you‚Äôre right, but that wasn‚Äôt going to happen. The Sixers didn‚Äôt have interest in Tatum. They had telegraphed that they were in love with Fultz and that the trade was essentially for Fultz. Ainge does not make that trade unless he has a high degree of certainty that Tatum will not be picked by the Sixers or the Lakers. If anyone, the Sixers would have picked Lonzo Ball or Josh Jackson over Tatum."
Lonzo should have taken that wide open 3. Thats pretty much the perfect shot  when in that situation and he passed on it  Ingram probably panicked when he got the ball back off those kinds of looks Lol
"You need Ingram to become the definite closer down the stretch because in that sequence he could‚Äôve definitely went 1v1 and took an off the dribble 3 instead of trying to pass the ball.  And at the end of the day the COACH needs to understand Bledsoe is not a starter on this team.  Lonzo Hart Ingram Zion Adams  Is the starting lineup  Bledsoe Redick/Lewis Alexander Walker Melli Hayes/Hernangomez  In the off season they need to get very good role players to come off the bench because the starting line up is worthy enough to be a top team.. they need 3 point shooters and defenders off the bench, but I believe they should go with Kira as the off the bench PG next season and keep the rotation of Hayes &amp; Hernangomez off the bench.  A 3 big man rotation of Adams/Hernangomez/Hayes is going to help them a lot if all of them are getting 16 minutes a game."
Lavar Ball is gonna go crazy on Lonzo for not taking that last shot.
"I dont think the Pels fucked that up. Good ball movement, good rotations by the Bucks.  If it wasnt for the charge, Lonzo got a wide open look at the end"
"Lonzo ""Ben Simmons"" Ball"
Lonzo Ball swinging it while wide open yikes
"lonzo ""elite shooter"" ball passing up an open look to tie the game"
Lonzo was WIDE open and couldn't wait to get that ball out of his hands
Are we sure lonzo ball isn‚Äôt an all star caliber player?
Lonzo ball is who steph curry thinks he is
Lonzo ball.
Lonzo Ball wannabe
Lonzo Ball is more culturally impactful IMO
Lonzo Ball- esque
That‚Äôs why I think it could make sense to swap Kemba for Horford and improve our front court and simultaneously make a deal for a pg who fits the team better. Lonzo is an obvious option because of how getting a pg his size would work within Brad Steven‚Äôs defensive system and the way he‚Äôd help our ball movement. Lonzo-Smart-Brown-Tatum-Horford sounds pretty close to the ideal Brad Stevens lineup and the ball movement would be so much better.
"If it weren't for Josh Hart in the underrated category, Lonzo Ball would somehow be both the most overrated and underrated player on the Pelicans. There are some people on r/NOLAPelicans who think Ball is the most important and valuable player on the team and then there are some who think you couldn't even get a protected second round pick for the guy."
Expect they have the top 2 6MOTY instead of Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram?
"Pretend you don't know Kyle's age.  He's a proven floor general who can handle the ball, shoot from range, defend well (and often up a position) good for 20 points and 6-7 assists at extremely high minutes.  You wouldn't trade Maxey for that? You're like Peter Griffin on this shit. Lowry is Lowry but Maxey could be anything! He could even be Lowry!  Win now, if you didn't do that you wouldn't have AD and you'd still be trying to make Lonzo fit in and around LeBron and Kuzma."
"kind of rich coming from a team who had to struggle through a whopping 6 years out of the playoffs, getting a bunch of lottery picks, being gift wrapped the best player of his generation in free agency and then trading a package with fucking Lonzo Ball for a MVP candidate"
"Idk why you got downvoted, realistically they actually do say no.  &amp;#x200B;  Sure Tatum is better than both but he makes an badly built team become even worse. Lonzo has done great with ball duties a little over the past month and Ingram is not thatm much worse of a scorer than Tatum while also being a better playmaker."
This is a terrible trade for the Pelicans. The difference between Tatum and Ingram is not Lonzo Ball
Lonzo was still part of the Ball Circus.  Pop wouldn‚Äôt have taken him if the Lakers included their first round picks for 20 years.
IDK. Maybe he can trade him for at least Lonzo Ball. Way better passer and defender than Kemba.
"Phenomenal vision and passing, but poor offensive game.  Lonzo ball similar story."
"The spurs have played 3 less games than the pelicans. No idea why people are acting like the spurs haven't played this whole month.   Keldon and Lonnie are both negative defenders right now. Derrick White has played 8 games all year and missed training camp because of injuries. I would say he's the spurs best perimeter defender. Dejounte has been better this year on defense than last year but still gambles too much imo, he's definitely a plus defender though. Patty Mills works hard to stay in front of guys but if his man gets the ball it's bad. Rudy Gay mostly plays 4 now and struggles to keep up with wings. Devin Vassell has been great for a rookie, definitely an above average defender already. The main reason our defense isn't bottom 10 is because of Jakob Poeltl, Devin, and Dejounte.  The pelicans do not have a bad roster at all, especially defensively. Eric Bledsoe was all defense last year and has been a good driving threat most of his career. Sure his defense probably didn't warrant that selection but he's a good defender. Lonzo Ball is a good spot up shooter and defender. Josh Hart is a great defender. Steven Adams is a reliable center. I'd say in terms of wing defense, the pels and spurs have been pretty similar.  Conley could definitely see a spot. He's been very impactful to the jazz and it shows in their lineup stats. His basic stats are basically worse across the board compared to DeMar's though so I think either of them deserve it over Zion."
A pelicans fan who presumably watches a lot of Lonzo ball gets downvoted for stating a reasonable opinion. Fuck reddit breh.
BI was already looking like a stud before he had to sit out with blood clots  Lonzo was playing great along side Lebron before they both got hurt too  Hart was always a pretty good role player. Defended the post well and got a lot of O rebounds  Kuz has improved off ball and defense since he got drafted  Caruso was a g leaguer turned into key rotation player  THT had a huge jump just from last season to this season already to the point where he was taking minutes from vets  Clarkson was always a bucket getter. He‚Äôs in a better situation than he was with us fighting to even sniff the playoffs let alone have a top seeded team
"Porzingis for Steven adams, hart, and lonzo.    Mavs get a reliable center, secondary ball handler, and round out their defense.    Pelicans get to play zion/KP at the 4/5 on offense but vice versa on defense."
This dude is mr Lonzo Ball is a top 40/30 player.
Brogdon  They need a true pass first point guard who can run the offense. A horford like center who can pass the ball would be great like Wendell carter jr.  Lonzo would be nice too.
"I think passing against overloaded defenses is the most simple type of passes and the best PGs set the table for others and get the most out of them. The truly effective ones can also score themselves (Nash, Magic, Paul) but honestly with them distributing it's usually not the best option (those 3 in their careers have consistently led better offenses than LeBron for example and they can't score like him at all).  Rubio manages to be an above average offensive player while sucking at scoring by being a top tier passer. Simmons is similar. Lonzo is probably the most gifted passer in the league and his scoring leaves much to be desired (the Pels moved him off ball and he's primarily asked to score but he's below average at that - still an above average offensive player because of his passing though).  I really don't agree with you on Ben either. What you call passive assists are usually the best types because it's a lot easier to get open for a great shot off a cut than off standing still and waiting for a kick out from the paint."
One Lonzo Ball please
"I'd try and Turn Adam's, Bledsoe and Reddick into Myles Turner. Then I'd give IT a shot, A starting Lineup with, Lonzo, Ingram, Zion and Turner would have crazy defensive potential and IT can Handle the ball and even though he is a defensive liability he can be hidden."
"&gt;*but would you think Lakers would still trade for AD THIS year, given the team has THIS season‚Äôs iteration of Hart, Lonzo, and BI?*  Lakers with Julius, Kuz, Lonzo, Hart, BI or Lebron/Kuz/Zo/Hart/BI is very different.  I really like where Brandon/Zo/Josh are at, but I think they're still too young even now to fit on Bron's timeline. They can't hold off guys like Kawhi/Giannis/All of the Nets. Also, Bron's not great for *their* timeline. I like seeing Brandon get touches at running point, and having the pressure to carry a team with Zion--he needs those reps. He's *too good* to be a roleplayer for Bron.  The Pelicans without AD I guess would end up in the lottery 2020 draft and hit on Edwards, Wiseman, Ball, or Patrick Williams. Or we end up in a trade with the Celtics and we get a different young core to build off of and probably end up lottery after that first year anyway."
Lonzo ball
"Cade Cunningham - Trevor Lawrence: Tall/Big generation talents that every team wants  Patrick Beverly - Jalen Ramsey (ramsey a lot better but the attitude and skillset): Defensive focused players in LA that are aggressive, get a lot of fouls, talk shit and love to take on the star player of the other team, heart and soul of team  Daniel Jones RJ Barrett:Young top 10 picks out of 2019 Duke that have been really good but sometimes inconsistent. Are both doubted and underrated by media  Kyler Murray Devin Booker or Lamelo Ball: Young exciting prospects out of Arizona (Besides Ball) that will be top players in the future  Aaron Donald Rudy Gobert: Large players that impact the entire defense of their team  DK Metcalf/Zion Williamson: Large freak athletes with a really bright future in the league  Baker Mayfeild Lonzo Ball: Top picks in their respective class that haven't panned out but are still good players, Lonzo is a lot like a QB and they both have been overshadowed by better players in their draft"
"Yeah, a second-tier 3/4 on a meh contract seems like the thing to do with CJ as the matching salary (because first-tier ones don't move).  Tobias Harris as you said, Hayward if something changes there, Barnes if Sacramento changes their thinking, Thaddues Young. I actually think Julius Randle would be great in Portland. Maybe a Lonzo Ball sign-and-trade?"
Really don't understand how Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball are in the same category as Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram.    Gordon has been in the league for 7 years and hasn't sniffed an ASG. Lonzo will never get there. BI and Brown (and KP for that matter) are already All Stars.
"Isn't guys like Lowry, CP3, Dragic, Conley and even Lonzo Ball available?   The way his performance has been looking, other teams would rather have those above."
"I'm not sure if you're asking where they take the date or who the date is, but my friend was a part time model who somehow got some fame with some big names (RHJ, Ronald Darby the corner back for the Super Bowl Eagles who apparently was super quiet and odd, and she claimed she went to a club once where Lonzo Ball was but for some reason that's where I drew the line and didn't believe her lol."
"No no. Enjoy your regular season. #2 in the West is a big deal. Will you keep CP3 for next season or trade him to the pelicans for assets? You can get Lonzo in a sign n trade, for example, and the pelicans need someone to see the ball to Zion."
"Did the Pelicans miss any major players? They looked incredibly out of sync out there. KD only played part of the 2nd quarter and some of the 3rd but by the time he went to the bench the Nets were almost up 40 (and finished the half 79-59... 80 points in a half is A LOT).  It felt like even the Nets B-team really made a ton of trouble for the Pels, who sometimes reverted to just giving the ball to Zion, a non-shooter, on the top of the key, and expecting miracles (or more realistically, fouls). I think to end the 2nd Zion was at the top of the key, passed to Lonzo on the 3pt line, who just passed the ball back to him with no action in between, which just seemed bizarre."
That move by Lonzo Ball was cowardly. Though given how many dumbass fans think Brandon Knight got embarrassed by DeAndre Jordan it's not surprising.
\[Highlight\] Lonzo Ball makes shrewd executive move
"trae young is on the list and Lonzo ball isnt ranked over either of those guys. If you mean Lamelo, id probably disagree with you on that Lamelo&gt;Jaylen Brown if we are going off of potential"
"Every time I watch the Pelicans, I think if it wasn‚Äôt for Lamar Ball we‚Äôd talking about what a great #3 Lonzo would be for a championship team... plays D, doesn‚Äôt really turn the ball over and is only getting better on offense, like dude is still super young"
"Yes. People are saying no, but who are you leaving off? Maybe he should be on, but it's not some crime  RJ is a good player, he's athletic, his feel for the game has improved and he's shooting better this year. But he's still well below average effeciency scorer and he's best suited with the ball in his hands  There are a lot of good players in the league at the moment. People are saying he's got a better future than Jarrett Alan and Lonzo, and maybe that's true (I don't think it is, but it's close) but it isn't a big deal"

Lonzo Ball in the NBA. Tony Romo all-time in any sport.
Lonzo Ball.

"What do you expect him to go full Lonzo Ball and just watch his teammate get swarmed back? Especially as a new guy, that is just what you do.   No idea what was going through OGs mind here but GTJ did exactly what he should have done."
Trade Lonzo Ball for Chris Paul and you immediately have a playoff team
Lakers Lonzo Ball
"I dunno dude. Here's the [tweet in question](https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1379444827872317440). Seems like the general consensus is he's such a bad defender that Lonzo ball is better.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO that's nonsense, but it's hard to imagine that this is some coordinated trolling attempt."
"&gt; The Mavs' relative oRTG was still much better.  This is a cheap cop out because you didnt realize how similar those two were offensively. Just to let you know. ""Relative oRTG"" is just bullshit lol.  As for Bledsoe he has played so much because the young guys werent ready. If we were healthy right now he probably wouldnt be getting as many minutes but we have been missing most of our guards recently.  As for SVG I cannot believe I am still having to say this.  &gt;because Ingram had the green light to hero ball and iso into a turnover or low percentage shot  He did NOT have the green light to do this. Players and SVG psuedo-called him out in the post game almost every time because it wasnt the game plan. One time Stan went so far as to say the ball was supposed to go to Zion but the ""team"" decided otherwise.   &gt;Y'all don't have the roster to be that bad  The thing is we do. Its getting better. Replaced a few net negatives with some positive only to run into injuries when we did so. Shit happens.  &gt; I get that he has a bigger offensive load but Ingram's defense has regressed HARD since his LA days.  Considering the defensive improvements of Zion, Jax, Nickeil, Kira, and even Lonzo over this season, what should that tell you about BI? I know what it says because I havent missed a game all season. Brandon doesnt give any effort on the defensive side of the ball. Its been a major point of frustration for Pels fans. It has 0 to do with Stan either because BI did this last year."
"Taking the bait? There was literally debates on social media today if he was even better than Lonzo Ball, and an alarming amount of people said they would take Ball. It‚Äôs not just ESPN, it‚Äôs everywhere"
"Lonzo can‚Äôt hit shit, but hell just keep stealing the ball."

People must have forgotten that Igoudala back in his philly days was a #1 option. Not a good enough option to take them deep or anything but still an alpha dog. Lonzo is a #6 scoring option on the starting five.  Igoudala was Aaron Gordon athletic while Lonzo is Shaun Livingston(post injuries) type of athletic. Except Lonzo doesn't have nowhere the scoring ability.  Even Lonzo's assists are inflated because he is just throwing the ball to a guy who goes 10/12 or 15/18 in games. Real Lonzo is the guy pre Zion. And that Lonzo is what every team that trades for him is going to get.
"It's his lack of handles. Lonzo has a great first step and burst, he just doesn't have the ball handling to do it when he's dribbling the ball."
"Yes! I got to watch ever Lonzo game for a few years and I don‚Äôt think the average fan understands how athletic he is. Specifically his speed and agility with the ball reminded me of Westbrook, but he never wanted any part of getting fouled after going to the paint"
"Lonzo‚Äôs a 38% 3P shooter now and cuts/crashes for rebounds at a high level for a guard. There might actually be more open shots for him in Golden State since everyone and their mother sends 2 to sell out on Steph.  Could definitely do worse at the 2 spot for Golden State‚Äôs offense then a 6‚Äô6‚Äù guard/wing that can spot up, distribute the ball effectively, guard his position and push the ball in transition. It just feels like you don‚Äôt want to give Lonzo credit for the player he is. ü§∑"
"I'm thinking when Klay gets back the fit is terrible. if you are talking this season I probably agree. Lonzo is just nothing like Iggy, despite what this thread is telling you. he's nothing near the defender or off ball player Iggy was"
"Obviously Iggy had a higher peak and a better career then Lonzo‚Äôs set up to have right now, but  distill down Golden State Iguodala down to what he just did there, and I really can‚Äôt imagine Lonzo would have trouble sliding into a similar role. It‚Äôs pretty clear that aside from the star players Golden State is happier with guys that move in space off the ball, hustle for loose balls, and put out effort defensively than guys who only play basketball 1 way even if they‚Äôre physically gifted and have the potential to give you 20-30 points on a night they get hot."
"Not really. They can afford it and stay under the tax. The squeeze comes when you‚Äôre paying Zion $35M per year in two years. If you also have BI at a max, Lonzo at $20M, and Hart at $10M. You are pretty up against it.  I mean, the Adam‚Äôs contract isn‚Äôt ideal, but they can keep Ball and Hart if they want."
Lonzo Ball
We are DESPERATE for passing.  The problem is Steph and Dray are our main ball handlers and it‚Äôs our bench squad that has 0 ball movement.  So if we got Lonzo we‚Äôd play him 30 mins a game off the bench like we used to with Iggy.  Not sure he‚Äôd like that role.
Lonzo Ball torches 8 threes.
Okay but why isn‚Äôt Lonzo Ball getting some MVP respect?
"Lonzo isn't a pure point like people really want to believe. He'd actually be a fantastic 2/3 in the Warriors' system with his length, shooting, and defense. Could have definitely seen him transforming into an Iggy type for them especially with his IQ and transition ability. He's probably much better served as a second ball handler given his limitations in the half court."
"Huh? Lonzo shoots 40% from 3, solid defense, and can easily play off ball with Steph.   Not sure if that Minny pick is even gonna be NBA ready to play with a 33 year old Steph."
"I love bogut but I‚Äôm doubting the legitimacy of this claim mostly due to a claim he made later in the podcast that the Warriors turned down a trade for lonzo and a pick for Oubre. There‚Äôs no way they did that because there‚Äôs no way NOP would‚Äôve thrown in a pick to lose a younger better player who is a RFA for an unrestricted FA who could make similar money. The whole point of trading Ball would‚Äôve been to get assets in case they didn‚Äôt sign him. Also from the warriors side, I can‚Äôt think of any conceivable reason they would reject that trade."
They got this shit all wrong because the Warriors offered Kelly Oubre for Lonzo Ball and the Pelicans declined
"That's just patently false. You can say we tried to offload him because we're skeptical about paying him but not because we can't afford to. We have 30 mil coming off the books just from Adams extension and James Johnson expiring. Another 18 mil available by trading Bledsoe, if we needed to, which becomes easier next season as that is the last fully guaranteed year on his contract. Are we interested in maxing Lonzo? Doubtful but the ball is in our court (no pun) and if he continues to play like he has been then I think we'll hold on to him.  Obviously we see him as an asset, otherwise we would have taken anything for him like we did JJ, so I can't see us letting him walk for nothing."

"I mean, he is? Lonzo Ball is a great player and to be a rich mans Lonzo is great.  Giannis is an MVP who has struggled in the playoffs and there has been genuine concern about him being able to get a team over the top.  Ben Simmons is a homeless mans version of Giannis who has been shooting 43% from the field since the ASB when all he does is take layups and shoot. He's straight trash tier right now.

5 Reasons Why Lonzo Ball Is Not Human!!!
Lonzo Ball has shot 38% from 3 on 7 attempts a game since the start of last season
so ben simmons is basically lonzo ball in PF body.
"&gt;thinking they win without the 2nd best player in the playoffs is just a bit absurd.   It's not remotely.  Offensively, Ingram alone replaces almost all of Davis' production, and the team would be by-far the deepest in the league.  &gt; You're overestimating current bron's carrying abilities thinking he wins a title with ingram, lonzo, kuzma etc and I'm high on him.  James has won with less, against better competition.  Who beats James, Ingram, Ball, Kuzma, Zubac plus Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner last year?  And that's assuming the Lakers don't use the pile of assets they burned to rent Davis on other upgrades.  They easily could've afforded Jimmy Butler and/or Malcolm Brogdon -- both of whom were traded for peanuts compared to Davis.  James, Butler, Ball, Ingram, Zubac with Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner wins last year easily. No one in the east could beat Butler + Adebayo, so they sure as hell are not beating Butler + James + Ingram. No in the west came close to the Lakers either, and this team is better.   &gt; Also the lakers were in a sizable playoff slump pre AD.   And will be in one again if he only plays 19 lackluster games per season.  Good thing they traded a decade of assets to rent him for one season, eh?"
"&gt; Lowry has been running our offence for years, he‚Äôs been shooting 8 attempts during those years while being a pass first PG. Having to run an offence has absolutely nothing to do with shooting 3s, in fact in gives you more of an opportunity to do so since the ball is always going to be in your hands. It‚Äôs always gunna come back to you as well if the team needs a play created.  8 attempts is very different than 9.4.   &gt; Who is the playmaker on the Pelicans then? Please explain how they run their offence, do you think it‚Äôs Bledsoe? Ingram? Do you think assists are the only way you make plays?  I said ""aside from Lonzo""  &gt; Nash is a better shot creator than all of the guys I listed. You simply don‚Äôt watch basketball and it‚Äôs very evident  You can repeat that all you want, doesn't make what you're saying any less true.  &gt; He‚Äôs already averaged 22+ ppg in multiple playoffs series btw, where it‚Äôs harder to get your shot off lol.  He averaged 17 points a game in the playoffs for his career."
"It's not a given their making the playoffs if he does stay . I gotta be honest I don't think lavines the guy you build around , they should have sold high on him . He's great as the 3rd best player in a big 3 but not as your best player. And him and  vucevic are terrible on defense . These two 1st round picks the bulls gave up could quite possibly be top 10  picks . I thought it was a bad trade the minute I seen it  . At best their what a 6 seed . And lonzo ball is nobodies saviour at the pg in free agency he can't run a half court offense . He's a good three and d guy that can run the break . It just seems like their just looking to mediocre."
"&gt; 4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all.  If Nash tried to double the number of 3s he takes, then defenses would play him differently and prevent him from taking that many 3s. Nash has to focus on running on offense more than trying to take 9.4 3s a game. He'd shoot more 3s, like 7-8, but not 9.4 lol. And even shooting that many more 3s he wouldn't be averaging some of the ridiculous points I see on this thread.  &gt; single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he‚Äôs averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now  Van vleet has a faster shot release and doesn't have playmaking responsibilities like Nash would have.  &gt; Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier  All of those guys, aside from Lonzo, aren't the playmaking point guards of their team who have to run the offense like Nash has to.   &gt; If think fucking Steve Nash can‚Äôt attempt 9.4 or more in today‚Äôs game   He wouldn't, because the only guys taking them are Steph, Dame, and Buddy Hield."
"4.7 was his BEST season so if he played today expecting him to double that is not crazy at all. I‚Äôve seen almost every single game of Fred Vanvleets career, he‚Äôs averaging 9 three point attempts a game right now and is NOT that great of a shot creator, taking ill advised shots is one of his worst qualities.   Duncan Robinson, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball, Terry Rozier all average 8-9 three point attempts a game. If think fucking Steve Nash can‚Äôt attempt 9.4 or more in today‚Äôs game then you are flat out misinformed and either never watch Nash play, don‚Äôt watch modern basketball or both."
"Hell no. Lonzo has length, better defense and handles the ball better. I'm more a fan of traditional PG's so it's Lonzo &gt; Schroder regardless for me"
PG this team is not ready for those Lonzo Ball passes.
"Though their stats are similar I thought they really had different roles. Doesn‚Äôt Schroeder have more on-ball creation ability, while Lonzo is more off ball? That ability to create his own shot and shots for others off the dribble is a very valuable skill."
This and he is better at full court press but it‚Äôs Lonzo all day. His ball movement is incredible.
"I already thought he‚Äôd get more than 4/84. Market is inflated asf rn. The Jrue contract also just made FA guard salaries a whole new ball game. Dennis is no where near Jrue so I think he‚Äôll get up to 25 per year. And if someone‚Äôs playing Dennis 25 per year, no way Rich Paul lets Lonzo sign somewhere for less."
"there are 2 ways to team build imo  one is to avoid overlap as much as possible, example defensive teams that are carries in offense by their best player. example 2016 thunder. russ and dursnt were not helped offensively by that roster but the defense of the team + durant and russ generating offense on their own made for a great team  the other is to sinergyze, putting players together that make each other better, like for example, the 2016 warriors where having so much shooting, passing amd off ball movement mafe everyone better  in melo case i think the answer is a bit of both. melo is mainly a scorer, a good one at that so you give him plauers who do stuff beside scoring cause the overlap is less  but also give him players who make his life scoring easier or make the best use of it, like a good pass first point guard who knows when and how to get him im good spots  (is no coincidence best melo play and teams came with point guards like billups or kidd)  so give him good defensive players, a point guard like lonzo ball, etc"
"Lonzo Ball - Jrue - Harris - Prime Melo - Allen  Melton - Clarkson - Thad Young - Derrick Jones - Dieng off the bench   Harris, Ball and Melo bring spacing, for the former elite one. Both Lonzo and Jrue bring ball handling and can be staggered, either with Clarkson if the team needs ISOs and scoring or with Melton if the team needs defensive stops. Allen is a great roll man and an above average rim protector. Both him and Thad Young can cover for Melo in a variety of ways, allowing Melo to slot at the 3. The team can play small ball too with Thad at center.   Dieng can bring 5 out spacing in the occasional line up. I think he should play especially in lineups with D. Jones, who can act as the athletic cutter."
Lonzo Ball
"To give context to the other answers, restricted free agency was created to help teams retain their young talent.  For example, Lonzo Ball will be one of the premier restricted free agents this offseason, as his rookie contract is expiring. The New Orleans Pelicans aren't at risk of him leaving though, since they can retain him by matching whatever offer he gets.  In some cases, teams will even trade for the player in order to acquire their restricted free agency status. We saw an example of this with Jarrett Allen, where the Cleveland Cavaliers wanted him as their long-term C and didn't wanna risk gambling for him in free agency. Instead of waiting for the offseason to try and sign him (and risk his team matching their offer), they gave up a 1st round pick to trade for him. Now they're guaranteed to retain him, as they can match whatever offer he gets in free agency."
Lonzo Ball is trending upwards to breaking the trend. Just needs to stay healthy
"The combined people out from both teams would make a playoff team.  Trae Young, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williams, John Collins, Danillo Gallinari, Cameron Reddish, Deandre Hunter, Josh Hart, Kris Dunn."
"He needs to shut the fuck up until he can score more than 2 points a game for god sake. The most glorified role player of all time.  Can you imaging how much better Warriors can be with, I don't know, Ben Simmons or  even Lonzo Ball instead of him?"
Lonzo Ball
"You don't get it, that's why Lonzo is a fit on their team. Lonzo has never been a good halfcourt creator because of his lack of a finishing ability, as well as his lack of pull up ability. His playmaking comes in transition, that's why he's such a good fit on Nola, because he can let Zion and BI handle the halfcourt while he spots up and moves the ball around."
"Bulls fan - if they miss playoffs, luck into top 4 picks, take one of the guards, sign Duncan Robinson to play the 2/3 roll with Vuc, PaW, Duncan, LaVine, Rookie  If make playoffs, sign Lonzo Ball, find and sign the shootiest FA 3 available"
"Hawks chance of winning (injured players) is out  EDIT:  &gt;Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart have all been ruled out for tonight's game vs Atlanta, per the Pelicans. (twitter.com)  any chance of me viewing this game is out"
&gt;Lonzo‚Äôs spot up shooting ability will become more valuable as Zion takes on more ball handling/playmaking duties.   What is the point of Lonzo then as your starting PG?
"There was a Lakers game a couple years back where John Wall mauled Lonzo mid air without even touching the ball, sending him crashing on to the floor no foul called and dudes on here were like ‚Äúgood block, great no call‚Äù"
Aaron Gordon and Lonzo Ball. Both are decent but neither is a star at this point. Give AG Lonzo‚Äôs point guard skills and 3pt shooting and you have an all-nba player
Norman Powell and Lonzo Ball
"He does do that, but rarely since Ingram as a shot creator and lonzo ball as playmaker exist"
"I don't understand how you could get from me talking about a floor general less movement and attack based passer like Draymond green, and then think this means I am talking about a heliocentric offense lmao. What about draymond green and Lonzo ball is heliocentric?!?  Steph having lots of hockey assets is from him creating opening and the beautiful game passing to open shooters the warriors were common for, not much to do with the traditional short roll and entry passing I'm talking about. Also I didn't say steph couldn't do these things, just that he would be better as his offball self, and having Lonzo come in as the top of the arch on ball initiator, whether it be hand offs or entry passes to giannis, or throwing quick whips to steph going back door or running to the corner, even  relocation. Think jrue can do this too just fine but I like lonzo for it more.  Also giannis definitely does play in a heliocentric offense, a lot of their offense revolves around the gravity of his threat down hill and his passing out of that. He has one of the highest offensive loads in the NBA    I get it was long but did you even bother to read my whole message lol."
Nola clearly wants ball. Just for the right price. Naw and Kira can give you what Lonzo gives you for a fraction of the price tho.
Is he (or Walker) the reason Nola doesn‚Äôt want Ball? I haven‚Äôt watched them play but Lonzo seems like a perfect fit...unless they see their other guards as better
"‚ÄúWe literally have to pray that our fringe playoff team is an attractive free agent destination. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only hope now.‚Äù  As opposed to praying our fringe lottery team hits absolute gold in the draft as our only hope?  The Chicago Bulls are one of the most prestigious NBA franchises of all time. There will be a bunch of guys who want to play with Lavine AND Vucevic. A top free agent can easily see himself as the missing piece and sign with us. We have enough cap space going forward for another max contract. We have Patrick Williams, who has all the intangibles to become a serious star player. If you‚Äôre so worried about draft picks we still have our 1st rounder next year. If we tanked there was absolutely no way Lavine stays, dude is in his prime and tons of teams will throw him serious money. It‚Äôs not so often you come across a player like Lavine so when you do you do whatever it takes to keep him. We have a core of P Will, Lavine, and Vucevic. Potentially Lonzo Ball and potentially a star free agent in 2022. Building through the draft doesn‚Äôt work as much as you think it does. I don‚Äôt know how you can be upset about this as a Bulls fan. Would you rather go the route Detroit is going? You‚Äôre acting like we gave up all of our assets for Vucevic when that‚Äôs simply not the case. AKME know what they‚Äôre doing and even if this doesn‚Äôt work out they‚Äôll go the route you want them to go so I don‚Äôt understand how you can be upset. Winning a championship isn‚Äôt as easy as just drafting a bunch of good prospects. There‚Äôs so many levels to it."
"OKC is not getting hot lmao.   Lonzo Ball is interested.  McConnell and Caruso are interested.  Williams will improve.  Lauri will be gone so we might have someone to guard someone on the bench.  Get a point guard and no reason this team cant be a four seed the next two years. Or we can keep getting seven picks and drafting Lauri Markkanen, Coby White, Wendell Carter Junior for the next 10 years.  They had to do something.  This is better than standing pat."
did you mean 42 for Lonzo Ball?   I think the decimal point was 1 off
"&gt;I'm gonna assume you live in New York because of your flare  Fair assumption, and up until the very end of 2019 you'd have been right, but I actually live in Texas. Not far from NOLA, actually (Houston). This has allowed me to get a taste of the ""southern culture"" common to cities like Memphis and NOLA. It's not appealing, at all, and I'm heading back to NY as soon as possible.  I understand your perspective, though. There are some people who fit in down south and feel right at home. But there is a reason that athletes and many other people who grew up in or closer to the tier one cities on or near the coasts don't tend to gravitate to places like NOLA or Memphis - just as your personal constitution fundamentally rejects NYC as a place to call home, so to will they reject Memphis, NOLA, or OKC or dare I say, even Houston.   Southern culture ain't for everyone. I used to think it was for me, which is why I uprooted my life (having spent almost all of it in NY, where I was born/raised, and then New England) to come down here. I didn't come for work, a marriage, or any other outside influence - I chose it freely because I felt at the time (despite having no first hand experienced) much like you do about these places.   I was wrong - I'll hold the L and go back. But the experience has made it very clear to me why a) people who warned me not to come here said what they said (I thought they were absurd at the time) and b) why someone like Lonzo Ball would be hesitant to spent much time in a place like NOLA. I understand 100% where a young man like him is coming from. Beyond money and the chance to play basketball, there is frankly very little a city like NOLA or Memphis can offer a person like that."
"Already did that to Troy and Bonga, this is no surprise. Never draft a jack of all trades player like Deni and then not get him the ball.  OKC is doing it right. They're letting Poku play his heart out and fail. Poku is doing 25% from the FG and from the 3 if I recall. He'll eventually adjust and tap into his potential. Took Lonzo 4 years.   I feel like with Deni we're gonna let his potential die"
"Honestly, I'm curious why don't the Lakers go for Lonzo Ball again with that kind of offer. It's what Lonzo is expecting. He also moves off ball and shoots the 3 ball well. Can handle ball when Lebron is off the floor. Seems like a good fit and he should mesh defensively."
I'd rather give Lonzo Ball 21+ million/yr than Shroder.
Lonzo Ball most likely
"Except they traded away Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, and picks for one of those players. Those three are all 1st rounders and two of em are top lottery picks.  But ya, if Lebron joins any team that team is now a contender and needs to push some chips in. Fortunate that LA got Bron, Bron could join half the teams in the NBA and those teams would automatically become a contender if they weren't before."
"Not at all - Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, we can throw 2 year/40 million deals and see what happens."
"He‚Äôs been shooting the shit out of the ball lately. Which is a welcome change. Would be excited about a Lonzo / NAW / Kira backcourt, but Bledsoe obviously needs time to run around and show how little he gives a fuck."
"Yeah I don't mind him bringing the ball up every once in a while if he's going to immediately drive and race by everybody. His passing has gotten better to his credit, but he needs to do WAY too much of it for this team to win.  Lonzo plz"
Curry would‚Äôve had the 2017 Thunder driving straight to Lonzo Ball
"Lonzo has been great defensively and is making shots, still think he is, and will be very good, but the fact that despite making his 3's well he's still below average efficiency and usage says it all.  He's still pretty powerless as an on ball guy in the halfcourt, teams just don't even bother even mixing up pnr coverage for him.  On the other end Lamelo has less defensive upside, but we've already seen team felt like they had to switch him on pnr and he's already shown way more shot creation.  Lonzo fit better on a team with a playmaking wing, but it's not like Lamelo couldn't fit on such team, Lamelo can already be a primary ball handler, Lonzo can't"
‚ÄúBarely any credit. I could coach that team tbh‚Äù about Nash.  1.	‚Å†Jayson Tatum 2.	‚Å†Donovan Mitchell 3.	‚Å†Bam Adebayo 4.	‚Å†OG Anunoby 5.	‚Å†De‚ÄôAaron Fox 6.	‚Å†Lonzo Ball 7.	‚Å†Johnathan Isaac 8.	‚Å†Jarret Allen 9.	‚Å†John Collins 10.	‚Å†Kuzma  On redraft of 2017. Holy crap that‚Äôs terrible.  ‚ÄúThank you for saying it. This sub is delusional sometimes‚Äù in response to someone saying Clippers and Sixers aren‚Äôt contenders.  Shall I continue?
"Danny needs to stop getting undersized scoring guards for our PG position. We need true playmakers beside JT and JB. Rob Williams is another guy who he selected that had injury concerns, and he stays hurt and his hip is pretty bad to where it's limited how many minutes he can play. He won't be our solution for a 5.  I wouldn't have half-assed it at trying to rebuild and contend at the same time. I would have committed to rebuilding around the Jays from the jump instead of signing Kemba and getting Kyrie. They didn't make us strong contenders, so I don't think it was worth it. I would honestly take somebody like Lonzo Ball currently over Kemba. He fits the Jays' timeline, he can play better defense, and he is a playmaker. We need that type of skillset at our PG position. We need a lot more guys who can play offense too, especially the big man positions."
"Unless your name is Lonzo Ball, Tyler Herro, Westbrook KP, or Begley, a bad game or stretch of bad games does not get posted here to push a narrative."
"Lonzo Ball is listed as **OUT** (thumb) as is Zion. BI (ankle) and Adams (foot) are both questionable, as is Iwundu. I doubt any of them play for the Pels tonight."
Naw Lonzo needs to be a primary ball handler. He legit is one of the best passers in the game
"""Do you know how many bricks I've seen Lonzo Ball throw up with that ugly jump shot?"""
Lonzo Ball
Imagine insulting randoms over lonzo ball... Can't relate
"No I'm insulted because you:  told me to ""shut the fuck up"" called me ""willfully ignorant"" called me ""a dumbass"" told me to ""read a book""  Because I said that Lavar and UCLA are responsible for Lonzo's fame hahahahah.  Imagine saying these thing talking about LONZO BALL lol"
You are so angry during a conversation about Lonzo Ball..  It's just reddit lmaooooo. Calm down.
And like I said....  Being a well known high school basketball player is not the same as being Lonzo Ball at UCLA during the 2016-17 season lmaoooo
You keep referring to Lonzo Ball as a freshman not realizing his popularity started WAY before then. That popularity began because he was the number 3 player in the country and Chino Hills highlights were getting millions of views and interactions on social media. He had 100's of thousands followers on Instagram. His popularity didn't start with UCLA or his dad.  The hell are you talking about. You seem to think just because you didn't know him in high school he wasn't popular.
There's a difference in being a well known high school basketball player and being Lonzo Ball in the 2016-17 season...  I'm not sure you actually believe what you're saying.. Cade Cunningham doesn't have 1/2 of the popularity Lonzo Ball had as a freshman at UCLA lol.
&gt;President of basketball operations Magic Johnson said the franchise needed a leader at the point guard position. The Hall of Famer selected Lonzo Ball out of UCLA with the second pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.  Imagine asking a teenager who is entering the league to be a leader of your franchise straightaway. Especially with that Lakers team which lacked some senior authority after Kobe retired.
"Ehh, you kind of need more Vets on the team to be good. This team most likely wouldn't have won last year, and I don't think they would become an actual playoff threat until maybe 2023/24.       Russell is good, but he's a defensive liability. Out of the Gs, I'd prob only keep Lonzo, Caruso, and THT.       I'd trade BI. He's kind of redundant with Kuz, but Kuz doesn't need the ball as much.       Randle, Nance, and Zubac are great, but there is no world I'm taking any of them over AD.       So overall in terms of the AD to Lakers trade, the only thing that really hurt was having to give up Lonzo. He could have been the guy to lead the team in 2028."
"I'm glad to see Lonzo, Kuz, Ingram and Randle all ball out in their own ways."
"You are overvaluing Wiggins. He‚Äôs an average defender and an average scorer (at best).   You could find guys like Dejountae Murray, Kelly Oubre (yes I know), Lonzo Ball, Tim Hardaway Jr, even Harrison Barnes.  I tried to choose guys not on rookie contracts cuz that‚Äôs not fair.  What about 3 cheaper players from Minnesota? I‚Äôm sure that would‚Äôve been more value. Honestly Wiggins isn‚Äôt better than your average player. Grabbing three average players in a trade for D Lo would have added depth."
lonzo ball
"***Randle*** : ball dominant forward with obvious weaknesses, flashes potential, but not consistency. Walked in free-agency.   ***Ingram*** : ball dominant forward with obvious weaknesses, flashes potential, but not consistency. Traded for AD.   ***Russell*** : ball dominant guard. had too high expectations placed on him from the start. Traded to make room for LeBron.   ***Clarkson*** : ball dominant guard. decent bench player. was a black hole. Traded to make room for LeBron.   ***Nance*** : great role player. Traded to make room for LeBron.   ***Lonzo*** : ball dominant guard with obvious weaknesses, flashes potential, but not consistency. had too high expectations placed on him from the start. Traded for AD.      The team wouldn't work that great together. There was too much overlap in the ball-handling department. Splitting up and going different directions was the best thing for each of them. Nance was the only flexible player on that team."
"you'd be naive to think Klay Thompson, the second greatest shooter in the history of the NBA is not gonna be able to shoot anymore. sure his defense might be not be great anymore, but he's gonna be a dangerous shooter. look at KD who came back from an achilles this year and he's having his greatest shooting season yet. Klay will be fine, his game wasn't built around athleticism like a Blake Griffin or Derek Rose.   second, simple man, you're assuming the rookies are gonna be 19 years old. they could draft seniors for all you know or the 19 year olds could be ready to make an impact like Lonzo Ball. that's besides the point because the Warriors wont be giving the rookies anything more than 10-15 mins a game and even less in the playoffs. they're just gonna be providing some depth on the bench.   not too mention this is the first year playing together for the majority of these guys without an offseason to practice. they're gonna have way more chemistry next year and be a lot more comfortable in the system.   you're naive as a banana brain if you think the Warriors are gonna be an 8th seed again next year. you're gonna be the first one who says it's not fair that the Warriors are getting a lotto pick because they're team has too much talent when the Wolves pick conveys lol.  stupid lebron stan."
"They're not in the same stratosphere and this season is showing why. LeBron's core was baby Ingram/Lonzo/Kuzma while Curry's is Draymond/Wiggins/Oubre. Curry has the better core who are all healthier, yet his team is an 8th seed.  Why? Because Curry is a mediocre defender and on-ball playmaker. Aside from scoring, his biggest team contribution is attracting doubles to confuse the defense. But a conversion on offense requires something else to happen to take advantage of said defensive breakdown. And defensive breakdowns are less common against the best teams."
"What does Lonzo provide off ball? Genuine question, not pointed."
"I've watched a few because im a Brandon Ingram fan but its tough watching Adams clog up the paint and make it harder for Zion and BI to score, Bledsoe chucking, and Lonzo being forced to give up the ball at half court and severly underutilized"
"as a fellow knicks fan, what exactly would be a better move? Lonzo pretty much is good at everything the team is lacking in a point guard right now. he can create shots for others, shoot a 3, and pass the ball. those are all things Payton does not do"
Lonzo Ball
I‚Äôve watched a lot of pelicans games this year and he most definitely does not struggle in the half court. He‚Äôs very capable of being a primary ball handler but the Pels don‚Äôt use him in that way unless Ingram + Bledsoe aren‚Äôt playing.   I hope the knicks get him im a huge Lonzo fan and I‚Äôd love to watch some knicks games next year
"I think he can and will provide it. He can already get into the paint pretty easily and has shown the ability to make some high level passes. Also, there aren't many great pg options right now. I don't think they are going to spend 25 million on Lonzo Ball. They could sign Derozan as a playmaker while starting Quickley at pg to maintain the spacing."
"This is simply not true, Ingram improved every year but Lebron joined the team that stunted his growth.   Lonzo Ball improved as well yearly.  Julius Randle improved a lot his last year with lakers.   Larry Nance was developed nicely   Jordan Clarkson was solid   Etc."
"Defense is mostly effort, and players who play 36 minutes as two way players are going to have less energy than players who come in for 20 minutes exclusively for defense. When you have someone like Jrue, Kawhi, Butler, Lebron, Lowry or Simmons expected to handle the ball and create offense at the same time as playing hard defense, of course their defensive metrics are going to go down purely because they have to play both sides. We‚Äôve seen players like Kawhi become more offensively oriented and lose their defense. It‚Äôs not like they actually stopped being good defenders.  Play Jrue like Caruso and Jrue‚Äôs defense would be even better than it is already and would shine on advanced defensive metrics. Other players like Lowry, Lonzo, Conley, etc would also have much better defense if they played Caruso‚Äôs role."
Yeah right theyre gonna lose in the playoff to former Lakers Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball by 30
"I've watched a lot of the Pelicans this year and their problems fundamentally come down to a few core problems I've noticed:  1) Their ""best 5"" interior defense is absolutely terrible at defending switches and PNR - Adams getting pulled out tears them apart. This pretty much nullifies Lonzo/Bledsoe's defense on the exterior, and Ingram being an absolute joke defensively makes them easy to pick apart. Seriously, their defense looks *so* much better defensively with Hayes/Marshall out there instead of Ingram/Adams despite the latter being better offensively.  2) On the offensive side, they need a genuine pullup threat from the guard position. Lonzo is a very good 3&amp;D player, but his offense relies entirely on his spot up 3 ball, which is a very high variance dimension and not something you can rely on game to game. Bledsoe cannot pullup for shit. They need to give Kira Lewis more minutes. Thankfully ""give the ball to Zion/Ingram and let him go"" has been a solid offensive strategy when he's been healhy, but its clear they dont have a plan B.  3) This is going to sound like a ""no duh"" but they need guys who can put ball in basket more efficiently. They are currently middle of the pack in eFG despite having arguably the most efficient player in basketball (meaning they'd be so much worse without Zion), but are bottom 5 in 3pAR as well."
Lonzo was supporting the family until their business partner stole a bunch of money from him. I know a couple years ago someone (maybe tmz) was able to piece together that almost everything associated with the ball family traced back to lonzos accounts.
"Lonzo ""Tommy DeVito"" Ball"
15. Ja Morant 16. Trae Young 17. Mikal Bridges 18. Domantas Sabonis 19. Anthony Edwards 20. Deandre Ayton 21. Tyrese Haliburton 22. John Collins 23. Jarrett Allen 24. Lonzo Ball 25. Collin Sexton
"He dominated the league until he got ""sick"". Even after ball, he's a freaking billionaire now. He's not only won, but dominated in every aspect of life. Even as a dad, his kid is a lil different, but is also a huge success. Dude people hated him cuz he was black and Bird was white Jesus; they hated him cuz he got hiv; they hated on him when he did the MJ video ""Remember the Time""; they've hated on Magic since he was here at State. But he's done nothing but make every one of his haters eat their words. The guy rebuilt the Lakers back to relevance. Do you think any other GM could have got Bron AND AD to LA? Granted he traded away his team but it paid off in spades. He made the craziest trade in my life time. I've seen crazy trades like the Cowboys and Herschel Walker trade, bit I've never seen a team trade not only leverage their starting line up but their future in all their draft picks as well. There was like 8 or 9 assets going to New Orleans for 1 player. Who coulda been a 1 year rental. He did whatever it took. And after he secured the greatest player of this generation from his hometown. Bron coulda went anywhere, especially the Knicks, and had more commercial success. But magic sold him on L.A. and Showtime. I truly believe Magic resigned the way he did cuz the Lakers were gona get shit dir how he did it, tampering and all that. So instead of having the Lakers take the hit, he took it cuz he could afford it. And it legit rolled off his back like water off feathers.   The Lakers got their guy and they won a ring. Regardless what batteries in the next 5 years they're ahead. I'll bet every team, not named Brooklyn, would give up their next 5 years for a ring this year. Like spend 5 years at or around .500 of you gave them a ring this year. They'd all take it.   So Magic is a winner there in my book. Had Palinka got the trade done giving up less than Magic offered originally, id say he jus planted the seed, but the trade was exactly what Magic said. Ya he did it with no regard for people's feelings, especially the young guys, but you gotta remember the NBA he came from, which was brutal. I mean if you watched the Jordan documentary, the Bulls  had Michael Jordan and they were like you're opinion don't matter were trading Scottie. If they did that to the biggest asset in the league, not jus the team but league, as they didn't care,  they absolutely won't care bout people like Lonzo Ball or Kyle Kuzma.   I can say with absolute certainty that Erving Magic Johnson is the greatest point guard to ever play the game. And that's from a Bad Boys Pistons fan. I know its blasphemous, but i think even Zeke would concede that.   If you're too young or jus never seen it, do yourself a favor and YouTube the Bird v Magic rivalry, cuz that will, ever be duplicated. Never! Im not trying to exaggerate, its seriously the best basketball you will ever watch. Period. Nothing comes close. The closest we ever came to since then was the Shaq and Kobe Lakers vs The Duncan, Parker, Ginobili San Antonio Spurs. But that still doesn't even come close, cuz Bird and Magic met in the finals in college and the NBA. Whenever they met or was all on the line. And both dominated their conferences with great teams. Even with freaking Kareem and James worthy and them boys on that team, Magic was Showtime! You watched cuz of Magic and what crazy shit you were gona see..."
Lonzo Ball vs Celts 35-pt blowout ?  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202001110BOS.html
RPM is utter garbage. Any stat that throws up as many nonsensical anomalies as that does isn't worth the paper it is written on. Can you honestly tell me Lonzo Ball is the 10th best player in the league? That Mike Conley is the 11th best and Devonte Graham rounds out the top 15? You need to reevaluate your methodology if that's what your metric is telling you...
"That‚Äôs just Sportscenter‚Äôs way of pushing the bullshit ‚ÄúSimmons is a better defender‚Äù narrative. It‚Äôs not true, of course, but if they show every unsuccessful block of Rudy‚Äôs while ignoring his highlight plays while also showing highlights of Simmons stripping a ball from Lonzo Ball (nevermind that he was blatantly fouling him while he was doing it) they can convince the dummies."
"Pelicans have a bad season, and it's probably not Zion fault. But Memphis don't had a All Star like Ingram was last year. Adams somehow got trashed by the media but he has a lot of experience and it's not worse than Valanciunas. Lonzo Ball has probably one of his best season and it's better than any other guard or forward on Memphis.    I mean Memphis somehow has done a really good job of making the most out of his players, but Pelicans should be able to fight them and they didn't."
"Will the trade talk you might say Lonzo Ball for the Pels, but lowkey I think it's Brandon Ingram. He's struggling to play with Zion, he's struggling in the clutch and he's struggling with defense."
I agree Rubio or honestly rondo would be perfect for this Celtics team   Even lonzo I think would be a good fit as a guy who can get brown and Tatum the ball
"I think the more relevant discussion is how much do you think Lonzo will continue to improve? People who think he will be a solid role-player, essentially like he is now just more consistent, would think he's overrated if others think he will ever be able to lead a team.   Watching Lonzo this season I haven't seen anything that shows me he will ever get back the role he had on the Lakers his rookie season. People who see potential in him seem to always be referencing his numbers and not his actual play. Like ""look he's shooting 40% from three and is scoring the ball better than ever"". But you can't overlook how he is getting his points. It's a direct result of the role he has on the Pels where he is a spot up shooter and sometimes a secondary/tertiary ball handler. His points are more often than not assisted on and according to nba.com  75% of his threes were either open or wide open.  The reality is he has too many holes in his game. And the skills he does have don't actually mesh together that well. He's a great passer, but if your thing is passing, being a poor ball handler is not great as it minimizes the time you have possession of the ball and thus your opportunities to find teammates. He can still wow with outlet passes which are great, but that's just not a huge contributing factor to being able to effectively run an offense. The only way he can effectively run an offense is as a PnR ball handler, where he is actually pretty good, but that's also not enough. His driving ability is quite meh, he can't drive and kick consistently, and he is a poor shooter off the dribble (he's working on a one-dribble stepback 3, but that's just an extension of his spot-up role, it's not going to make for consistent offense). He doesn't have the handles to do much more than dribble in isolation, meaning he can't probe into the defense. So outside of the PnR he would just give you terrible iso offence.   So if you think Lonzo will be running an offence again you are pretty much banking on the fact that he has these missing skills in his bag and for some reason just hasn't gotten the chance to show them on the court (actually he had a whole season), or that he will develop all these skills over the course of his career. Which could happen but it would take several seasons. I'm rooting for him to go to a team that wants to expand his role but I'm not optimistic that will happen.  Overall people who like Lonzo tend to be people who have not watched basketball closely or are new to it. They see a well known name and nice numbers and think that adds up to a star player. When people call Lonzo overrated it is in response to these people who are building unwarranted hype."
"Your consequences are off. If Boston loses in the first round, they're looking to dump Kemba. And if they're willing to give up the right swaps and take back Bledsoe (or get Lonzo in a S&amp;T), the Pelicans could be willing to play ball with their cap space."
Lonzo didn‚Äôt even do anything wrong he was the last Pelican to score off of a smart cut. He turned over the ball but that was cause dipshit Naji cut when he wasn‚Äôt supposed to. Then a t the end Bled was supposed to pass out to Zo3 for the game winner attempt but got swarmed and panicked with a dogshit pass to the center
"Lonzo ""Lose The"" Ball"
Lonzo Ball another good example of this. It's a pretty common idea. Scouts for college players usually look at free throw shooting as a bigger indicator of future shooting ability than just there 3 point shooting.
"FWIW Luka plays with Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Kleber, Finney-Smith and Richardson in the starting lineup, while LeBron plays with Schr√∂der and KCP (both guards) and Harden plays with Kyrie Irving an actual PG.   Porzi≈Üƒ£is, Kleber and Finney-Smith are all forwards/bigs and do not ever bring the ball up. Richardson is a guard/forward who can dribble here and there but is never asked to bring the ball up. It would be different if Luka was playing with Irving or Schr√∂der who are true guards. Luka brings the ball up every play, and guards opposing guards/wings. He is 100% our PG. Now if we were able to get a player like Paul, Ball, Holiday etc... it would be more of a debate, because he'd share ball handling duties offensively, but would not be guarding opposing guards, thus making him a point-forward.  I think that's the goal going forward, heliocentric offenses hardly ever work in the playoffs (see 05-10 Cavs or 13-18 Rockets). We need a secondary ball handler. Someone like Jrue Holiday, Lonzo Ball would be great to pair next to Luka."
The Lonzo Ball show
"They are going to decide whether they want to rebuild or win now this offseason by doing one of the following  1. Trade lavine/vucevic for draft picks/young players (possibly with golden state) 2. Trade Patrick Williams/Coby White for win now players and/or sign free agents such as Lonzo Ball.  Regardless, Art≈´ras Karni≈°ovas track record is pretty good considering how he helped the Denver Nuggests so I think questioning his moves this early in his tenure with the Bulls (aka thinking you know more than he does) is misguided at this point."
Lol at Lonzo and wade being better ball handlers
"I understand what you're saying. But the ""20ppg"" comment was simply conjecture. I was saying something simple and true, if he takes more shots he will score more points. More points will contribute to the production of his team. I'm not saying points are the most important thing. Ben is a 3 time allstar for a reason. I think he is a talented player and l think he has earned all of those spots and more.  Ben Simmons certainly does enough to win games, that's why Philly wins games. Two years ago they were a shot away from the ECF.   I agree shooting is vauble, I'm a shooter myself haha, but it is not so important that he should start settling or taking shots without proper practice. I'm not saying you're suggesting that, but many have. Ben has all of the physical tools to be a downhill scorer. He does not need a 3-point shot to be great now. I think he may become one in the future and l think it will be great for him.  Finding shooters is not that difficult, the 76ers have Tobias, Seth, Shake, and Green. Of course you need to put shooters to supplement him, but that isn't difficult to do. Teams do it for LeBron, Harden, Luka, and Giannis. They also do it for Ben. If you have the ball in your hands and you are a player that generates gravity then having shooters will relieve pressure. Ben is a master at relieving pressure.   I did say having a midrange shot will make him more of an immediate threat. I stand by that.   I think Ben has a rarer more vauble skill than shooting. Ben can make plays for his teammates. Plenty of times we've seen the best shooter in college/europe struggle to adjust to the NBA but guys who can handle/pass/create for others stick around do well. Rubio and Jimmer came into the NBA at the same time Rubio shot horribly and is still in the NBA today. Rondo, Ben Simmons, and Lonzo all can facilitate and of course there are other factors involved but it's obvious it's a big factor. You can't really teach IQ and Passing but one can become a great shooter. It is certainly easier.   The argument you made about the playoff is interesting. With that position players like Paul George, AD, Harden, and Lillard should be perfect for the playoffs. This statement isn't meant to be a redherring either l am genuinely curious why you think it is the case that their teams don't produce in the playoffs."
"Ben's is 2.33 and Trae's is 2.12 [Career]  This season: Ben 2.19,  Trae 2.26  So for season barely, but this is also his lowest ATO ratio season...  They are all close, but Ben also averages less TO per 36. Doesn't have the ball in his hands for his team. Statically has better ratio.   But my point with my original statement is Ben is one of the best passers in his age range.  Ben, Luka, Trae, Jokic, Ja, Lonzo, Fox, Lamelo etc. I think there are a few guys you can argue are the ""one of the best."" I did say l was being a bit hyperbolic."
"&gt;LeBron has been a point guard for literally every single year of his career and played the same way  up until 19-20 he always played with a better ball handler.  Lonzo, Kyrie, Wade, etc.  It wasn't until the lakers ran out with Lebron/Bradley/Green/AD/Javale that lebron was outright called a PG."
No it‚Äôs not. The heat are the perfect example. Wade and lebron both didn‚Äôt hve very scalable skill sets because they‚Äôre ball dominant and non elite shooters. Lebron and shooters on the cavs actually did better offensively during the regular season than lebron and wade sharing the floor. Lebron led bench lineups outperformed wade lebron lineups in Miami.   They didn‚Äôt add to each other‚Äôs games at all.   Compare that to Durant who joined the warriors and actually made them significantly better during the regular season when healthy they played at a 14 srs which was +4 over their +10 during their 73 win season.    Anthony Davis is another good example. Lakers with lebron lonzo Ingram hart etc were playing at a +1-+2. They lose virtually everyone but add Anthony Davis and all of a sudden play at a +6-+8 and are dominant. Davis synergizes extremely well with virtually any star because of his defensive presence and spacing and roll man abilities. That impact from Davis would rival any of the top 5 players and if anything it‚Äôs more impressive to take a team to that level than it is to take a twam from -3 to +3.   Now stacking as much talent is always important but it is important to look at which players are best at fitting with other stars. Westbrook is the most extreme example of being a terrible fit. Lebron is actually one of the lesser as well he‚Äôs just so good that it doesn‚Äôt matter. Durant Anthony Davis Steph are 3 of the best.
"&gt; &gt;1. **Re-Sign Lonzo Ball or let him walk?**   Let RFA play out. New Orleans has the upper hand in regards to holds. Work out a S&amp;T if the price looks to get to be too much.   &gt; &gt;2. **What to do with Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe?**   Move Bledsoe as salary ballast for a bigger move as MKE did, using actual assets to offset his poor value on the court. This is preferable this off season but could be pushed to trade deadline.   Adams is... Fine. At 17M he's not a value, but not crippling. Jaxson Hayes or a better acquired C can easily take his minutes as season goes on. Again, could be moved as salary ballast in off season or at the deadline.   &gt; &gt;3. **Keep coach Stan Van Gundy?**   SVG is going nowhere. He was brought in for long term development and stability. Considering the next to no off season and limited practice time this season, the individual development of young players has been fine. Team defense has actually improved as the season has gone on. He's likely not the answer for a contender, but he'll get at minimum one more year.   &gt; &gt;4. **What to do with Brandon Ingram?**   Ingram has already been paid. He is a big question long term if his defense doesn't improve, but they will give him at least another year unless the perfect fit alongside Zion becomes available. He fits well with the city of New Orleans and star level players actually wanting to be here should not be taken for granted. If he regresses in fit/defense this can and will be revisited next off season."
"It's got some pretty obvious flaws just looking at players on the same teams.   First example I see looking at the charts is Donte DiVicenzo has a 2.27 RPM. Jrue's is a little bit over him at 2.49 and Khris is just underneath him at 1.96. It's hard to imagine how Donte is even roughly as impactful as the other two players.   Devonte Graham is at a 3.72 vs Scary Terry's 2.77 and Ball is at 1.15 and Hayward is at 1.13. I don't think anyone would consider Graham as significantly more impactful than the other players.   Joe Harris ranks above Kyrie but the really baffling part is that Harris is a negative in offense by this metric and just blows Kyrie out of the water defensively while Kyrie is good on offense and just barely positive in defense.   Outside of the realm of teammates, you have some very big ones. Lonzo is the 9th most impactful player. Duncan Robinson rates as a better shooting guard than Lavine and Brown and Spyda. Danny Green and Kyle Anderson are the 5th and 6th best small forwards by this metric.   This whole spiel just to say that it's a wonky stat that isn't trustworthy"
"Lonzo is not a sole facilitator though. You can always expect him to make the right pass if the balls in his hands, and he won‚Äôt dominate the ball."
"Of course. A start would be signing Kawhi this off-season which is unlikely. Perhaps sign Lonzo as well. If done, they can give up a bunch of assets for KAT (Toppin, Robinson, 3 FRP?) I think that would make a super team  PG: Ball, Rose? SG: Barrett, Quickley SF: Leonard, ? PF: Randle, ? C: Towns, ?"
"Add Zubac. I'd love this team. If the Lakers got a competent coach at the same time (like Frank is, but idk if Frank is the best coach for this type of team), I think they could be a mid-level threat (5th-9th seed). Without a coach though I don't think they get past a ""Timberwolves"" level of underperforming.      Also, of course, butterfly effect. We don't know that any development as is today, is done if the Lakers all stayed together.      Also, thats A LOT of ball handlers. DLo, Randle, Ingram, Clarkson, and Lonzo(but also plays offball).      Not enough touches for their style."
"It's gonna be real interesting this summer. there's no bonafide superstars out there to throw a max at. do you give a player like Lonzo Ball a big contract and hope his growth this year continues, or sign guys to 1 year deals again, lock Randle up to an extension and then wait for 2022 when there's some bigger names out there"
"Well, when he was injured his team went 5-2 before Hayward got injured, with the only losses coming against Phoenix and Brooklyn. That's why I'm saying they might be better without him. (While when Lonzo got injured his rookie season it had a major negative impact on his team).  Lonzo is currently better, but you can make an argument Lamelo is better than Lonzo was as a rookie. Lamelo has two advantages over rookie Lonzo. 1) he is shooting much better than Lonzo did. That said, the comparison is not necessarily fair since people have been rooting *for* lamelo while everyone rooted against Lonzo. No player ever had to deal with the hate Lonzo had to deal with. 2) Lamelo is more aggressive going to the rim, which opens more options for his team. As a rookie, though, Lonzo was a better passer, rebounder, and defender.  Currently Lonzo is better both offensively and defensively. It's not even really close. Lonzo is shooting better from the field and the line (Lamelo gets to the line more, though he isn't exactly gang busters at that), is more efficient from the field in shot choice, and provides better passing (Lamelo averages more assists because he is played on ball more -- SVG plays lonzo off ball which seems like a mistake to me.) And while I don't think Lamelo is bad defensively, Lonzo is clearly better.  You could argue Lamelo could end up being better. That might happen, but if lonzo continues to play as he has been playing this year, he might not."
Lamelo is slow shooting compared to lonzo in his last year with the lakers. He would catch the ball from the ref at his waist and shoot it in one continuous movement
"Why? Why do we need to use this????  Honestly who cares? Besides analysts???  Like Chuck has always said, statistics have nothing to do with basketball and have no meaning   You put the ball in the hoop. It‚Äôs that simple   You can run numbers all day it doesn‚Äôt change anything or matter  You could run numbers on say, Lonzo, and show he‚Äôs sucked in this hypothetical playoff run according to TS% and other nonsense analytics   That doesn‚Äôt mean, he outta nowhere could drop 40 a game for the rest of the hypothetical playoff series   So what do these numbers matter? Besides looking back after decades and going ‚Äúoh wow john Stockton had a similar TS% as Cedric maxwell back in the 90‚Äôs, wow‚Äù ???  &gt;this is why we NEED to use TS+  Really? We NEED to use it?"
"Yea, it‚Äôs because when Zo is operating off the dribble he‚Äôs usually looking to pass/create for others. When he‚Äôs off ball he mostly spots up for 3‚Äôs or cuts. Whereas Ingram, while not a bad playmaker, is most effective when he creates a lot more shots for himself.   Zion and Lonzo are a lot more symbiotic."

Lonzo Ball texted Zion last night saying he will show up for today‚Äôs game against the Warriors and he apologizes for Monday‚Äôs game
Warriors wouldn‚Äôt trade Oubre Jr for Dinwiddie or Lonzo Ball  lmao im sorry i just cant üòÇü§£ü§£
"Curry brings it up the court, at the top of the key, Green coming in to screen his man and switch the big- oh what is this?! EXCELLENT DOUBLE TEAM FROM DRAYMOND AND LONZO, CURRY LOSES THE BALL, BAAANGGGGG, ANOTHER BRILLIANT SHOT FROM CURRY WITH THE WARRIOR'S PANTENTED BOX AND ONE OFFENSIVE SCHEME.  It's what Green does that doesn't show up in the stat sheets night after night that really matters Mike, you can see here in the slow mo replay, his excellent chemistry with Curry, predicting his exact dribble combo, lockdown defense, for an almost turnover resulting in the high percentage shot."
Lonzo Ball or Lonzo Fall every other night
He also turned the ball over towards the end there. Surpringly Lonzo hit a few 3s at the end to help clinch it. When this Warriors team is bricking 3s they look terrible.
Where were YOU when Lonzo Ball became the real Steph Curry with a 40-Inch Vertical?
Do you guys understand the magnitude of what just happened? The Pelicans are choosing Lonzo fucking Ball for their clutch FTs. Imagine that in his first two seasons in the league.
"we should all apologize to Lonzo Ball. sorry Lonzo, i love u"
"Lonzo ball sucks trade him before everyone realizes and his value drops, if it hasn‚Äôt already"
pretty terrible. Lonzo Ball and Norman Powell best players avaulable
A lot of fans want to add lonzo ball as a defensive and ball handling shooting threat. I like it. I want a PG with defensive skills that can space the floor and hit 3‚Äôs at a decent clip. We have Randle for playmaking and RJ sometimes too. We don‚Äôt necessarily need a PG that needs the ball in his hands.
It took Lonzo a few seconds to realize the ball wasn't there any more. That was smooth.

"Lonzo ""Hawkeye"" Ball"
**Zach LaVine**  He‚Äôs definitely gone after his contract is up. He can become a superstar in the future with his potential   Lonzo Ball this year even though he‚Äôs not a star
"He also called Lonzo the best player in the world, he doesn‚Äôt count. LaVar Ball is not a real person but a character meant to garner clicks and media attention"
"They have no defensive identity and they have no spacing. Zion is predictable to only score inside paint points. Same with bledsoe. ball and ingram have to be great every game for them to be competitive. neither are that good, especially Lonzo"
Lonzo 'Steph Curry' Ball
Lonzo ball is an embarrassment to the sport holy fuck
Fuck lonzo ball!! That motherfuker is one head case. Nothing wrong with his 3 or shot but man is there is something wrong with him.   The anger one feels !!
Kawhi Leonard and Lonzo Ball.
"I think lavine needs to cut the shit and be honest with his front office. If they can't sign at least lonzo ball then he has no reason to be in Chicago. The only reliable teammates he has are vucevic and thad young &amp; they are both on the wrong side of 30. If Lavine let's Chicago know ahead of time that he doesn't intend on re-signing, then they can at least get a couple firsts and a young guy for him. They should have at least tried to keep Wendell."
No you‚Äôre changing it. You originally said ‚ÄúLaker fans‚Äù over value their players. Now you‚Äôre just saying the Lakers themselves over value them.  I listed every player that was part of our young core because I wanted to show you how they developed. Part of valuing a young player is evaluating their future.   Lonzo Ball didn‚Äôt have the value to be the center piece for an AD trade but he was instrumental and a main piece of the trade. If he was good enough to straight up trade for AD then we don‚Äôt trade him because he would have been on a better contract. Come on man think.   You‚Äôre changing your whole tone. You said the Lakers under sold on their young guys for AD. So what would those guys get us if AD was over pay according to you. Stop running from the question and answer it
"Lonzo is a great fit, awesome D, encourages ball movement and good 3 point shooting. Can also take some playmaking responsibility from Randle if needed. Not a superstar though : )"
"Randle didn‚Äôt have value on the Lakers because Luke was a trash coach. In his last season with us he averaged 16/8/2 on 60 TS% and he was arguably our best defender. He had value but the front office fumbled the bag.   Russell was traded because the front office needed to unload Mozgov‚Äôs contract. Again, a product of the front office making a mistake and Russell had to pay for it. Magic also didn‚Äôt like him.   Lonzo Ball was an elite defensive player with upside on the offensive end and we traded him as one of the center pieces for AD. You‚Äôre completely wrong on Lonzo not having value.   We agree on Ingram having value.   Kuzma WAS a scorer, he‚Äôs a complimentary piece now who took a back seat to help the team and he‚Äôs still scoring well as a bench piece. 12 ppg on 54 TS% for a bench player is not bad at all. You‚Äôre wrong on Kuzma not only for saying he doesn‚Äôt have value but for saying he‚Äôs only a scorer. He‚Äôs a good rebounder and his defense has gotten better every year.   Clarkson has been viewed as an ineficiente scorer his whole career. But he still had enough value 53 TS% for a his career while being mainly a a spark plug off the bench and being a second round pick is not bad.   Nance is mot just some complimentary piece. He‚Äôs a player any team who is trying to win a championship would love to have. If he‚Äôs not an elite role player then he‚Äôs damn close to it.   Hart is replaceable but he‚Äôs a good piece to have  How did we over value them when they got us AD? Did the Celtics get AD with their young core? No. Did any other team get AD with their young core? No.   You completely over looked the reason on why or who they were traded for. The only real piece of the young core that left for nothing was Randle. And that was 100% on the front office. Russell was a by product of bad front office decisions. And Ingram and Lonzo got us AD. So how did they not have value?   But I‚Äôll ask once again since you refused to answer it for some reason, what fan base does not over value their teams young guys?"
"Randle walked for nothing and didn‚Äôt break out on the team he walked too. So he didn‚Äôt have value on the Lakers.  Russell was a 2nd overall pick that was traded 2 years into his career for a late 1st. He has also been not great and is the 2nd option on the 3rd worst team in the league with injury concerns.   Lonzo Ball was a 2nd overall pick that Lakers fans thought was going to be the future of the franchise  Ingram is a solid player, and the only reason the Lakers had a viable package for AD. He was worth a lot.   Kuzma is a scorer that can‚Äôt score that well  Clarkson wasn‚Äôt viewed as a good player until he got to Utah.   Nance and Hart are completely replaceable level talents.   Also I never said none of their players were good, just that Lakers fans overvalued their trade value.   Seeing as most of them required multiple teams in order to break out, or were traded for less value than they had on draft day kinda proves my point  And I think most fan bases overvalue their young guys. The difference is there are a ton of Laker fans, and they make hypothetical trades on this sub constantly."
"Oh you want to play this game ok. Let‚Äôs start off with Julius Randle, he‚Äôs averaging 24/10/6 on 46/42/80 splits and 57 TS% leading the knicks to the 4th seed currently.   D‚ÄôAngelo Russell is averaging 19/2/5 on 42/38/78 splits and 55 TS%. He‚Äôs been unhealthy this year but he‚Äôs been a good secondary star to KAT.   Brandon Ingram is averaging 24/5/5 on 46/38/87 splits and 58 TS%. He‚Äôs not a good defender but he‚Äôs a great offensive player on a young pelicans team.   Lonzo Ball is averaging 14/4/5 on 42/37/78 splits and 55 TS%. He‚Äôs been playing like an elite role player this year and last year. He‚Äôs been getting better every year so there‚Äôs no reason to doubt he won‚Äôt get better.   Kuzma is averaging 12/6/1 on 43/46/68 splits and  54 TS%. He‚Äôs clearly taking. Complimentary role since AD arrived and I love that he‚Äôs accepted his role. He went from a good scorer to a role player who tries to do a little of everything. He‚Äôs a good team player.   Jordan Clarkson is averaging 17/4/2 on 41/34/92 splits and 54 TS% and is a main part of one of the best teams in the league  Larry Nance and Jason Hart and really good role players as well.   This sub said Russell, Lonzo and Ingram were bust but they‚Äôve all turned out to be good players. Randle has even exceeded expectations and is playing phenomenal. Maybe we as fans of the team watch them play more and therefore we have a better understanding of how good a player can get.   You say Laker fans over value their young guys but show me a fan base who doesn‚Äôt."
Lonzo Ball please.
"&gt;If you can't take constructive criticism on how to format arguments properly  From someone who has not even attempted an argument.  Why on earth would I do that?  &gt;Your entire argument consists of ""You suck and I'm smarter than you"" as well as ""I have evidence, you're wrong.""   Actually, if you could read, which seems very much in doubt at this juncture, you would see that I posted my actual evidence very early on.  No one chose to comment on that evidence, particularly not you.  Instead, you chose pathetic ad hominem attacks, for the obvious reason that you have no counter argument at all.  &gt;Not a single person believes you because you don't actually respond.  I have responded to each and every comment.  None contained any arguments to speak of, but I took the time to respond anyway.  &gt;You're literally arguing against nobody when you say ""Nobody has provided evidence against my claim"" because nobody HAS to provide evidence.   When I have already provided evidence proving the point, then yes, you and anyone else questioning do precisely need to provide counter evidence, or, frankly, just be quiet.  &gt; You didn't actually respond to me.   You have not posted one word worthy of a response, and yet I'm wasting my time educating you.  &gt;You probably know ""I'm willing to bet"" is a phrase that isn't meant to be taken literally, I didn't actually mean that.   Don't hurt yourself backpedaling so fast.  Don't say things you don't mean, if you don't want to be called on them, and embarrassed.  &gt;My point was that if you reread what say, MazKhan said at the start, it debunks the point.   Pick better allies.  That person did not even know about the trades I specified.  They challenged me to find one such trade -- I posted two, and they ran away, embarrassed.  &gt; And if you REALLY so badly want me to debate you   Honestly, I'd prefer you just say ""Thank you"" and remain quiet.  &gt;unless you can without a shadow of a doubt prove that Brandon Ingram would have made that buzzer beater with the Lakers or gotten them that far without making any assumptions, then the AD trade was a success.   Utter nonsense.  You cannot prove that Ingram would not have had a bubble campaign just like Davis' or better.  Or Ball.  Or Hart.  Or Hunter.  Or Zubac.  Or more to the point, that the combination of those five, plus whatever the Lakers did with that future draft capital would not have won last year and left the Lakers in far better shape for the next decade.  There are precious few NBA players who are better than 5 good NBA players combined, and Davis has never shown himself to be one.  &gt;If you can't, it successfully proves that AD was a net positive, making that trade good.   It proves nothing of the sort.  &gt;I don't even need to reiterate the Knicks flair MCzebo33's point on how valuable AD was to the team.   And why did Davis win nothing in New Orleans if he's so good?  Why is New Orleans' winning percentage this season better than all but two of Davis' seasons there?  Even though New Orleans only received part of what Los Angeles traded for Davis, and hasn't gotten to execute any of the picks yet, they are already better without him.  &gt;The fact is, you CAN'T prove that Lonzo would have developed enough to make that shot, so you can't prove your case.   More nonsense.  Ball is a better shooter from three than Davis, so he's more likely to have made that shot.  So is Ingram.  Hell, I might be a better three-point shooter than Davis.  You're going to have to do much better if you hope to avoid embarrassment here.  &gt; Nobody cares if the Blazers traded away Moses and still won a ring but they lost the trade   If you don't care about the point, why are you wasting my time?  Just go remain ignorant and quiet in a corner somewhere.  &gt;It's about the Lakers and if they won the trade. You objectively cannot prove this, it is why nearly every single comment you've made has been downvoted.   Nothing can be proven to your ridiculous standard -- including your claim.  &gt; Your argument fundamentally doesn't work because you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that they could have had that success without any assumptions.   And you cannot prove that the Lakers would lose last year without Davis.  And you cannot prove that the Lakers would not win multiple titles with all those players and picks they traded away.  &gt;  Jimmy Butler trade hypotheticals don't work because you're assuming that the NBA landscape is the same then and the debate devolves into fanfiction.   See, this is another example of you talking out of your asshole on a topic you nothing about.    Butler was traded on July 6, 2019.  The exact same day Anthony Davis was.  Better luck next time."
"&gt;We win zero rings with lebron and BI and lonzo  You don't know that at all.  Even if you were right, the Lakers could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler with a mere fraction of the assets they spent on Davis.  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench wins easily."
"I think they could well be, though it‚Äôs double edged sword. It‚Äôs not like there are a bunch of no doubt, max contract guys who will be unrestricted next year. You‚Äôre looking at throwing a big deal at Lonzo Ball or something, which might be a good idea but it‚Äôs not without downside risk."
"if a Ball is starting its def Lonzo on this team, but LaMelo would be a 6MOTY contender"
"Lol wtf.  Steph and Giannis alone is crazy, add Jrue, Lamelo/Lonzo and either Brook or Marcus/Markieff as a small ball center for the starting lineup + a good bench is easily championship contender."
Lonzo Ball with this historical and inspiring message  https://youtu.be/pr98y20xFng
Ben Simmons is already getting shit on for being more useless than Lonzo Ball on offense. You want us to shit on them more?
"Is he? Hes got the power and hustle, or used to have the hustle, but he was always kind of a bad attitude to me which seem to be supported by the fact his team won the world series their first year without him.. similar to how the 76ers would definitely have won this series with a number of any serviceable point guards... Say a Ricky Rubio or Lonzo would have worked.   And going back to the attitude thing I'm not aware of Simmons having any reputation as a bad teammate although I think him not being the hardest worker is kind of obvious at this point.  But I'd imagine mentally that your teammates would have a different way in approaching their game when they can comfortably pass the ball to you when you're wide open and trust you to take a shot."
Ben Simmons is just a tall Lonzo Ball.
"&gt; On offense he‚Äôs probably best just being Draymond and pushing in transition when he can.  Except that Draymond can actually do things in half-court offense, like playmake, screen, and even shoot.  Simmons' only offensive value is in transition.  In the half-court his contribution consists of (1) dribble the ball up, (2) pass to the primary initiator, (3) go stand off to the side.  I still don't understand why he's labelled a PG.  He's like a taller Lonzo, except with better defense and worse shooting."
He's also a free agent looking for a big contract.  Lonzo and Embid would be such a nasty combo. Look at Lonzo and Zion already.   Pelicans have already made it clear Ingram is their poster child after Zion. Pelicans have too many cooks and Lonzo would do well with the 76ers.    I'd honestly like to see LiAngelo Ball play off the bench there at the 3. He made mistakes as a kid but the kid really could shoot. Dude is a walking bucket. If Jimmer gets a 10 day contract LiAngelo deserves one.
All these Bulls fans want Lonzo ball and I‚Äôm over here wanting Reggie Jackson
Might as well and grab Lonzo Ball in free agency. Embid would absolutely feast with Lonzo running point.
"2017 went Fultz, Ball, Tatum. Markelle was the undisputed number one pick so that was a foregone conclusion, Lakers wanted lonzo and lonzo only wanted to be in la so again that was forgone. Philly had #3, they traded with Boston to go up to get Fultz with #1. Have they stayed where they were they would have had embiid, Simmons and Tatum right now and would be straight up wrecking everyone not named the Nets"
"To be fair to Rookie Lonzo Ball, he at least attempted 3s unlike Ben Simmons."
It's wild to think Lonzo Ball completely changed his trash ass shot meanwhile Ben Simmons still not showing any willingness to improve years after years
"The 76ers had back-to-back #1 picks, and they wasted them on Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  In 2016, Simmons was picked ahead of Brandon Ingram (#2) and Jaylen Brown (#3)  In 2017, Fultz was picked ahead of Lonzo Ball (#2) and Jayson Tatum (#3)  Which goes to show how successful the Celtics have been with those two drafts"
"same, but for lonzo ball...  ...oh wait."
Even Lonzo Ball figured it out at the line.
"Mix of the worst of LeBron, Magic and Rookie Lonzo Ball."
I honestly think Lonzo Ball will eventually end up as a better player than Ben Simmons. Simply because one is constantly working hard and seeking for improvement and the other just don't show any desire to improve
lonzo ball is actually a serviceable scorer now
6'11 Lonzo Ball with horrible facial hair
hawks should sign lonzo ball
Klay Thompson's injury caused the Warriors to miss the playoffs   Lonzo Ball and Gordon Hayward injuries probably caused the Hornets to miss the playoffs   Celtics had Brown injured      This year has just been crazy.
Whatever happened to Lonzo Bust Ball??
So did Lonzo Ball
Shoutout to Lavar Ball! I need a Ball Brother Backcourt. Sign with the Hornets Lonzo. Don't be a bitch. I need Lavar telling Michael Jordan his sons would kick his ass during January games.
Enter lonzo ball
Maybe if he added a couple of knockdown shooters like Eric Bledsoe or Lonzo Ball in the backcourt
"This team on talent alone should be an 8th seed/play-in *at worst.*  They were super slow despite having the beat up tempo combo in the league potentially with Zion and Lonzo. They constantly blew big leads, SVG didn‚Äôt know how to properly utilize his personnel (seriously, *Lonzo Ball* as a perimeter wing? Seriously?) and they completely whiffed this season despite being *relatively* healthy.  He was a bad choice to begin with."
Zion gives next to no effort on defense and Adams is not a guy that elevates your defense. Bledsoe and Lonzo also have redundant skill sets in pressuring the ball handler so your only 2 positives are diminished.   With absolutely no spacing the pelicans had a great offense in the second half once they made zion the initiator in the PnR.   We have no idea how good Stan is at this point because the roster was genuinely terrible.
Doesn't matter how badly constructed the roster is you can't have Zion Lonzo ball and Ingram in your team and not be one of the leading teams in pace
"Stan didn‚Äôt do a great job with them this season, zion had to play with negative spacing and Lonzo ball couldn‚Äôt find a comfortable role. To me the biggest negative here is exposing the young players to too many coaching changes. Zion for example is on his third coach in his third year, and in the worst case scenario this could affect their development."
Mmm yes such a fan favorite that he got less fan votes for the All-Star game the season before last than Lonzo Ball üòÇ
r/NBA is gonna be stupid for the rest of week and keep calling Giannis a bum aren‚Äôt they?  I can‚Äôt wait for the the posts asking if the Bucks should think about trading Giannis for Lonzo Ball or some shit üôÑ
"I mean they literally just won an NBA championship because of their location. What other team could suck ass for 7 years, have a team consisting of Brandon ingram and lonzo ball, and be an attractive destination for lebron James"
Imagine a lineup of Lonzo/Bledsoe/Simmons/Zion/Adams lmfao   &gt;Ingram denying the ball to Embid would be a double whammy  Ingram averages 24 ppg and 5 apg.
Lonzo Ball. LA isn't that close to Chino Hills but close enough
Derrick Rose or Lonzo Ball...
"I don't think his handle is that broken. He's not Lonzo who I think is literally a handle away from being a great offensive player, because he would finally be able to run a half court offense/drive and kick/etc as he has all the other skills.  I do agree with his decision making. His mindset is rarely to ever attack. When Embiid was off last night someone else should have been calling for the ball. I know that's hard, but you're meant to be his costars(Tobias and simmons), someone has to take the load rather than just have Embiid feel the need to keep pressing(I'm by no means trying to remove blame from Embiid either, he should have looked to pass more and get his role players to get shots up)."
I used to joke that people calling him the next Lebron were way off and his ceiling is more like a Super Saiyan Lonzo Ball.  But then Lonzo Ball started making his 3's.
That Lonzo ball is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vert.
"Lonzo is flat out better in the halfcourt setting. He can play off ball and has become a good shooter. Ben can‚Äôt play off ball for shit cause you know he ain‚Äôt shooting unless it‚Äôs a wide open layup, lob, or dunk."
"I mean his defense has definitely improved, his defense was awful at LSU and was not great his rookie year either. But I agree, it's amazing he's been in the league for what, 4 years? And he still hasn't been able to develop even a semblance of a jump shot? Don't the sixers have shooting coaches that are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to work with their players on shooting? Hell, even Lonzo shot 38% from 3 this year and he had one of the ugliest jump shots I've ever seen coming into the league. Ben's shooting stroke doesn't even look too bad either. I have no idea why Ben can't make any progress shooting the ball. Must be some kind of mental block or something."
"And this is an extension of that. Intentional fouling a poor free throw shooter is the same as leaving a bad 3pt shooter open.   Does it suck to watch? Yea absolutely but I want my team to win. If your team rolls out a 40% free throw shooter, put him on the line all night I don‚Äôt care.   Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Shaq. They all have every resource available to them to become a 60 percent FT shooter, they need to take advantage of them."
"Yeah I get what you mean. The only good true PG on the market is Lowry, however it seems like he wants to go to a contender. Lonzo gives us another ball-handler, shooting, and pretty good defense. I think that helps us get into the playoffs."
"&gt;My bet is on Lonzo Ball. He just too inconsistent to be your number 1/2 option on a winning team.   Nobody, including whatever team signs him, thinks this. I don't even know if anyone thinks he's a good third option. What he is a good playmaker and decent defender who is ideally your 4th or 5th best scoring option on the floor."
It‚Äôs easier to get Lonzo ball then a better quality wing than jaylen brown.
"&gt;No, winning a championship is an automatic success.  No.  Simply put, you are one-hundred percent wrong.  A team can lose a trade -- badly -- and still win a title in the same season.  Not only has been done, but the Lakers have done it in the past.  That you are ignorant of basic basketball history does not bode well for you in this conversation.  &gt;A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  They are the Lakers, a championship is always in sight.  &gt;You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core.  And you're forgetting that we are talking about LeBron James -- who had already won with lesser teams.  &gt;Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers.  You don't know that at all.  Maybe he learns from James and is even better.  &gt; We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless.  Yes, they would have.  They traded Zubac to make financial room for Davis.  &gt;No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even.  Green would've been on the bench anyway, behind better players.  Howard, too.  There's also no guarantee better players don't sign with the Lakers, seeing an opportunity that didn't exist alongside Davis.  &gt;They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster.   They didn't even play the Clippers.  What the hell are you talking about?  Please learn thing one about the topic at hand.  &gt;Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season).   Ingram and Ball both would've been the best shooters on that team from the arc -- with obvious benefits to all of their teammates including James.  &gt;Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity.   Their defense would not have been as good -- but their offense and bench would've been miles better.  Ingram alone replaces Davis' offensive production.  Zubac is much better than McGee and Howard, and Ball is miles better than Green.  &gt;Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season  Inconsistent?  Like Davis, you mean?  Who took to firing up threes at 33% last year, and 26% this season?  &gt;2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option)  Two or even three players does not make a team.  That Cleveland team featured Irving shooting 32% from three that season, and Love at 36%.  Neither played a lick of defense.  They were playing Matthew Dellevedova half of each game, and Mozgov started more than half of their games.  You need to do much better getting simple facts correct, before you move on to theories.  &gt;, they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's  See above regarding Cleveland's shooting.  And again, Ball and Ingram last year would've been the two best shooters on that Laker roster, so you are talking utter nonsense here.  &gt;3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram wouldn't have been against contenders).  You've no way to know that, but even if so, they could've had Jimmy Butler for a pittance, compared to what they blew to rent Davis -- as I already mentioned.  &gt;I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety.  Should not take long, since the relevant players rarely played together.  It's almost like that may have mattered?  &gt;The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.  Clearly the answer is, ""Far better than you do"".  &gt;It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season.  It precisely does work like that.  NBA players in the bubble were as-rested as any of them will be, until they retire.  That six-month vacation -- with almost no organized basketball available -- was for most, the only time in their lives between about the ages of about 10 and 35 where they will be healthy, and not balling.  There is absolutely no reason that any of them should have been worn out after playing at-most 29 games.  Any that were worn-out can not handle a full NBA season -- which has been the case throughout Davis' career.  &gt; Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  Sounds like we're talking about an injury-prone player, and maybe one you don't want to trade 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap for.  &gt;The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.  Davis has played over 68 games only twice so far in his career, and never more than 75.  &gt;If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't.   Look, if you cannot do simple arithmetic, discontinue wasting my time.  5 Championships in 20 years is exactly 2.5 per decade.  &gt;Even if the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting.  Look, learn thing one about the topic, or again, discontinue this nonsense.  Butler was not in Minnesota.  You are embarrassing yourself here.  &gt;No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries.   Davis suffering an injury is not a freak occurrence.  The freak occurrence was 2020 when he didn't.  &gt;Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  This is so fantastically ignorant that I'm almost speechless.  The Lakers don't win one title and call it a day.  Other franchises would love to, but the Lakers' standard is miles higher than that.  They fired a GM who won 5 rings for them, which is unprecedented ( and probably a mistake ).  &gt;Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  Again, these are the risks one has to take in order to build through free-agency.  I'm sure I just explained this, so I don't know why you couldn't read it.  This is precisely also the problem with spending a decade of draft assets to rent Davis -- it will force the Lakers to take more risks of this nature, and some will backfire like the Deng contract did.  &gt;Only if you have other options. Which they didn't.  For the final time, learn thing one about the topic at hand.  Jimmy Butler was traded the very same day, for almost nothing.  One additional point.  Learn how to use reddit.  One does not copy unrelated comments into one gigantic pile.  If you cannot even figure that out, once again, please discontinue here.  Respond in the appropriate threads."
"&gt;It might be. We won't really know for a decade or so, when we know more about how much, exactly, they gave up to rent one player for one season.  No, winning a championship is an automatic success. Davis could've walked away in free agency after the chip and it still would've been worth it. A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  &gt;The Lakers quite likely would've won last year even without overpaying for Davis... James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year  You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core. Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers. We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless. No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even. They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster. Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season). Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity. Not having LeBron as the PG also gives him more offensive responsibilities and leaves even lesser energy for defense than normal. I could go on. The Davis signing was such a catalyst for so many of that 2020 team's success.  &gt;You're wrong.  No, they were right.   &gt;James has won with less.  No, he hasn't. 2012-13 Mia and 2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option), they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's, that 18-19 squad was awful with the 3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram _wouldn't_ have been against contenders).  &gt;I invite you to research the above statements before replying. If necessary, search my comment history, as I've covered these topics repeatedly for other similarly-uninformed people.  I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety. The claim that they would've been contenders with a high chance of winning with your suggested roster is absolute hogwash and uninformed; it _absolutely_ ignores the fundamental issues they had that season. The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.   &gt; And while the offseason was short, it was preceded 29 games earlier by a six-month vacation  It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season. Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  &gt;""Dude"" has been injured almost every season.   The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.   &gt;The point which just zoomed over your head is that if you trade every young player because they haven't accomplished anything yet, you will be sorry.  You *might be sorry. Good thing they won though.  &gt;More to the point, even before 2020, they were exactly on their historic pace of 2.5 Rings per decade in this century. So, you are talking absolute nonsense.  If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't. At all. But now with him, they have a real chance to achieve that 2.5 average. Good on them.  &gt;Not only that, but they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020. In this case, the Lakers retain substantially all of the assets they spent to rent Davis.  Even _if_ the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting. Zubac wouldn't have been there, either.  &gt; It already looks very questionable, and can only get worse. Some of those first-round picks are still years away -- exactly when the Lakers will need them, by the way.  No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries. Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  &gt;And a questionable motor, to boot.  Not really. I hope you're not basing that on this injury-riddled year and post-season lol. Cause that would be too ridiculous. Even with the post-season he was getting back to his dominant self in games 2 and 3.  &gt;That said, Deng was a 31 year-old 2-time All-star. 4 x $16m was not at all outrageous.   Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  &gt;that's probably too much to spend for one ring.  Only if you have other options. Which they didn't. That roster you that claimed would be a favorited contender (that was supposedly even better than some of James' past championship teams) is nonsense. You could literally do a multi-part video series on how they'd be picked apart by the other contenders in the playoffs."
"&gt;There are guys making that much or a couple mil more that you'd easily rather have.  Only one veteran player averaged more assists than Schroder, and made less this past season.  Ballhandling and playmaking is arguably the most in-demand skill in the NBA.  Lots of players can shoot, and lots can rebound.  Only a few can create shots for themselves and others, and those players tend to be handsomely rewarded.  The only veterans who averaged 5+ assists and made under $20m last season were; Schroder, Lonzo Ball, TJ McConnell, Ricky Rubio, and Dejounte Murray.  &gt;I bet he gets something more like Dejounte Murray.  Murray is an even worse shooter than Schroder, and had nothing remotely resembling Schroder's resume when he signed that contract.  Murray is not even a comparable.  At the time Murray signed that deal, his career high was 8.1 ppg.  And he still got 4 x $16m."
You guys remember when Magic picked Lonzo Ball over Jason Tatum De'Aaron fox &amp; Donovan Mitchell... smh Gotta call that out
"Sign and trade Lonzo and Kyle.  Makes too much sense for NOLA and Toronto.  They're fools if they don't do it.  2 year deal for Kyle at 20-30, longer term deal for Lonzo.  Nola gets a strong championship level defensive PG who doesn't need the ball and the raptors get a promising guard who can feed siakam and OG the ball.   Kyles fit in Dallas would be interesting but I'm not sure if it's the right decision spacing wise.  I don't know why either party would want it tbh"
Mip  1.Ant(Anfernee)   2. Poole  3. MPJ  Lip  1. Lonzo Ball(Sorry)  2. James Wiseman  3. Green (Sorry)
"I watch them all the time and their lack of intensity is infuriating. Only dudes on the team who play with fire are Hart and occasionally Zion. Not saying this person needs to be a star, but they need somebody on this team who will light a fire under some asses, including Zion's.  I was excited when I heard about the Adams signing, and I really like Adams, but it was quickly apparent that wasn't working. Bledsoe was a huge downgrade from Holiday. Lonzo isn't worth nearly as much as he'll get paid. Although I hope they keep Hart, they need to bring in a couple of consistent perimeter scorers. That's not Ball, Bledsoe or Hart.  If they can upgrade their perimeter offense and defense, they're not that far from being a playoff team. But I'm afraid that they're gonna spoil their Zion window by sinking too much money into people who don't let them optimize his abilities."
"Lonzo is a better role player than DLo. If DLo is leading your team, sure he'll get you 20 but your offense is going to be average and your defense is going to be bad. If you don't have DLo leading your team, your defense will still be bad and DLo's offensive contributions off-ball are roughly equivalent to Lonzo's.   Basically, while DLo can play a bigger role, he can't play that to a high enough level to be part of a dangerous playoff team, while Lonzo can play his more limited role even on better teams thanks to his defense."
You know nothing about the fan base or basketball really. I can't expect a team that drafted Lonzo Ball over Tatum to know what a good GM is. Good luck missing the playoffs again after LeBron's contract expires. You traded your whole future away for AD. I bet you think you guys are getting Lillard too.
"And you have to look at their ceilings. Lonzo doesn't offer anything amazing, but he's turning out to be a solid PG and floor raiser. Ive become more of a fan of his style.   Dlo has a much higher ceiling. He has a silky shot, fantastic arc, great release point. He drove to the lane a lot more this year and improved on drawing fouls. He still got caught up in hero ball mode, but that changed with a different coach and more healthy talent around him.   I wouldn't be shocked to see Dlo averaging 25-30 ppg within the next 3 seasons. Even with his subpar defense, that's more valuable than Lonzo, imo."
"Funny thing is we all wanted Lonzo to be the PG so DLo can go off ball and play SG and it turns out if they played together today, it‚Äôs the opposite haha."
"Good shooter, ball handler, can create his own offense. Lonzo has literally never made the playoffs while DLo was the best player on a team that made one??? The wolves went from looking incompetent to an actual Bball team when DLo came back from injury this year. I love both guys but you‚Äôre just a clown for this take dawg."
What are you talking about? This is the same man that pushed rookie Lonzo Ball to the ground and proceeded to stand over him like 3 years ago. He's a dog.
Lonzo Ball          Just kidding it‚Äôs lebozo
"Clarkson going off, love it.  Crazy to think of the Laker's 07 Roster. (I know they got AD for some of these pieces but still)  Lonzo Ball: Max potentially incoming Alex Caruso Josh Hart Brandom Ingram: Max Contract Larry Nance Julius Randle: MIP Jordan Clarkson: 6MOY"
clippers should sign lonzo ball
Lonzo ball
Bruh he bailed on this squad lmao. He literally left Lebron and folk hanging 2 years ago. Why you acting like what he did 40 years ago affected the signing of Dennis Schroeder? Dude literally could've kept Lonzo or Ingram instead of Ball if he made the trade Lebron's first year.
Kemba for Lonzo Ball
"&gt; I don‚Äôt disagree, but I think it‚Äôs wild to assume this off of one year      It's not just one year though. He played the exact same very low usage role both seasons in college even when he clearly had the brightest future long term.         &gt; He‚Äôs already shown to be a qualified starter on a playoff team imo.      I'd probably say that's a bit of a stretch as a rookie though I don't think he's very far off. Again though, just because he is a good young player does not mean he is a serious building block. I think he'd be a lot more helpful long term to a competitive team than a perennial lottery team.       In a lot of ways he reminds me of Lonzo (without the lofty salary expectations of being the #2 pick). Really high IQ player who can move the ball without needing a bunch of P&amp;R run for him and he can spot up shoot well. Solid defenders as well.    But for both of them the handle is just not there at all for PG standards. And while they can spot up shoot, the shot form makes it very difficult to shoot off the dribble. The on-ball shot creation is just a major struggle."
"The Bulls really want to acquire a top point guard.  Whether they can or not is another matter.  There would have to be a trade involved and they have limited assets.  But they surprised people when they traded for Vucevic.    Vucevic, LaVine, and, say, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, or Chris Paul doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the Bulls an instant title contender, but it would go a long way towards making the Bulls a legitimate playoff team.  If they get Lowry or Paul the hope would be that the aging superstar mentors Coby White."
"John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby, Jonathan Isaac, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Derrick White, and if you're feeling generous, Markkanen, Kuzma, Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, and Malik Monk. Oh and Dillon Brooks and Monte Morris in the 2nd round."
your team is not going anywhere except early round exits with lonzo ball as your starting pg.
Lonzo ball
Every time I think of summer league I think of Lonzo Ball selling out every game
Lonzo Ball is a really good shooter
He is like a really big Lonzo Ball
It's funny that 76ers fans think they have a chance against the Nets with Joel EmFoulMerchant and Australian Lonzo Ball leading them
Bum Simmons came to play today üî•üî•  4 points üò§  2 turnovers üòàüòà  3 rebounds üí™üí™üí™  Clamped by Kevin Huerter ü§£ü§£  Literally just an Australian Lonzo Ball on a max contract üòπ
He could be a good fit with Lonzo Ball.
"With all that's happened though, I don't think we would win a Championship and get past kawhi unless we had Tatum, in full hindsight, even if Fultz wasn't injured. He's a big scoring threat, but we'd probably rely hard on Embiid's inside game and Ben's playmaking too much for Fultz to be effective. Brett Brown did have a scheme where it was just not good for ball handlers other than Ben Simmons.  Plus if we got Lonzo, I don't know if we'd trade him since it's a toss up. Since he's a pretty good defender, I'm not sure we'd be picking people like Tisse in the draft."
Lonzo Ball in 2018
Lonzo Ball
"He could be the number one guys, but he would need a technical leader with him as his number 2/1.5  a guys like Chris Paul or Jokic or something like that. Somebody that oozes basketball and IQ.  I think a 2 year down the line completely matured Lonzo ball might become that kind of player (to a lesser extent ofc)"
I'd take Lonzo st the right price but also id presume the pels would match such a contract. If he leaves I think someone overpays and I'd rather not be that team.    Lonzo is more of a switchable 3 and D off ball player with plus passing atm as opposed to a legitimate point guard in alot of ways. Thats still a nice player but I'd rather allocate my assets elsewhere. And--- we'd still need a poojt guard.
"Lonzo isn‚Äôt really a half court playmaker. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô6 with a 40 in vert, but he doesn‚Äôt really have reliable dribble package, and is ultimately bad around the rim.  Lonzo is a big 3&amp;D guard, that as a bonus can facilitate really well in transition. But to be a half court facilitator in this era you have to be a threat to score the ball off the dribble at all 3 levels. He isn‚Äôt.  But he‚Äôs a good fit on every team really. He still can and will improve, and even if he doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs a super elite role player today."
"I‚Äôd like to see it happen. I wanna see Lonzo leave NOLA although I think he‚Äôs perfect for them. I‚Äôm just really curious to see if he can thrive as a primary ball handler and be more of a scorer if a team hands him the keys. I don‚Äôt wanna see him just shoot 3s.  I think there‚Äôs an alternate reality where Lonzo doesn‚Äôt continuously get hurt, keeps his confidence, gets drafted to a smaller market team, and becomes a star"
"Lonzo is not a good half court passer. So no, Luka would not have to give the ball up and run an offense as an offball player."
I don't think he's the most disrespected in the league. Lonzo was unbelievably overhyped as a rookie and is currently getting outplayed by his rookie brother. Lonzo isn't great as a finisher and will go ice cold as a shooter all the time. He's not a bad player but he's still nowhere near where people think he is because of the dumb Ball hype
Lonzo fits well with good frontcourts not a great pair for a ball dominate star imo
"Rudy Gobert is 9th in win shares, apparently harden didn't even appear in one of your stats, and lonzo ball is 10th in box plus minus. Players that had good seasons have had low bpm. You can list all the advanced stats you want but they're flawed one way or another. Harden is one of the best floor generals in the league, locked in on d this playoffs, and the 2nd best scorer in the league. We've seen him carry trash teams to the playoffs with his historic combination of scoring and playmaking, if curry is better in every single way, like the stats say, he couldn't make it to the playoffs with a #5 defense around him?"
"Mavs could high key use a guy like lonzo, secondary ball handler with size, good iq and a 40% 3 pt shooter now, lonzo is hot and a lot of teams are probably looking at him going into this off season"
"IMO THJ isn‚Äôt a playmaker, he‚Äôs a scorer. He‚Äôs not looking to get others involved, just looking for his own shot and to score. It‚Äôs definitely needed too on that team, but Luka also needs more of a secondary ball handler/facilitator. Just looking at upcoming free agents, maybe someone like a Dinwiddie or Lonzo"
"It's a reference to a YouTube vid that called Lonzo Ball ""Steph Curry with a 40 inch vert"""
"Richuan Holmes. John Collins. Lonzo Ball. Doug McDermott.       Probably lose THJ to free agency, but would love to have him back.      Trade Zingis for... Wiggins?"
Coaching is fine it‚Äôs the guys on the roster   Really they just need a second guy for Luka to play with or if they have space I think a lonzo ball would be perfect for Dallas
"I think the mavs need to get a second ball handler for Luka, Lonzo would be ideal for at least a playmaker"
"Embiid needs to leave, it's been made known they aren't willing to build around him. Could have gotten harden but kept 6'9"" lonzo ball who cant shoot"
"Lonzo is a 2, through and through. This is the Jrue Holiday situation all over again. A guy who is enormously better off the ball, a great secondary playmaker who can take over some ball handling duties but not run the entire offense while getting to focus more on the defensive end.   But everyone is still so stuck in those old school mindsets of ‚Äúonce a player plays a certain position they‚Äôre that position for life‚Äù."
Lonzo Ball  Kyle Lowry  Devonte Graham  John Wall (trade)  Kemba Walker (trade)  POSSIBLY Russell Westbrook (trade)  POSSIBLY Damian Lillard (trade)  POSSIBLY Derrick Rose (free agency)
Seems that guys like lonzo ball do just fine by ignoring it.
"Yea I do feel like that works against Kuzma seeing the success of all those guys but one problem is ppl always assume that the Lakers chose to keep Kuzma over Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, when in fact the Pelicans trade and salaries was only going to work with Ball and Ingram anyways!"
"I think one problem is ppl always assume that the Lakers chose to keep Kuzma over Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, when in fact the Pelicans trade and salaries was only going to work with Ball and Ingram anyways!"
"Letting Oubre walk makes the most logical sense to me given the front offices actions last season. Because if we really left the Lonzo ball trade offer on the table for the ability to pay Oubre more money, then I really don't know what Myers is doing."
"yup. tons of people are a better fit at a lesser price. shit even Lonzo would be a cheaper contract and fits better with Lebron. don't need a hero-ball ""me first"" guy on a team like this, won't last"
"Says the legit legend, but still he drafted Lonzo Ball"
"Lonzo Ball prob best bet.  he plays defense, can make plays and is young."
"Ignore the stats for a second.    A 6'1 SG, who is horrible defensively, cannot playmake at all, and is due for a max contract. He cannot play PG, so you need a a PG next to him. Your PG can't be another small guard, so you'd need a bigger one like Lonzo Ball or Ben Simmons or something.     He's an extremely limited player who only does 1 thing at a high level (scoring a lot of points on average efficiency). He's also hard to fit into a lineup because of his size and the aforementioned limitations.    He's definitely a solid player. He's also definitely not worth a max contract.   In my eyes he's best suited to being a 6th man off the bench. Could rack up some 6MOTY selections that way and chuck as many shots as he wants without being asked to be a playmaker."
"Not too late for them to get in on Dame either. And in both the Harden or Dame sweepstakes I wouldve/am still willing to offer Ingram.   There was just a level of [delusion back then](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/12/17/22178792/james-harden-trades-proposals-76ers-celtics-raptors-blazers-heat) with these Harden trade ideas that even for homer fans standards was absurd.   &gt;Framework of the deal: Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker + 3-4 first round picks to Houston for Harden.  And the Pelicans writer said no in response to this offer!   Heres another one   &gt;Framework of the deal: C.J. McCollum and Zach Collins + a couple first round picks to Houston for Harden.  &gt;""Giving up CJ McCollum, Zach Collins, and picks is a big ask from Portland‚Äôs perspective. As things stand, I wouldn‚Äôt give up a single player from the roster in exchange for Harden, let alone two key players and two first round picks""  Do people even hear themselves when they talk, this was an actual sentence someone said like 6 months ago."
Lonzo Ball. Go compare his numbers to 4th year Steve Nash.
Two options (I think):  Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball (if they both sign to similarly valued contracts)  Let Lonzo Ball walk and try and dump Bledsoe
"He‚Äôs been playing that exact role his entire career just with different players playing the Zion role. Reason being is that he can‚Äôt create or drive. The only reason he‚Äôs worth the 15-18 million is because he fixed his shot enough to be average/middling so his good defense and low maintenance offense (run fast break, pass the ball off, never call for it again and shoot 7-8 spot up 3s) are great assets. If he doesn‚Äôt seriously overhaul his handles and finishing the version of Lonzo we‚Äôve gotten the last 3 years is the same one we‚Äôre getting the next 10. 25 mil is a lot for that."
Hope we can get Lonzo Ball. I would love him on the Mavs.
for meme purposes only: lonzo ball with lonzo's old shooting form and jj reddick's actual shooting ability.
That's why I think Lonzo and Lamelo are quite close right now in on court production. Obviously Lamelo has a much higher ceiling but I think teams with a ball dominant PnR star would much rather Lonzo than Lamelo
"3 1st picks that all led to generational talents. 2/3 got traded and I expect the 3rd to be on his way out soon considering the Williamson family is silently acting like Lavar Ball. The most cheering you do is for players you trade away.    You're trying to replace Lonzo Ball with Chris Paul/Spencer Dinwiddie/Kyle Lowry who are not coming to NOLA. Considering the overlap of Saints fans, I'm surprised that Pelican fans talk about their franchise like they have any hope. Your offense has no shooters and your defensive effort is pitiful at best. It should've been a big red flag the moment we traded you the 4th pick, and you somehow turned it into Jaxon Hayes and then go out and sign Adams to an absurd extension the following year."
what works the hornets want Lonzo ball for though
Like taking lonzo ball over Tatum oh wait that was another team
"An exchange of Paul and Lonzo. It could be a double S&amp;T, it could be S&amp;T Lonzo for Paul on the player option (with an cheaper extension in ink before the plane lands to frontload the money). Ball is expressed interest in Phoenix, and Paul gets to team up with some familiar faces."
it's not even going small ball either. Lonzo is about 6'6 and Lamelo around 6'7
With the right coaching and his size he could move over and play the small forward. And yes. His shooting has gotten better. But that's because the scouting report on him has been that he's a below average shooter. We have yet to see how he can handle real defense on his shooting in the playoffs. Shooting guards tend to be shooters. Or pure shooters. Lonzo Ball is not a starting shooting guard on a contending team. Go down the list of playoff teams and name one that would prefer Lonzo as their shooting guard.
Up to date power rankings of all the Balls.  1) LaMelo Ball  2) Lonzo Ball  3) Basketball  4) LiAngelo Ball
All I want for off-season Christmas is Lonzo Ball.
"Yeah, I guess I'm not counting anything from the draft yet because admittedly I haven't paid as much attention to it this year. Personally, would you rather have Lonzo or GTJ? Lonzo is a better ball handler so I guess by default a better secondary option in the halfcourt but I imagine GTJ is a lot cheaper for a similar enough skillset."
"Yes, the fact that Lowry is a much better player than Lonzo Ball"
So you‚Äôre willing to pay a 35 year old Kyle Lowry‚Ä¶ but not a 23 year old Lonzo Ball?  Am I missing something?
"Lonzo is so good. Even his Laker years where he was an inconsistent shooter, he changes the game with his defense and passing.    When he's on the floor, you can see the team was willing to move the ball more, almost like it was contagious. He also makes passes that puts players into good positions on the break and doesn't hunt for assists. He's a true team player.    Now that he's figured how to shoot, he's seriously a threat. I don't know if he's improved his finishing at the rim though which was another glaring weakness of his."
"How do they not make sense with each other? LaMelo is a better half-court PG and great finisher. Lonzo is a 3&amp;D guy that can pass in transition, he fits perfectly next to LaMelo. Lonzo is not a half-court PG that needs the ball in his hands.   I mean I agree with you that the Hornets definitely should not use all their cap space to sign him but you say they make no sense next to each other when in fact their games compliment each other well."
"If Pelicans can find a dfensive pick-n-roll C with a 3 point shot, and a true shooting guard that hits off-ball 3s, re-signing Lonzo, that's a Top 5 team in the west right there."
"Your franchise is trash and you‚Äôre going to lose Zion just like you lost AD and Zion is going to win a championship as soon as he leaves the garbage Pelicans just like how AD and soon to be Jrue Holiday did before him. Lonzo Ball is gone next year and no one is going to take trash Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe off your books, enjoy being a fan of a trash franchise and stupid as hell you said 25% and then said ‚Äúoh he improved to 36%‚Äù aka you don‚Äôt even watch the games of the team you support cause that‚Äôs the only reason you would be incorrect about how JJ Redick has been playing all year LMAO."
"A medicore move that benefits both teams - a Bledsoe for PatBev swap.  What do the Clippers need? Playmaking, and unfortunately they don't have a lot of opportunity to get solid playmakers. For all of Bledsoe's shortcomings, he's a decent playmaker who averaged 6 assists a game last time he was in the playoffs for the Bucks. Ideally, Serge Ibaka or small lineups can cover for his lack of a 3-ball as well.   What do the Pelicans need? Shooting and defense. They need that in droves around Zion. PatBev provides that and a veteran presence. He can also play well with Lonzo if they choose to re-sign him.  It's an ugly trade, but a plausible one for both parties."
Lonzo. He‚Äôs better off ball in the half court as it is.
"the only thing holding him back is his lack of self creation . while it‚Äôs far from a guarantee, based on how much he has been able to improve his game since rookie year (mainly his jumpshot), I have faith that Lonzo can develop his handles a little more to be able to create for himself. he has all the tools to be a good playmaker on the go (good vision, unselfish, very skilled at ‚Äúpassing‚Äù the ball) once he can actually improve his self creation"
"i like terry a lot too, don't get me wrong. But I don't think the problem with the hornets is scoring, and i think you can use rozier as a closer while playing him from the bench.   I think if you have Lamelo Lonzo and Gordon as your backcourt, you have so much defensive presence and passing ability. But, to your point, no breakthrough scorer... cuz rozier is the best bucket getter on the team.  I think Lonzo as a backup guard could work by pairing him with Graham. But Lonzo works best with a primary ball handler, which lamelo is, and lonzo gets to work as an off-ball facilitator.  Yeah it's a tough one, but I'd start Lonzo and Lamelo, and figure out what to do about Rozier and Hayward. Do you want more scoring, go with Rozier. And Hayward has the additional benefit of playing as a small ball 4."
"If I had to choose between those 3 for one of them to come off the bench, it'd absolutely be Lonzo.   Truthfully, his fit as a backup PG would be amazing for us (assuming Devonte were to leave). He could come in and command our 2nd unit, while also scoring when needed. He could easily be our best and most consistent backup PG since Jeremy Lin, but I'm very doubtful he's interested in coming off the bench, and he rightfully deserves a legit chance to be a starter somewhere.   Terry was amazing last year. Absolutely carried us for a large part of the year, and was for sure our best closer. And he's still young himself. Like I mentioned earlier, he's a better scorer than both of the Balls, and he's a great defender as well. I wouldn't be shocked if he improves some more this year and flirts with being one of the better scorers in the league.   Gordon, albeit injury prone, is a certified veteran starter for this team. When he's not playing, our youth really shows. He's the ultimate ""hey guys, relax and run our shit"" guy. He doesn't command the ball, and he has a knack for getting us the buckets Terry, Miles, and Devonte can't get us (mostly midrange pull ups, but his driving was really good last year too). He fits our team/schemes very well, and it's a shame we couldn't steal him from Boston a few years earlier."
Which is worse matching a Josh Hart 4 yr $56 mil contract or Lonzo Ball 4 yr $90 mil contract?
"Why does the Lonzo, the larger ball, not simply eat Lamelo?"
Dammit just bought my friend a Lamelo #2 jersey today *facepalm* dont tell me it‚Äôs a Lonzo ball jersey now
Lonzo Ball got drafted then he bought Lamelo a lambo for his 16th birthday I think
&gt;Could this be indicating that Lonzo Ball is on his way to play alongside his younger brother in Charlotte?   No   &gt;Do you believe the two could co-exist?  No
Passing =/= assisting. Just because you‚Äôre a great passer doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to get a whole bunch of assists. There‚Äôs more to it than that. Look at Lonzo Ball. You typically have to be a threat scoring the ball and no when to attack and create assists.  I wouldn‚Äôt say rebounding is more impactful than getting assists. But getting rebounds is definitely more impactful than just being a ‚Äúgood passer‚Äù
"I'm not at all really sold on the idea, as I don't really see the fit.   If you let Lonzo play the 2, he's not nearly as great of a scorer as Terry is in that position. LaMelo definitely isnt as well.   If you play either of them at the 3, you completely make no use out of Gordon Hayward (when healthy).   LaMelo at the 4 and Lonzo at the 1 is something I'd do in 2K, and itd probably be fun as hell, but I know it's not at all practical. Plus, I'd like to see Miles play starter minutes at the 4 next year.   I like the idea of the Ball Brothers together, because the hype would be stupid, and LaVar would lose his mind out of pure bliss. But I don't think we're the team for this.   We have so many other problems to deal with, getting another guard isnt one of them. Please, someone free me from watching Cody Zeller, Biz, and PJ at the 5. We've needed a real C for the last 5 years."
"If Murray was a rfa this year his value would be in that same ball park. Personally I don‚Äôt think Lonzo is worth 25/year, would be shocked if he actually got that, but I understand potential and rfa bumping up value"
This team needs lonzo ball
lonzo ball
Lonzo Ball.  Goo goo it.
"Suns definitely have to let CP3 walk. He can‚Äôt beat anyone off the dribble  &amp; the Bucks have been attacking him when he‚Äôs on defense because of the fact he‚Äôs a super small player. They should look to sign Lonzo Ball because he‚Äôs athletic, 6‚Äô6 200 so he won‚Äôt be a liability defensively or offensively while having the ability to beat players off the dribble."
Shout out to Lonzo Ball for having the most humble press conferences Ive ever seen and being a fantastic teammate despite everything
Lonzo Ball has more Instagram followers then Tom Brady.

"I don‚Äôt think they would be. They are in long term rebuilding mode. Plus, I don‚Äôt think Lonzo would go to Toronto anyway‚Ä¶not flashy or marketable. He is a Ball after all."
"Is Lonzo Ball at that price worth the risk for the Bulls? I‚Äôm not saying he doesn‚Äôt seem to fit their needs, but something about Lonzo on the Bulls seems wrong."

"Knicks are signing Dame Lillard, Collin Sexton and Lonzo Ball apparently. For an organisation who have been lacking in the PG position for years and years, we sure are stocking up lmao."
"Zion, Ja, Lonzo, all help with ball movement or defense.   I still think we're fine though"
"I am aware of how the salary cap works actually and while yes, the Pelicans could dip into the tax to re-sign Lonzo and even Josh Hart, why? They‚Äôre both solid young players but we weren‚Äôt great with them and both have pretty big limitations as basketball players that would ‚Äî along with their salaries ‚Äî really prevent the Pelicans with Zion from reaching higher levels.   I agree you shouldn‚Äôt let an asset walk, so if anything I think a S&amp;T is the answer because if Zo demands a lot (which Rich Paul has been adamant about) then yes, we could dip into the luxury tax to keep Lonzo Ball or to immediately S&amp;T him for lesser expensive players who can contribute."
"Jrue is _eight_ years older. Eight fucking years. Lonzo Ball is better than Jrue at the same age. If he gets better he has the tools to be a top tier 3 and D guy, and average everything else."
Lol that seems like a good way to let the lakers fuck you over you over forcing you to overpay Lonzo. You really think you‚Äôre truly sabotaging LA by saving us from having lonzo ball on a max? Besides they already traded AD their franchise player to the lakers so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to draw the line at lonzo lol. Cutting off your nose to spite your face is how you lose Zion in a few years.
What? Have you watched Lonzo ball at all in the past 4 years?
"Sounds like you need someone in the mould of Jrue Holiday, SGA or even Dejounte Murray more but I guess Lonzo is the closest thing to that available in FA rn.   Would you consider putting a package together for Dame instead? Obvs not the same type of player but that would be a helluva swing and you can focus on putting elite guard/wing defenders in the rotation? With Dame and Zach being your primary ball handlers and scorers"
"Charlotte also has lamelo, graham and rozier already.  Idk that Lonzo is better than any of them.  Although I understand the allure of putting the ball bros together"
The idea of Lonzo Ball is better than actual Lonzo Ball
At least Lonzo can dribble a ball (I hope)
There are tons of players better. Lonzo ball is even better and does what Keldon does but better. This is a clear bias pick. Woj literally said ‚Äúthere is Keldon Johnson love in the coaching room‚Äù
"I nominate Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo Ball and Lamelo Ball. Last time they played together, they were undefeated"
"I‚Äôd be looking at trying to get Lonzo Ball on the team, great playmaking and defending for them if he is willing to drop out of the Drew League to come and play in Tokyo."
"I have a lebron cavs jersey a Lavine jersey a Lamelo ball jersey and a Lonzo lakers jersey, I‚Äôve got more jerseys from other teams then my own team lol"
"Lebron is a scorer that is really elite at distributing the ball, when you think not a score that‚Äôd be Lonzo Ball"
Lonzo is an average at best playmaker in the half court and is a subpar PnR ball handler‚Ä¶ I swear you people really think assists == playmaking.
"John Collins- Hawks, they‚Äôll likely match whatever, and it‚Äôs better to have an asset than not to, some team would trade for his max contract  Lonzo Ball- Chicago, the fit makes a lot of the sense the bulls can sell him the idea of a fresh start and being the lead decision maker instead of sharing the court with Eric Bledsoe lol  Lauri Markkanen- San Antonio, they need a 4 man, spacing and Lauri is European what more is there to say?  Ntilikina- Denver, not sure on their salary situation but they get another bench/ 3rd string  combo guard that can come in, play play defense and compete for minutes with Facu and Dozier while Murray is out.   Malik Monk- Charlotte, the Kentucky fan in me wants to see him with Fox in Sacramento but he‚Äôs in a good place playing with LaMelo and Hayward. I think he has another gear to reach especially if they let Graham walk and give him more opportunity.   Zach Collins-Phoenix, The suns have a need for a backup big they took Jalen Smith last year but having options is always good. When healthy (if that‚Äôs even a thing) Collins has shown an impactful and versatile skillset on both ends of the floor which is something they were looking to add by looking at the smith pick.   Jarrett Allen- Cleveland, similar to Atlanta Allen is an asset. Even if they draft Mobley holding onto Allen and being able to weight the options between trading him or playing him with Mobley is better than losing him in free agency.    Josh Hart- i would say Detroit but he already laughed that off when asked before. I‚Äôll go Knicks he seems like a thibs guy, can play defense, crash the glass and make a play."
"It'd be dope to get Jarrer Allen but I doubt the Celtics could afford his asking price which I assume to be huge money.   I hope Lonzo stays with the Pels. They could build something there. If not, maybe CHA so he could play with his brother then MJ will sign the other Ball brother so he could have a complete collection.   John Collins would probably still be in ATL.   I don't mind getting Lauri for the Celtics. I can see him with the Mavs."
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"Nobody on the team can do with Robinson does. We need a player that's use to moving  without the ball even if he doesn't get the ball.  With that being said, Allen or a Lonzo would've been my priority for team needs."
Goat is MJ  Boat is a tossup between Lonzo Ball and Wendell Carter Jr
"Yea because small market teams have a great history of paying a fair price for elite talent, it's not like they just end up grossly overpaying meh talent. Also what's all this obsession with driving to the basket, when you watched the games last year with the already clogged up paint (Zion gets some of the lowest quality at basket attempts in the league) you thought to yourself oh boy it would be great to have another guy driving in here. Our offense was already elite without having any good 3 point shooters outside of Lonzo.    Lonzo gave you guys 15 points as the third option and is the only guy on the team who can actually hit a three (everyone else either sucks or has very low attempts). Point Zion is already one of the most efficient plays in the league, and BI can handle and play make at a relatively ok level, why do you want someone taking the ball out of Zion's hands, and who the hell is this magical player who'll also providing spacing and defense (the two things this team desperately needs).   The formula is clear, you don't need three 20+ ppg scorers  on your team (how many teams out of thirty even have that?). You don't need another driving threat when you already have Zion and BI. You guys act like Lonzo has never driven the basket in his entire life. You need 3-D guys who'll hit the wide open threes Zion creates for them and who'll make up for his and BI's disgusting defensive deficiencies.  Who is this 3-D, elite play making, and elite scoring guard that you're going to magically get on this team in the one or two years since Zion is already complaining about losing?  Keeping Lonzo who already gives this team the exact things they need, even overpaying him is the best move here, you pray he continues developing like he has every single year and that your GM can construct a roster that fits the needs of this team. Letting him walk and praying you can sign someone better for a fair price as a trash small organization never works, you'll just end up overpaying someone with other flaws. Sign and trade would be the second best thing but it looks like teams aren't offering anything worthwhile."
No they unironically need Lonzo Ball

"Edit: should also maybe change the title to ""Euro 2021 viewership narrowly exceeds NBA Finals Game 1's in the US""  I also think it's because of the fact most viewership comes from casual fans and Bucks and Suns aren't exactly ones that have had a vocal majority fan base in the NBA. It's one of the reasons LeBron and whatever team he goes to has so much star power, Lonzo Ball wasn't making the Lakers popular.  These half-ass ""journalists"" and sports talk show producers don't make a point to focus on a small market team if it has great storylines, they'd rather look for one and make one up on a team that used to be popular so the casual fans' expectations aren't really getting focused on the better, less popular teams.   And also, it's fucking football there's going to be flopping; whole Euros I've seen bits of players take a nap at the penalty line and get up and celebrate as soon as someone scored, anyone suggesting either sport has gotten better at sniffing out flopping is incorrect.   But Games 3 and 4 were fun yo, NBA Finals ratings don't do so hot without LBJ and Curry nephews even if they weren't the best players their fans can't accept that they just weren't good enough to play in the Finals this year. Bottom line.   I'm assuming the Finals will get more viewership now that it's actually a series and not a sweep, and we've actually had some legendary performances from blossoming young talent."
"Thank you.   Ben Simmons is not the type of talent that is worth building around and you are forced to build around him if you want him to be anything close to worth his contract.   &gt; Nobody spends that kind of money on just mid-transition playmaking and good defense. Literally the Sixers are the only team in the league to value it that much. You can get a similar guy in Lonzo Ball this offseason for a 50% discount, albeit he's not quite the defender Simmons is, but at least he can shoot the 3 at a good rate on volume.  Our fans don't realize that halfcourt possessions account for 75% of all possessions and probably get higher in clutch time in the playoffs. The transition trickery doesn't work in the playoffs.   The only role Simmons can play successfully on a good team is center. That is the only position where you can get away with non shooting. He would need be the roll man in pnr and stand in the dunker spot otherwise with a sprinkle of dhos. Even in that scenario you still need shooters around him and a star or two who are great scorers.   It's just not worth the hassle to pay that type of player 28% of your cap if you have any aspirations to win."
1. Lowry  2. Simmons  3. Conley  4. Murray (assuming he comes back 100%)  5. Brogdon  6. Van Vleet  7. Lamelo Ball  8. Sexton  9. Lonzo Ball  10. Russell  Splitting hairs on a few of these though
How do you not have lonzo ball?

"Let's just stick with Lonzo Ball, ok?"
"And to add onto that, Lonzo Ball. I think he's the type of player who needs a lot of offensive talent around him to really shine. He could make a run at an All-Star game in the next few years on the Bulls."
Missed a prime opportunity to add Lonzo Ball
I‚Äôll enjoy the debate if there‚Äôs merit to it. I won‚Äôt debate with someone if they tell me Lonzo Ball is better then Magic Johnson because he can shoot from deep. Your opinion has merit and I won‚Äôt argue if you think Wade is the second best SG ever.
Lonzo Ball and Lonzo Bald
1st year in LA? It was a disaster because his team wasn't good enough. Playing him off the ball and letting Lonzo run the offense was a terrible idea.
"I wouldn't say it's bad. It's just not traditional. We are not talking about a Lonzo Ball jump shot here. His right foot is almost always pointing to the basket. The right arm in straight and firmly under the ball. It's the guide hand/arm that I think makes it look so weird. The elbow points straight to his left because he had such a high set point.   &gt;I would tell kids, when they start, 8, 9, 10 years old, I would do wrist exercises because they could get the ball instead of down here [around the chest], they could get it up here [above the shoulders]  His guide hand never gets play in the shot. The elbow is always super straight and towards the basket, and being 6'9, with a high set point, Larry Bird rarely got blocked. It just looks different because Larry shot more on the right side of his body with a high set point, but those reasons also made him more accurate.  &gt;I said [to Paul George], ‚ÄòI see that you finally got the ball in the right space.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòWhat do you mean?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWell, you‚Äôre starting to knock down shots because your hand‚Äôs in the right position when you‚Äôre following through. It‚Äôs not shooting off to the right.""  I think his jump shot and release look beautiful. It's perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. It's the same as Durant if Durant moved his right arm more towards the right side of his body. I really don't know where else you could release the ball and have your elbow and forearm as straight and facing the basket as Larry does."
My god those are lonzo ball numbers
That player would be about 12% more valuable than Lonzo Ball‚Ä¶
"Some of the best players available would be:  Lonzo Ball   Mikal Bridges  Andrew Wiggins  Aaron Gordon  DeAndre Hunter / Clint Capela  Danilo Gallinari   Bogdanovic  Two of Brogdan, Sabonis, LaVert, Turner  Brook Lopez  Joe Ingles  Jordan Clarkson  Seth Curry  Harrison Barnes  So you could have a lineup like  Lonzo Ball, Andrew Wiggins, Mikal Bridges, Danilo Gallinari, Brook Lopez"
I hope in a few years there will be deep dives into how hard he has fooled people. He has never even been close to the top tier of players in the nba when it comes to contributing on a championship team.   I literally think Lonzo Ball for Russ 1 for 1 is an upgrade for the Lakers
Lonzo Ball for MVP
"And how does touches show ball dominance? There are plenty of players with high touches who aren't considered ball dominant because they're constantly moving the ball around for their teammates. For example, Lonzo had significantly more touches per game than Embiid, Giannis, Towns, KD, etc. and yet no one will argue that Lonzo is a more ball dominant player.   Idk why you're so fixated on this one stat while ignoring everything else.  And lmao you just brought up Beal and Booker as arguments for why usage rate does not equal ball dominant? Those are two of the most ball dominant players in the league"
"Bust Ball Buster, the Redemption  Back of the box:  In a world where one brother (Melo) heads out on an epic quest to save his tarnished family name, laid upon them by their eldest sibling (Lonzo).  Featuring: Lavar Ball, Lonzo Ball, LaMello Ball, LiAngelo Ball, and Caitlyn Jenner"
"&gt; ""Lonzo ball, at his current form, I believe is the best 3 &amp; D role player/ starter caliber currently.""  Klay Thompson"
"Surround that with a really good 3 and D wing, a sharpshooter, and a lonzo ball type pg (good defender, amazing in transition, can shoot the three) and that team is reaaaal nice"
"&gt;Teams are already calling 2022 free agency ""The Offseason of the Rotational Players.""  Was 2021 that much better?  Top (potential) free agents were:         Kawhi (doesn't count; wasn't leaving)   CP3 (old)   John Collins   Kyle Lowry (old)   Mike Conley   Demar DeRozan   Devonte Graham       Other names:   Duncan Robinson   Lonzo Ball   Danny Green"
"Why do you keep saying ‚Äúmaking the team worse‚Äù? Most would consider Lonzo Ball less valuable than Simmons, yet if you switch them Philly possible wins a ring last year. At the very least they get by Atlanta.   Philly can make their team better by getting players that aren‚Äôt offensive black holes and who are actually playable late in games."
"On what basis is it true? Giannis has more assists per game, is a better passer, has a substantially better assist% than Embiid on the same turnover%.  28.7% of Bucks field goals while Giannis is on the court are assisted by Giannis. Embiid is 16%. Giannis assists in more of his team's points than Lonzo Ball did for the Pelicans."
"That is the problem. Lonzo doesn't need to go off, he just needs to help facilitate guys like Lavine, White and Vucci to go off. Similarly, if Zion or BI struggle the narrative is gonna be ""do they miss Ball"" rather than ""did they have a bad game"""
Too bad Ben Simmons is a taller Lonzo Ball who can't shoot
"Hahhaha Im laughing my ass of at this. The fact that they couldnt land a big FA to ‚Äòconvince Zion‚Äô, btw you have no idea what he thinks, doesnt make em worse. They did good moves, they tried to bring in Lowry and CP3, but just couldnt.   I can tell that you dont watch the Pelicans. Zo is a spot up shooter in the half court, too scared to do anything with the ball. Vonte got better TS% even with his dogshit shooting inside and at least he isnt scared to try. Hes also a better playmaker. For all his flaws on the offensive end, Zo isnt even a top tier defender, they were a garbage defensive team, he is not worth 21 mil. Hes far from a key player.   Did you know only 64 of lonzo‚Äôs 850 3PA over the last 2 seasons weren‚Äôt open or wide open?  Did you know he only shot 35% on wide open 3‚Äôs this season?  Did you know that this season his FG% in the 4th quarter dropped from ~42% in quarters 1-3 to 37%? And his 3pt% to 31%?  Did you know that his attempts/min dropped almost 30% from the first 3 quarters to the 4th quarter because he still passes up shots and can‚Äôt create his own?  Did you know Zion had better numbers when Lonzo was off court?  Do you think Lonzo can be the 3rd best player on a contender? Would it have been smart to lock your books in to him being your 3rd highest paid player?  &gt; NAW and Kira are the big ones that can really push them over the top if they pop.  Kira??? Hayes was their best young player besides Zion towards the end last season, by far  &gt; Valncunias  Valanciunas   &gt; kinda feel like he's gonna want to be more than that.  Nobody gives a shit what you feel"
They get worse by not really improving enough to convince Zion to commit his future. Say what you want about Lonzo but Zion has already said that he really liked playing with him and wanted him to stay and letting him go isn't something he's likely happy about. Zo also shot a better percentage from 3 last year than Graham if you actually wanted to go check plus Graham somehow gives you less inside the arc than Lonzo does. If you don't view Zo as even remotely important to this team then idk man. He's not a superstar or anything but he was still a key guy for them. JV is a better player than Adams but he also requires the ball to be more effective. I agree that Murphy is gonna be good but unless you think he's gonna be like a Donovan Mitchell mid-first round picks generally don't effect your team too much but he's still a great bench piece for them who might start as the year goes on.  Sure they maybe got incrementally better but is becoming a play-in team really gonna be all that exciting for them. NAW and Kira are the big ones that can really push them over the top if they pop. They do beat Memphis a lot but the Grizz have still have finished above them since Ja and Zion came innto the NBA. It's all about making your stars happy and if you think that bringing in Devonte Graham and Jonas Valncunias and becoming a play in team is gonna get Zion super psyched about being in Nola then yeah I guess they did but kinda feel like he's gonna want to be more than that.
Hunter I feel has gotten pretty overrated off basically a 17 game stretch to start the year. Big Huerter fan though said before I‚Äôd rather have his skill set than a lonzo ball type skill set. Great role player will play in this league for a long time and be useful
"Unpopular opinion: Hornets need to waive Cody Martin and pick up Gelo, and also trade Rozier to the Bulls for Lonzo Ball. Having all three of the Ball bros will definitely put bums in seats in what is not a well known or famous franchise. The Ball bros also know each others play styles so well and cover each others weaknesses so it'll be prime Chino Hills run and gun offence."
"""How much do you have to gameplan against them"" ""How much do they stress your defense by how they operate"" are getting at the same things which is what he means and which matter alot.  It's a big part of why you get so many players where the idea of the player exceeds the actual reality of them. Lonzo Ball/Aaron Gordon/Caris LeVert syndrome. Sound good on paper but you just dont ever feel their presence and they do nothing that actually stresses an opponent or makes you really account for them."
"More than Lonzo Ball, Vanvleet, Brogdon and Conley? Its an overpay for sure when no other market needs a PG with that pricetag"
"is this post a troll or something? they got rid of adams and bledsoe, but they were so bad they had to waste their 10th overall pick to do it. pelicans keep on downgrading at pg, going from jrue holiday, to lonzo ball (who has become a good defender and shooter now), to bledsoe, to end up with devonte graham. how is this an excellent pickup? he doesn't play defense and shoots the same percentage as lonzo from 3. so griffin decided to flip lonzo to lose his defense and gain what? nothing lmao, lonzo is also a better facilitator than graham because he has chemistry with zion and is an excellent passer. graham will need 2 years at least to build that same level of chemistry. pelicans cannot maximize both of their all-stars without a superstar who plays defense. and this team doesn't have a single defender, so i think they're going to suck even more this year. they will get to the play-ins only if san antonio, sacramento and other teams do worse than them. no way they're getting into the playoffs"
Grizz probably take a small step back but will be more or less the feisty 8 or 9 seed.   Clips maybe just for this season since the news of Kawhi's surgery but that was already expected. None of their moves really made them worse.   Could argue New Orleans depending on how high you were on Lonzo. Valancunias is an upgrade on Adams but still won't really space the floor and needs the ball more to be effective. Devonte Graham is best utilized as like a 6th man/ heater off the bench type. Unless NAW takes a jump I think they got worse relative to the teams around them.   Spurs are the obvious one but everyone said that so decided not to pile on.   Maybe Philly given that it's basically the same roster and it looks like the relationship with Ben Simmons has completely deteriorated and if he comes to camp you wonder if that could be a big distraction if he's really unhappy.
"&gt;but this year‚Äôs Suns were actually playing great basketball for the majority of the season. Hence, the difference in their overall records.  And they got their #1 overall pick back into the lineup, and swapped Kelly Oubre for Jae Crowder.  &gt;CP3 averaged 16/9 on 59.9 TS%. Rubio averaged 13/9 on 53.3 TS%. Pretty clear difference.  Not $24M worth.  &gt;But it must be fun to make up things to argue against. I said 112 combined games from 7 of the team‚Äôs top 8 players.  Which is 16 per player, well down into the bench.  &gt;Brunson‚Äôs ppg decreased by over 4 points.   Because his minutes were slashed.  &gt;His TS% decreased by over 5 percent.  Most players see a decline in that neighborhood in the playoffs.  Even Doncic saw a (smaller) 1.5% decline.  Last time Lowry made the playoffs, his dropped 3%.  &gt;There‚Äôs a reason why they had to resort to the Luka-do-it-all strategy.  No, they didn't.  They didn't in the first two games -- with Brunson playing 20 and 17 minutes, and going 4-7 in each for 15 and 9 points.  Even in G3, Brunson played 22 minutes, shot 5 for 8 for 14 points.  Dallas chose to go all-Luka later in the series, and only played Brunson 20 minutes combined in the last two games.  Do you remember the first two games of that series?  Dallas looked invincible.  They were passing the ball all over the place, and all manner of guys were hitting shots.  They shot 50% in game one, despite Doncic missing 13 of his 24 shots.  Finney-Smith and Hardaway combined to shoot 15 for 24 and score 37 points.  The whole team shot 59% in G2.  Porzingis was 8 for 12 in G2, and 7 for 12 in the game four debacle and probably their best option with Doncic unable to hit water from a boat ( 9 for 24 ).  Then he got 13 shots total in the next two games.  That series was not a masterclass in resource utilization, and was probably a fire-able offense by a coach without Carlisle's lengthy history with the franchise.  &gt;They weren‚Äôt considering keeping Ball clearly, that‚Äôs common knowledge.

"I know everyone thinks the Lakers were tanking all those years, but as a long time Lakers fan I can tell you that was all just legitimately due to horribly incompetent front office management. They were actually trying to win, especially while Kobe was still playing, they were just awful at how they went about trying to do it.   Part of the problem was that they'd gone all in with the trades for Dwight and Nash, giving away a bunch of unprotected picks to do so, and part of it was that Dwight left immediately afterwards and Nash and Kobe suffered career-altering injuries that year, and were never close to the same players again. They bet it all and it blew up about as spectacularly as possible.  After that the Lakers approached every off-season like just cause they were the Lakers, eventually a star would sign with them, so every year they would only sign guys to one year deals so they could keep cap space for the next season. And then when nobody would sign the next season, they'd do the same thing again. They finally stopped doing this in 2016 when instead they blew all their cap space on Mozgov and Deng, which obviously was a terrible decision.   And then on top of that, the guys they picked in the draft were never home run selections. They'd show hints of promise, and have gone on to be good players since, but none were prodigies right out of the gate. D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball are all pretty solid players now, but they were mostly kinda disappointing when they were on the Lakers (especially before LeBron signed).   Like I said, they weren't trying to lose, they were just absolutely awful at trying to win."
Devonte Graham 29th in the league at 42.3% on catch and shoot 3's? I was told he was worse than Lonzo Ball...
"He let go lonzo who to me seemed the ideal partner for zion and ingram and wouldn't demand as many touches too.To me he could have easily kept Lonzo and alsokept the lakers pick which he gave up to get Graham as well. JV pickup is fine but then again they could have avoided such a situation quite easily had they not given Adams that stupid extension in the first place. I kind of Find the Ingram fit with zion not perfect, I would like to see them move him with for MPJ incase Denver are too concerned with his health cuz MPJ i feel offers the perfwct fit as someone whose most offense comes off ball than Ingram who demands more of the ball"
"[Here's the list of past Summer League MVPs.](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/summer/1/NBA-Summer-League/0/awards)  Of the first-year players who have won it (goes back to 2006), it's just Randy Foye, Jerryd Bayless, Blake Griffin, John Wall, Damian Lillard, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Clark, and now Davion Mitchell and Cam Thomas. Interesting list of players."
"that‚Äôs called being overpayed, you‚Äôll be shocked when Demar, Zach and even Patrick Williams handle the ball more than Lonzo. he‚Äôs a point guard but can‚Äôt do things a point guard can do, how does that make any sense"
"&gt;major downgrade at the point guard spot  Devonte &gt; Bledsoe  Lonzo didn‚Äôt play even play point guard, just say you don‚Äôt watch the Pels bro  &gt;Lonzo-Zion connection  üò©üò©üò© we‚Äôre doomed without Lonzo‚Äôs one lob pass every other game, that connection worked so well Zion ended up being the ball handler and Lonzo was stuck in the corner lol"
"Lonzo himself admitted he basically played SG.   Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) Tweeted: Lonzo Ball said his role is more like a shooting guard in the half court offense.   Said, like SVG pointed out, he needs to be ready to shoot in those situations. Added he sees teams collapsing on Zion or BI, so he has to be ready to open things up. https://twitter.com/_Andrew_Lopez/status/1348362638842068996?s=20  But yes you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs who they were referring too."

"Fuckin whole ball family gives basketball a bad name. I don‚Äôt care if they can hoop or not. Lonzo appears to be the brightest of the bunch and that is really not saying much. I understand what he is trying to say but god damnit man, words fucking matter. These idiots consistently say shit that makes you shake your head in disappointment. The whole family needs to recognize the reality and grow the fuck up. They clearly struggle with thinking outside themselves. Go back to fucking school during the off-season lamelo, you very clearly still have some learning to do."
"Man if you heard gilbert arenas talking about Lavar Ball. He had the perfect plan.  He says Lonzo should have signed with Nike, then use that money to build BBB. Then when Lamelo comes in you have something and Lamelo builds it from there.  He says thats the only thing Lavar messed up on."
&gt;Latvian league where Lonzo brothers   The *Ball* brothers played in *Lithuania*.
"Lonzo is probably the only brother capable of being a functioning member of society. He speaks coherently, understands nuance and seems to have a decent moral compass.  It's actually pretty crazy just how bad Liangelo and Lamelo are when comparing them to Lonzo. You should check out Ball in the Family. Lavar is surprisingly a good dad and husband. He raised Lonzo with the right priorities, but something definitely went wrong with the other 2."

"I remember he was really dumb on the ball in family show, not acting stupid either. That show made their family look pretty good with lonzo and gelo working hard, tina making an amazing recovery and lavar showing his dad side. But melo was just dumb lazy and annoying. Good thing he had better genetics than both lonzo and gelo to easily make to the nba."
"Again this isn't all about Lamelo, he still probably would have made the league doing the things you said. I do still believe though that the family he was born in, the age of youtube mixtapes and general high school basketball player celebrity did help him build off an already great foundation. When you're related to a pro athlete (Lonzo) you get so much more exposure, which leads to camp invites, personal training etc. Also being rich he doesn't have to get a job in high school, he can just focus on ball. Of course he still has to go out there and ball out, but he's always been invited to bigger stages than most kids will ever see making his pro path a little more clear and straightforward."
"A name people often bring up is Dwight Howard. Despite all his accolade his game remained limited, and he failed to reach the potential many people expected. Others argue his achievements throughout his career prove he in fact reached that potential.  Others I had in mind: Jeff Green, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Jennings, Michael Beasley, Rondo, Derrick Williams, and I always though Eric Bledsoe would be better"
&gt; He‚Äôs a threat to create his own shot when he has the ball unlike Lonzo. He‚Äôs a much more clutch player and just by those facets alone could create more plays.  That really doesn‚Äôt mean much when he‚Äôs awful at making the shot. Pretty much the same scoring wise as Lonzo.
"He‚Äôs a threat to create his own shot when he has the ball unlike Lonzo. He‚Äôs a much more clutch player and just by those facets alone could create more plays.  The gap is smaller than you think. Lonzo isn‚Äôt an elite defender and Graham isn‚Äôt a turnstile. Yes, Lonzo is better defensively, but advanced stats show Graham as a positive defender (though advanced stats are shit)"

"&gt;https://mobile.twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1425163398854107137  &gt; Lonzo Ball's four-year deal in a S&amp;T to the Chicago Bulls came in slightly less than was reported:  &gt;21-22: $18,604,651  &gt;22-23: $19,534,884  &gt;23-24: $20,465,117  &gt;24-25: $21,395,348  &gt;Final season is a player option. $1M in unlikely bonus money per season for Ball.  You‚Äôll find out that Graham is less than half the player Lonzo is too.  Similarly awful finisher/driver as Lonzo but a complete negative on defense"
"It's probably because I don't watch college basketball or interact with social media much but the cult of personality around Lonzo is wild.  I was getting physical therapy on my shoulder right before the bubble started. This PT bro told me ""I can't believe Lonzo Ball is on our team! I didn't think this would happen in a million years!"" Lonzo proceeded to brick three layups in the first game..."

Get your facts straight before sputtering nonsense."
"I am tired of all of this Graham slander.  Hornets have been my go-to league pass team the last 2 seasons because of Graham.     Graham isn't a terrible defender.  I never saw teams targeting him in pick and rolls unless they had a huge wing who thought they could back him down.  I'm not big into the advanced defensive stats, but he had the 7th best DRPM of any point guard in the league and I haven't seen many stats that have him as a below average defender.    He's a much better off-ball shooter than Lonzo, is fantastic passing in the pick and roll, and is lights out in the clutch.    The Pelicans made the right move.  They got similar production for half the price."
"If you acknowledge that Lonzo or Dipo ""aren't busts in any way"" then there's no reasonable analysis that would place 18 of the last 25 second overall picks as busts.   Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, Ingram, Dlo, Oladipo, Durant, Aldridge, Tyson Chandler, Steve Francis, Mike Bibby, Keith van Horn and Marcus Camby. Going back to 1996 that's 12 right there who were quality nba players or better (and who easily meet the standard of Dipo or Lonzo).   Move the arbitrary cutoff date back to 1990 and you get three hall of famers (Kidd, Payton, Mourning) and another all star (Kenny Anderson). Not even close to ""almost every"" second pick is a bust."
"&gt; The Chicago Bulls and guard Lonzo Ball have agreed to a¬†four-year, $85 million contract, Ball's agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, told to The Athletic.  Get your facts straight before sputtering nonsense."
"For someone that watches a lot of basketball you seem to lack an understanding of what‚Äôs happening on the court.  https://theanalyst.com/na/2021/07/lonzo-ball-new-orleans-pelicans-restricted-free-agent/  &gt; The byproduct of his inflexibility and underdeveloped strength is detrimental screen navigation, and that leaves him trailing plays in no-man‚Äôs land. The same contact aversion handcuffing him around the rim manifests defensively. Rarely does he physically confront assignments, which enables them to maneuver as they wish. He‚Äôs both weak and passive on the ball. Despite sound positional awareness, those blemishes, along with his uneconomical handling of screens, converge to make him optimized in an off-ball role and unfit for such burdensome on-ball expectations."
I'm not impressed by the Pels off-season.  I liked how it started off by getting Valanciunis and dumping Adam's and Bledsoe.   I thought Bledsoe and Adam's were the two biggest flaws on the roster and getting their money off the books was huge.   But literally did nothing after except get rid of Lonzo and acquire Graham for which they had to give up a first round pick.  I was hoping with some of that freed up money they would be able to make some decent moves but I was disappointed.  I do think Graham replacing Ball is definitely a downgrade.  I really hoping my Pels do well this year though because I reallllllly don't wanna lose Zion !!!  I wish we could of made a trade for Duncan Robinson or a really good 3 pt shooter to help this lineup out.  I will say I like that rookie Murphy so far though
This why the people are sleeping on the bulls. Their third best player could be lonzo vooch or demar. Their third best player man. Which means one of these guys falls to 4th bruh imagine ur 4th best player is Lonzo ball. Oh yea and their 5th best player is p will. People be sleep
Thats just not true . I‚Äôve watched many many Lonzo ball games and he is a great defender . If anything I see a lot of people like you who don‚Äôt know what they are talking about in this regard
"He literally wasn‚Äôt the first to report any of this considering the entire article is a compilation of reports. Not to mention he‚Äôs wrong on the compensation in the Lonzo Ball three way deal since Josh Hart is still on NO:  &gt; There seems to be legitimate traction on a three-team sign-and-trade framework between Chicago, New Orleans and Charlotte that would likely nullify any of the Bulls' fears of losing out on their preferred point guard target. From conversations with multiple league sources, the framework that would be discussed appears to focus on landing Ball in Chicago, Devonte' Graham in New Orleans and Tomas Satoransky, Josh Hart and draft capital to Charlotte."
"If only you were skilled at drafting and building a roster. If only.  You had Zion, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball and managed to get worse since then."
How is he a better playmaker. Lonzo averaged even more assist while handling the ball less
"Right, but everything else is still supposed to be the same. He's still a [rapper](https://youtu.be/XmOy3sNKkdA?t=54) according to Lonzo.  So even though LiDicky Ball is a fictional character, I'm assuming that all the other things are the same. Still a rapper. Still put out an album. Still toured and did concerts. Probably still had two seasons of a show on FXX."
"If you think Lonzo and Bledsoe were the Pelicans' 2 best defenders this season you likely only watched a handful of their games, if that. Bledsoe was an atrocious defender due to the fact that he almost never tried. And Lonzo is significantly overrated as a defender. He is a great off ball and help defender and can make some spectacular plays in this regard, but he's also a below average on ball defender. His desire to avoid contact at all cost results in him never attempting to fight through screens in the pick and roll, which leaves the big man in a 2 on 1 situation every time. One time this season he was so timid about a pick that he let the ball handler drive between him and the screener, something I've never seen at the nba level before."
"I actually agree with those Pelicans fans.  He was a complete non threat in the halfcourt that just got $85M.  IMO even as efficiently as he shot last year he hurt the offense.  He left Zion and BI needing to do too much iso work on the wings because teams would rather just give Lonzo that 3 than let either 1 of those 2 run wild.  Graham shot a worst % but that‚Äôs because he actually does a lot of his work off the dribble, not just spot ups.  I think his ability to hit off the dribble and penetrate the defense will open up more ball movement and player movement opportunities and get your 2 best players easier opportunities off ball.  Losing Lonzo will hurt the defense no doubt, but Lonzo wasn‚Äôt the difference between the Pelicans having a good team defense or not anyway."
Lonzo Ball is the point guard version of Myles Turner. But at least Turner only makes 13 M/year.
Imo we might be heading to a point where New Orleans just isn‚Äôt the right market to have a b-ball team. Lonzo didn‚Äôt want to be there and Zion doesn‚Äôt either
"We need that.. people don‚Äôt realize that‚Äôs not what Lonzo wanted. He wanted the ball in his hands, but he wasn‚Äôt good when Gentry let the offense go through him‚Ä¶"
"Lonzo isn't a 40% 3pt shooter, either.    Smart is a better defender. A more versatile defender. And their assist numbers are similar in a similar role.   Smart is also a better pick and roll ball handler and can punish smaller guards in the post.   Lonzo is younger, though.   Its not a bargain contract but its also not a bad one."
"&gt; People claim Lonzo was not a good fit in NOLA because he wasn't good in the halfcourt and that he only was a spot-up shooter  Which is exactly what they need... Also, he was one of their best defenders, he pushed the pace, and shot the ball well. If that's not the perfect fit next to Zion I don't know what is."
"First of all whether these are actually opinions whether you like them or not. But anyway.   1.Atlanta Hawks will have the shooters and defense necessary to easily beat the Nets especially if Reddish and Hunter avoid injury and take a leap this year.  2. Hawks won because they were resilient and knew how to close games, not just because of Simmons. Multiple 76ers players like Embiid and Harris fucked up bad. Only consistently good player was probably Seth Curry. Hawks players are gonna take the big leap this year and shock people  3.I‚Äôm pretty confident in saying this because Trae was having another great night and Hawks were leading before he got injured.  4.If you think LONZO BALL and Demar DeRozen (consistent playoff underperformer) makes the Bulls a super team I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. You should use the term superteam for an actual superteam like the Nets  5.They won‚Äôt be the best team in the NBA, they‚Äôll lose in the first round   7. When you constantly lose in the first round you are overrated. That‚Äôs just a fact. It is what it is"
I hope not. I'm looking forward to Lonzo-LaVine tbh. Unless you're proposing a 3 guard lineup of the Ball bros + Lonzo.
Plus his contract isn't that bad in a league where Lonzo Ball also gets 21/22 mil a year.

"Graham (better shooter than Lonzo)  NAW (better shooter than Bled)  Ingram  Zion  JV  our bench consists of many players that can shoot open threes at a solid rate too   Last year, we had a lot of inconsistent guys and flat out non-shooters shooting the ball for us which made open threes difficult for Ingram. He was still solid though"
"Lonzo ball is a middling player bro. I'm talking about someone who isn't a role player LOL. That's like me bragging about Dennis Schroeder joining the Celtics. Face it, that bum team was nothing before Jordan and will continue to be nothing after Jordan. Have fun"
"We just got Lonzo Ball, but nice try little one.  My favorite part about this exchange is how you downvote my every comment, as if it couldn't be more obvious.  Mate, we're the only ones down this thread.  We're the only ones to experience your loss.  You can swallow your pride and take a hike."
"As a pelicans fan, it's really clear that people don't watch us. This off-season is B to B+.  I firmly believe people are in love of the idea of Lonzo Ball. He's a solid player and the fit was decent enough, but a core of Lonzo, Bledsoe, Adams, Zion and Ingram couldn't even make the playoffs. Saying Jonas is a bad fit next to Zion doesn't sit right with me either. He's a much better fit than Adams.  I acknowledge I'm a homer, but I believe the pelicans have a good shot of being better this season than last."
Part of it is probably because lonzo is only a spot up shooter in the half court offense he‚Äôs a great passer but his ft struggles and his lack of ability attacking the basket means he isn‚Äôt a good fit as a ball handler in the half court
When lakers fans hated Murray cause he dribbled around lonzo at the end of a game is pretty peak  Also Celtics fans when Murray shot the ball at the end of a game trying to get 50 points
"Fuck no and I‚Äôm a bulls fan, we made some redundant moves by getting derozan because Derozan lavine and lonzo are volume players they are at there best when the ball is in there hands."

"LaMelo Ball is one. And Lonzo as well, though for many I think that ship has sailed."
"This could actually help Kennard the most.  He's showing a lot of promise handling the ball, it's just his defense is bad and with PG essentially playing PG, plus Reggie, Lou/Rondo, Bev and the occasional Kawhi iso, he was stuck just being shooter who can't defend.  I could see the bench being Kennard at the 1 and Bled at the 2, and reversed on defense.  How'd he play with Lonzo?"
Lonzo Ball will be a superstar and I'm not afraid to say it

Ricky Rubio prime&gt; Lonzo Ball/ Mike Conley I might be biased since Rubio is my favorite NBA player of all time but I truly think he's good
Lonzo Ball.
"I really don't think any contender wants Lonzo. He's not good enough to dominate the ball, and he's not good off the ball. Wiggins would be a useful wing off the bench on a contender (assuming he's not on a max contract)."
"3 way trade between lonzo, ben simmons, and terry rozier to get the ball brothers all in charlotte. Ben in chicago and rozier in philly. Liangelo ball becomes the next seth curry being the ignition off the bench. Ben and zach lavine have amazing chemistry"
"Not every long, tall, and athletic player can be top 15. If we're going by predraft expectations, Lonzo Ball could also be a top 5 PG in this league"
"I think they‚Äôre biggest problem is ball handling responsibilities. We‚Äôve seen Lonzo and Caruso do some half court ball handling, but he doesn‚Äôt really have another star that can help him in that regard. super stoked to see what they do tho"
If you in the league you long.  These ball bros have IQ off the charts and that is the factor.  I really think Lamelo will be a big deal.  Lonzo has the right attitude to support a championship team.    I'm just so glad it turned out well because I was worried their dad was gonna F them up.  And a couple times almost did lol
If I did this for the modern NBA and try not to make it too crazy:  Ben Simmons  Lonzo Ball  Luka Doncic  Robert Covington  Bamonte Adebayo
"We had Lonzo, Jrue, JJ when he was good, Hart, Favirs before the bubble was solid. Melli was ok that year too.  Last year on paper, we had Zion, Ingram, Ball, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe who were all though if to be ark east good. starter level players. Then we had Hart on the Bench, and during the second half of the year, NAW and Hayes stepped up to become good productive players. NAW really should‚Äôve been starting post all star break last year.  This year we have Ingram, Valunciounas, Graham, NAW, Hayes, Hart, Murphy, who will all be good positive players for us. I could‚Äôve included Naji too. We also have Kira, Satiransky, who could possibly be solid.  If Zion is as good to where people can say that we‚Äôre wasting his talents, then he should be able to carry us to the playoffs. This is not like when we had barely rotation level players starting for us during some of those AD years.  I‚Äôm still not sure if Zion is committed or not, but he hast done much to convince me he‚Äôs fully committed."
"I do. Lebron and Westbrook are going to cut into in others numbers. Ball has lavine and derozan, both hungry for a traditional pass first 1. I get it. It's a bold statement.  Lonzo is polarizing. But I stand by it."
"Lonzo Ball 12-11*-6   *leads the league  It has been the trend the past few years the baby lakers have all made the leap, given the correct circumstance. I submit lonzo will have the same quantum jump given his own team."
"The Pelicans weren‚Äôt even bad with CP3, yet everyone acts like we missed the playoffs every year with him just because he requested a trade, and he requested the trad ebecause of how our past owner ran things. We were bad with AD with a bad FO, but we still almost made things right with the Boogie trade, until he tore his Achilles.   Now we have a new owner (old one died) and a totally new FO except for Fred Vinson who is a great assistant.  I know everyone wants to act like we massively failed this off-season because we lost the next great star PG in Lonzo Ball apparently, but if you watched the Pelicans and know that Lonzo was just a good role player for us, you‚Äôd know that the Pelicans were in a good position. Even if they only made the play-in tournament this year, we have no bad contracts, and a ton of good young players and picks, not to mention a top 10 center in Jonas Valunciounas, and a solid PG in Graham, and a All star in Brandon Ingram.  Everyone thinks the clippers will be fine with Paul George and role players like Reggie Jackson, Batum, Morris etc. this year, so shouldn‚Äôt the generational talent people are claiming we are wasting be able to be just as good with Valunciounas, Brandon Ingram, Graham, and good young pieces around them?  I know since your a Lakers fan your used to teams being able to make themselves better immediately by signing a difference maker that wanted to play for them. The Pelicans tried to do that, but no one wanted to play here from free agency. And you may want to say that small market teams can be successful because of the Bucks, but it took the Bucks a few years to get there too. It‚Äôs crazy that y‚Äôall already decided we‚Äôve failed Zion when he‚Äôs played basically only 1 year with us.  And we are going in the right direction considering we‚Äôve gotten better every year, and our core consist of young players who will continue to get better, and a veteran who won‚Äôt fall off soon. Not to mention all the picks and lack of bad contracts we have for flexibility in the future."
"the wrong personel moves, those matter and shape your career. So yes, Stan Van Gundy was the wrong hire for a young up and coming team. It would make more sense to get someoen to let them loose offensively, take advantage of the youth and atheticism, let them flourish offensively and then when they are ready to take that 1-4 seed step get a vet with those defensive principles.  then the lonzo situation.  Zion has gone a long way to praise lonzo and htey compliment each other perfectly. Lonzo is amazing in the transition, always looking to push the ball, perfect lob or p/r option for zion and then he fits zion as a playmaker as he can play the 3/d role, they just let him go, got another un proven rookie and a vet who has seen his best days behind him for jrue holiday.    they've jumbled up the surrounding him the right way and then in temrs of player health thats always a debate and a battle.  do i think zion is acting too soon? Sure, but pelicans have not done a good job of showin they are an organization that will build a winner for his unique talent opportunity.   so how can he show this? Not sign the extension, ti will cost him a good amount of money to take the qualifying offer nad then go on his way, if he chooses this route then its better for pelicans to get something rather than nothing.  Griffin was supposed to be a new culture and he was promising, but if you read the article the rest of the staff are not sold on his ways either.  they did this beforer him with AD and rondo too. they finally had playoff success, Rondo and AD sung praises of playing together and rondo even said hed look at a discount to stay and run it back but they never called him, replaed him with elfrid payton bc they looked at a box score or something and that was the final nail in the coffin for AD.    These guys careers are done in a flash, before you know it, and they are judged by wins in a team sport.  so the sense of urgency is there bc the status quo is changing."
"Yall do not value playmaking enough. The man averaged 7 assists with just 2 turnovers. And he's overall been pretty efficient last two years at 60% TS despite not shooting the 3 ball. As a mid-range monster surrounded by shooters like he is now in Chicago (Lonzo, Lavine, Vucevic), There is so much value he will add to the team."
Eh Fultz kinda leaped from a top 5/10 to No. 1 guy over the course of that college season leading up to the draft. Jayson Tatum and Lonzo Ball were bigger names in HS
"You dumb shit I said Zo owned his error. But I dont blame him because he was reacting (poorly) to dumb ass Bledsoe shitting the bed and blowing up the game plan because he wasn't paying attention Bled had little remorse about fucking up colossally and not paying attention, where as Zo called it probably the biggest mistake he's made on a basketball court. Bledsoe's task was easy and obvious af, but when he blew it, it through off Lonzo. No he shouldn't of bit, but his insticts betrayed him because of how bad Bledsoe dropped the ball."
Got his respect  Imagine ranking Lonzo Ball above Demar lmao idc if Demar goes 2-20 in game 7 of the finals that is ridiculous
&gt; he traded two lottery picks for DLO (read: more than what the Lakers paid for AD  are you counting max contract wiggins as a lottery pick but not counting brandon ingram and lonzo ball as lottery picks?
"You know who had a broken shot? Lonzo Ball. He went from being below 50% free throw shooting to 78% from free throw this season. His 3 pt shooting has also steadily improved. That‚Äôs improvement, and if Lonzo Ball can do it then Ben Simmons has no excuse."
"LOL. 50 NBA games. Now that the dead weight of Lonzo Ball and the tuned-out Eric Bledsoe are off that roster, the sky's the limit for the Pelicans.  What teams have a player better than Zion? A few, but not many.  What teams' second-best player is better than Ingram? A few, but not many.  Every other team with both a best player as good as Zion and a second-best player as good as Ingram is a title contender."
Lonzo is a good on-ball defender
"I remember this game vividly. Bledsoe did let Rose into the paint, yes. But they were up 3 with the shotclock off. The guy who lost them the game was Lonzo, who helped off a 3 point shooter (Bullock) even though he could have left D Rose to make a layup and be up 1 with the ball with under 5 ticks remaining.  I know its easy to pile on guys on the internet, but Lonzo‚Äôs mental lapse was way worse. You never help off 3 point shooters when the other team needs a 3 to tie in that situation"
"We can‚Äôt say Griffin hasn‚Äôt tried to help Zion. He gave him Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Ingram, Steven Adams, SVG as a coach.   I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough."
"Lazy takes.  &gt; The Adams deal was atrocious.   It want great, but atrocious? I guess Griff should have consulted his crystal ball to see Adams was going to have one of his worst seasons ever before making the deal.  &gt; Picking Hayes right after Zion was idiotic, the last thing Zion needs is another center with a shaky outside shot.   Dang, Griff once again failing to use his crystal ball to see what Zion would need 3 years in the future.  &gt; The Holiday trade stunk for them, they'll probably get two late firsts and little else as Bledsoe didn't work and the two pick swaps likely won't convey.  As opposed to either letting him walk for nothing, or re-signing him for $40mil per year?? Yeah, ok.  &gt; Lonzo was a good fit in terms of position, play style and age and they let him get away.  lol. I wish you had said this first so I couldve just stopped reading."
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
Lonzo ball  Lavar ball  Gelo ball  Melo ball  They don‚Äôt even need a 5th player to beat every other team.
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
"There's not. The pick was discussed before the trade was made. If they wanted Tatum at 1, Ainge wouldn't have made the trade and they would have gotten Fultz or Ball at 3. I'm not sure Magic would have taken Lonzo if Fultz was on the board, they were quick to bring him in for a workout when the Celtics briefly expressed interest in Lonzo."
"Within that 5 years, Lonzo Ball has become a 37.8% on 8.3 attempts 3pt shooter and 78.1% FT shooter."
"Fox scored 39 points on lonzo and UCLA, he demolished them twice. Wasn't even close who the best player of the two were in those games.   &gt;In last year‚Äôs NCAA tournament, Fox lit up Ball and UCLA to the tune of 39 points in a Sweet 16 victory.  [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/11/22/16688052/lonzo-ball-deaaron-fox-rivalry-ducking-history](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/11/22/16688052/lonzo-ball-deaaron-fox-rivalry-ducking-history)"
"Lonzo Ball might make it to the All Nba defense second team, if the Bulls have a winning season.   Ball already was a good defender who defends the opposing best guard on a nightly basis and with a bigger role on the Bulls and a little bit more focus on him compared to the Pelicans he might end up as a candidate for a defense team."
"Heel: The Tribal Chief Giannis Antetokounmpo, with this Bloodline Cousins Kostas &amp; Thanasis.  Face: AEW‚Äôs New Signees Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso"
"If I'm reading this correctly, future all star is better than borderline all star so both KD and Kyrie are worse than Lonzo Ball"
Lonzo Ball
"For Lamelo, I think the risk is worth it. His family is already making millions off his father's business alone. Then there's Lonzo bringing in some good NBA money. They are already so deep into investment and portfolio diversification that the usual fear of financially illiterate layers blowing through their life's salary in 3 years doesn't apply to the Ball family either."
"The Chicago Bulls may have recently brought in a lot of elite new talent (DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso) to the already promising squad of Zach LaVine, Patrick Williams and Nikola Vuƒçeviƒç, but I think it will take some time for them to establish chemistry and flow well together. Also, we need a good Center. I wanna be hopeful for their upcoming season but I also have to be realistic."
"Any of the young player on the lakers? Julius Randle, Brendon Ingram, and lonzo ball"
"Starters:  PG: Chris Paul  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Jonas Valanciunas    for my 2nd unit, I decided to only use 2 non bench players to make this a tad bit more challenging  6th: Lonzo Ball  7th: Jordan Clarkson  8th: Myles Turner  9th: Joe Ingles  10th: Montrezl Harrell   Reserves:  Mathisse Thybulle  Doug McDermott"
Lonzo Ball went the same path through LA and NOLA with neither of them wanting to keep him lol
"Hardest part of this mental exercise is how we define a superstar. I'll try and avoid borderline top 10 players like Beal, George, Tatum etc.  PG: Jrue Holiday (Premier perimeter defense) SG: Duncan Robinson (Historic 3 pt shooting) SF: Kevin Durant (Kevin Durant) PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (A Greek freek) C: Rudy Gobert (DPOY)  Bench: Lonzo Ball (discount Jrue), Joe Ingles (3&amp;D+ bench playmaking), OG Anunoby (versatile 3&amp;D) and Jonas Valanciunas (monster rim runner/ rebounder)"
""" Starter for a championship team, 3rd option on the championship team "" etc.   We witnessed very average or even slightly below average players win championships as starters. I've heard people say Lonzo ball isn't a starter on a championship team, which is crazy to me. I also heard people say Russ Westbrook IN HIS PRIME, is not a good 2nd option on a championship team."
"He's 23 and just repeated his All Star season's numbers with Zion having the most efficient 27ppg season ever. Zion and BI are absolute stars and pillars. I didn't say runnint back the same team. The team made almost all of the changes they needed this year from last.   JV is in every way imaginable upgrade over Steven Adams. Eric Bledsoe shouldn't be in the NBA and is gone. Whoever replaces him starting NAW, Josh Hart or even Trey Murphy would be an instant upgrade. I liked Lonzo a lot, but there's no denying how good of a pick up Devonte Graham is. He was tied for 7 in the league with ast in just his 2nd year in and can shoot the 3. He's  shot 37.4 percent from 3 the last two seasons combined with 65% of his 13.8 fga coming from 3. Trey Murphy looks like the steak of the draft at 17th. He got all summer league avg 16.3/7/2.8 w 1.8stl 1.3blk on 56/44/100 splits and is 1 of 2 players to be 50/40/90 last season and playes great D.  This team is young. Sorry you want that to occur the same way super team rebuilds do. Naji is 23 and looked great us once he made it into rotation the last part of the season avg 9.7/5.8/3.4  his last 25 games. He has good size and can play d. Nickeil Alexander Walker and BI are 23, Zion is 21, Kira Lewis Jr is 21, Rookie Herbert  Jones who is 22 was All Sec first team, Sec DPOY,  and Sec POY and they got him at 35. They have tons of young developing talent and draft picks.  The Pels missed the play in by 2 games. They lost 17 games by 5 or less and 11 by 3 or less. Not having Bledsoe on the team alone last year would of made this team a playoff team. They hired Willie Green a former player for 12 years as a coach this summer. Greeen is highly praised around the league, won championships as an assistant with GSW from 2016-2019 and went to the WCF last year with Phoenix as an assistant and was highly praised by CP3.  So to act like the Pels are meandering, not making moves, are far off from competing, or are dropping the ball is really just not the case in anyway."
"Lonzo Ball  Seems like he's always in his prototype stages. That ""one more year for a break out"" type of player."
Lonzo Ball. This man is not the sharpshooting playmaker and defender that this sub is currently convinced he is
Myles Turner and Lonzo Ball.
Lonzo Ball - 5/4/8 (38 minutes)
The triple single lonzo ball
"Hot take, but I think DeRozan will be better on the Bulls than LaVine this year.  Lonzo and DeMar is actually a pretty nasty duo and I think adding so many big players is going to take the ball out of LaVine's hands.  I'm really excited to watch how this Bulls team goes!"
The triple single Lonzo Ball.
Nah man Barkley bestowed that beautiful stat to Lonzo Ball
I mean they got Lonzo Ball and demar Derozen this year while being a shit team last year
"I'd venture to say that a guy like Kuzma in LA has similar commercial pull to a star in Charlotte. Think of the national attention he got all last year vs Hayward or Rozier. LaMelo got a lot of attention but that has more to do with him being a Ball and playing at a ROTY caliber. Even then, Lonzo got WAY more attention in his first year with the Lakers than LaMelo got with the Hornets, and LaMelo was miles ahead of where Lonzo was his rookie year."
"Lonzo Ball? James Harden? Marcus Smart? Patrick Beverley? PG is the weakest position defensively but ""no PGs play defense"" is ridiculous lol"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say ‚Äúany sort of attempt at walking back and claiming it had nothing to do with Covid would be ridiculed beyond belief‚Ä¶‚Äùand use that as a benchmark.  You‚Äôre essentially saying ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs strip the situation of context and look only at what was said.‚Äù  But context matters.   If your best friend walked up to you and said ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù your reaction would differ from if your boss walked up to you and said ‚ÄúFuck you.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt care about Kyrie at this point. He lost me with the flat Earth and dinosaur stuff all those years back.  But it does matter that it‚Äôs Kyrie who said this because we know Kyrie says shit like this and does mean the deeper meaning, even if the deeper meaning is stupid.  If Charles Barkley said it, our reaction would be different.   If LeBron said it, our reaction would be different.  If Ernie Johnson said it, our reaction would be different.   If Lonzo Ball said it.  If Pop said it. Etc etc etc   You can‚Äôt ignore that it was Kyrie as a way to condemn Kyrie. And that‚Äôs true for anyone and not just me trying to defend Kyrie. It‚Äôs me defending nuance and context because social media loves to abandon nuance and context.  It‚Äôs absolutely stupid he said it without context, given where the world is at. But it‚Äôs not absurd to think Kyrie would believe it‚Äôs not COVID related and is fine."
Lonzo Ball
1. Jayson Tatum  2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo  4. De'Aaron Fox  5. John Collins  6. Lonzo Ball  7. Jonathan Isaac  8. OG Anunoby  9. Jarrett Allen  10. Monte Morris  11. Kyle Kuzma  12. Derrick White  13. Lauri Markannen  14. Luke Kennard
I crunched the numbers but then gave a boost to JI (injuries - but eye test says DPOY) and Markkanen (Boylen - but I think he could flourish in the right situation).   1. Bam Adebayo. 2. Jayson Tatum. 3. Donovan Mitchell. 4. OG Anunoby. 5. Jonathan Isaac. 6. Lonzo Ball. 7. John Collins. 8. De'Aaron Fox. 9. Lauri Markkanen. 10. Derrick White.
Everyone that‚Äôs says DeMar is a bad fit overlook or just plain ignore his elite playmaking ability. Having career assist numbers in San Antonio. You‚Äôre right about Lonzo not being a true point which is where DeMar can fill in and be the primary ball handler  The Spurs shot better from 3 with DeMar on the floor (even if it was by 1 percent) despite him being a floor shrinker.   He‚Äôs about to play with the best 3 point shooting lineup he‚Äôs ever had with shooters even being at the 4 and 5 position  Zach and DeMar are a match made in heaven because now Zach can move off the ball and can be even more efficient than he already is with his elite catch and shoot ability and his IQ as a cutting slasher
"Wow. time flies. My b. Still, I think Lonzo will get better and wont peak for another 4-5 years. Maybe I'm bias bc i'm rooting for all the ball bros"
Don't forget that Lonzo Ball is better than Devin Booker  /s  For real I feel like for whatever reason PGs and Cs are rated way higher than anyone else is
Lonzo Ball
"I feel confident the Bulls will be a playoff team this year. My only concern is that they sacrificed draft picks and cap flexibility to win now with 32-year-old DeMar DeRozan and 30-year-old Nikola Vucevic, who are fine players but aren‚Äôt LeBron and AD or Durant and Harden.   They are gambling hard on major improvements from 26-year-old Zach LaVine, 23-year-old Lonzo Ball and 20-year-old Patrick Williams. It sounds to me like a playoff team, maybe even a second round playoff team, but not an Eastern Conference Finals team."
I'd üíØ take John Collins over Lonzo Ball   Obviously I'm biased
"Pretty fair list. But I would put Fultz somewhere in the 9-10 range with Lonzo and White. If we are looking at players at their current state not their body of work, Fultz has been on the upswing and is expected to improve further in his new role on the Magic.  I would also swap Isaac and Collins but that's really a nitpick, I guess I'm just higher on the Magic players than most. I think Isaac fits the OG mold as a borderline defensive-first star down the line. I don't see Collins as being as impactful as OG and Isaac just due to his position and playstyle which is more common than OG/Isaac.  Also Lonzo is in the Isaac/Collins tier for me, but I fully admit I am probably too high on Lonzo. His college game just showed too much potential and while he didn't showcase it on the Lakers/Pelicans, the Bulls should be able to unlock more of his shooting game by giving him access to players like Lavine and Demar who draw attention off the ball. Zion can't create his own shot outside of the paint and BI, while being a good shooter, doesn't really have the gravity of Lavine and Demar. If BI gets the ball he's probably going to put it on the floor which lets defenders slack."
it is insane to me how the media covers lonzo ball
"A lot of people would watch if there are exciting young guys balling out. I remember when Lonzo Ball was in Summer League  the games had millions of streams.  It wouldnt be that hard to build hype for this tournament honestly, the players will market it themselves with trash talk on social media, or making side bets over the prize money and so on. There are so many directions it could go in that can only benefit the league"
"Because he‚Äôs a Ball brother.  They‚Äôre like the basketball Kardashians, absolutely everybody who watches NBA has known about the Balls since at least the year Lonzo was at UCLA.  They‚Äôve had ESPN videos made about them as far back as 4-5 years ago, and LaMelo became national news as a freshman because he dropped 92 in a game and their team basically annihilated everyone else on the way to a state title.  Lonzo wasn‚Äôt a top player, but he was extremely high profile since forever.  LaMelo was able to take that and the added hype of all of his brothers saying he was the best and back it up with his skills.  Say what you want about Lavar but mans is a marketing genius."
"Rich Paul has been in the chat. One of his players, Lonzo Ball, just signed with Chicago this summer. I'm surprised so many people have forgotten"
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"I think Zach is in the best situation rn  Great playmakers around him to ease up the burden he had last year on offense and let him play more off the ball where he‚Äôs really effective  And he‚Äôll have Caruso and Lonzo taking the harder assignments on defense  Above all this is his team, any other team that‚Äôs contending or in the playoffs he‚Äôd be second or third option"
"Those aren‚Äôt correlations, they‚Äôre coincidental. Playing against g leaguers fighting for nba contracts and rookies doesn‚Äôt show how a player will perform in the nba in any way shape or form.   Ayton is a great defender tf ?  Which areas he excelled in doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a small sample so that‚Äôs a weird point to mention.   And idk why you‚Äôre acting like he dominated when he put up an inefficient 14/11 over a four game sample. Cam Thomas outplayed that. Jalen green. Tre Jones. Omer yurtseven. And while we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs look at some past players to further prove my point. 2015-2016, Alan Williams dominated and went on to be a fringe rotational guy and then out of the league. Noah vonleh played extremely well too. Meanwhile all star KAT struggled a lot. The next year? Trey Lyles and Kris Dunn were the summer league stars. What incredible careers they‚Äôve had. 2017-2018? Bryn Forbes dominated. Lonzo ball was electric. Guys like Quinn cook, troy Williams, Wayne selden, Dennis smith jr and Deandre Bembry were all excellent. Meanwhile guys like bam and fox struggled. 2018-2019? Malik monk and josh hart stole the show. Ante zizic dominated too. Cheick diallo was a real standout too. But guys like Trae young were awful. 2019-2020?NAW, anfernee Simons, Tony Bradley and drew Eubanks killed it. Meanwhile RJ Barrett sucked.  Summer league means nothing"
Al Hordford shouldnt be on that list. He did great things for ATL and BOS. Lonzo Ball could be there.
"Lonzo is supposed to be a 3-D type of player, to go along with his PG skills. I imagine at the end of games, Lavine and Derozan will be the on-ball players and Lonzo will be the 3-D option on the wing."
"Yeah, but lonzo has innate shooting ability that Simmons doesn't have. Even with his busted form Lonzo shot 44% from 3 in high school:  https://www.maxpreps.com/m/athlete/lonzo-ball/Xoz-LfTvEeKZ5AAmVebBJg/basketball/stats.htm  And 41% from 3 in college: https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/lonzo-ball-1.html  Ben Simmons has never sniffed that at any level, Lonzo &amp; Simmons are not the same. Lonzo just needed to tweak his form for the nba. Simmons needs to rework his entire shot and even then we should only expect marginal improvements.  https://youtu.be/2x3-B4ogAqA"
"&gt;	A few minutes on some highlights shows  Lol   &gt;	he actually doesnt mind being an off ball shooter, but he just cant get into a rhythm when hes parked in the corner every possession.    He also doesn‚Äôt move off-ball, isn‚Äôt a huge drive threat &amp; doesn‚Äôt set quality screens, making it hard to use him shooting off-ball.    &gt;	He looks great when hes actively working in the pick and roll from outside. He can be active, and prefers to pop more than roll for a quick 3. Doing this requires having a real point guard, which Chicago has not has as long as Markannen was with them. (Congratz on getting Lonzo BTW).    I mean the first part is basically just restating what we already know. He‚Äôs a shooter who isn‚Äôt super comfortable driving w/ the ball or being a roll man because his ball-handling &amp; security as well as his finishing needs work. You are right on needing a better PG but this gets back into the debate, if you have to spoon feed a player their entire offensive production, they‚Äôre kind of going to be a role-player.     &gt;	Hes surprisingly athletic and tends to get into a zone when he can play downhill a little. Give him opportunities to put the ball on the floor, and he immediately starts producing more.   Very highlight-based take. Lauri has a poor handle and often loses control of the ball on drives. He‚Äôs not good with handling contact or finishing through it either.     &gt;	He prefers layups and dunks in stride rather than from on the block. When hes in a flow, he also defends and rebound better, which has upside and downside.   Again, yeah he doesn‚Äôt like the block because he‚Äôs kind of weak and struggles with contact but at the same time has major holes in his game that hurt him from utilizing the layup/dunks in stride part of his game. Are you starting to see the conundrum of Lauri?     &gt;	Now, it seems to me the Bulls tried him at the wing for this very reason, but that still wasnt right. Fortunately, the Cavs have become a very solid player development franchise, and I think the pieces he will have around him are going to help play to those strengths.   We did more than try. He‚Äôs just not a wing, he doesn‚Äôt have the athleticism or mobility.     You‚Äôre not wrong about the two man game but that‚Äôs kind of the thing about Lauri. It feels like theres 40 conditionals you have to get right for him to play well and even then its not like he‚Äôs a top 15 player or something so it becomes a question of how much is this worth really building everything around? &amp; with this skill-set how can you be much else BUT a role-player?   Thats the real x-factor I think people mess when evaluating the Bulls-Lauri relationship. Is he needs to develop his game if he‚Äôs ever not going to be just a role-player but hasn‚Äôt really been able to &amp; has been given many chances. Stuff like his softness is mental at this point &amp; it‚Äôs holding him back. Hopefully the Cavs can get him to do it but he might just be kinda mentally weak tbh.   To be clear, I think Lauri is a fine player and will do well in Cleveland. I could easily see like 17/8. I think hell have a long career and probably win a chip as a valuable role-player. I just think he‚Äô closer in skill to a less athletic Richard Jefferson than a Dirk."
"Lonzo was always a team player and someone who was willing to sacrifice for the team, he has his faults as a player but the guy is a good team mate  Of the 3 Ball brothers Lonzo is probably the furthest in terms of personality from his loud-mouthed father"
"Well to know the answer to that just look for moments when hes at his best.  A few minutes on some highlights shows me that he actually doesnt mind being an off ball shooter, but he just cant get into a rhythm when hes parked in the corner every possession.    He looks great when hes actively working in the pick and roll from outside.  He can be active, and prefers to pop more than roll for a quick 3.  Doing this requires having a real point guard, which Chicago has not has as long as Markannen was with them.  (Congratz on getting Lonzo BTW).  Hes surprisingly athletic and tends to get into a zone when he can play downhill a little.  Give him opportunities to put the ball on the floor, and he immediately starts producing more.  I also immediately noticed he thrives in a 2 man game often, and at any spot on the floor.  He prefers layups and dunks in stride rather than from on the block.  When hes in a flow, he also defends and rebound better, which has upside and downside.  Now, it seems to me the Bulls *tried* him at the wing for this very reason, but that still wasnt right.  Fortunately, the Cavs have become a very solid player development franchise, and I think the pieces he will have around him are going to help play to those strengths.  I could see the Cavs running him from the top of the key a lot and letting him move outside-in.  Also a 2 man game with Garland, and possibly Sexton, could be very nice.  Finally, while he isnt KLove - or even younger KLove on the Wolves, he will have a vet with a similar skill set to learn from."

Devonte Graham outperforms Lonzo Ball
I‚Äôm sorry but this whole comment is just ignorant babble.  1. You did have one of the easiest schedules to begin the season you can go look up any schedule ranker.   2. Your ‚Äústarting pg‚Äù was Lonzo ball who was terrible in general. And if you are seriously saying that you missing your backup pg and sg at times throughout the season was the reason LA had below playoff record even when Lebron returned then you are completely deluded.   3. Absolutely none of this explains why Lebron didn‚Äôt go to a better team? I have no idea how someone can hold the opinion that them having a couple of injured backups was the reason they didn‚Äôt win a championship.
Wasn‚Äôt he doesn‚Äôt this the last couple summers‚Ä¶ and nothing has changed during the season really. He needs to work on his shot form and release. I see why isn‚Äôt that good. Take someone like Lonzo. His form and release were awful. But he reworked it more and more and now he is a way better shooter. His release looks soooo much better. The ball comes off his finger tips nicely with proper rotation
Lebron wasn't going go give up better chances for a ring if Kyrie stayed vs. playing with 2nd year Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram lol
"The Ball brothers really changed perceptions for lost people. Everyone assumed they were these bonafide superstars with ego problems mainly due to Lavar. But man, Lonzo seems really down-to-earth and mellow and willing to improve. It doesn‚Äôt feel like he has that big an ego, and it‚Äôs almost like he knows he‚Äôs not going to be a No.1, and he‚Äôs fine with that.   There were all these criticisms of Lamell for the same stuff, but last year he just looked like a good teammate. LaMelo took his defense from a 2/10 to like a 6/10 in a season with no off-season training and limited practices. There‚Äôs work ethic in the Ball Brothers, and idk if I can say that for Simmons."
"Second only to the New Orleans Pelicans Ball movement, who traded Lonzo Ball to the Chicago Bulls"
"""Lonzo Ball Stats, Splits | ESPN"" https://www.espn.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball  Check your evidence before sputtering shit"
"He also predicted the careers of Lonzo and LaMelo Ball: ‚ÄúCause the same people that tried to black ball me/Forgot about **two things, my black balls**‚Äù"
Lonzo ball and it‚Äôs not even close imo
I think he‚Äôs wrong . You absolutely cannot win in the playoffs with Simmons as your starting point guard he will get exposed we know this . Difference is Lonzo is bad at driving and Simmons literally will not shoot the ball . In today‚Äôs game you just need to be shooting threes as a decent clip
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
Funny enough the player that got me into those shoes was Lonzo when he wore it at [UCLA](https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lonzo-ball-adidas-harden-vol-1.jpg) and later when he worked out for the Lakers when there was that drama about which shoe he would wear.
Lonzo Ball at finishing at the rim.
"He was the top prospect for his class for a while, but then hit a snag with back to back injuries.  I just looked his HS class and it looks like a bunch of people in his class had lackluster careers.   1 - Josh Jackson  2 - Harry Giles  3 - Lonzo Ball  4 - Jayson Tayum  (obviously good)    5 - Markelle Fultz"
"Lamelo ball, brad Beal, lonzo ball, Chris broucher, Marvin bagley  Deadly small ball lineup if healthy"
Lonzo Ball beside himself
Lonzo Ball is coming for that title.
Lonzo Ball is hilarious af (not the OP tho)  &gt; My name is Lonzo Ball &gt; &gt; I play basketball
"Ben Simmons has two all-defensive teams, was all NBA two seasons ago, and has three all star appearances.  Sure, he had a bad postseason performance, and was terrible offensively in the back end of last season.   Lonzo Ball, with no disrespect, is a high level role player. Simmons is already a star. Hell, he was second in DPOY voting last year and arguably should‚Äôve won it over Gobert.   Simmons fit in Philly is terrible, especially in the post season. but it doesn‚Äôt make him a bad player by extension."
"&gt; Lots of freshman and sophomores have had his level of success  Name freshman other than Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley that have.  &gt;By those measurements he was not even top 10 within the year he played  Do you mean players in the country? That basically never happens for freshmen in P5, especially not if you aren't playing on Kentucky/Duke/Gonzaga/a powerhouse school at the time.  &gt;Someone like Zion the next year was an actual all-time dominating force in college  Playing at a powerhouse with pretty much an entire roster better than the 2nd best player on Trae's team.  &gt;Trae is only an all-time talent if you count exclusively by raw point and assist totals and ignore literally everything else.  Yes, volume and situation both actually matter lmao.  The list of players with Trae's intersection of volume, situation, and efficiency is incredibly small.   Zion played on one of the most talented teams in the country under the best college coach of all-time, on a team that cranks out hyperefficient seasons on a regular basis. Zion was a notch above their typical hyperefficiency, but Marvin Bagley was 21/11 on 64.3% TS, and Jahlil Okafor was 17/8.5 on 64.1% TS.  Like you've done multiple times already, you completely miss the significance of the landscape of college basketball.   &gt;58% TS is good but not amazing for college.  27.4ppg on 58.5% TS is absurd lmao, its literally mind-meltingly good. That's why I wanted you to look up all the previous top PG draft picks so you could grasp how much of an outlier Trae's production was.   Lonzo Ball: 14.6ppg  De'Aaron Fox: 16.7ppg  Ben Simmons: 19.2ppg  D'Angelo Russell: 19.3ppg  Marcus Smart(soph): 18ppg  Victor Oladipo(junior): 13.6ppg  Damian Lillard(senior in non-P5): 24.5ppg  Kyrie Irving(11 games): 17.5ppg  John Wall: 16.6ppg  Tyreke Evans(non-P5): 17.1ppg  Steph Curry(junior, non-P5): 28.6ppg  Derrick Rose(non-P5): 14.9ppg  Russell Westbrook: 12.7ppg  The only PG close to Trae's volume was Curry, and he did it as a Sophomore and Junior in a non-P5 conference. Trae doing it on great efficiency on top of it is ridiculous.   Doing what Trae did as a freshman in the P5 on a non-powerhouse is as close as it gets to outright unheard of. The only comparables are Beasley and Durant.    &gt;Many guys are regularly well over 60% even on high volume.  Not Guards, not Freshmen, not on Trae's volume, not in the Power 5, and not at non-powerhouse schools.   &gt;Also, Trae‚Äôs TS% was hugely uplifted by shooting a ton of free throws, which is another thing many college guys struggle to bring over to the NBA.  That's the opposite of true. FT attempts are one of the stickiest stats, if not the actual stickiest from college to the NBA. Rim attempts and FT attempts are two of the biggest predictors of NBA success and Trae was elite at both."
"...Chicago just had one of the greatest off seasons in modern NBA history.  They fleeced multiple teams, conspired with Klutch/Rich Paul to get Lonzo Ball into Chicago, made a record number of s-&amp;-t's, loaded up their rostre with upside guys, etc etc etc."
"LOL wait...this comment is like, sarcasm or irony...?  ...right...??  LMAO.  Chicago just had one of the best off-seasons in contemporary NBA history.  AKME are literally rebuilding the NBAs greatest brand &amp; are receiving global accolades for their efforts...what in gods name are you talking about ROFL  Also, are you seriously comparing ZLV with damian freaking lillard....?  Or Portland's FO to AKME.....?  Zach LaVine is small potatoes compared to where AKME are about to take Chicago.  Klutch/Paul are literally teaming up with AKME right now, have you been living under a freaking rock for the past month.....?  Klutch literally tampered to get one of their most popular &amp; well-known clients in Lonzo Ball into Chicago, and just signed his running mate.  The Zach LaVine clutch announcement was extremely Bulls-centric.  Klutch/Paul are planning to take over Chicago &amp; make it the biggest brand in the world once again  Srsly, what even is this comment, smfh hahah"
"He's a fantastic fit there tbh. He's huge and can be a bench 3/4 with great iso d.   You've got no shortage of ball handlers with deebo, zach, coby, lonzo and Caruso. You can stick him in the dunkers spot or in the corner and don't ask him to do much, and he's well worth it as a roster spot."
"~$20 Million is just the price of a mid tier starter nowadays. That‚Äôs about the same amount as Lonzo Ball got, and I‚Äôd say Lonzo is in the same tier as AG. They both average around 13 PPG for their career, and they‚Äôre both good defenders. Lonzo is a better shooter, but AG is better at finishing at the rim. Lonzo is better at passing in transition, but AG is better at finishing in transition, which is arguably more important for a team with Jokic. On defense, [D-Raptor](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/) ranks Gordon (+1.0) as the slightly better defender than Ball (+0.4).   $21 Million might be a slight overpay, but it‚Äôs not an insane overpay, especially since Gordon fits really well with the Nuggets."
"5% of the way through the season and all that but Lonzo is looking like he might get an All Defense nod this year if he can keep it up. One of the criticisms I heard is that he's not a great point of attack defender and, like, I *guess* that's true in that he's not literally like a top 10 PG in that role, but he's not *bad*, he gets to cede that role when Alex Caruso is on the floor, and he's awfully good at just about everything else you want a guard to be good at - jumping into the lanes (he's top 5 in that), keeping up with smaller players, etc. - and even some things you don't expect a guard to be good at - using his length and jumping ability to stop guards, wings, and even sometimes bigs in the post, grabbing boards (not exactly defense but preventing second-chance points is definitely defense-adjacent).   I totally get why if you look at him certain ways you might be disappointed - he wants to be a classic 1 but he doesn't really have the quickness or the handle to break down other 1s in a halfcourt setting - but man, that whole deal with looking at what a guy can't do is a bit toxic for a younger, not very good team. Instead, you build around what your guys, especially your younger, more talented guys *can* do and figure out if that's enough or what you need to add from there. And on top of that when it comes to Ball specifically if you cordoned him off 3 years ago based on what he couldn't do, you'd be adding to that that he can't shoot from outside or even midrange particularly well (for that matter he shot under 50% from the line his rookie year). He's worked very hard to add 3s to his game."
"And yet he chose to move to a team where he will not be THE point guard. He is, and will continue to be, a secondary playmaker who gets the rebound, brings the ball over half court, runs the play if it's a fast break and if not he hands it off to one of LaVine, Vuc or DeRozan who runs the play while Lonzo spots up off ball.  That was his role in NOLA, that is exactly his role in Chicago.  He said to the media that he moved because he wanted to be a ""true point guard"" but guess what - he's not telling the truth. The truth is the reality of what we can see on the court, and that is that his role was the same on both teams.  He moved because he wanted to get paid, and play in a big market city, not because of his role on the team."
"Ok I loved Lonzo and did not want him to go but damn. People acting like graham is a huge downgrade are absolutely insane.   So far this season:   Graham:  18.4 pts on 44.3% FG 5.2 assists  3.6 rebounds  3.4 on 8.6 3PA hitting on 39.5%  1.1 steals  0.2 blocks   Lonzo:  14.3 pts on 45.7% FG 5.3 assists  5.8 rebounds  3.3 on 7.5 3PA at 43.3% 2.0 steals  1.8 blocks   Ok, so assists are the exact same, shooting the ball is pretty much the exact same. Lonzo gets a couple more boards and is obviously better defensively (although graham has been pretty solid on defense so far). Graham can also run the offense in the half court, something Lonzo always struggled with. Lonzo overall is the better player but I would much rather have graham for half of the price, he‚Äôs not half the player Lonzo is. They are very close.   Not to mention both of these guys are still young enough and have room for improvement still"
Lonzo Ball. Harrison Barnes.
Lonzo Ball
"Main reason was because Lonzo wasn't good in the half court and wasn't showing notable improvement on that front. So, we just switched him off ball since he's more or less a SF with shockingly amazing passing ability. But he didn't like that, so I suppose it was a mutual separation on both their parts. Which, honestly, doesn't make sense to do when they could've just kept him a little longer and then traded him for someone better at the first opportunity. Griff is just a moron for not getting better value for Lonzo."
It was never lonzo‚Äôs fault and it was always about having a superstar powerforward/tweener who cant shoot and cant defend the rim (zion) and having a slow big with no shooting (adams) and having a non shooting guard with the same position as lonzo (bledsoe) and having a ball stopping wing (ingram). It was a disaster in roster construction. Players tried their best but the fit ain‚Äôt it.
"Hes the primary ball handler in chicago, wym. No one is saying lonzo should be an iso scorer like what youre talking about."
"The reason was that the Pels improved as a team once they used Lonzo less and let Zion and Ingram drive the ball up and create their own plays. As a result, Lonzos skillset was not being fully utilized. He mostly got used for defense, transition passes and being a catch and shoot player. That alone isn‚Äôt worth the 20 million they‚Äôd have to pay up.  On the Bulls, Lonzo gets to handle the ball, make his plays, and do all of that. The Bulls are utilizing him for his worth and have constructed a team that greatly benefits him. Graham is a clear downgrade but all they needed in that spot for a catch and shoot guard because they want to revolve the team around Zion and Ingram.  Pels issue really is that they did not actually improve the team with that saved cap space and somehow lost picks in the off-season."
"I feel like it‚Äôs always Bulls fans that actually don‚Äôt totally shit on replacing Graham for Ball given the circumstances. Like you can realize Lonzo is a better fit in Chicago as a 4th option than he was in New Orleans as a 3rd. We had Lonzo, Zion, and BI in the bubble and Lonzo pretty much got us knocked out along with poor play from Zion. I think he is a perfect fit as a 4th option spot up shooter with Lavine, Derozan, and Vucevic carrying the scoring load and Lavine initiating the offense most of the time. We needed a guard that was more aggressive on the PnR and Graham is that. He‚Äôs not the best PG in the league by any means but his style of play fits what we need and I think he can thrive playing with BI, Zion, JV, and NAW"
"Don‚Äôt worry, he might be the next youngest guy to get a triple double, noted superstar Lonzo Ball."
"I used to despise Lonzo for obvious reasons, always extremely overrated and played poorly for the Lakers most of the time, just a distraction and nothing else. But it‚Äôs good to see him embracing the role player side of things, focusing on defense first, improving his jumper, distributing the ball, etc.. definitely not a star material (never was, never will), but he improved to be a very solid role player who has a place in this league, that‚Äôs nice. Embrace who you are, get better, work on your craft, etc.. you can‚Äôt deny these are positive outlooks for any ‚Äúprofession‚Äù really, Lonzo is like the complete opposite of Ben Simmons"
"Yep.  Graham went 21/5/6 tonight with 5/10 from 3.    Lonzo wanted the ball in his hands more and to initiate the half court offense, but that‚Äôs not his jam and we have BI and Z."
"Seemed like the Warriors FO just hit a wall in terms of how much luxury tax they would be willing to pay to keep the window open. Lonzo in that salary spot with the team we have right now (especially the 2nd unit backcourt of Poole and Ball) would have been a three year contender easily.  As a season ticket holder, I've been getting all of the emails for all of the shows they are having at Chase Center (as far out as next September for Swedish House Mafia). They are fucking *printing* money out here."
"Might be too early to grade but no one is really talking about the Lonzo Ball trade to the Bulls. Pelicans got Garret Temple, and Tomas Satoranski.  Pels are struggling mightily without anyone who‚Äôs able to get others plays. Who knows how long Zion will be out but their schedule is about to get really tough. Temple is not a playmaker, not great on offense and Sato isn‚Äôt even in their rotation. I know Ball was leaving anyways but I‚Äôm a little surprised Bulls were able to get him without losing Coby White."
"I think in 2-3 years ‚ÄúLonzo Ball for Garret Temple, Tomas Satoransky, and a 2nd‚Äù will be viewed as a viable addition to this list."
"iirc it was no more than 20mill/yr even on a shorter deal so they wouldn‚Äôt even do 60/3 which is ridiculous for a player who shot as good as Lonzo the last two years, especially considering age.  Also while PG defense isn‚Äôt as important as big defense to the team they still make an impact and the last thing New Orleans needed was to be losing positive defenders when they plan to run Zion and Ingram out there every night.   Honestly they were handed a golden platter by Lakers and are some how fucking it up. I know AD is a monster so he‚Äôs more than worth what they got but they got an all star caliber player (maybe more if he ever starts playing defense) in Ingram, an above average starting PG who shoots the 3, plays D, and doesn‚Äôt need the ball in his hands, Hart is a quality role player, and then three firsts with a top 4 pick being one of them.   Considering they won the draft lottery a month earlier they basically have fucked this up in a lot of spots. Yeah Zion has been injured and they can‚Äôt control his off season habits or injury risk but I mean come on, look at the front office since they got him after the AD trade (which lets be honest was basically telling the Lakers to give them everything that they got).   Kept on Gentry for a single year(Zions rookie year no less) for basically no reason except being cheap, hired Van Gundy then fired him the next year, trade for Steven Adams then extend him unnecessarily, trade for JV afterwards, let Lonzo walk for seemingly no reason and gave up a first to do it somehow and only got back Devonte Graham.   If we were to judge FOs on what happened from August 2019 forwards only I‚Äôm not sure anyone has been even close to as bad the Pelicans are."
"&gt; That you think we should have gotten rid of Ingram instead of Lonzo. That's a wild take to me  Ok hear me out.  Ingram is not as good offball, but Lonzo is best with the ball in his hands. BI isn't supposed to be relegated to being a standstill shooter too, but Zo is.   It's clear the Pels should be focusing on getting Zion the ball as much as they can, having a ball-stopper like BI is not the best way to do that.  What I'm saying is that you could have gotten a shit ton of return for BI by trading him while his value is still sky high. Get pieces that fit better with Zo and Zion rather than keep BI and let Zo go."
"Graham has been good. Offensively he does exactly what lonzo does, except I‚Äôve seen Devonte actually drive to the basket numerous times so far. We‚Äôd have lonzo do that rarely while also being bad as a primary ball handler in half court. I‚Äôll take what I‚Äôve seen from Devonte so far for half the price of lonzo 10/10 times"
"&gt; Didn't Lonzo himself want out?  So? That's what restricted FA is for, to give small market teams an opportunity to retain players who would rather move to a big market or a winning team.  He is still a glorified 3&amp;D player in Chicago. His role hasn't changed *at all*. They let Zo bring the ball over half court, or push the pace in transition, but he is not the primary playmaker in the half-court. He's an off-ball spot up shooter and secondary playmaker, which is what he's best at, but also exactly what he did in NOLA.  He didn't move for a change of role, he moved for a change of scenery, and a bigger payday."
"Tbh I would much rather Graham at 4/$47 million than Ball at 4/$80. Graham has been solid and provides so much that's been needed that neither Lonzo nor Bledsoe were doing.  Also, I really like Lonzo and have loved his fit on the Bulls from the jump, especially after they got DeRozan too. Bulls are a great team and Lonzo is a great piece for them."
Oh god another one of these threads. JoeBiden2020FTW has like 5 posts on Lonzo ball and the Pels Lol. Anyways time for everyone to overrate Lonzo Ball and ignore the reasoning behind not overpaying him.
Didn't Lonzo himself want out? He was pretty much a glorified 3&amp;D player on that team with Ingram and Zion as the primary ball handlers.
"Do you really need another primary ball handler in the second unit when you'll likely be able to stagger Lonzo, LaVine, DeMar and Vuc's minutes so there'll almost always be one of them on the court?"
"""Lonzo Ball the next Magic"" lmao"
The Lonzo Ball trade was and is baffling and I feel like everyone just glossed over it.
"They don't have an exciting team culture, their culture is amazing but it minimizes player personality and they failed to get back a decent return for Kawhi Leonard. They should have taken Ingram and/or Lonzo Ball and ran away with the picks."
"Good for White.  For the Bulls, he‚Äôs an extremely useful bench piece, but he deserves the opportunity to go out and ball somewhere after being knocked like 5 spots down the totem pole with Lonzo/Derozan/Caruso joining.  I don‚Äôt see him getting anywhere near 32 mpg with the Bulls roster and it‚Äôs bad for a guy that young and with that talent to waste his come up on a team where he‚Äôs not even the fourth option."
"They had a few plays in the 4th against the Grizzlies that showed it off - LeBron at the top of the key with Russ as the roll guy and AD as a shooter/cutter along the baseline. https://twitter.com/LakerFilmRoom/status/1452733779890434048  Feels like the plan for LeBron more off-ball has been consistent since the Lakers got him but execution has been pretty bad in hindsight. First season, they got a bunch of bad fitting ball handlers - Rondo, Beasley, and Lance. Lonzo was there, although he's not really a ball dominant PG. They even gave playmaking duties to Ingram. Rondo as the back-up the next season and we had a lot of dump-offs for AD, with another player bringing the ball up for LeBron. Dennis and THT last season, who can't consistently create for other and we had a lot of injuries. Then, trade for Russ and LeBron working more on his release this off-season to be more of a 3&amp;D guy. He turns 37 in a couple months so, once Russ/LeBron find a balance, being a shooter works seamlessly as far as LeBron coasting on the court.  Offense has been a struggle for every season under Vogel while the defense has been great. This is the weird season where we have offensive players and, currently, the offense is ahead of the defense, although both need plenty of work."
"A few years back (summer 2016), UCLA men‚Äôs played 2 teams in the Australian NBL. UCLA had Lonzo Ball (fr), Aaron Holiday (so) and 2 more later NBA draft picks. UCLA was also a top10 team for that upcoming NCAA season. UCLA lost 1 and won 1. Akaik the NBL is a meaningful notch below Euroleague, which itself is a meaningful notch below NBA."
"connections and name recognition absolutely give some guys unfair advantages over more qualified players who don't get the same chances. lonzo ball, austine rivers, giannis's brother who i don't even know the name of, and many more. there are a lot of guys who can be better but never get the chance. when guys with more of a connection can get much more of a chance. who usually just end up becoming role players or worse."
Lonzo at 43% on the same amount of attempts. Them Ball bros going after the Currys.
Lonzo Ball will become an all-time great laker.
Lonzo Ball would be a top 5 point guard by the end of his 3rd year
"If I had to guess it‚Äôs so LeBron can play more off ball, which is part of why he wanted to play with Lonzo too.  Still a work in progress tho, so we‚Äôll see what happens."
"When Lamelo or Lonzo or whoever the third Ball brother has a baby, I hope they name him/her Baby. Baby Ball. Or just Da‚Ä¶Da Ball."
Who is his help? A ball dominant wing that doesn‚Äôt shoot well? A center that can‚Äôt shoot or space the floor? Lonzo was literally the only piece that actually fit Zion and worked well and they let him go.    I don‚Äôt think you actually understand what it means to build a roster that fits. If I put Shaq on a team with Ben Simmons is it really about the talent at that point? Those two are so incompatible that it actually makes both players far less productive on the court   Zion also didn‚Äôt get to chose the Pelicans. He doesn‚Äôt owe them shit. If they want him to buy in then give him something to buy in for. Just being drafted to a shit franchise doesn‚Äôt mean players owe them anything
Lonzo ball CJ McCollum SGA Dunno JV
Lonzo Ball. His offense has been good but it‚Äôs his defense thats been incredible so far. Like Stacey King said ‚Äúit looks like there are 5 Lonzo‚Äôs out there‚Äù.
"Exactly after Lithuania he came out playing more like Lonzo except he‚Äôs a killer as a scorer. If you look past the ridiculousness of Lavar‚Äôs JBA, what LaMelo was showing was legit. People just didn‚Äôt want to look past the shit that came with Lavar.   But he was a 6‚Äô6 PG with elite playmaking and scoring. He was a triple double threat in the JBA. Ik the comp wasn‚Äôt the best but he carried that play style over when he went to Spire and he played real comp. Averaged a triple double there. I always see people say the NBL changed him so much (I‚Äôm sure it did) but I felt he was always a great prospect even before he went. Especially once he grew to 6‚Äô6. Scouts just didn‚Äôt want to take him seriously because he was a Ball."
"Not on the level of Lonzo or Lamelo, but still a very solid ball player who could provide a spark off the bench for an NBA team."
Bulls got a MEAN 1-2 punch in the PG position for their defense. Lonzo Ball and AC are two top tier PG defenders in the league.      I can see both of them making an NBA Defensive team.
Like I said in the game thread: Vic threw his hand up as if he was gonna go back to get the ball. As soon as Lonzo made the passing motion vuc should of spun around to catch it. I think it was just poor communication on both parts and a great play by Scottie
"This was actually a pretty likely outcome with their schedule:  Pistons, Lonzo Ball Pelicans Revenge Game, Pistons, Raptors.  Not exactly a murders row of opponents, but the Bulls do deserve credit for winning all four games - never an easy task in the NBA, as we can see from the fact that it is Zach Lavine's first career 4 game win streak.  Watching the Bulls in the preseason, I thought they could win 50 games this year -  they had the look of a hungry team that knows they are talented, the type of team that plays hard every night and beats every team they are supposed to beat and about half of the better teams too.  Great additions in Lonzo, Derozan and Caruso. Shored up the point of attack defense, added a true point guard to run the offense and a secondary playmaker and shotmaker in Derozan. Really like what they have done, and Billy Donovan is a great coach to bring it all together.   Can't wait to see how they match up against their next two opponents - two playoff teams from last season in the New York Knicks and Utah Jazz."
&gt;  shooting and defense around them.   Sounds like something Lonzo Ball could do.
"The Bulls starting 5 is LOADED    Lonzo finally being what he's supposed to be (kind of) changes that entire team.   Just loaded   &gt;  And i still don't understand why Lakers let go of CARUSO.   He was far more useful and valuable next to LeBron and AD, compared to Westbrook.  And Caruso was doing damage off the ball, on both ends of the floor.    Westbrook at this point is just a glorified contract that kills your team on the floor and on the books.  He's almost useless without the ball, and if you have LeBron on your team, you wouldn't want anyone else to have the ball, regardless  &gt;  Just a horrendous fit.  They could still make it work, because LeBron is LeBron. He has always done more with less, and maybe he can even elevate Westbrook to a different level.  But it's still a horrible fit   With LeBron and AD, all you need more is SHOOTING and defensive depth.  Westbrook literally gives none of that"
Take a look at Vuc signaling Lonzo to throw a lob pass and then he runs to the ball. Looks like he confused Lonzo
"for sure, they look awesome.  Lonzo is playing the best ball of his career alongside multiple guys who can create their own shots at will.  AC/Lonzo are a devastating defensive backcourt"
"Morant and lamelo ball. Those guys are just fun to watch.  But i also like watching the previous young lakers core. (Lonzo, ingram, randle, caruso)"
We really haven‚Äôt gotten a good look at how well our offense can play because Lavine hasn‚Äôt really looked to score at all for the last couple games. Seems like he‚Äôs finding ways to score primarily off the ball but Vuc/Lonzo/DeMar have been getting better looks and taking them.
"Yeah it ain't no ""Lonzo Ball"" anymore. There's only Lamelo's older brother"
"His assist to turnover ratio is better than most elite playmakers like Luka etc. People like Jokic and CP3 are better in that regard I believe but they‚Äôre exceptions   Also none of those guys minus Jrue handle the ball as much, and frankly Lonzo doesn‚Äôt even play like a PG. He‚Äôs a 3+D wing who can do transition passing, but he‚Äôs awful in the halfcourt. Caruso isn‚Äôt a primary ball handler either regardless of his manscaped commercials"
"I get what you are saying and you are not exactly wrong, but I watched Jrue and Ball for years. Lonzo is not like a taller Jrue. Lonzo does what he does better than anyone because what he does is unique. But sometimes that leads to overstating how good it is comparative to what else is out there."
"You also take into consideration the money attached to him. Even then, he's like a hard carry where he needs tons of time and space for him to pop off. In an era where ball movement, shooting and efficiency is the key to winning games, he's not ideal.   He causes a lot of turnovers as a primary ball hander which you don't see with other elite points and heck lets go even lower. You don't see that shit with Jrue Holidays, Cam Payne, Lonzo, Caruso etc."
"I don't think Lavar is actually like that in real life, I think we all know by now that he's just playing a character for the press. I mean, it kinda worked too (tbh Lonzo and Melo were both five star prospects out of high school but the Ball family hit a next level of buzz when he started making the news rounds)."
Lonzo Ball
"I thought we knew this with Lonzo. Dude seemed like the nicest kid even his rookie year. Just wanted to play ball, nothing more"
Ish smith for lonzo ball and Zach Levine
"Griffin hasn't done much good since the summer of of 2014, and even then, it's like he was the reason LeBron came back to Cleveland. I think LeBron was always going to go back (his legacy took too much of a hit for him in leaving the first time).  Moving on from Lonzo was a necessary step (he's a fast-break starter, not a floor general, which is what the Pelicans desperately needed), but they weren't going to be realistic players for guys like Lowry. Griffin's biggest mistake is he keeps signing veterans with questionable fit (Bledsoe, Adams, JV) and it's keeping them from having the flexibility to go after their real needs.  The path forward is going to require drafting and developing from within. Ingram is a movable piece, and one that I believe should be dangled to try get a guy like SGA or some other future stud PG. Easier said than done, but Ingram is fool's gold, and the Pels need to start thinking about how to build around Zion as a small-ball 5."
"The construction of the roster is perfect for Lonzo, it allows him to just make the right pass and facilitate the flow with everyone in rhythm, but he doesn‚Äôt have to force the issue or carry to heavy of a playmaking load. It can be pretty democratic/equal opportunity like the offense he had at UCLA. It‚Äôs why I was hoping he‚Äôd still be around when we signed some stars, because he‚Äôs a great PG to play with other scorers since he doesn‚Äôt need to over dribble/possess the ball a long time the way Russ usually does."
Jokic eats Giannis alive. Lonzo ball legit gives joker more problems than Greek and Gobert because refs allow guards to hack Jokic.
"PG defense is probably the second most important behind the Center.  When the other team's primary ball handler can initiate the offense unmolested, the defense is scrambling the whole possession to recover from the open man or mismatch.   What the first action leads to zero advantage and the defense is still completely set, all of a sudden it's the offense that starts scrambling to create a good shot before time runs out.  The difference between Coby White to Lonzo is literally going from bottom 5 to top 5."
"I‚Äôve said this on free agency, and I got downvoted a lot. And some idiot said they would rather have Tomas Santoransky than Lonzo Ball."
"Lonzo and AC‚Äîtwo high IQ rhythm disruptors. Any coaches dream, any opposing coaches nightmare. Length to guard 1-4, high activity level on both ends (marked improvement from Lonzo in this regard).   Speaking of rhythm, I would say Vuc is still finding his, which is understandable. And I know it‚Äôs early, but Ball has never looked this confident to start a season. Donovan believes in him, and is it a stretch to say his other lead guard is not as ball dominant as in times past? There is just so much to like about this team. We‚Äôll see what happens when they face stronger competition."
"But they **didn‚Äôt**. That‚Äôs just the facts my friend. None of the players from the 90s have enough shooting to be good players today. If you just magically give huge skill boosts to the 90s players, then don‚Äôt give the same type of boost to the modern players, what kind of nonsense comparison are you making? The whole point here is we are comparing the players as they were. As they were, Jordan would be a pretty shit shooter by today‚Äôs standards. He is a career 32% 3pt shooter. He is in the same category of shooters as guys like Lonzo Ball, DeMar DeRozan, or Draymond Green. Jordan is a guard type player who makes his buckets in the midrange. It‚Äôs just simply trash skills by today‚Äôs standards. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good you are at taking midrange pull-ups, they are not good shots compared to 3s."
"As a Bulls fan, I was shocked, like physically shook, when I learned the details of the sign and trade for Lonzo. Like, this is some NFL Bill O‚ÄôBrian worthy of bad trades. We didn‚Äôt give up any assets of worth and got Lonzo Ball. How the hell does that happen?"
i thought that was lonzo ball in the middle of it lol
"This is definitely a hot take considering Zion hasn‚Äôt played with the current roster. Also gram/naw were lighting it up from 3 point prior to this game so theres your spacing for Zion even tho he‚Äôs been injured. Speaking of its pretty hard to build a contender when your ‚Äúgenerational talent‚Äù plays in almost 50% of games over a 2 year stretch.  And naw shows flashes of being a shot creator/3 and D player depending on how he develops.   Also, Lonzo either was used incorrectly in New Orleans or didn‚Äôt fit in well.  As a fan that watch more than my fair share of the pelicans with lonzo I can tell you it didn‚Äôt look like he fit on the court. He‚Äôs a very spotty shooter who has the ability to get hot. He can‚Äôt run an offense very well in the half court. I will say his lob threat and ability to push the ball in transition were valuable to our team, but overall I think he needed to go to a better situation.   All that being said I do think this year/next year is make or break for griff. We need continuity when it comes to player personnel and coaching and if we don‚Äôt start to build team chemistry then I believe he failed at building a contending team around Zion."
Lonzo did not want to be on the team..if you watched Ball in the Family you'd know this
"Maybe the Pels would've kept Ball if he was asking for 72 over 4 years rather than 85 over 4 years. We don't know what the situation was with Ball and the Pels though, he might've been pushing really hard to get out of New Orleans and it may not be worth it to force a guy to stay who wants no part in your franchise. JV might be better than ball and Graham is a decent player, you can argue Lonzo is a better fit for the team, but in a vacuum JV and Graham combined is more valuable then Ball. That guy who said he should have gotten 100 mill for 4 years is insane tho, 25 mill a year for Lonzo fucking Ball, lmao."
I refuse to believe any of you actually watch Lonzo Ball play basketball.
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù DeMar DeRozan gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lonzo Ball belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Alex Caruso hit the locker room door, NBA star Zach Lavine hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
"I basically try to never expect anything from 2nd rounders after how often I‚Äôve seen fans get hyped for nobodies, but he has been impressive in short spurts. He brings a lot of energy and activeness on defense. That small ball lineup with him, Lonzo, and Caruso is smothering"
"Lonzo ball is the second best player on the Bulls, change my mind"
Lonzo ball is nothing like Booker
"Lonzo got nothing but Ball, damn."
"You typed all that just to show your salt, I watch a good amount of Pels games Pels are my West team.   The Pels had the ability to put themselves in play for Lowry too if they kept Zo, trust me I spent a good amount of time working with their cap and possibilities lol. You clearly didn‚Äôt. As someone who watches the Pels, you should be aware that Lonzo is someone who needs a half court ball handler and playmaker next to him.   Zo in the halfcourt is not a true PG, again you should know that. He‚Äôd fit just fine with a dynamic shooter and creator like Graham. You literally made up that comp to Dame/CJ yourself that‚Äôs a garbage comparison lmao. And Zo played in his 5th highest scoring game so that‚Äôs just false, and you‚Äôd also be smart to look at the dates of those games and maybe just come to the conclusion that Zion was hitting his stride? And a major part of the point is that Zion basically asked the FO to bring him back publicly and they didn‚Äôt lol"
"Not at all what I‚Äôm saying. Usually the scoring title goes to an elite scorer who doesn‚Äôt have many other options scoring wise on the team. Look at Curry 2020, Durant‚Äôs titles were when Westbrook was hurt for extended time, Melo in NY, Harden when CP3 and Capela missed time (Averaged 40)  Lavine has other good scoring teammates that demand the ball: Derozan, Vucevic, and sometimes Lonzo   But of course, I just get downvoted for ‚Äúhating‚Äù classic Reddit"
"&gt;*Just twisting a knife lol*  I mean you're not really.  I'm very pro-fire David Griffin, but Lonzo Ball thought he should hold the ball more than Zion Williamson in the half-court so that would be a bit of an issue for our team. lol.  I want one of the best paint scorers in the league who pulls four defenders into the paint with him to hold the ball in the half-court. Zo didn't like Point Zion."
"I don‚Äôt get it though, why did he not fit well? From what I saw, Lonzo-Zion was a perfect fit and Lonzo is capable of playing off ball letting BI &amp; Zion handle the rock more. Idk I thought he was perfect, at least way better than Graham is"
"The first moments of the offseason, the fan base was basically divided between Lonzo and Lowry. Then came the DeRozan hype and some small Dinwiddie steam, but at first, a good portion of the fanbase (myself included) wanted Lonzo.   I still think that what'll hinder us is having just Luka as a passer. Our 2nd unit would benefit a lot by having a willing passer to pair alongside Brunson. Kidd tried to have Sterling Brown as a secondary ball handler to Brunson in the preseason, but this is obviously a break the glass situation. We had to get Lonzo and, since it failed, we had to get Dragic at least.   We have good, switchable wing defenders, we have two good backcourt defenders, but if Kidd wants to see off-ball Luka (which is good. Off-ball Luka means the best defender on the other team won't be on on-ball defense and will be easier to be switched out), we had to go grab a 8+AST guy and rotate him, Luka and Brunson on the backcourt."

"Two words:  LONZO BALL, DEMAR DEROZAN, ZACH LAVINE, NIKOLA VUCEVIC, ALEX CARUSO. MUST SEE TV"
"Ingram Randle Lonzo Hart would be great together right now, they were showing signs of that in 2018 season with Kuzma too. That small ball lineup was fun. Brook Lopez spacing the floor from the C position next to Nance and Randle was nice. I really thought PG would come and fill the leader role at the SG position instead of KCP and that team would be a contender in a year or two. Well having Davis and Lebron is also nice."
"A traditional point guard to me is someone who is able to break down their defender and create shots for the whole team, especially in a half court setting. In modern age, your point guard probably also has to be able to make his own shot and at least be a threat at all levels. Lonzo can‚Äôt break down his defender due to his lack of handle, he can‚Äôt drive, he doesn‚Äôt get to the line, and he rarely creates his own shot (he does have that step back though, but it‚Äôs used maybe twice a game).   So yeah, when majority of his shots are catch and shoot 3s and he‚Äôs not the ball handler in half court, he‚Äôs not a PG."
Last year the Pels very rarely got out in transition and less and less used Lonzo as the primary facilitator. This led to Lonzo being used as a 3 and D guard who‚Äôd throw lobs to Zion and set up post ups for BI when he got the ball. He wasn‚Äôt used the absolute worst but I‚Äôve always thought facilitating and transition were his 2 massive skill sets on offense‚Ä¶ not a spot up shooter in a low paced offense.
"&gt;This guy works on his game every single year .....His only glaring flaw is his ball handling which is already better than previous years   Here's the thing, he was hurt coming into at least 2 different seasons and had an incredibly bad sprain when him and bron were starting to jell.   Lonzo got memed to death but when he's actually had time to work on his game and not get side tracked by injury. He's been fantastic and getting more consistent"
He doesn‚Äôt care about the stats. Both Ball Brothers jus Hoop to Win. But Lamelo will Take over unlike Lonzo. Tonight was Oubre nd Hayward night tho so why not feed them build they confidence so when Lamelo does start to use his green light they won‚Äôt be bitching nd putting their heads down.
"I'm trying to think of a few players who could improve the team and here's what I've come up with: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, and Montrezl Harrell."
"Lonzo took the ball up the court and that‚Äôs about it. That doesn‚Äôt make you a point guard. Pretty much on every offensive possession he was sitting on the 3 pt while someone else had the ball, doing the playmaking."
"Pelicans had three major issues last year, turnovers, defense, and end of game offense. It really feels like they managed to get worse on defense and turnovers, and maybe better at late game offense since they got JV. You just can't be a good team with the level of defense that they play, it's too easy to score against them and it'll be even worse when Zion comes back. I am not gonna harp on the Lonzo Ball stuff since no one is going to change their minds at this point, but I feel like they really could have used his 0 turnovers, 3 steals and overall defensive intensity/size.   On a bright note it seems like the starting guards can hit their threes so far based off of the games played this year, they're gonna have another amazing offensive team yet again this year, but can you even sniff the playoffs with that kind of defense? Not like Lonzo was a lock down defender though, the issue really stems from BI and Zion and their lack of a defensive center.    I just find it hard to believe that they'll just outscore everyone into the playoffs especially when they're going to struggle with turn overs all year long. Either Green is some sort of defensive wizard that'll turn them into a good defensive team, BI needs to fucking step-up on defense alongside Zion, or else it just feels like it'll be last year all over again for them."
"I‚Äôm already starting the Lonzo Ball first team defense campaign. He is legit that good. Pelican fans had me thinking he was over rated defensively when it‚Äôs the opposite. His length, quickness, effort, instincts, IQ are all elite. He literally forces point guards to be spot up shooters lol"
I don‚Äôt ever wanna hear Lonzo is atrocious in the half court. This guy works on his game every single year - Hes gonna be one of the best all around point guards in the league. His only glaring flaw is his ball handling which is already better than previous years
"Lonzo can play on a team without the ball in his hands all the time and be a positive player. He‚Äôs a much better defender, and is a much bigger threat from 3. Westbrook was a horrific stylistic fit for the Lakers, better then Lonzo or not."
"Nikola Vucevic yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Lonzo Ball gave a look of pleasant surprise. Alex Caruso belted, ‚ÄúWe got a fucking squad now.‚Äù And before Zach Lavine hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Felicio hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
I take back everything I‚Äôve said about Lonzo ball
"LaMelo still doing that Chino Hills thing of instantly pushing the ball. Easy cherry pick to undo that dunk straight away. I love that, see Lonzo always looking up early too"
Because he isn't Lonzo Ball or Zach LaVine.
Current Lonzo ball
Lonzo Ball joining the Bulls
Lonzo Ball. Along with 2nd all defensive team for him
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
They were which speaks volumes to his talent because just watching how he played in AS season and now vs last year you can tell it wasn‚Äôt his game to be ball dominant. SVG switched Zo and BIs roles for no good reason (Meaning Being the playmaker ball handler went to BI and offball Hero went to lonzo when it should have been the opposite. Fuck SVGü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
Lonzo Ball still hurts to this day. Wanted to see him in purple and gold forever

Try to convince someone in 2019 that Lonzo Ball would be one of the best 3 point shooters in the league.
Honestly.  last year vs this year:  I would rather have Tae in the half court as a secondary play maker vs Lonzo making a few plays in transition (that we already do pretty well this year) and mostly being a spot up shooter in the half court game.  People dont realize that BI is better off ball than on so we really lacked a natural secondary playmaker after zion last year.  Tae works in that space where Zo didnt at all.
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
Lonzo Ball les gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"I don‚Äôt want to get into an argument, but me talking about him here has no effect on anything whatsoever, so how is the attention he‚Äôs getting in this thread relevant to anything? It isn‚Äôt helping the Ball children, it‚Äôs not making him any $, it‚Äôs doing nothing positive for anyone. It‚Äôs not doing anything tangibly negative either, so again, if Lavar‚Äôs antics are genius because they get people talking about him or his kids on Internet forums, than maybe I have a different idea of what genius is than others. Lonzo was a top pick regardless, so he‚Äôd be talked about and known by NBA fans anyway. Lamelo looks to be easily on his way to being an all-star, so he‚Äôd be talked about and known as well. There‚Äôs nothing tangible you can attribute to Lavar‚Äôs antics, so this is really just a thought experiment either way.     I think your definition of genius is pretty broad and much easier to attain than it should be. I think Lavar is a pretty ridiculous public figure. And I think we just disagree on it, which is fine.    As an aside, I don‚Äôt know anything about the Pet Rock ‚Äòinventor‚Äô, but I do think it‚Äôs a stupid ass thing. But according to Wikipedia, the fad lasted 6 months, the rock costs $4, so it is what it is. If your line of thinking is that it‚Äôs genius to market idiocy to idiots, than you probably think demagogues are geniuses too. Again, I‚Äôd disagree, but we‚Äôre just two anonymous strangers, so who cares."
"been a while since i posted but i‚Äôll explain it. Lonzo wanted to be used differently and bring the ball up more often. At this time, we were using both BI and Point Zion to play as the primary ball handlers and Lonzo kind of became a 3&amp;D wing with some playmaking. They took the ball out of Zo‚Äôs hands because he kind of didn‚Äôt deliver ( he was bad at this, look at how he performed in the bubble. )  Pelicans fanbase divided into Lonzo stans and anti Lonzo stans. So most of the fans you‚Äôre talking about wanted Lonzo gone because his stans were annoying to deal with according to them"
"I‚Äôm not convinced Lonzo can palm the ball. He‚Äôs had some weird cradle looking dunk attempts that haven‚Äôt always gone in, including two last game. One he got swatted on, the other turned into a layup."
"My personal picks:  3-POINT SHOOTOUT: Jonas Valanciunas, Stephen Curry, Seth Curry, Lonzo Ball, Carmelo Anthony, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Darius Garland, Christian Wood  DUNK CONTEST: Daniel Gafford, Anfernee Simons, Anthony Edwards, Javonte Green  SKILLS CHALLENGE: Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Kuzma, Evan Mobley, Tyler Herro, Kevin Porter Jr."

"The Pelicans do not have a shooting coach. Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Jrue Holiday, and Jonas Valunciunas all had their shot naturally improve as a result of the humid weather and spicy food here in New Orleans. Please stop referring to and inquiring about some guy named Fred (who I can assure you I've never heard of)"
"Who's filling out the SF, PF, and C spots? If it's just role players, then they're a non-playoff team. If you put a good All-Star next to them (i.e Paul George, healthy Zion, Butler, etc.), I'd say 2nd round exit.   A good, fun, contending lineup for the Ball bros would be:  Lamelo, Lonzo, Paul George, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bam Adebayo  LiAngelo is your 11th/12th man"
"&gt; I‚Äôll admit I was a hater on the ball brothers before, especially when it looked like Lonzo was a borderline bust(relative to where he was drafted) on the lakers. Obviously things have changed and Lonzo has become a pretty damn good player. I‚Äôm shocked he was able to change his shot and become a good shooter to be honest  Man I can't even finish reading this because of how frustrated I am at how dumb yall are...WATCH THE GAMES AND NOT ESPN+BOXSCORE+R/NBA NARRATIVES GODDAMN  Like I'm sorry to be so harsh but for myself and a lot of others, it is *not shocking whatsoever* that Lonzo is doing what he's doing now"
"&gt;was just saying outrageous stuff for publicity. This guy managed to get 3 sons to play professionally  I don't know that I think he's ""bad"", but there certainly is a lot to be desired from how he portrays himself, and I'd argue that with the exception of LiAngelo, he probably has hurt more than helped as far as their careers.  I do think the publicity and exposure for LiAngelo helped a fair bit.       With that said, your comment made me realize that they are just the modern day Barry's.   Rick was a vocal jerk too, and got 5!! kids playing pro-ball.       In this scenario Brent == LaMelo, Jon == Lonzo, and Canyon/Drew/Scooter == LiAngelo."
"I‚Äôve been saying this for a while, but they need shooters. Their offense flowed better when Pritchard was hitting shots last year. He‚Äôs totally disappeared but Grant Williams has been shooting it well this year. But having 1 guy over 40% isn‚Äôt enough of a threat to worry about the perimeter when Tatum has the ball. It‚Äôs harder for him to drive, pass, or get open looks. He loves to iso and he‚Äôs just not really quick. He‚Äôll sometimes beat guys off the dribble but he‚Äôs not automatic like Durant so he‚Äôs inconsistent with making the most of it. Sometimes he‚Äôs on, sometimes he‚Äôs off.  So I think it‚Äôs a combination of Tatum has to change the way he approaches the game and be less concerned about scoring, but they also need better personnel that allows him to do that so it‚Äôs easier for him to be a lethal scorer.  I love the hustle of our defense and totally get what they were aiming to do with adding solid defensive guys, but if you swap out someone like Josh Richardson with Buddy Hield, Dennis Schroder with Luke Kennard, and Robert Williams with Myles Turner, not only are those upgrades that on paper the whole team looks better, but I bet you it would make Tatum individually look a LOT better.  I totally get the point about a playmaker (Rubio and Lonzo were brought up a lot over the summer), but if there‚Äôs no one to pass to, how are they creating offense? Tatum has been better at cutting but Brown still stands around a LOT and makes it easier on his defenders. It‚Äôs when he has the ball or is in transition that he beats guys 1-on-1 and gets a lot of his points. Catch and shoot he‚Äôs good too, but just does it less since becoming a more complete scorer.  Just an overall observation, but I think with the way the Celtics run their offense, shooters would help elevate them and make more impact for the way that Tatum and Brown play."
"Except you‚Äôre comparing attempted fgs (by him) to made fgs (off his passes). Assists don‚Äôt tell you how much a player is passing to his teammates. Passing stats seem more relevant if you‚Äôre arguing Tatum should make an effort to pass more.  Per game, Tatum is passed to 48.8 times and passes to a teammate 43.6 times - a difference of 5.2. Compare that to   Passes to Booker per game: 44.9 Passes from Booker per game: 26.3  Passes to Trae per game: 74.1 Passes from Trae per game: 53.6  Passes to Luka per game: 72.7 Passes from Luka per game: 58.1  Passes to PG per game: 60.8 Passes from PG per game:  A few examples of many players who pass the ball less relative to how often it‚Äôs passed to them than Tatum. Of course there are plenty of others where the opposite is true.  Jokic and Lonzo both pass more than they‚Äôre passed to. Lowry gets passed the ball 65.7 times and passes it 65.4 times a game. But Tatum does pretty damn well compared to most other stars and near star players."
Who does this guy think he is? Lonzo Ball?
"No he doesn't, and its no disrespect to him because he's turned himself in to a very good help and off ball defender. Complete pest on the defensive end now, but he's a tier below the Lonzo/Smart/Jrue/Thybulle's of the world"
Lonzo Ball
"My response was a rebuttal. Don't know how you got a bizarre emotional take from that, but whatever.  The Bulls record is nice at 13-8, much better than most people thought. I've said it since the offseason, though: the Ball/Caruso backcourt is not going to produce at the level they are being paid. The difference between the two is that Caruso is a clear bench piece, and he excels in that role. Ball is supposed to be a game-changing point guard, but 5 years in, he's still looks lost in the half-court.  I said in the summer this signing is going to hurt the Bulls in the long run, because you've got $20 million annum tied up into a player that's never going to be a $20 million player. This summer, Jalen Brunson (for example) is going to be an UFA, and he is a far superior point guard than Lonzo has ever been. Brunson would be the perfect half-court guy for the Bulls, but the team is currently hard-capped, and Lavine is in line for a huge pay raise, meaning the Bulls have no shot at improving through free agency this summer.  You may not want to hear it, but Lonzo's contract is going to put a hard limit on this team's ceiling. I would be very surprised if he finished this contract in Chicago."
Could you imagine if someone had a team of players like:  Lonzo Ball  D'Angelo Russell  Brandon Ingram  Julius Randle  Kyle Kuzma  ?
The excuses that get made for Lonzo Ball are hilarious.  Dude made a horrendous play here
"Fun fact: The lakers drafted Julius Randle, Jordan Clark, Lonzo Ball, D‚ÄôAngelo Russel, and Brandon Ingram. All of them got better the second they left the lakers so Bridges is a lucky man. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs saying thank you Jim Buss for saving his career."

Lonzo has taken 8 free throws all year. Astonishing numbers for someone with his ball handling ability.
"Yeah, he was taking good shots throughout the game when he got the ball.   People just hate Lonzo."
"Lonzo Ball is an absolutely excellent PG and role player, but LaMelo ball is already easily the better player.  EDIT: Lonzo is a 22 million per year contract player, and LaMelo is a max contract type of player. Both, the Bulls and the Hornets are extremly happy with what they got."
10 years from now Lonzo might be coming off the bench or a 3 and D catch and shoot SG next to a ball handler.
LaMelo is already better. In the next 10 minutes. I never saw it coming but here we are.  No disrespect to Lonzo either but he's never gonna be an All Star PG like Melo might be.   After all the Ball family drama I'm amazed 2/3 worked out so well. Apparently LaVar isn't a *complete* moron.
"Legit Question: At what point will Bulls fans expect more from Lonzo? I really feel like keeps getting exposed in the half court, especially in the 4th quarter. If he were an off-the-bench guy, I don't think anyone would mind, but a supposed Top-75 player making $20+ million a year should be doing more than 12/5/5. I know people will say ""His defense is ELITE"", but he had an opportunity late to make it a 1-possession game, but he bull-rushed the ball down the court, made zero-leverage passes, then threw the ball away."
"Getting to the free throws line is an extremely efficient way to score and it is in a players control when you zoom out into a large sample size   Some players have the ability to get there a lot, some don‚Äôt. Compare Dwayne wade vs lonzo ball‚Ä¶ one gets to the line way more"
Lonzo Ball would have been nice on this team.
"I just think it makes more sense to be mad at the sports media, or the Lakers themselves for spending so much money, leveraging their position in LA to attract players. As far as I can tell, Laker fans are pretty well behaved on this board.   Lakers fans are actually pretty laid back compared to other fan bases. And Caruso actually being good should give us some vindication that we‚Äôre not just making stuff up.   In the last decade, we signed Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng to massive deals, were horrible for a long time, then traded away our entire future for one bubble ring. And now we‚Äôll need to rebuild. We‚Äôre stuck with Westbrook next year too, and he‚Äôs owed 50 million. Our roster could be Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Zubac, with Alex Caruso coming off the bench. Instead we have the retirement home.  It‚Äôs been a tough run for the Lakers too."
There have been wars between Lonzo Ball stans and Pelicans fans haha.  I honestly don't think it has much to do with the actual player at this point.

"It's not that they choose to play hero ball it's that they don't have the ability to play anything else. Tatum is not good enough to be the main ball handler yet, but they have no other options. Smart is the best passer on the team, but he is so inconsistent at scoring that having him be the main ball handler would just give you bad shots from Smart instead. Brown is a terrible ball handler. His handles while improving aren't anything to write home about, his court vision is worse than Tatum's and his passing ability is also worse. Dennis is decent at it, but not a long term solution. Their best catch and shoot player from 3 is also their best ball handler.   It's why losing Kemba and Hayward were so devastating for the team. Hayward especially was a good ball handler that just filled in the holes for the Celtics. Kemba's knees turned to jelly towards the end, but his first season with the Celtics showed what the team should look like. Danny Ainge tried to fill this hole with a ton of picks like Carsen Edwards, Tremont Waters, and Payton Pritchard. Pritchard shows promise, but he's 2 years away from being 2 years away. They really need a passing pg who can keep defenses honest or get downhill like Lonzo or DJ Murray."
lonzo ball   zach lavine   demar   caruso   vucevic
"Except he isn't...  Please go look at this year's advanced stats and per 36 stats.  Lonzo is a better rebounder and a better shooting percentage, and I'll give you a better off ball defender...  But that's about it.  Graham's numbers back up he's the better passer.  His ast to turnover rate is better, he's even on assist per 36, and his assist rate is better than Zo... Even with Zo in a better situation to be assisting the year so far vs Graham.  So no, not a better passer... He's a flashier passer, but that doesn't translate to more successful."
Lonzo Ball could never
"They always struggle with efficiency. Dug this up from when I looked into this in the past about some guards. This was through their first 27 games, so a bigger sample of bad play and  more time for the guys I'm about to list to actually turn the corner so unfair to the current crop:  Trae Young: 16/3/7 with 4tos on atrocious 38/25/78 splits   DLo: 12/4/4 with 1.5 A:TO on 40/31/71 splits   Lonzo Ball: 9/7/7 on 33/27/49 splits   De'Aaron Fox: 10/3/4 on 41/30/68 splits   Jamal Murray: 10/3/2 on 38/36/83 splits  Throwing in some more guys now through 20 games(\~what today's rookies have played so far):  Darius Garland: 11/2/3 on 48%TS  Ant: 14/3/2 on 47%TS  One-and-Done guards are going to play horribly out the gate. We go through this cycle of being shocked every year. Stop being shocked. The guys who came out the gate notably well in the past like Luka and Ja are not only the exceptions, but also come from a different background one having played pros and other being a sophomore."
"I never doubted Lonzo Ball (4th year) even with his Los Angeles Lakes &amp; New Orleans Pelicans playing days. I believed in his work ethics and ability to continuously improve. His shooting form changed being a testament as well as his defensive capabilities. Over the years, he worked on this game.  Meanwhile Ben Simmons (5th year) cant even shoot."
It‚Äôs actually the first time it‚Äôs ever been done by a guy named Lonzo ball on Friday November 26th so nope
There was a stretch of like 3 possessions where we just threw the ball at Lonzo and Caruso repeatedly
"He's barely 19 years old. He's not the finished product. We've seen with guys like Lonzo Ball that shooting form and consistency can be improved. If he was given the reigns as the Thunder's point guard, instead of spending a lot of time off the ball due to SGA, Ty Jerome, etc., and had teammates who could finish better, he'd be close to leading the NBA in assists as a teenaged rookie."
He's barely 19 years old. He's not the finished product. We've seen with guys like Lonzo Ball that shooting form and consistency can be improved.
Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso
"Lmao literally every person here is like ""Fox is better but I would want Lonzo on my team..."" gimme that Ball boy!"
"Klay Thompson? Ball handler? The same Klay Thompson who famously scored 60 points on just 11 dribbles?  He's not a ball handler first and he is probably one of the best off-ball movers in the game. He doesn't need the ball in his hands to make plays, he's a catch and shoot player. He's already next to Steph who is another one of best at moving off the ball.  Put them both next to Lonzo and you have ridiculous playmaking to set up ridiculous shooters."
"Fox is the better player but Lonzo Ball can literally be plug to any team right now. If these 2 are FA, I think Lonzo will be the most sought after."
Imagine Lonzo with his defense as a secondary ball handler next to Steph and Klay?
Wiggins comes close to doing what Fox can do. Having Lonzo would solve the bench playmaker issue and allow Poole to be a ball handling SG rather than a PG. Bjelica is pretty good at playmaking off the bench but he can be abused in some matchups
"It‚Äôs because Fox is garbage right now. The extra 7 points he scores with poor efficiency doesn‚Äôt get close to making up the *massive* difference in defense.  Lonzo has made the jump to an elite defender, on ball and off ball. Fox doesn‚Äôt give a shit about that side of the ball, and when he does he still gets burned cause he‚Äôs fucking trash at it."
Depends. The Blazers rather have Lonzo Ball.
"hard disagree. Lonzo falls straight down and braces for the fall. KPJ is looking at the ball and trips on Lonzo afterwards. Falling down is enough from Lonzo if he's flopping to try and draw a foul. there is zero reason for him to trip KPJ, or fall into him on top of that.  there is no offensive foul here."
Lonzo Ball? More like Lonzo Bad call
Lonzo Ball: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a jerk‚Äù  KPJ: ‚ÄúI know‚Äù   ü§£
"From hamper legend to hardcourt legend, a Lonzo Ball story."
Rockets killer Lonzo Ball.
Am I reading this right or are you calling lonzo Ball an elite scorer?
"And yet he hasn't done shit about his short-comings. Actions speak louder than words. Look at someone like Lonzo Ball. People roasted him for being a bad shooter. He somehow managed to turn himself to one of the best shooters in the league. Thats the tangible ""taking ownership and getting better"" that im talking about. Not lip service about him having a bad series (even though he also blamed Embiid about the fit)"
"Just pathetic. And to think the Lakers once had Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart - all of whom are decent to good players. All traded away."
"Keep Westbrook.  Trade James to Cleveland for K-Love.  Grab Cassius Stanley and Dorsey and a bunch of other fuckers born in LA.  Trade Unibrow for Lonzo Ball.  Hire Steve Lavin as head coach.    Trade all the other pieces for Klay Thompson. Then sign Jason Kapono. Make both Kapono and Thompson wear headbands, and let the announcers try to figure out which one is which.   Lose Championship #18 to the Hornets in 5."
"I hate that the lakers drafted lonzo ball a couple years back. He‚Äôs doing doing better now, but he came into the league not knowing how to shoot a basketball. Still don‚Äôt like him"
It felt good watching Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso torch the Lakers.
Lonzo ball is better than russel Westbrook
"Haliburton and lonzo ball, they arent stars, they cant create their own shot but they are good role players, especially lonzo because he is a really good defender"
Lonzo Ball this season: 12/5/5 in 35 min  12 PPG  40.2% FG  42.1% 3P (6.7 3PAPG)  34.8 MPG  5.2 RPG  4.5 APG  .5 BPM  A great season by him as the Bulls are the #2 team in the East with a +3.2 point differential
"&gt;If a fight broke out every time someone got smacked in the face the league   We both know it wasn‚Äôt just a smack in the face. The dude got intentionally punched in the face and was profusely bleeding which then triggered a fight or flight response.   If he had been all sunshine and roses after getting hit that would‚Äôve been more concerning than him trying to go after the guy that just clocked him.   We saw Jokic do the same thing to Morris when he made a dirty play on him, and I promise you if that Joel punch a few weeks ago had connected on Lonzo Ball we would‚Äôve saw Joel Embiid get jumped on live television.   What‚Äôs not reasonable is the leagues‚Äô leniency on dirty plays despite them claiming to want and avoid situations like this."
"The Lonzo thing was definitely hate but also definitely more about his dad and the sneaker nonsense than him being a Laker. The Ball brothers have played their way into our hearts, but that could have happened on the Lakers."
"&gt; he and Lavine together, with Lonzo and Caruso playing off ball   Most fun brand of basketball I've watched since the emergence of the Warriors.  Loved the Bucks in recent years, and the Suns last year, but I wouldn't call it ""fun"". Jazz is pleasing to watch from a basketball perspective, like the Spurs.  But this Demar/Lavine/Lonzo/Caruso core is just so damn fun to watch."
"It's definitely not inefficient when you surround yourself with shooters like the Bulls have surrounded Demar. It's almost like he and Lavine together, with Lonzo and Caruso playing off ball is #1 seed worthy."
"Depends on your teams structure. Lonzo is like Klay Thompson if he was a worse shooter but a great playmaker. Can‚Äôt rely on Lonzo to create anything off the dribble consistently. If you‚Äôve got multiple other ball handlers on your roster, then Lonzo. If you need a lead ball handler, then Fox."
"I think two stars are needed for a contending team. I don't think Lonzo can be a second option on a contending team. From what other comments are saying, fox can be a second option.  Lonzo is in a good spot and he is way more efficient when he shoots the ball when he's feeling it instead of forcing up shots."
"Thank you lol, Lonzo is an awesome role player, and is definitely easier to fit into any team than Fox who is much more ball-dominant, but there is no team in The league that should choose Zo over Fox. Like, this Bulls team with a lineup of Fox/Lavine/Derozan/Pat Will (when healthy) and Vuc is a significantly better team than this current Bulls team (which is already great)."
"Lonzo: 15/5/6, great defense, 55%TS, doesn‚Äôt require the ball to be effective    Dennis: 15/4/6, awful defense, 54%TS, playoff choker, nearly useless off ball    Lonzo is better and is younger and has more potential. He‚Äôs also not the diva/idiot that Dennis is"
Lonzo is a top tier defender and a much better off-ball player. And he's significantly younger.
"lonzo is a much better 3 pt shooter and doesn't need to be as ball dominant. Younger, much more versatile and valuable"
Lonzo ball is making some major upgrades to his shooting this year
Lonzo Ball.  When he entered the league I thought he was a cocky punk that didn't really deserve the #1 because it was manufactured (masterfully) hype.  Now I think he's an amazing team player and any team would be lucky to have him.
"5 team trade:  NYK Gets: Lebron  NOP Gets: AD, Westbrook  MIN Gets: THT, 1st round pick in 2028  CHI Gets: Carmelo, Malik Monk, and 1st round pick in 2030  LAL Gets: **Julius Randle, DAngelo Rusell, Brandon Ingram, Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball**"

"And Magic drafted Lonzo Ball over this dude because he believed on the fabricated hype smh That shit still upsets me, how can anyone in their right mind could fall for Lavar's bullshit? At least LaMelo is showing some sparks, but Lonzo never looked like a top 3 draft pick then, neither he looks nowadays, Magic was a complete idiot"

"If only y‚Äôall drafted Lonzo Ball man he‚Äôs a great player, could‚Äôve really used his defense and shooting."
"Pretty bad so far but based on his career numbers it'll go up to close to 50%, especially if he stops trying to hit the fading middies.  And yeah, the Bulls have two all stars that handle the ball often so Lonzo doesn't get big assist numbers. He doesn't hunt for assists either, if hockey assists were tracked in the nba his numbers would look much better.   Are Ingram and Zion just bad at moving the ball and running the offense? Cause granted it's only been 15 or so games but what I've seen from Lonzo is an unselfish, elite 3 and d pg who can guard 1-3 and some 4s with amazing vision. I haven't watched much of the pelicans at all but I don't see how he wouldn't be a good fit."

"I think it's pretty much already reversed. Oladipo made an all star game, as has D'Angelo Russell, and Brandon Ingram. Lonzo Ball is clearly not a bust, and if he keeps improving the way he has, all star games aren't out of the question. Bagley has been shit, but hes been the first truly bad, already out of the rotation player in a few years. Morant looks great, Wiseman hasn't played nearly enough to be judged, and even Jalen Green has shown flashes of great potential.    This is assuming the curse was due to the shit run after KD (Beasley, Thabeet, Evan Turner, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, etc)."
"With this level of foolishness, you can probably write an essay trying to convince people that Lonzo Ball is better than Magic Johnson"
"I tend to think that any starting point guard that can't shoot would be better in the 70s-90s. Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Ricky Rubio, etc. Westbrook would probably get the kind of criticisms that Jordan got in the 80s for trying to score much too much by himself. If Ben played in the 80s he'd be right there with Magic and Bird in discussions and popularity."
Brandon Ingram 2020  Julius Randle 2021   Lonzo Ball 2022   It‚Äôs been written.
"Is there a consensus on who's the better Ball brother? It seems like LaMelo is getting more attention as he's new to the league and putting up good numbers, and that Lonzo, while still good, doesn't have a spotlight on him anymore and isn't putting up numbers as good as his brother."
he kinda reminds me of lonzo ball for some weird reason
Lonzo Ball
"Lakers are good at finding and keeping players who are not afraid of the moment, you might have noticed a lot of ""good players"" once they put the Lakers jersey on and play along side great players fall short of expectations and are soon let go. An Alex Caruso who is solid or even improved in the heightened intensity of the playoffs is more valuable than a Lonzo Ball, while perhaps more talented, shrinks in the same situation."
"Lonzo needs to go somewhere where he can be a primary ball handler again, this 3&amp;D wing role isn‚Äôt really maximizing his strengths and he won‚Äôt be able to run point on the Hornets"
"Dawg what, I'm a huge BBB fan and you're completely lost. Lavar got a platform bc Lonzo had the best freshman season in ncaa in a while and was getting comps to Jason Kidd and then Lavar came in and gave him fame to make him a household name to ppl who don't even watch sports. As a prospect, Lonzo was way better and was going 2 fs, if he was coming into 2020 draft, he woulda been consensus #1. Magic said yo jersey gonna be in the rafters for a reason. Melo got attention and hype bc he was the younger brother of the star freshman ucla pg lonzo ball who's dad said he was better than curry. Without that, it woulda been a cool high school play that ppl see and double tap and move on.   There's a reason the Lonzo hype was the biggest story in sports in a while for a reason lol, Melo a better player and we know that bc Lavar said so, but Lonzo started all this."
Put some respect on Lonzo and LaMelo.  Way different ways of getting into NBA and adjusting. LaMelo has the advantage of Lavar Ball being quiet and in the background instead of how he was with Zo and I'm sure that played a part in his development. He learned from that and is leaving Melo do his thing.
"Lamelo is gonna be the best one of them all.  However , love I Lonzo‚Äôs intangibles and know he could be a killer on a team that emphasizes transition.  Lamelo will be beastly regardless cause he has a more refined offensive  skillet set.  Really hope Lonzo finds a team/coach that lets him run all the time with the ball in his hands. I think he could be one of the best transition players and def the best transition passer of all time."
"You should ask a pelicans fan what they think of Lonzo at the two guard. While he is getting better as a spot up shooter, to call him an elite 3/D guy is a stretch. He can play D, but his offense from the start was built upon his ability to pass the ball."
"This is the take. We need more transition offense, more ball movement, and size at the 1.  I‚Äôd give Lou Will for Lonzo if I‚Äôm being honest"
"His form still isn't great, but there are enough positive signals to suggest his jump shot could develop further. Lonzo had a tendency to miss left and right which meant he had to completely overhaul his jumper. I haven't seen that as much with LaMelo, and his touch / ball rotation seems fairly solid despite his form. I could see LaMelo becoming an excellent shooter with some footwork adjustments and by bringing his shooting pocket a bit more up and a bit less out in front."
Is he better than Lonzo Ball tho?
how so? Lonzo can‚Äôt run a halfcourt offense. He‚Äôs an elite 3/D role player who is great with the ball in transition. If they played together you‚Äôd definitely want LaMelo at the one.
lonzo always had some serious shot creating questions tho even coming into the league. he just doesnt have the handles to be a legit creator in the half court.   thats not really the concern with lamelo tho. with lamelo its more so how good can he get at that. thats why a lotta people considered him the best ball brother even before he was in the league or at least has the potentially to be the best  lonzos big scoring games are usually from him getting hot from 3. lamelo has shown an actual ability to get to the rim that lonzo has never shown
Feel bad for whoever gives Lonzo Air Ball $12 mil a year. Guy is certified bust for being #2 pick.
"Lonzo has to share the ball with two all-time greats, so his stats are lower than they might be."
My first thought was that I actually attributed my good ft% in high school to how much 21 I played in the summers. That game is all about making 3 fts and getting the ball back lol not sure about lamelo yet but lonzo is a horrific free throw shooter
I'd say both ball brothers are streaky. Lamelo has had a few good early games though. More than Lonzo if i remember right
"Label him a bust... sure, were is Markelle Fultz nowadays? Either way it's premature man, we can't label him a bust neither a superstar. Also, Lonzo Ball had a similar record as well... were is he now? WestBrook's first triple double happened when he was 21 years old... there's so many examples that can point at busts or stars, we just have to wait and see"
"Quite honestly, we never saw Lonzo Ball at any level show the scoring capability that LaMelo has. LaMelo was more lethal to score as a sophomore in HS than Lonzo was as a freshman at UCLA."
"I‚Äôm just not sure how much trial by fire they really want to live through for Zo when he can‚Äôt run the half court, can‚Äôt drive to the rim / finish at the rim without turning it over.  His vision in transition and ability to hit runners is top tier. But there‚Äôs wayyy more possessions in the half court and he‚Äôs just not that great with the ball in his hands.  He makes great touch passes. But so many offenses are built to have a guy go 1:1, create an advantage that then compounds until you have an easy look.  If you can‚Äôt initiate that advantage, it makes the next part of the offense weaker.   Trying to coordinate a play where he‚Äôs maybe the third guy to touch the ball, and then letting him improvise based off a read? It happens, but it‚Äôs so damn hard to make a system around that.  BI and Zion are good now. Lonzo probably gets the year and then they sign and trade."
"I don‚Äôt see how Lonzo‚Äôs supposed to succeed in New Orleans when they keep getting other ball handlers around him. First it was Jrue, now it‚Äôs Bledsoe. Plus Ingram has the ball a lot of the times. If those guys weren‚Äôt on the team and the offence was built around Zo and Zion that would be ideal for Lonzo"
"In some ways I feel like Lonzo has been better this year, but I definitely agree that he is put in a position that is not natural for him. How can Van Gundy think it makes sense for him to have the ball so little? It seems like  a huge waste of his passing."
Lonzo balls terrible shooting and ball handling has had a terrible impact on Lonzos career.
"Melo is the offensive version of the Ball bros and Lonzo the other end.  Lonzo has always been a 3 &amp; guard the opposing player kind of guy. His iso game is non-existent. No handles, no drives, no aggressiveness, no hesi etc.  Melo is all of that. But he slacks on the other end. This is more about effort tho, and Melo can improve on that.  So all that combine, it's obvious Melo is gonna be better than Lonzo."
"Quite honestly, we never saw Lonzo Ball at any level show the scoring capability that LaMelo has. LaMelo was more lethal to score as a sophomore in HS than Lonzo was as a freshman at UCLA. Now LaMelo has grown a foot and he still seems to have that same scoring prowess. Lonzo was always a distributor who could dunk and light it up from time to time."
"Lonzo, is a playmaker on the break, with ELITE Defense. Can't make a layup for some dumb reason. Shooting's kinda wacky, decent long but terrible mid-range or up close. He's playing below his level because he has two ball dominant players to support.     Lamelo's raw. Very raw. Has a great running game. Can actually drive.. at times. His shooting is terrible too though. But being able to drive is a big big deal. Looks bigger than Lonzo. Has a half court game at the very least. Being able to drive is a big big deal compared to his brother.   Nba has exciting Balls."
"Just watch his highlights. He literally is the primary ball handler taking the ball up the floor and in the half court sets. He ran pick and roll all year. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you   https://youtu.be/s0vaLqTw9pw  Also, you said lonzo is both a transition pg and a half court creator. I don‚Äôt really understand your argument."
"actually as a UCLA fan i watched the whole season. Lonzo was the 2 for that season with Aaron Holiday being our half court PG most of the time, Lamelo is more ball dominant player in the half court and can create his own shot more consistently. just because they both hit deep threes sometimes doesn‚Äôt mean they played any bit alike."
He‚Äôs who I wanted but recognize that while he could easily slot in with Kerr‚Äôs system it wouldn‚Äôt be the best for his development. He needs to have full reign of the offense in order to make mistakes and work through them without fear of being bench for extended periods of time. He‚Äôs easily the highest upside player in this draft and the most naturally gifted. He‚Äôs just understands ball even if in his interviews he can‚Äôt articulate what exactly he saw on an individual play. I guess he‚Äôs a savant in that respect. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be like Lonzo where he‚Äôll lose confidence either. Plus he gives the Hornets an identity for the first time since CP3.
It's honestly crazy how dead-on accurate the scouting of the Ball brothers was while they were still at Chino Hills. LaMelo was always thought to be better than Lonzo while LiAngelo wasn't really ever going to make it.
"Best public high school team ever. Lonzo star at UCLA, Liangelo leading Cali in points, and Lamelo scoring 92 in a high school game. Loud father. Their own Facebook watch show. They may seem boring in interviews, but they are not in Ball in the family, their FB show. (IMO)."
"it didn't help that Adams and Ingram were grabbing all the rebounds and giving up the ball almost immediately lol.   Rough game for the Pels, and worse for Lonzo. Apart from the first quarter, they never really had an offensive rhythm :/"
"I wondered what made him a better prospect than Lonzo who people feel underperforms for a top pick. Thought he was more fluid as a playmaker than Lonzo, but that the older brother's defense and shooting (even with NBA track record) were better enough to bridge the gap.  I definitely see how his ball skills put him in the top tier now tho."
"Lamelo has the potential to be a great player because of his superb playmaking ability and his flaws are definitely fixable, kid's got confidence with the ball on his hands. Lonzo seems to be improving and he could become a better defender and gain some confidence as a finisher. He'll never live up to the hype of his draft year but he'll be fine."
"people across reddit / twitter have been shitting on lonzo bc melon had a better game. I acknowledge my bias of being a fan of zo. that being said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good look for pels fans to go all in on clowning zo. he‚Äôs playing next to ball dominant players (bi, bledsoe) and he (imo) is being misused in the pelicans offense. despite his lackluster box score, he‚Äôs still giving you great defense and moves the ball. his passing is infectious; his teammates tend to make the extra pass more often than not (I also acknowledge svg‚Äôs coaching in terms of ball movement). he is a very unique player: below-average handle for a pg, amazing offensive fast break ability, inconsistent shot (which has shown improvement and he‚Äôs shown a tireless work ethic to get better). reading this out it kinda seems like I‚Äôm not that high on zo, but please remember it‚Äôs only 9 games into the season. I also feel like this is a critique on fan entitlement and attitude. if you‚Äôre getting super pissed and shitting on a young man who‚Äôs trying his hardest makes you feel better, stop it. get some help."
"hahaha, lonzo was like , I hear you mf talking , they ain't going to be saying shit bout this jump ball though ...lol"
Lonzos shot not even the worst thing about him. The fact that lonzo couldn‚Äôt make driving layups or hit free throws was much worse. Lamelo jumper also nowhere near as bad as lonzos where he pulled the ball across his whole body.
"PG: Chris Paul (2018) SG: Bradley Beal SF: Andre Iggy (2015) PF: Tatum C: 2011-2012 Tyson Chandler  Bench: Montrez Harrell Lonzo Ball Marcus Morris  I feel like pairing up CPIII with Beal, Iggy, and Tatum gives him great wings to pass it to, with the starting line up having a good mix of both defense and offensive capability. Rounding out the bench with a back up wing, good defensive and passing guard who has improved his catch and shoot threes, and Harrell a former 6th man of the year winner."
Jfc lonzo is in year 4? Seems only yesterday that Daddy Ball made headlines during the lonzo's draft.
Lonzo Ball obviously.
Lonzo Ball is a bust
Lonzo Ball is a bust
"What are you talking about?  You realize teams have multiple point guards, right?  He‚Äôs not even really a point guard anyway. He‚Äôs a good defensive wing who is ok at spot up 3s and ball handling  All of those teams need more of those players in crunch time.  I‚Äôve seen enough of those teams fans post trade takes for Lonzo to know there‚Äôs interest."
Lonzo ball just doesn‚Äôt know how to drive the ball to the rim and finish with a layup whereas his brother is really good at it
Why did Lonzo of all people turn you off to the Ball family? Their father is the only crazy one of the bunch. Save for maybe the klepto.
"Lonzo and Lavar turned me off to the Ball family, but I like Lamelo‚Äôs game? tf? I saw some highlights before the league but I didn‚Äôt know I would enjoy his play like that"
Lonzo is good at bringing the ball up the court
It‚Äôs time to stop comparing Lonzo to LaGOAT Ball.  One is a role player and the other is a future superstar.
"JVG had a great point on the broadcast where he said when Lamelo drives he drives to finish whereas when Lonzo drives he drives to pass out.   Lonzo's never been a good rim finisher and it's honestly disappointing he hasn't figured that part of his game out yet, his vertical isnt bad but he keeps driving with the ball on his hip"
I like this list I saw from a pelicans fan better  1. Lamelo 2. Left ball 3. Right ball 4. Lonzo
"So the Pelicans are entirely dependent on Lonzo Ball having a good game? No thanks, that seems too risky. If we're not willing to shell out for Ball in RFA (and some team will overpay him), you might as well as package him and Bledsoe for expiring contracts, bench help, picks while rolling with a NAW/Hart backcourt. Unless our plan is to ""lose competitively"" and then Griffin wears his lucky tie for Cade Cunningham.      We had this problem last year too when we got off to that 6-22 start, and we just assumed it's Gentry.  But this team should not be dependent on Lonzo Ball when it's built around Ingram and Zion."
Conclusion: Lamelo ball isn't just Lonzo Ball
"I mean the Pelicans had Lonzo sitting in the corner majority of the time and the Hornets ran a lot of sets that involved LaMelo with the ball. I‚Äôm not sure what you really expect.   LaMelo had a great game but Lonzo not getting his numbers isn‚Äôt all on him. Sure he had a couple turnovers and missed shots but it‚Äôs hard to get into a rhythm when you‚Äôre sent to the corner almost every play. Tonight, LaMelo had the ball a lot and was able to get into a rhythm."
LaMelo Ball is just Lonzo Ball with confidence
Lmao I‚Äôm so done with Lonzo Ball
"Lonzo doesn‚Äôt look happy at all, don‚Äôt think he likes the fact he‚Äôs just been used to bring the ball up &amp; sit in the corner."
What about Lonzo Ball? Still awful at ft shooter but serviceable at wide open threes?
"I really liked Tyrese and I remember following him before the draft. The knocks were that his shot is funny looking (so a little bit of the Lonzo fear that his % wouldn't carry to the nba); his shot isn't the fastest so he can't create his own 3; he is skinny so while he was considered a smart defender there was a fear he would need to bulk up before meeting his defensive potential; and last but most importantly, he was considered a smart ball handler that didn't have a lot of turnovers however he wasn't seen as the guy who could come right out and run an offense.    There was also a rumor that he told teams he wanted them to pass on him. I think that rumor has some credence when you think about it, since having fox as a backcourt partner kind of covers his biggest weaknesses (doesn't have to create his own shot, doesn't have to be the main ball handler running the offense)"
It‚Äôs kinda crazy to go back and look at the first round ‚Äúbusts‚Äù the lakers picked Julius randle D‚Äôangelo Russell Brandon Ingram Lonzo ball Of the 4 three could be all stars and lonzo is solid af at worst.
He hasn't gotten the ball nearly enough this year. It needs to change. Lonzo fucking ball should never be taking 18 shots
Way to make a Steven Adams triple-double about Lonzo Ball lmao
"They‚Äôre just in different situations. Lonzo plays off the ball pretty often. LaMelo comes off the bench and typically gets it more since there‚Äôs less ball handlers off the bench. Lonzo is an overall better defender and holds the down the defense pretty well, LaMelo will bulk up eventually. They‚Äôre still both inconsistent shooters though."
Probably not an ideal offensive scheme to be having Lonzo Ball take more shots than Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson but I‚Äôm not an NBA coach.
Zion should've had the ball way more often this game he was absolutely feasting on us.  We have zero post defense.  Why did Lonzo take more shots than Zion
1. Lamelo ball 2. Lonzo ball
"I'm saying when he made the decision, Houston was coming off a conference finals and had two great players. Philly had Embiid and Simmons. The Lakers had Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram."
"I can promise you Peyton Manning did not leave because he thought the Colts would be a train wreck. And in general my point still stands none of them forced their way to Big market teams.  This argument is hilarious. LeBron's soul goal was to win, he could have gone to Houston or Philly. Neither lonzo ball nor Brandon Ingram are good enough to get you to the playoffs in the West."
"i‚Äôve tried to watch basically every minute he‚Äôs played. He has very active hands on ball which can scare offensive players and stall their attacks, he shows high basketball IQ with his rotations, he makes the best rotations out of any rookie i‚Äôve seen so far. He always knows the offensive players blind spot and has great length. He still has a lot of room to improve but he‚Äôs shown so many flashes of being a really good defender like Lonzo. I know he‚Äôs had a bad reputation which may sway opinions but he‚Äôs been solid so far"
"The Lakers have missed the playoffs 11 times total since 1947, have been to more finals than any other team, have won more titles than any other team, and have a reputation over decades of taking care of their stars.   If that's not well run, I don't know what the fuck is. The Lakers are probably the most consistently well run sports franchise in America over the last 40 years.   You idiots latch on to the 5 years the team was bad after the team's franchise player had a career-ending injury and they were tanking to judge the franchise lmao, it's hilarious.   Even then, the assets the team acquired while they were bad were all attractive pieces that helped the team get a star. Jordan Clarkson is a rotation player. Brandon ingram is a future star. Josh Hart is good. Lonzo Ball is good. Larry Nance is good. Randle is good. Zubac was good. Moe Wagner is good. Thomas Bryant is good.   Alex Caruso was developed from a g-leaguer to a fantastic rotation player.  Talen-Horton Tucker is good. The Lakers' scouting found all these guys. Is that not part of being well run? Any team could have had any of those guys and used them.  The Lakers drafted well and made good trades to get out from the terrible Mozgov and Deng contracts. They didn't get a single free agent meeting when they were terrible. Only once ownership changed and the team improved did they even have a chance at LeBron. The league is a meritocracy; when the Lakers were bad they couldn't even get a meeting with LaMarcus fucking aldridge of all people.   You guys shat on all the moves Pelinka made last off-season and look what happened? The team won a title and was built extraordinarily well. Then he turns around and makes smart moves *again* to make the team better.   I'm not trying to hear any salty fucking nonsense about the Lakers not being well run. This isn't Mitch Kupchak and Jimmy Buss' regime anymore. The new management has consistently made the right decisions and turned the team around. The scouting department hit on pick after pick after pick. Keep holding on to those 4 or 5 years when the team was bad because you're showing your age. The Lakers have consistently been excellently well run, and it will continue now that Pelinka and Jeanie ousted those fucking bozos."
Pels had 2 timeouts. No one with a brain to call a timeout after Oladipo made the 3 or after they had difficulty inbounding the ball or after Lonzo got trapped.
"Yh, that was a disgusting choke. Someone should've called a timeout on that last possession. Lonzo and JJ couldn't get the ball up the court."
Idk but Brandon Ingram seemed like he‚Äôs fucking done on this game. He didn‚Äôt rush to JJ and Lonzo when they were struggling to dribble the ball and didn‚Äôt try to challenge that Turner trey.
Adams and Ingram literally stand and stare while Lonzo Ball is basically being trapped.  Any normal basketball player knows you run back up in that situation.  Not stand and stare.
Why on earth did Lonzo dribbled towards 2 Pacers after managing to get a crunch time lose ball that would have given his team the W... ffs.
Lonzo ball is so dumb in this play. Why can‚Äôt he just dribble right and get passed Dermott?
"Oh right. How could I forget. That's a really strong team. You could have a pretty deep line-up of:  * Coach: Pau * C: Marc/Brook &amp; Robin Lopez/Cody &amp; Tyler Zeller * Wings: Giannis/Marcus &amp; Markieff/Justin Holiday/Thanasis/Kostas/Caleb &amp; Cody Martin * Guards: Steph/Jrue/Lonzo &amp; LaMelo Ball/Seth/Aaron Holiday  Would have to send some of these guys to the G-League affiliate, since it's over 15 now.  This team is definitely a championship caliber team."
Lonzo has always had such weak ball skills.  The minute a defender gets up on him he freaks out.
"Zion's strength and momentum going full speed to the rim draws a lot of fouls, him attacking the rim and not settling for a jump shot is the high IQ play considering he is a very good finisher  These are just growing pains of a young player, Zion won't even be 21 for another 6 months. That and his time out of the team last year didn't help in terms of building chemistry with his team mates, he's already working on that as he seems to have formed a great understanding with Lonzo Ball"
"They don't have the personnel outside of Bledsoe, Ingram did over shoot tonight though. He was doing a great job early on moving the ball like you said, reason he had 8 assists. I thought he was trying too hard to get that dagger and just couldn't do it. Ultimately that Reddick/Lonzo TO should have never happened. That was a full on choke. Team will learn though"
"Biggest mistake was not calling a TO when JJ and Lonzo were losing the ball, game might not even go to OT if that happens."
That‚Äôs embarrassing.   LaGOAT Ball has one of the best handles in the game. People have the audacity to say Lonzo is better than LaGOAT Ball.....
"Lonzo Ball, you filthly filthy man."
Lonzo Ball giving these rednecks the business
Lonzo! The best Ball.
Imagine drafting Lonzo Ball instead of this guy
"The Lopezes instead of the Zellers  A starting 5 of   Steph, Jrue, Lonzo/LaMelo, Giannis, Brook would be lethal  and then off the bench there's Seth, the other Ball bro, the Morrii, and RoLo? That's a pretty good roster. But also just Giannis and Steph would be broken, nearing Steph + KD broken"
"Lonzo Ball  LaMelo Ball  Notice how their last name is singular, indicating the presence of only one ‚Äòball‚Äô, or testicle."
Goodness can you imagine Lonzo/lamelo facilitating for Steph running out off ball and Giannis pick and rolls?
Take it back one year and you add Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball.   How you feel about it now bro
"Lonzo is probably the best defender of the four, but Steph and Seth will just shoot the lights out and the Ball brothers won't be able to catch up."
"True. What is the starting 5 you'd prefer then? You want to give Ball minutes, but Graham is your best player. Rozier has better size than Graham to defend 2s. Gordon Hayward obviously needs to start. Washington, another young player that needs minutes and should start. And Zeller, the only starting center option on the team. Graham and Ball are not a good issue to have. Graham is your best player right now and Ball is the guy you want to eventually be your best player. If Ball were a better defender there would be no issue playing the two alongside each other. The way I see it if you're starting Ball at PG you're pretty much forfeiting half the season because you need him to develop. With Graham you have a much better chance of making the playoffs. But who knows, maybe halfway through the season LaMelo pulls to together and you guys go on a huge winning streak. I just don't think the odds are in favor of that. Lonzo hasnt lead a team to winning so I don't think it'll happen in his first year in the NBA."
Lonzo has never even had decent ball handling let alone elite.
"Lonzo Ball in his career is .390 FG%, .339 3P%, and .490 FT%. (Total: 1.219)  That's pretty awful, yo, especially for a guard."
"100 to 1 that Lonzo Ball wins the MVP.  Let me know, that offer won't last forever."
Did the Lakers break the NBA regular season wins record before AD joined? How many rings did the LeBron-Lonzo Ball era get the Lakers?
"Lonzo Ball remarkably had a 5x4 last week.  16/8/5/5 against the Spurs.  His career high in blocks is only 4, but he's had a 5 steal game every season."
"Never forget when SVG got hired and he had a bunch of people tweeting at him telling him how to use Lonzo properly. SVG makes a tweet talking about how bad White Supremacy is for our society and you'd have dudes in the replies talking about how he's using Lonzo wrong and how Lonzo needs to be doing this, this and this.  Melo Ball has played really well. I will give him credit. He looks much better than Zo did during his rookie year. But the Ball brothers obsession is weird and I'll never understand it."
"They are worse this year because their pickups made no sense. Bledsoe used to be a good/great defender but he‚Äôs really bench material these days and was never a reliable shooter. JJ has falling off a fucking cliff. He‚Äôs so bad now it‚Äôs ridiculous. Adams is hustling his ass out there like he was always does but SVG has no idea how to use him. Lonzo isn‚Äôt working out at all.   They are basically a team with two good/great players in BI and Zion and the rest, outside of Adams, are just awful. Well except Hart. He‚Äôs good for the role he‚Äôs been given.   Regarding Zion. People talking about how he doesn‚Äôt play like his Duke days. That‚Äôs a great example of having a system and team that you enjoy playing for. First off, he‚Äôs out there fighting for boards every single game and he is constantly attacking. For what the offense is giving him, he‚Äôs doing the best he possibly can. They will go long stretches at a time where he doesn‚Äôt even touch the ball. He‚Äôs great at the drive and kick but no one can hit a shot to save their life so he has to keep forcing it in. The fact that teams know exactly why he‚Äôs gonna do and still can‚Äôt stop it is amazing in itself.   Remember he‚Äôs still a kid and not same hardened vet. Hard to play with enthusiasm when your team is so bad. At Duke he had a great system and great teammates. They all played together as a team and Zion fed off that."
"Caruso in his role is elite now - but that role might be more limited than most people think.  He can stay in front of just about anyone with ease on defense (sure all-star level players exempted from that) but has low scoring on low attempts.  He is always there to take the charge, hustle to save the ball, close out the shooter, clutch blocks from behind...etc.  He gives you the highlight play every couple games too as a sweet bonus.  And now he is taking nothing but wide-open threes, most often from the corner, or layups.  As long as he can stay above 40% he should be getting 20-25 minutes a night.  But its on such low volume I don't think we can use this small sample size at 57% to suggest it will even stay above 40%.  But if it does...man.     I'm taking Caruso for this season on the Lakers, but I think for most other teams they'd choose Lonzo."
Remember last year when people were saying fucking lonzo ball would have a better career than John Stockton? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"The only reason I take Caruso is because he plays his heart out every single second hes on the floor, he just is a winning player Lonzo ball is the better overall player but there's just too many times where you never know what kind of Lonzo you get"
Fans of the ball brothers will never allow this narrative to be true. Lonzo will consistently be in ‚Äúthe wrong system‚Äù or have ‚Äúa coach that doesn‚Äôt utilize him well‚Äù
Ball handler? You kidding? Lonzo has some of the worst ball handling for a guard I've ever seen
"A few things I've noticed this season:   Lonzo - Bad shooting even by his standards. Seems like whoever he passes it to turns it over, and it's not even because of a bad pass. I expect his shooting to improve even a little bit, but it doesn't help that he's almost been forced to shoot at times instead of finding a higher percentage play.   Reddick - Doesn't seem like he's on the floor much, and if he is, it's because the team is desperate for him to make a 3. He and Melli seem criminally underused this season.  Adams - has looked good for quarters at a time, but doesn't seem like he's gelling well with the rest.   Zion - Looks improved on offense, gets off to good starts during the games, but having BI and Adams out there with him seems to give him less impact.   I can't even mention anyone else because it feels like that's it. The Pels live and die by the performances of these players, their bench has been real streaky, and the defense that was showing up early in the season has fizzled away.   There is no answer, no backup plan, for when the shots aren't going in. Just giving the ball to BI in the 4th quarter has not been working out."
"Catch ball, pump fake, 2 dribbles, and lay it in. Lonzo assist"
"Nets traded for Ben Simmons, except no defense, so they traded for Lonzo Ball."
Harden has become Lonzo ball. Afraid to shoot
"Melo went from LMAO Ball to being hyped and now nobody talks about him because he's been below average.  I still don't understand the Ball brothers. Lonzo was ass shooting, then he was starting to shoot well in NOLA, went to the bubble, he was ass and a couple of days ago there were rumors about him being traded.  Lamelo is really aggressive, I've seen really good passes from him, really athletic. He goes 4/5 from 3pt line and then 0/6; he goes 15FGA to 3FGA. He looks confident and then he's sloppy; he's flashy and then he vanishes (Although I've watched the last games from him, maybe he was better)"
"He will be great on New Orleans, replacing Lonzo Ball next year."
"I felt I generally could relate to him and being a laker fan I didn‚Äôt like how everyone treated him. Like irl his game fits mine I‚Äôm not super athletic or can shoot but I can play make and defend. Honestly my top 5 favorites wouldn‚Äôt even sound like I watch basketball  Lonzo, Kobe, Jr Smith, Klay Drose/Zach Lavine tied at 5th spot. Not to mention he‚Äôs really fucking solid like who doesn‚Äôt like a PG with IQ that isn‚Äôt ball dominant and is pass 1st like what‚Äôs he averaging rn 12/7/7? Who couldn‚Äôt use that on their team rn? People call him a bum and he‚Äôs far from it"
"Isn't the issue that DLo is not good off ball, so that's why playmakers like Rubio and Lonzo won't do well with him?"
Honestly i feel they‚Äôd have won that year kawhi hit that game winner. The 76ers have always been one of my favorite teams to root for outside the lakers ofc but Ben Simmons might generally be one of my favorite players ever. I love his game and he‚Äôs like an Uber athletic version of my favorite player lonzo ball. There‚Äôs just something about defense and playmaking that I enjoy more than scoring idk
**Stars with a good shot**  AD/Giannis/Joker/Luka/Simmons/Sabonis  **Very good players with a shot**  Draymond Green/LaMelo Ball/Lonzo Ball/Clint Capela/Andre Drummond/Dejounte Murray/Myles Turner  **Maybe somehow if they get play time (even if it is extremely unlikely)**  Elfrid Payton/Rajon Rondo
lonzo ball
"I think Lamelo had the benefit of watching his brothers struggles in the nba and do everything he could to round himself out sooner. Lamelo is already a better ball handler, playmaker, and finisher. Lonzo literally only has shooting, and Lamelo isnt bad at that either."
LaMelo Ball is who Lonzo should think he is
&gt;&gt; Lonzo Ball ~~averages from h~~is ~~last 18 games are~~ quite bad
"What I meant was I respect Bens ability to get into the paint and handle himself through contact. People dumb as balls and dont understand thats the aspect I'm in awe of. Giannis has that same ability to finish strong and be athletic. I hate the 76ers and I hate Ben Simmons for being a liability as somebody that can't shoot the ball at all, even Shaq shot mid range and had to be marked there, but to denounce Bens basketball IQ is a travesty. Him being not able to shoot the jumper bc of whatever his left hand right hand issue is has nothing to do with IQ and ability.    Just like Lonzo. I've been a bit Lonzo fan for a long time because of his basketball IQ. He's smart and personally I love defense and transition creativity, which Lonzo finds himself being really good at. Dude sometimes looks like a modern day Dennis Rodman with his ability to create simply and his mindset of hounding for the ball and fishing for turnovers. I'm a defender at heart in soccer and ultimate Frisbee, having played with players that have gone pro that are semi pro played in D1 full ride d2 the entire spectrum of top ball in America and there's a difference in somebody who just knows to defend and somebody who just scores. You literally don't learn elite defense, you need to have been born with that mentality and an off beat timing to follow a play before it happens. As a defender in all sports, if you're on time you're late. I lost track of what I was talking about but defense is great great players see the game different. Comparing somebody like Kanter to any time Shaq is like comparing Thaddeus Young to younger Carmelo Anthony. Thaddeus decent player I like him but he's no Carmelo."
"Pelicans are for sure struggling. Steven Adams still hasn't learned to step up on ball screens, and Bledsoe just doesn't fit with these guys. They should trade lonzo,  they got him playing mostly off the ball, I don't think he excels in that role. BI and zion are the only bright spots so far this season."
"Ah damn. Guess the Pels aren't winning the Chip this year.   Here's where your mindset and that of every casual who thinks tank tank tank is just completely off kilter.   Zion needs to develop his defense. Until then we need a stallwart on D, but don't need to overpay for one. Adams is that guy to go next to him. This year and next are about building Zion / BI into their superstar potential. Zion is learning D. JJ is helping train NAW.   Bledsoe is an 18 mil expiring next year. He will have value at the deadline or in the offseason. Again I could very much see him in a Clippers or Hawks jersey for the playoffs this year. He won't be asked too much. Just a better second team ball handler. Help lighten the load. JJ is expiring. That could fetch something or the Pels could bring him back (my hope for the cheap to help NAW more.) After two years of building, year 3 is where we'll see the Pels come alive. Adams will be an expiring. BI / Zion will be the main pieces. Still plenty of trade ammo AND cap space. Pels would be buyers then and grab one of the better spacing guards that inevitably end up on the market.   You're looking at this from a compete now aspect instead of a development aspect. This year is about help the stars grow into superstars and the project grow into rotation pieces (NAW, Kira, Lonzo, Hayes, Hart). Adams and JJ help bring the veteran leadership there which is invaluable right now. Bledsoe is the only piece that doesn't fit for us in this scenario and I think he'll be gone sooner than you might think. The assets we got for Holiday were worth it in the long run and outweigh the negative that Bledsoe is for us on the court.   2022-2023 will be interesting with a lineup of Lonzo/Kira/Naw - Insert Guard from above - BI - Zion - Adams/Hayes/Ringchasing Vet Center/PF. My best guess: NAW-Beal-BI-Zion-Vucevic if Zion hasn't developed a 3-ball and become able to stretch the floor himself. If he has them sub Vuc for Adams and it will be a stout team with chemistry."
"Lonzo has had fundamental flaws in his game since college...more than his jumpshot...his handle, ability to get to the rim, lay up and floater package are were very rudimentary at best...at UCLA he was average in the half court at those things..it‚Äôs why a personally thought he was overrated...however I think he will end a very good role player wants he gets in the right situation, along with getting lucky with not getting injured...if he‚Äôs paired with a talented playmaker in the half court and a team that likes to run and gun you‚Äôll see him look better...I think he‚Äôs an okay shooter a great defender, a guy with really high bball iq on both sides of the ball and a great passer in transition"
"Players near that level that dont seem guaranteed to stay on their team are  Zach Lavine &amp; Bradley Beal  \---  Some ""big names"" that may move:  John Collins  Kyle Lowry  Victor Oladipo  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley        \---  No major issue/fit, but could see teams asking about;  Lamarcus Aldridge  Devin Booker  Pascal Siakam  Buddy Hield  \---       Doubtful, but could see being surprising moves given team outlooks of assets/health/success:  KAT  Curry/Klay"

"I can barely watch our games since you know any lead we have is gonna get pissed away since all we do is play iso ball since Lonzo, Bledsoe, NAW, you fucking name it in the backcourt, are inconsistent and half the time barely playable on offense. We need to either commit to the tank this year and try to get a real PG in Cade Or trade everything for Beal and a vet floor general PG."
"Well when I think of people fighting for equality, the first people I think of are definitely Lonzo Ball and Paris Hilton."
Lonzo Ball is a bargain bin Ben Simmons. Change my mind
This sub really thought Lonzo Ball was better than LaGOAT Ball... Embarrassing.
LaVine‚Äôs at the top of my wishlist but I doubt Lonzo Ball has any value close to that
"Would Chris Paul be the perfect player for this current Pels team? Imagine him in place of Ball, with Lonzo off the bench."
"But Van Gundy WANTS Ingram with the ball more, like a playmaking forward(LeBron, Durant, etc.). He‚Äôs good enough to do it as well. The problem is Lonzo is really bad when he‚Äôs not the primary playmaker"
"Lonzo Ball needs to start, bringing him off the bench is dumb. Really what he needs is for someone to remind him that as the point guard it‚Äôs his job to lead and run the team, not Ingrams or Zions."
"Hey, I totally agree with you there. He is definitely now the Lonzo we thought him to be. I was just pointing out the reason why he is just bringing the ball up, pass to BI and goes to the corner. And that has a lot to do with coaching, the coach don‚Äôt see him as the prime ball handler, doesn‚Äôt trust him, and obvious Lonzo hasn‚Äôt prove himself."
"I mean... BI, redick, naw, hart, etc. I'm not saying it's all nba ball here, I'm just saying as a tactic that coulda gotten the most out of what these guys can do.  If stan van's plan was for lonzo to be chris paul, just seems kinda like he's missing the point of his pieces."
A lavine/beal kinda player who can shoot the ball from anywhere. They lack a half-court offensive player apart from BI. I guess they're gonna trade lonzo/bledsoe before the deadline with some picks to compete for the playoff spot.
"Not really.  Lonzo was an outstanding college player, who lead his team to a 31-5 record.  The only evident flaw in his game was his ugly jump shot form, but he still shot 41% from 3 in college.  Fultz was kind of a combo guard, who didn't play good defense and his team was 9-16 in the games he played.  He was thought to have more upside, but Ball was probably considered a surer bet to be at least pretty good."
he can say that. because he hasnt double or tripled his stats.  this is like saying if lonzo ball just scored 40 more points per game and won 6 titles he'd be MJ with a full court pass.
I ain't down with trading the GROAT with friggin Lonzo Ball. Seems like a grosse thing to even think About
"Brandon and Zion need reliable shooters who can space the floor for them. Zion's grabbing 30 [in a crowded room](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsMjrnxXYAclbMn?format=jpg&amp;name=large), I think BI looks exhausted by late quarters after driving through like [four guys](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsJP2jfUwAQuGlx?format=jpg&amp;name=large) at a time all game.  People just don't see Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, or Eric Bledsoe as threats and they feel free to leave them unguarded and go crowd the #1 guys.  During the Lakers game, Schroder guarded the shit outta Nickeil Alexander-Walker though because he'd had a 37pt game against the Clips. I think Nickeil could be a good starter for us at SG if they let him get minutes.  BI and Zion are actually pretty good at creating looks for others, and our rookie PG seems pretty good at creating looks too. Just need dudes to stop bricking 'em."
"no one sane is designing even a play, much less an entire offensive system, to cater to lonzo ball, on the last year of his contract no less"
"When you say Lonzo has the ability to playmake for others, that's not really true. He has vision, can connect plays, get the ball where it should go, but he cannot play make. He lacks the ball handling ability to make a play for someone else. Elf can run a pick and roll better than lonzo can, as sad as it is."
Is Ben just straight up not shooting as much anymore? I haven‚Äôt paid much attention but loads of people have turned on him when the hell did he only score 11 pts did his usage go down???  Or is it because they have more shooters so he‚Äôs more drawn to defense and playmaking like an Uber athletic lonzo ball which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing I like his game
"You don‚Äôt need Lonzo, as he‚Äôs basically Dollar Store LeBron without the height and muscle and just overall ability. His skill set is redundant with LeBron‚Äôs, just worse.  D‚Äôlo would be interesting, but again, I want the ball in LBJ‚Äôs hands as much as possible, and D‚Äôlo needs the ball in his hands to maximize his skills, so he‚Äôs out too.  That leaves us with Ingram, which of the three is the best off-ball player, so I feel like he meshes the best by far with the superstar duo. Also, Ingram/AD pick and rolls is a lot of height and a lot of skill barreling towards the hoop, and I find that intriguing. Also, though he‚Äôs not the best defender, he‚Äôs a big, long body that you can throw on wings and smaller 4s if you play AD at the 5. He‚Äôs almost the perfect complement to AD and LeBron and the easy pick in this scenario."
Time is running out for Lonzo ball in the NBA. Dude hasn't changed at all.
"I think he would be good for you guys. Late game playoffs your guards really get attacked on switches, Lonzo would be way less of a problem on defense than Lou. I think his shooting would be better with your spacing than we‚Äôre seeing currently, and even if not his vision has always been good and isnt a ball stopper. Lot of Pelicans flairs in this thread seem to be done with him so let‚Äôs see what happens if he moves on"
"&gt;It's Griffin's first season with the team, give him a bit of time.  People are pissed about the shooting but I don't think they foresaw how bad the covid shooting slumps would be. Every single dude on the roster went cold as ice (even J.J. Reddick) and I'm not sure he could have quite foreseen that. I think he expected Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball, and Nicolo Melli to be above avg. on 3's and J.J. to be superb on shooting.  But now that it's happening we better get some damn shooters."
"Lonzo dominating the ball might be better for Lonzo, but it wouldn't be better for NO.   I mean, Bledsoe plays better with the ball too, and he's capable of doing a lot more with the ball than Lonzo is."
"Gentry isn‚Äôt better and Lonzo isn‚Äôt good. If Lonzo wasn‚Äôt the second pick he wouldn‚Äôt be getting 30+ minutes a night. He wasn‚Äôt a good PG because he doesn‚Äôt drive to score, he can‚Äôt shoot free throws, he barely moves on or off the ball, and this year he can‚Äôt even shoot 3s"
"Thats true. Rubio is a half court floor general and playmaker/on-ball passer. Lonzo is a passer in transition and plays ""3"" and D in the half court who is a good extra passer after the playmaker breaks down the D."
Lonzo Doesn‚Äôt Ball
"He‚Äôs just being used terribly on the team. Lonzo should be ball dominant on a team, but they just stick him in the corner and have Ingram take it up. He doesn‚Äôt work well like that"
I genuinely don‚Äôt know what a lonzo ball in this current form and leverage situation commands in a trade
"The myth that lonzo is good with the ball in his hands is crazy.  He can't handle for shit, he can't run pick and roll, and he doesn't attack the basket.  Dude is not good. It's his 4th (?) year in the league, he's a bust."
"He‚Äôs a guy that contributes most when he has the ball in his hands, and now that Ingram has such a high usage rate, and Zion gets so many touches, Lonzo doesn‚Äôt touch the ball enough to create for his teammates. They don‚Äôt run the offense through him, which basically eliminates the only things he is good at on offense."
So what you‚Äôre saying is that Lonzo Ball is just Elfrid Payton with a shoe deal?
"SVG's slow paced half-court style is also killing Lonzo, but that's Zo's fault for not developing his game further. Last season, you see a lot of full court transitions, and Lonzo thrives in pushing the pace. The Pels were 5th last year in fastbreak points. Currently, they're sitting at 20th.   You're right that Lonzo just dumps the ball off to Ingram, but he needs to take the initiative like he was doing from January-March and just go grab buckets."
"I love Lonzo Ball as a player and a person, but he has obvious mental hurdles that he just can't get past. Shooting sub 60% from the line when you were a good ft shooter in college/ high school, terrible 3pt shooting, and refusal to drive to the basket or be an agressive scorer. And if you look throughout sports history, one of the hardest problems to fix is a mental one."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram Josh Hart, Lance Stephenson."
"I think Bledsoe, Ingram, and Zion having the ball more is a huge reason. I say give Lonzo one more chance on a different team."
"Seems like a mental thing for Lonzo.  With Zion and BI in front of him, feels like he doesn't want to step on any toes and plays extremely passive or is just not confident in himself.  I've never seen someone with a quick first step like him never look for a shot when going to the paint or a PG who looks to give the ball up as soon as he touches it"
"Hot take: They shouldn't trade Lonzo and they should just let him walk or waive him. The guy isn't a complete nba player at all. He can't shoot, can't dribble, can't be aggressive, and he can't playmake worth a damn (I said playmake, not pass). The man's only redeeming quality is that when he is in an up-tempo, transition offense he thrives by being an assist hunter who can dish out some of the most insane passes you've ever seen. Plus, he can actually defend decently on most possessions better than the majority of players in the NBA.      However, that is all that he is and will ever be. To think that's something you should want on your team is a mistake, one that both the Lakers and the Pelicans have made with each decided to take him on. From the start, it was clear that he was never a point guard or a complete basketball player that had a decent shot. If anything, the guy was a gimmick that probably would've been better suited for a spot on the GlobeTrotters as a reserve guy. Because a full NBA-Caliber guard or even a player wouldn't be completely inept when off-ball. So, with that being said, I hope the Pels just let him walk because Lonzo really doesn't fit in the NBA. His skill set makes that very clear."
This is not a chicken and egg situation. SVG is playing Lonzo off-ball because the decision to let him go has already been made. This will also depreciate his value getting a new contract. Lonzo will be asking for a trade within a month or 2.
"Well, De'Aaron Fox made the jump in year two where Lonzo Ball didn't. Not saying that means you give up on Lonzo, but Fox had a similar first year and then made the jump the next year. Lonzo didn't.   You're not wrong that Lonzo has had to deal with forces that were outside his control like the trade and some injury issues, but at the same time I don't think I'd sum it up to not having the opportunities. He had chances to prove he'd be an asset to commit to and he just didn't take advantage. Many players get much less opportunity he had."
"KEEFE WAS EATING pizza outside in Laguna Beach, California, on Nov. 24, when his phone rang. It was Ingram. They hadn't talked in a while. Ingram told Keefe he had just signed his new contract in New Orleans, and thanked him for the work they had done together.  ""I was like, 'Wow,'"" Keefe said.  Before the Davis trade, the Lakers saw signals that work was paying off. Luke Walton, the Lakers coach for Ingram's three seasons there, was among Ingram's biggest supporters in the organization. In meetings, Walton and his staff debated Ingram's best position. Several argued he could be a point-forward. They tried him there when Lonzo Ball got injured in early 2018.  ""With no prior reps, he knew the offense,"" Walton said. ""He became a playmaker. It was only a matter of time for him."" The NBA on ESPN and ABC  The NBA is back! Catch all the 2020-21 season action on ESPN, ABC and the ESPN App.  Wednesday, Jan. 20 ‚Ä¢ Celtics at Sixers, 7 p.m. on ESPN ‚Ä¢ Suns at Rockets, 9:30 p.m. on ESPN  All times Eastern  He was getting stronger. Mark Madsen, the former NBA player and Lakers assistant, hopped into pickup games with players. On one defensive possession, Madsen rotated and tried to plow through an opponent. When they collided, Madsen stumbled.  ""Dang, whoever did that is pretty strong,"" Madsen thought. He looked up and was surprised to see Ingram. ""He plays much stronger than he looks.""  Madsen watched Keefe and Ingram work, and thought about one of his old teammates over six years with the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""Brandon reminds me of [Kevin Garnett] in terms of his consistency, his routine,"" Madsen said.  ""He is the hardest worker I've ever seen,"" said Larry Nance Jr., Ingram's teammate in L.A. for parts of two seasons. ""The rest of us would get [to practice], and he'd already be drenched in sweat.""  Pelicans officials eventually banned Ingram from showing up to their facility on off days. They showed him data from their training staff indicating he was overworking himself. ""I hate it,"" Ingram said. ""But I use those off days to visualize the game.""  In search of more tutoring, Stackhouse hooked Ingram up with Micah Lancaster, a Michigan-based trainer who has worked with several NBA players. Lancaster pushed Ingram to bend more while dribbling, and shorten his strides while zigzagging through narrow corridors.  The idea was to be faster changing directions. In a crouch, Ingram would be harder for defenders to grasp. He could lean forward and use his shoulders for leverage around the rim. Lancaster learned firsthand of Ingram's wiry strength. He has clients toss a special medicine ball off a wall at his facility in Grand Rapids. Ingram threw the ball straight through Lancaster's drywall, leaving a hole that is still there. They tried another wall. Ingram cracked it on the first throw. ""We had to stop him,"" Lancaster said.  Lancaster set up short cones in twisting patterns, and he had Ingram reach down to touch each one as he dribbled the maze. At first, Ingram slowed to tap the cones. Eventually, he performed the drills at full speed.  ""My job is to show you how bad you are at something,"" Lancaster said. ""Some guys don't have the stomach for that. Brandon does.""  The choppier strides seemed to contrast with Keefe's work in L.A. helping Ingram use elongated steps getting to the basket. In reality, the skills were complementary -- for use in different scenarios. Honing them all -- digesting where and how to use which style of footwork -- took time."
"I see what you mean if you look at the stats of their first 4 years. But Smart was always elite defender that isn't your offensive focal point. He crash the boards, do other stuff in the offence and 100% hustle. Lonzo needs to be the ball handling guard just to be effective.  In all honesty, if I am the pels the trade was won with BI, not lonzo.  BI/Zion are the future of the franchise, if lonzo doesn't work out just move on"
"But Lonzo is terrible at that too. He's only really good in transition and the Pelicans have slowed down a ton which is what's actually hurting him. He's just not a threat with the ball in his hands. He isn't a good dribbler so he can't best guys on the perimeter and even if he does, he is a terrible finisher and even worse at the line. His best case scenario would be the Draymond role on offense making the 2nd pass on a 4 on 3 after someone has already broken down the defense. Or as a bench guy you bring out to run in transition as a change of pace. He's far too limited as a player to be your man ball handler."
Yeah feel like Ingram took a lot of his ball handling duties and now Lonzo is spending more time waiting in the corner/wing
"He was definitely drafted to pass and shoot, and if he wasnt and the Hornets took a Lonzo Ball 2.0 with garbage defense at third overall then holy fuck what a bad decision"
"He was definitely drafted for both, and if the Hornets drafted Lonzo Ball 2.0 with worse defense at THIRD OVERALL, then its a massive fucking error."
"the Ball bros have broken shot mechanics  &amp;#x200B;  at least Lamelo has some dog in him, so that automatially makes him better than Lonzo"
"I think Lonzo Ball also started so bad his rookie year he had the ""Kyle Singler"" when you sum all the shooting splits and it doesn't even reach 100"
"You nailed this exactly.  I feel like we can't even get to the BI/Zion possible issues because our shooting/shot creation is so abysmal.  Brandon Ingram is great as a ball-dominant player that sometimes leads the charge. That works just fine with Zion. He needs a secondary playmaker who will give him the ball though because he's also a great shooter, and so we need a point guard who can initiate offense and break up defenses.  Zion is still growing on defense, but he's a handful of trouble in the paint and once he picks up more shooting, he's gonna be a tough fucking guy to stop.  They both need a lot of space/a lot of paint and you can take turns running the offense through them. They can still give each other breaks against certain teams with their skillsets, and I think that's a good thing.  But right now, teams don't feel the need to guard anyone else. I've seen guys pay attention to Nickeil Alexander-Walker when he's on the court since his 37pt game, but most defenders can just flatout ignore Bledsoe, Josh, Lonzo, and sometimes even J.J., because Brandon and Zion are way more of a threat."
"I'd be happy for him if he got to play back in LA. He's an LA kid through and through. Lonzo is legitimately a solid dude and nice guy and I'm rootin' for him.  Kawhi is great at passing and getting open looks, but Lonzo could be the dude who passes the ball to him when he's open and he can be good in transition offense. Lonzo can give PG and Kawhi breaks and his defense is legit.  One thing is, Clips don't have any extra good shooters around do they? Would need to be a three-way deal or somehow other teams get involved in the trade."
Yeah that‚Äôs kind of the issue although I also don‚Äôt know if Bledsoe will still be on the team after this year so that might open up a spot. I don‚Äôt think you are forced to start Graham and not play him in a 6th man role also if Lewis and NAW were good enough to both warrant starting down the road  He‚Äôs an expiring but what about Lonzo ball and JJ Redick for evan Fournier? This one though I‚Äôm not sure I would actually do
Bledsoe is basically the PG.  Lonzo just vibes off ball
Imagine if lonzo were to break out with the clippers. The lonzo ball revenge tour in la
Scoop is crap but lonzo would be nice off the bench. We need a defensive guard that can rebound and move the ball without over dribbling.   Pelicans can use a scorer off the bench like lou :D
He is absolutely a point guard wtf. He'd get absolutely cooked by other wings  I like how every player who's good on defense is magically a 3+D player lol. I'm gonna live with Lonzo shooting the ball
"I watched some Pels games, and it seems like they have him playing off-ball quite a bit, with Bledsoe being the main point guard. I don't think that is putting Lonzo in the best situation to thrive."
"Play in tournament. High floor, low ceiling. Everyone needs the ball in their hand on offense without a clear best player.   The bigger question is what if instead of lonzo they kept Russell and drafted Tatum.   Russell Tatum Ingram Randle  Zubac"
"Ok so firstly, No team is ever off to a bad start when building around a guy like Zion when you already have a 23 yo all-star next to him now locked up for 5 years.   Steven Adams has literally been the least of our issues, probably our most consistent player, the extension was a little on the high side but for a guy who is a legit part of what you're trying to build then that's fine. Zion doesn't need a stretch 5, what he does need is consistency from our guards and perhaps a lengthy 3&amp;D forward off the bench which would allow him to play as a small ball 5 at a pinch, also you dont get a better rebounder than Steven Adams really lol.  Jax, even though I didnt like the pick at the time was always a project, bigs take years to develop, I hope it's the same with him. NAW has shown flashes, and at times looks like a legit guard that can play alongside BI and Zion. Kira has been actually pretty good in very limited minutes, we need to do something with the veteran guards+Lonzo to allow him more minutes but that'll come in time, but you can make the argument that all those picks haven't contributed quickly or weren't the right picks.  There is literally nothing in common with those AD/Jrue teams, those teams had zero assets, no real hope long-term, were constantly having band-aids thrown on them and just in general were always staring down the barrel of AD moving on. This team already has 2 young all-stars, 3 lotto tickets and like 15 draft picks that can be shifted for any sort of help."
"Lonzo is bad in half court offense, he‚Äôs terrible at going to the basket, and he has no assertiveness. NAW and Kira Lewis both run the point in half court with better pace, even BI does. Lonzo could be used as a off ball guard because he can catch and shoot at a decent clip. Ideally he‚Äôd buy into the role but I just don‚Äôt see it. He‚Äôs an enigma because at times he looks like a good pro but is just mostly frustrating to watch.   Off topic, but I hope CJ has a quick recovery. I‚Äôve always enjoyed watching him."
"Also, the entire league knew the Sixers were desperate for Fultz. If the Celtics stood pat and the Lakers picked Fultz at two, LA could have got the pick swap package and Lonzo Ball back in the trade."
2 future stars? Such disrespect on Lonzo Ball and ‚ÄòJason‚Äô Hart
"so happy for him. really wanted to see what he and ingram and lonzo grow together before the lebron show rolled into town. their rolling with zion now, who does bully ball even better, but obviously zion is more fragile than randle. and randle can sorta shoot."
Its more about our team lineups right now. He has to be such a ball hog and run around trying to make things happen because we dont have much of a choice with the quality of the scorers around him.   Last year when we had Jrue and got better shooting performances from Lonzo/Reddick it looked a lot smoother  Truth is we cant fully rely on running an offense completely through Zion as his style is so unique. We need a guy like Ingram who can create his own offense and take pressure off Zion if we want to compete. The real blame should be going to our starting backcourt IMO
Reminder that Lonzo Ball has more released rap songs than career made free throws.
Lonzo will be out of the league after this year when his contract his over. This is nothing more than releasing his frustration cause everyone knows LaMelo is the better Ball brother and the Lakers won promptly after dumping him to NOLA
Sounds like Lonzo needs to shit and and BALL hahahahahahaha

"Not even just the system, the personnel. Putting Adams, Bledsoe, and Lonzo Ball around him was like the biggest headscratcher of the offseason."
"Those dudes are too redundant, and playing them together makes the sum of their parts less than the individual parts because of it. If Lonzo isn‚Äôt able to grab boards and dish the ball(two of the few things he does above average), which he isn‚Äôt doing as much because Bledsoe takes up some of the same real estate that he does, he becomes a useless player out there"
Obviously? lol when was Kemba Walker vs Lonzo ball ever a debate? They're totally different types of players and on totally different levels.
"Bro's a Clippers fan, he's in denial by nature. Lakers are the number one team in LA and it's not close, they were selling out the Staples Center with Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball as the teams stars."

"Wow, I've never read this interview before. All facts from Cuban and so disappointing that we, as fans of the game, have to have so many blowhard idiots running around ruining the game we (and the players) love.   The Pelicans Celtics game yesterday was one of, if not THE, most poorly officiated game that I have ever seen all around (not in a way that was biased nor am I complaining that we got unfairly screwed).  From the blowhard-iness of the Redick ejection, then to the terrible goaltend call on a clean block by Williams in OT, then to Lonzo jumping and shuffling all over the place on not one but two inbounds passes, then to that shit 'foul' on Kemba, followed by a way-too-long review and turning into a jump ball that never would've happened if the refs didn't fuck up in the first place, and more.  I'm glad I didn't watch that game with any friends of mine who aren't big NBA fans or just less so, because holy shit I would have been embarrassed by that 3+ hour shitshow of refereeing."
"Yeah he can kind of shoot, that's correct. We put way too much stock into one number to describe 3pt shooting ability - overall 3pt %. You can look at the [tracking stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628366/shots-dash/) \- he's shooting almost all of his 3's open. That's Jae Crowder/PJ Tucker shooting. Those guys can also kind of shoot and they only hit a decent looking % b/c teams leave them alone. They aren't used to shooting with guys anywhere near them and when good defenses come along (especially playoff defenses), they suddenly regress and we're surprised. We shouldn't be. There's so much more to whether someone's a ""shooter"" than one %.  I do think Lonzo would be good defensively. I just think his offense would hurt. It's another guy teams aren't afraid to leave open and he can't handle the ball effectively in the half court. What's his role in the 35 min he'd need? Just standing in the corner as the outlet for Embiid after he gets double teamed? This team finally, finally found some real shooting (and they're winning with it) and you want to dilute it?"
Lonzo Ball
"&gt;Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he‚Äôs playing just isn‚Äôt logical. He‚Äôs in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  Except what happens when someone offers him 20 mill, you willing to match that? Because I'm still not, as much as I love Fred, Norm, OG and Siakam, that core taking up pretty much the entire cap is not a recipe for a championship.  &gt;We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  Except we do, everyone saw the Woj tweet and were like ""see he didn't do anything wrong"" but he actually had a plea deal to drop the charges, he still very likely did what he was charged with.  &gt;Even then we‚Äôre comparing two players who don‚Äôt necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  wtf? You are way overrating Zubac man, come on. He can play decent interior defense and catch lobs, that's it, Maxey is a rookie who has shown flashes of shot creation, which is hard to find in the league.  &gt;The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  Where? I gave you a ton of options that give you what Zubac can do, most of them would be cheap, a player that young and showing promise like him is not cheap, that's literally why they were so hesitant to trade him for fucking James Harden.  &gt;The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Schroeder I'll give you, except he'll most likely get 15 mill, Lonzo is an RFA, you are going to overpay to get him, Graham too, but go off.  &gt; trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird.  dude, like I said, you are overrating the shit out of Zubac, one of these players was the breaking point of a Harden trade, one of these players was dumped for no reason, which one is more valuable/talented? Idk you tell me"
"&gt;it's almost like Norm might be gone next season, and would not be surprised if we just don't bring TD back.  Assuming Norm is gone after this season after the way he‚Äôs playing just isn‚Äôt logical. He‚Äôs in all likelihood going to be our starting shooting guard for the foreseeable future. Assuming Tyrese Maxey is ready to fill his role is just plain wrong.  We have zero reason not to bring TD back next season.  &gt;I was specifically talking about a Lowry trade, give me talent over fit 100%, we are not in win now mode, especially if we are trading Lowry, missing out on Maxey + a first most likely just because Zubac is a center would be the worst thing you could do.   Even then we‚Äôre comparing two players who don‚Äôt necessarily have a clear cut advantage in talent.  &gt;You can find exactly what Zubac does in the 2nd round of a draft.   The same can be said for Tyrese Maxey. He literally almost was a second round pick.  &gt;You could go pick up Holmes as a FA. You can just take the salary filler that you get from a Lowry to Sixers trade and go get Mo Bamba or Birch, or Whiteside.  The same can be said for back up point guards. You can go pick up Dennis Schroeder. You can make an offer for Lonzo Ball. You can make an offer for Devonte Graham.  Lmao @ Whiteside.  I get our fanbase has a weirdo hate boner for the Clippers because you think they ‚Äústole‚Äù our players, but taking worse fitting packages and trying to rationalize it by overvaluing Maxey is just weird."
"I think the refs should have a post game press conference like the players and coaches do.  I would love to hear an explanation for why jj redick got ejected from the Celtics v Pelicans game, or why lonzo ball was allowed to move before inbounding the ball.  I think it would take a lot of steam out of the fans if they heard the refs admit, yeah we missed the flop on harden on further review.  Might make people relate more and might take all the ego out of the refs on the floor if they know they have to be accountable after the game.  Just a thought."
"That seems highly disrespectful to rubio to say. He can actually run half court offense which is really valuable. Lonzo is a good transition passer but he‚Äôs not anywhere near in the same league as an overall playmaker. If Lonzo was as bad of a scorer as rubio is i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be able to last very long in any teams rotation. We‚Äôve seen that proven in the bubble and the start of this year. If his 3 isn‚Äôt falling he becomes unplayable. Rubio made a career with no 3 ball because he‚Äôs a savant in running offense and half court playmaking, as well as consistently bringing it defensively."
"And though I hate to admit it, Lonzo Ball is a good on ball defender. And yesterday even Josh Hart seemed like one"
Lonzo ball believers. There are dozens of us.
"No one fucking acts like that, Lakers fans just like Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram so they are invested in their growth. It's literally not that deep"
"What a comeback by the Pelicans. Here are just some observations so feel free to comment on or correct them!   - Lonzo's really trying to expand his game. Compared to the last few times I've seen him play, he looks more comfortable getting into the bodies of his defenders en route to the rim. He's actually really athletic so he's still learning how to balance brute force and touch but once that comes along, I feel like he could be really good. I just think he could use a little more verticality in his finishes. Would be nice if his free throw rate increased.   - Again with Lonzo, he's generally a liberal help defender on the perimeter but having him on Tatum was making it hard for him to float towards the top of the key to bother Kemba or whoever had the ball. But when on Kemba or someone else, he was everywhere on defense, jumping passing lanes, smothering drives, and more.   - In a similar fashion, I can see Ingram trying tighter passes and slowly whittling away at some of his poorer shot selection. He's learning to be more patient on the ball, varying stride length and manipulating defenders to create openings for himself and others. I do think he could learn how to operate on the baseline as a playmaker a little more, similar to how Lowry and Jokic do.   - Zion's handles are a lot tigher than I remember. Is this a new thing or has he always been that good? Dude is legitimately unstoppable with or without momentum in the paint.   - That trio of Zo, Zion, and Ingram are going to be so good in a few years. Really hope you guys can keep all of them.   - The C's seem to have such a fluid and dynamic transition game, I don't really know why they don't look to run ahead more often? Is it because they're selective that they seem so successful? Someone tell me.   - I've been carefully watching Tatum's growth, especially over the last 2 years, and it seems as if his rapid offensive jumps have somewhat plateaued for now. His motion shooting is as smooth as ever but his primary playmaking isn't still coming along as I'd hoped it would. For example, he gets a little disoriented attempting to dismantle unexpected doubles, whether he splits them and goes downhill, resets, or passes out. I know this is rather nitpicky but I truly think Tatum has Top 7 potential and jumping from a self-generating wing to a playmaking wing (ex. LeBron) could catapult him there."
"Oh yeah the refs fucking blew all around and needed to correct calls. But it absolutely ruined the viewing. They threw out JJ for no reason, called a phantom foul on Lonzo when we had the ball that ended up with a jump ball (WTF is that rule), called the ball out on you when Kemba was the only one there, we mugged meli with 10 seconds left in OT, and Lonzo took a walk down easy street on the last inbound.   Somehow the refs managed to miss tons of calls and make all the wrong ones. Sucks because the end of the game had some awesome plays when they were actually playing."
"Didn‚Äôt watch the whole game, but the refs in OT were horrible lol. They make a bad call and instead of the Celtics retaining possession it became a jump ball? Lonzo can take 2 steps on an inbounds pass and no travel call? Double lane violation on a made free throw? A potentially amazing game was ruined with weird calls and excessive reviews. Love seeing the Celtics lose tho lmfao"
"jaylen's defense in that last min was awful, got shook by brandon, then left brandon wide open   i also don't understand when Lonzo was inbounding why Tatum didn't deny Ingram the ball when he came to get it, everyone else was up court"
"jaylen's defense in that last min was awful, got shook by brandon, then left brandon wide open   i also don't understand when Lonzo was inbounding why Tatum didn't deny Ingram the ball when he came to get it, everyone else was up court  and lastly, Tatum is absolutely 6'10, it was all no way when Brad said it, but he def looks taller"
Lonzo so obviously didn't want to get the ball back
Zion is 415th in the league in defensive real plus-minus.   Bledsoe is 439. Lonzo at 361. Kira at 383. Redick 389.   What exactly is Stan doing down there on the defensive side of the ball?

"zion only averages 5 less touches than ingram (54 vs 59)  he gets the ball a decent amount, just doesn't do anything with it most of the time  he gets more front court touches than lonzo..."
Lonzo biggity ball
"37% on 6 per game as a PG is very, very good. The narrative was and is wrong.   &gt; And they have him at the 2 which is the position normally reserved for a scorer when that‚Äôs not his game.  Bledsoe is listed as the 2 and Lonzo at 1. He spends all that time off-ball intentionally.   Part of it is Bledsoe and Ingram needing the ball and part of it is Lonzo just not being much better than them with the ball."
"Quotes from Shams:  &gt;New Orleans has been receiving calls about the availability of Lonzo Ball and JJ Redick and has shown an openness to discussing trades around both with interested teams, sources tell¬†The Athletic.  The literal dude who wrote the article said OTHER TEAMS WERE CALLING.  &gt;teams are going to recognize that and they are going to show interest in the players they covet,"" Griffin said. ""... And I think you saw Lonzo Ball come out in the first half and prior to turning the ankle, he had one of his best halves of the year.""¬†  From your own article you just shared. For the last time. Lonzo was not on the trade block, teams were just calling about him."
"Sorry but my understanding of the reports differs as nicely reported on here: [David Griffin discusses how Lonzo Ball has responded to trade rumors](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2928827-pelicans-david-griffin-discusses-how-lonzo-ball-has-responded-to-trade-rumors)  Also, do you think any team is calling the Pels enquiring about Zion? Griffin would probably laugh and hang up on them immediately leading to zero trade rumors."
Lonzo ball  Zach Lavine   Evan Fournier  Nikola Vucevic   Deaaron fox  Just to name a few
"Because the story literally never said they were looking to trade Lonzo. The story said ""teams are calling about Lonzo Ball, and Griffin is listening"""
"He put up 17/7/4 as the clear 4th option on 50/38/85 shooting last year.   ‚ÄúLol. People love extreme takes here‚Äù   ‚ÄúLonzo ball could get a max contract‚Äù  Yeah, sure!"
"The fact that you are in this thread still comparing Duncan and Lonzo‚Äôs shooting is hilarious. Duncan wishes he even got 1/4 of the looks that lonzo does. The defense is constantly worrying where Duncan is off ball, which opens up the entire Miami defense. Just admit you‚Äôre a box score guy it‚Äôs okay"
Hayward getting max is not the same thing as Lonzo Ball getting a max lol   Hayward was really good last year when he played.
"Show me where the Lakers found value in Ball, please? He only played 99 of 164 regular season games. Of those games his stats were shaky at best.   Who picks someone overall #2 to trade them away without telling them less than 2 years later.   Is that a sign of him living up to potential/fitting in/ what Bron wanted?   (The answer is no)  He didn‚Äôt give the Lakers any reason to keep him, silly!   Get outta here thinking Lonzo is a valid NBA caliber player. He‚Äôs a C- at best."
"Lonzo and WB don't have the same problems though. Lonzo's problem was that he wasn't shooting the ball properly, and WB doesn't have that problem. He just can't shoot.  I'm not saying it's impossible for WB but he's a previous MVP,  has great work ethic and is smart enough to know he has to fix it. It's the most valuable asset on the court, and he's been in the league for 13 seasons. He's had to have searched for the best shooting coaches before and as a previous MVP, teams are definitely doing as much as they can for him. Some people just aren't meant to do certain things."
"I dont disagree with alot of what you said at a macro level. The biggest issue for me is I dont think Lonzo really solves two of those issues to the same degree I think you do   a) Whatever his %s are nobody guards him. Teams dont care they let him shoot. It's kind of the issue with last years Sixers you have all these guys like Richardson and Horford who's %s look fine but nobody actually guards so it doesnt actually help with spacing and makes things clunky. Lonzo is a high volume 3 point shooter yes but he's just not someone with alot of actual floor spacing value.   b) I think his other limitations really limit the viability of his playmaking in a half court setting. Full court and transition his passing is sick but he's frankly just a worse version of Ben Simmons at that you dont want to take the ball out of Ben's hands for that. Like he's not a bad half court passer, I just dont really think he's really providing value there and he's not the type who can be an ""offensive organizer"" type in the half court.   Im actually fine with Danny cant move his feet but as your 2nd perimeter defender I think it's fine. Only matchup where a team's no 2 guy is really gonna hurt him is BKN and frankly Lonzo wont really change alot about that matchup either.  I think the idealized form of Lonzo is basically as a 3+D wing who throws cool outlet passes and make some back cuts in half court. He just provides too little value in the half court for me to really be someone Id want to pursue if Philly. I'm fine giving him 3 yrs $42 mil, I would be concerned about him getting like 4 yrs $90 mil which I would be very much out on."
"i feel like lonzo isn‚Äôt really the *ideal* player the sixers need, but the problem is that the ideal player the sixers need is not available at the moment   outside of an actual backup center, the sixers need three things really: shooters (especially willing shooters), passers/playmakers (Simmons is the only above average passer on the team) and versatile defenders (preferably to defend guards; green is cooked as far as man defense goes). lowry is ideal, but he‚Äôs tough to attain if he even becomes available. lonzo would at least provide some of those needs, and could play in a variety of lineups (with ben as an off ball wing shooter type, and in place of ben to keep the grab n go energy up a bit when ben rests).   his lack of ability to dribble penetrate definitely hurts, but guys that can dribble penetrate that are also good enough to play with ben and jo are pretty scarce on the trade market. his defense is a tad overrated imo but he‚Äôs still a marked upgrade over basically everyone other than embiid and simmons. the team badly needs smart players that shoot threes at a high clip and i think he‚Äôd excel in that role here  and i‚Äôd be comfortable extending him for around luke kennard money in the summer. maybe a little bit more, top out at like 20 mil per (i think that‚Äôs what hollinger pegged him as worth)"
"I'd rather have Duncan still. It depends entirely on your team  With lonzo you still need a playmaker. Lonzo isn't a primary playmaker - he's a secondary one. He thrives next to another ball handler, but he's not great at being the one that initially breaks the defense down.    There's a bigger shooting difference than you're imagining."
"Point is the gap in their shooting is not as big as the gap between their defense, playmaking, ball handling, IQ, etc. Lonzo is the better player it shouldn‚Äôt even be a debate lol"
Lol most heat fans want lonzo ball lmao and are willing to give up Robinson
Mr Pelican's fan sir. Can you explain to me why zion gets so few shots a game? I haven't been watching y'all games recently but he always shoots ungodly percentages on low FGA. Is it a fitness thing or are people just not getting the ball to them. If the latter do you think it's more of a coach issue or a fault of lonzo/ur other playmakers. Thanks in advance
"When did I say he was??? Duncan Robinson takes difficult shots because he can hit them, defenses HAVE to play him closely. Lonzo Ball ain‚Äôt taking those shots because when he does. [Here ](https://youtu.be/yQzml8gs1R4) are the type of shots Robinson is taking. You can‚Äôt compare the two, like at all. Hypothetically if a player in the NBA showed up one day and shot 30% on full court shots on 5 attempts a game is he the same level of shooter as Giannis?"
Lonzo Ball Career:  34.8% on 5.9 attempts per game  Duncan Robinson Career: 42.4% on 7.6 attempts per game  Body of work matters. This season is still too small of a sample size.
"No that really doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Like seriously, this is peak r/nba right here. If Duncan Robinson had the same shot selection as Lonzo Ball his percentages would be way up. You can‚Äôt compare a wide open three to a moving three off a screen"
I think he‚Äôs talking about the thread about a Lonzo Ball trade to Heat for Duncan Robinson.
"Why in the hell would we trade one of the best shooters in the NBA for Lonzo Ball? We're in the bottom chunk in 3p%. It doesn't matter whatever other things Lonzo does better, we can't afford to lose Dunc."
"You mad? I‚Äôm not saying Lonzo is a better 3 point shooter (he‚Äôs not) but the gap between them in defense, ball-handling, and passing is MUCH larger than the gap in shooting."
"Lonzo shoots the same from 3 and he‚Äôs a much better ball-handler, passer, and defender..."
"Lonzo is shooting basically the same from 3 and he‚Äôs a much better ball-handler, passer, and defender...  Oh and he‚Äôs 3 years younger"
"It‚Äôs not even potential. Lonzo is shooting 39% from 3 on 8 attempts this season and he‚Äôs a far better ball-handler, passer, and defender."
"they stay hating on ball bro, the potential he has over Robinson is worth it even though Robinson is elite at three-point shooting. Lonzo can impact the game a lot more under the right resources"
"Okay chris we understand but you are trash talking fucking lonzo ball. Dude only there cause he got traded not cause he want to be lmao lonzo probably like ""you can have it shit"""
"No way! I remember before he came to the NBA, everyone was essentially labeling him a kid wonder who is going to be something to watch in the league. While he‚Äôs no Sebastian Telfair when it comes to ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù to outright bad, but he did not live up to the hype surrounding him.  Lonzo Ball is a modern comparison."
Lonzo ball is steph curry with a 40 inch vertical
Lonzo Ball syndrome
"You said he could have easily been another Jason Kidd, and he just isn‚Äôt as talented as Kidd was. He‚Äôs a great passer like Kidd was, and he is a good defender/rebounder for a guard, but Kidd was a much better ball handler and athlete.  You can say my logic is stupid if you want, but I find it hard to believe that you watched much of Jason Kidd if you think Lonzo is on a similar level talent-wise."
Lonzo Ball will surpass Ray Allen as a shooter if he keeps this up.
Lonzo Ball
hard to bring in another ball dominant pg with coby white already on the roster. lavine also needs the ball in his hands. i dont know why bulls are targeting lonzo. they really like the defensive minded pgs. they were high on dunn but he eventually went to atl.
"Zion was screaming BALL! BALL! BALL!, and everyone thought he was calling the play for Lonzo..."
No excuses. Zion had to at least touch the ball. Anything else over the course of that amount of key 4th quarter play just boils down to bad coaching. The whole works knew Lonzo was not about to hit that last shot. The few final offensive sequences for the Pelicans were hard to watch.
"He shot the ball with 2.8 seconds left, I am not sure how he could have passed it to Zion there?   This was on SVG, the ball should have gone to Zion right away but it looks like the play was designed for Ingram (who was bad shooting all night) and then I am not sure why Lonzo decided to shoot with 8 seconds left. Zion being so hot with Portlands lack of interior defense, it should have been Zion making the play  https://twitter.com/WillGuillory/status/1362260090397413378"
"He was playing hero ball near the end of the 4th and only passed it out when he didn't have a shot. Killed a lot of clock too. JJ, Lonzo and Zion were hitting big shots but Bi just had some crazy tunnel vision."
Give him the damn ball. Foh with lonzo and BI taking contested pull ups
Lonzo ‚Äú Best shooter in the NBA ‚Äú Ball
"Do you think Lonzo Ball is more important than Doncic, KD, and Tatum?"
"1. About the Drummond situation, I don't think that Draymond has a problem with the Cavs not playing Drummond because he is on the trading block but rather how he was pulled from the bench and had to change attire, and continue to watch the game from the sidelines. If the organization wants him not to play, the proper way would be to inform the player before he arrives to the stadium to play to avoid the embarrassing situation that occured yesterday.   2. About Harrison Barnes being traded during a game and other players finding out from third-party or being straight-up lied to by GMs about where they stand with the team, players should be the first ones to find out if they have been traded so they can start preparing themselves and their FAMILIES without facing unwanted extra media attention. Furthermore, players should be informed if the team is entertaining trade offers for them so that they can mentally prepare themselves and their FAMILIES that they might have to relocate.  3. Thirdly, if the teams can publicly announce that they are going to trade a player, why can't a player publicly demand a trade? The team doesn't have to trade them if they don't want to. It's not like teams never leak information on players to the media without informing them.  4. If a player is going to be traded, and is not going to play why should he have to attend the games? What sense does it make for him to attend the games if he will inevitably be traded?  5. There is a reason trash teams remain trash. If Draymond was drafted by almost in any other team by the warriors, he would probably be out of the league right now. While young players like Markelle Fultz in Philadelphia, Lonzo Ball on the Lakers were constantly ridiculed for not living upto their potential; organizations such as the Portland Trailblazers never receive any backclash for ruining the career of a promising talent like Greg Oden by using experimental medical techniques; the San Antonio Spurs medical staff giving Kawhi Leonard the green light to play even with his constant protests, and later it was found out that he had several problems such as hematoma, tendinopathy, etc.  Finally, the NBA cannot be analysed in isolation of fans and media as they all exist in a nexus."
"Love how SVG is using him as point Zion. For those that didn‚Äôt watch, he was legitimately bringing the ball up the court after a made shot and Lonzo was running to the post. Memphis had no answer to the point Zion pick and roll and they‚Äôre not a terrible defensive team.   Pelicans just need to get an average defense together and they can be an outside contender. Zion isn‚Äôt helping much on the defensive end and gets lost on rotations frequently. To be expected for a 20 year old."
Lonzo ball
BI was already looking like a stud before he had to sit out with blood clots  Lonzo was playing great along side Lebron before they both got hurt too  Hart was always a pretty good role player. Defended the post well and got a lot of O rebounds  Kuz has improved off ball and defense since he got drafted  Caruso was a g leaguer turned into key rotation player  THT had a huge jump just from last season to this season already to the point where he was taking minutes from vets  Clarkson was always a bucket getter. He‚Äôs in a better situation than he was with us fighting to even sniff the playoffs let alone have a top seeded team
"Lonzo Ball would be better in LP‚Äôs system and Trae would add much needed spacing to the Pels, never going to happen as Trae is ATL‚Äôs default franchise player but would be interesting to watch"
"&gt;Isn‚Äôt that also true to your statement?  I'm not sure to what you are referring here.  &gt; Take BI as an example, his increase in production is also due to efficiency.    Which has climbed every season, as he gets stronger and learns the league.  .442 -&gt; .497 -&gt; .518 with the Lakers.  Then .531 -&gt; .536 with New Orleans.  About exactly what you'd expect from a raw 19 year-old draft pick.  &gt; Why couldn‚Äôt Lakers develop these kids shooting is beyond me. Lonzo shoots 38% from 3 since joining the Pels, and 74% on free throw this year albeit on low volume.   Did you see Ball shoot as a rookie?  With some of the worst and most-bizarre mechanics around?  I cannot imagine what his father was thinking, not teaching the kid to shoot properly.  Most people thought his shot couldn't be fixed.  That said, he did improve from .305 as a rookie to .329 in his second season.  &gt;I believe if they have stayed with the Lakers they would also continue to improve, but the lack of good coaching and toxicity around the organization   There was nothing wrong with the coaching, as the many improvements show, but the constant trade talk did effect many of the young players negatively.  There's not a whole lot the Lakers could do about that, except not sign James."
"Isn‚Äôt that also true to your statement?   Take BI as an example, his increase in production is also due to efficiency.  Close to 40% fg, 85% free throw, lower turnover despite handling the ball more.  If he hasn‚Äôt improved on those, the coach would probably use Bledsoe / Jrue more.  Why couldn‚Äôt Lakers develop these kids shooting is beyond me.  Lonzo shoots 38% from 3 since joining the Pels, and 74% on free throw this year albeit on low volume.    I believe if they have stayed with the Lakers they would also continue to improve, but the lack of good coaching and toxicity around the organization, in particular the year with Lebron, must have dented the growth even so slightly."
"They are kinda bad fit with each other that a trade would be inevitable.  Randle and Nance share the same position, Ingram/Clarkson/D'lo needs the ball to effective(altho JC can be moved to the bench).  Lonzo is also a bad fit since he is an inconsistent shooter so he can't space it with the other guys.   Just those six guys will already cost you 100M+ and you still have guys like Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, Caruso that needs to get paid."
"I mean, if anything that's the part of their roster that actually works together. Yes, they both need the ball, but Zion is currently mostly a paint scorer while BI is an outside shooter/midrange guy. They can take turns with the ball like so many other great duos have. What they need is some 3 and D defend and defer types around them, who can hit their shots and don't need the ball in their hands to be effect. Lonzo could be this but his limitations are hamstrung by playing with Bledsoe and Adams. Adams has been good this year, but he's not realistically what the Pelicans need."
"I'd be curious to see how good an All-""Former Young Lakers Players"" team would look in current day. The lineup would be something like:  PG: D'Angelo Russell/Lonzo Ball  SG: Jordan Clarkson/Josh Hart  SF: Brandon Ingram/David Nwaba  PF: Julius Randle/Larry Nance Jr.  C: Ivaca Zubac/Thomas Bryant"
"&gt; You have two ball brothers Lonzo and Lamelo.   Their grandfather Cedric\* played for the Clippers thirty years ago.  &amp;#x200B;  \*he isn't really, as far as I know"
And Lonzo Ball is the best they can do?
I would not do this! Coby White has lots of potential and is still on a nice rookie contract. Lonzo Ball is looking to get paid.
I‚Äôm pretty sure there are more than 40 players in the league that are better than Lonzo Ball
The whole ball family trying to cover up MJ. LaMelo at MJs team. Lonzo looking like he's going to MJs old team. Lavar said he was better than MJ at one on one. All they need is Liangelo to get a degree from UNC
There's no real flexibility until Kemba is off the books. We're handcuffed into mediocrity because of that signing. I love Kemba but he's a defensive liability and a knee injury waiting to happen.   The Cs best bet is to find a bigger pass first defensive pg like Rubio or Ball and a 3&amp;D big/wing (because they are so easy to find...) then let Kemba run the second unit or be that spark plug off the bench.    I keep saying this but I want the Cs to pursue Mo Bamba &amp; Lonzo Ball then let them play and grow with Tatum and Brown. Hope Langford gets healthy &amp; give Nesmith &amp; Rob Williams as much playing time as possible so we can tackle a ship next year.  We should be aware that Semi and Theis are both free agents after this season and I don't know if the Cs will be able to re-sign either.
Not OP but Lonzo Ball.
"I‚Äôm not really good at making this, but the one I like the most is:  Lonzo (1$), Curry (3$), Kawhi (5$), PJ Tucker (2$), Domantas Sabonis (4$).  Everyone can shoot the 3 ball, got some good defenders in Kawhi, PJ and Lonzo. Got some good playmaking as well (maybe too much actually lol) with Lonzo, Sabonis and eventually Kawhi who can be a point forward. Idk, every possible team as flaws obviously, this is just the one I like the most"
"House! I gotta say it works, right? Like, it shouldn't, but it does! Here's what we know. We haven't seen a lopsided 2-guard trade since the Harden trade. Could LaVine be that kind of guy? If I'm the Bulls, I'm looking at that deal with Lonzo like yeah his dad's a headache but he can be like an off-ball point guard which we've seen - we've seen with the Lakers and Nuggets - it can work! All these teams just chucking up threes, who else would you want but a good 3-point shooter who can play D right?"
"He doesn't fit *great* with Lavine. They both are score first guys and they really only win when they're both some degree of on with their perimeter shot, which makes LaVine worry more about distributing and running the offense then he probably has business doing. I like the Lonzo fit because he's big, doesn't really *need* to score to be effective, but still can run the offense while also giving a lot better effort on defense then White. White probably shouldn't be a high volume ball handler (pretty low AST guy and AST:TO is only around 2 for his career so far) and will probably move to the 2 at his next destination if I had to guess"
"Lonzo ""The Octopus"" Ball"
like lonzo ball üëÄ
Like Lonzo Ball ?
Should trade him to Hornets for Devonte Graham and some other pieces or picks. Graham can maybe bounce back in NO. Maybe send Zeller for Drummond who wouldn't get tempted to handle the ball with 4 other playmakers. Hornets have some young ok but not great prospects and mid firsts they can send out. A Lonzo trade seems more about finding a trade partner who highly values him then getting a specific piece back. Main purpose is to make the Hornets entertaining which seems like Jordans main concern.
"Lol different kinds of shooters tho. Lonzo is considerably more open since the other team's game plan isn't ""holy crap we need to not let this guy shoot the ball"""
Lonzo won me a nice little bet last night with his 3 point shooting. Dude has really improved his shooting but ok let‚Äôs make who posts dedicated to one air ball.
"Chino Hills first started primarily with Lonzo‚Äôs hype being a top pick of his class. LaMelo was more of a sideshow. I know there‚Äôs casuals out there who watch abit of Lonzo, heard about Lavar and the Ball bros and then turned off the TV. They heard the hype but felt ‚Äòmehh‚Äô about it. when Lonzo turned out a ‚Äòbust‚Äô, people come out the floodgates saying Lavar talks a bunch of crap and the Ball bros are overrated.  They bunch Gelo and Lamelo and said they‚Äôre overhyped because of Lonzo. while Gelo is indeed overhyped (which is obvious you watch him play, dude doesn‚Äôt have bball savvy), Melo has incredible handles since young and has massive confidence (pointing at the logo and hitting it as a kid). He was smooth af on the court. Anybody who watch him would know he‚Äôs a top pick talent. But these ‚Äòhaters‚Äô calling him bust never actually watched him. Just bunched him with his brothers."
Sometimes I wonder how the fk the Ball bros get so much hype and nobody actually watches LaMelo play. It‚Äôs like they only watch Lonzo at Chinos and assume all Ball bros are overhyped lol.   LaMelo was on some Kyrie swagger since then.
Is Kidd and Lonzo Ball comparable? Kidd can't shoot in the early part of his career. Can Ball follow the same path?
"Who? Like Ben Simmons? Mike Conley? Even Chris Paul? Those guys are all scoring similarly to Lonzo. Conley and paul a bit better (though Lonzo has a better eFG% than Paul), but those guys and long time vets.  Anyway, I don't know how you can watch lonzo and think it makes sense to not have him distributing the ball."
"I also think that Fultz deal is absolutely moronic. He isn't an elite defender, his three ball is still an abomination, and he's just *pretty good* as a lead guard. Like, where does he rank on your list of one guards? Will he ever be a top-20 starting PG? I don't think so. He might not even really be a top-30 PG. Like, you could talk me into DiVincenzo or Jalen Brunson or DeAnthony Melton being better.  I mean, Lonzo seems better than Fultz, but *still* isn't clearly an above average lead guard."
"Obligatory Lonzo Ball post. Get this man off the Pelicans already! Let him shine, he's clearly capable of more than just being a mediocre 3 and D guard."
"Bledsoe I agree isnt the answer longterm but theres not too many players they can easily replace Lonzo with. He's shooting the 3 ball at an efficient clip and even though he got torched by lavine and luka the last 2 games he's one of the best perimeter defenders in the league who can cover multiple positions with his length as a taller guard, and on top of that he's a good playmaker whenever the team needs him to be and is 2nd in total +/- on his team through the season so far. He's an RFA after this season, so the only reason they should consider trading him is if they dont want to match any offers from a team like the bulls who will probably throw him a bag or if a player like bradley beal becomes available"
"Visiting in June, never been. You seem to really love the city. What's good to do/eat/drink for someone who doesn't have Lonzo Ball money? Gimme some recs."
"Right those guys you listed are helped tremendously, guys like Kuzma, Cody Martin, Pat Connaughton, Lonzo Ball, and etc would get less. Maxes help the players which is why PA votes for them, no maxes hurt them. I wasn‚Äôt arguing with OP just agreeing with him with more info"
"I absolutely agree with you. I can understand why someone like Lonzo Ball, who has no connection with this city and has grown up in LA his entire life, wouldn't want to live here. I also have no problem with it. Why should I tell him where he should live and how he should feel about it?  I just hate that some of these comments are ignorant to the city. ""Maybe he doesn't like the smell of piss and vomit?"" Bourbon St is not New Orleans. Bourbon St is 98% tourists and dead beats. There is a lot more to the French Quarter than Bourbon. ""There is a lot of poverty in New Orleans"" yeah no shit. Just like every other major city. People are acting like New Orleans is this blighted community in this thread."
"Dude you don‚Äôt know what YOU are talking about.   Sliding Murray to the two puts him in a position where he‚Äôs more comfortable playmaking and scoring, while lonzo can act as a pure backcourt facilitator for MPJ/Gordon/Jok/Murray.   Having Lonzo as PG means having a defensive minded, intelligent point guard who is capable of spreading the ball to all 4 of our playmakers in their ideal roles on the court. Sounds way fuckin better to me than Barton chucking up 12-18 shots a night &amp; adding little to no team/system value the way Lonzo would."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Bam Adebayo 3. Donovan Mitchell 4. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 5. John Collins 6. OG Anunoby 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jonathan Isaac 9. Jarrett Allen 10. Derrick White
"Yep, he'd replace Barton. You have it exactly right.  Murray/Lonzo/MPJ/Gordon/Jokic is sorta the dream starting 5 to me.  Lonzo guards the best perimeter player, Gordon guards the best wing, both Lonzo and Gordon just slide into great off ball roles on offense with the Murray/Jokic 2 man game continuing to lead the way, MPJ continuing to be an 6'10 Klay who can also crash the boards like crazy.  We would be insane on both ends, tbh"
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Donovan Mitchell  3. Bam Adebayo 4. John Collins 5. OG Anunoby  6. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 7. Lonzo Ball 8. Jarrett Allen 9. Jonathan Issac 10. Kyle Kuzma
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Donovan Mitchell 3. Bam Adebayo  4. OG Anunoby 5. De‚ÄôAaron Fox 6. Lonzo Ball 7. Johnathan Isaac 8. Jarret Allen 9. John Collins 10. Kuzma  Honorable mention to Chris Boucher who would probably go somewhere 15-25.
Lonzo seems cool too. Those Ball boys just want to put in work.
"Man I'm from there and I love it, but there's absolutely no reason for someone with Lonzo Ball money and fame to live in Nola. Other major cities have so much more to offer for guys like that.  Plus Nola is dirty af and dangerous in a large portion of the city."
"i thought about it and i felt like Herro really is a 2 Guard, i think some players here will probably spend their careers playing the 2 guard aswell but for now it makes sense to have them on this list (Maledon, Quickley, Kira Lewis, Sexton, Poole, Coby White &amp; Cole Anthony, potentially Haliburton &amp; Lonzo too but these 2 are pretty much well rounded guards that probably aren‚Äôt your no.1 ball handler"
Lonzo Ball is among those on the list that we're looking at
Lonzo ball üíØ
" Now : Luka &gt;&gt;&gt; Trae &gt; Shai  &gt;Sexton &gt; Ja &gt; Lonzo &gt; Fultz &gt; Lamelo &gt; Haliburton &gt; Garland &gt; Quickley &gt; THT(not a primary ball handler hard to compare) KPJ &gt; White &gt; Maledon &gt;  Poole (sample size is too small to put higher)   &amp;#x200B;  Future : Luka &gt; Shai &gt; Ja &gt; Trae &gt; Lamelo &gt; KPJ (either he's that high or he's in China in 3 years no middle ground) &gt; Haliburton &gt; Sexton &gt; Lonzo &gt; Garland &gt; THT &gt; Fultz &gt; Quickley  &gt; Maledon &gt; White &gt; Poole  &amp;#x200B;  I didn't include Anthony and Lewis haven't seen them enough, IMO White and Poole are more 6th many type, and THT isn't a point guard"
"It's not like this is the first guy who said Lonzo to New York/Chicago though.  All the noise seems to be suggesting it'll come down to if the Pelicans think Lonzo is worth whatever these two teams will offer him in free agency.  It's not up to Lonzo at the end of the day, the ball is in the Pelicans' court."
"This is tough, but number one would be New Orleans just because of the insane draft capital they have over the next several years. It also doesn't hurt that they have Zion williamson, Brendan ingram, Lonzo ball, etc  I'd probably choose the Nets as number two just because they have three superstars that can each fetch you three to five draft picks along with other assets if traded."
"I'm not sure they were building much. They made fine enough draft picks, but every one of them looked either mediocre to busttown. D'Angelo's career was in jeopardy. Randle wasn't there yet. Ball looked world's better last year. Lonzo is only now starting to look like the prospect who was advertised.  I think the Lakers were just terrible at developing talent. I bet Kuzma becomes a monster when they eventually trade him."

"I think its a lot more of a conversation than ppl give it credit for.  Better ball handler, better passer, much better defender, shooting the 3 way above league avg, and in many lineups is the 5th offensive option.  I do think demar is better, but i think theres a decent argument there for lonzo"
Like what some else said the boner you kids have for lamelo is comical....So Weird. I remember how Ball fans attacked Detroit for waiving Dianglo. This aint reality TV no more its the NBA get real kid. Lamelo nice and is incredibly similar to Lonzo. But he is not Jordan...he isn‚Äôt even Zion lol. He went 3rd in the draft for a reason. You need a reality check
Lakers fans really thought we were going to trade Dame for ... Lonzo Ball.
"Pelicans are a terrible defensive team, Luka def won't help on that end. And he is not a very good perimeter shooter. He is better at creating his own shot from the perimeter than Zion, but he is not a very efficient perimeter player. He will run the offense, but Lonzo and Ingram need the ball in their hands to be at their best, they are not spot-up shooters. I still see them being at most an 8th seed. Mainly cause Luka will win then a couple of close games down the stretch. Since he is better at creating his own shot than Zion and controls the entire offense."
"It's crazy how slow our offense gets when Zion is off the floor. If he's not creating looks for people, it just becomes bad ISO-ball and confusion.  Like the Miami/Pels game they rested Zion before ASG and BI/Lonzo couldn't get anything going."
"Let‚Äôs see the picks that surrounded them. Tatum was chosen over the consensus first overall pick Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Jackson.   Jaylen was drafted over Dragan Bender and Kriss Dunn.   Marcus Smart was drafted next to Nik Stauskas, Noah Vonleh, Dante Exum, and Jabari Bird.  At what point are we gonna dispel the idea that just because you are drafting high means that the pick is going to work out. It‚Äôs absolutely crazy to not reward GM‚Äôs for making the correct pick, even high in the draft.   Jayson is the best player out of everybody in his draft class. Jaylen is the best player in his as well (I personally think he‚Äôs better than Simmons because Simmons can just get schemed out in the playoffs and has been in the past).   I seriously don‚Äôt know why people use this as an argument."
"BI played like trash too but he still had 30. The problem with BI isn't the same as Bledsoe because he's young with talent Bledsoe doesn't and never will have. They got to figure out what's going on in his head when he decides to play hero ball and make him realize he's not the closer on the team and they need to make him either play off ball more or start trying to set up his teammates in better ways.   SVG is also a problem, I don't know if he's the one allowing this playstyle, but he needs to do something about it. His rotations also suck, he froze Lonzo in the fourth when he could've went for maybe 20 assists and he continually allows Zion to get froze out in close games like this as well. (He got some touches down the stretch but not even close to the amount he should)"
"We gave the ball to Zion multiple times in the final minute  At the end we gave it to BI up 3 expecting him to hit both free throws since he shoots 88%. He missed both.  Then, Lonzo passed it to NAW because he was open on the inbound. He dropped the pass."
Lonzo fans are the worst. I really like the guy but i‚Äôm tired of these ‚Äúfans‚Äù shitting on the Pelicans because their favorite player is there. I hope he leaves so i don‚Äôt have to hear their bullshit claims of ‚Äúhe needs the ball more‚Äù and ‚Äúhe‚Äôs better than BI‚Äù. If you can‚Äôt create your own scoring you will not have the ball in your hands. Especially when 2 very talented scorers are on the team.

His best strength is his passing. He‚Äôs the type of player who needs the ball in his hands to make plays for others very often to maximize his potential. He has improved his off ball potential a lot now with his improved 3 point shooting but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Lonzo is most successful when he can dribble the ball often and make plays for others
Falling over when lonzo made slight contact on a screen w/o the ball. The fact you think he deserved every call he got is ridiculous.
If you every wondered why so many teams wanted Lonzo Ball this game is a prime example.
Lonzo Ball scary hours
Lonzo needs to know how much gravity he has now. Teams are starting to see he can shoot the ball at a good rate so he should utilize the PnR even more.
"Lonzo, LaMelo, LiAngelo. The 3 Ball generation."
"7-10 in RPM are Devonte Graham, Mike Conley, Christian Wood, and Lonzo Ball. Even if it regularizes over time, 30 games is pretty solid sample size and none of those guys have been anywhere near Jokic, Dame, Durant, Irving, Kawhi, CP3, and Luka, who are all outside the top 10. RPM just seems like a pretty bad metric."
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo. Ball
Gary Trent jr and lonzo ball are who I really want
"&gt;Pelican  Probably move Lonzo eventually. If Cade is what everything thinks, we'll have three max guys and not a lot of room for Lonzo, salary-wise. Don't think they would have an issue playing together, though; Lonzo spends much of his time playing off-ball already."
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?

Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd.

Zion good  Lonzo ball I don‚Äôt even recognize your stroke
Lonzo Ball. I will always root for him.
What the fuck possessed Lonzo Ball?
Lonzo Ball is the most improved player in the league this year.
Lonzo ball was one of my favorite UCLA players. I don‚Äôt recognize his shooting stroke anymore
The Black Lonzo Ball!
Can we count Lonzo ? Playing more off ball
You could give me every stat that says a dude like Lonzo Ball is a way better 3pt shooter than Luka and it's still no way for me
"you're definitely right that it's something that can be pointed to, and he sure can improve, but he's nowhere close to rookie Lonzo on defense. LaMelo came in looking pretty lost on rotations and outmatched a lot of the time on more physical and more athletic players. Was getting a lot of his steals by gambling in passing lanes early on.  He's improved as the season's gone along and looks like less of a defensive liability than he did 20 or 30 games ago. Growing into a legit SF sized player is the absolute best case scenario for his defense imo, lets him be mostly off the ball where he can roam passing lanes and stuff, and I don't have faith in him keeping up with the Ja's of the PG position athletically."
"Steph and Klay aren‚Äôt LeBron and LaMelo isn‚Äôt Lonzo. Steph and Klay are two of the best off ball scorers in league history. LaMelo also has the size to play SG or SF, just like Klay, so they could easily all play together. Do you really think a generational passer wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit next to the two best shooters of all time??  Wiseman can still be good, but I think it‚Äôs crazy to say that the Warriors wouldn‚Äôt have a brighter immediate future with LaMelo."
" Just to see what the results would be, I checked this websites advanced defensive metric to see what each would score and how they stack up. (For reference Gobert is top of the league with +4.32 and Anfernee Simons is bottom of the league with -2.71)  1) Lu Dort   \-1.03  2) Dillon Brooks   \+0.57  3) Gary Harris   \-0.49  4) Mikal Bridges   \+0.39  5) Royce O'Neale   \+1.11  6) Lonzo Ball   \-0.68  7) Pat Beverley   \+1.70  8) Cam Reddish   \-0.56  9) Derrick Jones Jr.   \+0.68  10) Josh Okogie   \+0.17"
Why would they need him? They already have Steph and Klay. He would barley get to touch the ball like Lonzo when LeBron went to LA
I really think melo is the best Ball brothers in skill. Lonzo is the most athletic one
Wonder what we‚Äôre gonna do about our PG problem. Obviously Cade or Suggs would be nice but hoping we get a top 2-3 pick is pointless. Lonzo Ball could be good but what do we even give up for him? Coby and ?
"Lol. People who ask questions like this for sure did not buy into Lavar and the Ball Bros' hype. whatever they did since Melo was a kid, it's showcased all on YouTube. His 92 pt game, his half court point and hit logo shot. This guy was a phenom and he was broadcasted for all to see.  Too bad people only watched Lonzo and Gelo and automatically bundle Melo in as a bust. Melo has always been special and had Kyrie's handles for his age. He had way better than Lonzo.. while 4 years younger.. while Lonzo was a Top 2 pick. That's how special he was, but nahh, 'Lonzo and Gelo are overrated, so Melo must be!'."
"Facts. I mean Jordan has the DPOY, scoring titles and MVPs, but like, Lonzo Ball has made more threes than Trae Young, sooo...."
"Melo has always been Carmelo. 'Ball' is Lamelo, since he's the better of his brothers. Lonzo can be Lonzo"
This was Lonzo Ball his rookie year and the answer is no
"Celtics didn‚Äôt that‚Äôs why they traded down. That‚Äôs the problem here, the Sixers went out of their way to get Fultz. If he fell to then at 3 because Lonzo was going to LA, then it‚Äôs a different story. The thing is Tatum is the better fit. Simmons is a great floor general and operates best with the ball in his hands. Fultz is a score first guard and also plays better on ball. Tatum is a wing who can shoot. I think Tatum was a much better fit."
"The Bulls arent well rounded enough forvthe Playoffs but too good and competitive for a deeper Lottery Look.    So, work on your weakness and the young core.  Don't touch: LaVine, Williams, Thad Young, Temple.   Bring in a Center who protects the the rim, sets screens and stretches the floor - Myles Turner for WCJ, Chandler Hutchinson and a 2nd Round Pick.  Lonzo Ball should provide pass first and more defense than you get with Coby White. Let him go off the bench as 2 Guard (with Satoransky for example as the PG) . Get Lonzo either for a 2nd rounder plus Denzel Valentine or see if he wants to come in the FA (he is a RFA)   With that you strengthen the bright side: Good tempo, good bench - but work on the efficiency and turnovers in that.  Lauri will have troubles finding his money wish in the contract offers. He's hurt so often and inconsistent. Healthy and ready, he is a cornerstone of the Franchise but more as Tony Kukoc than as Pippen to our Jordan!  Get a SF that gives you 10pts and defense. Get rid off (trade away, or let go): Felicio, Kornet, Hutchinson, WCJ, Arcidiacono, Gafford.   Get a more balanced team with better roleplayers to provide a 2nd Star enough money and Space to go join next to LaVine."
Perhaps swap coby white for lonzo ball
"Lonzo Ball is kind of underrated and overrated at the same time.   What's underrated about him is his decision-making--he doesn't gamble on defense or offense and is reliable on both ends. His IQ for the little things, like recent game against the Cavs he guessed correctly that Jarett Allen would win the jump ball so he positioned himself and his teammate to move so they would catch it. And they did.  And I think we get hype about stats around here, but sometimes the more useful guy isn't the guy who has 40% at 3, it's the guy who has 36% at 3 but *and* boxes out, *and* rebounds. And I think Lonzo is showing himself to be one of those kinds of guys."
"Maybe instead of using huge bold text to try to make your point seem better, you show where you're getting your stats from? Because I have, per Bballref, Jokic at 6th in DWS and 4th in DBPM. I don't think either of those metrics are perfect, and especially DWS is going to give him (or anyone) a certain level of defensive credit just because they contribute to winning hugely. RAPTOR puts him as a plus defender, and a better defender (this year) than guys like Tatum and Lonzo Ball. EPM says he's a plus on defense as well. He's also 4th in steals, to use a simple counting stat.   I'm not gonna argue that he's a great defender, but I really think you're making a mistake by calling him a literal 0 on defense. At the very least, statistically there's some stats that paint him positively, and some that paint him more negatively. There's clearly not OVERWHELMING evidence that he's a bad defender, especially if you watch the games.   And to address your last paragraph, Jokic is WAY ahead of Lebron in overall and offensive stats. Like, he's literally just more impactful than him this year, albeit on a worse team. Lebron is 3rd in RAPTOR WAR to Jokic's 1st, but at only a 6.0 compared to 8.4. Embiid is 2nd at 7.0. Just looking at offensive RAPTOR Jokic is far ahead of both Lebron and Embiid, with 8.7 vs  5.3 and 5.0 respectively. EPM also paints Jokic as 25+% more impactful than Lebron and Embiid as well (8.6 vs 5.8 and 6.3). Jokic is having a top 10 season of all time in WS/48.   If you want to argue against Jokic, that's fine, Embiid is a great candidate. Giannis is a great candidate. Lebron is putting up great stats but is 4-6 since AD last played on Feb 14th. But you realllllly seem like you have some kind of vendetta against Jokic."
"kyle lowry/jerami grant/lonzo ball/harrison barnes are the best players that could be traded. Barnes could net two picks maybe more depending on what is being returned. Lowry is probably the hardest guy to gauge, but a couple firsts would probably be in order. Ball probably gets trade for a young piece + picks if pelicans don't plan on re-signing him. Grant probably nets a couple picks + salary filler."

"Lakers fans were saying this. They were more attatched to lonzo ball and ""the young core"". Social media is powerful."
"Maybe Lonzo Ball? He's in the last year of an expiring contract, playing better than ever, and I wouldnt blame the Pelicans if they tank the season for a high draft pick. They seem like they want to give NAW and Kira Lewis minutes to evaluate their futures anyway"
"We know he had the potential. At least the ones that stuck with the team when they sucked bad. He showed flashes. Then his 2nd and 3rd year he played amazing after the all star break. But both were cut short due to injuries. His current play does not surprise us one bit. Josh Hart, Russell both does not surprise us too.  I'd say the biggest gamble was most probably Lonzo. Mostly due to him getting injured constantly and his shot. But we knew he was a great ball mover, unselfish as fuck and was a great defender. I'm really happy he's figured it out and is showing what he can do. The Lakers under Ryan West did well with the draft."
"Lonzo is gonna be good in NY, since it's contract year he'll keep continuing to put up great numbers and he might lead the team if he comes in since there's no one else to rely on for ball handling (and he can always be a secondary playmaker).  Plus he gets to play with Randle again, this time it's a better version of him."
He made less threes than Lonzo Ball this season
"Prince and Garland are out but, hey, Nance and Love are back on the team! Anyway, so here are the likely lineups for the night:  &amp;nbsp;  **Confirmed Lineups:**  [](/CLE)Cavaliers (14-22) | [](/NOP)Pelicans (15-22) ---|---   C.

"Lonzo ball would fit perfectly, good defense/shooting/playmaking"
"&gt;There were no rumors ahead of time.  ?  I remember a few rumors, though it's been a while.  In particular I recall the rumors that the Celtics would draft Lonzo Ball and were trying to get the Lakers to trade up (but they called the bluff and told Ainge they'd happily draft Fultz instead)."
"Earlier in the season I was campaigning for a Bledsoe/PatBev swap.  I thought it was a win-win; the Pels already have a ball handler in Lonzo. PatBev gives you a true secondary ball-handler while also providing a level of defense comparable to Bledsoe and 3-point spacing.   Bledsoe, while flawed, gives the Pels more playmaking (he averaged 6 assists a game last playoffs) and Ibaka as a stretch-5 can cover his lack of shooting."
Lonzo isn't really a half-court playmaker. He's better off-ball in the half court but yes he's crazy good in transition as a playmaker
"Here's a better D-centric squad with a little spacing for the Nets:  * PG: Derrick Rose (Bulls), Lonzo Ball (Lakers), Raymond Felton (Thunder)  * SG: DeMar Derozan (Spurs), Pat Beverly (Clippers), Tony Allen (Grizzlies),  * SF: Bruce Bowen (Spurs), Andre Roberson (Thunder), Kyle Korver (Bucks)  * PF: Dennis Rodman (Pistons), Shawn Marion (Mavericks), Nicolas Batum (Hornets)  * C: Joakim Noah (Bulls), Kevon Looney (Warriors), Larry Sanders (Bucks)  Outside of Derozan the above team is utterly lockdown on defense."

"Garty Trent Jr would require like 2 decent to good first rounders to be traded lol, I also think:   Josh Hart - late first and a second or two,   Lonzo Ball - a first rounder or two,   Collins - a decent, mabye low lottery first   Others I am not really sure, but I think seconds would be enough. Oladipo is a 1 year rental, can't see Fournier being that expensive, Mills is definetely not worth a first at this point and Markkanen is Porzingis-esque injury prone."
Lonzo and lamelo ball
"The pelicans this season have showed signs of a really good playoff team in a pretty subpar division.  Then nights like tonight I think to myself I was right Ingram can‚Äôt be on this team , he‚Äôll maybe not even lonzo. Just not going to work at this point, us pelicans fan can keep thinking this team will be something special,. Maybe I‚Äôm being to pessimistic to soon. But I like the team so much, Zion can run around with Adam‚Äôs in the paint, we have a pretty good bench minus a few sub par players probably to fill the bench up. Id rather have Lewis Jr, Bledsoe and hart rotating PG than ball at this point. Ball is a SG but I still don‚Äôt like him on this team, I don‚Äôt like Ingram on this team. For gods sake can we invest in a SMALL FORWARD worth a fuck on both ends. I can tell Ingram and ball don‚Äôt like playing for SVG or this city. Get em out, get the best trade you can. Work the draft with the prospects we have coming in, and look for a bright 2022 season.  I say this with nothing but respect to Ingram and ball, just doesn‚Äôt work on this team. Hurting Zions flow with this team tbh... we lose to the pistons x2, TWolves x2 , and a few other BAD teams, quite convincingly..    P.S Coming from a Pelicans fan hanging on the ropes, we‚Äôve squandered 2 straight HOF caliber players, year after year after year, we surround our best and future franchise players with above average ball hogs/one dimensional players/ has beens.....  I just want 50 wins and a conference finals within 4 years with zion"
Make it like when Lonzo hatched from the ball like in game of zones.
I thought you mentioned Lonzo Ball
"Decent spacing and playmaking point like say, lonzo ball?"
Lonzo + 1st for Rozier just to have the Ball Brothers together
"Bledsoe was an All Defense last year Lonzo is supposed to be a high end defensive versatile player Steven Adams is supposed to be the veteran hustle  interior presence tht always communicate and anchor the paint Ingram brings the bone, Zion brings the meat... Stan Vangundy is severely underperforming on both ends, offensively you can say it‚Äôs roster construction and weird fit but defensively he has no excuse to be this bad when his starting 5 has great on ball perimeter defense and a good paint presence... the other 2 stars just have to fill the gap if the coach can put together a scheme properly"
"Not our fault the Pels wanted to trade down for Jaxson Hayes. And Ingram/Ball/Zion are the top 3 players on that Pels team, lol. They're not the reason they're 15-21. I don't see Bledsoe or Redick playing average defense. The entire team's defensive effort, except for Lonzo, Adams, and Hart is trash.    If you want to believe that saying ""15-21"" when we gave them an all-star, a top 5 pick, and a player who is going to get near the max invalidates my argument sure. The Pels will be in a better position than your Rockets will be for the rest of the decade."
Lonzo Ball
"Enough Ball family stans tho that they shoulda made a lot more, Lonzo was 12th overall his rookie year, and I get that he was on the Lakers and all that, but Melo is one of the most popular players in the league already and hes been really hyped for a while, id rather make too much than too little. Melo woulda been top 10 easy if you could buy it, Ive been tryna get one for a while now and its still sold out. NBA just really been dropping the ball on so many things."
&gt; But his salary is too much at the moment.  How else are the Pels gonna plan on using that cap space then? By giving Lonzo Ball a $90 mil extension and paying Hart $15 mil per year? I dont really think that's a more optimal route.
"I was at the Kings game vs the Pelicans (box suite too!) waiting for my first in person look at Zion. Instead I got to see Lonzo Ball shoot practice free throws despite his teammates saying ""fuck this, we aren't getting on the court."""
Nah he‚Äôs referencing an earlier post on the sub where some canvases got in their feeling over Lonzo Ball. So it‚Äôs a nuggets fan making an inside joke dog with another nuggets fan. But it‚Äôs corny and cringe
These kids probably look at Rodman and say wow what a scrub averaged like 7 points for his career  But yea then you think dude as a defensive hound was enough help bring a team straight to the finals. Dude was pure energy on the court after a night of partying and incredible drug use. Closest thing I can see nowadays is Lonzo. Lonzo is an absolute ball hound on defense with his slimmer frame but he‚Äôs a little more balanced as a offensive player and defensive player than Rodman who would pass while doing a lay up because scoring is for suckers.
All you have to do is compare the upvotes on  ‚ÄúLonzo Ball has more 3 pointers made than trae young‚Äù  And  ‚ÄúLonzo ball has more 3 pointers made than [a whole bunch of players + trae]
"List of players shooting better OR worse than Lonzo Ball this season?  So this is the power of German engineering, OP you outdid yourself w/ this one, well done."
Is it lonzo ball?
"Lonzo is a integral piece to the Pels offense. I really hope they don't trade him. Anyone seen Ball bros high school mixtape? They all played on the same hs team,  Chino Hills, and went undefeated. Honestly, I see some champion rings in their future."
Next post after that: Lonzo Ball has made more threes this year than Ray Allen
"We‚Äôre destined to have a combo guard every year that ends up disappointing us. DSJ two years ago, Delon Wright last year, JRich this year. We need a secondary playmaker next to Luka, but none of the guys we get seem to work out.  I‚Äôm worried that we‚Äôll overpay for Lonzo Ball, who also isn‚Äôt a good enough playmaker right now in the half-court."
23 year old 24 points per game all level scorer isnt exciting to you?  Lonzo gifted passer - 23 years old  Ingram gifted all level scorer - 23 years old   Zion gifted bully ball - 20 years old  &amp;#x200B;  Definitely an exciting young trio that could have a huge impact in the league in the future
"years ago because i am soft internet boy, i made a comment about how lamelo/lonzo would both be all-nba within 10 years of the league... was -600 karma at the time lmao and i deleted it, but that snakeskin #2 ball jersey sits in my closet with my BBB shoes and i'm close to shedding a tear as between Lonzo's 33/11/8/3 tonight and Melo's underhand pass, I am vindicated dashboard confessional style"
"I think Pistol Pete is a great comp for the lamelo ball the kid is a bucket as well he's averaging like 20 as a starter Pistol Pete averaged 23 as a rookie but took a few more shots and the game was a bit faster pace as a whole. Let's not forget lamelo is the same guy that dropped 92 as a tenth grader on his brother's senior night LOL yeah he's a great playmaker but he's different from somebody like Lonzo or Jason Williams, he has an offensive bag a lot of guys don't. Right now I think he's limiting himself is a scorer to respect the older players on the Hornets. But if Melo hits a 3 from 25 the next trip down the floor he's shooting it from 32 squish or air ball lol I could see him three or four years from now flirting with averaging 30."
"they need JTA to be lethal from deep this week, or Dray to hit at least 1-2 threes both games to force Zion to work on defense  and honestly, with how much they turn the ball over, this might be a good time to use GP and let him stick to Lonzo and let Zion kick out to anyone else on the perimeter"
Before watching I came here to say I guess full court passes run in ball family but dam Lonzo don't got that sauce on his
"Pretty much the entire Ball family, including Lonzo, have said Melo is the best of the three."
"i want melo to win ROY but dlo has some kind of grievance against the ball family. i have no idea why, but dlo really doesn't come off as a bad or mean guy in general but look at everytime he's asked about either ball in interviews (i.e. about melo in that jj redick pod) his entire mood shifts lol  i guess cause magic replaced d lo with lonzo and said d lo wasn't a leader but lonzo was  kinda sad cause i actually love all 3 players a lot they're all so unique"
Glad Lonzo got the 30 point monkey off his back. Dude has had 27-29 points so many times only to fall short. Looked like it might happen tonight after he cooled off but you could see him chasing after the ball for those end of game free throws to finally get it done. Crazy how much he‚Äôs improved that he actually was looking for the ball in that spot. Couldn‚Äôt have even dreamed of him doing that during his Laker days
DO NOT PISS OFF LONZO BALL!
"I think your missing a bunch of players and you're criteria is off a bit. Its usually 3&amp;D wings that people are after - guard defence is much less important than wing defence. I definitely would not have pat connaughton, lonzo ball or fred van vleet, or ddv on this list unless you'd be happy sticking one of them on paul george for a qtr (i would not). You missed Miles Bridges who I think is useful, also Trevor Ariza. Porzingis and JJJ would also be included in your criteria, but again they are centers so i wouldnt put them in."
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
Lonzo Ball???
Plenty of outlets had Lonzo as his top comp. [This one](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2020-nba-draft-pro-comparisons-for-every-lottery-prospect-in-this-years-class/) even straight up calls Haliburton a Ball clone.
Lonzo Ball seems like a good fit
Yup so Lonzo ball for that pick and wiseman who says no
You're comparing Lonzo Ball (who turned out to be a pretty good player) and Jayson Tatum vs. Kobe and Todd Fuller though
Hindsight is 20/20 every single time. Why did the lakers take lonzo ball over jayson tatum? Nobody drafts perfectly.
He has a Lonzo Ball video actually
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball  Lavar Ball   LiAngelo Ball  LaMelo Ball  Lil‚ÄôDicky Ball
"well the height and defense were why we drafted him so high, if he could develop the ballhandling and distribution skills he could be awesome.   at least on par with like lonzo ball  but yeah it just hasn't happened and there's no reason to expect it will happen with us, maybe another team can do a better job developing him"

"imagine picking Lonzo Ball, Harrison Barnes, or Buddy Hield when anyone else is available.  this is worse than Kings picking Bagley"
"Go look at her IG, there's clips of her shooting and she keeps the ball centered at chest level and uses her whole body to put force behind it when putting up a shoot instead of hurling it from the hip like the Ball boys. She already has better form than Lonzo in college."
"Lmfao no, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt know shit about the Lakers and just hate from a distance. They literally drafted Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball in consecutive years.   They weren‚Äôt a dumpster fire because they missed out on overpaying Aldridge or Melo. They were young. They built a war chest of assets and cashed in on them to win a damn championship. If they were a dumpster fire they‚Äôd waste all their high picks like Sacramento, Minnesota, Orlando, etc. They attract stars because players know the organization treats players amazingly and will move heaven and earth to field a championship contender. Dumpster fire lmfao you sound like those morons who ‚Äúprotested‚Äù outside the Staples Center üòÇ"
"OP:  &gt;LeBron only came to the lakers because they drafted the assets needed to acquire someone like AD.  Me:  &gt;If you guys drafted such great assets, why did you have to trade so many players and throw in so many draft picks for AD? I‚Äôll tell you. Your assets sucked.   &gt;edit  &gt;Since people seem to disagree... Why did they have to package Lonzo with BI and josh hart, 4th overall pick, 2 FRPs, and a pick swap? Is it because AD is just so valuable? Let's take a look at lakers draft picks and what happened... because I think there's a pattern:  &gt;Julius Randle  &gt;-left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  &gt;D'Angelo Russell  &gt;-traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  &gt;Larry Nance Jr  &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Jordan Clarkson &gt;-traded for salary dump  &gt;Brandon Ingram  &gt;-traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Ivaca Zubac  &gt;-traded for nothing  &gt;Lonzo Ball  &gt;-disappointing 2nd overall pick  &gt;Moe Wagner  &gt;-5 games with Lakers   &gt;Svi Myhkailuk  &gt;-39 games with Lakers  &gt;Even the players they drafted who eventually became something were absolutely nothing with lakers and dropped for nothing or traded as low value assets."
Julius Randle  -left for nothing because Lakers thought he was worthless  D'Angelo Russell  -traded him + mozgov for lopez and the 27th pick  Larry Nance Jr  -traded for salary dump  Jordan Clarkson -traded for salary dump  Brandon Ingram  -traded as disappointing 2nd overall pick  Ivaca Zubac  -traded for nothing  Lonzo Ball  -disappointing 2nd overall pick  Moe Wagner  -5 games with Lakers   Svi Myhkailuk  -39 games with Lakers  Excellent drafting.

"Tier 1: Boban  Highest grossing actor and most minutes played by anyone over 7'3 in the last 5 years, so this is an obvious choice  Tier 2: Bojan, Bogdan, LeBron  Three prolific shooters with a shared 4 rings, 4 MVPs, 17 all star and 17 all NBA selections. SJ2 might propel LeBron into tier one, but we'll have to wait to see the earnings release  Tier 3: Furkan, Goran, Bertans, Draymond  Self explanatory  Tier 4: Lamelo and Lonzo (Ball)  Can't leave these two off any top list plain and simple"
"Well, it depends on what you need more of. Do you need playmaking and a super efficient 24 pts every night? Then you're probably going to want Demar. He has shown he has the ability to lead teams and be extremely clutch down the stretch, I unironically think he's a better PG now than a SG/SF his passing is that good. His AST/TO ratio is always one of the best in the league and he's miles from that kid in Toronto who used to bounce the ball off his foot in late game situations.   But he's not going to help spacing and he will take the ball out of your best players hands all while being a near negative on D.  Norm is not a great passer and tends to get tunnel vision. Which would be a problem if he wasn't so fucking effective.  Do you want a high end 3 and not so D stud that can just sparkplug into any team and make them better regardless of fit. Norms your guy. Admittedly I think he's a better starter, and I think stats prove that he could easily be a 20-5-2 guy on great efficiency at a starting SG that only takes like 12-14 shots. If you don't need a floor general or someone to take the ball out of your players hands I'd go for Norm. If you need both try and snag lonzo/norm lol  edit: also Norm fits your timeline better IMO"
&gt;*Lonzo Ball would be better since he fits the Barrett timeline a bit more.*  Isn't it about Randle's timeline now?   He's the Knicks #1.
"Hindsight is 20/20. I liked LaMelo but he had real red flags. His shooting was terrible in Australia, his shooting form was wonky, his defensive effort was really questionable, and he may have intentionally botched his draft interview because he didn't want to play in GS. Add in the Ball family drama and the fact that Lonzo was way over hyped and it's totally reasonable for the Warriors to have doubts about LaMelo.  Wiseman is a project, but almost anyone who's watched all of his games this season will tell you he's probably going to be really good in a few years."
"spending max money on over-30 guys means you are trying to contend.  And no, I did not say they should do nothing, thanks for trying to put words in my mouth, though.  Targeting someone like Lonzo Ball who fits the timeline of Barrett &amp; Randle seems like a better move than going for any of DeRozan/Powell/CP3.  Alternatively, they could continue to leverage their cap space to collect assets while developing their core and continue to build slowly, rather than doing what every single Knicks regime for the last 20 years has done which is try to rapidly accelerate the timeline at the first sign of hope."
"if the shoe fits...  If the Knicks think they're a DeRozan/Norm Powell/CP3 away from being contenders then we're heavily in the ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss"" territory.  Lonzo Ball would be better since he fits the Barrett timeline a bit more."
"Except Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball."
"Imagine stumbling ass backwards into the number one pick, drafting Zion Williamson and starting him alongside Brandon Ingram and lonzo ball and say ‚Äòwe need more talent‚Äô do you guys even listen to yourselves?"
I‚Äôd rather pay to keep Josh Hart than Lonzo Ball moving forward...
"The scouting department did great but that's it. Magic didn't do well as a GM and I'm sure he overruled the scouts when he drafted Lonzo over Tatum.  &gt; Ball, D'Angelo, BI and Randle...with Hart, Clarkson, Zubac, Nance and Bryant backing up  These players were all noobs and took years to develop into what they are now. Even Randle was just a 'beyblade' on the Knicks until this year."
Give us Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram and then we‚Äôll give u Reggie Bullock and RJ Barrett for a season and let‚Äôs see who comes out on top
"I love the revisionist history. No one in this sub considered this Knicks roster to be well constructed. Hell, I bet if I asked this sub right now if they‚Äôd rather have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo ball, Steven Adams, and Bledsoe they would say yes over rj barrett, Elfrid Payton, Reggie Bullock, and Nerlons Noel. I‚Äôm not trying to slight Zion I just think that Randle is. A better overall basketball player. I fully understand how insane Zion‚Äôs efficiency is right now and I in now way would rather have Randle over Zion"
"&gt; Teams that discussed Ball trades with the Pelicans at the deadline came away with the impression that Ball could be available again this offseason, but through a sign-and-trade arrangement, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst and Andrew Lopez. Such a deal would allow the Pelicans to recoup assets for a player who they might not view as part of their future, but doing so would come with several complicating factors.   [Source is behind paywall](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/31257895/what-does-future-hold-lonzo-ball)"
"They have no idea what they're doing on team defense.  \- They need regular practices to get things down because Zion/BI are both ball-watching, rotating wrong, and then wasting energy on long close-outs on shooters.  \- more shooting. not crazy expensive guys either but Melli/Redick/Lonzo all hit a horrible shooting slump and we were just completely without any reliable shooting majority of this season. We picked up *another* guy and he hit 0 of his open shots. (Nunnally.)   We need just a reliable guy we can ask to c+s on easy open looks.  \- Cut Bledsoe, start Nickeil Alexander-Walker. He's more than earned the start already.  \- Develop more. BI and Zion have finally had their first season playing together and while their defense is struggling, the offensive rating has been very good when our guys were healthy. We were finding our rhythm then Josh Hart/Nickeil went out.  When our backcourt is reliably hitting wide-open looks, we should be able to help Zion/BI exert less energy on generating offense and it'll help *(along with regular defensive practices*) on defense.  Zion and Ingram are very very good. We just need to get reliable/consistent help from the roleplayers around them."
"As a Lakers fan, I am like ""the evolution of Lonzo Ball, when his free throw shooting isn't the reason gor the team losing"" because he didn't shoot any hahahhaha."
"You need a C who can play C on defense (protect the rim) but plays the stretch 4 on offense. Someone like Al Horford would be great but he‚Äôs too old for a long term solution. So a Myles Tuner-like player would be a valid choice if you want to go younger. Steven Adams absolutely cannot share the floor with Zion. How they can actually trade for Myles Turner is another question, but the Pacers probably are ok trading him if they get the right players back.   Eric Bledsoe also needs to go. They need a SG who can actually space the floor and be a 3+D player. Josh Hart is nice but he‚Äôs probably best suited as a 6th man so they need someone else. They could try to get someone like Duncan Robinson and alternate him and Hart offense/defense, but they definitely need a SG who can stretch the floor.   Ingram is fine at SF. They need another alpha scorer who can create his own shot. PG is iffy. I think Lonzo will try to leave, so it‚Äôll be interesting who they replace him with. They have Kira Lewis Jr (their pick from this year), but they also probably get around the 10th pick this year. I like Davion Mitchell a lot, if he can shoot the ball. He‚Äôs already an excellent defender and his ability to change directions is elite, but if he can also be a 38% 3PT shooter (big if), I think him as a possible replacement."
"That's just it tho Lonzo barely has a chance to playmake due to how ball dominant BI and Zion are. His value depends completely on his 3 point shooting since those 2 basically demand the ball at half court now that SVG is trying to run them as point forwards. I do not see Lonzo staying in New Orleans this summer so wherever he goes, he probably will have more or a chance to playmake"
"It's a mix of things.  If the shot isn't falling, has trouble getting FTs. He really only drives in the rare fastbreak situation, and sometimes when he gets fouled there's no call because he has no reputation as a slasher. Refs are weird. It's easy to block/foul him because of that. Meanwhile, Eric Bledsoe can't finish at all lately, but he can get the whistle/get easy points that way.  He's been coming off of injuries a lot this season (knees, now hips) and when he does, it's difficult for him to get back into shooting flow. So then it's ""0-5pt"" games. And that's sometimes weeks and weeks of inconsistency. Which sucks. Our backcourt isn't contributing, and then Zion and Brandon are left on an island.  *And then you have...*  Eric Bledsoe and Lonzo Ball have similar issues with confidence/being consistent and I don't think they bring out the best in each other.  It's why I was begging them to play Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kira Lewis Jr. more in Lonzo Ball line-ups. (And to start NAW.) NAW is more reliable offensively than Bledsoe, and Kira Lewis Jr. is a very good cutter and a fast rookie who helps your point guard get more eyes off of your star players. They're offensive threats and dudes you can swing the ball to, vs. Bled. (Who is left unguarded by other teams *a lot*.)  But, the roster this year wasn't built to help *anyone*. It hurts our star players the most---which is the most important part, but it sure as hell doesn't help the dudes like Lonzo, Josh in the line-up either."
https://nypost.com/2021/04/13/lonzo-ball-may-miss-big-chance-at-knicks-showcase/
Lonzo Ball. He was good at times but also had a handful of pretty awful games especially in his rookie year.
"His team have historically struggled ... because of him? Not because of the fact that he was on a tanking/young team for years, got LeBron and battled injuries/suspensions the entire season to multiple players, and then it traded to another tanking/young team? I mean the logic is even worse when you consider it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been at this level for his entire career.   The entire ‚Äúnot a proven winner‚Äù take is just stupid. If he played with Jokic he would win too.   He is a fine number 2 option. The Pelicans have done a horrible job building their team.   This is such a bizarre argument because defense is the Pelicans issue. They are ranked 9th in offense. So to say their inability to make the playoffs is due to Ingram‚Äôs offensive woes Isnt sensical at all lmao.   And of course he has a high usage. Who do you expect to make plays? Lonzo Ball who struggles to create in the half court? Or should we just make a player like Zion who can‚Äôt shoot have historic usage? This comment thread is a mess."

"He's behind Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, Lonzo Ball"
"Perhaps, but there's only so far a team as disbalanced as the Pelicans can go. A team with an Eric ""12 PPG on 38% shooting over his last 20 games"" Bledsoe and Lonzo ""75% of shots are threes"" Ball can only go so far. Teams need point guard play."
Lol lonzo fucken Ball?
Dennis Schroeder? Lonzo Ball? Kyle Lowry? It‚Äôs not great but not terrible
"Coach Pop gonna make everyone but Zion and BI beat us, so should be interesting to see if Eric Bledsoe/Lonzo Ball can score any points tonight..."
Lonzo Ball and Reggie Jackson
Lonzo runs it pretty frequently. About 22% of his possessions are as the pnr ball handler. He's in the 85th percentile too.
"Maybe if you flip the Lonzo/Zion pairing so Zion is the ball handler  On that note, Murray / Jokic, Jokic / Murray could both be on the list"
The Ball bros have worse issues than that. I wouldn't be surprised if until the NBA the only trainers they had were Papa Ball and a series of yes men. Lonzo Ball's weightlifting videos showed that he's never had anyone teach him anything resembling good form.
"Its definitely one of the things that irks me about the ‚ÄúNba media people‚Äù (Lowe, KOC, Simmons, athletic crew, ringer crew)   Most of the people are big market people who don‚Äôt get when they clown on and talk down about your Pelicans or your hawks, or when you make jokes about Milwuakee is a barren shithole that you are legitimately helping build the narrative that makes getting free agents To these places difficult. The nba media is also really quick to downplay the difference in experience between being a fan of big markets and small Markets as if it‚Äôs not a big deal when it‚Äôs honestly a massive deal. Like you basically can only hope to be a contender if you hit super well on your draft picks and hope you can develop your talent well over a course of 5 years.  Meanwhile if you‚Äôre the Knicks or Nets you put one above .500 season together, the media talks about how you‚Äôre a ‚Äúdestination‚Äù again and the next season Lonzo Ball is there"
Lonzo ball
"In before they trade Smart, Fournier, and 3 first round picks for Lonzo Ball this offseason."
"Love talking about form. I've personally changed my form many times throughout high school, depending on which senior I wanted to emulate the most. I hate my left thumb with a passion lol  I think one reason for this trend is that basketball camps for younger kids don't have a block of time focused on form. While the old mentality was ""this is the best form, everyone do this"", the new mentality is ""do whatever you want, just perfect YOUR form"".  This might sound boomer of me, but I'm only 21. When I went to basketball camps in middle school, the first 15-20 minutes every day was dedicated to one hand shots at close range. We would focus on our follow through, high arc, and swishing every shot. BEEF was the way to go. UBC T-Birds camp btw.  The best example in my opinion is pre-NBA Lonzo Ball. No semblance of old-school proper form except maybe his feet alignment. But he kept that form from a young age and developed his own game around his shooting mechanics. That left step back that he was famous for at UCLA? 100% unstoppable because the defender had to go across his body to contest it, and by that point there's a good chance of a foul.  Even Trae Young and other chest-shooters like Lamelo Ball. Release is too low for the old school way of thinking. Right elbow isn't 90¬∞ at all. But he developed his step back and quick release to accomodate for his easier-to-block shot.  I think it's changed for the better. We get to see way more innovation in how players move on the court. Sure, there's picture perfect players like Klay Thompson, but the fact that his form is so textbook makes him stand out even more."
All you need to know is Lonzo Ball and LaMelo Ball
"In 2 years they will be dating, and the supermarket tabloids will be filled with cover stories about ""Lion,"" as they'll call them for short.  The distraction will be too much. Both will have prolonged slumps until they break up, while Ben Simmons will be widely regarded as the best player in the league after working out with Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball in the off-season and becoming a 40% three point shooter overnight."

"I'd say the best are as skilled as someone like Lonzo Ball but none have the athleticism to get a shot off, they aren't quick or strong enough. Not hating but thats really what it is."
"THT is still pretty bashful. It would be irresponsible to give him that much responsibility. Plus, are you watching this game? Shroder is AMAZING! Guaranteed offense/ effort. Less injury prone. Less Lavar Ball lmfao. If they can get rid of Dwight for the  off the court stuff. Why would we want Lonzo back? He is alright. But we don‚Äôt NEED him. We can still easily make it to the finals so far."
"I‚Äôll give you 1 Kendrick Nunn for a Lonzo Ball, take it or leave it."
I've had to watch our bench offense without him for a couple weeks now... Monk changes this team. Much more dynamic as a scorer and ball handler than Lonzo imo.
i still don't understand getting Steven Adams and Eric Bledsoe and wanting to get rid of Lonzo Ball while HAVING ZION FUCKING WILLIAMSON ON YOUR TEAM
"I‚Äôm confused by your meaning about the bull in the China shop. Because Dennis literally made a game winning drive two games ago. Dennis is amazing at starting and stopping. And fast enough to fly by defenders. He‚Äôs also near automatic from his pull up midrange shots. He can shoot the shit out of the ball if he wants to. The whole team doesn‚Äôt seem to care too much about 3‚Äôs right now. Seems coach is having them get familiar with other plays, defensive styles/ schemes and testing a bunch of players out. Everyone knows Lebron teams are usually mediocre during the season. He had rondo shooting almost 40% from 3 in the playoffs! It was amazing! He got a non shooting point guard to go off! I think Lonzo is still weak and fragile. He‚Äôs a very awkward dude to begin with."
"[https://www.espn.com/nba/player/splits/\_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball)  Also, if you look at his stats by month, after a hot February his FG% and 3P% have cooled in a major way in March and April."
"But Dennis is just as good? Both fast, good defenders / passers and shoot the shit out of the ball. I think Lonzo is too injury prone personally."
&gt;hes only pushing the propaganda of Big Ball  Lonzo to the Knicks confirmed
"When I watch lonzo ball play, the very next day Im dropping 10+ assists in a game of 11"
He's basically Lonzo Ball. What are you seeing that I'm not?
"2017, you forget Lonzo Ball"
"the NBA is all about 3 points shooting this days. neither ingram or williamson are 3 points shooters, and they hold the ball 80% of the time. they didn't give redick a chance, and lonzo is so-so from that point. in the good old days before the 3 points, they would probably would have been a fearsome team, but now they are going to be left beyond."
someone who isnt getting paid 20 mill. Also lol at his defense. Lonzo is not a consistently good defender. Hes got flashy on ball stuff but hes a mid at best offball guy
"No lmaooooooo  We just can‚Äôt close games  First of all Adams is a bad free throw shooter, he probably would‚Äôve missed that anyway   Second, the Lonzo thing was a mental mistake, his instinct was to defend the wide open layup  Zion does touch the ball late in games lmao   This is nonsense"
"frontcourt is SF, PF and Center. But yeah I kind of overlooked Ingram as he's a good shooter yeah but he also deserves to have the ball in his hands which means other guys who need to provide spacing for him and that's definitely not coming from Zion or Steven Adams lol so it's gotta be lonzo"
Exactly. Lonzo is mediocre at best in the half court. Meanwhile giving Zion the ball is one of the best plays in the NBA.  Pelicans issue isn‚Äôt scoring. It‚Äôs that they are one of the worst defensive teams in the league.
so u want lonzo to handle the ball when u have someone like ingram and zion on ur team
Lonzo Ball
"lol the Pels are not good, as amazing as Zion is the Pels are a bunch of children still. The only guy on that team capable of being a closer is BI. Their defense still sucks and the floor is still low key a mess with all the mish mashed players. You question what the hell Steven Adams is doing there and then you question what the hell Eric Bledsoe is doing there and then you remember out of nowhere that Lonzo Ball still exists and is on there and holy shit this game actually traded away JJ Redick lol"
"Lonzo Ball is a good roster player. The only All-Star is Julius Randle. Ingram is a star, but below average playing defense. LeBron couldn't win quickly enough with the group previously mentioned by the OP."
We were tied with OKC who were actively tanking at some points this season.  We almost beat the Knicks just now but Bledsoe 'forgot to foul when up by 3' and Lonzo Ball 'forgot' to guard the three-point shooter... which isn't so different as when we lost to the Blazers after blowing a huge lead and accidentally not in-bounding the ball right...  This team is beyond frustrating.
Lonzo Ball is the most realistic and I think he wants to come to a big market anyway
sign and trade for lonzo ball somehow imo
That lonzo and Rubio one makes 0 sense Rubio could actually playmake in the half court and could take some people off the dribble while Lonzo is a better defender than Rubio ever was and has his issues creating offense with the ball in the half court
Besides Lonzo you‚Äôre talking a lineup of players who need the ball to really be effective
"He would probably be coming back as a backup/situational defender/locker room guy.  But it depends on what he wants. I think he‚Äôs still got love for the guys here for sure, but he may still want to carve out a path for himself as a starter where he was before the injuries. But I could potentially see him thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already gotten paid, I‚Äôm gonna go back to the culture and locker room I love and be a role player in a winning situation.‚Äù Maybe he does, maybe he doesn‚Äôt.  I love him to death, but after his injuries I think he caps out as a role player now. But if he proves me wrong I‚Äôll be cheering for him all the same.  Re: Monte, I think he‚Äôs going to continue to be our 6th man who leads our bench unit/flexes into the steering unit/sometimes closes out games for us. Next year he probably starts while Jamal is out ofc, but long term I think that‚Äôs still the plan for him. He does offer some interesting options alongside Murray by taking Murray off ball and letting him do more that way, but we also saw our defense get entirely unlocked with Murray and Barton after the Gordon trade. We just had so much length and athleticism and switched basically everything. If there‚Äôs one knock on Monte, it‚Äôs his size. So there is a real opportunity cost to moving him to the starting lineup. But it‚Äôs absolutely something he can do and even once we are back to fill strength I would be 0% surprised if he‚Äôs closing out games for us over Barton (or whoever our long defensive 2 guard of the future is) in some scenarios.  There was also a pipe dream that the nuggets would trade for lonzo at the deadline/sign him in RFA this offseason with the idea that he can do about 80% of what Monte does as a floor general and 80% of what PJ Dozier does as a defender in one package. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic that we go for him, but it would be an interesting fit for sure."
"My two favorite players of this entire bunch are Smart and Lonzo Ball, we desperately need that kind of perimeter defense from someone who can realistically play SG next to Dame."
"Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell.  Anthony Bennett (out of the league), Victor Oladipo (derailed by injuries), Giannis Antetokounmpo (2x MVP and a DPOY), Rudy Gobert (DPOY).  Stephen Curry (still playing at an elite level) and Blake Griffin (now a role player/situational starter). And Curry's older as well."
"Is Kyle Kuzma young? If yes then he is my answer.  And then, Jordan Poole, Kevin Porter, Kevin Huerter, Lonzo Ball.  Technically not an all star but is pretty much there is SGA and Ja."
"Steven Adams, Lonzo Ball, Kira Lewis, Naji Marshall, and some picks for Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic?  Pelicans Starting 5: Dame, NAW, BI, Zion, Nurk  Blazers Starting 5: Lonzo, CJ, Cov, Naji, Aquaman"
"Overperforming his rookie year and Lonzo Ball underperforming really screwed up the perception of him. Go back on those highlight videos and there's a lot of people saying he'd be a future star. Of course he wouldn't be on Tatum's level, but with his athleticism, height, and offensive tools he showed his rookie year, he should be more than he is right now. His offense has regressed, and he's consistently making bone headed plays despite playing with Lebron for 3 years"
"Quick reminder that this team had Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, and DeAngelo Russell and kept Kuzma üíÄ"
"You‚Äôre forgetting the biggest part of that trade, Keldon. Hes what sealed the deal and made it a solid trade return.    Don‚Äôt know how much Spurs ball you watch but Jakob is a top defensive center in the league. Only Gobert had more blocks iirc   Honestly I‚Äôm not looking it as a competitive trade but a trade to help us rebuild. Demar is a great role model for the young guys, Jakob is a solid center, Luka and Keldon are both young and very high potential guys. I‚Äôll honestly take that all day vs trying to win now with Lonzo and BI as the centerpieces.    As far as Danny goes I love the dude for what he did for us, and I‚Äôm happy he gets to win. I‚Äôd feel bad about rebuilding with him."
"I'd rather have Lonzo, Kuzma and BI (and Danny Green) than DeRozan, Poeltl and Samanic. Brandon Ingram is the best player of the bunch. And imagine what Pop could get out of Lonzo Ball. Kuzma is a pigeon, but so are Poeltl and Samanic. And you would have gotten to keep Danny Green."
Well at least he has a fit with more mirrors on it than Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram own in total. That's something I guess.
Can you imagine this team with Lonzo Ball?
I wouldn‚Äôt hate Lonzo Ball. Booker and Ayton work best when there‚Äôs a facilitator.  But I‚Äôll take old man CP3 until he can‚Äôt go anymore.
"No thx , for this size of salary I prefer Lonzo Ball"
Shoot I'd do a sign and trade for Schroeder and Lonzo ball :(
I think people would get the picture when they see that the corpse of Steven Adams and Lonzo Ball of all people are the best defenders on the team
i want lonzo ball if he‚Äôs not commanding 100+
literally for what they‚Äôre going to have to pay him we could get another starter quality pass first pg who‚Äôs good on D‚Ä¶ cough cough lonzo ball
"I think they should go after Norman Powell, or Lonzo Ball. That's more realistic than Kawhi or CP3. Or even a guy like Nic Batum on a reasonable deal."
"when he was 22 or something?   playing with rookie lonzo ball?  he's still only 25  everybodys always in a hurry to write players off, I want to see him on a different team before drawing any grand conclusions about who kyle kuzma is"
Lonzo Ball music
"I most definitely wouldn't. Mv favs contracts to eat out in a KP trade are exactly Kemba and Wall, both would add up a lot in the 2nd unit, specially Kemba's ball handling. If we pair Brunson with a good ball handler coming off the bench with him, Brunson'll become a 6MOTY candidate right in his contract year.   Although my dream scenario is ship KP to NOLA for Adams and a Lonzo S&amp;T. Not likely, but still."
Knicks getting Lonzo Ball
"Yes, Lonzo Ball still sucks, but he's still more than anything the Pels will get in FA without significantly overpaying."
Lonzo Ball. Actually your take on Lonzo Ball imo is a casual fan take that looks at numbers but not watch actual games in their entirety
Knicks need Lonzo ball
Lonzo shoots the fuck out of the ball and plays decent defense. Depending on the price he's a solid role player with hella potential
"&gt;Lonzo/Hart/Ingram/LeBron/Zubac would not have won a title.  It would more probably be: Ball/James/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Hunter, Rondo, Green, Howard, McGee, Morris, Caruso, ( Bradley ) off the bench.  Yours is an extremely questionable claim.  Especially when you consider:  * they had a massive pile of assets to make other deals, like for example, picking up Jimmy Butler for peanuts, which occurred the same day as the Davis trade. * their bench would've been good enough to be a playoff team in the East * no one in the West even troubled them in the playoffs last year * James has won with less  &amp;#x200B;  Had they not traded 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap to rent Davis last year, they could've traded vastly less for Butler, and run:  Ball/Butler/James/Ingram/Zubac with most of the aforementioned bench.  No one beats that team last year."
"Imagine wanting to create a narrative so badly that you switch Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle in the Pel's deal and act as if LeBron forced Rob Pelinka to let Randle walk for nothing.   Umm did you forget that they were able to add the two leading 6th men of the year? That in itself is proof that you don't have to surround two stars with ""has-beens, journeyman, &amp; D-leaguers"" ... it was just the complete wrong pieces.   You must have been paying 0 attention to what style of roster LeBron has thrived on for the past decade if you think he would handpick a shoot-first point guard (demanding starter role) and two lane clogging bigs."
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball if the pelicans look to make a playoff push
"Agreed, for the most part.   Where I'd disagree most is even considering CP3. He's been great for Phoenix, but he's far too injury prone. That's yalls biggest problem with Kemba. I feel like that would just be shuffling the deck chairs.   Ibaka would be a good pickup but I don't see him getting them over the hump.   I think Lonzo Ball would be a good pickup if you can get him. He's clearly had enough of new Orleans. I wouldn't judge him based on his most recent stats, as it seems to me like he's quit on that team. Management has pissed everyone off down there. He's a good passer and three shooter. He's also pretty good defensively. As far as guys who could reasonably become available, him and Ibaka seem like the two best.   I like DeRozan, but he can be too inconsistent. He's also getting older.   Collins or Holmes would be good pick ups.   While I don't think Kyrie was the answer, I also don't think that Horford and IT team was built to last either. It was always fated to be short lived, IMO. IT was a defensive liability and once he got injured, he stayed injured. Horford hasn't looked the same at all since leaving Boston, which makes me wonder if he had just peaked."
LeBron having Lonzo Ball PTSD
"Lonzo Ball if we are talking about defense. He was getting called ""Jason Kidd with a jumper but not the defense"""
"&gt;James Lonzo and Butler with Ingram and Zubac is ... not a LeBron team I don't think. Neither Lonzo nor Butler shoot  Ball shot 38% from 3 last year.  Ingram shot 39%.  &gt;You'd have to put Zo on the bench and play Butler at the 2, move Ingram up a position probably and then trade for a 3  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac is just fine.  3 shooters, 3 drivers, 3 distributors, 4 at-least-good defenders.  No 2020 team even troubles them on their way to a ring, especially with the ridiculous bench they'd have had.  And they wouldn't be trading for a 3 in any circumstance, since they'd have De'andre Hunter and Kyle Kuzma coming off the bench.  Their only problem would be trying to find minutes for all the players they have."
"Trade Anthony Davis and three firsts to New Orleans for Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram."
I don‚Äôt understand why the Lakers drafted Ball over Fox. Fox was clearly a better player especially watching him cook Lonzo and UCLA in the ncaa tourney that year.
"Not really the same thing, Lonzo had funky shooting mechanics but improved, Ben just doesn't want to shoot the ball for whatever reason"
"I didnt either, he has really shocked me with how good he is. I dont know if I just got fatigued with all of the ""ball"" talk with Lonzo and Lavar or just not really watching him in college is why I was never high on him"
ja needs that lonzo ball shooting coach
Lonzo said Lebron is the GOAT. https://lakersdaily.com/lonzo-ball-says-lebron-james-biggest-mentor-lakers/
"Kawhi (will opt out to secure a bigger contract), CP3 (maybe he opts out his 1 yr 44mill to secure a 2 yr 50-60 mill), Derozan, Lowry, Conley, John Collins (RFA) , Lonzo Ball (RFA), Richaun Holmes, Jarett Allen (RFA), Norman Powell, Oladipo, Lauri Markannen (RFA), D Rose"
It‚Äôs racist because the The Decision had nothing to do with that and Bill Simmons saying that‚Äôs involved somehow is insane.   Lebron did it because he was arguably a naive kid making bad business decisions who didn‚Äôt think long term about the ramifications.   But Lonzo Ball and Kawhi are both polar opposite walking examples of why black adults having fathers is in no way a good or bad indicator of their financial and media decision making.  Using father figures is just plain racist since having or not having a dad is flat out fucking irrelevant and rooted in a racist perspective on black people.
not if he had Lonzo Ball
MEET LONZO BALL: STEPH CURRY WITH A 40‚Äù VERTICAL
"I didn‚Äôt say he isn‚Äôt an impactful player or doesn‚Äôt have any skills at all. Clearly he‚Äôs a great defender and playmaker. But being this bad at shooting, when you know it‚Äôs something that would help your team get to that next level (and win a championship) to me says he‚Äôs either not working at it or not training the right way. At this point he‚Äôs just a taller slightly better lonzo ball."
so lonzo ball?
"He wants a MAX contract which, if paid, would hamstring the team.  We have Trae coming up on an obvious MAX, then Hunter, Reddish, Okongwu etc.  Just think NOP and Lonzo Ball.  Lonzo Ball will probably walk away because NOP paid out too much.  The same with the Hawks if they pay Collins a Max."
"Exactly.   Too many people fuss over mechanics, follow through and all that.   Not saying to shoot like Lonzo Ball or Bill Cartwright at the line but shit. Shoot however Tf is comfortable."
The Lonzo Ball handshake  Drake: Pleasure to shake your hand Mr. Ball!  Will Ferrell: That'll be 10 million dollars  LOL
"Lol so you think other teams wouldn‚Äôt have offered him the max if they could?  And like others have said, he won them a title, so you‚Äôre expecting them to let a guy who was top 5 at the time to go for free? Just because he‚Äôs 28 and injury prone?? And after trading Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and 4 1sts for him???  Absolute lunacy. What a shit take dude, and it‚Äôs not even the mushroom."
"As of now, I'm 2 for 2 on the Ball brothers. When Lonzo was getting hyped as the next great point guard, I thought he was overrated and wouldn't be a star. With LaMelo, I thought he was gonna be the best player out of his draft class. We'll see how that goes."
lakers should sign lonzo ball
"I became a Pelicans fan two years ago via Duke (i.e. Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson) and I spent my first year of college at UCLA (Lonzo Ball)  I was not a Pelicans fan while he was here lol"
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
"Lonzo... if high school was the ""prime"" for the Ball Brothers since they're never going to dominate quite like that again. But yeah it probably doesn't fit the question despite how much it's improved."
"God, if only the Knicks had Lonzo Ball (please take him off our hands)"
"you biased af dawg.   BI, Lonzo, SA &gt; JV, Dillon Brooks, and JJJ  only place Ja has a better teammate is at Center. Ja so far has proven to be more conducive to winning than Zion. I‚Äôd take Ja personally over Zion because he‚Äôs a ball handler."
"Kyle Lowry. But if they can't get him, they should go after Lonzo Ball."
"Or Lonzo ""Air"" Ball."
Yessir we NEED Lonzo feeding him the ball. Tatum would be a generational talent if he had ONE fucking playmaker
Lonzo ‚ÄúAir‚Äù Ball
Lonzo Ball do be pretty decent now
"How does that contradict my statement that he is streaky? He'll shoot 50% from 3 over 2 months and 20% for the next two. Even Kerr has mentioned this numerous times when discussing Oubre's horrible start this season. Klay shot worse than Lonzo Ball for several months (&lt;32%) in 2019 after starting sub 20%, only inflated by his 14 threes game against the Bulls. His numbers in the playoffs also suggest a streaky shooter, there's a reason why no one remembers his non-game 6 games."
CJ for Al Horford or lonzo ball?
"You‚Äôre not wrong. When the Ball brothers face off, LaMelo reminds Lonzo that LaVar liked spooning him better"
Lonzo / demar with d rose. Would be great if it‚Äôs b-ball prior to 2015.   Lonzo can‚Äôt create his own shot and demar just chokes in pressure.
"Kemba is a terrible fit for the Celtics. He takes the ball away from the Jays and is undersized as a defender. Lonzo is a much better fit. Pass-first, good 3pt shooting, good defense"
Can I interest you in a Lonzo Ball?
I am starting to think this guy is better than Lonzo Ball.
"Lonzo cannot run a half court offense. He does not drive into the paint at all and settles for step back 3s, which he can‚Äôt make. His best games are when he plays off ball. There‚Äôs a reason why Zion and BI run so much point"
knicks should sign lonzo ball in the off season
Congratulations!  You are now building around a 6‚Äô11 Lonzo Ball who is afraid to shoot and is on a 170 million dollar contract.
"I was praying we got Jrue this off-season but I‚Äôm sure the asking price was way too high for Portland. Someone I would like tho is Lonzo Ball. He brings the defense, a good ball handler and has improved his 3 point shooting"
Not trying to diss on Lonzo Ball too much.... but remember when people were talking about him being the new face/future of the franchise. And we somehow went from that to Lebron+AD. What a weird late 2010s timeline that was lol. Feels like a weird dream or like it happened a decade ago.
He was good when Lonzo was getting him the ball and Walton was letting him shoot as many times as he want.  In an offense where he needs to think a lot and pick his spots he's been total trash
Like Lonzo Ball?
Not really but Knicks can get better if they improve their roster. They might try to lure Lonzo Ball or Spencer Dinwiddie for ball handling. Hell I would tell their front office to make an offer for Jarret Allen. That sort of front court presence is not readily available. They better be prepared to offer more than $100M because that's what Cavs are willing to pay just to keep him. You're right Lowry is not worth it considering his age and injury history.
"Not even remotely accurate. Grizzlies might actually be the deepest team in the league and have been consistently better than the Pelicans for the last 2 seasons. Top to bottom the Grizzlies have a substantially better roster.   Lonzo is actually solid but Ingram is overrated on both sides of the ball. Bledsoe is atrocious, Adams is probably the worst signing of the year, and their roster falls of a cliff after that. They have 3 good players and the Grizzlies have like 12 lmao."
"Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball are better thean Ja‚Äôs supporting cast"
"No he definitely does not. Ingram is a good scorer but one dimensional and doesn‚Äôt match with/complement Zion at all.   Adams might legitimately be the worst center Zion could play with considering all he can do is set screens and take space away from Zion in the pain. Same goes for Bledsoe, who has fallen off and is average at defense now which was the only thing he could do well on the Bucks. Both are overpaid average veterans who are going to ruin the Pels near future with all the cap space they are taking.   Not to mention JFG completely failed at the one thing he was hired for, defense. And if you take a closer look, no one on the team shot the 3 well aside from Ingram and Ball, and on a team with such a historically dominant slasher who already draws so much attention, it‚Äôs a crime that he didn‚Äôt have better shooters. Lonzo is a good fit and was very good this season for his standards but it‚Äôs not even clear if he‚Äôs going to stay.   The Pelicans have a great roster in 2k but it doesn‚Äôt mesh well for an actual on-court product. The Grizzlies, Mavericks, Hawks, and even the Hornets have better support for their young star."
"I remember how Pat tried to bully rookie Lonzo Ball during their first meeting. I'm all for trash talking but he just tackling and pushing for no reason. Ever since then, I've had a negative view of Pat. This makes me happy."
"They really need wing defense and shooting next to Zion, especially with Adams (or in this case Hayes) in the frontcourt. Their defense has been the big issue. They could bring back Lonzo as point guard.  Lonzo-George-Ingram-Zion-Hayes would be pretty lethal. Maybe you'd optimally like a better ball-handler, but not sure who that would be or what the better option is at the moment."
"In a sense, one of the secrets to Randle's success is that he's finally on a team that gave him a shot to lead, and he was ready for it.   All this time he was like Christian Wood. LA didn't care to develop him (they didn't want to be patient with D'Lo or Lonzo either), Pelicans thought he's not worth retaining, and no other team made him a priority in free agency because of his ball dominant post-play. Everybody wants 3/D and ""stretch big"" skills.  He ends up on the Knicks as a short term gamble (alongside another talented gamble in Bobby Portis). He finds himself on a young team willing to let him lead, with a no-nonsense old-school coach, and his 3pt shooting also took a huge turn around at the perfect time.  He's the perfect MIP, both due to circumstance and skill."
Only person it‚Äôs ever worked on was first day Lonzo Ball.
"Honestly, Lebron needs several weeks of straight rest and therapy to get back to what he was. Lonzo Ball missed 4+ months due to a high ankle sprain a couple of years ago. Lebron is no different, it's just the playoffs. Most players that get this kind of injury miss a considerable amount of time, and Lebron has as well, but he's still moving relatively well. No where near as explosive, but he's okay for where he is. Honestly, his pain threshold is insanely high because I'm certain it's not comfortable, but his mindset is I don't have the luxury of not playing. The games matter now.. so he's playing. But if this was the regular season still, we wouldn't see him playing right now."
And this year's not playing for Luke Walton award goes to... Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson!  Lonzo Ball is winning MIP next year confirmed.
Lonzo Ball LOL
Caruso and THT seem to be developing pretty good. I wouldn't say the development is bad just being in LA puts too high expectations on them. When we had Ingram and Clarkson and all those young guys playing together people expected them to play like an all star even in their rookie year.  If Russel and Lonzo Ball were still on the Lakers and haven't become all stars yet or won anything there would be so much discussion about how they're flops and so much trash talk throw their way. Elsewhere they are able to develop at their own pace and not be put under a microscope all the time.
"I know the Lakers faithful are proud of their old young'un. I mean they traded them for LBJ and AD....no animosity at all.  Clackson, Nance Jr, Lonzo, Randle, D'Angelo....that's a pretty decent small ball 5 right now."
"No because the Lakers are an incompetent organization that can't develop jack shit. Literally the second D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle left they became all-stars. Jordan Clarkson became the 6th man of the year, Lonzo Ball became a good point gaurd and even guys like Ivica Zubac are thriving."
"He's much more than that.  He has really good bball IQ so he understands the next move within an offense.  So, much like how Draymond Green will catch the ball after Curry is trapped or doubled and know what needs to happen against the 4v3, Lonzo will also know the next pass or move after an advantage is created and make the correct series of decisions.  But, to be clear, this is different from being a play-making guard since he's still relying on someone else to generate an advantage.  Klay isn't that type of player."
At least they got playoffs. You got two all-star calibre players and a good starter in Lonzo ball and couldn't even make the play-ins.
"There‚Äôs a lot of nuance involved at that level. If you‚Äôre a play-off team chasing a championship then it makes sense to trade the late first round pick for a player who can instantly contribute. The Nets traded the pick for Shamet because they knew he could stick in the league and was on his rookie contract. If the Nets win this year they should keep this years first because you need to add players who can earn playing time but are on a rookie deal so you go with a guy who only needs to contribute in a limited way like be a 3&amp;D player. Or you draft a player and develop him on your G-League team and sign ring chasing vets to fill out the roster.  The Warriors would probably like a do-over on the Wiseman pick. They like him a lot as a person, high character type of person with huge potential and the type of bridge player who can link the current GSW dynasty to the next dynasty. Maybe he will be that player but big men take longer to develop.  The pandemic screwed the Warriors at the last draft but they still made their decision. Anthony Edwards has definitely surpassed expectations this season but would he have excelled as much with Step and Wiggins next to him and with Klay coming back? I imagine Lavarr Ball put the Warriors off wanting to be associated with that family and Lonzo really only improved this season. But LaMelo or Ant Edwards would look great right now on the Warriors.  The Warriors should have also tried to send the number 2 pick and the upcoming Minnesota pick to a rebuilding team for a guy who could play for them this season."
Traded down and got Tatum + a lotto pick while y'all sucked on ur thumbs and told the whole world u were taking lonzo ball lmao !
That ain‚Äôt lonzo ball boyyyy
"i still remember when he was guarding Lonzo Ball in Lonzo's first game and he was just being weird and overly aggressive and kept fouling him but the refs were like ""oh haha thats just pat bev he's so crazy"". made no sense"
"Sexton‚Äôs absolutely been improving as a playmaker. Over the regular season, he averaged as many potential assists per game (9.2) as Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic. Over the last fifteen games, he averaged the same number (11.5) as Ricky Rubio and Malcolm Brogdon did this season."
In the commercial with Lonzo and Lamar Ball does the car they are in explode? Or do I just not understand the commercial lol
"Yeah, should have kept Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart, and traded Lebron James for AD smh"
"Yeh..  let's blame the COACH Doc Rivers again and scapegoat him.. because the superstar Point Guard of the team played like Lonzo Ball in a MUST WIN game, and Embiid (who has more shit post tweets than games played in his career) wasn't that good either when it mattered the most.    But then, he just threw his point guard under the bus Post Game.. Quite publicly.   GREAT LEADERSHIP.  GREAT LOCKER ROOM PRESENCE  &gt;  But hey, let's all blame DOC RIVERS and all other coaches instead. Why not..  &gt;   And of course this shit ignorant post would be in the Front Page of r/nba lol   Fuckin IDIOTS  &gt;   **EDIT**:  And Giannis definitely DIDN'T choke and get horribly LOCKED DOWN by Kawhi and Siakam in 2019 ECF,   Jimmy Butler in 2020 FIRST ROUND, and this season vs Trae Young and the Hawks in another ECF.   Definitely not   &gt;  And the funniest thing is, Giannis looked completely different in all of those Regular seasons.  They gave him the MVPs too.  No one blamed the 'coach' then.  Actually gave him awards as well, and all the praise    But in the playoffs, Giannis just shrinks.. like most other *regular season superstars*   Still, let's blame the coach instead then.  Big brain"
"Yeh boy..  let's blame the COACH Doc Rivers again and scapegoat him.. because the superstar Point Guard of the team played like Lonzo Ball in a MUST WIN game, and Embiid (who has more shit post tweets than games played in his career) wasn't that good either when it mattered the most.

I mean the Lakers do at least according to this:  &gt;The Lakers updated media that Ball had been taken to an area hospital for X-rays due to an issue with the machine at the arena.  from here: https://www.nba.com/news/lonzo-ball-injures-ankle-x-rays-negative
"That‚Äôs interesting. So its 2 yr deal with LAC vs above the cap (non taxpayer) teams who can offer the full MLEx3yr and under the cap teams.  Alex Caruso is 27 with 4 year of NBA miles, RJ is 31 with 10 years. I see Caruso getting looks at the MLE range, maybe even an offer for $1-2 mill above MLE but looking below, it becomes unlikely and he instead see offers from other teams operating above the cap for full MLE.  To get a contract above MLE for RJ, half the league is able to do it: NYK, SAS, OKC, MIA, CHA, DAL, MEM, TOR, NWO, CLE, HOU, ATL, CHI, SAC, ORL, DET.  Looking at those teams, does RJ get a $12-15 mill offer from DET, ORL, SAC, CHI, ATL, HOU, CLE, NWO, TOR, CHA, OKC that would pry him from LA...I don‚Äôt think any of these teams make a real play for RJ as they already have their own guards and may not want to throw $50-60 mill for someone to be their 3rd guard in most cases. CHI could offer their entire cap space ($13-15) for him to be their 3rd guard if they want to compound it to show Zach they want to win ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I think they have other targets.  Realistically, the only teams that chase are NYK, MIA, DAL...could include SAS MEM but they both have young guards and SAS cap space could get eaten by resigning free agents (Mills, Gay, DeRozan). RJ also has to contend with other PG Free agents:  Spencer Dinwiddie 28 Lonzo Ball 23 Derrick Rose 32 Patty Mills 32 Kyle Lowry 35 (Other PG unlikely to switch teams - cp3 and conley).  For the above the cap (but below tax payer bracket) teams: PHI, PHX (CP3 opts out and inks a $90 mill 3 yr deal), BOS, DEN, WSH, LAL, and IND...I only see PHI or IND making a play for him at full MLE to fill a big need.  Based on this, I think there is a good chance RJ sticks with LAC for that $10 mill/yr (for 2 years) that they can offer him. Unless PHI or IND enter the picture. Like Marks said, it‚Äôll be an interesting free agency!"
You also have Lonzo Ball coming up on free agency.   That's a deadly back court.
"You can‚Äôt assume they develop the same way on that team. Lonzo and Ingram made much larger strides shooting the ball in NOLA than they ever did in LA. Randle wouldn‚Äôt get to handle the ball like he did in NY this year with Bron, Ingram, Lonzo, AD, etc."
IMO the happy medium is getting a guy like Lonzo Ball to play in the backcourt with him.
Averaging 5 with that Pelicans roster? How would you define good in that situation? would he need to drop 20 assists to Bledsoe and Adams for you to consider him even a decent playmaker?  Edit; that‚Äôs also behind point Zion and Lonzo. He could easily put up 7-8 assists as the primary ball handler
"Westbrook has a worse TS% than Lonzo Ball so I‚Äôd be a bit hesitant to say he‚Äôs a better offensive player at this point in his career. Also, the Wizards are a horrid defensive team and the roster after Beal and Westbrook is infinitely worse than the roster I came up with. I don‚Äôt know how you can‚Äôt see that. Wizards would have the best player between the teams but that would be true against your roster as well so I don‚Äôt know why you keep bringing it up.   With the guys I mentioned, I could run a 2 guard, 2 forward 1 big lineup or I could do 3 forwards, 1 guard and 1 big. Also, my roster has better shooters if I sub out Murray with KCP or Schroeder.   There‚Äôs lot of versatility and it‚Äôs undoubtedly enough to beat the Wizards"
"Lonzo ball. Lonzo,AD and Lebron would be deadly, trust me"
Ingram can easily be a number 1 on a playoff team. I‚Äôll make one like you did.  PG: Malcolm Bronson  SG: Lonzo Ball  SF: Brandon Ingram  PF: Bobby Portis  C: Myles Turner
"Seems like a good fit. Lonzo likes to play with pace and shoot a lot of 3‚Äôs. Thats MDA‚Äôs MO. They‚Äôd need a secondary ball handler, but NAW seems like he might fit that bill.   With Zion creating tons of space and running the floor like a freight train too. He and Ingram might not be a good fit, but they should probably just do what‚Äôs best for Zion."
The Cavs put a large role on Sexton that is pretty hard to Fill. He is our only consistent offensive option that we have. He in general plays more games than our other starters and handles playmaking duties often due to line up changes injuries.   We would need to replace a player who playmakes puts up 24/4/4 on 48/38/85 and was leading the league in Clutch with Dame (until the Cavs big tank).   If we draft one of the Jaylen to replace then instead of trading to replace we would be likely trading for an off ball SF/ PF otherwise we draft Mobley and look for a star guard to be a veteran leader/ provide defense. My ideal trade would be Lonzo ball to provide defense and some shooting to the back court
"Agreed. As a raptors fan, we got Jonas valanciunas to shoot threes by giving the green light when he‚Äôs wide open and fully balanced. He went from 0.0 3pa to 1.0 3pa and it allowed him to develop a pump fake that probably got him one or two free buckets and helped spacing for his teammates. There is no reason why Simmons can‚Äôt follow the same protocol to at least build confidence. He only needs to hit a few and not at a good clip either for people to have to play closer to him and it would help spacing and improve the team as a whole. Obviously there is a lot more nuance to that but if JV could, there is no excuse for ben. (Also I know JV is a good ft shooter which helps 3‚Äôs but lonzo ball could hit threes early in his career without being a good ft shooter so I don‚Äôt see why Ben can‚Äôt. We are literally asking for low 30% from 3)"
Definitely not in transition but Lonzo hasn‚Äôt been an effective passer/initiator in the half court whatsoever. He doesn‚Äôt have strong ball handling and isn‚Äôt a threat to score off the dribble.
Hot Take Discussion: Whose father was worse for their son's career(s)? Lonzo Ball or Ben Simmons?
Not sure how much cap space the Celtics have but if they can get a lonzo ball that would help them a ton. I think they also have a trade they can make so trade Thompson and Langford for a backup wing guy who can shoot. I don‚Äôt think the Celtics are far from contention
Lonzo Ball lol
"Better actor, Lonzo Ball or Emma Watson?"
I'd rank Lonzo Ball over Simmons at this point.
Lonzo Ball and some bench players for (fill in the blank superstar).   Poor Lonzo is the modern day ‚ÄúTheo Ratliff‚Äôs expiring contract‚Äù
I wanted lonzo ball but I wanted to trade CJ for him D:  Cant get everything we wish for though lol
"Perfect and most realistic IMO: sign one of Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, or Devotne Graham on a medium sized deal. Have a decent prospect fall to us in round 2 pick 38, someone who can immediately contribute. Sign and trade markkanen to get something for him. Keep Theis, Temple, Green. Waive Arcidiacano, sign a forward and a 3 and D wing. Furkan Korkmaz or Tony snell. Also should be interested in Bryn Forbes"
"Pelicans only because they cant get worse than what they are rn. They have a bunch of picks, young star(Brandon Ingram) other young players(S&amp;T Lonzo Ball, Jaxson Hayes, Nickeil Alexander-Walker) to trade for Dame. Dame + Zion a better duo than Ingram-Zion."
"The Harden trade was a terrible return though. Presti got Shai plus a ton of assets for PG-13. The Pelicans got Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick, plus two more first round picks. The Rockets really didn't get young talent and most of the picks will probably suck (3 1st from the Nets and one 1st from the Bucks that conveys next year). You may never get equal value because it depends on drafting a superstar but you don't have to lose as bad as the Rockets lost."
What if a team had‚Ä¶ say‚Ä¶ 7 tradable FRPs and 11 second rounders‚Ä¶ and maybe a lonzo ball type player. And an all defense team player‚Ä¶.
"&gt;it‚Äôs an issue if your elbow is FLARING out, AS you shoot.  Lonzo Ball and Kevin Martin"
"Cavs fans, would Sexton be good next to a ball dominant SG like Luka? What about next to Lonzo?"
I don‚Äôt hate the idea of Lonzo but I also really don‚Äôt buy into it for the Bulls either. He‚Äôs a good player but he doesn‚Äôt really handle the ball a whole lot and orchestrate offense in the halfcourt like we sorely need somebody to do. I‚Äôd be much more comfortable paying Lowry.
"During LeBron's first year as a Laker, I remember someone on Lakers Twitter suggesting that Luke should take the ball out of LeBron's hands and let Lonzo run the offense because LeBron is too selfish and doesn't play team basketball. Lonzo will never live up to his massive potential if LeBron keeps hindering his development. Needless to say, it took a lot of Laker fans a little while to warm up to LeBron."
if we had a pg and not the ghost of rose carrying we could of had a competitive 1st round. Lfrid just flat out sucks glad to be rid of him  I know our options are him shroeder i think and lonzo ball I'm more into lonzo since he fits the timeline better plus rj will get better at the midrange this summer im certain of it so more space with his improved 3point shooting this year will allow more space for randle to operate and not get tripled in the post every possession.
"I kinda thought lonzo ball would be a nice choice but that seems really hard to get. Lowry on a cheap deal would be cool, but we aint winning any championships in the near future lol"
All three of them are known for playing wreck less defense. Bev picked on Lonzo in his first NBA game. Jones tripped Kobe and injured him when Kobe went up for a shot and landed on Jones' foot. Hill injured Bron on a loose ball.
"Your arm and elbow are supposed to be square under the ball, Ben Simmons elbow sticks on his shots. This is stuff you learn at camps but not everyone is anatomically able to do it because of bad wrist or bad elbows, a shocking amount of players don‚Äôt have great form. That‚Äôs fine if shots go, you can will a basketball in the hoop with a shitty form. The super elite shooters are all shooting basically the same shot.  Good way to practice to getting good form is shooting with one hand. The off hand is really just supposed to stabilize the shot, if you‚Äôre guiding the ball with two hands your shot is probably messed up. A lot of players end up with shitty form because they have success before they‚Äôre strong enough to consistently shoot a sound shot and they just won‚Äôt change. Like a guy like lonzo ball.   The prettiest, most technically sound forms I‚Äôve ever seen are ray Allen and mike Miller. Simmons is up there with the worst. It genuinely might not be something he‚Äôs in control of IMO."
"Except KD listens, he has thin skin but he listens and plays ball. I've seen Simmons just give up or avoid shots, it doesn't matter why, it's unacceptable. I value Lonzo Ball higher, at least he fixed his issues, got rattled but didn't lose confidence, and LISTENED to people about changing form. Now he's nearly a 48/38/80 split shooter on similar scoring/rebounding/assisting/stocks as Simmons and most of all has CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED in almost every metric, while Simmons has regressed in most categories. Not listening to anyone but family and yesmen around him can't help.     I'd rather have Lonzo back than Simmons if it were an option."
Just like the father of lonzo ball. Please.
"Lonzo Ball was ""Jason Kidd with a jumper but without the defense"". Its funny because his first year he was the complete opposite."
"Bro difference is Lonzo was always a shooter, he was used to putting the ball in the basket beyond 5ft, how are we comparing the two"
Works better Lonzo Ball.
Lonzo ball without a 40 inch vertical
"I know, right lmao SAS says some stupid, outlandish shit, mostly for entertainment purposes, but when he talks the game, he obviously knows what he's talking about. You don't cover the sport for 20+ years, grow up playing it, and not have a good sense of it. Claims like this, all made out of hype, don't invalidate his basketball acumen. I mean, is LeBron ""fucking clueless"" because he hyped up players like Lonzo Ball??"
How about for one shiny Lonzo Ball!
Lord please free my Pelicans from the roller coaster (it's mostly down) that is Lonzo Ball  üôè
"Lonzo Ball would be a really good fit, and he‚Äôs be a good defensive presence at the point."
"Honestly, Lonzo Ball would be an amazing fit on the Celtics. A willing passer, good shooter, and an excellent defender. They don‚Äôt need a scoring point guard, they need a game manager-type point guard."
"Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt hate Lonzo Ball rather than the 10th pick. Size, defense, and playmaking in the backcourt is exactly what we need."
"&gt; Hell, his brother got a bunch of D-1 offers as a freshman in order to reel in Marvin and ironically, Marcus might end up bette  This is basically the Ball family too.  UCLA promised all 3 of them a ride to get Lonzo.  They knew LiAngelo wasn't worth a scholarship and who could have known about LaMelo (he was like 13 then), but to them Lonzo was worth it.  Now LaMelo's clearly the better brother and funny enough he didn't even end up at UCLA!"
"McCollum isn't a playmaker....agreed that they need a playmaker, thats why the next obvious hole to fill is finding a point guard. No idea how to make the logistics work, but Lonzo Ball is the guy I personally think would be a great fit"
This is nothing new. As a Raps fan we've witnessed it 1st hand for years.  They've constantly slept on the Raptors during our contender days for years. And then acted all shocked and annoyed when we made the 2019 Finals. Had they done their job properly throughout the regular season they would've seen it coming. At the very least cover the 2019 Raps defense or depth. But naaaaah! The Lakers and Lonzo Ball needed to be priority.
"Trade Ben Simmons to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball &amp;Brandon Ingram, &amp; let Zion and Ben Simmons work together."
"&gt;pass-first defensive PG  I Think a clear distinction has to be made between a gifted playmaker and gifted passer. Simmons is a passer, he can run a fast break, pick out good passes in the transition, make fancy assists etc but he‚Äôs not an elite Playmaker than runs an offense. He‚Äôs like Lonzo, great passers, mediocre playmakers. His so called passing game is relegated to drive and dish passes in a half court set.  Guys like CP3, Lebron, Luka and even Trae are able to break down a halfcourt defence to generate OPEN shots for their teammates. Guys like Simmons and Lonzo can‚Äôt.  Embiid never gets the ball in good enough spots where he doesn‚Äôt have to do much work to score. He sets multiple screens, multiple dribbles, backing down 7fters and that‚Äôs why his game drops from half to half when he gets gassed. Bron or CP would generate like 4-5 open dunks for Embiid every game. Easy points."
"@ Toronto fans excited to assumedly be getting Suggs‚Ä¶. Ima let y‚Äôall finish but Davian Mitchell will be a better pro. Book it  Suggs is *safe*.  Mitchell is **dynamic**. I see raw Russell Westbrook coming out of UCLA, Colin Sexton but with passing ability and defense, and yes donovan Mitchell.   With Suggs I see‚Ä¶Lonzo Ball. I see Chauncey billups. Not bad of course, but a lot had to go right for billups to get where he got. You don‚Äôt really project a player to be Chauncey billups Bc it‚Äôs more mental and you can‚Äôt really duplicate that. You can duplicate athletic profile and skill set tho. Mitchell is that guy   The biggest red flag for Suggs is: he has no mid range game. Stars have mid range games. Pull ups, hesi‚Äôs, shot making, etc. Suggs has a cap to his game that no one is talking about."
This is exactly how Fultz and Lonzo Ball got drafted above Tatum.
"Probably #1 and no way he slips past #2 as he would be better than at least 17/20 (Ja and LMA are toss-ups imo) out of the last 20 years of #2 picks  2020 James Wiseman, Memphis - Golden State Warriors  **2019 Ja Morant, Murray State ‚Äì Memphis Grizzlies**  2018 Marvin Bagley, Duke ‚Äì Sacramento Kings  2017 Lonzo Ball, UCLA ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2016 Brandon Ingram, Duke ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2015 D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Ohio State ‚Äì Los Angeles Lakers  2014 Jabari Parker, Duke ‚Äì Milwaukee Bucks  2013 Victor Oladipo, Indiana ‚Äì Orlando Magic  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Kentucky ‚Äì Charlotte Bobcats  2011 Derrick Williams, Arizona ‚Äì Minnesota Timberwolves  2010 Evan Turner, Ohio State ‚Äì Philadelphia 76ers  2009 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut ‚Äì Memphis Grizzlies  2008 Michael Beasley, Kansas State ‚Äì Miami HEAT  **2007 Kevin Durant, Texas ‚Äì Seattle Supersonics**  **2006 LaMarcus Aldridge, Texas ‚Äì Chicago Bulls (Draft rights traded to Portland Trail Blazers)**  2005 Marvin Williams, North Carolina ‚Äì Atlanta Hawks  2004 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut ‚Äì Charlotte Bobcats  2003 Darko Milicic, Serbia &amp; Montenegro ‚Äì Detroit Pistons  2002 Jay Williams, Duke ‚Äì Chicago Bulls  2001 Tyson Chandler, Dominguez HS (Calif.) ‚Äì L.A.

"My bad, I misread.   I‚Äôd disagree with that as well. We‚Äôre seeing it right now with Luka in Dallas. Book didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs until this season, when CP3 got there. Ja just got a first round exit. Zion, BI, and Lonzo haven‚Äôt even been in the playoffs. Wiggins never got out the first round. Lavine as well.   A Bron draft pick is the only type of draft pick I can see carrying a team to the second round, and that‚Äôs super rare.   If the team isn‚Äôt good, then that draft pick would have to ball out in the regular season to avoid playing a high seed in the first round.   If the team is good (Tatum going to BOS, Trae to ATL, Mitch in Utah, etc), then the draft pick helped but I wouldn‚Äôt say that draft pick carried them. In a place like Detroit, it takes the front office to get them there, they have to put together a solid team."
This has mega recency bias.  Don‚Äôt see how AD is overrated he just won a championship.  Overrated: Lonzo ball  Underrated: Byron Scott
"I thought Lonzo was at least a decent playmaker in college.  In the NBA, he angered me to no end with his dribble past half court and give the ball up immediately shenanigans. I was rooting for him üò£"
"It brings up a couple of good points:  a) Is transition passing overvalued coming out of college ?  Lonzo was lauded as the next coming of Magic - he ws great at transition passing, but was relatively unproven running a pick and roll in a half court set defense. He suffered at the next level in being the half court point guard (also due to his inability to shoot/finish/be a scoring threat in the half court)  b) Shot creation vs assist.   There's not been very good metrics or value for shot creation. Teams can create shots based on play action, what the defense gives them; or great players can create shots either solo or out of team play, which may or may not result in a basket. Failed assists and hockey assists are relevant. The flip is assists that don't really leverage anything valuable done by the passer - the rondo assist/wilt assist. Hold the ball, wait for your guys to get free or to make some moves."

"Yeah, he could have picked Simmons and Fultz with 2 top 3 picks. Or Jhalil Okafor. Or Marvin Bagley. Or Brandon Ingram. Or Lonzo Ball  Just because you have a top 3 pick doesnt mean youre guaranteed an All-Star. And Ainge absolutely deserves all the credit in the world for getting a franchise defining superstar and at worst an all-star level complentary wing player with those picks."
Tyrese is what everyone though Lonzo Ball would be
I think you meant to say Lonzo Ball. Not Simmons
"Lonzo Ball isn‚Äôt one of the most famous and successful athletes in the world. Lamelo was also much, much better at that age. Bronny is not very impressive considering how much attention he gets and how much bron stans stay with him firmly lodged deep in their throats."
I mean Lonzo Ball said he had a great shot coming out of UCLA as well. Everyone is gonna say that about their own shot üòÇ
"Keep in mind Curry had Klay and Draymond, while KD had guys like Westbrook, Ibaka, 6MOTY Harden, and some other good role players before joining the Warriors. Zion is doing this with Eric Bricksoe, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and Steven Adams as his best 4 players."
"Jokes aside, Lonzo has turned his career around. He has changed his jumper and become a  good 3 point shooter. He has accepted his new role as a 3 and D player rather than the primary ball handler. Ben Simmons hasnt done any of that."
"He won‚Äôt change. Millions of dollars are on the line.  He‚Äôs had 4 years to fix his shooting.  His shooting percentages drop lower every year.  During that time Lonzo Ball manage to improve his shot slowly.  I think Simmons is physically better than Lonzo.  People are more aware of Simmons dating profile than they are of his shooting development.  Complete 180 in one summer is too much to ask, but a kid not showing any improvements  in 4 years is either broken or just lazy.  It is a sunken cost fallacy at this point.  Better to focus your resources on another player."
It is interesting that Givony and most scouts blasted Ben Simmons‚Äô defense and that‚Äôs his best NBA quality. seems like it‚Äôs just really hard to gauge defense with prospects. People thought Lonzo Ball would be a defensive liability too after the De‚ÄôAaron Fox game.
"He also did not give one solitary fuck about shooting free throws after that underhand season. Like literally would stand wherever in the semicircle, not even on the line. Never did the same thing twice. Actively stated in the press he didn't like free throws. Shooters like Lonzo Ball dramatically improved via practice. The biomechanics of shooting are pretty well covered, is why almost everyone has 'the same' shot now even compared to thirty years ago."
"I think there's more gaps to his game than that.  His handle while good for someone 6'10"" is not actually PG level elite and he lacks the shiftiness and first step that other guards have on attack which might get mitigated a bit with a better shot not but not solved altogether.    From the way your describe him you make it sound like he's 6'10"" Rajan Rondo in the half court but I feel he's much closer to being Lonzo ball than an elite level half court playmaker."
"I actually think the Pelicans would be interesting, they could potentially find a way to do a sign &amp; trade to send Lonzo to the 76ers to make the money work. They‚Äôre already experimenting with point-Zion, so moving Simmons into a Draymond-esque role would be really interesting. He‚Äôs an excellent defender and passer, perfect compliments alongside Zion. Ingram can spread the floor, and a pick-n-roll between Simmons &amp; Zion would be very strong given that they can both be the ball handler or the roll man. And Simmons fits the age-range of this team and they can grow together. Is it an absolutely perfect fit? No. But no team really is. But Simmons is a nice compliment to Zion and if they can put 3 shooters around them at all times I think it could work."
I spotted Simmons the fraud from day 1 cuz I‚Äôm not a fanboy. Same with Lonzo Scrub errrrrr Ball
"It depends, if I‚Äôm correct lonzo ball had the biggest rookie contract in history at the time n he wasn‚Äôt a number 1 pick‚Ä¶ but landed in a bigger market n had bigger personal brand in BBB so he had more leverage when negotiating"
Is not a mistake for us to believe he doesn't care because he has been in the league longer than lonzo ball and has yet to learn how to shoot while Lonzo has changed his shooting stroke 2-3 times AND improved his shooting %.
I mean at this point his value might be a sign and trade for Lonzo Ball.
"Most players do. It‚Äôs just how it is recently. A while back you wouldnt get an assist if the receiver dribbles once or twice or something like that. It‚Äôs definitely not simmons exclusive but the post does show how he doesnt really ‚Äúplay make‚Äù often, just moves the ball well. He and Lonzo would be great for motion offense."
"hot take but simmons is not statistically bad, his deeper advanced numbers show that. does he get inflated assist numbers....yes. so does everyone these days. but we have been shown that what works in the reg season does not work in the playoffs where it counts. also the data set is much smaller in the playoffs for some of these guys.   all in all, i think ben can work on some teams and right now he might be a pretty good bargain. i actually don't think cj mccollum is worth ben simmons or even lonzo ball...if we were trading in a vacuum. But as the teams stand both those players seem more worthwhile than ben for the 76'ers"
"&gt; Lonzo Ball would have the same issues as Ben at some point.  Lonzo can shoot okay now. He shot 37.8% from 3 on 8 attempts a game this season. He‚Äôs not a sniper, but he‚Äôs not an embarrassment anymore."
"""FUCKING LONZO BALL STATUE WHY DO YOU TEMPT ME SO?"""
"I think you need someone that's a threat or you just load up on Embiid. A pick n roll with Ben and Embiid is a lot less dangerous than with Kyrie and Embiid because Kyrie would be a huge scoring threat   Lonzo Ball would have the same issues as Ben at some point. You need a bucket and no one is going to trust Lonzo to go get that bucket, and if the end of the game comes down to the pick n roll you guard the one guy that can consistently kill you"
Lonzo Ball for Simmons.. Sign and trade. They take Eric Bledsoe and first round draft pic so he is off our books
Honestly can they get lonzo ball I feel like he would be a good defender and he can shoot well and is a good distributor
"That last one is absolutely hilarious.  &gt;These Four NBA Players Want You to Know They Can Shoot Now  Daaamn, talk yo shit, who is it btw?  &gt;Lonzo Ball, Ben Simmons, Hassan Whiteside, and Andre Drummond  https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwnjl-I4PBErItFL5c-C7-g_lAMk4fjfyzi48k3o=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"
Oh thank god he's finally committing himself to  [Improving](https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-ben-simmons-jump-shot-update-vocal-leadership-defense-media-day/)  [His](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29074004/ben-simmons-hears-talk-process-not-public-experiment)  [Shot](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/8/30/17800912/lonzo-ball-ben-simmons-hassan-whiteside-shooting)
"I like Hayes too, he‚Äôs already a good defender and good passer, he has some touch at floater and some pull up jumper. But his finishing around the rim is sus and he just doesn‚Äôt have a high scoring upside to go top 5 like what KOC projected him to be.  He‚Äôs more or less along the line of complimentary PG like Rubio and Lonzo Ball in my opinion,"
Lonzo Ball circa 2018
So lonzo ball with that doesnt shoot?
you know how simmons is getting shit on right now?  lonzo ball shares *many* of the issues ben simmons has. the only difference is lonzo can and is willing to shoot 3s.  he's still fucking awful with the ball in his hands.
Can I interest you in a barely used Lonzo ball. No Simmons in exchange tho
"I just don‚Äôt think Lonzo and hart are that good, Simmons obviously was garbage this series but we‚Äôre still talking about an All-Defense 1st teamer who even in an awful game for the 76ers offense overall had 13 assists. Ball is getting better offensively but he still settles too much and hart is meh to me"
ohhh nooo Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart dont wanna stick around whatever will we doooo
"FWIW some of it is totally self inflicted. Trading Kawhi to Toronto just to spite the Lakers really bit y'all in the ass, Spurs could be sitting on a lineup of:   C: Center signed in FA  PF: DƒÅvis BertƒÅns / Rudy Gay  SF: Brandon Ingram / Keldon Johnson  SG: Lonzo Ball / Derrick White  PG: Dejounte Murray   but some of it is out of y'alls control. Letting BertƒÅns walk to sign Morris and then Morris bails last minute wasn't y'alls fault."
Lonzo Ball or Ben Simmons?
Oh boy I‚Äôm going to have to look at this. I love Ball and I have been the last guy left on the believe in Simmons bandwagon. How things change in the nba  Edit you definitely deserve to bump that thread. One simple factor..the hate for Lavar Ball makes people give Lonzo and Lamelo less props and more criticism than they deserve
please god no.  below average starting point guards for the lakers have basically plagued the entirety of the 30 years i've been a lakers fan.  drafting lonzo ball to end up with ben simmons four years later. FUUUUCK that.
"I mean, Doc has been there by his side and then he goes and passes up a wide open lay up and as a player has refused/been unable to improve his shooting, can‚Äôt hit free throws.   Ben Simmons can defend and drop dimes unlike anyone else, but is severely limited on offense to the point he has the range and Shooting ability of Shaq. All he can do is dunk and hit mid range occasionally.  just a bigger, better version of Lonzo Ball, without the ability to shoot the 3."
Lonzo Ball would be looking like J Kidd if he played in the 80s
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
"If he had a J he would have been sick! But I don't think we can assume that people coming up today will automatically have a jumper, much less functional skills. It's taken Lonzo Ball years to retool his shot from the abomination he used in college and his rookie year.   I wish Shamgod had worked out. Loved him!"
"I'm not a Lakers fans. If I was a fan, why would I say Schroder is better than Lonzo in this thread? Does it makes sense to you?  They're both 3-D players who struggle mighty to get anything done by putting the ball on the ground. There's a reason why Pelicans won't match any big contracts for Lonzo. Lonzo fixed his catch and shoot game to his credit, but he's just that. A catch and shoot guard, who can't finish at the rim because he's afraid of contact."
"When it really comes down to it, the Lakers don‚Äôt need more playmakers to win in the playoffs. If Lebron and AD aren‚Äôt healthy, they aren‚Äôt winning, and if they are, they just need guys who fit well around them like Lonzo. Playmakers make them a better regular season team, but they want the ball in Lebron or AD‚Äôs hands come playoff time."
Lonzo is delusional he thinks he's a floor generally and wants to be a lead ball handler over Zion
"I wanna say Ben Simmons is a great defender and a great passer on the transition, but I just don't get why teams would give up all star caliber players for this dude lol. He has been so inconsistent in the playoffs and had his worst moment this year. He is not valuable in half court offense and his own team that he is supposed to be the 2nd best player of can't even play him in the last 5 mins of a crucial game. I dont wanna hear the jumpshot excuse becuz we have seen multiple reports of him working out on his jumpshot for the past few years and nothing happens. A player like Lonzo Ball was able to be a great 3 pt shooter and fixed his form in 2 seasons and now he is a 38% 3 pt shooters, why can't Simmons do that. I just don't think he has confidence in his offensive game and he doesn't seem to have the work ethic to improve offensively."
Lonzo Ball or third piece.     Pick one.
Lamelo ball is a better point guard than John Stockton. Prolly lonzo too. Pistol Pete is up there.
43% 3 point shooter but everyone was talking about his weird-ass shooting form that he would have to rebuild once he got to the NBA.  And he did have to rebuild it because he came into the league shooting around 30%  I think lonzo is a fine player and starter but it was clear that lavar ball pulled some rasputin shit with the media and magic johnson to get them to hype his kid.   It would have been better if the lakers had taken tatum
"yeah lavar ball did a great job selling magic johnson on taking lonzo, in hindsight it was a clear mistake though"
I got downvoted a while ago for saying I'd rather have Lonzo Ball. I still stand by that.
I'd trade Big Mitch for Simmons. Play Simmons at center.   Get Lonzo with money.   Get Sexton with the deal talked about today.   Knicks starters:   PG -  Ball  SG - Sexton  SF - RJ  PF - Randle  C - Simmons
Where does Lonzo Ball rank if he finishes his career with: - 10x MVPs - 10x DPOY - 10x Championships - 10x FMVPs - 10x All-NBA - 10x All-Defense
"You're right, I completely blanked on the RFA rules for a second  But still I'm pretty sure they'd just let him walk to a non contender willing to pay him shit tons of money over moving him to the Lakers only in exchange for Kuzma (who's on a 3 year 40 million deal which takes some of their financial flexibility away regardless). So the Lakers are gonna have to be more enticing if they want the Pels to play ball with them IMO   Also thats only if Lonzo is deadset on the Lakers only. If there's other teams he's interested in then the amount they are willing to trade does matter as we are more likely to work with him to move to a contender that actually is willing to offer us something more"
"Schroeder is not top ten. Not close.  The list.  Luka, CP3, Fox, Ja, Lowry, Curry, Westbrook, Kyrie, Trae Young, Lillard  The actual list of best PG's in the NBA has dropped off a bit cause Westbrook is gonna fall fast off the list soon, and I think Conley and Kemba are done in terms of being top ten guys, but in there place there could be ascendant guys asap, like Suggs, Cunningham, SGA, Dejounte Murray, FVV, Lonzo or Lamelo Ball, etc.  I'm sure I'm missing someone. Edit: That person is not D'lo."
"I hope he comes back, as I have a Lonzo Ball signed Lakers jersey. It would certainly create a little more value than it currently has lol"
Stats are basically identical.. i dont see why people trash lonzo ball but ben simmons is over rated ‚Ä¶ a 2 time all star shouldn‚Äôt be even close the lonzo ball stats remember ben gets paid 110 more millions then lonzo ball but they basically get the same production‚Ä¶
"&gt; tons of number 1 picks don‚Äôt pan out either. IIRC, the career averages for guys drafted second are actually better than the guys taken first      Nah that's not true at all. Here are the #1 and #2 picks of all 74 NBA drafts dating back to 1949. The #1 picks have generally had some pretty great careers, with very few busts. There have definitely been some great #2 picks over the years, but there are way more busts at that slot. Go all the way back to 1980 and there's only like 8 or 9 years where the #2 outperformed the #1.      |Draft|1st Overall|2nd Overall| :--|:--|:--| |2020|Anthony Edwards|James Wiseman| |2019|Zion Williamson|Ja Morant| |2018|Deandre Ayton|Marvin Bagley III| |2017|Markelle Fultz|Lonzo Ball| |2016|Ben Simmons|Brandon Ingram| |2015|Karl-Anthony Towns|D'Angelo Russell| |2014|Andrew Wiggins|Jabari Parker| |2013|Anthony Bennett|Victor Oladipo| |2012|Anthony Davis|Michael Kidd-Gilchrist| |2011|Kyrie Irving|Derrick Williams| |2010|John Wall|Evan Turner| |2009|Blake Griffin|Hasheem Thabeet| |2008|Derrick Rose|Michael Beasley| |2007|Greg Oden|Kevin Durant| |2006|Andrea Bargnani|LaMarcus Aldridge| |2005|Andrew Bogut|Marvin Williams| |2004|Dwight Howard|Emeka Okafor| |2003|LeBron James|Darko Milicic| |2002|Yao Ming|Jay Williams| |2001|Kwame Brown|Tyson Chandler| |2000|Kenyon Martin|Stromile Swift| |1999|Elton Brand|Steve Francis| |1998|Michael Olowokandi|Mike Bibby| |1997|Tim Duncan|Keith Van Horn| |1996|Allen Iverson|Marcus Camby| |1995|Joe Smith|Antonio McDyess| |1994|Glenn Robinson|Jason Kidd| |1993|Chris Webber|Shawn Bradley| |1992|Shaquille O'Neal|Alonzo Mourning| |1991|Larry Johnson|Kenny Anderson| |1990|Derrick Coleman|Gary Payton| |1989|Pervis Ellison|Danny Ferry| |1988|Danny Manning|Rik Smits| |1987|David Robinson|Armen Gilliam| |1986|Brad Daugherty|Len Bias| |1985|Patrick Ewing|Wayman Tisdale| |1984|Hakeem Olajuwon|Sam Bowie| |1983|Ralph Sampson|Steve Stipanovich| |1982|James Worthy|Terry Cummings| |1981|Mark Aguirre|Isiah Thomas| |1980|Joe Barry Carroll|Darrell Griffith| |1979|Magic Johnson|David Greenwood| |1978|Mychal Thompson|Phil Ford| |1977|Kent Benson|Otis Birdsong| |1976|John Lucas|Scott May| |1975|David Thompson|Dave Meyers| |1974|Bill Walton|Marvin Barnes| |1973|Doug Collins|Jim Brewer| |1972|Larue Martin|Bob McAdoo| |1971|Austin Carr|Sidney Wicks| |1970|Bob Lanier|Rudy Tomjanovich| |1969|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Neal Walk| |1968|Elvin Hayes|Wes Unseld| |1967|Jimmy Walker|Earl Monroe| |1966|Cazzie Russell|Dave Bing| |1965|Fred Hetzel|Rick Barry| |1964|Jim Barnes|Joe Caldwell| |1963|Art Heyman|Rod Thorn| |1962|Bill McGill|Paul Hogue| |1961|Walt Bellamy|Tom Stith| |1960|Oscar Robertson|Jerry West| |1959|Bob Boozer|Bailey Howell| |1958|Elgin Baylor|Archie Dees| |1957|Rod Hundley|Charlie Tyra| |1956|Si Green|Bill Russell| |1955|Dick Ricketts|Maurice Stokes| |1954|Frank Selvy|Bob Pettit| |1953|Ray Felix|Bob Houbregs| |1952|Mark Workman|Jim Baechtold| |1951|Gene Melchiorre|Mel Hutchins| |1950|Charlie Share|Don Rehfeldt| |1949|Howie Shannon|Alex Groza| |1948|Andy Tonkovich|George Kok| |1947|Clifton McNeeley|Glen Selbo|"
"I wonder if Markelle Fultz, Rajon Rondo, and Lonzo Ball could be involved. Just shuffle around a bunch of PGs who shoot like garbage."
"&gt; LaVar Ball: We never left! We back, bitches! Lonzo is the best player in the NBA! Two time MVP. Three time ROTY. Four time DPOY."
"The wording on this is weird.  &gt;Expect to eventually hear of them searching for potential pathways, however obstacle-strewn they would be, to reacquiring restricted free agent-to-be Lonzo Ball for that reason.  Is he just guessing we will try to get him?"
"I didn‚Äôt pay attention to draft boards but watched a lot of college ball, I probably would‚Äôve drafted Tatum 1st and Fox 2nd just based on watching them. Lonzo and Fultz were good but Tatum and Fox balled out that year on better teams"
"That's poverty franchise talk. Ball is still only 23 years old and is clearly developing and improving alongside Ingram and Zion where he is now a valuable asset that other team's are vying for.   This is a team that signed Steven Adams to a two year extension last offseason at $18M/yr. So now they can't re-sign Ball for a similar number (give or take a few million)?  Regardless, if they have budget constraints this is when you make secondary moves to fit someone like Lonzo Ball into your budget. You move Adams or Bledsoe to another team for cap space. Add in prospects or future firsts if you have to. If your eye is to a couple of years from now you don't need those guys anyway.  Unless they sign and trade Lonzo to the Sixers in a package for Ben Simmons or to another team for a different positive asset then the Pelicans are really doing their fans dirty."
"WHY WOULD WE HAVE INTEREST IN LONZO BALL WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE AN ALL-STAR SHOOTING GUARD. WE NEED A LEAD GUARD, NOT A 2!!!!!!!!!!!"
New Orleans is a poverty franchise if they let Lonzo Ball walk out the door for nothing. I‚Äôm not even a fan of the Pelicans and I‚Äôm disgusted how they handled the PG situation since Zion has been there
"Zach Lavine is actually useless on this team. Not only is his skill set completely redundant and strictly dominated by a few other players (like a Bradley Beal), but he also plays no defense. They would have been better off taking literally any player over him. Heck someone like Lonzo Ball, even if he‚Äôs not the better player in a vaccum, would be a way better fit for this team."
"The clippers can‚Äôt send an offer sheet that would be worth whatever Lonzo‚Äôs market value is because they‚Äôre already above the salary cap. They can‚Äôt offer anything close to whatever New Orleans‚Äô highest price for Lonzo would be.  The only avenue the Clippers have to obtain an RFA who will attract decent offers like Lonzo Ball would be to sign and trade for him. In that scenario, LA would send out salary to match Lonzo‚Äôs contract (15-20 mill ballpark?) to obtain him."
I can name 15 better starting PGs than Lonzo Ball and 15 better starting SF better than Duncan Robinson lol and don‚Äôt even get me started on Noel lmaooo

Pre-injury John Wall was always satisfying to watch. He has a very fluid style both with the ball and his movement on the court.  Also Lonzo. Easily one of the most creative passers in the league and he's always dead on target except when he's shooting.
Yeah Fultz doesn‚Äôt belong on this list. There was a lonzo ball debate too.  The only reason KAT wasn‚Äôt the consensus 1 during the year was because of Kentucky‚Äôs stacked team had him play limited minutes until the tournament
I‚Äôd take him over Lonzo Ball but not over FVV. Does that help?
"Trae Young, Chris Paul, Rondo, Lonzo Ball, Curry, LBJ more like REAL point guards, not 2 guards masquerading as a true PG and can get everyone aligned."
"That‚Äôs a big question lol, in a perfect world we would dump Thompson and a bunch of our useless bench pieces such as Carsen edwards for Lonzo ball because I think he‚Äôs the perfect point for us.  But realistically I have no clue what we‚Äôre going to do because it was confirmed that Tatum recruited Thompson and Thompson‚Äôs also a clutch client which could cause a huge problem for us if we dumped him in bad fashion.   I also have to mention TT is a shitty human being who was found multiple times going out and partying during the season with the covid restrictions in place so I have more than a reason to want him gone as well"
I agree Ball is huge upgrade over Payton *and* you aren't sacrificing defense either. He will make Mitch and Obi better instantly and he gives us a much improved transition game. Plus he's a floor spacing  option in the half court that Randle can look at.  Oubre is nice because he gives the Knicks another shot creator and a legimate 3rd option behind Randle and RJ. Bringing in Bouknight as a combo guard off the bench you can plug in as a Burks/Bullock replacement (whichever of the 2 we don't keep).   **Lonzo**/Rose/Vildoza **RJ**/IQ/Bouknight **Oubre**/Bullock/Knox **Randle**/Obi/??? **Mitch**/Noel/???
"I'm thinking we sign Lonzo Ball &amp; Kelly Oubre, and trade up for Bouknight. I think all the Dame talk is noise. It just makes sense to develop our young guys at this point."
Lonzo Ball with the right coach will step up to all star level.
Lonzo Ball but with a better looking shot
"I think he may need to get out of New Orleans for him to truly shine. He needs to have the ball in his hands more, but he's not going to get that at NO sharing with Lonzo, BI, Zion, etc."
Lonzo Ball about to give the Big Balls award
When Lonzo was playing in Australia I was down in Wollongong at a pub with some friends and my mate says that Lonzo Ball just turned up. I asked where and turned around - of course the huge black guys stood out!
Counterpoint: The Suns should keep Chris Paul and not trade him for fucking Lonzo Ball lmao
"Middleton is not consistent enough as a second star - so despite having enough skill for the role, he's just not good enough. You can have 1 prime MJ quarter, 3 Klay Thompson quarters, and 8 Lonzo Ball (Lakers days version) quarters every 3 games.   Jrue sadly is also not living up to the 3rd star role. His defense and team play are top notch but he's on a max contract, that's simply not enough production.  It all starts with these two."
"Have you people watch this dude play ? You people act like magically knowing your role add 10 ppg and 20% efficiency from the floor. What the fuck are you lot nattering on about. Trade the lakers for your sub all star player then if that‚Äôs where he is? There‚Äôs a reason pelicans got Lonzo and Ingram over kuzma and it‚Äôs not cos he‚Äôs insanely valuable ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§°. You act like a professional ball player , when his two best players are down doesn‚Äôt know how to play and score more if he‚Äôs really capable of it."
"I still feel like the role he's most likely to succeed in is at SG. It mitigates his defensive shortcomings by overcoming his slightly slow reactions with his length relative to other SGs, he can still switch and cover bigger guys, and he plays like a classic swingman on offense anyway.   He's not a terrific rebounder (for his size) and he's not great at post defense, so keeping him in the backcourt and on the wing suits him better. His role then becomes ""give your guy trouble by being bigger and longer on D, spot up and knock down shots on O"", and with the right matchups, like when his defender is at a major size mismatch, he can drive and cut to the hoop, where he has pretty good moves if you get him the ball in the right spot--which, after years of watching Kuzma, the right spot is where he has a clean shot and no time to think. Lonzo was great at getting him the ball like that; LeBron tends to set him up where he gets to have a choice to shoot or drive, and his reaction time still isn't quite fast enough against quality NBA defenses; he'd ruin players in any other pro basketball league in the world, but NBA defenses and defenders are just too good if you're .02 seconds slow.   He's a little frustrating as a fan--he shows flashes at times of becoming the player the fanbase had hoped he'd become as a 1st/2nd-year player, but he can't quite get over the hump permanently. I wonder if a starting-SG role would cure what ails him, or if it'll take a change of scenery/new coaching staff to do it--I think his current role as the bench guy that comes in at any of several positions depending on who's in foul trouble/needs a breather isn't helping at all."
"Murray is out till All Star break, I want Lonzo because I want a player who gets and needs touches.  Murray can play off ball at a very high level if it helps the team win games after his return from injury."
"If I‚Äôm honest, I don‚Äôt even think lonzo is the best among the three for the nuggets. Reggie Jackson fits their needs of ‚Äúanother guard who can seriously go and get a bucket but can play off-ball‚Äù plus he also plays into Jokic‚Äôs strengths like Murray does. Which makes him useful without Murray and opens a lot of rotations when Murray gets back."
"Reggie - Clippers. Lue used him in a way that allowed him to flourish. Would like to see him back there.   Lonzo - would like see him in Charlotte. He's a full blown role player that probably shouldn't be your primary ball handler. Charlotte has enough guard/wing talent to allow him to play to his strengths. Plus the ball brothers together would be fun to watch.  Lowry - Pelicans. They need a vet that knows how to win, and that can be a leader for the team. Lowry is old, but he could be a lesser version of what CP3 is to this Suns team."
Randle looked like an empty stats guy and a lost cause until this season. Ingram was already showing steady development while on the Lakers. Lonzo Ball hasn't really shown much after leaving LA. And Clarkson didn't really show much until this season.
"The Lakers development team sucks. Players leave the Lakers and always seem to get better. For example, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, Deangelo Russel, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson‚Ä¶"
Idk I keep reading articles about us offering Lonzo Ball the max.  I know his shooting isn't garbage anymore but come on.
Ah you got me. We mortgaged Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram who still can‚Äôt make the playoffs or the play in game with Zion. A Mickey Mouse ring and 1st round exit is still more than you‚Äôll see with Zion before he starts demanding a trade
"Maybe. But Magic made the pick after selling himself on Lonzo being a 'Hollywood Story'. Magic, legit thought that by picking Lonzo it would all be all unicorns and rainbows. Lol  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2936967-lonzo-ball-rumors-magic-johnson-lakers-drafted-pg-for-hollywood-story"
No I just mean someone like Lonzo Ball or Dejounte Murray. We just can‚Äôt have Coby White as our starter
"I honestly like the Ball brothers ads a bit, Lonzo going ""When I slouch it affects my jump shot"" sounds like the exact type of shit they'd hear LaVar yelling at them about at the dinner table."
Lonzo ball rookie year? Noah? Fultz?
Can we stop talking about him? Just poor the father of lonzo ball? Please.
"Melo only, Lonzo didn't play in Lithuania.   Also Melo was widely considered the most talented of the ball bros anyway, he would have made it even if he didn't play in Lithuania  The only reason they played overseas is because the untalented one was kicked out of ncaa for shoplifting in China"
Literally just watch the first ten seconds of a tweet and proclaim Lamelo Ball the greatest prospect since Lonzo Ball
Let me trigger you further. That's a real Lonzo Ball stat line
"Kemba with Smart's defense would have been the best point guard the celtics get. Unfortunately Kemba is super injury prone, and Marcus Smart makes a bunch of boneheaded decisions.  You are right though, Smart's inability to drive and kick or shoot offball really hurt the celtics. I genuinely don't think hes the answer, but I don't know who is. The J's have similar playstyles and unless one of them develops some playmaking skills, its gonna tough looking for a complementary pg.  They need a 1 who can initiate  in halfcourt, drive, and shoot 3's when not handling the ball.  I don't know if celtics want him or how the fans feel about him, but I think Lonzo would be really great in Boston."
He is not. They could use someone like Lonzo Ball to just distribute to the jays and not huck bad shots.
Lonzo Ball.
"They traded for Vuc so the plan is to make the playoffs so they can convince Lavine to stay  I hope they release Lauri cause he‚Äôs pretty pointless with Vuc there and go after Lonzo cause he would be a great fit alongside Lavine as he is a good defensive player, playmaker, floor spacer, can lead the team, and can play off ball"
"‚ÄúSuper well‚Äù is an interesting way to describe passing up on Jaylen brown and jayson Tatum for Lonzo ball and Brandon Ingram. Not a correct way, but definitely an interesting way."
"Lonzo is also 6 years younger than Sato and has improved year after year in several critical areas (3P%, eFG%, FT%) while also improving as an on-ball defender.  I think it's fair to say that Lonzo is a slight upgrade over Sato *right now*, but the real value of signing him is that he is already an improvement, but with the potential to improve *significantly* over the next few years.  If he was already an all-star PG then we would have no chance of signing him. The situation Chicago is in we need to roll the dice on some high ceiling players, because we don't have the cap space or picks to add a star in FA or the draft."
Lonzo also provides better spacing. Sato does not take many 3s so teams tend to help off of him when he doesnt have the ball.
"His ceiling is pretty bad too. If he becomes more athletic and a way better shooter he can be Lonzo ball. Even that would require absurd development. I‚Äôd rather take Bouknight, Keon, Garuba, Kai, or any large assortment of players if we‚Äôre going for ceiling."
I think for their timeline they are better off with lonzo ball but yeah i agree.
Lonzo Ball if he gets his UCLA confidence back
"I like:  - Giannis and Thanasis Antetokounpo because they sound like Greek Gods   - Also Lonzo Ball because that's just a perfect name for an NBA player (LaMelo is such a stupid first name that it cancels out the Ball last name)   - Steph and Seth Curry also got some nice names  - Danilo Galinari and Rajon Rondo are also great, as you mentioned  - I also like Rudy Gobert when spoken in a heavy French accent  - J.R. Smith is dope too even if it's kinda basic"
They barely beat the 2017 team in 7.  1. PG - De‚ÄôAaron Fox vs. Trae Young 2. SG - Donovan Mitchell vs. Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3. SF - Jayson Tatum vs.  Luka Doncic 4. PF - John Collins vs. Michael Porter Jr 5. C - Bam Adebayo vs De‚ÄôAndre Ayton 6.  Lonzo Ball vs Devonte Graham 7. Markelle Fultz vs. Collin Sexton 8. O.G. Anunoby vs. Mikal Bridges 9.

We already had lonzo ball. LeGM traded him away asap.
Lonzo and LaMelo Ball.
&gt; Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball  So Lonzo Ball?
"So this may sound weird but two things. I don‚Äôt see Lonzo as a primary ball handler anywhere. What I see him as is Danny Green who can be a great secondary handler. I don‚Äôt think the Celtics need a true PG. In the playoffs you want the ball in Tatum‚Äôs hands to start the primary action. I think they need a secondary ball handler who is a great spot up shooter to kick out to in case of the primary action failing. In this vision Tatum is a 20%  better playmaker. The transaction would be like the Brogdon precedent with Milwaukee and Indiana. Also last thing, this is the one move I see that makes them a top 10 offense and defensive team."
"1. Cade - less athletic Grant Hill  2. Mobley - more defensive minded Chris Bosh   3. Green - 75% of Bradley Beal, better defender   4. Suggs - Tall, athletic Lowry with less ass   5. Kuminga - Very athletic Harrison Barnes   6. Barnes - Diet Draymond Green   7. Moody - TJ Warren with better defense   8. Keon - Shanon Brown with a better jumper  9. Sengun - Sabonis lite  10. Mitchell - offensively competent Kris Dunn   11. Bouknight - Nickiel Alexander-Walker   12. Kispert - Doug McDermott  13. Giddey - Unathletic rookie Lonzo Ball"
"How is Lonzo is a primary ball handler? He is as non-factor in half court offense as Simmons in playoffs, except Lonzo can catch and shoot now, but still no off the dribble production at all. He gets himself some assists in fastbreaks, but that's not what you guys need."
Lonzo Ball feels attacked
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball 2/8/4 triple single
"lonzo.  he will stay in the NBA but people were comparing him to Jason kidd.  I never saw it and still don't.  kidd commanded the ball and drove into the defense, made them commit or make a mistake and then sets guys up for easy layups and dunks.  all of lonzos highlights were him passing the ball like a hot potato.  he never ran a fastbreak and often gave the ball up waaay too early where the other guy now had to break down the defense.  I see him becoming a backup point guard on a team within 5 years"
"DLo is a decent shooter. He shot 35% from 3 his first two seasons, with absolutely terrible spacing around him.   Lonzo‚Äôs and D‚ÄôLo‚Äôs skill sets mesh pretty nicely with little overlap, and the same can‚Äôt be said for Garland and Sexton.   Lonzo is a guy who moves the ball as a guard who playmakers for other with great vision but doesn‚Äôt excel at creating for himself. He‚Äôs also a pest defensively and can handle most 1s or 2s. Then you‚Äôve got DLo who is honestly the complete opposite. Not great at playmaking as a lead guard for teammates, but he can create his own shot and primarily looks to score. A weaker defender, so playing along side Zo would be beneficial since he can take the easier assignment defensively."
I see people liking my comments. Hear me out. Is Lonzo Ball the remix to Eric Snow? He seems like the ultimate complimentary off-guard.
Lonzo Ball?
&gt;He also made one thing clear: Zion nor Brandon Ingram was the reason for his exit  ESPN: SVG said Zion nor Ingram pushed him out but curiously didn't mention Lonzo Ball.  Was there issues between Ball and Van Gundy?
"Solid counter point. If Lonzo can continue to develop his 3 I agree. He's not really a pull-up shooter off ball but he showed significant signs of improvement last season there. I personally love Lonzo and always have, I would actually love him in Indiana but I'm not as high on DLo.  I really enjoyed watching his Brooklyn squad but he doesn't seem like ""that guy"" to me anymore like he did there. I hope I'm wrong."
The fit next to each other has little to do with their streaky it's more so Lonzo has defense to cover up DLos short comings and Lonzo can play off ball.
"Jaylen‚Äôs an underrated defender by this point. He struggled this season (like everyone on the Celtics but advanced stats still mostly had him as neutral or a slight negative defensively) and some cherry picked clips that could be found on almost any player made people focus on his offball defense, often criticizing him for a defensive lapse that I‚Äôd later see an actual analyst fault someone else for.  He‚Äôs still a great on ball defender - while he‚Äôs in the top sixth of the league for shots attempted against him, opponents shoot 2.2% worse than their average when he defends them. That‚Äôs better than Ayton, RJ, OG, PG, Lonzo, Capela, Jrue, Kawhi, Mikal Bridges and a lot of others. There are some defensive advanced stats that put him above Tatum though I think Tatum‚Äôs definitely better.   He‚Äôd consistently raised his defense in the postseason and was fantastic last year while also also averaging 22 ppg on 58.6% ts. He tied Tatum in defensive raptor with +3  above guys like Myles Turner, Bam, Covington, Theis, Embiid, OG, Giannis, Butler, and Gobert. This year, guys with at least a .5 lower d-raptor include Ayton, Mikal Bridges, Hunter, Durant, Jrue, Patrick Beverley, Kawhi, Simmons, and PG. He also had a 1.1 dbpm which was better than Dort, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Danny Green and more last year and this year would be more than players like Mikal Bridges, Ayton, Capela, Hunter, Jrue, PG. Most impressively, he had the 4th most total defensive win shares with 1.1 only after Tatum, Lebron, and AD. Part of that is him getting to the ecf but Butler and Bam got to the finals and still have fewer defensive win shares."
"Not saying SVG was the right coach for the long term, but Zion, Lonzo, Hayes, NAW (kinda), Hart all improved. Even Ingram looked better in the games I saw.  I will grant you that there was a lot of bad guard play but that was by design, or at least should have been expected. Most 1st and 2nd year guards don't contribute to winning at all, and Bledsoe was not there to help the team win. That was why they took the ball out of the guards hands and gave it to Zion."
"2018-19: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Luke Walton fired)  2019-20: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Alvin Gentry fired)  2020-21: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball (Stan Van Gundy fired)  2021-22: ?  Lot of coaches getting fired for no one being the reason.   These players heads must be spinning with the coaching carousel they are on."
If you can fix Lonzo Ball you can fix Ben Simmons. Just have to trade him
"Lonzo is not a good ball handler/creator. He's an excellent transition passer and passer in the half court, but I don't think he should be the primary ball handler."
Lonzo Ball
Just like Paul's teams always seem to play better I love that teams with Lonzo have better ball movement. If his shot was better this could be a really fun team. Plus he's played with Steven Adams before.
"Did you watch them lmao? I can‚Äôt count the amount of times this team would collapse in the second half offensively and you would just have iso ball going on ever single possession. I get it, defense is also a concern, but this team was the least clutch team in the league. We have zero shot creation coming from our backcourt, it‚Äôs all Zion and BI creating shots.   What are you insinuating? Are you saying a Bledsoe-Lonzo backcourt isn‚Äôt actually bad and that are sole problem is that BI and Z are bad in defense? Did you even watch us last season?"
Or Lonzo at the 1 with one of the ones you mentioned off ball. The main problem with playing Bledsoe was that it limited what Lonzo could do on the court and his growth.
"We're not yet sure if Lonzo Ball is getting moved - New Orleans would have to sign Kyle Lowry for them not to match it (especially if it's only a 4yr/80mil deal) or Lonzo would have to be overpayed. I guess the other option would be a double sign-and-trade as suggested by Hollinger but it's not super likely in my opinion.  The upcoming 2021-2022 season is the final year of LaVine's current contract (19.5mil per year). Ideally they'd have to get someone this year before the Bulls cap out with the upcoming maximum contract for LaVine (5yrs/195mil). This year's draft class is not super strong but Point Guard still remains a position of need for them. And maybe it's just me being high on Lonzo, but I'd really like him there. I do not think Coby White is the option for the starting spot."
Lonzo ball
"Yes, and if they get Lonzo, they'll have all 3 Ball brothers."
Would you trade Coby White in a deal that gets you Lonzo?   I could see the following trade as being a decent starting place:   Hornets Get:   -	Coby White -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo Ball  Pelicans Get:   -	Devonte Graham   Some smaller pieces might have to be added somewhere though. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind NAW going to the Hornets and other Bulls stuff going to the Pelicans. Maybe:   Hornets Get:   -	NAW -	Thad Young  Bulls Get:   -	Lonzo -	Jalen McDaniels  Pelicans Get:   -	Graham -	Tomas Satoranski  As a starting point.
"is there any scenario where:  Toronto sends Lowry, receives Lonzo  Miami sends Dragic+assets, receives Lowry  NO sends Lonzo, receives Dragic + assets   Ball and Lowry would be sign&amp;trade. I don't know what 'assets' would entail but likely Precious + 2nd rd draft pick from Miami. And Toronto can add 2nd rd pick to New Orleans. I'm not well versed in limitations of sign&amp;trade and was wondering if this is even a possibility yet alone the three teams willing to do it."
I swear every fan base besides Pels loves Lonzo lol. I would check on Lonzo updates from the pels sub from time to time throughout the season and it was pretty polarizing (half hating him and half defending him).  That being said Lonzo is projected to be a solid starter. His on ball creation and playmaking  is very undeveloped(in the half court due to lack of elite first step and elite handle) for some one with perennial all-star potential. His ceiling of Jason Kidd lite is still possible but looking a little less likely with every season.
"Lavine truly deserves to get paid, especially for the level of his play. But I can't seem to identify who's a better fit to play together with him. My best guess is Lonzo Ball; I'm excited to see the potential of this duo and how they will fare."
Hornets would have to be at the top of the east for both Ball bros to make the ASG considering there‚Äôs not that many guard spots. I think Lonzo would definitely get overshadowed by Melo if he went to Charlotte. His best chance at becoming an All Star is going to a big market tbh.
Any recommendations? Dont send me any Lonzo Ball music tracks that‚Äôs what got me to this point.
Luka leads our offense?  Lonzo can just d up and play off ball
"I think we‚Äôll be fine. Hayward is a great passer. Miles Bridges flashed some pretty good playmaking skills last season. Plumlee has always been a pretty good secondary ball mover. Bouknight should at least be able to create for himself. We‚Äôre also rumored to want re-sign Riller to a minimum contract.   Worst comes to worst, we just run like crazy in transition. LaMelo, Bridges, Lonzo, Bouknight, Rozier, and Kai should all be killer in transition."
I think he gets mis-cast a lot in terms of what people expect him to be able to do.  [This article](https://theanalyst.com/na/2021/07/lonzo-ball-new-orleans-pelicans-restricted-free-agent/) from Jackson Frank is a great breakdown on Lonzo IMO.
"&gt;Lonzo Ball is still expected to sign an offer sheet with Chicago, except the Bulls require a few financial moves before they can extend him the roughly four-year, $84 million contract that‚Äôs been discussed in league circles.  Fuck yeah, please don't match you Peli fucks"
"His recognition and awareness stood out to me. Giddey reads the game and creates shooting opportunities out of nothing. For Adelaide, Josh was very good at switching the ball to the weak-side corner whenever he saw the defender at the rim squeezing the strong-side of the floor.   I think the concerns about his passes getting picked off are overblown. He has the height to pass over the top of the defence and that overhead pass whips the ball to his teammate before the defence can respond. His passing windows will get smaller in the half-court in the NBA but he should still be very strong in transition.   LaMelo's not the right comp neither is Lonzo or Kyle Anderson. There are no real comparisons that make sense for Giddey"
"I do believe that Lonzo wants out of the NOP.  With Zion doing the ball handling skills and him being regulated to catch and shoot drills.  Expect language in the contract for a poison pill against NOP.  If I were NOP, I'd Match and still try for another PG because Lonzo is 6'6"" and can easily move to the SG position."
"This made me think of Charles Barkley saying if he played today in the NBA, he'd be driving a rocket ship to work.  In what fucking world is Lonzo Ball worth $80 million dollars?  Unbelievable."
"Yeah I'm not gonna act like I know pelicans ball very well, but from the outside looking in, they just picked up Valanciunas, I would go with the better playmaker to make sure there ball doesn't stick too much. Lonzo, Zion, Ingram and Valanciunas IMO is a more balanced squad than with Lowry. But NO would know Lonzo's strengths and weaknesses better than anyone else, so...I just hope Lowry doesn't end up washed halfway through this year. I would love to see Zion and Ingram stay in the small market and cause some noise."
Cp3 resigns   Simmons gets traded   One of (Reggie Jackson Cameron Payne Lonzo ball Schroeder) Get a BAG and are considered massively overpaid
[8 attempts a game at a 38% clip is mediocre](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/4066421/lonzo-ball)  People that confidently talk about basketball while being completely wrong really are something special
"I also was a Lonzo doubter, but now he's my PG and LaMelo is making amazing plays.  Worshipping my Ball altar every day to see LiAngelo in NBA now."
"I think it‚Äôs more so Zo was the only spacing player they had on the roster, so he was forced to spread the floor when the ball wasn‚Äôt in his hands. Surprisingly his pick and roll ppp wasn‚Äôt too bad considering his reputation and it‚Äôs hard for Lonzo to be an effective cutter off ball when no one else outside of BI was respected beyond the arc, so it made more sense in the bigger picture of offensive flow to keep him as a threat deep. I agree he took too many 3‚Äôs but it‚Äôs hard to find him different shots given the makeup of that roster"
Kinda like Lonzo to the Celtics they need a good passer on the team because their offense can often turn into ISO ball really quick. Lonzo is the perfect skillset a secondary playmaker that moves the ball and plays great defense to alleviate their problems.
Damn Lonzo Ball went from being call a bust to a hot commodity.
"what do you mean, he is a combo guard? He is great at transitional offense, Vuc and Lavine can play make at half court with Lonzo helping. Donovans system relies more on sharing the ball rather then a ball dominant pg"
34% on 6.3 3's a game for Marcus the last 2 years while trending down  37% on 7.2 a game for Lonzo while trending up who is also a much better primary ball handler which is what the team needs
"I'm still wondering if people even watched Lonzo. His numbers look better, but he's still an ultra-passive point guard with a below average half-court game. He has nice outlet passes and highlights, but he plays the game like it's a pick-up game at the park. He doesn't even attempt to run an offense half the time. If he dribbles the ball up the court, he'll pass it to the first wings who pops, then finds himself a cozy spot on the corner and waits for something to happen.  If I'm paying a guy $20 million to give me 15/5/6 on below average true shooting (55.1% compared to league average 56.5%), I better be getting an alpha personality who can lead a team to the playoffs. Lonzo doesn't give me that. Let someone else overpay him."
"You can't cherrypick 2 dudes to say BPM is ""bad"". Even then Middleton took 16 shots to score 20 ppg on one of the best offenses in the league, so BPM is pretty on point. It says that khris Middleton's points per possession is middling and that his defense is average. Which I don't disagree with. Ja Morant is bad defensively, and BPM is on point with that. Ja took 15 shots to score 19 ppg and had a 7-3 ast/to ratio, BPM is an advanced stat. It punishes him for shooting 30% behind the arc, 45% from the field, bad turnover ratio, and mediocre points per possession, with bad defense. Lonzos defense is overrated at this point and even if he defends well, Lavine and Vooch should and will pound the ball reducing Lonzo to a fucking spot up shooter. At which point we can get a 3 and D guard for less than 20 mil. And one with more than 2 years of shooting success.."
"I‚Äôm assuming Lowry to Miami and Lonzo to Chicago are pretty much done deals so eliminating them.   He hasn‚Äôt been talked about much compared to the other FA point guards but i‚Äôd LOVE if the knicks signed Reggie Jackson. He‚Äôd be cheaper than guys like lonzo and lowry and he can play really well off-ball which is perfect bc RJ and Randle will be playmaking a lot too.   Another guy id love is Gary Trent Jr, i feel i‚Äôve been higher on him than consensus opinion. Solid defender and complete sniper that can also create his own shot a bit"
I do yes. There is a couple crazy college stats that are floating out there about how certain guys could only shoot with a certain brand. Lonzo had a crazy split with the UCLA ball manufacturer vs other brands.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-will-switch-from-spalding-to-wilson-as-its-official-basketball-manufacturer-for-2021-22-season/
"Agreed. This might be the last time the Raps have cap space in a few years. Even grabbing a Richaun Holmes or Lonzo Ball would make more sense than taking back middling prospects and contracts, but if the Raptors strike out on all the attractive free agents I guess the calculations change"
"Suggs more of a combo guard like Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Brogdon are  He‚Äôs gonna be a really good on ball defender, over all help disruptor off ball too. He can operate PnR better than Lonzo because he‚Äôs a better driver and finisher, he can hit some really sick head pass in transition nicely too.   What he lacks is off dribble shooting, handles not tight at all or good enough to be a lead guard like Morant or Fox or Trae Young, and his passing accuracy is not that good to be the primary facilitator either."
https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/31462200/lonzo-ball-set-restricted-free-agent-love-return-new-orleans-pelicans
how would you feel about Lonzo Ball?
"Nah this is a fucking overpay. BPM has his defense slipping every year, and only being averagish last year. And aside from that you have a 15 ppg role player with an ok 3 point shot who will spend too much time off-ball to use his playmaking to do anything in our offense. Kind of like rondo not being able to playmake bc he was standing watching jimmy, wade, and gasol pound the ball. Vooch and Lavine are going to have gigantic usage rates, which limits Lonzo to being an okay defender with an ok 3 point shot, which is not worth 20 goddamn mil. Big overpay."
"He‚Äôs on my ‚Äúall-hypothetical all-star‚Äù team with Lonzo Ball, Josh Richardson, Robert Covington, &amp; Otto Porter."
"Joe Harris and Lonzo Ball are not defended the same, this comparison is insane."
Why would lonzo goto Chicago though. Ball rose lavine vuc is a fringe playoff team
"Lonzo actually v good at post entry passes, found Zion all the time in great spots especially early season before they did the point Zion thing. He struggles to run sets as main ball handler sometimes, but with a guy like Lavine on the roster who can be crazy usage ball handler guy on offence he should be fine imo"
"The assumption would be that it gets us at least one asset like Precious Achiuwa or a first round pick. Maybe both if we can bargain hard enough. Then they can try to flip Dragic to another team. Or maybe they‚Äôve figured out that the guys they‚Äôre targeting in free agency with big offers (Jarrett Allen, Lonzo Ball are rumored examples) are going elsewhere. So then Dragic is a solid vet on an expiring deal that can be moved at the deadline to a team that wants to add some depth for the playoffs."
This guy is irrational about Lonzo ball . Makes this whole convo pretty much pointless
A team that needs an average point guard or back-up PG with cap space and rookie contracts  New Orleans is going to miss out on Lowry and is about to lose Lonzo Ball just to trade for Dragic
"I think 15 is decent value for him. Set shooting and defense is enticing, but he's too limited as an off the dribble scorer.   People seem to see him as a guy who can run your offense or be an off ball 3&amp;D guard, when really he's a catch and shoot guy who can run the fast break and not much else.   Being called a PG has done wonders for people's perception of Lonzo. In terms of actual skillset he's not an nba PG, and he shows little chance of becoming one."
"How can you have a Pelicans flair and say he doesn‚Äôt fit? He‚Äôs very clearly an incredible fit with Zion, he shoots and plays defense, exactly what Zion and the Pelicans need. He‚Äôs not a mediocre shooter either, he‚Äôs literally the best shooter on the team. Lonzo‚Äôs half court deficiencies are overstated and the Pels already have 2 players that need the ball in their hands.   Lonzo passes and throws lobs to Zion all the time, he‚Äôs like the only player that understands their win condition is feeding Zion. It should not shock anyone that Zion wants to keep him."
"You can‚Äôt sit here and say well among PG I have him as 17th in the whole league and out of the other side of the mouth say he should play next to someone who can be more on the ball in the half court. If you look at just guards there are so many, so many guards you‚Äôd rather have. You don‚Äôt have Booker on your list? You don‚Äôt have Jamal Murray? Donovan Mitchell? Beal? Lavine? Irving? Harden? Brown? McCollum?   Like who did he have a better season than last year? Was he better than terry rozier? Was be better than FVV? Tim Hardaway and Norman Powell are both coming off two very strong seasons in a row, both FA, both 28, was Lonzo better than either of them? Let‚Äôs just be honest."
"People are always so vague when they talk about point guard duties. I think in general people have way too strict of a definition of what a point guard should be in modern basketball.  If by ""orchestrate half court offense"" you mean set up plays, feed zion in the post, bring the ball up the court and make good decisions, then lonzo can do all of these things.  If by ""orchestrate half court offense"" you mean literally having the half court offense run thru lonzo, isn't that ingram and zion's job? You run the offense through your best players, that's how NBA basketball works. Yes it would be nice to have someone like lowry who can also create, but it's not a necessity by any means."
"Not a surprise as Lonzo would be fun to play with for anyone. The ball never sticks and he's always looking for you in transition. The problem comes from when you need him to create, because he can't really do that for himself."
"So let‚Äôs say Zion doesn‚Äôt care one way or the other or doesn‚Äôt want Lonzo to stay, what do you think he‚Äôs going to say when asked this question?  Exact same thing as he said here.  He‚Äôs not going to trash Lonzo.  He‚Äôs going to say he likes him and hopes he stays but it‚Äôs not up to him.   I have nothing against Lonzo and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs be fine on a team where he fits.  He doesn‚Äôt fit here because he‚Äôs nothing more than a D and mediocre 3 player with secondary ball handling skills.  He can‚Äôt create offense for himself or anyone else except in transition.   You re sign him and you are locking him in as the #3 best player on the team. And that construction was a bottom 10 team last year.  There‚Äôs no configuration of those three that make a championship contender unless NAW and JV make some superstar leap."
Naw isn‚Äôt a point guard. They tried to get him to handle the ball more for the 2nd unit. He had a couple games where he filled in as a ballhandler. But at best he‚Äôs a combo guard. NAW was a 17th pick. Why are you framing them drafting other guards as an affront to Lonzo like the aren‚Äôt allowed to get other guards on the roster lmao.
"Which is stupid, not having a fast paced offense when you have young/fast guys like Zion and Lonzo is inexcusable and a big part of why SVG is nowhere near our team anymore. Despite that we still had a great offense thanks to Zion's greatness. Lonzo's offensive mishaps didn't lose us games, it was our atrocious nearly worst in the league defense (Due to Bledsoe/Zion/BI/and some blame on Adams). We literally couldn't get ANY stops when teams turned it on in the fourth. It was also due to Zion not getting the ball for whatever reason at end of game situations (I blame BI narrow vision hero ball for that but I get down voted whenever I say it). I think the truth of the matter is Griffin gave up on Lonzo after the bubble disaster and decided to buy into Kira/NAW instead, then got mad when SVG wouldn't play them so he fired SVG and is now trying to remove Lonzo."
"He‚Äôs drafted one point guard at 13 who was the best on the board who has only been a backup so far. Pursuing Kyle Lowry, who is clearly a better and much more established player than Lonzo, a multi time allstar and nba champion, is hardly disrespectful. Moving Lonzo off ball is probably best for his skill set and his career TBH considering he‚Äôs a weak ballhandler as a primary one and can‚Äôt get the hold or take guys off the dribble. None of those things are disrespectful."
"Wait, there are dedicated Lonzo Ball fans?"
god I cant wait for delusional lonzo ball fans to be done with the pels
He‚Äôs better in the half court than people give him credit tbh . I think your under selling Lonzo . I‚Äôve watched his entire career I‚Äôm pretty well versed in the Lonzo Ball lol. He improves every year . He will make the bulls better from day one purely by playing great defense . He‚Äôs been getting better and less afraid af finishing at the rim . He was afraid of driving for a long time but since his free throw percentage has climbed he has been noticeably more comfortable attacking the rim . He might not be a huge volume scorer but he was shooting 8 3 point attempts a game and knocking them down at 38% . That‚Äôs decent volume . I really just don‚Äôt even understand your take on the wizards . They will finish bottom of the league next year let‚Äôs be real
No but Lonzo didn‚Äôt always bring it up either . Ingram Zion and Lonzo would all bring the ball up . this doesn‚Äôt have to be an argument man I‚Äôve watched Lonzos whole career and most of his games . Lonzo is a good point guard yes . Lonzo just had his best year yet playing more like a SG yes . Both true . Nothing but love brother
I think Bulls have to clear Thaddeus Young‚Äôs contract off their books to make room for Lonzo Ball.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ovlff9/fischer_lonzo_ball_expected_to_receive_a_big/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
Lonzo is supposed to shore up the defense a bit too while providing off ball shooting.   In theory that works better than Westbrook playmaking but idk..
"Phoenix traded for CP3, a better player than Lowry and with only 1 year left on his deal, without having to give up a significant rotation piece.  The Pelicans are about to commit max money to Lowry for multiple seasons and in the process of doing so it is going to cost them Lonzo Ball &amp; Josh Hart, both of whom were key pieces for them last year."
The Bulls gonna get Lonzo Ball. I am happy. :) Granted DKM and other Ball stans want him on the Hornets because of the supposed big 3 of the Bal brothers together.
"It‚Äôs more like  Adams + #10 for Valanciunas + #17  Lonzo Ball, Bledsoe + LAL 2022 1st for space for Lowry  Pretty good actually."
"I just think thibs has proven himself as a great regular season coach and their just gonna be a gerund in the east. I like that Lonzo brings some play making, and live the defense, but I think lavine needs a shooting gaurd not someone who wants the ball like Lonzo. I wanna see him somewhere he can actually be a play maker."
I think it should be good. Zach will be a top player this year with even a average PG to play with. Lonzo adds much needed defense as well. when Zach has the ball he just gets smothered by double and triple teams. we need someone to take the pressure off of him. Coby wasn't really getting the job done last year.   getting Lonzo allows both Zach and Coby to focus on the best parts of their games (which is off-ball shooting or driving to the hoop). Lonzo makes this engine run much smoother.   The real problem would be how much we have to pay him. if we lose Thad and Theis because of this there will be depth issues on the interior.
Lonzo Ball
"He plays super good off the bench with Lowry directing as well. Could stagger minutes and play small ball with Zion at the 5. Have Lowry command some bench mins with JV and feast on some momentum.  KL/Zion/JV rebounding is kinda beastly too. JV can't defend pick and rolls that well, but with Zion on help defence rim protection, itll be scary in the paint.  Dunno how your wing defenders are tho. Lonzo coming back would be unreal. That team would instantly become my 2nd fav."
"Lebron, rondo, Trent Forrest, Brandon Goodwin and Lonzo ball"
"He'd be amazing playing with Luka.  I feel like you can't really play him at the same time as Hardaway, Brunson or Burke for defensive purposes, but I'm not super familiar with Dallas' backcourt situation, especially with Josh Richardson moved.  We'll have to see what happens in FA. Obviously he'd be good in NO providing spacing for Zion, but if Lonzo goes somewhere else, it's the same issue of who are you pairing Bryn with in the backcourt?   I personally love the guy, but MIL had an amazing situation for him where he could play with their best 3 players, who are all capable of being lead ball handlers and are all good to HoF level defenders."
Classic lakers fans. Even with two top guys and a recent championship they're thirsting over other's players. Keep dreaming about Tatum. Maybe if you had a competent GM you would've chosen him over Lonzo fucking Ball
"Right now, I'm wondering if a lot of the Pelicans issues could have been mitigated if Bledsoe had been the 1 instead and placing Lonzo more off-ball. Maybe Bledsoe wouldn't have checked out.       Lonzo is notoriously finicky to work in. Do you know how hard it is for a point guard to not fit with Jrue? Elfrid Payton. Rajon Rondo. Tim Frazier. Ish Smith. Seemingly every point guard that the Pelicans ran opposite Jrue gave acceptable production when the starter."
Lonzo Ball after getting 24 million a year: Let's run it back it NOLA
"He shot like shit as a rookie so his half court offensive numbers where absolute shit so everyone concluded he couldn‚Äôt run a half court offense. His free throw shooting was atrocious so he would avoid contact when driving take off balance shots and had an awful percentage at the rim so he stopped driving all together or drive to pass. Since then he‚Äôs developed a three, he finishes at a much higher percentage near the rim, and has increased his free throw shooting. His pick and roll numbers are night and day now since he can hit the mid range at a much better percentage, and he‚Äôs not taking those awful off balance drives anymore.   The things that caused him to not drive and not engage in a pick and roll have been trending in a positive manner and appear to be resolved, it didn‚Äôt show this year because the team had zero spacing and had him playing as a third option, with point Zion surging, and BI being in love with his ball handling and play making, and Lonzo basically being the only one who can hit wide open threes that Zion creates (outside of BI) there was just no reason/opportunity for him to do a lot of these things people are saying he can‚Äôt do. With Bledsoe bi Zion and adams on your team you don‚Äôt need another guy driving into the paint it‚Äôs stupid. He played the role that his team needed him took a high volume of threes and made them at 38%. Just because he‚Äôs not CP3 level of half court offense doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt run it at all, hopefully in a different situation he can show more of these skill sets. The guy was an integral part of one of the best offenses in the league, the issue is they would collapse near the end of games because BI has tunnel vision Bledsoe was useless and frankly Zion just doesn‚Äôt demand the ball at end of game situations, and teams would punish them for having no spacing at all. Now a player like Dame or Lowry or CP3 could overcome these challenges and create game winning plays but those guys get paid way way way more than Lonzo."
Lonzo Ball?
"Lonzo would be a good fit for the Mavs IMO. Luka and Brunson being the primary half-court ball handlers would alleviate his lack of half-court creation, but would still be really valuable with his defense, revitalized catch&amp;shoot ability, passing in the open the open-court, and is still young with room for more improvement (fits Luka‚Äôs timeline)."
Give Lonzo Ball pls
"I guess I overstated what the report was, I thought it said they'd be willing. It was from the Fischer article today, but it said ""by just renouncing Lonzo Ball, the Pelicans could offer roughly 3yr/100 mill"""
[Here's a breakdown](https://stephnoh.substack.com/p/how-lonzo-ball-to-the-bulls-would) of our cap-clearing scenarios
"What I think most folks don‚Äôt completely understand yet is the importance of what the team does after drafting such guys.  The Lakers and their batch of young guys in the last few years are an excellent example.  The following guys were all on the Lakers roster: Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, DeAngelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball  The Lakers, when they had them, weren‚Äôt really about player development. So these guys faltered and were considered bench/role players at best. Now they‚Äôre all bonafide starters in the league.  The Spurs spent years developing Kawhi into the beast he is. Raptors have slowly but surely developed the non-lottery likes of OG, VanVleet, Siakam. Denver got an injured Michael Porter Jr falling to them, and, that‚Äôs a multiple time All-Star in the making.  Some teams are just better at player development than others. So yea, Jokic‚Äôs amazing in Denver, but had he been drafted by the Kings or Detroit, maybe he‚Äôd never have reached this point.  All this to say, the Kings suck, and should be relocated to Seattle. Thanks for reading."
"The crazy thing is that Lonzo is fairly explosive, you can see it on fast breaks some times. It's his pathetic ball handling that holds him back most of the time"
"Celtics will probably sign a starting PG for the MLE. Currently the only PGs on the roster are Smart, Pritchard, and Dunn, none of which I think are suitable starting PGs. Possible candidates are   - Patty Mills  - Reggie Jackson   - T.J. McConnell  - Derrick Rose  - Cam Payne  - Lonzo Ball in a S&amp;T  I don't really know what the FA market is gonna be like for any of these dudes tho so idk if the MLE is enough for them."
"if your idea of big free agent is Spencer Dinwiddie when there‚Äôs Kawhi Leonard, Tim Hardaway Jr, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Victor Oladipo, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Lonzo Ball then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you lmfaoo Spencer has torn his ACL twice, congrats on another 30 win season"
"&gt;Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order.     I call bullshit here. Fultz 1, Lonzo 2 and Tatum 3 was locked the fuck in a month before the draft."
"some people on this sub actually try to act like Markelle Fultz wasn't the consensus top pick but he absolutely was. It was only a few years ago and they already forgot.  Tatum at 3 was considered a bit of a reach at the time too, a lot of mock drafts had him in the 4-6 range. Nearly every draft expert had the top 3 picks being Markelle Fultz, Lonzo Ball and Josh Jackson in that order."
"We know how this goes. Same people tried to tell us Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram were garbage and the moment they left it was a mistake. Only Ingram really makes me sad about being gone"
"Also people are saying Barnes needs a shot as if that‚Äôs the only hole in his offensive game. He can‚Äôt really blow by guys either with explosiveness or with dribble moves. If he can shoot but can‚Äôt drive the ball, it‚Äôs still hard to see  how he‚Äôd be able to use his playmaking ability effectively. Lonzo ball is a pretty good example of the limited upside this gives"
100% agree with you. Love the 3 prospects we drafted this year. I think we try to develop our young guys while Kawhi is out...and quite frankly that makes more sense than leveraging future assets for a Demar type of player that isnt going to move the needle if Kawhi is really out all year. Having solid young pieces are super valuable while on rookie contracts because you can spend up elsewhere   Hopefully we can resign Reggie &amp; Batum..they were huge for us these playoffs. Ibaka was a dissapointment this season because of injuries but he is a good fit when healthy...We've been getting destroyed in the playoffs due to lack of athletic bigs that can switch on D and stretch the floor on offense. Also intrigued by Lonzo Ball if we find a way to S&amp;T for him. Besides that...I think the focus will be on getting Kawhi healthy while remaining competitive...next season is a wash regardless unless Kawhi somehow comes back for the playoffs which given his history is unlikely
Lonzo Ball also has a different asking price on the trade market
Dinwiddidle is a high usage guy. I don‚Äôt think that works well for Deni and Ruis development. Deni is a playmaking 3/4 and Rui looks like an efficient scorer when he gets chances. A guy like Lonzo would actually be a better fit getting guys the ball and shooting 3s
"part of the reason all those guys are good now is because they are all ball dominant players that were able to go on teams where they could get the touches and reps in to become stars. D'Lo in Brooklyn, Julius with NOLA and then even more so with the Knicks. Ingram in NOLA. Lonzo is maybe the only one I would say is the one that would've improved either way because he was already a good defender/passer/everything else when he was on the Lakers.  It's not jaded to say within a system where 3 ball dominant players all have to share the one ball, without having an opportunity to flourish individually would struggle."

Also intrigued by Lonzo Ball if we find a way to S&amp;T for him. Besides that...I think the focus will be on getting Kawhi healthy while remaining competitive...next season is a wash regardless unless Kawhi somehow comes back for the playoffs which given his history is unlikely
I'm all for S&amp;T Lonzo for Terry but I'm not giving up #8 pick 2 years ago to get Terry. This trade comes down to how bad the Hornets want to pair the Ball Brothers. There's other players / teams I'd target first before making a deal for Terry especially with the assumption that they are working on getting Lowry.
"Lonzo Ball, Zach Lavine, Luka Doncic.   This must happen. It is inedible."
I agree with that completely. I had not heard this information though so thats brand new to me! Im intrigued. Id take Lonzo too ngl if the ball family not pleased but then again they stacking around LaMelo already
"Am I getting worked up because I‚Äôm engaging you with words? Russ is a 3rd star, that‚Äôs good analysis!   And btw this entire thread started because someone was implying no one cares about the Bulls. And somehow a Laker fan gets triggered over it and then claims that in fact it‚Äôs the other person he replied to days after that is triggered. Lol.   Yo real shit, who is better; Lonzo Ball or Russ?"
"Yes he did, which is why I noted that he was rusty during that series at the end of my comment. However, the person I responded to acted as if Russ torched CP3 - when it is the opposite that occurred.  As far as the second half of your comment goes; Westbrook will put up inefficient numbers on a nightly basis during the regular season and amp the inefficiency up to 11 during the post season.   Why?   The three of them do not mix at all. Let's examine why.   LeBron is a god at driving to the rim a kicking it out to his teammates to get open looks. However, LeBron does not know how or does not care to do anything off ball, so he's useless when the ball isn't in his hands.   AD is a god in the post and a decent mid range shooter. He can work in iso down in the post but also in the Chris Bosh role of pick and popping.   Westbrook on the other hand is an inefficient chucker, who shoots worse than rookie Lonzo from the 3. Likewise he is out of control on his drives, and thus despite his athletic ability is wildly inefficient.   LeBron and Westbrook do not match each other. Both need the ball to be effective and both do nothing off the ball. Westbrook is generally speaking an absolutely terrible decision maker, so you would want LeBron to have the ball. However, teams will use this stack the paint which in turn will make Lebron's job harder as 3 out of his 5 starters can't shoot.   Westbrook and AD could somewhat match each other in theory, but the reality is that teams will solve this problem by simply playing zone. Westbrook is only a threat when he is at the hoop as he will likely brick the mid range, letting them go under the screen and beg him to shoot - which is a mistake as more often than not it'll be a brick.  We saw a similar problem with Capella, granted AD is a bit more of a rolling big. .  Consequently, if he is a starter he will be constantly out of place and will be unable to utilize it be utilized by his fellow superstar teammates."
We need a Lonzo Ball type :(
"Lonzo Ball, as per /r/nba"
"Talented players? Yes. A 3rd star? Not if it's another ball dominant scorer. Ball is not that, but I just don't think it's a fit in this situation. I agree 100% that the roster is not set as it currently stands though, so we'll see what Brad has in mind. If he really feels Lonzo is the guy, I'm VERY interested to see who gets cut loose. In my mind it would have to be Smart, but they seem very down on the idea of him not being on the team."
"What exactly has lead you to this conclusion? Kyrie certainly never had the keys in Cleveland, Lonzo and Rondo who are basically ONLY effective with the ball in their hands were forced to play off the ball too. I‚Äôd love to see Lebron completely off the ball but there‚Äôs zero reason to expect that in year 19."
I mean Lonzo ball was also fresh af
Lonzo Ball is actually worth that.
"That's why I'm saying it's bullshit. We just made the move to get out from under Kemba for ""financial flexibility"", so now we are gonna hard cap ourselves for Lonzo Ball? Does Lonzo make our roster better than any of the top 6? A backcourt of Lonzo and Marcus Smart is the key? I'm not sold on any of that, and I doubt the Celtics are either."
"Not re-signing Fournier would give us a backcourt of Lonzo Ball and Marcus Smart. TD Garden would sink into the earth with the amount of bricks being tossed around. Not only that, but I'll paste in something I wrote the other day about how critical it is for us to bring back Fournier:  * If we don't re-sign Fournier, then we literally wasted 2 2nds on 16 covid-limited games of Evan Fournier for no reason.  * If wasting 2 2nds doesn't bother you, then it also completely wastes the record TPE from Hayward, which we could have just saved for this offseason. We now only have slightly more than the MLE remaining, which will get us basically a MLE level player - Fournier is much better than that.  * Fournier ended the season with 17 PPG, making him the 4th best scorer on the team (3rd with Kemba gone). It can easily be argued that with a full season and increased role, he could replace Kemba's output by himself.  * Fournier is a natural off-ball 2 guard and has all the skills that come with that (cutting, quick decisions without needing to iso, quick shooting motion - all things we desperately need), and he shot 41% on 6.7 attempts from 3 last year which made him the best 3 point shooter on the roster.  * If we let Fournier walk, we will have essentially traded two 20 PPG scorers, capable of catching fire on any given night, for 35 year old Al Horford and...Josh Richardson? Reggie Bullock? Whoever it is, it's too much of an offensive drop off to handle.   Letting Fournier go would be a disastrous misfire and we have no real way to replace him."
Lonzo ball
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball for me. I still believe in him.
Lonzo Ball  I believe in him since High School He chose the Bulls and they have a groups of guys who fits very well with is playstyle
Lonzo ball
"Lonzo Ball, trea young and Jason Tatum"
"yeah lol lots of room for reasonable debate in the ‚Äúhow many mvps should he have won‚Äù conversation. the lonzo comparison is brutal to hear though. steve nash was one of the best pgs all-time at finishing craftily in the paint and was a pioneer in being a 3-pt threat off the dribble. Lonzo shoots his threes off the catch more often than not and his rim finishing has been a gaping hole in his game since he entered the league. love lonzo‚Äôs defense, unselfishness, and ball movement instincts, but he will never be half the player nash was impact wise and they‚Äôre not even similar player archetypes."
"Again Lonzo is more famous than talented, watch games of him on the Pelicans or even the Bulls next season to see my point. He was primarily a 3 and D player for the Pelicans for a reason.  The Lakers trade was centered around Ingram, if the Lakers wanted AD they had no choice but to trade Ingram. The Lakers could have fought to kept him if they really wanted to like they did for Kuzma but they had no interest in bringing Ball back.  Running a few a post up a game wouldn't kill the offense, you can run off ball screens to get players open on the perimeter, have players cut off ball, turn the post up into a pick n roll, or have Lonzo take advantage of his mismatch and score or draw a foul. It's not the 90's were you'll see a player post up 15 or so times a night but it's still has it's place along with the mid range game. You also don't have to be incredibly strong to post up, as long as his footwork is fine and takes advantage of every opening he'll be fine.  His handles are basic, you can say whatever you want but they're basic. Watch footage or watch him isolate from time to time and you'll see what I mean.  Lonzo gets most of assists in transaction, in the pick n roll he's not much of threat going downhill so that often leads to resets which is why he would often for stretches be used as a spot up shooter on offense. The Bulls might try to run him as the primary ball handler at first but long term, I doubt it. They'll probably want the ball in Zach or Demar's (was one of the best playmaker last season) hand more than Lonzo's. Both Zach and Demar ran the pick n roll more efficiently than Lonzo at a higher volume as well last season. He's not as good as you think he is and pretty much betting on his potential even though his game hasn't changed much, only his jumpshot.   Edit:  [Source for pick n roll stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/ball-handler/)"
"Nickeil Alexander-Walker.  Pelicans got rid of Lonzo Ball to start this guy. Three-level scorer, great driver, good playmaker and passer, tremendous hard-working defender. Has been turnover-prone and a little shot-happy, IMO because he's been trying to do too much in limited playing time.  Now that the Pelicans have cleared a starting space for him, and he doesn't have to force his game ‚Äì watch out."
"Lonzo Ball, Bagly, Turner, Collins, and Allen are not better than RJ."
"No one except maybe his super fans(and even that‚Äôs a stretch) act like that. By and large everyone that is high on Lonzo thinks he‚Äôs a promising playmaker that still has room to grow as long as he keeps developing and has a team that utilizes him right.  Your point about him getting traded is irrelevant to the discussion and borders on just finding things to nitpick about him. The trade was a win win for both teams. The Lakers wanted an established star to pair with Lebron, and the Pelicans wanted young productive players with high upside. The Lakers weren‚Äôt fighting to keep Ingram either, that‚Äôs not an indictment on either player‚Äôs worth. If anything that shows that they was valuable enough that the Lakers was able to get a top 10 player for them. And the Lakers wanted Lonzo back so obviously he did something rightü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.   You‚Äôre thinking like this is some YMCA league here. Just because he‚Äôs 6‚Äô7 that don‚Äôt mean he *has* to do postups, plus he‚Äôs pretty skinny for his height so it‚Äôs not like he can body a guy like Dame or Westbrook even if he tried. Obviously if there‚Äôs an egregious mismatch he should be able to exploit it but most coaches are just not gonna run a postup play for Lonzo. Postups slow down offenses, they eat up the shot clock, and depending on the personnel that‚Äôs on the floor they can mess with spacing. No team is gonna let Lonzo post up when they have at least two bigs on the floor that can do the same thing but way more effectively. Being able to postup is like one of the most insignificant things you should be concerned about with your PG.   As far as his handles are concerned I‚Äôm seeing a consistent theme of you having unrealistic expectations. Lonzo‚Äôs handles are pretty league average for PG standards. He can get to pretty much wherever he needs to on the court. That‚Äôs what most important. Anything more than that is a bonus. I‚Äôm sure if he played against lower competition or on a team that was less structured you‚Äôd have more appreciation for how good his handles really are.   For the last time, Pick n Rolls are a staple play of basketball. Idk where this weird argument of making it seem like being a PnR PG is a bad thing but damn near every PG that has played competitive basketball had run hundreds of them at one or another in their life. You‚Äôre knocking Lonzo for something that HOF players made their careers off of.   And sorry to burst your bubble but Lonzo is gonna be the primary ball handler. Zach plays offball when he has a playmaking PG and Demar is gonna be a SF/PF."
"If my 2k MyCareer is accurate, he'll be leading the Denver Nuggets to their first finals appearance in 2027, where he will lose in 7 games to a Bulls team with Lonzo Ball at PG."
"Lonzo Ball. He‚Äôs turned into an upper-middle-tier starting point guard which is great, but after Summer League I thought he‚Äôd be an All-Star right away, I was definitely on the hype train"
I think the Bulls have a clearly more talented roster on offense. 2 guys who were all stars last year and DeRozen who is a scorer above all else. You know Lonzo is going to have the ball in his hands a decent amount and I just don't think that leaves many touches for Williams.
"It's not BS he's a solid young PG in the NBA but people act like he's a multiple time all star. The Lakers weren't fighting to keep him when trading for AD for a reason. Hell, the Pelicans were trying to trade him at the trade deadline as well.  Lonzo is 6'6/6'7 he will always have the height advantage over other PG's which will draw the attention of the opposing teams defense. His vision and ability to pass can lead to wide open shots if they try to double or don't properly commit or it can lead to easy baskets for him so yes having a post game would do wonders for him.  His handles are basic, he doesn't have any shake and he's not crafty which is why he struggles to consistently get to the rim. He doesn't need to be Kyrie or Steph but that's an area that he needs to improve in along with absorbing contact and maybe free throws (I know that he shot 78% from the line last year but it's on low volume, 56% for his career)  Lonzo gets most of his assists in fast break situations the other is from pick n roll, with Zion the athletic freak that he is being one of his favorite targets. I doubt his game changes much on the Bulls when the ball will probably be in Zach and Demar's hands more than Lonzo's."
"Bigger, faster, more explosive, better iso scorer, better on ball defender, much better around the rim, better mid range jumper. His handle is about the same as Lonzo‚Äôs as well as Lonzo doesn‚Äôt have a great one"
"We also have enough talent to stagger them.  Lonzo complements Lavine.  Derozan and Vucevic seem like a very natural fit, almost like Derozan and LMA on steroids.  All will likely close games, in which case Demar is probably our best playmaker.  I can see Lavine getting the ball in those situations as well."
"Luka and LeBron are not even remotely close to Jordan in terms of playstyle. They can't shoot as well from midrange and depend on getting to the interior. Magic can't shoot,and Harden isn't the playmaker that Magic is. Harden doesn't have an old com because his playstyle is a product of era, shooting, small ball, and even flopping combined. I'd put Luka's comp as Harden even though Harden's not necessarily old, and LeBron as Malone x Magic. AD and Giannis are not even REMOTELY close to as skilled as Hakeem in the paint. Wilt could not shoot and didn't pass, and played exceptional defense, so he shares nothing in common with Jokic except position. I don't know how the fuck you put EWING for Embiid when he's explicitly stated that he started watching Hakeem and based his game around him, and even sat down and talked with Hakeem about it. Kawhi is imo the closest thing we have to Jordan today. Lockdown defender, three level scorer, and elevates it in the playoffs. I think Paul George was like T-Mac: explosive drives, high volume scoring and a little recession/misfortune in the playoffs. Westbrook is Penny because of his athleticism and passing ability. I don't watch Lonzo enough to form an opinion on him."
"I think Williams is better at basketball than Lonzo, yes.     Williams is a better defender. Lonzo isn‚Äôt really a great defender.  I know everyone talks about how great he is, defensively but he just isn‚Äôt a good on ball defender. He gets burned a lot. He‚Äôs good in passing lanes but he‚Äôs overrated as a defender.  Williams is a better shooter, he just didn‚Äôt shoot as much as Lonzo.   He still may not get the shot attempts Lonzo does, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he does.   Williams can also drive and create his own offense better than Lonzo, though that‚Äôs not saying much  Lonzo is a great fast break player, but that‚Äôs about it as far as facilitation goes."
"Yeah I think their pops killed the kids brand, I personally assumed that they'd come in and be ball hogs with the hype the dad was selling. They're the exact opposite though, they're both pass first points and LaMelo has some solid scoring ability. I think for the old heads, their pops killed their name for them. I'm not sure how the younger generation felt about them, Lonzo certainly gets a lot of hate on here even though he's got a solid game and has improved every year. Certainly hasn't lived up to the number two pick though."
Lonzo Ball: ~~Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical leap~~  Short Ben Simmons with a jumoshots üëç
No particular order   1. Luka Doncic  2. Zion Williamson  3. Brandon Ingram   4. Devin Booker  5. Jayson Tatum  6. LaMelo Ball  7. DeArron Fox  8. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   9. Jaylen Brown   10. Dejounte Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. Michael Porter  13. Deandre Ayton  14. Jamal Murray  15. Donavan Mitchell  16. Jarret Allen  17. Collin Sexton  18. Trae Young  19. Bam Adebayo  20. Ben Simmons  21. Anthony Edwards  22. John Collins  23. Myles Turner  24. Marvin Bagley   25. Lonzo Ball
"Young Lonzo vs Young Ben Simmons I thought it was a night and day comparison and Simmons was on his way to being the next super star and Ball a bust...then slowly Ball started actually improving! He got better at getting to the basket, he improved his FT and actually became a threat behind the 3 point line. Plus his defense was always solid...yet some how Simmons has regressed each year. Now I would honestly say Ball is the better overall player. Not something I saw at all at the beginning of the careers. Kudos to Ball to working hard...and Simmons just not working at all."
"By far the best of the Ball family, lamelo way better then lonzo"
"Legit. I didn't care about the the ball thing since I saw his high school ""60 point games"". I felt like he was just hyped to much.   Like how Lonzo was with "" Steph Curry and 40 inch vert"". But then I watched his NBL highlights and was like, huh, interesting.   Then I saw his NBA games and was impressed. He has all, swag, flair, daring. I like his game."
Not even close. Lonzo defense and his play making ability out weigh him shooting a 3 ball. Ball alone  was already going to help the Bulls get into the playoffs or atleast be around the play in. Demar coming to the bulls is icing on the cake.
Demar is a much better player than lonzo and will have the ball in his hands so easy choice.
I think they will likely share ball handling duties. I don't see how they bring Lonzo in for 20 million to be a 3 and D player who can't make layups
"He hits unrestricted free agency in a year, and they just blew a bunch of first round picks, their defensive heart and soul (Thad Young), and $50m/year to add ball stoppers who don't play defense in DeRozan and Vucevic.   Will be interesting to see how it all works out. Love the Lonzo-LaVine fit and the Caruso signing."
Lonzo Ball most improved Lavine all nba first team book it
"Draymond is an incredibly unique situation. Almost every comparison to Draymond ever made is complete folly.  Not only because of he himself but because he plays with the best off-ball creator of all time, probably by some margin. Unless Lonzo is going to post up and have Lavine and Derozan run post splits then I don‚Äôt think the comparison works. And I don‚Äôt see how that is a viable configuration for the Bulls."
"Someone like Lonzo can be a good playmaker tho, you don't necessarily need shot creation to make plays. Someone like Draymond is a good example, he just reads the defense very well and sends the ball where it needs to go when Curry/Klay do their thing. I think Lonzo will be fine as a halfcourt ball handler in Chicago. They have loads of offensive talent who can play off ball."
They're similar but not the exact same.  Prime example is Lonzo Ball.   &amp;#x200B;  Lonzo Ball is probably a top 5 passer in the league but his playmaking especially in the half court setting can be lacking.
"Pretty sure Demar is gonna be the defacto PG and Lonzo will still be off ball a lot, so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs it really"
"The Pelicans turned one of LeBron's rejects, Brandon Ingram, immediately into an All-Star and the Most Improved Player in the league.  They turned another LeBron reject, Lonzo Ball, from a .315 three-point shooter into a .376 three-point shooter (without which Ball would have had to sign for the free-agent minimum).  And Zion Williamson has certainly blossomed very quickly into a far more well-rounded player than almost anyone else in the league expected.  The current Pelicans front office knows what they're doing."
"I'm not alone on this issue. I'm in pretty good company, in fact. My analysis of Lonzo Ball is exactly the same as the Pelicans' front office.  As well as LeBron James."
"Eh I don't think that the last part of your post is necessarily true  Lonzo/Lamelo haven't really been involved in that much drama themselves, it's just the Ball name"
"In 2021 does Compton mean anything anymore, seriously?  Does Demar DeRozan?.  Does Lonzo Ball?"
"Not like LAL can develop talent to save their lives anyway...  Outside of Caruso, and *maybe* KCP, what players drafted by the Lakers have actually blossomed there?  Julius Randle - After leaving LA, he gets huge MIP noise, and even some MVP discussion after leading NYK back to the Playoffs.  D'Angelo Russell - After leaving LA, he becomes one of the centerpieces of a young Brooklyn team that made it back to the Playoffs after a decent absence.  Jordan Clarkson - After leaving LA, he wins 6MOTY on UTAH, is instrumental in putting The Jazz in the position to make the (admittedly disappointing) post-season run they did.  Lonzo Ball - Has greatly improved his shooting to become one of the more coveted 3&amp;D guys on the market (4yrs, 85mil coveted).  Brandon Ingram - Turns into KD-lite, shows flashes on Tatum-level ability. Very impressive young guy.  Point is, even without Lebron not allowing some of these guys the chance to grow, which of them were even likely to grow when The Lakers talent development is such booty?  Leaving the team seems to have worked out better for many of them in terms of improving their individual game."
Liangelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Lamelo Ball
"Of course he won't, what the hell?  There is Lonzo Ball and Coby White ahead of him for the PG position while SG is locked by Lavine. He'll most likely come from the bench as a PG with Coby finally being SG. But he is a great defender and playmaker off the bench and he can make points when needed."
"Yep, Lonzo is the best off-ball passer in the league. And this phrase only makes sense if you watched Lonzo lol"
Lonzo Jeffrey Ball
With the way people are talking about these summer league players you‚Äôd think Lonzo Ball would‚Äôve been MVP by now.
"Lonzo ""Josh Christopher"" Ball"
"In addition to DeRozan this roster has LaVine, Vuc, Lonzo, Coby and Caruso. There's more than enough ball handlers to take the pressure off any one guy in the half court"
"Chicago is going to have 3 starters with experience as a main playmaker, plus Vuc, and then Coby and Caruso off the bench. Lonzo will have the ball in his hands since, but he's not going to be running the offense for long stretches."
"He can get his own shot while taking care of the ball. When he's forced to be the team's primary facilitator he is extremely TO prone, and he has a habit of coughing it up trying to do too much at critical moments.  It's admirable that he wants to put the team on his back, but adding guys like DeRozan, Vuc and Lonzo can only help him become a more efficient playmaker."
"It should 100 percent be more nuanced than just one ball handler 100% of the time. What team even does this. I imagine we roll strong with Lonzo full court ball handler and DDR half court, but even this not 100% of the time."
"&gt;Ehh that bench is thin. They unlike most teams can't survive an injury. Like outside of Caruso no one on that roster can step up. God forbid Vuc misses time because then they are even more screwed  Caruso is a starting quality guard coming off the bench. Coby started 54 games last year and is a good microwave scorer. Lauri has 3.5 years starting experience and Bradley filled in so well in the absence of Embiid and Dwight that the Bulls immediately traded away their entire center rotation.  I think the bench will be just fine.  As for DeRozan, he's a highly efficient playmaker who takes care of the ball. LaVine, Lonzo, Vuc and Williams are all plus three point shooters. Chicago might have some problems, but spacing won't be one of them."
He will for sure. Lavine will be amazing off ball with this team. Can't wait to see Derozan ball handling giving it off to Lonzo for a quick pass to either vooch for a 3 or a cutting lavine.   Lonzo will still be great for his passing but until his handles get better Demar should def be the main ball handler. Lonzo can be the guy to make snap decisions while Demar slows the game down.
"I was gonna say, Lonzo grew up in Compton? I was under the assumption the Ball family was pretty well off during their childhood.  edit: I read it wrong, he's just talking about LA in general"

They did try but the offense was better when Zion or BI were the main ball handlers. Lonzo can‚Äôt run an  offense in the half court
"[https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lonzo-ball-stats-after-the-all-star-break-2021](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/lonzo-ball-stats-after-the-all-star-break-2021)  This is not playing his true position as a Point Guard. The ball was in Zion, and BI's hands way more. With more Pick and rolls lead by Zo. Assist numbers will go up. And you can't really accurately assess Zo's driving game, because the Pelicans had no outside shooters last season. Their spacing was fucking awful"
"S&amp;T's aren't offer sheets, so they couldn't actually match the Bulls offer.  What would have happened is the Pelicans say no to working with the Bulls on a S&amp;T.  So the Bulls get the hint and don't bother extending an offer sheet to Lonzo.  Pel's have nothing to match, but Lonzo also has nothing to sign.  So now everyone's just angry and hard ball negotiations start.  &amp;#x200B;  You might be thinking that the Bulls take a chance, get creative with the contract and give Lonzo an offer anyways.  Except, they can't give him a big offer without clearing cap (the entire reason they wanted to S&amp;T anyways).  So they probably aren't going to give an offer Lonzo wants anyways.  And if Lonzo doesn't sign... then the Pels again, have nothing to match."
Klay is one of the top 3 shooters ever and is elite moving off ball and catching in weird positions and angles and getting off efficient shots. He‚Äôs also above average to elite on defense. Lonzo otoh is elite at transition decision making and pretty much average to slightly above average at everything else. If he got his handle or finishing to a level nearing elite he‚Äôd be an allstar. As is he‚Äôs an above average role player.
As a pelicans fan we need to quit throwing out lies on Lonzo.   He said he wanted to stay. The GM said Lonzo wanted to stay. His teammates wanted him back.   The pelicans knew the going rate for Lonzo would be 4 yrs 20 mil. We didn't want to pay which is fine but don't lie and say Lonzo didn't want to be here. If we gave him what he thought he was worth then he would still be in our uniform.   And to the people saying that his camp leaked stuff to get leverage for Chicago... who gives a fuck. Lonzo didn't complain when we threw his name in trade scenarios mid-season to the same team.   Good luck to Lonzo Ball.
"I have watched every second Lonzo Ball ever played in a Pelicans uniform, including preseason.  You?  And I spent every one of those seconds hoping for him to do well.  P.S. Did you notice the Pelicans miserably failed to make the playoffs the last two years - despite having an All-Star each season?  Did you ever wonder why they underperformed? You gonna blame it on their All-Stars?  Or maybe the guy who led the team in touches might have had something to do with it ..."
"Dead wrong - I'm overjoyed that Lonzo Ball is off the Pelicans. That was my only goal for the offseason - to please, please, please get Ball off the roster of one of the two NBA teams I care about.  Unfortunately, he went to the other one. :("
"He got a big contract from a team that has staked its future on empty-stats losers like Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan. Plus Lonzo Ball, who doesn't even have the empty stats.  Believe me, the sadness is real. I'm from Chicago and I care about the Bulls as much as the Pelicans. This offseason I was overjoyed at the thought of the Pels getting rid of Ball so their good young guards would get to play.  But then Ball went to the other team I care about. Major bummer."
"They treat Lonzo like Jesus himself, they'll get mad if Lavine has the ball more often than Lonzo and he's not in a cp3 type role."
"Zach is actually very good off ball and will be okay with less touches.  I also think they‚Äôll probably stagger DeRozan and Vucevic to play with the bench more.  They‚Äôre the oldest on the starting lineup so I think they‚Äôll generally get subbed first.  Lonzo‚Äôs big and Donovan loves his 3 guard lineups so I think we‚Äôll see a lot of Caruso, Lavine, Lonzo, or Coby, Lavine, Lonzo lineups and either one of those can run and gun."
"Lonzo Ball played two years in New Orleans. His first coach, Alvin Gentry, played Ball at point and let him play ""his way."" Ball was so terrible at everything but shooting open 3s that in year two Stan Van Gundy wisely pared down his role to the microscopic set of things he can do positively in an NBA game. This caused   a) Ball to have the best year of his career  b) people who didn't watch Ball play to assume the Pelicans were ""limiting"" him (rather than hiding his glaring deficiencies)  If you want a catch-and-shoot wing who can make shots as long as he has three full seconds to load and shoot, and a defender who can stay with his man as long as he is never, ever screened - and who absolutely cannot do anything else in an NBA game -  then Lonzo Ball's your guy.  But if you want a real NBA player, Ball only gives sadness."

"It seems the league just isn't high on Lonzo. Bulls have struggled to get big free agents and after taking a risk on Lavine, Zo story is similar so it seems like a good risk for them. Worst case keep the ball in Derozan and Zach hand and let Lonzo play the role he did here."
"As opposed to Lonzo Ball and Eric Bledsoe, which was the worst backcourt in the West..."
"nah i dont think you watch lonzo play...he doesnt break down defenses off the dribble or play heavily in pick and roll...hes not the type of point guard...his assists in the half court are more the stationary type, in transition obv hes a one...but in the half court offense derozan will get more ball screens than Zo will...even at ucla he didnt play lke that"
"I don‚Äôt think Lonzo having the ball in his hands a bunch is the best way for a team to use him. You‚Äôre right that he should believe in his abilities, and it would do him well to get on ball reps occasionally. But he‚Äôs a 3&amp;D player right now."
"I don't really pay much attention to the narratives surrounding the ""characters"" of players, because I'm of the opinion that fans don't know and will never see the inner-machinations of a locker room, but Lonzo seems like one of those guys that is very much interested in winning above all else. Can't wait for the season to start. Love that he and his brothers have distanced themselves from the Lavar Ball circus, as entertaining as that was."
Even before zion became the primary ball handler lonzo wasn't really playing point. He had the ball in his hands sporadically.
I can‚Äôt imagine a world where Lonzo is creating and Lavine is off ball
Lonzo ball is fucking garbage and didn‚Äôt want to be in NOLA.
"I don't think you want Lonzo handling the ball as much or in the same way that CP3 does, lol"
"This is what frustrates me to no end about this off-season. It was clear all season that the Pels would not match a big offer for Lonzo. They obviously didn't see them as a cornerstone piece. You can disagree with that assessment, but that is what the team felt. Now, let me say that I really like Lonzo Ball. I think he is a very good player and I hope he continues to blossom in Chicago and is eventually an All-Star. But it's so frustrating to see everyone, most of them having watched ZERO Pels games last year, post about how they can't believe we let Lonzo go. The truth is that Lonzo is a very inconsistent player. For every great shooting night he had last year there were two games where he couldn't get more than 8 points. You still can't trust him to convert at the free throw line. His defense is highly overrated and he just simply wasnt a good defender here. He also is kind of a combo guard. He isn't going to to be a floor general point guard but also is kind of a limited shooting guard. I'm sure people will disagree and that's fine. I watched the games. That isn't someone who I would pay a huge contract to, especially because ""who else are they going to get"" is the best reason people can come up with."
"I think the real question is: can guards even be role players on elite teams anymore? One can argue that the guard position is so valuable in the modern NBA that having a non-star play PG is too much opportunity cost. Especially one that's making 20 million a year. And if Lonzo is playing next to a superstar guard, then is Lonzo really the best player to have off-ball?"
"Jrue and Lowry are nowhere near the exact same type of player beyond both being guards and good defenders. First, as much as I love Jrue, Lowry is better. Second, Jrue is a combo guard who can play the point but isn‚Äôt a natural point guard while Lowry is more of a pure point guard. Third, their leadership styles are incredibly different: Lowry is a far more vocal leader on and off the court than Jrue ever was.  If you think Lonzo is 1. a guard and 2. can facilitate on the court outside of transition you have not watched the Pelicans for the past two years. The only thing he was ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù at was shooting open 3s. He still can‚Äôt drive to the rim and he can‚Äôt initiate an offense. His athleticism is useless because he doesn‚Äôt use it to bully people, get to the rim, or make plays. His on-ball defense is overrated because he can‚Äôt fight through screens, although he‚Äôs very good at reading passing lanes. I promise that Lonzo isn‚Äôt as good as people think he is.  It‚Äôs also wrong to view Graham as the Lonzo replacement. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the Lonzo replacement; Graham is the Bledsoe replacement"
I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs his fault as much as it was a personnel problem. SVG kept playing a lineup with Lonzo and Bledsoe. Bledsoe was terrible but he was the one that got to play point when the ball wasn‚Äôt in BI or Zion‚Äôs hands which I think was a huge mistake. Bledsoe was hands down one of the worst players on offense in all of the nba last year and instead of being benched he kept playing 25-30 mins a night while Lonzo was relegated to spot up shooter in the half court. I really would have liked to see how Lonzo could play without Bledsoe clogging the offense
"Ya that‚Äôs the worst part it seemed like Ball could do so much more but the team was a personnel nightmare last year. They would play with with Bledsoe, BI, and Zion yet somehow Stan had the audacity to make Lonzo a spot up shooter in the halfcourt while letting garbage ass Bledsoe run the point. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Lonzos fault he didn‚Äôt get to contribute as much especially with how great he is in the open court"
I think Graham and ball are both good players and it takes a great player to really make a difference. Lonzo doesn't move the needle enough for me offensively
"If you need someone with the ball in his hand, you‚Äôd prefer Lonzo. But BI or Zion need to be handling the ball on offensive possessions, and Graham/Satoransky are better from a spacing standpoint. Lonzo‚Äôs improved as a 3 point shooter, but he‚Äôs not consistent enough for 4/85."
"Unless you're a new fan, there's no way that's the worst attempt you've seen. Lonzo Ball had a possession where he missed 3 straight point-blank layups. Lonzo Ball was drafted second overall."
"Yes I am aware of that, but so did countless other NBA players. I've never discredited their work ethic, but to see people rally and feel inspired by the Ball brothers is still baffling to me because let's be honest. Without Lavar and his antics (made possible by his wealth), Lonzo wouldn't have been picked that high and no one would've known who Gelo is. Lamelo is the exception here.   And to your point, the Paul brothers actually do train rigorously once they committed to boxing. But their fans are actual 10 year olds I don't see any grown adult cheering for them unironically."
Lonzo Ball is going to be a late bloomer and go down as a legendary point guard.
"Lebron has surprised me by not relying too much on his athleticism later in his career. But I have eyes, and you‚Äôre acting like he wasn‚Äôt already the PG in 2018 when our other option was Lonzo Ball"
"I'll admit I was convinced it was for the Lonzo Ball joke until I got to Draymond. Since I was convinced I had already seen the punchline, it got me good."
You missed the playoffs for 7 straight seasons bc you're an incompetent franchise that plays the league on easy mode. Had to be saved by the face of the league (and still couldn't make the playoffs with your great draft picks). If you're such genius drafters maybe you should've drafted Tatum over Lonzo fucking Ball.
Lonzo Ball is HELLA overrated too. Dude is a good backup PG at best
"If Lonzo Ball can turn himself into an average to above average 3pt shooter, nobody has any excuse why they at least can't shoot 34-35% from deep"
We have 3 guys who have been all stars within the last 3 years that's why there's hype  Literally nobody is arguing that Lonzo Ball is a top 30 player
"maybe because people don't understand how words work, but how many fans if they sat down and thought about it would say he's better than at least 4 guys on this list:  Steph  Dame  Doncic  Kyrie (or Harden)  Chris Paul  Trae Young  Jamal Murray  Jrue Holiday  Conley  Lowry  Ben Simmons  Russell Westbrook  De'Aaron Fox  Brogdon  Sexton  Lamelo Ball  Lonzo Ball  Ja Morant  I think he is definitely worse than all of these guys, and he would need to be better than three of them to even be ""average""."
"I seriously dont get the Bulls hype. They added a declining DeRozan and Lonzo Ball. Like Lonzo is nice, but c'mon. He isnt a top 30 player."
"Forget about ""mentioning things"". He should be doing specialized routines to combat his particular weaknesses. That's what top players do. They do extra, specialized work.  MJ, Bron, and Kobe didn't/don't just ""go to practice"". They would spend their own money on specialized professionals to get any kind of margin of advantage.  \- Lebron does yoga and doesn't care what anyone else thinks about it (maybe why he rarely got injured until recently?).  \- Bron and Kobe trained with Hakeem and USED what they learned. Bron was not a post player prior to training with Olajuwon, but after that summer the post became a big part of his game.  \- Bron experimented with his jumper over the years and used various shooting coaches and fellow players for assistance. MJ and Kobe would drag their shooting coaches out of bed at 3 AM.  \- All 3 wake up crazy early to practice and use what they practice (e.g. MJ perfecting the fadeaway J, Kobe mastering his footwork, Lebron adding a decent side-step 3-pointer to his arsenal).  \- And let's not forget guys like Kawhi and Larry Bird who transformed themselves into complete offensive players, or Karl Malone who overcame his FT woes. Or even Lonzo Ball who gets better every year.  Ben and his coaches/trainers need to recognize that they need to confront the issue head-on. There's no shame in that, and there should be no fear of failure either. You literally cannot get worse than where Simmons is right now. He's so bad, that being a ""bad shooter"" would be a huuuge step up from where he is right now. I wish he were a ""bad shooter"" like Westbrook. Lol."
Lonzo Ball is overrated and doesn‚Äôt have the handle to be an elite playmaker or shot creator in this league despite his size
"38% from three on 8 per game is more than decent. I was a huge lonzo knocker and a Ball family hater in general, but Zo has come a long way. I‚Äôd like to see if last year‚Äôs shooting was an anomaly or not."
He improve his shooting in 2 years he hasn't improved his ball handling and driving at all. To put into context Graham is 5'11 Lonzo is 6'6 and Lonzo is only slightly better at scoring efficiency at the the rim and Graham is one of the worst in the league.
Lonzo Ball will be an All-Star
Summer League Lonzo Ball was something special. They atmosphere in the building was crazy anytime he played or touched the ball. Those full court passes on a dime were hype! It was a show to watch! That whole Lakers squad was special.
THE LONZO BALL DISCUSSION UNCUT!!! ://youtu.be/\_JD6iXPPlMM
How does adding Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball make this team that much better. They jump from the 11th to the 7th seed.
MVP: Trae Young  MIP: Lonzo Ball  6MOY: Carmelo Anthony  ROY: Jalen Green
"No, there absolutely is not.  In terms of hype in regards to actual basketball, the Ball bros came nowhere close to the hype of Lebron.  No one was hyping them as the next GOAT.  If social media was a thing in 2002, Lebron's IG followers would be just as crazy, that's an absolutely absurd argument to make.  Lebron's hype vastly exceeded that of Lonzo and Lamelo.  Like it's not even a discussion, dude."
there isn't at all. Lebrons era was before smartphones and internet becoming essential.  0 argument. Nobody outside basketball cared or knew about Lonzo Ball. Lebron was a phenomenon
"Lonzo Ball. I disliked him because his jump shot was garbage, but after seeing his improvement, I‚Äôve grown to respect him."
Lonzo Ball has a better 3-point percentage than MJ.
"Lonzo Ball. His dad was annoying and I hoped he‚Äôd be a bust, but he seems to be one of the most promising young players in the NBA right now"
"Lonzo Ball!  Man his whole family just rubbed me the wrong way. They all seemed like spoiled, entitled, cocky little brats. His dumbass dad. His brother getting caught stealing in China. It was all just so bad.  BUT ever since his move to NO, he‚Äôd been working hard. Improving his game. Distanced himself a bit from the brand. And now I wish him nothing but the best with the bulls."
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
"Wolves are the only team of the three I think is clearly better this year than last, and that's mostly because I think Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid are good and getting better rapidly.  If Malik Beasley, D'Angelo Russell and Patrick Beverley play 65 games or more apiece, the Wolves will be saying something.  And let me also say Malik Beasley's shooting fits around Ben Simmons better than Anthony Edwards.  If the Wolves put four above average 3pt shooters like KAT, Russell, Beverly and Beasley around Ben Simmons, its bombs away!    Sacramento, meh.  I like Davion Mitchell, but dont understand how four guards (mitchell, fox, haliburton, hield) are going to make that much of a difference on defense when you're still relying on Barnes, Bagley and Holmes in the front court.    David Griffen should be arrested for what he's doing to the Pelicans.  What the hell do they have to show for trading away Jrue Holiday and the Lonzo Ball?  Totally unexcited about Kira Lewis, Alexander Walker.   Zion Williamson needs to play with a big who can stretch the floor, and the Pelicans got Steven Adams last year, and Jonas Valenciunas this year?  Trey Murphy was a good pick.  That's about it.  Got lucky there, because the Wizards were smoking crack when they let him slide past."
&gt; able to just be a facilitator  He's not an especially good facilitator though because he can't or won't get into the paint. He has no ability to collapse defenses and create plays. Not sure how that would work with a bunch of iso scorers for a coach that doesn't really focus on a system that emphasizes off ball movement. I think Lonzo will play an almost identical role because he's objectively bad in the halfcourt. I think we'll see a lot of him running the break and a lot of catch and shoot in the halfcourt because that's really all he can do.
"His stats are far above average. 14.6/4.8/5.7 with 1.5 steals is very respectable and the list of players who average his statline or better is:  1.	Jimmy Butler 2.	LaMelo Ball  And that's the whole list. Obviously it's very selective to include all of those stats, but it helps to illustrate that Lonzo provides good stuff all around - solid rebounder, good passer, good defender (steals don't precisely correlate to defense bit they are still valuable), and can hit threes. It's not a super common skillset."
Are we not going to address how Charles Barkley called BI and Lonzo Ball trash?
"That isn't going to happen.  This Bulls team was tailored to Lonzo.  He believes that he is capable of being the primary ball handler for his team.  He wasn't given ample opportunity to do so in NOLA, and was vocal about the fact that he disagreed with SVGs decision  They are going to give him massive opportunities to be the de facto ball handler/PG in Chicago.  He wasn't brought in to be a 3&amp;D guy"
&gt;High level talents/ &gt; Lonzo Ball  wat
I can see why some would say Jaylen Brown is better but it is not as one sided as you make it sound.  Lonzo Ball is not mediocre.  He is at the least a good player at his position especially after he fixed his shooting.  Josh Hart is a solid role player who does his job.  I think it was the best package available.  That being said it is almost impossible to get a fair compensation for a top 5-10 player without include another top player.
"That analogy is completely way out there. AD wanted out of New Orleans because they were wasting his prime years. He gave them heads up of where he wanted to go and where he didn‚Äôt want to go. He wanted to play ball for the Pelicans but the Pelicans insisted on benching him so he didn‚Äôt get injured and tank his trade value. Pels trade AD to the Lakers, they get a great return. They now make dumb moves like trading away Jrue Holiday, acquiring Eric Bledsoe or sign Steven Adams for a long term contract, or fail to re-sign Lonzo. Now Zion isn‚Äôt pleased and we‚Äôre close to square one,"
"Yeah I definitely agree. I assume he‚Äôll be handling the ball a bit more with Lonzo gone, I‚Äôm interested to see if he can take that next step"
"He just doesn't DO anything unfortunately. Good defense, but he's like Lonzo Ball with even less offensive game."
so we‚Äôre just talking about name recognition now? lonzo ball is a bigger household name than lma for that matter
"&gt; Lou Williams has had a much, much better career than Caruso. He‚Äôs 34 now, of course a dropoff was coming lol. Remind me who averaged 23 a game as a sixth man on the Clips? I get PPG isn‚Äôt everything but Caruso topped out at uhh‚Ä¶ 6 a game.  Cool. We were talking about who'd be better in the 2020 playoffs and Caruso provided elite defense, elite off-ball cutting/screening, pushed the pace in transition and just straight up helped the team.  Lou, as he literally has in every playoffs of his career except 2019, disappeared in the playoffs, shot an abysmal % from everywhere, was hunted defensively whenever he touched the hardwood, and provided nothing off-ball.   Every impact stat already had Caruso as the better player but this sub refused to admit it.  &gt; Lonzo is a bust. He‚Äôs not playing like a #2 pick, nor has he ever. He‚Äôs not bad but he‚Äôs extremely flawed at the same time.  Incorrect. People massively overrate the value of draft picks. Lonzo is an above average no2 pick.  &gt; Don‚Äôt ever remember Ingram getting called overrated. Everyone said he could be KD-lite if he got a bit less skinny and developed a bit more.  In his first 2 seasons in the league, the most upvoted comment about Ingram I've ever seen was ""challenge : explain to me the difference between Brandon Ingram and Travis Outlaw"". Every reply was along the lines of ""damn, I actually can't"" and other shit like that. You'd have gotten downvoted to hell and back for calling him a future All-Star, especially during his rookie year.  &gt; As for the other three, fully disagree with you on all counts. People thought Clarkson could be decent, which he is, people thought DLo would be better on another team with room to shine, which he was, and people thought Randle could improve if he lost his tunnel vision, which he did.  People called Clarkson an overrated inefficient chucker, definitely didn't say D-Lo would shine elsewhere, and Randle did lose his tunnel vision his last year in LA but nobody would accept it.  &gt; You‚Äôre proving me right with this comment  Ironic, you're proving me right. I guarantee you in 2 years if THT is a fringe All-Star, all we'll see on this sub is ""lmao Lakers fans and their victim complex. Everyone knew THT would be an All-Star if he cleaned up his jumper a bit""."
"i think the pels would trade zion before the celtics would trade tatum. yes, you can easily argue that zion has a higher ceiling but tatum has proven himself in boston and they've already built around him, whereas they basically just got rid of zion's most useful teammate in lonzo ball.   (by useful i don't mean best, i just mean that zo and zion worked better together than BI and zion)"
"""Young"" = Under 24 years old for me, so I'll say De'Aron Fox, Aleksej Poku≈°evski, and Lonzo Ball."
"I‚Äôd honestly never realized how much Simmons is just Lonzo Ball but more so before. Big, long point guard that plays good defense. Good playmaker in transition but less so in the half court. Turns down open shots in favor of passing. Dicey free throw shooting. Honestly the biggest knock to that comparison is that Lonzo‚Äôs three ball exists."
"I mean, good transition offense is basically invaluable in the league, so it‚Äôs not really right to bring that up as something you can dismiss as only a minor positive attribute. His half court game is to catch and shoot and to cut and drive to the rim. Lavine and DeRozan can run the offense in the half court. Lonzo is getting paid a premium for his defense, transition playmaking, and his shooting/off-ball activity."
"Ben Simmons situation reminds me of Lonzo Ball's with the Lakers. The Lakers wanted to win now and moved him which was not a reflection of his skill set. I see the same situation with Simmons. I think he needs to get to a place where he is the right fit. Unfortunately with the way the NBA is becoming a ""Win Now at all cost"" league I don't know that we'll get to see most players develop before they are regulated to ""Journey Men."" I do think the different with Ball &amp; Simmons is that having a ""pass first"" point guard is hard to come by nowadays. Also the point guard position is very valuable as you just saw this past finals with Paul and Holiday. Those 2 were the corner pieces for both franchises getting to the next level. I think a good fit for him development wise would be the Spurs and their legendary coaching staff."
"RJ Barrett. From the Knicks game I watched last season, his ceiling seems like a good 3 &amp; D wing who struggles with self-creation in the half court. I don‚Äôt really see any all star bids in his future because young prospects just don‚Äôt magically develop a handle or new found athleticism overnight. If he turns out like Lonzo Ball, that‚Äôs a good high-end outcome."
Yes yall are all wrong  I knew this sub went off the deep end when a Lonzo Ball vs Ben Simmons post was made lmao
"It‚Äôs a small thing. but I‚Äôd say Lonzo is a better passer, too. Given that he isn‚Äôt somebody who always has the ball in his hands, he gets a bunch of assists.   Ben is a great passer too, but a lot of his assists are because of how much attention he demands when attacking the rim, whereas Lonzo‚Äôs assists have less to do with the defense reacting to him and more to do with his elite basketball IQ and passing.   You could argue that Ben forcing the defense to react to his threat at the rim is more valuable, but as a pure passer, I prefer Lonzo."
"Agreed, Lonzo doesn't get to the rim (and therefore foul line) much.  Still, he can at least provide spacing and handle the ball in crunch time without fear of getting hacked and missing freethrows."
Demar is gonna be way more helpful in that regard than Lonzo. You really do not want Lonzo being your ball handler
"I think Simmons is a better player but he's a really really bad fit on some teams like the Bucks and their offense. He doesn't fit since he can't spread the floor for Giannis and he wouldn't be as effective as the main ball handler as Jrue or Khris; we'd be parking him in the dunker's spot on most halfcourt possessions, where he clogs the lane but isn't going to be catching lobs or doing drop steps if he gets a dumpdown.  I'd rather just have Lonzo, who fits really well as the starting 2 guard. Most other teams should take Simmons since they don't have the unique challenge of trying to make everyone fit around their poor-shooting superstar like the Bucks."
"Lonzo Ball, good 3pt shooter, can be a great secondary playmaker. He's a player that fits on any team"
Its the same as lonzo ball we want people to be 20pt scorers so badly meanwhile they can play the game at an extremely high level when they play the game they want to - defensive and playmaking minded. Don‚Äôt forget simmons was a dpoy candidate this year along with harris and embiid scoring 20+ ppg
"Choked one time? His offensive game has actually regressed since his rookie year. That's nearly four years with no discernable improvement on offense. That doesn't happen if you're putting in the work. The guy doesn't care about winning or being great at all and we're tired of it.  Lonzo Ball had similar talents and similar flaws in his game compared to Ben, and he actually worked on his offensive game."
"Lonzo Ball  Norman Powell   LeBron James  Kyle Anderson   Kelly Olynyk   Bench: Satoransky, Nance Jr, Garrison Matthews   I think they could beat a lot of championship teams but idk about the Warriors. If you add Embiid though, different story."
"Lonzo Ball as well.  Worked tirelessly on his shooting form / jump shot and I think he made great strides.  We‚Äôll likely see even more improvement from him, a true baller that wants to improve his game.  Unlike Ben Simmons. A baller that has plateaued years ago but doesn‚Äôt care to get better."
Ben Simmons and Lonzo Ball are ahead of Booker. So this is crap   edit: Also Jakob Poeltl is ahead of Bam. So yeah. . . .
"You can get a Kuzma contract and a ring or an Ingram contract and no ring. I rather have the racks, opportunity, and a team who had a more extended history than what you did for me in the playoffs.    I think Simmons is getting a raw deal. Harrison Barnes still got a big-money contract after stinking it up on golden state the last few series.   Lonzo ball was also a scrub because he couldn't shot. Boy can shoot now.   What caused this was Doc‚Äôs insecurities of not being a good coach and leaving the podium early.   That being said, that will be a fun team to watch in Minnesota!"
Ben Simmons is as bad as lonzo ball but doesn‚Äôt have the obnoxious dad. He was pure hype and somehow robbed philly. Both team and player deserve this but there‚Äôs no reason to be a simmons fan.
Lonzo Ball
"RPM is completely broken since ESPN revamped it two seasons ago.   Jordan Poole and Lonzo Ball being ahead of Jokic in ORPM is hilarious, as are Joe Harris and Duncan Robinson being top 10 in DRPM. It's embarrassing for ESPN to continue publishing it.  The other advanced stats had him averagish in 2021: +0.1 in EPM, +0.4 in LEBRON, -0.6 in RAPTOR."
Lonzo Ball
"He has major flaws but lots of talent. If he would play more aggressive and use his size like he sometimes does, that could outweigh his poor ft shooting. Also would help to improve on ft % some. But when he puts his head down and attacks, he's effective. Alot of it is mental, kind of like lonzo ball. I think he'd have a better chance starting fresh somewhere else"
"idk why all these websites are so down on the Demar signing tbh. This is probably the best situation he's been in spacing wise considering Lonzo, Zach, Pat Will, and Vuc can all shoot the 3 so he has plenty of spacing, and Demar has shown significant development as a playmaker during his time with the Spurs.   Furthermore, with this whole there's only one ball shit it's like Lonzo can play offball, Zach showed during the olympics that he can play offball, Pat Will doesn't demand a lot of touches so it's not like you have 5 ball dominant guys who need the ball in their hand.   idk what grade the Bulls deserve but I just don't agree with their criticism of the Demar signing"
Am I the only who thinks is absolutely insane that the Blazers trade any package for Simmons? Simmons is no where near the caliber of player as Lillard. Simmons is on the Lonzo Ball scale of player who walked in free agency! In fact Lonzo Ball is a better player. This is insane to think that you put together any package for Lillard...
"Man roleplayers are getting hella overpaid this season, AG 22 mils per year, THJ close to 20, Lonzo Ball 22."
"People are *way* too invested in the concept of a ""pass-first point guard"". There's really no such thing anymore, players like Ricky Rubio or Lonzo Ball *just aren't very good playmakers* because of their inability to create their own shot."
"Draymond put up 32/15/9 in the NBA finals on 6/8 from 3. He made more 3s in that game than Simmons has since he entered the league. Not to mention Draymond being a true DPOY and able to have a useful role in a half court offence rather than standing in the dunkers spot and forcing your MVP level centre to take jumpers.   Draymond that year had MVP level impact and could get it done on both ends of the floor and more importantly he stepped it up in the playoffs rather than disappearing. Simmons is like fucking taller Lonzo Ball without a 3pt shot, not PRIME Draymond."
Smush Parker and Chris Mihm being starters.    Drafting Lonzo Ball over Tatum üò≠
Lonzo Ball beside himself
I stopped reading on Bulls arriving to conference Finals.   Now Lonzo ball is the new Jordan
"Lonzo Ball, I stilll have hope..."
"I'm bored so I'll go for a crazy one. Lonzo Ball.  During his 1st and 2nd year with the Lakers, especially his first year he played the most free I've seen him play until now. He was running and passing.   Now his issue back then was his shot was horrible. If he plays with the hm.. let's say same type of energy his rookie year plus his improved shooting. I can see him being one of the supertars of the league. He was the #2 pick for a reason.   Yea, this is my crazy 1% chance of happening pick."
"Not Bayless enough, let me help  Lonzo Ball is too lazy and doesn‚Äôt have a champion mentality, he doesn‚Äôt want to win enough"
Lonzo ball is not a good nba player and never will be and will be awful in the playoffs
"TIL Brandon Ingram, the all star and MIP player is a ""scrub"".   TIL that Lonzo ball is a scrub for getting an $85 million contract  You're delusional."
"He shot 41% on 6 C&amp;S 3PA‚Ä¶ if that‚Äôs mediocre then you will never get a shooter that‚Äôs good enough in your opinion lol. They‚Äôre both similar level playmakers but you‚Äôre right that Graham‚Äôs contract is a lot better. I‚Äôd still much rather have Lonzo though who has proven more on both sides of the ball than Graham.  And well their goal should be to make the playoffs so it‚Äôs kind of a lose-lose there, especially when they couldn‚Äôt even get a good pick back for Lonzo."
"Because he was a mediocre catch and shoot 3 guy which was his only role offensively.  That and fast breaks.   Graham is a a better spot up shooter and playmaker and is a big offensive upgrade over Lonzo and Lonzo isn‚Äôt actually very good defensively.  He gets beat consistently on ball. He‚Äôs a good off ball defender and ball hawk, but he‚Äôs underrated defensively.  Not a big downgrade going from Lonzo to Graham and at half the price it‚Äôs a no brainer.   They only lose a first if they make the playoffs this year"
"Lonzo Ball was one of the worst 4th quarter performers for the Pelicans last season, right next to Eric Bledsoe. He had a horrible netrating in the 4th quarter this year, despite the team overall having a positive one. You say that last season didn‚Äôt work because they choked games in the clutch, well Lonzo was a big part of that. His 3pt% dropped to 31% in the 4th quarter, he can‚Äôt put the ball on the ground, he can‚Äôt get to the line or make them consistently, and the pace slows down too so he‚Äôs less impactful there. You say Ingram is a bad closer and then hype up the guy every defense is cheating off to double Ingram."
"Ben eats cap and plays offense like Lonzo Ball having a bad day, he's good but what's the end game result?"
"Teams are happy to sag off Lonzo, to double off him and let him shoot. Hes also not a threat to put the ball on the floor. Not really what you want from a shooting guard."
"Because they consistently choked games in clutch in the 1st half of the season. It took them long enough to realize Ingram after 4 years, is not a reliable closer. Their defensive effort is pitiful at best. If Lonzo Ball playing 70% of the defense he played on the Lakers is their best defender, their coaching needs changing. Stan Van Gundy was a disappointment, but the FO decided to give a 4 year contract right off the bat"
Lonzo Ball: 38% on 8.3 3PA‚Ä¶. Plus great Defense and 6 APG
Like Lonzo Ball maybe?
"Lonzo is not a good defender. He‚Äôs a good off-ball defender, but he ain‚Äôt great and he sure isn‚Äôt very good on ball."
oubre is gonna b an all star this year .    lonzo ball will also b an all star this year
Lonzo ball can the lead the league in assist and average a triple double if a team lets him play like a pg
What about the Green/Ball category? Lonzo just got 84 mill and Draymond got over 100 mill lol so out of everyone sign to Klutch only 1 dude seem to lost out too me it seem he is the problem not Klutch lol
"It is imperative that Lonzo, Lamelo, and LiAngelo all name their first children Cockin. Cockin Ball."
"Do you think Lonzo makes less money if he has a different agent? Or is it that he's 23, shoots 38% from 3, can handle the ball and play very good defense?"
Lonzo ball   Ingram
Liangelo Ball Lonzo Ball Mello Ball
How can you predict MIP it‚Äôs about coming out better then you looked last year. If I had to take a guess I think you could look at Lonzo ball would have a good shot. If not it could be any rotational player who jumps to solid starter. It‚Äôs tough for an all star to improve enough to get it.
Derrick White   Lonzo Ball   Jrue Holiday
Lonzo Ball would be an upgrade even tho this sub considers him worse.   D‚ÄôAngelo Russell is someone who would have probably put them over   And underrated pick but Terry Rozier probably puts them over as well
Antitty‚Ä¶bwahahaha!!!!      Those three are Giannis and his two brothers that play garbage minutes. They do not have the same play style.       I‚Äôve not seen the youngest Ball brother play that much. But LaMelo is definitely a better version of Lonzo (so far).
"&gt;Playmaking is just another word for passing  Incorrect. Playmaking is more about your ability to create with the ball. You can be a fantastic passer but a mediocre playmaker, Lonzo Ball is the obvious example in today's NBA.  &gt;I'm hoping he wins a championship  I think that'd be cool. Still wouldn't make him an ""elite"" passer though."
Ben Simmons Lonzo Ball Jason Kidd

"Lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, liangelo ball"
"Simmons is 25 and is essentially the same offensive player today as he was when we walked in the NBA.   No one is trading for Simmons banking on him becoming a semi-competent shooter, or becoming a good pick and role player, abusing smaller guards in the post, rampaging to the rim like Giannis etc. 3 years ago you could. And, 3 years ago Simmons for Jaylen Brown or Mitchell was a thing. But, those days are gone.  You're describing some supped-up version of Lonzo Ball that is harder to fit on a team right? A really high-level role player with serious limitations.   Simmons is a good player and brings a lot to the table. But, the thing he is not good at is the most valued thing in basketball. Being able to create offence in the half-court. Adding to that, non-ballhandlers who can't space the floor are difficult to fit on teams.   I think most teams would be happy to have Simmons but we are talking about James Harden-type packages."
Riggin for Wiggins! So many teams talked about tanking for him. Generational talent got thrown around.   Lonzo Ball is a major disappointment. He‚Äôs a solid journeyman player but #2 overall And was supposed to be the next Magic Johnson.   Michael Beasley-productive enough role player but there was legit him or D-rose as the #1 overall pick.
"He wasn‚Äôt a threat to actually beat good teams in OKC. Low seeded small market playoff teams are the sweet spot for getting love, you‚Äôre not bad enough to get mocked for sucking but you‚Äôre not gonna actually beat any good teams either.  Also ESPN had a big Chris Paul love-in through the whole playoffs and there‚Äôs a huge number of people who react badly to literally anything ESPN pushes whether it‚Äôs reasonable or not (see also: Trae Young, Lonzo Ball)."
"yeh, you obviously get a worse jump shot out of a ball screen if you‚Äôre up against a guy like Jrue or Smart or Lonzo who can regularly beat a screen"
Liangelo Ball Lonzo Ball LaMelo Ball
"The Chicago Bulls are championship contenders. On any given night, nobody is stopping Vooch, Lavine, and DeRozan 1 on 1, and if they double any one of them they‚Äôre getting cooked on that possession. Billy Donovan‚Äôs elite defensive system will hide the defensive deficiencies of the team, and future sixth man of the year Coby White will demolish opposing bench units. And I haven‚Äôt even mentioned future all star Lonzo Ball, who is Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical. This team is preparing to be a dynasty, and I cannot wait to see them dominate the overrated Lakers and Nets."
Lonzo Ball or Ben Simmons
Lonzo Ball was billed as a tall playmaking PG with a funky shot. Now people consider him a 3 and D SG
"Marvin Williams, Evan Turner, Lonzo Ball"
"Marvin Williams, Andrew Bogut, Wiggins, Lonzo Ball so far, Oden...  IMO there's a different level of ""busts"" where they still had a serviceable career, compared to just outright busts like Anthony Bennett."
Lonzo Ball. But he gets overshadowed by Fultz
So don't be Lonzo Ball or Larry Bird
wow shots fired at lonzo ball
"But you should be mad. *I'm mad*! I wanted to see Lonzo develop with Zion. But NO messed everything up, starting with hiring Van Gundy, who took the ball out of Lonzo's hands too much. I think Zo still had potential and, despite what you are trying to say, I think it was a mistake. Zo *is* worth his contract to NO. They certainly aren't better off without him. They won't be able to use the cap space to get anyone better, that's for sure."
Lonzo Ball dislikes this
Lonzo ball ‚Äústeph curry with a 40 inch vert‚Äù
"I'm excited to see Lonzo, Lavine, DeMar, and Caruso all ball out. Calling it like I did for the Suns 2 years ago. Bulls gonna be finals contender within the next few years."
Found Lonzo Ball.
'Not shooting from here' - Larry Bird stance  'Not shooting from there' - Lonzo Ball stance
"Now you're being obtuse. Maybe deliberately, or maybe you just can't help it.  The Pels dumped Bledsoe and Adams for a better player on a cheaper contract, costing them a top-10 protected pick next year, expected by most to end up in the late 20s, while still getting the player they wanted in this year's draft.  Of course that brilliant move is nothing compared to the genius move of getting the dead weight of Lonzo Ball off the roster. Did you know there's a GM in the league so stupid he thinks Lonzo Ball is a playmaker? And worth $20M/year?  Meanwhile the Pelicans got Devonte' Graham - as good a shooter as Ball and a better playmaker - for almost half as much $$$ as Ball. The better player at half the price."
Dont Forget when embiid told simmons to dunk on Lonzo Ball because of his loud mouth dad. Then they had that hallway meeting between the Ball dad and Embiid. I thought that was pretty cringey
"Below are some of the players who are gone now, but were on the Laker‚Äôs roster the year before LeBron joined them, and during his first season with the team -    Lonzo Ball    De‚ÄôAndre Hunter  **Was drafted by Lakers but shipped off in the AD trade.    Ivica Zubac    Thomas Bryant    Brandon Ingram    Kyle Kuzma    Josh Hart    Alex Caruso    KCP    Larry Nance    Julius Randle    Reggie Bullock    Jordan Clarkson    Brook Lopez    LeBron James   I wouldn't mind seeing this team in action."
"Lamelo made no sense for the Warriors. You have Curry and Thompson to carry the scoring and Curry and Green to carry the Ball handling and Running the offense. Wiseman was needed for the inside and that's it. It's been less than a year for him. Dam, Let the dude for play. Yall did this to Lonzo and look how that paid off."
"MIAMI ‚Äî For a long while, the scowl on Kyle Lowry‚Äôs face seemed permanently etched. He used that edginess to rise from meager beginnings in Philadelphia as he scraped for stability early in his N.B.A. career.      ‚ÄúI knew I was good,‚Äù Lowry said during breakfast at a hotel here. ‚ÄúI knew I was a starter. But I still had to prove it. I still had the chip on my shoulder. I still had to do this, that and the other. And I still play like that.‚Äù      That determination blossomed in Toronto, where Lowry, 35, provided a foundational steadiness across nine seasons, six All-Star berths and a championship in 2019. But all that came only after he fought for court time and was traded from Memphis, which drafted him in 2006, and then Houston during his first six years in the league.      The stage is now set for Lowry to begin the final arc of his playing career with the Miami Heat, who hope that the addition of a veteran point guard with a championship pedigree will launch them back into contention for a title. The Heat journeyed all the way to the N.B.A. finals in the pandemic-paused 2019-20 season, but last season were quickly dispatched by the Milwaukee Bucks.      In the off-season, Lowry signed a three-year contract with Miami worth nearly $90 million, joining a retooled team intent on making Milwaukee‚Äôs tenure atop the Eastern Conference a brief stay. Lowry was a prized free-agent target after a midcareer span that made him synonymous with the Raptors.      ‚ÄúWe all were mutually agreed that it was time,‚Äù Lowry said of leaving Toronto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to put it into words. It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      His journey in Toronto started with questions ‚Äî he was the team‚Äôs backup plan after a failed attempt at landing Steve Nash ‚Äî crested with a championship and ended in a season no one could have anticipated.         ImageLowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.   Lowry was criticized for poor shooting early in the 2019 finals against Golden State but responded with a clutch performance in the championship-clinching victory in Game 6.Credit...Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press     The coronavirus pandemic forced the Raptors to relocate to Tampa, Fla., for their home games in 2020-21. Toronto righted itself after a shaky beginning, only for the season to unravel when Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and others missed time because of virus protocols.      ‚ÄúThe city of Tampa was great,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúIt was just difficult because we didn‚Äôt know what to expect day by day. We were in fifth place, fourth place. We hit a Covid stretch and then it was over.‚Äù      Speculation swirled over whether the franchise would deal Lowry, who was on a one-year contract. The Heat, among other teams, made inquiries about acquiring him before the March trade deadline.      Lowry had pledged to his teammates before the season that he intended to help them compete for another championship. The team‚Äôs dismal record made such a foray unlikely, but Lowry wanted to stay true to his word in seeing the season through.      The adage of sports being a business is a truism. Every so often, the reality becomes murkier.      In 2018, the Raptors and Masai Ujiri, the team‚Äôs president, traded DeMar DeRozan, a franchise cornerstone who, along with Lowry, had brought respectability and competitiveness to the organization and was beloved in the city.      Toronto acquired Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs in the trade, immediately won a championship and frayed its relationship with DeRozan. It avoided a potential similar fracturing with Lowry.      ‚ÄúSometimes franchises have to do what‚Äôs best for them, but I was in a position where I had say and I had a little bit, I wouldn‚Äôt say power ‚Äî but I had a little bit of, ‚ÄòListen, it‚Äôs not going to be a good look if we don‚Äôt collaborate on this together,‚Äô‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúWe all agreed that to be on the same page was the best thing to do, and that was that.      ‚ÄúWith DeMar not having the autonomy of having a decision, I think it was just such a different circumstance. It prepared them to not do that to me.‚Äù      Lowry finished the season in Toronto and landed with the Heat, anyway. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really tough for us to see an incredible player like that go,‚Äù Ujiri said at a news conference in August. ‚ÄúWe knew this was coming. The direction of our team was kind of going younger and Kyle still has these incredible goals.‚Äù      ""It was just time. For me, I knew with Miami it was the right situation, right timing, right place, right people, right everything.‚Äù      Lowry is one of several point guards, including Chris Paul and Mike Conley, who are still flexing impactful games in their mid-30s, a quality Lowry attributes to better modern knowledge about dieting and training.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been super athletic,‚Äù Lowry said with a laugh. ‚ÄúI can dunk and all that, but I still play low to the ground. I‚Äôm not explosive. And I know how to not jump when I don‚Äôt need to be jumping.‚Äù      Lowry saw a role for himself with the Heat, a franchise eager for another championship. He had established a relationship with Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra while playing for him at an N.B.A. Africa exhibition in South Africa in 2017. Tampering investigations concerning Lowry‚Äôs sign-and-trade deal to the Heat, along with the one that allowed Lonzo Ball to join the Chicago Bulls, are ongoing, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week.      In Miami, Jimmy Butler is Lowry‚Äôs primary wing mate after he spent years alongside DeRozan ‚Äî ‚ÄúSmooth,‚Äù Lowry said of DeRozan. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù      And of Leonard: ‚ÄúA machine,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúHe gets it done.‚Äù      DeRozan and Leonard are two of the game‚Äôs quieter personalities. Butler, though, is a force, both vocally and on the court. Lowry said Butler often communicates through strings of expletives.      ‚ÄúI partly think it‚Äôs to get him going, because he‚Äôs got to get himself going somehow some way, which is dope,‚Äù Lowry said, adding that ‚Äúsome people can‚Äôt take it‚Äù and think Butler‚Äôs a jerk.      ‚ÄúNah, it‚Äôs just how he is,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúEverybody has different demands on themselves.‚Äù      Butler recently told reporters that the team was adjusting to how quickly Lowry got the ball upcourt.      ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always looking to pitch the ball ahead and get guys in the right spot,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible. It‚Äôs a blessing, and sometimes it‚Äôs a curse because you‚Äôve got to be in some really great shape if you‚Äôre out there in what we call the Kyle chaos.‚Äù      One day, Lowry expects to retire as a Raptor. Until then, he expects his former teammates to grow into the roles he and DeRozan once occupied. Lowry, for example, faced criticism for missing shots during the first few games of the 2019 finals. He responded with 26 points, 10 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 championship-clinching victory.      ‚ÄúFreddy, OG, Pascal, now they have to take the interviews, and they have to do all the media. Because I‚Äôm the guy who was like, ‚ÄòYo, it‚Äôs on me,‚Äô‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúThey have to take the criticism, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to help them grow. I want them to be the All-Stars. I want them to be the champions again. I want them to get opportunities to create generational wealth.‚Äù"
"I'm saying! I initially thought at the very least Lamelo is more talented offensively and Lonzo defensively but their 1st game stat lines are wild. The more I think about it though Lamelo and Lonzo as your point and sg would PERFECT.   Not sure if it was the Ringer but I remember a podcast mentioning how Lonzo's strength is in being a ""connective tissue"" passer. While he doesn't necessarily break down defenses like his brother, he knows how to read/make smart decisions with the ball"
"It‚Äôs really just not his game. He‚Äôs an ok finisher, but it‚Äôs more efficient for the team if he makes a smart pass to a teammate who is a better finisher. Also, he‚Äôs not great at midrange shooting, especially off the dribble, so when he drives the on-ball-defender can just commit to the paint.   If Lonzo develops a better midrange and handle he would be a lot more prevalent of a scoring presence. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever be on Melo‚Äôs level though."
I'm so jealous you get him AND Lonzo's defense. Lonzo is so fucking cerebral and always aware of where the ball is going.
"How often has a max player become a worse shooter, especially in the playoffs? Guys like Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball show you can drastically improve your percentages if you put the work in. Ben refuses to do it, and got called out accordingly."
Unbiased NBA Top 5  1. Giannis  2. Lonzo Ball  3. Alex Caruso  4. Jaylen Brown  5. PJ Tucker
"I dig it, Caruso is a demon on the defensive end and doesn't need the ball much on offense. I like his fit more with Lavine &amp; Lonzo  I like the idea to run Derozan more with the bench units, the team isn't exactly flush with guys who can create their own shot much less create for others. Derozan's minutes being staggered means the bench unit isn't starved of a ball-handler"
"#Lamelo ball is a excellent shooter  Many doubted lamelo as a shooter due to his form being a little odd. They said he would be just as poor of a shooter as lonzo. However those people don‚Äôt understand basketball and how to shoot. Lamelo has some of the best energy transfer in a basketball shot I have ever seen (up there with curry. A good way to look at energy transfer is a floppy wrist, it shows excess energy which is a good sign, however there are so many other ways like ball before body etc so I won‚Äôt complicate it) Furthermore his off hand doesn‚Äôt actually affect his shot, it comes off so early that he can fully release with one hand. Lamelo shot 37% from 3 last year as a rookie on over 6 attempts (CRAZY GOOD). I fully expect lamelo to shoot over 40% from 3 this year on a lot more attempts. Due to his fantastic energy transfer he can also shoot super deep and keep his percentages consistent similar to guys like dame. I think this year lamelo‚Äôs best skill will be his shooting. It‚Äôs a hot take now but in 6 months I don‚Äôt think it will be."
"Lonzo, Lavine and Demar can alternate being ball handler."
Damn Lamelo improved so much. Same with Lonzo. No one can shit on ball brothers anymore lol
"The Lakers right now could have: 1) Lonzo Ball, 2) some SG they could‚Äôve drafted probably, 3) Brandon Ingram, 4) Julius Randle, 5) Ivica Zubac, Caruso off the bench.  I wonder if they‚Äôd prefer that to the ring and what they have now."
"Our other scorers had an off night so our superstar stepped up? We don‚Äôt need him to be the primary ball handler getting everybod involved that‚Äôs why we got lonzo, btw the Zach and vuc pick and pop will be money all season so idk why that‚Äôs a complaint."
For no apparent reason there's a whole lot of people who refuse to let go of the conviction that Lonzo Ball was totally legit and not 1000% a product of marketing hype
If a team can get Lonzo trying to be a scorer and holding the ball too much the bulls will struggle. Lonzo is booty cakes at shot creation.  If you can force Williams and Lonzo to take contested shots bulls will struggle
Lonzo Ball is pretty much Magic Johnson but a different person. Chicago is definitely winning one in the next 3 years.
I‚Äôm real excited about this. Most hyped I‚Äôve ever been to see Lonzo Ball play.
"Yeah obviously they're better. But that's not the point of the list numb nuts. It's to recognize greatness as it has evolved over the 75 years of the NBA  Are you really too dumb to understand that? Of course even Lonzo Ball would probably be able to cross up Bob Cousy but we aren't going to honor Lonzo for being the 17th best point guard of his day we're honoring guys like Cousy and Sharman and Arizin for the innovations they made to the game in the 40s, 50s, 60s.   Do you think anyone would care about a list of the top 75 players of all time if it was just 73 2000s- present players + Bird and Magic? Because that's what you're asking for"
" Dlo - Lost the locker room when he filmed Nick Young admitting to cheating on his wife and leaked it. There was no coming back from that.   Clarkson - Balled out harder on Lakers. Slightly dipped after he went to the Cavs. He was also one of the rare players who played 3 years in college, which is why he excelled early in his career and then development plateaued.   Julius - Was only in shape contract year.   Ingram - Played fine on the Lakers. Adjusted out of his primary role fairly well.   Lonzo - Needed time to fix his shot. Still hasn't really lived up to being the #2 pick.   As has been pointed out elsewhere, they're all ball dominant players. It wouldn't really work out.   Its extremely rare in this league for a player to ball out super early in their career. Lottery picks are primarily 18 years old. Aging and maturing and repetition is a much bigger factor than coaching during this time."
"Nikola Vucevic, Patrick Williams, Demar Derozan, Zach LaVine, Lonzo Ball  Vs.   Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, Rip Hamilton, Luol Deng, Derrick Rose.   I think it‚Äôd be a close game but I‚Äôd give the edge to the 11/12 Bulls. They were the first overall seed for a reason."
I think he‚Äôs just referencing how everyone called our young players trash when they were on the Lakers but then suddenly love them once they‚Äôre not on the Lakers. Examples:  -	Julius Randle -	Jordan Clarkson -	D‚ÄôAngelo Russel -	Larry Nance -	Brandon Ingram -	Lonzo Ball -	Alex Caruso -	Kyle Kuzma
The issue with Kuzma has less to do with the hype (BI and Lonzo had way more hype) and more to do with how he plays. Kuzma's playstyle just doesn't work inconjuction with most players. He seemingly hijacks the offense to try and create his own shot. It just doesn't look fluid and often looks silly the ways he loses the ball or passes out of shots.  This team already has a bunch of forwards and who knows what'll happen once TB is back too. I don't think he's going to have the greenlight that a lot of people are predicting he'll have.
"I think it‚Äôs literally impossible to win a championship w Westbrook as he plays currently.   Similar to great sixth men of the year, he‚Äôs super talented and the definition of a spark plug. He can run the offense mediocrely enough for your starters not to be miserable on the bench.   But, similar to great sixth men, he gives up as much as he gets. Between the 0 game sense defense, the 3 point shot (efficiency in general), or his overconfidence compared to his decision making/shot making.   If Lonzo was on the team, he wouldn‚Äôt make as many positive contributions as Russ, but he‚Äôd space the floor, play way better defense, be ‚Äúconnective tissue‚Äù instead of an overconfident chucker, less turnovers/better decisions/less ball dominance, etc. For Lonzo to give a positive contribution, he doesn‚Äôt run a huge risk of negative contributions, and he doesn‚Äôt step on ‚ú®literally Lebron James‚Äô toes‚ú®  Russ‚Äô role on any real contender would at best be a A+ 6th man. Especially a team with Lebron. If you think he‚Äôll change, you‚Äôre wrong. He will never improve after the life he has lead since 2015"
"Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball died for one Laker ring...the years after LeBron will be very rough."
"Ben Simmons is Lonzo Ball lite. So, no."
"You said elite tho and none of those guys are elite. Here is elite playmakers  LeBron, Harden, Luka, Jokic, CP3 etc. Not Ben Simmons who dont even shoot the ball or Lonzo/Rubio who cant finish shit at the rim."
Well i disagree. To me Simmons on that Lonzo-Rubio class. All of them can be playmaker (i think Rubio better than other two easily) but because none of them finish at the rim and shoot while dribbling at the same time i wouldnt call none of them elite playmakers.   I think Ben on Twolves is a good thing btw. KAT doesnt want that much ball on his hand like Embiid and he is much better shooter while not a good defender (that can change tho) i would def try to get him if i was Twolves
He didn't play that bad last year but Lonzo Ball will have his best season as a pro.
"The Miami Heat are mediocre, and not gonna make the playoffs this year. Lonzo Ball is a great playmaker. Teams needing to ‚Äúremain competitive‚Äù is greatly overrated. GSW needed KD *WAY* more than a majority of fans and the media acknowledge. Number of All Star selections should not be a determining factor when judging if a player is HOF. Just because a player isn‚Äôt good on defense that doesn‚Äôt make them a ‚Äúliability‚Äù. Small ball is overrated and overused."
"I agree $20 Million per year seems like a lot, but I just can‚Äôt see it being any less. Potential is expensive, and $20 Million is just about the going rate for an average starter. I‚Äôm not even basing this on his improved play at the end of the season. I‚Äôm basing it on his overall season stats.   ## Here are some comps from this off-season:   ### Jarrett Allen  Jarrett Allen just got $20 Million per year, and Miles plays a more valuable position, defends better than him, and shoots 40% from 3.   ### Lonzo Ball   Miles matches up pretty well with Lonzo, who also got  $20 Million per year. Lonzo is the better playmaker, but Miles is the more versatile defender and *much* better at finishing around the rim. Miles shot a better percentage from 3, but Lonzo shoots more 3‚Äôs per game, so that‚Äôs a bit of a wash.   ### Duncan Robinson  The deal Robinson signed this off-season averages $18 Million per year. Robinson is obviously a better shooter than Bridges, but Bridges is better at every other NBA skill, and still a good shooter. Bridges is also 4 years younger than Robinson, which is why he‚Äôd get at least $2 more per year.   ### Mikal Bridges  Mikal Bridges just signed a 4 year $90 Million dollar deal (~$22 per year). Miles put up basically the same numbers as Mikal last season. Mikal scored slightly less than a point more than Miles. He did it on a little better efficiency too, but he also has the better supporting cast. They‚Äôre both good defenders, but in my opinion, Miles flashed a little more offensive creation than Mikal. Miles is also 2 years younger than Mikal, which is worth a decent amount.   $20 Million may seem like a lot, but it‚Äôs basically the going rate. NBA fans just aren‚Äôt used to the new Cap numbers yet. What‚Äôs wild is that the cap is gonna explode even more in a few years, when the new TV deal gets negotiated. Being an NBA player is so much more lucrative than being an NFL player since there are only 5 guys on the court at a time."
"I respect that he‚Äôs come out and laughed at himself for that. He admits that it was a horrible take, and that everyone has horrible takes every now and then, but his basketball commentary has gotten much better in the last couple of years.  It‚Äôs funny because around the same time he made a video on why Thon Maker was prepping for a superstar career and would be an MVP candidate. The Lonzo Ball take was trash, but this one was straight up ludicrous."
"I saw it yesterday, I can't find it now. Something like Lonzo ball is the only player in history to average 5.3 ast, 4.8 reb, 1.2 stl, 0.8 blk on 4,4 3pa!"
Jeez I remember when he got drafted and his dad made some comment about Fox ‚Äúeating that ass up‚Äù in reference to how he‚Äôs gonna play against people who got drafted above him (it might have been about Lonzo ball tbh)   And it was impossible to discuss Fox on this sub without getting a bunch of ass eating jokes  Can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs 5 years ago‚Ä¶
Lonzo Ball
I would say it's Lonzo Ball who is the key for success (as a non-star)
Lakers win finals Kuzma All-Star Lonzo Ball all defense first team
"Lonzo was safe here. Calculating trajectory throwing the ball off Steven Adams is basically the same as a brick wall, I assume."
Adam‚Äôs life flashes before his eyes when he saw that ball coming. But then he realized it was lonzo ball passing it and not draymond green
"The risk isn't *that* high.  Pause the clip in the frame Lonzo throws it. He's the furthest back member, and the closes member is 3-4 steps behind him, with the second closest being the one who sprinted the other way that Lonzo threw it off of, and is essentially out of contention for the loose ball because his momentum goes the other direction. Even Ja has to lay out for a chance at that loose ball which he probably doesn't bc it's a preseason game."
"If it bounces into the backcourt he's in lead position to get to the ball, theres one body moving at half speed into Memphis's side easily 3-4 steps behind Lonzo and then the guy sprinting to the loose ball back towards Chicago's side that Lonzo throws it off of."
I think lonzo ball is a pretty good basketball player who will make my team better cause he‚Äôs pretty good
"&gt;Lonzo‚Äôs full court office won‚Äôt transition to the nba/playoffs. Half court matters.  we don't know yet. People were saying the splash brothers couldn't go anywhere in the playoffs. Anyway, Lonzo doesn't always have to be the on ball playmaker, because they got Lavine and DeRozan for this. Lonzo can shoot and will space the floor while playing good D. He ain't Lamelo, but he knows his role and we'll see what he does come playoffs time."
How long will it take for Bulls fans to figure out that Caruso is better than Lonzo Ball?
"Prior to getting Westbrook I hoped that the Lakers would try get Lonzo back as he would be an excellent fit with LeBron and AD, but he seems like he‚Äôs an excellent fit with you guys seeing as he doesn‚Äôt need the ball in his hands. You guys look terrifying"
Lonzo has always been able to Ball. Glad he‚Äôs getting some love from Bulls fans he‚Äôs going to have a great year!
"He averaged more potential assists per game than Lonzo Ball and Goran Dragic last year, and about the same as Jamal Murray. If the rest of the Cavs could actually hit open shots, his assist numbers would be a lot better."
"His passing numbers are fine. He made more passes per game than Ja Morant, marcus smart, donovan mitchell, terry rozier, Jamal Murray lmao. He had as many potential assists as Murray, Lonzo, Dragic... He's not some crazy ball hog."
"Didn't pay much attention to prospects until the 2017 draft.  2017 top 5 prospects 1. Markelle Fultz 2. De'Aaron Fox 3. Josh Jackson 4: Jonathan Isaac 5. Jayson Tatum  Didn't think Bam Adebayo, Lonzo Ball (thought he'd be a bust because of his jumpshot and they hype) or Jarrett Allen would be as good as they have become  2018 top 5 prospects 1. Luka Doncic (thought he'd be a superstar but not to the level that he is) 2. Marvin Bagley III 3. Deandre Ayton 4. Mo Bamba 5. Michael Porter Jr  I thought Trae Young would be Isaiah Thomas 2.0 with his defense being the reason he can't lead a team against strong competition and didn't think much of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.    2019 top 5 prospects 1. Zion Williamson 2. Ja Morant 3. RJ Barrett (pre college season, I had him number 1) 4.  Coby White 5. Cam Reddish  Hunter, Thybulle, and Clarke have really impressed me and I think Herro is great but don't know how much better he will get  2020 top 5 prospects (was not that high on these prospects compared to other years) 1. Anthony Edwards 2. LaMelo Ball (thought he was the most NBA ready and also most likely to bust 3. James Wiseman 4. Cole Anthony 5. Onyeka Okongwu   I think that Tyrese Halliburton can be a great player and Patrick Williams can be a third option on a championship team but this class hasn't had a chance to reach the heights of rookies from other classes yet  2021 top 5 prospects 1. Cade Cunningham (think he's the best player drafted since Luka) 2. Jalen Green (watched a few of his games to watch Kuminga and Green always outplayed him although he was ball dominant) 3. Jonathan Kuminga (second highest ceiling in the draft) 4. Evan Mobley (most likely to bust but the best big since the 2018 draft excluding Zion who is a wing / big hybrid) 5. Ziaire Williams (I think he has the physical tools to be a player that comes close to the all star game but doesn't make it)   Scottie Barnes and Davion Mitchell have gone on my radar"
Lonzo and Zion to the Hornets. They could have a Hornets Z-Ball line up.
"he should be.  ALl the crap he got, the guy was a man with a plan and a vision and the nba even if you're athletic adn gifted is very, very hard to be in to. 2/3 kids were top 3 picks, thats insane and something holidays, plumlees, lopez, or giannis bros can't say much.  The guy pushed them and it worked out pretty beautifully. Save for the dumb china incident, even if liangelo didn't make it he would've had a full ride to ucla.  All the crap talked abotu him, but his boys seem to never fight, talk trash, and more so they play ultimate team ball, move the ball up the transition constantly, passes or hockey passes just keep the ball rolling.  Their style of play doesnt reflect the narcissm which ball preaches.    Charlotte simply missed out of the goldmine of overpaying lonzo to come there, like they did with hayward, but it would be instant games more on national tv, a great story line, further more two athletic tall guards who can shoot and push the ball that may draw in other scorers finishers too.      I would've given Lonzo a 3 year close to max. That way when lamelo is up for extension they have leverage and can pay both and these guys generate more revenue, sales and attention than other at their level of play as they already have celebrity and for charlotte thats huge.  You can also win with those two as your 1/2"
"Look at the past succesful 2nd picks  Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, D'lo Russell, Oladipo. Hell even look at Liangelo Ball who was chosen right after Wiseman and is showing much more potential. All of these players got the ball in there hands and solid minutes, much higher than 20.   Wiseman situtation is far from 100% ideal lol."
Lonzo Ball is reporting for duty.
"Easy  PG: Lonzo Ball SG: Jordan Poole SF: MPJ PF: Myles Turner ( if he was an all star, then OG Anoby)  C: Clint Capela"
giddey isn‚Äôt that good of a shooter. in fact it‚Äôs his weakest point. it‚Äôs obvious u have never watched him play. take it from an australian who watches the NBL. if anything he is closer to a Lonzo Ball or Rondo type.
"1) I feel like everything you typed shows why Kyrie would fit on the Bulls. Lonzo doesn‚Äôt need the ball in his hands. Kyrie just showed how productive he can be with two player who must have the ball in their hands in Harden and Durant.   2) Why wouldn‚Äôt the Nuggets trade Murray, coming off an injury, for Kyrie Irving, the far superior player without Murray injury? You‚Äôre talking about chemistry and such, but the Nuggets did a damn good job without Murray. Add Kyrie to that team and they are dangerous.   3) You‚Äôre speaking like you are one of Shams‚Äô sources. Give me a concrete course than Kyrie wouldn‚Äôt player for the Lakers.   4) once again, give me a source.   5) I apologize that I misspelled Ingels‚Äô name. It is a sin that cannot be forgiven. Jazz would absolutely accept that trade. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot if you don‚Äôt think they wouldn‚Äôt take that in a heart beat. If there aren‚Äôt better offers for Kyrie, which clearly do not exist based on what you have commented, why would the nets accepts this trade? What benefit is it to the Nets to keep Kyrie and let him walk after the season knowing full and well he won‚Äôt play another game in a Nets uniform?"
"1. he doesn't fit with the bulls. lonzo need the ball in his hands, just like simmons though he cannot create for himself in a half court setting. but he doesn't need to because lavine will take 20 shots, derozan and vuc both are scorers. adding kyrie makes no sense. and who is to say derozan isn't the 4 this year anyway, did u forget about patrick williams at the 3?  2. this isn't 2K dude. murray for kyrie is a terrible trade. just because you think talent and fit wise it would work, you need to take into considerstion context and situation. no way the nuggets risk trading jamal murray, homegrown guy who has great chemistry with the team, for a headcase like kyrie  3. Kyrie would not want to play with LeBron ""father figure"" James ever again. And they just traded for Westbrook. As if they trade for Kyrie  4. Sixers want to trade Ben Simmons. The organisation (Morey) is not trading him for Kyrie. Needs to maximise Embiid's window, trading for Ky who can't even play in philly is not doing that pal  5. You can't even spell Joe Ingles' name. But this is the funniest one by far. No team says yes to this oneü§£ not even the Nets."
"&gt;could run a crazy small ball lineup like the Rockets did when they had Westbrook with Lonzo, Kyrie, Lavine, Williams, and DeRozan.  That 5 is getting a train ran on them defensively"
"I‚Äôd do Vucevic and Troy Brown for Kyrie. Would need to reinforce the inside after the trade at some point in the season, but could run a crazy small ball lineup like the Rockets did when they had Westbrook with Lonzo, Kyrie, Lavine, Williams, and DeRozan.  The ceiling upgrade would be too good to pass for the Bulls, and I think Vucevic is a decent return for a guy that can‚Äôt play."
Confirms lonzo ball is a little caterpillar
"Steph with a 40"" vertical = Lonzo Ball. At least according to some Youtuber."
"I mean with Trae the difference between what I would say he is based on last season and what I'd expect him to be at the end of this season are quite different.  As we stand now and all we can look is last season, it's just a thing that Trae had particularly poor defensive season that hit hard on his offensive value that I would have considered to be around 5th with almost challenging Harden at 4th.  So assuming he keeps his offense up and can improve or find a different role within his team defensively or anything he's likely to end up somewhere around 6-8th at the end of this season in my mind.  With Ja I guess we come to the thing that I know I know will always get hate and downvotes, but I wouldn't consider it disrespect to compare him to Caruso. Like let me ask you this: How would you rate Caruso's last season defensively, not just among PG's but entire league?  Meant Lonzo when talking about ball and also not going forward but just last season impact. Although to be clear I'd agree that Lonzo is below Morant, but in a similar range, since Lonzo was around neutral on defense.  If you want to look offensively then I would have Morant around 9-12 probably below CP3 and above Walker. When I add defense to it, then that drops him for me and elevate some other guys who excel on that end.  I'm guessing at the end of this season he will be around 7-14, since him and Trae are both trending upwards while many other PG's who had particularly positive years last season were either fluke's, are trending downwards or there's some other weird stuff happening (like Kyrie, Simmons etc).  I could try to name like 16 PG's who I felt had better performance overall last regular season compared to Morant, but it would just end up with you picking out all the more defensive players and another 40 downvotes or whatever so I don't see much point with that.  You can just take my offensive rating of Ja and Trae since I guess that would be what you agree anyways. So Ja is offensively 9-12 and Trae 5th and Caruso as offensively 45th or something of 53 players is poor comparison, fair enough."
"Top contenders on the east doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôd better than AD paired with lebron fucking James. I have nothing against Lavine so long as you aren‚Äôt somehow suggesting him and vuc are worth lebron. If it was that simple the bulls wouldn‚Äôt need AD they‚Äôd have already made the damn playoffs last year. And Russ always starts slow, but he‚Äôs better than lonzo ball. You can‚Äôt sit there with a straight face and argue that based off some preseason games that it‚Äôs somehow impossible for AD to mesh with one of the best playmakers of the generation."
This is the answer. Remember the constant Lonzo ball highlights when he was a laker?
"Right:   Ball Bros. When people were talking about LaMelo not even being picked in the draft, I was saying he could be a top 5 pick and would be an asset to any team.  Lonzo I wasn't necessarily exact about but I knew he would be a productive player. I thought his college shot would transfer and he'd be fine even with the unconventional jumper. Well it took a rework but he's become an elite shooter, mixed with everything else he does, he's only going to get better.  Wrong:  I thought Zion would be the next Greg Oden, shit I may still be right. Dominant when he's on the court but plagued by injuries and retired far earlier than he should. But so far it only seems like minor setbacks rather than career altering or ending injuries  Jarrett Culver: I thought his size and switchability would make him a valuable asset right from the start and the offense would come in time. Well he's almost out of the league so..."
"In no particular order based on draft class and whatever comes to mind that I remember having a strong opinion on -   High - Zion Williamson, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Ja Morant, Lonzo Ball, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Victor Oladipo, TJ Warren, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins  High but missed the mark - Wendell Carter Jr, Ben McLemore, Kevin Knox, Lauri Markkanen, Dennis Smith Jr, Malik Monk, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Anthony Bennet, Dion Waiters, Evan Turner"
MVP - Hookah Doncic MIP - Lonzo Ball DPOY - Giannis 6th Man - Monk/Melo ROY - Jalen Green
"Why? They have 3 players with more proven offensive skillsets in LaVine, Derozan, and Vucevic. Lonzo isn‚Äôt taking the ball out of any of their hands"
"just ban the word covid, vaccine, kyrie, and simmons from all headlines for the next week. just like the father of lonzo ball is banned from headlines. the headlines need to be about players putting the ball into the net. Please."
"Been watching homie since he was 14 he was undoubtedly the most talented out of the ball brothers, lonzo is best defender but melo is the real deal."
Simmons at 80% would be Lonzo Ball before he figured out a working jumper.
"Ok, TJ McConnell.... his rookie year he had more assists and less turnovers per 100 possessions than LaMelo.   If you discount per 100 possessions, and prefer just totals per game balancing assists and turnovers:   Damian Lillard  Elfrid Payton  Ricky Rubio  Ben Simmons Trey Young  Lonzo Ball MCW   So not a ton, but certainly not groundbreaking/generational"
Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball. However we're lucky enough to see them team up this season üôè
"Cade's ""floor"" is a nice on and off-ball player who reads the floor well and can score at all levels and has a pretty good understanding of defense. His ceiling might be Paul George who passes more than scores. He's not as athletic as PG though.  Jalen's ""floor"" is scoring machine with just okay playmaking/defense. I've seen him be compared to BI and to Beal and I kind of see it. I think his ceiling seems like it'd be like Beal but taller lol.  Mobley, ""floor"" is tricky because he's still putting on weight and he's not really playing a lot of reps on center now. He's really dynamic on offense. He can move well but he's not going to do well when bigger guys bully him in the paint. I see his comparison is often Chris Bosh. Evan's a really underrated ball-handler/passer too, Mobley's got a lot of tools in his bag.  Suggs is my favorite one to think about. He's just a playmaker. He makes plays on defense and offense and just flat-out hustles. His ceiling should be about him finding his outside shot. Dude is scrappy. I see a little of Lonzo and a little of Jamal Murray in his game. His ceiling to me might be a mix of them but more defense than Murray but less scoring than him too.  Scottie Barnes, is also very interesting. Scouts were calling him 'magic johnson' and saying he had a magnetic personality. He is more athletic than Green, Suggs, and Cade. He's 6'7 and can pass and defend but his bigger question is offense. He needs a better handle too, but tall big athletic and good at a lot of important things. If Scottie can find a lot of offense to match his defense, he might be better than a few of the guys who went before him. It'll be interesting to watch."
Lonzo ball in a fast break situation
"A team that hasn't made the playoffs for almost 20 years with horrendous draft record should be 30th. Y'all got fucked.   Then again, these are the same guys who put Lonzo ball over DeRozan. Fuck their lists."
lonzo ball
meet lonzo ball
If you know it‚Äôs preseason then why are you so thirsty? Nobody cares about the Bulls except we want to see how Lonzo Ball doing since he secured the bag üí∞ üí∞ üí∞
"I don't think Lonzo is a better passer, his lack of handle/scoring prevents him from being an effective passer in the half court. He can really just spot-up. Which is why I say he's better in a vacuum, his skillset is a luxury. If you have a ball dominant guard you can play with him in the half court then great, but the Pels didn't, and its just really difficult when your PG is mainly limited to spotting up in the half court."
Lonzo Ball ain't stopping Trae
"Derozan has porous defence and Vucevic is a poor rim protector; it doesn't matter how good Caruso and Ball are at perimeter defence, the Bulls would be lucky to be an average defence.   In the half court, the lack of a true PG will be apparent. Lonzo isn't that guy as he doesn't have the inside scoring threat off the P&amp;R. The most creative responsibility in the half court Lonzo can command is as a secondary ball handler but that pushes Lavine into the primary ball handler role which is not a good fit."
"Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson  Micheal Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Reggie Miller  Honorable mentions: Luka Doncic, Jason Williams and Lonzo Ball (love his game and I was sad to see such an exciting prospect crumble under the pressure his father put on him)"
"Based on the last 2 games (small sample size I know) but the scheme seems to be for our good defenders (Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Caruso etc) to pick up their man really early and pressure every pass by swarming the ball handler. It may work it may not but I don't think the Bulls will be the worst defence in the league running this type of defensive scheme"
&gt; I'm optimistic. Look at Lonzo Ball  Lonzo Ball shot 41% from 3 in college though
"I don‚Äôt disagree with your point as a whole, but people were also somewhat surprised that Lonzo was such a poor shooter his rookie year, after what he showed in college (even with a shortened line).   Ultimately, Lonzo was always a shooter, with varying success. Ben Simmons never has been, so while I agree with the general point about his lack of improvement, I‚Äôm just not sure Lonzo is the best comparison there. A lot of otherwise skilled shooters struggle shooting the ball in their early NBA years, for any number of reasons.   Funnily enough, I think Blake Griffin is a much better comparison here. Never shot threes until the league started transitioning to everyone shooting threes, and became surprisingly decent at it with pretty solid 3PA, not incredible overall but definitely what people wish they could see from Simmons."
"I'm optimistic. Look at Lonzo Ball, the only guy who had worst mechanics was Michael Kidd Gilchrest, but Ball fixed his jumper. He's actually a decent/good shooter now. Brook Lopez went from sinking three 3pt shots in his first 8 years to sinking 134 in his 9th season.   So I think the only thing that's keeping anyone from being a good shooter is repetition and effort. We have some of the best shooting coaches and developmental staff in the league, so as long as he puts the time into it, then it'll happen I feel.   On the other hand, you can't teach defensive instincts. I can't think of too many bad or average defenders become good or lock down. Scottie's got the stuff you can't really teach or develop, every minus he has can be turned into a positive."
Zach is gonna have a Booker like breakout season. Went from limited ball handling from his teammates to Demar and Lonzo
1) Kobe 2) Steph 3) Darius Miles 4) Paul George 5) Lonzo Ball
I am not shy about rooting for Lonzo in real life or on here. I watched more than enough Pelicans games because of him. I will be watching Bulls games. I also watch some Hornets games because of the other Ball brother.   It‚Äôs one of those things where I keep telling folks be patient he will find his game. It‚Äôs also the little things he does. I know he has flaws and probably won‚Äôt make an All-Star but god damnit I am gonna stan hard for him.
1) Kobe Bryant  2) Lonzo Ball  3) Steve Nash  4) Luka Doncic  5) Kevin Garnett
"Their subreddit has a very weird obsession with Griffin, they genuinely take offense if anyone even mentions the concept of him being incompetent, they would genuinely choose Griffin over Zion, it's VERY weird. They hated Lonzo because Griffin hated him, it's that simple. They also have very little understanding of what they're watching. They were complaining that Lonzo isn't a half court scoring threat, why the hell would you want a ball dominant half-court guard when you probably have what could be the greatest half court scoring threat in Point Zion developing, as well as BI who's very competent in play making scoring in the half-court relative to his position. A low usage guard like Lonzo who spaces and defends while also creating easy buckets in transition is the perfect fit with Zion, he would have even looked better last year if SVG understood you need to have a higher pace with his personnel. It's like they want a third option to score 20+ points when they already have 2 25+ point scorers. Last year the team's major weaknesses was 3pt,  Defense, turnovers. So they got rid of their best defender and 3pt shooter, who has size, and not only fits with Zion but also fits their timeline. Lonzo has also shown that he gets better every single year, I will never understand them letting him go."
"even more, the more rope he gets teh better player he becomes. The guy like lamelo is a pusher transition player who just moves the ball forward and even if not hte direct assist, can hit the hockey assist and just keeps the ball moving.  I can't imagine any scorer,shooter, or finisher who wouldn't want to play with the ball brothers.  In fact I think horneys and MJ missed the biggest marketing and basketball opportunity on not overpaying lonzo like they did hayward and bringing him to play there. They'd get crazy exposure and national tv, move merchandise, and both those guys play in a way that may attract more stars and talent.  No one else is going to charlotte."
"Because he‚Äôs not the on ball defender or true point guard people think he is. He was twice as expensive as Graham was and wasn‚Äôt valuable in the half court outside of play connecting and inconsistent 3 catch and shooting.   I watched damn near every game the pelicans played last year until the end when I couldn‚Äôt. Lonzo rarely ever ‚Äúgot us started‚Äù on offense and was significantly worse at PG than Zion was.   He‚Äôs a good player, but people haven‚Äôt actually watched him a much and just go off of reputation. They say the pelicans wasted him, but he just had the best season of his career at a catch and shoot guy who play links and has good off ball defense. But that wasn‚Äôt translating to wins over 2 season, so we had to shake things up."
"exactly, this is the 2nd time the pelicans will lose their star bc of their decision making.  First was building around AD.  Their very best year with rondo in the playoffs he was raving about the difference it made playing with rondo and wanting to run it back.  Rondo himself said loved the feel of playing in that team and was even considering giving them a discount or edge, he said they never called. They signed Elfrid PAyton as the replacement because the ...box score?   Now zion, they are gifted another elite player and they are just doing terrible at building around him.  Lonzo was almos a perfect compliment bc he can switch to a 3/d for zion the playmaker, and then he can push the transition at anypoint to get it to zion the flyer.    Then they dropped the ball on the coach. SVG bringing in a detailed neurotic defensive coach for a bunch of young players made no sense. First they should've unleashed their youth and athleticism with a run n gun coach like MDA, then when their ready to take htatn ext step and go deeper in the playofs then you can get SVG.    Only question is will zion really not sign the obvious first extension and wait the usual 7 years or will he just not want to waste time and take a one year loss o money"
"I think LaVine's a great answer here. One of these games, when the teams feels comfortable with their record, he'll catch fire, and his teammates will realize that and let him have the ball as much as he wants. Great efficiency, already takes volume, Lonzo/Vuc/DeRozan are willing passers, and Chicago could really use a modern version of MJ to sell tickets. He has enough size and athleticism to beat doubles if needed and can get to the line too. Just don't let Coby White on the floor while this is happening."
"Look, obviously Devonte will play the traditional point guard role but the team is going to run through Zion and Ingram no differently then it did with Lonzo. If anything there will be more Zion.   But as far as the reality of point-forwards; between Draymond, Lebron, Kawhi, and Giannis this decade has been dominated by them. Zion is more like Kawhi in that he benefits from having a traditional point guard to run the offense. But if you seriously believe Devonte is somehow going to change the structure of the offense that dramatically I think you are forgetting that last year the Pelicans ran two point guards in their starting lineup lol.   Devonte is a shooter with a quick release. He‚Äôs fast, moves well off-ball, and will help spacing around Zion. Clearly he will play point but I think your misreading his overall purpose."
"Are the Bulls going to run line-ups of Lonzo Ball - Alex Caruso - Zach LaVine - DeMar DeRozan - Nikola Vucevic this season?  And if so, can we have all minutes of that lineup posted to this subreddit somehow? Because that lineup sounds like a blast."
"Can't stand the Ball family, BUT I have to say, Lonzo works on his game, doesn't talk shit, doesn't cause trouble, doesn't get into trouble, and he improves every year. I don't know how good he'll be over the next 5 years, but I would take him over a lot of other players in the league, especially BS."
I remember suggesting a trade for these two for Lonzo Ball in the Pelicans sub and got flamed
"He‚Äôs not a point guard and won‚Äôt admit it was the problem.   In the half court, he‚Äôs an off guard. Chicago bamboozled him into forcing his way there to be their PG then brought in Demar to ensure he has the same role there that he had in NOLA that he was unhappy with. I do think Griffin should have kept him at that number however Lonzo felt about it, though. He was a very good fit with point Zion off ball and as a transition playmaker. The issue was Ball‚Äôs desire to play on ball to further his career goals coming into conflict with his actual best role."
Except Lonzo Ball spaces the floor.  That‚Äôs not even a remotely comparable situation.
&gt;prime nash is a much much better playmaker  How so? CP3 averages more assists and less turnovers on a lower usage percentage to top it off. He also leads in all advanced statistics such as assistance percentage. And iso scoring is still important for a pure point guard? It's just making a play for yourself and without it you're basically lonzo ball.
lonzo ball in a decade /s
Dort  Ben Simmons  Marcus Smart  Jrue Holiday  Lonzo Ball  Kawhi  Giannis  Thybulle Butler   Caruso  Payton II
"If his arc doesn't plateau. This happens all the time and nba fans keep thinking that these curves are constant skyrockets   Melo is the most skilled, Lonzo defends and plays team ball. Value added between them is not ""by far"" in favor of Melo. Yet. Its probably even a toss up"
"Switch Westbrick with Jrue Holiday on the wizards last year and they would have made the second round at least.   Jrue, Trae, dame, unvaccinated Kyrie, Schroeder, D Fox, injured Klay, CP3, Elfrid Payton, Kyle Lowry, lonzo ball, lamelo ball, even Ben simmons are each &gt; Westbrick"

"Lonzo ""Kobe"" Ball"
Lonzo is the better Ball
If this was soccer Lonzo Ball would have to pretend he was just decapitated
Embiid accidentally *almost* punches Lonzo Ball https://imgur.com/1ikom1v.jpg
After reading that headline I HAD to watch the video.  Did Embiid punch Lonzo in the balls?  Did Embiid punch Lonzo in only one of his balls?  Did Embiid punch the ball away from Lonzo?  Ironically I didn't think it would be Embiid punching Lonzo Ball because of the lack of capitalization.
Lonzo Ball not Lonzo ball.  I thought Emblid had punched him in his nuts.
"I agree but you're basically saying ""lonzo ball needs to not be lonzo ball"""
"Ok, but lonzo is more athletic than Lamelo, so that should help him. Also lonzos ball handling is better than people give him credit for, he‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt have the confidence to show it. Look at his crossovers from high school and look how good his ball handling is."
"Lonzo ""Emperor eye"" Ball"

We need stricter rules to guard against players like Lonzo Ball headbutting fists like this
Lonzo ‚ÄúNeo‚Äù Ball
Dude Cade is a bad shooter. Also cant finish inside either. His ceiling is Lonzo Ball
"I watched Kansas games night in night out at the time because I like college basketball and because I am a phoenix suns fan and my team was awful at the time so I watched all the ""top"" prospects a lot. I understand it might feel like hindsight but like I said on draft night I knew we waisted the pick when we took him. I remember swearing up a storm with my friends I was watch the draft with that year. I wanted fox, Lonzo or OG Anunoby that year, Particularly OG. As I said at the time OG is what people think josh Jackson is. Before he was injured his sophomore year OG moved up as high as 7th on draft boards and if he hadn't tore his ACL he would have went top 5 instead of falling to 23rd or whatever it was.  and I knew OG was likely not gonna play most if not all his rookie year so we would have gotten a quality player and been able to tank again for luka. Sadly enough we got the 2018 #1 pick and didn't take luka. I'm not some amazing draft expert who is right all the time. Like everyone I get some things right and somethings wrong. But I was 100% right on pretty much everything in that 2017 draft class. It was probably my best draft year and thats unlikely to change anytime soon. I wasn't a believer in Markell though I thought he would be better than he is. I did believe in Tatum though I didn't think he was gonna be quite as good as he is. The only real thing in that class I didn't have the right read on was that I wasn't a Donovan Mitchell believer. Thought he would be a ok rotation guy.   And now that I basically put out all of my best draft takes ever here are some of my wrong takes so you know I am not just doing hindsight stuff. I believed Dragan bender was gonna be a star. I thought Jalen Brown was an awful pick at 3. I thought buddy hield was too old (that one taught me a good lesson). I thought Bamba was better than ayton. That one might still end up being true long term with how bamba has looked to start the year but its extremely unlikely if we are being honest about it. I fell too in love with sexton after the 3 on 5 game and had him over Trae. I wasn't a lemelo ball believer.   As for your point on the break. I believe Jackson is a better athlete then MacLemore and was in college. I am not arguing that he wasn't a monster on the break. He was at his best when he was borderline playing out of control. Which is how the fast break is played. its fast and there is space to make plays because there aren't 10 players at 1 end of the floor. The issue isn't nba schemes its that he can't be out of control and be successful in the nba because guys will take a charge or in the half court he will turn it over. I unfortunately have watch Jackson play in too many nba games than I wish to have seen him play in and his problem (at least when he was with the suns) isn't that he's overthinking. its that he isn't thinking at all. He is always trying to be that borderline out of control guy when the ball is in his hands. he almost wants to create controlled chaos. But he can't do that in the half court because teams are too smart, too athletic, and too disciplined for him to really let him create that kind of problem for them. And while he isn't the worst defender or even really a bad defender at all he can't consistently create enough turnovers to make his fast break skills a consistent asset for him. not to mention as the clip shows, he is a sub par finisher around the rim for nba standards"
"Thats by virtue of Russ being a legit nba guard, you could replace IT with Jrue Holiday or even Lonzo Ball and arguably add an additional 9 wins. IT was that bad  But i guess what‚Äôs impressive to you isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs impressive to me"
"Give him a tennis ball and he‚Äôd still be getting buckets.  Anyway, has Lonzo improved since they were claiming he‚Äôs better with the Wilson?"
"He was a ball mover which is (sadly) sorta rare for PGs today.  Maybe like Jrue or a maxed out Lonzo.  Maybe even his bro Melo a bit, actually."
"He‚Äôs honestly been fine on offense. He, LeBron and AD are all top 25 in usage and Russ is behind Lowry, Harden, Lonzo, and tied with CP3 in TO%. He‚Äôs high usage, high turnover but that problem is fine because the ball won‚Äôt be in his hands when it matters. Unless they start losing Russ‚Äô minutes where he‚Äôs in control of the bench by 15 then he‚Äôs doing his job.   His job is to not immediately lose the leads when LeBron sits. Theyre counting on him to lead 12-15 neutral minutes a game, because the rest of the game is on LeBron to manage.  If he plays exactly how he played last night when LeBron is present then he‚Äôs doing what they want.   The problem is going to be they are absolute dogshit on defense."
In a vacuum you could argue Lonzo is better than Graham but Graham can run the half-court better than Ball can
Still way too early to say on that front imo. Lonzo Ball is definitely more talented. I don't think anyone disputes that. Pelicans need consistency though and so far Graham has provided it. I agree with you so far. Will be interesting to see where they both are at by the end of the season when they've been able to gel with their teams more.
Lonzo Ball  Paul George  Rudy Gobert  Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo
"Damn Lonzo Ball has been super impressive defensively, but I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs been quite a top 5 defensive player lol."
Lonzo Ball over [insert like 10 NBA players here]? I can't take this list seriously
Lonzo Ball over Draymond?!?!
&gt; Lonzo Ball - UCLA + Chino Hills CA  Yeah. And you know. The fact that he was drafted by the Lakers and played for them for 2 years.
"The Chicago Bulls of Los Angeles  Lonzo Ball - UCLA + Chino Hills CA  Alex Caruso - Lakers Champion  DeMar Derozan - USC + Compton, CA  Zach Lavine - UCLA  Nikola Vucevic - USC"
"Per NBA rules, if the call is overturned play resumes based on the location of the ball from the moment the whistle blew.  [https://official.nba.com/rule-no-14-coaches-challenge/](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-14-coaches-challenge/)  see the bottom of the page.  When the whistle is blown nobody has possession of the ball, so jump ball is the correct call.  Reason for that is after the whistle players don't go for the rebound.  In this case you see Niang (number 20) initially turns to contest the rebound but stops when he hears the whistle allowing Lonzo to get the rebound and nobody interrupts his movement towards the basket because the play was whistled dead."
If it's a non-call lonzo has a wide open lay up. Chicago got screwed with the jump ball
"Def think the block is clean but I HATE the fact that they fucked the call up and ruined any shot for us to get the offensive board. Lonzo had a lane to it and a quick layup gives us a chance to win. The jump ball really just killed that chance. Such an anticlimactic end to a great game.   Obviously no given that we secure the board but damn, I‚Äôd much rather have a game end cuz we got out-hustled."
Lonzo ball
"Yes. This is a total non story that this media outlet is playing up. And a side note, the changes to foul calling are a big improvement. Lonzo Ball got called for an offensive foul tonight for trying to dribble into a defender that was behind him."
I wouldn't say that. Zach took hero-ball shots that we know he can make. Vuch scored FOUR points... and Lonzo had like back to back turnovers that killed momentum
"Embiid definitely got him with the body but that's not even the annoying part. Since the refs ""missed"" the call it ends up a jump ball even though lonzo clearly got the rebound. The need to change that shit."
Was clearly a block but because of the refs mistake Lonzo doesn‚Äôt get the rebound and it goes to a jump ball instead.  Wack.
"It was the same with the hype for Lonzo Ball. It was so obvious the guy's ceiling was very good role player and not star. The guy didn't have the ball skills and finishing touch in the half court to ever be a star player. As a guard, you cannot be a star without those things. His ability as a passer in transition, three-point shooting and defense makes him a perfect number 3/4 on a championship team."
"And your #2 option is out on health protocols, your other scorer in seth is also going to be undersized going against the ball hawks that are caruso (6‚Äô5), lonzo (6‚Äô6) and Ayo (6‚Äô5).  You thought your pg problems were bad? See how they fare against our PoA defenders."
"Lol I remember in 2017, he said Lonzo Ball was better than Steph Curry at the moment. Can‚Äôt blame Kerr for being annoyed"
Yeah it should be someone like Lonzo ball this year
"You wouldn't download Lonzo Ball or Kyle Lowry, would you?"
It‚Äôs worth it if it the punishment are as ‚Äúlight‚Äù as those penalties. What I don‚Äôt understand is did the Pelicans even want Lonzo? Couldn‚Äôt they signed Ball for cheaper last season?
What about Lonzo ball? He also changed his form and I think his shot looks much better now
"Not really. Other than Ja, and that one great year from Dipo, the last 10 years of second picks have been about 50% bust and 50% good but not great.   2020 James Wiseman  2019 Ja Morant  2018 Marvin Bagley  2017 Lonzo Ball  2016 Brandon Ingram  2015 D‚ÄôAngelo Russell  2014 Jabari Parker  2013 Victor Oladipo  2012 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist  2011 Derrick Williams  2010 Evan Turner"
"&gt; I think the best case scenario would be if somehow the Hawks could land Tatum to play alongside Trae and Collins.  I mean... how? This is an absolute pipe dream of basically unfathomable circumstances. Also I don't think it's really a good fit at all... Tatum is a number 1 or a KD style number 2 (meaning how on those Thunder teams, Westbrook might have the ball more and might occasionally shoot more, but KD was clearly the better player). Tatum can't be that next to Trae who is easily a number 1.   Tatum would be best with someone like 2-years ago Chris Paul or a Lamelo/Lonzo type. It might be a bit too early to tell on Lamelo, but Tatum needs a good PG who doesn't look to score first. It's a waste of Trae's scoring to pair him with Tatum. They're both #1s."
"The offensive fit with Graham is great. For fit, I'm really just talking about the defensive side of the ball. Graham is pretty big downgrade from Lonzo on defense."
"What? Graham is just as good if not a better shooter than Lonzo, and obviously not the defender Lonzo is, but its not like he cant play off ball as well. Not gonna argue with the talent, but I do not think fit is necessarily the problem as well."
"&gt; are you asking if I believe we should force a player to play for a team they strongly don‚Äôt want to play for? If so then yeah I tend to believe that‚Äôs horrible for the culture of a team.   I'm asking because you guys have two recent examples of players who didn't want to play for you, in Anthony Davis and Lonzo Ball. When AD asked out your team went scorched earth to try to force him to stay, and when Lonzo wanted out you guys let him go. So if Zion ends up wanting out in the next year, which approach do you hope the Pelicans take? You guys also similarly trapped Eric Gordon years ago when he tried to sign with Phoenix and publicly said he didn't want the Pels to match, but they did anyway. At least one of these approaches was the wrong one, as they're all in opposition to each other. If Zion wants out, what do you personally hope the Pelicans do?"
Lonzo can‚Äôt create his own shot. And yet he wants to be the pass first point guard that takes the ball out of Ingram‚Äôs (and Zion‚Äôs) hands.
"I mean, you replaced Lonzo with Devonte Graham who is a less talented player and a worse fit on your roster.  The Pelicans had one of the worst defenses in the league last year, so y'all decided to get rid of the one good defender you had on the roster and replaced him with an undersized PG that's a negative on defense.  Lonzo also slots in nicely next to Zion as a PG who can playmake occasionally but is also more than happy to play off-ball and be a spot up shooter. His fit next to your young core just made a lot of sense."
"Bulls: 6-1. With solid wins against Utah Jazz and Boston Celtics. Our only loss was a one point loss to the Knicks. And we even had the ball at the end to try to win that game.  I'm really happy with how our new additions are playing: DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Ayo Dosunmu, Derrick Jones Jr. They are hustling on offense and hustling on defense! I love how they play with a sense of urgency!  Special shoutout to Ayo Dosunmu who feels like an absolute steal at #38 draft. Especially since we didn't draft anyone before him this year. (Our first round draft pick was packaged in a deal to get Vucevic).  It sucks to lose Patrick Williams for the year. I hope he recovers from wrist injury as quickly as possible."
"I'm not saying Beal would. All I'm saying is Smart has value in a trade. What they do with that I have no idea.  But you know who would have helped? Lonzo Ball, or Chris Paul. Those are the right guys to PG Tatum and Brown. They really missed out on those."
"So far this year the Bulls have used Derozan a lot with the 2nd team, where he kind of plays the 4, sort of, except that DJJ or Troy Brown covers the better of the forwards, leaving Derozan to do what he does. In crunch time, yes, absolutely, he plays the ""4"" and they do some really big-time positionless basketball out there. I've seen Lonzo Ball covering a team's top forward in that situation - he was lined up on Julius Randle down the stretch vs. the Knicks, for instance. Zach Lavine has also kind of lowkey started playing good solid defense himself and so, again, Derozan gets to cover the least effective player 2-4 there (Caruso handles the 1 / point of attack although even there the Bulls have not been afraid of doing some ""blue"" coverage of him on bigs, by which I mean putting him in between the ballhandler and the big man when the big is in the post to deny him the ball).  I will say that part of positionless ball is that very often it's the guy who plays the ""4"" who is the less effective of a team's 2 forwards offensively because the other guy is a wing. So in that respect, sure, if you were to log his defensive matchups you'd probably see like 50% of those going to whoever is considered the 4 on the court. And of course, this is mostly what he did last year with the Spurs as well: basketball-reference lists him as 69% ""PF"" last year, though the same positionless caveats apply."
"It's not about the amount of attempts, but the quality and type of attempts. Both Gentry and Van Gundy allowed Zion to shoot 3s if he was open and the possession developed in to it. It's like Lonzo Ball. Ball in catch-and-shoot situations? A sniper. Ball on the run? Atrocious."
"What about Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and 3 firsts? You'd think that's better than a single player, right?"
"I wouldn't consider Westbrook to be a superstar at this stage of his career.   I think the better comparison is Anthony Davis. The Lakers gave up Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first round picks.  Then promptly won a title."
The Jay's remind me of VC and RJ.  One is a dynamic scorer while the other quietly fills the stat sheet.  They need that dynamic playmaker like a Lonzo Ball.
Lavar Ball deserves an award. 4 years ago NO ONE believed his sons would be must-see TV. Now Lonzo and LaMelo are precisely that. Bulls and Hornets are 2 of my fav teams to watch now and those boys are big reasons why
"As a fan of a team with a Ball brother, I honestly cannot recall hearing 1 word from lavar since we acquired lonzo."
"They really needed to get Lonzo. He gets players to share the ball, he's super low usage and has nice play making. Exact piece they needed."
"LAL scouting team (notoriously really good at finding gems) wanted Tatum but Magic vetoed for Ball. Don't me wrong, I like Lonzo Ball, but Tatum was the ***PERFECT*** fit for LAL."
"I don't disagree that he could be good, but y'all have 3 all stars. On top of that, you have Lonzo who needs the ball to run the system."
"The league isn't ready for when Lonzo ""Regigigas Slow Start"" Ball actually becomes not as putrid on offense as he always is at the beginning of the season  Even his ""bad"" defense in the first half was over blown"
"That just isn't true, Tatum against anyone for that long with no help defense is going to win like 9 times out of 10. Also the fact Tatum only had 20 on 22 shots should show that Lonzo is a good defender but also the Bulls play good team defense. Tatum is going to win some but Ball is going to win more often than a lot of other players. The other part to Ball's style of defense (high pressure, in your body defense) is it wears players down after a while. Yeah you may cook him a couple times but look how hard Tatum had to work to score that. It just isnt possible to do that for 4 straight quarters unless you're on a crazy heater. He isn't Ben Simmons, but I would put him top 5-10 defensive guards in the league right now."
"&gt;But calling less fouls means more defensive freedom. This promotes building more defensive teams as we have to remember, it's still a 6 foul limit. It's literally harder to get fouled out so players like Bev and Butler literally have the green light to go fucking crazy on D. And players like Gobert can start flapping their arms on repeat.  Eh, you're not looking at the actual rule change and instead looking at a grossly oversimplified sentiment. The rule changes don't impact how a defender plays defense, they impact how the ball handler plays offense. It's not opening the door for guys to start clubbing people, it's closing the door on offensive players staging for calls. That, in and of itself, isn't going to promote illegal defense - it will just stop punishing legal defense  &gt;But just the nature of potentially having more taller/bigger guys, more Fs, more bigger Gs like Lonzo/Simmons, we should also see the average career go down simply due to physics, bigger bodies, bigger knee problems, harder collisions   Bit of speculation, but whether true or not this is completely unrelated to the rule changes. Big guards like Simmons and Lonzo were notably *already present in the league, and successful* before this season"
"""Tatum got the r/nba highlight but we got the win"" -Lonzo Ball"
Bulls is 4 real and Lonzo Ball is turning into the perfect 3&amp;D point guard
"Probably, they can play together, actually Lonzo is kind of an ideal fit next to D'Lo since Lonzo can defend PGs, play off ball, has the size to defend bigger players as well"
Steph Curry Jimmy Butler Kevin Durant Giannis Antetokounmpo Nikola Jokic  Ja Morant Paul George Miles Bridges Karl-Anthony Towns Joel Embiid  Lonzo Ball Derrick Rose John Collins Montrezl Harrell Rudy Gobert
"Lonzo is a better playmaker imo. The fact that set half court offense doesn't fall apart completely for with him at the helm helps his case. Ben not being consistently aggressive in the interior, doesn't convert free throws well, not having a very good post game, and not shooting doesn't help his case as a playmaker.   Simmons has solid vision and passing ability, but I think what he contributes here at the 1 has been overrated for a while. It was an odd situation because we didn't have quality secondary playmakers and so he did have 'value' playing the 1, but not max money type value. He's regularly had sharpshooters and Embiid to dump off too and when he racks up assists it has often been a product of force feeding and getting bailed out.  Ben is skilled, but pass enough as a passive primary ball handler and you're bound to rack them up. Meanwhile one has to question all the offensive opportunities he didn't take or maybe just incapable of creating."
"Zach Lavine, Coby White, Lonzo Ball, Demar, Vuc.  Get to keep pretty much our starting lineup while also being able to continue the hopefully future core of Lavine, Ball, White"
"I haven‚Äôt watched enough of Lamelo to know how he stands up defensively to Lonzo, but I feel like Lonzo‚Äôs defense puts him a step ahead. Like he isn‚Äôt gonna bang 3‚Äôs back to back but he might prevent the steals that stop it from happening to him. I‚Äôm a big fan of the whole ball family after the drama stopped, they‚Äôre some fucking talented guys."
"This bulls team is just a combination of players that are not proven outside of the regular season and their 3 best players ultimately will need the ball in their hands down the stretch in order to be effective. Zach Lavigne has never even been on a winning team his whole career so I think the assumption that he‚Äôll take the leap, while possible, makes the bulls an easy team to sleep on. People citing defensive metrics and whatever forget the fact that it‚Äôs only 6 games into the season, yeah they came out hot but down the stretch of the season when injuries pile up and more teams get their schemes in order, I don‚Äôt see the bulls making that much noise. Lonzo ball and Alex Caruso are not enough together to anchor a defense, and I don‚Äôt know how the bulls will ever hope to stop someone like giannis or Joel embiid. So yeah, I think everyone‚Äôs high on the bulls because they started 4-0, I‚Äôll be more interested in evaluating them once they drop a couple of games and face adversity to see how they‚Äôre responding."
My dream was Garland for Lonzo Ball.
At 5/100 that's a no brainer even if he ends up as the 6th man/Ginobli role of being a walking bucket as no one else on the roster is going to command a big contract.  Even Garland is going to top out at Lonzo Ball's contract with his current play considering he might be better offensively but Ball is 100x better defensively.
"[rookie Lonzo was blazing fast. he was a top rated prospect in terms of speed with the ball and end to end speed](https://youtu.be/XOcMJ-SR92M)   [on defense he was amazing early on too. insane motor and ability to move ](https://youtu.be/3KUt1KBeh5w)   I‚Äôm not overrating him, you literally just didn‚Äôt watch him lol anyone who actually watched Lonzo at the start of his career can see how those ankle injuries and knee injury have added up to slow him down a bit"
"I know Lonzo Ball was an awful defender in college, but is now a great NBA defender. But that also could‚Äôve been Zo just not trying at the college level lol."
"Too bad he‚Äôs still your first option lmao    Bro got clamped by Lonzo Ball, randles a second or third option on any actual contender"
"In order I‚Äôd say:        1. Heat: the defense is definitely top 3 at worst and guys like Herro and Bam are looking like they‚Äôre in for career years. Lowry hasn‚Äôt found his footing yet but he will so that‚Äôll only help more. I‚Äôm not entirely sold on their offense quite yet but they‚Äôre certainly much improved overall and will put up a fight against anyone.      2. Knicks: I‚Äôm biased cause I was high on NY coming into the year but I really like what they‚Äôre doing so far. Randle is wildly effective and they might be the deepest team in the East, the bench has made the difference in some games and that‚Äôs been without Noel. Also looks like RJ Barrett has taken another step so maybe he‚Äôll finally start getting the credit he deserves.      3. Bulls: I‚Äôll start off by saying I think Zach Lavine is an elite scorer and does not get nearly enough credit for how good he is. After that you have some nice additions in Lonzo and Caruso which can give any guards in the nba a tough time. I‚Äôm very biased on Demar as well, I just don‚Äôt see it with him. He‚Äôs a very mediocre playoff performer and gets tunnel vision sometimes. They‚Äôve played a fairly easy schedule so far so hard to gauge but Utah was a nice win and they were right there with NY. My biggest concern with them is their big man depth. Vucci mane is rock solid but he‚Äôs not a difference maker defensively and there‚Äôs not a whole lot after him. When it comes down to it how do they stop Giannis, Embiid, KD, etc?       4. Wizards: I‚Äôm not particularly high on the Wizards. Not a bad team and I think they‚Äôll make the playoffs but clearly below the other 3 teams listed here imo. I like the bench, seems like the Westbrook trade was a huge win. My issue with Washington is I‚Äôm not sure Beal or Dinwiddie are good enough to carry them. Yesterday was a really good example of how their ceiling is capped with those two mostly looking to score first as opposed to spreading the ball around. I will be interested to see how they look whenever Rui comes back and Gafford gets healthy."
Tbh I think Mitchell was cooking AC all first half but they were definitely avoiding having Lonzo being the on ball defender on Donovan
Lonzo Ball and Caruso are a fucking nightmare on defense. Mitchell couldn‚Äôt breathe in a 2nd half.
"Why are you guys downvoting this man? He is not wrong.  Of course they‚Äôd lose to the Knicks who have Lonzo Ball,  Kyrie and Zion. But that‚Äôs besides the point. 2K logic is dumb as fuck."
"Bro here are the players that might not even be top 50 players right now(or at least it‚Äôs close):  Tobias Harris, Lonzo Ball, Clint Capela.  I don‚Äôt know how you can think Donte has that kind of upside."
"But we did develop them  Lonzo Ball 9/5/5 on 40/33/41 splits and 48 TS% in his last season with us but those shooting numbers were all improvements from his first season with us.   Randle - 16/8/2 on 55/22/71 splits and a 60 TS% his last season with us. And he was a legit good defender that season as well. He was developing every year with us. We just didn‚Äôt sign him because we got LeBron. A decision that I think was moronic.   Kuzma - 13/6/2 on 44/36/69 splits and 54 TS%. Looking at his numbers you wold think he regressed do to him putting up good scoring numbers his first 2 years with us but his role changed every year and he was a professional about it. His game evolved and now he‚Äôs a solid player. He can rebound, pass, somewhat defend and shoot. I think we developed him pretty well considering he never had a consistent role   Ingram - 18/5/3 on 49/33/65 splits and 55 TS%. He improved every year and his shooting was getting better during the end of his season. If we had build as a rebuilding team there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind he would be this teams leader right now. But we got LeBron and in return we went straight to championship mode and traded our young guys. That got us AD and a ring. I won‚Äôt complain about that but man it sure did hurt seeing Ingram get traded. He is one of my all time favorite players.   Caruso - we developed him into a legit great role player lol. His numbers don‚Äôt do him justice so I won‚Äôt post them but saying we didn‚Äôt develop him is moronic.   Clarkson - we developed him as a scoring combo guard lol. He was one of our best scorers for a couple years. He fell off a bit when he first got traded but he was always a a great spark plug   Russell - he put up better numbers in his second season with us. Magic never liked him so we traded him to unload the Mozgov deal. But he improved with his time with us.   I don‚Äôt get why people think we suck at developing talent. We developed Bynum, Kobe, Fisher, Eddie Jones, NVE,  Vlade, Nance, Farmar, and a bunch of other good players that stayed in the league for a while. That‚Äôs not even mentioning high draft picks like Magic, Worthy or Baylor."
That‚Äôs such shit luck and yes its a bad play by Mitchell and you can blame him for it as he interlocks with pat and brings him down which causes pat to turn and all the weigh come down on that hand.    Anyway in other news will give you Cody and jalen for lonzo ball that way you get a 4 and an upgrade over lonzo and the 3 bs will be in north carliona
"It is because Julius Randle playing selfishly and forcing things at the end.  He didn't like Lonzo guarding him, thought he could take him every time.  So he demanded the ball.  Then when he had gotten his 9th assist he was triple double hunting and the offense boiled down to JR kicking it to three pt shooters instead of just find the open man."
Year one he didn‚Äôt play w/ another ‚ÄúSuperstar‚Äù  Lonzo Ball  Michael Beasley  Isaac Bonga  Reggie Bullock  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope  Alex Caruso  Tyson Chandler  Josh Hart  Andre Ingram  Brandon Ingram  Jemerrio Jones  Kyle Kuzma  Scott Machado  JaVale McGee  Mike Muscala  Svi Mykhailiuk  Rajon Rondo  Lance Stephenson  Moritz Wagner  Johnathan Williams  Ivica Zubac
"The amount of contract they took for westbrook is enough to pay Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso correct me if im wrong. And they could also sign Whiteside over Jordan, right?"
CJ makes miles more of an impact on offense than Lonzo. ESPECIALLY in the half court. We all know iso ball is more important in the playoffs and CJ is a super reliable scorer. He‚Äôs never even had a decent dude setting him screens in the playoffs.
"lol Kuzma does not have to be a number one option. He isn‚Äôt the number one option on the Wizards and he‚Äôs doing just fine. All I said was the offensive system revolves completely around LeBron and that isn‚Äôt good for player development. He turns other guys into complementary specialist because he doesn‚Äôt play off ball that much. A guy like Curry helps younger players develop better because he doesn‚Äôt dominate the ball as much as LeBron. You see this happening now with Poole breaking out. He also hasn‚Äôt forced the front office to sell their future to compete now. The Warriors got Poole looking good and are looking set up to be alright in the future with Moody, Kuminga and Wiseman. LeBron with his heliocentric scheme and intolerance for rookies does not make for a good situation for Kuzma to be in or any young guy for that matter because he forces them into a simple role. That‚Äôs why Lonzo, BI, Kuzma, Kyrie, Jordan Clarkson and others broke out after separating with LeBron. They had more freedom to expand their game and we‚Äôre free of the LeBron centric system."
"Dejounte Murray, Marcus Smart, Lonzo Ball, and Gary Trent Jr. are all guards who are better defenders than curry too.  &gt;Not to mention, through 15 games Stephs D isnt bad and could improve, it has been anyway  His defense has been solid for a few years, he exerts an impressive amount of effort on that side of the ball. It's part of what separates him from players like Lillard. He's still not close to being an all-defense selection though.  &gt;I dont think he will get all defense, but its just stupid to say he cant.  I didn't say he can't. I said it'd be possibility because voters love him (e.g. 3rd place in MVP voting as a non-playoff team last year). I could definitely see him getting the nod over somebody more deserving like Vanvleet or Trent Jr."
Pelicans forward lonzo ball
"Yup, you can kinda see when it happened for Lonzo after all that drama with big baller brand. Hopefully his brother follows his example. While not a hornets fan I live out here now and want a good local team to cheer for.    Ball has always had the best of the best growing up, his dad admitted to ""breeding"" them for the NBA. Kinda like how Dirk parents did all kinds of crazy science things on him as a kid."
I like Verno and KOC theory that Lonzo has always shot better with the Wilson ball in college and is now popping off in the nba because of it lol
Shouldn‚Äôt that be [CHI] Lonzo Ball
No steph is just a better off ball defender hence why he led the nba in steals one year and his stature and intensity makes him a liability on pnr.   You can't teach defense... most defenders are born super athletic or aren't the main scoring option and put more effort on that end. You know-&gt; mj and then guys like Tony Allen.   Brook Lopez went from a post scorer to catch n shoot. Lonzo % went up and up each year.  You can aquire a jumpshot.   You said 3 season he shot above 35%. Also nobody said he was amazing. Just a better then demar.
"Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, Fournier, DeRozan all were S&amp;T's"
"Look at their latest downfalls too.  Lost Lonzo Ball for nothing. Julius Randle for nothing.  Jrue Holiday for Steven Adams (via OKC), Eric Bledsoe (via Milwaukee), two future first round picks (via Milwaukee), right to swap two additional first round picks (via Milwaukee).  Steve Adams for Valcunius, Eric Bledsoe to clear salary cap space to sign nobody.  Unable to keep Zion in game shape, Zion has repeatedly shown disgust with the team and is likely to move on when his contract is over.  Brandon Ingram will probably leave too."
"Lonzo Ball if he keeps up his 44% 3pt clip and the Bulls keep winning. If they are able to lock down a 4-seed or better, I could see a first time selection for Ball alongside nominations for DeMarvelous and LaVicious. #AllHailDeBallZach"
"Or maybe I just evaluate the players different. Idk that seems more logical than not caring about winning no?  Like I think Lonzo is a little better than Graham, but he was wildly inconsistent and didn't play defense to the extent he's clearly capable of, and clearly decided he wanted to be elsewhere. So with all that in mind, I don't really buy any of this value about being close with Zion. So I'm fine with having Graham who has some ability to put the ball on the floor and make things happen in the half court."
I personally really appreciate them taking Lonzo Ball &amp; Brandon Ingram over Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown
How much of that is just a by-product of time? Like Lonzo 3 point shot improved once he decided to redo his form. Its not like he just went to NOLA and everything was magically fixed. His FT for example has steadily improved (by product of time). But lonzo as a whole is still a very limited player with poor ball handling and no driving game. Citing how he developed a 3 pointer and blaming it on the Lakers doesn't make sense when his other flaws are still so apparent.
"Stop. They don‚Äôt like facts. Magine being up 18 in the third quarter and calling missed fouls on Lonzo fucking ball ‚Äúcompletely game defining‚Äù. Meanwhile any time nas took it to the rack he got mugged with no whistle. They didn‚Äôt call shit either way. Also, bulls had a chance to tie with a wide open Lavine and he missed the shot, why was he that open? Because the screener walked from here to Chicago taking nas with him, which guess what? Didn‚Äôt get called. I‚Äôm all for calling the refs out, but nah‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not why we won this game, that was a hell of a team effort to bring this shit back from the edge."
"Lonzo was great but I feel like he has never beat Dame? Dame had a 50 ball and game winner on an And1 on Ball vs the Pelicans in a 20 point come back last season and Dame always lit up Ball on the lakers. Always a fun match up between them and Ball played great defense, it‚Äôs like Ball not meant to Beat Dame or sumn lol"
Hear me out.   Rajon Rondo -&gt; Lonzo Ball   Ray Allen -&gt; Zach LaVine   Paul Pierce -&gt; DeMar DeRozan   Kevin Garnett -&gt; ALEX CARUSO
Booing former Lakers is what we do here. Lonzo Ball
"Bulls small ball line up is full of vertical athletes: Lavine, Derozan, DJJ, Javonte Green  Pat Williams when healthy and Lonzo are pretty nice too"
"To be fair, David Griffin had to let go of Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday to be able to get the right players around Zion. Their money could‚Äôve gone to the right guys, could‚Äôve even signed someone like Lonzo Ball or Jrue Holiday!"
"I'm thinking Lonzo Ball would be an amazing fit. Not expensive, not elite, but a great shooter and a very good perimeter defender."
"The fact that Lonzo Ball is not on this list after what he is doing for the Bulls is incredible.   Draymond is well deserved, for sure. Myles I'm not entirely sure since I haven't watched too much of him, can't be sure if he's just chasing blocks or if he's actually just playing great solid defense across the board and gets blocks as a result. but GTJ?? Nahh..."
"...With the way coaching is going it's gotta be someone whom stars respect. As insane as this is, my guess for good coaches would be...  Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, Seth Curry, Jrue Holiday, Andre Iguodala, Udonis Haslem, Spencer Dinwiddie, Fred Van Vleet, Lonzo Ball."
"I disagree. I understand the argument, because a point guard makes a lot of difference. But it's not like the team falls apart when Lonzo is off the floor, they have several capable ball handlers and passers. In fact, it's arguably Lonzo's defense and three point shooting, more than his passing, that has made him so valuable.  On the other hand DeRozan has saved the team several times by getting much needed points when the rest of the team struggles to score. You can even put DeRozan out there with four bench players and the team will usually perform quite well. And when the defense collapses on DeRozan, he finds the open shooter.  That said, it's great that we can debate who is more impactful! Both of them have exceeded my highest expectations."
"The thing was, last season Bulls were 11-14th in defensive rating metrics, middle of the road with guys like Lauri and Coby. Billy Donovan is a good defensive coach. People were not realizing that Vooch is not a rim protector but he hold his own defensively in the paint. His real issue is being exposed on switches and being pulled to the perimeter.   Our best defender outside of PWill was Garrett Temple and we upgraded to Caruso and Lonzo. It was obvious we would be better on defense, but I would be lying if I saw us being THIS good.   Basically my point is people boil down defense to on-ball defense and nothing else when in reality its a lot more complex and heavily can be influenced by things like defensive scheme and coaching."
"This is an unusual subject heading for an unpopular opinion thread, but I'll bite.  My unpopular opinion is that the Warriors still aren't the favorites to win it all.  I don't question that they are playing well, but they've also had the easiest schedule in the NBA.   There really aren't any clear favorites this season. It's a rare season where the race for the championship is wide open.  Now, I wish you had put your takes in the comments so I could address them there.  I'll just respond to your comment about the Bulls since I follow them most closely.  Lonzo Ball has definitely played better than Vucevic so far this season, no one would dispute that. Ball has arguably played even better than LaVine, but remember LaVine is playing through injury.   DeRozan has been the most impactful player, though, able to score at will and decent on defense as well. Plus he offers that veteran leadership that rights the ship any time younger players start to lose their cool."
"Praise be to Lonzo Ball, champion of unselfish basketball üôè"
So...Lonzo Ball? LOL!
I mean the truly elite playmakers are also elite scorers  obviously I would take Rudy Gobert over Lonzo Ball but due to not having scoring gravity he doesn't crack the top echelon of playmakers
I don't get that line about Bulls.  The Bulls weren't good last few seasons and now they are good and this might be a complete co incidence but I think it was because this season 2 players called DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball were added.  &amp;#x200B;  Are you saying the 11th seed 31-41 Bulls were a good team?  Or the 13th seed 22-60?
"Of course it boils down to fit. DeMar fit the Bulls better because LaVine can play off the ball. Lonzo plays off the ball. Vooch can play off the ball. And DeMar right now can play off the ball too, because he is making spot-up threes.   Lakers has players that need the ball to be effective. LeBron, AD and Russ need the ball in their hands.   Rondo, Dwight and Melo used to have the ball in their hands too. So it‚Äôs kinda tricky when it comes to chemistry. Because these players are not used to play off the ball. And there‚Äôs only one ball in the game."
"Buddy Hield , Russel Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle. And that's just on the Lakers. LeGM is LeBrons worst enemy."
Lonzo ball
"Well he's definitely better than guys that didn't show up on OP's list like Devin Booker, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, LaMelo Ball, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, SGA, Tyler Herro, Kyle Lowry, Anthony Edwards, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Cole Anthony, Fred VanVleet, Dejounte Murray, Darius Garland, Dennis Schroder, Tyrese Maxey, Spencer Dinwiddie, Ricky Rubio, and Mike Conley.   Westbrook is definitely better than 100% of those players, right?"
"It just so happens that the person closest to him is always westbrook and AD isn't a good enough passer to look for anyone cross court. We put DJJ on him who's very long and able to disrupt passing lanes while Lonzo, Lavine and Caruso were digging at the ball once AD brought it down low"
"Lowry was the better PG. They would've kept Kuzma and Harrell also.  Just don't know why the Lakers traded for Westbrook of all possible PGs they could've got. He's the only one who has a unreliable 3-pt shot, is older, and has questionable defense.  They could've went for Lonzo Ball instead with a sign-and-trade and made out better. Lonzo's shooting 44% from 3-pt land this season... that's higher than Westbrook's 42% overall. That and Lonzo Ball is a much better defensive player also + isn't as ball dominant."
He might still be a top 50 regular season player but I‚Äôd honestly rather have point guards like brogdan and even lonzo ball over Westbrook lol
He went from having Dejounte Murray &amp; Derrick White being the best players on the roster besides him to Zach Lavine &amp; Lonzo Ball. Defenses were ecstatic when pretty much anybody besides DeMar tried to score in the half court especially in crunch time last year but you can't do that with the Bulls cause they're just far more talented.
"I don't think they fit.  Playing together likely not all of them reach their current level. Even if we assume they do, they don't seem to mesh at all. Randle, D'Lo and Clarkson are all ball hogs. Ingram and Lonzo,  would likely take a step back in order to work, meaning that likely your best two players don't produce at max level.  Also the L.A spotlight are very hard to overcome(the criticism) or even if you do - the next thing is the star complex. I am not entirely sure that Randle, Kuzma, D'Lo and Clarkson could share the glory."
"Lonzo ""I'm the captain now"" Ball"
Most Laker fans loved Lonzo Ball and didn‚Äôt want to see him go but also understand that if not for Zo we would not have gotten AD.   It‚Äôs the Pelicans who didn‚Äôt value what Zo brought to the table.
I thought the title said Lonzo Ball at first and I agreed.  Especially considering Lonzo plays D
"The usage rate point is extremely dumb. That‚Äôs not how it works.    Lonzo is an elite role-player, a Swiss Army knife. A spot up threat, transition playmaker, keeps the ball moving and while not a lockdown defender, he‚Äôs still a menace. But he‚Äôs not a player that can ever be a 1st/2nd option cos of his lack of handle and scoring ability.   Unlike Lamelo, who‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs got the potential to be just that. Elite playmaking ability and potential of a scoring game that Lonzo just doesn‚Äôt have.   Right now Lonzo might be the better player but Lamelo‚Äôs in his 2nd year and definitely has a higher ceiling."
"exactly! stars only get you 60 maybe 90 points at best (if they are absolutely amazing every night of the season). You need role players to fill up the rest of the 30-50 points every night.   [in fact demar and lavine are the highest scoring duo in the nba so far this year, and they are averaging only about 50 to 60 points a game](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2021/11/10/luka-doncic-mavericks-outplayed-by-lonzo-ball-bulls-in-streak-ending-defeat/#:~:text=CHICAGO%20%E2%80%94%20Entering%20this%20matchup%20of,at%2053%20points%20per%20game.)"

Lonzo Ball scored 1 more point than Zack LaVine with ***NINE*** fewer shots
"I think what a lot of people are missing is the refs never wait for the opposing team when you inbound after a score - it's how Kyle Lowry gets so many quick outlets. On the other hand refs always wait for defenses to be ready in deadball situations.  This wasn't an inbounds after a score, but visually it was very similar with the rest of the Lakers and Bulls getting back up the court and Bradley asking for the ball on the baseline to inbound to Lonzo who was by himself in the backcourt.  I imagine the refs lizard brain took over in the similar circumstances which is why he gave up the ball over to Bradley, when he should have held onto it.   It's understandable, but the ref is still at fault and AD had a legitimate gripe."
have you ever considered the fact that Lonzo isn‚Äôt capable of creating in the halfcourt or running a PnR offense nearly half as well as Lamelo is the reason why Lonzo doesn‚Äôt have the ball as much
"You have to take age and experience into account with these kinds of comparisons. Lonzo has been in the league for a lot longer, so of course he's going to have an edge on things like off-ball plays and defense.   People say Lamelo is better because he has the potential to be a lot better than Lonzo based on how he has been playing. That's also the reason he has such a high usage rate - his team sees that he is already exceptionally good and trust that he will get better."
"Guys chill out‚Ä¶ Bulls are like top 3 teams this year, and Lakers were without Bron (who truly would have been a game changer against that specific small ball team). I saw some good things today, Lonzo will not shoot that well every day."
"LaMelo has can do so much more on the ball. LaMelo‚Äôs handle, finishing and pull up game is better making him a much greater threat at all ranges. That allows him to compromise the defence and create more open looks for his teammates. Those three things also make him a better pick and roll player.   Lonzo has to play more off ball because of those limitations, his jump shot is much improved but he really has to have his feet set and can‚Äôt shoot unless he‚Äôs standing still. Until he develops the ability to shoot with even a little bit of movement his offensive ability will lack the fluidity that he needs to become more of a focal point in an offense."
&gt; but he's not terribly efficient on offense  Lonzo has a TS% of 52 right now lol and horrible efficeincy. 17% of his possessions end in turnovers (really atrocious for someone who isn't a primary ball handler)  this sub is kinda weirdly inflating Lonzo right now
"Lonzo appalled, Spalding Ball, balding, Alex Caruso taking balls from y'all"
"Not sure if true, but lonzo shoot well because of the wilson ball.  fckn A."
"He‚Äôs a dog on defence and some games shows legitimate all-defensive potential. Already had a 6 steal and 5 steal game this year, hes a special defender on and off ball. Great passer too, astounding court vision. He can shoot the 3 a bit now too, 40% on 3 attempts.   He‚Äôs missing any sort of offensive game within the arc. He relies on floaters that suck ass. That‚Äôs his biggest inhibitor on offence - but I really like him and think he‚Äôs got a ton of potential to be a good NBA player. A Lonzo/Smart type of player.  Important to note he‚Äôs only played like 38 NBA games, not even half a season! Basically still a rookie."
"After watching Lonzo, Brandon, Josh and Alex today and in previous games this season here is my ranking of the 2017-2019 Lakers ""core""  Brandon Ingram  Kyle Kuzma = Lonzo Ball  Alex Caruso = Josh Hart"
"lol...the best season they had with AD was with Rondo. He sung praises of the difference of having the vet in the playoffs in their success, rondo himself said he loved what they created and was even considering pelicans of a discount, but they never called.      Instead they went with Elfrid Payton...because his box score stats were close enough?    Didn't blame AD for not wassting away after 7 years of management not holding their end of the production while he was and and nba shelflife is short, they all realize  thats why I also predict Zion will be out and has lost trust in competent management.  You take this young fast team, and hten you gve them a veteran detailed defense coach like SVG and it was another misstep. You get them someone who will let them use their youth, athleticism ,energy to run n gun and cacuse trouble on that and then when they take the next step in the playoffs you get SVG.        Likewise with Lonzo, maybe not a better pg fit than him for zion who can smoothly move to a 3/d while zion the playmaker does his thing and guard 1-3 at a high level.  Otherwise he continues to move the ball in transition and creates easy complimetns to zion.  They let him go too with an option to match.  Redick, who has a top notch reputation as a pro, called griffin a liar and won't deal with him again.      In what idea was it professional For griffin to call out Gentry and publicly say ""I gave him all the answers to the test and he still failed"" Coaching is a small faternitiy, he continues to lose trust with players, coaches, and maybe even fans.  I was a big fan of his in cleveland, but he has jumbeled this up and fallen short too often, as they did before with AD.  In this era, players know they can't wast their time with bad ownership/managemetn and careers can pass you by.  Pelicans have managed terribly."
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo would be a great fit on the Lakers lmao. High-efficiency guard who can defend and shoot without demanding the ball
Lonzo ball shooting it like he‚Äôs Steph
Highly inefficient 25/6/7 from Westbrook vs highly efficient 24/6/7 from Lonzo Ball. Yikes
Lonzo Ball is the Kwisatz Haderach.
"Can‚Äôt deny I‚Äôve really started to like the Ball brothers ever since Lavar shut up and has stayed out of the media. Lonzo particulary, lovely to see him become a great player after getting memed to death in his first season or two."
Lonzo ball shooting has improved so much
"Lonzo ball is literally the greatest basketball player of all time, this is t up for debate"
My name is Lonzo Ball   I play basketball
Lonzo Ball sheesh
FUCK YOU ROB PELINKA FUCK YOU LEBRON LONZO BALL IS A BIG BALLER
I feel like Lonzo heaves the ball a lot does he not care?
"I don't think this thread is necessarily typical. Mobley and the Cavs are generally well-liked at the moment, but look at any similar thread about a Laker, James Harden, Kristaps Porzingus, etc and you'll see a whole different thread.  In years past I saw some of the worst, most reactionary takes ever in similar posts about rookie Trae Young/Brandon Ingram/Lonzo Ball/Jaylen Brown. I'm sure Hawks and Celtics fans haven't forgotten those. I think these posts usually feed into the worst parts of this sub's collective psyche and drag down the level of discourse."
If you think Lonzo is bad you're just a casual that watches stats. Ball is a huge reason Bulls are playing elite basketball rn.
"&gt;but it was pretty clear on ownership's side that they didn't want to pay him what the market said he was worth, and that was pretty clear to Ball early in the season.  I'm not attacking him for this, I want the dude to be happy because he seems like a decent bloke. But his market value was not good value for us as a team. We've gotten better production from Graham (even if it doesn't necessarily show in the stats) this season than we ever had from Lonzo at half the price.   &gt;which All-Star caliber players would be a good fit  Lonzo is nowhere near being an all-star and if you think he is then you've clearly never sen him play. I think he'll have a good career and maybe may an all star or two but he isn't worth us financially tying our hands.  To be clear, I don't think either path really moves the needle all that much. It all comes down to what happens with BI, Zion, and who the team can get with that warchest of picks."
Lonzo Ball has actually always been one likeable dude  Any team would want him as a great role player in their starting 5  Well... except the Pelicans
"&gt;And the player the Pelicans need based on this team would be a Jamal Murray,  Shai, Fox, etc, not Lonzo. We need guards that can create offense for themselves and others. Lonzo is more of a wing than a PG in the half-court.  If you're actually trying to build around Zion, I thought having the ball in his hands worked pretty well last year, in which case someone like Lonzo fits better than Murray/Shai/Fox"
"""They seem to think the Pelicans could've kept Jrue Holiday if they wanted to, via extension. Likewise, Lonzo Ball was restricted.""     They obviously didn¬¥t. What they are trying to say is that they lost both of those players without getting adequate value out of it"
"You mean James Harden with elite defense? Yeah I agree, he didn‚Äôt give Killian enough credit. Jokes aside though, he‚Äôs still not played half of an NBA season yet and has been improving steadily since his first few. I think he projects to be similar to Lonzo Ball."
"I agree that Lonzo can be that person if he was a primary ball handler ever,  the thing is his turnovers arent wonderful, so he hasn't even been the ball handler for the bulls. They have demar and zach. Same happened with the pels, zion and bi. Personally, the pels should stop trying the point zion and get a god tier pg because then we'll be winning. Just waiting 4 years till zion and ja team up literally anywhere"
"We had SVG who wanted to play really slow last year. Willie Green wanted to play faster, but that starts with defense which we haven‚Äôt been consistent at yet. Hopefully it gets better as we get healthier.  BI had the ball a lot last year because SVG basically played through BI and Sion and had everybody else watch.  I just call non star players role players. Lonzo is definitely a good player, I‚Äôm just saying he‚Äôs not as. Great of a fit for us as he is for the Bulls.  We definitely didn‚Äôt use Lonzo to his full capacity, but we were using him for what was best for our team at the time. It‚Äôs not like we had a ton of shooters for Lonzo to pass to."
"Some false parallels here.   Lonzo was playing as well last year as he is this year. And Jrue was already great.   Neither Middleton or Dinwiddie looked as good, and they were traded, as opposed to Ball, who they let walk.   Celtics trading Kawhi for Jaylen? I'm not sure that's a good trade. It's be a one-year rental and Leonard was a crap shoot in term of health. Hindsight says the Raptors won out, but that was a big gamble   The Cavs not trading a player is different than letting a player want. Granted, it was boneheaded, but Amare's health was a concern too."
Agreed on the last part.   As for the first - Lonzo is one of a handful of point guards in the league who can truly set a pace for a team. They are few and far between these days with most PGs being scorers in this recent era. He is a true throwback who creates tempo and gets his team easy baskets.   There‚Äôs also an element he brings to a team that people who didn‚Äôt play wouldn‚Äôt understand. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily show up in the stat sheet. Guys know he will get them the ball when they‚Äôre open. They know he will get them easy buckets. That‚Äôs contagious. You want to play with people like that. It makes you want to be unselfish too. Guys will run their lanes a little harder. They‚Äôll make that extra pass that they maybe wouldn‚Äôt in other circumstances.   There‚Äôs a chemistry that creates. The Bulls are basically a brand new team and look at how quickly they‚Äôve gelled - that isn‚Äôt the norm. Generally it takes the first part of the season for guys to mesh together. The Bulls look like they‚Äôve been playing together for years.   I think too many people just look at the stat sheet and see that his numbers are pretty average and judge him off of that. There‚Äôs things he brings to his teams that don‚Äôt show up in the stat sheet that are equally as important.
"The Jrue note by windhorst is a reach but it doesn‚Äôt take much to realize Lonzo fits well with Zion being a good shooter, help defender, and transition ball handler. But the Jrue move was the correct thing to do."
"I didnt watch many Pelicans game, so maybe I'm wrong but I think their backcourt needs consistency. Lonzo could have great games, but sometimes, maybe the shots doesnt fall, maybe he lose too many times the ball, but he seems a ghost on the court. Same with Holiday. I think they Need some real pg that can settle the pace of the team everytime, even when he's playing bad, someone like Rubio, Cp3 or Dinwiddie.   But first of all they need Zion and BI getting back, that's probably the most important thing"
"Won‚Äôt lie. I wasn‚Äôt a huge Lonzo Ball fan when he first came into the league. Didn‚Äôt have anything against him but didn‚Äôt think he should be a top pick in the draft.  Love seeing the evolution of his career and I‚Äôm extremely happy to have him on the Bulls. Dude plays hard, worked hard to develop his shot, and is a humble human being. I would be happy if he stayed with the Bulls for the rest of his career."
"Well what kind of point is the Lonzo point you're making?  Windhorst is saying the Pels made a bad move in letting Ball go.  You're saying, ""that's a lazy point, we just didn't want to pay him.""  Maybe they should have shelled out for him.  Point guard is a position of need for the team"
"Now people need to stop shit on Pelicans. What they need now is just getting back Zion and BI and see how the team perform. They dont need Jrue or Ball, we've already seen the fit, at least with Lonzo, and wasnt that great."
"Lonzo's situation isn't that simple. NOLA could have paid Lonzo, they could have kept him but decided early on last season he wasn't worth the money and tried to low-ball him. He only left because he felt like the Pelicans didn't value him, and he was right. NOLA has sour grapes because they thought they had a chance to get him back and Lonzo had a new deal about 2 seconds after free agency opened. NOLA out here looking like a bitter ex-girlfriend with their tampering investigation. That's what happens when you burn bridges through poor management. I don't know how many times the Pelicans must learn this lesson as an organization, but maybe this is the last time? Probably not though."
"It‚Äôs almost like you had Lonzo Ball, cap flexibility and assets to put together a team that wouldn‚Äôt go 2-12 regardless. BI has played 7 of 14. That‚Äôs not ideal but iirc the Lakers literally played with ‚Äúguys‚Äù for two months last year and did better than 2-12 in that span.   Just saying this roster is built like it was supposed to be bad on purpose. Zion can‚Äôt save inextricably poor team building and planning bro."
"Lonzo Ball in any scenario, unless that scenario is secondary scorer off of the bench, tbh.  Ball does everything well. Rozier tries to do way too much on offense and is prone to tunnel vision."
"Got clowned? Do you realize how dominant Lonzo was in highschool and even in UCLA he was looking special. Shot was ugly, but effective and he was always a fantastic playmaker with high defensive upside. I never saw him being a superstar cause of his ball skills in the half court set and lack of a go to move."
We‚Äôll see how it works out in the long run I guess. I thought Lonzo would be a perfect fit with BI and Zion. I see him as more of a 3 and D SG who can be another ball handler and not a point guard on offense. All they would‚Äôve needed to do was get a PG.
How did a guy as humble and down to earth as Lonzo come from Lavar Ball
On this sub there were tons of Pelicans fans saying they wouldn‚Äôt touch Lonzo at 20 million and that giving up a first to get Graham and Sato  was better value because apparently Graham can do 80% of what Lonzo does for cheaper and it preserves their cap space. You got mass down voted if you brought up Zion wanting Lonzo and Lonzo being a perfect fit with 2 ball dominant guys.
"When Rozier is playing his starting role next to LaMelo, he is a near-perfect fit for our starting 5 and I think he was statistically the most clutch player in the league last year.  It goes to shit when he's asked to create for the second unit and make decisions with the ball. It's like if you asked Klay Thompson to facilitate, it's just not part of his skillset.   Terry has had a rocky start to the season, he sprained one ankle in the preseason and the other in his first game back, so he's been understandably rough, but he's looked like himself the last 3 or 4 games and been key to our last couple big wins. I'll take him over Lonzo on this team, but I'd take Devonte' Graham at less than half price leaving enough room for a better center than Plumlee over either Terry or Lonzo"
"Attended the game and it was awesome! It felt like there were almost as many Bulls fans as Clippers fans ‚Äî as a Bulls fan myself, it was a great feeling.  DeMarvelous DeRozan was so dominant all game, but in the first half he was automatic. I‚Äôm starting to see comments here and there about him being a dark horse MVP candidate, and while that‚Äôs an optimistic take IMO, his impact for this team cannot be understated. He keeps the offense afloat when the bench is in (bench mob has a lot of high energy guys but no real playmakers while Coby White is out), and he‚Äôs a real calming presence with the starters which really showed on nights like this. Every time the Clippers pushed to within 5 or so down the stretch, the Bulls answered. When we just needed a bucket, DeMar got one for us. The team was poised under pressure and pulled off a solid win on the road. This sort of thing never happened in the last few years. Usually, it‚Äôs just Zach playing hero ball (out of necessity), and when his shot wasn‚Äôt falling (as it wasn‚Äôt in the first half tonight) we‚Äôd fall apart. But with DeMar, Zach doesn‚Äôt need to force as much and can focus on hitting the big shots he‚Äôs now proving he can hit.   Then add in Lonzo looking like a bonafide sniper and Caruso locking down everyone. Plus high motor guys in Javonte Green and Ayo Dosunmu off the bench. This team is so much fun to watch.   I‚ÄôM HYPE, NEIL FUNK!"
"I could see Lonzo working well with LaMelo since he doesn't need the ball that much, can space the floor and is a great defender. Rozier can shoot too and take some pressure off LaMelo having to do everything in the half court offense though. Can't really go wrong either way imo"
"Depending on what your goal is. In terms of championship I‚Äôd go Lonzo. Better defender, good shooter and keeps the ball moving. Easy plug-and-play."
"I always liked Lonzo. people gave him a lot of shit because [REDACTED] Ball is such an obnoxious ass, but him and LaMelo always seemed like good kids at the end of the day. really happy for him that he's being appreciated in Chicago"
We really watched the Ball family come all the way. Lonzo is guaranteed 100 mill+ in contracts right now and LaMelo is bound to get a max extension. Their family will be settled for many generations to come.
"Yeah I was predisposed on hating both him and his brother because of how obnoxious Daddy Ball was, but honestly they're both pretty likable guys. Lonzo just super chill and laid back and Lamelo is a big goofball."
"Without him, I think we would be around .500, probably below.  Signing him (along with freaking Lonzo Ball and AC) brought on one of the most radical changes we‚Äôve ever had from free agency. I‚Äôm pinching myself thinking about how we suddenly have prime Demar Derozan on our squad‚Ä¶ It was glaringly apparent that the Bulls needed veterans to help Zach propel this team into the next era of winning games and I feel soooo lucky to finally have a top-tier front office who are already knocking it out of the park. It feels like Chicago is a FA destination and that‚Äôs crazy."
"Jordan and Lonzo ball- Jordan played with Kwame Brown in 2001, who played with Nic Vucevic  in 2012, who plays with Ball."
"LeBron had question mark over his half court game? Really?   Also.. His shooting only had question mark once team decided to rather have him take jumpers where he might miss 6 times out of ten. Instead of allowing him to get to the rim where he was almost automatic, and got you in all sorts of foul trouble.   I think Miami LeBron developed a reputation of being a bricklayer. But the dude was nowhere near Simmons level of non shooting.    I think Simmons' shooting woes resembles much closer to beginning season Lonzo. But even then it's not the same because Lonzo actually shot the ball."
Dads trying to interfere with NBA coaches are the worst. He‚Äôs a grown ass man. Let him grow up without your mess ruining his image forever. See Lonzo Ball.
Lonzo as of now. But LaMelo looks like he can be the best Ball brother of the three of them.
"Lonzo was playing goo defense, Siakam threw the ball away"
"Lonzo was playing goo defense, Siakam threw the ball away"
"can't post up Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Kemba, and now Lonzo Ball  has he tried spinning?"
"MB3 needs to just straight up cut his father out of this whole equation, Lonzo Ball style. Or this is going to lose him money over his career."
"&gt;You‚Äôre ignoring the fact that the Lakers were barely a .500 team when LeBron played.  THEY WERE MISSING ALL OF THEIR STARTERS FOR DOZENS OF GAMES EACH.  Keep reading that sentence until it sinks in.  &gt;if LeBron hadve been healthy all season  Look up how many times James has missed the Finals.  &gt;same with Lonzo, Ingram, and Rondo  You are missing some people.  Like Caldwell-Pope, who we know now is good enough to be a starting guard on a championship team.  And JaVale McGee, who now has three rings.  And Tyson Chandler, who was also on that team.  And Ivica Zubac.  They would've been a nightmare matchup for someone like Denver, for example, with all those bodies to throw at Jokic.  They had very good perimeter defenders too -- James, Rondo, Hart, Ball, Caruso.  If they were healthy, they would not have been fun to play against, and James has certainly taken lesser teams to the Finals.  &gt;Over the Nuggets, Rockets, Blazers, hell even the Thunder with prime PG and Russ.  The Thunder won just 49 games, and bowed out in the first round in 5.  Denver needed 7 to get past the 48-win Spurs, whose best player was DeRozan.  None of those three teams were better than these Lakers, if they were healthy.  The Nuggets would've had a big matchup problem, as noted above.  Houston would come down to Harden versus James, and I, for one, would not be betting on Harden in that matchup, and I would have history on my side.  &gt;Also chill dude it‚Äôs a friendly debate in reddit comments no need to attack me like that Jesus  Welcome to reddit -- when you talk out of your asshole, someone is likely to call you on it."
It took me this long to look at the names Lonzo Ball/Eric Bledsoe next to each other and say ‚Äúwait what the heck is going on here‚Äù
Bronny will be the lonzo ball of lebron james
I‚Äôve been a Melo hater for over 15 years now and still find this incredibly disrespectful.   Nevermind the fact that this kid hasn‚Äôt proven shit yet. Even if Lamelo somehow has a career that supersedes Melo‚Äôs - the name is taken.   The way Lonzo is playing it won‚Äôt be long before we can simply refer to him as Ball and everyone will know who you‚Äôre talking about. Same number of letters. Less syllables. It‚Äôs a no brainer.   For now - he‚Äôs Lamelo. Now get off my lawn!
"The trade may have turned out to be one of the most fair trades ever. Truth is that for it to work out for the Lakers it had to result in a championship or it would‚Äôve been a loss. They got the chip and the peels now have Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart plus picks to go with Zion. The Pelicans may come out ahead in the long run depending on how good of a job the FO does to keep this squad together and win championships.   Either way it worked out pretty well for both teams"
"Lonzo ball just don't got it. Every player dont got that ""IT"" in em. He a joke. He can't control a team an instill confidence in his players. He like a character from sesame street running around on court. Nobody take him serious. He gotta become a man."
I don‚Äôt know if this is a reference to the Lonzo ball YouTube video but I hope it is
I still remember when James Harden at the height of his powers tried to post up Lonzo in his rookie year (or sophomore?) and got the ball blocked right back into his face. Lonzo is legit a good defender.
"This isn‚Äôt the thread for this but I think that trade has merit. It‚Äôs selling low on Bledsoe for the Pels but it works for both sides.  Assuming the Pels keep Lonzo, PatBev would be a great fit next to him. They need all the spacing they can get around Zion and he‚Äôs a career 40% shooter from 3. Lonzo is also big enough to guard the 2.   Bev also plays defense to a similar level of what Bledsoe provides and he can also be a nice secondary ball handler. Clippers get some semblance of a playmaker."
"You mean when he was with Brandon fucking Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, Kuzma, Rondo, KCP, and co? They were at least proven NBA players who had couple of seasons under their belt, we are fielding undrafted players, rookies ans G-leaguers, come on man."
Jason Kidd and Lonzo Ball
"PatBev and salary filler. That‚Äôs selling low on Bledsoe for the Pels but it works for both sides.  Assuming the Pels keep Lonzo, PatBev would be a great fit next to him. They need all the spacing they can get around Zion and he‚Äôs a career 40% shooter from 3. Lonzo is also big enough to guard the 2.   Bev also plays defense to a similar level of what Bledsoe provides and he can also be a nice secondary ball handler."
He is easily the most talented Ball brother.   Not as athletic as Lonzo but much more skilled and because to his size it does not matter that much .
"I say this as a Ball boy stan that Lamelo also came in with nowhere to go but up, whereas Lonzo ended up being set up for failure. He is definitely hitting his stride a little more now. If he can stay healthy he could become elite in a few years of good development. Also, I am excited for Lamelo."
The Lonzo Ball
It's very evident he is a much better ball handler than Lonzo ever was. He can get to spots on the floor much more efficiently

LONZO BALL IS THE GREATEST NBA RAPPER
Yeah Eric bledsoe needs to move to a six man role and become more of a super energy guy turning his defense into transition points. Starting guards have a hard time moving the ball against him imagine him going against back ups most the game. I also like him coming off the bench as he is more aggressive than lonzo.   We have a fairly deep bench rotation between bledsoe jj and hart. With naw in the starting lineup he falls down in the scoring order and should allow him to be more efficient. It also opens up the lane for zion. NAW catching a corner three is way more dangerous than Eric bledsoe.
"Lonzo, Hayes, bledsoe, 2024 Lakers 1st, 2025 Milwaukee 1st, 2027 Milwaukee 1st, plus Milwaukee 2026 pickswap, and if they don‚Äôt like ball enough add another Pelicans 1st. I‚Äôd throw it everything we can to have the Beal, BI, Zion trio"
"Did Durant go to Germany? Also, George Karl is a former coach who never won anything. The players he coached calls him a snake in the grass so not all his opinions can be peddled as facts like what you‚Äôre doing. If Lonzo Ball is already on steroids with the way he‚Äôs playing, that would be absurd.  This narrative is just created by unfit individuals who are jealous that they can‚Äôt be NBA players or who have never experienced being an athlete. While I do agree that a few have used PED‚Äôs, majority don‚Äôt."
When will people realize Ben Simmons is just a taller and older Lonzo Ball.
Those are Lonzo Ball numbers
Lonzo Ball played his whole life and can't shoot.    Giannis didn't play his whole life and can't shoot.
"6ers dropped the ball on that.  That'd be the equivalent to the Lakers saying sorry we're not giving up Ingram or Lonzo (at the time) for AD.  If you got a championship caliber team that just needs that one piece, you take it and run.  If and by the time Maxey develops into a solid player, who knows what the team will look like"
*^Cough*  6'6 point guard Lonzo Ball
"It's fine to have a player like that as long as he doesn't have the ball in his hands.   Lonzo is a good defender, decent spot up shooter and high IQ playmaker. He should be like a poor man's Klay with better court vision, but his stroke isn't as pure and he doesn't focus on his strengths"
"Harden - eyesore to watch, flopping  KD -the hardest road  Lebron - he's got haters, always will  Paul George - shit his pants in the playoffs  Beverley - loudmouth  Smart - flopping  Kyrie - crazy af  Draymond - had some dirty plays in the playoffs  Lonzo Ball - annoying Dad  Morris - shady moves"
Lonzo Ball
"This is probably not what this thread is for, but honestly, on the ""high end""-- as far as drafted high-- I'm still waiting on KAT, Ayton, and Lonzo Ball. All for different reasons and to different levels. But for a while there, people were saying they'd take KAT over Davis (wrong on that one!), calling KAT the best big man in the league... Hasn't happened. KAT has had some high points and justified his draft position, but I don't think he's All-NBA right now (I'd take AD, Joking and Embiid over him) and he really hasn't fulfilled his potential-- why do we (justifiably) dump on Wiggins but give KAT a pass? Secondly, I know it is early still, but I'm not overly impressed by Ayton. Having CP3 there should help his development, but haven't seen enough consistency yet. Yes he's young, but yes, I'm still waiting for him to ""break out.""  And honestly, Lonzo Ball is a disappointment. He's a decent player, but has not justified his draft position.  We should learn at some point with these guys who can't shoot (see: Simmons, Ben) that it's not always as easy as ""oh, get them in NBA with a shooting coach""..."
Simmons will imo be a Lonzo Ball/Jrue Holiday/Kevin Love type player on a contender.  He just doesn‚Äôt have the all around game to be a 1st/2nd option.
"Did lonzo ball do that on a 62 win team where he was the 4th option while making an All-defensive team, playing at one if the slowest paced in the league"
12/6/8/2 isn't great. Is Lonzo Ball great?
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo ball would have half a season left on his deal and a good opportunity to leave them with nothing.
I mean the only other person I can trust other than pelicans fans and lakers fans is lavar ball himself. So I guess lonzo is absolute garbage
Blake Griffin  PJ Tucker  Aron Baynes  Ben Simmons   JJ Redick  Devonte Graham  Lonzo Ball
"Lonzo Ball shot a blistering .375 last year, confirmed better shooter than Trae, suck it Atlanta. /s"
Im gonna name them all  Lonzo Ball  Ayton  Ben Simmons
Lonzo Ball
I feel vindicated for shitting on Luke early and often. In a couple of years my Lonzo Ball shitting on will also come to full fruit.
"Trade Bledsoe eventually, let NAW, Ball, and Lewis play.  In the mean time, use Bledsoe and NAW as energy guards off the bench and let Lonzo be more of a ball handler in the starting unit. Hopefully. Lewis can get his time soon when he deserves it"
"My god, I knew his passing was good, but I also thought ‚Äúif passing is his main skill isn‚Äôt he basically just Lonzo without defense.‚Äù  How wrong I‚Äôve been, the kid is an exceptional halfcourt passer, much better finisher, and can handle the ball and break down defenses. He reminds me of a less athletic Ja."

"&gt;a low usage player is scoring less than high usage players  shocking development, really.   other players with less than 0.2 points per touch who also rank high on touches per game: Chris Paul, Lonzo Ball, Marcus Smart, LaMelo Ball.   i wonder if there's a pattern emerging here."
Honestly I think randle would've gotten there regardless because that's where the NBA was headed to during that time with the Warriors dominating with Green as a C. Could be wrong but I know for a fact that ingram's development happened because he had little choice. We didn't start seeing Ingram being more of a ball handler till Lonzo was out for an extended period of time.
1. Jokic     2. LeBron 3. CP3  4. Ben Simmons 5. James Harden 6. Luka  7a. Lamelo Ball 7b. Lonzo Ball  9. Domas Sabonis 10. Dame Lillard  HM: Facundo
Simmons is trash considering his hype. He‚Äôs a slightly better version of lonzo ball at this point due to his height.
Rookie Lonzo Ball type beat
"I think Bens biggest strength and weakness are one and the same. He actively won't look to score the ball when there's other options available. For all the shit Lebron gets for ""Not having killer instinct"" and ""HE SHOULD HAVE JUST DROVE THAT TO SCORE NOT KICK OUT TO DANNY GREEN"" etc. it's 10X worse with Ben. Now on good teams, this is fine. He is actually really good at getting people involved in an offense, he can make an early swing to get actions started and we're seeing him used as an offball screen a bit more this year. But we're not seeing him setup to ISO. We're not seeing him in that pinch post as much as he should. We're not seeing him POST as much as he should. But when he is in these spots he does good things.  &amp;#x200B;  Most good passers in the League that people like enable their passing by being able to create their own offense. That's not really who Ben is. He's more of a Rubio, or Lonzo than he is a Lebron. In my opinion these types of players are significantly better player makers than a Harden or whoever you think of that's not Lebron - because they operate and run systems incredibly well. The NBA has moved away from this a ton so it's not appreciated as much, but it has a lot of value. I would hope to see a time where Ben does actually realize he needs to carry more of a load and attempt to create offense for himself but I also wouldn't mind the idea of him being able to succeed while being who he is.  &amp;#x200B;  tldr ; He can make use of a ton more skills, but he doesen't opt into using them or is asked to use them most likely since his team is so much better."
Thats Lonzo ball numbers
New Orleans is the same. A lot of people here have no idea who Lonzo Ball is but they can tell you the names of the third-string QBs. We're also one of the most [tuned-in](https://twitter.com/NBCSportsPR/status/1347258310077112322) football fanbases in the country.
"Don‚Äôt even put Lonzo in the same conversation with him at this point. Lonzo ball can conduct an NBA offense, Green can barely play on thats is rod the ball."
He‚Äôs a shittier Lonzo Ball at this point.
"Lavar is an asshole and says a lot of shit but he is his kids number 1 cheerleader and i admire that. Also Lonzo and Lemelo seem like the complete opposite. Sometime I wonder if he hyped them so loudly because are both mild mannered and quiet and he wanted some hype around them. But I like both the Ball bros, both seem like good kids and their games are fun to watch."
You forgot Lonzo Ball. As a rookie he averaged 10.2/6.9/7.2. Lol how did you leave out Lamelo's own brother
Dante Exum was a failed version of Lonzo Ball before Lonzo Ball was a failed version of Lamelo Ball
You keep saying winning one title at the cost of losing multiple titles like you have some sort of crystal ball and you know for a FACT the Lakers would have won multiple titles and that‚Äôs just not the case. If you can definitively prove to me that LA would have won multiple titles without the trade (which you can‚Äôt) then you‚Äôll be correct.   I like Ingram I was hoping the Lakers would Keep him instead of Kuzma but he‚Äôs not going to be an all star and average 25 a game on the Lakers. I love Lonzo but he is injury prone Josh Hart is a regular player those draft picks are nothing right now. The Lakers pre AD were good enough to make the playoffs and are finals contenders because of LeBron and LeBron only. People didn‚Äôt think LeBron and AD would be the Clippers would you have been more confident with LeBron and Ingram?  Also please tell me what year LeBron won a title with less talent than what the Lakers would have been cus I wasn‚Äôt here for it  And your lottery analogy is not at all on par the lottery is 100% random luck and lottery tickets are what? 2 dollars? I don‚Äôt see how that compares at all here
"Kuz isn't good enough to be in this discussion, but to answer your question no. There wouldn't have been a bidding war for him entering the draft. Kuz also got a lot of minutes.   People are claiming Fox, Tatum, Fultz and Lonzo would all want to play for the Lakers or two other teams.  This is nonsense, and I'm so confused why people can't see it. There is only one ball, 48 minutes, and 15 roster spots."
I really want Lonzo to go the Hornets. A ball backcourt just sounds so exciting and fun.
"&gt;Lebron tried to play off ball his first year with the Lakers and let Lonzo be the primary ball-handler and Ingram set up the iso scoring plays. Guess what? He went right back to being Lebron.   Because they sucked? Of course he tried to play ball dominant, that team was at the bottom feeder."
"&gt;Lebron tried to play off ball his first year with the Lakers and let Lonzo be the primary ball-handler and Ingram set up the iso scoring plays. Guess what? He went right back to being Lebron.   Be a little less disingenuous next time. Surely you don't need anyone to explain \*why\* that happened, do you?"
"Players are who they are. Lebron tried to play off ball his first year with the Lakers and let Lonzo be the primary ball-handler and Ingram set up the iso scoring plays. Guess what? He went right back to being Lebron. Steve Nash hasn't shown me whatsoever he knows what he's doing as a head coach. So I don't see how miraculously Kyrie is going to be doing catch and shoot threes, scoring off screens, etc."
No more fuckin Lonzo Ball minutes Stan.
"In other news, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and Lonzo Ball are not suiting up for the Lakers tonight."
"Gonna copy and paste my comment:   You think a guy like Lebron, whose the best player in the world and one of the most calculated superstars ever, didn‚Äôt know he was going to leave?  You think he just woke up one day after the Kyrie trade and said ‚Äúyeah, I‚Äôm going to go play with Kuzma and Lonzo Ball.‚Äù   Him and Wade constructed the Miami team all the way back during the ‚Äò08 Olympics. They wanted to play together 2 years before they actually could.   In fact, they set up their contracts AND even tried to get Melo to set up his contract so they‚Äôd all hit FA at the same time."

Can we interest you in Lonzo Ball &amp; Eric Bledsoe?
&gt;they've moved him off ball as a spot up shooter and a secondary playmaker. I don't think the Pelicans see him as a long term part of their future especially with the way he's played so far. I think he needs a new team.  That's exactly how he should be used long term though. Lonzo has historically struggled because he's a non-traditional PG who gets shoehorned into a traditional role.   You don't want Lonzo running PnRs or trying to ISO. You want him creating within the flow of someone else's offence.
"I just think Lonzo is a good guy to keep the ball poppin. It's not gonna stick in his hands like it does with Murray. And with Lonzo, Murray has more freedom to run off screens to get open shots. In crunch time you go back to Murray and Jokic two man pick and roll/pop game"
Sounds more like a better Lonzo Ball.
"It means he lacks agressiveness. Can‚Äôt play like Giannis if your mentality is Lonzo Ball, even if you have Giannis‚Äôs body."
Huh? Lonzo is the only PG on the team besides Kira Lewis Jr. at the end of the bench. Bledsoe is a small ball SG.
Luka is more of a threat to Lebron than Giannis lol Giannis will never be anywhere close to lebron because he can‚Äôt shoot. I wasn‚Äôt hating on him. It‚Äôs a fact that he sucks in the playoffs compared to his regular season.   Giannis passing the ball and them missing shots didn‚Äôt make him shoot 13% worse from the field. That‚Äôs like the difference in Lonzo and Curry. And he scored 7 less points a game while playing 9 more minutes a game. You are clearly biased because Giannis was ass just like last year.   Lebron succeeds in spite of his teammates. Lebron in 2018 had far worse teammates and was putting up 33-9-9 on great effeciency. He took that team to the finals. You are projecting buddy.
"Andrew Bogut also had NCAA and NBA experience **before** playing in the NBL but I guess that doesn't matter yeah?   You think the NBL is a bush league, Australia is the #3 team in the world according to FIBA.   LaMelo Ball had a radical development compared to most prospects yet he still is performing consistently across leagues.   And anyone with an eye can actually see that LaMelo is a much better offensive prospect than Lonzo, he's actually does drive to the hoop and tries to finish compared to Lonzo sometimes settling for bad shots on the perimeter instead of driving.   &gt;Another factor is they are both 2nd draft in their own draft class.  Zo is 2nd and Melo was 3rd."
"Where do the Ball brothers rank among active NBA brothers?  I got em 2nd  1. Steph and Seth 2. Lamelo and Lonzo 3. Giannis and Kostas (or Thanasis) 4. Jrue and Justin (or Aaron) 5. Brook and Robin 6. Marcus and Markieff (yeah I know that's disrespectful, but they're slacking this year) 7. Cody and Caleb 8. Jalen and Jaden (yeah the McDaniels are worse than the Martins)"
"I don't think there's any hard stats on ball handling. Also, different players thrive in different schemes. Pelicans play at a slow paced whereas Lonzo is more of a transition type player."
&gt; Ill compare them once Lonzo is allow to play point for more then 5 possessions a game.  Have you considered the reason for that may be that he isn't a very good ball handler in the half court?
Because I watch them? Because lonzo was getting more assists when he was handling the ball? I don‚Äôt know... maybe those reasons?
Idiot forgot about Hayward lmao. Also Lonzo is playing with 2 ball hungry emerging superstars its gonna be hard to consistently score in that situation so he's doing everything else well
"Lonzo ball. You need 10 points, he‚Äôll get you 12-15 points.  You want him to score 20? He will still get you 12-15 points with 1 free throw."
Eh still think lonzo ball is better. Defense = good but lamelo is cool. Lavar is the best B-ball dad in history
Zo - Lonzo Ball and Alonzo Mourning  &amp;   Melo - LaMelo Ball and Carmelo Anthony
"And like Lonzo is literally one of the chillest players in the league. Dudes been in no scandals, doesn‚Äôt even celebrate on court, humble in interviews, and if you seen them old Chino Hills videos before the Ball bro‚Äôs were even famous, Zo is goofy asl (so is Melo lmao). I get people gettin irked by Lavar, and I can see why some people may dislike LaMelo (he did have some issues in Lithuania and a lil after but I don‚Äôt blame him he was 15-16 lmao), but like Lonzo has literally done nothing lmao. He‚Äôs as professional as they come."
"how good would a team of all ball brothers be? lonzo, lamelo, liangelo, lil dicky, cb3  best d1 team probably"
Wow. Melo doesn‚Äôt even shoot that many FT‚Äôs. He actually still sorta shies away from contact around the rim. He‚Äôll get to the line more as he fills out his frame for sure.  Can‚Äôt believe Lonzo has only made 112 FT‚Äôs in 3 or 4 years or whatever...that‚Äôs actually shocking. I‚Äôd have put that number much higher just off the virtue that he‚Äôs a lead ball handler.
"i think for the reason you specified it would be easier on lonzo. i can only speak from my experience but it was clear as first time parents mine were learning as they went and i‚Äôd the best they could. now by the time my brother was born both were deeper into their careers and had done it all before. it was the same with sports, i didn‚Äôt start playing ball until I was like 7 but by that time my brother was born and got to see me play at an early age. it makes complete sense that he ended up being better than me"
Lauri for Lonzo     We don't have a primary ballhandler to protect the ball and find guys in their best spots. Zach and Coby are trying and it's not great. So no one is getting maximized. We can score enough without Lauri.
"they don't have Adams defending the ball-handler (makes sense I think bcuz Pelicans employ drop coverage mostly) but for the rest of the Pelicans starters, Bledsoe is in the 72nd percentile, Lonzo 43rd and Ingram 98th.  Zion's is a pretty small sample size for both, 40th percentile on the roll man, 0.7th percentile on the ball-handler."
"The Lonzo-Zion pick and roll was absolutely deadly last night, they got like 4 easy as pie buckets in the first quarter, but always in the second half (and usually in the third quarter when the game can swing either way) Ingram starts dominating the ball and taking shot after shot. Sometimes they go in, but as you've proven not as often as Zion's."
"Yes, but the difference between AD and most superstars is that he has limitations as a team creator and possession controller. Not an indictment on him, just the realities as a big.  Notice how in the example you have, you are using Lonzo ball to create offense to help Zion. There in lies the exact problem I was talking about, what happens when teams shut off the lob or stops the pass to Zion... suddenly Lonzo is in charge of shooting/scoring/making all your offensive decisions."
"The pelicans had poor coaching for most of AD's tenure, a bad bench, etc. There are many reasons for their poor performances and AD is not one of them lol  ""watching the stat sheet"" sorry that you made a dumb general statement that's easily disproven by stats.  ""Those Pelicans had a huge problem closing games!!!"" Yeah a +46 plus/minus for AD in the clutch surely means that he's the problem in closing games...  Shot creation is overrated if you're inefficient. A 44% TS% is awful. And an offensive system can easily make it far easier for zion to get looks, but it's not doing that  Furthermore, you seem to think that the only option here is to iso with the ball in your hands. It's not lol. The lonzo/zion PNR was working extremely well last night, for example (i assume you didn't watch the game) but they went away from it down the stretch."
"Honestly, as another older siblings, even if I and Lonzo say that Lamello is better, knowing that your younger brother is better than you at something really hurts the pride in a serious way.  Especially when knowing as the Older child, all the experiments are being run through you first before the better lessons can be given to the younger. Honestly my heart goes out to Lonzo and I hope this doesn‚Äôt get him messed up, but the Ball family seems tight enough that it just might just turn into a joking sort barbs at eachother."
Jealous edgy teenager trying to ride mj's dick. Why cant we have people who only has 1 goat. Its not fair. Everyone has different skills. You cant just compare them to jordan. People hate lebron for being a bum. I dont know if its personally or on the court but you disrespect the man wheter its on or off the court. I swear mj stans are calling lebron lebum because they are insecure that lebron surpassed jordan on all time scoring list. Why cant we just appreciate greatness. You dont have to call a individual player as the goat because everyone have different set os skills. I hate that people always compare a rookie to one of the goats. Why cant we just let them develop them at their own pace. Look what happened to lonzo ball. He got so compared to kidd curry and magic so much that it broke all of his confidence. People has so much expectations for players. And the bandwagoners... those motherfuckers. They hate on a player instantly but when a player has a great game they ditch the player they love and changes into a fan. I hate those type of fucking bastards who cant even have patience for the players. If you even call lebron lebum thats fine. Because he wont see a nobody talking shit about him. Im looking at you Ade ToVAR from youtube.

Lonzo Ball
This was the Lonzo ball Lakers envision having lmao
I‚Äôll forgive nba fans for that year that lonzo ball finished higher than Dame
"Lonzo being the best out of the Ball brothers, being drafted 2nd, then struggling in the NBA kept LaMelo humble and made him work.  &amp;#x200B;  Do I need to explain further?"
Please no. Don‚Äôt want any ball on the Dubs ever since Lavars ‚ÄúLonzo is better than Steph curry‚Äù comments.
Lonzo Ball &amp; Willy Hernangomez
"You mean Lonzo ""Big like klay shoot like steph"" Ball?"
The gap in three-pointers made between Curry (1st) and Dame (2nd) is about the same as Dame and Lonzo Ball (30th).  Steph is absolutely insane.
Still a mediocre shooter at 35% on 5 3PA. Also his career avg is 14 pts as a starter. Lonzo Ball is a bench player is averaging 13.9 ppg. Lonzo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Lonzo Ball is truly Steph curry with 40 inch vertical.
Do y'all really want more ppl who need touches? Zion seems like he could use more and BI already needs the ball a lot as is.      I'm still waiting on that Lauri for Lonzo to happen.
"If lonzo ball becomes only slightly more selfish/aggressive on offense, he‚Äôs be a borderline max player based on free agency in past seasons."

"Im talking with how they play. Ingram and zion should be the two best players but they arent playing like it consistently. Zion with his defensive lapses and lack of playmaking skills, handles, vision. And ingram for shooting them out of games and not moving the ball. Aint even a fan of lonzo but he gives the ball out immediately to swing swing and make the right play but the ball never comes back and Ingram usually takes tough shots and misses them. That‚Äôs what happened in the third."
"With all due respect. Did you watch the game? You‚Äôd understand that lonzo is the most important player on that team (next to ingram WHEN ingram decides to play team ball and not be a ballhog). Zion comes close and can be their best player if his playmaking can improve (tunnel vision, handles are iffy, can‚Äôt control the ball in the post against good defenders). Bledsoe and ingram is holding lonzo back. Good on SVG to bench bledsoe in the 4th but too late."
"They should give Lonzo ball, Brandon Ingram, and Josh Hart a ring too. Those guys had a bigger contribution than Cousins. If it weren‚Äôt for those three the Lakers wouldn‚Äôt had gotten AD."
"Ingram hero ball at the start of the 3rd killed all of the flow for the team. Lonzo really isn‚Äôt creating his own looks much anymore as he‚Äôs been relegated to 3 and D with secondary ball handling duties, so the ball has to move in order for him to get his looks in."
"In Philly's situation yes it wouldnt be how I would use my resources I was just listing the first guys that came to mind top of my head and had to probably reach for one or two(there arent that many for Philly's needs that are cheap). I dont expect any meaningful moves, Bjelica for the exception is probably about what we're talking if that.  As for Lonzo Im not really a fan, he's not a half court playmaker really, he just has too many other limitations that restrict his ability to do that. Really the optimal path to Lonzo being the best player he can be at this stage is largely being a 3+D guy who throws cool passes in transition and cuts off ball. Ben Simmons already does the stuff he could add to this roster better than he would"
"People just don't know how fucking hard it is so make free throws consistently when you never get to the line.   Remember when Rondo got hurt and became scared to take the ball to the rim? He went from a normally bad free throw shooter (62.1% through his first 8 years with a high of 64.7%) to one of the worst free throw shooters ever (39.7%).   It's nearly impossible to be consistent at the line when you're only getting there like once every other game at the most.   Lonzo just got past a 5 game stretch where he didn't get a single free throw attempt. He averaged 12 shots a game but only 4 inside the arc, and even less at the rim. Lonzo is a shooter. He avoids contact, he's bad at creating contact, and he's bad at finishing through contact. Just a total recipe for horrible free throw shooting when you're already a bad freee throw shooter."
"lol D Wade kept calling Lonzo Ball ""Alonzo"" and Candace had a little fun with him about it. I think the crew is fine this thread is a little over the top. Sometimes even professional broadcasters are going to get names wrong its not a huge deal unless its a consistent issue."
"I agree pats better at defense but it‚Äôs up for debate who‚Äôs the better player. It‚Äôs hard because pat talks ALOT so every single play he does well you see him yelling at his team and at the other team saying ‚ÄúI LOCKED YOU DOWN SON!!!!‚Äù  so it stands out more  Lonzo is quiet and kinda just does his job, his first few years he‚Äôs had some injuries so it‚Äôs rough but he‚Äôs like 10 years younger than Bev. Also bev isn‚Äôt good with the ball in his hand and has to be a guy sitting in the corner and waiting for someone to initiate the offense so he‚Äôs more of a system player  Also Zo averages more rebounds, points, assists, blocks and steals in each of his first 4 years than Bev has ever averaged in his 10 years"
Lonzo sent that ball on the Road to Zion
Please no i will kill myself seeing guys like lonzo chuck the ball from the 4 point line because shooting 25% from there is more efficient than shooting 40% from 2
What makes Murray a much better off ball player than Lonzo?
"Maybe LaMelo is doing better because, ya know, he‚Äôs a better player?? The ball family always said LaMelo is the best of the three brothers, so you would expect him to perform better in his rookie year than Lonzo which he (not surprisingly) has"
Melo = Carmelo Anthony  Zo = Alonzo Mourning  LaMelo = LaMelo Ball  Lonzo = Lonzo Ball  End of discussion. No opinions. Only data.
"I've always taken the approach that younger players need to *learn* winning and be part of that culture.  Unless you're a star, a younger player isn't going to create a winning environment on his own.  A team with Derozan as its best player won't be making deep playoff runs in the West.  But he does create a higher floor, which makes for a more competitive team night-in and night-out.   It's important for guys like Keldon, Lonnie, Vassell, Poeltl, and Dejounte to be a part of that.  The 7-game series against Denver and the great run in last year's bubble don't happen without Derozan, and I think the other players are better for those experiences.  I think of a few guys on perennially uncompetitive teams that have their growth stunted, lose confidence, or develop bad habits from not being around winning (say, Wendell Carter, Josh Jackson, or Lonzo Ball come to mind)."
 &gt;Bulls trade Zach LaVine to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks  LMFAOOOOOOOO
"&gt;  the Nuggets should go all in. They control all of their first-round picks, so they could make a Brooklyn-esque type of offer  that's like...not true, they gave up a 2023 first for grant with protections that make 2025 untradeable too  &gt; Celtics send their unprotected first-round pick in 2021 to the Mavericks for Tim Hardaway Jr.  what the fuck  &gt; Bulls trade Zach LaVine to the Pelicans for Lonzo Ball and two first-round picks   is this article satire"
"Lamelo is best served by reliable shooters. Terry rozier and Malik monk are both better shooters than lonzo ball this season. Plus, if we're gonna trade for someone, the position we least need to trade for is a point guard.   Maybe we can sign lonzo in 5-7 years in order to make lamelo happy and keep him in Charlotte if he becomes an MVP caliber player. But for now, let's worry about winning."
Only by trading for Lonzo and starting two Ball boys in the backcourt can the Hornets become a true contender
"I‚Äôve been saying the jury is still out on the Hornets FO. Word around the street is that MJ isn‚Äôt taking the Hornets seriously (more concerned with the 200 mil he lost in the GME thing atm) , which worries me a lot . Mitch Kupchak doesn‚Äôt inspire so much trust , and I don‚Äôt think the Hornets expected Lamelo to be this good this early just like everyone else    Ideally you want a big guard to pair with Lamelo in the backcourt of the future , and get a young center to grow and develop with the team (Vernon Carey and Nick Richards are developing in the G league rn, Biyombo and Zeller simply wont cut it so I hope they develop into something special)  A young wing would also be nice , since Hayward is going to be more injury prone the older he gets . So Big Guard - Lamelo - Bridges - 2 way Wing - Above average Center   As a fan of the Ball family I‚Äôd love it if Lonzo went to Charlotte but I don‚Äôt think the Hornets want to give Lavar more power lmao   There‚Äôs a lot of politics but I hope things work out for the better"
Lonzo Ball 2022 MVP
Lot of people saying Boston need a pass first guard with solid defense. Dare I say it - Lonzo Ball? You'd probably be able to get some picks or a young star (Hayes to shore up the inside?)
"Hes what people wanted lonzo to be really. If lonzo actually shot respectably, hed be a much bigger threat because his passing vision is better than lamelo‚Äôs. But shooting like stevie wonder playing ball by himself isnt going to get you very far."
"Lonzo plays like he's played his whole life with LaMelo lol. *""Gotta throw lobs to my fast brother."" ""Gotta pass the ball to my brother so he can shoot."" ""Gotta steal this ball for my brother.""* lol"
"What do them being from the same mother have to do with their personality lol. Also some players like Westbrook is a complete alpha personality on the court, but very chill and reserved off the court. Lonzo and Lamelo just have different approaches to the game. Lamelo clearly more talented, which will give him the confidence to take more risks. Lonzo more conservative, but showed in Chino Hills and even at UCLA that he can be very creative with a lot of flair if he plays in the right system. He simply doesn't have the ball skills and ability around the rim of Melo to really express himself in that way."
Was expecting him to be a decent defender only because Lonzo was projected to be a bad defender too   Them ball boys know how to pass and defend.
"It's so strange to me what lonzo is as a ball player.  He comes across, not in a bad way, as someone that is a nba veteran.  He defers to their play makers, Zion and Ingram, plays solid D, and just kinda plays the game as it unfolds.  Lamelo forces the game onto others.  Might result in a turnover but he plays with such confidence.  Uptempo, takes risks, has a flair for the dramatic.  He is playing the way everyone thought lonzo would out of college."
"Idk, I think the bigger difference is that LaMelo is exponentially more talented as a ball handler and has much better touch. Some of that is from being just more naturally gifted than Lonzo but you can also see his skillset is just so much more refined. If Lonzo were capable of playing like LaMelo I think he'd have the same level of confidence lol."
"tbh I think being benched in the beginning gave him motivation to work hard and to earn the starting role. He's been proving it day in and day out. Hornets staff is doing an amazing job of growing Lamelo's game and building his confidence instead of putting all the pressure on him to be the ""franchise guy"". Look at Lonzo, he had so much expectations early on from the Lakers org that he didn't have time to grow and coupled with poor performances that ruined his confidence because Lakers had expected him to be prime Magic Johnson right off the bat. The hornets org has real down to earth expectations for Melo and I hope they don't rush it and fumble the ball like the Lakers"
"LaMelo is what we thought Lonzo would be outta UCLA first year with the Lakers. Melo plays like UCLA Lonzo, fearless. All around offensive scoring package is lightyears further than Lonzo. Passing, just as good if not better. Defense, Lonzo got him but not by much. Players are excited, anxious when Melo touches the ball. Remember when guys felt like that when Lonzo had the ball? UCLA"
"On the other hand, people were convinced that Kuz, Lonzo Ball, and Josh Hart were future superstars just because they were lakers"
"Ball is like what, 23 years old? They can rebuild and still have Lonzo there"
"Pelicans like $GME bagholders who bought in after it hit 300, they already bought high and have no choice but to sell low.   Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, and whatever else the Lakers had at the time would have been better.   Ingram and Lonzo need the ball to be effective and aren't a good fit together."
"Lonzo is not a reluctant shooter, he averages over 7 threes a game, thats bs, Lonzo would be great for the Warriors, Lonzo always is a + on the court always have a positive on/off diferential, and will be great to give the ball to Steph, with Lonzo you can be sure he wont miss a wide open curry to attempt a shot in a crowded lane like Oubre."
Lonzo Ball
"Maybe I‚Äôm missing some new information but isn‚Äôt Lonzo Ball apart of the NBA?  So subsequently, any news or posts about him are valid since they are about the NBA."
"All these nephews are so obsessed with advanced stats now... the numbers might say lonzo ball has made more threes this year than Ben Simmons, but have you watched any games? How do we know he's actually made more threes? I bet if you gave both of them the eye test, ben Simmons makes way more threes, maybe even twice as many threes as Lonzo Ball."
Lonzo Ball has made more threes then me this year.
Is this Lonzo Ball day?
Next post: Lonzo Ball had made more threes than Klay Thompson this season
"Yeah, why would any team try to pluck a young, marginalized player away from the Lakers? You'd probably just end up with a fuckin bum like Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, D'Angelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Thomas Bryant, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk  or Isaac Bonga.  By the way, how's Semi Ojeleye's development coming along?"
b-but Ball Brothers cant shoot  The Ball Brothers:  Lonzo - 38.7% on 7.8 attempts  Melo - 37.8% on 5.3 attempts (43% on 6.6 attempts since starting)
Just shows you that he‚Äôs gonna be better than Curry. Trae young was predicted to be the next curry and lonzo is better! This is all the proof I need.  Mr ‚Äúwash my ball‚Äù was right
We live in a world where Lonzo isn‚Äôt ball dominant   o_O
You act like we didn't give up a lot to get AD. Lonzo Ball alone is better than whatever picks the Rockets are going to get. Not to mention Ingram and the 4th pick.
Everyone of them. He‚Äôs still a super high upside young prospect.   With his defense and passing- if he can be a consistent three point shooter - not only would he be a max player but he‚Äôd be a damn good one.   I‚Äôm enjoying the lonzo ball redemption arc
Lonzo is a off ball player who always shot a lot of 3s he was a bad shooter as a rookie but why is it surprising to people that he makes a lot of 3s. Those have always been most of his shots
"Lonzo Ball gets a lot of tread in the NBA Reddit, but overall he is severely underrated. It‚Äôs ironic, since the hype around him died pretty hard last season, and now he‚Äôs better than ever and no one cares. Can‚Äôt blame small market either, because Zion has pulled millions of eyes there. I hope he gets a fuckin bag and balls in his next locale, a la Malcolm Brogden"
"Lonzo has been by far his most effective in the half court off the ball. He‚Äôs turned himself into a lethal shooter, and is still incredible as the transition point.   At this point I have to wonder if people even watch Pels game. Lonzo has been INCREDIBLE and that in large part is due to PowerPoint Zion, BI, and other guys allowing to to thrive off ball in the halfcourt. He‚Äôs dramatically improved there, don‚Äôt get me wrong (especially in the PnR), but turning him into the full time half court general nullifies his best attributes he‚Äôs shown this season. He can be the ball dominant guard running with pace and in transition, and take a step back and do it less in a set halfcourt offense. And he shines in that role."
Lonzo Ball has no business taking so many threes.
I watch every pels game and live in New Orleans. Lonzo thrives when he brings the ball up the court and runs the offense.  He doesn‚Äôt belong in the corner waiting for Ingram or Bledsoe to pass it. Sure he‚Äôs doing well but he‚Äôs a natural play maker and thrived more so when Bledsoe is off the court and Lonzo brings the ball up  I agree he doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm saying he should b
Lonzo Ball is an elite 3 PT shooter.
Lonzo doesn't really control the ball at all in the half-court and most of his assist come in transition. He can definitely play SG. He honestly plays like Klay-lite but with some transition assist.
Lonzo has not been thriving off ball. He thrives when he gets to run the offense.
"I don‚Äôt think they need an *elite* playmaker, but definitely do need someone who is looking to find his teammates open looks consistently.   Which is why it was so disappointing when the Celtics used their max cap space on Kemba. We needed a point guard who was a more natural playmaker, but can still go out there and score 14-18 a night. Not a volume shooter who, rather inconveniently, is also a defensive liability and has an extensive injury history.   We needed someone like Malcolm Brogdon, who was also available that summer and would have cost far less than Kemba too. Or even a guy like Ricky Rubio, who really focuses on finding his teammates quality looks. Maybe someone like Lonzo Ball becomes available, I think his fit is also good with the Celtics."
They don't call him Lonzo Ball Ball for a reason
"Never thought I‚Äôd ever see Lonzo being able to thrive off ball, but here we are. Happy for him."
"Ball played for¬†Chino Hills High School¬†in¬†California, where he won a state championship and achieved national success as a junior with his brothers¬†Lonzo, and¬†LaMelo, who are both current NBA guards. A three-star¬†recruit¬†and¬†UCLA¬†signee, he decided to forgo college basketball after being suspended for shoplifting in China before the¬†2017‚Äì18 season.¬†"
Lonzo Ball is better than Trae Young and not enough people talk about it.
"That makes a ton of sense honestly. They should be throwing contracts at good young guys anyway, especially ones like Lonzo that would compliment a star/isn't ball dominant"
Lonzo also moves without the ball. When Trae passes it he literally fades out of frame.
lonzo ball 2k free throw animation still got me dead
Because Lonzo moves when he doesn‚Äôt have the ball in his hands.
"I had it backwards, he shot 43.6% with Wilson and 34.1% with Nike.  https://www.theringer.com/2017/3/17/16077266/lonzo-ball-ucla-shooting-mechanics-6eeda2ef3e41"
"I had it backwards, he shot 43.6% with Wilson and 34.1% with Nike.  https://www.theringer.com/2017/3/17/16077266/lonzo-ball-ucla-shooting-mechanics-6eeda2ef3e41"
Lonzo Ball also has better shot selection
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but this was also true last year except it was Lonzo Ball against Devin Booker. Hit more 3's at a higher rate in less games. That stat could have been just up to the shutdown, don't perfectly recall."
The Knicks should throw a contract at him.  Keep the ball in RJ and Randle's hands. Let Lonzo keep thriving off ball and playing hellish defense for Thibs
"ah, the weekly Lonzo Ball post, nice."
Lonzo 'I Silence My Haters' Ball
"This sub is still divided on lonzo and its gonna stay that way for awhile. He shoots 40% from 3, but goes through streaks where he looks like absolute dog shit from 3. Every ball player goes through streaks, but his are polarizing and you'll see people confirming their opposite opinion of him every other month. I've been guilty of this too    Also the sub is divided on whether griffin is any good at all, so reports about his opinion aren't going to change a lot of people's minds."
"Well for one the defensive issues can't be overstated. Not sure how you can realistically build a competitive defense with 2 below average forwards.      I've always viewed Ingram as a slow, deliberate, iso player. I think Zion wants to play a bit faster and benefits more from a much quicker decision maker like Lonzo. Zion is the type of guy where as soon as he gets to his spot you want to get him the ball because he's just impossible to guard 1v1 when he's in his spot.      Once again, I think Ingram is still a lot better than Lonzo so it shouldn't really matter unless some unexpected trade for a player as good/better than Ingram becomes available."
"I don‚Äôt think he gets traded. He‚Äôs been shooting the three well, can play off the ball, and passing/defending at a high level. Most importantly, he has a really good chemistry with Zion on the court. Watching him, he fits well with Zion‚Äôs game. Lonzo is a restricted free agent, the Pelicans won‚Äôt let him go anywhere. It would be fun seeing Lamelo and Zo together."
"Is Lonzo Ball the new Whiteside? When Whiteside was in his early years, he used to play hard only on contract renewal seasons. When he became older, it finally caught up with him to the point that he found it difficult to find offers."
"lonzo ball imo. He is arguably a top 7 pg in the league, and a top 6 shooter in the league"
"Lonzo ""Steph with a 40"" vertical"" Ball. Decent player with an absolute marketing genius of a father. The main issue with Lavar's marketing and media frenzy was that the media was WAYYY too invested in Lonzo which made the fact he's no all-star a lot worse"
"players ""improve"" when they get more shots and a chance to handle the ball enough to get better. when you're on lebron's team, you have a great chance to win a title, but you aren't given much leash in the sense that if you don't play well, you won't get minutes. lebron's teams don't have the time or priority to develop young guys. kyle kuzma is an okay player, but i think he would definitely see the ""stats boost"" that those other young guys saw if he went to a shitty team like DLO, Lonzo, Randle, or Ingram. this is why people will be shocked to see blake griffin average 7 ppg and 3 rpg on the nets"
This is why I proposed the other day I would call Miami and offer Duncan Robinson for Lonzo straight up. Throw in the Lakers 2021 pick if need be.   One thing about Zion/Redick is its a ton of 2nd unit defenses that dont know what they are doing as the opposition. I generally agree with the idea but I think the movement element is what drives alot of it. Generally simultaneous off ball action while Zion has the ball is the type of thing that can induce chaos. Think there might be ways of doing that with 2 good not great shooters over 1 JJ Redick. Always easier said than done though.  One other reason why I bring that up is because truly elite movement shooters who are reasonable defenders are quite rare. So if you prioritize getting that very often you are getting an iffy defender and now the margin for error in terms of building a good defense is very small.
Lonzo Ball  People went from treating him like a glorified future roleplayer to being a max contract PG
"So trade graham, monk, and a second round pick for Lonzo and the lakers pick this year. They have less guards on the roster then and can run a small ball lineup of rozier ball ball bridges Washington"
1. Lowry 2. Collins 3. Vucevic 4. Bagley 5. Ball  Bagleys value is so weird so doubt he'll be traded yet and Lonzo increased his value and said he wants to stay so I don't know about those two really
*team takes off as soon as Zion gets the ball in his hands more*   /r/nba: the problem is they should give it to Lonzo even more.
I think Lonzo needs to be in a situation where he‚Äôs finally the only PG/main ball handler.
"sure, he can shoot, play defense, run in transition, become a nice finisher   and his handle isn't good enough for him to be the primary ball handler, but if it's lamelo drives and kicks it out Lonzo is a great like defense is recovering let me get the ball and make a quick decision to drive and finish or kick out again, or make a quick read to someone else who's open"
"yeah, the biggest difference really is the handle honestly   because if you just talked about their vision and passing, it‚Äôs probably the same level, but lonzo can‚Äôt break his man down and get to the paint to create those opportunities to show his vision and passing as much, and  lamelo has the ball on a string and gets in the paint constantly"
"[Pretty sure he wanted #1, even Zo tried to get him that number](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2919068-lonzo-ball-campaigns-for-malik-monk-to-give-lamelo-ball-no-1-hornets-jersey)  This story of a promise looks legit. I wonder why the Dubs reneged. Maybe they really thought Wiseman would end up being a bonafide stud"
"I've already seen about 10 versions of these altered quotes lol  The worst is still, Lavar Ball said, ""He can't stay in New Orleans"" pre-trade deadline about Lonzo, and media changed it to, ""He can't stand New Orleans."""
"Yep, certain player are draws, and it certainly isn't limited to basketball here.  To use a modern example, Floyd Mayweather vs Pacquiao had a fight purse of over 300 million dollars, Tyson Fury vs Wilder (heavyweight championship title fight) had a purse of 28 million.  There are a lot of skilled boxers, ufc fighters, heck even pro wrestlers, but despire skill promoters and by extension the networks will still focus on the performers the paying customers care the most about.   If anything the league could try to ""build"" other superstars better (make sure their games have national broadcasts, features, interviews, articles etc) but again a catch 22.  Those games will have lower ratings, articles of fewer clicks to start, etc, and oftentimes fans will reject a person being pushed like that in a competitive sport.  Stars evolve organically and what they do off the court can effect why people care as much as their skill.   Media market (and the teams inside of it) is also extremely important.  Remember when we couldn't go a couple hours without hearing about Lonzo Ball when he was on the Lakers?  Ever since he went to New Orleans it's almost like those national commentators forgot he is still in the league."
"Grizzlies and Hawks both have widely hated players in Grayson Allen and Trae Young respectively, however Grayson Allen is hated because he is a genuinely dirty piece of shit and Trae cuz gets a lot of fouls called on him and he gets to the line.   Pels have a hyper popular and exciting young core in Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and some fat guy from Duke. Honestly both an exciting future and also a future that I'm pretty sure they'll fuck up somehow so follow the Hawks, unless you want to be happy in any way."
"I think we used up all of our lottery luck winning Zion. I was thinking more Tim Frazier, Ish Smith, Elfird Payton, etc. Somebody that floor general for most of the game, but isn't going to have the ball in their hands in crunch time. We could probably get all three combined well under the cost for Lonzo."
"I worry about Lonzo and the big city pressure again. Although I haven‚Äôt watched much of the Pelicans this season to see how he‚Äôs doing.   I have painful memories of Lonzo as a guy who got the Yips pretty often. The free throw shooting, or the time he rolled his ankles twice just taking the ball up the court D:"
"&gt;I'm pretty sure both parties in the trade knew AD was going to re-sign with LA  No.  &gt;Whether or not the Pelicans trade Anthony Davis, his agent says he [won't sign a contract extension with any team](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-celtics-anthony-davis-trade-one-year-rental) and plans to enter free agency in 2020.   &gt;   &gt;Rich Paul, Davis's agent, [told](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis)*Sports Illustrated*'s S.L. Price that regardless of where Davis plays next season, the six-time All-Star will test the free-agency market next summer.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúWhere he‚Äôs going to land? I have no idea,‚Äù Paul told SI. ‚ÄúAnd it don‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We‚Äôre going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can‚Äôt say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;[https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/anthony-davis-free-agency-2020-pelicans-trade-rumors)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Not to mention, if you don't trade for AD there's no guarantee he comes to LA as a FA. KD+Kyrie could have recruited him, among a number of other teams   This insinuates that Davis is the key to building an NBA team.  He's not -- or the Pelicans would've made the playoffs more than twice in his seven seasons there.  And again, there was no guarantee that Davis signs with Los Angeles five months ago in any scenario.  He was an unrestricted free agent, and his agent literally screamed to the entire world that he was going to test the free agent market.  &gt;I don't think you can necessarily assume the Lakers win the title last year without AD. DG and Markieff probably don't come to LA if they don't have AD. AD was a key part to that run and   I said ""probably"", I did not assume.  That said, their chances were very good.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Caruso, and Morris is by far the deepest and best team in Orlando.  And that's if they don't decide to make a different trade -- the Lakers could've traded for Jimmy Butler instead of Davis, and the former went for pennies in comparison.  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench dominates the bubble, and wins easily -- and the Lakers maintain most of the assets they blew on renting Davis.  &gt;I doubt BI+Lonzo could have made up his production on offense and defense   Those are only two of the seven players the Lakers traded away in that deal.  Eight if you count Zubac who was traded separately to make room.  Ingram alone last year nearly matched Davis' offensive production, so your only argument is on the defensive side -- but Ball is better on both ends than Danny Green, and cheaper.  Like I said, the Lakers probably win the 2020 title without Davis.  James has won with far less help."
"It was still within the context of the Lonzo mistake, and the initial comment referring to defensive instinct was directly addressing Lonzo's decision and HIS defensive instinct.   For the conversation to be centered on a Lonzo Ball play and for you to respond by saying ""our instinct must be bad,"" clearly indicates that you would be referring to Lonzo Ball's team (the Pelicans) and the use of the word ""our"" implies that you are a Pelicans fan, regardless of yours or the other commenters flair.  There was no mention of the wolves in the conversation to that point, nor was there any mention or suggestion that the wolves are a team that instinctually switches off the three, as Lonzo Ball had done.   Perhaps if this conversation were taking place on the wolves subreddit it would be a different story, but on the neutral site that is r/nba, a site which is frequented by fans of all teams across the league, it is natural for one to read the comments only in the context of the play/post being discussed. Because of this, there is no reason one would consider that you were talking about any team than the ones in the highlight. You are viewing things from a wolves-centric perspective but you need to recognize that many others here are not, nor should they be expected to.   This is why it makes perfect sense that the previous commenter, as well as anyone browsing this thread, would be confused by your comment, and then even more confused by your incredulity at our collective confusion."
if u dont want him he can always go back to the lakers. If bledsoe was a better defender he wouldnt of had to help out on the play put the blame where it should be. Also they were even with ball on the court so he isnt the reason they lost start pointing at the coach for 1 imo he is horrible . Also zion -13 marshall -14. Lonzo and BI only 2 players with a even or better plus minus.
"True. Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball for Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, who says no?"
Lonzo leaked off Bullock on Rose' drive to the bucket as the Pels were up 3. No reason to help on an open drive when the opposing team needs a 3 to tie   Lapsed judgment from Ball
"Maybe see what we have with Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Especially in the starting line-up. He's young and has shown out a few times. Ambidextrous finisher, can shoot threes, hit mid-range shots, stepbacks, can be a multi-level scorer and pest on defense at times.  I don't think they'll throw our rookie Kira Lewis Jr. in the fire just yet, but he's crazy fast and seems pretty smart for a rookie. He needs to get to NBA weight and keep learning off the bench probably.  They'll both get more minutes if Bledsoe is gone from the team.  Do we run things back with Josh Hart and Lonzo Ball though?   And please for the love of god sign some shooters who will actually show up and shoot and not drop to 20% when they join the Pelicans.  üôèüìø"
"Those two + Ball have made over half of our 3s this season. With them injured and Lonzo freezing cold, our shooting is completely gone outside of BI"
"No they played it right, Lonzo just fucked up. If Lonzo doesn‚Äôt leave his man they give up two and get the ball with 2 seconds left and a 1 point lead. New York had no timeouts so all they had to do was miss the last free throw and it‚Äôs game over"
"&gt; Eric Bledsoe admits in postgame that he was supposed to foul Derrick Rose on Knicks final offensive possession in regulation -- before Lonzo Ball whiffed on his assignment in staying adhered to Reggie Bullock.  This probably implies that Bledsoe was told by SVG to foul, so they didn‚Äôt foul and they closed out on a layup to let up an open 3 to the Knicks best shooter"
"I think you're just underrating how much Harden raises the abilities of everyone around him and I think Lonzo and Zion would have incomparable development playing with Harden. In addition, people put way too much stock into timelines when Harden is going to likely to be playing top level ball when Zion enters his prime anyway considering his iron-man-ness.  Phoenix went from lottery to contender in the span of a year.  No one is saying they are favorites in the West, but I think Zion/Ingram is much more limited for the future than Zion/Harden, and that's no real disrespect to Ingram.  You also keep Jrue in this scenario."
"Lonzo is basically a 3D guy who doesn't create offense on his own. They need a speedier guard with better shot creation to be a better third option. Kira Lewis looks like he can be that guy down the road. Also, I think Zion, and to lesser extent Ingram, should handle the ball more. They don't need a guy like Ball."
"With the exception of Lavar Ball, I guarantee you that there are literally zero people in the world who think Lonzo Ball is better than Trae Young"
"As a Pelicans Fan, I‚Äôm offended we even gave Mr.Anti Clutch the ball for the win. Bledsoe?! You draw up a play for Bledsoe?! I could see Ingram, Zion, hell I‚Äôd be ok even Lonzo, but Bledsoe?!"
They have 22 million in cap space with Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart being their free agents. They either lose both of them or commit all their salary cap to a team that wont even make the play-in game
"&gt; He just can‚Äôt do it with KD levels of efficiency.  He can't do it with league average efficiency. He can't do it in Lonzo Ball efficiency (55.5 TS%). He can't to it with Talen Horton-Tucker efficiency (52 TS%). He's literally the WORST volume scorer in the league EVER. lmao yes he can't do it on KD's (67 TS%) efficiency even in his dreams, in rec league.   The man wastes an insane amount of possessions to inflate his own stats. The one and only stat he deflates, are wins. And that is an inarguable fact. He's playing losing basketball, especially if we're talking the playoffs, but recently, even regular season eastern conference weak ass ball."
Lonzo Ball
"I think he's gonna make a big difference. There are very few players who fit the mold we really need at PG alongside Ben: defense, 3pt, off ball play, shot creation, and running the offense. Doc has done a great job creating playmaking when Ben sits, but we really don't have any reliable secondary playmakers. Shake is at his best scoring the ball.   Hill can unlock Ben as a roll man and transition target, run the second unit, and mentor Maxey. Morey said the price of Lowry was ""in la la land"". Lonzo was probably similarly expensive. I'm glad we picked up Hill, as long as he has some gas left in the tank he will help the offense immensely. If he's wash't, he has a team option that can be declined &amp; could also be picked up and used as trade filler. The move makes us better now, adds future flexibility, and benefits the rookies. That's a lot of value for very little cost"
"Honestly I don't remember. I've never been a Lakers fan, so other than watching the twilight of Magic's career and then Shaq/Kobe, Kobe/Pau, I didn't pay much attention. Just based on draft pick #, I thought Ingram would be the best since he was picked no. 2. The whole Lavar Ball stuff made me think Lonzo was all hype. I think he might've went higher than he should've, but I feel like he's on the right trajectory and wouldn't mind having him on my team lol."
"Depends what my options are.  If its Schroder vs. another year of Elf, then yes. If we have any kind of shot at Lonzo, Lowry, or Conley I'd prefer them. Schroder seems a bit ball dominant for what I ideally want in a PG but beggars can't be choosers I guess and we could use the scoring."
"This is true with lots of players. People are really quick to assume a player is finished when they come back from injury out of form.   Happens with Lonzo Ball every time he returns from an injury and is slow to get back into his groove. His main knock is that he's injury prone IMO, but he's a fantastic player when he gets comfortable after an injury. I was really thrilled to see him come back strong after the recent hip flexor strain, especially since it's still bothering him.   I'd say something like that is happening with John Wall. He's not having a great year, but he did have a considerable amount of time off, and it's not like teams are getting ample practice time this season. It doesn't seem like he's been robbed of all his athletic gifts (he actually still looks very fast to me), so I think it's very possible if not likely that John Wall returns to being an All Star caliber player next year."
Randle and Ingram would have battled for needing the ball. Kuzma would have been the guy with 'so much potential off the bench'. Hart would be who he is. Caruso would have got no time at the point behind Lonzo and Russell. Lonzo would be the same. Russell would have shifted from starter to bench a million times while they debated over him and clarkson being better. Nance and Zubac would have been starters off and on while the team decides what offense they wanna run. And Clarkson would have demanded a trade for never getting to touch the ball.  Too many dudes that need to have the ball in their hands.
"Here‚Äôs a better way to ask this; how much better does Julius Randle make the Pelicans vs having Zion? Probably not much and they‚Äôre a dumpster fire.   Even in a perfect world where the injury prone guys like Lonzo, Dlo (and to an extent Hart and Nance) one ball amongst these guys will not work."
We got our chip so can‚Äôt complain but the what if alternate reality of him and Ingram and Clarkson make my all time top five.  Along with Tatum who we could have had instead of Lonzo Ball.
"&gt;s he looked amazing but that was disregarded because ‚Äúlow sample size‚Äù  Because this happens every single year in the NBA all the time. Fans overreact to cherry picked sample sizes, overrate their own young prospects, are convinced ""their guy is making the leap and if you disagree it means you dont watch the games"" etc. Im not referring to you specifically just in general. People are still bringing up Cam Reddish's 20 game splits late last year as proof he'll be some kind of stud. People did this type of stuff with Andrew Wiggins everytime he had a good 3 week stretch for years. Hell even saw some of it with Josh Jackson. It's all just motivated reasoning.   &gt;He wasn‚Äôt going to be successful on a Lebron team because he‚Äôs more of a ball dominant player.   He was a very popular preseason most improved player pick for that season. Even by Lakers fans. This is hindsight bias.   &gt;for how we have something wrong with our development.  Lonzo, Ingram, Randle, Nance all these guys have magically become substantially better 3 point shooters, nonetheless players once they left LA. Even Russell from a player perspective. If it were just one example I wouldnt bring it up as anything but it's not some arbitrary isolated coincidence."
Lakers had lonzo ball and magic johnson dancing for a bit but that didn't quite stick   Gamecube nintendo was fucking legendary though. Damn near changed the vid weekly
"Well that's why I've been beating the drum for Ben Simmons or Lonzo Ball. Both guys who can actually dish out assists, score and call plays while playing defense. It's a great fit, but the 76ers ain't trading for CJ without trying to keep Ben. Lonzo is attainable but we'll see"
Lonzo 'I want 20 mill in FA' Ball
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
Lonzo ball &gt; Trae young
"Last decade:  **2020:** James Wiseman (TBC)  **2019:** Ja Morant (potential All Star)  **2018:** Marvin Bagley (bust)  **2017:** Lonzo Ball (solid player but not #2 worthy)  **2016:** Brandon Ingram (All Star)  **2015:** D'Angelo Russell (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2014:** Jabari Parker (bust)  **2013:** Victor Oladipo (has been an All Star, injuries have hindered)  **2012:** Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bust)  **2011:** Derrick Williams (bust)"
"My thought is that, if this same shot was made by someone like delon wright, trevor ariza, lonzo ball, etc. We'd be impressed but we wouldn't associate the shot itself with  GOAT shots such as the trevor booker's backwards love tap w/ the Jazz. But because it's doncic, who is synonymoud with NBA david copperfield, we give him that extra association bonus.  And that's ok üòéüòéüòé"
Is Lonzo Ball still the answer to y‚Äôall‚Äôs prayers this off-season?
"I don't know if any of those would be realistic though. The Suns are the 2 seed in the West and are currently a game and a half back from the one seed. Would a guy as competitive as CP3 is really want to leave that kind of situation for a borderline lottery team. Paul has made tons of money over his career so even if the Bulls throw him a bag, I don't think he would leave a winning team to go there.  Now DeRozen is not really a natural fit next to Lavine. DeRozen needs the ball in his hand as he is not a good 3pt shooter and relies heavily on his mid-range game. His style doesn't really mesh particularly well with Lavine or Vuc.   Lowry has maintained repeatedly that he wants to be a Raptor for life and the Raptors have made it clear that they wish to retain him as well. Plus I don't think it would be a smart move to throw serious money at a 35 year old point guard anyway. Lowry is a very good player but it is historically likely that his production is going to drop of significantly in the next year or two. Chris Paul's ability to stay very productive into his mid-late 30s is more of an exception than the rule. PGs usually decline faster and more dramatically than any other position.  What Chicago really needs is a traditional playmaking PG who can distribute the ball, run the offense, and be reliable on the defensive end. Who would be perfect for Chicago is Lonzo Ball, but he is a restricted free agent and the Bulls would likely have to give him close to the max in order to pry him away from New Orleans, which idk if they would be willing or even be able to do considering their cap situation."
"S&amp;T, but even then probably not able if we actually seek Lonzo Ball cause $$."
"Missing a lot of our usual roster right now (Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Josh Hart, Lonzo Ball.)   Our newer guys haven't played with the team before and look a little confused about where to go when Zion gets doubled rn."
"   &gt;Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray   &gt;   &gt;If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo.     What is this crap? YOU are the one underrating Dlo, Lonzo is certainly not better than Dlo, Murray isnt, maybe Conley is, and Shai is."
"Yes I'd take Dlo over Lonzo Ball and Dejounte Murray. Maybe even Mike Conley.   Lonzo plays with Zion and B.I so gets goods looks from 3s. He wishes he is even half the offensive player Dlo is, and his half-court offense doesn't even compare to Dlo's. I'll take Zo for the rebounds and defense though."
Lonzo Ball
"&gt; nobody overrates dlo   Anyone who thinks he's good is PG is overrating him. Casual fans still consider him a star.  Would you take D'Lo over any of the following players? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Malcolm Brogdon, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Dejounte Murray  If you answered yes to any of those then you're the one overrating DLo."
I hated Murray for what he did to Lonzo Ball his rookie year.  But that alllll changed when he tortured the Clippers into meme status in the bubble.  Love Jokic and sad to see this happen as these playoffs just got a little less interesting from a Denver perspective.  They can still make noise without him.
I fought I was bamboozled by one of those Lonzo Ball/Giannis 50/50 threads.  I got double bamboozled.
"Remember when he dribbled around Lonzo Ball for no reason? Yeah, I do, no sympathy from me.  Karma at its finest."
"Remember when he dribbled around Lonzo Ball for no reason? Yeah, I do, no sympathy from me."
I don‚Äôt know what his issue is. Everyone knows the good pass comes off of being aggressive offensively. You know who plays like this? 6th graders that are too scared to shoot or attempt layups because they are afraid to be made fun of when they miss so they just try and dump everything off and end up turning the ball over (rookie year Lonzo Ball).  Like literally anything is better than this. Catch and one dribble pull up midrange? Sure. Attack the rim hard and hope to get fouled? Even better. Instead what do we get? Catch the ball and immediately look around for someone to alley-oop only to get stuck in no man‚Äôs land mid air.  I understand he wants to be a distributor and that‚Äôs his role - he‚Äôs just going about it the wrong way. If he was more aggressive off the catch and dribble attacking the basket the passing lanes would open up and he would lower his turnovers and increase his efficiency.

"Steph, Giannis and Jrue is a clear contender  Marcus and Lonzo make that small ball unit fucking DANGEROUS   Lonzo can be a Dray-lite type of facilitator/high energy defender"
"It's more about the team than one player.  Zion has played in 61 games this year, and was shut down after the Pels lost their chance to get the play-ins. That's enough to not refer to him as ""can't stay on court"" by my book.  Lonzo and Ingram are too inconsistent and the Pels schemes are bad because of Adams and Beldose - I can't fault Zion for that.  Zion's usage rate this year was 29.6% which is high, but he is a big not a ball handler.  I don't think that AD was viewed as worse than Lillard before the Pels reached the Playoffs."
I think having Lamelo be the primary ball handler off the bench helps maximize use of his skills and gives the bench a better lead guard than Lonzo would be.
Another boneheaded move by the Bulls front office. Its not like the Bulls had to give away Daniel Gafford. The Bulls had already got Vooch in the prior trade. The second trade was unnecessary. Imagine if the Bulls had managed to pull of a Lonzo Ball trade. Lonzo and Gafford would of been a Hell of a site.
"He's in a small market which is probably why he doesn't get as much exposure. Remember when Lonzo Ball was in LA how much exposure he was getting?   Now that he's in NOLA, you'll see highlights here and there but no where near as much marketing. His lil bro Melo gets more coverage then Lonzo."
"We have one Lonzo Ball available by S&amp;T for Wiggins and picks. A pair of double swaps in 2022 and 2027, an unprotected pick in 2028, and an unprotected swap in 2029 and we‚Äôll take Wiggins for Lonzo."
"What do you mean the talent surrounding RJ is way better than Zion‚Äôs? Fit is one thing, but he‚Äôs playing next to a former all star is Brandon Ingram, a number 2 pick in Lonzo Ball, a great big man in Steven Adams, and a tough minded role player in Eric Bledsoe. All very popular and common names. Meanwhile RJ Barrett is sharing the court with guys like Elfrid Payton, Julius Randle (who prior to this year was bad) and a past his prime Derrick Rose"
"I mean you‚Äôd think with all their talent they‚Äôd be able to scrape up something but nope.  Zion, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball as a young core  Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe, (formerly) JJ Reddick As your vets. A lot of talent on paper."
"If *you* offer picks and swaps, I would gladly offer you Lonzo Ball in a S&amp;T  for Wiggins."
I was certain Lonzo Ball was gonna be here.  If only for the hype he got coming in.  He's gonna go from the Pellies to Kazakhstan at this point.
"Salute for stickin around ol boomer  Here's mine (that I got to see play, no particular order):  Kobe Bryant   Pau Gasol   Tracy McGrady  Chris Paul   Draymond Green   Tim Duncan  Nikola Jokic  Lebron James  Lamar Odom  Lonzo Ball"
"In the hypothetical we're discussing, I don't see signing CP3 and Lonzo, +mediocre/bad bench players as being competitively better in the short term or long term than CP3 + retaining one of the better benches in the NBA. Lonzo Ball isn't the difference between a championship team and perpetual mediocrity."
Seven degrees between Lonzo Ball and George Mikan
"one player can turn around a franchise if they are named lebron james, nobody else has that level of impact.  it wasn't kyrie that brought the cavs to the finals over and over again, they still sucked until lebron came back  how many recent champions actually built their roster through tanking.. basically none.   you can say the lakers maybe, but I would say lebron signing there in free agency had a bigger impact than drafting lonzo ball  competitive teams like milwaukee and toronto during their championship run weren't built through tanking.   GSW didn't tank.  miami never tanks.    and the teams that do tank usually do it over and over again forever, like the timberwolves or kings or pelicans  even the knicks now if we are becoming a respectable team again, it wasn't because of the shit seasons and the tanking, it was free agents and a new coach"
"Tacko fall, bol bol, lamelo ball, Lonzo ball, Grayson allen"
"I do hate it when people talk about the Cavs as a total loser franchise when they were shitfucking the East for however long.  &amp;#x200B;  Yes they had LeBron but they also had some nice players and a ridiculous offense to boot.  &amp;#x200B;  That said I don't appreciate the Lonzo hate, dude can ball!"
Bro Lonzo Ball via Tyson Chandler to Scottie Pippen had me shook
"If knicks are proof of anything it is that no quagmire is eternal. But I agree Lebron made us what we are. But I watched the baby lakers and seeing what they have all developed into you can't say they wouldnt at least be a competitive playoff team this year even without lebron. We would have Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle Lonzo Ball Kyle Kuzma as well as out other pieces currently on the roster. Maybe Randle needed to leave to become what he is but even if he was close to it on the lakers that is a tough team that I think could be a finals threat in the coming years."
The Lonzo ball stat line
"Drafting is one aspect of the equation.  Developing talent is a whole other ball game that the Wolves have shown they aren‚Äôt great at.  Steph in Golden State was lightning in a bottle as well. We hate Mark Jackson but there‚Äôs no denying that not many coaches would‚Äôve given Steph the freedom to do what he did. Steph also had many injury issues early on and Wolves could‚Äôve very easily flipped him.  You‚Äôre downplaying Raptors hand in developing Derozan as well.  Lakers drafted well but were awful for years, Randle, Hart, BI, Lonzo, Clarkson, Nance have all improved significantly since leaving them. They clearly weren‚Äôt developing these guys right."
Lonzo Ball
"Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram"
"You kep touting those ecf appearances like they are huge achievements but if you actually look at the teams they went through, it isn't impressive at all. None of those teams (bulls, wizards, Pacers) had the collection of talent that surpassed Tatum and Brown. And Tatum was highly regarded, it's just that Lavar Ball jedi mindtricked everyone into thinking Lonzo was the next Magic. I even said at the time that the Lakers were going to regret passing on Tatum, who fully admitted that he was a HUGE kobe fan before the draft."
"Allen's ceiling seems to be Clint Capela and he's not there quite yet so his statement is harsh but accurate. However, in terms of predicting which players will be stars in the future I can think of a handful of other fanbases who are worse. For starters, I'd like to know your original thoughts about Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and Brandon Ingram and your current thoughts on Talen Horton-Tucker."
As a lakers fan you gotta be happy that the team chose the superior Lonzo ball over the virgin Jayson tatum right?
"Hornets need better defensive players, someone like Lonzo Ball could really help anchor the defense along with providing great 3pt shooting, facilitating, and expanding their fast break offensive skillset."
"Do you not think Smart and his agent would believe he could get the same kind of offers that Dennis Schroder and Lonzo Ball will get? He's not a max player, but someone will probably be willing to give him more than $20 million per year."
"If you‚Äôre an NBA franchise your goal is to win a championship. Schroeder as a PG *with other additions* puts you in a better spot than Lonzo ever could. Just watch him in one with the Lakers this year and get back to me.   Also, idk where you‚Äôre getting that Lonzo is the consensus top free agent. Again, I‚Äôm a big fan of Lonzo but he ain‚Äôt even the best Ball in the NBA. Schroeder is way better than him."
"Charlotte should sign Lonzo and somehow acquire Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, and Bol Bol.   Then their lineup could be:   Ball/Ball  Bey/Bey  Bol Bol"
Your team didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs 2 seasons ago. With Lebron James Kyle Kuzma Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball on the roster.
Lamelo Ball has more playoff appearances than Zion and Lonzo combined.
"Listening to ESPN Radio, got this idea:  Would a Ball brother Finals of Hornets (LaMelo)/Pelicans (Lonzo) be a draw? Would such a family reunion matchup compensate for the supposedly ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù media markets?"
"Not really.  He had the complete reigns of the team- no AD or LBJ for most of that time.  Those are mediocre starting PG numbers- the kind of guy who can lead a team to a .500 record if they catch a few breaks.  On a winner he's just a starter- not even a top 3 guy.    His numbers are basically the same as Lonzo over the whole year, and Lonzo shared the ball with BI and Zion.  But he's older and shorter/worse rebounder/defender."
Also both Balls are 6'6. If Lonzo bulks up and become the biggest Ball he could play the 3.
Lonzo ball is not even the best defensive guard on the team lol.
"You don‚Äôt watch pels games if you think lonzo ball is the dude trying on defense. He plays defense, but he‚Äôs not a stalwart. If lonzo ball is your best defender your defense is fucked."
"One of those was BI who was still trying to adjust to the NBA and has even said he wasn't strong enough to shoot 3s until last year, and another was rookie Lonzo Ball who shot the ball from the wrong side of his fucking head and was almost falling under the singler line"
"I'd love to see a Ball^2 backcourt but I don't see it happening. Lamelo/Rozier compliments each other really well, and Lonzo is perfect for this NOLA team."
"It's funny, this is actually why I feel like he does work for the Knicks lol  Randle is essentially our primary playmaker in the half court, so the best fit at PG for me would be a guy who can be effective without the ball in his hands as much. An automatic spot up shooter from 3 that gives us more spacing, playmaking, unselfishness, and defense - and I think Lonzo gives us all of that."
"I think Lonzo would fit with the Knicks perfectly if Pels don't match or do a S&amp;T with him. Young player that matches their timeline, would do wonders for helping the ball move with the Knicks (they have one of the lowest assist totals I think?), and he's a good 3pt shooter now at 38% on like 8 attempts which is nuts considering how bad he once was. He's a PG that is fine with not having the ball in his hands, which allows for Randle to still be the primary offensive player, and RJ as well as other guys to still get just as many touches. When Randle or DRose have the ball, Lonzo will be a great 3&amp;D player."
"&gt; watch any Pelicans game from start to finish and what you‚Äôll see are a series of question marks created by one of the league‚Äôs strongest players. ‚ÄúHe's going to the rim every time,‚Äù Lonzo Ball told reporters. ‚ÄúThere are fouls; they aren't calling them.‚Äù Nobody seeks out close-quarters combat as often as Williamson does, and arguably nobody puts more pressure on those who have to adjudicate a rule book that wasn‚Äôt written with the thought that someone this fast and powerful would ever exist.  Interesting read. Highly recommended, thanks for the share."
"you gettin shit for this but   &gt;Lonzo Ball, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, Michael Porter Jr, Nikola Jokic  this would definitely be a REALLY good starting lineup  nets are gonna be favorites as long as the big 3 is intact tho"
"I don‚Äôt know about that. Ball may be playing ‚Äúpoint guard‚Äù on the Pelicans right now, but Zion and BI seem to handle it more. I feel that Lonzo right now would be a great fit for the lakers.  - He‚Äôs been shooting really well lately - He has the tools to be one of the best defenders in the league, and playing with a coach like Vogel and a great defensive team like the lakers can probably coax it out of him - Gives you another great secondary playmaking option if you lose Schr√∂der.   I mean defensively he‚Äôs probably an upgrade on Schr√∂der. Don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll be able to anchor a second unit though."
Killian Hayes floor would still be an average starter with his good playmaking skill and defense.. similar mold as Ricky Rubio or Lonzo Ball  His offense is leaving a lot to be desired tho. He never looks to score and his lay up drive game is bad despite him having some floater touch and good handle to get to where he wants.. he should be  able to figure it out
Lonzo Ball has confidence issues. He scored and played confidently in college.
I hope he‚Äôs still writing royalty checks to Lonzo Ball.
"Klutch clients in the lakers currently:   LeBron, AD, KCP, Ben Mcklemore, Montrezl, THT.   Form the best klutch line up with the lakers.   P.S : ex Lakers klutch client: They could‚Äôve had Jr Smith, Dion Waiters, Jordan Clarkson, Lonzo Ball as well."
He‚Äôs also Lonzo ball if you give him a 40 inch vert
Steph Curry + 40 inch vert = Lonzo Ball
Favorite episode was when lonzo ball catches Lebron/AD tampering like when bran caught Cersei and Jaime.  Other was when Kyrie says they should start their own league( kyrie then said something like that last year which was hilarious)
"You really can't compare anyone to Ben Simmons in terms of learning how to shoot. Literally every other NBA player who became a better shooter actually had decent shooting abilities prior to the NBA. Ben Simmons is the first ball handler in the NBA to not have any ability to shoot the ball.   People expected Ben Simmons to get better at shooting, much like Jason Kidd or Tony Parker, or in your case, Lonzo Ball. People didn't realize how fucked up Ben Simmons shooting form is and thus get disappointed when he didn't improve. Every other player just slightly altered their shooting form and showed progress. In order for Ben Simmons to improve, he would have to change is shooting form altogether and start from scratch, which is really difficult to do."
"I agree totally about putting the work in until you meet those expectations. My point is being given the confidence (and support) to shoot in a game setting will dramatically make you a better shooter. Of course you have to put the work in behind scenes and some people may not ever be shooters but you can be lights out in practice and brick on the court. More of it is mental then people may like to think.   A lot of people were calling on Lonzo to stop shooting completely, it took more then two seasons before there was a noticeable change and he‚Äôs become decent. You can tell he‚Äôs become confident. Through the worst parts of it his coaches didn‚Äôt pull the plug on him shooting the ball. There‚Äôs a reason some shooting coaches favourite thing to say is ‚Äòdon‚Äôt think just shoot.‚Äô"
"Another example of the media overhyping a player with lackadaisical skills. The so called  experts have always called somebody the next Jordan or next LeBron and next Kobe.  Stuff him in the going to be boxed with Wiggins, Lonzo ball, Tracy McGrady and Herald Minor."
"He really hasn‚Äôt improved honestly. His ‚Äúrookie‚Äù season and sophomore season were probably his best out of the 4, and he‚Äôs just straight regressed since. He can‚Äôt hit a jumper, he can‚Äôt shoot 3s, he can‚Äôt even shoot free throws now, yet the one thing he‚Äôs good at is getting to the rim and he can‚Äôt even do that now? Dude went from an All-Star to Bronny being better than him real quick. Like fuck I‚Äôd rather have LaMelo or Lonzo over him and I despise the ball brothers."
"The Problem is that you have Embiid, an unstoppable force.  Centers don't last long so you have to get rid of Simmons.  How many years before the lift and the ""twitch "" factor is gone from Embiid.  You can't work with him nor can you wait another year.  Simmons should be the FIRST guy traded.  I feel bad for him but the 6ers should be a title contender.  The process SHOULD change now that its clear.  Lonzo Ball would be perfect for this team."
"fuck no, he‚Äôs ass lonzo ball would be better and much cheaper"
"No reason why he can't. Except that he's had 5 years to develop and hasn't made a shred of progress.  Lonzo ball was trash as well. He decided to completely rebuild his shot, and was just shy of 80 percent free throw percentage this season after shooting 40 two seasons ago.  Ben has not shown a willingness to do this.  We've seen other big men develop outside shots. But these big men only did so because of the evolving nature of the game. They never needed outside shots in the past, so there wasn't a pressing need to develop.  Ben played point guard from day one. Shooting has been a critical guard skill from day one, and there is no reason why he shouldn't have prioritized. Yet he's shown time and time again he is unable or unwilling to change."
Like early Lonzo Ball.. Psychologically broken to the point where they will pass out of wide open layups in an effort to avoid the anxiety of freethrows. true human avoidance
Reminds me of Lonzo Ball. He would do that stuff all the time.
How did Ben Simmons turn into skittish Lonzo Ball
We wants to be like Aussie Lonzo Ball that's slightly taller I guess in not one of the better years.
2014 Zach LaVine instead of Randle  2015 Devin Booker instead of Russell   2016 Ingram was fine  2017 Jayson Tatum instead of Lonzo Ball   2018 Gary Trent Jr instead of Mo Wagner
You realize switch Simmons for Lonzo ball You win the series
I been saying Lonzo Ball is better than Ben Simmons for 2 years
The Lonzo ball of it all
I'm thinking that maybe sixers should try to get Lonzo Ball. Similar kind of player to Simmons but without the offensive weakness
"Damn, he used to a less handsome Ricky Rubio and taller Lonzo Ball but those 2 actually can shoot 3s now"
He has value to a rebuilding team with a shit ton of cap space. A team like NO might make sense because he's a better defender than Lonzo and all they'll ask is for him to handle the ball and playmake.
It's Reggie Jackson and Lonzo ball quite easily
Lonzo ball drop off pass to Tyson Chandler vibes.
sixers need to go out and get lonzo ball/dinwiddie/lowry/derozan. SOMEONE
Ben Simmons is jumbo Lonzo Ball
"Lonzo Ball.  Not that he's worse, more like comparably garbage offense.  Damnit, even he has sparks of hope."
"I'm more disappointed by Ben Simmons than I'm happy for Atlanta, and I'm a Hawk fan. I remember when people clowned Lonzo Ball for his shot, only to praise this guy. What a joke...."
"Because you're a PG who can't shoot outside 3ft. Or free throws... Even Lonzo hit what, 70% this year? The Ben Simmons experiment is over, he's a bonafide bust. He needs to either be moved to a small ball center or develop a hell of a drop step and hook and play PF.  Doubling Embiid and if Seth doesn't have a monster game, it's over. Ben Simmons is not a superstar."
Ben Simmons is an upper middle class man's Lonzo Ball
lonzo ball is unironically better than ben simmons
I got downvoted some months ago for saying Lonzo Ball &gt; Simmons.
"this is like 2017 Lonzo, just passing the ball the second it touches his hands, afraid to death of free th rows"
hawks should sign lonzo ball
lonzo ball and john collins - restricted free agents (young players)
"i think the knicks are low-key gonna go after john collins for a near max deal. and then go after lonzo ball and offer him the same type of deal they gave to randle a couple years back. also, resign bullock.  c - collins/mitch/pelle   pf - randle/obi   sf - bullock/knox   sg - rj/quickley   pg - lonzo/vildoza    and then use their two first and two seconds to fill out the roster."
"The thing with Booker is, hes never really had a huge group of dedicated haters. People would call him empty stats ever since he scored 70 but no one really hated on Booker the same way Trae is.  Earlier this season some people seriously were saying Lonzo Ball &gt; Trae Young."
"Lets just say there‚Äôs a reason why Lonzo Ball is my favorite player since he was drafted  No, I am not a better shooter than Ben Simmons"
"Yes, exactly. Lebron joined a Lakers team with superstars such as Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, and KUZMA."
He shot like Steph Curry shooting for charity  He shot like Kyle Kuzma today  He shot like Lonzo Ball before he fixed his form.
Lonzo would be really good actually and if LaMelo had a better 3pt shot he would be the absolute perfect guard beside Mitchell (he allows Mitchell to play more off ball and can defend bigger guards).
Who do you think would be the ideal PG alongside Mitchell? I‚Äôm thinking Lonzo could be perfect as a tall PG who can guard bigger players and also handle some playmaking duties and play off ball.
He's a poor man's Lonzo ball. Waste of that huge contract and only hurting his team. Rondo was better back in the day on the Celtics lol.
Ben ‚ÄúLakers Lonzo Ball‚Äù Simmons
"This is what lonzo ball  would do in his rookie season it was infuriating to watch. But hes not become a much better player whereas ben has gotten worse, its perplexing."
"Lot of them traded to New Orleans to get Anthony Davis - specifically Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple first round picks."
6/9/5? That is Lonzo ball rookie stats man... sixers still think he is a core piece of a trade for harden/dame haha.. smh
Simmons is a less talented Lonzo Ball.
Ben is doing that 2019 Lonzo move where the second he gets the ball he has to immediately get rid of it with no plan in mind
philly need lonzo ball
"Lonzo Ball and Draymond used to get clowned with ""triple singles"" for the type of stat lines that Ben Simmons provides."
Lonzo Ball is who Ben Simmons thinks he is
"I don't think Magic was that bad, granted he was working in tandem with Pelinka but they cleared cap space and successfully recruited LeBron. Lonzo Ball wasn't a bad pick either. It's not like anyone knew how Tatum (3rd pick) or Donovan Mitchell (13th pick) was really going to pan out, but regardless the result would have ended the same way: they'd be traded for Anthony Davis.   There is actually a chance that if Magic weren't GM, Lebron wouldn't be a Laker right now. the biggest issue with Magic was that he didn't prioritize his job (often no-showing) and always had other business matters to take care of."
"Once the bulls get Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Zion Williamson, and Lonzo Ball this offseason, LaVine will easily"
"I'm very interested in Lonzo Ball. I think he'd be a really good fit for Brown and Tatum and he has the potential to give us better defense than what we've had with IT, Kyrie, and Kemba."
"Basketball, Lonzo Ball, Lamelo Ball, Liangelo Ball and Lavar Ball.  Who knew Sam Prestie's ultimate goal was to assemble the Ball gauntlet."
If your plan is to give up a first for the right to give Lonzo Ball $90 mil you're going to end up being pretty disappointed 2 yrs from now and re-starting the cycle of bad contracts you want to get rid of.
"Easily the ‚Äò19-‚Äò21 Pelicans. ([stats support this](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/win-pct-close-games)) I‚Äôve only been routinely watching basketball since 2015, but this fucking team this year &amp; last dropped more 4th quarter games than I‚Äôd seen in the other 5 years combined.   Always tied or leading with 5 minutes left.   Gentry &amp; Van Gundy:  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs ignore what happened the whole game, give BI the ball and ISO. Zion, your work is done. Incredibly efficient game. Lonzo, chill in that corner. BI, use all that killer instinct (that I alone imagine you have) and win the game for us. Nobody foul and I won‚Äôt call a TO and I think that‚Äôll do it!‚Äù  It‚Äôs literally insane that both coaches did the same thing time after time after time."
This is also known as the 2018 - 19 Lonzo Ball experience
"Lol his defense, they have 3 all nba defenders this season and still can't stop the hawks. He is overrated in ever aspect. You have to talk up his overrated Defense because he has nothing else to offer. Hell Lonzo ball is imo better than Simmons"
"&gt;He's not good enough in the PnR to be a primary ballhandler.  I like to think i'm an objective lonzo stan whos watched his whole career and this ""lonzo cant run pnrs"" stuff is nonsense. He's obviously not elite but he's def not bad, even on the lakers when his inside game was atrocious and he didn't shoot middies, he was effective in the pick in roll because he was just super good at getting to ball to the roller, and he'd always drag a defender with him even though his inside game was honestly trash lol. I saw even more improvement this year... until his role got completely stifled by bledsoe."
"Who would of thought that Lonzo Ball would end up being the better scorer between these two, fuck sakes..."
Dude reminds me a little bit of a bigger Lonzo Ball.
"&gt;There's no way he doesn't practice enough shooting  Are you sure about that tho? Maybe he needs to be spending a couple extra hours in the gym than everyone else and taking an extra 500 shots a day, but he just doesn't want to put that time in?  I honestly think he doesn't have enough confidence in his shot because he knows he doesn't work hard enough on it.  I'd be willing to bet that Lonzo Ball put up at least twice as many practice shots than Ben Simmons within the past 2 years."
Tell me what you would've done differently.  They can't just sign LeBron after they take Lonzo Ball instead of Tatum.
Trade Brandon Ingram for CJ McCollum and RoCo Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball for Lauri Markannen  Sign Kyle Lowry in free agency Trade Steven Adams for PJ Washington   Lowry CJ RoCo Zion Lauri  PJ Hayes Bledsoe NAW Lewis Jr
no he doesn‚Äôt want to play with eric bledsoe or have Lonzo Ball be his third option
Zion and Lonzo Ball ruined the pelicans bubble games with terrible play
"Tbf Boogie and AD would have probably been nice if healthy the Pels can do anything about Boogie‚Äôs legs dying   What better matchup for the small ball perimeter warriors than the 2 best big men in the league on the same team  Also rn they have a second young star in Ingram, a 3rd guy in Lonzo, and a lot of  young pieces such as Hayes, Hart, NAW, Kira etc"
Who? Lonzo Ball?
"Damn, I was hoping you had the ‚ÄúLonzo Ball is better than Trae Young‚Äù thread. That was a classic brain dead hater thread"
"I am so happy this is happening to this piece of shit franchise and all the people who choose to defend their actions.   This is what you get for trading Jrue for the trash that is Bledsoe/Adams and worthless picks instead of trying to get into the playoffs and actually be a winning team for once. Don't tell me that Jrue would have left this franchise for absolutely nothing if they actually tried to compete for once, I don't believe it.    Fuck griffins' timeline/plan whatever you want to call it. Look at the suns going all in to compete now with two young guys who've been in the league for a similar time to BI and Zion. Players don't want to sit around and lose while griffin stocks up shitty picks and misses on them year after year. DEANDRE AYTON COULD BE A NBA CHAMPION A MONTH FROM NOW. Watch what the new Knicks decision makers are doing, they're not rotting at the bottom of the league, they went all in.   This is what you get for burning bridges with Lonzo and trying to constantly trade him at every opportunity. I am sure Zion is overjoyed at the prospect of losing the only guy who can hit a three next to him and that has actual chemistry with, while Adams and Bledsoe make millions to brick threes and get in his way.  When he watches BI brick away tens of games in the fourth quarter while Zion can't even get his hands on the ball. I am sure that excites him so much that no one has the Bball IQ to tell him to not do that.  When he sees a brain dead coaching hire of a tv personality who wasn't a good coach ten years ago let alone now.   When you don't even make the playoffs while putting up Shaq like numbers of course you'd want to leave. He saw what the idiots over in Cleveland did to waste LeBron's start of his career, he saw what happened with AD and how the first 7 years of his career where thrown away too. Luke saw those things too and is already taking action.  This generation has too much power to play the tanking loser game, either play to win or get me out of here. If he had any legitimate intention to win anything at any level in the NBA he needs to get away from this franchise ASAP. This is him giving this idiot franchise a chance that they don't deserve. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. GO INTO THE SEASON WITH THE INTENTION OF WINNING. Get rid of the trash that is Bledsoe/Adams, use those  worthless first rounders and BI who is at the height of his value to create a roster that makes some semblance of sense. Hire an actual modern NBA coach, get MDA on the phone right now, give him whatever number he asks for and see how things unfold. Enough is enough."
"I had an idea for a trade where Jimmy Butler goes to Portland, CJ McCollum and 2 Portland 1sts go to NOLA, Ingram go to Miami.  Portland goes all in with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk which is much better constructed than their current three guard lineup  Miami moves on from Jimmy since their current core isn‚Äôt getting it done and they don‚Äôt want to pay him $50m/y when he‚Äôs 35. Ingram and Bam are two young all stars they build around for the next ten years.   NOLA gets a veteran floor spacing shooting guard who can run point in a secondary ball handling role. You also get two more firsts, which you can package with other assets and a bad contract or two (see: bledsoe and/or adams) for a star.   Maybe the Trade needs to be rebalanced a bit with more picks here and there, etc. maybe a Miami pick to NOLA as well since they‚Äôre getting the best long term asset. But I think the core of the idea is sound.   Maybe you offer Bledsoe and 3-4 1sts for Grant, who the Pistons would definitely sell for that. Maybe you offer the Thunder Adams and 2 1sts for Horford (lol). Maybe you offer the Pacers Bledsoe and 2 1sts for TJ Warren, or Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Levert. Maybe you offer Bledsoe and picks for one of SexLand since that backcourt doesn‚Äôt have a long term future. On and on. So many options. Point is, between the Jrue and Ingram trades, you‚Äôd have ridiculous draft capital to pair with Bledsoe or Adams to build around CJ/Zion (and Lonzo?)."
It‚Äôs a drop in defense but I honestly think Lonzo brings more at this point. Plus Lonzo doesn‚Äôt demand the ball in his hands to be successful like Ben.
Starts don't always tell the story. A lot of people were saying Devin Booker was an empty stats guy but once he got decent pieces around him they started to turn it around. And I'm not talking about this here if you look at last year after DeAndre Eaton came back from his suspension the sons were above .500 . Now look at Brandon Ingram who puts up pretty similar stats to Devin Booker but had a monster in the paint and Zion Williamson who I'm sure most people would say is better than DeAndre Eaton and a decent point guard in Lonzo ball and they where the 11th seed...
"I think there were some other issues that took Lavar out of the limelight. r/nba actually started blocking threads about him so that killed any buzz about his name here. Also there seems like there was some funny business involving the money with BBB and I think at least Lonzo, maybe all the Ball brothers, stepped away from the brand."
"Real talk, Ben Simmons or Lonzo Ball"
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/hawks-76ers-ben-simmons-apologists-have-their-work-cut-out-for-them-and-the-process-is-hanging-by-a-thread/  There's a part here explaining how playmakers set up their teamates and why lonzo ball is struggling even if he is a superior passer.
just goes to show you how dumb magic was for drafting fucking lonzo ball.
"I'm tired of all the nonsense trade scenarios involving LaVine. The Bulls aren't going to trade him! He's a stud scoring guard and the exact type of player who will thrive in the playoffs.  The single biggest reason the Bulls have been scuffling the past few years (aside from Jim Boylen) is their lack of a decent Point Guard. I'm confident the new front office will plug that hole with someone the likes of: Lonzo Ball, Spencer Dinwiddie, Reggie Jackson, Cam Payne.   So the idea of LaVine in a 76ers jersey is just as improbable as Embiid in a Bulls jersey."
"Kuzma‚Äôs game doesn‚Äôt fit well with Lebron and AD. His growth is also stunted on the Lakers. If he gets traded, he might be able to improve like Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball."
Lonzo Ball
"Zion 100% he was the most hyped up player since lebron, and arguably the most hyped out player coming out of college. Lonzo ball also would of made a crazy amount"
"Lol, we believe that because we have a 60 yr track record of winning, why wouldnt players want to come to a competent winning organization? U act like our reputation isnt deaerved.  Look at our draft picks that we have up when lebron came....julius randle, dlo, brandon Ingram, lonzo ball, when we sucked we drafted incredibly well.   We traded for kobe draft pick, somehow its bad we are a better organization?   Your bucks team hasnt had anything close to that level of drafting.... and you have the expierience o being a lottery team. The lakers didnt and still was a top level team in terms of drafting.  Sorry r yall suck"
"Lonzo Liangelo and Lamelo team up together on the Denver Nuggets, coached by Lavar Ball and light up Ball Arena by winning 4 straight titles"
Ig Lonzo ball don‚Äôt exist
"So, his Lakers stint completely invalidates everything from 2012-2018? You're acting like players don't want to trade their teammates for upgrades. You should keep the same energy when you traded Lou Will for Rondo. Or Kevin Durant trading Levert and Allen for Harden.     [Did Lebron not help Kuzma up during the same series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbf5NcCtcw)? You clown on Lebron for walking away from Kuzma, but I know for a fact you call Kuzma trash and if he was on your team, you'd be wanting his ass traded as well. I bet you were calling Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram busts in comparison to SGA. Try to be consistent instead of coming across as an idiot."
"&gt;Zo sucks   Elfred Payton?  He started for us all year, and most of the playoffs.  Our backup is Derrek Rose, who is fragile, but serviceable.    I get that Lonzo isn't Luka, but we were so bad at the position, and we have so much free money, overpaying for the glaring weakness we had may be the best move.  Then we draft shooters and 3 and D wings.    This all could be moot if Rose stays (2 year deal would be great) and the kid from Argentina is competent enough to be a backup, some already say he is our starter.  [The guy who gets the ball at 3 seconds in, prepping in Vegas for Olympics.](https://twitter.com/cabboficial/status/1410387927360700416)"
Lonzo Ball
"idk theres literally no other difference between Kyle Lowry and Lonzo Ball as players, body types, etc so its really hard to tell"
This hurts the chances of getting Lonzo Ball back
"Honestly I‚Äôll believe it when I see it. I‚Äôd have loved to have seen Lebron off the ball more in these last few years, but instead we saw Rondo and Lonzo looking like spare parts out there. I think given everything we‚Äôve seen with Lebron, there‚Äôs no reason to believe he‚Äôll share playmaking or move off the ball - I hope he does and Russ becomes the primary facilitator. Happy to be proved wrong, I guess we‚Äôll see"
"What are the Lakers giving up? I mean, if I'm the Wizards, the Lakers package won't look appealing almost no matter what it is.  What... Kuzma + THT, maybe picks and/or KCP? Wizards aren't getting a lot of value in return, unless Kuzma develops much better over there, unlike he had been with the Lakers so far. Also, how do Russ and LeBron work together? Are they splitting posessions? Neither of them is great off the ball, so what's the idea there?  Also, trading Westbrook definitely means Beal is out as well. It'll be interesting to see where he goes. He can legitimately get back some picks plus a player that are actually impactful. Maybe NOLA for Lonzo, Josh Hart and some picks? I don't know if it works out tbh, but he gets you a lot more value than Russ. Zion and Beal would definitely make some noise, if NOLA can get a decent PG at some point."
"Lonzo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivica Zubac.   Jordan Clarkson, Svi Mykhailiuk Josh Hart, Larry Nance Jr, Thomas Bryant."
"This offseason we've got Terry Rozier, Lonzo Ball, Damian Lillard, Ben Simmons, Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroder, Tim Hardaway Jr., and Andre Drummond I'm hyped"
"From one bias fan to another. These medicore laker players we laker fans  just love to hype up such as jordan clarkson, larry nance, bradon ingram, josh hart, lonzo ball, julius randle and dlo actually do shockingly well on other teams."
Any idea where Lonzo Ball ends up?
"""Genius"" was hyperbolic but you're still not engaging with his point, which is that AK's signature move thus far was a trade that most neutral observers saw as dumb at the time and still do.   If the Vuc trade was dumb then your argument of ""AK isn't dumb so he wouldn't do a dumb thing like signing Schroder"" goes out the window. Not to mention [Shroder's already been linked to the Bulls by Woj](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002346-woj-lonzo-ball-dennis-schroder-could-be-bulls-targets-at-pg-in-free-agency).   There's a baseline assumption of AK's competency in the Bulls subreddit that doesn't line up at all with the outside narrative."
"thank you!!!!!  he was stuck behind Eric Bledsoe, isaiah thomas, and Kira Lewis Jr.   how is anybody supposed to get any opportunity with those guys soaking up all the minutes?   not to mention Zion and Ingram hogging the ball from Lonzo all game. 33 shot attempts and only 8 assists? i‚Äôm not a mathematician, but thats like 1 in 4, Lonzo would be way better   stan van is obviously just a hater. pels should get somebody at 17 to build around Lonzo and then buy a 2nd rounder to secure Gelo"
Lonzo Ball becomes a Bull
"Honestly I think you guys would be better off with Lonzo than Lowry, especially considering how long I'd expect your window to be open and Lowry's age. But Lonzo fits well with your half court offense as a catch-and-shoot/keep the ball moving passer, and could energize your transition offense... plus he's a good defender and rebounder."
Lonzo Ball? Dude has the ugliest shot ever.
Lonzo Ball.
"Lonzo Ball as ""The Child Wife""."
I think they should just pursue Lonzo Ball.  Would love to see Kidd teach him how he played.
Let the offense run through Lonzo and I promise you won‚Äôt regret it. He hasn‚Äôt been given the keys to the offense yet in the league and I think that‚Äôs held him back. He‚Äôs not good of a scorer/handler to be the number 1 but just let the offense flow through him. He‚Äôs not going to dribble a lot anyways he‚Äôs always moving the ball. I want a team to just trust him already. He‚Äôll have the Bulls up and running.
‚ÄúIf he wants to win a ring.‚Äù Lonzo Ball is not good enough to ring chase. He‚Äôs a player that needs to go to a team that wants him. Chicago seems like a likely option. And I wouldn‚Äôt count out Charlotte.
"Lakers made a ‚ÄúLaVar Ball rule‚Äù to limit the helicopter dad shit he was pulling when Lonzo was on the team, I‚Äôd love it for the less talented and less funny version to come in and take up the mantle"
I feel like Lonzo would definitely be fine and maybe ever possibly better playing exclusively off ball
Kyle Lowry in lieu of Lonzo Ball or alongside him? Cause I'll tell ya what - Jrue was about as good as Lowry and then some
"LaVar ""My son Lonzo doesn't need to be on a c+ caliber team like New Orleans he needs to be on a A+ team like  LA but not the purple and gold if you catch ny drift"" Ball"
The league starts to make a lot more sense when you start to think of players in terms of:  GUARD - primary ball handlers / usually good outside shooters who can penetrate  WING - perimeter players who are good at cutting / shooting / iso plays  BIG - those who would traditionally be referred to as Centers or PFs like Anthony Davis or Tim Duncan  Lonzo came into the league as a Guard but he's developed into a Wing that can play a Guard role in transition.
He‚Äôs way more capable than Lonzo on ball. They‚Äôre not really similar players.
&gt;  A point guard that doesn‚Äôt need the ball and can play really good defense.  That is more Lonzo than Lowry.  ahahahahahahah
It‚Äôs almost surreal the numbers that get thrown around for Lowry.  Most advanced numbers have him less valuable than Lonzo and a middle of the road NBA player.  This isn‚Äôt Chris Paul who makes every team he is on better.  Zion needs shooters around him.  A point guard that doesn‚Äôt need the ball and can play really good defense.  That is more Lonzo than Lowry.    Of course NO‚Äôs two big signings last season they had to give away draft picks to get rid of them before next season.  So we already know they don‚Äôt know what they are doing.
2018 Lonzo Ball  2018 Brandon Ingram  2018 Kyle Kuzma  2018 Josh Hart  Whatever year Ryan Hollins
"Skill wise of course. Half court playmaking wise lonzo isn't even on the same planet. As far as PGs go, I'd pick those two over lonzo any day of the week. But I can see how a team with a certain roster construction might prefer lonzo.    Namely, any young team whose primary ball handler isn't a traditional pg like Dallas or Chicago.    This is turning into a rant but if I were the pels I would match lonzo and trade for CJ McCollum."
"No, because I was specifically commenting to a guy about my experience with Brogdon when he played for my team, and then elaborating on his reply.  I think Brogdon is better than Lonzo.  But saying Brogdon is a good shooter off the ball is flat-out wrong."
"I have a solution   Sign and Trade   Hornets sign and Trade Malik Monk &amp; Devonte Graham to the Pelicans   Pelicans Sign and Trade Lonzo Ball to the Hornets   Pelicans Receive two Guards that can go off on any given night, they could start or lead a scoring bench.   Hornets get to keep Scary Terry, and Acquire Lonzo Ball.   The Hornets offer a Trade package to the Pacers  for Miles Turner including the 11th Pick, future 1st Top 10 protected, Cody Zeller, Brad Wanamaker   Or that same package in a sign and trade for Jarrett Allen or Offer him the bag.  Wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to them pursuing Richaun Holmes or Mitchell Robinson either"
"If I'm the Mavs I'm doing everything in my power to get two of Lonzo Ball, Gary Trent Jr, or Richaun Holmes this off season."
"Lonzo has no first step, floater or mid range. His ball handling isn't good enough to get past anyone. He's a good three point shooter and good in transition. He'd be terrible in close playoff games as the lead guard."
"That‚Äôs my thing. I like Lonzo but everytime I see someone saying hes ‚Äúelite‚Äù defensively I have to stop myself from arguing. He‚Äôs GREAT off ball. Solid on-ball. However you parse that out in totality, he‚Äôs not ELITE Zion the same sense Jrue is.   He‚Äôs such a unique player it lends itself to disagreements. I even think he‚Äôs pretty good and find my self arguing with his stans AND his detractors."
The Magic 8 Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball really isn't that much different from Eric Bledsoe.
in no universe is lonzo ball a better player than jrue holiday. the lakers traded him for a reason.
"Lonzo also has room to regress. The main highlight of this season that has everyone high on him is improved FT% and 3p%. His 3p% is...good, but hardly elite, and very streaky. And his FT% is a marginal thing because he can't drive the basket and is afraid of contact. It's very possible he has an outlier 3p% shooting season and, suddenly, the rest of his faults are a lot, lot more severe.  Basically he's a 3 and D guy who can play solid on ball defense. For a team that needs exactly those things he's possibly very valuable but I think having him as one of your primary guy risks crippling your ceiling as a team.   He is young. He could also always improve. But the Pelicans don't want to get caught holding the overpay bag just because he as ""their"" guy. It's happened to a bunch of teams with middling players.  Lowry's a longtime playoff vet and basically does everything you want a PG to do well, well. He'd be an immediate improvement at very minimal loss for the Pelicans, but his age prevents him from being a long term solution at the position. I think the hope for the Pelicans is that possibly Kira and/or NAW emerge and improve to the point where they could take over for Lowry once he ages out of good play, or possibly find another option and use Lowry as an expiring at some point.  I'm kind of fine with either. If we re-sign Lonzo I'll just cross my fingers and hope he improves. If we let him go/SnT him and get Lowry then I know our team will be immediately improved for the next couple of season but will obviously have to expect a decline and replacement at some point, so I can't get attached. There's pros and cons on both sides."
"I don‚Äôt think it does, but it definitely increases their stats/production   Like for example, if Lonzo, Ingram, Russel and Randle were all on the same team, all of their usage would go down as there‚Äôs only one ball so it‚Äôs incredibly likely their raw stats would decrease   I can‚Äôt think of another team that‚Äôs traded as many of their young players away as the lakers"
"Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Ivaca Zubac, Jordan Clarkson, Alex Caruso üî•"
"Lonzo Ball for Wiggins, 7 and 14. Griffin then trades back with Memphis again. But since Lonzo is a RFA, that may not be possible . Particularly with the Warriors payroll."
"BREAKING: Pelicans offer Lonzo a ground breaking superb-max contract, by offering Zo and Liangelo Ball both 4 year max contracts on the under the table condition that Gelo has to give 50% of his deal to Zo. It made no sense because he was restricted but Lonzo Ball is now the highest paid NBA player of all time.They then cut Gelo because he's not worth the roster spot even while making 20 mil a year."
hes a million times better than lonzo ball... watching zo in the bubble was tragic
So did Lonzo ball breaking a record has nothing to do with the hall
Lonzo Ball imploring for a trade
"That applies when you're maxing a guy like John Collins or Lonzo Ball. This would be like the Grizzlies trading away Morant to not pay him just so they can get some high picks and draft someone like, well, Morant."
Dare I say Lonzo Ball?
"I get why everyone thinks it‚Äôs funny, I think it sounds pretty goofy initially as well due to the media notoriety of the Balls, but I just really can‚Äôt overstate how serious I am when it comes to actual on-court fit. I think one of the bigger detriments to Lonzo‚Äôs career and reputation has been his classification as a point guard rather than a shooting guard/wing capable of great perimeter defense and switching, while being a competent shooter and off-ball player.   For example, although it all worked out for the Lakers in the end, I think keeping DLo and Lonzo was completely realistic and rather than delegating Lonzo full point guard duties, DLo should‚Äôve ran the one and Lonzo should‚Äôve been a capable ball handler and defender who wasn‚Äôt under as much pressure to score at all 3 levels while constantly initiating offense. His time with Bledsoe didn‚Äôt work because Bledsoe can‚Äôt shoot and didn‚Äôt give a single shit on the Pelicans, I still think he can be great with another facilitator who lowers the pressure on him and allows him to go to work off ball defensively, set screens, and spot up, while still initiating some possessions and rotating in as the point guard."
"&gt;With that in mind, what hypothetical post-1966 territorial picks would have greatly changed the trajectory of league history?  The Lakers are even more unbeatable -- to a completely ridiculous extent.    They get Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a rookie.  They get Bill Walton a few years later.  They get Sidney Wicks. They get Marques Johnson.  They get Paul Westphal ( from USC ).  They get Kiki Vandeweghe.  Basically, the Lakers have UCLA as a farm team, during the period when UCLA was as-dominant as any basketball team ever.  Things that would've happened as a result:  * Milwaukee doesn't win a championship until last week.  Portland, Seattle, and Washington are still waiting to win one.  The Knicks are still waiting as well. * The early-seventies Lakers win a handful of titles with Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Gail Goodrich, and others * The Lakers don't trade All-stars Archie Clark and Darrall Imhoff for Wilt Chamberlain in '68, and are even more loaded as a result.  Chamberlain retires with just one ring. * The late-seventies Lakers, with prime Abdul-Jabbar and prime Walton ( and a ton of other excellent players that they didn't have to trade for Kareem and Wilt ) legitimately might have gone 82-0.  They collect another handful of rings. * The Lakers follow Boston's Sixties domination with equal domination in the Seventies, winning almost all of the titles. * Abdul-Jabbar retires with 14 or more rings,  plus all his other records.  No one even questions his status as the greatest athlete in American history.  So, fairly earth-shaking consequences.  And that's not considering them getting Westbrook later.  Or Reggie Miller. Or Kevin Love.  Or Lonzo Ball -- wait a minute."
"Yes. His name is Terry Rozier.  Lonzo isn't going to replace that scoring or dog mentality, and Terry has also been improving steadily ever since he first got to Charlotte. Hes still young as well, and has been significantly more durable than Lonzo as well.  Lets say we're afraid of him wanting a big salary: well, give him this year to prove it. If he balls out, excellent, we probably played well and we'll have his Bird Rights anyways. If he doesnt, also excellent, because now we can get him at a discount, or even trade him then.   To me, it makes more sense to try to trade Terry at the deadline anyways *if* you were to move him  We have LaMelo, a legit PG. You say we need a secondary ball handler? Terry does that. We need stalwart defense? Terry does that. We need someone who can shoot 3s? Terry does that.   The only thing Lonzo does better than Terry, IMO, is rack up assists. And while that's all well and good, we already had one of the slower and more vapid offenses in the league, and losing a scorer like Terry isn't going to help that."
Lonzo Ball
Lol this. As a Laker fan are delusional enough to think you‚Äôre getting Lowry and Derozan? Return of Lonzo Ball ? Or do you have much more realistic expectations for your off season?
"Lonzo can play ball, but he just doesn‚Äôt fit with Zion. Zion would do better with a better perimeter/catch and shoot style player. It would spread the floor, provide more threats, and thus increase Zions effectiveness.   I don‚Äôt have the answers, but I‚Äôm sure their front office will make it all work within a few seasons (please lord)"
"It‚Äôs not that hard to understand, he‚Äôs a Ball brother and Lonzo and Lavar were in ESPN headlines just as much as LeBron and Curry. People love to click on the headlines that have those names in them, so they get the spotlight"
"Here are the two first results when you google 2017 NBA mock draft, both are from 2017.  https://www.nba.com/news/2017-mock-draft-third-edition  &gt;The pick for the Boston Celtics at No. 1 would have been Fultz ‚Ä¶ and the pick for the 76ers at No. 1 will be Fultz. Not only is he the top prospect in the Draft in a consensus of front offices, Fultz is practically an ideal fit for the 76ers because he can play off the ball with Ben Simmons or in place of Simmons if the 2016 first choice is resting or struggling in his transition to point guard.  This has Jayson Tatum going to the Kings at #5 with the Celtics taking Jackson at #3.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/5/16/15646832/nba-mock-draft-2017-markelle-fultz-boston-celtics-lonzo-ball-los-angeles-lakers  &gt;1. Boston Celtics ‚Äî Markelle Fultz, PG, Washington  &gt;If you were making a modern NBA point guard in a lab, he would look a lot like Markelle Fultz. Every tool is here: size, speed, length, shooting, and the ability to finish above the rim. What really separates Fultz is his creativity off the bounce. Sometimes that means hitting open cutters with a pass. Sometimes it means finding new ways to score out of the pick-and-roll. There are a lot of great talents in this draft, but Fultz has emerged as the **easy** pick at No. 1. The Celtics should have themselves a franchise player."
Lonzo.  The disrespect is ridiculous.    Plus defender and plus 3pt shooter who looked decent off ball.   Dude shot 37.8% on 8 attempts a game lol.
Why does Detroit even care about the pick then? They should probably just offload it for a known commodity like Lonzo Ball or something then. Wouldn't wanna take a risk and mess up all the crazy *success* they're having up there in Detroit.
"Oh ok, then write in siakam, or oladipo, or Ryan Anderson. Has og anouby made the jump yet?   Lonzo ball is playing well and is one of the better point guards in the league. That may be who he is. If you want to go for a championship, then having your 2nd best player be a siakam or oladipo or Ryan Anderson makes that very, very hard."
"except unlike simmons and wiggins, lonzo has shown marked improvement every year hes been in the league, while the aforementioned 2 others are relatively the same offensive players they were when they were rookies, with ben simmons possiblly having regressed. if im a team that already has a decent core and just needs a starting point guard to help lead into the future, my first inclination isnt a 35 year old lowry. i actually think pellies letting lonzo ball go would be something we look back on when zion decides to leave in the future as one of the big mistakes that led to that collapse, even if zion is the one pushing for lowry"
How much is Lonzo Ball worth is todays NBA? Is he a 10 million a year player or 20? I have no clue.
"i think memphis wins this trade   pels clear capspace which they dont really need. If i was a pelly fan ill rather have lonzo than kyle lowry. They try to compete now but does jonas really move the needle that much for them?  on the other hand, memphis moves up 7 spots into the lottery, get 'leadership' with steven and bledsoe, and who knows, god forbid the lakers have some bad injury or lebron just ages rapidly, but say lakers get injured again next year, that pick could potentially be in the 13-20 range. Basically they gave jonas away for 2 bites at the draft apple with the biggest bite being this year at number 10, which historically doesnt produce stars, but decent high upside starters. Memphis positions themselves a bit better for the futture while orleans gets jonas for a year and space to potentially chase lowry instead of signing ball?"

Lonzo Ball expecting a big pay day so this is one play for NOLA
"In terms of increasing wins? It's quite obvious that NOLA benefits based on their goals.   JV gives NOLA a Center that can actually stay on the floor when Zion is playing.   Losing Bledsoe is addition by subtraction. He wasn't a good fit in NOLA. Having the ball in his hands over Zion, Ingram, or Ball was bad. I don't think he's washed like a lot of people here or that he's a bad player, he just has a skillset that you want to include not duplicate.   It looks to me like now NOLA will watch the market for Lonzo and just match whatever offer comes.   They'll give him 6 months to a year and then trade him.   The background here is that Zion is already unhappy with the organization and losing. So despite being a fairly young team, they have pressure to start getting vets and winning games."
"I wouldn't call Brook Lopez a volume shooter either.  Zion was good on Defense in College I think he'll be fine.  Ingram is tall and I've actually seen him bother some people on D.  Jrue is such a better ball handler and team leader than Lonzo, I see it more likely that Lonzo gets traded and they go hard for Kyle Lowry"
It‚Äôs not even the cream of the crop. Because theoretically an American b team should medal in the olympics even thouhh GB European and African talent has greatly improved over the past 4 years. The problem is chemistry and team comp. I know this sounds pretty troll but players like lonzo ball or  Duncan Robinson would greatly help because they will still be playing their role even though they aren‚Äôt perennial all stars. The only player that‚Äôs greatly missed is lebron not because he‚Äôs the best but because he does everything great that doesn‚Äôt Involve scoring. Which none of the players on this team understand
Is there any way we can trade for FIBA Rubio instead of signing Lonzo Ball?
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, and a good handful of others have achieved mediocrity at best on the Lakers(with maybe the exception being Brandon Ingram), only to flourish and improve once they left the Lakers.  The Lakers have done some pretty solid drafting the past six years or so, but they have done a terrible job at actually developing the players they draft."
"With those kind of numbers, I'm thinking he's a 3 &amp; D wing. 32 is a little old for a wing player, 3 peat or not. I would pay him a good deal, but without a no trade clause and I would look to move him if necessary.  Don't forget to compare his attributes to other players in his position, just to make sure you don't hold on to him for too long.   Lastly, does he make your team better?  His he a Defense Leader, Dimes or Offensive Playmaker?   If not, I would sign him just to trade him down the road.   Players that make your team better are essentially priceless, especially if they do it on both sides of the ball, ie Ben Simmons and sometimes Lonzo Ball is like that too."
"He doesnt have a 60 win contender around himself anymore because he is a petty asshole.  He could have traded Kawhi to the Lakers - most likely they wouldnt have won a chip with Paul George anyways.  If anything it makes Pop and the Spurs look like the bigger men by shipping Kawhi out (bc even if he was a piece of shit he did win Finals MVP and helped the Spurs bring home a chip) to his destination of choice.  Just like in the Harden deal (where they could have had Ben Simmons), Pop's pettiness cost the Spurs organization wins and most importantly money.  Lonzo is playing great ball to the point where the Lakers are considering bringing him back to play point in LeBron's final push for one last chip.  Josh Hart is a decent bench player, as is Kuzma.  The grandfather deal was Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart, probably a pick or two involved as well - and POP TURNED IT DOWN.  He didnt turn it down for a better haul or a player he wanted - nope he turned it down for DeMar DeFrozen when even a new poster to r/NBA would laugh at the idea of Kawhi for DeRozan.  Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma/Hart is wayyyyyy better than DeFrozen/Poetl and you can thank Pop for that."
"Lonzo was never annoying or did any types of antics. He is a relatively reserved dude. His brother LiAngelo was the one that caused drama in China. The father is just hyping his kids up like any father should. I don't think it is a big deal.  Anyways he just came off the best season of his career. Shot the ball well from deep, defensively was solid and his playmaking is still good. But the Pels need a third scorer and someone that can facilitate at a higher level. They also have this Bledsoe contract they need to get rid of as well."
"My guess/hope is that we are going to preserve max space for next offseason. My prediction is trading for sexton, extending mitch, letting noel walk (only because he wants more than we want to give a back up, he deserves a big payday for how great he played last year), and signing maybe 1 long term deal or trading for it.    If rose walks i think we make an offer to Brunson. I also think we use our cap space to influence bigger deals for guys like Schroder and norm Powell. Really not sure what happens with burks or bullock.   I think that the big story behind day 1 of the offseason will be Chicago offering 4/100 for lonzo ball. Im scared that if we don't make the sexton trade, and Chicago does that, that our FO might feel obligated to offer Dinwiddie or Schroder 20M"
"Rondo, Paul, Lowry, hell even Lonzo Ball would bring something we could use to the roster"
"i would take the lonzo ball and BI package but I doubt the pelicans would want to do that. if embiid and simmons didnt work, zion and simmons will definitely not work"
"(Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart)"
"No lie the USA line up needs to be Jrue-Khris-Grant-KD-Bam/Dray. Have KD be the scorer; Grant can be that Melo role of just spot up shooting, Khris takes Kobe role at closing, and Jrue takes Kobe/Kidd role of defensive stopper. Have KD be what he always was. No lie I would rather have Lonzo Ball as my PG with this team, they need someone that moves the ball."
Kyrie in Boston KD in OKC Lonzo Ball in LA Harden in Houston Dwight Howard in LA  That's my guess.
If Stockton played today he'd get bullied in the post by Lonzo ball
"As someone who stopped following, what ever happened with Lonzo Ball? I hated him at first because of his and his father's antics. I was rooting for him to fail. Did that end up happening? I feel kinda bad for him now. It's just that he was so obnoxious..."
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
TayShaun Prince Lonzo Ball Marc Gasol
"This is def a FA pitch to Lonzo, All 3 Ball brothers on a team could be $$$ to both parties."
"I think they would, Lonzo is a great passer but a bad shot creator in the half court, playing off a better playmaker like LaMelo would benefit him a lot I think.  Plus he's a big guard that can defend and rebound.  The playmaking with the Ball bros and Hayward on the court would be a joy to watch."
"Lonzo and Melo's game do actually fit pretty well together. Lonzo's better playing off ball in the half court in catch and shoot/cut to rim situations. Melo's better at creating and playmaking, both are great in transition, and Lonzo's a really good defender and rebounding guard."
They would be such a bad fit. Lonzo and Melo move the ball and Gelo can brick it. He isn‚Äôt an NBA player. He should be trying to survive overseas instead of being the joke brother.
"Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo Ball, Lamelo Ball"
"full text:  #29 NBA teams are poverty franchises right now  As I sit back and watch the aftermath of the 2021 NBA Finals, I can't help but feel pity for the city of Milwaukee and Bucks fans all across the Earth.  The Milwaukee Bucks are a poverty franchise.  Imagine being a dry, parched traveler in the desert of championships, on the quest for gold. Finally, you stumble across a gold nugget. Is this any reason to celebrate? Is this any reason to jump in the streets, shout, and cry?   Winning one championship does not merit celebration. What matters are *dynamics* - a history of SUSTAINED dominance in the NBA! Championship franchises understand this. True fans of the Los Angeles Lakers understand this. Poverty franchises do not.  But what's more, it's become evident that 29 of the current NBA franchises are all poverty franchises. The only exception is the Los Angeles Lakers.  ""But what about the Boston Celtics? They also have 17 championships."" yes, but they frontloaded 11 of their rings in an era with just eight teams. The Celtics have won 1 championship since 1986 - 35 years ago. That is not sustained dominance. That is what we call a fluke.  The Los Angeles Lakers have won in every era. Fast pace, slow pace, high parity, low parity, the Lakers have won it all.   When the Celtics began the trend of artificial superteams 2007, it was Kobe Bryant who stopped them from being remembered as a dynasty.   When the Spurs formed a natural dynastic franchise, it was Shaq and Kobe - and later Kobe - who made sure to knock them out in the playoffs in most of their meetings.  When Larry Bird was looking dominant and won 3 MVPs in a row, it was Magic Johnson who made sure to limit him to only three rings.  When the NBA just started, it was George Mikan who established the Lakers as the premier franchise from the get-go with five rings.  A winner's mentality is about the long-term, not the short run. This is why I'm still adamant that the AD trade was a bad trade - sure we got *one* ring out of it, but we gave up a future GOAT contender in Lonzo Ball, a future 3-time MVP in Brandon Ingram, and a future 5x All-Defensive 1st Team player in Josh Hart. With AD, we get maybe one or two rings. With the aforementioned 3, we get 6 or 7 rings.  But no matter! Bucks fans should be CRYING right now - because the Bucks just won a ring at the expense of the weakest Western Conference Finalist since 1986, since Bucks fans seem so overjoyed, Giannis no longer feels a sense of duty to Milwaukee. He will thus demand a trade to the Lakers by the end of August, and will suit up for the Purple and Gold at the start of the 2021-2022 season alongside LeBron, AD, Dame, and Lonzo, starting an 8-ring Laker dynasty."
Lebron and Lonzo Ball/Brandon Ingram as his best players is not winning a championship lmao   BI was decent but Lonzo was not good in LA
"That has nothing to do with ""hype"". Lavar Ball exists. Lonzo was more hyped than Fultz."
I was right about Fox. I saw that game against UCLA in the tourney and questioned why people would take Lonzo over him. That‚Äôs not to say Ball is bad; He‚Äôs proven himself to be a good player in this league after a few years of development.
Lonzo lol we went to high school together and I saw his work ethic but his dad was insufferable and talked mad shit on our baseball team. glad he focused on ball
"Honestly Lonzo ball take isn‚Äôt bad yet.    He just averaged 15/5/6 with 2 turnovers and 55% TS. It‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll ever be a perennial All NBA player, but I would be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt make an all star game or two over his next few years. (If he lands on the right team for him)"
"Remember when lakers were just lonzo ball brandon ingram and Kyle kuzma then 2 years later lakers were one overhaul trade from landing a big 3 of kawhi AD and lebron? Maybe its unlikely but goddamn it , im not gonna say its impossible"
I thought Lonzo Ball was going to be a perennial All Star.  I thought Ben Simmons was going to be the next bad ass PG
Lonzo Ball
"Westbrook to the Lakers to set up the ultimate rivalry with Nets for the possible 2022 Finals showdown \[assuming health\]   Kyrie vs LeBron  Durant vs Westbrook  Harden vs AD  Also Lonzo joins his bro in Charlotte to form a deadly ""Ball Brothers"" backcourt.  And Lillard to 76ers but Blazers end up getting the better deal because Joel blows out his knee once and for all. Dame stuck on 76ers now without anyone and they miss playoffs.  Ben Simmons, McCollum become besties and lead Blazers to playoffs as top seed in West and are like ""Dame who"" but they lose to Lakers in WCF  Kuzma becomes first team all NBA after joining Wizards and leads Wizards to the ECF alongside Beal. Kuzma drops 27/12/6 line on 46/40/82 shooting splits"
Lonzo ball
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
"Fantastic stuff!      I'm worried about Williamson's future in New Orleans. I quite honestly think that losing Lonzo Ball will hurt the Pelican's future, because of Ball's chemistry with Williamson. We've seen it time and time again, an uber-athletic player just doesn't play to his potential and is shipped out to another team, only for that team to have an actual point guard and be able to utilize those athletic gifts. John Collins in Atlanta. Miles Bridges in Charlotte. Lob City's DJ. All of these guys are players who were effective before they got a point guard, but became elite because of a point guard. Case in point, I think losing Lonzo Ball's passing will hurt the Pelican's, and more importantly Zion's, offense.      That being said, I do think some of the skills are replaceable. Kira Lewis and NWA are solid and need another season's worth of evaluation, but look to be decent replacements. Ingram's scoring is there, and there's been a continuous upgrade to his half-court creation season-by-season. And Zion himself could become a better creator and finisher. But those are just what ifs. Losing Lonzo Ball's passing on the Pels isn't a what if, those lobs are on the money every time."
Lonzo Ball will go to Chicago and be an all star in the near future yall heard it here first  Lonzo and Lavine will be one of the scariest eastern backcourts
"You said Gasol era picks. The Gasol era is from 2008-2014. Now you want to talk about the young core era. Okay.   Randle was recovering from a season ending injury in 2015, so 2016 was his first full year. By the time 2018 rolled around, he was already beginning to come into his own and had the starting spot locked up from Nance Jr. and Kuzma. Even then, he actually regressed in his first season in NY before surprising everyone this past year.   D'Lo was already showing flashes but it's hard to judge a player after just 2 seasons, especially with a terrible coach like Byron Scott. He also had that off-court distraction with Nick Young the season after. Him taking off had a lot to do with less media attention and being away from the LA spotlight, not exactly the Lakers development team. Ditto with Lonzo Ball. Hart is still the same guy lol.   Ingram steadily improved every year and before the blood clot issues in 2019, he was the Lakers' most consistent player and was already putting up all star numbers.   The jury is out on Kuzma, but I'm definitely sure he'd do great washington, having already developed his all-around skills after being forced to adapt continuously once AD and Bron came into town.   The common denominator between Randle, Ball, Ingram, and D'Lo is that you're judging our development team based on their first 2-3 seasons of development.   What you fail to realize is players typically take a few seasons to actually develop and the normal make or break year is the 3rd season. D'Lo was only with us for 2 seasons. Randle broke out with us during his 3rd full season. Ingram was beginning to break out in his 3rd season before getting sidelined by blood clot issues."
Lonzo Ball might actually be kinda nice in international play
"Lonzo Ball 45%, 42%, 57%, 78%"
"My top five  1. Gary Trent Jr   2. Kevin Porter Jr.  3. Lonzo Ball  4. Kelson Johnson  5. Kyle Kuzma  I feel like most of the people mentioned are   - Stars (Zion, Shai, Sabonis, Ja), and would need a 1st team All-NBA or an MVP to win  - Second Year (LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton), and would all need to be legitimate stars to win it since there is a bias   - Guys that will probably be mostly as good if not a little better (FVV, Ben, Fox)"
"Okay, not saying the Bulls are going to finish above the Hawks, and the defense is a legitimate concern‚Ä¶ but ball sharing? DeRozan was top 15 in the league in assists last year, and Lonzo is anything but selfish. Vuc is already about as good of a Center as you can find not named Jokic at making the extra pass too. Even Lavine finished top 50 in assists per game last year. That feels like a weird complaint."
"‚ÄúHey we just signed Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan. You know who we should trade for? Ben Simmons. DeMar and Ben Simmons. And then you‚Äôve got Lonzo off ball. I mean come on, it‚Äôs perfect. What a trio.‚Äù   -	Said no one ever (except Bill Simmons I guess)"
"It‚Äôs not about Zion‚Äôs spacing, the fucker could have 5 people in the paint and not give a shit since he can bully his way out of it. BI doesn‚Äôt have that luxury because he‚Äôs realistically the only ball handler that can shoot since Lonzo can only do well on catch and shoot, you were fucking him over with that trade more than anyone else which is why I said it made no sense."
"? Maybe you're being hyperbolic but our number one problem was not hero ball. It was a complete lack of shooting and thus spacing from our starting guards; Bled and Lonzo.   Maybe he isn't a starter, maybe he is. Idk. We should def find out this year."
Lamelo ball has as many fans if not more then Zion. Plus lonzo in Chicago now a huge market. Not to mention how good Chicago is. I think Chicago will have. Xmas game at the least
"Technically, OKC does not have cap space. They have $50 million worth of TPEs, which count against the cap. They could rescind those, but they‚Äôd lose some flexibility if they did that. I think the Thunder are going to work a trade in the next few days to make use of the big TPE that expires Monday. That could involve Markkanen. Hell, it could involve expanding the Lonzo Ball S&amp;T to include a Lauri S&amp;T to OKC, where OKC also takes Aminu‚Äôs contract."
"&gt;but their ceiling for the next season is probably lower and that's okay  I do agree with that, while I feel Russ is one of the greatest competitors we have in the NBA, I think the ball in more peoples hands may benefit them well. I think they'll end up around the same record though and that'll put them in a similar place as they were last year.   &gt;Also for Detroit I could see them getting into Tier 4 if they have a good season. I like the pieces they just need time to gel together.  Imo it all depends on Cade and Killian. If Cade comes out and players like ROY averages like 17 ppg, and Killian develops after missing most of the 1st season into a Lonzo type player we could end up getting mid-30s wins imo."
"Bulls will probably close with Lonzo - Caruso - LaVine - DeRozan - Vucevic.   It was so stupid of them to give up Thad Young though, he would have been a perfect small ball 5 in matchups where Vooch can't play."
The Lonzo Ball/Devonte Graham/DeMar Derozan S&amp;Ts about to conglomerate into a one massive trade that will merge with the Dinwiddie trade to form the largest trade in NBA history.
"I don‚Äôt see how you can say the pelicans got worse unless you really think getting rid of lonzo outweighs shipping off both bled and Adams for Jonas and the 17th pick which they got a good wing. They also hit a home run on their coaching staff too, going from svg to willie green who seem to be really well respected around the league and had a big part in the suns defense while also adding MDA as a mentor to him is great. My only problem was they missed on the big name free agents and although they fixed the spacing issues on the team‚Ä¶the defense didn‚Äôt really get that much better. They got a lot of young wings and resigned didi who was known for his defense in the nbl but I think it‚Äôs a bit unfair to make the young guys grow up so fast. I do think Zion and Bi will show improvement on that side of the ball. I don‚Äôt really have much of a problem with the graham move since he‚Äôs basically just a mini lonzo expect way better on offense but worse on defense and he‚Äôs for half the price. I think the pels are a 10th-7th seed team depending on how the youth of this team grows."
"Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Jordan Clarkson would like to have a word.."
"PG: Lonzo Ball, SG: De'Aaron Fox, SF: OG, PF: Tobias Harris, C: DeAndre Ayton"
NOLA fucked up not keeping Lonzo Ball.
Lonzo Ball: ‚ÄúDavid Griffin is the dumbest general manager in sports.‚Äù
Lonzo Ball - Jamal Murray - Jerami Grant - John Collins - Clint Capela.
"The Bulls have gotten their fair share of big free agents over the years, just not Lebron, KD or Kawhi. Demar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball this year, Rondo and DWade in 2016, Pau Gasol in 2014, Carlos Boozer the year of the decision, Ben Wallace a while back. They get more big free agents than the Knicks"
"Or another schedule adjustment I would do as an alternative   - 12:00 pm- Hornets vs Bulls- Lonzo vs LaMelo on Christmas...nothin like a good old fashioned sibling rivalry game on Christmas...The Ball family will be in attendance for this game guaranteed. LaVar and Tina will be there to watch their sons go at it. LaMelo gets to play on Xmas for the first time ever and who better for him to go up against on Xmas than his older brother, Lonzo?  - 2:30 pm- Hawks vs Knicks- Rematch of the 1st Round of the Playoffs...almost a true rivalry game because of the fact that Trae became a villain in The Garden and Knicks get their chance at payback...this game happens at the Garden  - 5:00 pm- Suns vs Bucks- Rematch of the 2021 NBA Finals...it is only fitting and the game happens in Milwaukee   - 8:00 pm- Nets vs Lakers- KD vs LeBron on Christmas...Westbrook also gets to go up against KD on Christmas with his new team the Lakers. Plus this is a Finals preview more or less the NBA Finals matchup we should have got this past season but we were robbed of. Plus it gets to go down at Staples Center.  - 10:30 pm (late nighter)- Mavericks vs Warriors- Luka vs Steph on Christmas because it isn't Christmas without either of these guys being there on the marquee"
"I love Zach, but he isn‚Äôt really much of a playmaker. His assist to turnover ratio is awful and open guys seem almost invisible to him at times. We‚Äôve tried him a lot at PG and it‚Äôs never successful. This is why we desperately needed to address our team passing/playmaking. Lonzo is at least great in fast paced transition offense and DeMar is a great halfcourt playmaker. With their skills combined we can take Zach‚Äôs usage way down and have him play off ball where he‚Äôs stupidly efficient with DeMar as point-forward."
"I dont think the issue and question in hand is whether or not it is a ""bad"" thing to have Lonzo Ball on your basketball team in a vacuum. It's about what his value is and how important what he does is in the grand scheme of things. Him being polarizing is just rooted in his draft status and Ball name, his skill set isnt particularly confounding/unique or conducive to that much debate at all frankly in and of itself."
Simmons super easily. I'd stop trying to call him a point guard and close games with him as a small ball 5 and he's give you so much more than Lonzo does
"Really depends on the team imo, if I were the warriors I‚Äôd rather have Simmons, if I were the bulls I‚Äôd rather have ball. Simmons isn‚Äôt a point guard (despite what my fantasy app calls him), he‚Äôs a forward with ball handling skills, the bulls have that already with demar/Lavine so they needed lonzo, a traditional point guard with great passing and potential for elite shooting. Warriors have possibly the best point guard ever already so they don‚Äôt need lonzo, but if Ben switched to sf/pf than he could be a great addition to the warriors, although maybe a bit redundant to have green and Simmons."
Lonzo Ball
I have an interesting idea.  Simmons to Chicago  CJ and a 1st to the 76ers  Markkanen (S&amp;T) and Lonzo Ball to the Blazers
"None of them are like Monk, Monk is a true off ball player that just needs open shots  Ingram needs the ball, Kuzma is not a good enough shooter and neither was Lonzo when he was in LA  Current Lonzo shooting nearly 40% would be great with LeBron"
Yeah so Lonzo and Ben can just pass the ball back and forth to each other until the shot clock expires lol
"I feel like he is pretty redundant with lonzo ball, but maybe my idea of balls game isn‚Äôt up to date."
"Some people act like he's not even a starting caliber NBA player lmao last year people were putting him as a top 20 player and are way overcorrecting that.   But his lack of improvement is concerning, Lonzo Ball went from awful shot mechanics to a high quality shooter, Giannis at least *attempts* 3's and is passable on mid-range (his playoff percentages are surprisingly pretty good), and Simmons passes wide open layups. It's definitely a mental thing at this point and I hope this moment in his career awakens something because people were saying he's the next LeBron or Magic type player, Giannis with better playmaking, etc."
What‚Äôs he good at ? Passing the ball ? Defense ? Is Lonzo a star is Ricky Rubio a star
This is a new one. Lonzo was one of the less turnover prone ball handlers on that team last year. Quit manufacturing shit. Next you'll tell me he always fouled out
"So refreshing to see someone finally understand why, also to add we desperately need a playmaker and signing Lonzo to that would have stopped us from ever having one. The alternative we could have matched but he didn't want to be here because he wanted a big market and still sees himself as the primary ball handler."
"If you ever wore purple and gold, I gotta root for you no matter what. I want all of those guys to succeed, whether you're Josh Hart, or Thomas Bryant, or Lonzo Ball. I want all those guys to have amazing careers. üíúüíõ"
"not to hate on the bucks or anything, but they're getting a lot of love in this thread for having just won, but they lost pj tucker and bryn forbes and they added semi ojeleye and rodney hood...  meanwhile miami added tucker, lowry, and one of the psycho twins, as well as a bunch of people i don't know  the bulls added caruso, lonzo, and demar to lavine and vucevich.   the sixers added dru- never mind.  the wizards have got dinwiddie, kuzma, kcp, and harrell and they still have beal and rui.   the knicks added kemba to their hospital guard rotation too.  the celtics added back horford, shed their weakness in kemba, added kanter, and are still in the market for a few moves.   now i don't know that all of these teams will click, but these aren't weak teams, and that makes the east just that little bit harder to roll through in the playoffs, and brooklyn is still around with their big 4 or 6 or whatever they're up to now.  and since there's only 3 contenders to list, i think brooklyn has to be the one in the east, because they're the only team that is capable of beating every other team in a best of 7, even when unhealthy (see: bucks series).  but then someone will ask why i only give 1 to the east - i don't think the lakers will come out of the west guaranteed. the clippers still exist, the jazz and suns are largely unchanged with some small additions, the warriors have klay coming back mid-season hopefully, and portland's going to have a lot to prove to keep dame around.   there's also some of those smaller markets to consider who could trip up the big teams at vital moments and influence the seeding by stealing wins, even if they're not contenders. NOLA is making moves, though we're yet to see what comes of that now they've missed lowry and paul. minnesota has KAT, dlo, and anthony edwards, and i don't rate them, but people seem to have some hope they might all be healthy and ball out. i'm interested in memphis and what they'll do with ja running around adams, and there's always some fun to be had watching OKC do their thing.   lastly there's the kings, but i don't think we have to worry about them bothering anyone, so i didn't even really need to include them did i.  tldr: east - nets; west - pick two of lakers, warriors, clippers, suns, jazz.   ps. people will also say the suns had lucky injury influenced runs. i say don't count out a team full of young guys who ran to the finals on their first every playoff run. they'll believe they can do it again and i fully expect them to be a top 4 seed"
I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that Lonzo Ball straight up told the Pelicans that he had zero interest in returning to their team and that they wisely decided to not force him to stay with the team against his wishes.
"They also have DeRozan who will run the half court far more than Lonzo if I had to guess. Lonzo, LaVine, and Vooch can all be more dangerous off ball off DeRozan."
"In short, the reality of the offseason is much better than the perception, but the perception is also pretty bad and it will take the Pelicans being able to take advantage of the considerable flexibility they've afforded themselves to change the minds of many.  After making good moves by recognizing the mistakes of last offseason, overhauling the coaching staff, and clearing the decks with the Memphis trade, they took a shot at the top veteran point guards on the market, made big offers to Lowry and then Paul, and they were turned down. Then they went after guys like THJ and Powell to add more shooting and a solid veteran starter to the lineup and they both chose to stay with their current teams. After doing so, they seem to be set on operating as an above the cap team, which is why they‚Äôve been bringing in guys by sign and trade. Thus it is highly unlikely the book has been written on the Pelicans offseason, but if you stopped the story right now the first few chapters might give you cause for concern.  But, I'm fairly confident they will add several more players with the flexibility that their moves has afforded them, and when the totality of moves are made, things will look far better even if the general consensus of fans has been crystallized by  what has happened solely in the past few days.¬†  That is the gist, but if curious, what follows if much more detailed:  I can understand the disappointment and frustration of many Pelicans fans, and skepticism of fans around the league. I also get the criticism in the media, both the valid and hyperbolic, especially when the media (particularly the hot take variety) has a bias towards larger markets, a desire to see young superstars on ‚Äúname‚Äù teams, as well as the with Pelicans/Hornets past failures to build winners around CP3/AD, and given the mistakes of last offseason and what it cost to undo them this year. It also does not help that their primary target was also the top (reasonably gettable) guy on the market this year, fans got their hopes up, and when they took a big swing for the home run and missed, then followed that up with not matching Lonzo, and then Pels fans only see backups from Chicago and Charlotte coming in and are critical or worried. And If this were the sum total of the Pelicans offseason, I would probably agree with them, especially if there were no more moves made (there will be several). But as it stands now they are in position to be a better performing team this year than last, and have much improved finances/books, hold no bad contracts, and have a ton of flexibility to fill several more spots for this years team.¬†  On Lonzo, they seem to have decided (correctly imo) that he was not worth the price Chicago paid, though even if it were marginally lower they probably don‚Äôt match and force Ball to stay. I completely understand the reasoning of why many would disagree and say just match, and I think it was a closer call than the front office did, but ultimately at that number and given Lonzo‚Äôs preference to leave (along with the terrible experience of forcing Eric Gordon to stay and underperform years ago) I agree with letting him go. They felt that Lonzo was not the answer at point, and that he‚Äôs really more of a 3/D guard and that they could find either a star level veteran floor leader, or a cheaper option that could actually run the half court, drive the ball, and wasn‚Äôt afraid to draw fouls. They struck out on the veteran, but were able to acquire Graham on a good deal. There was not a big return on the Lonzo trade because the pelicans were not going to match, Lonzo wanted out, and Chicago had other things cooking with the other players who may have been potentially included, and they were not going give up a first for the right to sign and trade for Ball like they did DeRozan (they also included that FRP to dump Aminu‚Äôs contract). Would I have preferred a better return for Lonzo, yes, but I don‚Äôt think we were getting a 1st or White, and would have liked Young over Sato, but that‚Äôs only marginally better.  Ultimately the value of return in a sign and trade is not equal to the player, but to the relative willingness for the team with RFA rights to match the number. The Pelicans had less desire to match, thus the lower return. This same logic is also why I think giving up the 1st to Charlotte was a slight overpay for Graham, as they have Ball and Rozier, just drafted Bouknight, so were probably less intent to match to prevent the logjam, but given the low number on Graham they may have matched without the 1st, and of course there is also the added value for the Pels of staying in position to operate over the cap.¬†  We also need to keep in mind that with all the space the Pelicans created, including trade exceptions from disparity of incoming/outgoing contracts, and how they have chosen to operate in the transactions they have made, it is clear that there are several more moves coming, likely also by trade, via MLE/BAE, et al. So any grade on this offseason far is very much incomplete. There are probably at least 2, possibly 3 players who will be in the Pels' rotation this fall that are not currently on the roster.¬†  At this point we should take a look at that new roster, because most of the Pelicans' moves have been made via trade, and involve many players, picks, and coaches I think it is important to consider all of what is coming in, going out, and where they currently are situated.¬†  Outgoing: Coach SVG, Eric Bledsoe/Steven Adams and their bad contracts, Lonzo Ball, Pelicans‚Äô Lottery protected 2022 1st, Top 10 protected Lakers 22‚Äô 1st, Ziare Williams  Incoming: Willie Green, Mike D‚ÄôAntoni, Jonas Valanciunas, Devonte Graham, Trey Murphy, Tomas Satoransky, Garrett Temple, 2 second round picks, (Re-signed Didi Louzada)  Unused/TBD: Open cap space, Trade exception, Josh Hart Bird Rights, non-tax MLE, BAE  &amp;#x200B;  Even if there were no further moves (there will be) and they just kept/matched Josh Hart, you can argue that they will be a better team with this roster and coaching staff. I would say the roster is slightly less talented as of now with Lonzo out, but it‚Äôs not just Graham replacing Lonzo, it will be what the sign and trade for Graham and not overpaying Lonzo gives you, which is the ability to operate as an over the cap team, preserve and utilize exceptions, and extra space with which to operate, along with Hart‚Äôs rights and possibly Sato as a small piece/contract to deal. If they are unable to take advantage of this flexibility, or the open space they have, I would fully agree that this offseason has been if not a failure, but a disappointment and a big missed opportunity. But I fully expect them to take advantage of said flexibility.¬†  By operating as an over the cap team, they can bring in a decent sized salary (20-25M) in a trade from a team looking to avoid the tax, save money, or retool their roster. Obvious examples, but of course not limited these guys are Ingles or Bojan from the Jazz, Barnes or Buddy from the Kings. Then of course you can take on salary in conjunction with assets to recoup some of what you sent out, like maybe Washington pays to dump Bertans and you add more shooting to the rotation as well. These are just a few examples that have been thrown out by those that follow the Pelicans closely, but this type player is what I would expect to add.¬†  You also still have space, as well as the MLE and BAE to add guys still on the market that could either start or provide decent depth along the lines of Reggie Jackson, Paul Millsap, Lauri Markkanen, Kelly Oubre, Schroder, Avery Bradley, etc.  They may also choose to keep Josh Hart, or do a sign and trade with him somewhere for another rotation guy or asset.¬†  Then of all the players they acquired, Satoransky could be on the move, as he‚Äôs expendable, has some value, is a nice sized number to work into a trade, and keeping him might block the minutes/development of the young guards they like on the roster (who SVG puzzlingly backburnered in favor of an uninterested and underperforming Bledsoe last year). I like Satoransky as depth, but I can see him being moved for something as well.  So, as we can see, there is likely a good bit more to come, so the grade is incomplete. But if they don‚Äôt do anything else, or they don‚Äôt have a plan of how to utilize their flexibility I would say that they deserve much of the criticism they‚Äôve received, even if this year‚Äôs team outperforms last year‚Äôs.¬†"
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he‚Äôs traded for some defensive bigs because we‚Äôre in a bad position if we don‚Äôt get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
"&gt;well yeah but we're talking about THIS season. i think it's pretty likely that they'll seed higher than us but i wouldn't say they'll definitively be better than us. then again i'm optimistic and biased as fuck.  If Embiid is healthy, they're definitely better. He's an MVP level game changer that elevates that team to what they are. That and having Tobi, good role players, and a nice bench will keep them better. Who knows what happens with Simmons  And it always felt like the Heat were just a playmaker away. They play great defense, have a small ball killer in Bam, have lethal shooting, and Jimmy Buckets. To me, Chicago had a lot of holes that needed to be filled and I'm not sure Lonzo is going to be an instant fix to needing a playmaker especially since NO fans always say he struggles to run a half court offense.  If Trae keeps it up, I can honestly see the Hawks being only behind the Nets and Bucks next year in the east. He's legit."
"Lamelo ball, lonzo ball, doesnt matter to me just give me someone who will put in more effort than this sorry squad"
"Sure. I mean, the thing about defense is our defense was bad with or without Lonzo. He gets lost on screens a lot because he's not the best on ball defender. He's a good help defender but when the rest of the team is bad defensively that has no impact.  Our defense is going to live and die by Ingram and Zion stepping up on defense, not whether Lonzo is still on the team. As we've seen with many, many teams, your point guard's defense isn't that important. Your bigs and wings? That's the kicker. JV is a fine defender if not an elite shotblocker or anything, but Ingram and Zion need to be better at reading offensive attacks for anything to matter.  Nickeil Alexander Walker is going to be our better guard defender coming up this year and he's pretty solid on defense, anyhow. Made a big jump from this past year on the defensive end and offensive end so there shouldn't be a big drop of there.  Graham has the length and speed to defend other point guards but beyond that he'd be hopeless.  So yeah, it comes down to Zion and Ingram."
"The context is defined by Lonzo's lack of offensive ability, though. Like, the context is my entire point. I fucking wish Lonzo was more versatile a shooter. Would've fucking helped last year.  I'm talking about the bail out shots. Lonzo was never the guy hucking bail out shots. Admittedly some of that is Ingram's fault for dribbling the ball too long on an iso after the first play broke down, but still."
"Chicago Bulls a threat. To fucking who lol?   Lonzo ball, demar derozan, and light skin lavine are beating who exactly?"
"Alright and the hornets still took him. So whose fault is that? The Lakers and hornets made that trade cause the lakers didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be available at 24th (where they got Derek fisher). Charlotte got Vlade Divac from the trade as well, so it‚Äôs not like Kobe was given away for free. Lonzo ball did the exact same thing and the lakers took him at 2. Refusing to work out with other teams is uncommon, but it‚Äôs not out of the ordinary."
"Lonzo is not that great a defender, at least not last season, and our defense will live and die by Zion and Ingram learning to play defense. One guy play good off ball defense and medium on ball defense against guards, and being forced to get overmatched against wings, is not a defensive fallout for us."
"It‚Äôs only been three days of free agency  That being said- losing lonzo was not ideal, but at the end of the day, he wanted to walk and we weren‚Äôt going to pay him that much. We got someone who is statically similar to lonzo for very very cheap. This leaves a lot of cap open to sign some good role players (josh hart, hernangomez, some other veteran forward). It also leaves a possibility to build from a trade.   The front office believes they already have their core. Zion, BI, NAW, Hayes is their young superstar core. By siginging more and more vets to ‚Äúwin now‚Äù, you‚Äôre forcing out and taking minutes away from the players who are going to help us continue to win.   They offloaded bled and adams and got a great Center, they signed a guy they think can really contribute in graham. They got a respectable vet and a scrappy 3 in the s/t with ball. They had a great draft and got two guys they think can contribute. They signed 3 really great coaches to the staff- so to say they‚Äôre doing nothing isn‚Äôt true.   They also did offer Lowry, CP3 and Hardaway, but they went elsewhere.   The off-season isn‚Äôt over, nor is the Pelicans 21-22 team building phase."
"Graham is a better facilitator in the half court absolutely.  BI and Zion are great with the ball, but Zion makes most of his damage without the ball.  This is something the team needs that Lonzo was not good at no matter how much people say he‚Äôs a good passer.    Graham is a better catch and shooter than Lonzo.  A huge benefit to a team with BI and Zion‚Äôs gravity.    Graham is also a much better shot creator which is what you need with BI and Zion.  BI and Zion are great shot creators as well, but having a 3rd option (and now 4th because NAW is going to fucking kill)  when the offense slows down is also something they didn‚Äôt have with Lonzo and it showed.    Lonzo was a great off ball defender and in transition.  Hell obvious be missed but I think Graham is a better fit overall and is way cheaper"
And Bulls probably don‚Äôt want Lonzo having the ball a lot when the have Lavine and Derozan.  The want someone who can hit 3s at a reliable rate and play decent defense.
"Completely disagree with this take, and I'll bet New Orleans is much better next year.  Kyle Lowry is 35. Zion is 21. What is Lowry going to do for the Zion Williamson Pelicans? Help them make the playoffs, one time? Does that really help the team retain him?  Look, Lonzo is good, I love the way he *approaches* the game. His defense will be missed, as will his ability to push the ball. The reality is that he has had leg injuries for a few straight years - concerning. He can shoot the spot-up three, but he still has very little ability to score off the bounce.  Devonte' Graham is a far better offensive player than Lonzo. Not even close. Great fit with Zion and Brandon Ingram. Shot 84% from the line on 3 attempts per game last year. Lonzo goes to the line once per game, and had a huge improvement to hit 78% of them. But he doesn't take the ball to the basket cause he doesn't want to be fouled, and this is not the case with Graham. A guard who can and is willing to score at the rim will create offensive rebounding opportunities for Zion. And that, in turn, will create great opportunities for Brandon Ingram. The avalanche effect that replacing Ball with Graham will be tremendous.  They traded away a 1st, Bledsoe and Adams for Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, who just averaged 17/12 for the Grizzlies. Adams is older, slower, mostly just a screen setter and defensive rebounder now. JV can do those things, PLUS he is a legit post player AND can space the floor a little bit.  Eric Bledsoe is no longer a winning player. Getting rid of him is addition by subtraction.  Satoransky is a well-rounded NBA rotation player, as is Garrett Temple. They will help the team when they are on the floor.  The Pelicans have a bright future."
How many Lonzo games have you watched? Because over the last 2 years I‚Äôve watched over 100. His on ball and P&amp;R defense is awful and his passing is only good in transition. In the half court he‚Äôs awful and like I said a glorified wing shooter
"Reminds me that the Lakers are as shitty as any other Team in drafting.  2015 #2 D'angelo Russell  2016 #2 Brandon Ingram  2017 #2 Lonzo Ball  Couldnt form a young competitive team around three successive #2 Picks.  Lebron bailed them out, so they got another timeline."
"Nothing says elite basketball like Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozen and Lonzo Ball. Nobody in Chicago has even cared about the Bulls since Nate Robinson was option 1 in a playoff series against the Heat."
"&gt; If Zion is as good as they say, a very good PG should get him to the playoffs. I feel like you‚Äôre using that term loosely.  I feel like you're using the term PG loosely. Lonzo is not a very good *point guard*. He's a very good 3 &amp; D guard, which should fit nicely along 3 ball dominant all-stars.  &gt; But he‚Äôs undersized for that position  He's 6'6 with a 6'9 wingspan, that's plenty big enough to guard all 3 backcourt positions.  &gt; I don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôll develop a game that lets him get to the basket and get teammates involved. His handles are too weak, his step back is a non-factor and he shys away from contact.  All of that is true, and yet that isn't, and shouldn't be, his role. He won't be our primary playmaker, he'll be the guy who pushes the ball in transition, attacks defenses before they get set, and in the static half court he'll play off-ball and move it on as a secondary playmaker. Nobody is going to ask him to run a set offense. He's going to be the 4th most important player in the offense.  And on top of it all, he's just 23, and he's improved every single year he's been in the league. 2 years ago he was conisdered a bust with a broken shot who couldn't even hit his free throws. Last season he shot 38% on 8 3PA, and 78% at the line. If you're writing him off as a finished product after just 4 seasons then that's on you."
"But Lonzo is good at all 3 of those: defense, shooting, playing off-ball  Every player has strengths and weaknesses; the goal is to balance them out as a team. The main thing we‚Äôre missing is a rim-defender, but I think Vucevic will be serviceable enough that that area won‚Äôt completely kill us"
MVP: Luka Doncic  ROTY: Cade Cunningham   6MOTY: Derrick Rose  DPOY: Nikola Jokic  MIP: Lonzo Ball  COTY: Steve Nash
"I agree that people expect way too much out of Zion, but aside from maybe lonzo our team has only gotten better, lonzo is a bit of a toss up on his real value and anyone that says otherwise has not watched any pels ball and is just regurgitating media recency bias as usual."
"LaMelo Ball, Liangelo Ball, Lonzo Ball."
There was no argument as to who is driving to the rim for NO. However the Pelicans are a wash out of the playoffs most likely even with an aging and weaker Western conference. They expect one star to carry them to the promise land with mediocre help most of the time. Ingram is a good player and I thought the Lakers were better off keeping him and giving up Kuzma back when that was all going on but that's old news now. Outside of that what other key players do they have around anymore?   I digress though back to what my comment was originally a out. Lonzo will likely be fine and do what the Bulls need him to do. We need the passing and the defense most. Few have as nice of a bounce pass as Lonzo and I look forward to seeing it in person when I go to the games this year. I'm not a Ball fan boy or anything. As a matter of fact I criticized Lonzo a lot when he was on the Lakers. His shot was ugly and his passing and defense could be sloppy. He has improved a lot and I can only hope he gets better.
On his amount of attempts it   Lonzo ball this season was top 10 in 3 pointers attempted out of guys that actually played most of the season and this was with a very slow start where he was struggling with knee issues  From Feburary to the end of the season he was shooting 40% from 3 on nearly 9 attempts per game
"&gt; Lonzo isn‚Äôt a primary ball handler  I never said he was but that's what we needed and yes, that's what he was brought for (to fill the hole, not to fulfill such role fully). His 3&amp;d skills are complementary for us but we needed playmaking badly. I'm aware that he isn't the truest PG but the options were few and it's better than another season of forcing that role onto Coby. He will certainly not be the primary ball handler but he will definitely run plays and P&amp;R/Ps. You don't pay 20 mil/year for a complementary piece. And his shooting doesn't warrant being an offguard for the most part. He's solid but not great."
"&gt; Lonzo has never been the primary ball handler on a team  I never said he was but that's what we needed and yes, that's what he was brought for (to fill the hole, not to fulfill such role fully). His 3&amp;d skills are complementary for us but we needed playmaking badly. I'm aware that he isn't the truest PG but the options were few and it's better than another season of forcing that role onto Coby. He will certainly not be *the* primary ball handler but he will definitely run plays and P&amp;R/Ps. You don't pay 20 mil/year for a complementary piece. And his shooting doesn't warrant being an offguard for the most part. He's solid but not great.  DeRozan will provide assists no doubt but he has more of a ""what the defense gives you"" kind of playmaking where you need multiple defenders drawn to you to pass it. That won't be as easy with the Bulls as he's no longer the only star on his team (less double teams) which in turn could make him more of a pure iso-scorer again. At least that's how I see it.   I'm not saying it will fail but you can't deny the red flags (especially on defense)."
"Im not a big lavar fan, i think the way he publically speaks on his sons careers isnt great, but you cant deny he instilled some good work ethic and attitude in the ball brothers. Lonzo was hyped, wasnt living up to they hype, so he worked hard to GitGud. Lamelo was doubted coming into the draft, but he exceeded expectations and looks like he will be able to really impact games. Curious to see what comes of liangelo"
"Yep and then Pels traded him to the lakers and got Ingram, Lonzo Ball, hart and picks.  Not to mention AD was going to enter UFA, he held all the cards. Lonzo ball was in a totally different situation - Your FO just fucked up."
"Yep. The Pels traded him to the lakers and got Ingram, Lonzo Ball, hart and picks."
"lol believe me I want to!  I'd *love* for him to prove me wrong.  It's not like Bulls have 0 plus defenders.  Lonzo is excellent off the ball, Caruso is pretty good on &amp; off, Patrick Williams has room to grow into one of the best defenders in the Association, and Zach LaVine is slightly above average on D nowadays."
"Lonzo is not an elite defender, I‚Äôm sorry. He‚Äôs at best slightly above average but if a team thinks they‚Äôre paying $21M per year for this game-changing ball stopper, they‚Äôre gonna be disappointed.   I‚Äôm mad we lost him and basically got pennies on the dollar back, but Lonzo is crazy overrated on here. It‚Äôs ridiculous."
"Not sure if this exactly qualifies, but when people say that the reason LiAngelo Ball went undrafted and is currently not in the NBA, is because of the China Shoplifting incident. People fail to realize that he was always projected to go undrafted even before the incident and he was only taken at UCLA because of Lonzo and Lamelo. Basically Lavar saying, ""if you want Lonzo and Lamelo, y'all need to take LiAngelo too""."
"Typical media bullshit, Graham is a better fit than Lonzo and significantly better in the half court, he is also a better on ball defender than Lonzo despite the narrative."
Lonzo doesn‚Äôt have the ball handling or threat of scoring to be a high level playmaker. I agree he‚Äôs in a really good situation now and I think he‚Äôll do really well in CHI. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad player. But you downplay Demars playmaking too much.
"He is a great playmaker when it comes.to transition and pushing the pace. He creates plays from those situations, not many players can, which was an issue for the Bulls too. Adding him to a roster with Vooch and DeRozan who are great half court playmakers will cover all the holes, he also fits well because he plays great off ball.  Lonzo seems to be in a great situation rn as far as fit."
"Lonzo is so overrated, terrible on ball defender but because he gets steals and blocks people think he‚Äôs a good defender"
"Free throw shooting just isn‚Äôt a strength. Until he can get past the mental block he has about driving to the lane it‚Äôs a non factor in his game.   Lonzo is a good, if streaky shooter. He is a good playmaker in transition but very weak in the half court. His defense is decent but not anywhere close to as good as reddit claims.   If his name was something other than Lonzo Ball, he‚Äôd have been a mid-tier FA and would have gotten offers in the 17-18 range"
"Thats a different fit when both lonzo/lavine are better shooters than russ/pg, and both being able to play off ball. Demar needs the ball but he‚Äôs surrounded by players that don‚Äôt need it while offering amazing spacing.  He has also shown huge improvements in playmaking with a surrounding cast that was far worst in talent/space.   You have 4 good passers in the starting line up.   That is completely different from Melo when he was a black hole on offense, Russ with his poor shot selection and PG who is a streaky/rhythm shooter and not exactly a catch and shoot threat/floor spacer."
I personally like the move to get Lonzo but I think Lonzo has been a bit overrated this off-season. He can shoot and pass but he's not a particularly good ball handler and his job in the half-court is relegated to spot up shooting because his layup package is pretty pedestrian.
"Just stop...  Chemistry matters when you're trying to fit a bunch of random stars together like derozan, lavine and lonzo ball and figuring out who's going to be the main ballhandler, main playmaker, who's taking the most shots  but if you're the Lakers and signing a bunch of bench pieces and shooters like Nunn, Ellington, Monk, Bazemore, Melo fit doesn't matter, just space the floor, stand in the corner and hit your shots because we Lebron/AD are going to handle the rest.."

Lonzo Ball 57% FG within 5 ft on 123 attempts this year.    Devonte Graham 42% within 5 ft on 59 attempts this year.    No idea why you even tried to argue that Graham is better than Lonzo at finishing it's just not true

I don't like this signing from the knicks perspective. They should look / should have looked for younger players who can play defense like lonzo ball.
"Thaddeus can only play so many minutes. When he's not on the court, we lose his defense  Now we are set so that we can have 1 solid defensive wing on the floor at all times.  Backup centers? You mean Theis? He's the only backup center worth talking about that we lost.  Essentially, your entire argument is that DeRozan is so bad defensively that it outweighs gaining 2 good wing defenders.  2020-2021 Season  DeRozan Defensive Win Shares (DWS): 1.5 | Defensive Rating: 115  Alex Caruso DWS: 2.1 | Defensive Rating: 106  Lonzo Ball DWS: 1.7 | Defensive Rating: 113  vs  Thaddeus Young DWS: 2.2 | Defensive Rating: 110  Daniel Theis DWS: 0.7 | Defensive Rating: 111  I'm not seeing it"
"It shows the effort they give. Tiny Devonte' Graham, playing off the ball, still drove the ball much more than Lonzo Ball, who led his team in touches.  Graham also shot better on catch-and-shoot threes, which is Ball's only offensive skill."
SVG made lonzo play away from his strengths. Put him in the corner and let him spot up threes? He‚Äôs a transition pg and could have developed his off ball movement and slashing since his ft % improved to a respectable number.
&gt; Lonzo best attribute is his perimeter defense  This is just not true lol. He‚Äôs great playing help defense and jumping into passing and driving lanes but he‚Äôs about average as on ball defender. Not entirely his fault but he definitely takes some of the blame for almost every opposing guard absolutely roasting the Pelicans last season. Dude can‚Äôt fight over a screen to save his life
We already play point Zion. Lonzo was ass in the half court that we had to have Z be the ball handler.
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
"Not overpaying Lonzo, who underperformed on both sides of the ball, to open up minutes for NAW was definitely the right move.  Don't know much about Graham but I like what I've read and there's almost no way he'll be as abysmal as Bledsoe was.  Also weird Lowe didn't mention our two biggest wins this off season, replacing SVG with Willie and bringing in JV for Adams."
"&gt;We also got a sign and trade for him. We also got a better replacement in Graham who can play the pick, can guard point guards well.  Tell me you didn‚Äôt watch the Hornets without telling me you didn‚Äôt watch the Hornets lol.   I love Graham, but he profiles as a backup pg at best. His finishing inside the arc is worse than Lonzo and he goes thru extremely cold stretches where he can‚Äôt make a 3 off the broadside of a barn (last year he shot something like 20% on 3 for the first two months of the season, it was agonizing to watch). He is also a net negative defender seeing as how he is a 5‚Äô11‚Äù point guard with short arms.   His pnr game is def a major upgrade over Lonzo tho and he will distribute the ball and get guys involved, but you are seriously blowing smoke up your ass about the rest of his game.  And I know this is wildly unpopular for whatever reason, but Lonzo was a RFA; his desire to stay was really immaterial to keeping him, and from what it seemed he didn‚Äôt want to stay bc the Pelicans did not want him. He loved playing with Zion and BI and from what I saw/read, he never deviated from wanting to play and grow with those guys. Players want to feel wanted. Can‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt wanna be there without adding the context of the organization spurning him for an entire year and the fanbase blaming all the problems of last year‚Äôs team on him too."
"Graham (generously listed at 6'1"") gets to the free-throw line almost three times as often as Lonzo Ball (6'6"" and solidly built).  Something to think about as you watch Lonzo Ball do abolutely nothing on offense but jack threes ‚Äì¬†which he won't make nearly as often, because the Bulls don't have Zion cratering the defense into the paint, and giving everyone else wide-open looks."
"You guys stopped being optimistic about him because griffin tried trading him, that‚Äôs the only reason whenever griffin wants to do something you all talk yourselves into it so you don‚Äôt feel upset when it happens. I‚Äôve seen it happen for two years now so don‚Äôt waste your time denying it. Just got done reading a comment saying Lonzo is good off ball and not on ball lol. His weakness is getting around screens, everything else is good to great defensively especially for a guard. You know what would help his defense, having a Center that he can funnel people into like he did back in LA where both him and BI looked much better on defense, instead he had stone feet Adams who couldn‚Äôt play help defense if his life was on the line.   You‚Äôre right though, only time will actually tell if graham &gt; Lonzo + first rounder."
These people who only see Lonzo Ball's highlights have no idea that replacing Ball with nothing is a big win for the Pelicans. Addition by subtraction. There is literally nothing Ball does on a court that Nickeil Alexander-Walker doesn't do better.  Adding Devonte' Graham is just icing on the cake.
"Lonzo Ball is turrible, he can't do anything on offense except jack wide-open threes (from space created by Zion), and he's a mistake machine on defense.  You don't have to take my word for it, just look at the Pelicans' results the last two years. It would have been crazy for the Pels to lock in a core that never came close to .500."
Disagree.  Lonzo would be overpaid to simply give the ball up to Zion and B.I.  Plus with Trey Murphy coming in as a big guard why not get rid Lonzo now and get a shooter back to compliment this bigger team?       Pels have only been to the Playoffs 3 times in the last 10 years.  What do you have to lose?
"Every all-in-one metric in the public domain ‚Äì¬†including EPM, Raptor, WS, and WS/48 ‚Äì¬†all of them say that Devonte' Graham is better than Lonzo Ball.  Except one. The one exception is Real Plus-Minus, which rates Lonzo Ball as the 10th-best player in the league last year ‚Äì¬†and Devonte' Graham as 15th-best.  However, RPM also rates Lonzo Ball above Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, etc. So maybe take that one with a grain of salt."
Lonzo Ball is not worth 84 million fucking dollars!!!!
Ball isn‚Äôt a point guard. He didn‚Äôt play point for the Pels last season. Graham is a massive upgrade over Eric Bledsoe. JV is an upgrade over Adams.   The Pels viewed Lonzo as a kinda wing. He‚Äôs a off-ball guy. I think they are right in thinking this. If you wanna talk about replacing ball I think Nickeil Alexander-Walker is more the replacement in mind for the team.
"Lonzo doesn't need the ball in his hands. He played more off ball for the pels anyway. He's more of a 3 and D player right now with transitional playmaking ability. Plus if he doesn't improve his handle you don't want the ball in his hands in the halfcourt anyway. If he does improve his handle however, the bulls got a second star next to Lavine."
"Lonzo is not a primary ball handler, have you been watching games?"
Lonzo Ball
"Ridiculous post.  LaMelo obviously has the adoration of his teammates and seems to celebrate their success.  Lonzo also had no gripes about moving off the ball this season after being the point guard since he came into the league.  Gripe all you want about Lavar, but his kids seem to be good people and teammates."
"Top 5 best chances, in order (imo):    1. Lonzo Ball 2. RJ Barrett 3. Jaren Jackson Jr. 4. Patrick Williams 5. Collin Sexton"
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Cade has good handles and is a very good creator, Lonzo might be the worst ball handling starting point guard in the league and cannot create for himself at all other than step backs and straight line drives"
"First of all, LeBron went to the Lakers to play with Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram. There was an assumption but no guarantee that they would be able to find him co-star(s).  Second of all, this sub has shat all over Westbrook for not being a winning player since the year he won NBA. He hasn't posted a TS over 50% since 2017. Before the Lakers completed the trade for him the majority opinion was that they'd be better off with Buddy Hield. Now he's on the Lakers on a horrendous contract and that supposedly makes them a superteam. lol  We can talk about Cleveland too if you want."
"It was assuming you consider Schroeder as a starting caliber guard. Which he was for the entire season barring the playoffs.  The rate for starting caliber guards is around 20m, see what Robinson, FVV, Brogdon, Norman Powell, all make.   Bench players however cap out around 15m or so, Jordan Clarkson money.   I agree you dodged a bullet, but that is more due to the locker room issues that Schroeder seems to have brought to the Lakers this season. The reason he didn't get that money from other teams is that this offseason there were a TON of guards on the market who were clearly better than Schroeder, at a similar price point. Guys like Derozan, Norman Powell, Lonzo Ball, Conley, Dinwiddie, GTJ. Teams spent money on those guys and that left little to no money for Schroeder from the teams that needed guards, while the teams that didn't need guards didn't go after him anyways as their money was better spent elsewhere."
Bulls deserve to get every pick from them taken away and for them to Lonzo Ball because the Bulls will forever suck and that franchise deserves to rot  As for Lowry nah I dont think anything should happen to the Heat or Raptors
"I think best case scenario he becomes Lonzo Ball, they seem to draw comparisons (good defenders, playmakers who can also rebound) who similarly had troubles scoring his first couple of seasons, it wasn't really until the season just gone that he started developing a consistent shot. Hopefully Killian can get it together, I think he is a 3-4 season project."
Imagine thinking Lonzo Ball is the last straw for the long term future of Zion.
"This was and still is a problem for Lonzo Ball. Sure Cade has better shooting and can run pick and roll, but if you are the main ball handler you HAVE to draw fouls. You have to be able to turn something out of nothing."
"It wasn't just those two, there were a bunch of point guards who were available ahead of him: Lowry, Lonzo, Dinwiddie, and even Reggie Jackson and Cameron Payne if they'd been willing to move. Schroder tried to play hard ball in a market that was already going to be saturated with players at his position even before Westbrook and Kemba were in play."

Lonzo and Lamelo Ball
"Agreed about them being more dissimilar than the other three... but I think their fit/value on the Mavs was an interesting comparison, especially since both were FA's this offseason.  Neither are primary ball handler and would play off Luka, but the difference in what each provide is interesting since, THJ is more individual offensive while Lonzo is more defense and all around play."
"I wouldn‚Äôt describe Lonzo as a primary ball handler either. He‚Äôs at best the third ball handler after Zion and Ingram and is probably more valuable off ball then on ball, except in transition."
"THJ and Lonzo is a bizarre comparison. I would disagree they play similar roles - certainly not in the way Harris and Robinson play similar roles.   THJ is never a primary ball handler, but might score 40 in a crucial playoff game and keep your season alive. Lonzo is going to contribute more consistently in more areas of the game, including facilitating offense and off ball team defense. If we could merge them it‚Äôd be an All-NBA player."
"I feel like a reasonable compromise amendment to the rules would be to allow teams to communicate with agents but not directly with the players before the FA deadline. That way, you can start working out some of the contract details and such, but avoid more aggressive forms of tampering like wining and dining players.    If the Bulls want to communicate to Lonzo Ball that they think he's worth 4 years, $85M ahead of the deadline, that just seems like efficient business to me. Now if they take him out to dinner and start selling him on why Chicago's a better org, that feel much more slimy to me."
"He literally was according to ESPN and Woj who initially reported the deal.  &gt;[The Chicago Bulls and point guard Lonzo Ball have agreed on a four-year, $85 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade agreement with the New Orleans Pelicans, Ball's agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski on Monday.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31944286/chicago-bulls-land-lonzo-ball-sign-trade-agreement-worth-four-years-85-million)"
These GMs should all be fired if they don‚Äôt realize the reality is that Lowry and Ball had months to reflect on their free agency and came to a decision during the time between the end of the season and the start of free agency.   Lowry always wanted to play with Butler.  Lavar always wanted his kids in big markets. Chicago always made the most sense for Lonzo because Chicago fans direct their anger at management / coaches and generally not the players.
"Their FO *was* so bad. This is an objectively wrong statement since they now have in trades and Free Agency gotten Lonzo Ball, Nikola Vucevic, &amp; Demar DeRozan plus others. People have clearly chosen to go there."
"hey listen when you have the opportunity to pay DeMar DeRozan, Lonzo Ball, and Vooch over $20 million each you gotta *LEAP* at that opportunity. When else will you have the opportunity to spend $75 million dollars a year on a center who can‚Äôt do anything other than shoot, a 3&amp;D wing with delusions of grandeur, and one of the biggest choke artists of the 2010s?"
Your team is gonna look real awkward when you‚Äôre stuck paying DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball $160 million after Zach LaVine asks out
For real this sub is flooded with Kuminga summer league highlights... feels like Lonzo Ball all over again
"Both. He‚Äôs worse at ball handling, playmaking and defence, but likely the best/ most consistent shooter. I think a lot of their high school basketball was freestyle, so Lamelo and Lonzo got a great feel of the game as the were playing PG so LiAngelo didn‚Äôt quite get the same experience. Then playing at Ucla and when Lamelo went back to high school/Aus this gave the other two real experiences of structured basketball that LiAngelo hasn‚Äôt ever had.   The fact he‚Äôs shorter and less athletic means he‚Äôs undersized to defend his position but not mobile enough to guard 1‚Äôs and 2s, so he‚Äôs got to rely to hussle and effort to probably only ever be a satisfactory defender."
Hear me out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Lonzo Ball.
then Draymond green and Lonzo ball are elite playmakers by your definition
"I mean he is far from a perfect player and seemed like he wanted a bigger market from day one since his family has a brand. I dont think its all just sour grapes, there are legitimate reasons why Pels fans didnt like him  Also having Zion/Ingram is a massive benefit if you want to compete long term but also are willing to take a smaller role. He definitely is gonna get a bigger role on the Bulls which is something the organization could never offer given we already have 2 main superstar potential talent guys who need the ball a lot. And I dont think thats even really an insult for us because any team would pick Zion/Ingram in a heartbeat over keeping Lonzo"
"Currently, it's Zach Lavine. His moveset is flashy but smooth, such visually aesthetic basketball.  I also root for Lonzo Ball, partly due to the influence of my friend group and our clowning of his old release. It's been great seeing his improvement over the years.  I hope Chicago can make some noise this year."
"Jason Kidd was Steve Nash without the jumpshot, but with much better defense.  He had a lot more in common with Gary Payton than with anyone today. Maybe near MVP Rondo is a good comp. Lonzo Ball, maybe.   But that's it."
Lonzo: 3+D Guard with great vision in the full court however lacks the ability to be a good finisher around the rim which hampers his ability in the half court.  LaMelo: Higher ceiling then Lonzo. Amazing court vision and aggression. Could be a high quality volume guy. Defense needs work but he has the physical tools to get there.  Gelo: He can shoot the ball. Needs to show other tools to actually get a team slot in the league.
"Lonzo is a damn good and be a player, he's obviously taken the time to improve his shooting, his free-throw shooting got exponentially better as well as well as the three pointers, he's a very good passer and a very good Defender     When LiAngelo is a good athlete but obviously just hasn't made it to the league yet, I don't think his dad should have pulled him out of UCLA , he just comes off as an needing as much help as he could get     I think lamelo has real star if not Superstar potential, he carries himself well and has a fun and exciting game to watch, I knew I liked him as soon as he stole the ball from embiid at the end of that game when the rest of his teammates were pretty much ready to pack it in so that tells me there's some strong intangibles as well to go with the good game     Shout out to Lavar"
"lonzo ball seems kind of underrated in my opinion by this sub, with the amount of playmaking first-option forwards and 2-guards in the game today a high-level 3 and D PG is becoming more and more valuable, and not many play that role better than lonzo"
I remember those Lonzo Ball hype videos before the draft.  6'5 Steph Curry with a 40 inch vertical
"Wow I was going to say the exact same thing, the Ball brothers get this the most...  I think lonzo is a bit under 6'5"", Lamelo a weak 6'6, maybe even shorter. But the amount of people that discussed his (incredible) passing with ""that vision at 6'8"". He's listed 6'6"" everywhere since he got into nba. But people are still talking about his inflated shoe height lol that he had in NBL.  I'm guessing if they get 6'7.5 *in shoes*, these other leagues will list it at 6'8"". But bball shoes are thick af, so it turns into sometimes 3 inches different (Kevin Love for example)."
"The most blatant ones i've seen recently that might have actually even been lies from hyped up fans and not the players themselves are the Ball brothers.. I've seen people call Lonzo 6'7"" and remember before Lamelo was drafted people saying ""yooo he's grown to 6'8""-6'9"" when in reality both of them are around 6'4""-6'5"", MAYBE close to 6'6"" on a good day lol"
"I'm aware of Tony Bradley from his stint in Philadelphia and I don't think he's moving the needle. I saw ayo dosunmu play and I like his game I don't think he's going to see a lot of minutes and now that they have Lonzo Ball it should open up Coby Whites game up he's a pretty good three level scorer and can give you points coming off the bench or in a small ball lineup which I think we're going to see a lot of.  And I think you missed the point about the bulls needing a inside shot blocking presence that Gafford would have given them.  Because they are not getting any of that from Troy brown while he may have a higher upside than Gafford but how does that help them when you have a log jam at perimeter wing players with Patrick Williams, and Zach lavine, DeMar DeRozan there only so many minutes and how many can they find for him 12 to 15 a game tops?"
"DDR is not redundant at all on our roster. We were last in the league in FTA and had basically no half court creation all year (Coby White is not a PG whatsoever, Sato is firmly a backup). DDR addresses both of those issues. Even Lonzo is more of a transition creator than a half court creator. I think people will be surprised to see how much DDR will be handling the ball in the half court"
"In reality though I don't think it's so much about the ball family being popular, but more about lonzo being overhyped, then lamelo being ""under"" hyped, so now people are like ""i gotta see for myself"" lol"
" So lonzo ball broke the record, then fultz broke it this year again. Woah."
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
"If I remember correctly, Lonzo Ball won summer league mvp and followed it up with a pretty bad rookie year."
"Lonzo's not that good with the ball in his hands, that's why he didn't have it. Also, the team is legitimately better than last season, and we still have flexibility to make more moves, which we wouldn't have if we signed Lonzo to a contract that's too big for him. I don't really care if Zion wanted Lonzo back, because keeping Lonzo would hinder the team. Winning cures all, and we're definitely gonna be winning more this season, so get out with this garbage organization shit. At least get some better reasoning to back it up."
Lonzo is officially a Chicago Ball!
Lonzo ‚ÄúHanzo‚Äù Ball
" &gt;If anything I feel bad for Lonzo. Dudes been like excommunicated by the Ball family fandom  If anything, he'll be the most successful of the three. I have faith in him.  The man fixed the wonkiest of wonky shots, he can do anything he desires."
"Because they‚Äôre a garbage organization plain and simple. Had AD for years never built around him. Zion specifically asked them to keep Lonzo who‚Äôs an unselfish pass first PG that Zion enjoyed playing with. They took the ball out of Lonzo‚Äôs hands, ignored Zion, got nothing in return but signed Satoransky &amp; Graham smh. This is how you lose your star player in the future and not learn from your mistakes. I guess a Poverty franchise is gonna poverty franchise."
"The Ball brothers are basically nba Kardashians. I‚Äôd rather ignore their existence the way I do the kardashians but unfortunately two of them are the nba so it‚Äôs hard to. Basketball really is some men‚Äôs way of watching drama while pretending it‚Äôs not drama because it‚Äôs supposedly more masculine. I‚Äôm actually ok with lonzo, seems like a humble dude who happens to be in a crazy family, I can relate to that. Melo actively sounds like he has brain tumours and not in a fun way and the only thing I know about the 3rd one is that he stole some glasses in authoritarian China, meaning he‚Äôs basically Einstein compared to some of his numbnut fans here on the sub."
Remember when last season when Lamelo breathing the air would get more views than a career game from Ant? It'll repeat again  If anything I feel bad for Lonzo. Dudes been like excommunicated by the Ball family fandom
"He was literally born and molded into a spot up shooter, and has played that way the entirety of his life. When he was a kid he would just wait for Lonzo or LaMelo to throw the ball at him."
"As someone who watched all Pels games and watched a good amount of Grizzlies games, JV is a huge upgrade over Adams. And there won‚Äôt be a drop off on defense, because Adams wasn‚Äôt good on defense last year. Plus JV is a very good mid range shooter, which will help spacing too.  Offensively very Graham will probably be a better fit for us than Lonzo was. Defensively, a backcourt of NAW and Graham will be at least equal to the defense of the Bledsoe Ball backcourt. Basically, our offense got better, and our defense will at least be the same. If Zion and Bi can play solid defense, we can be a solid playoff team."
"Lonzo may never be an all-star, but I feel you can plug him into any team and he'll be a good addition. He's going to get better this year and NOLA will regret letting him go. He doesn't demand the ball on offense and the improvement in his 3 and defensive ability makes him a perfect fit for any NBA team. Lonzo starts on all 30 teams in the NBA"
"Yes, the size of the market still matters.   When Lonzo was expected to be a high lottery pick, the top 3 teams where Philly, LA, and Boston. Lavar did his best to hype his son up as the number 1 pick. He‚Äôd still end up in a massive market in LA.  People underestimate what‚Äôs entailed with a large market. There are so many content creators, advertisers, and companies in the big markets that are happy to pay local NBA talent because of the convenience. Tourism is also huge in big markets.   And it‚Äôs no secret the media loves big markets too. The amount of time dedicated to talking about Lonzo Ball when he was in LA dwarfs how much talk about him there‚Äôs been since he was traded to NOLA. Even when the Lakers are bad, people still talk about them. This is fact.  Social media definitely isn‚Äôt something to overlook, but neither is the market size of a player. If it didn‚Äôt matter, then why would lebron leave Cleveland for LA? It‚Äôs the most clear cut example of someone that could thrive in a small market, but instead chose a big market because it‚Äôs a no brainer"
"Yeah.  Once Lonzo got that bag LaMelos form got a shit ton better.    I know gelo has less to fix in his game but it's just not what youd expect from a dude who's entire schtick is that he's an elite shooter.   It's not even that he's a bad shooter but there's basic things (how much he's jumping, how low he has to dip the ball AFTER getting it in his chest, and how narrow his feet are for example) that you would want to see that he just doesn't have."
Lonzo Ball wasn't Bulls filing the tampering complaint either.
"We didn't. Lonzo isn't worth the money he got for the Pelicans. He can't run an offense unless it's a fast break. Fred Vinson fixed his shot, but most of his makes were wide open. He can't guard the pick and roll, and isn't a great on ball defender. He's good at throwing lobs, shooting wide open threes, and playing passing lanes.  We needed shooting and a point guard that could run an offensive set. We got that in Graham for half the money Lonzo got."
"&gt; The fact that once his boys got to the NBA he pulled away from being in the headlines all the time  Dude wtf kind of bs revisionist history is this? Lavar was literally saying Lebron was washed up to try and save Lonzo from getting traded away by the Lakers in 2019.  He was quiet in 2020 because the last thing anyone cares about during a pandemic is wtf Lavar Ball thinks. Especially now that his kid was in New Orleans.  Now that Melo is in Charlotte too, all 3 of his kids are in small markets. It‚Äôs no wonder he‚Äôs less relevant now than ever."
I wish Lonzo signed in Charlotte so we could have had all 3 Ball brothers on the same team
"Dunc'd On gave the 6 teams that drafted between Lonzo Ball at 2 and DSJ at 9 no better than like, a D grade for their draft because they didn't take DSJ.  Nate Duncan was literally like ""he's basically a more athletic Westbrook or DRose with a jumper""."
"That's a really clean form with great fundamentals. His feet are set correctly, the shooting arch is good and he pulls the trigger really fast. I think his 3 ball has a great chance at becoming NBA ready on a high volume with elite splits because his foundation looks great tbh. Say what you want about Lavar but all of his children have very solid basketball foundation and a good understanding of the game. And unlike Lonzo LiAngelos shooting form looks textbook on top."
"If we‚Äôre talking bout half court, then I‚Äôd argue he‚Äôs a big upgrade over lonzo ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a pnr?‚Äù ball as well."
So u think Lonzo ball and Simmons would make a great duo in the half court setting? Lol
"&gt;The Lowry S&amp;T was finalized and approved by the league on Friday. All contracts have been signed. Presumably Lonzo's as well.  No. They haven't.  https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-chicago-bulls-lonzo-ball-trade-tampering-nba-20210808-ightojuymvdmtmu2lyzksjqrvu-story.html  ""The trade is yet to become official"""
"Neither is this one.  ""The trade is yet to become official""  [sauce](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-chicago-bulls-lonzo-ball-trade-tampering-nba-20210808-ightojuymvdmtmu2lyzksjqrvu-story.html)"
Lonzo Ball and Markelle Fultz will make an All-Star team one day
"Yeah? Lonzo won't handle the ball, Lavine and Derozan will."
"I think the JV trade was a robbery by David Griffin and Memphis didn‚Äôt get criticized enough for it   The Trey Murphy pick was a huge plus for the team  Lastly, Graham at 11 million is better than Ball at 22 million when he can give you almost the same production Lonzo would if not better"
"Well yes every team without essentially 2 all-stars is a lotto team in the west and the east it will be this year.   Lavine, Lonzo, Simmons, Covington/Crowder/Bridges, Turner (not really many floorspacing centres). That's a lineup with about 100 mil in cost. Leaving about 15-20 mil in good players off the bench then a couple of 5 mils, rookies and mins. I think that team. Would make the playoffs in the west.  Alternatively a small ball lineup which might work better. Lavine, Lonzo, Wiggins, Covington (you have to go him for his rim protection here), Simmons. Wiggins is a place holder here. Ideally you want someone at the 3 who can get their own bucket, defend and hit 3s. Wiggins fits that criteria. Obviously another star would be Jaylen Brown as a better fit."
The NBA:  AD to the Lakers? Sleep.  Lonzo Ball to Chicago? *REAL SHIT*
This is all part of the leagues plan to unite the ball brothers. They will void the signing and New Orleans will be forced to double sign and trade lonzo and devonte instead.
If he balled out 2nd half of the year and played well in the postseason 4/100 wouldn‚Äôt have been unreasonable.  The problem was the back half of his season was full of decisions that were questionable and then he just disappeared when the Lakers needed him the most.   Lowry got close to 30 and Lonzo Ball got a contract higher than his proposed extension.  If Dennis had put up 20/8 in the Phoenix series with everyone out he probably slots in somewhere between the two and Westbrook is still in Washington.
"Lmao guess I think people should go to jail for driving 61 in a 60 since I'm a ""rules age rules"" person and there's absolutely no ground for neuonce.  You are literally comparing defrauding the United States government to a sign and trade for lonzo ball üòÇ"
"It's very obvious that every, single signing that happens the second free agency opens up involves tampering, negotiating, and agreeing with the players before they were supposed to, but, for some reason, the Lonzo Ball and Kyle Lowry deals are the ones the NBA chooses to hammer down on."
Don‚Äôt force my boy lonzo to go back to that hell hole just let him ball man
"Would‚Äôve been a terrible move not selecting Trae or Randle if USA didn‚Äôt win so it‚Äôs easy to say in hindsight; regardless, there‚Äôs only one ball (and it‚Äôs not Lonzo)"
"Were you asleep when free agency began? There were like 30 moves announced the second free agency opened, not just fucking Lonzo Ball.  This is the dumbest shit ever."
What does that have to do with Lonzo Ball? You‚Äôre projecting lmao
can we just end this lol. Right now Marcus is more valuable than Lonzo Ball
Is it the Lonzo Ball and Devonte Graham Bulls-Pelicans-Hornets three team trade?
Get ready for the Lonzo back to UCLA form because of the ball change narrative
"Lowry and Lonzo signed immediately when free agency opened lol. There are no reports of Brad meeting with them because A. That would be tampering and B. They signed as soon as FA started. Doesn‚Äôt mean they weren‚Äôt after them.   As for Smart, I‚Äôll just point to his below average TS% percentage every year except 2018-19, when he was exactly league average. Or perhaps I can point to his OBPM, which has never even been a *positive* ranking. Meaning he has never once offensively been average in OBPM.   https://985thesportshub.com/2021/07/30/report-celtics-showing-interest-in-free-agent-lonzo-ball/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-rumors-celtics-have-interest-free-agent-spencer-dinwiddie%3famp  And here are your sources. Unless you‚Äôre calling Shams and Chris Mannix boldfaced liars, the Celtics were interested in point guards this off-season."
Anything negative about Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year‚Ä¶ Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year‚Ä¶ why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
"If people honestly think that the Bulls aren‚Äôt making the playoffs, then god damn I want what they‚Äôre smoking. Look, you have two offensive MACHINES in Lavine and Derozan, a great distributor (side note Derozan has also become an awesome distributor) and defender in Lonzo Ball, and the dude who fucking dragged the god dAMNED MAGIC to the playoffs the last 3 years. Also y‚Äôall can trade Lauri Markkanen for some legitimately good pieces. If two of four of the above pieces stay healthy, they‚Äôre making the playoffs it‚Äôs not even a fucking question. Even if two of four are injured I‚Äôm still taking the Bulls as at least the 8-seed. And anyone who has the Wiz minus Westbrook over the Bulls is a fucking idiot!"
Lonzo ball sucks
"He has ben simmons and lonzo syndrome now. Zero confidence in his ability to score, he's looking for a pass even when it makes more sense to just take the shot. The skills still there but his confidence in scoring is gone.  Its like when you're playing pick up and your first few shots don't fall so you start passing the ball and deferring to your teammates and even missing open looks. The mind is a powerful thing in basketball."
"Call me crazy, but I like Graham as their PG next to Zion and Ingram. Graham doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over and is solid as a catch-and-shoot guy. Plus, he‚Äôll cost about half as much as Lonzo for 75% of the production."
Yeah they should've just given Derozan and Lonzo ball like 80m combined jesus christ lmfaoo
It‚Äôs so weird because all I heard was how great of a big man vooch is and how he is one of the best big men in the league before being traded to the bulls. And this off season I hear how everyone coveted Lonzo ball and praise his defense and passing. And then many were saying demar derozen is incredibly underrated should‚Äôve been an all star last year and one of the best facilitators and passers in the league now.   But now all those players are on the bulls and people start to discredit the entire team. And think we will finish with the same if not worst seed then last year? I don‚Äôt get it this team improved much better at like 3 positions and the bench gets better with Caruso and now at this time markkanen and white who were both starters for us last year. Yes they‚Äôre not positive starters but they are now two of the best bench players in the league offensively. Not to be a delusional bulls fan but I would be shocked if we didn‚Äôt make it too and I would be shock if we weren‚Äôt at least the 5th seed even in a deep east.
Something something Lonzo Ball
"""The pelicans should have paid Lonzo Ball."""
"Yep, people are overrating the Bulls. If Lonzo Ball is the best defender in your starting lineup, that's a bad defense you're gonna have. Pacers are a veteran team that won't miss the playoffs with a top 3 coach."
"If in this offseason, we‚Äôd likely end up losing KP for nothing and still not even get a player like Kyle Lowry or Lonzo Ball. There‚Äôs not too many quality choices out on the market that met the needs of Dallas."
Lonzo was put in the corner as the emergency 3 and D guy while Bledsoe would get the ball in his hands on the wing for no reason. But at least Lonzo could shoot last year hopefully he can hit it from more spots than just the corner this year
"The Pelicans wanted Lowry for veteran leadership. How does Lonzo Ball help with that?  By the way, going from Ball to Nickeil Alexander-Walker is a massive upgrade for the Pels. And especially for Zion Williamson, who has a much higher on/off RTG with Alexander-Walker than with Ball."
"Lonzo Ball is on the Bulls, not the Hornets"
They played point bi last year and it looks like they are again this year. Lonzo really needs the ball in his hands and a place to develop his skills. The lakers and pelicans weren‚Äôt really good fits for him but Chicago looks promising.
"$20 mil per year is decent starter money in the nba. I think a team with lonzo in 3 years as the 4th best player could be one of the better teams in the league.   His playstyle seems to perfectly suit taking a backseat role.   He‚Äôs a really really good defender, and can hit 3s at a really nice rate. I really really don‚Äôt understand why he wasn‚Äôt a must keep player for the pels.   What am I missing? Why wouldn‚Äôt every team want him? He‚Äôs be an incredible shooting guard with a ball dominant pg, I feel like he fits on every team in the league.   Am I just an idiot? ü§£ I wouldn‚Äôt trade him for next to anything unless it included an all star return tbh."
"Lonzo was 3rd on the Pelicans in shot attempts last year with 13 and averaged under 15 points.  Zion and BI were the only other guys who shot for the Pels  He‚Äôs not going to be taking 13 shots a game in Chicago next year with Lavine, Derozan, Vooch, Colby White, and Williams who are all more efficient shooters than him.   Unless he dramatically improved his efficiency and ability to get to the line, he‚Äôs not scoring much.    My crystal ball sees a lot of ‚ÄúOMG The Bulls owe $85 million to Lonzo 11/6/6‚Äù threads next year   That‚Äôs not to say Lonzo sucks but yeah, Lonzo will score less in Chicago than he did in Nola. Bet."
"Devontae is not a good defender, that‚Äôs where the downgrade comes from on defense even if you play the other wings more.  He‚Äôs also not the best playmaker/pnr guy even with his assist numbers because he‚Äôs such a poor scorer inside the arc.   As bad as lonzo is at finishing he‚Äôs still significantly better than graham.  I like devontae and hes a really good shooter and can move the ball but he‚Äôs vanvleet without the defense.    Fine on Beal but dame would require Ingram.  If 2023/2024 was the plan theres little point in getting rid of dead contracts which will be done by that point.  Should be just trying to accumulate assets and hit in the draft like Memphis.  You still have a lot of assets but giving up a 1st for a short term guy doesn‚Äôt help those plans.   the guys you listed yes could demand a trade but so could zion by that point lol.  It‚Äôs pretty optimistic to think those guys are much more likely than zion to(yes I see your username lol).   Memphis has as many assets as you guys why can‚Äôt they trade for zion or Ingram lol.  Imo if the jv trade wasn‚Äôt for Lowry, then it was for hardaway which you guys also missed on and ended up having to settle for resigning hart(slight overpay imo).  It‚Äôs an outside perspective but pelicans were looking to make a playoff push with some win now moves this offseason and they missed on the big ones.   All they did was upgrade to jv and downgrade to devontae, just not looking like a playoff team in the West  At least from my perspective, no was looking to make a playoff push this year with their targets all being ‚Äúwin now‚Äù talent like Lowry and hardaway and all they got"
"The JV deal had nothing to do with Lowry.  It had to do with getting rid of dead weight and bad contracts.  Lowry was an option if it was going to be a short term deal.   Also Beal isn‚Äôt requiring anything close to Ingram.  He‚Äôs a UFA and Nola isn‚Äôt the only place that would be able to sign him into space. Washington has zero leverage if Beal wants to leave. I think it‚Äôs moot because all indications are that Beal is going to Boston for Horford, Richardson and maybe 1st or Pritchard/Nesmith.  Sign and trades don‚Äôt bring much.  Even prime Lebron only bright two 1sts  But the real targets are the 2023/2024 FAs of which there are a lot who could conceivably get disgruntled and be available.  KAT, Ja/JJ, SGA, Fox, Mitchell, maybe Jaylen.  There‚Äôs always one and there are not many teams that can put up the assets the Pels can.   Signing Lonzo would have been a purgatory sentence.  He‚Äôs simply not that good.  It would have locked in Lonzo, Zion, and BI as the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù long term and that team was a bottom 10 team.     Graham fits much better offensively than Lonzo and his ability to actually facilitate in the half court and run the pick and roll is going to be a massive upgrade over Lonzo offensively. JV can at least space the floor a tiny bit more than Adams and he‚Äôs generally better though not a star. But I doubt he‚Äôs a long term piece here and is just sign and trade salary match fodder next offseason  Losing Lonzo won‚Äôt help the defense but Lonzo wasn‚Äôt actually that good defensively.  He was a ball hawk and good off ball in lanes but not a good on ball defender.  But NAW, Sato, and Trey3 are going to be defensive upgrades over their wings last year so I don‚Äôt see losing Lonzo defensively as all that big of a deal"
Steven Adams was never the untradeable contract everyone made him out to be.  Lonzo Ball on 25M averaging 14/6/6 is a lot harder to trade imo unless you‚Äôre happy to throw first round draft picks around.
"Nah that‚Äôs a really bad way of thinking about it, there‚Äôs a real world where Lonzo Ball on 25M is one of the most untradeable contracts in the league"
Paying Lonzo Ball that much money is not the way to go if you‚Äôre trying to build a team good enough to keep a star that already wants to get the fuck outta there.
"I feel like the Pels had a decent off-season. They got rid of 2 terrible contracts, while upgrading one of those positions. They re-signed Josh Hart to a good deal.   The Lonzo Ball deal was bad, but replacing him with Devonte Graham isn't terrible. They also maintain a lot of future flexibility.   Idk, Pels messed up on Lowry, but the off-season as a whole wasn't bad imo and it's not like the gamble left them in a terrible position for the future."
"Lol it's funny because if you think about it they're majority white. Like Lonzo Ball. White mom. Dad who is NOT 100% black. Genetically, Lonzo is more white than he is black. This is the case with pretty much every ""mixed"" player unless one of their parents was 100% African."
I can top that. Shawn Marion. Lonzo ball in 2018.
"????   AD, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Draymond Green, THT, KCP, Gary Trent Jr, Tyrese Maxes, Darius Garland, and many more  They have other clients and most have been paid."
yup here you go  PG: Point Vucevic  SG: Zach LaVine  SF: Lonzo Ball  PF: PWill  C: Rudy Gobert  DeRozan 6th man
"He represents Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons to name a few other big contracts. Both make over 35m a year, while Lebron makes 42m. He also represents guys like Lonzo Ball and John Wall who have contracts above the league average. He's making 13m in commission off those 4 contracts over the next 5 years probably, by the end of Lebrons career he could have made close to 30m easily, especially considering he has so many young players under contract, if even one gets a max that's another big payday. All that mainly because of insider connections, and free exposure from having Lebron as a best friend/Premium client"
People thinking LeBron was getting GTJ and Lonzo Ball negotiating there deals is fucking hilarious lmao
They should bring on Lavar Ball. The episode they had with him when he declared Lonzo &gt; Steph was hilarious.
"Clean block, Lonzo ends up on his ass, Lakers ball. Block Trifecta"
The evidence that Lonzo Ball is better than Alex Caruso is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?????

Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
"Top 8 imo.. The biggest problems: Defense and sharing the ball. Defense: Vucevic: horrible defending.. Derozan: Absolutely no defending.. Lonzo: Individual defense is good even not elite but if team not defending well, he just concedes. Caruso: Good perimeter defender. Zach: not a good defender..  I expect them to be worst 5 or 10 defence in NBA tbh.  Sharing the ball: Zach LaVine wants to play with the ball, Lonzo too, Demar too.. Who will be the PG, who will handle the more more?  I believe Bulls just wasted all of their resources for bringing 5+ individually good players which will create a very bad and unharmonic team while playing together.. Also who pays Demar that much!?"
"I guess my push back from a ‚Äòbuy-in‚Äô perspective is that at the beginning of last year this was a team that had a younger starting 5 than the University of Wisconsin and aspirations to maybe be the 10th best team with zero career all-stars and now they have three all-stars and a relativity of hope. So in terms of inspired ball I get why Thad is such a floor leader but I think this team is far more excited and willing to push compared to yesteryear.  To me the main thing is simply that anyone who watched the Bulls last year knows how bad the on-ball, point of attack, pressuring of the ball handler was. Teams had such an easy job setting up half court sets and not feeling pressured and getting to set their own tone. Thad‚Äôs IQ and help defense made up for a lot of mistakes. I think the hope is that if they can actually pressure the ball at the point of attack with more than just a Garrett Temple, it‚Äôll make some of those help roles easier.   Perimeter pressure was soooo bad. Interior might have stayed the same or even taken a small step back. But like when people say some overrate Lonzo‚Äôs defense‚Äî I mean they probably do. But the starting 1 for the Bulls this time last year was Coby White. And the difference on defense between Lonzo and Coby is just massive."
"It feels like this:  https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/574/Screen_Shot_2017-11-06_at_12.41.31_PM.png  And im starting to see the stereotype of everyone on here starting watching when fucking Lonzo Ball was drafted or something.   also lol again at ""no one would possibly thing lebron could lead the league in assists once! unimaginable!"""
"Yes we will. In the 23-24 season, The Chicago Bulls will have a starting lineup of Zo-Zach-P Will-Zion-Jokic that will win multiple üèÜ‚Äòs. Remember that Jokic was drafted by Bulls EVP Arturas Karnisovas and Zion will obviously reunite with former teammate Lonzo Ball. Both 2023 free agents. It‚Äôs coming."
You have no idea what ur talking abt. Caruso had the #2 highest defensive rating in the nba last year. And lonzo ball has amazing defensive stats against great gaurds
The Myles Turner/Lonzo Ball special.
"Yeah cuz the 15 Celtics had who else on their roster? Rondo couldn't shoot but had the ball the whole game he's a solid point guard but 11.7 assists doesn't mean as much when you aren't scoring as well.  Even if he was better than Lonzo now, rondo off ball is useless, so Zo is a better fit for the team and would have been a better fit back then as well."
The Pelicans aren‚Äôt an inept franchise at all but if that‚Äôs what this stupid fuckin sub and other platforms want to run with after we let Lonzo fuckin Ball go then go ahead.  Also gotta laugh at Knicks fans calling other teams inept when they spent like 2 decades being absolute dogshit.
"No, that's still true. Lonzo is an average to below average on ball defender due to his inability to navigate ball screens, but he is a very good help defender when he's locked in.   People expecting him to be a great point of attack defender is similar to people expecting him to be a half court floor general on offense.  Due to preconceived notions of his play style people end up expecting his weaknesses to be his strengths while ignoring his actual strengths (spot up shooting, transition passing, quick touch passing in half court, and help defense)."
"Thank you for this point!!  This bad D criticism doesn‚Äôt hold water when you look at how we‚Äôve performed.  Zach isn‚Äôt a great defender but he‚Äôs not hopeless like he was when he was 19.  He does some things well.  We saw in the olympics that when he doesn‚Äôt have to do it all himself he can be very disruptive in passing lanes and makes plays on that side of the ball. I expect to see improvements from Patrick Williams as well.  He has potential to be a great defender.  Good instincts, smart kid, and good length.  Adding Lonzo and Caruso is a boon to the bulls guard depth and defense.  Tony Bradley‚Äôs not a bad back up big either.  I expect this team to be middle of the pack defensively and elite on offense."
"I believe our offense will carry to a higher seed. Lavine, Vucevic, DeMar, Coby + Lonzo and PWill being respectable to good 3pt shooters. I believe we have 4 guys that can get 25+ on any night. If Lauri stays and commits to being a bench guy then that‚Äôs even more firepower. Playoffs is one thing but I can see us blowing at a lot of teams away in the reg season.   As far as defense, DeRozan is not a good defender and there better options (but who‚Äôs actually obtainable?)‚Ä¶ But we were playing lineups consisting of Coby, Lavine, Valentine, Lauri etc and we were never ranked lower than 13th defensively. That isn‚Äôt terrific like the Knicks but we were never trash. We lost Thad yes but also upgraded with Zo and Caruso + probably make another 4/5 signing. So DeMar is replacing Lauri and Valentine, our defensive issues are being overstated. We‚Äôll just never be great on that side of the ball.   This past season showed that you never know what‚Äôll happen in the postseason. But you have to get there first. The new FO just put Chicago in position to compete. That‚Äôs it"
"Maybe this has changed during his tenure with the Pels (didn't get too many chances to watch televised Pels games), but when he was with the Lakers he was never a a lockdown defender at the point of attack and he had trouble at times getting caught on screens.  Don't get me wrong, Lonzo was a plus defender, but it came more from his ability to get into passing lanes, play help defense, and generally understanding how to fit within the scheme while still finding ways to freelance (i.e. he was plus defender due to knowledge and feel for the game moreso than being a lockdown, on-the-ball defender ala prime Tony Allen). While he has the height and length the guard wings, I don't think banking on Lonzo to be a stopper bodes well for the Bulls."
Have you ever watched lonzo ball? Or are you just referring to Lavine and derozan?
"Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, and Rudy Gobert come to mind."
"Because they‚Äôre joining Lavine and Vucevic? Ball family stans do not count (they watched Gelo in the SL and saw an NBA player lol) Lonzo gets overrated by his stans which causes ppl to shit on him and act like he‚Äôs a bum. Reality is he‚Äôs a good starting PG rn and a much better fit next to Lavine than Coby White.   People pretty much only shit on DeRozan lately. He makes team worse defensively, he can‚Äôt shoot 3s, he‚Äôs a playoff choker, on and on. Reality is he addresses our playmaking struggles and our 3rd scoring option went from White/Lauri to DeRozan. That‚Äôs huge. That‚Äôs now 3 all star level players along with a stronger bench. That‚Äôs a playoff team 100%.   It‚Äôs funny that like 60% of comments are the Bulls won‚Äôt be that good, 20% are ‚Äúwhy is everyone overrating them?‚Äù, and the other 20% is saying we‚Äôre a 5-8 seed 2nd round ceiling. Shit is dumb"
I agree with this sentiment I‚Äôve got them as my 7 seed out the East. Don‚Äôt quite see them as being better than Boston or Atlanta quite yet. I also have concerns with Demars fit at the 3 since he‚Äôs a non-shooter from 3 and he‚Äôs never been much of an off ball threat. Still think they‚Äôll be very fun to watch tho and Lonzo and Lavines ability to play off ball will help them a ton.
1. Ben Simmons  2. Kyle Lowry  3. Jamal Murray  4. Mike Conley  5. Fred VanVleet  6. Colin Sexton  7. Malcolm Brogdon  8. LaMelo Ball  9. D'Angelo Russell  10. Lonzo Ball
"Tony **Parker**, Tim **Duncan**, Lonzo and his brothers **Ball**, Jeff **Green**, **Ray** Allen, **Dr J** and **Doc Rivers** (I know the real names but it should count) **Moses** Malone,"
Kawhi Leonard - He's a Kawaii  Hassan Whiteside - He's a White Side  Derick Favors - He is a Favor  Lonzo Ball/Lamelo/Liangelo - They are balls  Buddy Hield - He's a Healer  Kendrick Nunn - He's a Nun  Malik Monk - He's a Monk  Harold Miner - He's a Miner  Dragan Bender - He can Bend a Dragon  Devonte Graham - He's a Graham  Dion Waiters - He's a Waiter
1. Jamal Murray (assuming health) 2. Ben Simmons 3. Mike Conley 4. Kyle Lowry 5. LaMelo Ball (Hot take?: Will be #2 end of the season) 6. Malcolm Brogdon 7. Fred VanVleet 8. Collin Sexton 9. Lonzo Ball 10. D'Angelo Russell  I think its pretty cool that D'Angelo Russell is like the 20th best point guard in the league. We're really stacked at that position and should be for a long time since we seemingly get 1-2 franchise point guards in the draft each year.
1. Kyle Lowry 2. Jamal Murray (assuming he's healthy and up to what he was doing last season) 3. Malcolm Brogdon 4. Fred VanVleet 5. Mike Conley 6. Colin Sexton 7. LaMelo Ball 8. D'Angelo Russell 9. Lonzo Ball 10. Bum Simmons
&gt; Yeah scoring the ball is not everything lmao  It's just the most important skill in today's game  &gt;The only thing Sexton is better than Lonzo at is shot creation.  That's a pretty big only thing. How good is a PG who can't operate in the halfcourt? Spoiler alert: Not very good
"Yeah scoring the ball is not everything lmao, there is a reason his teammates don‚Äôt like playing with him. Lonzo is a better passer and defender and almost the same 3 pt shooter with his new shot. The only thing Sexton is better than Lonzo at is shot creation."
"Hard to call demar a more complete player than Lonzo when Lonzo is a true two-way player, and has the spot-up skills to play a strong off-ball game on offense.   Demar is probably just better suited to scoring in the half-court, operating in half-court PnR‚Äôs, etc. Though I‚Äôm just *always* going to get nervous about his shot selection, even if he‚Äôs proven time and again he can be efficient taking the shots that he does. He‚Äôs getting older, and those tough post-ups and long two‚Äôs *do* require a significant degree of separation im worried he may not be able to get if he loses even a half-step of speed and athleticism. By next year, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he makes more sense as a 6th man who runs the bench offense FEASTS on opponent reserves."
"This thread is mental. Ben Simmons not doing shit to work on his game is still an all-star and DPOY candidate, he is clearly better than Lonzo Ball."
"Ok let's start this fun little debate then  Trae vs Zo - Okay maybe a tiny sample size, (literally one game) but Trae dropped 30 and 12 on Lonzo in their matchup during last season. I know it's a one game sample, but come on in reality the Bulls vs Hawks matchup is gonna be only 4 games per season anyways, one game vs four games is a big difference to compare two said players, but we have no choice. Also to think that you said that Zo creates better for his teammates. Are you being forreal right now? Just not in that train at all. Ain't really that geek on stats but Lonzo is like a one dimensional game by game player. What I mean by that is he is inconsistent in shooting the three. Month by month during last season: 29 percent - Jan 34 percent - Feb 46 percent - March 35 - April 34 - May And then next month surprised me a lot by how inconsistent he actually is He never really shoots the threes Trae does, yet it's just inconsistent as hell, especially with the gravity Zion and Ingram gives the Pelicans, all his threes should be like 70 percent open One game - 1-9 Next game - 7-13 Next game - 4-13 And then 4-11 And then just takes 2 three point attempts next game in his 34 minutes of playing time?!!?!?!? Like bruh, you act like Lonzo is an actual sharpshooter, in reality it was only for one month. Lonzo wins on defense, only an idiotic Hawks fan would argue there too be honest, although his height and wingspan help him a ton, i would still give him it but here's the thing. You act like basketball is a one on one sport, which could be (iso), but it's still 5 v 5, Trae ain't iso-ing everytime he faces against Lonzo ball. Capela is a hard hitting screener, Vucevic is weaker compared to Capela to say the least. Collins is a hard hitting screener, well PWill is a dawg as well I guess. But Hunter is imho a good screener actually, Derozan is getting older and older so his athleticism and speed will likely decline in the long run this season, but Trae got some big guys. Off the bench they are weaker going to Gallo, Gorgui, and K'von, but they are irrelevant to this tbh.  Besides if Trae doesn't score, as I said prior, it's a team game. So??? yeah Trae - Scoring Imho percentages are not the whole thing so Three point shooting - draw Lonzo - Defense Lonzo - Defense IQ Trae - Offensive IQ - give the slight edge to trae, usually ball's assists are just pick and roll passes to zion, or like a three from ingram, i wanna see him actually be a free point guard, to actually be the one setting the actual play Trae - playmaking (sorry lonzo) Trae - leadership Trae - clutch Trae - intangibles So Trae &gt; Lonzo I'm gonna keep this short for the next players now  Bogi vs Lavine It's not a question too be honest Bogi's three point shooting has gone another level this season shooting 44 percent, should be atleast 45-46 too be honest, but he played terrible with El Pee's game plan. His shots are easier I guess, but he's been hitting some step backs Really rarely see him playmake Might be a better defender than Zach So overall, I'm gonna give it to Lavine easily without a doubt  Hunter vs Derozan Hunter better defender by a mile too be honest, haven't watched Prime Derozan too be honest during his Raptor days, only times I've watched him is through the playoffs. Oh and by the way, his main flaw is choking in the playoffs plus couldn't get pass LBJ. Derozan's regular season runs are overrated as he just cannot survive in the playoffs His mid range shot is top 4 in the league behind paul ,kd, and kawhi, in no order. Hunter is a better three point shooter by a mile, at least he takes the three pointer unlike Derozan. Well maybe he'd change because of a different system but highly doubt it too be honest. But just because of veteran presence I'd give it Derozan, but maybe along the mid-season they could be equal tbh, and I could see Hunter pass Derozan during the next off-season  Collins vs PWill - Collins would eat PWill in the post, Collins rarely spots up from three now since we have reliable shooters in our squad, at least our 3rd best shooter ain't vince carter no more. PWill is a good perimeter defender, in fact an underrated one as well, should be in dpoy convos imho. But he ain't gonna win in the post vs collins down low, he has a sweet jab melo mid-range type game as well, and is really athletic, might see a poster as well, and you really think vucevic gonna bother a collins layup/dunk, highly doubt it. gonna give it to john the baptist  Capela vs Vucevic - Capela for defense by a mile so let's get that out of the way, Vucevic to offense by a mile as well, Capela a better rebounder, plus here's the thing for Capela as well, Vooch once had a 4-20 game i think against the bucks earlier, yes no lavine i know i think, but Capela's game is never inconsistent, since Vooch relies on offense he might have some stinker of games. Plus not that much playoff experience.  I'd actually give it to Capela.   1. Trae &gt; Lonzo  2. Zach &gt; Bogy  3. Derozan &gt; Hunter  4. Collins &gt; Williams  5. Capela &gt; Vooch  Now on to the bench  As of right now Lou Will is declining but gimme a combined LouWill and Delon Wright for Caruso. If one's not showing up then the other will be there. Besides wright and caruso is literally the same side of a coin, similar games, one's just older, and has more veteran presence. Gimme my point guard Shooting guards are k'von to coby white - i'd say it's a draw, just depends on who has an off-night, well actually coby gets more off nights but then again his scoring load will be lower now. gimme reddish over troy brown or djj, whoever the hell your sf's are gimme gallo over who the hell your pf is i'd even take gorgui dieng over tony bradley, moreover okongwu Easily deeper, solomon hill would probably play your backup pf minutes lol, hill easily gonna be a great veteran for us or play for injuries heck i didn't even mention our rookies lol. Plus if you wanna talk about shortening the rotation, that's just cowardness if you wanna compare teams. you'd shorten the rotation, that just proves my point that we're deeper lol  Besides as a hawks fan, i've watched trae play all the time but you cannot contain him imho. the only way to stop him is himself, a: shooting dumb threes b: overthinking and throwing interceptions c: his floater just not going in and it's not really because of the defender, but maybe that's just a homer take lol. And if you wanna talk  about scorers and willing passers - says the guy with having derrick jones jr as a backup 4 and tony bradley as  a backup 5 lol, easily you guys are gonna get fatigued  Scoring wise - by depth we win, i mean we had 11 players scoring double digits per game last season lol altho by true skill we cannot know that yet till the regular season lol Defense - Ball, Caruso, plus an injured PWill over hunter, Reddish, Capela, and even Delon, sheesh, gimme us lol Bulls are an inconsistent team, i could see them as the 5th seed or the 9th seed. So yeah, this is the paper  Edit: formatting"
imagine the assorted ball family glee when Lonzo wins the title over the Lakers this year
"I think Graham will certainly be the primary initiator. Doesn‚Äôt mean primary scorer or anything, but he will certainly have his hands on the ball a ton in the half court. Lonzo can barely run a P&amp;R in comparison."
"Lonzo isn‚Äôt that good of an on-ball defender at all  He‚Äôs terrific off-ball, but he‚Äôs not some elite on-ball stopper by any means"
None of these people in this thread actually watch Lonzo Ball play basketball.
If there was fantasy basketball where I would have to pick my opponent's team. I would pick Lonzo Ball first every time.
I mean Westbrook may be the better player but let‚Äôs be honest Lakers could really need Lonzo rn over westbrook. Less ball dominant and less turnovers
100% Lonzo big ball
Lonzo actually works on his game and isn‚Äôt afraid to take a shot. He is a top 5 on ball defender for guards.  Simmons is top defender. Is afraid to take a shot.   I was high on Zo coming out of UCLA. Now that he has retooled the mechanics of his shot I‚Äôm still high on him. I‚Äôd take him over Simmons. Not knocking Simmons cause if he gets his shit together he could be really good. But mentally and with his shot he has a lot of work to do
Imagine talking shit about Lonzo Ball for no reason whatsoever
"Ben would definitely help the blazers defensively. Just not sure how he fits offensively with Nurk. Although that's the question for every team that trades for Simmons. ""How does he fit next to x player""? When they don't have the ball in their hands their would occupy a lot of the same space. Plus Dame is already really good at running the point. Hell even Nurk is above average for a C. Simmons would definitely add a lot of defensive value to the team with some much needed wing defense but that's really the only role he makes a big improvement in. If the Blazers trade CJ I think they would prefer a more 3&amp;D guy as opposed to someone who's a defensive specialist with playmaking abilities. basically guys like Lonzo and OG. Obviously those guys aren't available and those types don't exactly grow on trees so the Blazers might have to settle on Simmons if they want to move CJ and improve defensively."
"lonzo definitely disappointed early on, but when is the last time you heard about lavar ball? he gets no attention at all and it‚Äôs been that way for years now. lonzo has improved consistently since leaving LA and there‚Äôs no reason i can think of for the bullshit he gets"
Lonzo ball the most vanilla athlete on earth.
Lonzo ball when I read comments from bulls fans.
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo ball and Brandon ingram
"[According to Jalen Rose they did](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/03/10/jalen-rose-warriors-told-lamelo-ball-on-draft-night-they-were-taking-him/)  I mean they were probably scared he'd end up like Lonzo. I wonder who eventually veto'd it, Lacob, Kerr, or Bob?"
LonzoüëèmotherüëèfuckingüëèBallüëè.
It really depends on the other 4 guys on the floor with them. I think for most teams Lonzo is a better fit just because he‚Äôs comfortable spotting up for 3s and doesn‚Äôt require the ball as much as Murray.   But Murray is also a fantastic player.
Lonzo Ball - labeled as a really good defender. He‚Äôs solid with team and offball defense. He‚Äôs terrible navigating around screens and picks and overrated as an on ball defender.   Underrated I like the Jokic answer
this man about to ball out with Lonzo and Bledsoe gone
Another one I thought of:  Lonzo Ball  CJ McCollum   Andrew Wiggins   Tobias Harris  Joel Embiid
"Even at the time, the Fultz pick was garbage. Almost all other players in the lottery ended up being better than him, and even at the time people thought they were stupid for not taking Lonzo Ball (baggage notwithstanding). It seems like every time a GM tries to make an out of the box smartass pick (ahem, Anthony Bennett) it just goes to shit"
"I‚Äôm going full kool-aid here because fuck it I love Zach Lavine:   I think he finishes the season in everyone‚Äôs top 10 considerations and is in the mvp conversation.   Save this for an agedlikewine or agedlikemilk post, idc. I‚Äôm buying it.   I‚Äôve watched 75% of every bulls game for the past 7 years. Last year was almost 100%. Zach Lavine is a fucking problem. His speed and agility are still slept on (somehow). The dude can just effortlessly glide across the court when he wants. Hops out the gym, shoots with the best, attacks viciously.   His three big flaws last season: inconsistent defense, ball control and occasionally questionable late game decisions.   All three of which can be solved by one thing: better teammates that he can rely on. Not having to be primary ball handler with guys like Lonzo, Caruso and Demar all taking that mantle for him will reduce the frequency of turnovers and energy expenditure, which will lead to more focused defense, less focus drop offs when handling the ball, and less needing to force the issue late in the game. Not to mention, defenses can‚Äôt key in on him and run him around the court or force him into double teams."
It seems to me that's because we were without Williams/Jones (the team's 2 presumed rotation PFs) and Bradley (our backup big man) so rather than shuffle the stars out of position it's better to just have one guy step into an unfamilar role.  I'd rather see Green adapt to small ball 4 than move Lonzo there. Interesting though since DeRozan has played a bit of small ball 4 in the past for SA.

"And before Lonzo Ball hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman hugged him &amp; said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù"
Miss Caruso already. Going to watch some Bulls games to see Caruso and Lonzo ball.
Yo are they just gonna play small ball all the time? Is Lonzo gonna guard the 3? That team is gonna be fun to watch.
Zach had a 63% TS last year despite being forced into an ill fitting primary ball handler role because we had no playmakers. Imagine how efficient he's gonna be with Lonzo and Demar feeding him easy buckets.
Lonzo and Caruso pushing the ball for Zach is going to be must watch basketball. It‚Äôs literally non-stop hustle.
"Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; De'Andre Hunter  Jaxson Hayes &gt; De'Andre Hunter  So, yes.  In that deal Pels also got multiple second-round picks and major salary relief.  BTW, Nickeil Alexander-Walker &gt; Lonzo Ball"
"Lots of things to debunk here.  &gt; I‚Äôm fully for player empowerment. This whole situation exists because he feels disrespected, not because of anything on court.   Let's start with confirmed stuff, Klutch has reported that Ben doesn't like the fit with Embiid, lets face it, Embiid can fit with anyone with the way he plays. It's the other way around. Let's move on to being disrespected, sure he has the right to be, but he's not without fault and some would say most of it is on him. The team needed him to shoot or at least develop an offensive skillset that doesn't disappear in the playoffs. It's a job at the end of the day, as much as I applaud player empowerment, there should be a limit to it that we're not glorifying them to just do the minimum and get the maximum, it's a two-way deal.  &gt; Some are way more emotional than others (example = Lonzo) and play way differently depending on their confidence. Simmons is on this extreme spectrum.  No one forced him to sign the max with the team/city, he's been in Philly long enough he knows how critical we are, but honestly it's not exclusive to Philly. I guarantee this backlash happens regardless of what city or team you play. He drops the ball and disappears consistently in the playoffs he's getting some flak, and it's not exclusive to him, it happens to everyone. It's not like the fans are playing in the court, the GM already gave him so much pieces to cover up his shooting. When will it be enough? It's a you problem.  &gt; It‚Äôs not like every contracted player will walk- they have to be willing to give up salary and be willing to go anywhere else. He‚Äôs not forcing his way to a specific destination.   The uptick is already on the rise when Kawhi did it, yes it happened before but now we're seeing a trend (Harden) instead of anomalies like before. Of course not everyone will walk away, but those who want to will out of spite and vindication, we're already classified as a big market team, but how will this affect the small-market teams? And it's been overreported already that he wants to be specifically in the California area too."
The Ball bros had a massive following before Lonzo ever went to UCLA. Those Chino Hills teams had a ton of hype on YouTube and social media
This fails to realize LaMelo was already popular BEFORE going overseas because of Lonzo and LiAngelo?     Besides overseas ball ain't even the best alternative to college
"I didn‚Äôt say WE would be top 2 but yes our offense should jump to at least top 7 not just because we got Demar, Lonzo and Caruso but because they‚Äôre replacing Satoransky Coby White,Thaddeus Young as our primary ball handlers. You know it infuriating watching Coby White ‚Äúrun the offense‚Äù last year? Lonzo,Demar and Caruso are ridiculous upgrades over what we had last year. Zach had to try and create everything for us last year and he tried but it‚Äôs not his strong suit, having him play off ball will make him even more lethal offensively. Same with Vooch no point guard to actually utilize him so we were just running horrible pick and pops with him every possession."
"LaVine and Vuc aren't great defenders, but neither of them are bad at defense. DeMar is obviously not a good defender but let's not fail to mention that we have Lonzo Ball and Patrick Williams in the starting lineup and off the bench we have Caruso, Tony Bradley, Troy Brown Jr., DJJ, Stanley Johnson, etc. the entire bench was pretty much molded with athleticism and defense being the two highest priorities.   12th in the league defensively last year, 8th in the league after trading for Vuc, and despite losing thad i don't think that's enough for us to even be in the bottom half defensively this year and looking at our roster we clearly have guys who are capable of playing good defense."
Had that old Lonzo Ball form. Dude was an absolute bucket though
1. Zion   2. Cade Cunningham   3. Jalen Green (A lot of teams would of taken him #1 instead of Cade)   4. Ja Morant  ( Wasn't a great prospect was clearly ahead of Barrett though. It was a perceived weak draft class at the time which might have been correct.)   5. Anthony Edwards (At the time he wasn't unanimous)   6. Lamelo Ball (Dropped because of Lamar and Lonzo Ball nothing would of changed)
"Lonzo Ball. Onto his 3rd team in 5 seasons, this is a potential turning point to show he can be more than a role player. He's fully healthy, fixed his shot, and is playing the role he wants. Can he be an effective PG for a playoff team or not?"
"Yeah honestly you can throw a lot of the Bulls in that boat. Lonzo has to prove he is better as a primary ball handler and not a spot up shooter, Vooch will have to prove he can be an average defender for a full season, Zach will have to prove if he can be that guy on a winning team, even Caruso will have to prove he is legit without playing next to Lebron and Vogels defensive scheme.  Also a big year for Billy Donovan as I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever coached a top 10 offense and as you mentioned Demar. A lot to go out and prove this year for the Bulls but I‚Äôm excited to see how everyone on that team responds."
"The Process problem is you have to get 3 stars or 2 generational talents through the draft and that is really fucking hard. OKC and Golden State did it but both teams tried to trade a generational talent. At least with OKC he is acquiring a war chest of picks. I don't think that will workout the way people think since most teams now are built through drafting a generational talent building around him through trades or free agency and trades. If Presti is successful it is because he trades a lot of the war chest away.  &gt;2015) drafted Okafor at 3 who was a huge bust   Liked Okafor but as a GM if you're tanking you have to get 3 stars or two generational talents. Have to pick Porzingis then trade him.  &gt;2017) traded up to draft Fultz, who was a huge bust. Which is bad. But apparently they never had a chance at Tatum and Ball isn‚Äôt a game changer.   They could of traded and took anyone they wanted for the number 1 pick once they got it.  I thought Fultz was a bust when he came out. Never saw the ""elite athleticism"" Fultz possessed according to fans and journalists. The guy was slower than Lonzo, wasn't strong, no endurance (got tired shooting 3s in training)... where was the elite athleticism."
Yeah idk how anybody can say shit about ‚Äúnew forms‚Äù when Lonzo was in the same draft as Fultz and you wouldn‚Äôt even know that was him pulling up for a jumper anymore  People point to Fultz but forget he was shooting 3s w a medicine ball lmao. Hopefully Cade isn‚Äôt doing that
"Zion. Can't shoot, can't defend wings, ball dominant (didn't seem like Lonzo liked that considering he left), undersized for the center position even though that's probably where he'd be more effective, probably injury prone, and his bulldozing tactics didn't work against proven playoff defenders like AD and Draymond.  No one is trying to sacrifice their body in the regular season to take the punishment Zion gives out, but if he ever got to the playoffs it'd be a different story."

"**EDIT**: missed the ""next five years"" because I'm a fool, this lineup could potentially do it because the old guys should age well but you can definitely build better long-term lineups.   * PG, Lonzo Ball: high-volume and high-efficiency shooter who's a great playmaker and good defender. The perfect 3&amp;D roleplaying PG to have alongside superstars.  * SG, Steph Curry: the GOAT shooter, perennial MVP candidate, plays great with other stars because of how well he does off-ball. * SF, Kevin Durant: three-level scoring monster who can hit any shot on the floor and is usually the best player on the floor. Plays very well with Steph.  * PF, Marcus Morris: solid defender who has shot very well from three lately. Perfect off-ball player for a team that already has ball-dominant superstars.  * C, Rudy Gobert: all-time great defender, currently best in the league. With four high-volume and high-efficiency three point shooters around him, Gobert's offense isn't an issue- as the Jazz have shown last year. This is essentially the Jazz's current offense, only with better guys in the starting lineup."
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Myles Turner, Mikal Bridges, Lonzo Ball"
Lonzo Ball best player in the league
"Giannis and Jokic are the perfect front court duo honestly. They play off each other so well. However, they're both worth 5$ so im only left with 5$.   Looking at the list I have my bigs so I only need guards. I want a good scoring wing who can also defend so I settled on Edwards. He also has great potential to develop into an elite 2 way player  I only have 2$ now for my backcourt so Ill chose Lonzo Ball and Gary Trent Jr. Lonzo is an elite shooter and defender while Gary Trent even has some creating ability though I will mainly use him as a shooter. He's not the greatest defender but I have Lonzo and Edwards to cover for him  All this floor spacing should maximize Giannis and Edwards slashing ability and Jokic's playmaking will be deadly with these guys, especially since all of them are great off ball. KAT already plays a similar role in Minnesota with Edwards and Jokic is just an upgrade  So my team is  PG: Lonzo  SG: Gary Trent  SF: Anthony Edwards  PF: Giannis  C: Jokic"
"$5 - Luka - The player we build around. He's the  youngest out of everyone in the superstar tier and will only be hitting his prime in the next 2-3 years. Potentially has a higher ceiling than Giannis/Jokic while  the KD, LBJ and Steph should be on the downswing in the next couple years.  $5 - Giannis - The other player we build around. Amazing 2 way player. The 2-man game with Luka will basically be unstoppable.   $2 - Myles Turner - Good defensive center that can stretch the floor on offense.  $2 - Buddy Hield - Great 3pt shooter to space the floor.  $1 - Lonzo Ball - 3 and D guy that can also be a secondary playmaker."
"Lonzo Ball $1  Jayson Tatum $4  Giannis $5  Myles Turner $2  DeAndre Ayton $3  Everyone is a competent defender especially in the frontcourt. All of them are in their prime or entering it, 3pt shooting might be iffy but the spacing should be alright. Giannis would be running point and Lonzo would be a spot up shooter and making plays on the break like Mavs Jason Kidd."
"$5 KD $4 Booker, $3 Ayton $2 Mikal Bridges $1 Lonzo Ball.   I might be biased, but the youth, defense, scoring and passing in that team is insane. Passing is probably the weakest though, which is why I took Lonzo"
Lonzo Ball  Devin Booker  Mikal Bridges   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Deandre Ayton

Top 25 greatest players of the modern era: 1. Bugs Bunny | 2. Adam Sandler | 3. Scott Foster | 4. Lonzo Ball | 5. Chauncy Billups
The last two winners were Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram. They were both drafted and played for the Lakers.  That means there are two candidates that can potentially win next year. They are both on new teams with roles that are a better for for them and could be ready to take a leap.  Lonzo Ball - Chicago Bulls  Kyle Kuzma - Washington Wizards  Jokes aside I think they are very solid possibilities and have shown flashes of legitimate potential. I‚Äôm excited to see how they do.
"The comparison makes perfect sense.   Ben Simmons is the tallest point guard in the league and one of the best defenders and passers in the league.   Lonzo Ball is a tall point guard and a solid defender and passer. Not quite Ben Simmons level, but a budget Ben Simmons who can shot."
"The only reason Draymond works is because he plays with Steph, one of the most gifted offensive players of all time. Simmons is a good player but you need 4 other shooters on the floor and someone who can be your on ball PG for it to work. Trading Lonzo for Simmons means you have 1 high volume, above league average 3 point shooter on your entire roster AND you have to take Vucevic, who is a better player than Simmons, away from the hoop."
Lonzo isn't a great half court initiator but he still isn't Ben Simmons. I think Simmons is better in transition but Lonzo isn't far behind. I think with Chicago they're going to have Demar play more on ball and be more of the half court initiator. you absolutely need Lonzo in that case because he shoots the three pretty well and is an excellent secondary play maker.
"they were 12th in defensive rating, but it was a three way tie, so they were actually tied in 10th place technically.   I totally agree. People say the fit is bad because of Derozan. But they don't realize that this is actually the ideal roster for a player like Derozan. On the Bulls he is surrounded by really good three point shooters and two other elite offensive threats in Zach and Vooch.   I think the other reason people are skeptical is because they think Zach, Demar, and Lonzo are all ball dominant and won't be able to get as many touches as they need. This isn't really true though. Lavine is one of the most efficient scorers in the league which means he doesn't need a lot of touches to score a lot of points. And Lonzo is more of a facilitator than scorer, so his touches should be turning into points for his teammates. The only true ball dominant player is Derozan.   Also we see year after year super teams form with multiple ""ball dominant"" players and do just fine. Good players figure out how to play together."
Lonzo ball has 21 double doubles in the last 3 years (165 games) the fuck you talking about triple doubles for
"My biggest question mark is who's going to be the primary ballhandler? Zach Lavine is easily their best player, but we've seen how Lonzo is without the ball and Demar is also at his best when he has the ball in his hand. I'm not too worried about their shooting considering that Lonzo, Zach, and Vuc can all shoot 3s. Also gotta see improvements from coby and patrick. They are a playoff team there is no doubt about that, but imo you need a good coach to create a system that has all these ball handlers."
Lonzo is a good on ball defender against slower guards like Booker. Put him on guys like Fox and Lavine and he mega struggles
" &gt;Lonzo Ball triple double threat with excellent court vision, great defense, and 3 pt. % improvement every season of his career.        &gt;Admittedly I've watched some of these players much more than others   Yeah we know, stan"
"&gt; If Kawhi and PG handle the ball the majority of the time, that makes them lead ballhandlers, the clippers haven't had a ""proper point guard"" in the entire history of them being on the clippers and they have had one of the best offenses in the league each year    That‚Äôs fair but I think this has to do with scoring and supreme spacing. Clippers offense is so outlier because of that. Oh yeah the way I would define lead ball handler is a guy who makes 70% of the decisions on the team. LeBron, Luka, Trae, Russ, etc. Kawhi and PG split the duties and are both secondary playmakers. No team can actually run the offense through Kawhi or PG and both are used best if they can score within in their spots. They aren‚Äôt point guards is what I‚Äôm saying    Rondo was good in the PO because he could shoot. When he couldn‚Äôt shoot which was the entire regular season he was one of the worst players on the Lakers    Lonzo wasn‚Äôt the Pels primary, he was a spacing wing last year. Ingram and Zion had the ball much more than he did      Last part is fair and I will give him time obv I just think you should maximize your 1 pick first and foremost"
"If Kawhi and PG handle the ball the majority of the time, that makes them lead ballhandlers, the clippers haven't had a ""proper point guard"" in the entire history of them being on the clippers and they have had one of the best offenses in the league each year    Rondo was terrible until he wasn't and was the third or fourth best player on the Lakers? Lol that's a weird argument   Lonzo was literally the lead ballhandler the pels last year, I'm not even sure what your argument is, Lonzo had his best shooting year last year, that's why he got a bag from the bulls despite his injury history   Again, Killian has a short history in the league and his role isn't defined yet, he's still learning how to play in the US, can't expect him to be what you think he will at this point until he gets more games under him"
They should be atrocious defensively but I'm excited to see how they look probably more than almost any other team. Lonzo Ball is a good on ball defender but they'll still be really really bad defensively  Edit: I'm also a big Coby White fan but I feel like that's me just liking him more than thinking he will develop a ton
Lonzo Ball is also no longer a lead playmaker and acts more of a spot up shooter/connector.
"Pelicans fans so salty that the Bulls took Lonzo Ball of all people, you people are in every thread with this shit"
"He‚Äôs about to be a sophomore on a team that‚Äôs likely not making the playoffs. He‚Äôs got time to develop this season.  And he‚Äôs got a coach right now working to fix it. Just cause his shits broken doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be fixed.  We‚Äôve seen Lonzo Ball fix his over the years, no reason to think Hayes can‚Äôt do the same. Even then we got 3-4 other players who that can shoot giving him space to drive.  It can work."
"I don‚Äôt agree that Kawhi and PG are lead ball handlers. To me they are secondary playmakers that are both optimized playing with a proper point guard. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll often see people say the Clippers lack playmaking.   Rondo was also terrible for the Lakers, until he shot 40% from three in the PO.  Lonzo never actually ran offense for the Pels. He was more of a spacing wing because he and Killian have the same issue of having no scoring gravity despite clever passing. Killian can‚Äôt play like a spacing wing like Lonzo eventually became because hisnshooting is questionable    I agree with your last sentence"
"Kawhi and PG both run the clippers offense, they are the lead ball handlers lol  Knicks will have randle and kemba both running the offense, randle had most of the responsibility last year because rose was on the second unit and the firsr unit pg was garbage or a rookie   Lonzo runs the offense, especially on the fast break, the problem with the bulls last year was that Zach was handling the ball too much because the bulls didn't have a real pg, and he had his best season ever   Lakers had rondo and lebron and won a chip, they can make it work with Russ lol  Killian and Cade haven't proven to be anything in the nba yet, they're going to have to find their role in the league , the one who can't adjust will probably be on the second unit or gone"
"You can have two ball handlers on the court at the same time   Nets have kyrie and harden   Lakers have lebron and Russ  Clippers - PG and Kawhi   Knicks have randle and kemba   Bucks have Giannis and Jrue    Bulls have Lonzo, DeMar and Levine    The coach has to figure out the action to make it work"
Imagine losing a FRP for Lonzo Ball üò¨
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
"Father of Lonzo Ball. Also add in the words covid, vaccination, and status. Please."
Homer pick I think Marcus Smart can have a Lowry-like career arc.  This will be his first season as our primary ball handler and I think he‚Äôs going to surprise people.  Around the league I think Lonzo Ball is gonna be a guy that is a lot better in his late 20s than early 20s.
"I feel like Zach is going to be hella efficient with this new improved roster. He's got Caruzo and Lonzo to play more focused on D, he doesn't need to play hero ball anymore."
"overpaid Demar Derozan so he can pass up open 3 point shots for a contested midrange jumper, expected Lonzo Ball to be anything more than a 6th man type player, traded Thaddeus Young. Vuc and LaVine, while ‚Äúgood‚Äù by some measures, aren‚Äôt really anchor level stars that you can base a franchise around. So what the fuck are they doing? But I‚Äôm willing to wait and see. I just think the overall optimism surrounding this roster construction is a bit on the delusional side but I am sure people will run in with advanced stats to show why the individual players are good, but that would just be missing the point."
20-24 ppg / 8 rebounds is his floor without any on-ball improvement. That's easily a tradeable contract especially given the number of players who sign a 5-year rookie max extension and then want out to a contender. I could totally see us sending him away with picks in a Brandon Ingram/Lonzo type package for a star in the future. Unless he gets injured (and that's a big if) this is a pretty tradeable contract in the future.
"I mean those types of players exist i just dont think they are availble. Jrue would have been a great fit, players like Jimmy Butler and Jaylen Brown playing at the 2 are great pairs for about anyone, honestly Kyle Lowry or Lonzo Ball both moved this offseason and could have slotted in to help take some pressure off Dames ball handling responsibilities during the regular season."
Lonzo Ball looked so damn promising I swear.
I think lonzo ball is better than people believe.
"I can‚Äôt believe this has become controversial again but Bulls fans are going to be wildly disappointed when they watch the real life Lonzo Ball and not the imaginary version that people think he is  Lonzo is not a sharpshooting, playmaking elite defender. He is an oversized guard with possibly the worst handle and ability to finish at the rim at the position, let alone in traffic! He is completely useless when it comes to playmaking in the half court, and only provides good transition passing. His 3 point shooting is solid only when left completely wide open on catch and shoots, and the numbers plummet the moment he has to dribble or if there‚Äôs a hand in his face. His team defense is fine, but there‚Äôs no way in hell I want him defending the ball handler in the last minutes of the game  Like I know you people didn‚Äôt watch him on the Pelicans but still how did we end up here!!!"
De‚ÄôAaron Fox is not a starting pg on a mid-tier playoff team. He might get better individual stats than Lonzo Ball but will accomplish much less playoff success wise.
"Lonzo Ball is severely overrated. I think he‚Äôll just be above average throughout his career, no more than 4 All Star appearances"
"I'm not saying no team will take him, just that Sixers are trying to go off his value on paper but it's the playoffs eye test that makes their high asking price a reach. Simmons still has a place in the league, but his lack of killer instinct or offensive game makes him a good but not great player. TBH he should be getting Lonzo Ball money, but I guess that's hindsight for the Sixers"
dearoon fox will lead kings to playoffs this year  zion is a lazy guy who needs to play in a winning team to have impact  lonzo ball is the best ball player - lamelo sucks and is just flash
"That's a bit weird since defensive role's typically aren't decided by which position you guard. But I'm guessing you essentially mean defending point of attack, which means player who's primary job is to guard smaller ball handlers in pick and roll or isolation situations with limited off-ball help responsibilities.  There was 15 players last season with over 1000 mins played that were classified as point guard, but who's defensive role wasn't point of attack. This reduces to 13 if we remove Harden and Wright who were classified as both PG and SG.  Some notable players out of those 13 who wouldn't be included as point guards by the definition of needing to have that specific defensive role would be guys like Kyle Lowry, Lebron James, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Luka Doncic, Lamelo Ball, D'Angelo Russell, Lou Williams and Lonzo Ball.  Likewise there are many players who aren't classified as point guards, yet do have the kind of defensive role that you were talking about if I understood correctly.  16 players to be exact last season with 1000+ minutes played. If defensive role is what makes you a point guard then some notable people who might be in consideration would include Bradley Beal, Matisse Thybulle or Terry Rozier. Also I can't say I'm quite ready to be calling Gary Harris or Kent Bazemore as point guards either.   As a random fact some interesting names that weren't listed as point guard last season were guys like Sexton, Bledsoe, VanVleet and Dennis Schroder.  In my opinion it's just an odd thing to try to heavily use defensive match ups as guide to who plays which position since there isn't that heavy correlation. Plenty of what majority of people would consider top point guards will actively try to avoid defending opposing small point guards in ball screen situations."
"I‚Äôm optimistic about Kevin Porter Jr., Jaren Jackson Jr., Devin Vassell, Brandon Clarke, Justise Winslow, Dejounte Murray and Lonzo Ball.  Im pessimistic about Marvin Bagley III, James Wiseman and Bol Bol."
"We‚Äôre clearly going to stagger minutes, a full bench unit does not work for us. We‚Äôre probably going to pull him early, bring in Caruso and then eventually bring Demar back in with the bench who is pretty much all defensive players. He will be our primary ball handler in the half court but Zach will take most of the shots and Lonzo will lead in transition pretty simple."
"His game is exactly what you don't want in a third option, he has to have the ball to be effective, doesn't provide spacing  Although as LaVine and Lonzo are pretty good off the ball, it can work, but is it worth it taking the ball off their hands for DeRozan"
"I mean, yeah‚Ä¶.  The fourth and fifth men would be pretty much average starters.  Joe Ingles.  Duncan Robinson.  Lonzo Ball.  Seth Curry.  Clint Capela.  Mikal Bridges.  Evan Fournier.  Nance.  Gary Trent.  An average starter would be somebody who‚Äôs serviceable on the court, who won‚Äôt win you games singlehandedly but contribute to the overall team.  Do I need to continue?  You need to get off 2k and start actually watching basketball, because your take is braindead."
"He's a superstar in the making but that doesn't say much lol, he's competing with  Beasley, thabeet, Evan turner, Derrick Williams, MKG, Oladipo, Jabari Parker, DLO, Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Bagley, Wiseman, Jalen Green  On a serious note, 5 of those players are out of the league which is pretty absurd"
"I was at a festival the day Lonzo Ball got traded to the Pelicans. I was walking back to my campsite and struck up conversation with this dude wearing a Lakers Lonzo jersey cuz he was clearly a Lakers fan, dude was hella sad because he just got the jersey like 3 days before and then Lonzo gets traded for AD."
"Doesn't work when Lonzo is fine guarding him in the iso. That's literally how every possession went towards the end. Randle did well when the ball was moving, he found space to penetrate, and draw a double team in the paint. Lonzo wasn't letting him do that when the iso was being forced."
Foul on Lonzo. Like obvious foul off the ball.
Goddamn Lonzo got the clamps on Randle.  Randle needs to catch the ball deep and dribble once or twice at most.
Lonzo ball is the starting pg for the 2022 NBA champs
Lavine's good and all but this is DEMAR'S TEAM NOW! damn.   The way he would bring up the ball and be ready to either bully or just splash the sweet midrange was so good to watch. Lonzo and Caruso not as good attacking but the defense was good.
"This Bulls team is full of players who have something to prove and it shows on the court  Zach ""empty stats"" Lavine  Lonzo ""overrated"" Ball  DeMar ""got traded then the Raptors won a title"" DeRozan  Nikola ""who?"" Vucevic  Alex ""not worth 7M a year"" Caruso"
We can't let LaMelo win this. Think of all the sibling rivalry it would cause between he and Lonzo. Dubs trying to keep the Ball family together.
"You mean like how they flipped on:  ""Nance is a bum that can only dunk"" to ""Nance is a quality, versatile role player for the Cavs""  ""Clarkson is a chucker that can never meaningful contribute""(this continued with Lebron) to ""Clarkson is such a great 6th man, just a flamethrower""  ""Brandon Ingram is such a bust and one pick before Jaylen Brown. He's a stick, can't finish through contact, can't shoot, Travis Outlaw"" to ""Ingram is turning the corner and living up to that Durant lite comparison""  ""Lonzo Ball is GARBAGE. I can't believe Lavar got the Lakers to believe he was worth the 2nd round pick"" *proceeds to post literally every negative statline and bad highlight from his rookie season"" to ""Lonzo's defense is amazing and he transformed his shot, amazing""  This list can go on and on. Zubac was maybe one of the few that didn't get shit while on the Lakers."
"This is probably why guys like Lonzo or Caruso have such a high +/-, they might not be the best scorer but they play D and will get guys who are open the ball, gonna need a selfish guys to break that cycle. Now imagine if the Timberwolves got Balls instead of Russell lol."
"Ingram was called Travis outlaw 2.0, he was called one of the biggest bust ever in his rookie year because he was really inefficient. Lonzo ball was called a bust and an overrated defender, Randle was called a bust, Caruso was called a meme player and overrated on defense. The list goes on. Those players are now viewed in a favorable light"
Not nitpicking just curious lol. Even in the Rockets game he was more of a Lonzo ball type player. Yesterday he didn't even shoot a 2 until those lay ups. Hayes and Cade rn have similar games so that will be interesting to see. Hes 6'7 tho so it's different to guards. And guards can blow by Barnes if he gets too close not Cade. He won't be guarded by point guards. Probably small forwards like Lebron PG Kawhi Tatum.   Those are even better defenders then Barnes and have similar lenght. I'm sure if he tightens his handle more he should be fine but that's something I'll watch lol
Lonzo Ball was smart to get the hell out of there. Ingram is next.
"I want to know what you mean by great. Top 20? Top 30? Top 50? Top 100? Top 150?  Are we going to start calling every single solid starter a great player? Lonzo ball is great? bogdan/bojan bogdanovic are great? current gordon hayward is great?  Great has to be at least a fringe all star. You don't have to make the all star team but your name should be in the 5 or 6 ""snubs"". Like Lou williams that one year."
Ball was top-locking Steph; trying to pre-emptively deny the screen. Lonzo was expecting Steph to fight the screen. Both Steph and Klay are good at reading these kind of defenses and go for a backdoor cut if the defense gives it to them.
"Yep. Kuzma used to do this same kind of stuff regularly in LA, but just like this year he would often follow it up with a stinker or two. He's very talented, but he's inconsistent. It's just last year the highlights of his that got all the attention are when he'd throw a ball out of bounds and this year the highlights people are upvoting are ones like this.   It's just the difference between him being a Laker and not: as a Laker the preferred narrative was that he sucked, and now the preferred narrative is he's amazing and the Lakers were stupid to trade him. It's the same thing that happens with literally every young Laker after they go somewhere else (see also: Caruso, D'Lo, Randle, Ingram, Lonzo, Clarkson, Nance, Zubac, etc). Whatever evidence can be used to make the Lakers look bad will get lots of upvotes from all the Laker haters here."
I kinda miss those 50/50 lonzo posts. You never knew if it was going to be a swish or an air ball.
Lonzo Ball is a championship point guard. Lolz. Bulls fans are in for a rough surprise when Lonzo will be one of the reasons they don‚Äôt go far ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"When was the last time Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso guarded a top center well?"
Lonzo Ball is not an elite defender. He‚Äôs a really good off-ball defender but y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt have to suffer watching him for two seasons like we did.   And HIS STATS ARE A LIE.
Lonzo Ball &gt; Damian Lillard   As a rapper
Is Lonzo Ball a bust?
I‚Äôm sorry but why the hell is Lonzo Ball on this list
"I haven‚Äôt watched the Pistons at all this year. Last year watched Killian and thought his moves look really smooth, like he has some touch of a floater, shot mechanics look fine, he‚Äôs good at driving left, has a step back 3 in the bag with the way how it looks fluidly but overall his shots just not falling.  His best traits are defense and playmaking. So more or less if he can either improve some off the dribble play in PnR he can be somewhat like Ricky Rubio or if he improve his off ball spot up shooting he can be somewhat like Lonzo Ball.  His offensive movement and size and just overall package kinda looks like DLo at times but he‚Äôs obvi better athlete and defender than D‚ÄôLo, although his athleticism better than DLo doesn‚Äôt exactly make him a better slasher or finisher I don‚Äôt think. Just piss poor offense showcase so far. There still a route for him to become a starter in the league but he‚Äôs more likely be a secondary ball handler, connective tissue, filling the gap type of combo guard rather than an actual lead guard"
"Your teams gets in many passing lanes, Lonzo is a defensive stud.  Watching them force turnovers on the Warriors rather than watching the Warriors just dribble or pass the ball out of bounds was different.  Reminded me of the Rockets a few years ago.  Solid group the Bulls are."
Just double check he is a Lonzo Ball fan. There's a small chance he likes other players on those teams.
If you took out Steph Curry's outliers and adjusted the average closer to Lonzo Ball then they're basically similar players.
Bulls and Pelicans fan?  He likes Lonzo Ball. Get him a jersey from dhgate.com if you‚Äôre on a budget.
"Lonzo ball is not worth his current contract , this sub will continue to dickride him tho"
Lavar Ball in 2017: Lonzo is better than Steph Curry
Lonzo Ball
"I think that Lonzo is perfectly countered by someone like Steph. Lonzo usually is hyper aggressive to a fault on ball stopping defense, because he has extremely good recovery defense and relies on that just as much as he ball stopping defense.       I remember him purposely getting blown by just to swat people or pick their pocket, or trap the player. Before he was a great defender at the point of attack, he was an elite recovery defender.    Steph doesn't allow anyone to use recovery defense on him."
Lonzo ball opening a brick factory tonight
Any team with lonzo Ball is a shit team. You don‚Äôt have to worry.
I literally don‚Äôt care what you call Simmons. I don‚Äôt think of him as a guard defender.   Lonzo is mainly a spot up shooter on offense and pushes the ball. Not like he‚Äôs Luka and it takes so much energy away from defense.  And that‚Äôs your opinion if you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs top 5
Lonzo ball fraud watch
"Not really important but he didn‚Äôt play guard in college. Doesn‚Äôt even matter to the point I‚Äôm making  Lets not sit here and act like Lonzo does a lot on offense and even with the roles Caruso is obviously a better defender.   What does Lonzo do better on defense than Caruso. Caruso a way better iso and 1v1 defender. He‚Äôs better at tracking off ball, has better hands and is a better help defender. Lonzo good at some of that but Caruso is elite"
Also he basically or his partner basically stole money from Lonzo but his kids can play ball.
Lonzo ball IQ so incredible
"I think this is by design. Jesse Bus (1 of 6 Bus siblings) gravitated towards college ball and the scouting dept and decided that this would be his domain.    There was a time when it didn't look like any big name FAs were coming to join Kobe in his twilight years, so the narrative became the whole ""baby Lakers"" and we have a lot of developing talent in JC, D'Angelo, Julius, Nance. Then there was the one overlapping year with LeBron and Ingram, Kuz, Lonzo and LeBron goes down. Then the AD fiasco and trade happens and Lakers beat starts saying things like ""the Lakers tried the young core movement but now they're cashing in those chips and getting back to what has made them the franchise they are today--landing stars and bringing back Showtime"".   At this point, I think Jesse Bus and the scouting dept have an understanding that most of their picks won't remain on the roster for their first big contract (particularly with the Klutch Mafia having our FO by the balls), but the FO can still use these diamond in the rough picks as trade assets to insulate the roster that way."
"Over 40% 3pt shooting, those are Budy Hield numbers, Duncan Robinson, etc.. only the best specialists can do that, Lonzo is definitely not on that level. I think it's funny how the Ball family still have dedicated fans willing to throw crazy arguments to aggrandize their talent, JJ did it because he knew that would grab the attention of these weak minded individuals. It's not bad if Lonzo don't go over 40%, these are elite numbers as I said. 85% FT shooting is the same thing, etc.. And 45% 3pt shooting is beyond elite, Steph Curry could do that only one time in his entire career. It's not a sin if Lonzo doesn't have elite talent, that's what you people need to understand. And the same argument goes to LaMelo as well, depending on how he improves going forward in his career. Only very few players are truly elite, it's not that simple"
"We haven't had a (non-traded) FRP since 2018, but the last three that actually played for us were:  * Mo Wagner: 43 games, 446 minutes played  * Lonzo Ball: 52 games, 1780 minutes played  * Brandon Ingram: 79 games, 2279 minutes played  Granted, two of these guys were Top-3 picks, but we still played Wagner more than everyone but Vassell."
Same with the Bulls and Lonzo. Weve been linked to Ball for like 2 seasons now
"Bulls fans were leading the movement of Fire GarPax for years, and now look where we are. We fired GarPax and now have Lonzo Ball (2nd pick in the draft), the CaruShow, and the 82nd best player in the league.  Pelicans fans should rightfully be starting the Fire GarGriff movement right now. Your front office is terrible. Do you think it's just a coincidence that the Bulls stole a solid young player off your roster for crap after you made Gar Forman a special adviser?"
I'm here for Lonzo Ball man. He fits perfectly on that roster. And I'm glad the cameras are off his face (relatively) - now he just gets to improve with less pressure.
"The Bulls are legit, I think they are true contenders when fully healthy. They have three guys that know how to be the number one option for a team, who can score on all three levels, and two intelligent playmakers in Caruso and Lonzo that can play both sides of the ball. They are lacking depth, so health and finding the right rotations is really the key for them.  I'm not entirely convinced by the Wizards, I think they will perform relatively well during the regular season, but I think they will eventually fall to the 5th or 6th seed and be a 1st/2nd round exit come playoff time. They have the depth to be a consistent force, but when it comes to the playoffs, teams will lock up Beal and they won't have a true second star to rely on."
"I didn't think we would be number 1 or 2, but a lot of our fans thought we would be the 3 or 4 seed behind Nets and Bucks plus a wildcard team. We had decent defense last season at 12th and we boosted it a lot with just Caruso and Lonzo while Billy has been shown to be a great defensive coach. We were desperately missing a ball handler/passer which Caruso and Lonzo both fit. Need another scorer/closer. Demar fit that. Last season we picked up Vooch who is our man in the middle. Ceiling-wise I thought we could compete with any team just from a complete team aspect and talent wise.  Our team looked good and minus the Bucks and Nets, I didn't really see another team in the eat that was stacking up well. Philly have the Ben Simmons issue, Celtics are inconsistent and have fundamental issues with their starts, Hawks got nerfed by foul changes, Bucks and Nets have injury issues.  Hell, I even had a write up about this. It's half serious, but my viewpoint stands for a lot of it.  https://np.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/qb4mts/why_the_bulls_are_going_to_take_the_number_1_seed/"
"Because what he improves at doesn't fit with Zion or Ingram. Lonzo wants to be a floor general, but can't create his own shot. And the ball needs to be in the hands of Ingram and Zion more than Lonzo. If Lonzo had stayed, he would have been the new Gary Harris with us."
He basically Duncan Robinson but can dribble and pass the ball well in transition. People think of Lonzo has some playmaking pg when hes really a 3&amp;D guy with some playmaking skills.
Lonzo is fucking great man. Also one of the best on ball defenders in the league. Has a nose for steals too.
"Being a top 10 shooter is not the same as ""He's as good as anyone in the league at shooting the ball."" And that's what I take grief with, and yeah, I take it too personally because Lonzo is nowhere as good at shooting the ball as Steph. I will defend Steph to my dying breath on this sub."
"I meant Lakers should of signed Caruso and not Westbrook   But the Lakers didn't because last year in Caruso's final year, they never even tried to attempt to make him the starting PG   Not even for a 5 games stretch? Something?   If Lonzo didn't sign the bulls Caruso would be the starting Bulls PG   I was saying last year this, I'm just joe blow fan, that Caruso has proven he can do this and why aren't the Lakers trying this out ??   Dude is like Jason white chocolate Williams but Caruso can play defense just give him the ball and let him prove it   And now hes proving it   Lakers never tried it   Oh well players in bunches now switching teams like never before such is the league now and into the future"
"His layup package is AWFUL. I'm a MASSIVE Lonzo fan I've repped him since before UCLA, but it's seriously embarrassing that he has such a hard time doing a counter when going up for a layup. I don't know how he got through high school ball doing that, you need to learn how to finish vs a contest really early on. I don't think I've ever seen an NBA guard not be able to do that.  That said, even just as a three-and-D perimeter guard who love running the break he's extremely useful for any good team. Anything else they can get from him, like driving to the hole or PNR or drawing fouls or something, that's icing on the cake. He's not a star but on the right team he's a big positive."
"can someone at least show me something where he says or implies he doesn't want to stay in NOLA? I keep reading he doesn't like it there, but it only came from his dad or these armchair analysts. he even said he liked it [there](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lonzo-ball-says-he-didnt-want-a-trade-i-ended-up-not-getting-moved-and-staying-here-where-i-wanted-to-be/)"
"You got comments in the negative because they're pointing out Curry is a better shooter than Lonzo Ball (in response to he's as good as anyone in the league in terms of shooting), I think you're good"
Lonzo Ball: 7 for 10 from 3 point range!!!
JJ Is Full of crap. We traded holiday because we were starting to rebuild and he has been loyal to the organization and a good player so we treated him to what he wanted to go. Lonzo ball play like shit for the Pelicans. We put good teams around Anthony Davis we had a lot of injuries and Anthony Davis was always hurt. Also Anthony Davis could never close games. Also when we had DeMarcus Cousins he injured himself and was never the same. This year the pelicans have a ton of injuries. I hate when people who don‚Äôt watch the Pelicans or follow the organization always have a stupid opinion to give
His brother Lonzo Ball was a high school senior and soon to graduate.  LaMelo wasn‚Äôt yet old enough to play on the  high school team. So family petitioned to have LaMelo‚Äôs grade boosted up one year.  And then that team went 35-0.
"Honestly should have been the focus of the post's title. A 360 dunk is cool, but without the Lonzo lob the ball never get down court in time to pull it off."
"Laker fans don't hate the Pels man lol. Most of us want Ingram to do well.  I do think it was stupid how you guys let Lonzo and disagree heavily with you about Graham even being comparable to Lonzo nor is he a better fit. Lonzo is a much better shooter, defender, and transition playmaker. Graham can handle the ball better but you don't really need that with Ingram and zion."
Lonzo Ball
Lonzo Ball and Lonzo Bald
all props to lonzo on the improvement but he was always a capable shooter who shot step back threes like nobody‚Äôs business in UCLA obviously his shot didn‚Äôt translate and lonzo worked hard to work on his shot but the baseline for where lonzo started as a shooter is far and way above Ben Simmons who has never been comfortable shooting the ball in any level of basketball play
The day Zach was chillen on his couch drinking a Mountain Dew and scrolling through twitter and he read ‚ÄúLonzo Ball to Chicago‚Äù must have been a very happy day for him.
What about ‚ÄúCaruso diving steal leads to Lonzo Ball full court pass‚Äù

"Lonzo ""future All Star and multiple All Defense"" Ball"
"Lonzo ""Stephen Curry but a 40 Inch Vertical"" Ball"
"&gt; Okay, Lonzo Ball. The guy was available,  He was not available lol. Have you not seen any of the tampering data?  You're just listing a guard you like and saying they should've gotten them. You're not really looking at reality. Why don't they just get Steph? Or Ant?"
"Honest question, do you think Lonzo could make it as a QB? He‚Äôs got the size athleticism and instincts, I think he would‚Äôve been an NFL talent had the ball family went a different route lol"
"Okay, Lonzo Ball. The guy was available, they could have easily facilitated a sign and trade. He is currently 8th in DRTG among guards who play a lot (I filtered for &gt;30 mpg since we're talking about players who move the needle), and he's giving you 12.5/5.5/4.5/1.7/0.9 on 56% TS. He's also improving, and this year he's shooting 41% from 3 on 6.6 attempts. This guy is literally exactly what the 6ers need right now, he would be a big upgrade on both Maxey and Simmons. He could be their primary ball handler, and he has great vision. The only reason his assist number is down this season is because the Bulls are getting a ton of iso and FT scoring from Lavine and Derozan, otherwise Ball gives you 5.5-7 AST."
"No, but Lonzo Ball is the best 3pt shooter in the league"
"For real, all the tweets about it talk about LaVine (understandably) but Lonzo is probably the only Bulls player in recent history who can even get him the ball there"
"Lonzo ""Stephen Curry"" Ball"
Bulls are hard to beat when Lonzo Ball turns into Klay Thompson. Caruso has a shot at an all defensive team too.
"Man, Chicago is fuckin good. They move well off-ball, create turnovers, and there's enough good shooting to compensate for one or two guys being cold for a stretch. If Lavine doesn't get you, then Derozan will, and if Derozan doesn't get you, then Lonzo will, and if Lonzo doesn't get you, then Vuc will, and after all that, there's still Caruso...  I'm starting to wonder if we are going to make the playoffs based solely on the fact that like half our schedule is New Orleans, San Antonio, and Houston"
"Having your ball handlers have to deal with Caruso, Lonzo or Javonte is TOUGH."
This title does NOT sell it.   The interception by AC.   The fucking toss of Lonzo Ball.   The finish.
"Lonzo Ball, best quarterback in Chicago"
"**Not necessarily in order:**  1. Steph Curry 2. Luka Doncic  3. James Harden 4. Damian Lillard 5. Trae Young  6. Chris Paul  7. Kyrie Irving 8. Ja Morant  9. Jrue Holiday 10. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 11. Jamal Murray 12. LaMelo Ball 13. Ben Simmons  14. De'Aaron Fox 15. Russell Westbrook 16. Kyle Lowry 17. Mike Conley 18. Fred VanVleet 19. Malcolm Brogdon  Honestly, it's a close-run thing for DLo to make the top 20. There's still the likes of Darius Garland, Dejounte Murray, Lonzo Ball and Spencer Dinwiddie to consider."
"&gt; DRose, Brogdon, KCP, Dinwiddie, Smart, Rubio, Rozier, Conley, or even Lonzo Ball - all these guys are guards who definitely can contribute to a winning team, and you wouldn't need to give up more than just Simmons, at worst add a depth player or pick, to get even 2 of them.  I'd be surprised to find any of these players were being offered for Simmons. For a bunch of reasons.  &gt; All of those guys move the needle for the 6ers just like Jrue Holiday was the difference the Bucks needed to win a championship.  Milwaukee gave up Eric Bledsoe and some picks and got an elite defensive guard to be their 3rd-4th option. Do you think that a 4th option moves the needle for the sixers? Seriously?"
Lonzo ball will be an all star ... when he is 29.
"Have you seen how well D‚ÄôLo, Julius Randle, Brandon Ingram, and Lonzo Ball have been playing since they left LA? The Lakers are a farm team too!"
"I mean this is objectively bullshit right. They can get more than mediocre role players for Simmons. I think there are teams in the league who would be willing to trade a functional guard or 3&amp;D guys for Simmons. DRose, Brogdon, KCP, Dinwiddie, Smart, Rubio, Rozier, Conley, or even Lonzo Ball - all these guys are guards who definitely can contribute to a winning team, and you wouldn't need to give up more than just Simmons, at worst add a depth player or pick, to get even 2 of them. NOP would have done a sign and trade for Lonzo in a heartbeat this off-season, and Lonzo is playing amazing rn.   All of those guys move the needle for the 6ers just like Jrue Holiday was the difference the Bucks needed to win a championship."
"Lonzo is only a good playmaker in transition. He‚Äôs a good defender, but only off ball and against slower guards. He can‚Äôt stop the elite guards (Fox and Dame particularly torched Lonzo horribly).   The Pelicans want to put the ball in the hands of Zion and BI, so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre requiring much playmaking from our guards anyway.   If BI and Zion were healthy, Graham would be looking even better. In comparison, Lonzo is playing with all of his key players, and is only averaging 11 points.on 40% shooting.   Plus our bench has no real scoring, so if we were fully healthy, Graham could help our bench units a lot. Not to mention he cost almost half of what Lonzo cost."
"So I should say the Lakers can‚Äôt retain talent because they lost Dangelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Julius Randle?  When it‚Äôs part of a coherent strategy that doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Philadelphia has lost one player they intended to retain as part of their plans- Butler."
"&gt; Lonzo Ball... left asap to the Bulls to give them their best season in years  yeah, he didn't leave. they got rid of him after trying to get rid of him for most of the last season."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valanƒçi≈´nas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
You guys have been needing a real point guard for the past 2 seasons correct? I felt like Lonzo towards the end of the season was no longer handling the ball as much.
"Yup you‚Äôre absolutely right, however it is intriguing how many great prospects the Lakers have drafted in the last decade that went on to play decent minutes for other teams (obviously in order to trade for players like AD):  Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, Dangelo Russell, Larry Nance, Ivica Zubac, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Thomas Bryant, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Alex Caruso, Mo Wagner, Svi Mykhailiuk"
"Lonzo Ball giving the Bulls his best season in years. This implies Lonzo Ball has had a good season before this one.  Also, OP thinks farming does not make money. OP does not know much about farming."
"LMAO you put Christian Wood and Lonzo Ball, the highest paid 11ppg player in the league atm, in with CP, AD, and Jrue.  Come on now. AD was with the team 7 years, Jrue 7, CP 6, that‚Äôs longer than most players stick with a team."
"He doesn't handle the ball that much because lonzo and Caruso take care of fast breaks while if Lavine is on the court he's usually the one bringing it up. But when lavine is on the bench he still handles the ball well and his passing is still very good. He's only averaging 4 assists, but that's more so because as a team we pass a lot. I mean look at Lonzo's numbers they're down but he's definitely playing exceptional."
Lonzo ball really really struggled his first 2 seasons offensively
Joel Embiid punching Lonzo Ball.
Lonzo reminds me of the kid who's really good at basketball you play with at the gym or at the park growing up who sees you're not that good/struggling and makes sure to pass you the ball to include you lol. I love it.
"I feel like his ball handling not being NBA Ready is what's much more concerning than the shooting. Its harder to be that type of High IQ point guard when you dont have the handle to get to your spots on the floor. Still think he will become a very effective starter, but more of a Lonzo Ball than a Franchise leader."
"I mean team subs are always echo chambers.  For them, the team can do no wrong. But it's really fucked up that they knew LaMelo was BPA but then double-guessed themselves, reneged on their draft promise and picked Bagley 2.0  Was it because of LaVar? Were they scared LaMelo would end up like Lonzo when all signs pointed to no? Because they're more stupid than I thought if they thought Wiseman was BPA when he barely played in college against kids and Ball was stunting on pros in Australia.   They definitely fucked up passing on LaMelo, he would have been perfect in Kerr's system."
Lonzo ball is not worth his current contract and has regressed.
"Lonzo forced Vuc out of a shooting slump. Literally just kept shoving the ball to him until he started to make shots. Needed that, hoping that was enough of a confidence booster to get him back into the groove."
"Different situations imo. Embiid wildly swung a fist without looking and it almost clocked Lonzo hard, clearly he didn't intend to hurt anybody and was just frustrated but that's a reckless thing to do in the middle of a bunch of people. So, he gets called out for doing something reckless.  Morris, a notoriously dirty player (though the less dirty of the Morris' bros) targets Jokic from afar with no intention of going for the ball. Goes in knee first into Jokic's knee and an elbow to his ribs, intentionally hard fouling him. Then he turns around as if nothing happens and Jokic retaliates in anger. Jokic didn't react appropriately but it's not like Morris is a saint in this situation. Markieff was on the Lakers championship roster, he'll always be a champion Laker in my eyes but even I can admit he's dirty and was basically intentionally trying to hurt Jokic here.  You're trying to make this into something it isn't."
That's Lonzo ball.  But more seriously imagine steph in Ben simmons' body.
"He was very very bad tonight in those first three quarters (man had TWO [2] pts heading into the 4th), if you think otherwise you gotta rewatch the game lol. Bricking soo many bunnies that it got to the point he didn't even look at the rim when passed the ball n Lonzo even called him out and told him to shoot. Was completely in his own head. But it's great he got a chance to redeem himself in the 4th and showed up though, can only hope that carries thru to help him break out of this slump."
Lonzo Ball is significantly better than every Pelican starter tonight and they let him walk for nothing
Lonzo took the ball to the hoop and Harden took a little swipe at the ball and then just turned to watch.  Former MVP stuff baby
"At this point, theres only 2 cap heavy teams left that we haven't covered yet - Dallas and OKC. Theres also one that could open up significant space depending on how they decide to deal with their restricted guards and vets. The best FA left are Kelly Oubre Jr, Tim Hardaway Jr, Josh Hart, Bobby Portis and Otto Porter.    10. I expect Oubre to end up in Dallas as an intriguing two way player. He's supposedly someone they targeted at the deadline, and would be an offensive upgrade over Dorian Finney Smith. I'm also going to make a bold call and say that the Mavs are the best landing spot for Colin Sexton (lets say in a Sexton + Prince package for Josh Richardson, DFS and Cauley Stein...flame shield prepared). Dallas is under the clock to improve before Luka's max kicks in, and this is prohably their best route to add cheap talent while being in a position to pony up for Sexton's extension. All the while keeping flexibility on whether to dump Porzingis (for Kemba?!) or keep him. Let me be clear; I think its a mistake to trade Sexton but Cleveland seems determined to prioritize Garland and lean toward a small guard duo not working out long term. And the market is relatively dry for Sexton based on his salary demands and ability to translate performance into team success. This definitely figures to be a buyers market for Dallas. And I think they'll certainly bring back THJ, seeing quite a bit of success with him in a 6th man role. This positions them with a Doncic/Sexton/Oubre/Porzingis/Kleber starting 5.  11. The Pelicans are losing Lonzo, but I can't see them choosing not to match offers on Hart. He'll probably find a reasonable rate on the open market and fits well with their core. Its too hard to predict what trade target could elevate them to the next step with pick #10, a bunch of 2nds, Bledsoe and Adams (assuming no future picks in play because that would be pretty stupid) so I'm going to say they stay pretty similar. My crazy suggestion here is a Bledsoe for Buddy Hield type swap just based on whos left and readily available. They should just select Josh Giddey at 10 who force feeds Zion the ball and call it a day. By all accounts, Stan was not the right coach for this team, and maybe a fresh voice coupled with an age 25 Ingram, age 22 Zion and Steven Adams snot (correction: shot) can lift them into the playoffs.  12. I refuse to predict the Thunder. They hold all the power and will likely do something crazy to unwind this entire prediction by absorbing some star player who wasn't projected to move while acquiring 3 first round picks in the process. This on top of their 6 existing picks next week. The Thunder are scary, and NBA front offices should be doing everything possible to get Rob Hennigan a summer internship at Chesapeake arena so we can get their leaked whiteboard."
&gt;Lonzo Ball is the final piece of the big 3.  Woof
&gt;Lonzo Ball is the final piece of the big 3.  Lonzo is gone bro. Pelicans don't want to pay a guy 25 million to be a high-end role player for them. He's 23 so he could get better but they're not gonna bet on it for that kinda money. Sign and trade is almost inevitable.
"Right. Just over the past 10 years or so Wiggins, Simmons, Zion, Lonzo Ball, Luka... Fultz was not super hyped."

Fuck it we ball Lonzo improved every year I believe
"Oh man, I can name a few from the 2013-2019 dark years:  - Larry Nance Jr. making his own basket against the Clippers on Christmas 2015  - Robert Sacre inbounding it to fucking Jae Crowder and then fouling him as he makes the layup in a game in Dallas.  - D'Angelo Russell with that blunder on the fastbreak with Jordan Clarkson. Kobe then rolls his eyes afterwards lmao.  - Marcelo Huertas (the GOAT) and his backwards shot against the Heat.  - Jeremy Lin not fouling Mike Conley in crunch time while Kobe is yelling at him to foul so Kobe has to run up and do it himself.  - Lonzo passing up a wide open layup he could have got on the fastbreak and instead tries to pass it back to Javale McGee (who was behind him) but turns it over instead.  - LeBron not dribbling the ball to start the clock against the Nuggets and instead the ball just rolls out of bounds."
"This is not a great season for free agency.   &gt; Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry, John Collins and Spencer Dinwiddie are among the most compelling names to monitor"
"All of those are undoubtedly far worse-performing in this respect. But it's affecting his team (whichever team he might be) in the same way, even though not to the same degree.  Note u/dropdatdurkadurk was grouping them as playmakers anyway, not as shooters.  Fundamentally, we can say that  * Lonzo is a good off-ball stand-still 3pt shooter * Lonzo is not a sufficient threat as a shooter when on-ball to routinely command sufficient respect from defences as a pull-up shooter to create an advantage for his team and aid in playmaking  Those are both correct statements. And something that a simple 3P% doesn't cover. If Lonzo is in a primarily off-ball role, he doesn't even really need to improve on the latter, it'd be a total luxury. But seeing he's a widely discussed RFA and considered a PG (on-guard) who will command a &gt;20M/yr salary by many, it's important to consider how defenders respond to his pull-up threat -- by giving him space -- especially when combining that with his low scoring threat on drives to the basket. A ball-handler who is given space on the perimeter can't run a high-efficiency PnR, and that's relatively difficult to construct a top-tier team around -- not impossible, just hard.  You can say he's  * an underrated shooter by those who don't realise he's now taking and making 3s at volume and good efficiency, * but an overrated shooter in a primary-ball-handler role by those pointing at his 3P%, as all the good parts of that are off-ball rather than on-ball.  Now, he might well improve on that, and make the whole discussion moot. If he improves his off-the-dribble shots by just a few percentage points for a year or two, it will make defences respect him in a whole new way, and that will decidedly aid his playmaking and whatever team he's on."
"Lonzo ball shot 38% on 8 takes, how is he not a 3pt threat?  guess he's a good pick for an underrated shooter lol"
"If by well defined top 4, you mean top 4 prospects, I don‚Äôt think that was the case in 2017. People‚Äôs opinions on Tatum were all over the place.  3 writers‚Äô had big boards for the Ringer. Tatum was 2nd on KOC‚Äôs after Fultz (highest I‚Äôve seen him) followed by Lonzo, Fox, Isaac, Jackson in that order. Both other guys (Chau and Tjarks) had Tatum at 9th lol: Chau‚Äôs order was Fultz, Ball, Josh, Isaac, Fox, DSJ, OG, Frank, JT. Tjarks had Fultz, Ball, Isaac, OG, Josh, DSJ, Fox, Monk, JT.  Sports Illustrated‚Äôs final big board had him at 5th though they did say he ‚Äúshould be in the mix as high as No. 3 to the Celtics‚Äù and had an ‚Äúelite tier‚Äù ordered like Fultz, Fox, Jackson, Lonzo, Tatum. Bleacher Report‚Äôs final 1 had him at 6th after Fultz, Ball, JJ, Isaac, Fox.   Even in Nba.com‚Äôs mock draft 2 days prior, they had us taking Jackson after Fultz and Lonzo got picked then had Fox going at 4 and Tatum at 5 to the Kings."
Bridges could probably fit on any team but Ayton definitely needs a ball handler to feed him of the screen and rolls. His post game has to catch up to his touch for finishing inside. Booker's playmaking will improve but he'd be best with a primary ballhandler who can be effective off-ball too (imagine Lonzo).
"It seems like the Raptors are really interested in acquiring a tall PG.  They have been linked to Giddy, Ben Simmons, and Lonzo Ball."
The Knicks mean nothing. But y‚Äôall got 70mil in the black to pick up Lonzo Ball. It will get better man. I have plenty of Knicks fans in my family. Breathe.
"10 . New Orleans Pelicans Josh Giddey | 6-8 wing | 18 years old | Adelaide The player: Giddey had a terrific season in Australia, averaging 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, leading the league in helpers and finishing sixth in rebounding as an 18-year-old. He needs to tighten up his handle a bit and keep improving as a shooter, but the skill set here is perfect for that of a secondary playmaker at the next level due to how quickly he processes the game. Giddey should be a very high-level role player who starts, with some upside for more if the jumper gets figured out.  The fit: I have less of a feel for the Pelicans than any other team in the top 10. They have a tendency to draft younger (Kira Lewis, Zion Williamson and Jaxson Hayes were all teenagers when they were picked, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker was 20 years old) under this regime. Plus, their backcourt of the future could use a bit more size. I‚Äôve gone Giddey here, who would be a pretty great replacement for Lonzo Ball, given that Ball is a free agent and no guarantee to re-sign in New Orleans. One other note on Giddey: he has a lot of fans in ranges of the draft that aren‚Äôt his projected range, including Toronto ‚Äî one of the few teams to send personnel to see him live this year in Australia. Don‚Äôt be surprised to see a team target him in a trade situation."
Luka is a ball dominant PNR guard though? Like Harden.  I'm saying Lamelo is more of a PnR guard with very high potential because of it and Lonzo is a 3 and D guard. Both are very valuable imo
the lonzo ball finals mvp run is gonna be so good
"Like I said earlier. You can literally use lonzo as his duplicate. They both excel in the same thing except shooting. But unlike Simmons, ball has improved his game and is actually a threat now. Why? cause he can SHOOT. What has Simmons done? NOTHING."
"Hair that connects the a beard and is short looks fucked, like lonzo ball js ugly as fuck"
1/11 from Holiday... That's some rookie year Lonzo ball numbers.
Lonzo Ball.
"&gt;If it‚Äôs insane, then as previously stated it‚Äôs insane to expect that same guy to be able to perform for a team trying to make the playoffs in the western conference.  You‚Äôre contradicting yourself.   &gt;There core is Zion and Ingram and they‚Äôre still high on Kira, NAW and I‚Äôm sure would like to bring back Lonzo. Kispert‚Äôs skill set isn‚Äôt so unique that you have to grab him. Of course he would be on his rookie deal, but you‚Äôre also with the uncertainty that he may not work. It‚Äôs not like a shooter on the market is gonna be requesting max money.  Once again there is uncertainty that every single player to ever exist may not work. That is a flawed argument that makes completely 0 sense.   &gt;Of course other rookies have done it, but if you‚Äôre New Orleans in the western conference it‚Äôs incredibly unrealistic to expect that from Kispert his rookie year.   It‚Äôs unrealistic to expect a 4 year college player that was a good shooter to be a good shooter?   &gt;Again guys like Tatum, Mitchell were the exception.  Again when I brought up Tatum I was specifically highlighting his contribution to winning as a rookie. Not his post season play, not his stardom, not even him being a starter and playing 30 minutes a game. I literally put in parentheses ‚Äúwhat they can provide to a team‚Äù because I knew it would be something you would take out of context like you just have.   &gt;Look at guys like Joe Harris who couldn‚Äôt hit a shot when Brooklyn needed him to last year in the playoffs.He‚Äôs a vet, a proven player, and was playing next to better players than Kispert would be in New Orleans and it just didn‚Äôt happen for him. Guys who‚Äôve been in the league for a while come up short in those spots. Hoping rookie year Kispert won‚Äôt is a hell of a bet.  Joe Harris shot 40% from 3 on 7 attempts a game in the 2021 playoffs.    &gt;Bro Lonzo and Bledsoe started over him because they‚Äôre vets. He‚Äôs 23 years old.  Lonzo ball is 10 months older than Nickeil Alexander-Walker.    &gt;He can round into being an efficient player. NAW is a safer bet than Kispert is in being an effective high level player in the league.  Based on what? There‚Äôs a track record in the NBA of shooters sticking more than rotational creators.  &gt;I keep mentioning them because Kispert will never play ahead of Zion and Ingram, you know the wings in New Orleans?  1. For the 4th time, position-less basketball. you can place multiple guys in multiple spots on the floor a different times.   2. Ingram, and Zion aren‚Äôt each playing 48 minutes a game.   &gt;Gordon again is just a template. Go get for Fournier, Alec Burks, type guys I don‚Äôt care.   You keep saying they can simply just get these guys yet keep brining up terrible examples, which is once again directly proving my point to how hard it is to get shooter and where their value stands in this league. Evan Fournier got paid 17million last season, Alex burks got paid 6 million last year and was on a. 11 million a year contract before that.   &gt;There guys who anyone who regularly watches the sport would count on as quality role players next year Ingram and Zion over Kispert  Well yes, I too would count 2 veteran starters as good role players to put next to Ingram and Zion. The problems are ;  1. They are going to get PAID up to 4x the amount of money kispert will, annually.   2. They are free agents and have no reason whatsoever to go to New Orleans unless they are getting over paid (ie JJ Reddick), when they can get paid their market value and have similar roles on better teams or in better cities.   Your entire argument in this thread against Kispert to New Orleans is illogical, contradictive and baseless. We‚Äôre going in circles and I‚Äôm responding to the same points over and over. I‚Äôm done here, have a good day üëçüèæ"
"This is extreme cope, Lonzo and Graham pick and roll numbers are the same, mediocre lol. They also both can‚Äôt score inside with Graham shooting 37% from 2 and they both shoot the 3 ball at the same % so if Lonzo is inconsistent so is Graham.   Graham also isn‚Äôt a better defender than Lonzo vs guards nor does he have the same versatility because he is 5/6 inches shorter. Graham isn‚Äôt a good shot creator by any metric so idk where that is coming from, yes you guys did a sign and trade but you gave up a 1st round pick to do so which terrible."
"I don't get it. IMO DeMar is a great fit with Zach. Deebos spacing is sus sure, but Lonzo is a great spot up 3pt shooter, Zach can score from anywhere, PWilly shot 39% from 3 on 2 attempts which is not bad for a rookie 3/4, Vooch is one of the better stretch bigs in the league (40%3P on 6 attempts).  What DeMar brings is another super efficient ball handler that can slash into the paint or obviously kill the midrange, likely drawing another guy over from time to time, leaving one of those 4 good-great shooters open, and with him being a much improved playmaker will be able to find that man and make that pass.  This is the most excited I've been about Bulls BBall in forever."
"All-NBA defense? Amazing playmaking? I do not understand which Lonzo ball some of you watched. He‚Äôs good at throwing lobs/outlet passes in transition. He is a slight positive perimeter defender, much better off ball than on ball defender at that. He does not stay in front of his man like Jrue Holiday level defender, he gets cooked on ball pretty often.  I‚Äôll save the energy, you all will come to the realization that we did soon enough. We were also optimistic about him when we first acquired him, he‚Äôs just not that guy."
Vuc and derozan is such a horrible frontcourt defensively lol and bigs are going to continue to feast on the bulls like they did last season. I don‚Äôt see a POA defender on the bulls so I assume lonzo will be used as one and that will be bad sense he‚Äôs much better off ball‚Ä¶they did get another ball handler next to lavine but defensively that team looks horrible. Luckily they‚Äôre in the east so I think they could be a 8-7th seed team.
"Lonzo isn‚Äôt a primary ball handler. I‚Äôm a huge Lonzo fan and they didn‚Äôt bring him in to dominate the ball. I love Lonzo and have been rooting for it all year so don‚Äôt misinterpret, but Lonzo doesn‚Äôt drive a ton, doesn‚Äôt take twos a lot, doesn‚Äôt get to the rack, and has never surpassed 7.5 APG and has bounced in the 5-7 range. Lonzo isn‚Äôt coming to Chicago and becoming Rondo.   Why this fit actually makes sense to me is that they need more D but I don‚Äôt actually believe they need more *3* and D when it comes to the starters. Vooch is plus at his position. Lonzo is 37+% and LaVine is 40+% on 8 3PA per game. PWill took under 2 3PA per game but shot .391% as a rookie.   The team has plenty of stretch. The needed playmaking and rim driving on offense more when Demar provides. Lonzo provides playmaking but he‚Äôs not a half court ball dominant PG nor is he a 10 APG guy. And he‚Äôs not a driver.   They do need to be way better on D"
Are the Bulls too obvious? They have 3 all stars with Patrick Williams and Lonzo Ball rounding out the starting 5. That's pretty good.
"Lonzo didn‚Äôt want to stay, and he wasn‚Äôt worth the money he wanted at the jump. He can‚Äôt play the pick and roll, his off-ball defense is mid (his on-ball defense is cool but he gets overmatched a ton), he obviously can‚Äôt score inside being a 6‚Äô6 point guard, and his saving grace, his 3 point shot is inconsistent. If you watched Lonzo this year, you wouldn‚Äôt give him 21 million.  We also got a sign and trade for him. We also got a better replacement in Graham who can play the pick, can guard point guards well, and can create his own shot and hit threes at a high rate. We‚Äôre fine."
"The weird thing about Graham is that he doesn't ""look"" that good. He's not been shooting well, has a reputation of an awful defender, some fans say he also cannot run the offense, and generally everybody thinks that Pelicans absolutely demolished themselves getting him for Lonzo. It was sure they're gonna push him just for picks (which I was writing more as a joke, I probably joked about a greater return than what they actually got now).  BUT... The Hornets were always a miles better team with him than without him! By so far and so universally that it seems suspicious. It's not a fluke, they did generally very bad without him. Every player - Rozier, Hayward, LaMelo - Hornets had a positive score when they played with Graham, and negative without him. Especially when they played LaMelo without Graham, they were getting completely destroyed. Especially the defensive rating of the team was much better.  So... does he actually have a good side that fans don't see? Is he actually a good playmaker for others? Is his off-ball defense sneakily on point and filling the gaps, more than making it up for what fans see as bad individual defense? Does his ability to avoid turnovers, and to generate opponent turnovers, have an underrated influence on the score?  I think some of it is true. But I'm not betting yet on Pellies succeeding with him."
"- You answered your own question. They're ""trying"" but effectively this is a rebuild. A part of the rebuilding process is letting the new star learn from scratch, and grow with the team.   - Because picks are valuable? Tf kind of question is that? They can package them in deals.   - Lonzo is not a good fit with Zion, I will die on this hill.   - Graham won't be main ball handler. Satoransky likely will, and he'll be perfect for the role, because he will enable Zion."
"**Offensively, they are a superb fit.**   Zach doesn't need the ball in his hands to do his thing, and for a lot of last season he did not because the Bulls were desperately trying to make PG Coby White work (it did not). When it wasn't Coby, the ball was often in Thaddeus Young's hands to be a playmaker. There is a reason why Bulls fans were so desperate for a PG.  You have to actually watch Lonzo to realise this, but Lonzo isn't a great point guard. He has great vision, but his subpar handle makes him struggle to playmake in the half court and in pick and roll. DeMar can do all of that at a high level. I don't see why you think the offence would stagnate with the ball in DeMar's hands - he's not a scorer that passes sometimes, he's legitimately a good primary playmaker. Lavine is someone who fits in the former category and the ball is definitely better in DeMar's hands for a team offense.   Caruso will be backup PG alongside Coby White, letting him go back to his natural role as a scorer and end the terrible PG experiment. They fit well together. Is 8m or whatever Caruso got too much for a backup PG? Maybe, but that's what they needed with Sato gone.   * Lonzo will thrive when he doesn't have to be the primary playmaker, and he can act as an elite glue guy offensively.  * Lavine will thrive going from 0 playmaking around him to 3-4 playmakers in the starting unit, and the best spacing he's ever had. * DeMar with thrive with 4 shooters around him, giving him space to operate. * Patrick Williams is a guy who can fit anywhere on any team, but we will see how improved he is next season. * Vuc will play with guys who can really collapse a defense and draw attention away from him for the first time in his career. He won't be getting doubled in the post with the shooting around him.  4/5 guys are very efficient offensive players, and I feel like each one of their starters is going into the best situation of their career.  Their bench is a little dicey atm and we need to see what moves they have planned, but I think the Caruso/Coby back court is a great fit.  **Defensively, they will be bad**  Chicago had really poor defensive schemes last year. Vucevic was a neutral defender in Orlando, mostly because Clifford's excellent defensive schemes and our mostly decent perimeter defenders were able to limit situations that were bad for him (i.e. Vuc was rarely caught out in an island guarding a small). Wendell Carter Jr was called a horrible defender by Chicago fans pre-trade, but the situations flipped after the trade. Wendell seemed like a pretty solid defender, if a little small, and Vuc was seen as a horrible defender. The difference is not in the players, but that the schemes in Chicago basically sacrifice the big because their perimeter defense was so bad. Rudy Gobert would be a neutral defender at best on last years Bulls. Lonzo and Caruso were upgrades, but I think they need a new defensive coordinator or something because a couple of good but not great guys aren't gonna fix it. DeMar and Lavine are bad defenders too.  Also to your point about 1on1 defenders, you are right but I think Patrick Williams can be that lockdown guy. He was decent but not great on defense, but that's to be expected for rookies. He has the tools to be a monster on that end.  I expect the Bulls to have one of the best offences in the league, especially if they can shore up their bench (maybe via S&amp;T for Lauri). Their defense will be bad, worse if they keep doing what they were doing last year. We will see I suppose."
Lonzo Ball
Idiot fuckwit Lonzo Ball stans out in force huh?
"I don't mind Lonzo and Caruso, but DeRozan clearly seems like a panic pick up in order to discourage LaVine from leaving...  DeRozan is basically the same archetype of a player as LaVine... Rhythm shooting combo guard that needs the ball in his hands but can't run the offense... And then you have to factor Lonzo in there somewhere too. I know LaVine can shoot from outside, but im not sure he's willing to veer more into a  Klay Thompson role to accommodate Lonzo and DeRozan needing time on the ball to maximize their effectives.   The Bulls might make the Playoffs still, on talent alone, since the Eastern conference is kind of trash after like the first 5,6 teams, but they're definitely not gonna make a deep run, imo"
"Lonzo has never been the primary ball handler on a team, he can run a full court/transition offense but in the half-court he doesn't handle. Lonzo was brought in as more of a complement, off-ball PG that can play defense, hit the 3 and slash to the basket. You'll see Derozan handling the rock primarily since Lavine can play off-ball as well.  In regards to your concern with spacing, that's a non issue. Vucevic, Lonzo and Lavine are all prominent 3 point shooting threats with Coby and Caruso off the bench. As a matter of fact you'll see Derozan operate with a ton of room because of this and most likely thrive.  Just sit back and relax, this team has the tools to be a playoff team now, let's just hope they put it together."
"As the primary ballhandler, no? That's what Lonzo has been brought for. And we already have Zach who needs a lot of touches. It can still work out but the main issue is the defense and lack of spacing when he plays off-ball."
"I think most of the hype is the Lonzo signing(he's such a nice fit for us and we needed Caruso for depth) and that hype is seeping over into the other moves, mainly the Derozan move which I'm not a fan of. If we just got Caruso and Demar, there wouldn't be nearly as much buzz, so consider most of the hype from Ball instead of the other signings equally.  I've never been a fan of the Vooch trade, but after we did that we couldn't really do anything else but go all in. The long term hope is that we start winning with our core of Ball, Lavine, Paw and Vooch just enough(we're obviously still not contenders) to entice big name FAs to join us and put us over the top."

"As a bulls fan, what's the alternative? Another year of mediocrity and wasting our valuable players time even more and go into another rebuild? The NBA is offense and talent based now, and even if the fit is weird, the bulls spent and got talent. For me, that's a win.  Our defense isn't that horrible btw. Lonzo, Williams are solid. Zach is a good on ball defender and Vuc is ok man to man vs bigs. It is up to Billy to make them operate with functional team defense."
"How do you get this thought? Most people believed Lonzo was a necessary and excellent fit with this roster to begin with.   Derozan is yet another excellent playmaker coming in and he can help take some load off Lonzo on that end as well.   Look I‚Äôve always been very skeptical about Derozan as a player due to his terrible defense and the fact he always chokes in big moments. But bringing him in as a third option offensively and someone who can run plays as well is far from a poor fit here. The major worry will be our defense and I will a lot of that is going to boil down to how much of a leap Patrick can take on that end as well as if Lavine is able to continue to improve.   But ultimately, every guy in our lineup is excellent off ball and doesn‚Äôt require that the ball be in their hands to be effective. The Bulls were dead last most of the season in turnovers as well as struggling to get foul calls. The additions of Lonzo and Derozan are direct fixes to these issues."
Lakers and any team consisting of former lakers funnily enough my favorite player is lonzo ball so yeahhh guess I‚Äôm a Chicago fan now too
"It was a joint article with the Athletic, and the article literally said that it doesn‚Äôt mean Zion himself wants out.  Zion gave us 1 year of mostly healthy production. It wouldn‚Äôt make since to be totally fed up after 1 year. And it‚Äôs not like the lack of success is totally on the team. We had a good team in Zion‚Äôs rookie year, but he came into training camp out of shape and got injured. When he came back halfway through the season, the team was already on an upward swing and  we continued to do better. We were on track to be the 8th seed until COVID happened. When we went to the bubble, Zion was out of shape and on heavy minute restrictions, which contributed in us getting embarrassed along with Lonzo Ball being terrible (same guy were being trashed for not giving 22mil too).   Zion has a good roster right now that is good enough for him to make the playoffs with. An all star wing, a top 10 center, and 2 good young guards. Plus, we still have more moves to make. All we need is for Zion and Bi to actually play defense.  If Zion actually wants out, the league is in a bad place, because the Pelicans haven‚Äôt been so bad to where that is warranted. Not only do we have a solid team, we have a ton of assets too. You should know since you‚Äôre a Timberwolves fan, that building a good team takes time, especially if your best players are injured for a long period of time."
"His facilitating and passing have improved, but he‚Äôs going to a team that already had Levine to do that, and just signed Lonzo ball to do that as well. So that leaves Derozan to become more of a spot up shooter, which he is terrible at, especially from 3. That will hurt Vuc too, as the lane will be clogged since no one will be afraid of Derozan shooting.  And all that is before his terrible defense, which does indeed matter.  There‚Äôs a reason why every credible basketball analyst is killing this deal. The only people who seem to like it are people on Reddit, and we as a whole generally don‚Äôt know what the hell we‚Äôre talking about."
"not at all. i feel like you're only saying this because he's not known for being a good defender...his passing game has developed tremendously. people clowned us for picking up lonzo about how he's not a good half court playmaker...so we got one. he's going to be HUGE for our ball movement and having another guy who's great at attacking the basket doesn't hurt either.   we added another 20+ PPG scorer and we already had 2 of them. i see absolutely no reason why this would be a terrible fit, especially considering the fact that we're very likely about to try and add some defensive minded wings/bigs to the roster."
That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no lolknicks so they‚Äôre malfunctioning  Guarantee there would be the same post like this asking ‚Äúwell shit why did the Knicks throw $21mil at Demar/Lonzo??? It‚Äôs a 3 ball era now‚Äù
"Lonzo came into the league as a pass first ball handler lol, while he is better off ball he's not bad with ball handling duties.   Demar and Lavine have completely different skillsets. Demar is a post player who plays in the mid range and close to the basket. Who has good vision to pass out of the post. Lavine is an ""okay"" passer but exceels at spotting up from 3 and creating expulsive plays with his ball handling. These two will benefit from each other if anything. Since Lavine creates space for Demar to work in the post and Demar has good enough vision to hit Lavine who can hit the easy 3's. Demar can also cut very well and create space for Lavine on drives.   The point is all of their players can create open shots for other players and all of them can make the easy pass. Also Caruso isn't a bad offensive player he's just a 3nD guy his points will rely soley on his minutes and the spacing his team can create which is a lot."
"The Spurs had two good back court defenders in Murray and white (Murray being elite). Caruso is flat out a bad offensive player, and Lonzo is really only great off ball. There‚Äôs too much of a skills overlap between demar and Lavine IMO. Also Pwill will be the PF over demar.  I think this bulls team is being drastically overrated right now"
They missed out on Lonzo Ball (xoxo knicks fans) so now they‚Äôre doing the next best thing.
"Demar, Lonzo can def handle, Zach, I mean they're not short of ball handlers."
"Lonzo fits perfectly next to Lavine and Demar. Zo handles in transition while Demar handles in the half court with Lavine as a secondary ball handler and Zo as a great option for touch passes, swinging it, and lobs."
Lonzo Ball.
"Well, Pat Will anyway. Lonzo has all the tools and it'll come down to group culture/his role. I think in his off-ball role (which he'll definitely have, because Lavine and DeMar) he can spend more energy on D. He and Caruso are going to terrorise guard combos in crunch time. Hoping P-Will takes the next step defensively - he's already ahead of the development curve on that side of the ball IMO."
Sort of. He's not much of a shot creator in the half court (like Lonzo) but brings the ball up and gets it moving immediately.
Are there 2 Lonzo's because that's not Lonzo Ball you're talking about
"But you gotta consider that we have the carushow  Edit: Seriously tho, lonzo should be able to get Vuc better looks and take the ball handling pressure off Lavine. He‚Äôs a legit point guard. Derozan is a consistent 20+ scorer, having 3 legit scoring threats in Vuc, Lavine and Derozan plus a floor spacer/distributor in Lonzo and hopefully Pwill can improve looks real good to me on paper, but well see how it goes."
Man. Idk if I‚Äôm just being cynical but I‚Äôm not convinced Lonzo ball and demar move the needle that much.
In what world can Lonzo Ball ‚Äòdo it all‚Äô? He wasn‚Äôt even the PG last year.
Very good! Maybe he‚Äôs has a little less stats but graham doesn‚Äôt get the press or the ball as much as lonzo and graham is a competitor.. at that value and putting a fire under his ass he‚Äôs gonna be awesome. Plus he has a wayyyy faster pace than lonzo and that‚Äôs gonna set Zion up so much more on breaks and cuts. I like the trade plus the assets
"Lonzo played more off ball last year. BI and Zion were the main ball handlers. It‚Äôll probably stay like that this year, but we‚Äôll have better spacing."

"Zion leaving New Orleans is a media dream, KAT been to the playoffs one time &amp; you don‚Äôt hear shit about them, same can be said with De‚ÄôAaron Fox except he hadn‚Äôt been to the post season. Neither are on Zion‚Äôs level but only the Pelicans are fucking up right? Trading away Bledsoe and Adams was dumb, letting Lonzo Ball leave is a disaster and Zion should turn in his jersey tomorrow!"
"Yeah I‚Äôm really trying to cope over losing Lonzo ball, the guy that I‚Äôve been wanting off the team all season."
"Lonzo is solid on ball, but he‚Äôs elite off ball. He‚Äôs a great team defender, but struggles to guard the top guards because he‚Äôs not good at navigating screens. Chicago fans should know this after their backcourt destroyed us in multiple games lol.  I don‚Äôt know much about Caruso‚Äôs defense, I was just talking about the starters."
Lonzo and Caruso are 100 percent elite on ball defenders. I mean idk what you classify as elite but both are top 20 defensive guards
"Defensively they will be avg, Lonzo is good off ball getting steals but terrible on ball and the others are alright at best. First round exit type team"
"Lonzo is a massively improved 3 point shooter, Lavine is a sniper, and DeMar is always a threat within the line. DeMar is able to pass and score without being incredibly ball dominant, so I think the fit is good."
Lonzo D. Ball
I forgot about vucevic for a sec and was like... Lonzo ball is your second option?
"Yea that pick and roll defense with wither Zach or Demar and Vuc is going to be rough. I imagine they'd see a lot of that in the playoffs. Vuc is going to be left out there to die for a lot of possessions. The offense SHOULD be very good though. Lonzo should fit in amazing on offense as a ball mover, off ball threat. I can't wait to see what Pat looks like"
"I also see big problems for them on offense. Vuc, DeRozan, Lonzo and Lavine are all high volume, ball dominant guys (Playing with DeRozan off ball is playing 4 on 5). They will have a bunch of cool highlights, but this team is a 1st round exit at best."
"It‚Äôs only a 4 year deal CP3, Melo, and Bron will take a pay cut to play on the Chicago Bulls with Lonzo Ball. D-Wade will come out of retirement to join the banana boat."
"Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, and now Alex Caruso all we‚Äôre done terribly by the Lakers who dumped them the first chance they got to get a star. They probably did Caruso the worst.   Good job ignoring 5 of the 6 players you fucked over though."
"Lonzo sucks on the perimeter, he‚Äôs only a off ball defender"
"Lonzo and Caruso are great defensively. Idk about their bigs. What I find really intriguing is how they‚Äôre gonna work Derozan, Ball, and Lavine together."
Non-ball-dominant Lonzo's playmaking+Walking bucket Lavine+All-around player in DeRozan+Defensive wing PWill+Vucevic who can fit well in literally any system doesn't fit well together?? We just gotta play the hot hand between Lavine and DeRozan. Lonzo will just feed these guys or find Vooch on an open pick and pop or in the post. The spacing is great and no one is particularly hogging the ball
Depends if DeRozan can play like a 3rd or 4th option.  None of that Ball hog shit.  Honestly this move is kinda lame. I would have rather wanted pat and Lonzo to take more shots but now DeRozan is gonna take them.
"I disagree that Lonzo can handle the ball. Maybe in a fast break but even then who cares? Give the ball to Lavine and get out of the way. And Lonzo has shown no ability to run an actual NBA half court offense, he just doesn‚Äôt have the patience nor the vision."
LMAO you didn‚Äôt watch the Pels. Jrue ran point almost every possession in the half court. Lonzo would pass the ball every time he touched it. BI spaced for Jrue.
"I hope you guys like DeMar's playing style but i sure as hell never liked it.   Vucevic - Lavine - Lonzo - DeMar, all of them (except maybe Lonzo?) are ball handle-first types so i wonder how it's going to play out"
"I agree. I thought Lavine would leave but they‚Äôve built a great team around him and are trying to contend. That‚Äôs all you can ask for as a franchise player. Imagine you miss a shot, Lonzo rebounds and pushes the ball up court with Lavine &amp; Derozan on each wing. Someone is getting a no look pass for a dunk or an alley oop. They‚Äôll be a lot of fun to watch next year for sure. They have the talent to matchup against the contenders in the conference. Vucevic is really underrated as a pick and pop/roll threat, can shoot, nice footwork and postgame."
This team looked lost with Vuc and Lavine. Lonzo Ball and an Old Demar give me zero confidence.
"I can see the bulls flipping Lauri and Coby White for a big now too. Lotta guards on the roster   (Lonzo Ball, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, Devon Dotson)"
"Lonzo D Ball, Alex D Caruso, Patrick D Williams.  They all gonna die happy."
"Yeah this isn't it for us. DeRozan is a great scorer and recently good playmaker, but doesn't take threes and can't defend to save his life. I don't know how he's gonna be with Lavine and Lonzo given how he's ball dominant.  We are now good on periemeter defense but borderline terrible on paint defense with Thad gone. We gotta sign&amp;trade Lauri at this point."
"I assume in that lineup Lonzo would guard the toughest wing assignment, and against teams that go smaller you have Williams and Ball together on the wings."
Zach LaVine DeMar DeRozan Nikola Vucevic Lonzo Ball Alex Caruso   Damn
No defense with Carusogoat and lonzo ball?
It‚Äôs always advantageous to have multiple playmakers than just Lonzo ball
We still don‚Äôt have a half court playmaker which killed us last year more than anything. Demar and Lavine split the ball handling in the halfcourt with Demar doing the majority of the playmaking. Lonzo will run the break and spot up off ball in the halfcourt. Defense will be weak but the offensive fit is great imo
"If Lonzo continues to shoot the ball well, then DeRozan will be the only non-shooter. We got Coby on the bench too, so spacing is no issue."
That Lonzo Ball Bulls jersey is a MUST cop!
"Lonzo gives the Bulls someone who can playmake, allowing Lavine to work more off ball. He also is elite in transition, something Chicago sorely lacked after the Vuc trade. Is it an overpay? Maybe. But FAs were getting paid yesterday. It's the nature of the beast."
"The fact is even if I were to accept the premise that Lonzo can replicate his career best averages (and obviously I‚Äôm skeptical), in most cases his career bests are comparable to Graham‚Äôs career averages.   And they are both young players with room to improve.   You have utterly failed to prove why Ball at 20 mil a year is a better deal than Graham at 10 mil a year."
"Less efficient shooter? They're almost the *exact* same.   Ball: .551 TS% and Graham .552% TS  Lonzo is a better defender but he's so overrated at it. He's not a difference maker on that end at all. Advanced stats even show Graham as the best player. You're just wrong, it is at the very least close."
"How? How was Lonzo a perfect fit next to Zion?  You are just parroting things other people say and have no idea what you are talking about   He wasn‚Äôt a good fit for Zion. He wasn‚Äôt a good enough 3 point shooter to stand in the corner and benefited from Zions gravity.  Graham is a substantially better catch and shoot 3.   He couldn‚Äôt create his own offense off the dribble to maximize the space that BI and Zion open.  Again, Graham is substantially better.  Graham again, is a better facilitator and passer than Lonzo. Lonzo cannot create offense for anyone. He can‚Äôt drive and dish because he can‚Äôt drive.  He can‚Äôt run the pick and roll because he can‚Äôt shoot  Graham is a significantly better offensive fit for Zion and the Pelicans than Lonzo.   Additionally the nephews keep talking about how great Lonzo‚Äôs defense is, that that‚Äôs not true.  He‚Äôs straight bad as an on-ball defender.   He is fantastic as an off ball defender and that will big a big hole to fill, but OK.  That doesn‚Äôt make him a fit with Zion."
"Nah, considering only one year of FT percentage which happens to be a drastic outlier over his other years and career average is silly.   Lonzo has improved his shot but he isn‚Äôt a natural shooter and never will be, and betting on him to replicate career best numbers isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd want to do.   Never had a good feeling with him shooting the ball.  If the Pelicans had given him +20 mil a year they would be dooming the team to never make the playoffs.   The Pelicans have made numerous mistakes but moving on from Ball wasn‚Äôt one of them."
"That's why I'm confused. Sato and Temple are alright but the Pels are taking more cap and aren't really getting a return for Lonzo Ball, who had a LOT of attention at the trade deadline last yr. I feel like the Pels coulda got more"
"People on Reddit play too much 2K and think you can just blow up a team by firing up the trade finder and signing an MVP caliber player in the offseason. Bottom line this move clearly makes the Bulls better and Lonzo, flaws and all, compliments their star in LaVine and fits his timeline quite nicely. Plus, Ball is still very young and has shown he‚Äôs capable of putting in the work to improve."
"Defensive raitings for last season   Lonzo Ball - 113.7   Devonte Graham - 116.5     So neither of them are very good defensively, Ball is slightly better, not significantly, and definitely not 10 million dollars more a year significant.    And when you look at this stat:  ""According to Second Spectrum, Graham shot 42.6% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, a mark that was ninth out of 62 NBA players who shot at least four catch-and-shoot 3-pointers a game.""     That is actually significant."
"Well... I'm not sure why anybody would expect anything different.  They already did this with AD.  Why wouldn't it end the same with Zion?  They got so many assets back in the Lakers trade, and one of the best turned out to be Lonzo Ball, who showed immense improvement this year.  And then they just let him go? They'd better match that deal, or they are just signaling that they don't want to pay to win.  Which is what happened in OKC when the shipped Harden out.  And we know how that ended."
23 years old.. doesn‚Äôt rely on explosive speed.. ACL isn‚Äôt a killer especially on more slender guys (rip jabari)   Also like.. you could sign anyone and they could blow their acl. You‚Äôd still prob get sato and a 2nd for a Lonzo one less ACL Ball. Lol
Have you seen Lonzo shoot the ball?   Lol.   his career free throw percentage is closer to Shaq's than to what you'd expect from a respectable guard.
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
"Lonzo is on his first of two or three big contracts. Lamelo looks like he's going to be a max player. Liangelo is on the Pistons G-League team.   Lavar Ball, while taking care of his disabled wife, got three sons to the NBA, and two of those sons are likely going to earn well over 9 figures before they're 30. The one who won't is already a millionaire. That's after he got them all to UCLA.   I don't care how you feel about Lavar, his antics, or him being loquasious. That's one hell of an accomplishment. He's still close with all of his kids and they're all seemingly good people (and yes that includes Liangelo. Stealing sunglasses when you're 19 doesn't make you a bad person forever)"
"He‚Äôs good/great off-ball. He‚Äôs mediocre on ball. Really struggles to navigate around screens, gets lost on pick n rolls. Lonzo is the better player with higher upside but their splits and what they do are super similar. Both are good on the catch and shoot, both are non factors acting the basket which makes them not the ideal G to control the ball in half court sets. I do think Graham is more likely to buy into that role of being a bridge facilitator/spot up shooter in half court for about half the price."
Bro it's lonzo fucking ball he isn't good enough to give a shit what he wants.  You re sign his ass and he figures it out or you end up with a tradeable player that lots of teams value around the league.  Now you have some trade scraps and cap space in New Orleans good fucking luck.
"Damn, I was honestly really really starting to enjoy the dynamic that young New Orleans core was building together and looking forward to seeing that Lonzo/Zion connection getting even better. If Lonzo could continue his growth from this season as a shooter and scorer and build even more consistency, that would hopefully provide Zion and Ingram more spacing and make for a potentially dangerous trio as they all mature and improve.  With that said, I get that New Orleans had tough decisions to make and more in the future. This year when Lonzo showed he could actually do more and improved his game to the point he did, it was almost a foregone conclusion somebody was going to pay him more than the Pels. Especially since they're seemingly perfectly fine with turning Zion into a big ass point guard, and it's worked out quite well for them üòÇ.  I know some people just don't like the Ball brothers, but I think Lonzo seems to have a pretty decent head on his shoulders for a guy that had to grow up with LaVar Ball as a dad and all the unnecessary hype and controversy his idiot dad pretty much entirely created for him. I'm happy for the guy doing well and hopefully he's able to just continue doing his thing without LaVar making it difficult, and he's able to continue improving.  If he clicks well with Lavine they could actually be a pretty fun duo to watch on the court together as well."
Paying Lonzo ball 85 million a year ü§°
"Fuck it, I‚Äôll throw you another bone and re-engage because unlike you, I‚Äôm not lying to myself and pretending I‚Äôm above having this conversation. I love how you jerk yourself off about nuance and then present ‚Äújust sign Lonzo Ball instead‚Äù as your argument. Here‚Äôs some nuance: Lonzo Ball would have to want to go to Phoenix too. *If* they even have the cap (I‚Äôm no Suns fan, idk if they do or don‚Äôt) to offer on an outside free agent like Ball, he would still have to agree to play there. All signs seem to indicate that Lonzo specifically wanted to be on the Bulls. So how would they get Lonzo? I don‚Äôt think CP3‚Äôs contract is some incredible value, but I think it keeps Phoenix as competitive as they can possibly be in the short-term and I personally don‚Äôt think it will be as crippling long-term as you seem to believe. I‚Äôm also highly skeptical of the assertion that Booker is furious about it when as far as I know, he has enjoyed playing with CP3, and I would certainly assume that he wants Phoenix to remain as competitive as possible. I don‚Äôt really expect the Suns (or the ‚ÄúBuns‚Äù as your remarkably high-IQ self has dubbed them) to win a title with CP3 or Booker, but I don‚Äôt think that means they should let him walk and start from scratch trying to find another star to play with Booker and Ayton who are now going to be taking up a lot of cap space between the two of them."
If the reports are true about Lonzo Ball heading to Chicago either one of them are most likely going to be a backup but Alex has more experience playing with LeBron and AD.
"How Lonzo Ball is getting more $ than Fournier is beyond my comprehension, but I'm definitely ok with it."
"""The point guard that brought them to the finals,"" LMFAOOO. You're referring to the driver of a car on a fire veering through traffic as they roll down a hill with an empty tank buddy. The Buns best an injured Lakers, Nuggets, and Clippers, all teams that would've slaughtered them if they were not crippled. Chris Paul did not ""lead"" this team to the finals, he just stumbled into the finals because of an anomaly and will never, and I mean, never, get close ever again with the Buns. You're fucking pathetic, dude. Want an idea? Don't resign someone on a contract that will expire when he is FORTY YEARS OLD! I am not a GM and neither is your stupid ass, but I sure as hell would've dumped him and pursued one of the great guards in this off season, such as Lonzo Ball, who will no doubt prove to be more valuable in this upcoming contractual timeframe. You're one of the lowest IQ people I've ever argued with on this sub and that is really saying a lot."
"‚ÄúEasy just throw in this 3/$65 into the deal‚Äù is easier said than done.    They COULD have traded him as an asset or net neutral salary, but it would be more complex to do so and therefore reduce options.  And maybe it‚Äôs not seen as an asset at all next year and requires additional assets to move.   The team is absolutely better than last year. JV is a way better fit than Adam‚Äôs.  Graham and NAW are better than Bledsoe and Lonzo. Lonzo was way overrated. He‚Äôs not great defensively.  He‚Äôs a good off ball defender but gets beat a lot on ball.  He‚Äôs not a great passer.  He‚Äôs good at outlet passes but can‚Äôt run pick and roll. He can‚Äôt create offense for himself or anyone else.  On offense he just stands at the break. Graham is a much better shot creator and facilitator."
"Man you really buy into the ‚Äúteam targeting player‚Äù nonsense that‚Äôs built up by agents to increase their contract offers.  They had the cap space to sign Dinwiddie for way more than the wizards if they wanted to. You guys are also way overvaluing Lonzo. He‚Äôs a 3&amp;D player who thinks he‚Äôs Jason Kidd.  All said, currently they added Jonas Valenciunas, Devonte Graham, Tomas Satiransky and Garrett Temple while losing Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams.  May not be remarkable improvement but hard to say they‚Äôre not better. Adding JV and shedding Bledsoe is huge."
One of the best passers in the league?  Lonzo Ball?  Are you mental?
"I agree with the struggling to create and penetrate, but I disagree about him having a hard time making passes out. Really there's almost no pass he isn't capable of, he even makes passes off tip rebounds.    The problem is in man defense when there's nobody open he's useless with the ball in his hand. For example, PnR numbers with Steven Adams aren't bad but they're not great. With Zion though, they're through the roof. Lonzo fits the Bulls as PG because between Vucevic and Lavine somebody can create in half court off-ball. Both players also lack playmakng Lonzo has."
There is literally no way Lonzo Ball gets paid more than this guy. Like just why?
"Uhhh, I hate to break it to you but any team that spends 30m/year on Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso isn't competing for jack fucking shit."
I hear Lonzo Ball may have been available
"Yep, it's called free agency. Most players enter some form of it, and a lot of them leave for different teams. Find me a team that hasn't lost a Lonzo Ball level player to free agency."
Lonzo is good at 1v1 on ball defense but he‚Äôs trash as soon as he needs to get around a screen or make a switch. He made so many bone headed plays last year
"The infuriating thing is that he already has an step on lonzo. He has a plethora of options, mid range, attack the rim, pass the ball... And he does this shit"
"People did though, and that's why Luka wasn't a consensus #1 pick. People were weary of singing a guy who didn't have lots of athleticism at the guard position. That's been the knock on all the guys that have come from Europe for decades. Below I pasted the draft blurb from SI before the draft. Every article or draft guide pretty much parroted this same narrative about Luka.   A prodigious playmaker and basketball savant, Donƒçiƒá will be the most accomplished player in the draft bar none. He enters with an unprecedented r√©sum√© for a 19-year-old, having just led Madrid to a Euroleague title and winning Final Four MVP and also winning Eurobasket in 2017 with his native Slovenia. Though not a traditional point guard, Donƒçiƒá is comfortable with the ball in his hands, makes his teammates better as a passer and he reads the floor beyond his years. His outside shot can be inconsistent but his stroke is projectable enough. He may benefit from playing alongside a quicker, attack-minded guard, but his team will want to empower him as a playmaker to get the most out of him. He‚Äôll face an adjustment to the speed of NBA defenses, and it‚Äôs yet to be seen if his lack of elite explosiveness and burst will make things more difficult at the NBA level. It‚Äôs possible his average one-on-one creation ability limits his ceiling as a scorer, but his true value lies in other areas. Similar to the way teams viewed Lonzo Ball in last year‚Äôs draft, Donƒçiƒá should eventually become a valuable ball-moving engine who sets the tone for the rest of the team."
but the ball family fan are insane so they always find ways to blame there struggles on the coach. their was a post a few years ago (it probably got deleted that said lonzo should be the 1st option lol
"""Lonzo Ball, may I have this dance?""  ""No."""
"What if when it comes to perimeter players, scoring actually is that much more important than the things you described?  Well, being an elite fast break player is nice if that's actually true. It sounds like one of those things people say.   Pulls up transition stats, sorts by points made, ctrl + f Ball not found. Yeah, Lonzo is so elite that he can't even score as much as Edmond Sumner. Good call."

They're honestly pretty comparable value wise, Graham is a better scorer and marginally better overall on offense, but Lonzo is a better defender by a decent bit"
Can he be trusted to dribble the ball in the last 5 mins and create his own shot bc Lonzo can‚Äôt.
This false narrative that lonzo ball moves the needle on defense needs to die
Is he a better player than lonzo ball?
"Lakers players always get shit on. And I like Lonzo next to dynamic players like Zion and Lavine.  Plus, he's gonna develop in his half court aspect most likely, and he's already a good fast break player and shooter. Those 2 are good fits for him seeing as he doesn't have to orchestrate the offense entirely, he can give the ball up to Zach and Vuc or BI and Zion and play a bit off ball. If the build play at a high pace Lonzo will be very good."
Defensively a lot I think with him and Williams your defence should improve on man to man and overall level. Team defence is reliant on the coach but maybe now he has more to work with.   I know Lonzo is weak in the pick and roll but you can play make in the half court without it. He finds the open man all the time when there is seemingly none. Is very willing to move the ball. Overall I doubt he is a liability in the half court when you have Lavine on the team who is ball dominant anyways.   Also if he improves again this year like he did last year he is going to come into the season more refined again from what we saw this year.
"Holy fuck, $85 million to lonzo ball. Even 10 years ago this would seem insanely overpayed. NBA players get paid so freaking much now. Not saying players don‚Äôt deserve it but Jesus."
"Play a bigger role in a backcourt w/ Zach Lavine, Lonzo Ball, &amp; Cody White? Unless they run a lot of 3 guard line ups, Carusos not getting more than 20 mpg, barring major injuries. MLE is about right for that kind of back up, but its the same role he had in LA."
This has more comments than Lonzo Ball despite being announced two hours later. What a world.
"Lonzo Ball and a 1st for Graham, Satoransky, and a 2nd‚Ä¶dear god."
It took me way to ducking king to realize Galo meant Lonzo Ball and not Alonzo Mourning.   Bruh. I was sitting here thinking that man has a 20 year grudge.
How did the Bulls go from Jordan AND Pippen to Derrick Rose to Lonzo Ball?
Vuc Lonzo Ball and Lavine is not trying.
Is he related to Lonzo Ball
lol the first thing that happens when garpax leaves is giving 100M to Lonzo Ball and Alex Caruso. im sorry chicago
"Yeah I keep seeing people laughing at us for not getting a star and like... That was never an option lol. Lonzo Ball isn't a star. Lowry is old. I love him but he wanted 3 years/90 million. I mean, who were supposed to get?  I think the issue is the media always connects us to players every couple weeks and it's becoming clear they're either talking out of their ass or agents were just using our cap space as leverage."
"LaVine missed 13 of the last 18 games. We were 4-1 when he played and 5-8 when he didn't. Our biggest hole was PG, and we just added Lonzo Ball. Pat Williams will be in year 2, Thad is back, and a Lauri for DeRozan S&amp;T is still on the table.   Youre ignoring 95% of the context of this roster."
"It's actually a perfect fit. Good defender, good shooter, extra ball handler. Pairs will with Lonzo and LaVine."
He will mostly play in some combination with either Lavin or Lonzo or slide up to 3 in small-ball lineups.
"As a hockey fan, it blows my mind that Lonzo Ball makes almost double what Connor McDavid (best player in the NHL by far) $21.5 mil vs $12.5 mil"
the Alex Caruso/Lonzo Ball bromance continues
"Genuinely horrible contract. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck the Bulls are doing, but this ain‚Äôt it. Lavine needs someone who can handle the ball in the half court and can read screens, Lonzo has shown no capability of doing that. Genuinely think this will be one of the worst contracts in pro sports come a year or two. I would be absolutely shocked if they even sniff .500. Joke of a franchise."
"I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I expected more this evening. Lonzo Ball going from one lottery team to another, people signing with the same teams and Kyle Lowry going to a team that has a ceiling of a four seed."
"21 millions into Lonzo Ball, that's what they IMO should have done.   21 millions is probably a tiny bit too much for him, but it's not egregious.   21 millions of cap space scores exactly 0 buckets. And with the rumors of Zion not being happy with where the team is going, trying to keep flexibility for the future might not be the best of idea right now. If they end up losing Zion in a year or 2, it's 100% on them.   And even then, now what? Dinwiddie is the best option you have? And you'll probably have to pay him the same as Ball. With actually 0 garantee that he'll acutally come. Honestly I'd love to ear the logic they used, because I can't make sense of it."
"Bruh it's Lonzo Ball who tf cares if he wants to be there he isn't good enough to do anything about it, and the contract was very reasonable."
Why didn't the Pelicans match? I'm guessing Lonzo Ball communicated that he didn't want to come back.
Why would anyone sign Lonzo Ball?
Can't fault NO for not overpaying for Lonzo Ball.
Lmao ok so what is a realistic ball park for Lonzo? I‚Äôm seriously asking at this point. $10 mil? 15? Lol his contract is still moveable for any young team with a need for a PG which there always will be. Y‚Äôall tripping
"Not like he was playing point guard for us anyways. And he wasn‚Äôt going to suddenly start running halfcourt offenses for us because he still can‚Äôt attack the basket and I‚Äôm not so sure he‚Äôll ever be able to. We need a guard that can allow for Zion to play off ball some and not force him to run point the entire game. I think Lonzo on the Bulls makes more sense because Lavine does most of their ball handling. Lonzo is pretty much a 3 and D player (and I don‚Äôt think the defense as good as people make it out to be), not a true point guard"
"How is Lonzo Ball worth over $20,000,000 a year?"
I keep getting Londo Bell confused with Lonzo Ball and get confused why Gundams are in the NBA subreddit...
I would match it if I were the Pelicans. Not really sure where else they can go with the money they have. Better to let Lonzo actually run the point and give Zion a solid ball-handler who can shoot the three effectively and play defense fairly well. I would like to see what else the Pelicans can do to make it work around Zion. But Ball at the point is the type of player that fits well with him in my opinion.
"Right? I feel like half this sub still thinks he‚Äôs a bad shooter too. Dude is a good shooter, excellent passer, and an even better defender. On top of that, he‚Äôs young and potentially could get even better. $85million for four years is a great deal for the team and the player when it comes to The Bulls and Lonzo Ball."
&gt;Lonzo Ball S and T to CHI4 year/85 million  /thread.
Sounds like someone who hasn‚Äôt seen Lonzo ball play since his first year. Cannot believe you claimed other ppl don‚Äôt watch ball when you think this deal is a rip off
Holy Shit Lonzo Ball just got paid.
"This is Lonzo Ball. Not LaMelo. Sorry, to dampen your excitement"
"In the context of Lonzo Ball isn‚Äôt worth 21 million, it‚Äôs a lot."
"Well yeah it's obvious behind the scenes Lonzo wanted no part of New Orleans after the season ended, hard to make a call to trade lonzo in the middle of the season when Zion and BI like him and Lonzo up to that point had been publicly happy about being in New Orleans. We'll see what the pels can get after this sign and trade and that'll determine how much the loss of Ball really hurt us."
We had to overpay or the raps we‚Äôre gonna get him. Is Lonzo ball worth 21 mil no but if y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt give him that he wasn‚Äôt coming
They got the Czech Lonzo Ball
AKME: Lonzo Ball? Never heard of him until 5 minutes ago. Literally just called and asked for a job.
"So excited for Lonzo on the Bulls. While he can‚Äôt drive to the basket, we desperately need his playmaking and he is one of the better off-ball guard defenders in the league."
Ball of Lonzo think he nice
Lonzo Ball + Ben Simmons backcourt is gonna be sick!
Lonzo Bulls  Chicago Ball
"When comparing him to Dennis the only question is the ACL tear. Never said his only concern is his injury.   Also, in 2020 (Last time spence and dennis both played in the same season) Spence had a usage rate 4 points less than Dennis, when both of them shared the court with other ball dominant guards (CP3 and Kyrie). So that's not even true.   Who else on NOLA do you want with the ball in their hands, making plays if Lonzo is out to CHI?"
"If the Bulls get Lonzo, DRose, and DeMar, they should call the trio De Rose Ball."
Right? These low IQ Pelicans cry for months about Lonzo being allergic to the paint just to sign an overall worse guard who‚Äôs also allergic to the paint? Hahahahahaha and give up all that chemistry with Zion? Fucking idiots. Idc tho Pelicans deserve a shit deal and shit future if they‚Äôre not willing to give Lonzo Ball 20m. Hopefully Zion jumps ship out of that shithole soon too
Lonzo Ball is absolutely not a starter on playoff contending team. This contract is gonna suck for many years
IMO Melo would be the primary ball handler in the half court while they can both fly in transition. Then Lonzo would be able to be the second or even third ball handler behind Melo and Hayward.
"Lonzo is a secondary ball handler/playmaking wing type then he is a true guard. 6'6"", good length and defensive instincts too. I actually wouldn't mind that lineup seeing a good amount of run.  He's a lot closer to the ideation of Evan Turner/Warriors Andre Iguodala then he is Magic Johnson or Jason Kidd"
"I think your GM seems more competent than that, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much. Schroeder will probably get sign &amp; traded to some middle of the pack team that thinks he‚Äôs gonna put them over the hump. I don‚Äôt really see anyone offering him that money even in this weak FA class‚Ä¶ unless Chicago strikes out on Lonzo Ball"
"Also LaMelo and Lonzo Ball had it pretty tough. They had to grow up with LaVar as their father.  (/s, LaVar actually seems like a pretty good dad)"
