"Yeah, I'm curious too. Getting to the WCF with Enes Kanter and Al-Farouq Aminu as their frontcourt was huge.   I don't watch Blazers games, so to me, it looks like another year of unfortunate timing with injuries and Olshey bringing in bad talent (last year's Whiteside, this year Covington, who might just be the absolute worst player in the NBA on offense when you consider his contract and the fact that Olshey gave up a first for him), but maybe Coach Stotts isn't getting the most out of his guys."
Al-Farouq Aminu approves.
I used to spend my days playing 2k14 making nicknames with my brother  Goby Dick was one of them (for gobert)  I even made an all- wonka team:  Charlie Buckets (actual nickname for Villanueva) Mike DV (Mike Dunleavy) Farouq Assault (AL farouq aminu) Zach Randolph (z-Bo(regard) DJ Augustin (close to Augustus gloop)
"Three of these players are starters: Markelle Fultz, Evan Fournier, and Jonathan Isaac.  Three of these players are out indefinitely or until next season: Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac, and Al-Farouq Aminu.  Just depressing to watch."
"Yeah but we also went to the WCF finals with no Nurk though and most people would consider Robert Covington and Derick Jones Jr. better players than Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless (ask Heat fants) who they are replacing the roles of from that team, Gary Trent has also made a big jump this year, Melo is shooting 40% plus from 3, Rodney Hood is still working his way back into form but will be there by the postseason, CJ is playing the best basketball of his career (and its mostly by adding 5 or so 3 point attempts a game so its sustainable).  Last year Nurk was out until the bubble and then still with barely any conditioning coming back and the team had no Kanter or Hood or Covington or DJJ and it was pretty much Melo or Mario Herzonja on the wing.   There is a reason people view them as a bigger threat this year. Upgrading your best players from 4-8 and getting your 3rd best player back (eventually with Nurk, he's also not in his normal game shape yet)  Right now the team is still waiting on Nurk to get back to his usual self and still winning at a decent clip which will only keep going up as they play together more and as Hood gets back into form"

"we call that ""the Al-Farouq Aminu"""
"Derrick Jones Jr. has been tremendous for Portland this year without much of a jumper. Al Farouq Aminu has been a very impactful player for both us and Portland in the playoffs (granted he has managed to shoot better in the playoffs though on low volume). Shaun Livingston was great for the Warriors too. High IQ players who are good at defense will still be impactful players in the playoffs, especially one who can get to the line."
Al Farouq Aminu?
Al-Farouq Aminu?
Al farouq Aminu
"Al Farouq Aminu in NBA 2k13 was fucking GARBAGE. If you were drafted to the hornets he would be complete chucking ass his first year, then you'd have to rely on progs because for some reason his potential was ""volatile"" back then."

"It's complicated because to be honest, we're not a bad team on paper when healthy. The reason we always seem to get off to a hot start and then suddenly cool off is because all of a sudden our rotation gets decimated. We've just had shit luck in regards to freak injuries for like 4 years now, but I genuinely believe that we're one elite scorer from being a team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs when healthy sort of like the Bubble Heat. Assuming Fournier leaves this year via trade or free agency, a healthy Magic team has (guaranteed) Fultz, Isaac, Gordon, and Vucevic as starters, with Cole Anthony, Terrance Ross, Chuma Okeke, and Al-Farouq Aminu off the bench. That's a pretty good core, but obviously right now we're running MCW, Gary Clark, Dwayne Bacon and James Ennis. If we could get that elite scorer, we would be idiots to trade players like Vucevic and Gordon to tank.  You also have to remember that Orlando isn't gonna pull many big names through trades or free agency any time soon, as we haven't had any real success in a decade. Pretty much any offer we get for Vucevic would be a bad trade on our part for us. Unfortunately for Celtics fans, we're not trading Vuc for Romeo Langford, Payton Pritchard and a couple seconds.  Finally, right now the East is too wide open to tank. While Fultz and Isaac are gone, Gordon and Anthony should return, and Steve Clifford and our FO wouldn't commit to tanking unless we had no shot at the playoffs, and we're only a couple games out."
"Bro, they made the 3rd seed with Al-Farouq Aminu as the third best player. And that was the one year that Anthony Davis decided to do something on the pelicans, it was a fluke.   Without kd did russ even make it out of the first round? Yes, he had great counting stats and the media was all on his nuts but maybe go back and watch how Kareem and magic and big o talked about russ. They would know best and all seemed to agree that russ doesn't play winning basketball (in the nicest terms of course)"
"I'm going to ignore your first rule, and state that Al Farouq-Aminu is now the best ""Chief"" to ever play in the NBA."
the only Chief I root for is Al Farouq-Aminu
"Aye, Al-Farouq Aminu is a 39% 3 shooter in the post-season, lol."
"Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Goran Dragic, and Lamar Odom would’ve plunged us into mediocrity at the time.  The Clippers package included Gordon who didn’t play much in 2012, an old Chris Kaman, and a raw Al-Farouq Aminu which allowed us to suck and get AD and make us a slightly more attractive franchise"
It’s different until they play at a half court pace and Ben Simmons turns into Australian Al-Farouq Aminu
"The NBA owned a majority stake in the Hornets (before they changed their name to the Pelicans) franchise, so David Stern was the de facto owner. Dell Demps was the gm, and he made a trade with the Lakers that was absolutely terrible:  Lakers get: Chris Paul (26)  Hornets get: Lamar Odom (32), Kevin Martin (28), Luis Scola (31), Goran Dragic (25)  Rockets get: Pau Gasol (31)  David Stern thought this was an absolutely terrible trade and vetoed it.  He instead set up a trade with the Clippers:  Clippers get: Chris Paul  Hornets get: Eric Gordon (23), Al Farouq Aminu (21), Chris Kaman (29) and an unprotected first round pick from the Timberwolves.  In retrospect, the original Lakers trade wouldn't have been *that* bad for the Hornets because Dragic ended up being a good player, but at the time he wasnt seen as a lot. Stern felt like the Lakers trade was a very bad deal for a team about to enter a rebuild, and that since Demps is not authorized to make a trade without ownership approval, it was within his rights to veto the trade. Eric Gordon was the 7th overall pick in 2008, and Aminu was the 8th pick in 2010, so at the time they were seen as good prospects, and from a rebuilding perspective it was a much better trade for the Hornets."

Hakeem played for team USA (lol) and Giannis plays for Greece but in recent years Nigeria has been represented a lot with Josh Okogie and Al-Farouq Aminu as the most prominent ones.
"Of *course* Greg Oden would be much, much better than KD.  Because in that universe, Oden also grew 6 more inches and developed into a 45% three point shooter. And he had a magic power so he could always defend perfectly without fouling. And in that universe, Durant had the handles of Al-Farouq Aminu and the jumper of Michael Carter-Williams."
"like if anyone wants to complain about the CP3 stuff, really the only angle you can approach it from was that it was a bad trade.  &amp;#x200B;  Clippers package: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft, which was used to draft Austin Rivers. Upon the deal's   &amp;#x200B;  Lakers package: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  &amp;#x200B;  I wasn't really following at the time, but it seems like both packages weren't great. But i might favor the lakers package just for dragic."
"This is ancient history but the Chris Paul to the Lakers trade that David Stern vetoed would have been better than the package that New Orleans later got from the Clippers.  Clips trade: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a Minnesota 2012 first-round pick (#12 overall).  Lakers trade: Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, Lamar Odom, Goran Dragic, and a Knicks 2012 first-round pick (#16 overall).  Odom and Scola were past their primes, but both of them would later be traded for first round picks. Martin was a solid player and Dragic was probably the best player in either deal."
"Ive basically decided I think he should make an All NBA defense team dont care how many minutes he plays he's just that much better than everybody else.   The offensive stuff it's always going to be low. Whatever his %s are teams just arent going to guard him, he'll get the Al Farouq Aminu treatment even if he gets up to 35% nobody will care he'll get ignored and hurt your spacing. And he's just so limited offensively otherwise I think it'll always limit how much he can play and his ceiling. He does look a little bit better now driving and occasionally attacking a close out but overall its just ehh  This year for the playoffs I dont think he's really gonna play that much vs BKN. Like 12-15 min a night. You at some point just have to try to outscore the Nets rather than pretend like your going to do something to really slow them down."
lol and dame's shots are so easy. curry has had 2-3 all stars next to him for the past 5 years. curry is obviously the better shooter on all fronts but come on now i would like to see dame's percents when his 3rd best player is klay thompson instead of al-farouq aminu
The team that got fed up with Al Farouq Aminu and Moe Harkless because of how nobody ever guarded them will get fed up with Rondae before long.
"made the WCF with Enes Kanter, Al-farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless as his starting front court, that alone is a legendary coaching job"
"Ahh yes, cause a team consisting of Maurice Harkless and Al-Farouq Aminu as the starting forwards is a championship contender."
"The Lob City teams were always severely lacking in perimeter defense aside from Chris Paul. They could never find a 3&amp;D guy to fill out the starting lineup. Matt Barnes, Wes Johnson, past-prime Danny Granger, Al-Farouq Aminu were all sub-par."
He loved Al Farouq Aminu. I was surprised with the contract he gave him. I read some article that he's always been drawn to him because Neil drafted him in LA
"  DeAndre Jordan , George Hill , Jusuf Nurkic, Serge Ibaka, Pat Beverly, Montrezl Harrell ,  Steven Adams, Ricky Rubio, TJ Warren , Jeremy Lamb, Kevin Love, Thad Young,, Al Farouq Aminu, Tomas Satoransky, Gary Harris, Terrace Ross, Danillo Gallinari, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee, Terry Rozier, Harrison Barnes, Al Horford."
"As an honest Celtics fan, I think the most ruthless thing to do would be trading Jayson Tatum to the Bulls for Felicio, Satoransky, and Al-Farouq Aminu"
al farouq aminu to save dame
"YUCK!!!!!! Jimmy Butler RIDICULOUS 12 Points, 4-15 FG, 0-2 3PT, 1 Sweep Playoff Highlights vs Bucks | STARBUCKS AL-FAROUQ AMINU?? | FreeDawkins"

Portland was starting Enes Kanter and Al-Farouq Aminu lol
"And with playoff Rondo averaging 11/7/13 while Portland 3rd option was Al-Farouq Aminu. Just gotta ignore those facts for your narrative, right?"
who tf idolizes al farouq aminu
"The 5.1MM is a player option. He should decline it and negotiate a new contract, $40MM/3 year. He's better than Al Farouq Aminu, who did $30MM/3yr"
"No it was one of the first results when I googled ""Al Farouq Aminu gay""  It was one of the more tame ones."
Something tells me no matter how tall you are you wouldn’t be as good as Al Farouq Aminu lol
Maybe not but Moe harkless and al farouq aminu were starters for that team and they still made it that far

Dame for Al-Farouq Aminu
cant deny that its pretty fucking pathetic to lose to nigeria. the only nigerian player of any relevance is aminu al farouq. props to nigeria tho.
You have to know that Argentina was still playing 2004 gold team. And Nigeria has 1 nba player al farouq aminu  Like know your facts before you say anything. Of course they would blow them out back in 2016. But now Nigeria has 8 nba players
"This Nigeria team is different. When the US beat them by 80 in the 2012 Olympics, Nigeria had 1 current NBA player on its roster at the time (Al-Farouq Aminu). This current Nigeria team has 8 guys on NBA rosters along with 2 more who have been on one relatively recently.  Granted none of them are particularly good NBA players but still, just having that many guys with an NBA level talent on any team not the USA is definitely noteworthy. For some perspective, the 2016 Silver+Bronze squads had a combined 5 players in the NBA at the time. Granted those 5 are definitely better than the 8 Nigeria has now (Gasol/Rubio/Mirotic/Calderon/Jokic) but still. We can't overlook the boost in talent on Nigeria's roster. Should the US have still won prettyy comfortably given the difference in talent? Of course, but even then, we cant look at past results and expect something similar to happen now with how much more talented Nigeria is now."
"&gt; That was before Dragic was even that good lol. It would have been a disaster for the hornets.   Except that Dragic did become good, so it wouldn't have been a disaster for the Hornets. What *was* a disaster for the Hornets was the trade they actually made. Instead of getting a future All NBA and All Star player in Dragic, they got Eric Gordon, who proceeded to miss 173 games with injuries over his 5 years there, along with three underwhelming years of Al-Farouq Aminu, one underwhelming year of Chris Kaman, and the draft pick that became Austin Rivers, who was also quite bad while he was there.   They traded Chris Paul, an MVP candidate, for three totally underwhelming players and the rights to draft an underwhelming player. In retrospect I don't see how anyone can argue that they were better off with that package instead of the one that contained Goran Dragic, Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola and the 16th pick in the 2012 draft."
"His tenure with the Hornets/Pelicans was:  Year 1: 46 wins, took the 2-time defending champion Lakers to 6 in the first round; after season CP3 is traded away after a vetoed trade would have brought Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragic; instead the Hornets get Eric Gordon (the most despised player in New Orleans history), Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and a pick.  Year 2: Hornets finish last in the West with a roster where Marco Bellinelli and Greivis Vasquez lead the team in minutes. Gordon only plays 9 games. Hornets win the 1st overall pick and pick Anthony Davis.  Year 3: AD has an okay but not great rookie season, averaging 13.5 pts in 64 games. Minutes leaders are Vasquez and Ryan Anderson. Gordon misses half the season. Hornets finish with 27 wins. Pels trade their draft pick which ends up being Nerlins Noel for Jrue Holiday.  Year 4: They are now the Pelicans. I buy season tickets for $200/seat (seriously!). Jrue is injured after 34 games and misses the remainder of the season. AD has a break out season averaging 21 and 10, but also misses 15 games with injuries. Gordon misses 18 games. Ryan Anderson only plays 22 games. Hornets finish with 34 wins. Pelicans acquire Tyreke Evans in the offseason via trade.  Year 5: AD continues to improve to 24/10. Holiday misses half the season with an injury but the Pels still win 45 and grab the 8th seed, but are swept by the Warriors during their first championship run with Curry. Monty Williams is fired, and the Pelicans have made the playoffs only once since then."
I’m still followed on Twitter by al-farouq aminu if that counts for anything
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
I don't get why the whole growing up a Clipper fan thing is even controversial. Guy is from LA and said he grew up a Kobe fan and a Clipper fan. That was me and honestly more people in LA than you'd imagine. There were even stories of him being upset that the Clippers passed on him (I was too at the time - we took Al Farouq Aminu). And I'm pretty sure there were some times he mentioned it earlier in his Pacer days.   He signed an extension with the Thunder and apparently also agreed with the FO that if they could discuss trades if things didn't work out. I'm sure the Thunder were willing to agree to anything to get a guy of PG's caliber to sign a max extension with them after just losing KD. Well it didn't work out and he had an opportunity to come player for his hometown team. He mentions it after he gets traded and gets shit for that. It makes 0 sense.
There was a really good post on this subreddit of NBA players funny tweets before they had managers. Not sure if the album is still up but some OG tweets were KD wanting to drink Scarlett Johansson’s bath water and Al-Farouq Aminu with some homophobia.
"No way. If this is an ability that can be unleashed on command *every single game*, the ability to order up a block, a steal, a FT, an assist and a board in crunch time *without fail* is extremely valuable.  He couldn't be your max player because somebody still has to get buckets the other 46-47 minutes of the game, but those stats could potentially be a 6-8 point swing within the final few plays of the game. To do that night after night that could win you a dozen or more close games in a season.  If you need an example of the kind of impact that could have, look at Chicago's season. The Bulls lost 12 games by 5 points or less last season, and they missed the play-in by 2 games. Having Mr. 1/1/1/1/1 on their roster could've plausibly won them all 12 of those games, taking them from the 11 seed (31-41) to the 4 seed (43-19). You just don't play him the rest of the game, save his contributions for crunch time when he's a *guaranteed* contributor.  Al-Farouq Aminu just made $10m to play in 23 games and average just 4/5/2/1/0.5 without without any of the value of this crazy end of game situation. Mr. 1/1/1/1/1 would be worth at least $10-15m."
"If Dame wants out do the blazers blow it up completely?  Maybe the Blazers want young assets?  Disclaimer I realize this isn’t the best offer the blazers could get, but its just the best i think the Bulls can offer so i’m throwing it out there.  Bulls can offer:  Patrick Williams Coby White Troy Brown Jr Tomas Satoransky Al Farouq Aminu Future first?  Why the blazers do it:  Patrick Williams is a promising young player, a lotto pick and the 2nd youngest in the nba before the draft.  Star potential.  Coby is another player with star potential who may have been held back by playing next to Lavine.  TBJ is a sweetner as a decent young prospect and the rest are salary fillers   Why the Bulls do it: Sucks to trade Williams, but you can’t acquire superstars without giving up something.  Dame is a top pg in this league and you hope putting him next to Lavine and Vucevic is enough to become contenders.  You cut 4 mill salary with this move too so you can attempt to keep Thaddeus Young as a valuable glue guy and maybe re-sign Theis to become your starting PF."
"Hey Portland I’ll give you 2022, 2024, 2026, 2028 pick swaps, pick 38, 2025 and 2027 and 2029 firsts, Coby white, Thaddeus Young, Tomas Satoransky, Al Farouq Aminu, rights to Marko saminovic, and anything else?"
Don’t you forget Portland legend and 4 year starter Al Farouq Aminu!
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas – New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama – Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France – New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington – Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona – Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan – Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia – Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington – Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky – Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest – L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."

"Dame got double teamed and passed to Al Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless who proceeded to build an entire brick factory. I'm surprised his stats aren't worse from that series honestly, after watching it.  That being said, I agree that Kemba was injured."

"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
"Yeah, I got you. Maybe that’s what’s getting me. Raptors draft these guys and fans say they’re always the next Kawhi. OG Anunoby was/is supposed to be the next Kawhi. Scottie Barnes is supposed to be the next Kawhi. It seems like a cop out to suggest any NBA prospect with length and an unpolished offensive game is going to be Kawhi Leonard.  Before the draft analysts suggested if all went well for Kuminga he could have a game similar to Jaylen Brown and if they don’t go super well, Al Farouq Aminu. That tracks for me. Nothing in his game says Kawhi Leonard and no one was making that comparison until GSW drafted him."
That's just not true. Look at your top 3 scorers that series.  |Rk|Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MPG|PPG|RPG|APG|SPG|BPG| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|CJ McCollum|.519|.423|.769|38.9|25.3|2.0|3.5|1.3|0.3| |2|Damian Lillard|.352|.300|.882|40.6|18.5|4.5|4.8|1.3|0.0| |3|Al-Farouq Aminu|.519|.433|1.000|32.7|17.3|9.0|1.3|1.0|0.5|  CJ and Aminu both shoot 50 from the field and 40+ from 3. Dame's taking almost as many shots as CJ and shooting 35/30.

"Hahahah jesus christ did I get one of those ___ISGOAT twitter accounts here? I don't even know where to start.    &gt; his whole team was often hurt)  Yeah damn must be tough dealing with injuries  &gt; Was down 0-2 to the Clippers until CP3 &amp; Blake Griffin got hurt, then he basically won by default.  Literally just untrue(shocker).  Won game 3 with both CP3 and Blake, then CP3 went down in the 2nd half of the next game.  Btw we were starting Mason Plumlee, Al Faroq Aminu, and Mo Harkless   &gt; Then lost to the Warriors in 5 in the 2nd round, and never beat Curry in a game where Curry played (Dame was 1-2 vs the Dubs without Curry even playing)2017 - Swept in 1st round to Warriors. Still hasn't even beaten Curry in a game.  Yes god forbid he didn't do better starting Meyers Leonard, Mo Harkless, and AL farouq Aminu vs Steph Curry Klay Thompson Draymodn Green and Andre Iguodala   &gt; Swept in 1st round by.... AD &amp; the Pelicans. As a 3rd seed vs a 6 seed. When the Pels were missing their 2nd best player.  Got destroyed by Jrue/AD traps, this was the bad one.   &gt; Won in 1st round vs OKC, even though Westbrook &amp; PG aren't very good playoff performers it still was impressive. Credit to him.  Beat Paul George and Russell Westbrook with a center rotation of Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard and dropped 50 points and a game winner to send them home.   &gt; In 2nd round he barely squeaked by the baby Nuggets with CJ outplaying him half the time.  It's really pathetic how you try to characterize everything lmao.  Dame put up 25-6 and CJ put up 26-3 on the same efficienccy.  One of those guys gets doubled and draws the best defender.  And nice of you to ignore we were starting ENES KANTER vs Nikola Jokic.    &gt; Then got swept in the WCF vs the Warriors with no KD, blowing leads in every single one of them. Still hasn't beat Curry h2h in a single game btw, I'm noting this because it's crazy to me after realizing it.  ""With no KD"".  Yeah only left Curry, Klay, and Draymond vs Dame, CJ, and Meyers Leonard.  Fair battle! [Shocker chose to ignore he separated a rib in game 2](https://youtu.be/Nr4sFo16bNk?t=22)  &gt; Went off in the bubble that allowed his team to get healthy in the playoffs when they otherwise wouldn't  Yeah god forbid he carried a team starting Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside to the playoffs in the west lmao.  Stick Anthony Davis on that team and they win 20 games.    &gt;  Lost in 6 to the Nuggets missing their 2nd best player &amp; all their defensive guards.  ""All their defensive guards""? They were missing PJ dozier.  Unless you think Jamal Murray plays defense.  And Nuggets fans kept talking about how Facu would lock him up.  **Instead Lillard puts up 34 and 10 on 67% TS and 2 turnovers a game.  Read that again.  He outscored the MVP on better efficiency while doubling his assets and with less turnovers.**  All your list does is show how consistently Dame carries AWFUl teams to playoffs in the west, then plays significantly more talented competition"
Al-Farouq Aminu is 30?
"&gt; who funnily enough got a much better package from the Lakers trade for New Orleans in hindsight to what they actually received.  Let's not even get into this revisionist history nonsense. New Orleans wasn't even getting the second best player in the trade. Pau was going to Houston.  New Orleans was going to get Lamar Odom, who was out of the league almost immediately. Kevin Martin who was a perpetual loser and never played a meaningful NBA minute. Goran Dragic who at the time was a backup PG getting less than 20 minutes per game.   The best player they were getting was Luis Scola who was 30 years old.  Compare that to Eric Gordon, a young SG who could score but was hurt sometimes, Chris Kaman who was hurt but an ALL-STAR just a year prior, Al-Farouq Aminu who was the 8th pick the year before, and what became the 10th overall pick?  It's not even a discussion. Can't let Lakers fans rewrite history and pretend like they offered the better deal."
Al-Farouq Aminu is 30?
"I feel like it makes sense. Same draft as Al-Farouq Aminu, a month and a half older than Al-Farouq Aminu.  Edit: DeMarcus Cousins is 31 actually as today is his birthday."
I think his ability to put the ball on the floor is the difference from being just the average hyper-athletic swing man.  He won’t be a Wes Johnson/Al-Farouq Aminu.
"Al farouq aminu, Thad young, a first, and 2 seconds take it or leave it"
"Pigging backing off of you to say what I usually say when this topic is brought up. The Hornets made the better trade at the time. Tell me which trade set them up better.   The trade was so bad and absolutely not in the teams best interest. If that trade had been allowed we'd be hearing more about how the league is rigged than we already hear. It was so bad for a New Orleans organization that was being put up for sale. Arguably(I say absolutely) the best point guard for 2012 Knicks pick(not lottery, 16 pick), Kevin Martin(28 years old), Lamar Odom(32 years old), Luis Scola(31 years old), and Goran Dragic(25 years old). That's bad. That would be comparable the blazers trading Lillard for these current players: 2020 Brooklyn pick (not lottery, 16 in the draft), DeRozan(30), Anthony Tolliver(34), Thaddeus Young(31, the biggest stretch here I know), and Kris Dunn(25).   25 YEAR OLD CHRIS PAUL!!! for a scoring wing that plays little defense at the end of his prime, an extremely washed big who isn't really playing, an older vet who the game is passing and isn't a real difference maker on either end, and a young point guard who has shown some promise, but really has low value.  The return for Paul was better than that, though I'm still not a fan. 2010 first round pick (10), Eric Gordon(23 years old looking like a future star), Al-Farouq Aminu(21 years old), Chris Kaman(29 years old). Similar to trading for Brandon Ingram, Mikal Bridges, and Cody Zeller before last season started.   It's obvious which trade brought in better players and a better pick. It's not even close.   Note:up until this point, Dragic had a good playoff performance for the suns, but never really showed to be more than a bench PG/6th man at best. It would be like seeing Kris Dunn suddenly become a high quality starting PG.  Paul was an MVP candidate. Not just some all star."
They win the trade just because they got al-farouq aminu. Everything else is bonus
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15477852/al-farouq-aminu-portland-trail-blazers-says-write-homophobic-tweets-surfaced-twitter-feed  well there was this
Pops Mensah Bonsu DJ Mbenga Luc Richard Mbah a Moute Al Farouq Aminu Kyle Singler
"I wanted to see what I could get with the 2011-12 season: 7-59 Bobcats, 20-46 Wizards, 21-45 Hornets  PG = John Wall, Jarret Jack  SG = Eric Gordon, Jordan Crawford, Gerald Henderson  SF = Trevor Ariza, Al-Farouq Aminu, Corey Maggette  PF = Rashard Lewis, Boris Diaw  C = Javale McGee, Nene, Emeka Okafor  Is that team any good? No not really."
"I think they still had enough space after McDermott, it was taking back Thad Young and Al-Farouq Aminu in the DeRozan deal that took them out of the running for Collins (although I'm sure they had reason to believe Atlanta would match anyway, so why not go a direction that gets you a first and two seconds)"
They gave powell a lot of money to be another high scoring guard as if they haven’t had a good wing player al farouq aminu
"The 2018 “choke job” is really overblown to be honest. Getting swept by the Pelicans had much more to do with the Pelicans’ ability to double and triple team Dame because they had AD guarding the paint, and they knew that Moe Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the other Portland starters weren’t going to consistently hit threes. Dame did his best to make plays out of the half court traps, but his teammates let him down by missing shots.   On the Curry vs Dame thing, I’m not trying to say that Dame is a better player. My argument is that Dame’s playstyle and ability are more suited for a “carry job” situation, and that Curry is more of a ceiling raiser. I’m not sure if this is really even arguable, due to the difference in playoff qualification for the 2020 Blazers and 2021 Warriors with similarly-trash rosters. It’s also just the reality of the situation; Dame has had to carry rosters his whole career. He hasn’t had the luxury of playing with two or three other all stars as Curry has."
"Did it really end up being a worse trade though?  New Orleans would have gotten Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Goron Dragic, Luis Scola and the number 16 pick in the 2012 draft (turned into Royce White).  Martin and Scola were both good players, but Martin was 29 and Scola was over 30.  Not exactly good building blocks to start a rebuild after losing your superstar.  Odom seems like he was the center piece but he ended up falling apart after being traded from LA, so New Orleans dodged a bullet there.  Gragic would have been the best thing they got out of the trade.   Instead from the Clippers New Orleans got Chris Kaman (not a great center piece but better than Odom), Al Farouq Aminu (very young at the time, good prospect having been the 8th overall pick), Eric Gordon (young talented guard), and a Minnesota 2012 first round pick which ended up being number 10 (turned into Austin Rivers).   I would definitely rather have the clippers package if I was New Orleans, even with the hindsight of knowing that Dragic ended up being the best player in either package."
And Al-Farouq Aminu randomly making 8 mill
FA starts when Al Farouq Aminu decides where he wants to go
3 trades.  Lakers trade Schroder in each scenario.  Nuggets trade: Will Barton and PJ Rozier. Why- Nuggets get a sidekick pg to Murray.  Bulls trade: Thaddeus Young and Al Farouq Aminu. Why: Bring in a pg for that Bulls team.  Grizzlies trade: Eric Bledsoe and Jontay Porter. Why: provide Ja with another ball handler
Al-Farouq Aminu in the Portland WCF run Bubble Trent Jr
"Suns got through this year because LeBron/ AD/ Kawhi all got hurt in the playoffs (along with Klay), obviously maybe the Suns beat them all healthy but if you asked that to any serious expert at the start of the year, they probably take an LA team  Toronto got its title in a year KD and Klay got hurt  Shit the Warriors got a title against a Cavs team that lost two All-Stars in the playoffs   Not to mention Dame and CJ made the WCF without Nurk and starting Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless at the wings with Meyers Leonard and Kanter platooning center  If they are healthy and playing in a groove, on a team that is plus Larry Nance and Norman Powell, with a bench that plays better defense than Kanter and Melo, they could easily make a legitimate run  People act like winning a title is being able to put out the best team in 2k when in reality it is finding some elite players and trying to complement them as best you can, working to become an elite team that can compete with anyone and hoping everything falls your way one year  People had the same doubts about the Mavs the year they beat the Heatles, but the team gelled, Dirk put up an all time run, and they got the ring"
A bunch of just... really dumb tweets from the early days of twitter.  https://www.blazersedge.com/2016/5/1/11548554/al-farouq-aminu-twitter-anti-gay-lgbtq-tweets-portland-trail-blazers
[Al-Farouq Aminu](https://streamable.com/kqb2qg)
"I feel like he does. Portland has always had a huge problem with defense to the point where anyone who can remotely play defense on their roster instantly becomes a core part of their rotation. Al-Farouq Aminu was playing 30 minutes a game for them at one point, and it was popular at one point for Portland fans to have Nurk as the second best player on the team over CJ just because he elevated them to an average defensive team.   Ben's defense is in a different league from any of those players and if he can push them into the top half of the league on D that's much better than anything CJ brings for them"
Al-Farouq Aminu in Portland’s WCF run he was DRAINING 3s
Yea I don’t understand. People have a problem because it’s Africans. Not every African player receives this speculation. Al Farouq Aminu was never a subject to this. Hakeem wasn’t either.
"all they traded was   Thaddeus Young - honestly a solid player but the salary works out and Aminu has a player option next year   Al-Farouq Aminu - bad, salary filler in the Vuc trade and again in this trade  future first - 2025 is the earliest but it has some layover protection  2022 2nd (Lakers) - picks in the 50-60 range can be bought  2025 2nd (Bulls) - picks in the 45-60 range can be bought  and they got DeRozan and a spurs second"
yeah he’s no draft bust but definitely should’ve been drafted lower. is al-farouq aminu a draft bust because he was picked ahead of hayward and paul george?
Here's the comparison of what Hornets would have gotten  &amp;#x200B;  |Lakers|Clippers| |:-|:-| |Lamar Odom|Chris Kaman| |Goran Dragic|Eric Gordon| |Luis Scola|Al-Farouq Aminu| |Kevin Martin|2012 FRP (Austin Rivers)| ||2 2nd rounders|  How is the Clippers deal better?
&gt;Al-Farouq Aminu  wow...that's a name i haven't heard in ages
He also seems to have gone through a [little homophobia phase](https://www.outsports.com/2016/5/3/11584160/al-farouq-aminu-portland-trail-blazers-gay-tweets)
"Agreed that Aminu is a really nice dude! I met him when he was buying a house my friend used to rent. They told me ""some basketball player"" was going to buy the house for his mom and I happened to be over when the original owner brought him and his family to see the property. I was really surprised and excited when I saw Aminu walk in.  He was really soft spoken and just seemed like a kind gentle guy. This was maybe a year after he started with the blazers so not long after you met him. It was funny because I remember specifically thinking that his wife, who was of course much much smaller than him, felt like a much bigger presence in the room. She was in the driver's seat asking about all of the details of the house while Al-Farouq, his brother, and their mom just quietly followed her lead."
"I met Al-Farouq Aminu a few years ago when him and his wife were vacationing in Hawaii, super nice guy. It was just when he got traded from the Mavs to the Blazers and he walked into a fashion store I worked in and none of my coworkers cared about sports (like many people in my industry) but I instantly recognized him and approached him by saying ""Hello Mr. Aminu!"". I think he was a little surprised that someone in Hawaii actually knew who he is, he shook my hand, looks around the store and left."
"Everyone knew CP3 was being traded.    But instead of getting all-star Pau Gasol and 6MOY Lamar Odom from the Lakers, the Pelicans traded away CP3 to the Clippers for that amazing bounty of players of:  Al-Farouq Aminu   Eric Gordon   Chris Kaman   and a '12 1st round draft pick (Austin Rivers).  Yeah, I could see how the Pelicans were so much more attractive..."
"It would have been a 3 team trade between Houston, Lakers and New Orleans:  **Los Angeles Lakers: ** PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)  **New Orleans Hornets:** F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)  **Houston Rockets:** PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)   The trade with Clippers that was accepted:  **Los Angeles Clippers:** Chris Paul  **New Orleans Hornets:** Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and the Timberwolves’ unprotected pick in 2012 (ended up being 10th, Austin Rivers)  I’m not sure that was a better package. I kinda believe the story that other teams whined about Lakers getting their man again, and that is why Stern blocked it."
"&gt;the first trade really didn’t have any blossoming young talent, that’s what the Hornets needed, pieces for the future  Goran Dragic is still playing in the NBA today! He wasn't 22 but he + Kevin Martin + Luis Scola is a way better trade than Eric Gordon and Al Farouq Aminu. Eric Gordon was overhyped as hell, imagine Devin Booker before last season's playoffs. THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD OF A PLAYER AND YOU'RE TRADING AN MVP CANDIDATE.  Again, the injury concerns were also there."
"What the hell? No.  The trade for Chris Paul would've netted New Orleans...  1. Lamar Odom, after he played his best season and won 6th man of the year 2. Kevin Martin, a young 20 point scorer 3. Luis Scola, who was above average at PF 4. Goran Dragic, who was good enough to help lead the Suns to a 50 win team  Bro that's a near playoff team, add 1 mid tier lottery guy and the team is pretty good. Some of those guys were expiring contracts, which was ALSO good, because back then, a guy with an expiring contract was gold for teams that wanted to play in the Free Agent market.   Okay with that said, Stern vetoed that trade of multiple good players for...  Eric Gordon, who was constantly injured and had some injury concerns prior to the trade, also was mostly empty stats on the Clippers.   Al Farouq Aminu, a project player who was BAD when he was in New Orleans and made himself into a journeyman.  Chris Kaman, who was close to washed.  ABSOLUTE MADNESS -- THE ONLY ONE OF THESE PLAYERS TO MAKE AN ALL STAR TEAM AFTER THIS WAS IN THE OTHER FUCKING TRADE HE VETO'D."
"It doesn’t make sense because the team was sold after the trade happened, why would trading him to the lakers matter to the value if he already got traded when the team was sold? Kevin Martin was a 20ppg guy, gasol(to Houston) wasn’t not close to being done, Luis scola would give you 17ppg at least, Lamar Odom was a solid 15 ppg off the bench, dragic wasn’t dragic but he was ok. These players weren’t old and were really solid and probably would’ve made the Pelicans better. The clippers gave up Eric Gordon, Chris Camen and al farouq aminu and a pick, that doesn’t make the Pelicans more valuable. I think the lakers package is better and would’ve made the Pelicans better but the league felt otherwise. An nba team would’ve sold for a lot even in the early 2010s"
"What was that team:  Ish Smith,  James Johnson,  Al-Farouq Aminu,  Jeff Teague.  None of them have been stunners but all have had 10+ year basketball careers."
"I'm sorry I don't even know how to sit here and listen to a Laker fan talk about how Damian Lillard isn't a better player than Paul George ffs.  He has consistently lost to better TEAMS in the west.  It so happens that many of those teams went on to win the chip. We're not talking about one-on-one basketball here. Damian has thoroughly been let down by roster building and depth problems (injuries to starters) here throughout his entire career. To say Damian wasn't as good as Lebron or Steph is obvious. But you can't just leave it at that. Not only did he go up against teams with those players but those teams had on balance much better players than we did.  Last season Denver was missing Murray sure. But they still had Michael Porter Jr. and Aaron Gordon. Obviously Jokic was MVP. At every position they're a better team except starting PG.  Obviously vs the Lakers in 19-20 it was the weird bubble situation and we lost to Anthony Davis, LeBron James, etc. LeBron is obviously a better basketball player than maybe anyone on the planet ever when he tries. But take him out of the equation and you have better players at most of the other roster spots...and that doesn't really even matter when you have Anthony Davis AND LeBron.  18-19 was one of his losses to the Warriors after being exhausted and injured he had next to nothing left to carry our team further. And we went up against the fucking GSW with a healthy Steph, Klay, Dray. Shit, we made Kevon Looney look GOOD because we were left starting ENES KANTER at center with Nurk being injured (AGAIN). Yes, Steph is a better player than Damian, no argument there but the rest of the roster is again better at most every position. Klay is better than CJ, Dray better than Maurice Harkless or Al-Farouq Aminu. We got heavy minutes and production out of multiple guys who aren't even in the league anymore 2 years later ffs (Aminu and Meyers Leonard notably).  Could go all the way back through each series and point out how we lost to better teams. Damian might not be the best player in the series (though it could be argued that he was against Denver last year, even though we lost). But the fact remains that he is an incredible top All-NBA level talent that is consistently surrounded by scrubs and Neil Olshey's inability to build a complete team and bring in top level talent to surround him is why we keep losing to these other teams that have done just that for their respective stars. We haven't had a second all-star on the team since LMA left in 2015-16 offseason and outside of that we haven't even managed to put together solid consistent role players. It's a mess."
It was probably much harder to embarrass Lillard and CJ in the ISO than it was for AD to rack stats up on Al Farouq Aminu lol.
Woah how you not gonna include Al Farouq Aminu!?
Where’s Al Farouq-Aminu?
The Spurs just took on Al Farouq Aminu's $10M contract along with Thad Young with a protected first and some seconds to sign+trade DeMar DoRezan to the Bulls. The Spurs just cut Aminu yesterday. It happens all the time
"And like I said, Al Farouq Aminu.  The league also changes quickly where players who you thought were locks to stay put are now forcing their ways out. Being able to salary match just to get in discussions for guys like DeAndre Ayton and Ben Simmons is a plus. Perhaps you can find other teams to move Tucker to to get back picks to send out to the Suns and Sixers to help make trades work. It's always better to have these guys on your roster"
"Like I said, teams don't NEED Tucker. They just need the contract to match. Al Farouq Aminu had a $10M contract this season. The Spurs took him and Thad Young for DeMar DeRozan in a sign and trade. Then they cut Aminu.   Like if they want to make a run at someone in the $25M range in a S+T they could pair Lopez's expiring deal and someone like Tucker's contract together along with someone like Jordan Nwora (who you can try to spotlight this season to boost trade value) plus future picks."
No but Al Farouq Aminu is avaliable
[It’s referring to a time Aminu observed two gentleman riding a bike together](https://www.outsports.com/2016/5/3/11584160/al-farouq-aminu-portland-trail-blazers-gay-tweets)
"I didn’t actually offer my opinion on anything, I’m totally okay with saying Al-Farouq Aminu is washed but I felt like the dude I replied to was talking out of his ass. Speaking so authoritatively on a dude who nobody was REALLY paying attention to comes off as more unjustly arrogant than anything I said."
"I saw Al-Farouq Aminu  at a San Antonio grocery store yesterday. I told him  cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly"
What would the Lakers want from al Farouq aminu
"They are one of the tiniest markets out there that is trying to remain competitive during Pop's final years. It's not surprising that they haven't been able to fully rebuild since Kawhi screwed them back in 2018. Unlike other stars Kawhi really screwed over the Spurs by playing the injury card, demanding a trade and being clear that he would only play in LA.   Past 5 years they have gone from: team that is contending with prime Kawhi Leonard and all star LaMarcus Aldridge to rebuilding all while trying to stay competitive during Pops last few years.   They've never fully tanked and had the opportunity to draft a high lottery pick in the last 5 years, so judging them on not being able to draft a star in the 10-30th pick range is a bit of a stretch. Since 2016 they've won 67, 61, 47, 48 games and then 33 and 32 in the shortened seasons (about a 38 win season). It's hard to draft good talent when you are winning a lot of games, but even then the Spurs have done a great job at finding talent late in the draft, not just during Pop's early years but also in the last 5 years.   In the past 5 years they:   **2016**: Drafted Dejounte Murray at #29, he's blossomed into a great player, averaging 16/7/6 last year. Signed Bryn Forbes as an undrafted guy who has become a lethal 3PT shooter and highly coveted role player.   **2017**: Drafted Derrick White at #29, he just averaged 16/3/4 and has a decent 3PT shot. In a redraft he goes top 10 easily.   **2018**: Signed Drew Eubanks as an undrafted 2 way who has turned into a nice big who can play 10-15 mpg, traded a disgruntled Kawhi for DeRozan, Poeltl and a FRP, not a great trade, but if Toronto doesn't win a title that year, it goes down as an okay trade given the fact that Kawhi would've left that next offseason and Toronto would've lost their best player for nothing. They also drafted Lonnie Walker at #18, he's turned into an okay role player averaging 12 ppg last year. Then they traded DeRozan for another FRP, Thaddeus Young and Al-Farouq Aminu. Toronto got 1 year of Kawhi and a Cinderella run at a title, Spurs got 2 FRP, a starting C and PF and a 3 year rental on DeMar DeRozan. Again not a great trade but if Toronto loses in the ECF it IMO is a trade the Spurs won.   **2019**: Drafted Keldon Johnson at #29, he averaged 13/6/2 last year as a sophomore, great numbers for a near second round pick. Redraft he goes top 10.   **2020**: Drafted Devin Vassell at #11, he looked okay, averaged 6 ppg as a rookie and playing \~17 mpg. Could fizzle out, or could be a solid role player, hard to tell this early.  **2021**: Drafted Joshua Primo, time will tell if it's a good pick, Got Zach Collins and Doug McDermott for nothing,    For a small market team, that's trying to compete still and only drafting in the 20-30 range, they have done remarkably well. Continually drafting starter level players at the 29th pick is wild. If they don't think Samanic is a NBA talent they are probably right. He's a sub 28% 3PT shooter, poor rebounder, poor defender and showed no development. They've gone from imploding contender to young team with nice assets and a great shot at a top pick this year to build off. A 2-3 year rebuild is actually pretty great for a non LA/Miami/Brooklyn team."
I’d put Al-Farouq Aminu up there too. Dudes face looks like he had a bad reaction to a bee sting.
not to mention al-farouq aminu
Maxi Kleber and Royce O Neale are also being payed $9M… everyone keeps quoting that number like we’re not one cap-increase away from that being a taxpayer’s MLE  Al-Farouq Aminu made $9M just last year. like damn it’s not THAT much
  LeBron playing like Al Farouq Aminu right now
"I don't have a current one but as someone who lives in PDX and watches the Blazers it used to irritate me to no end when Al-Farouq Aminu would hold his followthrough on a 3-point attempt and let his guy leak out past him.  Like dude, it's not going in, don't fucking pose like you're Steph Curry.  Just run the fuck back on defense."
"Out of curiosity, I wanted to see exactly what return the Pels got in return, so I tried to follow the trades:  - **CP3**: Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, al-Farouq Aminu, 2012 Pick (Austin Rivers). Of these players, none re-signed with the Pels. Rivers was later traded along with Russ Smith for Quincy Pondexter (did not play for NOLA, due to injury) and a 2015 2nd (pick 56, Branden Dawson, traded to LAC for $$$). - **Anthony Davis**: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, the 4th overall pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), a 2021 protected first-round pick (did not convert), the right to swap 2023 first-round picks, a 2024 first-round pick, and cash    - **Ball** was sign-and-traded for Garrett Temple, Tomas Satoransky, a 2024 2nd, and cash.   - NOLA would flip the 4th pick in 2019 (DeAndre Hunter), for pick 8 (Jaxson Hayes), pick 17 (Nickeil Alexander-Walker) pick 35 (Didi Louzada) - as well as a protected 2020 pick, which did not appear to convert.  - Christian Wood was waived.  - **Jrue Holiday**: Return was Eric Bledsoe, 2025 &amp; 2027 first round picks, 2024 &amp; 2026 pick swap rights.  - Eric Bledsoe was later traded alongside Steven Adams, Ziaire Williams &amp; rights to Jared Butler in exchange for: Jonas Valančiūnas, and rights to Trey Murphy &amp; Brandon Boston.   - Brandon Boston would later be moved to the Clippers in exchange for Sacramento's 2022 second round pick (protected).   So in exchange for ""this crop"" the Pels got:    - Brandon Ingram - Garrett Temple - Tomas Satoransky - Jaxon Hayes - Nickeil Alexander-Walker - Didi Louzada - Jonas Valančiūnas - Trey Murphy  Draft picks picks picks:    - **From the AD trade**: LAL's 2024 first rounder, and right to swap 2023 first rounders. - **From the Jrue Holiday trade**: Milwaukee's 2025 &amp; 2027 firsts, right to swap 2024 &amp; 2026 firsts with Milwaukee, Sacramento's 2022 2nd round pick (protected). - **From the Lonzo Ball trade**: Chicago's 2024 2nd  Out of these, Ingram and Valančiūnas stand out, obviously - but Alexander-Walker is alright, and man that's a lot of firsts."
"We also missed Nurk and CJ for half of last year, in what world is having to start Kanter and use Melo for bench minutes not going to create a bad defense regardless of the coach?  Also last year Terry wanted an actual backup PG and Neil refused to bring one in wanting Ant to get those minutes, this year, we have DSJ in that role and it is allowing Ant to flourish along with the team  Neil gutted the roster after he WCF finals run and then hyped the team up like it was somehow a title contending roster and that turned a lot of the fans on Terry but it was absolutely Neils shit roster  After that WCF season the team lost Seth Curry, Mo Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, Evan Turner, Meyers Leonard (and then ten games into the next season Rodney Hood went down for the year)  and replaced those guys with: Hassan Whiteside, Mario Herzonjia, Anthony Tolliver, Nik Staukas, Kent Bazemore, Wenyen Garbiel and eventually Melo  and fans wanted to act like it was all on Terry and not on Neil, like c'mon"
"Dames never missed the playoffs, PG ran to go be second fiddle on a team that got blown up by a Dame 50 spot  Dame dragged a team starting Meyers Leonard, Al Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless to the conference finals   The suns are also a scrub team compared to prime warriors"
