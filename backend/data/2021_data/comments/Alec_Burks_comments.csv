"The late first round, second round and undrafted players have such a low chance of panning out that blaming a team for not picking them up is pointless.  Plus the warriors have been great at drafting and finding surprisingly productive players in the last decade (Glenn Robinson Jr, Alec Burks, Chriss being shockingly decent players as of one year ago while Paschall is better than 95% of second round picks and some of the people you listed).  They've just been hit by alot of injuries, no nba team has 15 players who can meaningfully contribute to a game/be hidden gems."
"Outgoing players: Marcus Morris, Bobby Portis, Mo Harkless, Daymean Dotson, Wayne Ellington  Incoming Players: Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel, Immanuel Quickley (rookie), Obi Toppin (rookie)"
"Yeah, and it was also mentioned how a lot of them were heartbroken to hear about GR3 and Alec Burks being traded right before a Brooklyn game and wondering why it wasn't DLo being traded instead."
Alec Burks should be so much better than what he is.
"Last season? Hell we still aren't doing him any favors. Our starting lineup has 3 other non-shooters in it. Hopefully IQ can develop consistency and earn Thib's trust, because just having Reggie Bullock or Alec Burks out there with Randle, Mitch, and Elf is the worst possible situation for RJ."
"I think he could actually work pretty well in place of conley with the current roster construction. Not saying he'd be better but It would work I think. When rubio was on the team mitchell was the only scorer and that was the problem, but now they have bojan and clarkson in place of guys like jae crowder and alec burks. At times their backcourt is weak on defense and gets torched by good guards, rubio would help beef up the defense and would have plenty of other scoring options. That being said I love conley and he's a great fit and a great guy."
"Alec Burks' missed a bunch of games due to injury, but has 24 FTM and 19 FGM"
I saw this and knew it means Alec Burks is playing again. He is very good at drawing contact in the paint.
ALEC BURKS SIGHTING
Alec burks averaging 20 as well
I looked at that list and you are right if you discount Alec Burks (3 games). Rozier at 19.9 currently.
"Yeah his back ups are/were Ricky Rubio, Jordan McLaughlin, Ky Bowman, Jordan Poole and Alec Burks and dspite that the offenses were better with those guys on the floor and Dlo on the bench, surely a sad coincidence"
Alec Burks
3rd Alec Burks 4th Mitchell Robinson of Immanuel Quickley (depending on the night tbh)
Alec Burks' health is gonna make or break Knicks season. They just look like a team that will challenge for the playoffs to me with another decent consistent bucket getter
For real we get scorched by guys like Alec Burks and Tyler Johnson regularly.
"Elfrid Payton, Ntilikina, Jared Harper, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullcock, Mo Harkless, Ignas Brazekdis, DSJ, Kevin Knox, Julius Randle, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Mitchell Robinson, Tah Gibson."
Alec Burks was dropping 20 a game and got injured
Does anyone else feel like our offense stagnates when Donovan becomes the primary handler with the second unit? I'm getting Alec Burks flashbacks of trying to add that to his game.
For anyone wondering:  **Lineups:**    [](/CLE)Cavaliers (5-7) | [](/NYK)Knicks (5-7) ---|---   D. Dotson |  Tyus Jones Isaac Okoro |  Dillon Brooks  Cedi Osman | Kyle Anderson Larry Nance | B.

"Utah's pretty good anytime they're picking outside the top 10. Stockton, Malone, Mark Eaton, Gobert, Mitchell, Millsap, Rodney Hood, Alec Burks, CJ Miles, Mo Williams and the GOAT Andrei Kirilenko are all late first or second rounders.  But inside the top 10 they have a hard time. Dominique Wilkins was the third pick but didn't want to be in Utah. Thurl Bailey was good at seven. Deron Williams was really good but they could have had CP3. Hayward was a good pick at 9 but they could have had PG13. Kanter was picked ahead of like 3 or 4 potential HOF players, and Exum was a gamble that made some sense but in retrospect was a waste of an opportunity when Marcus Smart and Julius Randle were the next two picks, and Jordan Clarkson - who the Jazz traded Exum for last season - was picked in the second round."
Alec Burks does a whole lot to create offense and is a legitimate floor spreader. The difference in our offense with and without him is pretty clear if you watch the games
"Granted, Burks, Ntilikina, and Toppin are ranked top 4 on the squad in 3P%. And the three of them have been out for weeks now. I imagine having three of your top floor spacers out would impact your offense quite a bit.   Also, Alec Burks had been playing incredible before he got hurt."
Oh damn the Knicks were missing Obi Toppin and Alec Burks? That changes everything
Is that a cross between alec burks and trey burke?
"You're missing some key points - Nerlens Noel just came back from injury, Alec Burks, Ntilikina, and Obi Toppin are also out. The bench is stretched super thin - that's why players are getting that heavy load."
Yo gues let alec burks go?!  wtf
"How much are the Knicks paying Alec Burks to put up 2018 Donovan Mitchell's stats?  Because the Sixers are literally one player away from challenging the Lakers, and he looks like he could have been that guy."
Yeah GR3 and Burks comes to mind (though I think Alec was doing alright in NY prior to his injury)
I love ballers like this guy. Seeing Alec Burks in Golden state wants me to see fellow baller style player Austin rivers to succeed as well
"Pretty good breakdown for your first watch. This seemed fun so I thought I'd piggy back and give my takes as someone who watched 90% of their games last year and all but the Raptors loss this year.   Knox - You're on the money offensively. He can't create and is often the cause for poor spacing. This year Thibs has simplified his role putting him in the corner as a release valve late in possessions or by letting him attack from the top left where he's at his best. He can shoot, drive and kick, or drive and finish from that spot. Anything else and he's lost. Decent fast break finisher. Defensively I would say he's actually improved a lot. He's been able keep his man in front on drives and has gotten way better at not fouling. He gets caught on switches and late close outs still but he's playable in the 4th now if he's hitting that corner 3.   Mitch - He's the anchor this year we all knew he could be. I can't overstate how happy I am with his play so far especially with Noel out the last 2 games. Staying out of foul trouble while still playing aggressive. He's figured it out.   RJ - On the money. His composure is amazing. He will bounce back. Always fills up the sheet in other ways. Defense much improved  Payton - On the money again. Happy with his recent play but he's not a long term answer.   Randle - Rough shooting game but did everything else again. Turnovers still a big problem and will be a liability if playoffs are where we go this year.  Defense more consistent, especially finishing possessions with rebounding. I was unhappy to see the 3pters today. He has reigned it in for the most part but too many jumpers today. The matchup was a big part of that. Yes, Randle gets at least 2 of his TO from moving screens a game. I hope Thibs fixes that quick   Bullock - Not much more to say about him. Good for a forced TO or two a game but Alec Burks should eat his minutes once he's back.   Finally your take on the matchup tonight is correct. Shot blockers will be a problem for us. Our strength is paint points throughout and opening up the offense late in games by forcing the defense to over collapse on every drive. You could tell Gobert was making it very difficult for us early but give our guys credit they kept going at him. I think RJ got blocked like 3 possessions in a row by him and kept trying. Gotta love it.  Last point I'll make you may not be aware of is we have a very short rotation right now. Alec Burks being a big one. He was our most reliable perimeter scorer and made things much easier on Randle. He got less doubles with Burks out there and an easy release valve for an assit when he was doubled. Also missing noel, toppin, dsj, and frank who will be in the rotation likely if healthy   TLDR: I love this team"
"Thibs is a really fucking good head coach that plays to his players strengths  Almost everybody on the team is having one of their best seasons ever, Austin Rivers is a fucking monster, Alec Burks was averaging 20 ppg before he got hurt, Elfrid Payton looks like an above average starting caliber point guard, even Mitchell Robinson has cut down on the fouls"
Alec Burks is their 2nd best player
"1) RJ Barrett  2) Julius Randle  3) Mitchell Robinson  4) Immanuel Quickley  5) Austin Rivers  6) Obi Toppin  7) Alec Burks/Kevin Knox (can’t decide)  Elfrid Payton is all yours, Seattle"
"Julius randle is playing like an all star, they have a better record than the nets, raptors, and bucks, and they’ve done it with injuries to obi toppin, immanuel quickley, and Alec burks."
"knicks have had a bunch of role guys injured like DSJ, ntilikina, alec burks (who specifically would get minutes from rj), obi toppin, and nerlons noel. think once most of them come back you’ll see RJ and randles minutes go down a little to a more reasonable number like it was the first game or two of season when everyone was healthy"
Can you imagine Hill and Alec Burks on the same team?
"I’m hoping Alec Burks can be that guy for us this year. Fuck around, average 17ppg and get traded for a 1st round pick come February"
Julius Randle- MVP  Mitchell Robinson- DPOY  RJ Barrett- MIP  IQ- ROTY  Alec Burks- 6 Man of the year  Austin Rivers- A bucket
Alec Burks was cooking off the bench too
Immanuel Quickley  RJ Barrett   Alec Burks  Julius Randle  Mitchell Robinson  although this squad might win a ring...
6th man  as long shot would be Josh Hart.. He is absolutely ball in in that role so far. Alec Burks too from Knicks
Alec Burks
Don't throw the Moose away he's like a budget Frank Kaminsky.  He also showed loyalty to the franchise a few years ago; when Presti decided to blow it up he had signed both Alec Burks and Mike which is all that they could do since they were hard-capped. They gave both of those guys the chance to sign elsewhere. Burks left and Mike stayed.
Kevin Knox + Alec Burks + Dallas 2023 (top 10 protected)
"Actually you know what... we’ll give you Alec burks, taj gibson, Obi toppin and Derrick Rose for Jamal Murray... deal?"
"Love the Alec nickname. The 3D chess move I want Rose to make is to trade Burks to the Pelicans. Strengthen the Mavs' best competition for the last play-in spot by giving them exactly what they need. Other than that, idk, this team has too much chemistry to fuck with. Odds are we end up out of the top-8, and honestly, the play-in anyway. No need to hard tank and risk fucking with a good thing."
"Craig Bolerjack on the Jazz loves saying ""HOU! DINI!"" for finessing difficult layups in - heard it most frequently with - [Alec Burks](https://youtu.be/B65TKP5dUow?t=139)"
Love me some Alec Burks
"I’m not writing off the Celtics, but to be fair, our 2nd best offensive player at the time might’ve been like Alec Burks lol"
Alec Burks ❤
naw man alec burks is just steph curry in disguise
1.Alec Burks  2.Alec Burks  3.Alec Burks  4. Alec Burks  5.Alec Burks
"Alec Burks wasn't about to let the final scoreboard look close, he cooked in the fourth."
HIGHLIGHTS:   - Breen forgetting KP existed. feels innocent but dammit i want to believe that was sly slander.   -  We saw a UFO (Unidentified French Object)  - Clyde genuinely thought Kyle Guy was a ball boy  - Quickley absolutely dominated   - Dap Master Theo got some play time  - Alec “don’t call me Alex” “Future firsts” Burks
Why the fuck is alec burks not missing
Like Paul Pierce with Alec Burks. Daaaamn yooouuuu Pierce!
Alec Burks with the great assist!
"Part of that is just how wildly inexperienced the team is.  A dude who averages 30 minutes a game and plays all 82 games would total 2460 minutes in an NBA season. Two such seasons would amount to 4920 minutes. In yesterday’s game, 7 of the Wolves top 9 minutes-getters have fewer minutes than that number. They consistently do not execute down the stretch. Turnovers, mixed up defensive coverages, silly fouls, etc. And it’s been that way for most of the season. Just compare who the Wolves had on the floor at the end of the game to the Knicks: Derrick Rose/Alec Burks — Reggie Bullock — RJ Barrett — Julius Randle — Taj Gibson. All but Barrett have eclipsed 5000 NBA minutes (most have doubled or tripled it). That experience really helps, especially when the game tightens up and execution errors are killers."
"The Core 4 sounds quaint and delusional at this point, but it was our first set of lottery picks that we “earned” in decades. Of the top of my head, I think Malone was our last.   They were: Rudy, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, and Enes Kanter.  Gorag Hoaghead could be included, but Tyronius The Lesser liked him.   God those were terrible years. Thankfully Q was hired to heal those wounds."
The players from that year who are still in the league:  Rudy Gobert  Derrick Favors  Gandalf Handlebars  Enes Kanter  Trey Burke  Alec Burks
"Trey Burke, Alec Burks, Gordon Hayward and Enes Kanter"
"Since someone already did the Atlantic, here's another fun one.  PG: Simmons   SG: Harden    SF: Alec Burks   PF:  Tatum   C: Siakam   Burks is there for his shooting as a wing,  Siakam has started quite a few games at Center (maybe technically cheating),  but between Siakam, tatum, and Simmons I think the switching and help defense would lessen the impact of not having a great rim protector.  Offensively,  Simmons can have a more definited role, rim running and short roll passes to shooters.  Harden and Tatum are primary shot creators, with Siakam creating a bit too.     Would be a really fun team to watch, fastbreaks would be crazy."
"Top five picks have approximately a 1-in-3 chance of becoming all-stars.  Utah's last 3 ""top-5"" picks were Exum, Kanter, &amp; Deron William's. So their scouting &amp; development of elite talent is average.   However, their ability to scout--then draft &amp; develop--late lottery &amp; draft/undrafted talent, or G-league talent, has been very good.   Aside from players on their own roster in this category (O'Neale, Ingles, Niang, Oni), they are also responsible for bringing many other players into the league still currently on rosters, &amp; who've had mulit-season NBA careers through these channels through the Utah Jazz organization, including:   Gordon Hayward  Rodney Hood   Alec Burks  Trey Lyles  DeMarre Carroll   Rayjon Tucker  Wes Matthews   Tony Bradley  Raul Neto  Paul Millsap.  There are likely more still playing, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head."
This is how I will forever feel about Paul Pierce's foul on Alec Burks.
Alec Burks
Alec Burks crosses over Kobe and meets 3 Lakers at the rim for the and-1  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMawKCtPAgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMawKCtPAgk)
"I agree. Rozier’s value is really high right now which may affect his trade value or availability. It’s gonna be hard right now. Though I think he’s the perfect player for the Bucks right now. Scary Terry playing for the Deer is a must watch.  DD’s value is still good considering his potential is not yet fully reached. Meanwhile, we’re gonna cashout Brook since he still has value. I think it’ll dip a little more next season.  Picks are not in the discussion. Considering we’re a buyer, the 2nd round is the best we can add. Brook is salary filler and Donte as the main piece  Timberwolves may wanna do it if they add picks. Probably throw in Pat instead of Brook. Minnesota will take it DD for Rubio alone imo.  Redick is a nice to have player but not the player we need as established  George Hill is a welcome addition but we’ve been there. I doubt they’ll give up DD for George Hill anyway. It’s gonna be a bunch of 2nd rounders at best. But doesn’t change the fact that they need a creator.  Alec Burks is nice. I think he’s good enough to crack into the final unit but it’s not something to be excited about."
"Didn't Graham just get hurt and scary terry's been playing pretty good lately so that might change his availability.  And I agree with you that milwaukee needs creator other than Giannis and even though it's a guard heavy league the availabile options and trade assets aren't the best divincenzo and Lopez are the two guys you mentioned As trade pieces.   divincenzo looks like he's going to be a above average wing defender and quality player  Lopez is 32 or 33 with after this year has two seasons left at 13 million per.  They gave away Three future first round picks in the holidays trade so there's no options for there.  And I don't think Lopez has value that other teams would be interested in and if he's a part of a trade it's to fill out salery  And you mentioned Rubio as a potential pick up but he's making 17 million and even if you give up D,D and Lopez it's around 14 million.  And we can't forget that minnesota has a bunch of 2 guard's on the roster so adding divincenzo doesn't improve the team.  One potential option is bringing back george hill he's in oklahoma playing for a team that's not trying to win games and I think has a 9 million dollar price tag.   And another option is to see what happens with veteran buyouts and try to pick someone up there you would think if you're a vet and want to go to a team headed to the playoffs the bucks are going to a destination for vets.   There's also been rumbling about them being interested in JJ Reddick and that doesn't help with playmaking late in game's.  Alec Burks is another name that the internet keeps linking to trades and he's a legitimate NBA player and can help a ton of team's but we both agree they need A playmaker that can take the pressure off Giannis late in game's.   I'm not sure how much they can do with what they have to make a trade that makes sense. And they're almost 2 million in the luxury tax  The options are a little slim."
"Tobias is a great answer for this, but I’m going Alec Burks. You need some scoring off the bench? I’ll put up 15 points. You need me to be a positive player and help the team? Sorry, I gotta put up these 15 points."
"The triple single stuff is funny because his assist numbers, even in the single digits, are always great. 7+ assists from a frontcourt player is phenomenal, and he even did that last year passing to guys like  Alec Burks and Dragan Bender."
"Bullock, Alec Burks, and Rivers (even though I want to keep him) are guys who could be sold at the deadline for 2nds or maybe a late 1st for Burks"
Alec Burks
"Kind of a quiet dude but I like Alec Burks. He won’t be the best, but he has game"
"you can't argue with these people, if the guy genuinely believes the timberwolves wouldn't have been comfortable with reggie bullock or alec burks taking the same contested stepback from 20ft then idk"
Some under the radar guys ... Alec Burks should get some rep too.   He’s been really good for the Knicks. Nick..Alexander on NO as well
Alec Burks!!
Alec burks is who JR Smith should be
Alec burks looks like when you skip customizing your 2k player
"Burks 6th man and in the best 5 of a Top 5 eastern team, yet he was waived from my Kings. .-. Okay, alec.  Shoutout to Rose, my favorite player when he was healthy."
"utah jazz 2011 draft. alec burks and enes Kanter. that couldve been klay and kawhi or klay and vucevic. I think kanter and burks couldve been really good, but kanter never comitted defensively amd burks hust never met his full potential. that draft reaches its full potential utah wouldve not had that dry period between the deron draft and donovon and rudy gelling together"

One time I got Alec Burks' canceled Dominos order in that building
THJ and Alec Burks deserve some love
"Dragic has been injured quite a bit. I'd give shouts to Alec Burks, Chris Boucher, Dario Saric and TJ McConnell"
Alec Burks in the body of Glenn Robinson III would be hella goated
Alec Burks ?
"Alec Burks is so poggerpilled, wish the Warrior would have kept him"
So... Alec Burks who had 20+ points in the last 5 games or so only played 13 minutes in this game?
"Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks"
Alec Burks is a lot better on offense than anybody knows
shoutout the knicks fan who tried to tell me alec burks was making a legitimate case for 6MOY over Clarkson
"Simmons was our only PG on the roster unless you want to count Raul Neto. We had to play Alec Burks 30 minutes a night. If you think that the Sixers still get swept if Ben Simmons doesn’t get hurt, you’re being irrational."
Alec Burks fucking torched us
"Weird one, but I swear at least half of Alec Burks' big games over the years have come against Portland."
Alec burks
Alec Burks draws a foul for running into Tobias lmao
Wiggins? LOL. I love how Wiggins is suddenly a great player now that he’s on the warriors. He’s been a minus player his whole career before he started playing with curry.   How many games is oubre worth over Alec burks or DLo? Probably zero.
Alec Burks who wants him
"Korver at 37 was traded to Utah for a second round pick + Alec Burks.  Ellington is a better player than Korver was, on a way better contract, I don't see how I'm a homer for saying he's worth something, a second round pick from a playoff team is nothing"
"I’ll just say fuck it and let Alec Burks and Thaddeus Young shoot all game. They’re the only guys that can create their own shots here. Add in Kennard being a good shooter, Bridges being a solid SF, and Adams being maybe the best player here, Team A wins by a lot."
Yeah trade machine lied to me then lol but Ntilikina Toppin and Alec Burks could potentially work then
"It's not necessarily tied to an elite defensive team at all, it's just very lineup and replacement reliant and it doesn't actually do anything to try and quantify what a player does defensively.   &gt;If individual defensive rating only about having an elite defensive team then why is Giannis ranked so high if his team is barely in the the top 10?  I mean using one example is just bizarre. I could easily ask you why the hell Rudy Gay and Patty Mills are the two best defenders in the league according to individual defensive rating? Does the fact that they're both on the same team not perhaps hint that maybe it isn't so ""individual"" after all? Why are Rudy gay, patty mills, Cameron johnson, Ty jerome, Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Shake Milton, and Kyle Kuzma all better defenders than Joel Embiid who is somehow 30th? Why does Rudy Gobert barely scrape into the top 10, despite clearly being the most impactful defender in the league? Why is DPOY candidate Myles Turner a whopping 64th!? Behind notable defensive studs Malik Monk and Duncan Robinson?  ""How do you reconcile that?""  Or is this argument only to rationalise voting LeBron James first because he's an amazing player who should have more MVPs? Just because he's had an incredible career, doesn't mean he should win again this year."

Remember when Alec Burks was on the Jazz he would constantly make absolutely crazy circus shot. Idk how he is now
"I don't want Oladipo at all. Dude's has 40/34/75 shooting splits (48 TS%). And no, that's not really an outlier for his career. The first all-star year was the outlier where he was efficient (58 TS%). Even his second all-star year he was well below league average (52 TS%).  He's not defender people think he is. He's not a ball handler that gets an offense running. He's one of the most inefficent guards in the league. He's not better than Alec Burks."
Ok. In my opinion Alec Burks is better than LeFraud James and its not even close
&gt;RJ getting hot is the only guy I'd say where he could be the better player in a game  Single game? Alec Burks. I swear he can give you 5 just as easily as he might go off for 25 on any given night.

"We are missing:  -	Mitchell Robinson: our best rebounder (both O and D) who sets the most significant box outs on the team  -	Alec Burks: secondary playmaker and big shot maker, especially in 4Q -	Immanuel Quickley: an offensive threat from every spot with infinite range, our main floor spacer   It’s easy to overlook because Julius, Rose, and RJ are healthy but those three guys have been a huge part of our success and not having them has as big an impact on us as much as a Schroeder, Caruso, or Bron has on the Lakers.   It would have been nice to see both teams go at it at full strength, but we got a good game anyway. At this point let’s hope for a Lakers Knicks Finals with our teams fully healthy so we can watch the slugfest over a series of games."
Alec Burks is very important to the team he's arguably the most clutch player
IQ and Burks… Alec Burks has literally won us games practically by himself in the 4th.  I think Quick leads/led the NBA in 4th Quarter points. They are the front end of our bench along with Rose.
We would’ve had better offensive flow if Alec Burks and IQ played… they allow Thibs to deploy Rose much more effectively.  Having him playing damn near 40 mins is wild.  GG Lakers tho
"my favorite player is Doncic. in pickup i’m alec burks- solid scorer, okay passer/defender, but if my shot isn’t falling i’m not doing much out there"
Bruh I swear Scott Brooks never makes adjustments especially on the pick and roll 😂 I remember when the Knicks played the Wiz and the Knicks ran P&amp;R down their throats in the fourth quarter. The wizards defenders kept going under the screens giving Alec Burks and others open mid range shots. The game was very close until the Knicks started abusing P&amp;R in the fourth and the Wiz never recovered.
"The problem with RJ is Thibs trusts like no one else at his position. Unless Alec Burks can get back into the rotation firmly, RJ’s just gonna be forced to play 42+ minutes every night. Which leads to mental lapses that we’ve seen from him.  The team needs to find a point guard in the offseason and it desperately needs to find a 2-way wing as well"
"We're generally pretty decent finishers as a team tho and we can only beat the team in front of us, which we did 3 times. We were also missing Alec Burks and Mitch Rob for that final one, who obviously aren't Trae but that's our best fourth quarter scorer + best C by wide margin"
Still love me some Alec Burks
alec burks?
Best teammate of Alec burks and worst teammate of Alec burks
How can you forget about the mister clutch king Alec Burks
Alec Burks
And Alec Burks
He Literally can play the Alec Burks role but start ( keep Burks though )
"He's getting the Alec Burks treatment. Also, he's old as shit"
Don't forget Alec Burks for 6MOY. He's been out recently but he has been awesome off the bench.
Alec Burks coming back is gonna be huge for us
"No particular order but Julius Randle, RJ Barrett, Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley, Reggie Bullock, Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel, Taj Gibson, and healthy Mitchell Robsinon."
"Very common in this sub to put players in 4 categories. Star, Role Player, prospect, washed. Every player in the NBA has a specific role. Even Marc Gasol has value in his role with the Lakers. Taj Gibson wasn’t on a roster to start the season and is vital to the Knicks. Alec Burks another guy looked past is playing incredible. All about team, fit, opportunity etc."
They need their equivalent of an Alec Burks
"Rose has been getting run at the end of games with Burks out. Knox usually only comes in on the last play, because he’s one of our best three point shooters but doesn’t do too much else.  Really, the reason why Rose doesn’t play at the end of games doesn’t have much to do with Rose. It’s because Alec Burks has been a clutch-time monster this year."
" Their over under is 38 1/2, knicks were at 22.  They added chris paul to a team that went 8-0 in the bubble and already have Booker and Ayton. The knicks added Alec Burks to a team not even invited to the bubble. Edit: and in the east, that's really bad."
"two guys are three of your best defenders one of the only guys we have that can create their own shot, the guy with the best shooting percentages in the league and one of our best scores off the bench that's wild. I didn't realize that Alec Burks was so good."
Probably Alec Burks
Alec Burks' dumbass getting covid when we need him
"&gt;a guy who a spotty handle, can’t finish inside, and has a knack for getting injured. No thanks.  &gt;Thad Young, Markannen, Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks."
&gt; possibly Lonzo for   &gt;a couple of 3&amp;D guys.  So just keep Lonzo...  &gt;I love the idea of Zo to Chicago for Thad Young and Markannen or to New York for Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks.  Jesus none of them play defense.
"What? No he’s not lol  If Zion and Ingram refuse to buckle in on the defensive end of the floor, then it won’t matter who builds the team or coaches it cause we’ll never go anywhere. Zion’s improved a lot, Ingram though....  I expect Griff to be super aggressive this offseason. I don’t think he envisioned Zion being THIS good THIS fast.   I think we’ll move Bledsoe and possibly Lonzo for a couple of 3&amp;D guys.   I love the idea of Zo to Chicago for Thad Young and Markannen or to New York for Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks."
Alec burks too
"&gt;What I’m saying is, his success is not reflective of the teams success unlike other star players. Embiid can get you 35 a game and you still get swept.  The only stars that could maybe win with the shit he dealt with last year are just better players, like kawhi, harden, bron.  Here are the sixers top 5 scorers from that series excluding embiid.  Jrich, 16.8 ppg on 52.4 ts%  Tobias, 15.8 ppg on 46.1 ts%  Shake, 14.5 ppg on 61.6 ts%  Alec burks, 10.5 ppg on 39.7 ts%  Al, 7 ppg on 49.9 ts%  This on top of the fact that they didn't have a pg.  Sure his style of play as a non ballhandler might be a little less conducive to winning but he still generated plenty of open shots for his teammates and they just couldn't knock them down. Even if he didn't generate any shots there's no excuse for someone like tobias to shoot as bad as he did.  If you think a team besides maybe the nets or lakers could beat the sixers with embiid averaging 35 then you're just straight up wrong."
"For sure, I think a lot of people saw CJ’s breakout coming, just didn’t expect it to be so rapid, following a relatively pedestrian second year.    But yeah, the potential was always there, he was a lottery pick for a reason. While the Duke upset gets a lot of attention, he was a beast from the jump. In 2010, he was named to the Sporting News NCAA All-Freshman Second Team. The first team featured John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Derrick Favors, Derrick Williams, and Xavier Henry. On the second team, CJ was joined by Kawhi Leonard, Hassan Whiteside, Alec Burks, and Elias Harris. Making that list was clearly a strong predictor of future success."
"This seems to be an abbaration.  RJ is around 30mpg for the most part.  Also didn't play much last game because Alec Burks was hot.  He was so hot, in fact, the NBA thought he had a fever and knocked him for health and safety protocol."
Fingers crossed! The Rose FO seems to be good at leveraging personal connections in free agency — I know Alec Burks signed in NY because of Johnnie Bryant
"This Roster is good enough to compete in the West. We had a WORST roster and was gunning for 8th seed. Luke doesn't know how to attack any weaknesses against the other squads and doesn't rotate things well. He is genuinely so bad as a coach he is detrimental to the whole team.   Look at the knicks, they added nerlens noel and Alec Burks and are now a top tier defensive team because of Thibs."
"Alec Burks was out but Thibs didn't give a fuck about replacing his minutes, just let RJ go on lmao. Thibs using young legs to their full advantage"
Alec Burks is the greatest player to ever pick up the rock. If Jesus came back as a basketball player.. he would be Alec Burks.   Alec Burks is basketball.
extremely necessary 4th quarter from him with 4th quarter GOAT Alec Burks out
Alec burks.
4th quarter Alec Burks is your favorite player's favorite player
4th quarter Alec Burks is my favorite player
Alec Burks deserves 6MOTY consideration
4th quarter Alec Burks is better than your favorite player
Alec Burks was such an amazing acquisition
"Ok and Bball Index’s estimated wins added metric has Tatum tied with Dame for fifth most wins added and behind only Jokic, Gobert, Steph, and Giannis.  Edit: Also going purely by this:  Conley &gt; Doncic  Conley and Fred VanVleet &gt;  CP3, Trae, and Zack LaVine  Above guys and Chris Boucher and Poeltl &gt; Mitchell, Tatum, and Beal  Above and Boban &gt; Lamelo   Above guys and Alec Burks and Patrick Beverly &gt; Booker"
"2016-2017 Jazz go from good 5 seed to Elite Team  Pg - George Hill, Raul Neto, Exum, Shelvin Mack  SG - Joe Johnson, Alec Burks, Rodney Hood  SF - Gordon Hayward, Joe Ingles  PF - Derrick Favors, Trey Lyles  C - Rudy Gobert, Boris Diaw  &amp;#x200B;  You'd have an elite scoring option in Joe Johnson, DPOY Gobert, Hayward before injury, Leader in 3Pt% Joe Ingles, and an elite slasher in George Hill. Plus, Burks/Hood/Ingles/Diaw becomes one of the best bench units in the NBA."
"Well.   As it turns out, much to the surprise of everyone on r/NBA, there are like five players on the Sixers’ bench more effective than playing Reggie Bullock, Rose and Alec Burks 35+ minutes a game."
"&gt;I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year.  Lol prices they fit within the MLE or the tax payers MLE are not “cheap”  &gt;Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  How many of those guys flat out sucked and ended up getting cut?  Rondo got what, 8M a year and then got traded for Lou Williams. Baynes sucked. Bradley sucked then got traded to Houston. Rivers sucked until what, a week ago? Didn’t the Knicks cut him or something? How many teams did he play for this year again?   Green? Didn’t he get the full MLE from Denver or close to it?  None of those guys are cheap. If you have to use the MLE to acquire someone, they aren’t cheap. Cheap means veteran minimum guys or ring chasers. Batum was actually cheap, Dwight was actually cheap.   Of all the players you mentioned, if they could be obtained for the minimum today I would imagine the Lakers would only have interest in Dwight, maybe Bradley again, maybe Rivers, definitely Batum. I want Batum badly and wanted him last year as well.   The others outperformed their contract and are guys that will go for the MLE.   We weren’t exactly desperate for a huge influx of cheap veterans last year and landed two minimum guys in Gasol and Matthews. I think this year we will be relying on it a bit more because we don’t have a pick to trade or that 15M contract moved in Green and we don’t have the non-tax payers MLE and are going to have to pay THT, Caruso and possibly bring Schroeder back if we don’t trade him, plus see if we want to bring back Matthews and Gasol again and I believe Morris is a FA again.   &gt;The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions.  Ah okay, I don’t know much about this upcoming FA class. We have AD, LeBron, Kuzma, KCP and Caruso as locks. I’ll pencil in THT and Morris as guys I think there’s a high chance of us bringing back. So you’re talking about needing to add two significant contributors. One of those will either be Schroeder or whatever we trade Schroeder for, the other will be whoever we use the tax payers MLE on.   So that’s 9 players. After that if you can add 2-3 minimum contract ring chasers to your team, I think you’re in a good spot. If we can come away with some combination of 2 of Batum, Dieng, Bradley, Howard and McGee and 1 of Gasol and Matthews, I think that’s fine.   Now I don’t even remember what we were talking about or what thread this is or why we’re talking about the Lakers."
"&gt; Who ever gets high value guys for cheap? You want ring chasing veterans, which is what we got last year, lol.  I’m gonna say cheap is around $6-8 mil a year. Under that, we have:  Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum (special case admittedly). Avery Bradley, Jeff Green, Austin Rivers, Dwight, Bryn Forbes, Alec Burks, Bobby Portis, DJ Augustine, Aaron Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.   $6 mil or under is everyone other than Augustine, Baynes, Jamychal Green, and Rondo.  All guys that were available last year. Obviously some of them were restricted, and most of them have outperformed those deals and will probably get slightly better ones next time around.   The list is even better this year, but a lot of it is young guys that are gonna get sizable deals/extensions."
I still love Alec Burks
"Dante Exum and Trey Burke aren't even included!  It was Kanter, Favors, Hayward and Alec Burks that was supposed to be the future star unit for the Jazz. Lol. Crazy how none of these guys ended up being the future, instead it was a late first round pick and a late lottery pick in 2017 after their supposed ""star"" in Hayward left in FA !"
Here comes ~~Austin Rivers~~ Alec Burks
I think a better Alec Burks is a good comparison just because of their jump shot form
"And with that logic, do you take Jordsn Clarkson or Alec burks over mikal bridges or ayton? Bridges and ayton aren’t really shot creators at this point in their careers whereas clarkson can create his own shot well"
Suns added Chris Paul and won 13 more games than their Vegas win total. Knicks added Alec Burks and won 19 more than theirs
"If the Suns were playoff rejects then what were the Knicks? Knicks didn't even get invited to the bubble and next year make a Top 4 seed. Suns went undefeated in the bubble then added CP3 in the offseason, the Knicks added Alec Burks and Nerlens Noel in the offseason"
"I'm sure most teams would love a guy like THJ, and probably pay him a bit more.  Some FAs they probably would go after to replace him would be like Danny Green, or maybe even Alec Burks, whose been really good at times for the Knicks."
"Are the Sixers going to be relying on Reggie Bullock, Alec Burks and Rose to play and defend 30-40 minutes per game each?"
"Yeah. The Hawks are going to realize pretty quickly the Sixers aren’t relying on Reggie Bullock, Rose and Alec Burks to play 30-40 minutes each."
"I bet he think like, if that shot went in my career would boom like Alec Burks"
Wasn't that Alec Burks for a hot minute in Utah.
"Do they really? Hawks players getting heavy overrated with recency bias after beating up on Knicks team that was relying on Alec Burks, Taj Gibson and Rose to even be competitive."
Alec Burks
This. He’s basically Alec Burks who may be better.
"It sucks for Alec Burks cause it's fun to watch him when he's cooking on offense, and he's a really nice guy, but he needs to be in a bench microwave role and not taking minutes from high-potential young guys.  Bullock is the kind of guy you want on your roster as well, but in less minutes than he's getting.    If Obi makes a leap next year it changes things for this roster quite a bit, especially with someone that cares more about running a modern offense than Thibs.  One thing about Thibs though, is that he teaches defense and effort as well as anyone, and will leave a foundation and culture in that area with these guys.  Warriors benefited quite a bit from Mark Jackson's tenure in that way as well, as bad as he was at implementing offense."
Not having a legit PG really hurts us come playoff time. Needs to be our upgrade this summer. Alec Burks ain't gonna cut it as the 4th quarter PG in the playoffs (and I like Burks).
"TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, Derrick Jones Jr., Alec Burks, Facundo Campazzo"
Fuck Alec Burks. How dare he stop running and let the defender hit him while he shoots. That’s not basketball
"Wtf Alec Burks and Aaron Aflalo look the same, shoot the same and play the same."
Alec Burks so nice!
"I’m telling u rn Alec burks is the new Jamal Crawford, they play the exact same way"
Alec Burks gotta fucking stop with this shitty hero ball for fuck's sake
"It's a well-written analysis but I don't really think I agree with everything. The only major mistakes I think he made was not trading our last couple firsts for veterans off the bench. I like Nesmith and Langford but trading for guys like Fournier or a shooter like Alec Burks were all moves that would've strengthened our bench and given us some much needed shooting. If they knew they would cut ties with Rozier and Morris before the offseason, then they should've been gone too that year.   That said, there's no confirmation that the Turner deal was even real under those terms, it was just a widely reported rumor that we never got any actual confirmation on. As for missing out on other stars, people like to think it's just super easy to send assets for Paul George or Jimmy Butler, but neither of those guys were winning us a championship. I don't think you made that point, but it's something others have said which baffles me. Ainge traded for a star in Kyrie when he saw the window and signed another one in Kemba, who plays well for us when healthy, but sadly just can't keep up anymore.   Most of our failings come down to sheer bad luck with the Hayward injury, Kyrie situation, and Kemba's injury luck. Ainge gave us quite a window with those assets and while I think he could've done a little more, we're still set up well for the future"
"He absolutely is. His career earnings are   Less than 100,000 in the G League  two years on 2 way contracts for the Lakers for at most 1 million total I believe  two years earning 2.75 million each on the Lakers  His career earnings are roughly 6.6 million in pure salary over 4 years. I won't compare him to rookie contract guys so for reference Alec Burks on the Knicks made 6 million just this year.  He just turned 27, this is the time to get that bag"
"I think we should maybe push the brakes on comparing Siakam's ability to..lead?..a roster of championship-level complementary starter and rotation pieces to the second round to Randle's ability to lead 32 yo D Rose, Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, 35 yo Taj Gibson, Reggie Bullocks and 1st and 2nd year players to the playoffs.  No offense meant to Siakam who is a great player and nothing even implied about the Siakam/Randle comparison itself in a more serious context - but this comparison makes absolutely no sense whatsoever."
This is what I was thinking for the past 2 games. Apart from sometimes when Alec Burks was attacking him I haven’t seen many moves targeting him. Really weird.
Alec Burks looks taller than Lebron to me
You know you’re in trouble when your second and third options are Alec Burks and Taj Gibson respectively. (1st option is Drose which is fine)
Max contract Bucket God Alec Burks
Alec Burks has been in the league for years he’s just a iso chuck artist who can draw fouls.
"I won't comment on the design but the personnel is lacking  It's why this Knicks team wasn't projected to make the playoffs and why it was so impressive they won the 4th seed. Great team play and team defense but a dearth of creators and shooters offensively  Rose is your MVP so far and really only he and Alec Burks have been able to create any movement or penetrate. Randle hasn't been able to adjust to the defense   Similar to how the Hawks need Hunter to develop to take another step, Knicks really need Barrett to become a go-to option"
Julius “6’8 Ewing” Randle tonight:  2-13 from the field 🔥🔥🔥 1-5 from three 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶 -15 + and -💪💪💪💪💪 31 Minutes 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ 2 Turnovers 🔒🔒🔒🔒🔒  King of New York??? NO SIR that would be Alec Burks!!!
Alec Burks with the dumbest transition three
"Hey, that's warriors legend Alec Burks"
"Dunno how the Knicks should feel about d rose, taj gibson, and alec burks being their biggest playoff competitors"
you're forgetting elite playoff sniper alec burks
"Kanter talked shit on his way out. That's why. He was loved when he was here, but when it was obvious Gobert was the future &amp; Utah traded Kanter away, he handled it like a little bitch &amp; took cheap shots at us.  Idk why?  He made way more money than he would have if Utah kept him &amp; sat him behind the obviously superior Rudy Gobert. But that's beside the point.   Point is, Jazz fans are intense &amp; very passionate about anyone  who ever makes the roster.   They'll love you no matter what for as long as u live, IF you rep for them, &amp; leave with class (see: Millsap, Alec Burks, Favors, Crowder, Neto, Matthews, Korver, AK47), but if you lie, cheat,  swindle or disrespect on your way out,  you'll never be forgiven (see: Hayward, Kanter, Trey Lyles, Mark Jackson, Derek Fisher, Raja Bell, Boozer)"
I love Alec Burks
"Maybe the Nets are just a real-life KOT4Q rebuild experiment, they just gotta get Alec Burks for the asset value and a dump truck of picks to Flip em for like Bam Adebayo"
"Imagine if 18 months ago I told you that Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, and Alec Burks would lead the Knicks to a playoff win. With help from a wing playing from Dayton and Nerlens Noel."
You already wasted an Alec Burks performance don’t waste a D Rose one now Knicks
Alec “Kobe Bryant” Burks
Never seen alec burks and michael jordan in the same room
ITS ALEC BURKS TIME
The Knicks are just one Alec Burks bucket away from the garden remembering that Atlanta really isn’t anything all that special just like themselves
"Just pathetic man. Where is the coaching? Our offense is stagnant, doesn't even seem like we are featuring our beat player anymore, and the only players who have played well this series haven't played at all tn.  WHERE IS ALEC BURKS"
Let Alec Burks iso every possession and see what happens.
"Yall fucked now Alec ""Prime Kobe"" Burks is in the game."
Alec Burks the real Knicks All Star is in.
Alec Burks gotta lead the come back again. Not much offense juice for the Knicks
"Just get Alec Burks in the game, he's clearly the Knicks' only hope"
By this logic Alec Burks should have done more since y'all lost game 1. Same with rose
I haven't seen a player get an entire city so shook for a loooong time. The Knicks subreddit is absolutely hilarious right now. The guy shot one more free throw than Alec fucking Burks for fucks sake.
"He says as Alec Burks shots one less FT on almost 10 less minutes lmao  But yeah, those are called make up fouls for Taj Gibsons moving screens all night long. Talk to him if you don't like it"
have you not seen or heard of Alec Burks?
he should tell alec burks that too.   also tell taj gibson he's a center in the nba not the nfl.
Bryn Forbes on Alec Burks timing
Bryn Forbes playing like Alec burks
Good thing Alec Burks is automatic for 27 each game 😇
Nobody wanted Livingston in the whole league. The Warriors got him back to being a key NBA player.  People thought McGee was done and was gonna be out of the league.  Alec Burks was a vet min cause nobody thought he had gas left in the tank. Warriors revitalized him too.  The FO has a good eye for diamonds in the rough and maximizing play from players that everyone else thinks can’t even ride the bench anymore.
It should have easily been either Rose or Alec Burks. Randle was not feeling it this game. The playoff atmosphere probably got to him but I think he would be fine in the next few games.
"I'm honestly not sure if I am getting whooshed right now due to how poor a take this is  &gt;Alec burks does that on the regular in the 4th quarter haha  Burks had 50% more points in the 4th quarter alone last night than his normal season average.  &gt;We don't need Burks to repeat bc we have other guys we rely on unlike the hawks who only can get meaningful contributions from Bogey and Trae  You're right, aside from the fact we have 9 guys averaging double digit points. You didn't even mention our second leading scorer (Collins)"
"&gt;Why are hawks fans so sure your gonna beat us? &gt;  Because your fans were talking too much shit. Talk shit get hit  &gt; You won by two points and our best player had an off game. &gt;  And Alec Burks had a once in a lifetime performance instead. Trae had a regular game and Gallinari, Hunter and Huerter had bad offensive nights. Talent wise the Hawks are just the better team and every expert agrees with it.   &gt;Hawks fans getting too confident don’t forget we spanked you all season long. &gt;  You mean you won twice against LP managed squad coupled with injuries and the third time we had full control of the game up until our best player got injured."
"You clearly don't watch the Knicks, Alec burks does that on the regular in the 4th quarter haha. We don't need Burks to repeat bc we have other guys we rely on unlike the hawks who only can get meaningful contributions from Bogey and Trae"
You clearly don't watch the Hawks if you think that was Trae's best game  Y'all also got the game of his life from Alec Burks. Id wager Trae repeats his game before Burks does
"&gt;If the refs let contact go like they did for the first 3.5 quarters of the game NY will win.  Kinda going to need Randle to step up more too, because I highly doubt Alec Burks is dropping 27 on \~75% shooting every game too"
"I only watched game 1, so I think that:  AD isn’t even top 100  Beal is the best player in the Series  Alec Burks is the best player on the Knicks  The Jazz are the worst team in the west"
Give us former Jazz musicians Alec Burks and Derrick Rose and we may consider.
&gt; Alec burks is Kobe  Indisputably
&gt;Alec burks is Kobe  Yes
"First of all, siakim is pretty good and definitely excelled when raptors won the finals.  Second, randle is good and one game doesn’t make a player. If that’s the case, then Alec burks is Kobe"
Alec Burks was amazing
"I was skeptical on how good of a playoff performer Trae would be, but he's definitely shown good signs in this game. Kept his composure throughout, was hitting the floater every time and still getting to the line even though calls are usually tighter in the playoffs. It helps that Rose was guarding him, who hasn't been good at defending him all year.   Knicks bench was absolutely spectacular today. Alec Burks played like a star and Quickly hit some big shots.  I have to mention the crowd. That shit was ELECTRIC. It was only 15,000 but it legitimately felt like 20,000+. I missed playoff atmosphere's so much."
I think LP took off his Randle jersey after the game and went to hurry up and buy an Alec Burks jersey

Alec burks
Brooks or Alec Burks who ya got for MVP next year
"It looked like they weren’t gonna be calling this but I noticed Alec Burks got one on it in the middle of the 4th. I said to myself if we are calling those, Trae is about to have a field day."
Is Alec burks a superstar? 27/3/4 on 69% In today’s game! I say yes!
He also tweeted out that he was super impressed by Alec Burks
He had one more ft attempt than Alec burks.
That was an awful loss. Pray Alec Burks drops 40 in the next game...
It looks the young Alec Burks in 2K actually. Buckets. Shooting that thang like Kobe.
Did you stop rooting for Alec Burks this game? Or IQ whenever he does the same pull-up-with-the-defender-trailing-hard-over-the-screen trick?
still lost even when alec burks and your bench goes off your bench isn’t going nuclear like that again 😭😭
Was it disgusting when Alec Burks got fouled twice in a row without getting touched?
" Teams who previously had Alec Burks watching the game be like: ""ALEC MF BURKS??!!"""
Alec Burks in the 4th Quarter has not been stopped all season.
We were so close to building an Alec Burks statue outside of MSG if they won
Randle was awful this game. Kudos to Alec Burks
Alec Burks leads the nba in % of points coming in the 4th quarter. So deal
Trae vs Alec Burks is the matchup we came for
Shoutout to Alec Burks. 27 points on 13 shots
"If Randle plays like his usual self I propose that Alec Burks follows suit, to make it fair."
That Celtics roster was still top to bottom better than the Sixers.  The Sixers had Alec Burks trying time create offense at PG
"Since the Pels have the right to match any offer, say Chicago or New York really wanted Lonzo and they sign him to an offer sheet.   The Pels could match the offer, and make a deal with Chicago/New York that would send Lonzo to either team and get something in return (could be Colby White and/or Thad Young, Reggie Bullock and Alec Burks, etc.)"
"It wouldn’t be everything. It’d be all the young guys.   I used tradeNBA quick, and the Knicks would still have plenty of money to sign a guy like DeMar DeRozen and a bench big like Daniel Theis, before they re-sign their RFA’s (Rose, Reggie Bullock, Nerlens Noel, and Alec Burks).   A starting lineup of:   Dame, Reggie Bullock, DeRozen, Randle, and Noel.   With a bench of:  Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Daniel Theis  Isn’t horrible. Dame, DeRozen, Randle, and Rose can all score and the rest of guys can create a pretty strong defense. Of course, the Knicks would have to have a good free agency, but getting Dame would probably help convince guys like DeRozen to sign."
"Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel"
"Dame, Reggie Bullock, FA (Maybe DeRozan?), Julius Randle, and Nerlens Noel wouldn’t be a harrible starting lineup. Especially with Derrick Rose and Alec Burks off the bench.   That’d leave the trailblazers with RJ Barrett, Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, Immanuel Quickley, and future picks which would be a decent offer all things considered. I’d rather have RJ Barrett than Ben Simmons.   The Knicks might even be able to hold onto one of Quickly or Toppin, depending on what other teams offer."
"If they're trying to go all in before Pop retires, trade Dejounte and Derrick to the Mavs for KP and a 2025 1st.   Then use your crazy cap space to try to sign one of CP3, Kyle Lowry, or Mike Conley. If you strike out on them, settle for someone who you know is just chasing the bag and a starting spot, like Dennis Schroeder or Spencer Dinwiddie.   Use your leftover money to add another quality starter, if possible, particularly a shooting guard. Maybe you can entice Oladipo with an overpay, or Kelly Oubre. If Josh Richardson opts out, maybe you get him.  Round out the bench with some vets.   Ideal lineup would be CP3/Oladipo/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Vassell, Justise Winslow, Otto Porter, Cody Zeller off the bench.   More likely scenario would be Schroeder/Vassell/Keldon/KP/Poeltl with something like Mills, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, James Johnson, Robin Lopez"
"Nets: The big three with prime Blake, DJ, Aldridge, healthy Spencer Dinwiddie, prime Jeff Green, Joe Harris Heat Tyler Johnson, Knicks Shumpert(if not waived), Thunder Andre Roberson(if not waived).  Clippers: Kawhi, PG, Boogie, Rondo, Ibaka, Batum, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Pat Bev, Zubac, Pistons Kennard, Mavericks Yogi Ferrell.

"Yes, the Knicks have been poorly run for a long time. But last season, Fiz started 4-18, was fired, and then the Knicks' G-League coach took over and posted a 17-27 record the rest of the season, with the same roster. If the blame was all on the Knicks and their roster construction, then there's no way Fiz has an 18% winning percentage and his replacement a 39% winning percentage.    Fiz says all the right things about coaching defense when talking to the press. But, like you, I also have no idea what his X's and O's are, because I didn't see any. The Knicks were the 26th-ranked defense in the NBA his one full season in NY. Tom Thibodeau took mostly the same roster from Fiz's last season and made them a top 3 NBA defense -- there was no drastic roster shakeup. The big additions were Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, Derrick Rose, and Immanuel Quickley.  I just think Fiz has some serious work ahead of him to rebuild his reputation."
"Danny Green to the Knicks along with Dame in a trade and DeMar as a free agent. Trading Barrett, Quickley, Toppin, Robinson and picks for Dame. Then bring back some of the role players on team-friendly deals:  Damian Lillard, Danny Green, DeMar DeRozan, Julius Randle, Nerlens Noel.   Luca Vildoza, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Kevin Knox, Taj Gibson."
"I am worried about the Knicks ruining their new team culture by trading guys away to try to get a star, especially one that doesn't fit perfectly, but a big sore spot for the Knicks was having only 2 guys trusted to guard small forwards (RJ and Reggie Bullock), and they were 2 of the only guys who would be trusted in the clutch to guard shooting guards. I don't want RJ to play 46+ minutes in back to back games ever again unless its conference finals or finals and overtime both times. I would be ok with the Knicks trading for Ben Simmons if they don't have to give up Randle, RJ, Reggie Bullock, or Immanuel Quickley. I think losing Derrick Rose would be unavoidable, he seems like the only one outside of those players the Sixers would actually want. If we get Alec Burks back, RJ keeps improving his 3pt shot, and Randle keeps shooting like a god, it might not be terrible spacing, at least not worse than with Frank Ntilikina (yes I know he shot like 40% from 3 this year but a lot of them were uncontested corner 3s in garbage time) or Elfrid Payton (as long as we forget the first 5 games of the season where he looked like discount MVP Westbrook)."
"Ibaka is a waste of salary for this team. Give me Taj Gibson for the vet min $2.4MM.   I'm gonna get wild with it and move it and move Jamal Murray to the 2 and add De'Aron Fox as a second max player.   Replacing Anunoby with Crowder for the salary savings.  Also, using 2021 salary figures.  PG: De'Aron Fox ($28MM)  SG: Jamal Murray ($29.5MM)  SF: Luguentz Dort($1.8MM)  PF: Jae Crowder($9.7MM)  C: Clint Capela($17MM)  G3:TJ McConnell ($3.5MM)  G4: Alec Burks ($6MM)  Wing3: Dorian Finney-Smith ($4MM)  Wing4: Nic Batum ($2.6MM)  C2: Taj Gibson($2.4MM)"
Seeing Alec Burks on that list is such a trip.
anyone else think that guy voicing the Infiniti commercial looks a bit like Alec Burks lmaoo
"We also did have a roster with Al Horford and Josh Richardson. Our best shooter was Shake Milton. Our best reserve (with Ben out, forcing us to slide Shake in his place) was Alec Burks. Last year’s team was GOD AWFUL compared to this year.  This comment isn’t really meant to be a further indictment of Ben, but even with him, we still likely lose in the first round. Just not in 4."
Lol Alec Burks is the Knicks closer
"Ben Simmons has real problems but I don’t think it’s a hot take to suggest he could add some value to a shake Milton, Josh Richardson, Alec Burks, Raul Neto rotation."
"I think there is a good chance you don’t make the playoffs next year. Pray you don’t give Randle a massive contract.   You rose to the top because other teams suffered more devastating injuries. Charlotte lost Melo and Hayward. Indy lost Turner and LeVert and Brogdon. Atlanta lost their entire team. Toronto didn’t even care this season and gave up halfway since every game they played was a road game.   And you played all your starters playoff minutes in the regular season.   So you rose to the top. You played Rose, Alec Burks and Bullock like 30-40+ minutes a game. Good teams don’t do that."
"The others just aren't talked about much. There's lots of guys that you just shrug and say ""seems fine...""  Will Barton, Alec Burks, Alex Caruso, Khem Birch, Torrey Craig, Gorgui Deng, Spencer Dinwiddie, Devonte Graham, JaMychal Green, Furkan Korkmaz"
"You know you guys can just look up a player with these stats right? It doesn't need to be a guessing game haha. It's definitely not hitting 15 mil though before even checking. RoCo is the closest off the top of my head and he topped out at 12m a year. And he's for sure been better than average on defense for most of his career. Alec Burks is also 10m and that's a new contract after a ""breakout"" year from him. He actually fits this description perfectly.  There are also more wings than any other available position so needing 5 doesn't really mean much, especially with the positionless type play we have now."
As a Knicks fan Alec Burks and bullock were so good for us last year. Great 3rd wings for any team
He will. Alec Burks misses a handful of games every year unfortunately and I doubt the Kemba will play back to backs. He’ll get some playing time
"Ah, missed that. That makes a huge difference. Still, as I noted to someone else here, a team with a lineup of Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole with Draymond playing the 6th most minutes on the team finished 26th in drtg. Doubtful that, with this coaching staff and Draymond healthy, we’d finish last in defensive rating."
"Dray played the 6th most minutes on the team in 2019-2020. Top 5 were: Eric Paschall, Glen Robinson 3, Damion Lee, Alec Burks, and rookie Jordan Poole. THAT TEAM WAS STILL NOT THE WORST DEFENSIVELY IN THE NBA. I don’t know how you could possibly bring up better evidence at how wrong you are. As long as Dray is playing on this team and we have the coaching staff we do, they won’t be last in the league in defensive rating."
"That’s not how trades work lol. We obviously have to send salary back in the form of probably Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, and Noel plus 3+ years worth of 1sts. Those guys are great culture fits for us. We’re not ready for this trade right now until either RJ is an all star and Kemba is healthy and balling."
"if you think the blazers are gonna kickstart a rebuild and ask for noel and alec burks but you would have pause about including any young somewhat proven assets, you are sniffing glue period end of sentence"
"some combo of:  Nerlens Noel, Alec Burks, RJ Barrett (maybe), Immanuel Quickley (maybe), Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson, any of our future picks, Miles McBride, Quinton Grimes, Jericho Sims  I don't think it beats the Sixers package if they offer Simmons + another player + picks"
They also gave alec burks 40 million dollars
"I’m not sure how you even prevent this, if you’re an agent there is only a finite amount of cap space and you have to get your guy his contract before it goes to someone else. Time is valuable, and if you don’t contact teams another agent will.  If Alec Burks didn’t get 3/30 from the Knicks in time, he easily could have fallen through the cracks and could be looking at the taxpayer MLE for one year or less now at 29."
"We just resigned Alec Burks for 3 years/ $30 million which I think is a nice deal. Offense in a bottle player, spark off the bench or spot starter, potentially one of your 5 on the floor in the closing minutes if the matchups are right or if you need him on the floor. Kind of similar to Schroeder in some ways. Honestly I think Schroeder is a little better, putting some of the personality or locker room chemistry stuff aside. His quickness and fearlessness going to the rim, nice finishing ability and ability to penetrate a defense or get things started off the pick and roll, are great assets. He can jump start an offense and keep things sustainable.   I would think ~12 million a year would be a nice value contract for a team to sign Schroeder, in a vacuum, ignoring the point guard market and who has openings I guess."
"10 million for Alec Burks is a great deal, good shot creator and 3 point shooter who plays good defense. U should be way more mad about the Nerlens Noel deal  Regardless we had a great offseason and we have team options on every contract"
Not a fan of the Alec Burks deal.
"Yes Randle struggled, but this was a only 5-game sample. It would be disingenuous to dismiss what he did and how he carried the team for 72 games during the reg. season as an All-NBA second team guy. Whereas with Ben Simmons, we’ve seen him struggle this every year the sixers face a decent team in the postseason. Also, some of his struggles really had to do with our team and how it’s constructed. A lot of those bad shots were shots he simply had to take because no one last year (other than DRose and maybe Alec Burks) could actually do anything off the dribble. That’s also another reason why y’all got away with double teaming him so much."
"Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Nerlens Noel.  That team would get a few wins against some starting lineups.  Its the Knicks, all day."
Alec Burks
Reggie Bullock got 3 years 30 mil. That's a shooter's value. And he actually is a solid defender. Alec Burks is getting 31 mil for 3 years. That's ballpark fair range for a shooter in today's NBA 10-13 mil a year
"Bruh, Reggie is not THJ with defense lol  THJ can create his own shot… Reggie takes more than two dribbles and that’s a sad possession. If anything THJ is just younger Alec Burks if we’re doing comparisons."

"I'm so jealous lmao I had to hype myself for Alec Burks, Patrick Patterson and Raymond Felton for years and then the Lakers do this in two days"
Where is Alec Burks making $10m/yr if he’s not in the NBA? Don’t you have summer reading to do?
Alec Burks lmao.  OP saw all the re-signings and thought they were new additions.
"Yup not gonna win in the playoffs if post injury DRose and Alec Burks are the only guys consistently getting it done on offense. They played their part, but need the main guys to step up."
Don’t disrespect Alec Burks like that… also I hear Taj is otw.
"He will not make 20m/yr below is reasoning  Here's 5 relatively similar free agent's deals today:  Tim Hardaway Jr 4/74m - better then Oubre and proven fit w/ DAL, older  Gary Trent Jr 3/54M - Trent is better, younger, and more potential  Will Barton 2/35M - ~even, but older then Oubre and injury prone, also specifically fits really well with DEN when healthy.  Alex Caruso 4/37M - Oubre is better and younger (Caruso 28 wow)  Alec Burks 3/30M -Oubre is better and younger  So for 25 year old inconsistent Oubre with seemingly more potential to unlock, and GSW isn't totally convinced he fits in that well...  Oubre will not be getting 20M/yr. I see the Warriors low balling with the full MLE (~9M) (he'd likely do a 1/1+1 deal to prove himself for a bigger deal), or the Spurs/Pelicans/Thunder (only teams with capspace) offering a 2/22-28M deal (12-14M/yr) or 2+1 player option."
"Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel, and Evan Fournier.  The $140mil in contracts the Knicks have given so far today"
"Alec burks is really solid man, perfect complimentary piece."
"why does Jeff Green get no respect?  for the money being given out, Jeff Green can't even get 10 mil a year?  alec burks got 3 yrs 30 mil"
How you gonna make less than Alec Burks lol
"Man got fleeced, Alec Burks got 30m for the same time and that deal was pretty solid for both sides. No way Payne's production was 11m less than Burks"
"I disagree  Knicks are at 27 mil in cap space, Alec Burks got exactly enough to be our MLE signing"
I like Alec Burks but that’s an overpay
"Woj finally got a break, and it’s Alec burks lmao"
WOJBOMB for the biggest news of the day. Shams couldn't get Alec Burks
"Get that bag, Jazz legend Alec Burks"
"Just for some extra context for teams who want ring chasing vets. The bolded players are starters. The defense of these players varies a lot sometimes just due to age. Quite a few unlikely to sign for the min.  &gt; Otto Porter - won't be making 28 million a year again but he ain't signing for the minimum   &gt; **Danny Green** - won't be cheap, already a 3x champion so winning isn't new to him  &gt; **Will Barton** - At 30 this may be his last big contract, gonna get the bag   &gt; **Trevor Ariza** in Miami   &gt; Tony Snell - DNP'd quite a bit in the playoffs  &gt; JaMychal Green - not signing for the minimum   &gt; **Jeff Green** - possible to get for minimum, already with Nets so any move not based on money would be odd   &gt; Alec Burks - unlikely to sign for minimum   &gt; Mike Scott - unusable in playoffs and probably not signing for minimum either   &gt; Reggie Bullock - should command over twice the minimum again, dude has made 19 million in his career so it would be odd for him to sacrifice a paycheck for    &gt; Maurice Harkless - voluntary signed with the Kings because they gave him more than the minimum. No one should expect a min unless he's desperate   &gt; Wesley Matthews - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks in playoffs   &gt; Wayne Ellington - likely available for the minimum   &gt; **Nicolas Batum** worth more than the min but may settle. Already has a nice spot with the Clippers  &gt; Carmelo - available for the minimum  &gt; Markieff Morris - available to re-sign with Lakers, was asscheeks"
"Not saying you're wrong but since I haven't seen a list, here are UFAs who more or less fit that description.   Otto Porter  Danny Green  Will Barton  Trevor Ariza  Tony Snell  JaMychal Green  Jeff Green  Alec Burks  Mike Scott  Reggie Bullock  Maurice Harkless  Wesley Matthews  Wayne Ellington  Nicolas Batum  Carmelo  Markieff Morris"
"Anyone else see similarities between Rockets and early 2010's Jazz in terms of the bigmen situation?   Usman Garuba 4 and Sengun 5.  Derrick Favors 4 and Enes Kanter 5.  Defensive 4 and offensive bigmen 5. I know this is a superficial comparison and not a comparison in playstyles (for example, I think Sengun fits the modern NBA better and Garuba is more developed then his stats suggest). The reason I bring this up is Christian Wood. Like Paul Millsap, he didn't really fit their timeline. With the Utah Jazz, those players didn't end up being as good as hoped (along with Trey Burke and Alec Burks) so they had to reroll the dice with new young core with Mitchel and Gobert which did work but it can work this time."
"D-Lo, Alec Burks and Damian Lee?  Also Beal is a vastly superior player.  Might not be the perfect fit but its gonna be fun as hell to watch as a fan."
"Raul Neto, Alec Burks"
Alec Burks has a ridic tape
"&gt;If it’s insane, then as previously stated it’s insane to expect that same guy to be able to perform for a team trying to make the playoffs in the western conference.  You’re contradicting yourself.   &gt;There core is Zion and Ingram and they’re still high on Kira, NAW and I’m sure would like to bring back Lonzo. Kispert’s skill set isn’t so unique that you have to grab him. Of course he would be on his rookie deal, but you’re also with the uncertainty that he may not work. It’s not like a shooter on the market is gonna be requesting max money.  Once again there is uncertainty that every single player to ever exist may not work. That is a flawed argument that makes completely 0 sense.   &gt;Of course other rookies have done it, but if you’re New Orleans in the western conference it’s incredibly unrealistic to expect that from Kispert his rookie year.   It’s unrealistic to expect a 4 year college player that was a good shooter to be a good shooter?   &gt;Again guys like Tatum, Mitchell were the exception.  Again when I brought up Tatum I was specifically highlighting his contribution to winning as a rookie. Not his post season play, not his stardom, not even him being a starter and playing 30 minutes a game. I literally put in parentheses “what they can provide to a team” because I knew it would be something you would take out of context like you just have.   &gt;Look at guys like Joe Harris who couldn’t hit a shot when Brooklyn needed him to last year in the playoffs.He’s a vet, a proven player, and was playing next to better players than Kispert would be in New Orleans and it just didn’t happen for him. Guys who’ve been in the league for a while come up short in those spots. Hoping rookie year Kispert won’t is a hell of a bet.  Joe Harris shot 40% from 3 on 7 attempts a game in the 2021 playoffs.    &gt;Bro Lonzo and Bledsoe started over him because they’re vets. He’s 23 years old.  Lonzo ball is 10 months older than Nickeil Alexander-Walker.    &gt;He can round into being an efficient player. NAW is a safer bet than Kispert is in being an effective high level player in the league.  Based on what? There’s a track record in the NBA of shooters sticking more than rotational creators.  &gt;I keep mentioning them because Kispert will never play ahead of Zion and Ingram, you know the wings in New Orleans?  1. For the 4th time, position-less basketball. you can place multiple guys in multiple spots on the floor a different times.   2. Ingram, and Zion aren’t each playing 48 minutes a game.   &gt;Gordon again is just a template. Go get for Fournier, Alec Burks, type guys I don’t care.   You keep saying they can simply just get these guys yet keep brining up terrible examples, which is once again directly proving my point to how hard it is to get shooter and where their value stands in this league. Evan Fournier got paid 17million last season, Alex burks got paid 6 million last year and was on a. 11 million a year contract before that.   &gt;There guys who anyone who regularly watches the sport would count on as quality role players next year Ingram and Zion over Kispert  Well yes, I too would count 2 veteran starters as good role players to put next to Ingram and Zion. The problems are ;  1. They are going to get PAID up to 4x the amount of money kispert will, annually.   2. They are free agents and have no reason whatsoever to go to New Orleans unless they are getting over paid (ie JJ Reddick), when they can get paid their market value and have similar roles on better teams or in better cities.   Your entire argument in this thread against Kispert to New Orleans is illogical, contradictive and baseless. We’re going in circles and I’m responding to the same points over and over. I’m done here, have a good day 👍🏾"

Lol we don't have super stars? What about Alec Burks?
"I don't have to look at it. I have a cap sheet with the whole league. I was only expanding it with an open mind to prove the point. The Kings/Knicks/Timberwolves tier of cap space teams literally are thirty million away, which isn't close or could get close.  It's absurdly far. It's a quarter of the cap. If I looked at it more, I would see the next closest is the Wizards and Rockets -- who are at the cap already. So no, there aren't more that could get close.   No one has gotten rid of $30 million in cap space in a single season and they certainly haven't done it in a cap environment like this one. It's never happened as far as I know. This summer and next aren't any comparison. It's way more limited. The Bulls just had to give up a first to dump Aminu and that's when there was way more cap room in the league.  Next season with no space and all of the cap space teams having a point guard, who in the league is taking on Derrick Rose for $14 million without a real first? And then when whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Nerlens Noel's 10 million for a first. And then whoever does that, that's one less team that can take on Alec Burks for 10 million, also probably for a first. These are negative value inflated contracts that the Knicks signed so they could use in a talent for talent trade.  The Knicks are hoping for Zion or Dame, but are going to three first rounders pre-emptively for the right to bid on Zach LaVine?  And please answer why it's in the Bulls best interest to take on $29 million to facilitate a sign and trade and get a bad first when if they let Zach walk, they could have $20 million and sell that space for a first.  Even in the situation where Zach is attempting to force a sign and trade, it'd make more sense to just let him go and use the flexibility for the same type of asset while not spending the same amount of money."
What is the trade value of these players:  Derick White  Kendrick Nunn  Delon Wright  Alec Burks  Eric Gordon
"From the Wolves perspective they got off a big albatross contract from a player that was never going to work for them. He's an above average starter who's probably best as a third option on a winning team but he's paid like a true star.   They also got to bring in a player who is very close friends with their franchise guy, KAT, and hopefully make him excited to stay a Timberwolf.   The Warriors had a huge, KD shaped hole on their roster and no way to replace him. In 2020 the Warriors were playing Damion Lee and Alec Burks on the wing and we saw how well that worked out. To flip KD into Wiggins was a huge boon for them as it will hopefully allow them to continue to compete.   Wiggins had his best shooting season last year and this year with even more shooting on the roster his looks should only get better along with having more open lanes for drives and cuts. But if the Warriors don't feel he's working out or they have an opportunity to upgrade his huge contract will become a positive asset in 2022, as it will then be an expiring contract.   And the final piece, the draft pick used to select Kuminga, is all about upside. He's quite athletic and has a high ceiling although he's very young and raw and will likely need some years to develop into whatever level of player he ends up being.   The Wolves on the other hand have drafted Ant, they have a lot of great offensive pieces, they've got pretty much all their own future draft picks, now they just to need to improve defensively and they can be a real playoff team.   Win/win."
Would knicks do rj Alec burks and 1-2 frp
Mine was Paul Pierce on Alec Burks. I will always wonder how good Burks could have been had he not been clotheslined like that.  https://youtu.be/Pu0etibOdho
"I'd say Cleveland as well. We've traded the following players one way or another:      Rodney Hood, Jae Crowder, George Hill, Dante Exum, Kyle Korver, Alec Burks and best of all Jordan Clarkson."
Alec burks
"Warriors have:  PG: D'Angelo Russell  SG: Alec Burks  SF: Harrison Barnes  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Chris Boucher  Honestly, better than I thought. That's a playoff team"
Alec Burks
"Alec Burks doesn't look like an all-star (or fringe) on paper but given more utility, I think that could change especially if you look at the year he played for Golden State."
"It’s just insane that the sixers don’t have a single guy on the roster who can just walk into a three, legit the few months of Alec Burks in 2019 is the only time I can remember in the last 5 years"
"**G:** Malcolm Brogdon  **G:** CJ McCollum  **F:** Tobias Harris   **F:** Serge Ibaka  **C:** Myles Turner  **Bench:** Lou Williams, Alec Burks, Terrence Ross, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic"
Alec Burks blindsided
Alec Burks is up there. Everything he does is in rhythm.
"&gt; Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  I don't see anything that makes Shamet better than Bullock.   How is he making more than 3x as much as Nic Batum (also not a rookie contract)? How is he making almost double what Patty Mills got (also not a rookie)?   Bryn Forbes was 4th in the entire NBA in 3pt% (45.2%) - better than Shamet has ever shot, including college - and signed for less than half of Shamet's amount (Forbes also isn't on a rookie deal).   Nothing against Waluigi, he got his money and good for him. But value-wise it makes zero sense to overpay for Shamet, who hasn't even shown he can be productive in PHX yet, while penny-pinching on far more valuable players who helped PHX win the West."
"Cap rises are really messing with people's sense of good/bad contracts. Current cap is $112M, while some teams are paying up to $180M. $10M/y is not much at all, just barely above the full non-taxpayer MLE. Also, in a couple of years, this contract should be fairly easily tradeable, regardless of Shamet's usefulness on the court.  This is also outside of the top 100 AAV, which kind of reflects where Shamet is as a player. He provides shooting, which is at a premium in today's NBA, and makes up the backend of a rotation. Maybe they could have negotiated him down to like 4yr/$36M, but then they risk losing him.  Non-rookie contracts in this price range (+/- 1M/year, from higher to lower) include: Devonte Graham, Dillon Brooks, Richuan Holmes, Dwight Powell, Reggie Jackson, (Shamet here), THT, Alec Burks, Reggie Bullock, Danny Green, (below this are the full MLE guys)  For a career backup, this is around the range you'd expect. Probably the argument here is for Shamet to be paid more like Monte Morris 3yr/$27M, Alex Caruso 4yr/$37M, Royce O'Neale 4yr/$36M, Daniel Theis 4yr/$36M, but perhaps the Suns were worried about losing some shooting at a position they aren't super deep at (with only CP3, Booker, Cam Payne, and Elfrid Payton as the other dedicated guards)."
"Javale McGee, Marquesse Chriss, Alec Burks"
I remember when he agreed with a deal with OKC and then backed out.  Alec Burks did something similar.  Not a huge deal but weird it happened twice with guys with such similar last names.
"I thought the core of Tre Burke, Alec Burks, Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors, and Enes Lantern was gonna win us a chip....  Oops"
Alec burks will randomly go off and give you like 25
"Eric Gordon looked like he could be an all-star early in his career. He's been a servicable roleplayer since but really thought he'd have more of a Bradley Beal career arc.   Alec Burks was someone I thought would be a 20ppg guy too that looked promising early in Utah but then like a lot of guys being brought up here, just got mad injuries and never quite got back on track to develop into more than a spark plug scorer type."
Fantasy friendship ended with MPJ  Alec Burks is my new best friend
"If you don't love Alec Burks and Patty Mills, I dont like you"
Warriors legend Alec Burks
Alec Burks&gt;&gt;&gt;Kemba

"I can't believe Alec Burks was the one to come out of that weird D-Rose, Kemba PG situation as the starter lol."
I forgot Alec Burks is still in the league.
Imagine Alec Burks and Seth Curry on that team right now.
"LeBron will save them by using back-channel bribery to trade Westbrook for Alec Burks, Immanuel Quickley and Julius Randle. After that he'll send AD back to the Pelicans for Valanciunas and BI (which NO will agree to because Griff has the IQ of an eggplant). If those deals somehow fall through, he'll trade himself to Cleveland for Love and Sexton."
&gt;1. Jonas Valanciunas - 51.7% (58 total attempts) 2. Patty Mills - 50% (128 total attempts) 3. Joe Harris - 46.6% (88 total attempts) 4. Alec Burks - 45.1% (91 total attempts) 5.

Doug McDermott - 43.9% (57 attempts) 10. Nic Batum - 43.8% (73 attempts)  Only person who's shot less than Valanciunas is McDermott.
I think one of the dumber things the sixers have done in recent years that flew under the radar was acquiring alec burks from the warriors and completely misusing him and then not retaining him. He's a perfect fit for pretty much any team.
Alec Burks
It’s kind of crazy how competent Alec Burks is at PG after mostly being a scoring focused SG his entire career
"Unfortunate but Quickley has been better, and Rose when healthy. Alec Burks at PG somehow works but I hope IQ gets some runs as a starter."
I'm actually more surprised that Alec Burks is considered a PG??
"Benching Kemba in favor of Alec Burks, I could not have predicted this ever."
ey show some respect for 4th Quarter MVP Alec Burks yoo
Losing your starting spot to Alec Burks is tough
I remember when everyone was killing Jordan for not giving him the max… now Alec Burks beat him out.
Crazy that he is getting pulled out of the rotation for Alec Burks. 4 years ago he was making a push for top 3 PG in the game
"* We are a better team without Kemba Walker playing  * I love how the lineups were staggered, RJ plays so much better in a fast paced offense like the bench runs  * Quickley’s defense and playmaking are starting to catch up to his shooting and he may end up being the best point guard on the roster soon  * Alec Burks is a weapon off the bench  * Obi Toppin may be the most energetic big man I’ve ever watched, and one of the best in-game dunkers too  * Quentin Grimes is gonna be a very good 3 and D guy, and Jericho Sims is gonna be a decent rim running center, our draft is looking very nice this year considering where these guys were picked  * Julius Randle is in his own head on offense sometimes, but he played very well defensively and his passing was very important. If he could just play with the energy that our bench does and let the game come to him instead of forcing offense through the low post, he’d be playing so much better"

Alec Burks over herro or harden
We are ROBBING Alec Burks at $10 million a year. He could have a case for 6MOY if he’s on a  team without Derrick Rose (rightfully) providing most of the offense off the bench
ALEC. BURKS.
Knicks Legend Alec Burks  &amp;#x200B;  Also fantastic defense tonight
Alec burks turned into a god for a couple minutes at least
"Alec ""Steph Curry"" Burks"
The knicks dealt with their fair share of covid and injury issues too. derrick rose and alec burks missed time with covid. Mitchell Robinson their starting center missed the majority of the season.
Alec Burks / D Rose
Alec Burks is a finished porduct. THT is not.
"Alec Burks is much better, fwiw"
&gt; and in turn get a big extension if he wasn’t on the lakers  He absolutely gets around 10 million a year from someone.  Do people think he's on a max contract?  He's getting paid the same as Mason Plumlee and Alec Burks.
Alec Burks iso actually working
Warriors Legend Alec Burks
The LA Lakers can't stop Alec Burks
Alec Burks is cooking the Lakers my goodness that was disrespectful
You don’t simply “guard” Alec Burks
I don’t know how Alec Burks isn’t on your Mount Rushmore
Alec mf Burks
Alec Burks the GOAT chucker getting all the shots he wanted as a starter
"That is truly the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. You ride the guys that are in form. Fournier was so bad that he was legitimately losing us massive leads and contributing to major fourth quarter collapses. You don’t let a player like that keep doing damage, you bench them in favour of better players until a point in time where they find their touch again. You can’t honestly tell me that you think it was smarter to send in 1/7 FGA Fournier in the fourth over Alec Burks after Burks literally won us the game yesterday"
"Because he’s not performing in them. I don’t see how that’s difficult to understand.  Fournier was getting time to close out but was playing like absolute shit, so he’s been getting benched. The player that replaced him, Alec Burks, has been playing extremely well. Why would Fournier then get the opportunity to close games?"
ok come on its not our fault that steph possessed Alec Burks in the 4th

"I don't think so.  I think it just gets easier to mix things up the longer you watch.  Your point of reference just becomes bigger and bigger, more and more new players are coming in every year, and somehow Alec Burks has played for the Jazz, Cavs, Kings, Warriors, Sixers, and Knicks within the last 3 years."
"Alec Burks was only +1 in the game.   Houston had their two best players tonight, KJ Martin JR and Alperen Sengun on the bench to close out the game.   Silas was the best player for the Knicks tonight."
alec burks 5 steals 👀
Alec Burks is the king of random 20pt games
Alec Burks did play like prime MJ tho
"We had to have Alec Burks save us against you guys, I wouldn't feel too bad"
This Knicks win was much more about Sengun and KMJ not being in to close out the game than Alec Burks (but he did play great)
Alec Burks for the All-Star game I guess
tonight’s homework assignment for r/nba :  5 page research paper on why Alec Burks is the best player in the NBA. MLA format please.
Alec Burks wth man
"every player in this game wanted to lose, except maybe 4th quarter alec burks"
Eric Gordon and Alec Burks are carrying the knicks
Alec “Klay” Burks.
i miss alec burks
Alec Burks is a franchise player idc
Alec Burks and Danny Green are examples
"I watched us through our 19-20 season lol. And hence last season seemed like a major upgrade in all positions.  ## Fun Fact: Of the 20 players who got minutes for the Warriors that season, 11 of them are out of the league this season.     Our guards were:    * rookie Jordan Poole (who was really league worst)    * Ky Bowman * Alec Burks (who played well and got traded mid-season) * DLo (played only half the games that season)   * Damien Lee  Forwards:    * GRob3 * Paschall   * Dray    Bigs:    * Marquese Chriss   * Omari Spellman   * Willie Cauley-Stein (also traded away mid-season)"
I love how the Knicks want to consider themselves a good team then play Alec burks and Derrick rose more than kemba and fournier
for a pick outside of the top 10 alec burks is solid af
Alec Burks was the sixth man

"Player heights up to very recently were very skewed. I met Alec Burks, Dante Exum, and Derrick Favors after a game once. I’m a legit 6,6” without shoes and was easily taller than Dante and Alec. Dante is taller than Alec too even though they were listed as the same height. Derrick favors was prob 6’8”"
Right now its Alec Burks
Alec Burks
Knicks  prolly Alec Burks / Taj Gibson
"He'd be mumbling and grumbling about the front office drafting these young, cocky shooting guards all the time too (Quincy Lewis, DeShawn Stevenson, Kirk Snyder, CJ Miles, Alec Burks)."
"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus’ Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
"Alec Burks, Kevin Knox, 4 FRPs and 4 pick swaps? Or whatever the max is. Even then it's only if Zion publicly demands a trade to the NYK.  The problem is the Knicks don't have any young talent the Pels would want other than RJ Barrett and I can't see the Knicks departing w/ him, especially if it's Zion coming in as they're college buddies.   Also Thibs would get Zion killed playing him 42 minutes a night."
"Yeah and the league is driven by superstars, nobody is going to a game to watch Alec Burks vs Delon Wright, lmfao. The NBA will soon realize that not calling these shooting fouls are screwing up superstar players efficiency and they will adjust soon enough. I mean, maybe Trae and Harden aren't getting every call they got the year before, but it will be close come the end of this 82 game season imo.   It seems like to begin the season they are tryna make an example outta Trae/Harden so people stfu about them and once All-Star break rolls around, I am sure they'll start getting more calls again. Not to mention, I am sure Trae and Harden and Embiid and all them are gonna figure out a loophole to this new rule change to start drawing more shooting fouls again which should also help them get their free throw attempt rate closer to where it was last year as well."
And not let Alec Burks play as much as he did. Rotations lost us that game
"idk what that guys is talking about. Knicks starting 5 is nothing special when comparing with other playoff teams.   Where the Knicks are strongest is they have one of the strongest bench units in the league. Derrick Rose, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, Immanuel Quickley, Nerlens Noel (once he comes back from injury). Knicks bench regularly scores 40-50 points a game between them."
all 3 having similar sounding starts to their names is actually legendary and an announcers nightmare  i mean shit our guy struggled like hell with trey burke and alec burks. add a 3rd guy? your fucked mate
"think he was just signed to shoot 3s regardless  if we desperately need penetration (and we've been really good in paint points between RJ figuring it out and Mitch healthy) you just turn to Rose  Kemba kinda has the same role as Alec Burks (get hot, shoot 3s) but Kemba has the upside of being a good facilitator as well"
"The bulls? Honestly think they’re close and just need some reliable vets off the bench next to caruso. Like a Terrance Ross, thadeus young, Jeff green, patty mills, Alec burks, Derrick favors, etc type vets for a 9-10 deep playoff squad"
So Alec Burks giving y’all 30 every game? Ok lmao
Get Alec Burks some help
That was a great game. Trae showed out and Alec Burks might be a superstar idk.
Alec Burks in the Diabeetus 1's almost got it done.   Literally just needed Randle to not play like trash. That was the difference. Hawks scheme defensively was solid. We better adjust or it's going to be more games like this from Randle.
Alec burks made me nut

RJ Barrett or Alec Burks - if they can spread the floor when Randle attacks and knock those threes then it will make everything easier for them. But every team benefits with their guys hitting their shot so yeah

"&gt; Randle was nowhere near bust status or having is NBA career in jeopardy, many Lakers fans wanted to keep him.  That is part of my point. Even he doesn't fit. Pretty much no one does.  &gt;It's an interesting point you make but players mocked that high don't constantly fail as hard as the Suns did even if it takes them going to another team.  But if it was because of the Suns failure to develop them, other teams should find tons of value swooping and picking up these young guys with star potential. Turns out they are pretty nonfactor on their teams no matter where they go and not anywhere close to being a star that many predicted before the Suns drafted them.  &gt;The Suns didn't reach but these guys failed spectacularly, there must be something the Suns were doing wrong in terms of player development that made them irredeemable.  If you got a coin and flip it 10 times it wont likely alternate heads then tails everytime. You are likely get a string of heads and/or a string of tails. It is a crapshoot. The Utah Jazz picked Kanter, Alec Burks, Trey Burke, Dante Exum, Trey Lyles to Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. This is also true accross sports, Seahawks had a string of historically great draft classes in the early 2010's to pretty bad recently in comparison. It often takes 1 or 2 players to chance an entire narrative of draft history and if 76ers never got Embiid, if Bucks never got Giannis, and if Kings got Doncic instead of Bagley, it would change entire prespectives."
"Also admitted to almost saying ""In-n-Out Burger"" when Alec Burks' shot went in and out.  This man needs to be fed."

Alec Burks is not a scrub in the slightest
Put some respect on ALEC Burks' name. He's liable to own y'all in the 4th if we ever meet.  And I know you ain't talking bout Bullock when I've seen homeless dudes down the block with cleaner locs than Ariza   I hope Precious gives y'all 10 good mins tonight lol

The Knicks offense is what scares me the most.  I still need to seem them make shots against playoff defenses for me to pick them in a series.  The defense I'm less concerned with but also how much is Payton going to play in the playoffs.  Does Thibs stop playing around and just start Derrick Rose or Alec Burks.  Payton should get zero minutes.
