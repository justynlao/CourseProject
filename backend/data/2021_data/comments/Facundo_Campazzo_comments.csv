"I often chit chat with people about how we all need to lower our expectations for these players. Once in a generation talent is simply that: Once in a generation. You can't really fault Wiggins for not turning into LeBron.   You can however win games by playing sound, fundamental basketball, and it seems like Wiggins is starting to do that. TBH he's been excellent this year and I would take him on the Nuggets in a heartbeat over guys like Will Barton and Facundo Campazzo."

"You know that's not really true though, Embiid's supporting cast is quite a lot better than Jokic's.  Or you think Facundo Campazzo+Austin Rivers are as good as Simmons and Curry?  And I don't even want to compare Tobias and Gordon."
"Well Porter is injured and Gordon isn't intended to have 0 spacing, the whole point of him is that he can eat in space and operate as basically only a cutter on offense, then focus on his D. That doesn't work when we have to replace Murray with fucking Facundo Campazzo"
Idk guys I don't think a team with a starting backcourt of Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo is going to make it to the finals
"They could, but Facundo Campazzo already plays for the Nuggets"

You can't reach the western finals starting facundo campazzo and 10 day contract after being waived Austin Rivers in the backcourt, while bringing an injured ass will barton and a washed up millsap off the bench. Too much talent disparity."
"Nuggets passive activates, Facundo Campazzo inherits the spirit of Jamal Murray and shoots 50"
"There’s no way we have enough firepower if MPJ is hurt and Barton is heavily mins restricted. Can’t win a playoff series with fucking Facundo Campazzo taking the 3rd most shots, he wouldn’t even be in the rotation if this team was as healthy as Phoenix is."
Joel would get smoked if his guards were Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo. Hard to understate how crippled the Nuggets backcourt is right now.
"The Nuggets are missing 3/4 guards, including their entire starting backcourt, and Jokic still won a playoff series with terrible spacing and starting guys on two-way contracts. When embiid was in a similar situation last season (because of roster construction and Ben’s injury), they got swept in the first round. If you put Embiid on a team with a backcourt of Austin rivers and Facundo Campazzo, plus a non-spacer in Gordon, they’re not making it out of the first round.   The Nuggets are at least equal, probably better than Philly when fully healthy."
"1. Not gonna happen  2. If I told you a month ago the Nuggets starting playoff backcourt would be Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, would you have expected them to win a single game?"
"Denver Guards not named Facundo Campazzo combined for 12 points on 4-19 (21%) shooting. The absence of Murray, Barton, and Dozier finally seems to be catching up to them."

"Put some respek on Facundo ""Manu Ginobili"" Campazzo"
He was frustrating on the defensive end with the Clips. Frequently disengages from contesting shots and doesn't rebound well. FACUNDO CAMPAZZO REBOUNDS BETTER.
"Porzingis averaged 5.4 rebounds per game this playoffs, while Facundo Campazzo is at 4 with less minutes.   He does no give a fuck about anything apart from his ego. Playing super soft, avoiding any sort of contact. No defense. I think he is gone,the only question is who will bite the bait."
"I feel like with a healthy Barton, the rotation depends on the situation at hand.  If they need guard defense, (which they will for this series. CP3 and Booker is a stronger duo than Dame and CJ), then they go with Facundo Campazzo and Will Barton. If they need guard offense, then they'll go with Monte Morris and Austin Rivers."
Take a shot every time the sportscaster calls Facundo Campazzo a 30 year old rookie
"That guy is Facundo Campazzo, a multi time basketball champion from overseas."
"Did you know that Facundo ""The 30 year old rookie"" Campazzo is a 30 year old rookie?"
"Facundo ""The 30 year old rookie"" Campazzo"
"Facundo Campazzo, 10.33ppg (who is 5’11”) is averaging more points than Steph Curry 0ppg,  (who is 6’3”) in this playoffs."
"TJ McConnell, Patty Mills, Derrick Jones Jr., Alec Burks, Facundo Campazzo"
"You're making a lot of strawmans here pretending like anyone is ignoring this performance or blaming the defense. No one is doing any of that. It's the opposite in fact, that's why his performance is being mentioned with the greatest performances of all time. The only problem is that if you start mentioning it with the goat performances, you have to start scrutinizing them and opposition strength is the first thing that jumps out since it's such a vast difference. MJ and LeBron did it against opponents with 3/4 HOFers in their prime, Lillard against a league average defensive team playing Austin fucking Rivers 47 minutes and starting Facundo Campazzo. That's a real difference. Give those versions of MJ and LeBron this Nuggets team as opponents and then imagine their stats.   As for your point that defense doesn't matter, that's just you deciding that it wouldn't matter and it's not even based on anything. If you'd at least make the argument that it's based on Lillard's history then that would at least be something but even Lillard's history against good defenses doesn't speak in your favour here. He's struggled with good defenses as recently as just last year. It's just completely arbitrary the way you decide what does and what does not matter in judging the best performance.   Again, if you want to look at strictly the box score that's fine but then at least make that caveat."

"I always hate arguments like that. Even if they played the same position, it would still be a little ridiculous. It's nearly entirely subjective and allows the reader to walk away with whatever conclusion they want regardless of their actual knowledge. Their teams, at this point, are built around their style of play. And even then, Jokic likely would perform better with the Mavs seeing as he carried the corpse of the Nuggets ft. Facundo Campazzo (blessed be the pest) to a 16-7 record since Murray went down (largely without Barton too, but you know that). That's a 70% win rate, which would be 50 wins this year, 8 games better than the Mavs entire season. Jokic was on some other shit this year lol.  As far as any actual argument, it's a little tough for Luka (at this point in his career at least) seeing as Jokic raises his team's floor by improving the efficiency of the whole team and raises the team's ceiling by making tough shots (53.8% on contested midrange) consistently. Luka can do both of those things, but not as well as Jokic can currently.  The best argument in Luka's favor is that his theoretical ceiling is higher because his defensive limitations are not as critical as Jokic's because he isn't his team's primary rim protector.   As far as Giannis, I think if he keeps buying into his offball dunk-on-everybody game he'll have that serious, shaq-like dominance. There's two types of dudes that stretch the floor, big dunkers and great shooters. Giannis takes pressure off his teammates similar to how Curry does because there just isn't anyone not named Gobert or Embiid that could meet him at the rim. Combine that with him being an above-average passer and perennial DPOY candidate? He's got a plenty strong case as well. That said, Giannis isn't 'that guy' in crunch time; his shot making simply isn't up to par with the likes of Luka, Jokic, Curry, or Brogdon. I only threw Brogdon in to jar anyone reading lmao."
"Text from the article:  As the bus carrying the melancholy Denver Nuggets rolled down Highway 101 toward San Francisco International Airport on that Tuesday morning in April, Jamal Murray sat in a seat with his left leg propped up, wiping tears from his eyes.  Across the aisle was his head coach, Michael Malone, and an impromptu therapy session began.  The night before, Murray's left knee had buckled after he'd planted on a drive toward the basket. Malone was at his side on the ground within seconds, waving for help from the medical staff. Later, inside the locker room at Chase Center, Malone was there when the Golden State Warriors team doctors informed him of their diagnosis: torn ACL.  ""Jamal was grasping the enormity of the situation and was asking himself all those questions. Will he recover? Will he ever be the same?"" Malone says. ""What I've learned in my years in basketball and what I've tried to bring to our team for the last six years is that when you face adversity, you cannot run.""  Malone has become known for a few things during what is now a two-decade-long NBA career. One is for his intensity, whether it is dealing with officials, opponents or even his own team when it's time to demand accountability. Google ""Michael Malone rant"" and there are plenty of results from meltdowns about his players' defense to the NBA's rules on letting families into the bubble last year to the LeBron James-Michael Jordan debate.  Though he has a good sense of humor and a New Yorker's sensibility and sarcasm, when Malone is upset, he sets his jaw and digs in emotionally and with his work ethic. When things aren't going right, he has been known to barricade himself in his hotel room or office and plow through the process to figure it out.  Malone's tenure in Denver has been marked by his ability to do just that. Like what he did on the bus that day in San Francisco. And what he did at the first team meeting after Murray's injury was confirmed by an MRI: leading his team through turmoil, something the now veteran coach is making a trademark.  ""I came into the meeting with Jamal's stats and I read them off. All the points, assists, 3-pointers. I wanted everyone to know exactly what we were going to be missing,"" Malone says. ""That 24 hours was very emotional for all of us. But I needed to let the guys know that none of them were expected to be Jamal. They didn't have to play outside themselves. But what they had to do was be positive. To have good body language. To believe in themselves and their teammates. That is what good teams do.""   It was the same type of resilience the Nuggets displayed last year in Orlando, Florida, where they twice came back from a 3-1 series deficit to win and reach the West finals.  ""This team's resiliency is a direct reflection of Mo,"" Nuggets team president Tim Connelly says, calling Malone by his nickname. ""We've haven't had many losing streaks in the last six years. We've responded well to tough times. A lot of credit goes to him.""  Malone is at it again, trying to chart a path for the Nuggets to get through their opening-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers. The injuries in the backcourt -- in addition to Murray, the Nuggets were down Monte Morris (who has since returned), Will Barton and PJ Dozier -- have left him starting 30-year-old rookie Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, who just a few weeks ago was signed by the team on a 10-day contract.  ""Stay positive,"" Malone says, almost as an instruction to himself. ""We are consistent with that. We do that every day no matter who is out there.""  Malone is quick to credit his players, especially Jokic, for the team's ability to follow that mantra over the past two seasons. But while Malone hasn't gotten the attention as other successful coaches have -- the Nuggets have a .625 winning percentage over the past four seasons and are trying to advance in the playoffs for the third consecutive season -- his team has developed a reputation that he has spearheaded.  His career has been highlighted by working with superstars early in their careers. Malone was with LeBron James in Cleveland for five years as an assistant and was part of the effort that transformed James into a willing defensive player. He was the lead assistant in Golden State when Stephen Curry took the leap between 2011 and 2013, overcoming ankle injuries to morph into one of the league's greatest offensive weapons of all time.  And he has been with Jokic since day one, overseeing his development into what will likely be the third MVP whom Malone has impacted.  ""When Nikola was at his first summer league with us, there wasn't one person in our group who thought he'd be an NBA starter,"" Malone says. ""But with LeBron and Steph, you see they have great basketball IQ and they have a great work ethic. Their IQ is off the charts. That's what you also see with Nikola.""  Malone acutely remembers flying home from Dallas after getting blown out in early in the 2016-17 season and talking himself into building the team around Jokic, whom he had been trying to shoehorn into the lineup next to fellow big man Jusuf Nurkic. Within weeks, Nurkic was traded and the team's turnaround began.   Four years later, the turnaround looked to be nearing its apex. After a March trade for Aaron Gordon gave Malone defensive versatility he hadn't had in the past and unlocked a leap for Michael Porter Jr. on offense, the Nuggets promptly went on an eight-game winning streak, looking every bit like bona fide title contenders.  But the Murray injury lowered their ceiling and possibly set that dream back -- and not just this season, as Murray is likely to miss much of next year. And with just one year left on Gordon's contract, it's unclear when or even if the Nuggets will ever get to see what that collection of players could become.  ""No excuses -- that's what we believe,"" Malone says. ""And that's why I'm so proud of this team."""

"People need to quit judging Melo based on started/star level standards. That's not who he is and that's not the role he plays here. Same with Kanter. These two are our 6th and 7th men. They have shortcomings but tey both have a positive VORP and league average (Melo) and above league average (Kanter) scoring efficiency. Kanter also has incredible offensive rebounding numbers that go a long way in offsetting his defense.   If you don't believe me, go look at other teams in the playoffs (outside really deep teams like the Jazz). How do their 6th and 7th men compare? Do Caruso and Horton-Tucker provide considerably more than those two? Monte Morris and Facundo Campazzo?"

"Nah it’s just very clear that suns fans don’t understand how playoff basketball works because you haven’t watched it for 11 years. And the fun thing about this is that it’ll cover up the need for improvement (like the Heat) and leave you guys in purgatory until you’re priced/aged out of this potential window.

"AD absolutely does not belong in that group. He made the playoffs once in 6 years without another superstar. And idc about his supporting cast, Jokic won *a playoff series* with a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers. If AD was a top 10 player he’d be good enough to carry a team to the fucking 8 seed and he just isn’t, full stop. You take a team like Detroit and give them any of Luka, Jokic, LeBron (healthy), Giannis, KD, Harden, and that team is significantly better than it would be with AD as the best player."
"The idea that value ""basically zeroes"" if the person is on the losing team is incredibly flimsy.   In no world does it make sense for dame's value to be rendered null because Robert Covington can't dunk and cj can't pass. In no world does it make sense that facundo campazzo and his 1/5 with 3pts had a more valuable game and contributed more positive influence in that game than dame.  Dame, the singular player, had more value in that game than every single other player who played a second in that game.  Denver, the collective team, exploited the blazers poor defense and inability to get consistent offense outside of dame.  It was obvious to anyone watching that dame was the best player on the court. It was obvious to anyone watching who had the most positive influence in the game.   Roco converting one of his two missed dunks does not change that fact. His teammates going 1/14 in OT does not change that fact"
Fools were on AD’s head because he couldn’t drag Jrue Holiday far in the playoffs in the western conference. His only good playoff series came against the Blazers whose backcourt made Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers look good offensively.

Just be lucky that you had to face post injury LeBron leading Guangdong Tigers and then the Nuggets with the backcourt of Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo.
"A lineup with Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo as the starting guards shouldn’t have beaten the Blazers in 6, regardless of the bench."
&gt; Beating that high level Facundo Campazzo-Austin Rivers backcourt  Disgusted at the shade thrown at the MVP.
"I'd love to see what Giannis could do with Austin Rivers, Facundo Campazzo as his two guards. And with his second  best player and another starter injured. Jokic has been an elite playoff performer every year."
Suns fans have somehow gone from likeable to PhDs in “act like you’ve never been there” in about a week lmao. Beating that high level Facundo Campazzo-Austin Rivers backcourt really did something to them
Facundo Campazzo sounds like a fake name meant to stir racism towards Italians LOL
"lakers get robbed  not trading Kuzma AND a pick for some guy who got beat by the trio of Monte Morris, Austin Rivers, and Facundo Campazzo."
"Lol, Jokic's defense was solid in the playoffs. The Nuggets beat a Blazers team with one of the best offenses in the NBA and Jokic wasn't the problem against phoenix- our guards being the worst point of attack defenders in the NBA and our awful weakside rotations with non-rotation players starting left him out to dry. No NBA center is gonna be stopping lobs, stopping the midrange game, and stopping corner 3s at the same time, especially against CP3/Book and Bridges/Crowder/Ayton.  We saw the exact same things happen to Embiid against the Trae -&gt; Capela/Collins lobs and floaters (with MUCH better point of attack defenders) and to Gobert.   Embiid is considerably worse than Jokic as a #1 option. We saw that this year once again. He could be great playing like AD with an elite scorer and distributor as the primary ballhandler. But there's no way he'd be able to beat the Blazers (who had a better record than the Hawks btw) with a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers. There's just no way. Likewise a team with Jokic would beat the Hawks with that point of attack D and Seth going off like he did... plus Tobias wouldn't have to create all his own shots and the offense wouldn't fold without Ben's passing. There's not even an argument for Embiid at this point, he's comfortably a tier below."
Bro we started Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers after Jamal went down and were a 70%+ win team. KAT is at the bottom of the standings every year.   Malik averaged 8 points on terrible efficiency the season he was traded. Let's not act like they were bringing a 20 point guy of the bench just because they could.
"Sure but CJ got torched by Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo lol, literally lost them a series this year, or was a big part of it. They had a full strength team and Dame playing his best playoff ball ever and still lost in 6 because jokic is a fucking animal"

The disrespect for Facundo Campazzo
"And they did… gave up an average of 123.4 points per game against a starting backcourt with Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo.  No disrespect to the Nuggets because they showed heart and played exceptionally well including those two, but they have no business averaging 120 points on offense."
"It depends how you view superstar. There is definitely a tier of players above Dame, and i think those are the guys called superstars. He also was playing against an injured Denver backcourt featuring Austin Rivers and 5'10 Facundo Campazzo as the starting guards."
"Facundo ""Kyrie Irving"" Campazzo"
"He is well on his way to competing for that “best in NBA” title with giannis for many years, but him steamrolling some scrubs in international competition shouldn’t be the thing that makes you think he’s the best in the nba right now. like who is on japan? rui hachimura? who is on argentina? facundo campazzo?"
Sleeper pick but Facundo Campazzo is an absolute menace with these type of steals.
"No, you don't need to go through the draft if you're an international player over 22. See how Facundo Campazzo signed with the Nuggets last year."
You are picking CP3 because of his… nickname? What if everyone started calling Facundo Campazzo the point god tomorrow? Would your opinion change?
They still lost in the 1st round in both those series. Dame also had bad games in both series. He shot 8/20 against Facundo Campazzo in Game 6.    That's not exactly an MVP kinda guy.

Bogues sets up his teammates to score.   I think that the closest player to Boges would be Facundo Campazzo (high effort, nice passes), who is still 7 inches taller than Bogues. And peak Bogues is still better.  No one will be able to replicate both his style and talent at that height."
"Boban Marjanovic, Javon Carter and Facundo Campazzo"
Facundo Campazzo?
"I just struggle with it because the Nuggets offense with Jokic off (103 ORTG) was almost as bad as GSW with Steph off last year (102), but the reason Denver was so much better was because the offense was WAY better with Jokic on (121) than steph on (114). The fact Denver still had an elite offense even with Facundo Campazzo and Austin rivers starting has me lean Jokic, not necessarily because Jokic is individually better than Curry, but because replacement level is so much lower for bigs than for guards. Curry ends up paired with someone like looney because you need a big, but because Jokic is a 5 you get guys who are much better passers and shooters (eg rivers) than the average starting C next to him- that’s why he makes every offense elite in a way I don’t think Steph and KD do"
"Because his starting backcourt was Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers, duh. He singlehandedly beat a team with a better record than the Hawks in 6"
"Jokic took a starting backcourt of Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo into the 2nd round. KAT can't make the playoffs once. KAT is a soft player. Jokic thrives when facing adversity, KAT folds under pressure."
Posts like this are always fun because fans of every team are like “yes I’ll take him but I won’t give you more than facundo campazzo and a 2nd”
I'll take the dude who just knocked him out of the playoffs with Austin Rivers and Facundo Campazzo lol
A 3rd option behind who ? Facundo campazzo ? Austin rivers ?
Facundo Campazzo is older than Derrick Favors and only 5 months younger than Ricky Rubio.
"Again, if you switch supporting casts the Nuggets still win that series easily. CJ was bad, but he’s still way better than Facundo Campazzo. Norm is way better than Austin Rivers. MPJ had like 2 good games that series. The nuggets won that series because Jokic is a fucking animal   I’m not saying MPJ is a future MVP, im saying his ceiling is an MVP tier player. Which is just a fact if you know anything about MPJ and his prospect grades, and performance at his age, which you don’t seem to."
Facundo Campazzo is the closest thing right now. Even smaller that Isaiah Thomas.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Well unless Facundo Campazzo is really Luka Doncic I think the Nuggets played a little outside themselves tonight. Nuggets should be great but the Bulls are really good too.
"Dude.  They also had Kyrie and Kevin Love and an age 30 JR Smith.  LeBron ain't beating anyone with a starting backcourt of Monte Morris, Facundo Campazzo, and Austin Rivers like Jokic had during the playoffs last year."
Jokic literally won a series in 6 with a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers last year my man. Jamal Murray is not better than Jimmy Butler….
"Oh, a spectacular move by Facundo Campazzo!"
Facundo Campazzo probably.
"No one is saying he didn't have an insane round but that 1 game pumps his numbers like crazy since it only went to 6 and let's not act like world beater facundo campazzo was out here playing elite D at 5'10"" on lillard. There's context to every amazing performance but people just seem to ignore that sometimes with lillard"
"Yeah, did you see Jokic? It’s not like he was gonna carry a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin Rivers to the WCF, nobody could"
"It’s not clear that any of those guys are better, Jokic has done more with a way weaker supporting cast. I mean dude won a playoff series with a starting backcourt of Facundo Campazzo and Austin rivers, that’s insane."
"What, last year? We were not only missing the butter to our bread, but we we were missing Will Barton and PJ dozier. We were starting rookie Facundo Campazzo and out of the league Austin Rivers. The year before that we did go to the wcf."
