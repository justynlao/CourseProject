Jaylen is like a rich mans Jimmy Butler. Keeps getting better and better
Hasn't Jimmy Butler missed like 97 games this year?
"Ah yes, cause the homeless Jimmy Butler had connections or the homeless LeBron James had connections. Definitely not because they were really really good and had scouts come to games and stuff. I‚Äôm sure connections are what are keeping some players out of the league, not the fact that they are less talented then others. How about the European players who come from European leagues. I‚Äôm sure Luka made it to the league because of all the connections he had, not the fact he won the league MVP and championship in Europe. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"

Jimmy Butler - Game 5 had him carry hard
"What do y'all want Kerr to do though...play Steph 48 minutes?  He played the whole first and 38 minutes overall.  This is basically the team that GSW will be rolling out the whole year.  If 38 minutes of Steph can't get it done, that's on other guys.  Y'all the same people complaining about Thibs all the time for playing Jimmy Butler 35-36 minutes and you want Curry playing more than 38."

"Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, DeMar Derozen."
&gt;A few offseasons ago people were talking about how bloated Miami's cap sheet was and they acquired Jimmy Butler anyways.  They turn that bloated  cap into Jimmy Butler. They also waived players.
"Not necessarily, the salary cap is largely a myth with all the exceptions &amp; sign and trade shenanigans that can be employed.  A few offseasons ago people were talking about how bloated Miami's cap sheet was and they acquired Jimmy Butler anyways."

TJ Warren is better than Jimmy Butler was a legitimate take on this subreddit post Bubble Warren  A bad one. A terrible one. But still. Warren‚Äôs very good.
"I mean it doesn't have 100% predictive value but it doesn't have 0% predictive value either.   The initial draft time rankings were largely created from 20-30 NCAA games. Clearly 20 rookie games in the actual NBA should mean *something*.   If you play like trash like Wiggins/Okafor/Fultz, it seems fine to slightly de-value that player. Every now and then you might wrongly write off a player too early (eg Brandon Ingram), but probably still ""less wrong"" than pretending they are still a #1 pick-level prospect.   Likewise if a player is super good as a rookie (ie Jokic, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, etc), even if they are a late pick, it's probably fine to value them as a top 5 pick."
Fuck off and fuck Jimmy Butler
"Of course, but there are magnitudes of no calls, and certain players receive mroe no calls than others and vice versa. I agree, I don't think it's intentional, but it persists. We have stats to prove it too. Look at Jeremy Lin, Goran Dragic, or Shaq, or LeBron, all receive a higher percentage of no calls than say Jimmy Butler or James Harden etc...   Just because other players don't receive calls too, doesn't mean Luka or LeBron etc... wasn't hit on a call. He has a right to be pissed, but do it at a deadball, not while the other team is looking to score."
They already removed the protections from that pick when the acquired Jimmy Butler.

"No.   Your list has zero consistency. Is it based on this year alone, since your claiming Hardens new role makes him not top ten. Then why is someone like Kemba over someone like Fox, or Randle, or to be honest, damn near everybody below him. Why is Jimmy Butler top 12???   Is your list cumulative, based on recent seasons? Then why is Westbrook at 45 under someone like Tobias Harris? Why is PG over Kawhi?  You have Bam over Luka. Seemingly because of defense? Yet you have KAT right over Bam, who is still not a better offensive player than Luka.   ... and I‚Äôm just not seeing Zions name on the list anywhere?   This list is disturbing"
- Has Jimmy Butler above Harden

"I mean, could we even come to an agreement right now?  I have:  pg: Curry / Luka / Dame / Cp3 / Kyrie  sg: Soften / Beal / Mitchell / Dbook / CJ McCollum  sf: LeBum / Kawhine / Jimmy Butler / Jayson ""6'10"" Tatum / PG13%  pf: Giannis / AD / Sabonis / Siakam / Williamson  c: Jokic / EmbiId / Bayumn Adebayo / KAT / Zhe Baguette Money Man  &amp;#x200B;  and I guarantee there would be a bunch of angry people regarding those rankings."
"But Jimmy can actually make contested mid-range shots, it's not like he's Ricky Rubio or Markelle Fultz. He's not a *great* shooter, but he's not incapable of scoring, he just picks his spots.   And my point was more in relation to what OP was saying by not getting the Butler hype, which is preposterous to me because the guy has:  - Been the best player on a team that made the Finals  - Made 5 All-Star teams  - Made 3 All-NBA teams  - Made 3 All-Defense teams  How many players in the league have that kind of resume? Bottom line is he's a winning basketball player, and every team he joins wins more when he joins, and loses more when he leaves."
"I love these games when Hayward doesn't pop off but he still pops off.  People always complained about him being too passive, but I think it's just letting the game come to him. Maybe sometimes they're right, I don't know. If that's true then you have to say the same about Jimmy Butler.  But 42 minutes, most from either team. 8-14 from the field, 2-4 from 3pt, adding some nice 6reb/3ast/2stl.  Just out there on the floor longer than anyone and impacting the game in a positive way."
"""Jimmy Butler dribbling in his room"""
"Jimmy Butler was doing a lot more than just scoring. He was ultra efficient. Played great defense, and had multiple games with 3+ steals, and didnt even turn the ball over much. They were historic games because he genuinely did everything the team needed of him."
"&gt;Jimmy Butler has had historic finals games last year,   Some one had to score with all the injuries  &gt;has lead an underdog team to the finals   Excuse me? Bam has entered the chat"
"He‚Äôs not better that Giannis, Kawhi, Gobert, Jimmy Butler or AD right now. Then you want to talk about ‚Äúgeneration?‚Äù Alright, he‚Äôs not better than Gary Payton, Garnett, Iguodala, Chris Paul.   Those are off the top of my head. If I looked it up, I‚Äôd find a dozen more at least as good as Draymond. He‚Äôs a good communicator. He‚Äôs benefitted from small ball that allowed GSW to run big guys off the floor. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô6‚Äù."

"You should be.   1. This is the best you'll ever get out of Embiid but there are still limits to what you can ask from him on both ends of the court, his workload right now is unsustainable in the playoffs  2.

Right now you're super reliant on Harris and Curry stepping up in a big way  * Harris has played well but he's never been a good playoff performer  * Seth Curry has returned to earth after his hot start   I just wouldn't trust those two to take you over the top in a playoff  against elite opponents     The regular-season record is nice, but Philly still hasn't answered the big playoff questions that need to be answered. Right now the 76ers are where Milwaukee was last season, there isn't a lot of room for long-term growth for the team, you have to capitalise while you can.   The 76ers can rest on the laurels of the 1st seed, or they can work towards a serious title contender.   Lowry can answer those questions comfortably."
"&gt;""Don't ever say anything bad (no matter how true) about the Heat or you will face a lot of backlash""   &gt;   &gt; ""Still don't understand why Miami had massive expectations"" ""They massively overachieved last year.

Why is that changing now?   &gt;   &gt;Adding KD to Brooklyn wasn't a guaranteed improvement? Bucks obviously improved Anybody who understands basketball knew that Philly would be improved.

Jimmy Butler was a 24% 3pt shooter last year fyi
So you ignoring how mid the heats roster was from 2014 all the way to jimmy butler joining?
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"
"There's literally a 0% chance that Jimmy Butler makes it. Why are people even bringing up his name in this thread? He has played 8 games, *nobody* has advocated for him to make the All-Star Game."
"Jimmy wants to hang back and get 18/7/4 or whatever and win. Eventually he will go into ""ok, I guess I'm winning this game single-handedly now."" And I don't think he likes doing that over and over. He's happy when he's on a team that only need superstar butler once, maybe twice, a week haha."
Jimmy Butler not even trying to fight to stay on Hayward and watching him miss while attempting to shoot threes was so satisfying. Fuck this clown lmao.
"Malik Monk with ~~cocaine~~ ice in his veins, Jimmy Butler finally missing a game winner against us, Devonte/Gordon exposing Tyler Herro. Couldn't have asked for a better way to end a game against the Heat. WE STREAKING BABY!"
Lmao Jimmy Butler is a fckn bum
Why the hell would a jimmy butler contested three be your best option
Jimmy Butler is 0-10 for 3 this year.
"Erik Spoelstra's Secrit Play: Jimmy Butler steals ball, passes it to a white guy who shoots a three."
Jimmy Butler for Karl Towns.
Jimmy Butler takes a bite on his crossover and he makes it from the line.
"My take is awash in ""hindsight is 20/20"" but I wish we had traded for Jimmy Butler during his twolves debacle. We probably could have gotten him without giving up CJ/Nurk and seeing how he's done with the Heat's culture, I think he would  have worked amazingly well on our team."
"Butler scored less, has the ball less, and is not a top superstar. He‚Äôs not going to crush your team for 35 in a night. He‚Äôs seen as a gritty all-star that brings leadership. So people hate it less, because he gets less attention as a scorer in general. He baits for fouls just as much as Harden does. It‚Äôs just Harden does it while he‚Äôs dropping 30+ and has the ball in his hands a lot.  For me I hate it more because every time Jimmy has the ball in his hands there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôs getting a foul call in some capacity."
"Actually that‚Äôs genius, imagine jimmy butler last year just pointing out AD to the refs and he gets free lanes to the rim all day because it‚Äôd unnerve AD"
"If it's difficult to compare Curry and Lillard, then you basically can't compare anybody? Isn't that one a pretty straightforward comparison? Is Michael Jordan better than Jimmy Butler or can we not make that comparison because Jordan had better teammates?"
"Jimmy Butler gets a huge pass for being a guy that lives at the line and forces contact just to get a foul call. He‚Äôs no different than Trae or Harden, and may be worse considering that last year 38% of his points came from the line. At least Harden/Young have the ball in their hands virtually the entire game, so it makes a bit more sense that they get to the line a lot."
This is another what if moment for the wolves. I really wanted a chance to see a Rubio/Lavine/Butler/Bjelica/KAT lineup out there... Gives you the chance to give Jimmy the max he wanted and probably outperforms our starting five from the Butler season.   Too bad Thibs played Zach a million minutes leading to the ACL tear. Think he was leading the league or close to it when he went down....
"I‚Äôd have to agree they would‚Äôve . Rondo was too scrappy on defensive and his iq is off the charts , that whole team would‚Äôve been a problem . They would‚Äôve 4 peated and because of blood clots bosh would‚Äôve been out . Wades knees would‚Äôve possibly been saved due to less pressure on the shot creation side he can just play off the ball . He def would‚Äôve avoided that second injury . Leaving a slightly aged duo in bron and Wade .. with the addition of perhaps butler or bam adebayo in the coming years I wonder how everything would‚Äôve played out . Rondo, Wade, jimmy , lebron, ___?"
"Even when they made the conference finals, the things Jimmy Butler had to say about the leadership on the team was pretty eye opening."
"Making lists imo is useless. The regular season ""top 5"" is very different from the playoffs ""top 5"". LeBron usually starts off quiet but becomes a different kind of monster when it counts. Players like Harden and Westbrook have had great regular seasons and have significantly fallen off in the playoffs. Giannis was MVP last season but Jimmy Butler outperformed him in the playoffs. Point is, a top 5 player needs to step up his game when it counts. If Jokic can keep this form up in the playoffs and make a solid run I'd probably say he is; we have to see if last years WCF was a lucky fluke or the beginning of the Joker era."
Jimmy Butler
"Lmao. Bro really only watches youtube highlights of each game. They haven't played the Jazz, Celtics, Warriors or Sixers since they traded Harden for their depth and interior defense. But sure I'm the idiot.   You are unable to see that the Nets team from before and the Nets team now are two different things because you only watch YouTube highlights.  Joel Embiid will literally dominate the Nets. They let Vuc seem like the second coming off Shaq. They lost to the worst team in the NBA,  barely beat the Hawks who don't have their entire roster healthy, barely beat the Heat one game who don't have Jimmy Butler or half their roster (Bam went off which is going to keep happening),  lost to the Cavs twice,  and barely beat Vuc.   Notice in almost every game, some body on the other team has a fucking career night. Its because they have NO DEFENSE. No NBA teams has won the final in the past decade without a top ten defense.   You better hope the Nets defense improves. Or else they are getting bounced early."
"Should study jimmy butler there. Bigger than most guys at his position and athletic, he‚Äôs gotta use that to create contact in his favor."
"Yeah because that‚Äôs what gobert is known for, defense. Those guys can do shit on the other end of the court. And giannis caught plenty of heat for Jimmy Butler going off in the playoffs. AD and bam also made the finals while goberts been exposed multiple times"
"This is legit why the Heat zone was so good too. Jimmy Butler and Jae Crowder at the point of attack, Bam at the rim, pls ignore Herro / Dragic / Duncan Robinson getting hidden at the corners"
"This is the funniest conversation on reddit people get so rabid over a word that means nothing... he's better than Jimmy butler and people consider jimmy elite,so that tells you everything."
The Twolves are scratching their heads wondering what happened.   Jimmy Butler is in Miami knowing exactly what happened.
K Love was making fun of Jimmy Butler 3AM workouts  guess which one made it to the Finals last year? and which one was busy being a bad leader +  trying to get his coach fired while being one of the worst contracts in the league
"LeBron, Dame, Curry, Jimmy Butler, Giannis"
Jimmy Butler. Source: Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
"I think he's the guy that's closest to being excluded from that list and join the Jimmy Butler tier of day-to-day Superstars. However Kyrie has placed highly on RPM, boasted a BPM of 7+ for 3 seasons now, .2 ws/48 for 4 seasons, 3-7%rTS in the same span and some of the best triple threat game in the league along with a Top 3 shotmaking ability. Kyrie will always be able to get you buckets, no matter what Defense you throw at him along with masterful pick'n'roll play and generally good to elite levels of playmaking across the board. I'm kind of betting on Kyrie keeping his upwards trajectory up since his impact metrics as well as general ability are way up there with the other guys. He has the most to prove from the list of guys, he may very well be one of the very best second options next to AD on the guard position though which puts him juuuust on the list for me. But I won't be mad if you don't think that he's that good. He's one of the lower tier Superstars for me and probably the worst out of the bunch. Still a Superstar imo"
"Now you're simply underplaying Kyrie. Advanced stats and basic stats have painted him as a top 15 player for a while, and your statement that only casuals would agree with is false. What 15 players were clearly better than Kyrie in 2017-2018? Guys like PG, Dame, at that time it was extremely debatable Kyrie Vs Dame. You have to remember how bad Dame choked in the playoffs. Embiid or Jokic weren't really considered a top 10 player yet either, nor Jimmy Butler, or Tatum, guys that are considered top 15 today.   Now obviously there are some players, like Chris Paul, Westbrook, John Wall, who were considered much better then than now, but your just flat out wrong to say that no one would think Kyrie was a top 15 player back in those days."
They also had this guy named Jimmy Butler who kinda helped them make the playoffs
"Depends on how you define Superstar. To me Superstars are guys like Bron, Kawhi, Harden, KD, Jokic, Embiid, AD, Giannis, Curry, Lillard, Kyrie, Luka. The very best of the best, perennial All-NBA 1st Team calibre guys. Maybe Tatum joins the club, maybe Brown, maybe even both honestly. I still wouldn't put either in that category, there's some post season success left to be had despite their great 2018 showing as a squad. Both of these guys have to prove they can outplay or even dominate other teams with a Superstar or even borderline Superstars like Jimmy Butler whom on a good day can be a Top10 player but lacks the consistent brilliance the other guys on my list provide.  In terms of impact Brown definitely has Superstar production in him since he's a great 2 way player. I feel the same way about Tatum but he's younger, has shown more leadership in the past couple of years and historically has been a better tough shotmaker. In 21 Brown does all these things better than Tatum though... for now."
It‚Äôs like the Jimmy Butler t-wolves trade where the trade that was considered to be lopsided is now lopsided in the other teams favor
How good would the Sixers be if they hadn't turned Jimmy Butler into Seth Curry?
If you replaced jimmy butler with harden on any of those rockets teams over the years in the west I guarantee they would do worse in the playoffs
This isn't really fair because LeBron is way better than Jimmy Butler so each team isn't losing a similar amount

I think that about catches us up to the current season.   Obviously the wolves shoot themselves in the foot often enough, but this team was really heading down the right path under a really well respected basketball mind in Flip. Ain‚Äôt been the same since."
"Well if you're looking for a guy who's a playmaker, regardless of position, then the best one Embiid has ever played with is Jimmy Butler."
I still hope Miami will make a move to have them at least 2 cosistent scorers which will help lessen the load for Jimmy Butler.
"LeBron‚Äôs won the last 6 game 7‚Äôs he‚Äôs played, unless you‚Äôre taking Russell, in a winner take all game LeBron should be your choice.  And easier competition?

And ignored a bunch of fringe guys like Arenas or Jason Kidd."

"When Butler and Embiid were teammates, who was the better player in the 2019 playoffs?  Embiid hasnt proven he can elevate his game in the playoffs the way that guys like Jimmy, KD and LeBron do and until he does, I cant rank him ahead."
"&gt;Jimmy Butler is a fucking superstar.   Na. That's LeBron,KD,Harden tier"
Swept? You reek of a jimmy butler hater. The sixers were swept in the first round of in recall. I also recall jimmy &amp; the heat beating those same Celtics
"Damn his name shouldn't even be mentioned here. Do you understand how much of a bad man Sprewell was when he was hooping with the bald head for golden state?!?!..  He was like a street Jordan, and showed as much talent as Penny and Grant Hill.   And he lifted his game every.damn.time in the most pressure situations.  The guy is basically a more athletic Jimmy Butler, with a good measure of D-Rose spliced in.  He was the f\*ing man when he was young."
I watch a lot of sports. NBA being one of them. Jimmy does the right thing 9/10 times. The Heat were more than 10/1 to win the East in the bubble. They completely dominated. Lost one game leading up to the finals. Injuries cost then the finals. Pretty sure Bron said that was the second hardest finals opponent he played against. Why? Jimmy Butler. He makes his teammates better because he holds them accountable. Not for show.
"There‚Äôs two forms of empty stats players.  You have guys like Vucevic and D‚ÄôLo who score 20 points, but on below average efficiency.  Then you have guys like Lavine and Beal. Their offense is good, but look at the effort being given on defense. If you don‚Äôt expend any energy on the defensive end, it‚Äôs easier to produce on the offensive end compared to someone like Jimmy Butler or Jaylen Brown who expend a lot of energy on defense."
You‚Äôve literally got Jimmy Butler on your team dude lmfao
"He was definitely a monster that series. But he also but up a 12/7/8 in game 6. Didn't have the best Boston series. I also really buy into the idea that the bubble created a really unique  playing environment that affected players in different ways. Others might not though, so I'm happy to be proven wrong by a Jimmy ECF tour again. Again is no way Butler not a fucking stud."
"The funniest thing is when people say Lonzo's ""floor"" is Rajon Rondo and 'that's not good enough.' If he's Rondo, he's worth big money.  &gt;*We have, but Ball‚Äôs role will be different this time. I actually envision Ball as the sixth man on this Lakers team,* ***being a much better version of what Rajon Rondo was to last year‚Äôs Lakers.*** *He is undoubtedly a better defensive player, is a better shooter than Rondo and has showcased that he has generational passing ability.*  Rondo won you that Finals.  He said, *""Hey, let's just do to Jimmy what I do to Harden. Jimmy is the only guy who can playmake out there, here's how we'll stop him.""* Then you stopped Jimmy Butler.  He's known to be one of the smartest guys in the league--with a great BBIQ, so this idea of 'Rondo' as Lonzo's ""floor"" is too silly."
I think the sixer trade for butler was even worse they lost depth and shooting for half a season of jimmy butler
"As a Sixers fan. I‚Äôm so sad he‚Äôs not with us anymore but, this is the first time in my 36 years of fandom that my favorite player isn‚Äôt actively on a Philly team. Wherever he goes I‚Äôm watching. Those Heat took it to the Lakers and if they had played with fans could‚Äôve been different. Maybe they don‚Äôt even make the finals who knows. But Jimmy Butler is a role model for anyone no matter age, sex, religion or creed. Go 76ers first and foremost and I hope Embiid wins MVP and Finals MVP. But, when none of those things happen because they lost to the Heat in the second round. I‚Äôm a Jimmy Butler fan."
Jimmy Butler was the next pick after him at 30 right?
"for sure, but i think it was a good trade for them even looking at it now. they just dropped the bag big fucking time when it came to jimmy. one thing that irked me back then was them trading rubio and signing teague instead. it looked like a better fit on paper sure, but rubio and jimmy woulda given them 2 guys in the backcourt who are great at moving the ball around. instead, jimmy was the only guy who could do that on their roster, and you had wiggins and teague instead just being complete ball stoppers. made shit even more infuriating knowing that they got the most dominant offensive big on their team that would go stretches of being freezed outta the offense  they got butler then built the team so it couldnt function without him. its not surprising why things went south so quick for them. he went from a shitty, toxic situation in chicago, to another real shitty situation in minny. if they dont completely and utterly fuck everything up after the jimmy trade, i think they coulda actually done something"
Jimmy butler is huge
Lebron cp3 kawhi draymond rondo Tatum jimmy butler
Westbrook Lebron cp3 pat bev jimmy butler
Already a bunch of great names in here but I'll add that for us it's Talen Horton Tucker. He went from being at the bottom of our depth chart to being a reliable scorer off the bench and even starting occasionally for injured guys.   He's actually quite a versatile scorer for how he looks. He's got a body like PJ Tucker but when he gets in the paint he's surprisingly acrobatic and the way he moves with the ball is very similar to how Jimmy Butler disrupts defenses. Not bad for a 2nd round pick.
"because the Lakers definitely played down to their opponent and even they admitted it... which is why they bent them over in game 6 beat the doors off of them.  They let the foot off the gas thinking the Heat would lay over , and they didn‚Äôt.  Jimmy Butler had literally one of the all time great single game performances ... and they still almost lost that game.   The raptors at best do the same thing the Heat did and take two games."
Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler took 2 off of you and he had an undersized team with barely any supporting cast to speak of. The Lakers whole thing was rolling over exhausted small ball teams because they had AD, that doesn't work anywhere near as well when you have Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka going up against you."
"Miami managed to take 2 off the Lakers with Jimmy Butler and the kidz bop crew, the Lakers would have gotten spanked by the 2019 Raptors. The Raptors as they were would have given the Lakers trouble if they had that extra little bit of offense to get past the Celtics, adding Kawhi in would have LeBron in fits."
"And while All-NBA designations and other awards are more prestigious by a long shot, it still is something that is listed/considered for the Hall of Fame. Jimmy Butler sat out the game itself one year, or Booker Embiid and Simmons missed for covid protocols this year, but they still are considered all stars for that season.  All Star games were even less competitive a few years ago believe it or not. But it‚Äôs really just a chance to celebrate some of the biggest names, showcase skills/talent, and allow Lebron to recruit future teammates."
"Jimmy butler, seems like a super interesting person."
Jimmy Butler last playoffs
Lowry would have no issue going to his hometown team in Philadelphia or playing with one of his best friends in Jimmy Butler. Clippers are doing their due diligence and trying to upgrade because it's their job. Doesn't mean it's likely
"I blame the Wolves. So many players come here, suddenly get way worse, and are never the same afterward. Not always (Jimmy Butler, Dario Saric) but way too often."
"I think it coincides with the general recency bias people have when talking about PG13. Lower down you mentioned his self given nickname but if we're being logical, his comments to the press don't affect how good or bad he's been in the playoffs.  He's near or at the superstar tier and he should be judged for that alone.  Both him and Jimmy Butler have had sometimes patchy playoff performances but George has been tagged as if he always underperforms, just because he underperformed last year. They've both had 2 or 3 mediocre/bad playoffs overall."
"Giannis at C doesn't work as well as you might think in the playoffs. It means he can no longer guard dominant wings or iso players on the defensive end because he is obliged to guard the opponent's big man. Example: Vs jimmy butler and the heat, they played Giannis at C for a few possessions and butler dominated."
The type of music Jimmy Butler listens too
If you can beat a team consisting of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid and then beat the MIL Bucks AND the GSW that‚Äôs a solid ass run
"I think their problem would be less bigs (hyperathletic ones like Embiid who could hang at the perimeter when needed would absolutely be a massive issue, don't get me wrong, but he's one of a kind) and moreso bigger wings. Any elite wing defender with good driving skills would absolutely feast on that lack of rim protection. Someone like Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, or any other player that fits that general mold would have a field day against that team, even if you've got solid defense from CP3 and Klay.   Still would be a really fun team to watch, though, without question."
"How can you unironically say this?   You didn‚Äôt think those Murray/Mitchell fuels and the Nuggets 3-1 comeback against the Clippers were memorable? You didn‚Äôt think Luka‚Äôs game-winner against the Clippers was memorable? You didn‚Äôt think the Clippers blowing a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets was memorable?   How about Bam‚Äôs insane, game-saving block against Tatum? Or what about Giannis and the Bucks falling apart against the Heat? Or Anunoby‚Äôs 0.5 game-winner against the Celtics? Was AD‚Äôs buzzer beater against the Nuggets really not memorable for you? And you really didn‚Äôt think Jimmy Butler putting up 40/11/13 against LeBron and AD was memorable at all?  It may not have been as great as a normal playoffs would‚Äôve been, but if you really couldn‚Äôt find anything memorable in there, then I think that‚Äôs more on you than on the quality of the product."
You know Jimmy Butler gives zero fucks about the all star game anyway. He probably chilling at the crib with a drink in his hand üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How many NBA players need to have to sit out for a hair cut until everybody starts taking the Jimmy Butler approach?
Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo might be a fair offer
This is obviously just a rest game. Many stars are gonna be ruled out last minute for some BS reason. Bam Adebayo just got scratched out of nowhere. Coincidentally Jimmy Butler is back in the lineup now.
"I mean, the Process only took 4 years and it turned the Sixers into a top team for years to come. Hinkie got Embiid, Simmons and developed the assets that got Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris. Outside of the Okafor pick he put the organization in a really good position. If Colangelo screws it up from there that‚Äôs on him."
"I mean i think the Sixers deserve more credit than the nets but not by much. Going from 10-72 and then slowly developing into the current team they are now and the team in the 2019 playoffs was a bigger improvement. Especially now they have a good coach,a great FO and a good culture/environment to win.  I mean it took them getting swept in the playoffs to make those changes but sometimes that‚Äôs what it takes. They let Butler walk and that was a huge mistake.   Also Embiied and Simmons stepped up and are playing to the level they always could have. In the 2019 playoffs the sixers weren‚Äôt ready and in game 7 they all froze besides Jimmy. Even if Kawhii missed that shot and they played the bucks the sixers likely would have lost.   Kyrie didn‚Äôt even play in the bubble last year. The nets were always going to be contenders when Kyrie and KD returned and Harden just pushed them over the edge."
"Grant, PG13, Middleton, TJ Warren, Jimmy Butler"
"&gt; so you think we'd be in a better position now if we traded Brown, Tatum, and the 8th pick for Jimmy Butler or Demarcus Cousins?  Honestly, maybe?  There's literally no way to know."
"so you think we'd be in a better position now if we traded Brown, Tatum, and the 8th pick for Jimmy Butler or Demarcus Cousins? Because those were the hypothetical trades that led to the ""overvaluing assets"" narrative"
"Starbury, Jimmy Butler, Sam Cassell, and Chauncey Billups were all better.   It's just too bad that either they wanted out (Starbury, Jimmy Butler), were too old by the time they got here (Sam Cassell), or our front office stupidly gave them away before they hit their prime (Chauncey Billups).   Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that Terrell Brandon was a pretty nice player. Injuries just cut him down."
"The sixers also had Jimmy Butler that year, not the case anymore."
"Jimmy butler, cassell, sprewell are all better"
"Beasley+Edwards+KAT to me can be a playoff team. Obviously they aren't there yet, but I'd say in three years time if Edwards can really develop they will have an overwhelmingly good offence given Towns gravity.   In 2018 they finished 47-35 with the 4th best offence and 27th best defence to make the playoffs. Obviously they had Jimmy Butler but it was KAT powering that offence and he's a monster.  DLo is still an unknown at this point but if he gets back to all star form they are going to be an intimidating team offensively, and the right signings at the wings and 4 spot (Okogie, Vanderbilt, McDaniels have great defensive potential).  I think there's enough to work with there despite all the doom and gloom. I'm not guaranteeing anything but if you watch them play, its mainly experience holding them back, not playstyle or ability."
half the media and fans spent a month trying to take away Giannis's DPOY because he didnt guard jimmy butler so im guessing never
"Yeah, can you imagine a team with Jokic surrounded by Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and Reddick when he was actually good? That team wins the title. Embiid on the Nuggets would lose in the first round if they even made the playoffs, just like he does in Philly, especially with how many games he misses. Plus the nuggets literally have a better net rating and more expected wins than the Sixers right now, even missing 7 players and having a much harder schedule."
"Raptors dropped 2 games to the all-time Warriors, Lakers dropped 2 to Jimmy Butler and the kidz bop crew"
Lmao there isn‚Äôt a single actual player of the game basketball that thinks like this. You think the Celtics were like ‚Äúman lakers are obviously gonna win let‚Äôs just not make it to the finals to preserve our finals record‚Äù do you think Jimmy Butler is now in fact WORSE in all time rankings because he is 0-1???
"**Scenario Example:**  *You have O'Neal and Gobert back on defense. Gobert is already retreating under the rim, arms up, ready.*  Say you are the Kings; with Fox, Barnes, and Heild running the floor. Heild sprints to the corner 3, while Fox and Barnes attack. Fox is stopped by O'Neal--pass to Barnes-- who meets Gobert at the block.   Were still on a 3-2 fastbreak. Should Barnes take this contested layup or should he pass it out to Buddy Heild for a wide open 3?   What if its Jamal Murray? What if its Zach LaVine? Is Jimmy Butler hitting a trailing Duncan Robinson for a wide open 3pt still a bad shot?   **CONTEXT**"
I wouldn't went with Jimmy butler given then insane month he had but hardens cool too.
"&gt;You know damn well we don‚Äôt win the chip last year without AD   No, I don't, and neither do you.  James with those seven traded players, plus Zubac, and the best of the rest of the other 2020 Lakers is a formidable team.  James has won titles with far less help, against better opposition.  And again, Davis was not the only player the Lakers could have obtained.  They could've kept Ingram, Hunter, and most of those picks and still obtained, say, Jimmy Butler and Malcolm Brogdon.  James, Ingram, Butler, Brogdon, Zubac plus Kuzma, Caruso, McGee, Green, Caldwell-Pope and others is absolutely a title contender, if not favorite."
"Anthony Davis, jimmy butler, Charles Barkley just off the top of my head"
Jimmy Butler is probably the best example of what you are talking about.  Pretty sure he was one of the last guys off the bench his rookie year on that 1st place Bulls team.
"I‚Äôd max him no problem. If it was 14 points on average efficiency, no way, but his scoring efficiency is insanely high too.  He‚Äôs the next Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Paul George wing that takes a slow burn in development but will be one of the most impactful players in the league in his prime."
Its pretty much the same list + Jimmy Butler &amp; Westbrook  https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask?q=worst+efg%25
"BETTER THAN JIMMY BUTLER, SUCK IT NBA  RUSS WESTBROOK IS ELITE  ^^^FreeThrowPercentageYuck"
Jimmy Butler was an UFA. That‚Äôs not comparable.
"Depends.  New Orleans got 3 firsts, an All-star, another starter, and two good bench players for Davis.  Meanwhile, Jimmy Butler only cost the Heat about 1 first and Josh Richardson."
"You‚Äôre correct, but to an extent. Does anyone else remember the 2017-2018 wolves with Jimmy Butler? No I don‚Äôt blame you.  Thibs loved hedging and we would not switch if his life depended on it. Guess what, we were one of the worst teams in the league at defending the three. Which is essentially the most important thing about today‚Äôs game."
"Just so we're clear, averaging 28/6/7 on 58% TS in the playoffs as a Rocket counts as ""not showing up when it matters,"" correct?  I'd hate to see what you think of Damian Lillard or Donovan Mitchell or Jimmy Butler, then. Because they're all worse in the playoffs than Harden."
It seems like the Heat go as Jimmy goes.  The difference in how the heat look when Butler is in the lineup is very apparent IMO.
Gotta give Jimmy butler a spot. He's goofy but he doesn't take shit from anyone either. He's essentially the main character.
I read somewhere that jimmy butler is heavier than every all star guard from the 90s
Glad that the NBA cleared up that Jimmy Butler is not an all-star.
"I heard Jimmy Butler was asked, but declined."
"Again, Jimmy Butler &gt; McGrady, CP3, Carmelo, C. Webber, G. Gervin, D. Wilkins, Maravich, A. English, V. Cater, etc.  This is your logic. Not mine. Don‚Äôt be mad at me."
"I never said I agreed with him, you are the one mad right now, Prime CP3 is ofc better then butler, so are others, calm your tits  And tbh I would 100% take current Jimmy over Chris Webber and Vince Carter"
"Again, Jimmy Butler &gt; McGrady, CP3, Carmelo, C. Webber, G. Gervin, D. Wilkins, Maravich, A. English, V. Cater, etc.  This is your logic. Not mine. Don‚Äôt be mad at me."
"Jimmy Butler also had 2 top 3 finals games of all time according to game score, and Spo is a huge coaching advantage. I think we were better then a lot of people are giving us credit for"
"I guess Jimmy Butler &gt; McGrady, Carmelo, CP3, etc. then"
"&gt;It's not even a question that he is a max contract player, he is an all nba all defense perennial all star, and every single gm would give him the max if they had the chance.  bad ones, yes they would. why od you think morey was trying to unload him for harden?  &gt;The last time Ben was in the playoffs they were 4 bounce shot away from beating the champs.  because they had jimmy fuckkng butler and Joel embiid lol"
Jimmy Butler was a bigger reason than Thibs. You take that same team and remove Butler and I doubt he coaches them to the playoffs.
Jimmy Butler has a very slim chance: 20/8/8 and only 21 games played
"Kawhi Leonard (before he was a Raptor), now it's Jimmy Butler"
"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d‚Äôanglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been this many players with a legit chance of making the all star game ever."
idk if id want Jimmy Butler guarding AD. Yea its feasible depending on the matchup but seem teams do play bigger forwards. Tatum is more of a stretch 4 anyway tbh
Does Jimmy Butler slide to the SF position and you bring Robinson off the bench?
"&gt;Jimmy Butler might be the most under appreciated guy in the NBA. What a fucking player    Just about everyone loves and respects Jiimbo.. He's tough as nails, and the type of player any CONTENDING team would want on their side. He brings far more than just talent  &gt;  Dude's a superstar and a big game player. A great leader  &gt;  BUT.. he is also very inconsistent, on the offensive end.  He can turn into a Playoff LeBron-lite, but also can become Michael Kidd-Gilchrist a few games later.    Almost every player, even most of the ""superstars"".. are never that consistent or efficient offensively.  But Jimmy can REALLY struggle with his shooting, and the Heat doesn't have anyone else to cover his offensive load"
"Maybe Jimmy Butler in Minnesota. Not for exactly the same reasons, but the same very public expression of wanting out"
I love Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler is MVP worthy Player who doesn't get respected enough   Chicago Bulls were considered a playoff team with him   Minnesota went to the playoffs with him  76ers were a bounce away from an NBA finals   Led Miami heat to the Nba finals the first year with them  Has not missed the playoffs his entire career
guess jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt exist
"Jimmy's stat-line tonight was gaudy - but he normally doesn't have 30+ point games which means people typically gloss over him. I get why it happens, hell, I prolly would have been one of the people who'd do it - but when you ask a ""Paul George or Jimmy Butler"" question 5 months ago, people said it was over, [Jimmy won.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ituqxj/its_over_jimmy_butler_is_better_than_paul_george/)  [Yet as recently as 6 days ago, most people over-whelmingly took PG13 and Tatum over Jimmy.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/loc9c6/start_bench_cut_jayson_tatum_jimmy_butler_paul/)  I really believe that we can beat any team in the East(minus Brooklyn) if we're healthy in a playoff series with him at the helm."
"I'll explain it for you since you had trouble  Starters are voted in by fans  KD has a much larger fan base than Jimmy Butler  So, YOU CAN ASSUME that KD will get more votes and the all star starter spot  Hope that helps you out"
"Game on the line, the ball in one player's hand.      There's only a few with the audacity and the capability to take and make the shot.      Jimmy ""not James"" Butler is one of them - and it's great to have him on my team!"
"13-8 with Jimmy, 3-9 without him. It's very clear that the Heat are a good team if Butler is in the lineup. And even better if Dragic is healthy as well"
Is jimmy butler KD
Jimmy butler not being an allstar is a joke man. Put the best players in the allstar game.
"Jesus, Jimmy Butler shoots so many free throws, it's unreal. Worse than Harden on the Rockets"
Jimmy Butler might be the most under appreciated guy in the NBA. What a fucking player
Jimmy Butler gonna be the first player to win MVP without being an all star... crazy !
Jimmy Butler free throw shooting exhibition ü•±üò¥
"Timberwolves playoff wins since 2005, 1. Jimmy Butler Finals wins in 2020, 2. Going all in on Youth and their young core got them nothing, Lavine was a 3rd option in Minny coming off an ACL tear that one season of Jimmy was the best that franchise has had in a long ass time."
Jimmy Butler is very good at basketball
Jimmy Butler free throw shooting exhibition ü•±üò¥
"I mean, like that Harden team that forced Durant Warriors to 7 games? Or 7 games against an eventual WCF team like Nuggets? Your team got bounced by LeBron, and Jimmy Butler, are you mad Spo didn‚Äôt give your team any props? I would rather take a respected champion coach opinion than someone whose never played in the league for close to 20 years, and drafted Kwame Brown with the first pick. You gotta give credits when it‚Äôs due."
But the heat pick had huge value because everyone thought the heat were  gonna suck by then. That‚Äôs why the heat cut us in on the jimmy butler deal and gave us another pick just to get that deal done and Mo Harkless for literally nothing.   That 2021 heat pick went on a god damn journey
Horrible take. There's no argument that could be made that Sabonis is better than Jimmy Butler.
"Yes he should and would. Certain things don‚Äôt apply to superstars in the league. Things like getting a max contract while being guaranteed out due to injury the first year of that contract would never in a million years happen to Jimmy Butler.   Point is, shit like all star selections are always gonna come to that highest level of players. Kobe, lebron, Durant will get votes regardless of their overall contribution that season cause they have really earned the rep"
"Again you name a player levels below Durant. Obviously teams are better with all stars. No one talks about KDs games missing cause he is just better and that isn‚Äôt a difference maker in him making the all star team. When a player is worse and there‚Äôs a debate as to if he will make it or not, the missed games become a lot more relevant. It‚Äôs not relevant in KDs case cause he‚Äôs so good he would never be left anyway  All star isn‚Äôt just about who is having the best seasons. If lebron played 1 game all year and was healthy for the ASG he would be a starter. There‚Äôs levels of stardom in the league and Durant is right at the top. Comparing him to Jimmy Butler just cause they missed the same number of games is nonsense. And I fucking hate Durant"
"When Lynn was drafted/undrafted/came into the NBA, he had a better lateral, 3/4 quart sprint, and benchpress then Derrick Rose John Wall and Russell Westbrook. The man was incredibly athletic but‚Ä¶ He lacked a vertical wingspan and skin melanin  By the way‚Ä¶ Jimmy Butler is probably the most athletic player drafted in the last 10 years off his combine statistics don‚Äôt @ me"
Jimmy Butler is NOT kevin Durant. You‚Äôre talking about a top 3 player compared to a top like 15 cmon
"k so i shoulda said Embiid or like last year Jimmy Butler instead huh since we‚Äôre going by %  of FT ü•∏  traes averaging 1 more FTA per game than last year i think. just a stupid narrative, he does nothing differently   also idc if you foul bait, 27/10 deserve the all star game every single time lol. was some whack shit when Beal was gettin snubbed last year too"
"Hollingers all star picks are terrible, his article in the athletic about Jimmy Butler is probably the worst thing he‚Äôs ever put out. Contradictory and cherry picked stats to make it seem like Butler deserved it when he‚Äôs missed a massive chunk of the season"
"I'm thinking KAT and a solid wing defender and playmaker like Jimmy Butler would really let lavines talent shine, but Andrew Wiggins would be nice to pair him with too if he promises to work really hard"
Jimmy Butler not even top 75 talent.
Bam and Jimmy Butler didn't. They deserve it over Randle and Sabonis
"If Jimmy Butler decided to sign with the Clippers instead of Miami, imagine how dominant the Clippers would have been, and how good their future would be. They would not trade Gallo, SGA, and all of their draft picks for PG13.   Could of possibly been a lineup of:  SGA/Butler/Kawhi/Gallo/Ibaka or Zubac."
Jimmy Butler

Jokic and Horford are both 10 for 18, AD is 12 for 26, and Reggie Jackson is a scorching 2 for 28."
"Lillard/Jimmy Butler is about where I start to think about taking the youngsters. If its Zion/Luka/Giannis/Embiid/Jokic thats probably a pass for me. I‚Äôm taking Lebron/KD/Curry/Harden/Kawhi too despite age, just too good."
"I think it‚Äôs actually stuff that happened in the summer of 2019 that in my opinion really broke the camel‚Äôs back. That was the summer AD demanded a trade to the Lakers from small market New Orleans while he was still under contract with the Pelicans, PG demanded a trade while under contract from small market OKC to go live in LA with his buddy Kawhi, who himself left Toronto to go live in LA despite winning a championship. Then you had KD and Kyrie randomly teaming up in Brooklyn, and then suddenly the Warriors had D‚ÄôLo. Jimmy Butler was for some reason on the Heat now. And Westbrook, who was considered one of those players that we thought would be retiring with his organization, was traded to a contender for CP3, who was also unhappy in Houston.  For some reason, stars in this league are just always unhappy in their situations, despite the stars in this league having more power than other leagues. It‚Äôs also brought on by the culture of how the media and fans cover the NBA, which is so narrative and drama driven. Free Agency is an event in itself, which is good for the social media interactions but bad for the league viewership.     33% of this league is about interesting storylines. 33% of it is about waiting for the playoffs because the regular season doesn‚Äôt matter. And other 33% is about laughing at chokers and encouraging ringchasing. This is the bed the NBA made, and now they‚Äôre letting the players run their league."
"Give me Trae, Shai, Jimmy Butler, Sabonis, and KAT"
"Just build the appropriate team around any top 10ish player and they could win a championship. Most people consider Jimmy Butler to be worse than Dame, and with a little bit more luck he could be a champion right now.   Only someone like LeBron truly stands higher than the rest."
There‚Äôs a universe or timeline where Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler brought multiple rings to Chicago together.
Jimmy Butler is the only great trash talker today tbh
"Jimmy is an extremely capable and comfortable mid-range shooter, and Drummond basically let Jimmy walk to his desired spot and rise up for a FT line jumper in rhythm. That is a good shot, and Drummond didn't get close to bothering his release.  You can say it was a win since Butler didn't get a wide open layup, if you're desperate, but this is close to the best look Butler could've had on this play, for the least amount of effort."
Jimmy Butler was 11/2.
"I don't think Jimmy Butler contributed to his legacy one way or the other tbh. Reaching the finals is a nice achievement, but he still lost."
&gt;has a losing record in the finals  This dumbass argument again. Do you think that Jimmy Butler hurt his legacy by leading his team to a six game loss in last year's finals? Should he have lost in the first round to prevent a finals loss from being on his record?

"U.S.-China tensions, human rights and business are once again meeting uncomfortably on the basketball court.  In China, local brands are prospering from a consumer backlash against Nike, H&amp;M and other foreign brands over their refusal to use Chinese cotton made by forced labor. Chinese brands have publicly embraced the cotton from the Xinjiang region, leading to big sales to patriotic shoppers and praise from the Beijing-controlled media.  In the United States, two of those same Chinese brands, Li-Ning and Anta, adorn the feet of N.B.A. players ‚Äî and those players are being rewarded handsomely for it. Two players reached endorsement deals with Anta in February. Another signed on this week. Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors already had a shoe deal with Anta that has been widely reported to be valued at up to $80 million.  Dwyane Wade, the three-time N.B.A. champion and retired Miami Heat player, has a clothing line with Li-Ning that is so successful he has recruited young players for the brand.  Like the foreign brands in China, the league and its players could soon feel themselves squeezed between Washington and Beijing. Western companies are being pressured by American officials and lawmakers to respond to accusations of genocide in Xinjiang. But they face a consumer-driven backlash in China, where celebrities have severed ties with brands like Burberry and patriotic citizens have burned their Nike shoes on social media.  The N.B.A. and its athletes are familiar with the challenges of trying to stand up to China and maintain access to its nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Just two years ago, China exiled the N.B.A. from state media channels after the general manager of the Houston Rockets supported pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.  The league has so far avoided the latest round of controversy. That may not last for long.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine celebrities and brand ambassadors being able to walk this line between those negative views of China in their home countries and the increasingly clear demands in China to publicly demonstrate the use of products made in Xinjiang,‚Äù said Natasha Hassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.   The Chinese companies themselves are unlikely to take a significant hit. The United States banned imports of products made from Xinjiang cotton in January, but neither Li-Ning nor Anta sells large numbers of shoes there. (They are available online, however.) Still, their full-throated support of Xinjiang could have reputational consequences for the American athletes.  ‚ÄúIt is a simpler proposition for a Chinese celebrity to say I‚Äôm going to end my ties with X European company and probably be rewarded domestically for it,‚Äù Ms. Hassam said. ‚ÄúAmericans looking to profit off China‚Äôs market find themselves in a much more challenging place.‚Äù       After Li-Ning and Anta published positive statements on Xinjiang cotton last week, investors in China sent the share price of both companies soaring. Chinese state media was quick to fuel the show of patriotism. At one point, a pair of Li-Ning shoes under Mr. Wade‚Äôs Way of Wade line traded for nearly $7,500.  But the statements could invite regulatory scrutiny on future business operations in the United States, said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer specializing in sanctions at Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered.  ‚ÄúBy speaking out, Anta and Li Ning are simultaneously supporting the Chinese government and thumbing their noses at U.S. restrictions, which is a combination unlikely to be greeted warmly by U.S. authorities,‚Äù Mr. Fleming said.  Anta and Li-Ning did not respond to requests for comment.  Mr. Thompson, one of the N.B.A.‚Äôs biggest stars, is known as ‚ÄúChina Klay‚Äù to his Chinese fans and once said he wanted to be the Michael Jordan of Anta. His teammate James Wiseman, as well as Alex Caruso of the Los Angeles Lakers, signed with Anta earlier this year, according to the sportswear brand‚Äôs social media account. Precious Achiuwa of the Heat announced this week that he was joining Anta.  Requests for comment from Mr. Thompson and other N.B.A. players also went unanswered.  Outside China, Xinjiang has become synonymous with repression. Reports suggest as many as one million Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic minorities have been held in detention camps. In March, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused China of continuing to ‚Äúcommit genocide and crimes against humanity‚Äù in the far northwestern region.  The N.B.A. has powerful reasons to keep quiet on China. When Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, voiced his support for the Hong Kong protests on Twitter in 2019, Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Credit Card Center paused their partnerships with the team. The Chinese Basketball Association, whose president is the former Rockets player Yao Ming, also suspended its cooperation with the Rockets.  Mr. Morey deleted the message.  Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, later said that the Chinese government had asked the league to fire Mr. Morey, a claim that the Chinese Foreign Ministry quickly denied. But the incident left a scar on the N.B.A.‚Äôs reputation for supporting free speech and severely limited its access to the Chinese market.  China Central Television, the state-run television network, stopped broadcasting N.B.A. games after Mr. Morey‚Äôs message on Twitter. Late last year, it briefly resumed coverage for Games 5 and 6 of the N.B.A. finals. A week later, Mr. Morey stepped down as general manager.  In a radio interview this week, Mr. Silver said that CCTV had stopped airing N.B.A. games again, but that fans could stream them through Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate. He said that the N.B.A.‚Äôs partnership with China was ‚Äúcomplicated,‚Äù but that ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt speak up about what we see are, you know, things in China that are inconsistent with our values.‚Äù  A spokesman for the league declined to comment for this article.   Money and a large China fan base are at stake for players like Mr. Thompson and the dozens of other American athletes who have been heavily promoted by Anta and Li-Ning. Mr. Thompson has had a partnership with Anta since 2014 that has given him a popular shoe line and sponsored tours in China.  More recent deals between the companies and N.B.A. players could face questions in coming weeks as tensions between the United States and China escalate. Jimmy Butler, a five-time all-star who plays for the Heat, and the Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet signed on with Li-Ning in November. Mr. Wade, the retired Heat player, helped CJ McCollum and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, two star guards, secure deals with Li-Ning through his sportswear line.  ‚ÄúMy decision 7 years ago to sign with Li-Ning was to show the next generation that it‚Äôs not just one way of doing things,‚Äù Mr. Wade wrote on Twitter when he announced Mr. Russell‚Äôs contract in November 2019. ‚ÄúI had a chance to build a Global platform that gives future athletes a canvas to create and be expressive.‚Äù"
jimmy butler is the only dude i could imagine doing that
jimmy butler is not from the chi lol
Cornrow Jimmy butler with headband
It seems like Jimmy Butler flirts with 30 points in every single game this season.
"Look I love Jimmy as a player and the hustle he has, but I think it‚Äôs a little unfair on how this sub always complains about Harden and Embiid going to the line so much, but it‚Äôs always crickets for Butler regarding Free Throws."
"His defense is definitely not worse then dame‚ÄôsüòÇ that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying you don‚Äôt watch games. If you say his defense is worse then dame‚Äôs idk what to tell you.  I agree with your list up till embiid. I‚Äôd put luka better then him as well. Jimmy butler it‚Äôs a debate, a lot of players had flukes last year because of the bubble and this year is showing that."
Lebron Steph KD AD Giannis Harden  Dame Jokic Kawhi Embiid Gobert Luka Simmons Bradley Beal Jimmy Butler Bam Adebayo Klay Booker Tatum Ingram Randle CP3 Zion? Mitchell? Westbrook? PG? Jrue?  There's hella dudes you're going to have to convince me he's better than. And that's just off the top of my head
Jimmy Butler is 6'5
Jimmy Butler did the same thing earlier
Wow Spo might be high with that shit having Jimmy Butler and Dragic on his team
Siakam is so trash at shooting. If the Bulls still had Jimmy Butler/Deng he would be shut down in the paint as well.
"We got sent home because our defence was total ass mostly and the entire Heat team took turns torching the shit out of us. If Jimmy Butler counts as an elite passer or top tier decision maker, most if not teams OP listed have one of those."
Jimmy Butler hitting pull up 3s give me a fucking break
Jimmy Butler confirmed the same on a podcast he did. He said KD would light him up when he was younger. He would just shoot a jumpshot over Jimmy and then say things like ‚Äúnice d‚Äù while running back.
"Imagine if that MJ/Grant story about MJ not letting him eat,occurred now? Lmaoo. All the discussions surrounding that after the documentary was a taste of what MJ playing in the social media era would be like. Non stop drama  MJs style and personal habits fit well with his era. Jimmy Butler got heavily criticized for being ‚Äúa bully‚Äù and had to take Miami to the finals just for people to start viewing him in a positive light again"
"The Heat are 1.8 points per 100 possessions worse than the Jazz, in a much weaker conference, with Jimmy Butler as a wing defender. Sure it's nice that Bam is versatile, but Gobert has higher defensive upside because he impacts more actions that you probably wouldn't even notice, and only the elite players can really score on him consistently. He's not a liability against guards anymore unless it's like Curry, and CP3 is his kryptonite because the Jazz allow the mid range"
A chance to be the first option guaranteed.  Maybe Miami falls off.  Maybe players don't like Jimmy Butler. People said the same thing about the Clippers and Lakers and Kawhi went to the Clippers.  Some players like the market but not the spotlight.
"Nah we didn't really know that about wiggins.  He had a nice upward trajectory from year 1 through year 3.  He was at 24 ppg on league avg efficiency before getting that max contract extension , but then it all went to shit .  He got significantly worse (everyone has a different person to blame: some blame Thibs, some blame Jimmy butler, some blame wiggins himself) , and only recently is he back to about where he was in Year 3 .    He just stagnated early in his career when the expectation was for him to make that leap to stardom"
"You could say this about MJ,Kobe,Jimmy Butler, exc you could say that about a lot of guys"
"Na, lebron and kawhi raise their game too. Same with guys like jimmy butler"
"Whats with the disrespect to Kawhi on social medias outside of reddit??  Ive seen stuff like ""hes just a very good role player, nothing more"", as usual heat fans recently commenting on him hurting the culture if he were to join..., after jimmy butler the supposed ""locker room cancer"" leading them to finals and letting harden go to the nets, how do these people still repeat this bullshit?? people also say that he is an unenthusiastic player and doesn't play with passion, these comments also always have tons of likes somehow.  Is Kawhi not as good as i think he is, or are these people idiots?"
"&gt; It‚Äôs a shame people don‚Äôt take things like that into factor because if mj or pippen were out for a season theres no way they win that year  I feel like people do realize that, the difference is when they *were* healthy they came through, something Durant and WB didnt.   In game 7 against the Pistons in 1990 they probably win if it wasnt for Pippens migraine.  When MJ went to baseball and the season he came back in the middle when they lost to the Magic is seen as showing that they needed each other at full strength.    Had they pulled it off in 16 things would 100% be different but they didnt and neither has had success thus far outside of a superteam for KD(and now another one).   WB should be able to will his team deeper in the playoffs imo if he was as great as his reg season numbers suggest.  Even a Jimmy Butler or Kawhi has shown the ability to really elevate and carry a team in the postseason, something I dont think WB can do."
"He played Jimmy Butler, the Jazz and the Warriors in 17-18. The Jazz and the Warriors in 18-19 and the Thunder (Dort) and Lakers in 19-20.   I still think his performance in 18-19 is underrated because of how it ended (CP3 had an aberration down year and the fact that the Rockets were even with the KD Warriors was insane).   He definitely seems to draw less 3 point fouls and has to go to the ISO game on more and more possessions."
"I know a couple die hard Spurs fans who did not want to sign LMA from Portland. Said the dude's never been a winner and doesn't do the little things that lead to victories.  Unfortunately, timing wasn't great and he was just the best available big man that summer. Marc Gasol was a year older at 32.   Actually, the one FA my buddies wanted was Jimmy Buckets who was entering his prime. Could you imagine a future of Butler and Kawhi?"
That looked like every Jimmy butler buzzer beater attempt
"I dont think its fair to call a 20 year old a not really star. We dont know how good rj can be. His most common comparisons are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, Demar Derozan. Look at those guys at 20 years old. Of course situations are different but I think RJs production at 20 years old is way to much for him to be writen off over near 25 year olds who haven't even been close to making an allstar game. 18-22 is perfectly fine for RJ and might even be a little too high"
Can‚Äôt tell if Rudy hurt or pulling a Jimmy Butler sell job
Embiid had jimmy butler who carried a team to the finals as the first option and still couldn‚Äôt make it out the second round.
"I didn't like RJ Barrett's style in college, and he hasn't been good in the league yet, but....  He has shown improvement in his game and his body. Once he fills out, He is gonna be living at the line (jimmy butler style).   And he is an underrated passer"
"Yeah they did a sign and trade to get Jimmy butler, but because of that they had to stay under the the luxury tax, like you said  There‚Äôs only three things that trigger the hard cap, it‚Äôs getting a sign and trade player, using the BAE, or using the non-tax payer MLE"
at least we beat the goat. yall beat butler of jimmy and bums
"A superstar isn't a superstar for just one year  Besides this year, he has done jack shit since 2017 finals, besides shooting the celtics out of the playoffs  And he played alot alongside Harden and the whole team has good offense, defenses can't focus on him  I'm not taking him over any of the players I mentioned, plus a couple like Luka, Dame, AD, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal  Out of the players in my original comment and the ones I mentioned now, who tf is Kyrie better than?"
The Jimmy Butler Timberwolves route. He'll beat you with the third stringers if he has to.
"Embiid, Harden, Trae, and Jimmy Butler line-up is the thing of nightmares"
"&gt; The Celtics have made the ECF in 3 of the last 4 years. The one time they didn't was when he was healthy.  I do want to point out that that was also the one year (before this one) where the East had a bunch of genuinely great teams. Toronto, of course, but also the Jimmy Butler Sixers and the Bucks meant that Boston wouldn't have nearly as easy a path to the ECF that year as they did the other times.   I feel like if Boston had played the Cavs in the 2nd round in 2017 they'd have lost (since they lost to them in the CF anyway). In 2018 if they'd had to face either Cleveland or Toronto in the 2nd round they'd have lost that as well. And I also believe they'd have lost to either Milwaukee or Miami in the 2nd round in the bubble.   I think favorable seeding/matchups helped the Celtics a lot in their 3 ECF years, and that while the Kyrie season was extremely disappointing, a bigger factor was that they couldn't simply avoid the top tier teams until the CF like the other years."
Jimmy Butler is a top 10 player when it matters the most
Did you just say Jimmy Butler is better than Anthony Davis?
mf said Jimmy Butler lmao
More like a mild take.    Jimmy Butler can turn into a consistent top 6 player in the playoffs and in general he belongs in the top 10 because of the way he has played in the playoffs and his leadership qualities.
"But the prevailing opinion is that the Heat were a fluke, and that's the opinion that will likely persist. The narrative will be that Jimmy Butler led a team to the NBA finals that had no business even making it past the second round of the playoffs. No one will remember that ""wait, but the Heat were actually really good""."
Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt top 20
"But Embiid is *factually* easier to stop on plays where he isn‚Äôt fouled (see FG% at every distance but 16ft-3pt), so that doesn‚Äôt add up. I‚Äôm not saying Jokic should be getting more calls than Joel, only that it should be closer, like 10 vs 8 (same as Jimmy Butler), not 12 vs 4.5 like it is now. And that if it were closer, the gap in ‚Äústopability‚Äù that already exists between them would only widen in Jokic‚Äôs favor. He‚Äôs already a considerably more impactful offensive player even with the foul discrepancy.     By equivalent whistles I mean equal definitions of what constitutes a foul, not an equal number of calls."
Jimmy Butler is a top 7 NBA player. Both advanced stats and his recent playoff performance back this up yet he is never placed in the top 10
"The only eligible 6-time All-stars not in the Hall are:  Amar'e Stoudamire, Jermaine O'Neal, Shawn Kemp, Jimmy Jones, Lou Hudson, Walter Davis, and Larry Costello.  All eligible 7+ time All-stars are in the Hall, save one -- Larry Foust was an 8-time All-star and remains on the outside, looking in.  A bunch of 5-time All-stars are in, as well, like Gail Goodrich, Gus Johnson, Reggie Miller, and Maurice Lucas.  So Butler is virtually guaranteed if he makes two more All-star games, and has a very good chance with only one more.  If he retired today, his induction would not be out-of-the-question."
He wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmostly reliable‚Äù though. He was close to 50/50 hit or miss with his predictions. The things he got wrong were just swept under the rug.  Everyone has already forgotten that he said Jimmy Butler was coming to the Lakers before he said Kawhi was.
"I don‚Äôt agree that you only have to hide Simmons shooting and that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt get across to you. So many people think bens issue is just he can‚Äôt shoot. It‚Äôs not just that. He cannot drive to the rim cause his handle is below avg and he can‚Äôt finish through contact. When you combine that with a complete inability to shoot, you have a serious serious issue on your hands. Way more of an issue than traes defense. Cause now ben is almost useless if he doesn‚Äôt have the ball in his hands in the half court and if he does have the ball in his hands you are still insanely limited cause his driving game is so weak. Not only will he not shoot wide open shots but he wont drive either and make the defense collapse on him consistently cause he simply can‚Äôt do it. So what do you do with him in the playoffs? You make him primary ball handler and your team will never go anywhere. You admit defeat and make someone like jimmy butler primary ball handler and ben becomes nearly useless on offense maybe even negative if he‚Äôs paired up with a center like embiid.q"
"So for reference my family has had season tickets since fall 2017 and i have seen a significant amount of Brett browns coaching style live and from decently close (not trying to flex just adding the context that I‚Äôve seen a lot of the way they play up close and personal through bretts playoff years).  Brett was really good at developing young players and getting guys to move the ball and run efficient actions, but he was legitimately dogshit at what I call tactical awareness.  How to abuse a mismatch, how to rotate players correctly, when to stem a run with a timeout, how to ensure that your players are fitting together correctly, he was legitimately awful at.  There were times in 2017 he would trot these process level lineups out only for leads to evaporate and Embiid or Simmons would have to come back in and fight uphill.  Roster construction was certainly not good last year, but Brett still had 3 pretty different sets of players over 3 seasons and the team still turned the ball over at a high rate, didn‚Äôt look for shots over the first 10 seconds of the clock, and would let leads evaporate.  Often times we would have a sequence of fantastic basketball only to never go back to that action, or fail to consistently abuse certain mismatches.  He also did not hold anyone accountable (you can hear Jimmy Butler talk about this in JJs podcast) to the point at which his last season here player attitudes just showed that they didn‚Äôt give a fuck about what Brett was saying.  I think Brett was a great stop gap for taking the young guys and showing them how to win, but he was too tactically deficient to get them over the hump.  Morey is def a factor as he immediately turned the roster into the best version of the 2017 Sixers (Seth&gt;JJ, Danny&gt;RoCo, Tobias&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Saric), but the driving factor is doc actually holding these guys accountable and having all of the players play to their strengths."
Jimmy Butler
"Julius Randle is shooting upwards of 40% from three this year, up from under 28% his first full year. Aside from this, I agree. Jimmy Butler is highly effective despite not being a strong 3 point shooter as well. You can be efficient and effective without shooting the 3."
Remember when the Heat had no cap space two years ago? Remember when the Heat got Jimmy Butler two years ago?
I think Jimmy Butler should be in the conversation.
"&gt; The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   That's a result of a salary cap system where you have four players taking up $130 million in annual salary, with a salary cap that is only $109 million.  The league is literally set up to make sure it becomes impossible to effectively construct a winning roster over many years. It's the sole reason why we do not have perpetual dynasties in the NBA.   &gt;They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn‚Äôt get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  I mean, the only pass that isn't a clearly good pass there is Jimmy Buttler, and with his history of ""locker room issues"", that's hardly something you can blame them for. I'm not sure anyone other than Pat Riley could have gotten him on the right track.   &gt;He‚Äôs never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who‚Äôs the risk?   AD has absolutely been an MVP candidate.  Neither KAT nor AD are risks, but I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that AD is significantly more valuable than KAT.   &gt;Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That‚Äôs sad.  Of course it is. One ring is obviously *much* more important to a franchise that has never won one. Only 19 of the 30 teams in the NBA has ever won a championship. 10 out of 30 has won more than one.  Winning *a ring* should be the number one priority for almost every team in the league, without question.   &gt;Part of the Lakers ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Yeah, good thing they never shafted someone like Shaq.   Oh, wait.  &gt;Oh and you know who cited Thomas‚Äô situation as a reason he didn‚Äôt want to be in Boston? AD.   He sure did, but literally everyone knew his only destination was the Lakers. He also pretended like he was interested in Knicks, like literally every single major free agent player does. And none of them *actually* have any intentions to play there.  It's almost as if the publicly released statements celebrities make aren't always the truth.  Almost.  &gt;How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ?   So you're talking about *the one time* Krause actually said *organizations win championships, not players*? The statement which Krause clearly and sensibly explained in a rational matter literally the next day.  &gt;At this point dude, you‚Äôre in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye.  I'm not in denial, you're just trying to argue revisionist history like you're on the Fox News editorial staff."
Jimmy Butler. I love me some buckets
It was really just being without Jimmy Butler for an extended period at the beginning of the season. That's the entire story.
"The offense being designed one way does not reflect on the roster clearly. The biggest issue they have is how poorly fitting the roster is for how they want to play.   They also passed on Myles Turner this summer. They passed on Jimmy Butler. Didn‚Äôt get Vuc. Passed on CP3 in 2013. Paul George on the Pacers. Kevin love in 2014. I mean seriously should I go on?  He‚Äôs never been a serious MVP candidate. Has been a gem on a bad team never winning anything in the playoffs and has injury concerns. Now, am I talking about KAT or AD? Who‚Äôs the risk?   Counting old rings as a reason to avoid risk? That‚Äôs sad. Guess we should just stop trying to win cause we won some titles a few years ago and be happy with it. No wonder you‚Äôre so against being aggressive with trades. You rest on your laurels.   Part of the Lakers ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is how well they treat their stars dude. If the Lakers shafted Kobe it absolutely makes stars second guess the org.   Oh and you know who cited Thomas‚Äô situation as a reason he didn‚Äôt want to be in Boston? AD.   How did the bulls shaft MJ? Are you fucking serious? Do you not remember how the late 90s went for him vs the org ? At this point dude, you‚Äôre in straight denial. Read your last paragraph. Then read it 10 more times. Goodbye."
You can use it as an indicator because you need something to guessimate off of but it doesn't actually have any value. For example Jimmy Butler is a 85% free throw shooter but a 21% 3 point shooter.

Jimmy Butler is the best guard.
"Hayward chose to leave for a bigger role in Charlotte. It sucks, but it is what it is. Free agents get to go where they want, and unfortunately he was never healthy for us when it mattered. I'm sure the 76ers would've loved to have kept Jimmy Butler, but it wasn't in your control either."
"Awesome post dude, really like how you addressed the issues with the stat while also making key observations about how to read the data.  Really cool to see that this does absolutely establish how Curry's impact on the Warriors this season.       Hopefully you don't mind but I decided to post this ranked table for total differential.        |Rank|Team|Player|Total Differential| --:|:--|:--|--:| |1|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|**17.6**| |2|LA Lakers|LeBron James|**15.2**| |3|Philadelphia 76ers|Joel Embiid|**14.7**| |4|Utah Jazz|Rudy Gobert|**14.4**| |5|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|**12.2**| |6|LA Clippers|Paul George|**11.0**| |7|LA Clippers|Kawhi Leonard|**10.7**| |8|Minnesota Timberwolves|Karl-Anthony Towns|**10.7**| |9|Brooklyn Nets|Kevin Durant|**9.8**| |10|Denver Nuggets|Nikola Jokic|**9.8**| |11|Miami Heat|Jimmy Butler|**9.5**| |12|LA Lakers|Anthony Davis|**8.4**| |13|Atlanta Hawks|Trae Young|**8.1**| |14|Houston Rockets|Christian Wood|**7.9**| |15|Toronto Raptors|Pascal Siakam|**7.9**| |16|Detroit Pistons|Jerami Grant|**7.8**| |17|Brooklyn Nets|Kyrie Irving|**7.5**| |18|Boston Celtics|Jason Tatum|**7.4**| |19|Miami Heat|Bam Adebayo|**6.6**| |20|New York Knicks|Julius Randle|**6.1**| |21|Dallas Mavericks|Luka Doncic|**6.0**|"
Gives me goosebumps. Wish Jimmy butler was still a 76er :(
Jimmy butler got ejected two years ago against the nets because Jared Dudley shoved embiid so Jimmy shoved Dudley
"You're right, I'm just saying there are plenty of examples of guys who went on to be great players after having disappointing rookie years. Dirk, Harden, Kobe, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Paul George, Giannis, Gobert, Gordon Hayward, ect. Are all examples of guys who had sub par rookie years and went on to be great players. If Wiseman still plays like this 3 years from now, then you can call him a bust. I'm just saying give the kid time."
Do you remember where you were when Philly won a title? I wasn‚Äôt alive like 90% of the people this sub. Literally no one gives a fuck lmao. Bum ass team couldn‚Äôt even get out the second round with Jimmy Butler carrying your asses. Celebrating like you won a tittle beating the Celtics tonight when they swept your ass a few months ago. Gtfo.
"Rodman is insane, dirty, and assaulted a camera man  Garnett is my all time least favorite player other than Pedo Malone. He was a dick to everyone, even mocking Tim Duncan's dead mother on mothers day  Lamar Odom was a criminal that would do anything to make money  Metta World Peace is insane and tried to murder James Harden   Iggy is a really good guy, no problems with him  Rondo is an arrogant bitch and a stain on the Celtics history  Jimmy Butler is fine  Magic Johnson is one of my favorite players, but also one of my team's biggest rivals   If he replaced Butler and Iggy with Karl Malone and Blake Griffin this would be my all time least favorite players list"
We‚Äôre a Jimmy Butler away from the championship.
"1-10  Steph Curry, D Rose, Joakim Noah, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan,  Zach Lavine,  Russel Westbrook, Dennis Rodman"
1. Gary Payton  2. Russell Westbrook  3. Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf  4. God Shammgod  5. Magic Johnson  6. Steve Nash  7. Jimmy Butler  8. Donovan Mitchell  9. Delaney Rudd  10. Kareem Abdul Jabbar
"Rodman, Garnett, Lamar Odom, Metta World Peace, Jimmy Butler, Iggy, Zbo, Rondo, Magic johnson"
Can‚Äôt wait to see ‚ÄúBruce Dewayne‚Äù Dedmon play with Jimmy ‚ÄúAlfred‚Äù Butler. When ‚Äúthe joker‚Äù Jokic is in town shits gonna get wild.
They did have Jimmy Butler lol. You nephews just started watching too recently. Message me if you want to learn more about the history of this league.
They did need Jimmy Butler. They needed him so incredibly badly that he couldn‚Äôt stand it there. Need a few more just like him lol.
Or like Jimmy Butler?
"Yeah that‚Äôs accurate that it‚Äôs rare, especially if you win rookie of the year. It‚Äôs also only been around since 1986. The superstar winners would probably be Tracy McGrady, Kevin Love, Paul George, Jimmy Butler and Giannis."
"These are the guys I consider to be the elite elite defenders in the league. Could be missing a couple:  1. Ben Simmons 2. Rudy Gobert 3. Draymond Green 4. Anthony Davis 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Bam Adebayo 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Jrue Holiday 9. Marcus Smart 10. Jimmy Butler 11. Lebron James 12. Mikal Bridges 13. Joel Embiid 14. Robert Covington 15. DeJounte Murray 16. OG Anunoby 17. Myles Turner  I think Marcus Smart has been tangibly worse this season and couple of those next 5 guys have been little better, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
"&gt;AD had several playoff runs before getting traded to LA.  No, he did not.  The Pelicans made the playoffs twice in Davis' seven seasons there -- as #6 and #8 seeds.  They won 5 games total, and never had ""several runs"".  &gt;Why even mention Butler? He was clearly set on Miami and reports said that he didn't want to play with Lebron.    [Reports before Butler signed](https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/05/27/jimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james/) in Miami were that the Lakers were at least high on his list.  [Others said Butler has always wanted to be a Laker.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843129-lakers-rumors-free-agent-target-jimmy-butler-has-always-wanted-to-play-for-la)  Some [said he would definitely sign in Los Angeles, if offered.](https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/1131719730845237248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131719730845237248&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Flebronwire.usatoday.com%2F2019%2F05%2F27%2Fjimmy-butler-would-reportedly-like-playing-with-lebron-james%2F)  After going to Miami, Butler has denied considering Los Angeles... but Butler says all manner of things that are not true.  &gt; The lakers missed out on countless superstar free agents and you're focusing on Butler?   Because they could've had him for peanuts compared to the cost to rent Davis.  He's not the only player they could've gotten, just one of many.  &gt; A rental implies that AD's tenure with LA would be temporary.   Which it precisely was.  Davis was an unrestricted free agent in December 2020.  Do you understand what those words mean?  He was not under contract to play for the Lakers, and only did so in 2021 because they recruited and signed him.  Exactly as they would've had to do, and could've done, had they never traded for him.  &gt; AD signed a long term deal and stayed.   As an unrestricted free agent, who could've gone anywhere -- and if he had, would've destroyed the Lakers chances for most of this decade.  Even with him signing a new contract -- and chronically injured -- their chances are not very good.  All of that is exactly because they massively overpaid to rent him for one season, when they did not need to."
Jimmy Butler is related to Michael Jordan
"Please reread what I said. I‚Äôm not saying he doesn‚Äôt get fouled. I‚Äôm saying the way in which he avoids the contact is not conducive to getting calls in the current NBA. You have to be intentionally sense to not see the different between how Kyrie deals with contact in this clip and the way, say, Jimmy Butler deals with the same contact. If he goes straight up here he gets the call"
"Child:  Mom I want Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, Mo Bamba, and Jeff Teague.  Mom:  We have at home."
"That sequence was so amazing, I think it demonstrated how underrated by the casual fan Luka's defense is. Luka while not a good defender is definitely a positive defender. But some people acting like he can't defend for his life. He's really good at defending guys like Paul George, Jimmy butler, he can actually bother guys like these, Guards most of the time can take advantage of him becouse of the speed, but he can usually shift his feet to force his body, and disrupt the guard, but i mean he can't guard bigs lol, maybe he can hold him down for a second or two so they can double him."
"&gt;Curry isn't athletic, Lebron is athletic, Tim Duncan isn't athletic, Kyrie isn't athletic, Giannis is athletic, Jimmy Butler is athletic, Gordan Dragic isn't athetlic  sounds like you know what athletic means then"
"Bud, you guys would have fucked up luka.  Face it, you guys have been a shit organization post-Adelman and not even drafting prime Lebron is going to change that.    This isn't about the kings, it's about shitty front offices.    Lebron left Cleveland because it was a shit front office. AI only went to one finals in philly when Larry Brown got him some decent help in Dikembe and virtually nothing else.  AD couldn't get shit done in New Orleans.  Garnet, Jimmy Butler, KAT, same in Minnesota.  Booker was empty stats in phx until they got James Jones.  Lavine was being wasted in Chicago under Boylen, and they had their own high profile big in wendell carter jr. whose growth seems to have been badly stunted.  Beal, wasted in washington, point is the nba is full of good players that aren't doing shit because the organization around them sucks.  The Kings are exactly such an organization.  There is zero reason for me to believe you guys wouldn't have fucked up Luka, but go on believing he would have fixed everything."
Do you even watch Warriors vs Heat or any Warrior game  or just buy brainless narratives? They snuffed up the PnR well coz they got a good defense. They put Jimmy Butler on Dray to counter Steph-Dray PnR. Point is spamming PnR vs good teams wont solve the team's lack of talent.
Jimmy Butler feels like a Gintama character irl. Or anybody who fits the delinquent protag trope

"Jimmy butler maybe, got kicked out by his mom when he was a teen and was homeless for a extended period of time I think."
Don't forget Kawhi tried to recruit Jimmy Butler to join him in LA before he called PG.
Jimmy Butler &amp; Donovan Mitchell? no wonder Gonzaga blew
"So we got Jarded Butler and Jimmy Butler, Flo Thamba and Mo Bamba, and Davion Mitchell and Donovan Mitchell.  The simulation getting a bit repetitive and uncreative ngl, what's next ""Bronny James""?"
"No, but Jimmy Butler and Alfred the Butler are"
Jimmy butler in shambles
"&gt; Again, Randle‚Äôs rebounds per game are inflated because he plays 40+ minutes a game.   This is part of what value is and what goes into single season awards playing alot. It's not a debate of the best players just who had the best seasons and how much you play for that matters just like games missed.   1st:   G: Doncic  G: Steph F: Giannis  F: Kawhi C: Jokic  2nd   G: Lillard  G: Harden  F: LeBron F: Jimmy Butler C: Embiid   3rd:  G: Chris Paul G: Kyrie Irving  F: Jayson Tatum F: Paul George  C: Rudy Gobert   Neither of us have Zion or Randle interestingly. Im not as high on Trae Young as you(doesnt pressure the rim and isnt a real off ball threat which keeps him from being the highest offensive tier for me) and probably thinks his defense is more harmful than you do but this is otherwise pretty close. I also probably dont put as much emphasis on efficiency as you which is probably where the Tatum disagreement would stem from. Both Randle and Zion were real close for me, I just think Tatum is a little better."
"Took 3 rookies to 2 wins vs the Lakers while the 2nd and 3rd best players were out lmao, he absolutely carried them. Unless you are gonna act like Jimmy butler plus rookies and role players makes a finals contender normally"
"The only way the 76ers could see Miami in the conference finals (assuming the 6ers keep the 1 seed) is if we drop to 6. If they‚Äôre trying to avoid us until the conference finals, beating us last night would‚Äôve been extremely beneficial. And if the 6ers weren‚Äôt trying their hardest to win that game, which you‚Äôre insinuating, they would‚Äôve given Embiid another night off for recovery. The 6ers went into that game with the intention of winning. A win would‚Äôve guaranteed that they could rest their starters for the next two games. They got punched in the mouth (shoutout UD) and tried to get back in it until the 4th quarter rolled around. If your big surprise for the playoffs is just ‚Äúhaving Ben Simmons guard Jimmy Butler,‚Äù I don‚Äôt see y‚Äôall doing too well against us."
Still wished they had made the black ones. Would love an official Jimmy Butler one.
"Not a Spurs fan obviously, but I think it's a solid framework for a team. I don't think they have anyone who's going to be a consistent All-NBA player or anything like that, but they've got some good pieces throughout their roster that a top level player (especially a top level wing) would turn into a legitimately threatening team.   Of course, that's way easier said than done. It's remarkably unlikely that they'll be able to sign someone to be that piece given that it's San Antonio (Jimmy Butler honestly probably was their best shot there, but even then, that clearly wasn't a likely scenario at all), you can't count on drafting someone like that when you're a fringe playoff team, and I don't see how they could trade for someone like that while retaining the pieces that would make it all work.   Like you said, it's hard getting to the point of being a genuinely good team that's a legit championship threat. There's just not that many guys that are actually capable of being the best player on a contending team, and getting any of those players takes immense luck and (generally) an equally large investment, particularly when you're a small market team. I honestly don't know where I'd say they should go from here when working within the timeframe of Pop's likely remaining years. I don't think they have the assets to move up for a top draft pick, which then leads me to looking at the top players on underperforming teams that maybe could make that next step under a top level coach like Pop. Even then, though, that's a pretty barren list filled with a ton of maybes and ifs, and you basically are locked in once you make those moves given the limits of their draft capital. The best players that I think they could realistically get considering team circumstances would be players like Jerami Grant, Brandon Ingram, Christian Wood, and others like them. Really good players for sure, but do I think any of them (or even all of them) would be enough to put the Spurs into a contending window? Not really, no."
"Yeah I've never expressed this before but I do not believe in Jimmy Butler at all, I don't even think he could win a single game, especially if that game was against the Detroit Pistons.  Please someone get this to Butler ASAP."
"In my opinion, I would have Lillard 1st team and move Luka to 2nd, I know it's splitting hairs but I think despite the consistent injuries the trailblazers had Lillard was still able to carry them. I would also put randle ahead of Jimmy Butler for the first team. Randle has played more games and is unquestionably the best player on his team while Butler has Bam. So I'll move Butler to the 2nd team. I agree with your 3rd team but maybe put Tatum over Zion but it's close. Tatum has missed time due to covid but he's been doing great on both ends but Zion is just built different around the basket. I think this year the pelicans and Celtics had comparable talent on their roster and the celtics have a better record and are in the playoffs so I'll probably go with Tatum, but it's really close."
Jimmy Butler wouldn't be intimidated by the freaking Dream Team
"I think KG and Jimmy Butler have something in common. If you don't vibe with them, it's going to be hard to work with them. They are super intense, but will also go to war with you and shed blood sweat and tears with and for you if you're all in with them.  If you're on the fence or nonchalant or too chill, good luck. Wiggins is one of those guys who's just not going to be compatible with a KG or Butler type coworker. I used to have coworkers that were really intense, and some of them I got along fine with, while others I didn't. It really depends on chemistry... sometimes you just don't vibe with someone."
"Jimmy ""Spice Adams"" Butler in the thumbnail lol"
"Let's calm down with top 10 he can't shoot a 3.....Jimmy may be the mouthpiece but, that team in the playoffs only goes as far as Bam.  Most of the defensive schemes against high tier competition falls apart without him. Then add in he is developing a pretty nasty mid range shot.   Butler is great but, top 10.....again let's calm down"
"In the game while ago, they let Danny Green guard Jimmy then Ben guard Bam or idk I forgot the other player. I dont know why they put danny green on Jimmy butler when Ben is better than Green when it comes to defense.     Was there bad blood between Jimmy and Ben? Is there drama? Something happened between them?    I feel like Jimmy doesnt like Ben cause Ben‚Äôs too much(?) for him? I mean he knows Ben is good but Ben isnt working as much as he should to improve his game. And Jimmy wants everyone from the team to work twice as hard but I think Ben‚Äôs like chill you know"
I‚Äôd believe it. Jimmy Butler has willed his way to a finals appearance and into the top-10 conversation in the league. Man does not lack confidence.
&gt;completely innocuous quote that essentially everyone in the league says but will be lionized b/c epic competitor Jimmy Butler said it
The Jimmy Butler myth making is absurd.
"Have you been watching basketball this season? Jimmy Butler is first team All NBA in multiple advanced metrics. Not sure what else he needs to do to walk the walk, he‚Äôs certainly earned the right to talk."

"wingspan and standing reach are far more important than mere height, but if we can say that most of great defenders have elite wingspan, not all players with elite wingspan are elite defenders. Reggie Jackson, standing 6'2, has 7'0"" wingspan and yet never been close to be a decent defender.  Considering how Matisse play and how he's able to anticipate opponent movements and intentions, I can see him being elite even with normal length, same as it happens with Jimmy Butler and his t-rex arms."
"The biggest reason i wanted to win tonight was to have Miami in the other side of the bracket. I still think we‚Äôre going to get the 1st seed, but we‚Äôre going to have to face Miami and one of Brooklyn or Milwaukee, which is a very scary prospect.  I don‚Äôt think anybody wants to go 7 with Miami right now. Jimmy Butler is a certified baller."
"No, the Timberwolves deserve this. Luckily for them, their lord and savior Jimmy Butler ensured they didn't break this record."
We did. His name is Jimmy Butler.
Close call good thing I'm a Heat fan not just a Jimmy Butler fan.  Jimmy Butler Playoff Games Played(76) Since 2011.  Minnesota Timberwolves Playoff Games Played(52) Since 1990.
Jimmy Butler has won doble (36) the amount of playoff games the Timberwolves (18) have in franchise history
You clearly don't if you think Jimmy Butler was completely healthy in that series.  He rushed back from injury to help the Wolves run the table and make their only playoff appearance in like 18 years.    You a bum man.  Be better.
the minnesota timberwolves have the same amount of championships(0) as jimmy butler(0)
"I've literally seen you comment many times on r/nba about Jimmy Butler just with the intent to trash him. So yes, he lives in your head rent free."
Classic. He and Jimmy Butler are the few superstars that give 110% each night on both ends.
Chris Paul has less finals appearances than jimmy butler
"Ratings may be down, but I have to say the product is off this year. Injuries all over the league, no fans and guys coming into the season out of shape make the product less than ideal. But I think this single game playoff thing definitely makes the last two weeks more interesting.   I didn‚Äôt buy league pass because of the injuries everywhere. Then I didn‚Äôt watch every Peli game because their offense is so weird and bad that I just can‚Äôt get enthusiastic. Jimmy Butler was hurt, so I didn‚Äôt watch as many Heat games as usual. It‚Äôs just been a strange year. I hope the best teams can get healthy, but not holding my breath."
"I literally just went on your sub and searched tyler herro and jimmy butler and was greeted with many hate posts, one named ‚Äújimmy butler is a disgrace, trashcan‚Äù so no. Just admit your sub is like every other sub and hates on players sometimes, its normal"
Counterpoint: Jimmy Butler is very likeable (see my username)
Insert the Jimmy Butler trying to check in while in a suit meme.
"Jimmy Butler and beating fake #1 seeds, name a better duo."
"I LOATHE this Heat team. Jimmy Butler is an unlikeable douchebag, Erik Spoelstra has basically benefitted from stars falling into his lap, and Miami's annoying role players are just that"
"If Jimmy Butler can make 3s now, league is fucked"
We never had a chance imo tonight. The refs basically let the Heat do whatever they wanted on defense. So many fouls uncalled. Luckily for me the Heat also shot like crazy so it wouldn't have mattered anyway. When Jimmy Butler makes 3/3 three pointers you're just gonna lose that night.
Jimmy Butler - fake tough guy
Why is DPOY Ben Simmons guarding one trick pony 3p shooter Duncan Robinson over Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler and beating fake one seeds - name a better duo
This Jimmy Butler guy is pretty good. We should probably try to trade for him.
"Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, and Bam Adebayo are the top 3 right now imo, and then I'd give an honorable mention to Jimmy Butler.  Edit: And another honorable mention to Giannis and Embiid."
Jimmy Butler has nothing to do with this. UD would do the same thing and stand up for his team if needed even if he wasn‚Äôt playing.
"A known ""tough guy"" enters a game for the first time in a season and gets into a fight.  Do you really want a brawl and Jimmy Butler sitting out a couple of games cuz he got suspended?"
Jimmy Butler is going to lead the retirement home to the finals.
This reffing is heavily biased for the Heat. Why are the refs forcing Ben Simmons to guard Duncan Robinson instead of Jimmy Butler? So unfair!
Because he‚Äôs guarding their best 3 point threat in Robinson. Jimmy is a 21% three point shooter who has knocked down 4/4 from deep already. The defensive strategy was obviously putting Ben on Robinson and Green on Butler. Maybe they switch that up moving forward.
"No way jimmy butler is that low, jimmy butler carry heat in the finals , jimmy butler contribution mighty not be flashy but he‚Äôs got more than that I believe"
jimmy butler is crazy man
I've never seen Jimmy Butler make this many 3s who is this
"Just a reminder that the Heat have never lost a game when Jimmy Butler makes a 3 pointer, don't fact check this"
"The definition of superstar changes all the time here to let in whoever is playing well at the time.   For me, the line is basically at Jimmy Butler and Demar Derozan. They play at the star level. Jimmy showed he can raise his game and play as a superstar. Dame is an offensive superstar but how much are you valuing defense here?   AD, for example, is a DPOY-caliber player who is a top 10 offensive player too - how do you rank that?   LeBron is a good example - he plays with the higher floor but he has showed he has the ability to play as one of the best players in the league."
Michael Jordan is Anthony Edwards' real Jimmy Butler? I gotta say I liked it better the first way
Damian Lillard/Jayson Tatum/Jimmy Butler. If you're better than them congrats you're **zero** doubt a superstar. If you're not better than them you're not a superstar.
It‚Äôs called the Andy Dalton line right?  I remember a couple years ago it was Paul George but I guess now would be like... Jimmy butler? Idk first thought
You mean jimmy butler
"Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Karl Anthony-Towns, Terrell Brandon, Tom Gugliotta, Tony Campbell, Al Jefferson,  Wally Szczerbiak, Sam Cassell, Stephon Marbury, Isaiah Rider, Jimmy Butler"
"The TEAM the Los Angeles Lakers cannot be world champions until they play teams from all over the WORLD. The most valuable PLAYER from the NBA playoffs is easily the best player in the world, so if you wanted to call LeBron/Jimmy Butler the WORLD‚Äôs best, absolutely. We‚Äôre talking about teams, not players."
"I mean you think they're doing something wrong. If you're a Clippers or Heat fan and Paul George or Jimmy Butler are about to be pushed off the team because of Embiid, you probably don't like it.  The NBA gives very few instructions with the ballots so there is no ""right"" way. They want different perspectives and takes on how voting should work. It's basically the diversity argument. The more styles of thinking, the better."
"&gt;But back to JJ being petty - imagine if Mike Scott demanded a trade to a certain destination and whined publicly when it didn't happen. You wouldn't say the 76ers fucked up, you'd say wtf, you are mike scott you don't get to make trade demands.  This depends on situation, if Morey told him he'd trade him somewhere and didn't do it then I'd understand him being upset. In that case Morey would have fucked up.   Players have left our organization and made fun of us and I at least get where they're coming from. Jimmy Butler for example, I don't know that I'd want him back anyway but he got shit treatment and he left and talked about it, fair enough."
No he said he knew his playing time would go down because he knew how SVG valued defense.  JJ has good relations with every team he left? Did you miss his podcast with Jimmy butler where they did nothing but shit talk the sixers?
Jimmy Butler Miami Heat
KD or Jimmy Butler more likely than PG.
"‚ÄúWhat superstars has been traded for pennies on the dollar in the past decade anyway‚Äù  There is a guy called Demarcus Cousins, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler (TO YOU GUYS FOR CHRIST SAKES) Westbrook was literally for a hampered Wall and a protected first...James Harden 2x...  But okay...and Holiday isn‚Äôt on that level of any star I just mentioned. Dude is a 1x all-star.   And what do you mean, wut? I said actually compete. What have y‚Äôall done these last couple years? And if you blame it on injuries, why don‚Äôt you go checkout the Bulls injury history and I‚Äôm 100% you won‚Äôt be tooting that horn.   So like I said, since you‚Äôre all for trading stars. Why don‚Äôt you send Embiid to Sac for Hield and a 1st, just like they did to Cousins...because stars almost always get traded for pennies on the dollar."
Free agents weren‚Äôt attracted here when we had Derrick Rose or Jimmy Butler. Players don‚Äôt want to deal with Reinsdorf and Chicago winters. Free Zach
"Yeah, as far as I know he hasn't said anything negative about the team. He's pretty tight at least with Joel and Tobi. He defended Brett Brown when Jimmy Butler was basically shitting on his coaching style. I think he really liked his time in Philly."
Mr October himself Jimmy butler
Jimmy Butler and Vernon Maxwell I think might work out well.
If Tate can work on ball handling a little bit more and learn to create for himself he could really be a Jimmy Butler-lite
"Heat. This matchup is much worse for hawks than the potential Knicks matchup. Miami is more consistent offensively than the Knicks, they have playoff exp, and jimmy butler is the best player in that series"
Why do so many people think Julius Randle has had a better season than Jimmy Butler???  Jimmy has better advanced stats - and it isn‚Äôt close. His counting stats are basically even with Randle‚Äôs and he‚Äôs a superior defender. *And* this guy is coming off a finals berth where he went supernova!
"All-NBA 1st Team  C: Nikola Jokic  F: Joel Embiid  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  G: Luka Doncic  G: Steph Curry  All-NBA 2nd Team  C: Rudy Gobert  F: Julius Randle  F: Zion Williamson  G: Damian Lillard  G: Chris Paul  All-NBA 3rd Team  C: Bam Adebayo  F: Kawhi Leonard  F: LeBron James  G: Jimmy Butler  G: Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  Notable Snubs:  Tatum, Westbrook, KAT, Harden, Trae, Booker, Beal, Jaylen, Mitchell, Lavine, Kyrie."
"Jimmy Butler not even on the all-snub team. Am I on crazy pills with this one? Feels like I am, another post that excludes him. Julius Fucking Randle (all due respect to the former Laker) instead?"
"lmao the only trade danny really missed out on was kawhi. one year of AD isn't worth 7+ years of tatum, and AD isn't succeeding as a first option. the butler trade sure worked out for philly and minnesota right? no idea why you think adding jimmy butler to that dysfunctional ass 2018-19 team would've worked. he would've left that year in FA to go to the heat"
"Jordan and his son, Jimmy Butler"
"Oh yeah, I remember that too and that's why I loved the signing. His D on LeBron in our first matchup last year and his D on Butler in the playoffs were good, especially on Butler. It was crazy how Bud didn't force that matchup for Wes to stay on him more.  The matchups he had with Jimmy he had this year were exciting to watch because I knew he'd clamp him when switched on him and he did for us. There were a few plays in our 1st game with Miami where Butler drove on Wes and Wes straight up bitched him, stood him up and snatched the ball from him before he even got a shot off (or could draw a foul).  He's perfect for those bigger 2s and 3s."
"He sat on his assets for too long imo. He could have traded for AD, Jimmy Butler, or even Harden. He should have traded for Butler when he had the chance imo."
"LeBron James is on this list. He is ranked 18th, you must have just missed his name.   Anthony Davis was probably left off for having too low a sample size. I can see that no listed player has played fewer than 40 games played - AD has only played 36 this season. Either that or he didn't make top 50, which is entirely possible. All of those listed are pretty good clutch shooters - Jimmy Butler was only the last guy to make it!"
"yea I feel bad for Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid, JJ Reddick"
"Isn‚Äôt this essentially a re-tooled version of that sixers team though? Yeah no Jimmy, but 3 of the big 4 are there, and if you look at who played those playoffs and are usable players vs this years likely rotation, they traded Butler, Redick, and Scott for Green, Seth, Howard (Furk, Thybulle, shake, Maxey) either were there already or they would‚Äôve drafted someone there anyway. That seems like retooling."
"To be totally fair to the timberwolves, I think people discredit the organization too much for the Jimmy Butler experiment. I think there‚Äôs a real possibility Jimmy Butler‚Äôs leadership style is just too much for some guys. This has been a disaster of a season for you guys mostly because of injuries more than anything else, and Kat seems to be settling into the leadership role nicely, he‚Äôs got some of the awesome lead by example qualities that Steph has. Wiggins is an interesting guy and is very clearly self motivated, and it makes sense he didn‚Äôt do well with Butler‚Äôs style.  Dray rarely gets on Wiggins‚Äô ass at all. He will always hype him up and congratulate him after he does something sick, but for the most part he lets wigs handle his own business and doesn‚Äôt get as hands on as he does with other guys on the team."
"Well I‚Äôd take 32 games of Kevin Durant over 51 of Jimmy Butler? I don‚Äôt see the difference here man.   I understand what your saying, hey LeBron is more valuable. No denying it. I too would take 43 games of LeBron over 52 of Kyrie. But it‚Äôs over a mostly complete season.   Otherwise All-NBA teams should have Harden, LeBron, AD and KD on them."
"Those same miami beat guys (5 reasons sports) have literally made up multiple fake stories this year.

"I prefer tiers over actual numerical rankings. It‚Äôs a bit more nuanced.  For years, I (and many others) had a tier 1 with 6 guys in it (no particular order): Steph, lebron, Giannis, KD, kawhi, harden.  All of these guys are either MVPs, or finals MVPs. Scoring champions, assist leaders, DPOYs, greatest shooter ever, etc.  The next tier was high level guys who hadn‚Äôt achieved that same kind of level yet: Jokic, embiid, AD, Dame, Luka  Followed by a tier of other fantastic all-star guys: PG, Jimmy butler, gobert, kyrie. Starts to get a bit murkier after that in terms of guys who are borderline to go into this group (Tatum, Tobias, Middleton, klay, dray, bam, Mitchell, and more etc).  I think if/when Jokic wins MVP, it‚Äôs reasonable to move him up to the top tier with those other guys just because that‚Äôs a pretty crazy milestone. I could see where people would still have him lower within that tier, but I think he would have separated himself from that second tier into the top tier of guys.   One thing I always think about is ‚Äúcan this guy be the best player on the floor in a playoff series against team X? What about team Y?‚Äù And I think it‚Äôs hard to say anyone definitively goes over the top of Jokic at this point. Lebron I think is the easiest to argue until he stops being able to do it. Curry certainly has a claim. Jokic was the best player on the floor against kawhi last year. You could argue for KD, Giannis, and harden each, but I think Jokic has just as good a claim in those matchups in terms of overall impact.  Embiid and Luka I think are knocking on the door if that top tier for similar reasons. Not there yet, though. Notably, besides the MVP, Jokic already has more sustained playoff success than either of those 2."
C- Draymond Green  PF- Demar Derozan  SF- Jimmy Butler   SG- Brad Wannamaker  PG- TJ McConnell   The playmaking/3pt mason union lineup from hell. Imagine game after game being watching beautiful passes end in wide open bricks from 3.
Wow the TWolves won a game! KAT doesn‚Äôt care about winning. Jimmy Butler said it to his face.
"What is surprising is that every player above him is either a big man that gets all of his shots close to the rim, or a forward/guard that shoots 3s at a high level, Jimmy Butler is the only person not in those categories in the top 50. Plus Draymond shoots the same amount of threes as Butler."
Jimmy Butler shoots 1.9 threes a game

"Jokic better... Embiid better..  Luka  better... Giannis better... Westbrook better... Chris Paul better..  Orange Julius better...  Dame better...  Steph better..  Booker better..

"&gt; There is a legit argument now that Brown is better  Nah. Butler is top 5/10 in every advanced stat lol.

"just put Tatum on the list, too.  Bubble wrap him for the rest of the year.  He's probably not getting All-NBA over Jimmy Butler, just mothball him."
Kawhi had an impressive series with a remarkable 27.0 game score. I looked up the highest for a NBA finals series and if you consider the round vs the Sixers the finals he almost would have made the top 10.  Puts Jimmy Butler and his carry job in perspective   2000 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.6  2017 - Kevin Durant 30.3  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.1  1993 - Michael Jordan 29.6  2017 - LeBron James 29.6  1991 - Michael Jordan 29.4  1987 - Magic Johnson 28.3  2018 - Lebron James 28.3  2020 - JIMMY BUTLER 27.7  2020 - Lebron James 27.5
 &gt;Already making an excuse for his first round exit!  any of this kind of whining coming out of Jimmy Butler after he got swept?
"That the 76ers got better by replacing Jimmy Butler and JJ Reddick for Al Horford and Josh Richardson.  Nobody would admit to it now, but that was dare I say... an overwhelming consensus opinion heading into the 2019-20 season."
"You forgot poor asset management as well. They traded for jimmy butler who left and also gave up assets to trade for Harris when they were over the cap  so they had to give him the max. They also signed horford and lost a first round pick to get off of him (didn‚Äôt end up being that bad but still bad management).   They also didn‚Äôt end up with any perimeter creators despite their best player being a 7 foot post up center and it being the most obvious fit in the world.   Honestly other than embiid being a beast and getting better and better, everything else has gone wrong"
"They should have kept Jimmy. Having a Top 10-15 caliber guy is a massive asset, and to lose him for Josh Richardson is terrible asset mismanagement.   The Tobias Harris trade was also stupid. The Clippers weren't going to re-sign him, and the cap math worked out with cap holds for the Sixers to be able to sign a max guy and bring back both Butler and Redick. I don't 100% hate the trade, but I think they could have gotten it done with only their own, less valuable picks, while retaining the 2021 Miami pick asset.   They could have been much more aggressive including Simmons in trade offers to try to land a third star that better fit around Butler and Embiid too had they kept Butler."
"I'd give him 1% blame, potentially for not getting Lowry, but it sounds like Masai was in La La Land (and not the good one with Emma Stone).  He's not the dumbass that traded Jimmy Butler. He made a very good trade in dumping Josh Richardson for Seth Curry too, who really fits well with Embiid."
"While I agree, jimmy butler has led the most threatening 6ers team and the heat last year. His 3 pt shot is awful, although he and igoudala stuck some clutch corner threes last year."
"Me just imagining Jimmy Butler putting on the same evil face Lebron made, but in practice.  üòÇ"
In Rose's book he talks highly of Butler and said they were actually conversing a lot about the situation with the Wolves but he said that Jimmy had literally something like 2 baskets during that practice.
Philly should have kept Jimmy Butler and tried to use Ben Simmons to try and trade for pieces to compliment Embid and Butler.
"arguable imo, He was deflecting it a lot of it before tonight. Id argue guys like julius randle and jimmy butler have caught more in their respective series. Even Paul George in some games mainly cause hes become the favorite meme at this pt."
"You can just tell this by watching games. It‚Äôs exactly the reason why most players who go off for the first half of a game can‚Äôt do the same in the second half. You need plays off, that‚Äôs why rarely anyone has dropped over 70 before.   I‚Äôve definitely seen Harden in particular struggle with staying on par with his usual self in 4th quarters. Usually Houston had to slow down the pace of the game a lot, and he‚Äôd still defer to Cp3 and Eric Gordon some possessions. Sometimes Harden wouldn‚Äôt even get the final shot in a game as we let Eric and Gerald Green shoot those multiple times.   Jimmy Butler last finals. Had some spectacular games but this dude could barely even move in the last game or two against the Lakers"
"To quote jimmy butler, soft as baby shit"
Also Jimmy Butler opted out of the olympics
They sure could use a closer like Jimmy Butler in the fourth quarter.
Also Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt going to the olympics.
They chose Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler
"Said it before and I‚Äôll say it again. These Hawks are cockroaches. They just never go away. If they get Trae a solid wing player, like a jimmy butler type, they‚Äôre gonna be sp00ky"
Jimmy Butler in that one practice with the 3rd stringers
1. LeBron 2. Steph 3. Westbrook 4. AD 5. Kawhi 6. CP3 7. Embiid 8. Jimmy Butler 9. Giannis 10. Gobert 11. Spida 12. Dame 13. Luka 14. Jokic 15. Durant 16. Harden 17. AD 18. Conley 19. KAT  Man this is harder than I thought. That‚Äôs what my stoned brain can come up with.
"*heat wins* This just goes to prove that Jimmy Butler and the heat culture are all about coming into the office and getting shit done. They're professionals who know how to get down to business.  *lakers wins* LeMickey, ADisney, fraud ring.   Honestly, it just comes with being a fan of a popular/hated franchise. Dodgers get the same treatment regarding the world series."
Lebron‚Äôs injury was not overuse related.  AD has been injured for 10 years now. Jimmy Butler always misses games.   One guy on the Celtics? One guy on the Nuggets? Most teams have a guy suffer a serious injury every year. Jamal Murray in particular has missed huge amounts of time with leg injuries the last couple years. Not surprising to see him suffer a major leg injury.  This really isn‚Äôt that telling.
"&gt;There are players that we know to lead teams very well. Jimmy, Chris Paul, and LeBron are good examples.  Sure, but just because we know some guys can lead teams well doesn't mean we can objectively compare how good leaders they are.   &gt;Tatum has the deep playoff runs but he didn't do them as the leader of his team. He was a rookie for his first one, and his team entirely lacked lategame execution in the other, if we're looking at his two ECF berths, just because you're a team's best player doesnt mean you're leading the team  Just because he was a rookie in the first one doesn't mean he wasn't a leader on that team. He was the go-to guy when they needed a bucket and just as important to that run as Horford, Brown, Smart, and Terry. The second deep run did lack late-game execution, so that is a valid point.  &gt;Jimmy was the Heat's best player through 3 of the 4 series, with Bam being our best player due to the matchup with the Celtics. Jimmy was the one hitting the clutch shots down the stretch in Milwaukee, he set the tone of the game in Indiana, and obviously with the finals. I watched every game of our playoff run, Dragic was an amazing scorer for us but he wasn't our best player for any of our series'.  Dragic had better stats in that first series and you can make a really good argument he was better than Jimmy in that series, even if you do want to lean Jimmy. In comparison with Tatum, there isn't a single series last playoffs when he wasn't the best player.  &gt;Id argue that Monty Williams spearheaded the turnaround in the bubble, and Chris Paul completed it this year.  Monty for sure played a big part in it and CP3 did too, but Booker was just as much a part of that as they were and if that isn't evident to you from how Book has played all year and especially in the playoffs, I don't know what to tell you.  &gt;Boston's problem is on court leadership. I've watched more Celtics games this season than any team but the Heat and Lakers, and you guys fall apart at the end of games. That shows the lack of a steadying presence from a leader.  So Tatum actually led the league in 4th quarter scoring on 48/48/88 splits and continued that trend in the playoffs on 45/50/87 splits. Late game execution was a problem for last year's Celtics but it was not nearly as much of an issue this year. The problem was more so slow starts and having to play from behind all game long.   You're basing your argument on leadership too much around how you feel, and while it is perfectly fine to feel like Jimmy Butler is an excellent leader, you cannot use that as an objective, unbiased argument.   If we were playing by those rules, I would tell you that in my opinion, an objectively good leader wouldn't get outscored by Bryn Forbes in the process of being swept in the first round by a team that they had beaten less than a year ago and is currently being exposed to have no legitimate offensive system, especially after talking a big deal about being able to take over and carry once the playoffs come around. Good leaders don't objectively do that, do they?"
"I understand what you‚Äôre saying but my point is that Malcolm Brogdon being upset with McMillan isn‚Äôt something that should lead to firing. Of course he‚Äôs upset, it‚Äôd be bad if you weren‚Äôt upset after getting sweeped. But Brogdon, as good as he is, isn‚Äôt a guy the FO has to bend over backwards to keep happy. This would be like Dillon Brooks saying he was unhappy with Taylor Jenkins after losing. FO‚Äôs just can‚Äôt be firing good coaches over stuff like that. There were reports that Jimmy Butler was upset at the Heat coaching staff after getting swept in the first round this year. And that‚Äôs a guy who really should be kept happy, yet the heat aren‚Äôt even considering a change. I really think the locker room stuff was probably salvageable and if it wasn‚Äôt, the FO probably should have chosen to keep McMillan over Brogdon. I think it was largely about the FO thinking their roster was capable of more in the playoffs than they we‚Äôre getting with McMillan when in actuality it doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs true."
Or jimmy butler who was hurt pretty much all year
Jimmy Butler
"There is literally nothing objective about leadership and pretending otherwise is absolutely biased thinking, especially considering none of us fans can see it up close and personal.   Jimmy Butler has the same amount of deep playoff runs as Jayson Tatum, and Tatum was able to do so at a younger age. Booker doesn't have the same reps but he was able to spearhead a massive cultural turnaround starting in the bubble for a team that had been a bottom feeder for almost a decade and he is now in the middle of a deep playoff run while Tatum and Butler are out in the first round.   To poke at Jimmy's record, you talk about his impressive playoff runs but his crowning achievement was a finals run when he wasn't even his team's best player in half of the series (Dragic vs Indiana, Bam vs Boston).   Another nitpick, Boston's biggest problem was not a lack of leadership on the court, it is that the team is incredibly top-heavy and was continuously not healthy.   If you are going to make an argument for Jimmy over Tatum or Booker for all-NBA, you can damn well do so using actual analysis of their production. There is nothing about how you think their leadership is that is objective."
Jimmy Butler is 'stupidly locked in' to the offseason
"Did either of them win the MVP playing more minutes than the rest of the league by a significant margin as the sole offensive engine for their MVP team in back to back condensed seasons with barely any offseason at all?  No, of course they didn‚Äôt. Because this is an unprecedented situation.  Re: other stars are playing - plenty of guys are also opting out. Jimmy butler just did. Again, joker carried a bigger load than anyone else.   And the 2017 situation was referring to the [2017 euro basket that he sat out](https://www.denverstiffs.com/2017/7/2/15911640/report-nikola-jokic-will-not-participate-in-eurobasket-serbia). I‚Äôm not sure what happened in 2015 since he was still overseas/a rookie barely getting PT back then. I loved watching him in the 2016 Olympics though. Hope to get to cheer him on playing for serbia in future international tournaments."
People don‚Äôt realize Giannis should never guard players like KD or even Jimmy Butler. Ben Simmons is the only all star 4 in the nba you would put on those guys.
Jimmy Butler is a fucking bum and him being in over Tatum is incredibly disrespectful.
"This is the same headline as last year except it‚Äôs KD now, not Jimmy Butler."
"&gt;Ethan Skolnick of 5 Reasons Sports reports that Butler will eventually be offered a max-contract extension this summer and is expected to sign it. We previously noted that Butler wanted an extension from the Heat. However, it was not then known whether Pat Riley and Co. were willing to commit to him long-term. **Said deal would be worth $182 million over four years**  There‚Äôs a good chance that deal won‚Äôt age well, but it would essentially keep Jimmy here for the rest of his All-Star/All-NBA level years"
"All 3 of them play with other all stars, but only Booker isn't the clear best player on his team.   As for not making finals, this is a regular season award.  Butler played less games than Booker and Tatum which is their only argument for making all-nba over him, but Butler was significantly better than both of them this season.   As for ""foul baiting"" Jimmy Butler drives and creates contact, as opposed to Booker and Tatum who play more around the perimeter. It makes complete sense that he would shoot 8 free throws a game to Tatum and Bookers ~5. Call it whatever you'd like, Butler creates offense for his team more efficiently than both of them.  ""Skipped all the hard games"" jfc are you even reading what you're typing?"
"well you see it sometimes, some of the most iconic shots recently have been the best on best.  Kyrie over Curry 2016 game 7 Durants 3 over Lebron to ice the game in the 2017 finals Lebron over Jimmy Butler game winner Kawhis game 7 winner over Embiid Dames game winner over Paul George Jeremy Lins game winner over Jose Caulderon"
"Jimmy is responsible for more offense, doing so the most efficiently with the least turnovers of the 3, while playing the best defense.  Booker was 48-19 in his 67 games, but he's also debatably not even the best player on his team   Butler was 33-19 in his 52 games as the clear best player on his team  Tatum was 34-30 in his 64 games as the clear best player on his team.   Butler also had by far the best impact statistics of the group, often being top 5 in the league."
Jimmy Butler?
G- Steph Curry  G - James Harden  G- Damian Lillard   G- Chris Paul  G - Bradley Beal   F- Kawhi Leonard  F- LeBron James  F - Kevin Durant  G/F - Jimmy Butler  F - Paul George  C - Bam Adebayo   C - Anthony Davis
"Jimmy butler, Paul George and Kyrie. Tatum, Young and Donovan. I mean for realz it‚Äôs not even close"
"Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Randle all had worse seasons than Jayson Tatum and Donovan Mitchell not to mention that Tatum literally had more All-NBA votes than Kyrie Irving"
obvious pick would be Jimmy Butler and maybe Kyrie since he wanted to take personal days.
Jimmy Butler
Never hid that lol.   &gt;subs leading Jimmy Butler hater   Nah.
TIL the subs leading Jimmy Butler hater is serbian
19-20 Lakers are definitely not top 10  Also how tf is the Raos playoff run ‚Äúeasy‚Äù when they went through the Jimmy Butler 76ers and the best year the Bucks ever had.
Who are the plethora of guards and wings he has defended on the perimeter with success other than Jimmy Butler?
"Add to this that while Butler was on the court, Miami was on a 46 win pace which would've been good for a top 4 seed. Realistically they get there if he plays just a few more games. We saw what Miami was without him for 20 games; they land way outside the playoff picture. Jimmy was a borderline top 5 guy this year - saying he should be 2nd team All NBA isn't outlandish at all.   Meanwhile Tatum was available for nearly the entire season, played more minutes in those games, and still wasn't able to reach Jimmy in cumulative analytical statistics nor overall team wins. He is an amazing talent, but he just isn't equal to Jimmy's impact. People clamoring for Butler to be left off the teams for Tatum genuinely don't understand what impacts winning basketball games."
Jimmy Butler is barley half the offensive player that KD is. The comparison is completely meaningless.
"He literally shut down Jimmy Butler during the heat series. This sub man, it‚Äôs like people have a memory span for the last game a player played and that‚Äôs it."
"&gt;  That's all you had to say fam  Nope, I confused you.  I meant in playstyle. In performance he can be better under the right system. Bigs do not need a bag, that's what perimeter ‚Äãplayers need. Bigs need to be like really good in few things and only spam those.   &gt;It's ultimately on Giannis and if you think otherwise you are naive.   It is not a question of naivete though. It is a question of being a fan of the sport.  For example if you were one, i.e. did not watch conference semi finals on, you would have taken wind that Giannis was guarding Jimmy Butler almost exclusively throughout the series of theirs against the Heat.  And you may wonder why. Was it because Giannis finally said ""I'm guarding whomever"". Nope , Bud finally adjusted to their loss last year and decided that after all putting Giannis on Butler was a good idea. So once more Giannis was the coach's boy, like he always was.  What may be a question of naivete though is whether you think that International stars are different than homegrown ones. The naive approach is to say ""no"", the more worldly approach is to *know* that international players have it beaten in their heads from an early age, that no matter who you are you should listen to the coach.  Do I agree with that approach? Yes in a sport where many players (say more than 10) are involved. In basketball? Nope! One player can make all the different in the world as we well saw today. So basically international players come with the wrong mentality in this regard and it *is* one thing that holds them back.  They say that Giannis can't guard KD one on one, they said the same about Jimmy last year. As it turns out (in the first round this season) he *could* guard jimmy and I am willing to bet that he could at least slow KD down. Why then haven't he tried it once. *Because* he has that one major drawback that many internationals have. He listens too much, he is not fully cognizant of his dominance and of the full effect he can have on the court..."
"Jimmy had an incredible regular season. I could see an argument for Tatum too, but saying ""Tatum over Butler in a heartbeat"" means you're just a homer"
"Zion played more games than LeBron and Jimmy Butler did this regular season actually.  Saying he didn‚Äôt make All NBA because of injury is flat out wrong. His team sucks, that‚Äôs it."
I think Tatum has a better argument over Butler than Randle for sure. I am not surprised at all that Randle made an All NBA team. Jimmy Butler made it while missing All Star which is wild to think about
Didn't know Jimmy Butler was top 10 of all time
&gt; Jimmy Butler game 5 vs Lakers last year  Way too far down...even though this this thread has only been up 10 minutes.
Paul George had a better year than Jimmy Butler so your gripe is with the wrong guy lol
 Kawhi Game 7 vs Philly  Lebron game 6 vs Boston in 2018  Jimmy Butler game 5 vs Lakers last year  All those I think had a little more stakes
Get Jimmy butler the fuck out lol
The coach decides the matchups I would assume. He guarded Jimmy Butler in the first round when he didn't last year. I thought Giannis guarding the other team's star player was gonna be a new thing but I guess not.
"Jimmy  Butler cannot shoot a 3 to save his life, that leaves Giannis sagging which gives him space to defend Butler playing exactly to Giannis strengths defensively  Way easier than defending KD who can pull up from 30 if you do that shit, Butler is not even in the same planet as KD"
"Same shit was posted during the bubble last year. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt Giannis guarding Jimmy Butler, he won DPOTY‚Äù  Well they had Giannis guard Butler this year and he shut his ass down. Maybe next year."
"He did fantastic against Jimmy Butler on all of that stuff. KD is a different animal, and Brooklyn sets legal screens, unlike Miami, but at least give it a try when he's not being bothered at all by the smaller defenders being run at him."
"I'm just bandwagoning whoever is playing the Nets. It may be futile, but I really hate two of their players (Griffin, Harden), and have no warm feelings for Kyrie. KD is great. If it were him and Jimmy Butler making this run, I'd be cheering for them. But I never want Harden to win a ring. With the way he plays, he deserves to be remembered as a career loser."
he will next game. jimmy butler game 5 vibes
Giannas needs someone at least as good as jimmy butler down the stretch
"So weird not seeing James Harden, Jayson Tatum, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell on the list. And yet, I don't see anything wrong with these choices (other than Jimmy Butler).     This league is way too talented."
"Did they put lebron on the list out of pity? Or to keep a streak going? Not to be a homer but Tatum could have easily made it over him, Randle, PG. I have an appreciation for jimmy butler but he could have made it over him too."
How does Westbrook averaging a triple double and bringing the wizards to the playoffs not make it above jimmy butler
Only thing I would change is Jimmy Butler over Julius Randle for 2nd team
"I guess if you only go by ppg   | ppg | rpg | apg | spg | bpg | ---|---|----|----|----|----|----| Butler | 21.5 | 6.9 | **7.1** | **2.1**| 0.3| Tatum | **26.5**  | **7.4** | 4.3  | 1.2 | **0.5** |   | TS% | WS/48 | BPM | RPM | RAPTOR | LEBRON | on/off ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Butler | **60.7** | .**255** | **7.5** | **3.4** | **6.1** | **5.56** | **10.7**|  Tatum | 57.6 | .137 | 3.7 | 2.44| 2.8| 3.99 | 5.3 |   Jimmy is massively favored by every advanced stat. Butler also won 63% of the games he played in, Tatum only 53%. There is really no way you can measure impact that will show Tatum as being close to Butler, and that's before we get to the eye test which shows that Jimmy impacts the game in so many different ways on every play."
"Nobody works harder than Jimmy ""hey guys look how hard I'm working"" Butler"
"Head to head stats mean nothing.   Booker graded pretty meh in impact metrics (compared to top tier players).   Butler is clearly better than book, his game is far more well rounded at this point, and this shows up in impact metrics where jimmy is elite (was fourth overall in LEBRON).  I‚Äôm not saying book is trash, but he really wasn‚Äôt snubbed"
**Jason Tatum**  26.4/7.4/4.3 in 64 Games.  **Jimmy Butler**  21.5/6.9/7.1 in 52 Games.     Tatum and Steph are the only 2 players to have 3 \* 50+ Games this season. This is a joke.
No KD over Jimmy Butler?
Jimmy butler? How? He missed 20 games
"yeah jimmy would i think as miami was 33-19 with butler and 7-13 without him, that tells me he can win with ingram and lonzo on his team. Not too sure about paul george tho, but regardless pg had the numbers and the team record to match"
Jimmy Butler doesnt know about the Gleague?
"[Not early enough to drive with no traffic on the road, which is safer when you have no rearview mirror](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2580778-jimmy-butler-removes-rearview-mirror-in-his-car-as-a-symbol-to-never-look-back)"
"julius randle, paul george, &amp; jimmy butler got on ahead of harden, imagine my shock"
Holy shit! Can't believe Jimmy Butler replied to my comment on Reddit!
"Why do you keep acting like points are the only stat? Jimmy Butler is also a phenomenal defender LOL like that doesn‚Äôt matter at all. Neither book or Beal r good defenders so that doesn‚Äôt matter for ur argument between them but butler is top tier defender which matter a lot, same reason Simmons made all nba last year along with his playmaking ability."
"Booker averaged 7 more points last year on 5 more shots than Jimmy Butler last year, and Butler took more free throws. The Suns record last year was closer to the Heat‚Äôs than the Wizards record is to the Suns this year"
"Beal. He has worse stats versus Booker than Booker did last year versus Jimmy Butler, yet Butler made the 3rd team last year. The Suns record last year was closer to the Heat than the Wizards record this year is to the Suns"
Because no one took that into consideration when Jimmy Butler made it over DBook last year despite averaging worse stats versus him than DBook to Beal this year. The Suns last year were closer to the heat in record than the Wizards are to the Suns this year.
"I‚Äôd say getting to the line if you‚Äôre an 87% ft shooter is a good thing, no? I mean that‚Äôs only 1.74 ppp.   You‚Äôre right. Which is why DBook putting up 27/7 on 62% TS is absurd... and yet he was left off the teams anyways. He had considerably better stats versus jimmy butler and Russ last year, but he was left off for winning. The Suns last year were closer to the Heat and Rocket‚Äôs records than the Wizards record is to the Suns this year."
Then Booker was definitely better than Jimmy Butler last year when he averaged 7 more ppg on better efficiency across the board and the same assists
"Years and years of incompetent ownership, front offices, and coaching. The thibs/jimmy butler year didn‚Äôt help either. I think we‚Äôre finally headed in the right direction, but I wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if we miss the playoffs the next two years and KAT leaves."
"Jimmy Butler should have been slotted as a guard too. He played point guard as his primary position all season long. Should have had Butler in as the first guard on the third team, and then have Kyrie bounced, while Tatum gets the 2nd forward spot."
"And Kawhi, and Jimmy Butler, and Embiid."
Jimmy Butler being there is very offensive. Yikes.
The forwards I had were:   Kawhi/Giannis  Randle/Tatum  LeBron/PG  So LeBron 3rd team instead of 2nd and I had Tatum over Butler. But i agree if you‚Äôre holding games played against LeBron you also should factor in that Jimmy only played 6 more games than LeBron too.
"Jimmy Butler didnt deserve shit over Tatum, D Book, and Don."
Jimmy butler over Jaylen or jayson is laughable.
"FAX! Back when the Bulls were a respectable franchise! Coach Thibs, DRose, Taj, Pau, Jimmy Butler, Mirotic, Dunleavy Jr.. Miss those times."
"Kawhi should not have an All NBA selection, he missed so many games this year, Embiid should‚Äôve been 1st team easy. Jimmy Butler is the most overrated star today, Tatum and Booker shouldve gotten the last 2 slots"
How did Jimmy butler and PG have a better season than Zion it‚Äôs ridiculous
Bradley Beal &amp; Jimmy Butler have no place in any of the teams.
Jimmy butler and Pg easily
"Least favorite: Luka, Embild, and Jimmy Butler Favorite: Jokic, Giannis, KD, Kyrie, Harden, Steph, and Lebron."
How did Jimmy Butler beat out Tatum? Didn‚Äôt Tatum have a better season or am I stupid.
Jimmy Butler aint it lol
"Of course when people say 'bad' they're speaking in relative terms: when people say stephen curry isn't athletic or jimmy butler can't shoot no one is comparing them to average non-athletes, they're comparing them to average nba players. As a master's student, I'm better than almost everyone in the world at biochemistry -that doesn't make me a good scientist. The question I'm asking is what does he do well on offense at an NBA LEVEL, not at a highschool level or compared to the average American. I don't watch Gobert enough to say definitively, but it seems like there isnt anything. This is part of why people don't like him. Also its objectively waaaay easier to get into the nba at 7ft + compared to 6'5ft. There is a lot less competition and many of the things you need to do to have some value at that height are just based on pphysical attributes i.e being able to grab rebounds and contest shots."
I am taking why I value in a player and determining that Jimmy Butler is worse. Elite offense is better than elite defense.
Kawhi and Harden are both super unrealistic. Butler is possible I guess but I doubt Dame is gonna be happy with joining a team just because maybe they can get a 33-year-old Jimmy Butler.
Lakers were lucky to face Jimmy Butler without healthy Dragic and Bam
"Cap flexibility means he can rebuild the roster how he wants it.   Stars are generally pretty happy as long as the team is in a position to improve. Portland has plateaued these past couple of years, Houston would be in a position to overtake them.  &gt;Theyre a worse team than his Blazers.  Let's say he grabs Kawhi in FA. Let's say they miss on Kawhi and grab Jimmy Butler next year. Let's say Harden wants to return to Houston after winning a ring.   That's the sort of potential Houston has that Portland doesn't. Throughout his prime, Dame hasn't had an All-Star teammate and in Houston he could form his own Big 3.  Is Dame + Kawhi/Butler/Harden + Wood worse than his current Portland core?"
"Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt overrated.  He had an abysmal postseason, but the dude just led a team the NBA Finals and even had a memorable 40 burger against LeBron.  Randle‚Äôs ‚Äútweener‚Äù was completely exposed, and his bully-ball play style isn‚Äôt sustainable during the postseason.  Team‚Äôs schemed around his tendencies, and left him really exposed."
If that's the case - then it's as easy (or difficult) as waiting for a star 2-way wing to become available.  Would you fork over all of that for Jimmy Butler?
Playmaking and defense? Jimmy Butler should be top 5 for you then
"Jimmy Butler, he got cool practice/off court stories but I don‚Äôt know why people talk about him like he is some great winner that can teach young players about winning when he never won and is never consistent can‚Äôt be a number one or two on a championship team"
"Man you're trippin'  First of all, Butler got covid this year and lost tons and tons of muscle &amp; weight because of it. So its not even like this year is an accurate depiction of his skill.  Second, this guy is clutch, plays good defense. And has shown he can single handedly carry his team in the play offs. Literally having multiple 40 pt games in 1 series . Carrying a team no one believed in to the finals.   Jrue Holiday my ass. Holiday is great but Butler is definitly better.  If Bucks had Jimmy Butler instead of Holiday. I'm pretty sure they prob would have swept the suns"
"Orrr Jimmy Butler, who was rumored to be struggling to come to terms with a desired extension with the Heat. A guy who‚Äôs a fantastic playmaker, can score on his own but really would benefit from a go-to guy if Jimmy can‚Äôt get to the line/penetrate, and can be the best defender on a Finals team."
Jimmy butler
1 Sabonis   2 Lillard   3 Chris Paul   4 Jamal Murray   5 Bradley Beal   6 Jimmy Butler   7 Tyler Herro   8 Cameron Payne   9 Rudy Gobert    10 Julius Randle
Lol advanced metrics are absolutely right about Jimmy Butler. He's a great player.
"Shitty thing about this postseason is that my go-to answer is no longer overrated (Ben Simmons).   Off the top of my head, Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle"
Less than a year ago there were discussions about Jimmy Butler being a top 10 player and ESPN ranked AD as the 2nd best player in the league. A lot of shit changes in that time
Choose a player who embodies your beliefs. I believe in hardwork and tenacity so Jimmy Butler. You do you.
Jimmy butler
Stars are always overrated on the list due to recency bias of how far their team goes in playoffs without looking into any details. Jimmy Butler made the finals people had him top 5-10. Same thing happening this season.
The Name Anthony Edwards is worse then Jimmy Butler.
This season this sub had at least two front page posts with majority opinion being that Jimmy Butler should be in MVP conversation.
Kawhi was the best i've seen  Jimmy Butler too   Andre Iguadala
Jimmy Butler.
"People here suck, Jimmy Butler had an amazing finals run with the Heat. Now everyone is calling him a choke artist.  It was one bad playoffs performance, it happens to the best.  This also isn‚Äôt exclusive to Jimmy Butler of course."
"Calling Jimmy Butler a superstar is a stretch imo, but fair enough. I stand by not wanting to ship out Jaylen Brown for Butler though.   Harden again demanded to go to a very short list of teams (Philly, Miami, Brooklyn) and had shown a willingness to stop trying when discontent. Not a reasonable example.  So out of all listed: we could have traded for a 1 year rental of Kawhi, or for Jimmy Butler. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs 1, maybe 2 times, that Ainge passed on moving for a superstar, I don‚Äôt see the pattern."

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs 1, maybe 2 times, that Ainge passed on moving for a superstar, I don‚Äôt see the pattern."
"I‚Äôm just amused that that one series was supposed to put Kyrie on Curry‚Äôs level. Curry, even after being outplayed during that one series, was still rightfully considered the better player by the end of the next season - his gravity, shooting, role in the offense and everything that remained with him still makes it a no contest.  Only casuals would let one playoff series determine their perception of comparing players - that‚Äôs like claiming JJ Barea surpassed Lebron in 2011 or that Jimmy Butler is a better player than AD because of what he did last year.  The second statement was that Draymond would be a nobody on any other team - it‚Äôs a take that is both popular and yet has no basis in what draymond actually does. So, it‚Äôs a casual take imo"
"In addition to the three you mentioned there was also Jimmy Butler and James Harden. How many do you need before you feel like it's no longer a ""false narrative""? These are some of the best players in the world who were available, Ainge had all these assets and he got precisely none of them. At some point you gotta have the guts to pull the trigger. He didn't and that's why Boston is in the situation they're now in as opposed to playing for titles."
Jimmy Butler last year
"Miami is still a free agent destination. Every time someone mentions big markets there is always a Miami fan pretending they aren't a destination. There is always risk involved but you know why AD wasn't a risk for them? Because there was essentially a 0% chance he was gonna leave. For most other teams in the league it's like a 90% chance so yeah they aren't going to throw away all their assets and future to win for 1 season.  Miami did take a risk when trading for Shaq and then he re-signed there. If Utah had cleared cap space for the big 3 or Toronto had cleared cap space for the big 3 in 2010 do you honestly think that there was even a 1% of them signing in those places? The Nets thing is why teams don't take these risks. If the Nets weren't in New York they would still be mediocre as hell and have missed on potential star players with those draft picks. Sure they took a bit of a risk with Kyrie and Durant but do you honestly think that there was a single team in the NBA that would not have switched places with the Nets and signed both of them? I do agree I think teams need to take more risks but I also entirely understand why they don't. Butler forced his way to Miami. Has a player in the entire history of the Toronto Raptors ever forced his way there? You know what the answer is. As a Miami fan do you think that free agents are just as likely to go there as they are Utah, Toronto, Indiana, Denver or Portland? Every time someone brings up Miami being a destination for free agents I always see a bunch of Heat fans talking about how great there front office is and all the smart moves they made. And guess what? Nobody is denying any of those things, these free agent destinations have to make the right moves and be well run to win nobody is saying that that isn't the case (except maybe the Lakers). But I know that as a Toronto Raptors fan, I know they will never have a player of the caliber of Chris Bosh, Jimmy Butler or Lebron James ever sign with this team in free agency barring some extremely exceptional circumstances or some future Canadian superstar but even that is extremely unlikely."
"They certainly both turn out to be cant miss, superstar prospects, but at the time ( in Embid's case a couple seasons after being drafted ) there was enough questions and doubters to cause teams not to pick them first or second.   To be clear, I'm not categorizing where these players **should've** been viewed as, but rather where they were regarded as.  For example, with the benefit of hindsight, Jimmy Butler&amp; Draymond Green **should've** been viewed as high lottery prospects, but they **WERE** viewed as late first rounders at best at the time they were drafted."
"If we replaced LeBron, with say, that same years Jimmy Butler (who was an all star) they'd still be called a superteam and heavy favorite to leave the East.   Does   Irving-Smith-Butler-Love-Thompson not have a great chance of beating the   Lowry-DeRozan-Carroll-Ibaka-Valanciunas Raptors or   Thomas-Smart-Bradley-Crowder-Horford Celtics  which were the other 2 best non Cavs teams in the East that year"
"&gt; People clamoring draymond out  The funniest part is that he deserved to be out. It wasn't some unfortunate injury or anything, it was _his_ fault. His antics have always been part of who he is.  Saying ""if Draymond wasn't out"" is like saying ""if Jimmy Butler shot well from 3 they would have defeated the Lakers last year"""
Tied with Jimmy Butler if you know what I mean
You say getting outplayed by a 36 year old duncan like that's something to be ashamed of. Man is the best of his position all time.  That's like giving out that Jimmy Butler got outplayed by a nearly 36 year old Bron last finals
"nope never not in a million years. He was a nobody his first couple years, blew a 2-0 lead to the raptors, refused to guard Jimmy butler and lost to a 5th seed. Goat debate is over for him before it started. and that's not including his inability to shoot, make FT consistently, scoring titles, deferring to Khris to closeout games, etc."
"trades are still a thing. for example, if the cost to get Jimmy Butler in 2018 was only Robert Covington and Dario Saric i don‚Äôt see how they couldnt have competed with that offer"
Keep adding more players and picks maybe Jimmy Butler
"Depends on when, today? Not that much, not dame for sure, but like during the jimmy butler situation in Minnesota that could've gotten him, could've maybe beat Toronto's offer for kawhi, probably not James harden last season but that's more value then the rockets ended up maintaining so"
"I don't hate the Wolves for any Bulls related reason (unless you count the Jimmy Butler saga).  I just think they're the worst NBA team in existence. They've got KAT, who's supposed to be incredibly talented and able to win, yet they can't do anything positive despite having him. Wiggins was a bust. They get Jimmy for one year and he drags their asses to the playoffs for the first time in forever. He leaves because they're all garbage. They get D'Angelo Russell to complement KAT and they're still hot garbage.   No matter what they do, they're the worst. An embarrassment to Minnesota."
&gt;Paul George at #5  Yeah right behind Bubble Murray and Bubble Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler, Thybulle, and Okogie"
Jimmy Butler
"The fact that it should have been a flagrant on CP3, and also Booker got away with 3 last game, and 1 obvious one this game. Why would the NBA want to promote giannis over CP3, Dbook, Trae Young, KD, Kyrie,  Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo?"
"Yeah, I am still a big Jimmy Butler fan. Ironically Middleton is exactly the type of player you'd want to pair him with -- someone who can score on or off ball, but doesn't need to have the ball all the time.  Middleton's skill type is rare, that's why he's so valuable. Klay Thompson, Paul George, Brad Beal -- there's not a ton of guys like that. Sometimes it's harder to find a great #2 guy than a #1."
"I strongly disagree that he was hidden in the regular season. During the regular season, it was a hobby of mine to key in on Bryn Forbes on most defensive possessions that he was in the game. The frequency that he let someone blow by him on a cut for an open layup, his inability/unwillingness to fight over screens, his inability to contest shots, and his lack of resistance when ‚Äúhelping‚Äù made for an extremely negative defensive impact. He did get blown by on switches at times, but his 1 on 1 defense was solid when defending forwards, slower guards, and non-shooters. In the Heat series, the Heat tried to target Bryn and put him on Jimmy Butler, but that was the perfect matchup for Bryn because he could give Jimmy a cushion and body him up with his stocky frame. That was the only period in the season where Bryn was a positive defender. In the regular season, he was terrible defensively. Advanced stats and lineup data agree."
"For such a highly regarded and well publicized college player, I don‚Äôt know that KAT is super beloved across the league either. The beef with Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt help."
"I know that this has to be a troll considering the username, but implying the Heat would have won their series with Oladipo playing after you got swept in convincing fashion and Butler played like literal garbage and also ignoring the Bucks lost a starter for the season in that series is hilarious. Sure the Nets most likely win with all 3 stars healthy, but I would say there was at least a 50% chance one of their stars went down in the playoffs considering two of them had lingering soft tissue injuries and the other has gotten hurt or missed half of his playoff runs. The Hawks one isn‚Äôt worth discussing since Giannis is better than Trae and they both missed time, plus the Bucks won without Giannis and with Trae back. On top of all that the Bucks are up 3-2 against the Suns with no real reports around on a CP3 injury, yet we know the Bucks lost a starter already and we all saw Giannis‚Äôs knee bend backwards 2 weeks ago. In the end the only team the Bucks wouldn‚Äôt have likely beat without injury would have been the Nets, but that‚Äôs just the way the league goes. Have fun fading into mediocrity, see you here next year when Oladipo is injured for your next playoff run and you convince yourself that whoever wins the championship was lucky they didn‚Äôt need to face the true best team in the East with the 5th best player in the East leading the way in Jimmy Buckets."
Because that's a year later? The Heat that year took 2 games of a healthy Laker team with all of their best players besides Jimmy Butler injured.
Khris Middleton is a better player than Jimmy Butler. Change my mind.
"I don't think anyone's denying this is a flop. To go through Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Trae Young - all to pull this off in Chris Paul's face and get the call? Legendary."
How can you not root for the team that swept Jimmy Butler in round 1 and got rid of Trae Young???? They are America‚Äôs team ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
not Jimmy Butler type of gassed though
Dont let this game distract you from the fact that Jimmy Butler clapped Rachel Nichols cheeks in the bubble.
This The same dude that outscored Jimmy Butler
JIMMY BUTLER IS CRYING IN THE CORNER. HOLDING A PICTURE OF JAE CROWDER
"We agree, based on what‚Äôs known now you‚Äôd rather have Ingram.  Hypothetical: Mitchell wants out of Utah and the offers on the table are Jimmy Butler &amp; two 1st, or a package of Jonathan Isaac, Fultz, Okeke, &amp; 2 1st. Which do you take, knowing you‚Äôre job is to build a winning team."
Jimmy Butler wasn‚Äôt stupid ready for the jungle cruise.
Damn they really used Polymerization on Jimmy Butler and Jarret Allen
Apparently Jimmy Butler plugged her.
U'd need Damian Lillard and then also a Jimmy Butler or Chris Paul or someone on that level.
why would we trade Jimmy Butler like did you think this out before you typed it up?
We need to stop using acronyms for the vast majority of players.   Jimmy butler is not JB. He‚Äôs butler. You gotta be top 5 in the league for an acronym
Thats what Jimmy Butler actually said.
"&gt;The contract doesn‚Äôt require him to be excited to play or play with gusto. It just requires that he get out there and play.   And the contract doesn't require that the owner put together a championship contender. It just requires that they pay the player the amount specified.  I don't think this is an ethical issue. Meaning that they are ethically entitled to anything, but I also wouldn't say that any players have done anything unethical by demanding a trade and withholding their full effort. I just think it's immature. When Jimmy Butler destroyed relationships with his teammates to force a trade I thought that was immature. Could he do it? Sure. Do I have to respect it? No, and I don't.   Players can do things within the bounds of the contract to cause me to lose respect for them. It works the other way too, by the way. If the Cavs started publicly calling for Kevin Love to retire. I'd think it was kind of shitty. Probably not unethical, but kind of shitty. Same thing if they tried paying him with dump trucks of loose pennies. Something doesn't have to be technically prohibited by the contract to be a shitty thing to do. So when players don't try to win or actively try to sabotage their team, I think it's shitty and unprofessional and I lose respect for them."
Dame needs to grow the fuck up. He's trying to preserve his image with his teammates while also complaining that his supporting cast is inadequate.  They could have been making a trade for an All-star for awhile now but he's too enamored with the idea of winning with CJ as his running mate. A few years ago they could have been serious players in both the Paul George (Indy) and Jimmy Butler (Minny) sweepstakes. But they missed both opportunities and ended up blowing their assets on stop gap wings. They still don't have a competent SF on the roster. Now they're stuck with no real way of contention.
4-1 the Jimmy Butler wolves 4-1 the jazz then 3-2 against the greatest team ever assembled. But hey regular season stats! Give up.
"Almost all of those players straight up resigned with their team and got super max deals which are one of the few carrots that small market teams can offer superstars. Additionally a good amount of those players then left those teams to go to large markets. IE Steve Nash to the Lakers, Jimmy Butler from Minnesota to Miami , Dwight Howard to Lakers, LMA from Spurs to Brooklyn. Even mentioning Kevin Durant is the antithesis of your point. He joint one of the GOAT teams in the 3rd biggest market in the country.  It‚Äôs a total misnomer saying superstars pick small market teams. More often then not super stars ditch small markets to go to places where they can market themselves better or places with lower income tax."
&gt; Jimmy Butler who shot less than 30% from the field in the finals?  ??? he shot 55% from the field in the Finals last year
Jimmy Butler who shot less than 30% from the field in the finals? You tell me
So should Jimmy Butler have won it last year then?
Jimmy butler is a capable #1 option on a contender.
"&gt; Charles Barkley  Maybe? Different era.  &gt; Joe Johnson  [One of the first high profile cases on small market teams having to pay non-deserving max contracts to land meh talent](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/414272-atlanta-hawks-ink-joe-johnson-to-119-million-over-six-year-deal)  Literally goes against the argument you are trying to make.  &gt; Steve Nash (prime)  Sure fine  &gt; Tim Duncan  Drafted on a team and won a ring in his second season.  The best coach in NBA history and the most stable franchise in the NBA.  All In a state with no income tax.  Not even a small market, the second highest population state in the U.S. and one of the highest populated cities.  This is idiotic.  &gt; Kyle Lowry  This example doesn't even make sense.  Guy never even made an all-star game until after signing with Toronto lmao. He only signed 4 years/48 million.  Far from a star at that time.  &gt; Jimmy Butler  Uhh do I really need to list off reasons why Miami is a hugley coveted location for players?  Add on that no income tax bonus.  &gt; Russell Westbrook  The dude got a fucking supermax 200 million dollar deal gtfo.  Next.  &gt; Yao Ming  lol he agreed to a 4 year max after not playing for a year with foot surgery.  Chinese national I don't think playing for NY is exactly a priority anyways  &gt; Dwight Howard  I mean.. i guess  &gt; Kevin Garnett  I mean he left Minnesota (small market) team for Boston (big market) team so idk..  &gt; Kevin Durant 1.0 free agency (picked Dubs over NYC/LA, who had space and wanted him)  This is the absolute dumbest thing I have ever read.  The most valuable, most marketable team in the NBA.  A city thats constantly ranked as one of the best places to live in all of America.  Like seriously just so dumb.  Oh and he formed the best team in NBA history.  &gt; Andre Iguadala  ahahahah ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah ahahahahahahahahahaahahah.  This is when I knew you just started just naming NBA players you could think of.  &gt; LaMarcus Aldridge  Sure?  &gt; Giannis AttentDoIhaveToKeepGoingo?  Uhh he just signed his supermax.  No shit.    Nobody has ever made the argument stars literally just won't sign with more undesirable locations.  The argument is it's harder, and the teams often have to overpay (ie Joe Johnson).  The fact that we are even comparing star talent like Damian Lillard to Iggy and Joe Johnson shows how far you are reaching with your narrative."
Jimmy Butler and Damian Lillard
"Paul George, and Jimmy Butler each had similar levels of speculation 1 year before they eventually got traded the first time.  Both were thought to be for sure traded at the trade deadline before they actually got traded in the offseason instead."
Shades of Kyrie trade. Shades of harden trade. Shades of Kawhi trade. Shades of the AD trade. Shades of the Jimmy Butler trade.   We‚Äôve seen this song before. We‚Äôve seen 5-6 other fan bases post these exact comments in as many years.
Jimmy Butler. By far one of the most overrated players in the league.
Jimmy Butler
"lmfao, I see you're just a Dray hater  Plenty of wing defense with Lebron and KD, PG is entirely redundant in this group  Jimmy Butler is a worse Lebron  Dray is better than Bam at everything except scoring, which again is redundant with literally every other player on this list  Why tf you being so salty lol? Cuz your little excuse to hate on Draymond doesn't make sense and you got called on it?  &gt; Just stop bro, I‚Äôm getting secondhand embarrassment.  I don't think anyone over the age of 13 talks like this lmao"
"Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo who is literally on the team.  Just stop bro, I‚Äôm getting secondhand embarrassment."
"We are absolutely not moving Ben for CJ when there‚Äôs this much uncertainty around Dame and he‚Äôs the big fish. Especially when Portland won‚Äôt be able to make moves/signings to dramatically improve beyond the 4 seed out west and will likely flame out again in the playoffs which would drive him to demand out once again. I bet it‚Äôll be like Harden or Jimmy Butler where the move gets made early-mid way through the year. Even if they wanted to, there is nothing Olshey can do to change that team composition enough to make them a legit title contender while they‚Äôre capped out, aren‚Äôt a destination, and have had guys with injury issues several yrs running now."
Jimmy Butler trade would have taken JB and the pick that became JT iirc.
I don‚Äôt think until the Harden trade Jaylen was clearly above other prospects being offered. Maybe Jimmy Butler before that? I don‚Äôt really remember how good Jaylen was playing at that point and who else was being offered.
"It‚Äôs not illegal or immoral. You guys are acting like we sacrificed puppies and kittens for picks. The thunder aren‚Äôt going to get lebron, Bosh, or jimmy butler in free agency or S&amp;T. Our only hope for a player like that is to tank. Our best free agent signings in franchise history is probably Nerlens Noel. Also do you think the rockets and pistons were trying to win every game?"
Jimmy Butler PR company presents - Keldon Johnson
"2-in-1: Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt good enough to be rhe best player on a championship team, and he should be really ashamed of himself  JB has been my fav player since I started watching NBA (5-6 years ago), but he disappointed me A LOT vs the Bucks this year."
This has shades of that story explaining how Jimmy Butler didn't have rear-view mirrors in his car to symbolize never looking back.
"It's not the moves they make it's the ones they don't. We've needed a second star for years and had ample assets to get in done. In 2018, for example, CJ was 26 and we had three first round picks. How tf did we not parlay that into Paul George or Jimmy Butler or something?"
"This is actually the stage where you know you're a proper contender.  Us lot are still in the ""Well statistically, RJ Barrett's progression compares favourably with Jimmy Butler and ....."" stage"
"He doesn‚Äôt belong between 10-15 either. He‚Äôs more 15-20 There‚Äôs scorers like him or better who bring more to the table in that range. After the top 11:  Paul George - similar offensive player + good defense and better playmaker  Kyrie Irving - as a scorer, is a better ball handler, 3 point shooter, midrange shooter, and finisher + is a better playmaker  Trae Young - similar scoring numbers but is miles ahead as a playmaker, so he doesn‚Äôt have games where he doesn‚Äôt make an impact   Jimmy Butler - He had 22/7/7 on All-NBA defense and the best advanced stats of his career this season. I get he struggled in the 4 game sample size this playoffs, but he has shown he delivers in the past.  I‚Äôd also take CP3 over him, but I get how Butler and CP3 could be arguable. Booker is in line with Mitchell, Towns, and Beal. Puts him at 15-20"
"I read that at as ""most fans have booker in thier top 10 players right now""  And I was channeling my inner jimmy butler.   ""I'm fucking hot!! I'm mad!!"""
"Eh ? Just 8 months ago we saw him show high on ball screens against Lillard then recover to the rim, consistently guard 3-on-4 situations after the guards had doubled Harden against Houston, single handedly neutralise the Jokic/Murray pick and roll cos he could switch onto either, then completely shut down a red hot Jimmy Butler in Game 4 of the Finals and close it out with an all-time rim protecting performance in Game 6.  AD objectively had an all-time great defensive playoff run last year."
* I honestly thought that Bledsoe would become what Jimmy Butler is.  * Deandre Ayton is going to be better than KAT.
Yeah dude's catch and shoot is pure as shit. I remember dude killed Jimmy butler a couple of years ago just because jimmy can't keep up with him off ball.
"lmao did you forget that jimmy butler basically on his own took you to 6 while missing half his starting lineup. How do you figure that series would have gone if he had Embiid on AD and Simmons on Lebron for defense.   Facts are that the teams that the lakers faced had huge defensive holes. Portlands defense is almost non-existent, Houston had Pj Tucker playing Centre, and Denver had Jokic who isn't protecting anything inside. Hell if it wasn't for the break before the bubble I doubt AD's body would have help up till the finals.   You can have all the confidence in the world that your Lakers would beat the Raptors. But to think that you just run over a finals team because of the bubble is a joke. Raptors would win in 6 or 7"
"Wanna mention what did Jimmy Butler did?  U remember what the reactions were when Lakers lost game 1 in the Portland AND Houston series? Guess what happened afterwards..... Gentleman sweeps. That was a legit, meaningful title.   Not the MOST meaningful title, but ‚Äúlegit‚Äù"
The people who said Jimmy Butler &gt; Paul George last year. LOL  Love Butler though. Just hate who he plays for
I think people like the idea of Jimmy Butler more than they like his actual game.
"I got a Tatum statement jersey  for the Celtics ofc, but I bought a Jimmy Butler Miami vice jersey last year since they‚Äôre so fire"
Butler did an S&amp;T just to get to Miami. He wanted to play there. Butler isn't a ring chaser and wants to be a leader on the team. No way would he request a trade to GSW nor would Riley trade him to GSW. Makes no sense to include jimmy in  trade to golden state
His real skill was foul drawing. He has a higher free throw rate than Jimmy Butler.
The Jimmy butler one was low key racism
Lmao Jimmy Butler was the best one I think
"Jimmy Butler signing a $184 million extension. He was the 30th pick and he was an ""old"" draft pick."
Laughed so hard at Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler is the only person who dragged that trash franchise to the playoffs since Kevin Garnett.  Jimmy might be insane, but you need to be a little insane to compete at the highest level.  The best versions of the Sixers, Bulls, Wolves and Miami in the last decade all have Jimmy in common.  He‚Äôs a winner, and it‚Äôs not Jimmy who is the whiny bitch.  It‚Äôs the people who are mad he wasn‚Äôt nice as he left shit franchises."
Kevin love     Jimmy butler    Karl Anthony towns
Fuck Jimmy Butler. He's a whiny little bitch.
"If the Heat's top backcourt is Lowry - Robinson - Butler, and Jimmy is guarding the bigger, stronger, more physical assignment between him and Robinson, plus Robinson lives at the perimeter while Jimmy's shot is broken, does that not make Duncan Robinson the shooting guard and Jimmy Butler the small forward?"
If Jimmy Butler won it it‚Äôd be even more of a ‚Äúfake‚Äù ring
"Surprised to see a heat fan take him over jimmy, but those are both elite players who need different situations. Maybe for starting a team I‚Äôd take butler"
"They‚Äôve had had the talent to make the play in. Just don‚Äôt know if they piece it together.   In the last 18 years, they‚Äôve been to the playoffs once. And jimmy was there. Butler seems to get every team he plays for to be better"
Simmons for Lillard at the time would have been possible with some other assets swap maybe but Lillard James embiid would rule the league. Jimmy butler would be a horrible fit though
"Oh 100% he has everything. Speed, strength, IQ, but wingspan is the only thing he‚Äôs lacking imo, Kawhi is 6‚Äô7 with a 7‚Äô3 wingspan and Bron is 6‚Äô9 with a 7‚Äô0 wingspan. Wingspan isn‚Äôt a massive downfall ( Jimmy Butler is amazing defender for example ) but it‚Äôs enough to make a difference between an above average defender to an all-time lockdown defender"
"Considering the Ben Simmons saga at the moment, The lucky Kawhi shot that took Toronto to the finals and played against an injured Golden State team, Oh lets not forget ‚ÄúThe process‚Äù, almost killing Zhaire smith at a team lunch, Fultz forgetting to shoot, Losing Jimmy Butler, Trading Mikal Bridges for no reason, Our GM had a burner account criticizing Embid and had to quit, Why must you torture us Philly fans like this?Have we not suffered enough?"
"I mean, when you look at that list, 4 of those seasons his player played the most minutes in the league. None of them outside of butler 18-19 was lower than 4th most minutes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence.    2011-12 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 39.4 MPG - 1st   2010-11 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 39.1 MPG - 4th   2012-13 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 38.7 MPG - 1st   2013-14 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG - 2nd   2014-15 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG - 1st   2020-21 ‚Äî Julius Randle, 37.6 MPG - 1st   2016-17 ‚Äî Andrew Wiggins, 37.2 MPG - 3rd   2017-18 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 36.7 MPG - 3rd   2018-19 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 36.1 MPG - 27th"
PG: Luka Doncic SG: Derrick Rose SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Lebron James C: Joakim Noah  We‚Äôd shoot terribly but I‚Äôm taking my chances
Rachel Nicols and Jimmy Butler... There I said it! It's the all time NBA duo.
"i mean except for the fact that Kuminga didn‚Äôt face poverty and the fact that some people‚Äôs struggles don‚Äôt invalidate others. Jimmy Butler, for example, had it hard and shouldn‚Äôt be cringed at for talking about it"
I‚Äôll take Jimmy Butler over Booker in a playoff run
Jimmy Butler.
"Jimmy butler, people were saying TJ Warren was better than him."
PG: Kyrie  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Paul George  PF: Zion  C: Embiid
"I think the idea that Lebron would have had Ben traded is revisionist. I just can't see Philly moving him at that time, although who knows how it might unfold over the course of several seasons.  &gt; Does this team possibly 3 peat?  The fuck?  &gt; Do they still get Jimmy Butler &amp; Tobias Harris?  No"
I think jimmy butler is the most overrated star ive ever seen in my life... and i think if draymond green was drafted to any other team in the league and i think he is just a meme like pat bev
"There‚Äôs truth to the meme, but in reality none of his players have come close. Here are the annual leaders for his teams:    2011-12 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 39.4 MPG   2010-11 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 39.1 MPG   2012-13 ‚Äî Luol Deng, 38.7 MPG   2013-14 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG   2014-15 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 38.7 MPG   2020-21 ‚Äî Julius Randle, 37.6 MPG   2016-17 ‚Äî Andrew Wiggins, 37.2 MPG   2017-18 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 36.7 MPG   2018-19 ‚Äî Jimmy Butler, 36.1 MPG    For comparison, Monta Ellis played 40.34 in 2010-11, the last time a player averaged over 40 MPG, something that has been done [more than 250 times in NBA history](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/mp_per_g_season.html). Allen Iverson owns the highest mark of the 21st century, playing 43.7 MPG in 2001-02."
I think this means Jimmy Butler is responsible for ten percent of the TWolves playoff games‚Ä¶. And he was there for like a year lol
"this is actually a good example of why even with tearing the ACL, Murray can still come back and be a great hooper. Yes, Murray uses some athleticism here but this layup is more about body control and timing. Those are hard skills that many uber athletic players don‚Äôt necessarily master, but even losing a little bit of natural explosiveness can be compensated for if you have the IQ to recover. Jimmy Butler is another guy with great body control which is why even though he‚Äôs lost half a step he was playing his best ball only a year ago."
"[Kelly Iko] KAT extremely upset in the tunnel, slams the wall heading into the locker room. Someone with the Wolves yells ‚ÄúKAT come on, quit being a f***ing p***y!‚Äù [It] was Jimmy Butler"
This steams from the dumb rumors that Jimmy butler left because his teammates weren‚Äôt as serious as him that also ignore that most of those rumors dealt specifically with Wiggins who also was dealt a gigantic contract right before. Lol
"If you take the one season from Jimmy Butler away, they have exactly zero playoff wins in 17 seasons."
"I love Jimmy Butler. I love his name, I love the shape of his body, I love the way he plays. I eat a lot of boiled eggs and lift weights to try and be like this guy but I can't. There are 6 grams of protein in an egg but I can't eat enough to get big like him. Nice round muscles. They're smooth too, like the waves of lake superior on a calm day. When I was a kid I ate big eggs to be hot like Glenn Robinson, and I got some great results, some of the roundest muscles in my class, but these days I'm looking at 6 eggs a day and it's not good enough to pop Jimmy style muscles out my scrawny arms ever since dad left."
The Heat wouldve beaten the lakers if Adebayo and Dragic were healthy . Jimmy Butler alone took the lakers to 6 .
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"As a part time Wolves fan, the Wolves fucked over Jimmy Butler and not the other way around."
Lebron probably already gets his jersey retired by the Lakers. Giannis for the past 2 seasons get his jersey retired by the Bucks. Jimmy Butler for the Heat. And Kawhi was good for all his seasons for the Spurs for the role that he played.
JJ Redick    PG - Luka Doncic   SG - Vince Carter   SF -  Jimmy Butler   PF - Zion Williamson   C - Dwight Howard    BENCH   PG - Chris Paul   SG - Jrue Holiday   SF - Brandon Ingram   PF - Rashard Lewis   C - Joel Embiid
"Jaylen Brown just put up 25ppg and is an all-star at 24. He wouldn't be the centerpiece in the Beal scenario.  For reference, Miami gave up Josh Richardson to get Jimmy Butler."
U are his lil bros Bam lmao. This KD we talking about not Jimmy Butler or some shit
"Yep. If you're going to be a deadbeat scumbag of a father, at least have good genes to pass down to your kids. I bet Jimmy Butler also feels the same way."
Jimmy Butler better be in the next poll
"Joel Embiid   Also, I love Tatum, but him and Book should not be here, PG and Jimmy Butler should be here instead, due to their superior experience and IQ."
So are we just using PPG as a argument he was slowed down. Giannis damn near averaged a triple double 24/15/8 all while completely locking up Jimmy Butler . Also outside of Game 1 every other game was a Blowout by halftime With giannis taking jumpers and 3's in the 3rd quarter for fun. If you are gonna paint a picture don't leave things out for your agenda.
"Giannis was more of a facilitator against the heat,he damn near averaged a triple double ( 24/15/8) and that's his WORST series the entire playoffs. Outside of game 1 the bucks were blowing the heat out by halftime games 2,3 and 4. Also he put jimmy butler in jail on defense to the point Bryn Forbes outscored jimmy the entire series"
"Yes everyone shot long twos back then, which is why it‚Äôs important to adjust for leaguewide efficiency.   Kobe definitely took more long midrange than short. For his career he took 17% of his shots from the 10-16 foot range and 27% from the 16-3P range. 06 is also a weird year to start because the three prior years Kobe was under 40% from the 10-16 range you mentioned which would bring down his average from 46.5% from 06-13 to 44% from 03-13.   Kobe‚Äôs definitely an underrated finisher at the rim and it was probably the best part of his game. Trying to extrapolate that to modern day is tough though. He also wasn‚Äôt a good volume 3pt shooter so I think it‚Äôs debatable if he‚Äôd be better today. Kobe today would probably be a better version of Jimmy Butler, for example. Their playstyles and strengths are very similar.   The point still stands though that Kobe‚Äôs really the only all time great to be less efficient than league average from the field. He definitely took more tough shots than was necessary in a lot of cases and he had to get to line to be efficient. He was definitely a great player and an all time great scorer but the perception that he wasn‚Äôt all that efficient (and moreso that his style wasn‚Äôt efficient) isn‚Äôt completely baseless like some people have now overcorrected to saying."
"Ok you are getting a little to defensive, it not some massive insult to Giannis to say one of the best and most versatile power forwards is narrowly better at a few areas of the game than Giannis. Like good lord man, I understand being a homer, but you're making it seem like I'm trashing Giannis by suggesting one of the best defensive bigs ever was better at specific skills.  KG was a 9 time all first time defense (3 time 2nd team) and also a DPOY.  If we really want to try and compare them, KG has a slightly higher DBPM (2.1 vs 1.9) and a better defensive rating (99 vs 104)...please stop acting insulted, its a huge credit to Giannis that he is in the same conversation as the big ticket...and they should be in the same conversation to be clear, both elite defensive players.  Before I go through and respond to these individual clips, its not some huge accomplishment to have one off nice defensive plays, its much more meaningful if I can find examples of bad defense vs examples of simply covering a guy well. I expect most NBA players to be able to stay in front their man most of the time, outside of terrible mismatches, its not some accomplishment to have examples of someone **not** getting burned, but how often do you find clips of guys like Jrue or Smart or Kawhi getting embarrassed or easily beat. Those guys almost never get beat...thats the mark of if a guy is an elite perimeter, on ball defender, if a big guy can simply hold his own out there, thats still respectable.  Anyway:  Your video on Giannis covering KD consists of KD taking like 2 dribbles to his right and pulling up, how is it an accomplishment that Giannis was able to keep with that?   [Here is a clip of KD cooking Giannis](https://youtu.be/BVgOgfbsWJk)  [Here is another](https://youtu.be/BVgOgfbsWJk?t=137)  [Here is one where KD is able to generate enough space to shoot in Giannis's face](https://youtu.be/BVgOgfbsWJk?t=39)  [Here is KD easily blowing by Giannis, although Giannis waits for the block from behind](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=7)  [Here KD drives on Giannis and is able to muscle up a little floater, nothing too special but interesting that Giannis couldn't contest this considering the strength difference](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=15)  [Here is KD dancing on Giannis and easily getting separation for the 3](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=51)  [Here is KD effortlessly blowing by Giannis on the perimeter](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=60)  [Here is KD blowing by Giannis for the layup](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=122)  [And here is KD once again blowing by Giannis](https://youtu.be/rOEhtFGPdAU?t=161)   Your next two clips of all star games LOL Kyrie didn't make any sharp cuts or misdirection moves, that clip shows nothing. For the Lebron clip, Giannis actually gets left in the dust off that screen and recovers for the block....I don't see how that disproves my view of his on-ball defense. We all know he is great at getting blocks from behind or coming from out of view, but he wasn't able to stay with Bron here.   For the Kobe clip, yes that was very solid defense on a 37 year old Kobe lol   I'm not sure if you watched this video about the Heat or not, but its a bit of a mixed bag. There are at least 5 of so examples of him not being able to keep with guys off a screen, similar to the Lebron clip. Also fun little observation here, I noticed he is matching up against Jimmy a lot in this series, so obviously they have no problem throwing him on the other teams best player...so your excuse about him not covering KD makes absolutely no sense...fyi  For the Suns clips, there were a few nice clips of him actually defending against guards, but there were also a few where he allowed CP3 to get a ton of separation (only to miss the jumper). A lot these clips involving Booker were at the end of shot clocks where he knew he had to pull up, so I take those with a grain of salt.  Watching all these clips, its clear he is absolutely elite getting blocks, either trailing, coming over to help, or just in the post...his length allows him to contest a lot of plays where he got beat and bothers them at the last second...thats what we already knew he was good at and what I've already acknowledged he is great atl.  &gt;KG would not have guarded any of those any better. Like i'm tired off people who haven't really really watched Giannis underrate his game.  KG had more lateral quickness in his early days, I absolutely think he was quicker and had more foot speed than Giannis...he was also way lighter (less muscle) so that really shouldn't be a surprise...the theme here to me is that you are the one underrating KG more than I'm underrating Giannis...fyi, Garnett was a really good passer. Giannis is more of a ball handler so he naturally has way more opportunities to get assists, but Garnett was a really good passer out of the post and at the top of the key...hard to really say who is better or worse there, but once again, not some massive insult.  &gt;ave Giannis guard KD on one end and expect him to score 40 points the other end. Are you nuts? No smart coach puts their no1 offensive option on the opponents no1 offensive option no matter how good they are defensively.   This is the part I have the biggest beef with for multiple reasons...I understand the logic of preserving energy and avoiding fouls, but there are plenty of two way stars who match up with the opponents best players...and you literally provided evidence that the Bucks have no problem matching Giannis on Butler in the Heat series, so that argument caries no water. Giannis wouldn't have to score 40 if he could just limit KD's scoring, especially once it was literally just KD vs the Bucks.   Also, even if you didn't want Giannis to waste his energy....what is your argument for not covering KD late in games, or during critical possessions or in OT? Surely you're saying that Giannis is such an elite on ball defender and the only guy on the court who can possibly match KD's length, so why wouldn't the Bucks selectively force that defensive matchup if thats what they wanted?  The answer is because Giannis can't consistently keep with KD and even though KD is really matchup proof, Tucker gave you guys the best odds, not Giannis. This is 100% a terrible argument on your part."
"Your last sentence is where I'd slightly disagree. I don't think anybody gets as much shit as Giannis for taking shots in the moment. People do call out Russ for chucking sometimes, but you never have commentators gasping ""why'd he do that?!?"" the instant he releases the ball like they started doing all playoffs for Giannis.  Jimmy Butler shot like 24% (6% lower than Giannis) in the regular season, but since there doesn't yet exist this echo chamber around his bad shots, nobody was outraged whenever he shot a 3 on his way to being outscored by Brynn Forbes."
"Lol it's not screwing over the franchise if they only get 2 picks instead of 5.  The difference with making a S&amp;T happen and signing a 5 year ""with the understanding they would help trade him in a year"" is it takes ALL of the power away from Beal.  So what if Boston makes another ""bad offer"" again.  The Wizards tell Beal they couldn't milk enough out of the Celtics so he has to stay another year?  The S&amp;T makes it an absolute that he goes where he wants to go.  The Wizards had a chance to trade Beal last offseason for a massive haul.  They can trade him again this season for a good haul.  If they wait until next offseason, they will have almost no leverage and be at the mercy of where Beal wants to play.  And if he wants to play for a team over the cap, I guarantee you the Wizards will help facillitate it because getting something back to let him play for the Celtics is better than screwing themselves, Beal and the Celtics over just so he can sign with San Antonio, Detroit etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Look at the Jimmy Butler S&amp;T again.  The Sixers literally only got Josh Richardson back.  Lowry only netted Precious and a bad Dragic contract.  If the Wizards wanted an actual return for Beal, they should have traded him last year.    &amp;#x200B;  But why would Boston want to do Smart and 5 firsts this year without a long term guarantee on Beal (he would not do an extension because he could get more with a new contract) when they can do 2 firsts and guarantee Beal for at least 3 years next offseason.  If Beal signs elsewhere next season (anywhere, not just Boston), I guarantee you the Wizards will facillitate a S&amp;T and it will be for much lower than Beal's value.  The point of a S&amp;T isn't to net equal value for Beal, it's so he can play where he wants to play, and the Wizards get a little something back for playing nice.  Like I said, they aren't going to screw themselves, Beal and whoever is signing him just to spite that team."
"Tbh cap space doesn't really matter if Beal wants to sign with Boston next summer.  They can just facillitate a S&amp;T.  Wizards aren't going to cut off their nose to spite their face.  If they don't help Beal, it's not like he would then re-sign with the Wizards.  They'd probably rather get 2 firsts out of it and let Beal sign with Boston instead of getting nothing and letting Beal sign with someone else (like Spurs) who can clear space.  &amp;#x200B;  Bottom line is they would never get fair value back for Beal if Beal intends to leave.  Look at the Jimmy Butler or even Kyle Lowry deals."
KAT The most disrespected player in the nba currently. I saw the pic and reflexively went to comment ‚ÄúKAT scored there‚Äù and then saw that my boys got it. You‚Äôve freed up my time to go post some jimmy butler 2021 playoff stats
"yeah lol. Just off the top of my head, whenever me and my friends are discussing ball, i think most players we name who are at least stars, we use a nickname for. Since I'm bored, and I like this convo, I searched up the top 50 nba players, and came up with this reddit thread.    https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/opvw06/a_detailed_look_at_the_top_50_players_in_the_nba/  If you notice, even for a lot of the guys outside the top 10, there are a lot of nicknames/short names that you refer to them as. Ja, Bam, Shai, Vuc, Zion, Trae, Book, CP3, PG, KAT (altho in real life I never say KAT, I always say towns, even tho in real life I actually use PG and CP a lot), Jimmy (although I equally use butler), BI. But like once you start getting further down, there are less nicknames and more last names/full names used"
"Direct rankings are hard. I prefer tier systems that allow for a bit more fluidity. Otherwise there‚Äôs a lot of victim of the moment stuff going on where we just knee-jerk react to the latest stat line. ‚ÄúOh shit, harden dropped 60. Smh you guys have curry above him.‚Äù ‚ÄúGiannis just had 35/20 on crazy efficiency. Imagine putting the washed king above him smh.‚Äù Etc  In that same vein, the past 3-4 years I‚Äôve had a tier 1 with only 6 players - up until this offseason where it bumped up to 7.   No particular order: Giannis, lebron, KD, Steph, kawhi, harden, Jokic.  All of these guys have an MVP (except kawhi, who has two finals MVPs), all have rings except for Harden and Jokic. Think they have all proven they can be the best player on a championship level team (even if the latter two haven‚Äôt won, they are able to compete at that level IMO). The hardware in this tier is crazy with the MVPs, finals MVPs, scoring titles, assist champions, DPOYs, all nba/all defense teams etc. Some people may object to putting Jokic in this tier, but I think his MVP cements it, personally.  So after the top 7, I‚Äôd have a second tier if guys who are incredibly good but haven‚Äôt quite reached that top level yet.   again no particular order: embiid, luka, dame, AD and maybe Paul George? He‚Äôs right on the edge Imo. I could easily see dropping him down to like the next tier with guys like jimmy butler, gobert, etc.  I think it‚Äôs hard to just do a straight numerical ranking when guys are certain levels are just so interchangeable with one another night to night. There are definite tier breaks where there‚Äôs a clear line of demarcation, though."
We really aren‚Äôt lmao. He‚Äôs just a good center with tons of promise and we‚Äôre happy that he‚Äôs signed.   Worry about Jimmy ‚ÄúI got outscored by Bryn Forbes‚Äù Butler
"If Beal hits free agency the Wizards lose almost all of their leverage. In a sign-and-trade the Wizards wouldn't get Brown back. Look back at the Jimmy Butler deal, again - Miami is capped, Butler chooses them, what Miami trades out is Josh Richardson and Hassan Whiteside. In this case, Butler is a better player than Beal, Richardson is a less valuable player than Smart, and Whiteside was getting paid more than Horford. Philly only got Richardson back."
"S&amp;T was always the plan because signing outright would've required Boston to renounce/waive almost the entire roster. Star players move via sign and trades, that's just how it is. Exhibit 1a: Jimmy Butler."
"Interesting, in that sense I agree with you on AD. Serious disagreement on how Jokic is not 1A though. He carried that broken nuggets team all the way past the (actually healthy) blazers.   I'd probably put Jimmy butler at 1B, except for last year when he had covid he's put teams entirely on his back during the playoffs.  I would probably drop cp3 at least to 1C if not lower, I think the suns wouldn't have won any of the series they did if their opponents were healthy. Cp3 was an important if overstated cog in a deep team. There were a number of times where you could genuinely put him as the third most important player after ayton and book, which imo pushes him down. I think a big part of why they lost to the bucks was actually not playing Cameron Payne enough to just change the pace they played at, because Milwaukee was just too good a defensive team to allow for that slow paced play. They abused his methodical approach and forced him into a number of uncharacteristic turnovers."
"Ok so here's my breakdown: 1A) Lebron, KD, Curry, Kawhi, Giannis. Their job is to carry teams, even if they're shitty.  1B) Dame, AD, Kyrie, Harden, Embiid, Luka, Tatum, CP3 1C) Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, Brad Beal, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young"
"It isn't about not liking Ben or thinking Jalen will be straight up better.  First round picks have a huge value, especially when your team is as bad as the Wolves have been historically.  The Jimmy Butler trade was mortgaging the future for win now, and that was a pick swap with Jimmy for Zach. This would be losing 1 solid young player and several first rounders.   If Simmons doesn't work out we are completely fucked. That is where my head is at."
"Well, all the guys who are currently up there, plus Bradley beal, Jimmy butler (I know he was bad in these last playoffs), and Paul George. Booker probably ranks about 20 for me."
Jimmy Butler
"The joke is that his name is like the guy from the office, but yes this is our local guy. He DID break the Jimmy Butler contract this summer somehow and he could reasonably be plugged in with Shams (an inordinate amount of Shams tweets are ""reporting with Jon""). Him being MN makes you question if he's a Gerss mouthpiece, but dude has a lot of years under his belt of not just spreading the first rumor that he hears or reporting as an access monger"
What that gotta do with jimmy butler getting all nba averaging 20/6/6 while missing 20 games
"This is the correct answer. I've watched Derozen play and it is no where near MJ.   Kawhi maybe but not the quickness and even the patented turnaround of MJ is no where close, 40-50%. Jimmy Butler is also one but it is like around 40-50% like how MJ plays.  But none of the current players plays like for like MJ. Kobe really is the one that plays like MJ."
Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler
"Replying ""Bryn Forbes almost had the same game score as jimmy butler"" to a comment about Dame possibly playing worse than Butler definitely implies that you disagree with the comment you're replying to."
"Lillard 2018 game score: 9.8  Forbes 2021 game score: 10.1  Butler 2021 game score: 10.9  So you're suggesting that Lillard was better than Butler because Forbes ""almost had the same game score as jimmy butler"" while also ignoring that Forbes had a higher game score than Lillard. Ur obsessed."
Bryn Forbes almost had the same game score as jimmy butler.
"Jimmy Butler at the height of trying to get out of Minnesota sat out several games with ‚ÄúGeneral Soreness‚Äù. And ,Tho he DID show up to training camp, he was also a bit of an asshole and did more damage to to an already hurting team.   That said, Ben doesn‚Äôt strike me as the type to ‚Äúget the third-stringers‚Äù"
&gt; shot below 37.5% every game  &gt; let Arnie Risen and George Mikan outplay him every game  the jimmy butler of years past
"&gt;Cousins was below league average in percentages  Uhhh in what percentages? [You can literally see this on a players bball ref page under ""adjusted shooting"". ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/couside01.html#all_adj_shooting). Between 2011-2017 (his 2nd season and his last season pre-injury) his FG% was at or above league average every season but one‚Ä¶ 45.2% vs 45.7%.   &gt; And if cousins was good enough, he would‚Äôve transitioned into the next generation of good 3 point scorers from 2015-2018.  Yeah dude, maybe he would've if he didn't have his career completely derailed by brutal injuries in the middle of his prime.. in 2016 he was tied with Brooke Lopez for most 3PM/game among centers.. shooting the same percentage as Towns. He tore his achilles 48 games into the next season.    I don't know what you're trying to say with your first paragraph.. I called them both elite **offensive** players.. they are clearly both in that same tier of all star or sometimes even all-nba level player who is not good enough to lead their team to the playoffs without a very solid roster around them.. hence why KAT has only ever made the playoffs once when Jimmy Butler dragged them there. I'm not even a Boogie stan lol, but idk how you think KAT is somehow much better than him.. over the past 2 seasons the Wolves have less wins than everyone except the Cavs and Pistons."
"Lavine was a late lottery pick, he didn't really develop until he was traded to the Bulls in the Jimmy Butler trade. Good selection by the T-Wolves but they completely failed at unlocking his potential. I was mostly kidding with KG and KAT I agree the Wolves are bad at drafting lol. I even forgot to mention Kevin Love, god these guys have had a lot of #1 picks."
"Nah Jimmy Butler balling with the 3rd stringers and screaming you fucking need me 100% happened. if anything KAT saying ""ask Rachel"" at the Wolves-Heat game confirmed it"
lol cool. there's always some reason for the wolves missing the playoffs. The team has made it once in the past 17 years and that was only because Jimmy Butler dragged them kicking and screaming.
"Yeah I stated it was his rookie year. The point was if Cousins was drafted that year, right when the league was really changing, he probably would have taken more than 69(nice) 3‚Äôs over his first 5 seasons and [a lot less deep mid range shots. ](https://imgur.com/a/0qDJ1Kl) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge leap to think that this difference leading up to/during his prime could‚Äôve made his numbers more efficient- which is your only argument against the comparison.   &gt; Again, please tell me how towns fluffed or faked these numbers  Never said this, literally said they‚Äôre both elite offensive centers in my comparison. But Congrats to towns on finding more efficient ways to suck ass I guess? He got carried to one 1st round playoff exit by Jimmy Butler, who promptly was ready to burn Target Center to the ground just not to play with his [soft ](https://imgur.com/a/B9scuhz) ass. Thibs has never missed the playoffs except his 2 butler-less seasons coaching those KATs.. and then he promptly won COTY his next season coaching."
We've had people come out and say the whole Jimmy Butler cooking the starters with the waterboys was pumped up and thats a shame to me.
Goes to show r/nba exaggerates and bandwagons topics that aren‚Äôt actually true. Just like the fake Jimmy Butler vs Timberwolves ‚Äúfight‚Äù
Jimmy butler/embiid
"I think people are way underestimating how bad 16 seeds are. For me to call it a ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù I think you need roughly a 90% chance to win each game. Assuming the first game against the 1 seed is the toughest, you‚Äôd need a 95% chance to win that game, than a 98% chance to win each of the other 3 to have roughly a 90% chance of winning all 4 in a row. Based on kenpom predictions, you need to be about a 15-20 point favorite to be 95% to win a game, and most 16 seeds are roughly 20-25 point dogs against 1 seeds. So you‚Äôre looking at needing to flip a kenpom prediction by a whopping 40 points to be comfortable enough to call it a guarantee vs a mere favorite.   Throw on top of this college rules with only 5 fouls, and much more lenient whistles towards defenses on charges, and I think that limits you to at least perimeter players, and outside of the top few, they‚Äôd probably need to be a shooter as well to stop teams from loading up in a zone a taking charges (they probably wouldn‚Äôt get a ton of calls this way, but it only takes a couple to get a guy in serious foul trouble)  At the end of the day for 90% to be a ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù, you‚Äôd be setting a money line of something about -1000 for this team to reach the final four, which is insanely low odds. I‚Äôm gonna say you probably need an all nba level player for that, and you can probably remove some of the centers who would be too likely to get in foul trouble to be a true guarantee, so I‚Äôm gonna say there‚Äôs 10-15 and the ‚Äúworst‚Äù would be someone off the all nba third team, so like a Kyrie or Jimmy Butler type. Those guys are good enough with the ball in their hands that no college players will stop them and they wouldn‚Äôt be as prone to fouling out.  Now if you slightly tweaked the question to ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù to make the final four instead of ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù, I think that list can be expanded out to somewhere in the 50-100 range."
 They tried trading 4 FRP and EG for Jimmy Butler after that 2018 season and they said no. Chris Paul had the worst season of his career in 2019 after getting injured on the biggest stage. We gambled with russ because there was no other contracts that matched and that didn‚Äôt work either. Tillman also refuses to spend money in 2019 and that‚Äôs what pushed harden out
Jimmy Butler is MJ's son. Google it. Resemblance is striking and several other things
"you‚Äôre taking 45 games in a bubble year  plus Murray is 2 years older. he was at 18.6 on 45/34/88 at Sexton‚Äôs age when he was being set-up by the best passer in the NBA    and 3ppg is a big difference. like i said, Brandon Ingram didn‚Äôt do that. Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, and Khris Middleton didn‚Äôt do that    Murray had a true outlier year in terms of shooting last year. 45 games of shooting hot is not enough to refute 4 years of league average shooting. last year was the first time Sexton was below league average   and he should have more assists than SextonüòÇ he‚Äôs passing to Jeremy Grant, Michael Porter Jr, and the MVP  Sexton is passing to Andre Drummond, Jarrett Allen, Darius Garland, and Larry Nance.   and you‚Äôre talking about peak, but Murray is 2 years older. watch that Nets game from this year for players at their peak. Sexton‚Äôs entire career is coming up big in big time moments"
What's the Jimmy Butler theory?
Jimmy Butler and the 3rd stringers better than the t-wolves.
"show me all the times Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant made the playoffs without another All-Star  KAT made the playoffs with Jimmy when KAT was 22.    are you docking him because he couldn‚Äôt get past the 66 win Rockets with Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Andrew Wiggins, and pissed off Jimmy Butler?"
"if you gave KAT a michael finley, steve nash, josh howard, jason kidd, or jason terry, i bet he would.    he went to the playoffs with Jimmy Butler and nobody else who shot from 23 feet   KAT is easily the best shooting big since Dirk and really i think it‚Äôs just Durant and Curry ahead of him today. a 7 footer who can come off curls and flare is just silly to conceive. KAT has 8 3PA‚Äôs on 40%+ ability   he is the best scoring big since Shaq imo"
"no team with a legitimately very good player is ever going 1-81. Teams led by Gerald Henderson and Ish Smith won 7 and 10 games respectively.   Surround someone like Jimmy Butler with the 437-450th worst players in the league, and there's still a chance he teams up with the third stringers and destroys everyone a couple times. You need to have no players that can take over a game for this to be possible."
"I told someone the Jimmy Butler theory this summer at a beach wknd and they literally spit their beer out all over me. I was quite shocked when it happened, but apparently they were too"
Shouldn‚Äôt have beefed with Jimmy Butler
"There's two lists here because OP is ambiguous. First is a set of people who have never made an all-star team, next is a list of players who weren't all-stars last year.  &amp;nbsp;  **Never Been All-Stars:**  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **G:** Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  **F:** OG Anunoby  **F:** Tobias Harris  **C:** Deandre Ayton  **Honourable mentions:** Jamal Murray, Ja Morant, Jerami Grant, Clint Capela   &amp;nbsp;  **Best Non-2021 All-Stars**  **G:** Trae Young  **G:** De'Aaron Fox  **F:** Khris Middleton  **F:** Jimmy Butler  **C:** Karl-Anthony Towns  **Honourable Mentions:** Demar DeRozan, Brandon Ingram, Klay Thompson, and everyone mentioned in the list above."
Jimmy Butler  Bam Adebayo  Duncan Robinson  Max Strus  Omer Yurtseven  Gabe Vincent
"He wasn't. Let's be real here.   There's a reason why we had to rush Jimmy back.   We went from #2 to barely in the playoffs with butler out of the picture and just KAT and Wigs. Jimmy had to rush back to that Denver game.   KAT could've sealed the playoffs before that game several times, but he never could carry the team."
"Jimmy Butler just says the word ""Soft"" when describing KAT."
"Most championship teams are basically super teams with multiple All-NBA guys or HOF guys. It‚Äôs a relatively new term, but is media derived. The Clippers were a super team when the Nugs knocked them out, the Dubs with and without KD, the Lakers with Shaq and Kobe, the Celtics with the Big 3 + Rondo and Tony Allen, the Spurs, the Bulls and the Lakers and Celtics of old are all super teams with crazy talent.   For the most part, the third best guy on a lot of those teams could put up 25 ppg on bad teams. It‚Äôs not an insult.   I just don‚Äôt think KAT is this golden goose everyone says he is. He‚Äôs a pretty meh defender. Jimmy Butler said it. Wiggins has intimated it. KAT has all the skill and ability in the world. Their team this year has definite playoff talent.   If everyone here is right about Towns being so great, they‚Äôll make the playoffs pretty easily. It‚Äôs not hard to limp in when you have as much talent as they generally do. The Grizzlies somehow are in the fight each year with Valenciunas as their second best guy and most people here would take DLO/KAT over Morant/Valenciunas. Grants Jonas isn‚Äôt there anymore, but you get me."
"Which would you prefer: stats, advanced stats, eye test + testimonials from the time or Jimmy Butler himself stating that KAT was better?"
"The problem is that you're looking at some of these acquisitions in isolation. I understand why he made some of the moves, but sometimes it's just better running things back even if guys are getting old/washed.   &gt;Schroder is basically swapped for Green and Rondo which ultimately didnt work out well but I think is still understandable seeing how Rondo and Green were washed last season.  They are washed in certain situations, but their collective value in their roles is where they shine. That's what made that team so effective. Rondo's value in always keeping AD involved is more valuable than Schroder's terrible playmaking, where he ignores AD mismatches and makes bad decisions.  Green is a comparable defender, but he's smarter than Schroder and can space the floor despite his inconsistent shooting. Pelinka didn't even address their biggest weakness. The weakness that had Jimmy Butler looking like prime Jordan for 2 games and led to their biggest loss of the season."
"Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, CJ McCollum type of piece."
Pretty low bar when Jimmy Butler is your best shooter
&gt;Jimmy Butler called him lazy. Then KAT whined. That‚Äôs all you need to know about his personality. He has accomplished nothing without Jimmy.  Yeah the man who worked hard all his life to be picked #1 and continued to work hard every year to get better is lazy... You honestly know nothing about his personality and are a bitter man who has a grudge against KAT for no good reason lmao.
Jimmy Butler called him lazy. Then KAT whined. That‚Äôs all you need to know about his personality. He has accomplished nothing without Jimmy.
"&gt;But seasons before and after Jimmy Butler don't bode well for KAT either in terms of playoff basketball. The wolves were 11th seed winning 31 games immediately after Jimmy leaves and that roster wasn't that much better than the current Nuggets roster, it's just that Jokic is a far bigger difference maker than KAT and he makes those around him better.   The Wolves missed the playoffs that year because Covington missed 40 games and Rose got injured in the last 15 but do you know the difference between the 18/19 and 19/20 Wolves? KAT was healthy."
"It's not just Doc or the Sixers or Embiid.  If Jimmy Butler had a falling out after the series and forced a trade there would be contenders lined up and Miami would get an all star level player and/or a shit ton of picks.  There's not a single contender in the Simmons sweepstakes and no all star level player on the table. The league offices know Ben isn't on Jimmy's level, even though people are trying to sell it like he is.  Ben could be, but he hasn't put in the work yet. And him not putting in the work is exactly why his trade value is in the toilet. Not Doc. Not the Sixers. Not ""the pass"" ... His demonstrated lack of effort to develop and improve obvious glaring deficiencies in his game to a championship level is what's destroyed his trade value.  TL;DR  The difference between Ben &amp; Jimmy is everyone knows Jimmy puts in the work. Everyone knows Ben doesn't (unless he's done something totally out of character this summer)"
Is anyone here not paying $20 a cup if fucking Jimmy Butler is the barista!?
"The comparison isn‚Äôt similar imo  Jimmy Butler balled out in the finals the year before and deserves the benefit of the doubt  The biggest criticism with Simmons was that his lack of shooting would be exposed as the Sixers go deeper in the playoffs   While that doesn‚Äôt make him a worthless player per se, he struggled every time he makes it to the second round and that lowers his ceiling as a player"
"Yeah, I've seen a ton of players shit the bed in playoff series before, Simmons is the first that I've seen people try to pretend all of a sudden became a radically different caliber of player after the series.   Jimmy Butler just put up 14ppg on 39% TS in a series where the Heat got swept and somehow people don't treat him like he spontaneously became some worthless player."
"Recently Jimmy Butler, the pic of him hunched over in the finals with a crazy stat line comes to mind"
I mean there clearly was some beef between them if Wiggins's brother wrote Hallelujah when Jimmy was being traded and later on Wiggins basically calling him an old ass hater.    https://theundefeated.com/whhw/twitter-exchange-between-timberwolves-andrew-wiggins-jimmy-butler-and-stephen-jackson-had-nba-twitter-on-its-heels/
that is not what jimmy butler said before the playoffs
Draymond Green will be traded  Doc Rivers will get fired  Jimmy Butler will fight with Spoelstra and staff during midseason but we will learn it after they get eliminated in the first round.
"If it‚Äôs one thing I know in life, it‚Äôs that you should always listen to Jimmy Butler."
"Trae Young  If he's able to come out this season, ice the entire league and lead the Hawks to their first ring in Atlanta? With how much the city already loves him, and FMVP beating out the rest of his stacked draft class to a first ring?  Schlenk would go from being a great GM to the clear best GM in the league - the Hawks would be representing a huge possibility of a dynasty era with how young and locked in this core is while still having considerable assets.  Jimmy Butler with a ring/FMVP I think also dramatically changes the way history views him and his journey in the league."
"They dont even have a big 1 let alone a big 4. I think they‚Äôre going to struggle in the playoffs without a defacto #1 option on offense, Lowry and Bam are solid with their production but you don‚Äôt know if jimmy will show up. Jimmy Butler may be the team leader but he certainly cannot lead a team with his play on the court if he does a repeat of last years playoffs."
"People are really stretching these days for big 3's.  Does old man Kyle Lowry count in a big 3 cuz he made all nba 3rd team one time 5 years ago?  I really like Bam, but has he done enough to be a ""big 3"" guy?   If Jimmy butler is the 3rd guy in you big 3 you've got an amazing team. If he's the best guy in your big 3 tho?"
Giannis ain‚Äôt fucking with that Jimmy Butler coffee business
Jimmy Butler
"Wasn't Bam drafted 2017 pick 14th? I could be wrong though. Jimmy butler is getting older and so is Kyle Lowry. Pat Riley don't make mistakes so there's something he saw in herro. You see what harden,lebron,KD,kyrie and others are doing during the summer? They are playing pro am basketball against each other getting better even though they are superstar s."
How does jimmy butler play worse and still ahead of beal who was like .2 points away from scoring title???? Same for dame tbh.
"Tim Duncan and Bill Russell were the greatest leaders in basketball history imo, maybe with magic up there. Guys like Michael won despite being incredibly toxic as leaders. Shit we have seen more modern examples like jimmy butler be...volatile at best. True leadership is consistency and respect, if you feel the need to either resort to violence or lash at against the people who rely on you, you aren‚Äôt a good leader."
No way in hell are the nuggets who got to the WCF two years ago and the WCSF last year going to lose to the Timberwolves who haven't been to the playoffs since Jimmy butler was forced out for encouraging a winning culture
"Lol keep trying to convince yourself Jordan could make the passes lebron can. The star power in the league today is so much stronger than the players during Jordan‚Äôs time. Although the 90s did have all time great big men, there weren‚Äôt great forwards or guards. You couldn‚Äôt name 20 people better than these players: Kawhi, KD, Harden, Kobe, Steph, Westbrook, Paul George, Tatum, kyrie, Luka, dame, cp3, trae, melo, jimmy butler, Klay, Giannis, Zion, booker, mitchell.  Players in the 90s could not score the way these players can, and didn‚Äôt have the size/strength combo of someone like Giannis, Kd, or kawhi. Jordan‚Äôs competition was trash. Absolute trash. He‚Äôd dominate any era but lebrons accomplishments are more impressive due to his competition"
"All time: Dwyane Wade  Active: Jimmy Butler  Non Heat: LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo  Retired non Heat: Dirk Nowitzki  Began following NBA in 2003, and I‚Äôm from Miami"
"Yea ok, it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúsmiling‚Äù not the ‚Äúdribbling in his room with her‚Äù   https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/15/nba-jimmy-butler-hotel-security-complaint-dribbling-workout/"
"I can just imagine Jimmy Butler seeing this on the news. He just stares blankly for a few minutes and then says nah, imma go back to banging Rachel."
"Exactly. The Sixers coaching and management set the expectation with Ben by not benching him when he didn't shoot, not having him develop a mid-post or a finishing game, and choosing to give him a max contract over Jimmy Butler after a year of no growth but are now mad/shocked that it's blowing up in their faces. Incredible. They should have given him the MCW treatment in 2019. Ben should take the initiative to improve himself but if the team doesn't set the bar, it's no wonder he can't reach it."
Jimmy Butler cause it was awesome watching him grow from a benchwarmer to the star of our team  dudes a workhorse that does all the little things on the court that translates to winning
Jimmy Butler top 15 is ridiculous
"As someone who has seen the Sixers play with Butler and the Sixers play without him, I have a hard time saying he is overrated.  I'll always wonder what the alternate reality looks like where the Sixers pick Jimmy over Brett Brown and head into the next year with a new coach."
"Love it. So tired of watching players flop to the free throw line game in, game out. Including Jimmy Butler. Maybe he'll be forced to develop a shot finally instead of averaging 30FT a game."
Jimmy Butler above AD? Lol
I‚Äôm over the Jimmy Butler top 15 hype after last year but besides him and Kawhi I can dig this for the most part.
anyone else think jimmy butler is overrated?
Jimmy Butler‚Äôs road to the NBA is a big one.  Caron Butler was in prison as a youth.
"How is it that ESPN's lists are always so uniquely stupid? Like last year's was even worse, but for this year let's just point out like some of the most obvious things:     * Jokic at #5. Undisputed MVP last year, and only going to get better. I guess he's ok, right? * LeBron at #3. Why not just put him as #1 again you brainless shills. * Jimmy Butler at #11 above fukkin Dame, PG, and Bradley Beal????"
I feel like jimmy butler might be too highly ranked.
"Neither is Jimmy Butler. I‚Äôd take donavan mitchell, trae young, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, over both of them"
Jimmy Butler continuously the most overrated player in the league
this compromise is kinda bad imo cuz it implies Kawhi won't be top 5 when he plays. Don't include him and if you do rank from what we know he's capable of. Like Some people had jimmy Butler/ Luka over KD and Curry at n\*8 before the star of last season.
1. Donovan Mitchell (1.3) - #27 in turnovers (2.8)  2. Jrue Holiday (1.3) ‚Äî #50 in turnovers (2.2)  3. Khyri Thomas (1.2) ‚Äî ? in turnovers (1.2) ‚Äî only played 5 games  4. Jimmy Butler (1.2) ‚Äî #51 in turnovers (2.1)  5. Russell Westbrook (1.2) ‚Äî #1 in turnovers (4.8)  6. LaMelo Ball (1.2) ‚Äî #25 in turnovers (2.8)
"He could be discount Giannis, in the same vein that Jimmy Butler is discount LeBron"
"do not forget the wolves prevented sachin gupta from taking the gm job in houston, which is only proper if they intended to eventually promote him from within.  this is the eagles going with jalen hurts over carson wentz.  rosas (wentz) may be good but flawed in the leadership category.  whereas hurts (sanchin gupta) is highly regarded in the locker room and has talent that is respected by many front office executives around the league.  also consider, four years ago, the timberwolves ownership stepped in to trade jimmy butler away when their general manager was not making headway.  it was said mulltiple times this offseason, the minnesota timberwolves were going to improve at the powerforward position via trade, and they got nobody.  had they gotten larry nance, they would'nt be in a standoff with philadelphia over ben simmons.  may we also recall that not only did anthony edwards fall into minnesota's lap, because they surprisingly got the #1 pick, but also that edwards was not considered a great fit in minnesota because they already had d'angelo russell and malik beasley scoring off the dribble.  meanwhile, the fact that the wolves already have in d'angelo russell what the sixers wanted from markelle fultz in terms of a 4th qtr closer makes them the very best fit for ben simmons in the league.    the wolves desperately need what simmons does well (defense, rebounding, collapsing defenses in transition and facilitating), and they already have people who excel at what simmons does poorly (4th qtr shooting and scoring).   Simmons-Russell-Beasley-McDaniels-KarlAnthonyTowns"
"The main reason we are favorites/have an advantage is all of the big 3 as Kyrie meshes well.  I‚Äôm sorry but unless in a strange of events, Ben gets bought out and ends up here. I don‚Äôt want him. While Kyrie is weird and can be a distraction, Ben comes with own set of issues, seems distracted by the high life, doesn‚Äôt seem to want to improve his game despite that big contract for the team that drafted him and has an air of arrogance that would clash with KD/Harden at some point and Kd is already moody anyway. There would be doubles on KD all day as teams know not even an open layup would punish them as Ben doesn‚Äôt even want to score, not to mention he‚Äôs ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù a locker room headache himself, if we are to believe those stories about the time Jimmy Butler was in Philly   And Kyrie is the reason the Nets have any relevance anyway. He‚Äôs the one that brought Kd here not to mention being a childhood Nets fan."
Thibs raises the Knicks from the dead.  Jimmy Butler wills the Heat to the finals.  Somehow...Both couldn't accomplish this with the Wolves.
Jimmy butler is the only player in the nba that cares about winning.
Don't forget fumbled the bag on paying Jimmy Butler and then losing him for absolutely nothing
"i never really used to follow the Wolves closely until Jimmy Butler took the third stringers and wopped the starters (according to reports)  ever since then, the Wolves are an immaculate confusion"
It all started with Jimmy Butler and Rachel Nichols lol
Second place is when someone *else* eliminate jimmy butler from the playoffs while they watched from the couch.
"&gt; It's a popular opinion now but nobody questioned it at the time.  Eh, I think a lot of people questioned it. I'm not talking about Simmons over Butler. But Tobias Harris and Brett Brown over Jimmy was considered a questionable move after their run that ended on an insane shot. I know it ended up being Simmons over Butler eventually, but giving Harris a 5 year max, and not offering the same to Butler feels like it's choosing one over the other. At least from my uneducated perspective.  They could have easily run it back with that team too. I thought Philly would absolutely dominate the east if they kept them all, even with Simmons, especially after Kawhi left. But time makes fools of us all."
"I think Simmons would be fine next to an elite perimeter scorer like Lillard/KD/etc. He's never played with someone like that. The closest was Jimmy Butler and that worked decently well.   The Nets happen to have 2 players like that, so even better."
"No, he wouldn‚Äôt.  I agree he‚Äôd be better at power forward, or even more realistically center, but he won‚Äôt play that position.  They shipped Jimmy Butler out of Philly because Ben complained about not having the ball in his hands."
"I agree with you, but he‚Äôs not likely to.  They literally shipped off Jimmy Butler because Ben complained about not having the ball in his hands."
"They like Elton brand because of tremendous handling of Jimmy Butler and the massive over pay off a trade and a contract for Tobias Harris. The moves that year to go into win now way too soon we pretty great, they took a Philly team looking to compete for years and hamstrung them."
Butler and Simmons don‚Äôt mesh at all‚Ä¶Simmons doesn‚Äôt have the skillset to complement jimmy offensively
Shaq? Jimmy Butler?
Exactly. The only time that I have thought we were turning it around was with Jimmy Butler. This iteration is just like all the others.
"wiggins was the worst contract in the nba when that trade was made, at best maybe the third worst. we all knew what wolves wiggins was, everyone slagged him off bc of jimmy butler too. then he gets traded and improves and everyone suddenly thinks he wouldve been just as good if he stayed in minny. he wouldn‚Äôt. it was a good trade if for nothing else than making KAT unlikely to demand a trade since he‚Äôs now playing with his best friend and not an acquaintance.   ant &gt;&gt;&gt; lamelo when you have dlo on your team. they needed wings, ant is a wing and possibly the most athletic one in the league with superstar upside. sure, defence would‚Äôve been nice, but lamelo is no better than ant.  perfectly fine pick.   wolves traded up to 6 to pick garland, not culver. then cavs took garland, so wolves had to take best player available. at the time, the consensus was culver, and he was supposed to be a defensive wing which on paper was a great fit. he was a bust though.   trading culver for beverly was a fleecing of the grizzlies; i honestly can‚Äôt understand how you think that was a bad trade for minnesota. it was a great one"
I love Jimmy Butler. That's all.
"Jimmy Butler got rid of Jimmy Butler, let's be clear"
Rosas isn‚Äôt an idiot. I think the opposite is true. I think that Taylor wants Simmons. The feeling get from this team is always LETS FULL SEND and swing for the fences. Except someone forgot that we have a runner on second.   Then we are back to having a team that mis effectively no different than the one we had before getting Jimmy Butler. White Wiggins and KAT. Yay.
That approach got them d'angelo russell and got rid of Jimmy butler.
This team will seriously not have anymore playoffs success then Jimmy Butler. That ineptitude takes talent.
That is so Timberwolves. This team is cursed to have less playoffs success in its entire history then Jimmy Butler.
"Jimmy Butler is a dude you want on your team regardless of how good or bad your team is because of how bad the dude wants to win and the fact that'll he'll do anything to win.   Team full of superstars? Man doesn't care. Will step it up when they're having an off night or will get down and dirty and be the gritty guy or defensive stud your team needs.  Team full of bums? Man will do literally everything he possibly can to win the game while also making those around him better. Not afraid to confront anyone regardless of who they are, scrub or super star. And he can do that because he's the hardest working dude on the floor 100% of the time."
"Fascinating clip. If you watch until the end, you‚Äôll notice that Jimmy Butler is open and near the opponent‚Äôs basket with the ball. Instead of passing, he puts the ball into the basket. 2019 76ers were something else."
"&gt;you should dislike your soft stars your trash ass team and the worst management in the league lmao    You are right about everything except insinuating KAT is soft. The man lost his mom and a lot of his family member before last season. He was feeling extremely depressed heading into the season and hurt his wrist 3 games in and had to play with a jacked up wrist the rest of the way and still showed up night after night and had a pretty good season. Just because he isn‚Äôt a Jimmy Butler, Jordan and Kobe kind of killer attitude doesn‚Äôt make the man soft."
I think he means like the Jimmy Butler situation a few years ago. The Bulls FO wanted thibs to not play Jimmy so much who was a role player at the time on his contract year to be able to sign him to a cheaper contract
I don't really follow Philly---Did Butler not want to resign with them or did the 76ers simply choose Tobias over Jimmy??
Yayayay another fake tough fan calling fans softnover this c*****t Jimmy annoying white Karen Butker. Butker fangirls continue to make a laugh at how obnoxious of their support for this guy who is a legit asshole.  I don‚Äôt care if he is better than KAT or whoever shit human being and it‚Äôs not worth my time praising him like a role model or player. It‚Äôs sad fake aloha Butler is some hero to these pathetic fans tbh. KAT will always be a better human and MAN than Butler but what can fans do when Butker cult can control the narrative with arrogance.
Their front office made such a mess of things starting from the fultz draft. Most of this board could have done a better job. I remember thinking Tatum was the easy choice for them and they blew it. The bridges trade was also legendary level bad considering his mom worked for the team too. Trading for Harris was also just a dumb as letting jimmy walk. Butler embiid was terrifying and they could have built a great team around that.   It was obvious from that raptors series what they needed to do. Simmons was only threatening on defense and Harris was totally irrelevant to the outcome.
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs single digit percentage at all. You won‚Äôt always get the same caliber of a player but I‚Äôm pretty sure I can name one or two star players that were available on the market for the last 5. Last year, Harden and Vucevic became available. The year before D‚Äôangelo Russell became available. The year before that Kawhi Leonard, Kristaps Porzingis, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris became available. Year before that it was an all-star level Blake Griffin. You see where I‚Äôm going with this? Literally every player I just named when added to this roster would keep them contending at a high level if they received them at the level they played at the time to today (other than maybe Vucevic since he plays the same position as Embiid). These happen far more often than you think and in recent times, rather than being a single digit percent chance of happening on a season by season basis, over the last 5 years it has happened 100% of the time."
"Butler fanboys are so insufferable. This guy can‚Äôt do no wrong. If he told a player to Jill himself because he didn‚Äôt meet his ridiculous ‚Äúcriteria‚Äù these people would defend the fuck out of him.  I just don‚Äôt like him being praised and a role model. Fake role model and especially fake tough guy. Wish a real tough guy would show him how to to face real tense situation but of course these players let him talk like an arrogant smug. This guy is responsible for ruining players reputations and are deemed ‚Äúsoft‚Äù because of FA broached stories as well.  BYW this isn‚Äôt about the diva Simmons, it‚Äôs about KAT who will always be 100000000 times better person than Jimmy  annoying white Karen Butler. Get copypasta jokes coming. At least if I‚Äôm going to talk crap I‚Äôm going to let it all out."
"Lashing out? I formulated my views clearly and rationally about why I don't like Jimmy Butler and some dude went and said ""I want you personally know you are trash"" so of course I'm not gonna take any of you seriously lol."
"Probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I don‚Äôt love the current Heat lineup. Bunch of overperforming hardworking players but I don‚Äôt see anything easy for them.   But Jimmy Butler on those 76ers? Let‚Äôs say the 76ers had perfect clairvoyance and traded Simmons for CP3 (a diminished asset at that time) and a shooter or 2? Omg is that lineup not a 3 year juggernaut? They‚Äôd walk to 60 wins on talent alone."
"&gt; I assume it‚Äôs just training camp he‚Äôs missing, then he‚Äôll play half-ass till he gets traded like Harden did last year.  It's sorta how Jimmy Butler (General Soreness) got out of Minnesota...although Butler came in to a practice and took the scrub lineup to a scrimmage dunking over KAT and Wiggins to make a point.  I don't think young socialites are quite up to that level of performance."
"Are you okay man, wanna talk about whatever is going on in your real life that is bothering you?  Because surely you're not still this upset about Jimmy Butler."
Imagine anyone trying to talk shit about national treasure Jimmy Butler
"Stop it, two years ago Joel had one of the best starting 5‚Äôs in recent memory with JJ, Jimmy, and Tobias against the Raptors and still put up some awful games in that series. The Sixers were loaded till they let Jimmy Butler walk for nothing and signed Al Horford lol and they STILL should‚Äôve beaten the Hawks."
&amp;#x200B;  2016: Kevin Durant or Derozan/Lowry (surprised no one mentioned it)  2017: Kyrie Irving  2018: Jimmy Butler  2019: James Harden  2020: Paul George  2021: Ben Simmons
What do Wolves fans think of Jimmy Butler?  I know he gets called fake tough guy from your fanbase
The only one that did was Jimmy Butler...who got a similar package to what's being floated out there for Simmons.
I feel like it'd be way harder to make a 3 with Jimmy Butler on the court screaming for you to take the shot.
"The fun part of being a Heat fan is that there always seems to be hope for a win.  I do believe that you need at least 2 top 5 players to compete for a championship.   Miami imo has Butler and Bam  Jimmy to me is a top 5 SF in the league right now - He is great at getting to the free-throw line and then hitting those FT's. Also I mean he is one of the best in game stealers. Just love the hustle.   Bam is a top 5 center -- I think he is 5 behind - Jokic, Embiid KAT, and Rudy. Double double machine and so athletic.    Now clearly there are better duo's out there.   Lebron and Davis Durant, Kyrie and Harden (This is not even fair) Giannis and Rodney Hood etc  And ofcourse two borderline top 5's are not going to get the job done against more talented teams. But there is no doubt they will make it really interesting.   Further, we got a nice deep team - some young talent to be excited about. An injured player who might come and play at a high level. So a lot of upsides.  Do we have a realistic chance -- probably not, but damn you don't want to sleep on this team. They might surprise someone."
"Ironically the jimmy butler situation is the closest parallel to this besides the obvious implications of trying to contend rn. But Simmons is setting up a situation where you either take an L by holding him or get what you can get, which may end up being a perceived robbery."
"James Harden and Jimmy Butler couldnt net you a star, what makes you think Ben is?"
Wolves traded a pissed off star in Jimmy Butler to 76ers  76ers now has a chance to complete a full circle By trading a pissed off Ben Simmons to the Wolves  The trade packet Philly sent for Butler include no picks at all.. I wonder if Wolves think of that deal back then and try to send out a players only package for Simmons in the same manner
Why do people think circumstances don‚Äôt factor into results and if you replay the season 100 times you would get the same result 100 times. Did people really think jimmy butler was the difference between not even making the playoffs and coming within 2 games of being nba champions? Was Chris Paul the difference for the suns? These teams didn‚Äôt even make the playoffs. The heat got lambasted by covid last season and still managed to get the 6th seed with damn near no rest and had a terrible 4 games. I guess no improvement matters because they got swept in the previous season with different circumstances. Such a dumb way to look at things
And the canoe Jimmy Butler used in that interview.
"So how much is Draymond worth if ""Draymond lite"" is on a full max salary, and to trade for him would require an all star and 4 1st?  Either Draymond is seriously underpaid since his ""lite"" counterpart is at $40m+ / year guaranteed for 4 more years or Ben is seriously overvalued (and paid) and everyone in the league knows it and that's why they're not falling all over each other in a bidding war since he's been very obviously on the market for quite a while.  The Lakers full-passed on Ben (25, entering his prime, locked into a 4 year contract) without even a rumor of interest afaik and traded for a 32 year old Russ on a $40m / year (essentially the same amount) contract. [Aside: They may have needed to get another team or two involved, but if Ben is the answer you do everything you can to find a way to get Ben.]  Why not even an effort? (Seriously) Ben is a younger better perimeter defender who averages almost as many assists as Russ and they both have struggles shooting from the outside, so why didn't a team in ""win now mode"" jump all over the statistically similar, younger, longer term/window Ben?  They would have Ben and AD for years together if they got Ben but they went with someone who was ""statistically similar"", older, shorter window of opportunity instead and not even a passing try at Ben.  Is it more likely because Ben is so epic and such a great building block they just couldn't handle how great he would make them or because they know what I'm saying and Ben isn't the answer because he doesn't even fit on a team that was built specifically around him?  I think people who really know and understand basketball know Ben and Russ are statistically very similar but the ""fit"" on a team is entirely different, because statistics are a reflection of the game not a dictation of it.  TL;DR  Ben is overvalued. He's not worth shit in a trade because even though he's statistically solid he doesn't even fit on a team that was specifically built with him in mind, to the point they traded Jimmy F'ing Butler to keep him happy."
"Is Philly going to bar him from showing up? While Simmons is still on the team he can show up if he wants to. Sitting out is just one way to get Philly to trade him, and IMO it's his worst way. The best way would be to show up and be a problem, like Jimmy Butler was in Minnesota or Vince Carter was in Toronto."
"I mean they messed up an incredible situation though. If they didn't trade for Fultz they have Embiid/Tatum/Simmons. If they didn't acquire Tobias they could have had SGA.  They threw a bunch of money at Al Horford. They traded assets for a half year rental of Jimmy Butler. Honestly, i would say the process fucking worked. They made all of these horendous decisions and still got close to beating the Raptors and are a dark horse contender."
Better than the Jimmy Butler/Timberwolves drama?
2016 Kevin Durant  2017 Kyrie Irving   2018 Jimmy Butler  2019 Anthony Davis / Kyrie (again)  2020 Paul George  2021 Ben Simmons
"Or he could pull a Jimmy Butler and be so toxic in the locker room that they have no choice but to trade him.  I would have paid money to see the practice where he carried the 2nd team to beat the 1st team and called Kat and Wiggins soft or whatever.  I'm a Wolves fan.  Even for them, that was the height of dysfunction."
"uh, this has been going on for years lol lets not act like its all Simmons' and Pauls fault   Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Harden all happened in the last few years"
"Simmons is in such a bad state he could end it all and everyone in here talking about how it‚Äôs hilarious that he‚Äôs so soft is going to be saying ‚ÄúWow I wish we‚Äôd been able to see the warning signs‚Ä¶‚Äù  Seriously,  how do people think it‚Äôs okay to just berate people like this and dehumanize them? He‚Äôs a sensitive, emotional man who probably is too emotional to play a professional sport. So your best idea is to make him feel like a pussy and treat him like garbage?  No one else I‚Äôve ever seen in professional sports gets this much hate for being non-aggressive or even bad in general (which Simmons fucking isn‚Äôt). It‚Äôs honestly really depressing to watch and be a part of.   When Jimmy Butler was calling his teammates out for not putting in any effort y‚Äôall meme‚Äôd and clowned Butler, not KAT and Wiggins.  I don‚Äôt respect the effort Simmons puts into his offensive game at all but goddamn do I respect you people a lot less."
"&gt;Once y'all got eliminated fans screamed on top of every rooftops to never see Ben play another minute with the 76ers  Would you not do the same if a guy you're paying $180m has to be taken out in the 4th because he's too much of an offensive liability and is afraid to dunk on Trae Young?  &gt;There is 0 shit talk it is what it is.  You and I have very different definitions of shit talk lmao  &gt;Difference is his teammate came out and supported him instantly while the popular thing to do was to shit on him.   Difference is PG wants to be better, Ben just wants to be rich and famous.  &gt;Im not talking during the bubble but AFTER when he already shat the bed. Your team didn't do that  Our team did it after every bad performance for 4 years. They did it every time Ben refused to improve his game. They did it when he didn't deserve it. They did it when he wouldn't do the same for them.  Do you have this same energy towards Jimmy Butler and Minnesota? Do you have it towards Harden and Houston? KD and OKC? Kawhi and San Antonio? AD and NOLA? Kyrie and Boston? All these dudes quit on their teams and none of those cities had much, if any, love for them at the end of their tenure. I would someone from the Clippers but dudes seem to be ok being mediocre when they get to chill in LA lmao"
"Embid can't guard 1-5.  You need someone who can guard them and come off switches .  Who does embid have to guard at his position on a nightly basis in his conference. Clint capella just catches lobs, bam has no jumper, Celtics, wizards, nets no serious threat down low. Brook Lopez is outside the paint spacing for giannas.  Nerlen Noel's is a defensive player.   Verse simmons having to pick up. Trae young, westbrook, kyrie or James harden,  Jimmy butler, Tatum, . All with different skills sets ? A.d. was basically a glorified kevin love with the pelicans. Always hurt and your team can never win."
"&gt;What kind of team wants that Mentality?  &gt;Apparently the wolves are still in the mix  *somewhere in South Beach, Jimmy Butler nods*"
But the part that is truly killing me right now is that we never made a max offer to Jimmy Butler because his presence hurt Bens ego and we had to save the cap space to max Ben.
"Except the players can‚Äôt choose where they want.  Only sometimes does where the player want to go align with where the player actually goes.   Look at Kawhi going to Toronto or Jimmy Butler going to Philly.   The players on a contract go to where the team decides they go, it isn‚Äôt the players decision. The player can have influence over where the go, but if they are under contract (especially a brand new contract) they can‚Äôt expect to choose where they get traded too.  And how is that my preferred outcome?"
"2019 was the peak. Having both JJ, and Jimmy Butler on the team, was our best shot at a title."
"Since you wanna go there, that intermission between the regular season and playoffs heavily helped your Lakers team that year. Davis probably would've broken down by the end and your roster was filled with old guys that benefited from that rest. You guys couldnt even sweep a ""fluke"" Heat team that had 2 of its best 3 players out, trotting out lineups filled with rookies and Jimmy Butler. You really wanna call out flukes lmao."
"Lol if you are in the NBA and you don‚Äôt get up for a chance at a ring that‚Äôs on you. That has nothing to do with the bubble, that‚Äôs poor mentality. You‚Äôre telling me Kobe wouldn‚Äôt have cared? MJ? Bron seemed to care. Jimmy butler seemed to take it seriously. It‚Äôs as even as a playing field can get. No traveling, everyone was well rested, no home court advantaged. And idk if you watched or not but it was great basketball! If some players didn‚Äôt care, that‚Äôs just piss poor mentality! There‚Äôs no asterisk on that chip kiddo."
Embiid gets a ton of FTs but they are mostly deserved.  Same with Jimmy Butler.  Guys that spend a lot of time in the paint should have more FTs than guys who sit on the perimeter
Yep the Heat are like teflon on here. No one calls them out on their bullshit but Jimmy Butler is top 5 foul baiter and Lowry a top 5 flopper. Lowry almost as good as CP3 at flopping.
"I was 100% in on Udonis's ""come at me bro"" posture before I read this comment and was like, oh yeah, Jimmy Butler ran a coffee shop."
Kyle Lowry &amp; Jimmy Butler too.   Butler‚Äôs FT rate dipped from 70 (which is absurd) to 57 to now **39** and his TS is like 55.
"What does ""pack it up"" mean?  I think there's a tendency especially in the analytics side to think that teams are either rushing toward contention, rebuild, or mediocrity and sometimes fail to acknowledge incremental improvement is possible.  I think some of the teams on that list have gotten a little stale, like the Pacers, and could stand to shuffle the deck by dealing either Turner or Sabonis but that doesn't necessarily portend to an entire rebuild. But it should always be remembered that guys like Rudy Gobert, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, and John Collins were taken outside of the lottery, so its not like those teams couldn't just try to continuously gain talent.  And some of those teams are in smaller markets which may not have the stomach to willingly break up an alright team and start from the absolute beginning again"
But Sixers didn't have any power in the situation so you can't knock them for the trade.  I have no idea what you're talking about regarding the Sixers deciding to move on from Jimmy. It was widely reported to be the other way around.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843798-jimmy-butler-rumors-star-declined-190m-76ers-max-contract-before-heat-trade  They offered him the max and he declined. Where are you getting that the sixers didn't want to max him?
"10 years ago they had prime D Rose fam, and even after that the Jimmy Butler era was pre good too. Bulls havent even been bad for that long"
"honorable mention Jimmy Butler, but Rose 100%"
"Great defender, good slasher, good finisher, super strong, great athlete, solid handle, smart passer, and he is interesting as a a ball handler in the pick and roll.  He‚Äôs not aggressive enough as an offensive player, the jumper is rough and he just isn‚Äôt an offensive threat outside of around the rim. At times, you see young Jimmy Butler, but most of the time, he looks like a young Tony Allen lol"

"I wasn't ranking the players, only listing them.  I dont know how well Jimmy Butler is going to hold up over the years. I dont think a lot of teams in the league are eager to pay a 35 year old Butler $45 million in 2024."
John wall is for sure the worst. As for your list jimmy butler should not be on there and Kevin love should at least be ahead of hayward.
"You are right its not funny like Jimmy Butler quote  ""I think I'm stupidly locked in."""
Yeah that's what I like about Jimmy Butler always drives hard and he did less of that other bs
He could.be a jimmy butler type with longer range. What do you think his comp ia?
How did Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant out-rebound Bam Adebayo and Blake Griffin?
Has nobody mentioned Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson????
"Ant is literally the player the Timberwolves have been looking for their entire franchise history. Team has had good big men- KG, Kevin Love, KAT- but never that star perimeter player you sort of need to truly compete for championships in today's NBA.  Thought we had him finally when we got Jimmy Butler (oops). Thought Andrew Wiggins could turn into that player (ouch). Now it looks like we *finally* got a real one."
"I don‚Äòt think these guys do it, but I‚Äôd watch a studio show with any of Jimmy Butler or Blake Griffin."
"Kyrie as Kendrick Perkins is fucking hilarious.  I think CJ McCullom will be in the mix in some way. I could see jimmy butler being some kind of personality as well. I don‚Äôt know much about Nic Batum as a personality but definitely agree about Chris Paul, JJ, Draymond, maybe Russell but he‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm not as sure of."
"Timberwolves traded Ray Allen for Marbury  Traded Brandon Roy for Foye  Traded KG for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, and Telfair  Traded prime Kevin Love (26-13 averages) for Wiggins and Bennett. (Yes at the time this one was kinda fair because of Wiggins hype, but in retrospect it ain‚Äôt good).  Traded Michael Beasley coming off his two best seasons for cash  Traded prime Jimmy butler for what eventually turned into Malik Beasley and Beverley"
Not necessarily a bad trade but the Bulls gave up a first round pick when they traded Jimmy Butler and I feel like people just forget about it because the guy Minnesota drafted never played
"then he called rachel  that doesn't seem like the whole story though, that's probably how jimmy would tell it  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/11/5/18063864/minnesota-timberwolves-trade-jimmy-butler-drama-tom-thibodeau"
Still find it crazy he averaged more points than Jimmy Butler in the bucks/heat series
Luol was a fucking beast. He was Jimmy Butler before Jimmy Butler. He was an iron man even with the bulls medical staff trying their best to kill him. Any given night he could go off on offense and he was a terrific defender.
There is also the banner for Jimmy Butler for having the best $20 cup of coffee available during the the playoff bubble only available to NBA players
"That's like 6 times what front row upper deck seats have cost me to go to a T-Wolves game in the first half of the decade. I spent more on food than on the tickets. Hell, I think those same seats were only $50 each when I went in 2018 the first Houston game after Jimmy Butler was hurt."
Jimmy Butler
Did you completely forget Jimmy Butler &amp; Tobias Harris? And Embiid playing in the East going up against first round opponents like the Heat led by 36 yo D Wade?   While AD played in the toughest period of the Western conference maybe ever with his teams always dealing with bad injuries?
"Quoting u/ozymandias12    Some great nuggets in this GQ Profile of OG:  He wants to play 20 seasons:  What do I get outta this? 20 years. If I can get 20 years it‚Äôll be an amazing career for a kid that no one thought would play in the league. All my sacrifices, everything I‚Äôve given, the only thing I‚Äôve asked for is to try to get to 20. I wanna give that to myself, and I wanted to give it to my father.  Haslem thinks Tyler deserves to be in the Luka and Trae conversation:  Facts. He just hasn‚Äôt been given the keys. He came to a team that‚Äôs been successful and didn‚Äôt need a superstar right away...he came into a different situation. But skillswise, talent wise, damn right. Them other boys ain‚Äôt been to the Finals yet, and that‚Äôs not to knock them, but you see what [Herro] did. Boy got game. Straight up and down. And if he was on a team, probably not a good team, and he got to go out there and do his thing? Damn right he‚Äôd be in those conversations.  Haslem almost left Miami because they didn't want to pay him:  Shit, I was almost outta here ‚Äî they ain‚Äôt have no money left. I was about gone. They wasn‚Äôt saving enough for me. They just wanted the big boys. They wasn‚Äôt thinking about me, the only one who was was [Wade]. He understood my importance to this city and franchise and thank God he did because it paid off.  Haslem explains why the Bubble wasn't a fluke and how the team approached the situation:  I only stayed in my room or played cards with Jimmy [Butler]. Even LeBron, as much as I love Bron, I didn‚Äôt hang out with Bron one time in the bubble. My guys need to understand what we‚Äôre here for. They‚Äôre young: they don‚Äôt need to see me kickin‚Äô it with Bron, playing cards with Bron. We here for a reason. I want to beat Bron. I don‚Äôt need you confused! They don‚Äôt understand how I can kick it with somebody and wanna rip they head off.  I ain‚Äôt leave my room. I ain‚Äôt fraternize with nobody. And for three, four months, it was just about that. What pisses me off, man, is that people discredit what [the Heat] did in the bubble because we didn‚Äôt have a great season the very next season. Don‚Äôt get mad at me because your favorite team and favorite player was a mental midget in the bubble. Trying to fry chicken and have pool parties and shit, we ain‚Äôt here for that. Ain‚Äôt our fault motherfuckers was soft!...why discredit us? The Lakers ain‚Äôt make the playoffs the next season either and ain‚Äôt nobody sayin‚Äô shit about them!...that takes nothing away from what we did the year before. Doesn‚Äôt change that Milwaukee swept us last year, we still beat they ass two years ago! It‚Äôs still in the record books! They whipped our ass and we whipped their ass."
"Paul George/Jimmy Butler tier.  PG13 v Pippen is a legitimate debate IMO. George is the better scorer, Pippen the better passer, both great defensive players. George had better success as a #1 guy and the better peak season but Pippen played  big role on multiple championship teams. Pretty close."
"Having no max salary with a Hard Cap would prevent that.          How is Portland suppose to compete when they have to pay Lillard more than Giannis, Lebron, KD, and AD ?  Jimmy Butler is only 4 million cheaper/year than KD but he optimistically brings maybe 70% of the value to the court KD does.  The max Contract greatly increases the value of an elite player and drastically decreases the value of a really good player.       I just think the NBA would do a better job of developing professional players than AAU would. The skill floor and product on the court would noticeably increase. And NBA franchises could potentially connect more with their community."
"I genuinely thought Justise Winslow was gonna be who Jimmy Butler is for us right now. Defensive point forward leader of the team. He showed some flashes during the Point Justise days but couldn't really sustain it.  If it wasn't for Butler coming in and being what he is, I would have been so salty that Justise didn't work out."
"Kawhi ain‚Äôt a top 75 player and is nowhere near as great of a player as people claim he is. He was surrounded by elite defensive talent and amazing veteran savvy on the offensive end during his Raptors run, and he hasn‚Äôt shown he could be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù ever since. Even with his time on the Spurs, he wasn‚Äôt doing anything Jimmy Butler or Paul George hadn‚Äôt done."
You mean it wasn't Jimmy Butler?
"now i get why ben simmons doesnt want to play. he wants embiid, doc, and the sixers EXPOSED. he really is jimmy butler in that he is needed..."
"I hear this all the time mate. Jordan and Kareem didn't coast and played nearly every regular season game without games off.  Kareem and Jordan are at the top of the rankings defensively for C and SG respectively. Lebron isn't top 5 of his own era at the SF position. Kawhi, Artest, Iggy, Jimmy Butler, PG13, Bruce Bowen, etc. There is a long list of people in his own position I'd take over Lebron defensively.  &gt;Just because he‚Äôs not making All-Defensive teams doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt playing defense  There are plays where he literally doesn't go back on defense. He just stays on one side of the court waiting for the play to end while his team plays 4v5."
Doc Rivers is a good guy though. Jimmy butler is all about Jimmy
So did Jimmy Butler and I will never put respect in his name.
"CP3, embiid, jimmy butler, the morris twins"
"""The Servant"" that's a terrible name, but it would make sense for Jimmy Butler"
Jimmy butler called Kay soft so lavine&gt;kat
Jimmy Butler tried telling them.
Zach Lavine and Jimmy Butler were both better than prime D Rose from an effiency / skill standpoint
Jimmy Butler
"Anthony going to give PTSD to KAT, like Jimmy Butler gave him."
"Wait, I‚Äôm out of the loop. Jimmy butler is one of my all time fav players (if not #1 favorite, it‚Äôs just hard to choose). Do people think he‚Äôs mean? I know he‚Äôs tough and super competitive or whatever but like, is he an *asshole* asshole? Or like a Jordan asshole?"
Fan attending a Sioux Falls Skyforce Game: *‚ÄùJimmy Butler?? What are you doing here??!?‚Äù*
"Eh. Even with Rose, they weren‚Äôt getting past Miami with everybody except Nate Robinson and a rookie Jimmy Butler dropping like flies. Why risk him?"
"This is just business, the quicker you detect your emotions from it the easier it becomes. All parties know we eventually want to trade Ben, the FO's job is to maximize his value and eventually this will be resolved.  Unless he goes full Jimmy Butler, the biggest factors here are external"
"&gt; When that medical reason is declared bullshit by Sixers medical staff, is he going to just play?  There really isn't a ""when"" though. Embiid, Tobias and the rest of the team have been toeing the line criticizing Ben throughout camp, but when that story about Ben + Joel's fit came out he has no problem holding back and saying this team has actively tried to accommodate Ben. Tobias was kinder but honestly neither had given the full throated support they did before the Nets game. I genuinely do think something changed because Ben was disengaged the first two practices but addressed the team for the first time while we also agreed not to fine him anymore.  I wouldn't put it past him and his camp to make a stink down the line, but we've held firm unless he comes in full Jimmy Butler it does not seem we are at all interested in moving him before Dec. 15th. I do think there's a higher chance he starts and plays for us than what you're describing.   IMO, slowly they have realized his best bet for getting off this team is reintegrating and playing well. Why even report if all you're gonna do is get kicked out of one practice and then apologize the next day? If he wanted out come in and make a huge mess to force our hand. You can't ""fake"" a mental issue, if he wants to actually not play then just keep citing that there isn't a fight to be had or something to disprove like a knee issue would. He's not out with back tightness right now, he's out due to his mental"
Who out of these 30 are you taking Gobert over? Serious question  Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Nikola Jokic  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Bradley Beal  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Kyrie Irving  Trae Young  Zion Williamson  Donovan Mitchell  Khris Middleton  Karl-Anthony Towns  Bam Adebayo  Jaylen Brown  Jrue Holiday  Zach LaVine  Deandre Ayton   Ja Morant  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander
Trae young got the same contract as Luka.   So...suggests he is also a supermax rookie extension player.  And what about Donovan Mitchell's 5 195 rookie max?  What about Paul George? Kevin Durant?  Anthony Davis? Jimmy Butler?
"Jimmy Butler does not get enough flak for being a free throw baiter/drawer compared to Trae/Harden, he was 2nd or 3rd in % of pts being FTs last year and he constantly does this move where he bumps into someone and throws his head so far back like he's got whiplash and gets the call   Kelly Oubre is not good looking at all, I have no idea where that meme started apart from the nice colour of his eyes, guy looks so lanky and grotty apart from that"
Jimmy Butler is a nice guy
*laughs in Jimmy Butler*
"Imagine they draft Tatum, and actually hold on to Jimmy Butler  Butler Simmons Tatum Harris Embiid  disgusting, L O N G B O I S"
"They had jimmy butler as well. Imagine if jimmy butler was here, embiid is where he is now and simmons progressed the way people expected him to out of college? That‚Äôs a championship favorite"
Yeah they just need an attitude guy like Jimmy Butler and they will fix the other guys
He and Jimmy Butler would for sure get along
This has the jimmy butler scenario written all over it. Raptors will be waiting when he's available via trade lol.
"came down to him vs lillard, i prefer lillard, but am not gonna fight you if you think luka is better.  that is the tricky part, such a huge glut of top end talent in the league. on any given night, 25 guys can look like top 10 guys.  hon mention: luka, cp3, jimmy butler, tatum, pg, zion, brad beal, trae young, donovan mitchell, kat, d book.  luka probably wouldnt make my top ten list, but he belongs in tier 3 imo"
Didn't they have a good team with Jimmy Butler?
Jimmy Butler would never
this idea that KAT never plays defense is so fucking stupid.  &amp;#x200B;  Jimmy Butler wanted a 5 year max and the wolves refused so he went to Miami. That's all that was.
He will finish what Jimmy butler started
Yeah because Butler was just blameless in that whole fiasco... He practically did a courtside interview with Rachel fucking Nichols who he had fly all the way to MN while his infamous practice was going on. There's also only 2 players on the roster that were there when Jimmy was and it was a different coaching staff so I really don't know what you're going on about.
Jimmy Butler reincarnated. KAT‚Äôs worst nightmare.
And how about the never playing defense? And how about Jimmy Butler spending one year there and being like ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm good‚Äù?
It's not a bad take KAT hasn't proven once to be a leader and ill believe Jimmy Butler saying he's a loser all day.....notice winning follows Jimmy while losing follows KAT.....even Rubio was depressed he had to go back...I was delusional about Simmons for a long time too....
I was thinking it‚Äôs looking more and more like Jimmy butler was probably right about that team

"I remember when the rule change was announced, some random ass dude I‚Äôm the comments with about 250 upvotes was like ‚Äújimmy butler is in shambles‚Äù and when I called him out on it cause jimmy absorbs actual contact going to the hope, while also foul baiting his only response was ‚Äúwell jimmy flops and shoots blah blah blah amount of fts a game.‚Äù Like he definitely doesn‚Äôt watch any games he only had that stat. Fast forward to this season and butler is STILL shooting free throws at a high rate while guys like harden have barely shot 12 in 3 games. Idk it just bothered me, and now jimmy proved him wrong."
"PER is a trash stat fyi but since you want to use it Drummond has a PER of 23.5 in 2018-2019. Whiteside has a PER of 25 in 2019-2020.  19.5 is a really bad PER lol. Youre just showing me how bad he is.  BPM is basically just representation of a players box score. Inaccurate stat as well.  Jaylen Brown, Middleton all have BPM lower than Westbrook. Westbrook isnt better than them.  Jimmy Butler has BPM higher than Lillard, PG13, Luka etc fyi"
Jimmy Butler credits a lot of development to Boylen but man is he not a goos HC
Reminder that Jimmy Butler had multiple consecutive seasons shooting league average from 3 until he bizarrely injured his wrist on the Sixers and has shot 25% since.
Ironically Jimmy Butler would love this man
"I like the Sixers, and only the Sixers.  But there are plenty of other players that I root for.  TJ McConnell, RoCo, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, Dario Saric, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, Bobi, Deaaron Fox, and a couple more.  I‚Äôd never root for any of these players when they play against Philly but I do any other time."
Impressive given how bad things have been after Jimmy Butler was traded. East is gonna be extremely competitive this year since the worst teams improved more than expected.
Turns out it‚Äôs a bad idea to have point guards guard Jimmy Butler.
Jimmy Butler is my father
"Klay Thompson (I vibe with him)  Jimmy Butler (funny as hell, hope he actually goes through with opening a cafe)  KAT (just seems like a good dude)"
&gt; players always take the side of the player  I can't imagine Jimmy Butler siding with Ben Simmons here
"I think we should go get Jimmy Butler, it's amazing what he's done for that Heat locker room."
"Easy to blame Paul, but it‚Äôs just as likely Simmons simply didn‚Äôt want to be around the team and that‚Äôs why they held out instead of pulling a Harden or Jimmy Butler."
"Pretty much what I expected. Butler and Giannis driving to the hoop is either a No call-Miss,No call-make,two free throws or a potential 3 pt play.   At worst it‚Äôs a 40-60 gamble for both of them. I would take those odds if I‚Äôm Jimmy and Giannis. Very unlikely to get multiple No call-misses unless they are having a very very bad game."
Micheal Jordan and Jimmy butler?
I mean‚Ä¶ Michael Jordan and Jimmy Butler are pretty close in comparison
"Exactly the point.  Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, John Wall, AD and Jimmy Butler all had that option as well.  That's 8 max contract players (not counting Ben Simmons) in just the last couple of years. ESPN keeps pushing the Zion and Doncic want our narrative too which would be 11 players."
We‚Äôre talking about the same Butler that was hit with a gentleman‚Äôs sweep by Harden in the 2018 playoffs right??   Harden is miles clear of Jimmy.
"Jimmy Butler is a hardworking, good dude.  Its great to see he's come out on top after a long string of bad luck with bad situarions."
Yea Giddey is a rookie. I interpreted it as both ‚Äúsorry man‚Äù and ‚Äúdamn you‚Äôre tough.‚Äù When you have an MVP caliber player doing that to you in one of your first NBA games ever it‚Äôs def taken as a sign of respect. If say Jimmy Butler was to do that to Ben Simmons then that‚Äôs a different story.
"Which is weird because a lot of elite tier players these days are in their 30s: Curry, KD, Lillard, Bron, Paul George, Harden, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, and some of these guys like Curry and KD are better than ever."
"I disagree. If you‚Äôve ever blocked someone it‚Äôs a really good feeling. I can only imagine what‚Äôs it like to block a dunk on a fastbreak regardless of where the game is at. Basketball players like that feeling, they‚Äôre chasing that. it‚Äôs instinct to go for the ball. You don‚Äôt think Jimmy Butler or Kevin Garnett or Ben Wallace or Michael Fucking Jordan is going for that block?"
A guy in my Fantasy drafted Kawhi and Kyrie on the same team then tried to send a trade to me for Jimmy Butler and Trae Young.
"Much like how your franchise ran off Jimmy Butler, Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Markelle Fultz, and tried to pull a Dennis Schr√∂der on the league by drastically inflating the trade price for Ben Simmons, only to get nothing."
"Trae Young, Joel Embiid, and Jimmy Butler are almost there too"
Point guard ja morant or Ben Simmons  Shooting guard Jimmy butler  Sf probably Bron   Pf probably giannis  Center... probably embiid.     Mostly going off size athleticism  with a bit of toughness in the mix.
Jimmy Butler hasn‚Äôt played a single minute of guard this season.
"Funny enough, I was already doing an analysis on something related and I modeled some of the worst snubs of the last decade or so. Note, these are statistical snubs on fairly simple metrics (so no RAPTOR/EPM/DPM/LEBRON or older ones like PIPM/RAPM), so if a player missed a bunch of the early season, slumped early, or missed getting on because they just weren't recognized by either the fans or the coaches, that's not included.  * Jimmy Butler, 2021 (missed a chunk of games) * KAT, 2017 * Rudy Gobert, 2019 (mentioned by /u/NitroXYZ) * Bradley Beal, 2020 * Trae Young, 2021 (multiple mentions) * Damian Lillard, 2016 * Chris Paul, 2018 * Al Jefferson, 2014 (/u/jknuts1377) * Josh Smith, 2012 * Nikola Jokic, 2018 * Damian Lillard, 2017 (/u/AMos050) * DeAndre Jordan, 2015 * Clint Capela, 2019 * Blake Griffin, 2017 * Andre Drummond, 2019 * Stephen Curry, 2013 (/u/dmavs11 and /u/KareemWasTheGreatest)   Methodology is similar to dribbleanalytics' here https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bcdpls/oc_using_machine_learning_to_predict_the_2019_mvp/. One of the variables that isn't refined for this particular analysis is team winning percentage. End of season winning percentage was used (because it was already available for a different analysis) rather than record at the all-star break."
"That's why there's so many posts about Donovan Mitchell, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker and Jimmy Butler eh"
"Probably is only probable, doesn‚Äôt mean it would happen. Joel Embiid at Center, Jimmy Butler that mercy swept MIL, Tobias Harris, JJ Spot up shooter Reddick, and Ben Simmons is different than Kyle Lowry, FVV, DG, Pascal, Kawhi, and Gasol. Different teams, different play styles. Sixers were stacked but Kawhi was better. Let‚Äôs bot forget the Bucks were perennial chokers until the Nets, Hawks, Lakers/Clippers/Warriors injuries"
&gt;Jimmy Butler vs the air  lmao
this is the best 10 game W-L we've had since Jimmy Butler left
Great question. Heat culture is really just an excuse for ‚Äútough guys‚Äù like Jimmy Butler to act like an ass
"Cant they just do an experimental vlog to see how it goes? They clearly have the tools to broadcast. Watch a game together, just dont show it onscreen. See what it looks like, and tweak it.   Just MVP that shit, submit it to one of the NBA broadcast partners (both these guys have connections, or their mgmt teams do) then pivot.  Draymonds current playing status is an obvious obstacle. I think another obstacle is that if people do it without a network backing, they need to do it consistently over a couple of months to get traction (I think Reddick mentions that to Dray in this interview). Maybe have to wait till Dray or Jimmy Butler (my personal nomination) retire."
"Yeah the only great players we've missed on in the last 15 years or so are Jimmy Butler, Nikola Jokic, DeAndre Jordan, and Marc Gasol. And the year we passed on Butler is the year we drafted Kawhi."
"44/34 on a 53% TS is obviously not great but it‚Äôs also certainly not bad enough to keep him off IMO. Who else would you consider because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really close as of now?  Edit: Jimmy Butler is deffo close if he‚Äôs considered a guard. He was last year but is listed as a forward this year, so I could see vote splitting keeping him out of all NBA 1st."
If they list him as a guard Jimmy Butler is just the most deserving option
Naz Reid isnt ‚Äúgreat‚Äù but the dude keeps on improving every single year in meaningful ways. I think a good type of player for you to look at are low drafted or undrafted players like FVV or Jimmy Butler. A couple dudes that were very reserved and focused on their role to start their careers and then as different events increased their confidence and their franchise‚Äôs confidence in them they blossomed as players
"Without question. Changing 1 or 2 draft misses to the best player available can take literally any team from bad to great. Just using the Timberwolves as a coincidental hypothetical here because they traded for the pick before he was drafted - imagine if the Wolves take Giannis instead of Shabazz Muhammad back in 2013. Assuming everything else plays out as it did in terms of draft moves and assuming Giannis's development isn't affected one way or the other, you would have had a team of Giannis, Jimmy Butler, KAT, and others I'm not thinking of presently. I don't know that ends up as a Championship team solely because of the existence of Golden State, but at the very least, that makes you very firmly in the top level of contender that season. Can also say that for literally any team in 2014 with Jokic being available deep into the second, or 2012 with both Khris Middleton and Draymond Green being available in the second round. Taking just those three and putting them on literally any team makes them a mid-level playoff team at the absolute minimum, even if the team outside of them is doodoo.  The what-if game is a little less dramatic in some other sports, but basketball is so disproportionately affected by the top level players that making even one or two changes with those guys drastically changes the makeup of the league."
Jimmy butler is Michael jordan son ..
Patrick Ewping- Frozen Envelope   And I really want to believe the one about Jimmy Butler being Michael Jordan's son ü§£
Jimmy Butler is a wildddd fraud lmao  For how worked up he was a few weeks ago I thought for sure it would have carried into last night.
Jimmy Butler &amp; Rachel Nichols
Hasn‚Äôt even been able to get Jimmy Butler on the podcast even though they play on the same team.
Jimmy Butler called the refs as well as Rachel confirmed  Wait a second when you look at the types of calls he gets that actually makes sense lmao
Jimmy Butler was the first to come to mind with the latter like yeah we get it you work hard.
"Alex Caruso is the biggest thief in the NBA and it isn‚Äôt even close. Caruso is averaging 2.2 steals per game, and Jimmy Butler is averaging 2.1 steals per game.  If you‚Äôre wondering who the worst thief is. It‚Äôs Payton Pritchard, who has yet to get a single steal in 159 minutes of play."
Jimmy butler. He was right. He was right about everything.
Jimmy Butler on his way to the Nuggets locker room after Nuggets players crush Heat players again.
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
"randle still leads the team in assists by a lot and is running an effective 2 man game with fournier, he leads the team in potential assists per game by an insane amount  as far as frontcourt players go only jokic, draymond, lebron and giannis are ahead of him in that category.  and jimmy butler and paul george but they are kind of hybrid SF/SGs.   either way all those guys are elite players and many time all stars/all NBA players.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing/?sort=POTENTIAL_AST&amp;dir=1  just long stretches where nobody is hitting their shots, randle is putting it in their hands  too many times this season it's a ping pong game where he passes it to kemba, kemba dribbles for a few seconds then gives it back to randle with minimal time left on the clock.   his game should look better with better PG play and it has several times this season when kemba was benched late in games"
"I don‚Äôt think so tbh.  The Jay‚Äôs are literally the two arms of Brickexodia, alongside elites such as Jimmy Butler, Pre-ASB Russell Westbrook, and wide open Steph Curry.  They‚Äôre still great shooters, but just literally prone to the most streaky and inefficient shot jacking I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of watching. What other duo could combine for like 7/33 we‚Äôve seen the Celtics manage."
"My only disagreement here is that NBA basketball isn't that match-up dependent.  Especially on a team like the Blazers, where we lack any elite 1-on-1 or perimeter defenders, the scheme is designed around switching and drop defense.  Any player can force a switch onto the defender they want.  That's why teams target Dame and CJ a lot of the time, or quick players target someone like Nurkic to pull him to the perimeter.  Norm doesn't just get to match-up against a 3 because he's in our line-up.  He switches defensively pretty much 1-4, 1-5 and is supposed to lead his guy into the help, where both RoCo and Nurkic are expected to help.    Norm is just fine on any 3, as far as any player/defender would be up to the elite defenders.  Obviously, if you have a healthy Kawhi, or someone like Mikal Bridges or Ben Simmons, they're game changers for on-ball defense.  Outside the top tier guys, though, he's about the same as anyone.  Players like LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi offensively are going to be a mismatch for anybody.  He does as well as you could hope.   If he played the 2, he would likely be guarding the same people because of switching."
i highly doubt both bulls guards make all defensive teams  booker should deserve consideration he's really been excellent on both ends this year  jimmy butler also plays small forward so uh yeah
Jimmy Butler seems like a fun dude.
Who the hell says Jimmy Butler sucks?
But the kids on Reddit told me that jokics brothers were world class assassins from war torn countries where you have to eat your young to survive and they were gonna send that fake tough guy jimmy butler back to the country club he grew up on!?
"Jimmy signed with Miami in 2019:  Start: Wade, Robinson, Butler, James, Bosh  Off the bench you have Dragic leading a bench mob of Adebayo, Battier, Allen, and Ellington.  Thats an elite defensive team with a lot of talented iso scorers, elite playmaking, and some of the best shooters in the league outside of Steph and Klay.    Peak KD warriors (which is probably the 2017 team, not the 2018 team) is obviously a fucking cheat code, but Miami has the tools here to at least challenge them. It would be a 6 or 7 game series.  The Warriors death lineup revolved around small ball switching and running teams off the court, but with Bam and Bosh as the team's two centers, they'd be able to keep up with that lineup defensively as well as anybody, Bam is obviously a gifted perimeter defender and Bosh is capable on the switch as well."
"For Miami, I dunno if this is allowed but I would just move Bron to point and throw Jimmy at the 3. On offense Bron is basically the point anyways. Defensively, Wade guards Curry, Butler guards Klay, Bron guards KD, etc etc."
He's entirely correct. It's also why people vastly underrate Scottie Pippen and still think of him as MJ's sidekick. It's why 'kids these days' don't talk about or appreciate Joe Dumars and Gary Payton. It's why they still say Jimmy Butler sucks.
So that‚Äôs 3 great Ws in your eyes! How many West teams can you say that about?   The Suns? No. All they‚Äôve had is the Nets  Maybe the Nuggets but the Suns started out a mess and idk where you view the Mavs without KP and if you consider one of those as a good not great win that‚Äôs a no.   The Jazz are a no because if you call the Hawks a mess what would you call the Bucks without Middleton and Holliday.  Mavs have only 1 in the Clippers as Jokic was out in the Nuggets W.  The Clippers have 0 as Luka and Jimmy Butler were out.  So if you want to go asterisking you make a really bad take as still the Warriors have the best wins for a top western team. You just decide to pinpoint on them.
"Defense is not how many blocks you get. So yes a 6'2 guards could help you as much as a 7ft guy out there without blocking any shots.  People saying that Giannis dominated in the Finals forgot he is the same guy who didn't had a chance against KD, playing just a bunch of possessions on the best offensive guy in the league, and the year before did the same with Jimmy Butler."
"I mean sure, but Draymond would pair well with any off ball threat, including KD. Like Draymond is really good, but I don't think he unlocks Steph in a way that a guy like a Ben Simmons or Jimmy Butler or whatever other playmaking forward doesn't.  And this shows in the numbers. Draymond plus Steph is really really good, but Steph and 3 and D players is still really good."
obligatory fuck jimmy butler
How you think I feel reading on here about jimmy butler and Kyle lowrys romance. I think we should separate everything to each teams post if anything.
are we gonna call Jimmy Butler 14ppg playoff scorer because thats all he managed last playoffs?
Jimmy Butler approves
Yes because people make accounts to talk shit anonymously about Jimmy fucking Butler lmao. He must be up to something super sinister
Jimmy G Butler. The G stands for ‚ÄúGets jealous‚Äù
Him and Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler isn't foul hunting you fucking box score watchers, Jesus Christ"
"Yup, Jimmy is good enough to the #1 guy if you build around him well enough and to his strengths, like you guys obviously have. It‚Äôs kinda disingenuous to say the recurring theme with Butler is money since any player with his pedigree would expect a max, and that‚Äôs the reason these guys play at the end of the day, for money lol."
"&gt;Also at the end of the day it seems the recurring theme with Butler is money lol.  Yes, superstars like to be paid more than Andrew Wiggins and be on teams playing good basketball.  Only a salty Timberwolves fan would think to twist that as a bad thing about Jimmy, I swear."
I‚Äôve always agreed with that sentiment and I don‚Äôt really like Jimmy Butler
I believe they eventually offered him the max.  The problem is Brett Brown was a major issue with the team too and also the comments about how to ‚Äúhandle‚Äù Jimmy Butler made him sound like an animal.  The team did nothing to support him while publicly saying they wanted him they looked like snakes
Jimmy Butler is my favorite enigma
Both of your points are false. If Kawhi misses that shot it goes to overtime. And Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid were the first two options.
 Folk hero Jimmy Butler strikes again

Embiid and Butler get along so well personality-wise and ofc Embiid &gt; Bam as a player but Bam as a teammate on the court was def better suited with Jimmy because of playstyle. He's an excellent roll man that suits with Jimmy's passing and he's a very good passer that can utilize Jimmy's off-ball game better.
This is the realm of only losers and haters to wish this on other people.  But yeah for me personally it is obviously Jimmy Butler
"You‚Äôre telling me someone like kawhi, Paul George or jimmy butler couldn‚Äôt  lock him down if you could hand check"
Jimmy Butler stopped us from reaching that record smh
"Yeah man. Even in the finals against the Heat. Really dirty fouls when they were trailing the game. I remember Rondo pushing Butler in mid air, took Jimmy like 5 minutes to get up from it. Common foul lol. It‚Äôs hard to respect the NBA these days"
Jimmy butler wins an eastern conference and gets to the finals. Timber wolves celebrating beating him in a regular season game in November. Pathetic franchise
"a more accurate translation would be:   *go fuck yourself, Jimmy Butler!"" (the actual translation would be ""go to the bitch that birthed you, Jimmy Butler!"")   the rest is pratically correct."
"LMFAO Google translate for whatever their post says gives you:  Go to the goddamned bitch, Jimmy Butler! Timberwolves customer! Sucker! üê∫"
Towns - Embiid   Jimmy Butler   Ref treatment
"Big man rivalry, and residual Fuck Jimmy Butler energy"
As he should. Dude gets hit constantly and gets no calls. Dude like Jimmy Butler get a better whistle lol.
"I'm taking Lebron, Curry, KD, Harden, Giannis, Embiid, Jokic, PG, Jimmy Butler, all over AD. If this was a healthy season you'd have Kawhi, Lillard (who's healthy just hasn't been playing as well), and some years westbrook over him.  Then you throw in borderline guys like Gobert, Mitchell. Ya I don't think it's that far of a stretch to say AD might not be a top 10 player anymore."
"Based off of this season?   Steph, Jokic, Giannis, KD are everybody's obvious Top 4 and Tier 1. After that, I go LeBron, Harden, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, PG, and CP3 all in Tier 2."
"Nah, that‚Äôs Jimmy Butler  Aside from one finals run, what has he done honestly?   He‚Äôs a forward who can‚Äôt shoot anymore and is pretty reliant on contact.  Good finisher and great leader tho, give him that."
"Gobert is one of the best help defenders but Anthony Davis is better on perimeter (if y‚Äôall remember he stifled jimmy butler in game 4 on one on one). Those are facts but if gobert had solid (not that they‚Äôre bad now, but I mean really good at defense) defenders on the wings then he might be able to focus more on offense instead of making sure the team doesn‚Äôt fall behind."
People really just started hating Jimmy Butler out of nowhere
"Lol against the fucking rockets whom have the same player everyone is currently shitting on whom was on the lakers, a Miami Heat team with Jimmy butler and a rookie leading the way and they struggled with that . You think the 2020 lakers are an all time great team lmao?"
I think the Jimmy Butler wolves had a lot of OT games that season.
I remember Etan Thomas and yet nobody will convince me that photo at the start isnt just Jimmy Butler with glasses.
I shit you not I saw a Jimmy Butler Prince jersey in the wild.
Andrew Wiggins has been an absolute *dawg* recently. Dude is driving like he's Jimmy Butler. Nobody else on the team can draw fouls like he does.
has nobody mentioned jimmy butler and the timberwolves?
Ben Simmons   Jimmy Butler / tybulle  Giannas   Draymond  Gobert
"This year the best performance by a clearly not-top-5 player is probably PG13, Jimmy Butler, or CP3.  Clearly, CP3 has been top-5 in the past."
I think Jimmy Butler and the Wolves dunno.
Jimmy Butler   And the bulls
"The ""normal"" top 5 is something along the lines of  Steph Curry  Giannis  Jokic  KD  LeBron  now the guys that have the argument for being top 5  Kawhi  Joel  Harden  Luka  so it's probably 9 deep. I do not consider AD a guy that belongs in the top 5 conversation anymore. He just hasn't played well enough to justify it.   But basically Embiid if he's healthy and playing well is a top 5. Luka is a top 5 if he's just playing well but he's been slow to start. Kawhi when healthy and in the playoffs is arguably the best guy in the league. Harden has that top 5 potential, but it shifts depending on his shooting and other stuff.   Then beyond that comes the borderline top 10, Jimmy Butler, PG13, CP3, Dame Lillard, etc. basically guys that are good, maybe not #1 option good, or just have big holes in their game that need good complementary pieces to really win, at their best they're the 1b. guy."
I picked Jimmy Butler as my MVP but still did not at all expect this to happen. Also picked the Warriors and the Heat to be 2 of the best teams in the NBA with the Warriors making the finals‚Ä¶everyone one here laughed at me

"What this should read is ‚Äúafter Anthony Edwards travelled, Jimmy Butler grabbed the ball, then got half-heartedly pushed by Anthony Edwards. The players very briefly squared up then left each other alone.‚Äù  The whole ‚Äúthis guy is tough‚Äù ‚Äúthis guy doesn‚Äôt want to fight‚Äù bullshit is just that, bullshit.  You lot just love to overreact to the slightest things.  ‚ÄúStared him down‚Äù means more than a cursory two second look ffs üòÇ"
"Jimmy butler, Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown are not as goid and never will be better than Paul George."
"Like the other guy said, have no hate for the heat or their fans. It‚Äôs only for Jimmy Butler. Once he‚Äôs gone it‚Äôll be back to normal again."
"Reminder that the wolves declined the rockets' offer of 4 first round picks for Jimmy Butler 2 weeks before trading him to Philly for Covington, Saric, and a 2nd round pick lmao"
"You probably think this is about the rumors of them having a fling.   It isn't.   When Butler was trying to force his way out of Minnesota, he went and disrupted practice, then shortly after he left he went and did an in-person interview with Rachel Nichols.  Who just happened to be in Minneapolis at the time. It's obvious that the only reason she was there was to interview Butler, but the only way that could've been arranged is if she knew that Butler was going to do what he did ahead of time.   So Jimmy Butler decided he wanted out of Minnesota. Skips the early training camp practices, then schedules an interview with Rachel Nichols by telling her he's going to disrupt our training camp practice. He shows up, disrupts practice, then does an interview about how important honesty and hard work is to him and trashes our entire organization. Which means he's such a cancer to the team we have to trade him for basically nothing in return.   This reporter decided to help Butler completely disrespect our team on national television, directly hurting our team's future. Then last year when we played Jimmy, he was doing his usual on court bitching towards KAT, and KAT told him to call Rachel. Implying he should go cry to the media again. Thus, the meme is born.   So fuck Jimmy Butler, fuck Rachel Nichols, and fuck anybody who asks for a TL;DR, just go read it."
"The title should read ""Jimmy Butler trolls T-wolves by leading his team to the playoffs every year since leaving their garbage organization""."
Jimmy Butler deserves a shout
"That‚Äôs fair, I just think he‚Äôs gonna have a tougher time than some of the other guys ranking that high. He‚Äôs already defied expectations, but does he do that on a Jimmy Butler level or a Nikola Jokic level?  I think 5+ guys on that list will be better than Jimmy, but not Jokic. If he‚Äôs as good as Jimmy though, that‚Äôs a fantastic outcome. All of this is basically to say, he can be great and defy every expectation and still not crack the Top 5. I think the potential is there to be that high, but his current trajectory has him a little lower."
Jimmy Butler is the fakest tough guy in the league.
Jimmy butler exposed the timberwolves cope lmfaooo
Jimmy butler is a clown lol
"I never said anything about choking(I think that‚Äôs a really dumb myth. Player‚Äôs don‚Äôt just forget how to play, coaching schemes and defenses are just different in the playoffs and some players struggle to overcome them) or why he wasn‚Äôt playing well, and I‚Äôm talking about the entire time Jimmy Butler was with the Sixers, not just that one playoff series."
Minnesotan and former wolves fan. Jimmy butler was right. We should have traded Wiggins for him and then traded KAT. After jimmy left and I watched the mess they‚Äôve been I stopped caring. Move the team elsewhere.
"&gt;	But you know what? Him, the NBA, Rachel Nichols, and this sub have been 1000x worse for years. ""Jimmy was Right"" ""KAT is soft"" blah blah blah.  Why are you acting like this sub likes Butler? Besides the brief pause during the bubble this sub has ran a train on him since he left the Wolves.  https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c80b0k/haberstroh_im_told_that_jimmy_butler_did_receive/"
"They've collected some really hateable players, while not having anyone lovable enough to offset that.  Like, the Bucks have absolute tools like Grayson ""literally everything about the way he plays and his Ted Cruz face"" Allen and Bobby ""How About I Punch This Teammate"" Portis, but no-one hates the Bucks because they still have Giannis and everyone loves Giannis.  Whereas the Heat have allowed their team's leader to become Jimmy Butler, who seems to be incapable of just being professional about literally anything. He's all about the petty aggression... so long he's at a safe distance.  See: mouthing off from the bench but not, like, when he was anywhere near Jokic after the incident with Morris, and then holding photo shoots in the corridor knowing they'd get cleared out of their before they so much as laid eyes on the Nuggets."
Ant found out that Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt own a doghouse
Jimmy Butler snubbed
Jimmy butler is handsome
"nah, I think hes being sincere.  Dude had an active foudnation he personally was active in He invested in multiple businesses HE just opened a restaurant as if that is someone scheming to leave would do  He plays more games than any other stars in a time of load management with the higehst useage rates  he isnt media savvy and he was terrible these last two months and tillman took advantage  but the dominos and trajectory of this team changed with tillman not the dude ptuting up numbers four-5 years marathon of rarified air even in hall of fame standard. That takes mental resiliecne and its such a marathon it takes grit and a drive to be great  these things don't happen on accident, thats why Jimmy butler says hardens the hardest to guard. Thats why his peers who battle against him and probalby frustrated by the way he gets fouls still voted him players MVP. Media may not like him, hes respected to those who hoop    I'm not a fan of iso ball, I do get that they were doing what was most efficient especialyl with an owner not willing to jump a cent in the tax."
"Disagree I think the gap is pretty big and Middleton wont overcome it because he already peaked. Obviously its possible but very unlikely since he is 29 if we was 25 or 26 like Embiid and Siakam then I would have said its possible but no way a 29 year old is still improving as no player has still improved after 29 maybe except Lebron.  I think its not close at all because of how dominant Butler is in the playoffs and when it matters. Like I already stated how much better Butlers stats in the playoffs were in 2020 instead of Middleton but even when you look at the 2019 raptors Middleton choked against them where as Butler dominated and was the Sixers best player that .  Im not saying Middleton is a bad player cause hes not and he is a pretty good player but comparing him to Jimmy is just straight wrong. Jimmy is a top 10 player and in the same tier with guys like Dame and Jokic where as Middleton is in the same tier with guys like Simmons,Siakam and Ingram"
You have Jimmy Butler
Come on man I disagree with this dude and I think he is being a little harsh on Middleton but Jimmy Butler is on a another tier from Middleton
Thank Jimmy butler for that lmao
"LeBron, AD, Curry, and Jimmy Butler to the Nuggets"
The best one of these Jimmy Butler ads was during the bubble the commercial of him packing his bags while singing to a song
"I really hate how much people go after players when they end up acting the way Harden did. He went to the team privately first and asked to be traded, just like Jimmy Butler in Minny and AD in NOLA before him. Once the team said no, we're willing to get uncomfortable if it means not trading you, then you can't be upset if the player then resorts to antics to increase the pressure on the team to move them.   Paul George went to the Thunder and asked to be traded to the Clippers, and rather than throwing a fit over it, the Thunder just traded him for a huge haul, so no antics were ever necessary. But that doesn't mean Paul George tried anything that Harden, Butler and AD didn't, he just had his request acquiesced to right away without the team deciding to go to war with him first.  The reality is that if your star player wants out, they're gonna get out. If they come ask for a trade and you just ignore him, then all you're doing is delaying the inevitable, probably worsening the return you'll get for him, and creating an unnecessary shit show in the meantime. Better to just accept the reality and deal with it than trying to pretend like this situation doesn't exist."
Watch Andrew wiggins during the season Jimmy butler was in Minnesota
"lol yeah, i guess you‚Äôre a fan of rose‚Äôs 13 ppg?   rose sure took those knicks pretty far lol  drose hasn‚Äôt played defense since his injuries; and even then he‚Äôs a small guard. jimmy butler was the reason they went to the playoffs. as evidenced by their record the following year with rose"
Ben Simmons is not consistently great and is a bad fit next to Embiid who is a far superior player in all aspects. People consistently point to how they pushed the Raptors to the brink but that wouldn't have happened without Jimmy Butler.
"Jimmy Butler was worse than Harden too IMO. Put in his trade request a week before the season started, and refused to play non marquee games because of ""general soreness"" then he trashed the other players on the team publicly."
"Eh that playoff series they had a dude like Jimmy Butler, and we saw what he can do last year and the difference that makes. I‚Äôm obviously biased but the Sixers really seem to me like a team that has a ton of talent so they‚Äôll win a lot of games, but poorly constructed for playoff success."
"You might actually be right or Keldon might be close to it. I started listing some of the best SFs in the league and there's a pretty big drop off once you get past Ingram or DeRozan level: Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Khris Middleton, Bojan Bogdanavic, DeMar DeRozan, Michael Porter Jr., Malik Beasley, TJ Warren, OG Anunoby  I'm sure I'm forgetting some guys but I was thinking that the SF position was much deeper than that."
What are your thoughts on Jimmy Butler?
"Yeah, I agree with everything :)  That Sixers team was fucking STACKED - Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Simmons, Tobias Harris, Redick, sooo much talent.  They certainly could have won it all - I think they‚Äôd beat the injured Warriors convincingly, though a Bucks/Sixers series could have gone either way.  That Bucks team was dope too, we just matched up really well with them - Gasol, Kawhi, and really the whole team did a phenomenal job on Giannis.  But yeah, for that Sixers series we really had to grind that out with elite play from Kawhi and great team D, the rest of the team was struggling on offence for most of the series.  We lose that series without Kawhi, probably convincingly.  Even with Kawhi, there were times I thought ‚Äúthese guys are too deep/good, we‚Äôre gonna lose.‚Äù  But other than that series, the season+playoffs felt mostly like a superstar with a great supporting cast, terrific team ball, vs. one dude carrying weak teammates."
"""protect teammates"" like what Jimmy Butler did absolutely dusting off Wiggins and KAT to prove that they were still boys? It's a grown man league and these are grown men, they can handle this nonsense lol."
"I didn‚Äôt say jimmy Butler is better. But, he probably does give his team a better chance of winning games. Hard work, consistency, accountability, pure effort, and a desire to not only defend his teammates, but actively sacrifice his game to elevate them. Those are all things that Butler strives for. Can‚Äôt say the same for Harden who is definitely more skilled and talented than Butler."
That's what Jimmy Butler was in the league until he had an offensive revelation
Jimmy Butler has something to say about this
"I was going to frame it as question but I‚Äôm not going to bother, if you think that Jimmy Butler gives his team a better chance of winning games you are wrong. Could James Harden be better yes. But there are very few better players than him."
"Literally the only things Harden was wrong for were directly trashing the team quality in public and acting like a headass during the pandemic. I really don't see how you can blame him for wanting out though.  Guys like KD/LeBron go to a new team in FA every time they start slipping from their chance at a championship, Harden is 31 and wants his chance at a superteam now.  Jimmy Butler did way worse in terms of shitting on teammates, but he's an ""alpha"" and a ""dawg""?  Harden literally did what most stars do at some point, except he made Houston relevant for 8 years. I'm not a fan of his ISO-ball either, but the dude has been a top 3 scorer for the entire decade, won an MVP and assist title, made it to the WCF, and improved his defense after the hate. Of course boogie and wall are gonna be upset, they just got there and Harden is suddenly leaving. He's never been accused of being a bad teammate before.  At the very least, Harden's trade request got the Rockets an absolute haul that accelerates the rebuild."
"Lots of MIP winenrs are good defenders  Giannis, Siakam, Vic, Jimmy Butler, Paul George"
Jimmy butler too
&gt;Harden‚Äôs case was above and beyond pretty much anything we‚Äôve seen in recent times to be fair (Kawhi the only other one in the same realm for me).  The jimmy butler situation is firmly on the mt. Rushmore of team exits
"""This mf picks up full court!"" - Jimmy Butler"
"Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green and Damian Lillard"
Draymond Jimmy Butler Joel Embiid
"Jimmy butler, Klay, and maybe brad lol"
"CJ McCollum, Draymond, Jimmy Butler but knowing  Jimmy he prob wouldn‚Äôt do it"
"KD, Jimmy Butler and Draymond"
"&gt; Jimmy Butler  No one's forgotten Butler, but after the bubble even a lot of Minnie fans have come around to the conclusion that Butler was right. Many of us had got there long before that."
embiid bam and vucevic are centers and Butler is classified as a guard I think. if jimmy is a forward Hayward is fucked
"Well they just became fans after the Jimmy Butler trade, what do you expect?"
"No. His offense isn‚Äôt all that you can ask for. He doesn‚Äôt do anything when he doesn‚Äôt have the ball. He is a zero threat. Watch Lebron, Jimmy Butler, Curry. They may take some offensive plays off or play decoy. But they are also still vital pieces of the offense when they don‚Äôt have the ball. This is what drove Chris Paul crazy. Harden literally just stands around the perimeter if he doesn‚Äôt have the ball. Anyway, we shall see how Hardens lack of off ball movement works with Kyrie and Durant. Or, if he learns how to play off ball. The dude has all the tools."
"1. LeBron 2. Giannis 3. KD 4. AD 5. Steph 6. Kawhi 7. Harden 8. Dame 9. Luka 10. Jokic 11. Embiid 12. Paul George 13. Bradley Beal 14. Jayson Tatum 15. Devon Booker 16. Jimmy Butler 17. Jaylen Brown 18. KAT 19. Ben Simmons 20. Kyrie 21. CJ 22. Khris Middleton 23. Sabonis 24. Brandon Ingram 25. Chris Paul 26. Trae Young  I would take any of these players over Westbrook in a heartbeat and I'm probably forgetting others. He might compete for that next spot with Donovan Mitchell, Zach Lavine, and Vucevic."
"""it's never happened before, so it must be impossible to ever happen!""  The player empowerment movement is relatively new. It's not like shit like this was going on for the entirety of the NBA's history. And how do you define a superteam? Are the Clips or CP3 Rockets a superteam? What about the Jimmy Butler 6ers? Hell, we can even keep Kyrie's last ""superteam"" of Kyrie-Horford-Hayward-Brown-Tatum in the conversation! Or is a ""superteam"" only created when it wins a championship, making it literally impossible to declare a superteam before then.  Dumbasses making me defend the fucking LAKERS of all teams smh"
"Jimmy Butler set the standard, the way off a team is being critically disruptive."
"I'd argue he did give that team his all, except for this season. Anybody remember that stretch where he averaged like 50 PPG and carried the Rockets to a good record when all his other teammates were  injured?  In the end, though, Harden's behavior got him what he wanted, and he was traded to a super team with KD and Kyrie, so one could ask why wouldn't he have done what he did. The Rockets fans still love and respect him, and even if the team hates him, they've got to clench their teeth at fear of alienating their fans and other players, as evidenced by the video the team just released wishing him the best.  Anyway, if the Nets end up doing well, nobody will remember or care what Harden did a month from now, just like they forgot about what AD, Jimmy Butler, and Kawhi did. If Harden's team ends up being good, everybody will have totally forgotten about all this drama by the end of the season."
"Totally disagree on both counts. I wasn‚Äôt for trading for harden but I get why outsiders think it‚Äôs a good move. Trading for one year of kawhi would‚Äôve have been a terrible idea, just as trading for one year of Paul George or jimmy butler.   The thing that everyone seems to forget with kawhi is that the raptors were lucky that KD and Klay were hurt. No team in the nba was beating the warriors fully healthy. So yeah it worked out for Toronto but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it would‚Äôve been a good move for the Celtics. If the warriors are healthy you lose, kawhi leaves the following season and then what?"
If I were him I‚Äôd workout with Middleton and Jimmy butler. Middleton will help Rj with his jumper and Jimmy would basically one v one with Rj and Butler would not go easy on him at all and he will get the challenge of his life. It could either turn him into kwame Brown or a very good nba player
"Nets will get up 3-2, then lose a close game 6. They will be leading by about 12 halfway through game 7, and then the Nets will go 0-XXX from the three point line and end up losing by about 7. KD will then join the Heat to play with Kawhi, who will have been traded 1-for-1 for Jimmy Butler (Nets beat Heat in the conference finals in a close and extremely controversial series featuring multiple suspensions and an official protest by the Heat asking to replay a game. The replay will be granted but the Heat will lose a close one)"
"Lots of people are arguing about Kyrie‚Äôs stats and saying dumb stuff like ‚Äúhe averaged 27 blah blah blah boo hoo‚Äù and forget the stuff happening right now with Harden and throughout his career. Y‚Äôall also forget people like Jimmy Butler who doesn‚Äôt put up fantastic, eye popping stats but still makes his team better. Tbh, Kyrie is not one of the people who makes his team better. Chemistry is so important to winning a title, which is why there‚Äôs so many failed super teams out there, and Kyrie sucks chemistry out of every team he‚Äôs on."
Excuses. If he‚Äôs a DPOY he should have guarded jimmy butler simple as that.
Lebron . DPOY didn‚Äôt guard jimmy butler end of story
It‚Äôs really just how fast you heal. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to grind but you do have to change your training and learn to conserve energy. It‚Äôs absolutely possible to be as scrappy as a young player at that age but it‚Äôs really damn hard to do that all season. I know Jimmy Butler trains like a motherfucker but you don‚Äôt see him playing at literal MJ levels like he did in the Finals unless he has to.
"&gt;You keep saying winning one title at the cost of losing multiple titles like you have some sort of crystal ball and you know for a FACT the Lakers would have won multiple titles and that‚Äôs just not the case. If you can definitively prove to me that LA would have won multiple titles without the trade (which you can‚Äôt) then you‚Äôll be correct.  You are still missing the point.  You can also not prove that the Lakers only won because of that trade, and you can also not prove that the Lakers would not be better for the next X years had they not made that trade.  Which means that any such trade is not an ""automatic"" win.  &gt;I like Ingram I was hoping the Lakers would Keep him instead of Kuzma but he‚Äôs not going to be an all star and average 25 a game on the Lakers.  You don't know that, and are still missing the point.  &gt;The Lakers pre AD were good enough to make the playoffs and are finals contenders because of LeBron and LeBron only.   You don't know that, and are still missing the point.  &gt;People didn‚Äôt think LeBron and AD would be the Clippers would you have been more confident with LeBron and Ingram?  You are still missing the point.  That said, they traded far more than just Ingram for Davis.  The assets they spent on Davis would've been enough to acquire, for just two examples, both Jimmy Butler and Malcom Brogdon.  So they could potentially have been something like James, Brogdon, Butler, Ingram, and Zubac ( who they traded separately to make room for Davis ) -- with Hart, Ball, Kuzma, Caruso, and others off the bench.  That lineup competes with anyone, to say the least.  &gt;Also please tell me what year LeBron won a title with less talent than what the Lakers would have been cus I wasn‚Äôt here for it  You should pay more attention then.  &gt;And your lottery analogy is not at all on par the lottery is 100% random luck and lottery tickets are what? 2 dollars? I don‚Äôt see how that compares at all here  The Davis trade was a massive risk.  Just because it paid off does not mean it was a wise investment -- just like lottery tickets are not a wise investment just because someone wins.  Yet, those winners probably unanimously believe them to be wise, after the fact."
"What the fuck are people thinking, Miami has probably the most celebrated ‚Äúculture‚Äù of any team in the league, and Harden has demonstrated himself to be one of the most toxic and uncooperative players in the league, 1b with Kyrie. I don‚Äôt think he fits well with Butler in terms of playstyle (Jimmy doesn‚Äôt shoot threes) and he could just leave in a year anyways."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/jimmy-butler-explains-why-he-liked-post-about-james-harden-joining-heat-i-just-want-the-guy-to-be-happy-184458794.html  https://www.google.com/amp/s/rocketswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/13/jimmy-butler-says-james-harden-is-nbas-most-unstoppable-player/amp/  Jimmy is always saying good things about harden
"They didn't want to play with him because he obviously checked out, considering he requested a trade before the season  Contrary to popular belief, James Harden is not Hitler reincarnated. I was referring to role players since they would lose depth.   Gambling on late picks to turn into great players (which is very very rare) over a top 5 player in the league is absolutely insane  It's funny you mention how Harden is acting disgruntled when Jimmy Butler is on your team lol"
"I'm not sure there is a trio that would complement each other more than those 3 would have. Jimmy hates taking early game shots and would rather pass and then clutch it out at the end of games, Harden is the exact opposite and fades towards the end, and Bam can't make his own shot but can rebound and setup around the rim--perfect to play off of Harden. Bam and Jimmy also completely cover for Harden's defensive weaknesses while he actually covers for them by being practically immovable in the post. Even Giannis couldn't score against Harden with AD and Kawhi just waiting to move in on help D, now while those two are DPOY guys, Butler and Bam absolutely can be similar.   That Heat team would probably have been better than the Nets trio, especially since nobody knows wtf Kyrie even is, and regardless all three are ball dominant and not really as great defensively."
"it does in covid season and we would not be the same team as last year.  Miami is built around Bam, Jimmy, and Goran having the luxury of doing whatever they want on offense because the defense can't help off of shooters like Herro and Robinson.   Obviously Bam, Butler, Harden is a great team but unless Harden is going to put up 30 3s a game the spacing would be 0."
"They're roster would look like Bradley, Harden, Butler, Bam, Olynyk with Dragic, Leonard, Iguodala off the bench. That's insane. Finals lock for sure, and they still have Bam. Plus, Harden and Jimmy are only 30. On the other hand, Heat culture would probably not mesh very well with Harden and the whole thing could just blow up."
"Yes and not a single one said he had a bad work ethic, in fact CP3 said he practiced too much and would have to be dragged out of the gym.   Also way to go ignoring context:   Dwight Howard fought w everyone and was almost out of the league after Houston.   CP3 was constantly injured and was a shell of himself in the 2019 playoffs, crazy how there weren‚Äôt as many issues when he performed to his level in 2018 huh.    Westbrook underperformed heavy in the playoffs and it was clear they wouldn‚Äôt win.    Can‚Äôt I say the same thing about Jimmy Butler?"
"Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt getting younger, your team isn‚Äôt good enough to even win ECF and this was the best shot at another finals.   Miami Fans boutta hit that cope button hard."
"He may never be an all-star and they kept that over James Harden, same age as Jimmy Butler"
"AD, Lebron, Giannis, Luka, Kawhi, Dame, Steph, Harden, Butler, Tatum, Westbrook, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul,  Paul George, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Andre Drummond."
"It really is astounding to me that you think you‚Äôre some three dimensional chess god while Danny Ainge has no idea what he‚Äôs doing. If you were the Celtics GM, you would‚Äôve traded Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and multiple firsts for Blake Griffin or Jimmy Butler years ago and the team would currently be at the bottom of the league with no draft capital. It‚Äôs hard to get to the finals. It really is. Not only has Ainge shown he can consistently get to the conference finals, he‚Äôs shown he can do it with purely homegrown talent. That‚Äôs no small feat. He‚Äôs got a huge trade exception to work with this off-season and the future looks bright. Ainge is 20 times the GM the Lakers have ever had and isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon"
"So he‚Äôs a butler, so he is jimmy, so he eats.  And constantly serving fools   Sounds about right.  /s"
"Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro, been waiting on a sex tape leak for a minute. üòçüî•üî•üî•"
"Lotta people talking about Shamet on here and what a crazy first couple years he's had. Drafted onto a good but young Philly team where he's arguably looked his best. Then traded to the clips in the Tobias trade when Philly went all in. Is then there for a good young Clips team that soons gets PG and Kawhi. Whole team underperforms and finds himself traded to BKN where KD Kyrie and now James Harden will be in a chip or bust situation. That's crazy that a third year player has played with Embiid, Jimmy Butler for a little bit, Kawhi, PG, KD, Kyrie, and soon Harden."
reminds me of the Jimmy butler has no rearview mirrors in his car since he never looks back.
The Jimmy Butler Timberwolves fiasco is my personal favorite
"Had to give up #23 on the Sixers when they traded for Jimmy Butler, too...   https://twitter.com/sbnation/status/1349745275699671042?s=21"
I just think kd can lock up almost anyone. Can is the word of focus here. I didn't day he was an elite defender. I said he CAN play elite defense. Like idk fucking Jimmy Butler for example. I wouldn't have jimmy on my all time defense team but I think he can lock up a lot of different guys if plays hard. PG is another good example.
"Humongous reach and completely incorrect of you to read what i said and then bastardize it by saying ‚ÄúNeTs ArE bEsT tEaM eVeR‚Äù.  If Healthy Brooklyn has TWO perennial All-NBA first team players and a third who is a perennial all-star. They are absolutely the favorites in the East when they will have 3 of the 4 best players on the court against basically every team in that conference. They will win the talent battle against every team, the only reason they wont win it all is because there are a couple teams in the league that have the star power AND two way ability that can match up to Brooklyn and beat them at their own game [LAL and LAC].   Milwaukees a great team but theyre not even close to having the firepower to score with the big boys. They couldnt even keep up with Duncan Robinson, Herro and Jimmy Butler last year, how are they gonna stop KD, Kyrie and James? Especially with a weaker Bucks roster. Brooklyns stars are salivating at the thought of going up against Bud‚Äôs sag into the paint defense lol."

"Real rich coming from boogie who was looked At as a cancer for a year and off Court threatens to shoot His baby mama in the head, fuck him he‚Äôs a scrub now anyway, hope He and the rockets play like Absolute shit and harden and the nets works out fine, harden went over a decade with no sort of problems like this, if he‚Äôs a diva Then so is jimmy butler and so is AD for Forcing themselves out too in shorter careers. Harden made it clear he wanted to be moved before the season, rockets fault for letting it get to this point instead of moving him or holding him out and boogie‚Äôs dumbass fault for signing there after harden already requested out. Also it‚Äôs not like boogie is gonna step up and be some great leader because he never has been. News flash to the rockets, if you don‚Äôt want your star to force his way out then don‚Äôt force out the good coach and good Gm he has a great relationship with and then not even interview the coach he wanted as well as being a cheap fuck for multiple years. This would not have been messy at all If the rockets just Moved him When he asked or just say him until they did."
"Harden has literally Played a decade in the league without doing stuff like this, don‚Äôt think Other teams are Really Worrying about it much, kyrie is a nutcase so I Underhand but not harden, harden made it Clear Before the season He wanted out, instead of moving him Houston said they were willing To Get uncomfortable, this is The type of Shit that happens. You downgraded at HC and I‚Äôm not even sure interviewed the guy harden wanted after forcing out the previous coach who harden had a great relationship with as well as the great GM who harden also had a great relationship with. This was bound to happen and Houston is stupid for not moving him quicker or just sitting him out until he‚Äôs moved before the season. Also wtf did boogie and Wall expect harden made it clear he wanted out before they were even there, this ain‚Äôt a surprise. Harden shouldn‚Äôt be lumped in with kyrie unless you‚Äôre also gonna lump in jimmy butler who did similar and AD who also forced himself out in a somewhat similar manner and they had both been in the nba shorter periods than harden when doing it."
"not in order but  1. Jimmy Butler saga  2. Andrew Wiggins never developed  3. Saunders is a shit coach  4. Injuries  5. Location, lack of free agents  6. Awful roster construction  7. Bad front office"
"No I said the best player, Jimmy Butler. You know the one that got to the finals without embiid."
Jimmy Butler making a three in the regular season
"If you‚Äôre talking about his pump fake and lean in, then yes. Everything else, no. DWade used to take major hits driving to the basket. He drove to score first, not to foul-bait. I‚Äôd say Jimmy Butler is a more of a baiter than Wade was."
"Jimmy Butler would never do that, we are in good hands"
"The double standard on this sub. Lebron has done this multiple times in his career. Blown up coaching staffs and demanded front offices acquire certain players.   All of a sudden Harden, who gave Houston his all during his tenure there outside of this season is all of a sudden ridiculed as if he doesn‚Äôt have the right to want out. They got rid of the head coach and GM he has played under his entire time being with the Rockets. Harden gave it his all and came short playing against one of the greatest teams of all time. Came closer than anyone.  He requested a trade before the season started and Houston dilly dallied. Jimmy Butler pulled similar PR antics to get out of Minnesota. Plenty of players have done similar."
Y'all acting like the Lakers didn't go through Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic James Harden Russel Westbrook Dame And CjüòÇ again fuck outta here  Edit: major props to jimmy butler
He's made more threes than Jimmy Butler has this year.
Shidddddddd Jimmy Butler and the Heat got something to say in the Playoffs. jimmy buckets all day out the east
Shidddddddd Jimmy Butler and the Heat got something to say in the Playoffs. jimmy buckets all day out the east
They had two top five player against rookies and jimmy butler
theyre saying that last years ring against jimmy butler and bum-ankle adebayo was the hardest ring in history so you know their always scheming the narrative
A player that's up there in popularity &amp; can put up all-star to superstars numbers. ex. jimmy butler.
Jimmy Butler and an injury ravaged heat team took him to 6 last season lmao
Sorry your team chose Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler.
Bucks couldn‚Äôt beat Jimmy Butler and co. You think they can take KD and Harden (never mind a lucid Kyrie)?
Which is why Jimmy Butler is a Sixer for life
"That's something you can say about the majority of superstars. AD, Lebron, KD, PG, Kawhi and Jimmy Butler all left their team.  These guys want to win rings and they will go to teams who can help them get one."
"Chris Paul, Rondo, Jimmy Butler, KAT, Gobert  Probably not the best talent-wise, but they have some strong hatred towards each other probably"
"Yeah I couldn't think of a dysfunctional PF, but Draymond would absolutely not work with the other clowns on this team.  Dray's a great team player for sure. But he's got a pretty outspoken style of leadership that doesn't gel with everyone. Kind of like Jimmy Butler."
"Even I know SAC community loved Boogie. People thought he was a hot head. Man wanted to win, to have structure, accountability, to grow. He and AD were killing it in NO. Then injuries. Like most people, he wanted to succeed, and was passionate about it. People thought the same about Jimmy Butler, that he was the problem. Fast forward, those environments were. He found his fit. Keeping moving forward, Boogie. Good luck."
"Its an offshoot of the Jimmy Butler ""Show the team how much they blow"" technique"
"Twice, and the problem is that simmons makes no advances in his offensive game so the same tactics that work before will work again.  Jimmy Butler was a big part of why that team took the raps to 7, and he's gone now.  They are a good team with a deeply exploitable flaw."
"I watched him guard Jimmy Butler and he had two historic performances in the finals. Giannis is the better isolation defender, it's not up for debate. And yes, Westbrook and Butler are not going to shoot because they are literally non shooters."
"I think it's real close but yeah thinking about it more I might lean this way. Thing is the perimeter/wing defense if there's no PJ involved becomes pretty shaky now if this deal happens. Obviously you still do this deal but its an issue.  Ultimately though I dont think I can trust Tisse to really play 25 min a night in the playoffs this year yet and if that's the case it's just hard to justify giving up Maxey.   If the cost of getting PJ Tucker though was having to give up Maxey over Thybulle I would do it. Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard......that roster just really needs a true wing defender to win a title."
"I think if PJ Tucker is involved in this I would side with you on this. If he isnt.........man that's hard.   The perimeter/wing defense becomes an issue with this trade(of course you still do it but doesnt mean this isnt true). Lakers had to put AD on Jimmy Butler last year because Danny Green couldnt do it. Seth Curry, Shake Milton, Tobias Harris, James Harden, Danny Green, those are your realistic perimeter defensive options  It's close. If the cost of PJ Tucker is it requires me to give up Maxey instead of Thybulle I would do that though."
"&gt;Why? Why specifically past the first round?  Past the first round is when you start playing the real contenders not teams like Orlando.   &gt;Green &gt; Tucker as a starter if we trade for Harden  Not really, just wait till Danny Green's shooting starts regressing a little before saying that. They had to put Anthony Davis on Jimmy Butler in the Finals last year because Danny couldnt guard him at all."
I think he matters because they will need a bigger wing to throw on Kevin Durant Jayson Tatum Jimmy Butler and hell if they make it that far LeBron James/Kawhi Leonard. Danny green can‚Äôt do it anymore that‚Äôs the PJ duty  You want lineup flexibility. Tobias/Harden/Embiid....you don‚Äôt really need more offense around that. Want to compliment it with more wing defense if the possibility exists. I actually think the lineup I like most is Embiid/Tobias/PJ/Seth/Harden. PJ guards 4 positions doesn‚Äôt matter what you list Tobias as if you want him to guard 4s you can easily make that happen    Also Dwight looks good now but it‚Äôs no lock he‚Äôs gonna be reliable enough to hold up as a backup C after the first round. They lost a series to Toronto literally because they died without Embiid on the court PJ is a real backup 5 for 10-12 min a game you don‚Äôt have to worry about
Jimmy Butler is who RJ Barrett thinks he is.
Jimmy Butler is good at basketball
Honestly speaking i like jimmy butler s story of success but hate his play so goddamn much. It's just drive after drive after drive to bait fouls. 16 fouls so many goddamn stops like shit he is worst than harden was and isn't given half the shit he gets
https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-has-lost-more-than-12-pounds-in-a-week/  He looks like a kid here.
"Jimmy Butler's real full name is actually just Jimmy Butler. His birth certificate doesn't say something like James Eric Butler, it's just literally Jimmy Butler"
Jimmy Butler is a fucking superstar. De‚ÄôAaron Fox will be a superstar soon. Those are my two takeaways from this game.
Almost like Jimmy Butler is a god damn superstar
I would quite happily let Jimmy Butler rearrange my guts.
Jimmy Butler has the Jordan and Kobe competitiveness. Just not any of the other things. But still a good thing to have mentally
"He needs to play like Jimmy Butler does on offense. If he does that, he could be a lot more effective."
"Keltner List time.  1.Was he ever regarded as the best player in basketball?  No.  2. Was he the best player on his team?  You could probably make a case, but I think most people would agree Chris Paul was better.  3. Was he the best player in basketball at his position?  Well, there's Kevin Durant, who won the MVP in what I'd consider Griffin's best year - 2013-14, where he put up a 24/9/4. I doubt you'd find many people who would have taken Blake over KD in any given year.  4. Did he have an impact on a number of playoff runs?  Yeah, until the team fell apart every year. And, aside from the 2014-15 playoffs, when he averaged 25.5/12.7/6.1, he was generally worse when it mattered. Still, those Clippers teams don't even get a chance to fail spectacularly without him, so let's say yes.  5. Was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime?  Sure isn't looking like it. Unlike a Chris Webber or Grant Hill-type, it seems like he's not going to be able to compensate for the loss of athleticism that was a huge part of his game by becoming a more savvy player. It's not that he doesn't have a great basketball IQ, but all the injuries have really left him lacking in a lot of ways, especially on defense.  6. Is he the very best player in basketball history who is not in the Hall of Fame?   Looking ahead, I doubt anyone will be making that claim, aside from a few Clippers homers.  7. Are most players who have comparable career statistics in the Hall of Fame?  Most silimar players by career arc: George McGinnis, Jimmy Butler, Peja, Harry Gallatin, Billy Cunningham, Marques Johnson, Lou Hudson, James Worthy, and Kiki Vandeweghe. So, there's a few, but not really.  8. Do the players numbers meet Hall of Fame standards?  Like OP said, BBRef gives him about a 50/50 shot, so he's not completely lacking statistically, but his long history of injuries really cut into his prime, and is definitely going to stop him from padding his stats with a graceful second half of a career.  9. Is there evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics?  Nothing really jumps out at me, but if you have an argument, please add it.  10. Is he the best player¬†*at his position* who is eligible for the Hall of Fame but not in?  I take Chris Webber over Blake. Some people might even put Rasheed Wallace or even Shawn Kemp (a great comp for Griffin's career arc, if you sub ""injury-prone"" for ""coke and Twinkies""), but Griffin probably won't end up the best 4 outside of the Hall.  11. How many MVP-type seasons did he have? Did he ever win an MVP award? If not, how many times was he close?  No MVP wins. Three seasons in the top 10 for MVP votes, with a high of 3rd in 2013-14.   12. How many All-Star-type seasons did he have? How many All-Star games did he play in? Did most of the other players who played in this many go into the Hall of Fame?  Only six. Again, the injuries are the culprit here, since Blake was nothing but popular throughout his career in LA.  13. If this man were the best player on his team, would it be likely that the team could win a conference final?   LOL no.   14. What impact did the player have on basketball history? Was he responsible for any rule changes? Did he introduce any new equipment? Did he change the game in any way?  I mean, he (kind of, sort of) dunked over a Kia? He's probably top 10 for basketball players turned actors?   15. Did the player uphold the standards of sportsmanship and character that the Hall of Fame, in its written guidelines, instructs us to consider?  Well, duh. Not everyone gets compared to Gandhi AND Ali.  &amp;#x200B;  So, nice career, short peak, no rings. If he gets in, it won't be the most egregious thing I've ever seen, but it'd be some weak bullshit for sure."
"bullshit   they beat the Heat twice - and Jimmy Butler wasn't playing  they beat the thunder and the hawks   whoop-de-fucking-do   and before that , they got beat by the cavs - twice"
Lmao. It‚Äôs recency bias to think Butler is a top 15 player cause he went head to head with bron for a series. Jimmy is great but the reaction to him is the most recency bis we‚Äôve had.
Jimmy Butler will score either 13 points or 55
Do you know who Jimmy Butler is?  Bam is their best player right now because Jimmy is out
"Yea but he said scouting players, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris were both picked after Iman.   Defensively he was great, offensively he was bad."
The Twolves deserve it the next five years.   It still won‚Äôt bring Jimmy Butler or the playoffs back.
Your team is salvageable imo. Luke Walton is just an ass coach and y‚Äôall were really unlucky  with Bagley. But Tyrese and Fox are nice pieces to have. Timberwolves are past the point of no return. They‚Äôve had KAT and 2 other 1st picks in the past 7 years. And have one Jimmy Butler playoff appearance to show for it.   Coming from a Lakers fan y‚Äôall could have a Chip on your hands if that makes you feel any better...
I think you guys will start winning games once Jimmy Butler comes back.
"I love Jimmy Butler but look at the follow up that this guy was saying. He was saying there were no championship level teams in the east last season and that was absolutely untrue  Donovan Mitchell is totally capable of being that jimmy butler level guy for the Jazz in the playoffs, where he seemingly turned on god mode last playoffs. It literally took Jamal Murray also going god mode to stop him."
Heat have Jimmy Butler.
"""The Italian Cock"" Danilo galinari, The baptist john collins, General Soreness Jimmy butler, Punchbob Shitbloke bobby portis, Fartin will barton, lord covington"
Jimmy butler burned out? He just led a team to the finals
Having Jimmy Butler as a teammate
Our third stringers are only good if Jimmy Butler is leading them in a scrimmage
"Imo the only real mistake the Sixers have made was the Harris deal / the Harris contract. Too many assets and too much money. People can complain about Jimmy, but that guy has not been easy to get along with on several teams and may already be sliding significantly due to age - and often can't score on anything other than FTs these days.   I don't think letting Butler or JJ walk was bad and I think your moves this offseason were brilliant. I'm on the trade-Simmons bandwagon but regardless the Sixers are a real contender this year and Joel may be MVP due to the strong front office work."
I don‚Äôt think that team record is gonna as bad once Jimmy Butler and Dragic come back. I would change my comment to ‚ÄúBam will be an all-star‚Äù
100% agree. Jimmy Butler greatly exposed that organization.
Jimmy Butler aka Jimmy Buckets aka Jimmy Barista
Jimmy Butler has to be related to Mj as well
his ceiling is probably jimmy butler. and the good thing is he's already more advanced offensively than butler was in year 2.
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler does that too. LeBron has often done it as well. It's somewhat common for great passers to do that.
Forgot to add abused by jimmy butler
Small Jimmy Butler
"&gt; True its popularity but Tobias has been better than siakam vanvleet kemba and sexton and Jimmy butler barely played  Meh.  Dudes that are injured for the year still get in like KD, Curry, and Thompson.  I think Kevin Love was still getting the votes after the he became a Cav and was barely getting 15ppg under Lebron and Kyrie."
True its popularity but Tobias has been better than siakam vanvleet kemba and sexton and Jimmy butler barely played.  I‚Äôd also argue he‚Äôs been better than Tatum. Brown should be an all star for sure tho
"Jimmy Butler has only played 4 full games and Tyler Herro has missed multiple games as well, outside of that other players like Bradley have missed time as well."
I can't wait for the update when he starts drinking fluids again.  &gt;Jimmy Butler gains 10lbs muscle in a week!
That‚Äôs nearly what Jimmy Butler was averaging last year
jimmy butler is obviously a deepstate double agent working for the lizard people
"If you know the type of person Jimmy Butler is and the type of shape he keeps himself in, and you still think to yourself fuck the lockdown, covid survival rate is 99% , masks are for pussies, you're a bad person and that's it.

No they can't argue this in any way when Jimmy Butler has barely played and they've been severely hit by injuries and Covid Protocols ....

I know a (fat) guy that lost 25 pounds in 2 months because of COVID.  Also ventilator and hospitalization didn't help. F covid. And god bless jimmy butler
"Exactly, just saw where Jimmy Butler has lost 12 pounds since going out"
"You seem personally offended that OP didn't scream JIMMY BUTLER IS OUT, GUYS!  It's weird..."
"Jimmy Butler was certainly not known as a top 10 player before making the Finals. The Heat didn't win, but still, the narrative changes if you win in the playoffs. If the Jazz made the Finals or even won, Donovan Mitchell would become known as a top 10 player in the league"
"Jimmy Butler specifically, don‚Äôt know if you know him"
"6-11 with your best player out is nothing...the lack of mentioning Jimmy Butler being out for 11 of those is ridiculous. Dudes an elite player, there are teams with elite players healthy worse than 6-11. It means nothing, they‚Äôll finish top 4 seed as long as Jimmy comes back and those picks will be doo doo"

Jimmy needs a Butler
I‚Äôve heard Jimmy Butler referred to in fantasy circles as General Soreness and Major Stiffness. Due to his propensity to miss games for vague load management reasons
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler hasnt played since Jan 9.
Jimmy Butler has been terrible to start the season.. all these arbitrary reasons for a sub 500 team that was in the finals last year lmfao
I've been arguing that they don't actually have Jimmy Butler on their team and the last nine games have been a boon for me
Jimmy Butler has only played 6 games why is everyone shitting on them at partial strength?
"Jimmy Butler just dragged the Miami Heat to the Finals and pretty much became a top-ten NBA player in a year where he shot something like 25% from three and pretty much stopped shooting threes in the playoffs.  His physicality, veteran craftiness, and will to win allowed him to score three points the hard way, by drawing fouls and finishing after the foul.    Butler‚Äôs effective penetration drew a crowd and left his three-point-shooting teammates wide open for kick out passes.  And he played great, high-energy defense as well.  Obviously it‚Äôs a handicap to be bad at three-point shots in today‚Äôs game. But there are still other ways to be great at basketball."
I mean not really. Jimmy Butler wont be an allstar because he has missed most of this season to Covid. Even that is bullshit.
Hopefully they can welcome ~~Jimmy~~ Skinny Butler back onto the court soon
I think this is further proof that Jimmy Butler is an incredible player.
Jimmy Butler didnt even average 1 3pm per game last year.
"The results of a team being worn down by injuries and COVID. Jimmy and Bradley got COVID around two weeks ago after playing the Wizards the day Beal had to be taken off the court pregame. We played two games with 8 guys who were mostly end of bench guys, which resulted in Herro straining his neck. Then the last Brooklyn game Dragic got hurt as well. So we played today without Dragic, Herro, and Butler. Our team is already thin on perimeter playmakers, and it‚Äôs even worse when we lose our three good ones. Teams kinda demoralized right now tbh.   TLDR: Fuck the nba for making us play the wizards game."
Bruh most pros are not on TRT. If they're on anything it's stuff for faster recovery not huge gains like test. NBA players are really not that big for the most part. Honestly if they were on test and still that small they'd be doing something wrong.  And Jimmy butler of all people is nowhere near the size you'd need to be to cause suspicion of PEDs. Not for an elite athlete with good genetics.
Why would Jimmy Butler be trying to cut weight?
"Beal would be absolutely fire on Miami, imagine having Jimmy Butler as one of the most overqualified 2nd options in the league to fall back on. And if Bam's expanded repertoire on offense is anything to go by, thats their 3rd option sorted too."
"not the best or anything but woulda been fun with:2017 bulls: Celtics rondo (or maybe lakers playoffs rondo? jk lol), prime flash (2006 mvp version), miami jimmy 'business trip' butler (2020 bubble version), 2017-18 cleanshave fiery nikola mirotic (when he got traded to the pelicans) and robin lopez (not sure which is the best, maybe 2014 portalnd?) with a bench of mcw (2014 rookie of the year version) and current day indy doug mcdermott.

Nah I feel like jimmy butler had a more successful season than Trae Young last year
"Not over Randle who‚Äôs having a career year carrying the Knicks. But with Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler and Siakam potentially missing out, Tobias chances are looking great"
"Prince has been great 3 and D but he doesn't create.  Likewise with Windler, who has played much better than a #26 pick.   We're really missing someone who can reliably attack the hoop with a big enough body to dominate smaller guys.  Like a Jimmy Butler type."
Imagine if we had a guy who could close 4th quarters... maybe Jimmy Butler?
"Are people really surprised by this? This is the Lakers MO. The Lakers are all about dirty plays. Do people forget about when the Heat were slaying them in game 5 of the finals, and then Dwight Howard concussed Jimmy Butler at the end of the game with a cheap shot, causing him to play ""strangely"" (aka concussed) in game 6?"
This year's Sixers with Jimmy Butler would have been a dynasty.
"Same sentiment I hear in regards to K Love and KAT, it‚Äôs annoying.  Players sign knowing their team and/or organization suck, and in KAT‚Äôs case he actively made the team worse by refusing to sign until Jimmy Butler was traded, then we‚Äôre supposed to feel bad for them?"
"I mean if you're a team on the brink of contention, but with an aging star(s) (ie, tight window), it would make sense to go all in right now. Kyle Lowry isn't getting any younger. Neither is Jimmy Butler. Most teams that want Beal to push them over the edge don't have the luxury of waiting two seasons. A lot can happen in that time."
"Yeah, and with Covid, there's some people who missed a bunch of games like Jimmy Butler. CJ McCollum also had a really good month but he's now injured so kinda interested to see how something like will turn out."
Most star players whose main contributions to the game are scoring get overrated at some point because it takes a while for reputation to catch up to actual performance. Best example I can think of would be Thunder Melo where everyone way excited at first but by the end it was obvious he wasn‚Äôt a star.   On the flip side there are star players who contribute in lots of ways like Lowry and CP3 who become underrated as their scoring declines. I would bet on Jimmy butler to be this guy in the future
My God the Jimmy Butler hype is unreal. The dude is a great player but he hasn't avg over 20 points in three years 19/6/5 TS% .575 the past 3 years. He's been putting up Pascal numbers and people keep sucking him off. I don't get it
Jimmy butler will be underrated in the future.
"So he was great against the Heat with old Wade, and against the DLo Nets? First round match ups?  And in that series where he was important, was he the main ball handler? Not Jimmy Butler?  So again, I ask the question  What has Simmons done to get more attention on the perimeter? What‚Äôs stopping teams from sagging off of him when he‚Äôs the main ball handler?  Something must of changed in that department since his rookie season?"
"I still remember a few years ago when GMs said they would pick him first to build a franchise with, which I found laughable. What happened now? He‚Äôs extremely talented and can shoot excellent for a big man. Is it the intangibles that he‚Äôs lacking? Jimmy Butler would know"
"General demeanor on the court. His well-documented issues with Jimmy Butler and his criticisms for lack of effort. And I think this is a pretty good indicator of where his head is (understandably) at.  &gt;	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even recognize most of my other games and years I‚Äôve played and how I felt those days,‚Äù he told reporters in an emotional interview after the 111-101 victory. ‚ÄúIf I can be honest with y‚Äôall for a second, I mean, I don‚Äôt really recall or really care. &gt;	I only know what happened from April 13 on. Because you may see me smiling and stuff, but that Karl died on April 13. He‚Äôs never coming back. I don‚Äôt remember that man. I don‚Äôt know that man. You‚Äôre talking to the physical me, but my soul has been killed off a long time ago.‚Äù"
"Jokic, he's by far the best player according to impact metrics which are designed to tell you which player helps the team win the most. Now with MPJ back Jokic's play will translate to a bunch of Ws again. Joker's putting up massive numbers but they also are as valuable as they look.  Historically guys like Andre Kirilenko and Iggy fit the bill. Iguodala rarely had standout boxscore seasons but impacted the game like an All-Star for many years. Jimmy Butler comes to mind if we look at the past 2-3 years. Draymond is another good example. Chauncey Billups is another one. Jason Kidd put up unspectacular numbers but was a high impact player. Lowry is another great example as you mentioned. Honestly any Top10 player fits the bill as well, strictly speaking. Harden Bron AD Giannis Kawhi KD have the highest impact in the league and so their impressive boxscores are also the opposite of empty stats. Jrue Holiday is another guy that has more impact than his statlines suggest. Generally great wing defenders fit in that department since their value is hard to capture through traditional means."
"I'm pretty sure Jimmy Butler did exactly that and the team folded, and it's pretty clear that the problem wasn't Jimmy or Thibs. The Wolves flat out employ a shit staff from top to bottom and have low quality ownership to top it off. Monkeys are running the zoo and they don't know why there's shit all over the place? Not a good sign."
"Lol yup. When the Heat were down, I didn't stop watching the game because I knew the Nets defense wouldn't hold long enough. In the end the Nets eked out a win, but I figured (and I think a lot of people did before the game) that Bam would feast tonight, and that's worrisome for the Nets when you realize they had Kyrie and Harden against the Heat missing Jimmy Butler and Herro."
Jimmy butler might have something to say about that
Miami haven't had a full squad and they are quite difficult to judge on. They haven't had Jimmy Butler for a while and they need to make a few moves before trade deadline or next season. They will fight for 3-6 seed at best and I have Sixers and Bucks at top teams.
"Meanwhile the Spurs get a number one pick one time and build a dynasty, the Thunder's only time with a number one pick on the roster was Joe Smith for half of the first season which is also the only season under .500 in team history, and the Heat have never drafted number one and got a ring even before LeBron showed up.  The Wolves, however, have only made the playoffs one time without Kevin Garnett and that was with Jimmy Butler who only missed the playoffs one time in his career, on the 9th seeded Bulls who went 5-11 in the games Jimmy was out.  James Dolan would have done better with this team than Glen Taylor. An orangutan with a dartboard would have done better. The hivemind of r/nba would have done better.  It's a shame that Wolves fans have to deal with a team run worse than the Detroit Lions."
Jimmy Butler was right all a long.
"We are a loser franchise that hires losers. I had hope for our franchise when we bought Butler in, but when Jimmy left I lost all hope. If he can't instill the right work ethic in our young players no one can. We need a stretch defensive 4, we need more capable wings and a better defensive PG. We need to clean everything out and start again, including KAT. Hiring Sam Hinkie would be a great start"
"Ofc the ideal lineup would be with Jimmy Butler and without Olynyk. We got injured players, our rotation is a bit fked up because of it."
It's strange to me that people don't seem to realize Jimmy Butler hasn't played more than a healthy half of basketball for Miami this season.
I want mf JIMMY BUTLER BACK ALREADY! FUCK!!!!!! AHHH
Jimmy Butler wasn't playing this game?
"Bam with a 40-piece, no Jimmy Butler and only losing by 4 to this Nets team is disgusting."
"The Nets might have won this game but I wouldn't really consider this a win for them mentally. It's embarrassing the had to eek out this win against Miami who is missing Jimmy Butler and Herro. Bam dropping 40 points too lmao. This isn't a good sign in all honesty. They have a LOT of work to do after another mediocre showing with all of the ""big 3"" playing because if they play like this in the playoffs they are going to get eviscerated. Especially down the stretch in that final 2 minutes of the game.  I love the fight Miami showed in this game."
Jimmy Butler is shooting 85% from the line and 15% from three
Jimmy Butler
"Gary Payton, Jimmy butler, Kawhi leonard, scottie pippen, giannis  all coached by thibbs"
"heres where ure wrong. Giannis is on a great team. Hes the difference maker in his team's success. Jimmy butler and the heat had no business beatign them but they did. Lebrons teams in the past, dames teams were never as good as giannis's. And lebron's success on those ""super teams"" which were really a big 3 with  other players being mediocre at best was largely because of him so yes when he wins he will still get his respect."
"okay Dwade was attacking the rim and going at people all the time, plus he didn‚Äôt really become Wade until like 05 when the last of the defensive rules were changed to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game (https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf)  Chris Paul is the same as D Wade.   I have multiple comments explaining how Manu Ginobilli‚Äôs flopping is one of the worst thing to happen to basketball and it‚Äôs why the Spurs were so hated in the early 2000s.   Reggie Miller was also pretty well-hated and i didn‚Äôt like reggie as a player then and i don‚Äôt like him now.   Laimbeer is one of the dirtiest players to ever play, what a great example    the fact of the matter is that in the era of the 80s to 2005, it was all about getting into the paint and attacking the rim. yes you had mid range jumpshots, but that‚Äôs when the drive or the post game didnt work. and they didn‚Äôt flop nearly as blatantly. they bitched about calls, but Marcus Smart is embarrassing the way he flops for how good of a player he is. same with LeBron. 100 times out 100 give me guys who drive into the lane and then try to beat some ass like Kermit Washington. watching Jimmy Butler roll around in pain laughing and tickling other players on the court feels like something out of Baseketball    watching guys shoot 36% from 3 isn‚Äôt fun.  they miss 60% of the time and i can get that at my local high school. NBA superstar Trae Young makes 42% of his shots. who in gods name wants to watch that? it‚Äôs just a free throw contest.   and missed jump shots are uber less exciting. what is more fun to watch: 6‚Äô6 220 pogo stick Desmond Mason miss a layup against 6‚Äô10 Chris Wilcox or Coby White and Jordan Clarkson trading pull-up 3 clanks?"
Thibbs: Give me Jimmy Butler in a three team deal NOW
"He was a pretty versatile combo guard defender that could defend 1-3. Smart, tough, stronger and more athletic than he was given credit for and always in good position. He was Thibs go to perimeter defender next to Deng before Jimmy Butler came into his own."
General soreness - jimmy butler
His growth is one of the biggest that come to mind Jimmy Butler is another and Pascal Saikim has to be considered
"If by drop the hammer, you mean Jimmy Butler was playing concussed because Dwight Howard hammered him in the head at the end of game 5, then yeah, the Lakers dropped the hammer on them."
"Does RJ have the fire?  I appreciate him being more aggressive and it will take some time to start converting, but he needs to take over these games.  When outside shot not falling, do a good ole fashioned post up and get to the rim.  And then make your ft's.    If Jimmy Butler does it, you do it.  That's it."
MJ and Jimmy Butler üòÇ
Between stars maybe. But I promise TJ Warren hates Jimmy Butler. And Kyle Lowry and Aaron Gordon hate each other

Jimmy Butler in 2018 sat out the game  But you still have to show up
I heard a rumor that when Jimmy Butler visits Paris he makes everybody call him James Gar√ßon
"Did JVG and Mark Jackson die? Mark Breen was trying to start a conversation about Jimmy Butler and Lebron James, and there was no one else joining him in the discussion."
"NBA needs to have two three point shootouts at all star weekend. One with the great shooters of the league, and a second one with guys like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, and then the winners of the two contests should face off in the finals."
"I never lied lol. When did I say he was shooting free throws well? What would any other player average playing only 30 minutes a night? Jimmy butler for example, considered clutch in the playoffs, played 38 minutes a game, averaging 22/6/6. He would look trash as well if he could only play 30 minutes a game. Lebron averaged 42 minutes a game in the playoffs man. What would Giannis look like playing 42 minutes a game? 90% of nba players would look a whole lot worse if they played 8-12 less minutes a game. Playoffs or regular season. It only speaks to how good Giannis plays in the regular season, and how he‚Äôs not nearly as bad in the playoffs as some casual fans would think"
"What Jimmy Butler did the other night was a flop, writhing on the ground only to get up laughing"
How quickly they forget.  I'm taking Jimmy Butler over Paul George or Jayson Tatum.
"Is it really not plausible for the cavs to bring better defensive personnel and ball handlers? Shit they did it the very next season with guys like rose,wade, clarkson,hill and green. Its not like im saying they could have added Jimmy Butler or something.   Point is that if the GM of the cavs had done a better job with roster construction while bringing in more defensive minded coaches then that series would have been much closer.  But because they didnt they lost convincingly. It wasn‚Äôt strictly a case of the warriors being guaranteed a chip  Nobody‚Äôs denying their talent but talent alone can only get you so far. Also its always been interesting to me how much the rating of Draymond fluctuates depending on the argument people are trying to make"
That‚Äôs a really good point. Luka‚Äôs game this year is James Harden with the Jimmy Butler DLC.
I think there's a big step down from being a top 2-5 guy to being an 8-12 guy. Jimmy Butler tier is still a big step down from AD.
"I can only say as Heat and Jimmy Butler fan, this shows some parallels with the situation, but some counters as well.  For parallels, it is clearly a player on a team he‚Äôs with dissatisfied with. He was very clear on wanting to be traded, and went not met, he acted out to show how very much he was serious about leaving. This was much the same with Butler and the T-Wolves, that practice being evident.  However, unlike Butler, Harden was not only the franchise player, but also pretty much was the face and orchestrator of the rockets with Darryl Morrey and D‚Äôantoni. He got his Dwight Howard, his Chris Paul, and Westbrook, and while made playoff runs, he couldn‚Äôt finish.   So while I can understand the want of a trade for him, he shouldn‚Äôt be making an excuse. He should be honest about it, especially about the parts on where even though Houston gave HIM everything they could, HE couldn‚Äôt capitalize on what was given to him.  I would respect Harden a lot more if he did that, but instead its more like he‚Äôs still trying to have everyone on his side, but in trying to appease them, he‚Äôs just making it worse. Brutal honesty is how Jimmy Butler went from vilified toxic lockerroom menace, to Miami‚Äôs new superstar sun."
Jimmy Butler hasn't declined yet
"Carmelo, Westbrook, Wade, Jimmy Butler, CP3"
Cry bitch. He said he prefers to watch it. And knowing the kid now almost everything he says is jokes. Jimmy Butler also said similar things.
"Jimmy butler is actually a perfect example. His play style is almost worst than harden with the foul baiting and like you said, what he pulled with forcing himself off teams on multiple occasions was even worse than harden.   Yet he‚Äôs probably one of the most beloved guys in the league"
"Jimmy Butler is beloved for being a ""tough-nosed tough guy"" despite what he did being 10 times worse than Harden lol. Kawhi is overall liked but his haters are clear whilst Paul George is more memed for his playoff failures/quotes than swapping teams and he did it twice."
Jimmy Butler - Out  Too OP
What star forced a trade and didn't get shit on by the public for it? Kawhi still hated by spurs rightfully. Vince still hated by raptors.  Paul George has burnt many bridges.  Jimmy Butler earned a lot of hatred for a bit.
he left Jimmy Butler off his ballot in 2019 during the Minnesota drama for the same reason. he's consistent in his logic at least.
Jimmy Butler might not make it but he deserves to make it
You dropped 2 games to Jimmy Butler and rookies
"I'm a Heat fan but Butler is not better than Beal imo. In fact you could place a few players ahead of Butler....Trae Young, John Wall, Middleton, Klay Thompson, I think Bam Adebayo is a better asset than Jimmy...Butler can't shoot 3s, but wins when it counts though. It was the team of the Heat that brought them to the finals. Not just Butler."

Jimmy Butler scored 12 points in Game 6 last year.  Does that override everything else he did?
"Personally I would take PG since he's a better shooter with equivalent defense and hustle (if you consider things like hustle). Jimmy is a better passer for sure though.  There isn't a huge gap in talent at all but I have butler outside the top 10 in the same teir as Dame, Mitchell, and Doncic."
"No order lebron, Kawhi, simmons, Embiid, AD, Paul George, jimmy butler, Giannis, Tatum, brown."
"By far the Wiggins contract, It's not even close. A lot of people here like to Monday morning quarter back after Jimmy left saying they shouldn't have made the trade cause Lavine was obviously good and there was no way they were going to do anything in the playoffs.   They were 1 game out of the 3 seed even though Jimmy missed a quarter of the season. They were a really good team with Butler on it. Lavine was coming off an ACL tear there was no guarantee that he was going to be any good. He is only now 3 years later making any impact toward winning. The Wiggins contract was the main reason that Butler wanted to leave. He didn't like that Andrew ""try every 8th game"" Wiggins was making more money than him."
Embiid (and ex sixer Jimmy Butler) is probably my fav non Blazer tbh
Jimmy Butler won MIP under Thibs
Jimmy 50% 3pt shooter Butler
He missed the layup but DeMarcus cousins closing out hard on Jimmy Butler and his previously 0 3 pointers all season until recently like he‚Äôs Steph curry was hilarious
&gt;If we're just talking recent history it's by far the Jimmy Butler trade.  Wolves were the fucking 4 seed before Butler got hurt  This is some peak nephew hindsight bias
Can Miami trade for another Jimmy Butler? That's obviously their problem not enough butlers
Jimmy Butler is just Westbrook with a whistle
John Wall vs Jimmy Butler like its 2016 again
When do Laker fans bring up our record against Jimmy Butler as if that proves anything about Lebron?
I'm really doubtful this works out. Butler is on a different timeline than the rest of the team.  This team also wouldn't have very much shooting. I think they would have been much better not trading for Jimmy and continuing to build.  They just needed to wait a little longer for Zach to develop.
Pretty sure Embiid was healthy when he got swept by Boston in the first round while Jimmy Butler took his team to 6 games against the Lakers in the finals
Jimmy Butler was better than Embiid last year
If we're just talking recent history it's by far the Jimmy Butler trade.  They sacrificed their young core and picks for a guy that they couldn't retain and when he was healthy only got them an early playoff exit.   If we're talking in franchise history there's just too many to pick.
"If you think Jimmy Butler was fine being paid way less than Andrew Wiggins , I got a bridge to sell you .  Maybe he didnt have a problem with him personally (who would, Andrew is a very nice guy), but he certainly had a problem playing for a team that was giving 25% of their cap to Wiggins .  That is what I recall hearing at the time.  The issues with KAT did seem personal though , on the other hand"
Embiid has been playing like the best player in the league this year. I remember in the offseason I got absolutely shit on for saying he is better than Jimmy Butler lol.
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2856653-report-andrew-wiggins-contract-had-role-in-jimmy-butler-tension-with-t-wolves  Apparently ESPN reported that Jimmy was frustrated that Wiggins had not lived up to the max contract they gave him, and I'm pretty sure he was also pissed that he didn't get offered a max extension from the wolves either."
"Extending Wiggins and then trading away the Markannen pick and Zach Lavine for Jimmy Butler fucked them over.  And then trading up for culver when they could have stayed put and got pj washington, brandon clarke, or tyler herro."
"He said that Jimmy Butler forced his way out of Minnesota because he has ""African-American disease""."
"Did you just name Jimmy Butler, LaMelo, Trae Young, Bradley Beal, and Jerami Grant when talking about MVP?"
Just like he made up his mind he wasn't guarding Jimmy Butler in game 1.
The Wolves really traded this dude for a one year rental of Jimmy Butler
I read this at first as you saying ‚ÄúButler up the refs‚Äù as in Jimmy Butler lmao   I agree though one of these days he‚Äôs gonna get his ass ejected with the complaining
"I would like to think Jimmy Butler. He avoids flopping, but will draw a foul if its needed to win. Knicks game being evidence."
Jimmy Butler was the best thing to happen to them and they fucked it up
And he still was the point guard of the team that had Jimmy Butler for half a year.  Sorry was wrong about top ten offenses other season  but point still stands and philly‚Äôs has had the best bet rating multiple times including his rookie year. Just wild to say he‚Äôs a role player when he‚Äôs been basically the engine of their offense.
And people talk about James Harden and Jimmy Butler getting FTs smh
Ben Simmons has literally never had a top 10 offense outside of the year where the Sixers also had Jimmy Butler. It was only number 8 then as well. The Sixers literally have a below average offense this year
"The best part of his game imo, is the fact that on top of these stats he impacts the game heavily as a floor general/glue guy.   He's in that same mold as Jimmy Butler/Draymond Green when it comes to making an impact beyond the stat sheet"
Insane that he came in a trade for Jimmy butler. That seems like forever ago.
"KAT is still the best of the 3 imo but yeah zach is definitely better than wiggins   also don‚Äôt forget we got jimmy butler in return, which obviously didn‚Äôt work out long term but it‚Äôs not like we got nothing for zach"
"Throw in Giannis in there as the back to back MVP. And to lesser extents, Jimmy Butler and Paul George. SF position at its peak."
Easy to see why Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt like this dude. He seems incredibly soft. Reporter is just speculating.
We looked so bad without butler. Batum beat us without PG and Kwaii üò≠ I love you Jimmy.
Jimmy Butler and the Minnesota Timberwolves 3rd stringers
Jimmy Butler just led his team to the finals while Kyrie's teams have done better without him than with him the past 4 years.
"Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis   Damian Lillard, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo   Then honestly take your pick for the last two spots out of:  Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Zach LaVine, CJ McCollum, Khris Middleton, Trae Young, Myles Turner, Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, DeMar DeRozan, Zion Williamson... etc etc..."
"Butler has made 3 All-NBA teams, most recently last year. Middleton has made none. Playoffs or regular season, I'm taking Jimmy Butler."
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler probably.  But definitely not Doncic lol
"The Heat were missing Jimmy Butler for quite a while. Heat are ranked way higher in the past few games than the Knicks. Heat were also playing g league players for several games this season.  That said, the Knicks foul rate is typically very low but the Heat also have Jimmy and Bam who are better defenders than anyone on the knicks"
It's a straw poll of media members not ESPN employees.

"I honestly don‚Äôt think the Jimmy/Simmons chemistry would work out, they have a lot of overlap in skills and the spacing on that team would be suspect. Butler was bailing out that team in the playoffs but there could be reasons why the team wasn‚Äôt thriving and he needed to go hero. Look at the 6ers thriving now with spacing."
"I think he‚Äôs number 5/5.  You‚Äôll believe what you want to believe but all analytical evidence backs me up. Jaylen Brown is having the same development path of Kawhi and Jimmy Butler but it‚Äôs happening even faster. If Jaylen isn‚Äôt top 5 to you right. Now than you must admit that hell be there 1 day, Shai will simply not be a better scorer and absolutely will be a worse defender. I take JB every fucking day of the week."
How about bubble Jimmy Butler?

*Jimmy Butler stares from the floor ‚Äúthis MFer serious?‚Äù
"Honestly if I was compiling a tier list of great defender it goes like this:   Elite: luka doncic, trae young, Alex Len, Rudy gobert, and AD  Good: jimmy butler, jokic, KP, Bradley Beal.  Bad: LeBron, dort, isiah Thomas, lamelo balls, London balls, and Kyle Korber.   Just my opinion tho."
"I‚Äôm sorry but Bradley Beal isn‚Äôt better at anything than Kyrie, Devin Booker, jimmy butler and KAT are definitely not better then kyrie. Devon Booker bro? Seriously?"
"In the playoffs? Last year off the top of my head Thybulle, OG, and Jimmy Butler"
"Um Jimmy Butler, OG Anuboy, Giannis, Simmons?"
"he still has his bad shooting nights, but I expect his 3pt % to stabilize at 33% by seasons end... at 4+ attempts... so can be better... but fits todays game.  Its his energy, defense and willingness to pass that will help him get a nice contract. Casey needs to show Jackson videos of Jimmy Butler... and ask Josh to do his best to model his game on Jimmy. Jimmy Butler was 24 years old when he started playing well as a defender slasher for Bulls... and Josh is not 24 yet"
[jimmy butler just giving a shout to Peter Griffin ](https://youtu.be/TEZQ2rg-Rlg)
"Without freethrows, Jimmy Butler would be a bonafide scrub"
"In no order:  LeBron, AD, Kawhi, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, Jokic, Doncic, Embiid, Giannis, KD, Harden, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, KAT.   That's 17 players any sane person would take over him just on the basis of being strictly better at basketball. Then when you factor in his questionable mental state I could add on another 15-20 easily. I would say he's around top 30 at best, top 40 at worst."
"I mean Jimmy Butler alone shot more free throws than our entire team in our last matchup, it happens"
it's not like the Sixers thought JRich for Butler was a good deal. it was that Jimmy was going to the Heat no matter what. he did the sign and trade as a courtesy. however it was nice of Heat fans to help us cope by convincing us JRich was Jimmy Lite
"that happened in exactly one series, with Jimmy Butler on the squad"
"That's not a clever thought to have for Porter at the moment then, a pass for a corner 3 is normally out of the equation in that situation, yet again the play ended in a rushed 3 pointer so what do I know.  I just keep recalling the Jimmy Butler layup to tie the game in G7 vs the Raptors, imagine he had stoped at 3 point line, it's just absolutely the wrong thing to do, so Murray does deserve some blame, if not most of it."
"You can say that for a lot of guys tho. Without injuries that Boston team could easily have won at least one with Kyrie, so is he a superstar?   I mean realistically you can build a championship team around like 20 guys. Is Jimmy Butler a superstar?"
"All you need to do is look at which superstars have been traded in the last few years and what they were traded for and ask yourself if Boston could have topped those offers. Look at what Indy traded Paul George for, what Minnesota or Chicago traded Jimmy Butler for, what San Antonio traded Kawhi for, what Houston or OKC traded Chris Paul for.   The Celtics should have *easily* been able to top those trade packages, especially since they had picks that were once highly valued that they could have thrown in (the Kings pick, the Clippers pick and the Grizzlies pick, most notably). They didn't have to trade Tatum and Brown to outbid those other teams for those guys. They also had Kyrie/IT, Horford and Hayward that they could have offered, since they apparently weren't going to be willing to give them another max level contract to keep them.   Instead Boston didn't do anything and just watched as most of those assets crapped out. The max players all just walked in free agency, and the draft picks ended up being much worse than projected and the Celtics had to use them on middling prospects rather than blue chip studs. I can't imagine there's many Boston fans from the last few years who looked at what the future could look like back then who are real happy with how it's currently going. The Celtics seem to be heading in the wrong direction these days, and the clock is ticking on the Jays. If things haven't turned around in the next couple years it's probably just a matter of time before those guys start making trade demands like Kawhi, PG, AD, Butler, etc did when they felt like they were stuck on a team going nowhere."
See: Trading Zach LaVine for Jimmy Butler
" Bron ad giannis embiid jokic dame kd Kyrie harden kawhi luka are all superstars ‚Äî I think the best stars are jimmy butler and Donovan Mitchell , PG, dbook, jaylen brown , cp3 etc Worst stars are Middleton , derozan, draymond etc"
What if the Timberwolves took the Rockets offer for Jimmy Butler  &amp;#x200B;  Rockets would have a big 3 of Butler Paul Harden
What if the Timberwolves would have paid Jimmy Butler instead of Wiggins??
&gt; - Sixers lose to the Heat in 6 in the 1st round  at the hands of a Jimmy Butler game-winning 3pt over Embiid
"Boban and Steve with guest appearances from Jimmy Butler, Anthony Edwards and Klay Thompson."
Wasn‚Äôt Jimmy Butler to the Sixers done as well?
The bubble didn't seem to effect them on the court l last year unlike most other teams. Their team last year seemed full of players who step up in big moments.  Jimmy Butler is good during the regular season and the first 3 quarters of games. That dude in the playoffs and 4th quarter is another animal.   Not a fluke at all. I don't expect them to get to the Finals this year but would much prefer to not play them in the playoffs. They will be a tough out.
I feel like Steven Adams and Jimmy Butler would be a funny duo
"All of us defend the process. It got us Joel and Simmons, 2 all-stars and a great foundation. What we all are generally critical is what came after when Bryan Coangelo tried to singlehandedly sink the entire franchise with bad move after bad move.   From 2016-20, our front office was a mess. We fucked up the fultz pick, we chose Brett Brown over Jimmy Butler, the Tobias max contract was highly questionable, and the Al Horford decision was one of the worst moves we've ever seen."
Literally half the heat roster‚Äî including their best player Jimmy Butler!!!‚Äî was out for an extended period when this conversation started lmao
"Other than the Huskies win, I cannot recall any other win against Chicago Jimmy. Butler making big 3's against the raptors has been a career long trend. And who stole the ball and tied the game right before Kawhi's game winner?"
Jimmy butler maybe? Good but not great. Moves teams a lot. Might not win a ring.
Chris Paul if he doesn‚Äôt get into coaching  Jimmy Butler has a great personality   Danny Green is well spoken and has played with legends  JJ redick has a great podcast and is a funny dude
"I mean, Booker was an all-star last year at 23, when his team was losing.  He's now an all-star again at 24.  In 2018 he was ""snubbed"" for Jimmy Butler and Paul George, two all-nba players.  So, I don't think that Booker fans should have that much of a persecution complex."
If we're excluding freak outcomes (eg. injuries) then 76ers. I really really like Lowry's fit on that Philly team.   He's a more consistent Jimmy Butler and the rest of the core is better than it was 2 years ago.
"Yes.  I hate when people say have you watched X teams to me because except for a few teams the answer will always be yes.  I'm also speaking from a theoretical playoff scenario because we all know the post season is different and outside of Mitchell and Conley, I don't think you cab reasonably expect much creation from your players.  Plus Conley is small so certain matchups may force him to struggle.  It's just a different animal with a heavy scheme based offense that relies on a majority screen action and swing based system to generate reliable open shots in the playoffs against iso heavy squads.  Miami was the only team is recent history without a top 10 player to make the finals and even than Jimmy Butler played at that level and proved he could be that iso scorer.  I have faith in Mitchell but he's also on the smaller end of the spectrum for those iso scorers and he's no Steph Curry."

Jimmy. Butler.
What about Jimmy Butler who was the best player on that team?
"In no particular order.   1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. James Harden   5. Giannis   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Luka Doncic   8. Stephen Curry   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   11. Paul George   12. Kyrie Irving   13. Jimmy Butler   14. Jayson Tatum   15. Trae Young  16. Anthony Davis   17. KAT   18. Rudy Gobert   19. Zach Lavine   20. Bradley Beal   21. CJ Mccollum   22. Chris Paul   23. Donovan Mitchell   24. Domantas Sabonis   Those are 24 guys that are better. I think Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton and some others are better too but that‚Äôs an opinion."
Yeah With Jimmy butler on the team. Sixers aren't the same team
"Based on last playoffs Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell are the best guards since Michael Jordan, Jimmy Butler is on LeBron's level and Anthony Davis is the best mid range shooter in the history of the league by a wide margin. I think we can safely say none of those are true and the bubble inflated offensive performance."
&gt; still somehow got taken to 6  Did you watch? Jimmy Butler played like prime Jordan in Game 5. It was amazing. Don't diminish it.
Sabonis or Jimmy Butler both deserve it over Tatum
Jimmy butler &gt; Jayson Tatum. And last year proved it.
JIMMY G BUCKETS!!! THE G STANDS FOR GETS!  It feels like almost 2 years since he has knocked down 3s and jumpers as consistently as he did tonight. Philadelphia really is the place where your shooting just sucks ass. I hope Butler can be a better shooter for the rest of the season like tonight.
Jayson Tatum &gt; Jimmy Butler   Jaylen Brown &gt; Bam Adebayo    Checks out
Jimmy Butler is the greatest player of all time when he plays the Raptors.
I can now return to loving Jimmy Butler in peace.
Jimmy Butler will make an All-NBA team. I feel it in my bones
"And just like that, the playoffs are back within reach big baby. Y‚Äôall were talking all that shit about the ‚Äúbubble heat‚Äù and the ‚Äòoverrated‚Äô Jimmy Butler. Y‚Äôall snubbed my boy Bam. No one cares that we got fucked by covid. Cucked by injuries. Now we‚Äôre slowly healing and getting back into finals shape. The whole ‚Äúbubble making bad teams play good‚Äù argument kind of goes to shit when we start actually playing good again. It never even applied to the West yet somehow no one could fathom the Heat made it to the finals so they had to talk shit like we didn‚Äôt deserve it. Y‚Äôall forget we took more games off the Lakers than any other team WHILE MISSING PLAYERS AND BAM BEING INJURED. YALL FORGET JIMBO WENT NUCLEAR AND GAVE US A MASTERPIECE OF A FINALS PERFORMANCE???? WE BACK BABY #HEATCULTURE IS BACK ON THE MENU"
"i'm gonna sue Jimmy butler. i don't what for yet but i'll figure it out. this man belongs in prison, he cannot be allowed to live out his days as a free man in a civilized society."
"I love Jimmy Butler, man."
"Jimmy Butler and Andre Iguodala shooting 16% and 32% on 3's coming in, go 3-4 and 4-5 tonight. Also we need a fucking center. GG"
"Jimmy ""not an allstar"" Butler."
"Man every time we get it within 1 possession jimmy butler says ""no"". Great game though!"
Jimmy Butler over Vucevic. Dude helped his team get a Finals appearance.
Jimmy butler if he leaves the heat and is still all star level he'd have 5
The Lakers blasted everyone. It took an all time finals game from Jimmy Butler to make the series not the Lakers winning all 4 series in 5 games. Hard to hold Harden accountable for losing to a better team.
"To be fair, if Jimmy Butler had sat the game out (instead of playing 0 minutes), I think they would have selected Lou as a replacement."
"That's fair, I would have to go back and check the guys' stats. I think back then was more controversy about Jimmy Butler getting a spot even though he didn't play and Lou could've gotten his spot instead iirc"
"C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid  PF: LeBron James / Giannis   SF: Kawhi Leonard / Kevin Durant  SG: Luka Donƒçiƒá  / Bradley Beal  PG: Steph Curry / Trae Young  6: Damian Lillard / Nikola Vucevic  7: DeMar DeRozan / Jaylen Brown  8: Christian Wood / Kyle Lowry  9: SGA / Zach LaVine  10: Chris Paul / Sexton  11: Donovan Mitchell / Jerami Grant   12: De'Aaron Fox / Sabonis  13: Zion Williamson / Randle  14: Ja Morant / Jimmy Butler  15: KAT / Hayward  &amp;#x200B;  All things considered it's not a horrible idea, each team has an All Star caliber player on it's roster, but the problem is injuries and all star players underperforming . Like in Miami's case, Butler is their clear cut all star but he's missed games, does Tyler Herro become their representative? Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more. Then you start having All Star nods becoming meaningless as guys like Herro would have All Star nods over James Harden."
Jimmy butler is the only reason we r relevant if we‚Äôre honest
I like Jimmy Butler.
"Lol yep, I did. I read ""anti-locker room cancer"", as like, a cancer that is anti-locker room. So, like Jimmy Butler. Oops."
"The last time Jimmy Butler got traded (not a sign and trade), the Nuggets didn‚Äôt make the playoffs yet."
"Jimmy Butler got traded, Paul George got traded twice, Mike Conley got dealt. There's been plenty of big names that they had the salary and assets to get and would fill a need but they didn't. Obviously we have incomplete info, but I don't think saying ""who should they get"" is really ever fair today.   Also, look how easily the Sixers improved this year by minor roster changes (plus obviously Embiid going nuts but I think their improved spacing has really helped).  The Nuggets rolled back a worse roster than last year when they were a few games away from the finals last year. I feel like its fair to question that."
This is one of the dumbest comments I‚Äôve ever seen. In what way is jimmy butler overrated this season when he‚Äôs not even talked about and the heat are significantly better with him
"This will be unpopular, so playing a bit of devil's advocate here more than ""complaining.""  All the guys that got in are deserving.  I know this sub prefers ""new"" all-stars that have been putting in work for years, especially those that have been ignored because they play on bad teams.  Deservingly so.  There was bubbling frustration over Lillard for years, then Beal, and last season Booker.  Lavine is the guy this year.  His campaign was extremely popular, especially by those that love raw stats.  That being said, I wouldn't lose sleep over Butler getting in ahead of him.  I know Butler has missed a lot of time, but I don't want to hold COVID-related absences against him.  Jimmy has only missed a few more games than Kyrie, even though Kyrie put himself in a me-first, self-imposed exile (and nobody has much of an issue with Kyrie getting in).  It bothers me that Lavine's teams are continuously better with him off the court over the last few years (despite fairly weak benches) while Miami is significantly better with Butler.  When it's all said and done, Butler is a better player.  The Heat have won 7 out of their last 10 with him running the show.  Their only losses have been ""good"" losses - to Utah, the Clippers, and in OT against GS.  I think Butler has had plenty of time to show his value and to demonstrate he's an all-star."
Colin Cowherd is that you?   We are months removed from seeing Butler go toe-to-toe with one of the two greatest players the NBA has ever had in the finals and more than holding his ground.  This year Miami is 6 games below .500 w/o Jimmy and a winning team when he plays. He‚Äôs also 4th in the league in assists for a front court player coupled with all NBA defense.   This is a freezing cold take.
"This season it‚Äôs definitely jimmy butler. The majority of his point come from fouls and layups, his defense is great but not all nba, and his playmaking leaves a lot to be desired. I get he‚Äôs injured but come on"
"Jimmy Butler is probably the team captain, guy has nuked locker rooms and thrown his teammates/coaches/etc under the bus literally every team he's played for except the current one... and that's probably only a matter of time."
"Thanks, now I can update my list of All-Star snubs!  DeMar DeRozan  Jordan Clarkson  Mike Conley  Christian Wood  De'Aaron Fox  Clint Capela  Domatas Sabonis  Trae Young  Fred Van Vleet   Devin Booker  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Jamal Murray  Jerami Grant  Bam Adebayo  Jimmy Butler  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  Gordon Hayward  *Russell Westbrook*"
Jimmy ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù Butler
"What about Jimmy Butler? Russ? LeBron? the problem is that you CAN and get away without a tech, if you're the right player."
He was drafted by the timberwolves not the bulls. He ended up on the bulls via the Jimmy butler trade.
Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo are 13 and 15 in BPM. Guess they deserve over the Jays
"All star isn‚Äôt about what he‚Äôs capable of. It‚Äôs about the production to this point of the season.   I‚Äôm a fan of Jimmy Butler. I haven‚Äôt caught too many heat games this season, but from what I have seen he hasn‚Äôt looked great like he did in the bubble. But that was last season.   Chuck said on TNT that his main argument for Butler is that the heat are god awful without him, so he‚Äôs having a big impact. That‚Äôs fair, but I don‚Äôt think he has an argument for getting in over anyone who made it. Maybe randle, but Sabonis should‚Äôve had that spot anyway.  Who cares about an all star anyway? JB will probably catch fire anyway."
Really? He got Jimmy Butler up out of that game though.
"If I had to choose a team to root for it would be the Pacers. They're a small market northern team that lacks star power yet plays hard no matter the competition.  Clippers get an honorable mention because they're always treated as the Lakers little brother and I want them to break that narrative.  But I have a lot more teams I don't want to win.  [WARNING: SALTY TIMBERWOLVES FAN RANT BELOW]  Nets: The latest superteam filled with unlikeable personalities. Except for Dinwiddie, he's cool.  76ers: Still salty about 38-7 so I'm not keen on rooting for any Philadelphia team.  Lakers: There's nothing more boring than a LeBron team winning it all. Also I'm saltier than the Salton Sea about them moving from Minneapolis and keeping the name when SoCal hardly has any lakes.  Bucks: I like Giannis but I hate Wisconsin more.  Blazers: Can Dame and C.J. shut up about Vanterpool? It's none of their dang business and if they like him so much how come they didn't vouch for him to stay in Portland?  Suns: I want the Slam Magazine team in Minnesota not Phoenix.  Warriors: OF COURSE WIGGINS TURNED INTO JIMMY BUTLER THE MOMENT WE TRADED HIM ü§¨   Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
"I really wish Jimmy Butler signed in Dallas his free agency year. He would have been an amazing fit, good defense, good leadership, and can be a secondary ball handler."
Bam adebayo or jimmy butler
Jimmy Butler is lickable
East:  Trae Young  Jimmy Butler  Khris Middleton  Domantas Sabonis  Bam Adebayo  West:  De'Aaron Fox  Devin Booker  DeMar DeRozan  Brandon Ingram   Christian Wood
I like jimmy butler.
"The fact that you think Jimmy Butler should be an all star this year kind of invalidates this whole post.  Since when did the all star game become this garden party where everyone should be invited? It‚Äôs supposed to be the star players, the elite guys."
45% from the field is not a problem what are you talking about.   Jayson Tatum shoots 45%.  Jimmy Butler literally shoots 43%  45% is good.
"JJ Redick covered this in his most recent podcast with Kevin Love.  He said that the wine culture developed when the teams started staying the night in other cities after a game instead of immediately leaving right after the game. This led to the team‚Äôs having dinner and gave them a place to drink wine.  He said Popovich, Lebron James, and Jimmy Butler were the initial guys to really get into wine and start getting the rest of the league into it."
"They definitely deserve it, but to be fair, Jimmy Butler had COVID and only played 19 games lol"
"Okay, I was thinking today. The Wolves fucked up with KD, they are fucking up with KAT, they didn‚Äôt do too well with Kevin Love, they sorta blew it with Jimmy Butler. Why don‚Äôt we blame the wolves for Wiggins being a bum so far in his career?"
Because my dislike for jimmy butler is the defining characteristic of my life
Jimmy Butler is likable
Jimmy Butler is likeable
I've literally never heard anyone describe jimmy butler as likable
"lol I feel like that's why Jimmy Butler is so likable. He doesn't have the best personality compared to like celebrities, but in the NBA he's just one of the few players with any personality lol.  It reminds me of how, if they weren't stars, how awkward Lebron, Dwight, Dwayne Wade and basically every star seem as people lol."
"4 years ago he should have been an all star but was snubed because of ""not enough winning"" and dirks life time achievement appearance. life time achevment all stars are dumb and always have been dumb. Put the actual all stars that season in the game.  3 years ago. Got snubed by having jimmy butler be picked over him dispite playing better than jimmy and jimmy not even playing in the game while healthy.  Last year snubed by a bunch of guys still being told he has to win more. luckly got in on injury replacement.  this year snubed while being the leading scorer on the 4th best team in the league. because.... reasons  Booker should be a legit 4 time all star at this point"
I just wish the Timberwolves didn‚Äôt trade him for a Jimmy Butler rental.
Yes harden scoring 15 times at the free throw line is better for his team lol what is this point. He‚Äôs one of the best scorers in the league undisputed and it doesn‚Äôt matter that he scores so often from the ft line which is why I said who cares about just shooting efficiency.  Jimmy butler just scores at ft line over 60% and he‚Äôs huge for Miami‚Äôs offense too as evidenced by when he‚Äôs out and last years playoffs.  Every impact metrics also points to harden as a top lvl player on offense so yes he is great fkr any team he‚Äôs on.
Hot take: Jimmy Butler balled out last year in the playoffs and should make the All Star team this year because of it.
"If the only criteria is how big of a star they are, Jimmy Butler should've made it! He is a huge star in this league after what he did in the playoffs last season!"
Bro... Jimmy Butler has played in 19 Games
"i see zach lavine on this list, and i see no jimmy butler. clearly math tells us that bulls won the trade baby"
Russ and Jimmy Butler could do this together
"The whole 1 year rental point aside, did we not go for it with the Kyrie trade and the Hayward signing? That didn‚Äôt exactly work out. It‚Äôs not like you can simply trade for a top 5 player every single year and automatically win a chip. If it were that easy every team would go for it every single year.  Also what about the Clippers selling the farm and being a 2nd round exit last year? Or the Rockets going after Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and not making the finals? There are plenty of teams that make trades and it doesn‚Äôt work in the first year, or at all, and if all the Celtics were getting were likely 1 year rentals why would you do that and have to start rebuilding as Tatum is getting around to that start-of-prime-years range?  The reference of the Heat going for it with Jimmy Butler was also kind of strange, since didn‚Äôt Philadelphia do the exact same thing with him and they didn‚Äôt make the finals? It‚Äôs all just painting a picture to fit this narrative.  These media nephews need to chill on the Boston slander and leave that to fans and redditors."
"I heard their preferred plan was to sign Kawhi and Jimmy Butler.  They would have had to move Gallo for cap space but would have kept Shai and all of their draft picks.  Reportedy, Jerry West was blindsided by Butler deciding to go to the Heat which blew up what West had envisioned for the Clips.  The PG trade was really a desperation move to get Kawhi."
"Yeah he should try to take teams to the promised land in the NBA finals.  I know that the roster is not complete for a finals contending team, still need a solid rim protector, a bench unit, and a playmaker.  But even so, guys like Jason Kidd, and Lebron James or even Jimmy Butler has done more with much less or a bit less.     Not saying that Tatum is like those three, but sometimes the best way to bring players into the team is by elevating your game, that's why Brooklyn had attracted the attention of Kyrie, KD and Harden"
"What are talking about? This is one of the first layer taunts from him I‚Äôve seen.   Unnecessarily stealing or shooting the ball at the end of games, ok. Celebrating like crazy off a made shot when down by 20, ok.   I mean, it‚Äôs definitely not like he‚Äôs jimmy butler."
"I have more faith in a Top 15 player ever and a 2x MVP taking his team to the Playoffs, than a Jimmy Butler led Heat team making it who wouldn't trade for a Top 5 player in the league because of ""Culture"". You guys have no real hope on contending, I hope you make it though. The East is way to weak for the ""Defending ECF Champs"" not to make it, lol.  Carry On!"
"It's a good defensive play because Jimmy had a head start on Dort, but Dort managed to catch up and beat Jimmy to the spot. Jimmy was anticipating more contact, which is why it looked like he was trying to draw a foul, but Dort simply just ran past him as soon as there was contact which ended up with Jimmy overcompensating for the shot and shooting the ball over the backboard.  It's really a great hustle play that ended up being a great defensive play. If Dort isn't there, that's an easy 2 for Butler. But this is just my arm chair analysis."
"How is that true?   OKC got Paul George trading Oladipo and Sabonis. We‚Äôre they not young?   What about Cousins being traded for a Hield based package   Hell Jimmy Butler was traded for 2 role players and the 76ers had him walk and they are still better than the Celtics. Only reason why they lost was because they actually had an injury to a star player preventing him from playing.  But yeah the Celtics have Langford, Edwards, and all the other 1st round picks they drafted in the last 5 years outside of the lotto that didn‚Äôt pan into anything."
"&gt; And then to go from winning ten games in a year to back to back 50+ win seasons should further prove that.  oh yes such merit bringing a team with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler to 50 wins.   Brett is a good guy but he was essentially a nanny, had 0 accountability established as said by JJ Redick, Jimmy Butler and others sixers and held back players like Simmons and Embiid from developing by being more a babysitter than a coach  And the thing many forget: he had a hand in creating the abomination that was the sixers 19/20 roster and didnt want to play Horford off the bench until it was extremely late in the season  He's so bad that literally no team wanted to sign him after so many seasons with the Sixers"
"Thunder got in a way better situation by trading for Paul George.   Raptors got in a way better situation by trading for Kawhi  Rockets became a contender trading for CP3 (and the Suns are looking like a fringe contender trading for him).   Even the 76ers became a contender trading for Jimmy Butler, Butler left in free agency (in a sign and trade) and the 76ers are still better than the Celtics.    You can say ‚Äúthey all would leave us‚Äù but there is a chance they don‚Äôt leave you, and all the teams that made big trades and lost their guys are in better situations for trading for those players."
"So let's walk through those guys:  Kawhi would have commanded *at least* Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  Anthony Davis would have commanded Jayson Tatum, probably Jaylen Brown and multiple firsts. You think the Celtics should've done that deal?  James Harden would have commanded Tatum or Brown and multiple firsts, and he was actively sabotaging a team he didn't want to be on.  Russell Westbrook is not a player the Celtics should have traded for under any circumstances.  Jimmy Butler would have commanded at least Jaylen Brown, and he ditched a contender for Miami. You think the Celtics should've made that trade?  Chris Paul I agree with but the Celtics would've needed to include Brown and Smart for salary matching purposes, and no one in the league thought he'd be a positive asset.  The Celtics were objectively right in hindsight not to trade for Cousins.  &gt;The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  In that series when Hayward was out with injury and Kemba played only 3 games after coming back from a knee injury? Yeah, it's telling, just not the way you think."
"You can say ‚ÄúKeep in mind‚Äù but the team that traded for Kawhi won a ring the year they traded for him, and the team that traded for AD won a ring the year they traded for him. Paul George also re-signed in OKC so his ‚ÄúLA or bust‚Äù thing wasn‚Äôt even true.   However here are some notable players that were traded in recent years;  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Jimmy Butler (twice)   Chris Paul (3 times)  DeMarcus Cousins  With a few of those players being traded for notably less than the value people expected. Like it is sweet that the Celtics managed to make a consistently good team, but when you make an ECF and are swimming in future picks it makes sense to try and make upgrades instead of consistently drafting 3-4 rookies a year with the majority not having room to fit in the roster.   Like in 2019 the Celtics added rookies Tremont Waters, Romeo Langford, Carsen Edwards, Javonte Green, Grant Williams, Tacko Fall, Vincent Poirier.  The fact that the Raptors are currently ahead of Boston in the standings and went game 7 against them after they lost Kawhi is pretty telling as well.  I don‚Äôt really care for the excuses, Boston just hasn‚Äôt been able to pull the trigger to actually make them contenders."
"Lol what? Butler‚Äôs shot was completely broken last season. Giannis should have been guarding him. Middleton is average at best (Matthews was actually guarding Butler btw).  &gt;It really would not have made sense to put Giannis on Jimmy, drawing Giannis away from the paint where he is most impactful as a defender and rebounder.  Lolololol"
"Jimmy Butler, he shouldn‚Äôt win but he should be top 5"
"Also there's a reason why he was a an all star starter this year, of course given injuries.  Players that have for sure played better than Zion this season:  Lebron, Embiid, Jokic, Curry, AD, KD, Harden, Kyrie, Damian, Kawhi, PG, Giannis, Gobert, Lavine, Beal, Jimmy Butler, Luka  Players around the same level as Zion who could be equal, slightly above, or below:  Tatum, Brown, CP3, Booker, Young, Randle, KAT, Murray, Mitchell   If you account for injuries and take out players who have missed out on a decent amount of playing time, top 15 wouldn't be out of this world, especially if you go by stats for the season currently. I would have to say he sits much more comfortably in the top 20 at the moment though."
"Typically, perimeter players who have the biggest offensive roles on the team are ‚Äúrested‚Äù on defense by not having to defend the other team‚Äôs star player.   I don‚Äôt thing Giannis it apprehensive about guarding Jimmy Butler.  It‚Äôs just not his assigned role."
LOL Giannis didn¬¥t even fuckin guard Jimmy Butler in the PO  Are you kiddin me?
he is not in the same tier as Jimmy Butler. not even close
Hahaha! Jimmy Butler Ha**d** the Heat back in the Hunt.   That one letter will be what's talked about in the playoffs.
"It's crazy how people just make stuff up and run with it lmao. What logical sense does the second point even make? Jimmy Butler, one of the most hard working and dedicated NBA players in the league rn just stopped shooting 3's to make some obscure point? Yeah super plausible. Literally nothing backs that up either it's just speculation with nothing to suggest it's true"

"Jimmy Butler and Adebayo were monsters last year, he beat the MVP and DPOY Giannis and the 1st seed Bucks in 5 games. They also played great in the finals, taking the eventual champion Lakers to 6 games."
I‚Äôd be happy to let my team lose in the finals to let melo and dame get a ring. I still want the sixers and jimmy butler to one too. Too many good players without rings.
"This probably won‚Äôt ever be put in place, but damn would it be fun to watch. I think that stars would be more inclined to enter the 1v1 tournament if it were in place than a dunk contest because of the head to head competitive nature of it too. I could definitely see a Jimmy Butler, Kobe, or MJ type player signing up and trying to prove that they are the best.   It would be such a fun tournament to watch, and would definitely be the most entertaining attraction of all star weekend in my opinion"
LeBron Jokic Giannis Butler(yeah I fuckin said it)  Harden isn't on my list cause they're just not gonna give it to any of those three on that stacked ass team. And while I put Jimmy on the list right now he's a far 4th place with the other three closer together. I had embiied edging out everyone else before the injury.
"There are roughly 10 teams that could win this year, so your first options are Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Devin Booker, Lebron, Kawhi, and Jokic.  Mitchell is easily the worst of the bunch."
Idk if he‚Äôs top 5 rn but is Jimmy Butler even worth considering? I mean look at how this team has turned around since he came back..
I‚Äôm not a Heat fan but I‚Äôd think Jimmy Butler fits the ‚Äúheart and soul‚Äù type of player more?
Jimmy Butler.  His impact on this team is unreal.
"Dame, Dort, Jimmy Butler, Roco, Nurkic"
"That's how I felt about Jimmy Butler and Joakim Noah when LeBron was here. Hated playing against them, but I knew if they were on the Heat I would love them."
"He's not better than Beal or Tatum, and he's not better than Jimmy Butler or Simmons either. Yet. That pushes him out of top 16. Then there's players like Booker, Gobert, Bam, George, Shai, KAT, Lavine, Murray...He might be better than some of them, but not all of them. At the very least there's an argument to be made. That would push him out of top 20. For now."
He needs a 3&amp;D wing like Jimmy Butler or Paul George as his running mate. CJ is great but he‚Äôs not a true #2 imo.
I'd want a Jimmy Butler type dude to be his co-star and then the usual 3&amp;D guys plus a rim rolling big
Not true at all Butler said that Ben was annoyed the ball got taken out of his hands during the Raptors series and Jimmy understood.  Jimmy said if he was Ben he would‚Äôve felt the same way as well.  The root cause of all of that was Brett being tactically unaware.
"Watch the Heat, their entire team is good. That's their deal, let's not force a square peg into the hole just because we have a tendency to over attribute team success to one person. Jimmy Butler winning MVP over LeBron, Embiid, Harden, Giannis, Jokic, etc would be an embarrassment."
"Jimmy Butler becoming the best player in the league is a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."
"Yeah. They‚Äôre a big problem for the Bucks, and Philly hasn‚Äôt proved anything in the playoffs without Butler.  Miami is being slept on. Spoelstra has empowered Jimmy to be one of the best players in the league. Bam is rock solid. They got shooters, and if the game is on the line, they can go to Iguodala for three."
Jimmy Butler got some nice skin.
"Come on now, we both know Khris and Tobias are literally the same player, and Tobias was the 4th best player on that 2019 team and Khris was the 2nd best for Milwaukee. Giannis has never played with anybody as good as Jimmy butler or Ben. If you say you prefer Embiid‚Äôs play style and theoretically it should translate better to the playoffs fine. But to say he‚Äôs definitely a better player in the playoffs is just untrue."
"People care way too much about efficiency. At a certain point the efficiency doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is if you can find other ways to win games when shots aren‚Äôt falling.   Offensive rebounding, turning the other team over, and getting to the free throw line are all ways a team can negate poor shooting performances. And there are more obviously, these are just a few big ones.   Jimmy Butler is one great example of this, and his numbers are kind of representative of the Miami Heat as a whole as well. Jimmy Bucket‚Äôs .467/.209/.849 aren‚Äôt exactly eye-popping numbers, but he does a lot of other shit to win games so who cares if his three point percentage is below average?   Average efficiency is such a small piece of the overall puzzle, and players and teams have shown every single season that they can win games by doing things other than making threes at a higher percentage than someone else."
"Yeah it‚Äôs been wild to witness it.  I‚Äôve seen people latch onto someone new every week in hopes Lebron doesn‚Äôt win MVP.  Embiid, Jokic, Curry, Lillard, Durant, Kawhi, George, Giannis, Harden, etc.  Started seeing some push for Jimmy Butler recently lol.  It‚Äôs classic."
The article: Detailing how well and uniquely Jimmy Butler has played this year. Mentions the word 'MVP' only once in the second to last paragraph  The headline: Slightly attention-grabby bait  The comments: Arguing against what they imagine the article is saying
so Jimmy Butler is the problem?
Jimmy butler and demar derozan. Their game puts me to sleep
"We are also a worse team. Replaced Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick for Danny Green and Seth Curry. Not as bad as losing Kawhi though, obviously"
Jimmy Butler
I swear Jimmy Butler looks like a role player offensively until he‚Äôs playing against your team; then he‚Äôs an MVP type player.
Jimmy Butler. He‚Äôs not a very flashy player or a good shooter. He also shoots a shit ton of free throws.
I just said I'd take out Butler? And I say that with Jimmy Butler being my favourite player in the League.
"I don‚Äôt like watching Jimmy Butler. Endless Free Throws, can‚Äôt shoot well, and only really tries at the end of games/marquee matchups now."
"The future champion raptors were only the future champions because they faced injury riddled  teams.  The nuggets have also been dealing with injury issues, and poor coaching. Malone was the sole reason we went down 3-1 to the jazz. Don‚Äôt see me making excuses because jokic is good enough to overcome all that unlike embiid. Embiid had jimmy butler who carried a team to the finals on his back."
Jimmy Butler
"76ers had: Ben Simmoms (6'10), Jimmy Butler (6'7), Tobias Harris (6'8), Al Hordford (6'9), Joel Embiid (7'1)"
"If the Heat rely on having Jimmy Butler to be any good, it is completely fair to question how good the team is. Lots of people make stupid comments here. You scroll the posts on this sub and there are like 4 different posts about any current topic saying the same shit within a few hours of each other.  Are the Heat good? Yes. Why should anyone suddenly need to act like they are finals bound with Butler back and a good stretch of games?  Not to mention, the idea that the shutdown and bubble had no effect on the playoffs is ridiculous. That's some typical r/nba shit"
"I mean I think Bam, Herro, Nunn, Iggy, Duncan, Precious and a pick would do it. But why would KAT want to come to a team of Jimmy and scrubs, and why would the Heat think Butler + KAT and scrubs would be good enough to win the title?"
Jimmy Butler and KAT... no thats dumb
i‚Äôm jimmy butler and i say no
"&gt;because who the hell is casually dropping this word?  ...lots of people. This is a pretty common usage of this word, which itself is relatively common.  It's fine if you didn't know the word, but it's one that most people with a high school education have heard and understand, and a guy like Jimmy Butler, who has a communications degree, should definitely know what it means."
"""Coalesce"" is pretty common language.  Jimmy Butler has a college degree in communications. He should know what that word means."
"There are little to no players in a lot of sports who dont grow up with trainers, play in top leagues, have best equiptment etc..guys with money have taken over. Very few DeShaun Watson,Jimmy Butler Lebron type of dudes in the leagues. But the whole soccer issue in America thing played into it i think.A pay to play issue for many."
"I look at it similarly, but I like some of them for their personality. Like Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler seem like genuinly good dudes - not that all the rest aren't, but I really like them and few others"
"Damn, Jimmy Butler really isn't the smartest tool in the shed..."
"1. Jokic, 2. Jimmy Butler, 3. Klay Thompson"
And Jimmy Butler taught us a new word.
Jimmy Butler is routinely near the top of RPM boards for a reason he's among the the top impact players of this era. Some guy's dominance is not always shown in the stat sheet. Kyle Lowry is like this as well
"Jimmy Butler is incredibly unique as a superstar. He is at least above average in every facet of the game, extremely consistent due to his high motor, and one of the most unselfish superstars in the history of the league in terms of the role he‚Äôs willing to play on the court. There aren‚Äôt many other players who are also capable of dropping 40 points essentially on demand but also willing to have a night with no major role in the offense and put all of their energy into defense and hustle plays if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to secure the win."
TIL: Jimmy Butler didn't take English class in High School
"I‚Äôm talkin bout my man Jimmy Butler,  Put the whoopin on the Cavs they some busters  Lebron I ain‚Äôt gon lie you‚Äôs a baller...  But Jimmy Butler is your father!!!  Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Lebron hope you‚Äôre having fun Happy Father‚Äôs Day Lebron, cuz you‚Äôre Jimmy‚Äôs son"
"Jimmy Butler after the reporter used the command ""coalesce"": ""Don't do that. Come on now. What the hell does that mean? You said a non MS-Access function"" Reporter: ""It means 'iif(A is null,B,A)'"" Jimmy: ""You could have just wrote it like that."""
It‚Äôs dumb to call a player not doing something they are supposed to choking. Should we call Jimmy butler a choker for not averaging 30/10/10 with elite defense against the lakers? No. But if he averaged 12/4/4 that would be choking
Jimmy butler is a fucking G man. That year Kawaii was a free agent everyone was clamoring for him and I‚Äôm like naw man give me some Jimmy Buckets.
"Jimmy Butler is a strange player in that he has one of the largest impacts on the performance of his team of any player in the league, but his numbers on the stat sheet do not begin to exemplify those effects.  23, 8, and 9 is great, but does not look like the numbers put up by other great players. Very few of those elite players can sway the performance of a team the way Butler does though."
It was for his roster management decisions primarily .  The last straw was him refusing to trade Jimmy butler
"Damian Lillard - he‚Äôs just so fun to watch and it‚Äôs hard not to like his personality. Feel like the only people who hate him are OKC fans  Jimmy Butler - he has the personality of all the great pistons players, would fit right in with the bad boys or going to work piston. Of all players in the league he‚Äôs who ive wanted on my team for years.  Carmelo - he shoulda been a piston from the start. I want him to get a ring so bad. The way he scores is always fun to watch and I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs had this resurgence in Portland after, wrongly, being blamed for how Houston and OKC performed when he was there.  Honorable mention - Cp3. Same with Melo in needing a ring. He instantly elevates any team he‚Äôs on, just a point god"
bUt JiMmY bUtLeR fOr MvP
"Jimmy Butler, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Joakim Noah."
"I still don‚Äôt get why they drafted Fultz after he missed every shot during his workout. Should have swerved hard and taken Tatum.  Booker is less realistic of a timeline change.   Even if you don‚Äôt change any draft picks, if you just prevent them from their stupid trades, they could probably have a Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Mikal Bridges, and Joel Embiid starting lineup."
Okay I somewhat understand someone asking about jimmy butler earlier. But this
"Dame, Giannis, Jimmy Butler"
1. Steph Curry 2. Giannis 3. Jimmy Butler
"I think most people consider a superstar a top 20 player.  Like Dame isn't top 6 but he's clearly a superstar, as is Jimmy Butler."
I think he‚Äôs offence is superstar level but his defence and playmaking are a tier below so in my opinion he‚Äôs just outside the superstar level with guys like Jimmy Butler and Luka Doncic
"I think it all just depends how you define a ""superstar"". I've seen many many Heat fans swear up and down Jimmy Butler is a superstar."
Jimmy Butler confirmed not a Moira main
"Jimmy Butler has only played for teams that I fucking hate, which sucks because he is pretty much every thing that I admire in an athlete and I fucking love the dude. This isn‚Äôt the best post to say that but I feel like I‚Äôve finally put it into words. There‚Äôs maybe a list of ~5 players I‚Äôve seen in my 26 years of life in the NBA that I respect so fucking much for their drive that I love them regardless of their team. Jimmy, Kobe and Westbrook are there for sure. Dame too.  Just a cool ass dude on top of being a psycho on the court"
&gt;-jimmy butler  &gt;-hassan whiteside if he‚Äôd stayed in miami on his deal   ...i really don‚Äôt know man
"Sure, how bout another way of looking at it - butler has never made the second round as the teams lone all star. I hate talkin bad abt Jimmy, but jimmy fans cannot praise him without shitting on at least 2-3 other all stars in the same sentence"
I mean...when the heat played the Nets Butler was out and it was just Bam. I‚Äôm not guaranteeing anything but if jimmy can take Lebron and AD to six games in the finals i think I wouldn‚Äôt rule anything out.   Also the heat beat the Jazz and the Lakers this season.
"Another way of looking at it is ""KAT only made the playoffs as Butler's sidekick, and proved time and time again that he doesn't have what it takes to take his team beyond the regular season when he's top dog"".  Meanwhile, Butler made the playoffs with the Bulls, Sixers and Heat, and except for his time with the Sixers, he was the best player and the one who pushed the team forwards. He even did that in the playoffs for Philly.  I think it's clear some players have the attitude to be winners, and others don't. Jimmy Butler does."
‚ÄúJimmy Butler would never want to play with a lazy chump like Harden‚Äù  I would think that you‚Äôd want the most talented guys
"""First of all, I'm here to get buckets, not read a fucking dictionary. Can you say spell Jimmy Buckets""  probably Jimmy Butler"
The party is coalescing around Jimmy Butler
They had KAT and wiggins when they made the playoffs. All you‚Äôve proved here is butler is better than Rubio. Again not knocking jimmy man is a monster
Alleged Jimmy Butler 4 MVPs touts gotta be the straw-iest strawman of all time.
"This kind of thing is why I rate Jimmy Butler above players like KAT or Wiggins. They may be very talented, but they can't put their teams on their shoulders and carry it. KAT hasn't achieved shit as the top dog and Wiggins is just now playing well, but that's in a locker room where he's nothing compared to Steph, Draymond or Klay. I can't see either of them doing what Butler did with Miami."
"Unless any of the candidates go off I can't see any of them as the surefire MVP  We had like 12 this season, the following players imo qualify or are at least honorable mentions, no order   James Harden  Kevin Durant (Nets success without him hurts his case allot more then everyone else tho)   LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  Steph Curry  Damian Lillard  Jimmy Butler  Joel Embiid   Giannis Antete-pretend-I-spelled-it-right-kumpo  Kawhi Leonard  Chris Paul  Luka Doncic  With all due respect Gobert ain't cut it, the Jazz are a 2014 spurs clone to me, as in the whole team is good, just that Mitchell is inconsistent as fuck"
"It's obviously Jimmy Butler, and the answer is an easy no"
"If the nuggets don't get a top 3 seed he won't win MVP  With Embiid injured, the only one option that seems realistic to the media is LeBron as he's averaging 25.6ppg/7.9trb/7.8ast on 51/36/69 splits and has the narrative of carrying the non AD Lakers  While stat wise it would obviously be Curry, Jokic, hell, even Dame or Jimmy Butler, media gonna media after not giving him an MVP for 8 years"
"That's some anti-intellectualism right there. I really like Jimmy Butler, but I hate when someone criticizes someone for having an expanded vocabulary. I get it can sound condescending at times, but in this case, it's not. This guy can't predict what words Butler does and doesn't know."
Jimmy Butler tho lol
"Jesus F, now I mean no disrespect to jimmy butler, but dragging and carrying seems like way too strong language. Be honest, would the wolves have made the playoffs without Towns? Would Miami have made the finals without adebayo dragic and their nice ass depth? Would philly get to 7 with the raptors without embiid?   Butler has made every team he went to better than it used to be, and left each team worse than when they had him. It doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs solely responsible for any success that team has"
"&gt; Also, I'd love to know the social circles of the people who claim that coalescing is an everyday word.  Who's even saying it's an everyday word in here? All I see is people saying that it's not an uncommon word, which is true. There's a giant gap between ""a word we all use everyday"" and ""a word a 30 year old would have heard numerous times in his life and should probably know what it means"".  Jimmy Butler probably knows the meanings of shit loads of words that are less commonly used than coalesce."
I don‚Äôt think the Jimmy Butler-Harden duo would‚Äôve worked personality wise.
Let me know when Jimmy Butler wins 2 Finals MVP‚Äôs and actually beats Kawhi in a playoff series (Kawhi torched him in 2019)
"Here I am thinking this is a funny, likable Jimmy Butler media moment, and then the comment section is all about literacy and the American education system. Sure, I know what ""coalesce"" means, but I don't play 72 basketball games a year and spent the rest of my time working out and practicing for them. I think it's perfectly fine Jimmy doesn't know the word."
"So, I am guessing Jimmy Butler hasn't worked with RDD's/Dataframes in Apache Spark much?"
Because it was a very popular opinion back then that giannis deserved it over harden now all the sudden people are going crazy over jimmy‚Äôs story even though it‚Äôs the exact same. As much as i love the story and would happily have jimmy win id be also mad at the fact that the nba rewards butler for doing the same thing harden did but slightly worse
"[Esoteric....] (https://youtu.be/UmV2fYKQ2XE)  FleurDealoon, Jimmy Butler is not a food."
Jimmy 'keeping it real' Butler
"No, but not far off from being a Hall of Famer a couple more all NBA teams could do it, and it's Jimmy Butler lol"
"Not yet imo. Idk who they are but a few more all-star selections, maybe 1-2 All-NBA‚Äôs with more playoff runs I think they get in  Edit: It‚Äôs Jimmy Butler and I still stand by the statement"
Are Jimmy Butler and Jared Butler related?
"I think because Kawhi left basically the perfect situation in Toronto to go home to LA, but I don't totally disagree with you. The Clippers would have to underwhelm massively to make him go through with it and I think Miami would be the favorite in that case because of Jimmy Butler and the fit being so perfect. Another thing is if Paul George's injuries continue to affect his play"
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy butler
Lul zero rings and sub 35 wins every year. Jimmy Butler carried your bum ass franchise to the playoffs once and your bum ass team couldn't do shit since them lmaooo. Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green left and the season after was still more successful than all but one of your shit team's years.
Jimmy Butler belongs on this list too.
"No way Miami let‚Äôs him walk. He has a small cap hold, so even if they want to mix it up in free agency they can sign a big name and then go over the cap to bring Duncan back.   He‚Äôs a perfect fit next to Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo on offense. It wouldn‚Äôt be smart to let him go."
I'll get behind this. As though Jimmy Butler going off on him slowly is turning him into Jimmy Butler.
"My point is that the NBA added this rule purely to make it easier to get to the rim. This is part of the reason why no one shoots midrange J's anymore in the NBA...the paint is open half the time, they don't call travels, so why pull up if I can just barrel into the paint and either draw a foul or get a 60%+ shot? If teams were allowed more freedom to position themselves on defense, teams would have to take tougher shots on offense, which would reward more skilled players. This means some less skilled NBA players can get by with bad fundamentals but elite athleticism. This gets exposed when these players play outside of the NBA rule environment. As a fan of basketball, I think it's silly to put a restriction on where the defense is allowed to stand, purely to make it easier for the offense to get layups.  ""Build a wall"" With Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler (two of the best tough defenders in the world) can hold Giannis to 24ppg in an NBA series. There's a big difference between that result and what would happen under FIBA rules. Way less talented, smaller, and less athletic players used the same strategy in FIBA and Giannis barely outscored Nick Calathes.  Fair point on your last paragraph, but I still maintain that the guy who scores the most at the rim AND shoots the highest % is probably the best slasher under the current rules. The guys you listed are all guys who have the skill and fundamentals to be great under any set of rules. Young LeBron would have had trouble with FIBA rules (See: 2011 Mavs who did a real good job of working around the 3-second rule, but basically played a zone for much of the series)."
KO was mostly playing on the perimeter or cutting to the basket for empty layups. Their style is different. Perimeter players naturally have more seperation between their defenders because of their threat of driving to the rim but when you are going for a layup you have a hand at your face all the time(and they are straight up). Still his wingspan and size is good to finish efficiently but he needs a bit of skill and craftiness. Jimmy Butler is a good example for that I believe.
"&gt;Keep telling yourself that man, go to the lakers sub and not one would rally by your side.   Argument by authority is meaningless, especially when the alleged authority is r/lakers.  &gt;AD and lebron won us a ring and thats all that matters.  That is precisely not all the matters, and this is childishly naive, and borderline stupid.  It is possible to win a ring while losing a trade, and not only has it been done, the Lakers have done it on at least one occasion previously.  You'll be hard-pressed to find even one person on r/lakers who can name that trade, however, unless they search my comment history.  &gt;He was the main recruiter for AD. Dont trade for him? Alryt you are pissing off literally one of best chance we have of even getting a ring.  James was also simultaneously recruiting Jimmy Butler -- who would have been available without that staggering overpayment and whose acquisition still results in a Championship -- and others. That's a serious problem for your alleged logic.  &gt;I'm sure ingram lonzo hart and a pissed off lebron would get us a ring over the clippers and the current nets  And a Davis with a chronic leg injury -- on top of his lengthy list of other injuries -- will?  That same Davis who signed as a free agent in December, which means they gave away all those players and picks to rent him for one season?  Why did the Lakers pay far more to rent Davis for 1 season than Brooklyn did for two seasons of Harden?  Is Davis three times the player Harden is?"
PJ Tucker. Bc he's a badass. Jimmy Butler. Jae Crowder. D fox.
"Yep, you're right, my bad. Last time I had checked he didn't qualify, but looks like he got the game he needed last night.  If the only person better than you on a defensive metric is a barely qualifying Jimmy Butler though, ain't bad."
His handles and strength are subpar. If the defender got into his body he would likely settle for a mid-range. He aint that Jimmy Butler or even Jaylen Brown type of strong slasher.
"I can only imagine how frustrated Jimmy Butler was that this dude got a max over him, and they didn't even want him."

"Lets just say JJ Redick and Seth Curry is a wash. Are you saying if right now you have a choice to choose between Jimmy Butler and Danny Green + George Hill, you will rather have the latter on your team because of better spacing in regular season? Playoff is a different animal and Jimmy left. You'd love to have him back of you can let's be honest here."
"Okay, so if youre waiting for the Warriors to be handed an all star, thats probably not gonna happen.   Trading for stars isn't meant to be some slam dunk thing, they're risky moves by nature.  The Wolves stuck their neck out trading for Jimmy Butler, the Thunder when they traded for Paul George, the Celtics trading for Kyrie , Philly trading for Butler, etc etc"
You replace Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick with Danny Green and Seth Curry and you are better ? Do you really believe this?
Do you think this year's version of 6ers is better than the one in 2019 with prime Jimmy Butler? Coz I don't. I'm gonna take the Bucks
"&gt;thinking they win without the 2nd best player in the playoffs is just a bit absurd.   It's not remotely.  Offensively, Ingram alone replaces almost all of Davis' production, and the team would be by-far the deepest in the league.  &gt; You're overestimating current bron's carrying abilities thinking he wins a title with ingram, lonzo, kuzma etc and I'm high on him.  James has won with less, against better competition.  Who beats James, Ingram, Ball, Kuzma, Zubac plus Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner last year?  And that's assuming the Lakers don't use the pile of assets they burned to rent Davis on other upgrades.  They easily could've afforded Jimmy Butler and/or Malcolm Brogdon -- both of whom were traded for peanuts compared to Davis.  James, Butler, Ball, Ingram, Zubac with Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner wins last year easily. No one in the east could beat Butler + Adebayo, so they sure as hell are not beating Butler + James + Ingram. No in the west came close to the Lakers either, and this team is better.   &gt; Also the lakers were in a sizable playoff slump pre AD.   And will be in one again if he only plays 19 lackluster games per season.  Good thing they traded a decade of assets to rent him for one season, eh?"
"&gt;How can you possible say that with confidence?  Without that trade the Lakers would've still had at least: James, Ingram, Ball, Kuzma, Zubac plus Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner.  James has won with less help, and no one really challenged them last year anyway.  That team likely wins.  Plus, they'd have had the ton of assets they blew on renting Davis to upgrade in other ways.  For just one example, they could've easily afforded the price that Miami paid for Jimmy Butler.  And/or what Indiana paid for Brogdon.  James, Butler, Ball, Ingram, Zubac with Rondo, Hart, Hunter, Howard, McGee, Green, Morris, Wagner wins last year easily.  No one in the east could beat Butler + Adebayo, so they sure as hell are not beating Butler + James + Ingram.  No in the west came close to the Lakers either, and this team is better.  &gt; Lakers were languishing for years before they traded for AD and won a ring and you are saying it wasn't worth it?   They were not languishing after James signed.  They didn't need Davis, and wildly overpaid to rent him for one season.  Yes, that was a mistake.  As a result: they are now completely reliant on two oft-injured players ( which James now is and Davis always has been ), they will have to overpay Schroder this summer, or let him walk, with no means to replace him, and they have no draft picks for years, and James will likely be walking for nothing in 2.  Trading a decade for 1 ring is a good deal if you have none, or a few.  For ring #17, that's a bad deal."
"My hot take : Jimmy Butler.   top 20 player but really is untradeable because : dragging the heat in finals to win 2 games, exemplifies heat culture and his value is especually high as a player for this team. His only downside was his inability to hit 3s"
"You've heard it a million times, but evidently you are unable to absorb just how massive of a flaw that actually is when he's supposed to be their main ball handler. It shows a colossal lack of understanding of good offence. [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deSEDArF-ko) and tell me that his lack of shooting isn't a colossal problem. That's *with* a good ball handler in Jimmy Butler on the team, something that isn't present on this current iteration of the Sixers."
"Okoro keeps steadily getting better. You‚Äôre asking a lot when you‚Äôre asking a 19 yo rookie to defend the opposing teams best player every night. One night it‚Äôs Lebron, the next it‚Äôs Jimmy Butler. It‚Äôs rare a rookie has the mindset to be able to do that and to thrive but Okoro is."
Best part was when Jimmy Butler got blocked to lose the game against the wolves last year and the entire wolves team laughed in his face
"Our championship hopes would be directly tied to the buyout market, and Dragic/Harden/Butler/G league tier PF/Bam might sound scary, but when you realize that they'd also be bringing 3-4 G leaguers off the bench, and probably have a bottom 10 defense because Jimmy and Bam cant carry an entire team of below average defenders by themselves, and suddenly you realize they aren't beating the Lakers, or the Clippers, or the Nets, or the Sixers."
"Jimmy Butler, Gobert, and Pascal are the only players picked in the 25-30 slots in the past 10 year to make an All-Star game."
"I dunno either, I'm not in the locker room nor do I know him personally. The main thing was Butler having an issue though, and Jimmy WAS in the locker room and knows how to win and does leave it all out on the court.   There might be something about KAT that does rub people wrong. Who knows, maybe it turns around for the Wolves soon though and that will disappear as well."
"But who's winning? MJ, Kareem, Bird, Magic and Tim vs Bron, Jimmy Butler, Vucevic, Tyler Herro and THT?"
"Jimmy Butler Bam and....Tyler Herro (?) were better than Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, and Detlef Schrempf? You have to be shitting me.   Let‚Äôs pretend you‚Äôre not and ignore the fact that the heat team was injured.   Regular season:  Heat: 44‚Äì29 (.603) SuperSonics: 64‚Äì18 (.780)  Accolades:  SuperSonics: Payton won DPOTY, was an All Star, All NBA 2nd team, All Defense 1st team, was the steals leader. Detlef was All NBA 3rd team. Shawn Kemp was an All Star and NBA 2nd team.  Heat: Jimmy Butler was All Star and NBA 3rd team. Bam was an All Star and Defense 2nd team.   Competition:  SuperSonics: Swept the reigning champs Houston Rockets, then faced against Utah Jazz with Stockton and Malone in their prime (Who would go onto to the next 2 NBA finals).   Heat: the Milwaukee bucks with reigning MVP Giannis and friends, and then mighty Boston Celtics."
Seriously? Using a top 5 pick on a Jimmy Butler is a bad move?
"I mean look I watch Embiid and I see how he plays. How he takes advantage of his speed advantage and his size advantage. How he uses his strength. Also how so many teams play him. The doubles are constant and that means more turnovers and more fouls. It's high risk high reward but it's better than getting bullied in the post.   I imagine double teaming someone who passes like Jokic isn't the smartest move. Although occasionally people double Ben in the post for some reason so idk maybe it does happen. But my point is Joel plays through a lot of contact. The crazy thing is Sixers fans, and coaches, and Joel himself knows that he gets fouled more than is called. But the refs can't call everything. Or at least choose not to.   Jokic reminds me of Tobias Harris. He drives a lot, shoots a ton of mid-range shots, but rarely goes to the line. Meanwhile Jimmy Butler lives at the line. Harris just avoids contact more than goes through it with strength. And he is shooting an amazing percentage so it's not like he's not doing well getting to his spots and shooting around contests. But he just is never gonna be a guy who goes to the line a bunch.  I watch Jokic games. But not nearly as many as you. But when I do watch him, I don't see him *driving* to the rim and laying it up through contact. I see him shooting jumpers and hook shots in the post. He has amazing touch and skill and uses that to score. I'm sure calls are missed on him, and I'm sure he gets some non-shooting calls as well. The bottom line is he has his own style of play that is working well. He's figured it out. And he is the frontrunner for MVP (and if they get the three seed, it's his) because of it."
"I have no problem being downvoted. The fact that people went out of there way to downvote BECAUSE I expressed support for KAT just rubbed me the wrong way, but that‚Äôs what I get for going against the Jimmy Butler Timberwolves circle jerk.  Sorry I got defensive, my bad man."
2015 Jimmy Butler was one of the highest perimeter defender peaks of all time. Unfortunate that he was competing with Kawhi and Dragon
Lose my shit and proceed to annoy all my friends who watch basketball by making outlandish statements about Jimmy Butler.
"Unfortunately a good  response from a mental health perspective, but every alpha dog would never say this. KAT just seems like he plays basketball to collect a check and has been that way since college. Jimmy Butler was right on Wiggins and KAT."
Y‚Äôall gave a near all star caliber player Superstar level money. Jimmy butler and Lebron getting payed less
"He‚Äôs not over 30, first off.   Secondly, max contracts change year to year, so you can‚Äôt use the actual numbers as comparison. That‚Äôs not how it works.  Anyway...  Chris Paul got a max over 30. Dame Lillard got a **supermax** at 30. Klay Thompson got a max at 30. Kyle Lowry got a max at 30.  If we bump it down to just one year younger...  Westbrook got a **supermax** at 29. John Wall got a **supermax** at 29. Kemba got a max at 29. Steph Curry got a max at 29. Jimmy Butler got a max at 29. Mike Conley got a max at 29.  Should I keep going?"
Not trade Jimmy Butler hoping they would have a core around KAT in 7 years.
"&gt;For most of these teams, the draft is the only option.  Fine, the point is that tanking is exceedingly unlikely to be worthwhile.  &gt;They aren‚Äôt going to get any top tier free agents   Which top-tier free agents did Miami have last year?  Or Toronto?  Or the Texas teams?  Even if you count Jimmy Butler, it's not like he hasn't played in less-appealing locales than Miami, and he just wants to win anyway.  &gt;Even if they don‚Äôt make make the finals, they‚Äôre hoping to just be a good regular season team  And you can absolutely reach that level without tanking."
DeMar is actually the opposite case of what you are suggesting to some degree bscause he doesn‚Äôt get assists at all at the rim for teammates. % of assists that come at the rim is horrible. A ton of his assists come off mid range. The reason why isn‚Äôt hard to gauge this is also try of guys like Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler. You can spot the commonality   In general outside of this year it‚Äôs been the same trend for years with DeRozan. His teams take a lot fewer shots at the rim when he‚Äôs on the court and his teams 3 point rate plummets when he‚Äôs on the court
"Bucks have an interesting trio of talent.  They have 7 foot Westbrook (Giannis), smaller KD (Middleton), and smaller Jimmy Butler (Jrue)"
People who think this is an overpay probably also think Jimmy Butler isn't a superstar.
"Worth it for the Bucks considering all the draft capital they gave up for him, keeps Giannis happy, and Jrue is really good, like smaller Jimmy Butler."
Nah it was a lot more personal than ‚Äújust basketball‚Äù.  People were shitting on him here and praising jimmy butler. I posted a comment in support of KAT and literally got downvoted.
Jimmy Butler has entered the chat
Acting like this sub didn‚Äôt all shit on him for being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù during the whole jimmy Butler fiasco.
"That would be such a timberwolves move.  Trade Ant and Cade for a star, who leaves right away.  Jimmy Butler part 2"
"I would love for KAT to grow, become hard af, and absolutely emasculate Jimmy Butler to bring that circle all the way around"

As Jimmy Butler would say: ‚ÄúWELL DAMN!‚Äù
"It will be a grave mistake if a team overreacts to March Madness and ends up picking Suggs over Green. Suggs ceiling is Jimmy Butler, Green's is much higher."
"I don‚Äôt think Butler is overrated as much as he is just loved as a personality. Lotta people love Jimbo cuz he‚Äôs just a baller in general and tough as nails. I would also argue many people underrate him. I watch him night in and night out... he IS the Heat. Yes, Bam is great, but without Jimmy the Heat are lost. He does everything so well except shoot 3‚Äôs. Where would I rank him? I‚Äôm not sure, but I know I can‚Äôt name more than 9 players I want over Jimmy right now leading the Heat."
"Imagine if they got someone like Jimmy Butler, KAT would respond really well with someone that also values hard work and accountability"
I don't think people realize you are referring to Jimmy butler.
I'm looking forward to Minnesota - Miami on April 16.  As far as I know KAT hasn't faced Jimmy Butler since right after he joined the Sixers. Now that KAT is back healthy and after everything he's been through it seems like he is playing with a vengeance.

"OK since we're just ignoring prime years. Shaq, lebron, Ray Allen, Jimmy butler, Chris bosch.  Shaq and lebron james. That's 2 top 10 players ever right there.  Really comparing dwight, cp3, KD and westbrook all out of their primes to prime lebron james, and Shaq who wade wouldn't have even got to the finals without???"
Probably Jimmy Butler
"Long post incoming:   Wiseman's OBPM on the year is -4.3. His DBPM is -1.3. As a point of reference, Andris Biedrins in his final year with the Warriors had a -4.8 OBPM. Biedrins' TS% that year was 45%. Wiseman's this year is 55%. Despite being a far more efficient finisher, a 33% three point shooter and shooting 30 points better from the free throw line than Biedrins, Wiseman's offensive impact is only marginally better than later career Biedrins. That's um... really bad.  In the Kerr era Steph has only been a part of three two-man combos to play &gt;100 minutes with a negative net rating: Steph/Oubre -1.9, Steph/Varejao -6.6, and Steph/Wiseman -7.4. The ORTG of Steph/Wiseman is 102.8  In Steph's entire career, these are the negative net rating two-man combos he's been in that have received &gt;100 minutes . Steph/Oubre, Steph/Varejao (2015-16), Steph Wiseman, Steph/Festus (2012-13) Steph/Biedrins (2012-13), Steph/Steve Blake, Steph/Jordan Crawford, Steph/Klay (2011-12) , Steph/Biedrins (2011-12), Monta/Steph (2010-11), Steph/Reggie Williams (2010-11), Steph/Lou Admunson (2010-11), Steph/Biedrins (2010-11), Steph/Gadzuric (2010-11), Steph/Carney (2010-11) Steph/Turiaf (2009-10) Steph/Morrow (2009-10), Steph/S-Jax (2009-10), Steph/Chris Hunter (2009-10), Steph/Randolph, Steph/Biedrins (2009-10), Steph/William (2009-10)s, Steph/Maggette (2009-10), Steph/Randmonovic (2009-10), Monta/Steph (2009-10), Steph/Bukie (2009-10), Steph/Mikki Moore (2009-10)  In Steph's ENTIRE CAREER, only six two man-combos have performed worse than Steph/Wiseman:  Monta/Steph -8.0 (2009-10) Steph/Gadzuric -8.8 (2010-11) Steph/Carney -10.5 (2010-11) Curry/Crawford -11.8 (2013-14) Steph/Bukie -14.0 (2009-10) Steph/Mikki Moore -20.8 (2009-10)  You'll notice that three of those two man combos are from when Steph was a rookie and wasn't STEPH F'n CURRY. The other three players Gadzuric, Carney, and Crawford, literally never played another NBA game after their seasons with the Warriors. So in the Kerr era era, Wiseman has had the worst numbers per net rating in a two-man combo with Steph and the only players worse than him played with rookie Steph or did not play in the NBA the season after. From the Kerr era, no two-man combo involving Steph has ever had a worse ORTG than Steph/Wiseman.  What does Wiseman do well, exactly? Finish? Yeah, but he's also 7'1 and in the 99th percentile of human athleticism. He should at the bare minimum, finish well. At this point his jumper is mostly an idea. He's shooting 33% on jumpers this year and only 63% from the free throw line. On the year, Wiseman is shooting 30% from shots in the paint that are not in the restricted area, 29.7% on hook shots, and is shooting 34% from the mid-range. Add that all up and there's a body of evidence that suggests Wiseman doesn't have a natural shooter's touch. Beyond that, his shot selection is really bad. It's still a bit of a mystery as to whether the coaching staff wants Wiseman to post up or he's seeking out those shots himself, but he's a bad post player at this point. Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler punk'd him multiple times last night and he spins himself into trouble and fades on an alarming number of shots.  Wiseman has looked way more comfortable in PNR situations this year and I absolutely believe that he should be running more of those, but his PPP there isn't stellar either. Looney, Paschall, Dray, JTA, and Steph all have a higher PPP than Wiseman does as the roll man, albeit on lower volume (the only one who comes close to matching the frequency of PNR roll man is Paschall)."
"Jimmy butler... the way that this sub loves jimmy, a prime kawhi should have literally been one of the basketball gods"
So Jimmy Butler was right.
"Except once. With Butler they were 3rd or 4th in West around February before Jimmy got injured. He barely got healthy for the playoffs and they lost 4-1 to the 1 seed Rockets that eventually was a Chris Paul injury away from the finals.  No matter what anyone says about Jimmy, KAT or Thibs, that team that year fully healthy was a good team. Sucks that they had given a max slot to Wiggins so they couldn't afford Jimmy, which led to the unfortunate saga we all know."
"This guy refused to listen to Jimmy Butler when Jimmy was there and now all of a sudden, he's all about the wins?"
"I love that he's loyal, but at this point it's almost like Jimmy Butler ""I'm a badass"" mantra, we know dude, no need to say it constantly every month"
"Also I‚Äôm using jimmy butler who you know publicly criticizing the work ethic of Minnesota players,"
So you ready for the Jimmy Butler reality check?
Potential Jimmy butler reunion in Miami. Stephen A Smith woj and the rest of them going to have a field day with the narrative possibilities of that reunion
"jokic, giannis, draymond and jimmy butler, maybe throw embiid as special guest sometimes"
"Didn‚Äôt you play a shitty Portland team, a Houston team with no centers and Jimmy Butler in the finals?"
"They actually alternated throughout the years just like Paul George and Jimmy Butler. Because I remember in 2015, Harden was considered better, then in 2016, Westbrook was considered better, in 2017 they were constantly compared to eachother as equals."

Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler, Jokic maybe"
Jimmy Butler was ABSOLUTELY denied last season by LeBron
"The lakers were taken to 6 by jimmy butler, and a rookie."
I personally want to thank Jimmy Butler for beating us that game. We got Porter in the draft with the last pick in the lottery because of his clutch free throws! Appreciate it!
My bad Jimmy Butler had two games which are all time performances in the finals and you thought he didn't play. Did you watch the series?
Jimmy Butler stole two games in all time fashion off the Lakers. His play was not a problem for the Heat.
&gt;we shut down much more explosive scoring guards than FVV and Lowry  The only perimeter player the Heat had better than either of those 2 guys was Jimmy Butler. And Kawhi is better than Jimmy Butler.
"Eh, when you account for the much larger amount of players (not to mention positions) on an NFL team, I'm sure that overlooking Tom Brady is about on the level of a Jokic, Gibobili, Jimmy Butler, etc.  Also, Brady didn't even start in college. It's actually kind of a wonder that he was drafted at all, despite his now-obvious talent."
Jrue Holiday in 2019. Jimmy Butler in 2018. Both defenses were statistically pretty dang bad and they made it.
"he's missed ~6 games to this point, hardly significant, especially when OP has Jimmy Butler on first team"
"Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo, Bam Adebayo.  No bias btw"
The Jimmy Butler.
The biggest factor is that we turned Jimmy Butler into Roco and Saric
"""First of all, he‚Äôs seven foot.  Wait ‚Ä¶ is it seven feet, or seven foot?   I think it‚Äôs seven foot, because you wouldn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a seven-feeter‚Ä¶.‚Äù  You know what? We‚Äôre just gonna say seven.  KD is seven."" - Jimmy Butler"
"&gt;but we've pretty much seen what Lauri's ceiling is  He's barely older than Jimmy Butler was when he couldn't even start for the Bulls.  For that matter, he's the same age as many rookies used to be, back when they often played four years of college ball.  At 23 years old, you don't know anything about a player's ceiling."

"Jimmy. Not only because I'm a Heat fan. But since the accolades are very similar and Jimmy has shown to be an incredible playoff performer able to carry a team full of undrafted, G-leaguers and rookies to the finals; that says a lot about a player. He also put 2 of the greatest finals performances ever against a strong defensive team with Lebron and AD. I also love players that can play defense, so I go with Butler.   Damian is a hell of a player too, tho. Mad respect to him. I also think that he will be more remembered than Jimmy because of his loyalty to his team and his amazing highlights."
"It's definitely a narrative. Media generally loves underdog stories, look at how much people love talking about Butler as a scrappy low pick who was underappreciated and had the claw his way to the top.  Jokic is that but more, Butler was picked at the end of the first, Jokic was picked in the middle of the second. I love Jimmy but he's never really had an argument for MVP, Jokic does and he's only 25. Second round picks are lucky to develop into serviceable role players, maybe four of them ever have shaped up to be stars (Gasol, Manu, Hornaick, Green) and none of them ever sniffed the MVP award.  Jokic has an amazing, pre-built narrative that gets ignored because he's not marketable."
"In the short term, I think Dame, because he is more popular, but get 10 years out and it would definitely flip Jimmy‚Äôs way.   Jimmy has 2 of the best finals games ever. 2nd and 3rd all time in game score, only behind LeBron. You can‚Äôt talk about greatest finals performances without bringing up Jimmy twice.  Then you have the Kawhi shot. It‚Äôs only been 2 years, but people legitimately think that Kawhi stopped Jimmy from going to the finals with that shot even though it was only in the semi-finals and the Raptors played the Bucks.   Ultimately it‚Äôs close though, and you can‚Äôt hate anyone from saying either of them. Outside of the tier 1 guys, Butler and Lillard have really been some of the most fun tier 2 guys to watch and both have incredible mindsets towards the game."

"Wolves trading LaVine, Dunn and the pick that ended up being Markkanen for 69 games from Jimmy Butler"
"Dame has. 1 more all star than Jimmy (6 to 5) and 2 more All NBA's (5 to 3). Jimmy does have 4 all defensive. teams to his name.    Dame has been the guy for his team for  years while Butler jumped around and wasn't clearly the best player on his team for a while.   That said, Jimmy also was part of a massive set of upsets to get to the finals and beat the MVP+DPOY which is a massive feat and even took the Lakers to 6 this year. I think his playoff resume may be better than Dame's in totality. Going to 7 against the Raptors and playing insane the entire time, making the finals and having some massive performances.    It could go either way depending on what you value"
I take significant issue with how Jimmy butler could be the best player on a team that went to the finals and not be on this list. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
Jimmy butler is a Mormon confirmed
Its a travesty that jimmy butler can get more free throws than your whole team almost every game but Randle and Barrett have to almost die for the ref to think about blowing the whistle
"Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt around for that lol. The Miami v hawks game wasn‚Äôt even one worth harassing other team‚Äôs fans. I would much prefer fellow hawks fans saving the toxicity for Celtics and Knicks fans because they are objectively worse. (I am also bias because Jimmy butler is my guy because he went to Marquette)"
Jimmy Butler. But in all reality Jokic
And then the Battle of New York could be set up for Round 2. And are there any storylines that could be made for Bucks-Sixers? I guess two foreign-born physically-dominant bigs going at it would be enough. Would be better if Embiid won MVP so it would be the last two MVP's facing off. It also would be cool if the Heat beat the Bucks so Jimmy Butler could face his former team.
"There wasnt a team you lost to who wasn't supposed to beat you lol. Lost to Championship Lebron, Godmode Lebron Cavs (that goaltend tho), Celtics with Kyrie/Tatum/Horford, Jimmy Butler Finals Heat. You never had a better team on paper than the teams you played and even In a lot of the sweeps you guys played well. The games were close you just didn't have the star power to win."
"Chris Paul and Harden out, Jimmy Butler in  And ONE of Booker or Mitchell depending how last games shake out (Performance + Standings + GP)"
"Jimmy Butler is averaging 21/7/7 on 60% TS with all-NBA level defense and leading the league in steals per game, while being 7th in PER, and 6th in BPM and win shares.  He's an egregious exclusion here"
"Your claim about Giannis playing far better defense than KD... how do you back up that argument? Because I saw Giannis defending like Duncan Robinson and Andre Iguodola while Jimmy Butler was lighting them up, so his defense wasn't contributing like it should."
There are so many flaws within your argument.  He got injured against the heat and wasn‚Äôt playing enough minutes. Check per 36 for a better result.   When Bud did figure it out giannis had like 20 points in 9 minutes but then got injured which was still enough to out score jimmy butler.   His efficiency is nowhere near considered bad even if it‚Äôs not up to his regular standards but it‚Äôs still not bad.  He was also playing on a bad ankle in the heat series.
"Sadly that game did not count, as Jimmy Butler was not playing. + that was before Nate McSweptInRound1 took over as head coach + the Heat won the game against Atlanta before that even without Butler"
"Jimmy Butler is the last player I've seen that became a top player in the league with that attitude and it shows how big of an impact he has on a team and how much he effects people he's guarding.  I'll look into Stewart though, sounds like my kind of player."
"I honestly don't think Minnesota right now is the best spot for player development and winning culture in general. The whole Jimmy Butler situation I think was a good indicator of that. Obviously the players have to be held somewhat accountable for developing themselves, but you see guys like LaVine and Wiggins who always had ability and just couldn't put it together in Minnesota, and now you see them really blossoming on other teams, which makes you wonder why they couldn't do so with the Wolves. They've always had guys who can score (Wiggins, LaVine, Towns, Beasley, now Edwards), but the questions have always been their ability to do everything else required on the court, and so far I don't think they've ever been fully answered while playing for the Wolves, which I've just always found interesting."
Jimmy Butler
Defense didn't help the heat playing jimmy butler on Friday lmao
"You can make a case for Butler better than Jimmy but the other 3? Hell no.  Lilliard pulled off a huge carry job in the bubble to get the 8th seed, multiple 50+ game with his threat from way deep behind the 3pt line.    Luka is a near triple double machine just last year while scoring 30 in his second season. Has butler ever done that, and is one of the clutchest players in the NBA.  Same with Kyrie, best iso scorer who can take over in a quarter and goes on insane scoring runs to ice the game.   Butler's the better defender but his offensive game is drawing fouls and fadeaway midrange shots, and knockdown 3s but rarely does he ever take over games cause he a team player and would let his shooters take the shots to blow teams out.    Butler doesn't have the gravity of the other 3 players."
"Honestly think he's going to be a monster and one of the elite wing players over the next decade. Like around what Jimmy Butler is now (fringe top 10 player)  I dont think people realize how big he is, like whatever height they listed him doesn't accurately capture his size. Was watching Twolves vs Knicks and seeing him side by side with RJ Barrett who has pretty good size, Ant's frame looked wider and 2x as powerful as RJ .  And when you think about his quickness and vertical to go with it, he's in a similar category as Zion imo as far as freak athletes in the league. It's going to come out more once he works on his handle and refines his game, you won't be able to put a guard on him. Teams are gonna have to defend him with a strong wing or forward."
"Jimmy has always had top 10 advanced stats, but the Pistons team around Billups is also way better than Miami around Butler. Tyler Herro had couple games where he popped off, but he was nowhere near the player Richard Hamilton or Rasheed Wallace were.   Even this season, its showing that all the Miami role players just really aren't that good. Miami has mostly been a two man show between Butler and Bam. Herro has not been good, Robinson's shooting has been a little down compared to last year (he's still been good though). Crowder is gone. Dragic has been hurt and not as good. But Jimmy has still been great (even better than last regular season), and has carried Bulls and Timberwolves to the playoffs before. It wasn't just the bubble.  I don't think he's top 10, but he shouldn't be any lower than 12, maybe 13 considered how well Paul George has played this season."
Jimmy Butler
Tatum and Brown. Jimmy Butler too.
If you rank the Heat best player in every game during the playoffs I'm pretty sure Bam was ahead of Jimmy before the finals when Butler carried hard (with Bam and Dragic compromised)
"Are you fucking kidding me? All I hear about Jimmy Butler is how he's underrated and ""A dog"" and last year people were trying to call him a top *5* player."
"Randle needs to be on there, he's played 60 games so far this season compared to 44 for Jimmy Butler and 41 for LeBron.  Also 24/10/6 is nothing to sneeze at, those are better numbers than Tatum or Butler in a vacuum, plus he's been an iron-man this season.  Having Giannis, Kawhi, LeBron, Zion, Randle and Tatum/Butler/whoever for the last forward spot makes more sense"
Idk bro if Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston got the same respect as Jimmy Butler
"Playoff experience doesn‚Äôt really matter since we‚Äôve seen this Knicks team be flat out better then the Celtics and Heat, as Jimmy Butler said, there is no switch to flip that can immediately turn it around in the playoffs"
Felicio‚Äôs singular talent is dunking off nice alley oop passes from Jimmy Butler. It‚Äôs the type of important skill the best GMs would reward a sizable contract.
"KD, Harden, Westbrook, Giannis, Kyrie, Dwight and Lowry definitely.   Kevin Love, Blake, Jimmy Butler maybe."
"Giannis is a lock, as is Russ. KD and Harden too. Blake Griffin also has a slight chance too. 100% to all of those guys, except Blake, who is probably like a 30% chance.  Embiid isn‚Äôt a HOFer yet, but an MVP or two and/or a title with a FMVP makes him a lock. Even if those things don‚Äôt happen, 5-6 *healthy* seasons around this current level of play probably locks him in. So I don‚Äôt want to say he‚Äôs a lock now, a lot can happen in half a decade, but he‚Äôs on the right trajectory.  Jimmy ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù Butler has a chance too, but he‚Äôs by no means a lock, yet, IMO.   Tatum and Trae both look like hall of famers so far, and they‚Äôre young enough that if they stay healthy they‚Äôll accumulate a ton of stats. Both will be all stars and all-NBA players, which means they‚Äôre both on a hall trajectory as well. I‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre likely to be hall of famers, though there‚Äôs soooo much time before anyone can definitely say either is a lock, but IMO they both have &gt;50% chances imo.  LaMelo is in the same boat as those two, though with even less accolades and more to prove. Though again, I feel like if he develops as rapidly as he has been, he should make the HOF someday. As long as health doesn‚Äôt derail his career he should make it. There are players that are just so transcendent that you can see those savant level plays and flashes as rookies, and LaMelo has plenty of those. He‚Äôs well on his way to becoming a premier player, which in turn is a HOFer, but it‚Äôs still WAY too early to say it definitively, but the question is ‚Äúmost likely going to become a HoFer‚Äù. I‚Äôd say that there‚Äôs less than a 49% chance that injuries derail his career or he just stagnates and never improves at all, which means he has at least a 51% chance, which technically is ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù.  Kevin Love has a sneakier case than you‚Äôd think, and with the relatively low standards of the Basketball Hall, I can see it. That whole Cleveland big 3 kinda deserves it, so then I‚Äôd have to say Kyrie as well. If Kyrie or Love never had great seasons outside of the 2016 title comeback, they‚Äôd still make it, and they both have amazing seasons besides 2016. Both had stupid iconic plays. Love somehow locking down Steph with ‚ÄúThe Stop‚Äù, and Kyrie‚Äôs amazing 3 to put them up for good are both iconic plays, and being the team to take out 73-9 GS in a 3-1 comeback probably gets enough clout to make the hall.  So in order of current likelihood I have 10 guys most likely to make it. In this order:  1A. Durant (100%)  1B. Harden (100%)  1C. Giannis (100%)  1D. Westbrook (100%)  5. Embiid (81%)  6. Kyrie (75%)  7. Tatum (60%)  8. Love (58%)  9. Trae (55%)  10. LaMelo (52%)"
"&gt;The celtics swept them yet the margin was barely 5+ points (not sure exact numbers) because the Pacers could never close anything when it counted.  The Pacers also played that series with the marvelous, stupendous, superstar Bojan Bogdanovic as their primary scorer, with a bunch of role player quality players around him (Sabonis was a bench player). Getting swept in that series without Oladipo shouldn't be surprising. The fact they were even in those games should be lauded, not criticized like this.  Last year, definitely should've put up more fight but this is the same Miami team that slapped the hell of out the Bucks, and the Bucks were quite a lot better than the Pacers. Playoff Jimmy Butler is a scary beast.   The Pacers also distinctly lack a closer. Warren is the closest thing they have, but he isn't anywhere close to the level of cutting it for the playoffs. Injuries or not, the 2019 squad only had Dipo for 36 games and still managed to win 48 games under McMillan led, again, by Bojan Bogdanovic on a squad composed entirely of average starter caliber players (at the time, Sabonis was a bench guy) and very good role players.  This year, they've only been missing Warren for most of it. Turner's hurt now, yeah, but he played 47 of their 60 games. Everyone else has missed sparingly.  Sabonis has progressed massively and Brogdon keeps getting better... yet they're poised to barely scrape into the play-in with a much, much, MUCH better roster (even without Warren) than the 2018-swept squad had. Maybe it's time we accept that the Pacers just aren't as good as we think they are, and McMillan elevated them dramatically."
"Embiid has the skill to be an All time big man, literal mount rushmore of NBA bigs. But so does Jokic, and he's far more durable so I'd rather bet on him than Embiid because the best ability is availability. Making the HOF isn't about putting up huge numbers for a couple years, you have to do it for over a decade before you get HOF consideration and that's really hard when you keep getting hurt.   And counting stats matter for sure, unless you're part of a dynasty you're not making the HOF without stacking up counting stats on your resume. Especially if you're not a consensus top 5 or even top 10 guy in the league like Kyrie and Butler. Jimmy is 31, compare that to what guys like Kawhi and Harden Giannis have accomplished at much younger ages. He has a lot of ground to make up for sure and I don't think he's likely to get there."
"KD, Harden, Kyrie, Giannis and Westbrook are pretty strong guarantees.  Then Lowry has a decent argument and Embiid/Tatum will probably reach that point.  Jimmy Butler too depending on how the next few years go."
"I agree that AD is a much better 2nd option &amp; ceiling raiser than Embiid but I don't see how Embiid is a much better floor raiser &amp; 1st option than AD. Only slightly.  He's literally only gone as far as AD has in the playoffs as a 1st option in a weaker Eastern with much more help. The year he made it to the 2nd round he had Jimmy Butler (the man who dueled LeBron and AD in the Finals alone at times), Simmons and solid role players like Redick.   AD's best teammates every year were injured, like Boogie, so the only player close to being a star was Jrue and he had to face the Warriors each time he made it"
"Why do people always say this? I guarantee if you add jimmy butler to any team, they will be better. Ofc a team of butler and KAT will be a better team then just KAT."
I‚Äôll tell you what happened after 2015 Bulls fired Thibs sold Deng for shit and disgraced just about every player on that roster who bled for Chicago they sold Taj and Hienrich also the icing on the cake was the Jimmy butler Trade but they did basically everyone dirty on that roster. 2016-2018 was like watching the team you love just get shit on for nothing becuase GAR/PAX are idiots and the owner is a clown they showed no loyalty for their players it‚Äôs disgusting
What happened? Did age just creep up plus the emergence of jimmy butler?
"I mean if KD stays healthy that‚Äôs what the Warriors do anyway.  I don‚Äôt get this argument, because it‚Äôs obvious. You aren‚Äôt wrong, but it just isn‚Äôt saying much. You could replace them with Paul George or Jimmy Butler, both vastly worse than Harden/KD and those Dubs still likely 3-peat"
"Well, give Paul George or Jimmy Butler those Warriors and they win too.  I don‚Äôt see that as much of an argument lol"
"""Bullying works."" - Jimmy Butler"
"I love Ant, but you can definitely tell the casual Wolves fans by what they have to say about him.  Don't get me wrong, im happy to talk Wolves with anyone, but its pretty clear when I'm talking to someone who's more of a NFL, MLB , or NHL guy .  On the flipside that would be KAT. Casual fans tend to really think lowly of him.  Jimmy Butler basically destroyed his rep unfortunately"
"Jimmy Butler, maybe."
Reporters doing that is the reason Jimmy Butler gets paid tens of millions a year instead of hundreds of thousands.
"Yeah, I agree! I've always said the orthodox version of Jimmy Butler is Omri Casspi."
"They got a handful of vets that were... meant to be locker room leaders...  J.J. Redick, Steven Adams, Eric Bledsoe...  And the guys like them but they didn't establish a culture the way Julius Randle has for the Knicks. Or Jimmy Butler for the Heat. Or Chris Paul/The Suns. Conley is that dude on the Jazz.  We just don't have that."
"Here's another example, the point god CP3, a future HOF, one of the best PGs in NBA history did not make his 1st Western Confernece finals appearance until 2018, 13 whole years.  That's how difficult the West is when one of the ATG players can only make it once, twice in his entire 16 year career.    During that time DeRozan-Lowry were getting to the ECF multiple times no issue, Jimmy Butler made it to the finals, Howard made it to the finals, the bum ass Celtics without Irving, etc."
Has their been anyone in NBA history who‚Äôs done a complete 180 on how they‚Äôre perceived as a teammate like Jimmy Butler has?
Some Great Ones:  -Showing Knicks Fans Randle Highlights   -Showing Bucks Fans MVP Giannis highlights  -Showing NBA fans Jason Kidd drilling 3s late in his career  -Showing Suns Fans highlights of Booker‚Äôs 70 point game the day after Nash got traded  Some Cruel Ones:  -Show Thunder fans MVP Harden highlights the day after OKC traded him  -Show Bulls fans Jimmy Butler highlights while Rose was still having his MVP season (they prob thought they would become championship locks)  -Show wolves fans Wiggins vs Chicago Lavine highlights
"I‚Äôm saying I forgot this man was still in the league, seems like last time I saw him suit up for the bulls Jimmy Butler was his teammate lol"
I'm pumped for some Jimmy Butler playoffs... if we even get there.
Noah was also 4th in MVP voting that season though. Dude was legit.  Jimmy Butler hadn‚Äôt broken out yet and Rose/Deng were injured most of the year. That team had no business winning games.
"Can we get jimmy butler over to the Knicks?? Then they‚Äôll have Jimmy, D Rose, Thibs, and Taj Gibson. I‚Äôll just imagine it‚Äôs the bulls"
Jimmy Butler and Pau Gasol (with Rose being the third wheel)
Someone on the team must have gotten footage of the Jimmy Butler practice and had our third stringers take notes...
"Jimmy Butler should be on there.  Lavine isn't Top 15. He has the same problem as KAT of being great offensively, but suspect on defense, and Lavine is even worse than KAT on defense."
Yet Randle keeps getting left off the top 15 on the kia mvp ladder smh. Keep putting Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving ahead of him.
Jimmy Butler has that coffee thing that everyone was talking about in the bubble.
"'Steph Curry is my second choice for MVP right now, just behind Jimmy Butler'  Try that - you can confuse them by placing him at 2nd, but behind someone who isn't in the conversation"
"Well Kanter and Melo expire at the end of the season, so big prayers that they both get shot into the fucking sun. Hopefully Neil Olshey trades CJ for a decent-to-good forward and we re-sign Norm to be our starting 2 guard (who's big af mind you, don't let his height fool you - he has a longer standing reach and wingspan than Jimmy Butler and he weighs more than him).  Bring Collins back as the backup 5 and baby we got a stew goin. Just need a coach that can take advantage of that roster."
"Jimmy Butler and Kyrie Irving own an underwear company together. They didn‚Äôt start the company, but they‚Äôre both heavily invested in it.  https://www.psdunderwear.com"
Jimmy Butler shat on his reputation.
He should‚Äôve embraced the great Tom Thibodeau and the great Jimmy Butler instead of being a softie. He‚Äôd actually be on a winning team and get the credit he deserves.
"No, we need to ban him. Can‚Äôt risk anymore nephew takes. He‚Äôll come back tomorrow comparing Jimmy Butler to Scottie Pippen"
Jimmy Butler to the finals last year. Derrick Rose to the finals this year.
"Yeah what are the sixers going to do this time? Lose in the second round again?  Embiid couldn‚Äôt get it done with reddick, butler, harris, Simmons and now he‚Äôs going to do it without jimmy and JJ?   Sixers fans need to accept that they basically handicapped their squad when they whiffed on jimmy and Ben Simmons decided that shooting wasn‚Äôt for him.  They need to stop starting beef with Milwaukee and start preparing jokes about process 2.0, which will be starting 3 years from now."
Jimmy butler also had a similar thing happen in 2015
"I mean the Clippers were affected because CP3 saw that they had no shot against the Curry KD Warriors and chose to move to Houston to team up with Harden at least partially because that was one of the only ways to create a team that might be at the Warriors level. And this is really the big trickle down effect of no KD in Golden State.  If CP3 stays with the Clippers and they run it back with Blake why couldn't they beat the Spurs and the Rockets? They already beat the Spurs in 2015 and were an epic choke job in Game 6 away from beating the Rockets too so it's not like that was some insurmountable task either. No CP3 on the Rockets mean they never reach the heights of 2018 either and probably plateau at their 2015 and 2017 levels.  With the Spurs you have to account for the fact that Kawhi's injury happened against the Warriors in the WCF. This is kinda butterfly theory, but without KD there, that series goes differently and maybe Kawhi doesn't get injured. So if you believe his side of the story (that he left because he thought the Spurs doctors didn't value his health), then his reason for leaving dissappears too.  For the Jazz, maybe without the depressing thought of having to face the Warriors every year, Hayward stays in 2017 (and also since he's not in Boston, he dodges that freak ankle injury that hobbled him for a couple of years). They had already drafted Mitchell before Hayward left anyway so that team suddenly becomes really spicy too.  The Blazers made the WCF in 2019 so they were already pretty close at least one year to making it. Plus with no KD in Golden State maybe they swing for the fences more and trade a package of CJ + other assets for Paul George, Jimmy Butler, or Kawhi to try and make a run (similar to how the Raptors did).  And for what it's worth, the Wolves were 3rd in the West in 2018 before Jimmy was injured for like a month (behind only Golden State and Houston). With no KD in Golden State and potentially no CP3 in Houston, they're suddenly really close to being at the top of the West. And sure Jimmy probably still gets frustrated by KAT and Wiggins' immaturity, but at the same time they probably respond better to what Jimmy wants from them if they're that close to contending"
"His talent is unquestionable, and I know he's been through some really tough personal shit this year, but even before that mentally I don't think he's that guy , it's no coincidence that his only playoff appearance so far had a lot to do with Jimmy Butler, and by his standards KAT was terrible in that series.         So I won't kill him too much because Minnesota is just not a great organization but I do think there's a ceiling on where she can be in terms of being a player on a contender if he were to get traded for example"
Best scorer since Jordan. The guy who led his team to the finals at age 23 and went toe to toe with Miami's superteam led by peak Lebron.         Plus           Top 5 all time offensive player who was the only person ever to take the GOAT team to the brink of elimination       vs           Guy who got dad dicked by Jimmy Butler        LMAO
He has Anthony Edwards and Dlo and he used to have Jimmy Butler. The Timberwolves have had a good roster for the past few years
"RJ is like a jimmy butler... I don't think he'll ever put up CRAZY numbers consistently, but when he's playing he's contributing somehow."
I might be looking at entertaining in a different way but here's my all entertainment starting 5  Ron artest dennis rodman shawn bradley Steve kerr and Jimmy butler
"I'm not saying ""haha they got worse."" That's not the tone I used at all. Are you seriously suggesting we shouldn't judge that move with the benefit of hindsight? Also I really don't think it took hindsight to see that the core and not the coach was the reason for the mediocrity. There were no elite players, the kinds of players that advance in the playoffs, that you can count on to make big plays down the stretch in a playoff game, no Giannis, no Jimmy Butler, no Tatum, no Embiid. It's a roster full of good role players, and Sabonis who's sort of a borderline all-star kind a guy and Turner who's outstanding on defense. I don't think it was a secret now or then that those two didn't fit together like a glove in the front court. Or that Oladipo was no longer a big difference maker. And yet McMillan took you guys to the playoffs every year and he's going to take the Hawks this year. I mean you are complaining about the offense, but it always seemed to me like the Pacers just really didn't have that much offensive firepower as a roster, so McMillan really maximized a gritty defensive team. He was getting a ton out of the roster that he was presented, like he pretty much always has including this season. If you want to talk without hindsight - that move was maligned immediately by coaches around the league. They don't come out and publicly criticize a lot of firings, but boy they sure seemed adamant that that was a bad move, and they're really in a very good position to judge given that they coach against the guy. You realize that lots of teams have had issues with injuries this year, right? The Pacers are not alone in that at all. The Hawks have certainly had their fair share and are still where they need to be. I would agree that it was a gamble, but I don't think it was a wise one. Even if you happen to hire someone better than Nate, you didn't have a contender level roster for your new genius ball-movement coach to work with. So I hope you're right that your front office shakes up the roster and you get lucky in the lottery because if not, I think you'll be looking at another first round exit or play-in team for a long time regardless of who the coach is. But oh yeah, Nate McMillan was responsible for the first round exits and not the front office."
On the flip side KATs the only player I‚Äôve seen who openly disliked playing for him. I‚Äôve never been able to shake the Jimmy Butler quote about who wanted to work in Minny
Mini? You mean the new Jimmy Butler.
Low key. knicks have a potential contender duo. Both Randle and RJ arent done improving and RJ could definitely turn into a Jimmy Butler level player while Randle just keep doing what he is doing or even improve even more.
Jimmy Butler.
Next year we're going to be talking about how Jimmy Butler is a mini-RJ Barrett
"Going by playstyle, the next Jimmy Butler is a little more accurate"
"Nah, you're wrong. The voters vote for the top 5 MVP players and Randle needs to be in the discussion for getting 5th place votes. If people are going to talk about Jimmy Butler for MVP, Dame for MVP, Curry for MVP, Kawhi, LeBron, Gobert, etc then Randle needs to be there too. If he doesn't get votes its a crime"
"Its a three-way tie between Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler, and Kelly Oubre Jr."
"Dame, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid"
Dirk Nowitzki. Non mavs: Jimmy Butler
"Butler and Tatum, Jimmy looked amazing at the half-way point, but the Heat have since been mediocre and he‚Äôs averaging 21/6/7"
Idk Jimmy Butler is pretty good

"He never asked out of Chicago and wanted to build a winner here, but GarPax sabotaged the team to try to make Jimmy look bad to scapegoat him, and then when they couldn‚Äôt even do that because he made All NBA with his best season, they traded him and sent the Bulls into a new decade of despair.  He did ask out of Minnesota, but Philadelphia was just dicks to him on the way out and didn‚Äôt want him for some stupid reason, even though Embiid wanted him back. If Morey was in Philly a year earlier, Butler would still be on the Sixers."
"Here is a list of players in the conversation right now:  Jokic, Kawhi, Embiid, Steph, Luka, Giannis, Dame, Harden, Gobert, Jimmy Butler, LeBron  That's a lot of players, some are definitely more fringe right now but they've been rotated in and out this season. Voters vote for their top 5 MVP candidates so it makes sense to extend that conversation to fringe 5th place candidates like Randle right now that could move up during the home stretch of this season   TL;DR: If people are going to talk about Jimmy Butler for MVP like a month ago when the Heat were a 4th seed or Dame when the Blazers are like an 8th seed Randle deserves the same treatment when the Knicks are a 4th seed and he's been this great"
"As a Lakers fan, you watched Jimmy Butler do what he did in the finals and still don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a true leader?"
"I think he's somebody that you can't rely on in the playoffs, and yes I know he led his Pacers two back-to-back Conference Finals back in the day, and I didn't believe in him as a superstar then, but ever since he called himself ""Playoff p"" smh, and I said this at the time but Kawhi Leonard would have been better off staying in Toronto or going down to Miami to team with Jimmy Butler, maybe Paul George will prove me wrong in the playoffs this year but I'm not putting any money on it         ( and I know that Kawhi Leonard played like garbage in game seven against the Nuggets but his overall track record still works for me)"
"Your post does nothing to bring discussion. Luka is the next hot thing, and you‚Äôre on a sub that‚Äôs reactionary as hell. Luka is better than Jimmy butler regardless of if he took his bubble team to the finals. Luka is better than dame, otherwise the blazers would be ahead of the mavs in the standings with injuries to both teams. Tatum is right there with Luka and kyrie has proven himself, albeit as a second fiddle, which is the only way he‚Äôs been successful. Is this comment why this sub is trash?"
"Jimmy Butler is never satisfied. It‚Äôs like Jordan but he just doesn‚Äôt carry the gravity of being able to will his team to championships. So consequently, he hates failure and wants the next best chance to win even if he doesn‚Äôt stay in one place too long.   Would not shock me at all if he wanted to leave Miami eventually if they don‚Äôt turn it around."
Let's be honest. Come this offseason would you be surprised if Jimmy Butler asked out of Miami this summer citing Tyler Herro's attitude?
Idk about y'all but I'd rather have Jimmy butler on my team than him not on my team
Fuck Jimmy Butler and the Cryami Cheat
"But the Lakers have both in AD and LeBron so you can't just leave them off.  Speaking of LeBron... It feels premature to just conclude that a ""point forward"" is more valuable in today's style just because his team tends to win or be close.  Also, is Jimmy Butler a ""point forward"" or a small forward? Is Bam a 2 way center or a point forward? This conversation is kinda stupid in the first place!"
Jimmy butler needs to run a scrimmage with the 3rd stringers again during practice
"Jimmy ""just get to the playoffs and I'll handle the rest"" Butler. You better be ready to handle the play ins bro."
‚ÄúLloyd‚Äôs at home wearing his Jimmy Butler Jersey‚Äù
"Lmao, imagine thinking Jimmy Butler was good enough to lead a team."
"Lmao, imagine thinking Jimmy Butler was good enough to lead a team."
But they‚Äôre battle tested in the playoffs!!! Jimmy butler said he can win it all
He started kinda playing like Jimmy once Butler went  out. He drove to the rim and was kicking the ball out for open shooters a couple of times or getting free throws. Glad he's adding to his game and not just relying on 3s this season.
"That‚Äôs exactly what I what I was thinking, Tatum is good but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs first team good, especially with how bad the celts have been compared to previous years, I think moving Tatum to second team and switching him with jimmy butler would makes sense, or moving luka to the forward spot and moving cp3 to first team, other than that this system makes a pretty solid all nba team  Edit: also Joel should definitely be 2 Team over Rudy"
jimmy butler is the most appreciated underappreciated player of all time
"All-NBA Teams are gonna be wonky this year, that's for sure. You can argue butler has been having a better season than Kawhi or whatever. Jimmy definitely deserves one, but you can make that argument for a bunch of different players this year. First team is definitely Steph/Luka/?/Giannis/Jokic. Apparently some players like Embiid can slot in at different positions, so that makes it even tougher. He's been injured, but a fantastic season judging by how the Heat were barely in the playoffs at one point."
"The last thing they really need is another young player; they need to get a veteran to get them over the hump.  Add a guy like Jimmy Butler or Chris Paul to this team next season and they'd F around and be a home court team.  Somebody gotta hold the young guys they got now accountable, and be able to take over games in the clutch; a rookie isn't gonna do any of that.  Obviously Jimmy or Chris specifically isn't gonna come to this team lol, but somebody LIKE that; not sure what their cap situation is like or who is available."
Jimmy Butler made me a rich man during the time Dragic was hurt on his PTS+REB+AST totals. Walking triple double.
"It was the best shot he could have reasonably got. Capela had already blocked him twice and was already ready to guard the basket. If Westbrook drives it‚Äôs a much worse decision than shooting the 3. Nobody else on the Wizards was open enough to be passed to for a basket. If Jimmy Butler shot a 3 there not a soul in the world would think about if it was a bad shot. Because it‚Äôs Westbrook he will constantly be nitpicked for incredibly stupid reasons. That was not bad decision making, people who say that just don‚Äôt like Westbrook."
need to see d rose light up jimmy butler for 40 each night in the first round üí™üèΩ
&gt; giannis  * [How AD approached defending Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.](https://youtu.be/k0tn9QRJMec?t=82)  * [How Giannis approached defending Jimmy Butler in the playoffs.](https://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/1300621898200604672)
Jimmy was Godly in those Finals so when AD switched onto him he locked down the entire Heat offense to record lows for a Finals team during the time he guarded Butler
Iirc the Heat were missing their 2nd and 3rd best players yet the Lakers still lost 2 games to Jimmy Butler and 3 rookies?
"I'm still reluctant to include Bam as a forward, but if you did I guess the argued team would be Simmons, Butler, Draymond, Bam, Gobert. I think it's super close between Jimmy and Jrue, and between Draymond and Giannis."
Who would you say is more self-aware than Jimmy ‚ÄúBig Pleasure‚Äù Butler?
"Well tbh even 1.7 seems extremely low across an entire game, I wonder what the criteria is for an official box-out, because by the eye test someone like Jimmy Butler works way harder on the glass than KD, and that box-out stat doesn‚Äôt show it   But I do agree with the overall point in this thread, which is that non big men typically don‚Äôt box out often and I do think for star players it is an energy conservation thing"
"Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Simmons, Russ, etc  That‚Äôs a pretty lame excuse, to say it‚Äôs fine for him to just skip one of the fundamentals of winning basketball because he‚Äôs a star"
Says the person with Jimmy Butler on his team
Without Jimmy Butler the bench stepped it all the way up.
"To be fair, Jimmy‚Äôs burner could possibly be saying ‚ÄúJimmy Butler runs a marathon every Sunday at midnight‚Äù"
"Jimmy Butler, Derozan, Paul George unless they win a 'ship"
You must know nothing about jimmy butler
"I mean, yeah, but there's a reason the Spurs beat the Heat and it's because of a lot of guys making more winning plays than the other team. that's why guys like Jalen Brunson go in the second round but become extremely useful role players, while uber athletes wash out of the league.   Jimmy Butler should not be better than Paul George, statistically and especially as a scorer. they're similar defenders and PG is usually a more efficient scorer but is there anybody who would rather have him over Butler right now? it's because Jimmy makes ""winning plays"" when it matters and PG doinks shots off the backboard. maybe I spent too much time watching the big three all succeed long past their primes because of ""winning plays"" and I'm just ignorant to how basketball works."
Jimmy Butler has been so much better than Randle. There is no way Randle should make it over him
"If Jimmy Butler doesn't retire with an FMVP, I'm gonna be upset."
"Fun fact, the Miami Heat have never lost a game when Jimmy Butler makes a 3. Don't fact check this"
"The eye test supports Butler even more than stats. As Zach Lowe said on his podcast today, ""Jimmy Butler is a walking winning play""."
Jimmy Butler makes me laugh
Khris Middleton  CJ McCollum  Karl Anthony-Towns  Kyrie Irving (people will remember him just not how great he was)  Donovan Mitchell  Nikola Vucevic  Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Ben Simmons  John Wall   Kemba Walker (might remember him for what he did in college)  Trae Young
"**First Team:** Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert.   **Second Team:** Marcus Smart, Jrue Holiday, Kawhi Leonard, Mikal Brudges, Joel Embiid.  Honestly, I really considered going the ""cheating route"" of using Bam and Embiid as ""forwards"" to include Bam and Myles Turner. Shout-outs to Clint Capela, Matisse Thybulle and Paul George too."
Jimmy Butler outdueled LeBron fucking James in two finals games.   How quickly people forget ffs
Jimmy Butler easily
Khris Middleton   Danuel House    Alex Caruso    DeAndre Jordan     Timelord     Hakeem     Clyde Drexler    Armoni Brooks    Nate Hinton    Damyean Dotson     Gerald Green      DeAroon Fox    Jimmy Butler     Justice Winslow
Jimmy Butler. Still have regrets that we didn't change the front office for him.
it's definitely Steph over Jimmy Butler for first team
"How do you measure leadership? Demeanor when things get tough? How much does the player impacted his team? Does he fills the line correctly? Does he reads plays correctly?  Stats are important, but so are those other things. That's why footage is so important, and not 1 or 2 games, but I'm talking about a bunch of footage. Practically watching that player's career.   Shaq was very dominant in his prime, but you couldn't rely on him to win championship. He was the perfect sidekick to someone who scored the ball aka Kobe. But... he was so good at being a sidekick that he is even is the GOAT conversation. That itself is QUITE an achievement.   Remember: scoring the ball is the most difficult part of the game. That's why I respect Jimmy Butler so much: he was a defensive player that developed a good offensive game after being in the NBA already; Kawhi did the same (even better). The difference between both is that Jimmy is a great leader, Kawhi isn't. Being a defensive player and developing into a great offensive player that is capable of choosing your spots and creating your own shot in WHATEVER situation you're into is almost impossible. Obviously, you have to balance that out w/ the rest of the player's skills. But scoring whenever you need to should be the top priority.  One thing to note: Highlights and Stats don't tell the whole story. Check out Game 1 of 2018 NBA Finals after JR Smith's blunder. You'll see Lebron almost crying. Dude... you're the leader of the team. How does that happen? You're supposed to gather your teammates and take over the game. If you lose doing your best, that's ok. But you can't tell me that he gave his best on that overtime. As a basketball fan in general, I was very disappointed. This is my biggest criticism of Lebron's career: he should've won more championships, but he is inconsistent in his demeanor and effort. And definitely, that game wasn't the first time that he had done that, that was just one more in his long history of doing that. Right now he's on my Lakers and I'm mad with him: the guy is not playing (Vogel already told us what we knew: no medical reasons), and we need him. We have the best team in the league and we're 7th on the west. The Lakers are characterized for winning multiple championships in almost every run. I don't expect less this time around No excuses if we lose, period.   MJ, KJ, Duncan, Magic, Kobe, Bird for the most part were great leaders with great demeanor on court. They also won championships, and for the most part, were the players that took over the game when you needed them to, and they were consistent in doing so even though it sometimes resulted in a loss. And those doubting KJ, probably never saw him in Milwaukee. Lebron is inconsistent in that department, and that's why it is frustrating, because we know that he is capable of doing it, but he is such a beast doing the other things that he can be in that list. Shaq was similar in that department, not quite the same but he shared some of those characteristics. He was less disciplined though. Props to Lebron, the guy has been lucky and taken care of his body. And also, even though he sometimes bailed on his team, he also did a great job of getting those squads to those NBA Finals. I really enjoyed his 2015 run; even though he lost, he gave it all. I would love to see him play like that every single time.   And don't get me wrong, I love all of these players, and A Dantley, C Anthony, G Gervin, H Olajuwon, K Malone, C Drexler, B Walton, J Havlicek, D Wade, etc.   *This is just merely what factors I would consider to rank those guys. This is why I don't consider Shaq an actual GOAT, and again, he was on my Lakers, I LOVE Shaq. He was a beast, period, that can't be argued.   There are other ways of doing it, and some of them are also great."
Jimmy Butler is a very sensitive man
Jimmy Butler if he stayed ;(
&gt; People just focus on the few exceptions where a guy consistently over/underperforms  I don‚Äôt think anybody argues these players never exist like I said before I think DeRozan would be one of the first ex people call a playoff underperformer. The bucks are a pretty analytically oriented franchise and clearly thought Bledsoe was too much of a playoff underperformer. It‚Äôs just the availability heuristic where these ex cause people to think it‚Äôs more common than it actually is   What we‚Äôre talking about with Jimmy Butlers playoff track record is basically the last 2 years. 33 games in a 11 year career. We can call it what it is 2 strong postseasons. I don‚Äôt 33 games to be that predictive of how he‚Äôll play in the playoffs going forward and that‚Äôs where I probably disagree with others. That‚Äôs kind of my point with Paul George postseason 2013-17 vs 2018-20   And even with Butler it‚Äôs all relative the playoff reputation. When James harden has 12 points in an elimination game vs LA people don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh he was just too fatigued can‚Äôt blame him‚Äù. When Paul George averages 22/6/5 but goes 5/14 16 points 1 assist in an elimination game his team loses vs Toronto people will drag him not talk about how good he was.
"Sure. But sometimes players also consistently step up their games or choke in the playoffs. I hate to say it but DeMar DeRozan consistently struggled in the playoffs in Toronto over five years. It was not a small sample size, and I love DeMar.        Blaming narratives, recency bias, and sample sizes is often correct but it‚Äôs also sometimes a way for this sub to feel smarter than the stupid sheeple. Jimmy Butler is a great playoff performer and saying he‚Äôs overrated by adding up his W-L record is ridiculous."
"Lol not only had he not made the leap, but in 2012 when ""#1 seed lost in the 1st round"" was the Derrick Rose injury. Even it it wasn't, Jimmy Butler played 4 minutes that series. Total."
"I think of Webber like people think of Jimmy Butler now. Impactful player, no one wants to go up against him (regular season or playoffs), but never quite in that top tier of dudes, even at his own position.  This is obviously with regard to perception and impact around the league, not playstyle, which is very different from Butler's."
I dont recall anyone saying Jimmy Butler was playoff Bron or anything like that. He had 1 nice run tho
JaeSean Tate - 1.9  Jimmy Butler  - 1.8  Dorian Finney Smith - 1.7  Then its Westbrook
Jimmy Butler energy. Someone less lazy than me can post the gif.
"i mean its always a sellers market other teams don‚Äôt care what the Warriors motivations are because it will be a bidding war regardless, look at what PG, AD, Harden, Vucevic, Jrue Holiday all just got traded for, if you‚Äôre bargain shopping for a star you almost definitely wont fond one the only exception has been Jimmy Butler"
"When you get to the upper echelon of NBA players, things like leadership and intangibles come into play. Guys like Jimmy Butler, Lebron, Dame, and CP3 (not the only guys, just examples) elevate their team's morale and play both through their oncourt performance and leadership. On the other hand, the reason why players like Harden, Kyrie, and PG don't get the respect their stats might seem to indicate they deserve is because they don't provide leadership or lockerroom benefit. KAT firmly falls into the latter group. The best superstars never see anything close to the consistently poor performances KAT's wolves have had."
CP3 &gt; Kyrie and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs close. Between games played and the Suns record that should be a no brained.   Also Jimmy Butler is a BIG snub from this list. He‚Äôs been one of the best forwards in the league this year. For some reason his season is flying a little under the radar even with his finals performance last year.
no jimmy butler but you have pg and zion?   also bam? i know you need a 3rd center but at that point suck it up a d have embiid second
Jimmy Butler is a Gerald Henderson level raptor killer.
"Curry could be a free agent next summer.   Chris Paul, Zach Lavine, and Bradley Beal are also guys coming up for free agency in the near future too I believe.   Russ, Nets Big 3, and Jimmy Butler will be up in 2023"
For the Raps it used to be Jimmy Butler in the Derozan era (idk if he still kills us).
you have jimmy butler on ur team bruh
Jimmy Butler is on your team cut it out
I mean it‚Äôs not that easy just look at derozan he‚Äôs a mid range assassin that can‚Äôt shoot from 3 Jimmy Butler to a lesser degree as well
If DRose gets in you are opening the door for a lot of players who have done more than him getting in   If DRose is in the Hall you say everyone on the below list should make it today:   Kemba Walker  Tim Hardaway SR.   Shawn Marion   Rajon Rondo   Jimmy Butler   John Wall  Jermaine O‚ÄôNeal   Al Horford
"I wouldn‚Äôt say relatively healthy fits the Sixers this season, but healthier than the Heat fits. It‚Äôs hard to fully nail down healthy with all that goes into it. Like Bam and Jimmy have played more (46) games together than Simmons and Embiid(40), but the Sixers top 3 person rotation (Simmons, Green, Harris) has played 49 games together compared to Miami‚Äôs(Butler, Bam, Robinson).   The Sixers have had a fairly healthy bench and, for the most part, have had injuries spread out over the year compare to having multiple people out at the same time."
Dude Jimmy changed the whole culture of the Sixers when he came in. It looked like a completely different team. He carried the Wolves to the playoffs. Obviously nobody predicted what would happen in Miami but Butler was already considered top 20
I‚Äôm not the average r/nba user that follows media narratives and can‚Äôt form my own opinion and evaluation of a player. Anyone that had a hint of basketball iq knew butler was a winning player even ESPN talking heads knew it they just say wild shit for narratives sake. I actually watched butler In minessota and philly and knew he was a legit winning player. Average user here just reads headlines all day and see shit like jimmy is a cancer and when the headlines come that he‚Äôs joining Miami the most upvoted comment is that he came here to retire to fuck hookers and do blow
/r/nba ate that shit up more than anyone. Jimmy Butler was public enemy A1 from day 1. Even when he was on the Wolves he got massive shit for maybe being mean to Rubio once?
So why isn‚Äôt harden and Durant still up for all nba? Harden has a higher VORP than booker Mitchell and Beal and similar to Chris Paul and Jimmy Butler.   The reality is that thybulle would have to literally be providing twice the defensive impact that bridges is. That‚Äôs likely not the case. When you play half the minutes you have to be twice as good and while per minute these guys may be better they‚Äôre not twice as good.
"Suns are a better matchup for lakers than clips because their firepower is focused in guard play. Lakers‚Äô guard defense is strong. Clips strength is their wings. We don‚Äôt guard big wings well, as evidence by Jimmy Butler. KCP is just too small. Also I think clips defense inside is better than Suns by a lot."
"&gt;maybe his scoring wasn't 'empty' per se but his style of basketball and personality were not based around winning.  He would've won a title and arguably FMVP in 88 if not for the refs gifting it to the Lakers.  Is Jimmy Butler ""not based around winning"" because his team also lost in the Finals? Last I checked, it takes quite a bit of winning to even reach the Finals. Guys like Jokic, Giannis, CP3, Dame, Embiid have never even made it.  But keep on dismissing all that because ""rangz, Erneh."""
To be fair guys like KD and Jimmy Butler have been good in the playoffs and they have high free throw rates
i want him to beat jimmy butler so bad

Jimmy never had a problem with Wiggins. He was slighted because KAT was going to be the #1 guy after that season and was due for a new contract at the same time as Butler.
Jimmy Butler said to KAT two days ago that he‚Äôs soft as chicken shit haha he went at both of them
"If we are going by GameScore, here are the top 10 in NBA history. Note obviously gamescore gives higher points to volume scorers with decent efficiency but it‚Äôs a decent metric. Shout out to Jimmy Butler for making the top 10, Shaq for being a beast and Lebron for making 3/10 spots   2000 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.6  2017 - Kevin Durant 30.3  2002 - Shaquille O'Neal 30.1  1993 - Michael Jordan 29.6   2017 - LeBron James 29.6  1991 - Michael Jordan 29.4  1987 - Magic Johnson 28.3  2018 - Lebron James 28.3  2020 - JIMMY BUTLER 27.7  2020 - Lebron James 27.5"
I actually thought the Jimmy Butler stuff was towards Wiggins. He's the one the seems like he doesn't give a fk.. I guess KAT is the star.
Because Jimmy Butler is a known asshole.
I‚Äôm a little biased cause I‚Äôm a Kentucky fan but even still it‚Äôs so annoying to see how fans talk about him ever since the Jimmy Butler stuff. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs a good dude and he‚Äôs been through way more in recent years than most people
The heat Skill boost: Herro Idk but yeah Size boost: Bam Adebayo I think he already should be a DPOY candidate and adding 3 inches to him would make him amazing  Athleticism boost:MAN IDK BASKETBALL UHHH JIMMY BUTLER
Jimmy Butler called this man 'soft as baby shit' right after his fucking mom died
"Just for fun, elaborate why without saying ‚ÄúbEcAuSE JiMmY BuTLeR SAid sO‚Äù"
Wat.  The only thing I claimed is that Thibs traded Lavine when he could have traded Wiggins. That was the initial interest: https://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/15/jimmy-butler-trade-bulls-timberwolves-andrew-wiggins  The replier asserted that Thibs wanted to trade Wiggins but ownership wanted to trade Lavine. That has no basis whatsoever.   But go off I guess.
"Jimmy Butler: ""You're soft as baby shit"""
"I‚Äôve never met Jimmy Butler, but he does seem like he can be a bit... needlessly agressive"
"I agree. I think that Butler has been pretty harsh towards KAT, but I appreciate that I think even Jimmy would never go into the territory of talking about KAT's mom. There's a certain code that I think even extends into trash talk. Calling somebody ""soft as baby shit"" is fine. But if Jimmy would've said anything about KAT's mom, I would've hoped that KAT would've swung at him."
"I'm really glad that, at least as far as I saw, even for somebody who has as much animosity for KAT as he does, Jimmy Butler didn't even get anywhere close to saying anything about his mom. It's really important for people to understand that certain things are off limits no matter what. With ""your mom"" being such a cliche part of casual insults, I'm glad Jimmy didn't accidentally (or intentionally) go there."
"We had a user in our sub going off in every post about Jimmy and KAT's mom and it was cringey as hell. He was downvoted to oblivion every time and told to go to bed lol but still.   Like, fuck Jimmy Butler, but don't be conflating unrelated things just cause of some tame trash talk."
"Ok, but we‚Äôve also seen Jimmy have a positive effect on the teams he‚Äôs been on since being traded away while KAT continues to have the same non franchising changing effect on the wolves. We‚Äôve seen KAT and Wiggins play great basketball together for like a quarter of a season before there combined ongoing bad play ( and KAT‚Äôs injuries) got wiggins traded away, after which trade KAT continues to lead the wolves nowhere.  Again im not arguing that as all time T. wolf that Butler was more important to the franchise (though if they cant make the playoffs with KAT in these next 2 years i‚Äôd say otherwise) but again, In my &lt;3, it Jimmy Buckets &gt; KAT anyday"
"But we know a wolves with KAT &amp; without butler looks like booty so‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I dunno bro, i can only judge the situations as they‚Äôve actually happened. Maybe they were better together, but clearly KAT and the wolves are worse without Jimmy."
"You do realize that professional athletes have talked shit to each other during games forever, right?  [Karl-Anthony Towns was asked postgame about his exchange with Jimmy Butler, and Anthony Edwards stepped in to take the answer. ""Man, they grown men, dog. They just be talkin, havin a regular conversation, if you ask me... It's no competition if we not talkin shit to each other.""](https://twitter.com/DaneMooreNBA/status/1390871279314554883)"
"**First:** Steph Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic.   **Second:** Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Julius Randle, Joel Embiid.   **Third:** Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Paul George, Zion Williamson, Rudy Gobert.   I'd say he's probably competing with PG and Zion for a 3rd team spot. Sheesh the guard spots are tough too. Harden, Westbrook, Booker, Mitchell, LaVine..."
The calls Jimmy butler got last playoff run astounded me
It still boggles my mind how good Randle is.  This one season jump is like when Jimmy Butler suddenly went from role player to All Star out of the blue.
Is Jimmy Butler your father?
"Look at the facts. Jimmy Butler took Cryler Zero and Bum Adebayo to the Finals. KD needed Westbrook and Harden, and then the 73-9 Warriors to make the Finals."
I might be the biggest Jimmy Butler fan in this entire sub but let me tell you KD is better
"I fucking adore jimmy butler. I would classify him as having superstar impact.  However, Kevin durant is a generational talent and easily a top 3 scorer of all time (if not the best). Dude can score at will. He‚Äôs only played 31 games this season, has had injury set backs and is still on of the better scorers in the league while contributing 5 assists and 7 rebounds. Right now durant is still better"
KD with a fucked up achilles is levels better than peak Jimmy Butler
Im one of the biggest Jimmy Butler fans you can find.... but come on lol
Jimmy Butler is fucking STAMPED   Such a winner
"Jimmy Butler was *0-for-15* on his last 3's before he made that one after the Celtics cut the deficit to 6.  Going up 26 at the end of the 1st half was awesome. Seeing the Celtics slowly trickle their way back into the game on a bunch of FTs, Foster not call an obvious clear path foul, having Mark Jones / Hubie Brown root for the C's slow comeback was not as awesome. I also hate that Evan Fournier is on a relevant team for the 1st time his career. Still won tho. Time to do it again on Tuesday."
wait a jimmy butler quick 3
Will Jimmy Butler be enough is the question
Butler and Herro friendship still solid after that celebrity status with Harlow music? Or Jimmy boi now hatin?
Dam jimmy Butler is bullying Kornet. Its an easy lay up line with kornet underneath for him.
JIMMY BUTLER IS A SUPERSTAR
"I noted it during last year's playoffs, but with a year of reflection, I'm going to reiterate that Jimmy Butler has the coolest hair in the NBA."
Spurs don't have Jimmy butler g
"Like a lot of their other acquisitions, they got blinded by names and they still failed to address their biggest weakness. The reason why Jimmy Butler looked like MJ for 2 games and why their biggest loss in the regular season was to the Celtics."
"Great stuff and I largely agree; in terms of clearing space for Giannis, the huge difference between you and TOR is your squad was in the Finals last season and given Jimmy's not getting any younger, why would Riley hedge on Giannis when everything says the timeline is now??  Wood would have been the perfect addition, MIA's plus defense would have covered for his flaws on that end and as you say, it's hard to think of a more complimentary big for Bam. Same with Ibaka, who also could have helped mentor Bam.  Love the idea of Grant but wasn't his goal to play somewhere where he could inflate his stats to secure the bag this off season? And wow Lonzo would *really* look good in your back court...never even considered him playing for y'all but would be such a nice. Not sure if NO would have been good with Olynyk for him tho...that said, I like him more for you than Oladipo, whose best days I sincerely believe are already behind him.  Agreed on Lowry, that move would have reeked of desperation...still, what do you want to see Riley do this off season to keep the Jimmy window extended? Because honestly, that seems to be the pressing question, especially in an off season where there aren't very many difference makers available to sign. And not trolling, but do you think Riley would ever consider trading Butler to get assets that would help with building around the young Heat core?"
Schrodinger's Smart: a player that can be both Steph Curry and non-bubble Jimmy Butler at the same time.
&gt;  Rondo/Wade/Jimmy in Chicago all over again  Meh there's a universe where Rondo doesn't get injured and that post season is a little more interesting for the bulls. Similarly Butler doesn't get injured regular season and wolves are higher seed. Or Kawhi doesn't get 3 bounces. Or Bam doesn't get 2 quick fouls game 1 first quarter against the Lakers along with Bam and Dragic injuries. Or finally this [no call](https://streamable.com/x8i2o0)
"Theres no need.  Clearly fans like you would rather remain to be ignorant rather then actually having to watch the games.  You sound like the type of fan who will constantly move the goal posts to fit your own internal narrative and no amount of tactical, statistical, or schematic evidence could be used to sway your mind.  &gt;Lol the core is the same, the team isn‚Äôt drastically different. 3 guys who can shoot + embiid and Simmons. Tobias and embiid were there in 2019.  You mean 3 guys that can't even crack starting lineups anymore right (2018)?  Also The shooting and spacing was pretty awful in 2019 as well, good thing we had that lights out shoot in Jimmy Butler.  But hey if you want to sit there and tell me how easily the future can be read why even play the games right?"
"The Heat aren‚Äôt good, if everyone stopped riding their nuts so hard with the ‚ÄúMiami culture‚Äù shit and Jimmy Butler they‚Äôd realize they are not close to what they were last year. The Hawks would beat them in a series easily"
"If you‚Äôre playing worse than Jimmy Butler, it‚Äôs definitely over."
"He had Jimmy Butler, KAT and Wiggins but still struggled to come up with any sort of offensive scheme to maximize the potential given that level of talent .  It was just ""give it to Jimmy and let him make a play"" or ""let Teague dribble around for 15 seconds"""
Jimmy Butler üî•üî•üî•
"Ah yes because the heat had an amazing series with their ""star"" Jimmy Butler"
Jimmy Butler took that personally.
I think he means fat Jimmy Butler
Who was worse. Jimmy ‚Äúget me there and I‚Äôll take over‚Äù Butler or Julius Randle
Guess Jimmy Butler isn't a star either
Julius ‚ÄúJimmy Butler‚Äù Randle
Jimmy Butler was also pure dog shit haha but it was never really competitive this series has been surprisingly competitive the Knicks would have another win if Randle could just hit a damn shot lol
U just watch jimmy butler playing like dog all 4 games bro. And jimmy have playoff experience
Jimmy Butler lol
This series is a legit black mark on the career of Jimmy Butler.
Thanks Julius Randle for forcing me to watch Jimmy Butler in back2back days
I want to see a duo of Randle and Jimmy Butler this playoffs.
That's gotta sound familiar to a fan of the team with Jimmy Butler on it.
Jimmy Butler about to send UD after him for getting in on his racket.
Jimmy butler will never return to the conference finals as anything other than the 4th best player on the team
I still think Jimmy Butler was the 5th best player last year because how far the heat went and how well he played in the finals.  A players rank can change year to year depending on how they perform. This year he's probably at the most a top 15 player because he underperformed compared to last year. The Heat in general underperformed. In this series against the Bucks only 3 Heat players scored 20pts and Jimmy wasn't one of them.
As if poking fun at the Timberwolves in a thread of people just blasting Jimmy Butler and the Heat somehow makes me an ass.
"Nah Miami were bubble frauds lmao. Jimmy butler couldn‚Äôt even score more than Bryn Forbes in an elimination game. Bam was ass all series, Herro, Duncan, etc all didn‚Äôt show up."
"No hes not, hes a trash offensive player who overrelies on getting to the FT line. Jimmy Butler is also insanely inefficient and his defense doesnt back up his shitty offense.  In order for Butler to get 20pts, he has to reach the FT line 20 times. He is not a top 15 player and even stats dont support it."
"Jimmy butler was ""stupidly locked in"" to going to Cancun."
Heat are overrated because Jimmy Butler is overrated..He‚Äôs a beta who needs an alpha
"His Rookie and 2nd season leap left me with a lot of optimism, if he continues improvement I can see him going a Jimmy Butler route. If you disagree I think that's fine, i'm a lot higher on RJ than others."
Honest question.  Have the jimmy butler heat ever been more than average outside of the bubble?  I mean they were just average both regular seasons and now got destroyed in the playoffs.
Jimmy Butler just lost his entire ethos
Jimmy Butler is a top 10 player (last year).
"Jimmy butler, Gerad Butler, I can't believe it's not butter, Bucks in 4"
"Wow, that OP was out of his mind.  Small sample sizes are a thing.  Butler isn't as good as the sample size made him look in last year's finals, but he's also much better than he looked in this first round.  Still, reading some of that OP's posts and defenses of Butler (""Teams have shut Giannis and Harden down, but nobody can shut down Jimmy!"") is so absurd.  /u/ezra_west :  any comment?"
"I'm not saying that Jimmy Butler doesn't deserve the criticism, just that it's being repeated without added substance. I like seeing it alongside praise for Jrue or at least something beyond ""Jimmy cant shoot"". In fairness I'd say the same about PG, people blindly blame him for Clippers losses even when he puts up good performances, and he doesn't get proper credit for wins.   Maybe you're right though, a day probably isn't enough time lol. Especially after some of Butler's quotes about being locked in. Those are gonna stick for a while."
LeBron in 2011 finals if you consider the fact that he went 18 points on 54% TS with 2 other superstars and the fact that expectation for Jimmy Butler is much lower than it is with LeBron
"As a super casual Heat fan, were Heat fans talking big? Outside of that one Jimmy Butler game we weren't even great in the finals, I was a little embarrassed watching it last year."
"Jimmy was terrific all year. The Heat just weren‚Äôt a good team, and that let the Bucks focus a ton of defensive attention on Butler, because they knew the rest of the team wouldn‚Äôt kill them.   Last year‚Äôs Heat team had the 7th best net rating in the league headed into the bubble. That put them in fringe contender status.  This year‚Äôs Heat team had the 16th best net rating at -0.2. They just weren‚Äôt a good team, for a number of reasons, and last year‚Äôs team was actually really good, both before and in the bubble.  Jimmy‚Äôs playmaking, rebounding, and defense were all there against the Bucks. His scoring was disappointing but makes sense within context of the series. Giannis was his primary defender, if he shook Giannis, it was Jrue or Middleton switching into him, and if he shook any of those 3 defenders, once he got in the paint he was being met by Brook Lopez.   The playoffs are all about hunting mismatches, and Jimmy basically got hit by great defense at all points he was in the game. This was one of those series where Bam and Dragic needed to take over, and once that happened things could open back up for Butler, but none of that happened. Really well designed defensive gameplan from Bud this series."
Jimmy Butler trick yall he says he‚Äôs playing offense but he‚Äôs just running around out there
"Both things can be true, and people need to get their jokes off, especially after how arrogant and cocky heat fans became after last year. not to mention, the weird myth-like persona that jimmy butler started to espouse after his fluff-piece interviews with rachel nichols was weird. all that talking and barking just to get swept in the first round because you shot terribly and weren't able to bark your way past the bucks. we need the jokes to fly.  also, credit to the bucks, they clearly came prepared and made the right moves in the offseason (even got clowned quite a bit). i think they have a legit chance to beat the nets."
"Tbf Butler even at best never was MVP Level like Bron, Westbrook or Harden. Generally I didn‚Äôt like the hype he got after the Bubble (although his performance was incredible, whatever the reason), it was the same kind of overreaction that Kawhi got after Torontos championship (people legit said he was better than Bron) but Kawhi at lesst is a Superstar Caliber, while JButler imo is only capable of Star.  I also feel people undervalue the great performance of the Bucks on D, Jimmy choked no doubt about that."
"Everybody disparaging Jimmy Butler and the Heat because they lost to a team with Giannis, Middleton, and Holiday."
"Jimmy Butler, indeed"
*Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant have entered the chat*
"This is so stupid, I hate posts that try to say one thing is 100% wrong because some other thing is 100% correct. There‚Äôs never any nuance on here. As always, both things are true.  Going from Bledsoe to Jrue Holiday is a ridiculous upgrade, the Bucks are clearly much better and more dangerous than they were last year. Bucks-Nets could end up being the best series of the whole postseason.  But just the same, Jimmy Butler was awful this year in the playoffs. Tyler Herro went from an up and coming star (which was stupid at the time) to just ‚Äúa guy‚Äù. Bam also went from a dominant force to a guy who was afraid to shoot a 10 foot jumper."
"Jimmy Butler and company fuckin suck, coaching is terrible and I'm not sure if you can call them pros , complete shit show"
So Jimmy Butler in the bubble?
my dude called jimmy butler coffee boy lol
"As a Heat fan, I‚Äôm embarrassed. We played with no effort, allowed open shot after open shot, and Jimmy Butler couldn‚Äôt hit anything to save his life. Our shooters have forgotten how to shoot. Half of our roster is old and can‚Äôt shoot. Our young guys don‚Äôt have enough playoff experience. For a team with a identity of defensive toughness and all-out effort, we showed none of that this series or this season. And, the ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù we made were laughable. The Bucks are a great team, but the Heat need to completely overhaul the roster if they want a chance to compete in the near future."
"Nah all year we‚Äôve been hearing how incredible Miami‚Äôs run in, how dominate jimmy butler is on both sides, how spo is just this genius and then they get swept. We can and will talk about both. Heat were frauds. Plain and simple"

Butler was rumored to want to come to Houston when we had CP and Harden and had just taken the warriors to 7. Harden and Jimmy was a combo a wanted to see so damn bad.
"Neither has Jimmy Butler. He couldn't even make the conference finals as what, the 3rd best player on his team? And also that round 2 opponent was the KD warriors."
Fucked in the head. Salty the Heat with Jimmy butler pulled them to 6 when all the bandwagon fans called it 4-0
Why are people turning on Jimmy Butler? He had a bad series. So did the greek freak the last 2 post seasons. shit happens.
Jimmy Butler is 5th in fta and 6th in free throw rate. LeBron would rank in like the 50s for free throw rate and would be around 20 in fta. Jimmy is a flopper these days.
"Jimmy Butler was a top 10/top 5 player, Bam was a Giannis stopper, and it wasn't worth trading Herro for Harden lol"
"How is Spo of all people your go-to for this, given a) he‚Äôs not white and b) he also made the Finals with Jimmy Butler and children a year ago?"
There‚Äôs a ton of hyperbolic kneejerk reactions here but you know what? I am all for it. Jimmy Butler deserves all of this for his entire tough guy ‚Äòalpha dog‚Äô toxic schtick.
I've always said Jimmy butler is fraud adjacent please stop talking all nba first team for this guy. I wouldn't be shocked if he just tanked the entire series
"All you can rely on is counting stats which is pretty weak, especially considering how slowly jimmy got to come along. Barely played his first year in the league. Right now he‚Äôs a way better more complete player than Jaylen Brown. Browns great but I don‚Äôt see how anyone picks him over Jimmy Butler right now"
"‚ÄúWe will get there, us as a team, I‚Äôll handle the rest.‚Äù - Jimmy Butler, 2021   He ain‚Äôt wrong though, now he‚Äôs resting early for his vacation."
nobody works harder at telling you how hard he works than jimmy butler
"clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game  ball is inbounded to Butler who turns face to face against Giannis  ""You took my family""  moves to the left  ""You took my friends""  moves to the right  ""You took all that was dear to me""  clock winds down to 2  ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for CULTURE, FOR HEAT CULTURE""  goes up, fire coming out of his shoes  ""I AM STUPIDLY LOCKED IN X4""  Ball flies over Giannis's head, over Khris' outstretched hand, goes straight into the Jrue's hand for an airball. Jimmy falls to the ground, exhausted.  ""Bam... Senpai... I...""  faints  Final Score  Bucks 120  Heat 103"
That Jimmy Butler isn't a star player
I am stupidly locked in.  -Jimmy Butler
yOu fUcKin' nEEd mE!  - Jimmy Butler
"Keep that Same Energy, Jimmy Butler."
Butler is better than Kawhi (saw this after Jimmy went to the finals)
Jimmy Butler &gt;&gt;&gt; Harden takes last year were disgusting
‚ÄúJimmy butler is a top 5-10 player‚Äù  Saw that all over after last year. Obviously looked like it in finals. Just a bad recency bias take. Was never and would never be consistent enough to actually be top 10. Still in the top 20 no doubt.
Imagine the shock of seeing Jimmy Butler turn back into Jimmy Butler.
"Dude, I just want to dunk on Jimmy Butler, ok?"
Then what happened to Herro this year?   What happened to you guys? I agree with you on the neutral nature of the bubble. I think that‚Äôs why a decade from now it will be looked back on as one of the most unique settings that produced anomalies in sports history.   You guys are like the case study. Jimmy Butler culture works when you have a bunch of pro athletes on lock down in their hotel rooms not able to live the lives of celebrities in Miami. I mean all you have to do is check Tyler‚Äôs Instagram to see the difference between the bubble and the normal NBA scene.   Normal NBA isn‚Äôt played where all the players are going back to hotel rooms like middle schoolers on an away trip. It isn‚Äôt played without fans.   So yes I agree on the neutrality. But that neutrality isn‚Äôt a reality any other year.
"Lol how did the wolves treat him terribly? Even if it was the wrong choice, the best way to get Towns, Wiggins and Butler on max contracts was to sign Wiggins with his bird rights and then sign Butler during the off-season with his. Jimmy just threw a hissyfit because he wanted his money immediately and wanted them to gut half the team mid season to make it happen."
"""Bucks fan here coming in peace. I just wanted to say GG's and great series! I know we swept you guys and blew you the fuck out the last 3 games but you guys sure made it tough! At least you guys have last year! ;)  By the way  Jimmy Butler is a DOG! He plays with HEART and GRIT! He's the kind of player I wouldn't mind having on my team! Tyler Herro is a future star FO SHO! Keep your chins up there's always next year!"""
"I mean Jimmy Butler performs famously well with 3rd stringers, shoulda just gone for it lol"
"So you applied the context that the Bucks got better by getting Jrue in exchange for Bledsoe while ignoring that the Raptors lost Kawhi, Ibaka, and Marc Gasol within these last two years and played zero home games while in a different country? Jimmy Butler just got exposed and deserves to get slandered for playing worse than PG, Siakam, etc. Hell he played worse than Andrew Wiggins if we're being real."
"Jimmy played like ass, he has to step up. He's my favorite player, but he has to be better if we want to win. Our best player cannot be shooting like 30 percent and score 12 points. Bam has to be more aggressive. We also need some defense on the wings besides Butler. We also need desperate help down low. Bam cannot be our only viable option in the paint."
"Miami still didnt play good. Id argue Herro, Robinson, and Bam had ZERO improvement. They‚Äôre the exact same players as last year.      and can‚Äôt forget how STUPIDLY locked in Jimmy Butler was...."
"Ben has scored more every single season than Rondo has in his best season. Not sure what the point of including that line is lol  Alongside Embiid, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, etc"
Giannis Clearly has a better understanding of what it‚Äôs going to require from him to get the bucks to the next level this year. He took the assignment the entire series to check Jimmy Butler which did not happen last year
jimmy butler is trash
‚ÄúIm so fucking locked up right now‚Äù   - Jimmy Butler
Did you watch the finals last year and honestly think Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt care about winning?
Jimmy Butler calls everyone soft..  *But what if he's actually the one who's soft??*
"As a sixers fan, I do not hate Jimmy Butler."
Jimmy Butler calls everyone soft..  *But what if he's actually the one who's soft??*
Jimmy Butler calls everyone soft..  *But what if he's actually the one who's soft??*
"Not a Heat or Bucks, but I was predicting the Heat would win in realistically 4 games...or possibly 5 games. Never did I imagine the Bucks would win, let alone sweep the Heat. Last year, I was predicting the Bucks would beat the Heat in 5 games but they got completely manhandled. It was embarrassing to watch and I‚Äôm not a Bucks fan but I was so confident they were the better team. So for this year, I noticed how nothing changed. Same players, same coach = same result. Well, I was wrong. There were some changes: Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe. Home court advantage does matter when it‚Äôs not in a noiseless bubble. Jimmy Butler and the Heat started very slow this season due to injuries. Butler never seemed to be 100% or half as good as he was in 2020. That goes to show the wear and tear, the duress and extended postseason has on you.   Most importantly, it really goes to show the importance of those first two games. Last year, Miami dominated Milwaukee and won some close ones against the Bucks which affects your psyche. This year, that Game 1 OT win by the Bucks really changed the outcome of this series. I think if the Heat had won it, the Heat would‚Äôve won this series. That Game 1 win by the Bucks finally gave them the confidence that they can beat the Heat. Meanwhile, it was a blow to the Heat for losing a gut-wrenching tightly contested game. The Bucks gained more confidence, the Heat lost some...and that dictated the rest of the series. And it can‚Äôt be oversold, Jrue Holiday is a much better player than Eric Bledsoe."
What about Jimmy Butler? Who literally rolls around on the ground and peaks to see if the refs have called a foul?
"Jimmy ""I am stupidly locked in"" Butler"
"1 of those things got corrected. The sad one, unfortunately.  I just keep thinking about Jimmy ""Locked in"" Butler and Bam "" Gotta be more aggressive x999"" Adebayo. Love those guys but sure sounds like bullshit right now"
Jimmy Butler is about to start bullying himself for that performance
Fuck dragic and fuck Jimmy butler and fuck Tyler herro and fuck Duncan robinson
The Heat are officially the worst team in the league and Jimmy Butler is trash haven't you heard?
You have Jimmy ‚Äûstupidly locked in‚Äú Butler who is talking a bit too much. So now you get shat on for his big mouth just like the Clippers and ‚ÄûPlayoff P‚Äú last year
"giannis did a great job and forced butler to shoot a lot of poor and uncomfortable shots, but jimmy also missed a lot of open shots and layups this series, he just couldn‚Äôt make a shot, he was like 30% from the field whole series ffs"
"When the Raps played them in the playoffs, we were massively undersized. There were times when the shortest player on the court for Philly was Jimmy Butler. Ben was never really an issue even when being defended by 5'11 Kyle Lowry..."
He‚Äôll never be worth that contract but he‚Äôs a functional starter on our team. I think people say this because he lacks the alpha dog personality of Jimmy Butler.
"Nowhere did I or anyone else say that. You‚Äôre  making assumptions to fit your narrative without actually addressing any coaching concerns I mention him having. Nate used the same playbook from the beginning of the season till the end all 4 years he was here. Mid range with some sabonis pick and roll. No way we beat the heat with how hot they were but we still had enough talent to not get embarrassed. 4 games in a row. Elite coaches make adjustments, and elevate their teams come playoff time. Speaking of the heat Spoelstra is a fine example of exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. The playoffs tend to be won with superstars and when you can take a team to the finals and take the lakers to six when your best player is jimmy butler that speaks highly of a coach who actually can affect the game. Not saying we had the caliber of roster as the heat but a more complete coach should help make that series at least slightly competitive and Nate simply didn‚Äôt."
"Well, at least Jimmy Butler doesn't. Look up any video involving him and a boat..."
Learning from Jimmy Butler fast
Jimmy butler isnt more famous than him
"They also are a lot younger with a lot of time to develop, including young dudes who are already injured and theyre doing super well without em.  Jimmy Butler was also like 30 in the bubble so I can see how the Heat have stagnated"
I think you are stereotyping nba athletes. You can do those things without going to Utah in addition that type of stuff is frowned upon. You got Jimmy Butler rolling over in his Kayak lol
&gt;Shit see if we can get Jimmy Butler back or something  Lol
Shit we have to get somebody. Ben isn't cutting it. He's a liability in crunch time.  Shit see if we can get Jimmy Butler back or something.
"Only NBA player who I know has a wingspan that is not largely above his height and a rather big torso is Jimmy Butler. I would say that I was a Jimmy Butler with even shorter arms, even smaller hands and obviously far less athletic and a lot less talented XD"
Lol at Jimmy Butler
Pretty dick move that he did here. Recruited to Jimmy Butler to the Heat so his Jazz wouldn‚Äôt have to play the Clippers or Lakers with Butler in the playoffs. Now Jimmy is stuck playing with Tyler Herro instead of Kawhi Leonard.
"A tale as old as time.   MJ, Kobe and others got rewarded years after they still played defense hard.   Hell, does Jimmy Butler really deserve to be on there?   all nba defense teams have always been kind of a joke. better than they used to be but still."
"There are only 4 other 1st team all-nba guys. So basically 4 teams in the whole league with a worthy opponent according to you. Chances are always low 1st team all-nba guys play against each other.   Like in the Warriors 2018 finals run they only faced one 1st team all-nba guy in the West--Harden. In their 2017 finals run they faced one 1st team all-nba guy--Kawhi--and he only played one half of one game.  That's just how it is especially for someone like Lebron who himself is always a 1st team all-nba guy/MVP candidate.  &gt;The best players on those teams were millsap, Old Chauncey/Lowry.  Lowry was great and is still great. Jimmy Butler was also on that Bulls team in 2015. You can't diminish Chauncey because of his age and not acknowledge Lebron's age at the time too. He was so young.  &gt;I‚Äôm saying the years where lebron didn‚Äôt have a super team and made it to the finals (07,15,18) he played extremely weak teams.  He also made the finals in 2020 and the Lakers weren't a superteam."
"&gt; Him and Jimmy Butler basically just trade off having good/bad playoffs.  agreed.   &gt; But it's not like he was consistently bad for 4 straight years.  he definitely wasn't consistently good though, and has been a bit overrated ever since his last year in Indiana imo. He's playing well now, but I just don't understand how people are surprised there was a lot of backlash against him after they went down 0-2 against a much worse Mavs team in the first round. It was so expected and so obvious."
"Yes, he did play poorly that series too. Him and Jimmy Butler basically just trade off having good/bad playoffs. Only one of them gets huge flack for it.  But it's not like he was consistently bad for 4 straight years."
jimmy butler is actually jordans son
"It's not the same. Typically when you talk about a shot creator it's more like a guy who can handle the ball and create a shot for themselves. I guess I could have been clearer.  Think about the role Jimmy Butler used to play for Philly.     Of the guys you listed below, Tobias is really the only passable example you guys have and he's decent not elite.   Elite offensive teams have multiple guys who can put up 15-30ppg mostly scoring off the dribble.  1. Giannis, Middleton, Jrue (and even here, Middleton is often their best half-court shot-creator over Giannis)  2. Durant, Harden, Kyrie  3. Westbrook, Beal  4. Donovan, Conley, Clarkson, Bojan, Ingles   5. Dame, CJ, Powell  And it becomes a lot more relevant the deeper you go into the playoffs because the game slows down and you lose a lot of other scoring opportunities.   Philly is pretty short-staffed in that regard and it means Embiid has to do more on his own because he can't just give the ball to someone and let them lead while he has a break.  * Simmons struggles in the halfcourt * Tobias gets stopped too easily * The shooters need help getting their shots off  &gt;We have a lot of shot creators with off ball movement  You need additional scorers who are more than glorified wide receivers who 'make plays' by getting open.   &gt;second half it wasn‚Äôt there  That's because the game is slowing down.  Typically basketball slows down later in the game and later in the playoffs. When the game really slows down is when you really need shot creators.  This is why Philly keeps hitting these invisible walls after looking dominant all season and in the 1st round.   It's also why Kyle Lowry was such an exciting trade prospect for Philly this season. Replacing a shooter or two with a guy who can shoot **and** create would have had a huge impact on your half-court offence."
"Forgot Kawhi, maybe Jimmy Butler, KAT? Trae is definitely top 20 though"
Ben for Jimmy Butler
"Who learned to shoot after 25? No one. Jimmy Butler is the only guy I can think of who developed a shot ""late"" and it was after his third season."
I miss Jimmy Butler‚Ä¶.
Yeah most of our fanbase was upset that we had to keep Tobi instead of keeping jimmy butler.   We were wrong.
"And yet, in addition to holding his opponents to a much lower field goal percentage, mattisse still outperformed him in most defensive counting stats except rebounds, which he's never asked to do, and deflections, which Matisse wasn't that far behind (and tied with Marcus smart and Jimmy Butler)."
"Aged like milk my dear casual nephew   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard"
Jimmy Butler? Kawhi?
"So my dear Casual nephew, as I told  Here the results   2020-21 NBA All-Defensive teams:  First team: Rudy Gobert, Ben Simmons, Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday  Second team: Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Matisse Thybulle, Kawhi Leonard  https://mobile.twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1404574866418900999"
It means nothing in the case of Steph Curry leading the league  It means something in the context of Jimmy Butler who is a KNOWN GREAT DEFENDER leading the league  All I said was context matters and in this context it shows Jimmy Butler still deserves All-Defensive honors
"why not add in Klay Thompson and Draymond Green while youre at it? But why stop there!? Let's fill out our bench with Jrue, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, AD, and Valencunias?"
1st   Gobert-Giannis-Draymond-Jrue-Simmons   2nd   Embiid-Bam-Jimmy Butler-Smart-Thybulle   These are again my predictions not what I would have per se necessarily
1st G - Stephen Curry G - Damian Lillard  F - Luka Doncic F - Giannis  C - Nikola Jokic  2nd G - Chris Paul G - Jimmy Butler F - Kawhi Leonard  F - Julius Randle C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kyrie Irving G - Paul George  F - Jayson Tatum  F - Lebron James C - Rudy Gobert
Jimmy Butler.
Worse scoring better defending peak Jimmy Butler
Saying he‚Äôd be a ‚Äújimmy butler type player‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôd literally be jimmy butler lol
A better Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler type in that he lifts teams to new heights. Not really an offensive juggernaut but a capable scorer, playmaking orientated and lockdown defender. I think he‚Äôd be a top 10 player today."
He should be tier 3 imo. The defensive impact does not make him a better player than someone like jimmy butler
Lol if you think MJ was like butler then ur kidding urself. Jimmy couldn‚Äôt even lace MJs shoes on level of ass hole. MJ is king asshole
"Well even looking at the list.   Kemba at 9 - he was coming off a great NCAA career but was a very undersized player for the NBA  Klay Thompson - great shooter/3&amp;D wing but this was before the 3 point explosion. Was tough to predict his value exploding like it did. Also a 3 year college player   Kawhi - played at a small school and couldn‚Äôt shoot really. Improved an insane amount in the NBA  Jimmy Butler - went from being a PF in college to a skilled guard in the NBA. Came into the NBA as a raw hustle player. Had multiple MIP caliber seasons after he was drafted.   Vuc - 3 year player. Was a seen as a decent pick, but there were younger bigs who looked more promising (Kanter, JV, Biyombo, Thompson).  Hindsight makes evaluating players a lot easier, but at the time a lot of these guys had reasons for not being considered better, and some of it was related to the league changing, some was related to players improving a lot after they made the league."
"This sub is ridiculous.  Jimmy Butler is one of the most impactful players in the league and will add value to literally any team he's on. The Nuggets would accept MPJ for Butler straight up any day of the week. Shooters are everywhere in this league, ya know whats not? Players anywhere near as good as Butler."
"I think it‚Äôs a bad move for Denver. MPJ is 6‚Äô8+ with a handle, shot, great scorning touch, and could be a great defender if he gives the effort just because of his size. He‚Äôs only like22/23 his ceiling will be high than what you‚Äôll get out of a 33+ year old Jimmy Butler at this point. They‚Äôve done a great job developing their young stars I think if they get healthy they‚Äôre contenders. Don‚Äôt leverage away your future for stars in their 30s look at Brooklyn now. 2 of their 3 guys injured with no depth because they traded it away."
That locker room was up there with any non-Miami Jimmy Butler team for the most toxic environment I‚Äôve ever seen.
"&gt;Eh the only thing though is Davis ability to switch pick n rolls and seemingly guard everybody.   I agree that motivated Davis makes their defense better.  Unfortunately, Davis is only occasionally so motivated, which drastically reduces that effect.  On the other hand, Ball, Hart, Hunter, Bonga, and Zubac are all good defenders -- so a clever coach would have tons of options to match up with various opponents.  &gt;It literally is like a video game rating. Having the 90 overall player is just better than having a couple 84 players. The 90 can just be more consistent  Consistent?  No.  As Davis showed when he skipped game 1 against the Suns, and when he barely cared during the regular season as well.  At his best, Davis is better than most pairs of other players, but between his health and his attitude, you only get that Davis occasionally.  And that's a major problem.  And even when he does show up, opponents can double team one player.  They cannot double-team two, or three, or more, which is partly the value of depth.  &gt;So it really is hard to say which is the right decision here.   We really cannot say for years, until we see what becomes of the assets the Lakers spent.  What we can say now, with certainty, is that Jimmy Butler was traded the same day, for pennies, and having seen Butler in Orlando, we can be sure the Lakers would've won that title with him instead of Davis... and kept almost all of those assets.  That being the case, one has to conclude that the Davis rental was a bad choice.  Signing him as a free agent is up in the air, but the rental was not a wise decision."
"Ok but come on, draft position is pointless once these dudes are in the league. Unless you think it'd be more impressive to win with Kawhi than with former #1 overall pick Anthony Bennet. Plenty of lottery dudes bust (the Knicks currently have at least a couple on their roster!). Kawhi was arguably a top 3-5 player in the league when the Raps traded for him. This wasn't 2014 where everyone was going ""Whoa, who tf is this dude??"" Marc Gasol was a former DPOY and was the best player on those grit n grind Grizzlies teams and while past his prime, was still clearly effective. Who cares if he was a 2nd rounder a decade beforehand? The guy was a star when they acquired him. That'd be like saying last year's Heat team was impressive because Jimmy Butler wasn't a lottery pick.  This isn't taking anything away from how impressive their title was, but let's not revisionist history this shit by saying they had a bunch of bums no one wanted on their squad."
thats just not true. the best defenders know how to guard w/o fouling like kawhi or jimmy butler
Lakers didn't face that one. They faced Jimmy Butler and others
JImmy Butler sux
"Like for example, a 25 pt game from Jimmy Butler is different from a 25 pt game from Andrew Wiggins. They can both have identical stat lines, but the feel and impact are different from the two players."
WHO ELSE IS KD GONNA RECRUIT AFTER????? JIMMY BUTLER???
I don't know the Nets players on the court now 24 (I think?) and 4(?) look like failed clones of Jimmy Butler and Zach LaVine
"If you think Jimmy Butler left because we sometimes boo shit performances, then you've demonstrated your understanding of Sixers knowledge."
It‚Äôs been 7 years. How many teams during that time period have got players better then prime Jimmy Butler? Golden state getting Durant is one. Clippers getting Kawhi. Lakers lebron. Cavs getting Lebron I guess technically too. Can‚Äôt think of any others.
Jimmy Butler Sixers &gt; Jimmy Butler Heat and it's not even close lol.
Cause they're trapped by their contracts. Thats why no big name free agent is gonna sign with philly and jimmy butler left
And apparently the prostitutes loved Jimmy Butler rofl
"Ben Taylor, the creator of Thinking Basketball, has a metric called PlayVal, which is described as ""Playmaking value, an estimate of a player‚Äôs points per 100 impact from playmaking only.""  According to this metric for the 2020-21 season (regular season), the top 10 players for this stat are:  1. James Harden 2. Nikola Jokic 3. Trae Young 4. Luka Doncic 5. Damian Lillard 6. Chris Paul 7. LeBron James 8. Kyrie Irving 9. Jimmy Butler 10. DeMar DeRozan"
"&gt;No, winning a championship is an automatic success.  No.  Simply put, you are one-hundred percent wrong.  A team can lose a trade -- badly -- and still win a title in the same season.  Not only has been done, but the Lakers have done it in the past.  That you are ignorant of basic basketball history does not bode well for you in this conversation.  &gt;A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  They are the Lakers, a championship is always in sight.  &gt;You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core.  And you're forgetting that we are talking about LeBron James -- who had already won with lesser teams.  &gt;Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers.  You don't know that at all.  Maybe he learns from James and is even better.  &gt; We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless.  Yes, they would have.  They traded Zubac to make financial room for Davis.  &gt;No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even.  Green would've been on the bench anyway, behind better players.  Howard, too.  There's also no guarantee better players don't sign with the Lakers, seeing an opportunity that didn't exist alongside Davis.  &gt;They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster.   They didn't even play the Clippers.  What the hell are you talking about?  Please learn thing one about the topic at hand.  &gt;Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season).   Ingram and Ball both would've been the best shooters on that team from the arc -- with obvious benefits to all of their teammates including James.  &gt;Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity.   Their defense would not have been as good -- but their offense and bench would've been miles better.  Ingram alone replaces Davis' offensive production.  Zubac is much better than McGee and Howard, and Ball is miles better than Green.  &gt;Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season  Inconsistent?  Like Davis, you mean?  Who took to firing up threes at 33% last year, and 26% this season?  &gt;2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option)  Two or even three players does not make a team.  That Cleveland team featured Irving shooting 32% from three that season, and Love at 36%.  Neither played a lick of defense.  They were playing Matthew Dellevedova half of each game, and Mozgov started more than half of their games.  You need to do much better getting simple facts correct, before you move on to theories.  &gt;, they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's  See above regarding Cleveland's shooting.  And again, Ball and Ingram last year would've been the two best shooters on that Laker roster, so you are talking utter nonsense here.  &gt;3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram wouldn't have been against contenders).  You've no way to know that, but even if so, they could've had Jimmy Butler for a pittance, compared to what they blew to rent Davis -- as I already mentioned.  &gt;I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety.  Should not take long, since the relevant players rarely played together.  It's almost like that may have mattered?  &gt;The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.  Clearly the answer is, ""Far better than you do"".  &gt;It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season.  It precisely does work like that.  NBA players in the bubble were as-rested as any of them will be, until they retire.  That six-month vacation -- with almost no organized basketball available -- was for most, the only time in their lives between about the ages of about 10 and 35 where they will be healthy, and not balling.  There is absolutely no reason that any of them should have been worn out after playing at-most 29 games.  Any that were worn-out can not handle a full NBA season -- which has been the case throughout Davis' career.  &gt; Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  Sounds like we're talking about an injury-prone player, and maybe one you don't want to trade 7 players, 3 picks, and a swap for.  &gt;The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.  Davis has played over 68 games only twice so far in his career, and never more than 75.  &gt;If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't.   Look, if you cannot do simple arithmetic, discontinue wasting my time.  5 Championships in 20 years is exactly 2.5 per decade.  &gt;Even if the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting.  Look, learn thing one about the topic, or again, discontinue this nonsense.  Butler was not in Minnesota.  You are embarrassing yourself here.  &gt;No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries.   Davis suffering an injury is not a freak occurrence.  The freak occurrence was 2020 when he didn't.  &gt;Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  This is so fantastically ignorant that I'm almost speechless.  The Lakers don't win one title and call it a day.  Other franchises would love to, but the Lakers' standard is miles higher than that.  They fired a GM who won 5 rings for them, which is unprecedented ( and probably a mistake ).  &gt;Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  Again, these are the risks one has to take in order to build through free-agency.  I'm sure I just explained this, so I don't know why you couldn't read it.  This is precisely also the problem with spending a decade of draft assets to rent Davis -- it will force the Lakers to take more risks of this nature, and some will backfire like the Deng contract did.  &gt;Only if you have other options. Which they didn't.  For the final time, learn thing one about the topic at hand.  Jimmy Butler was traded the very same day, for almost nothing.  One additional point.  Learn how to use reddit.  One does not copy unrelated comments into one gigantic pile.  If you cannot even figure that out, once again, please discontinue here.  Respond in the appropriate threads."
"&gt;It might be. We won't really know for a decade or so, when we know more about how much, exactly, they gave up to rent one player for one season.  No, winning a championship is an automatic success. Davis could've walked away in free agency after the chip and it still would've been worth it. A championship wasn't even in sight prior to that lol.  &gt;The Lakers quite likely would've won last year even without overpaying for Davis... James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year  You're forgetting how suboptimal LeBron's fit was with that core. Even for them to have remotely a chance of competing, Ingram would have to be an all-star level 2nd option. It's easy to look back with hindsight, but Ingram doesn't develop into an all-star staying on the Lakers. We wouldn't have had Zubac regardless. No guarantee Green would sign with that roster. Or Howard even. They're definitely not getting past that Clippers squad with that roster. Suboptimal fit and talent (despite your depth claim, Ingram and Lonzo wouldn't have been reliable and were largely inconsistent the previous season). Couldn't have defended nearly as well either without Davis helping create that identity. Not having LeBron as the PG also gives him more offensive responsibilities and leaves even lesser energy for defense than normal. I could go on. The Davis signing was such a catalyst for so many of that 2020 team's success.  &gt;You're wrong.  No, they were right.   &gt;James has won with less.  No, he hasn't. 2012-13 Mia and 2016 Cle were not only more talented with bonafide 2nd option all-stars (with Bosh being a reliable 3rd option and Love being a somewhat reliable 3rd option), they also had a much, much better fit (especially with people who could actually hit 3's, that 18-19 squad was awful with the 3). James was also younger and didn't have to defer nearly as much as he needs to now to a reliable 2nd option (which Ingram _wouldn't_ have been against contenders).  &gt;I invite you to research the above statements before replying. If necessary, search my comment history, as I've covered these topics repeatedly for other similarly-uninformed people.  I invite you to rewatch their 2018-2019 season in its entirety. The claim that they would've been contenders with a high chance of winning with your suggested roster is absolute hogwash and uninformed; it _absolutely_ ignores the fundamental issues they had that season. The issues were so conceptually and fundamentally wrong, and that roster would've matched up so poorly against the other contenders, it makes me question how much you actually understand the actual sport.   &gt; And while the offseason was short, it was preceded 29 games earlier by a six-month vacation  It doesn't work like that lol. Having a 6 month break before those 29 games doesn't suddenly mean you won't need notable time to rest before the next season. Especially when you're playing at the highest level with the shortest time in between games. And especially especially when you're dealing with an achilles problem after the playoffs.  &gt;""Dude"" has been injured almost every season.   The last time injuries kept him out for a substantial amount of games was the 2015-16 season. The injury-prone tag is overblown.   &gt;The point which just zoomed over your head is that if you trade every young player because they haven't accomplished anything yet, you will be sorry.  You *might be sorry. Good thing they won though.  &gt;More to the point, even before 2020, they were exactly on their historic pace of 2.5 Rings per decade in this century. So, you are talking absolute nonsense.  If you mean before the Davis trade, they weren't. At all. But now with him, they have a real chance to achieve that 2.5 average. Good on them.  &gt;Not only that, but they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020. In this case, the Lakers retain substantially all of the assets they spent to rent Davis.  Even _if_ the wolves wanted to lend us a hand, that's a starting 5 with even worse shooting. Zubac wouldn't have been there, either.  &gt; It already looks very questionable, and can only get worse. Some of those first-round picks are still years away -- exactly when the Lakers will need them, by the way.  No, it looks great. They won the chip and would've had a great chance at repeating if not for freak injuries. Need them? Nah, their window to compete is now. Wouldn't matter later on.  &gt;And a questionable motor, to boot.  Not really. I hope you're not basing that on this injury-riddled year and post-season lol. Cause that would be too ridiculous. Even with the post-season he was getting back to his dominant self in games 2 and 3.  &gt;That said, Deng was a 31 year-old 2-time All-star. 4 x $16m was not at all outrageous.   Except if you actually watched Deng the year prior, you would absolutely know that that was outrageous. I like how you mention ""all-star"" too as if that was even somehow relevant to the time of the signing lol.  &gt;that's probably too much to spend for one ring.  Only if you have other options. Which they didn't. That roster you that claimed would be a favorited contender (that was supposedly even better than some of James' past championship teams) is nonsense. You could literally do a multi-part video series on how they'd be picked apart by the other contenders in the playoffs."
"&gt;I don‚Äôt think they come close to winning that title without AD.  You're wrong.  &gt;None of them are good enough to be the second best player on a championship team in lebrons window  James has won with less.  &gt;Those kids the Lakers traded aren‚Äôt Steph and Klay.  That was just one of many such examples.  The point which just zoomed over your head is that if you trade every young player because they haven't accomplished anything yet, you will be sorry.  That said, the next time Thompson averages more points per game than Ingram has the past two seasons, will be the first.  &gt;IMO you are overrating BI,Ball and Hart. They are (currently) not the players to bring you a title.  Again, James has won with less.  More to the point, you are typically uninformed, as I suspected, even though I invited you to do some research before making a dumb reply.  You are failing to consider the breadth of that trade, and the other options.  Since I've had to explain this to dozens of similarly-ignorant people, I will just cut-and-paste here.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year, and would've had a very good chance to win. Certainly no one in the West beats them. Miami would've had a chance.      Not only that, but they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020.  In this case, the Lakers retain substantially all of the assets they spent to rent Davis.      With Bradley during the regular season, that Laker bench alone is a playoff team in the East, and James has won titles with far less than the team they'd have had without Davis."
"&gt;AD is at worst a borderline superstar in the beginning of his prime.  No, at worst he's Greg Oden.  &gt;That‚Äôs the best possible piece to have both now and in the long term.  No, it's not, first of all, and secondly, there's no requirement to have only one piece.  They traded eleven pieces to rent Davis for one season.  &gt;We‚Äôve also seen time and time again that elite top-level talent beats out great depth more often than not.  Even if that were true, and it's a questionable premise, they could've had Jimmy Butler for practically free in comparison, as I just said.  &gt; the AD trade is the absolute worst one to criticize.  It already looks very questionable, and can only get worse.  Some of those first-round picks are still years away -- exactly when the Lakers will need them, by the way."
"I don‚Äôt like watching Kawhi,Jimmy Butler,Harden,traeand am on the fence about Luka"
Kawhi and Jimmy Butler
"&gt;Lmao you‚Äôre telling me trading a bunch of young kids that hadn‚Äôt proved anything for an arguably top 5 player who helped deliver a title was ‚Äúhamstringing‚Äù their future?  Yes, precisely.  This is not hard to understand.  They traded seven players, 3 picks, and a swap for a player they could've signed as a free agent the following off-season.  That's more than has ever been traded for one player, rental or otherwise.  Only a couple trades are even close -- like when the Lakers acquired 14 years of Abdul-Jabbar, probably for less than 1 season of Davis cost.  At one point in time, every player was ""a young kid that hadn't proved anything"", but that doesn't mean you should trade them.  The Lakers quite likely would've won last year even without overpaying for Davis.  I've had to explain this many times, so I will simply cut-and-paste from a previous comment.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year, and would've had a very good chance to win.  Certainly no one in the West beats them.  Miami would've had a chance.      Not only that, they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis. Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and some of that bench wins easily in 2020.  With Bradley during the regular season, that Laker bench alone is a playoff team in the East, and James has won titles with far less than the team they'd have had without Davis."
Not sure how the personalities would‚Äôve meshed though. Could‚Äôve been another Jimmy Butler situation. Although CP3 seems to get along with Ayton and Booker alright so who knows. Winning solves most problems.
It's gotta be Jimmy Butler
This guy is way better than Jimmy Butler. Sixers made the right choice honestly.
And that required one of the best individual performances in finals history (Jimmy Butler)
MPJ for Jimmy Butler
"1. Nikola Jokic 2. Derrick Rose 3. Jimmy Butler  4. Giannis 5. Joe Ingles         Joker is fresh on my mind after the game but I tried to avoid putting on the really really young guys like Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell and Devin Booker excetera, as far as Joe Ingles I like the what can I say lol"
Why do some people even have votes?!  Why did someone vote jimmy butler all nba first team.
Pretty big difference between kat now and lebron with already 3 chips on his shoulder. I shit on lebron anyways though.  No veteran player (jimmy butler) ever came out in public and questioned books work ethic. KAT on the other hand....
Whos watches the t wolves? Once i see KAT do that in the playoffs ill believe you. Which probably wont happen. Seeing as he has no intangibles- according to jimmy butler
But the problem about KAT is the motivation. You have one of the loud leaders are jimmy butler and can‚Äôt perform with him. Just doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to be great. He was once compared to jokic and embiid.
The last game he played he dropped like 20 in 10 minutes lol &amp; that was still more than jimmy butler at the end of the game.
Jimmy Butler.
"I forget who it was, maybe Jimmy Butler, that almost clocked by one flying by"
Jimmy Butler definitely has an argument
Maybe KAT should hire the guy the next time they play jimmy Butler and the heat
LeBron and Embiid are also significantly better than Butler. Jimmy has less leeway for missed games compared to top 5 players.
"The LEBRON stats would support your claim.   &amp;#x200B;  |Name|DLEBRON|OLEBRON|LEBRON| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Nikola Jokic|0.61|6.22|6.83| |Rudy Gobert|5.09|1.00|6.10| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|1.98|3.59|5.57| |Joel Embiid|1.54|4.02|5.56| |LeBron James|1.38|3.88|5.26| |Stephen Curry|\-0.70|5.93|5.24| |Kawhi Leonard|1.28|3.62|4.90| |Luka Doncic|\-0.74|4.76|4.02| |Damian Lillard|\-1.73|5.46|3.74| |James Harden|\-0.80|4.49|3.69| |Anthony Davis|1.67|1.84|3.51|  The data comes from here.   https://www.bball-index.com/2020-21-lebron-data/  It is interesting to see that according to this stat Jokic (MVP) and Gobert (DPLOY) are as impactful as each other but Jokic offensively and Gobery defensively.   Also I find it interesting that of the people you named, you got most of the top in the league but missed a few. Jimmy Butler (LEBRON 5.56), Paul George (LEBRON 4.30), Jayson Tatum (LEBRON 3.99) , Zion Williamson (LEBRON 3.78)."
Nah. Bubble doesnt count. Unless you believe Jimmy Butler has proven he can be the best player on a title squad and Tyler Herro is the next Devin Booker.
"I remember Jimmy Butler being hated, not any anti-KAT stuff."
lol no once remembers the Jimmy butler stuff?
They got jimmy vutler as their #1 option bruh. What‚Äôs you expect? Give them a break lol. Jimmy butler would be a good #3
"Jimmy Butler. Also he was 100% right about KAT, Wiggins, and the Wolves."
Pretty sure he watched some Jimmy Butler tape recently
A lot of people did before the COVID stuff and during the Jimmy Butler saga
He needs to watch some Jimmy Butler tape. The Bucks have enough shooting around him that he should be able to play from the perimeter without feeling forced to take these open threes.
Idk if he‚Äôs unknown enough but Mikal Bridges I think is going to grow from being a great 3 and D wing into a legit 2 way star in the mold of Paul George or Jimmy Butler
"Best part of that clip is actually at the end, when MCW's leaving having fouled out. The announcers are congratulating him on having had a good game as a surprise replacement for Jimmy Butler, who'd been a last-minute scratch -- and one announcer says: ""Look, Butler's a good player, but could he have had 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists like MCW did?""  Yes; yes, he could. That's a very good start line, no doubt -- especially for MCW -- but I'm quite sure Jimmy Butler would have been capable of 23/9/6."
"Jimmy Butler:  22/7/7, 61% TS  Best defender of the group, likely all defense selection, leading the league in steals  7.5 BPM, 0.255 WS/48, 8.6 RAPTOR WAR, 6.1 Total RAPTOR, 5.56 LEBRON  Chris Paul:   16/5/9, 60% TS  Elite defender, but not as good as Jimmy  4.7 BPM, 0.201 WS/48, 7.7 RAPTOR WAR, 3.4 Total RAPTOR, 3.5 LEBRON  Bradley Beal:   31/5/4, 59% TS  Not a good defender at all  3.2 BPM, 0.132 WS/48, 7.3 RAPTOR WAR, 3.3 Total RAPTOR, 2.77 LEBRON   Notes: the one advanced stat that they're even close in, RAPTOR WAR, is a total stat, meaning playing more games gives you an advantage in the stat, Jimmy played 52 games to Beal's 60 and Paul's 70.    Chris Paul has been really good this year, great ceiling raiser for the Suns, Beal has been a fantastic volume scorer, but Jimmy was the overall better player of the 3."
"Boston started it and kd, harden, kawhi, cp3, jimmy butler, Lowry, Westbrook, kyrie, Shaq, Charles Barkley himself, and a bunch others all switched teams numerous times. Even wilt chamberlain forced his way to other teams."
"Why would every disadvantage not also apply to the Lakers?  And what's your source for your claim that everyone was checked out? *Plenty* of players seemed like the exact opposite, like they were totally locked in. See: Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Devin Booker, Nikola Jokic, etc  Like it honestly seems like you completely just pulled that out of your ass because one or two players voiced their struggles, no offense"

Lebron  Kawhi  KD  Harden  Steph  Giannis  AD  Jokic  Embiid  Dame  Luka  PG13  CP3  Kyrie  Tatum  Westbrook  Jimmy Butler  Donovan Mitchell  Rudy Gobert   So around the 18-19 range
"Google ""jimmy butler asshole""  You'll get plenty of links"
"As a finals team...? The starting line up for Game 3 of the NBA finals were Jimmy Butler, Duncan Robinson, Jae Crowder, Tyler Herro and Meyers Leonard. With Nunn, 36 year old iggy and Olynyk off the bench...The starting line up was literally Jimmy, Crowder and 3 white guys that play absolutely no defence"
"Yeah, that was my suspicion. The top 15 is stupidly stacked. Your list doesn‚Äôt even include guys like Bradley Beal or Jimmy Butler.   I think Gobert is probably top 20. His defensive value is undeniable and he‚Äôs no useless stiff on offense. But people should remember just how many great players there are in this league when it comes to these lists."
"KD was never going there. This is just as bad as those Philly missed out on Butler stories. Jimmy Butler was not coming back to Philly, even if they did make whatever moves he wanted. Miami was a better fit anyway."
"Going into the tax for such little difference makers would have been pointless  We were in negotiations for a Jimmy Butler trade with the Wolves for months. A move that would put us over into the tax. Our org was gonna do it, Thibs didn‚Äôt want picks though so he didn‚Äôt take it.   That‚Äôs a move that would have been a difference maker and put us into the tax. There is absolutely no reason to pay tax amounts of money to keep Ryno, especially if Melton is all it would take to lose him. Or pay Ariza 50m after tax inclinations   I blame Morey way more for his not being able to bring in an adequate supporting cast after 2018. Pretty much every player he picked up other than House and maybe Rivers (who was short but he fit well) was bad for us."
"What about Jimmy Butler? Lol. I realize the Heat shit the bed, but are we just going to forget what he did last year in The Finals?"
"Let's also remember that although CP3 and Jimmy Butler might be similar in some ways, their approach to young teammates might be completely different."
I‚Äôm a heat fan. I‚Äôm definitely taking Dame over Butler my guy. What Jimmy does is great and his heart and desire to win is admirable. But what Dame does imo is what you want in a franchise guy. He‚Äôs a cold blooded assassin. Jimmy‚Äôs the guy you want being the #2 for someone like Dame. That‚Äôs where he would thrive.
"I am a fan of the irreverent one like Gary ""Garry Harris"" Harris. Or, Sauce Castillo for stauskas  Edit: James ""literally Jimmy"" Butler"
Not sure I remember that Jimmy Butler narrative‚Ä¶he made Wiggins cry and was better than Embiid and Simmons before moving to Miami to get paid
"[Bro, Butler's hairline is elite too](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jimmy-Butler-Haircut-Mid-Skin-Fade-Sponge-Twists.jpg)"
Jimmy Butler wishes he could be as skilled snd have a hairline as good as PG‚Äôs     Not to mention Jimmy Butler had a &lt;40%TS this year so he undid all his goodwill and then some more damage
"Don't have many strong feelings about Butler, he was a late 1st rounder (actually the last 1st round pick at 30th overall) that grinded his way into the rotation then kept improving like  MIP &gt; All-Star &gt; All-NBA.  We got a decent return for Jimmy when he was traded, I'm not trippin'  I'm happy for him that he's found a team in the Miami Heat with a culture that fits his personality."
Jimmy Butler and Chicago
"Don't forget we played a tired Nuggets team, Lillard got hurt towards the end of the series, and a tired Jimmy Butler/young Heat team last year lol.  We too got blessed by the Basketball Gods haha"
"Don‚Äôt blame Paul for this, blame the shittiest refs in professional sports for how terrible they are at their jobs.  You cannot watch a single game anymore without a seeing a dozen egregious calls or missed calls made by the refs.  They are god awful! Why not flop when all it takes is for you to fall in an animated fashion and refs who you know didn‚Äôt see anything happen, to make a guess and give you a call.  I love the game, but damn, it is tough to watch and in no way do I trust the results.  Watching grown men fall like a ton of bricks when another player taps them, but yet quickly puff up their chests when they are disrespected is fucking hilarious.  The way they fall, no doubt my 5-9 190 pound self would beat the shit out of 90% of the league (bam adebayo, jimmy butler, Blake Griffin, watch your backs.  Im fucking you up when I see you lol)"
I hppe the suns can win it all. Last year we were teased with jimmy butler almost making it all the way i dont wanna see cp3 get so close and lose
"Right now, Jimmy Butler is aging better than I thought he would. He played so many minutes with Thibs and he still can't shoot...seemed like a recipe for a bad aging curve, but he just had arguably the best year of his career at 31. There's a lot of guys who were pretty good who wound up out of the league or at the end of somebody's bench by 31."
He's gassed. He was bound to run out of steam. Like Jimmy Butler in the finals duel with LeBron. That's why Kawhi lasting until the finals was amazing in 2019. That's why fucking LeBron is a cyborg.   Props to PG13's 2021 playoff run
" Bruh ur a clippers fan did u not see what Luka was doing to ur team lol.  He is most def more skilled and a better player than Jimmy Butler. Yeah, he has achieved less, but Butler had more help+ he was in the east."
"I'll freely admit I don't watch much TWolves either so me answering this would be the blind leading the blind haha!  What I will say is that I'm a big believer that players are different in different situations (see Reggie Jackson's resurgence in the playoffs right now). Unfortunately, I'm also a big believer in player character and according to Jimmy Butler, KAT doesn't seem to have the best motor."
Jimmy Butler would legit bully Kevin Love for his mental health issues
Sadly Jimmy Butler assassinated KAT‚Äôs character so people think he‚Äôs trash/soft compared to other bigs. Meanwhile he‚Äôs out there getting outplayed by Bryn Forbes lmfao
Lmao Trae getting the Jimmy Butler treatment now. Put Reggie Jackson ove Jayson Tatum for me too please
Jesus Christ y'all saying yes are the same ones who put Jimmy Butler as Top 10 from his bubble shit last year.  When will people learn not to use recency bias?
"Depends how you rank players. Personally I try not to rank players for things I think they could do. I mean I‚Äôm certain that Luka is a top 5, maybe even top 3 talent in the league, but it‚Äôd be hard for me to put him ahead of someone like Jimmy butler, who definitely isn‚Äôt more talented but has lead a team to the finals and translated his skillset into winning important games. What I think would happen if Luka was on a team as good as the 20 heat is irrelevant.   I think Paul George has already pretty much moved into the top 8."
For a lot of fans in Philly it was Jimmy Butler
"I wasn't sure about including Kobe but when it comes to SG's this decade it's Harden and then I don't think anyone comes close. The only other players I could think of was Dwyane Wade, Jimmy Butler and DeMar DeRozan lol"
"&gt;It‚Äôs a problem because basketball is an extremely high variance game. Paul George didn‚Äôt suddenly take a massive leap at age 31.  You're acting like Paul George is some scrub without his performance in these playoffs. If an allstar/fringe superstar caliber player plays like a finals MVP level player for an extended period of time, then he deserves recognition. This ain't Corey Brewer's 50 point game.   PG is already close to top 10 caliber, a terrific playoff run absolutely gets him at least in the discussion.   &gt;Is Jimmy Butler a top 40 player - yes or no  Yes, because again this ain't corey brewer falling back to earth. You're acting like he was pure trash this year after one brief good performance last year, but that's not the case at all."
"&gt;why is that a problem  It‚Äôs a problem because basketball is an extremely high variance game. Paul George didn‚Äôt suddenly take a massive leap at age 31.   Is Jimmy Butler a top 40 player - yes or no? Remember, your answer has to be *heavily* influenced by recent events."
I‚Äôm not talking about top 10 greatest careers. I‚Äôm talking about top 10 current players.  Do you think Jimmy Butler is a top 40 player in the league? He certainly didn‚Äôt play like one this postseason.
The way I see it Paul George has always been this player. He‚Äôs reached similar highs multiple times throughout his career. He didn‚Äôt suddenly take a massive leap at age 31.  Another reason is that basketball is a high variance sport. Using the past few seasons as opposed to just one also helps account for that variance. For example Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt even play like a top 40 player this postseason. Are there really 40 players you‚Äôd rather have on your team going into next season?
That's what was said about Jimmy Butler last a season and now his not even in anyone's top 15
"Yeh..  let's blame the COACH Doc Rivers again and scapegoat him.. because the superstar Point Guard of the team played like Lonzo Ball in a MUST WIN game, and Embiid (who has more shit post tweets than games played in his career) wasn't that good either when it mattered the most.    But then, he just threw his point guard under the bus Post Game.. Quite publicly.   GREAT LEADERSHIP.  GREAT LOCKER ROOM PRESENCE  &gt;  But hey, let's all blame DOC RIVERS and all other coaches instead. Why not..  &gt;   And of course this shit ignorant post would be in the Front Page of r/nba lol   Fuckin IDIOTS  &gt;   **EDIT**:  And Giannis definitely DIDN'T choke and get horribly LOCKED DOWN by Kawhi and Siakam in 2019 ECF,   Jimmy Butler in 2020 FIRST ROUND, and this season vs Trae Young and the Hawks in another ECF.   Definitely not   &gt;  And the funniest thing is, Giannis looked completely different in all of those Regular seasons.  They gave him the MVPs too.  No one blamed the 'coach' then.  Actually gave him awards as well, and all the praise    But in the playoffs, Giannis just shrinks.. like most other *regular season superstars*   Still, let's blame the coach instead then.  Big brain"
100%. You knew this when he took the ball out of Simmons hands and gave it to butler. He had the vision to realize jimmy could actually get things done at the end of games and Ben can‚Äôt.
The game has much higher variance now with the 3 point shot plus pace.  Losing a 2-0 lol was is not worse than losing any other way as the favorite. Winning is winning.  Is Jimmy Butler superior to Donovan Mitchell for getting swept in the first round?
I'd love to know what most NBA players listen to. Apparently Jimmy Butler listens to a lot of country and Taylor Swift lol. I wonder if Gordon Hayward is the same.
"No one expected Kawhi to be become Kawhi, not even Pop. He said as much. He was really great defensively, but he wasn't on anyone's future top 10 radar. Kawhi at 22 to what he is now. Would be like if Bridges is dragging teams into the finals in 5 years.  Jimmy Butler developed slow, Beal/PG didn't break 20 ppg til year 4. Meanwhile guys like Wiggins/Schroeder look promising early and never take that nest step... you really never know."
Kd and jimmy butler wasn‚Äôt hurt so no.
"Butler has never come out and said anything publicly against Ben though. When asked about what he thought about Ben and Jo  &gt;""I didn't have a problem with either one of them,""  &gt;""Still talk to those dudes. I wish them the absolute best. A career of great health, make as much money as you can, win as many championships as you can. I did not have a problem with any of those guys. It just didn't work the way that we wanted it to work.""  Now compare that to what Jimmy said about Brett publicly.. Go back to THAT JJ reddick podcast episode. (Even going beyond the film meeting incident, which JJ talks about was reported weird)"
"anthony bennett just shot 0% in the canada vs greece game, put some respect on jimmy butler"
Isn‚Äôt the rumor that Simmons didn‚Äôt like Jimmy Butler he made everyone work hard?
Jimmy Butler and Bam went ghost
"That's why I threw in the Jimmy Butler comparison. In truth, as close as Kobe got he never had the physical attributes MJ had despite what you see on NBA reference. Jordan was a specimen."
Jimmy Butler is not good enough to play the amount of hero ball he likes to play.
"the only person i named that was ‚Äúshipped out‚Äù was MCW. Grant was traded for value, and Saric + Cov was turned into Jimmy Butler?   Wood got a 10 day contract and then Hinkie was fired, so he couldn‚Äôt sign him. Holmes left in FA for more $ and PT. you‚Äôre just lying at this point"
"Yeah, and lebron joined a team so bad he couldn‚Äôt even make the playoffs with them that year‚Ä¶  Embiid and scrubs was better than what the lakers had, even if you ignore that Simmons was highly rated then and they had nice pieces everywhere like roco. Of course all of this is ignoring jimmy butler as well, who they could have still traded for. Choosing LA wasn‚Äôt a basketball decision at all"
"he should have been guarding Jimmy butler in the finals imo, instead of Ad on him most of the game"
"Butler might get a bit too much credit here tho, Spo and the entire heat culture was there before Jimmy he just elevated it"
"Obv the latter group is much better overall but I really do believe that with Giannis and Trae there's 2 Grade A talents left and PG is currently playing his personal Jimmy Butler run. I think that next year the current CF teams will struggle to make it out of the second round but there are still players rising to the occasion which makes for ultimately good conference finals, albeit not the best quality in terms of the team's respective ceilings.   Last year we probably saw the highest level of playoff basketball from round 1 to the finals and people still talk it down due to the bubble, although it unleashed some of the best shooting and chess matches the NBA has ever seen. There has to be a middle way to all this noise and I personally can appreciate both years for what they are. But Id also be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to seeing healthy Bron+AD in the WC + healthy Nets in the EC next season.   Until then I find the competitive nature of this year's CF pretty entertaining. Plus some great underdog stories and strong redemption narratives accross all teams."
"When you say shipped out, you mean traded for assets, right? Saric + Roco became jimmy butler. Jerami Grant became the pick that turned into Maxey. Etc"
I legit wanted to unsub during the whole Jimmy Butler run. Holy fuck the crazy amounts of toxicity surrounding players like KAT / Wiggins / Other Butler teammates being 'soft' was unbearable
"For younger people, he was a combo of Kobe Bryant and Dwayne Wade mixed with a little Jimmy Butler.of course they came after and worshiped/based their careers off Jordan. Butler  is even is rumored to be an illegitimate child of MJ's.  He had the body, the work ethic, the body control and the drive to be the best ever."
"&gt;I guess we like Paul George now?  this drives me crazy. like, PG is who PG is. if you watched his career you'd be less surprised by the ups and downs. same goes for almost anyone -- oh Jimmy Butler is a top 10 player cause the Heat had a run, or now he's not. we just like to react so extremely to everything"
"Jimmy Butler is not a top 20 NBA player, never been and never will be. And no, it has nothing to do with my team"
"But he literally never had Boogie, that‚Äôs the point. His best player was Norris Cole in one run, then Jrue (no Boogie) in another and still was better than Tatum because he carried harder.  Tatum missed one year of Kyrie and Hayward but got them back next year. He had Horford, Brown and Terry even if he didn‚Äôt have Kai and Hayward one year. Then Kemba in 2020. He‚Äôs never been the #1 guy till this year, and if we‚Äôre going off your criteria he‚Äôs dropped in rankings because he lost in the 1st round in 5 lmao  If how far you get in literally just one run based on very favorable circumstances is what makes you better than someone, is Jimmy Butler &gt;&gt;&gt; Tatum, Harden and many others who‚Äôve never reached the Finals?"
well its easy to diminish his results in the east. The best player he beat those years were a young paul george and jimmy butler and kyle lowry.
"i really hope Masai trades for him.   but to your point, if a guy is 8-26 or 5-23 then Ben did his job.   If the eye test looks off it's maybe b/c you don't know what you are looking at.   Trae is a PnR savant.  nobody shuts it down.  But forcing him to do things he might not want to do like rushing floaters from his non preferred spots made it a hard time.     small guards are his weakest areas, b/c dude is 6-11.   but for the most part he hangs with them just fine and causes problems.   https://thesixersense.com/2021/03/01/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-best-defensive-games/  &gt;Dec. 29, Sixers vs. Raptors ‚Äî Pascal Siakam Siakam Stats ‚Äì 7:02 mins | 7 pts |  3-11 FG |  0-0 FT | 0 ast | 1 TO  Simmons Stats ‚Äì 1 stl | 1 blk  Siakam had some success against other Sixers‚Äô defenders but couldn‚Äôt do much against Simmons. Six of Siakam‚Äôs field goal attempts against Simmons were 3s, most of which were Siakam settling instead of trying to attack the rim. Siakam had very little success the few times he tried to drive on Simmons as well. Ben is one of the few defenders in the NBA who has both the size and speed to cover Siakam, and it showed in this game.  maybe you prefer a homer article showing how much trouble he gives your squad's best player  https://www.raptorshq.com/2020/2/27/21155484/pascal-siakam-defense-stoppers-giannis-antetokounmpo-ben-simmons-bam-adebayo  or maybe you want to see more about him vs other star wings  https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/76ers/ben-simmons-nba-all-star-game-2020-analysis  &gt;While those numbers are all mighty impressive, the job he‚Äôs done just manning people up has been nothing short of stellar. When you look at the All-Star caliber players Simmons has defended this season, he‚Äôs kept them all in check. Jimmy Butler (3 of 12), Jayson Tatum (3 of 11), Pascal Siakam (5 of 19), Bradley Beal (6 of 14), LeBron James (2 of 9), Russell Westbrook (4 of 13) and James Harden (3 of 9) have shot a combined 26 of 87. That‚Äôs a combined field goal percentage of 29.8."
"Jimmy Butler.      Butler and Embiid are friends, culture setter and lets the Heat time up Bam with Ben's timelines."
That‚Äôs why Jimmy Butler left. If they still had butler they would definitely be playing the bucks
"They are both *slightly* overrated IMO. All that hype last night about CP3 making his first finals and all that, carrying or altering franchises (kinda true with OKC/Suns) some had him as a top MVP candidate which is kind of ridiculous. Yet he looks old and is clearly being carried by Booker, Ayton, and is being outplayed by some others around him too like Payne. He is pushing 40 years old and has an injury history so it's not that shocking, just very over hyped at the moment and if he makes that finals... the team has had arguably the easiest route to a finals in NBA history playing against LA without Lebron/AD at 100, no Jamal Murray on the Nuggets, and no Kawhi on the Clippers which looks like it's gonna be a 7 game series with CP3 playing bad. Props for him and the organization turning things around in the W/L department but it's a collective effort with a rising superstar in Booker next to him, CP3 doesn't make the playoffs without Booker.   Butler too has been known to drop 40-50 pts and be a solid 2 way player, but he's still only a top 12-15 player at best without a ton of feats to back it up. Always thought of Butler as a lesser PG-13, both are great 2 way players but PG-13 averaged 28pts and was a DPOY finalist in the same year when he was given the star role with Westbrook, and has been a solid 1b to Kawhi's 1A in LA despite some slight inconsistencies (dude erupted last night for 41pts in an elimination game). For a dude called Jimmy Buckets who has had numerous opportunities on solid teams with star power around him we haven't seen his best quite yet despite a solid effort in the bubble where he carried a bad team and admitted to being too exhausted in the end, and didn't come close this year on what looks to be a Heat team in need of extra help."
Sounds similar to what Jimmy Butler was saying.  He don‚Äôt want it bad enough and don‚Äôt work hard enough.
I would argue both have received more criticism than praise over the course of their career. Only recently has Jimmy Butler really been praised at all. Chris Paul used to be ridiculed all the time..
There‚Äôs so many straw man arguments made in your post just delete this and move on.  Jimmy Butler GOAT? Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt even believe this.
"Jimmy ""locker room cancer"" Butler has his fair share of detractors"
"Yeah, Shump and Landry both had some decent rookie seasons so the hype was at least a little understandable. I don't remember anyone calling for a max though. I was holding out hope that Shump would make that Jimmy Butler leap for about a year longer than I should have though."
"Well he did have Kawhi for much of the playoffs, and plays on a very deep Clippers team. Jimmy Butler had slightly more help last year and took the Heat to game 6 of the Finals cause he got hot. Also, being the only star and having no help are not remotely the same thing. This isn‚Äôt an ‚Äò07 and ‚Äò18 LeBron scenario."
Jimmy Butler
"Yes. Example: Jimmy Butler 4 team trade where Philly sent out Butler and Mathias Lessort (2017 2nd round pick, #50).  It‚Äôs uncommon but I guess technically legal.  Edit: better example: D‚ÄôLo to GSW. Traded by the Brooklyn Nets with Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier to the Golden State Warriors for Kevin Durant and a 2020 1st round draft pick. (top-20 protected)"
"Facts. I was just thinking about this today. Like how many teams have probably game planned entirely around the fact that Ben Simmons won‚Äôt shoot, and is lackluster at the line.   Then there‚Äôs the other side of that. How many players have there been on the Sixers who have had to play different roles to work around him? We saw it last year with Tobias basically being relegated to their only 3 point shooter. He was awful last year because he was their only spacing and had to play a role not built for him. Then there was Jimmy Butler 2 years ago. He basically was only scoring in the 4th as their ‚Äúcloser‚Äù in the playoffs. In hindsight, I genuinely think they were championship favorites that year if they just said fuck it and decided to make Jimmy the primary ball handler."
"bigger deal is they only got RoCo for Jimmy Butler, which -- what? Why did they think that would work and keep them competitive?"
I saw a post earlier this playoffs asking if Kuzma or Jimmy Butler was more disappointing like they're both All-Stars lol.
I seriously doubt the Bucks plan on moving on from Middleton. We have had a hard time keeping good players to stick around. You think they're gonna trade one of the top 10 Bucks of all time? Doubt it. Like Middleton has given so much to this team and where are you even gonna find equal or better value? Don't see Wizards moving on from Beal with Middleton as the center piece. Jimmy Butler? Nah. Porzingis is a serious downgrade. Lilard or Irving? Doesn't seem likely at all. There just really isn't a trade that I can forsee where Middleton gets moved and the Bucks upgrade.
"jimmy butler tried to push him bruh, he didn't do anything"
"Coangelo may have not been a good GM, but the brain trust &amp; Elton Brand were the ones that accelerated the timeline with the Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris trades."
this dude is a hooper. i love watching his redemption arc. earned my respect. so much better than jimmy butler
"Odom, Wallace and Capela are just entirely different players.   Wallace was a 6'7 wing. Odom a 6'10 point pf. Capela a rim running centre.   Wallace would matchup with players similar to Kawhi, Jimmy Butler or Jaylen Brown types."
I really wonder how hard covid hit him. Obviously we saw him playing bags with his family and he looked fine towards the end but we don‚Äôt have any real idea how he handled it originally. I know guys like Jimmy Butler lost like 10 pounds while having it while other guys were unaffected. I think some effects of covid paired with losing some game shape could be playing a hand here.
He put Cade 5 spots above Jimmy Butler. This dude‚Äôs out to lunch.
He is better than Jimmy Butler for sure
"Paul George is better than Jimmy Butler back then, now and forever always."
"similar to how jimmy butler just wanted to win, but only if he could just win while having a max contract"
"When do you think Wiseman will have his breakout season? People like Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Steve Nash, Kyle Lowry, etc. took years and years to develop. He may be an 1st team All NBA player someday, but almost 0% chance that happens while Curry is still a MVP candidate."
"Bane has been looking good, but I don't think you've considered just how long 15-20 years is. To put it in perspective: Jimmy Butler has been in the league for nine seasons so far."
"Record comes into it because often guys will have similar stats, so it can be useful as a tiebreaker.  Especially if we're just looking at ppg or offensive numbers; defense, playmaking, shot selection, bbiq all impact the game.  Look at CP3 and Jimmy Butler who are both way more impactful in advanced stats and team record than their basic lines might suggest."
It‚Äôs mostly Lakers fans complaining even though it took the Lakers 6 games to beat Jimmy Butler.
PG: D Rose SG: Jimmy Butler SF: Bob Love PF: Booz Cruise/Pau Gasol C: Joakim Noah/Artis Gilmore
"PG is more talented. Butler is made of different stuff.  If I need an alpha, I‚Äôll take Jimmy."
Kyrie played the most games out of the big 3 but he ‚Äòquit‚Äô. Ran the show while Harden was out and would be voted the MVP of the team by Nets fans if possible.   Jimmy Butler shoots &gt;30% vs the Bucks but didn‚Äôt ‚Äòquit‚Äô. That‚Äôs a great way to lead a team isn‚Äôt it?
"Jimmy Butler has had better advanced stats than PG since 2015, including PG's fake MVP year"
What makes you think Embiid can. He plays in the sorry ass East and can't even make a Conference Finals. Philly was at its best when Jimmy Butler was there.
I'd like to see him and Jimmy butler play together preferably with a super soft center like Roy hibbert or something  lol
"Did yall even watch the series or just take this opinion from his statline?   Jimmy had to run into the wall of Giannis, Middleton, Holiday, Tucker, Divincenzo, and Lopez every possession, while Bam, Herro, and Dragic couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, so all the Bucks needed to do was pack the paint against Butler.   If you watched him play, it was clear he was being locked up, not just playing terribly.   Butler is a great first option on a team, and has proved he can be the best player on a championship team, but his biggest flaw is his limited scoring game. He's an elite slasher, but if his teammates can't create space, he's out of options.  We saw Giannis get locked up by defensive walls that forced other Bucks players to beat him, but when a team can do the same to Jimmy, who is not as dominant as Giannis in the paint, its just Jimmy playing terribly?"
cp3 isn‚Äôt the scorer he once was but his leadership qualities are what took the suns to the conference finals similar with jimmy butler and the heat last year he still ain‚Äôt better than harden though
"his volume stats were generally still OK, but for a while after he had COVID his percentages all struggled.  that, tied with the Celtics being just a 7-seed .500 basketball team, and the general narrative stuff about their team being a disappointment (and Jimmy Butler is more of a household name)."
Hey friendly reminder that Middleton is better than Jimmy Butler. Hold that L ([again](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kk7dry/comment/gh1iz0s/))
"The timberwolves are consistently a bottom seed team. The year they had Jimmy Butler, also known for his defense and playmaking, they got bounced in the FIRST ROUND. And Ben can‚Äôt even shoot half as well as Jimmy. Sorry but adding Ben doesn‚Äôt make them a contender ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not even close"
"the post-LeBron Heat seem to have skipped the rebuilding phase, drafting well (Bam, Josh Richardson in the second round), developing talent (Duncan Robinson was undrafted), and selling high on certain assets (flipping Richardson for Jimmy Butler blows my mind now).  Another finals appearance both so soon after LeBron and without a painful rebuild is really impressive"
"Jimmy Butler. He had the second highest vertical in his draft class. He's more known for being a blue-collar, hard working player, but he is incredibly athletic."
"Like that dude who said Jokic would be better than Okafor, just wait.   Look at the rookie years of some of the stars in the league today. You were probably trashing people for thinking Jimmy Butler had promise."
"I‚Äôd roast you, but you‚Äôre a Timberwolves fan lol. That‚Äôs a roast in itself. Hopefully one day KAT can actually make the playoffs (only time he made it is when Jimmy Butler was carrying you shitters), then maybe it‚Äôll be a debate. Until then enjoy many 30 win seasons, you‚Äôre use to those huh?"
Good lord this is a defensive juggernaut:   Miami Heat  Glen Rice  Tim Hardaway  Jimmy Butler  PJ Brown  Bam Adebayo
PG: Tim Hardaway  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Glen Rice  PF: Lamar Odom  C: Bam Adebayo
"Yeah I‚Äôm not as much a fan of the swap concept because Dame is the most doubles player in the league already and does all his damage in the spread PnR with Nurkic, Simmons and Nurkic to me shouldn‚Äôt share the floor ever because the damage you do to your spacing would be ridiculous- I‚Äôd be all for it if we could get Ben who would gladly play that Draymond Green 4/5 role of being the anchor of the defense and running the offense on the short roll and just hammering to the bucket, but tbh I don‚Äôt see Ben having the dog Dray does so I don‚Äôt know if he would be willing to play that role.  Can we get the mentality of Jimmy Butler infused into Ben Simmons as a player?  I feel like if he just played like Zion or Giannis and had pure smash mouth mentality, I‚Äôd accept the Shaq level terrible freethrows, and I‚Äôd gladly move all our assets to acquire him."
"Haven‚Äôt got an exact take but the whole love affair and exaggeration with Jimmy butler, just because he acts and looks tough, he‚Äôs a limited player"
Jimmy Butler all day. We need some dawgs
"His stats don't look that good, if we're really viewing him by the all-time lens, mostly due to injury/load management, but also due to being a bit of a late bloomer.   He hasn't posted 10 WS or 1600 pts since 2017.  He has 4 top-10 MVP finishes. That's nice, but Moses had 8 seasons above 10 WS, 11 seasons above 1600 points, and had 10 top-10 MVP finishes. Kawhi is a long way away from that.  His basketball-reference ""similarity score"" are now guys like Jimmy Butler, Kevin Love, and Amare Stoudamire.  Honestly, Amare is not far off from a career comp: amazing talent with unlimited potential, but injuries and a pretty short peak. Obviously, he could turn things around and have an amazing 30s decade. We'll see."
"Jimmy Butler has made more field goals than free throws in his career, unlike HarFlop.   When the NBA adds their new rules on foul baiting the Nets should trade him back for Levert and Jarrett Allen if they want to win."
Jimmy Butler is incapable of scoring more than 12ppg without free throws
"we need to stop attributing so much weight to singular playoff runs, regardless of how good or bad they are  Jimmy Butler shouldn't be top 10 undisputed after 1 playoff run and then immediately become an overrated bum after getting swept"
Jimmy Butler because he'll go 4/7 from the field and 18/22 from the FT line and you wont blink an eye
I mean no one would say Jimmy Butler is a top 5 player in the game but there have been plenty of times where he's obviously been the best player on the court and then you look at the statline and he's 2-10 shooting with 7 points and it's the fourth quarter.
"He played with LeBron and Kobe in 2008, LeBron and Durant in 2012, and Durant, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, and Paul George in 2016.   But sure, let's give Carmelo all the credit! He's the greatest Olympic Basketballer!"
Jimmy Butler was considered a dog for his play in the finals not even a year ago. It might not have been a specific play but he put up like 40 lol
"Fax lmao, I gotta give Booker credit for taking (and really making) tough shots over Giannis, but otherwise every guard in the league when guarded by Giannis just gives up driving to the rim and starts chucking up bad shots, because if they do drive, it will not end kindly (see Jimmy Butler). CP3 and Trae were clearly not eager to switch onto Giannis."
"Roll out the red carpet for Jimmy Butler and replace Popovich with Spoelstra. Team USA can get by running Miami‚Äôs offense upgrading Nunn, Robinson, and Ariza into Lillard, Tatum, and Durant."
"It really depends on how much a team overachieves and how much the other team actually plays like garbage/has a night off. Of course it's not enough to predict the outcome of the next game but there's usually a return to the mean.  Just look at Jimmy butler in Game 5 of last year's finals, he played really well and I think Miami overachieved in that game. The Lakers were pretty bad apart from LeBron. Then the next game they couldn't sustain that level and the Lakers won pretty easily.  Also it depends on whether you play at home or not, coaching adjustments, etc"
"Jimmy butler, heat culture, last semen in the bubble."
What would you call what he did to Jimmy Butler in round one then?
*Jimmy Butler steps back*
Khris Middleton is a better player than Jimmy Butler. Period.
Better than Jimmy Butler
"Same as the Jimmy Butler story. People making shit up on Twitter for jokes, until it ends up picking up life on its own with people assuming it‚Äôs real."
No that‚Äôs Jimmy butler
"So random question - who had a better career so far? Derrick Rose or Jimmy Butler?  Rose had the higher peak, but Butler was great for a lot longer"
I'm 100% heterosexual but if Jimmy Butler asked me on a date I'm dropping everything and going on that date.
Penny was like a jimmy butler
Unless it's Jimmy Butler
"My under the radar ones...  Rondo and Wade on the Bulls, with the IG post ""My vets would never go to the media"" talking about Jimmy Butler... never understood the logic there  Lebron passive aggressive tweets, the Kevin Love saga was amazing, we all literally argued over the meaning of an Arthur fist meme for months.  Giannis discovering what a ""Smothie"" is  Giannis' blowjob bell  Paul Pierce vs IT retirement night fiasco. The pettiness was hillarious.   Kobe's 60 on 50 shots in his final game.   Rudy Gobert trying to spread coronavirus to people.   The Demarcus Cousins traded during the all star game thing"
"The Jimmy Butler one is it for me because in no way was he wrong. ""Hallelujah Wiggins"""
"So the roster right now could've conceivably been:  **PG:** Ben Simmons, TJ McConnell.   **SG:** Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton.   **SF:** Mikal Bridges, Jerami Grant.   **PF:** Jayson Tatum, Robert Covington, Dario Saric.   **C:** Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, Richaun Holmes.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'd assume you turn a lot of those assets into a star to start at the 2 in that team, like...I don't know...Jimmy Butler?"
"The Wizards definitely miss the playoffs, the Knicks probably miss the playoffs. Instead two out of the Pacers, Hornets and Raptors make it instead  The Bulls still don't make the playoffs  Julius Randle and Ben Simmons don't make the all Star team. Trae Young and Jimmy Butler do  Tbh, I don't think any of these are that bold? Maybe people think otherwise"
"Something's gonna happen in Brooklyn. Either Harden or Irving is leaving,  Lamelo Ball is top 5 in MVP voting.  Jimmy Butler or Spo leaves the Heat. I see spo taking Pat Riley's job and then whoever is coming in as head coach gets into it with Jimmy he leaves.  Markelle Fultz coming out party. 25ppg  Knicks implode or get Zack Lavine from chicago  &amp;#x200B;  And that's all I have"
"If Lebron won in 2020 putting up 16,6,4 like Iggy did then yeah i would be all for giving Jimmy Butler finals MVP last year. But since Jimmy Butler lost the MVP to a dude putting up better numbers than him it‚Äôd be pretty hard to make an argument Jimmy deserved it."
"I still think Randle deserved it vs JT but find the   Butler thing frustrating because the message is that Tatum‚Äôs would‚Äôve been better off sitting out to work on conditioning and wait for the breathing issues to get better vs playing and tanking his prospects in his 1st month post-covid (Jan 25th to Feb 24th)   Without those days, JT‚Äôs played only 5 fewer games and 65 less mins than Butler, which is equivalent to 2 fewer games based off JT‚Äôs 35.7 mpg in that time (35.8 season avg). Pretty damn close especially compared to Butler‚Äôs 12 games and 545 mins (33.6 mpg) less than JT for the season.  His averages outside that time span are  27/7.6/4.1, 1.1 steals, .5 blocks, 2.7 tos, and 1.9 pfs on 59.4% ts (47.4/40/86.6 on 20.5 fga, 7.9 3pa, 5 fta) and a win% would be enough for the 4th seed. Butler averaged 21.5/6.9/7.1, 2.1 steals, 0.3 blocks, 2.1 tos, and 1.4 pfs on 60.7% ts (49.7/24.5/86.3 on 14.2 fga, 2 3pa, 8 fta) with a win% that would be enough for‚Ä¶ the 4th seed.  It at least becomes a much closer argument given that the main argument for Jimmy was winning followed by advanced stats which I can‚Äôt find by month but the data we do have for those months makes it seem unlikely that they weren‚Äôt heavily impacted by that month. It then becomes a question of scoring vs playmaking - you could argue defense too but most voters comparing the two called both ‚Äúelite‚Äù so I‚Äôm not sure that would‚Äôve been relied on much either."
"I‚Äôd rather we sign Lowry but Lonzo and JC are 2a and 2b. Lonzo spreads the floor, can sort of playmake, and almost always defends the best player. He‚Äôd fill a huge need in the Jimmy Butler timeline, and his skill level and prospective contract are appropriate to package with assets to trade for a disgruntled max, opportunity willing.  So Lonzo doesn‚Äôt really move the needle for me as a fan, but I think he‚Äôd be a great addition practically."
"He‚Äôs not close to top 5 bruh. Pascal Siakam is a great two-way player but he‚Äôs not top 5 either. Just being a good two-way player doesn‚Äôt vault you over the Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis etc. you‚Äôre delusional."
"Jimmy Butler should be on this list, or at least in the conversation."
Have you seen Jimmy Butler being driven around the[Canadian GP circuit in a McLaren by F1 driver Lando Norris?](https://youtu.be/MbwCM7U_TPo) It‚Äôs around the 4:45 mark. It‚Äôs amazing.
"Dumb ass trade! Give them Buddy if you think your other forwards are good enough or you going you sign a big name I‚Äôm free agency, like Kawi or Jimmy Butler!  Mr. Fox stays where he is at! Sac has another chance to have another potential HOF backcourt!!   Who‚Äôs going to be the center is the next Big ? B??"
"Have they really though? Overpaying Horford was a bad move, but they were able to dump him after one year.  They got Jimmy Butler for peanuts and that very nearly led to them winning the title. It was worth the gamble.  The Tobias Harris trade worked well, and while his contract initially was an overpay, it's looking to be a fair deal and he pairs well next to Embiid.  They also have Seth Curry on a great contract, Thybulle and Maxey were great picks, Dwight on a minimum made sense, and unfortunately Danny Green got hurt, but he made sense for this team.  It's not the GM's fault Simmons cratered so hard in the playoffs.   What specific assets have been ""squandered"" and what other options were available since Hinkie's departure? Maybe Paul George, but what else? Hinkie didn't necessarily leave them with that great of assets besides the core of Simmons/Embiid, as most other picks were bad to average players."
"With current players‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs probably Jimmy Butler. His finals run flipped the script on him. He was no longer the issue in Minnesota or Philly, but the respective franchises."
At the very least he wouldn't have made the Fultz trade. He probably also wouldn't have gone all in for Tobias Harris and a Jimmy Butler rental.
"I doubt they'd need to include the pick, tbh. Jimmy Butler basically only commanded a salary match. Same with Kemba Walker to the Celtics. Gordon Hayward to Charlotte got a protected second. Jerami Grant got the Nuggets cash considerations.  That said, Indy gave up three picks, including a first for Brogdon. So it's not unheard of."
Huh? Did Lowry say publicly that he wants to play in Philly? There's no comparison with the Jimmy Butler trade.
"That's everyone.  The players who were in 2016 and are still at least fringe all-stars but chose not to play are:  Paul George, Kyrie Irving, DeMar DeRozan, Harrison Barnes, and Jimmy Butler.   I think this team could have used those wing's defense."
"Yeah, but the Heat needed a S&amp;T for Jimmy Butler and only had to give up Josh Richardson. Not that Richardson is a bad return, but Lowry isn't at Jimmy Butler level anymore.   That said, the salary match is going to be tricky. At a minimum, it includes George Hill, but it might have to include more."
"A comparison point might be what the Sixers got for Jimmy Butler, which was Josh Richardson. Unless you're LeBron going to Miami, the team losing a free agent is probably not going to get a lot back."
Jimmy Butler
"No, but Jimmy Butler is"
Damn that was great. I need an entire docuseries of Jimmy Butler doing non basketball activities.
"Huh? When did I say I am happy with Siakam as no1 option? He‚Äôs probably going to get traded. You go off on a ridiculous assumption here but okay.   Luckiest championship in last 20 years? Why cuz we beat a warriors team without KD? I know you don‚Äôt watch basketball but I got some news for you. This year, Bucks beat a hobbled harden and kyrie less Nets team, then a hobbled Hawks team. Suns beat a hobbled lakers, Nuggets and clippers. 2020 Lakers beat a hobbled Miami. 2018 Raps beat a fully healthy bucks and 76ers team with Jimmy Butler. You suck off Kawhi on one hand and then call his ring luckiest. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt decide if Kawhi worked hard for that ring or if it was ‚Äúluckiest championship in 20 years‚Äù. I doubt you care but JXMY(a quality basketball you tuber) did a video on hardest paths to championship and used a metric to compare championship paths and the raps were ranked 9th since 1984. I ll attach it but I doubt you give a shit since you‚Äôre on a mission to hate on Raptors lmao. Injuries don‚Äôt make a ring easy my guy. It‚Äôs a part of the game. Wake tf up.  Dame? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard someone say we‚Äôre getting same.   What are you on about with Lowry and delusional Raptors fan? It‚Äôs a fact of the matter if 76ers want Lowry they will have to match 20-25 mil in salary. They will have to give raps something of value to make them use their cap space. Raps don‚Äôt need to s&amp;t. They could just let Lowry walk to mavs. It‚Äôs not really that big of a deal. We have #4 to drafts Lowrys replacement and will sign C in free agency. Idk why you think raps need this sign and trade. If 76ers want Raps to do it they will have to give up something.  You don‚Äôt seem to have any substance in your replies. You just say shit to piss off people without actually putting any thought behind it. You hate on the raps and Siakam, who on the Pistons is leading you to anything beyond the 6th seed? Bey? Stewart? Ik it‚Äôs been a while since Detroit has played meaningful basketball, it‚Äôs mean you should start saying shit for the sake of it. A shithole organization? Dude what? It‚Äôs one of the best run organizations, no leaks, one of the best development teams, one of the best Presidents. I mean Atleast theirs some truth to delusional Raptors fans but Shithole organization lol? Why are you capping? Detroit on the other hand ain‚Äôt so hot. Dw you‚Äôll get better. Hopefully.   JXMY video(I recommend you watch it, it‚Äôs a good video) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cpYXxWPZ9EU"
"I think the 76ers would make an error to trade him. He's such a unique player, but he's not ""the second superstar""of a contender. More like a Super Boris Diaw.  The 76ers should try to acquire a bigger star (guard) by trading Tobias Harris and young assets, and let Simmons play a lesser role on offense (as a forward, don't let him run the whole offense on halfcourt). A role where it is ok to finish the game with 6 points.   Like, try something like Harris+Thybulle+picks for Lilliard. Or for Donovan Mitchell if he can't stand anymore to play in Utah ;-)  It's a pity that they couldn't keep Jimmy Butler.  I mean, I really like how Harris is playing this year, but he has reached his ceiling and it's probably not good enough to be the second superstar.  With less pressure, Simmons would probably do fine. Even if he misses his free throws (but he won't have the ball in his hands so often). And yes, for the 76ers it's an awful contract for this kind of role, but yeah, it's sunk cost, just live with it."
Was just thinking if only the Wolves accepted the four firsts and change for Jimmy Butler deal
"It‚Äôs both funnily enough.  On paper, Simmons has everything. He‚Äôs tall, fast, strong as fuck, has pretty good vision, is a DPOY candidate, pretty physically robust all things considered.   The problem is that he doesn‚Äôt shoot. Not that he is a bad scorer like Marcus Smart and a lot of other players, he just refuses to engage in plays. He also wants to handle the ball, as noted by Jimmy Butler, but doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with the ball when push comes to shove. He also can‚Äôt make free throws reliably and he doesn‚Äôt deal with hacking gracefully. His work ethic is also pretty suspect, he seemingly prefers to be coddled than pushed to improve. All of these things you do not want when you aren‚Äôt blowing people out.  So he‚Äôs a exceptional piece that will give you amazing defensive capability but he has zero offensive skills, even around the rim, and it is a gamble to get more than point blank range from him. The combination nets you one of the greatest regular season players that just so happens is beneficial in the playoffs due to his defense but can also tank you in the playoffs because you can end up playing 4 vs 5 offense. Any team trading for him is gambling on improving his mentality."
This is a huge stretch. That team had Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler and Tobias. Ben Simmons was a non factor on the court when it really mattered
What did they win? The first round of the playoffs? With Embiid the Sixers have to be looking to make the ECF at minimum  Also that team had Jimmy Butler on it too
"They lost in the second round. That‚Äôs a wee bit more than one bounce from winning the title.   And that team had Jimmy Butler so essentially a 4th max guy. That can‚Äôt happen again now that Simmons is a max, which is a huge part of the problem here.   Also, Ben Simmons kind of sucked in the Raptors series. Butler was basically running the show for much of it. 11/7/5 and 5th leading scorer - I mean Jesus - that‚Äôs the problem in a nutshell. You can‚Äôt pay $35M to a guy who sucks on offense when it matters."
"Not even that, lots of super hard working players like Jimmy Butler, Jrue Holiday, Demar Derozen are great free throw shooters but can‚Äôt hit 3‚Äôs consistently.  The range required to hit 3‚Äôs just isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs correlated with free throw percentage."
"He is good at driving because of his size and strength. He is a fine passer, nothing special at all. He's a good defender, but I still remember when Jimmy Butler lit up the Bucks, without Giannis ever guarding him or asking to guard him. Same thing against KD and the Nets - Giannis never guarded or asked to guard KD. He is good at rebounding because of his size and strength. He is not an above average ball handler. He lacks any semblance of a bag. His go-to move is to back up and try to simulate a fast break by getting a head start and Euro-stepping a defender."

I don't know if they were fighting or not but I did read a story a couple of weeks ago that said Ben Simmons was upset and complained about Jimmy Butler getting plays that were meant for Ben Simmons and TBH to me that sounds like something Simmons would do because when I look at him I see a big fucking baby like if he doesn't get his way or what he thinks he should be getting he would whine and bitch about it and when you have someone on a team that is like that it's a cancer so we damn sure don't want or need him down in Miami.
"Just as long as the Miami heat stays the hell away from this guy I wish him the best of luck, but I don't think there's a chance in hell he would be around Jimmy Butler again and we don't want him to be around Butler again."
"Also, Jimmy Butler isn't on this list at all?"
Lakers fan thought Josh Hart gonna be the next Jimmy Butler and Svi Mykhailiuk gonna be the next Klay Thompson.. I‚Äôd like to see what delusional comparison you guys have in mind for THT
The amount of free throws isn't a problem.  No one complains about the Jimmy Butler or Lebron.  The problem is the foul baiting.  Of course the total attempts will be lower when everyone is shooting 3s
Ben just wants to to play fortnite he doesn‚Äôt wanna work. Jimmy butler was right about these cats all along
doesn't get mentioned enought that Jimmy Butler has an insanely historic FT rate
Jimmy Butler
God.. we'll be referencing this mistake until the last breath I take on this earth.  PHI fucked up bad bad.  And they had Jimmy Butler get away at the same time.  pfffff
"Oh ok you're one of those he shouldn't do anything but be in the gym 25/8 guys. Ok then.   Let me let you in a little secret. Some real insider stuff here that most people don't know: All. NBA. Players. Work. Hard. On. Their. Game.   Who's the worst player you can think of? That guy works his ass off. That dude probably is in the gym as much as Giannis or Jimmy Butler. Hard work doesn't separate players at this level, talent does. Natural skill. And also working on the right things the right way.   That superstar that always gets praised for how hard he works and the fact that he's always in the gym? He has outside interests. He has local and national sponsorship deals. He likes to go out to eat and to the movies and shit. He goes on vacation every year also.   This is real life not an anime. You can't just work hard and believe in yourself and automatically be the best version of yourself."
"Agree with everything except my reading was the sixers cheaped out/were scared of Jimmy on a long-term max deal/chose Tobi more than Butler demanded out.    In fairness keeping four max players for 3-5 years would probably cost you a billion $ or so, but they prioritized Harris and didn‚Äôt offer Jimmy a full max after the season per Chams iirc."
"you must not visit often.   they roast Ben and any Ben supporters as bad as any Celtic fan does.   also, Embiid/Simmons minutes are still overwhelming positive.    The front office needed to find a Butler level player to handle the half court late game offense.   Fultz flamed out, Jimmy wanted his own team...but still no excuse for it being Shake Milton and rookie Maxey in that role."
"When did I say he doesn't flop? Please point it out lol. Every star in the league does it because the refs reward it, name one star on a team that doesn't do it? Luka, Lebron, AD, PG13, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Embiid, etc. etc. They all do it.  But I forgot this is a shit on anything Suns circle jerk right now. Carry on."
"So many dudes opted out or are injured.   Reading through [this list](https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2021/03/m-oly-finalists.aspx) doesn't seem like there a ton of better options.   Allen would have been nice but just about every elite two-way wing opted out or is hurt. LeBron, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, etc."
"&gt; Nah this ain‚Äôt the best USA has. With no hurt players and full participation USA gets additional Steph Curry, Lebron, AD, Kyrie, Cp3, Harden, PG, Jimmy Butler.  Have those players decided not to be in the Olympics this time around?"
Bro there‚Äôs no way these players are trying right? They are lifeless. Need Jimmy Butler out there being stupidly locked in‚Ä¶
"Nah this ain‚Äôt the best USA has. With no hurt players and full participation USA gets additional Steph Curry, Lebron, AD, Kyrie, Cp3, Harden, PG, Jimmy Butler. Obviously, the team out there should be enough to win games Dame + KD is more talent than any other team has, but it‚Äôs still a team game and you gotta play defense too"
"That can‚Äôt be true.. Curry has 1, Westbrook has 1 and so does Jimmy Butler"
"big men have have always gone high in the draft, so I would not extrapolate too much from that, just look at the 2018 draft where both Ayton &amp; Bagley went ahead of Luka Doncic.  I do think we're seeing a new era of more skilled bigs, which makes sense as the game continues to evolve into a more 5 out style game with tons of emphasis on shooting &amp; creation.  But bigs with the Jokic/Embiid/KAT skillset are super, duper rare and will continue to be just because there's fewer giants in the world than there are guard/wing body-types.  Think about who the 10th best wing (anyone 6'5""-6'8"") is the the NBA vs. the 10th best big-man, someone like Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler (this is off the top of my head, don't nit-pick too much) has so much more impact than the 10th best big (someone like Clint Capela or Sabonis), and if you looked went further the supply of wings stays deep &amp; the pool of bigs dries up quickly."
"And that the US fields a sampler platter of whoever is free after the playoffs that season. For a lot of countries, players good enough to play pro ball in the NBA or even in other major international leagues are hard to come by, so it almost pencils those guys in for a decade on the squad.  For the US, it‚Äôs almost like, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs had a good playoffs and doesn‚Äôt have anything lined up? Can we get DeAndre Ayton out here?‚Äù  I know it‚Äôs not really as haphazard as all that, but Team USA ought to recognize that it really does need a higher degree of continuity and commitment. Assorted US/NBA talent might still be good enough to beat most/all(?) other national squads, but it‚Äôs clearly not good enough to win in a walk. And considering the gargantuan target Team USA has on its back in international tournament play, I‚Äôd appreciate if there were at least 4 guys who were 27-34 year-old NBA players who had made this commitment two years ago.  Not necessarily ‚ÄúFor Old Glory, KD and Steph need to ‚Äî‚Äú blah blah, but Team USA should know they have a baseline of guys who‚Äôve all been multiple time all-stars who can serve as starters in a pinch if not a reliable third rotation. Line up multi-year commits well in advance from, say, Paul George, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond, and Jimmy Butler. Easier said than done, I know, but I could see it being marketable to being a backbone of Team USA. Hell, if KD wins a third gold this year, I bet he‚Äôs back in three years to try for a fourth. But maybe it‚Äôs better for the squad overall if guys like Butler and Green had been vocal about returning from ‚Äò16 once the 44 man finalist list was announced last February. Something."
Giannis was MVP and DPOY and he got bitched by Jimmy Butler in the second round lmfao don‚Äôt do this
"That team had KD, PG, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie, Klay, Lowry, DeRozan, Boogie, DeAndre, Draymond, Carmelo. So I'd say yes, but it's subjective."
"Jrue is going to be playing a lot on this team. Perimeter defense was disgusting. Last olympics we had Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Klay, and prime Draymond on D."
"Players who take whining &amp; bitching way too far like Draymond &amp; Jimmy Butler should be handed technicals. I know this is a rule already, but they need to actually impose it.   I'm just so sick of that fucking scrunched up face NBA players make when they whine &amp; bitch about officiating."
"Team 1: Choose death  Team 2: They all hate each other and will never pass the ball to each other  Team 3: Jimmy Butler is going to have sex with all their girlfriends and it will be a PROBLEM.  Team 4: a great team until their point guard decides he'd be better off spending his time fighting for the rights of obscure causes, and until the second round when Rudy Gobert turns into a golem  Team 5: My pick for second best of these 5, some really streaky shooting"
"‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say he was the 15th beat player, I said he was the 14th best player‚Äù  Really doesn‚Äôt matter, the point is there are 11 guys that are All-NBA caliber forwards and Tatum is closer to Middleton than he is to Lebron for his impact.   So he is a fringe All-NBA guy since his talent isn‚Äôt enough to secure him a team, and the standings of the other teams will determine the final slots (like Siakam making 2nd team over him last year and Randle making it over him this year).   Realistically there are 5 guys that when healthy 100% make it over him, and that‚Äôs without counting Paul George or Jimmy Butler who have both been consistently over Tatum.   Not to mention someone like Zion could leap frog Tatum in a year. Zion is already a more efficient volume scorer than Tatum."
"&gt;Fournier, Joe Harris, RJ Barrett, Danny Green, OG Anunoby, P.J. Tucker, Justin Holiday, Saddiq Bey, Isaac Okoro, Patrick Williams, Kevin Huerter, Cody Martin, Jimmy Butler, Dwayne Bacon, Beal, MPJ, Okogie, Pokusevski, Norm Powell, Bojan Bogdanovic, Mo Harkless, Mikal Bridges, LeBron, Kawhi, Oubre, Dorian Finney-Smith, Jae'Sean Tate, Kyle Anderson, Brandon Ingram, DeRozan  There's ESPN's list of starting SF's in this league. Who can't he guard here? LeBron? If that's the standard to hold people to then noone can defend the 3.   That list is chopped liver. That list is ass^2.   The problem isn't Klay at the 3. It's your other 2 perimeter defenders are too small to guard the 3 and not good enough to defend premiere 1's and 2's. Klay at PG, SG, and SF is a good defensive team. Andre checked the Wing's because he does have more size (fair) but also because Klay was taking their best guard (most often the best player on the opposing team). He didn't get the assignment because the Warriors had another premiere defensive wing so he didn't have to, not because he couldn't."
"in 6 finals games, Jimmy Butler also had a 40 point game."
"I guess mostly I don't understand u/TPP-Patrick's point. Jimmy is nowhere near as accomplished as Giannis. I really don't think this playoff run changes Giannis's perception much at all if they lose this final.   But for Butler, leading that team just to the finals last year was a significant accomplishment.  As a 2-time MVP, I just don't think you get much additional credit if you reach the finals in this injury-riddled year and then lose to this Suns team."
Rui Hachimura for breakout  Jimmy Butler for fall off (underwhelm/let Bam or Herro take the reigns)
"if you have to resort to ‚ÄúThis player is better because they haven‚Äôt been eliminated‚Äù argument, you‚Äôve lost lol  i remember people hyping up jimmy butler like crazy with that shit"
Los Angeles Lakers: Damian Lillard/Bradley Beal/LeBron James/Anthony Davis/Nikola Jokic  LA Clippers: Trae Young/Paul George/Kawhi Leonard/Zion Williamson/Joel Embiid  New York Knicks: Luka Donƒçiƒá/Devin Booker/Jimmy Butler/Julius Randle/Karl-Anthony Towns  Brooklyn Nets: James Harden/Kyrie Irving/Kevin Durant/Giannis Antetokumpo/Rudy Gobert  Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry/Klay Thompson/Jayson Tatum/Draymond Green/Deandre Ayton
"Two way wings:   Kawhi Leonard (All - NBA)   Jimmy Butler (All - Star)  Mikal Bridges (Role Player, with potential)   Patrick Williams (Rookie)"
"100%, most interesting game was the one when Jimmy Butler went supernova, outside that it wasn't that exciting."
"Well, here is Giannis ""Checks Under His Bed at Night for Jimmy Butler"" Flop-etokounmpo playoff record for everyone to see that he has never even won a legitimate playoff series before this year either:  Beginning of time to 1994: too scared of Jimmy Butler to be born  1994-2013: too scared of Jimmy Butler to come to the NBA  2014: so bad he didnt even play that much and he still cost his team 23 more games than the previous season  2015: peed his pants at the sight of Jimmy Butler's Bulls, lost in 6  2016: so scarred by his encounter with Jimmy Butler he refuses to make the playoffs  2017: Wins Most Improved Player and plays on a superteam with Rookie of the Year (better player than Joel Embiid for context) Malcolm Brogdon and Pistons legend Khris Middleton, still loses to a lowly Raptors team in 6 that got destroyed by Lebron.   2018: Lets his superteam down again to the Baby Celtics missing Hayward and Kyrie in 7 games  2019: After winning MVP because voters felt bad for him despite being on a superteam, barely squeaked by Pistons with an injured Blake Griffin (doesnt count, poor sportsmanship not to wait until Blake got better, but Giannis was scared again), beat the Baby Celtics (doesnt count because I said so), then lost in 6 to some random Canadian team led by some mute guy who hadn't played in two years. Used Brogdon as a scapegoat and Giannis cried until they let Brogdon walk (my uncle works for the Bucks, I know all the inside info and know all the players and wear all the flyest clothes and call the players by their nicknames, it's not a big deal though)  2020: Barely squeaked by Orlando without any of their good players (Doesnt count because Shaq, Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Tmac, and Dwight Howard all didnt play). Lost to the Miami Jimmy Butlers in 5 after being so scared that Giannis refused to finish the series."
Jimmy Butler did not earn an All Star selection this year.
"Murray seemed like he was taking the next step before the injury. He was finally consistent  But, until MPJ isn't a traffic cone on defence they're not going past the 2nd round. Too many skilled playmakers that can abuse bad defences. Jokic's defence is already a burden to the Nuggs enough, They can't afford two leaks.  IMO, trade MPJ for Jimmy Butler and take your shot Denver"
He's not wrong.  FTr is a measure of free throws per fg attempt.  .305 ranks booker 57th in the NBA for free throws per FG attempt.  Meanwhile someone like Trae Young is ranked 11th with a FTr of .491 and is the only backcourt player other than Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler in the top 20.
Kawhi gave him trouble because he was strong and had quick hands.  Jimmy Butler didnt even guard him in the Miami series.  You are pulling that out of your ass.  Crowder and Bam took turns guarding him that series and even still Giannis moved them.  His teammates just played so poorly that he got clogged in the paint eventually. Go back and watch the games.
Someone seriously placed Jimmy Butler in the Shanghai Sharks meme and it pissed me off   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9kZu5HGLDY&amp;t=20s&amp;ab\_channel=BroomTheSweeper
I agree with this list except I have Butler over Sprewell.  Argue about a fluke or bubble counts...whatever...him taking that squad to the Finals and actually taking multiple games from the Lakers where he was carrying is way better than anything Sprewell accomplished  Way better and more versatile defender and it's not like Sprewell was a great 3 pt shooter either to crush Jimmy there either for any big advantage
Jimmy Butler also came up huge in the clutch. That was such a fun game
A playoff vet that outscored Jimmy Butler of all people
"&gt;Jimmy will be Jimmy  I don't know how you can just assume this after he literally got outscored in the playoffs by a Bucks depth piece that was unplayable in the Finals.  Jimmy was so uncomfortable vs Jrue and too scared to drive because Giannis + Lopez were hovering around the paint. It's no guarantee Jimmy will be Jimmy if he somehow doesn't adjust to that. Ever since Jimmy lost his shot he's always tried to live in the paint and draw fouls. But throughout the playoffs no one was able to consistently live in the paint vs the Bucks because they have elite rim protection. The best way for Butler to adjust and look like himself is to find his shot again, and that's far from a guarantee."
"Honestly, even the Bucks couldn't cover his lack of defense.  Jrue Holiday had by far the biggest on/off swings in the playoffs for the Bucks, even bigger than Giannis, cause the Bucks got outscored comfortably in the postseason with Forbes or Teague on the court.  The Bucks really only gave him postseason minutes out of desperation to rest Jrue a little bit and cause Teague was just as bad.  He did outscore Jimmy Butler in the Heat series, so he'll always have that."
Jimmy Butler does not suck.
"why not, he out scored stupidly locked in jimmy butler in the play-off.   what more could you ask"
Jimmy Butler was better than Trae Young last year and arguably still was this year.
"Out scored Jimmy Butler in the playoffs, won his chip and dipped.   That‚Äôs a success story in my book."
Injuries wrecked the dude's career. He spent years as a stud under Thibadeu on the Bulls. Two way player. Think Jimmy Butler but with less of a work ethic/drive (that might not be entirely unfair). Deng tried to pay in the NBA after that far contract but it didn't work out. He's happily coaching an African national team and collecting well earned paychecks. Good for him  Bad for the lakers. I really like the story as a Blazer fan
"Nets are the best team, but Miami is going to be the second best team in the East. There are murmurs about Jimmy Butler aggressively working on fixing his three point shot this summer, and if he can get up to around 36%, the Heat elevate so much."
"Only someone without a modicum of basketball knowledge would claim market size has no effect on the appeal of a destination. Look at every recent superstar who caused drama to force their way off their team and see where they eventually wound up:  * Kawhi Leonard: Forced his way out of San Antonio, pit stop in Toronto, ended up in Los Angeles * Anthony Davis: Forced his way out of New Orleans, ended up in Los Angeles * Paul George: Forced his way out of Indiana, pit stop in Oklahoma, ended up in Los Angeles * Jimmy Butler: Forced his way out of Minnesota, pit stop in Philly, ended up in Miami * James Harden: Forced his way out of Houston, ended up in Brooklyn, NYC  So you mean to tell me it's a coincidence that every single superstar who demands out ends up in either a huge market or desirable destination (Miami weather)?  The Lakers couldn't get meetings with major free agents when they were dogshit. 80% of NBA teams can't even get meetings with major free agents when they're good. What a horrendous ""argument"".  &gt;iT's nOt AbOuT BeInG a bIg oR sMaLl mArKeT  If your theory is true, why isn't anyone clamoring to head to Utah, Milwaukee or Denver? Why didn't a star join Minnesota or Sacramento to put them over the top against the Lakers in early 2000's? Or join Indiana or Toronto to try to put them over the top against Lebron?  You're clearly a casual yourself, put that Lakers flair back up lol, you're not fooling anyone."
Where's OPJ and Wilt?  Jimmy Butler and MJ
they traded jimmy butler to the wolves except there were like 5 jimmy butlers and they traded all of them
Winner is surely mj and Jimmy butler imo
Michael Jordan Jimmy Butler
"that‚Äôs 3 picks, one of which was the 8th pick, one of which is very likely gonna be a late first round pick and the one in 2025 which is rumored to be protected. we also have a young player with potential in pat williams and a young all star in zach lavine. care to explain now how exactly we have 0 future for the next 5+ years ?  &gt; garpax had us contending for a decade before blowing it up and bringing in lavine( a great move)   LMFAO we were serious contenders for like two years and even in those two years the heat were much better than us. GarPax made great moves such has handing out a massive contract to luol deng so we didn‚Äôt have the cap space to bring in wade, bron and bosh when they literally wanted to be here, trade the picks used to draft nurkic and harris for doug mcdermott and bring in wade and rondo when they were washed when we had prime jimmy butler to build around. oh and the only reason the butler trade even semi worked out for us is because the timberwolves were idiots and chose to move zach over wiggins - garpax wanted wiggins lmfao. they were one of the worst front offices in the league wasting away a mvp in rose and an all nba player in butler and if you are sitting here trying to defend them i can‚Äôt expect you to have an actual decent take on basketball"
Since he was drafted in 2018 Landry Shamet has played with the following teammates  * Joel Embiid * Ben Simmons * Jimmy Butler * Kawhi Leonard * Paul George * James Harden * Kyrie Irving * Kevin Durant * Chris Paul * Deandre Ayton * Devin Booker
Like a friendlier Jimmy Butler.
"When Jimmy Butler played last year, the Heat win % was as high as the Bucks. I really think people are underrating how good that team could be. Wouldn't surprise me if they finish the regular season with a better record - even if the Bucks end up the more formidable playoff team."
"Not quite sure of some of the Spurs' off-season and draft moves in the past half-decade.  - Giving a 36-year-old Pau Gasol a 3-year, 48 million contract.  - Derozan and Poetl in return for Kawhi (no Siakam, Anunoby, Van Vleet or Valanciunas)  - Young and Aminu for Derozan (no Markannen, Patrick Williams or Coby White)  - in 2015, I knew lifelong Spurs fans who did not want to sign LaMarcus (nice guy, culture fit but not a defensive anchor and not a winner). They preferred going for Jimmy Butler and some cheaper bigs like Millsap and Bro-Lo. Either that or wait a year for Durant in 2016.  - drafting Primo over Moody, Alperen or Kai Jones  - drafting Vassell over Halliburton   Pop's best bet to secure the future would actually be to play all the young guys hard but try and somehow tank for Victor Wembanyama or Emoni Bates."
"He deserves to go out whichever way he chooses.

Jimmy Butler did it and went on to win Most Improved and played himself into a max.
Jimmy Butler just had the best season of his career. At least look him up first before you talk shit.
Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt lead the league in usage.  Also would you play for Pat Riley or Harlabob?
Jimmy Butler was All NBA last season lol
I mean Lowry for example can get paid and play with Jimmy Butler on a good squad while living in Miami.  He‚Äôs already got a ring so it probs isn‚Äôt his top priority either
Keeping Brett brown over Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt help and then signing al horford and Tobias didn‚Äôt help
"Tbf that was post process  That had a clean capsheet, good role players on good contracts, and a bunch of picks. They turned it into half a season of Jimmy Butler, a season of Al Horford who they then had to attach assets to to trade, and Tobias Harris on an oversized contract"
"So far,      PG            C               SF                PF                SG     Kyle Lowry    Bam Adebayo     Jimmy Butler      PJ Tucker         Duncan Robinson     Gabe Vincent  Dewayne Dedmon  KZ Okpala (??)    Markieff Morris   Tyler Herro                                                                       Max Strus  KZ might be going in the Dragic+Achiuwa trade in which case I'm curious who'd fit into that spot. Second unit is looking a bit directionless."
Even Minnesota got Jimmy Butler that one season.
Nah no matter how it turns out. These are the type of moves you make. We have an all-star that is desperate to win and we need to do whatever it takes to keep him happy. The Bulls and the fans are sick of losing. We haven't done shit since Jimmy Butler. No one is going to blame AKME for swinging for the fences regardless of how this turns out.
"I think he will improve, but the sheer amount of really good guards in the East is going to make that difficult. The East has:  Beal, Irving, Harden, Brown (G/F), Tatum (G/F), LaVine, Trae, FVV, Jimmy Butler, etc. And this isn't even including guys who are rookies or haven't been drafted yet. I'd honestly bet Cade Cunningham makes an ASG before White as of right now.  White would have to take serious leaps forward to make an ASG over the guys listed above."
"Not as scary as they'd been if they just kept Jimmy Butler though. Oh, well..."
"Also AD, Kawhi, PG13, Bradley Beal, Zion Thrilliamson, Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, The Great Hardini, Kyrie, Westbrook...there's loads of players we could have sent to demolish the world on short notice. I'm kinda wondering why Zion didn't go. The Great Chonky One would have been un-fucking-stoppable with these rules."
They did. Jimmy butler became a good three point shooter in the bubble and bam became a good midrange shooter lol.
"Embiid has a chance when he had jimmy butler as a teammate, but he choked. Jokic is consistent. That‚Äôs what separates him from embiid"
"-	KD, Slim Reaper -	LeBron, The Phenom -	Giannis, The Gyro Step or Super Gyro -	Bobby Portis, The Eater of Worlds -	Harden, The Soho Hobo -	Kyrie, Captain Bizarro -	Alex Caruso, The Ranger -	Steph Curry, The Spicy One -	Klay Thompson, Mr. Chocolate Milk -	Lowry and Jimmy, The Butt and The Butler  Some are purposely goofy, just trying to have some fun"
"Yeah I know he‚Äôs a back up. But still l, wouldn‚Äôt be doing cartwheels over it. I actually really liked the philly team back when they had Jimmy Butler, but then they decided to pay for Tobias for some reason. Then they got Horford which I‚Äôll never understand. They should have traded Simmons a year ago, I can‚Äôt understand for the life of me why the coach or management didn‚Äôt get his ass to shot the ball.  The team has been mismanaged for years now."
"I mean, those two options seem to be the normal and obvious ways to build a great team. Either draft a superstar and build a winning team, or build build a promising playoff caliber team that is attractive to a star.  The only thing small markets dont get is max stars coming in free agency which is often a curse anyway.  And, for the big markets, its not like theyre guaranteed big name FAs or rookies to stay forever. KP asked to leave the Knicks because he felt the team was mismanaged like 3 yrs into his career. Im sure Jimmy Butler doesnt goto Miami if theyre not a promising young team.  At the end of the day, you need to show competence to attract players. If you cant build a promising team around a centerpiee like AD and Zion you dont deserve to keep him."
"He's also hurt, teams like Miami can't sign a guy like kawhi and have him take a year off. Jimmy butler isn't getting any younger."
"&gt;If Jimmy Butler buys a car in Europe that will never come to the US, he now owe them 7%.      This is a lie."
"&gt;Timberwolves fans still hate Jimmy Butler so much, it‚Äôs hilarious. Absolute poverty organization.   Heat fans hate the Wolves only because Jimmy has beef with them. Can you think of anything more pathetic?"
"Timberwolves fans still hate Jimmy Butler so much, it‚Äôs hilarious. Absolute poverty organization."
"That is not how math works.  **A MINNESOTA PLSYER PAYS $0 WHEN PLAYING IN FLORIDA.  A FLORIDA PLAYER PAYS MINNESOTA TAXES WHEN THEY PLAY IN MINNESOTA‚Ä¶OR CALIFORNIA.  You don‚Äôt save 13% of your salary if you play for Miami, and only California has a top tax rate if 13%**.  Miami players still pay state income taxes, and NY, and MN, and every other state.    But Minnesota players don‚Äôt pay this.  Miami Residents must pay a 7% property tax in lieu of sales tax on every car, boat, etc. they buy anywhere in the world in addition to taxes on utilities and everything else.    If Jimmy Butler buys a car in Europe that will never come to the US, he now owe them 7%.  If Butler sells it a year later, he‚Äôs still out that 7%.    Do you really think Florida didn‚Äôt charge extra taxes?"
"90M guaranteed, no state income tax, good friends with Jimmy Butler, sunny south beach.  Anything else?"
It did. It was the correct strategy.  Paying 38 year old Kyle Lowry and 36 year old Jimmy Butler is not.
Are you upset that Jimmy Butler and Bam with the heat got just as far as the thunder did with Westbrook kd and harden?
We didn't want Jimmy butler?
Well the Heat wanted Jimmy Butler while the Sixers didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs one example of competent management versus incompetent management.
"Yeah, they won a title with another all time player in his prime.  Now you're paying an old Jimmy Butler. How the times have changed.."
"Nope. LeBron is a top player of all time. Without him, Miami would be in constant purgatory.  Jimmy Butler is not lebron lmaoooooooo"
They're going to pay Jimmy Butler $50 million at age 36 lol
That‚Äôs jimmy butler money! Crazy!
Some other team would overpay him then just to have the opportunity to get a good Jimmy Butler for a few years. That's how it goes in today's league.
"* NBA Free Agency big deals so far  *Alex Caruso and Lonzo Ball on the Bulls.   *Trae Young signed a 5yr 207 million dollar contract to the Atlanta Hawks.   *Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has agreed to a five-year, $172 million for the OKC Thunder.   *Spencer Dinwiddie is going to the Washington Wizards.  *Blake Griffin is staying in Brooklyn for one year.  *Norman Powell has signed a 5yr 90 million dollar deal with the Portland Trail Blazers.   *Derrick Rose is staying with the New York Knicks for 3yr, 43 million dollar contract.   *Trevor Ariza is signing a 1yr contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.  *Kyle Lowry is signing a 3yr and $90m dollar contract for the Miami Heat.   *Chris Paul is staying with the Phoenix Suns for 4yrs and 120 million dollars.   *All-Star guard Mike Conley has agreed to a three-year, $72.5M contract to stay with the Utah Jazz.   *Jarrett Allen has agreed to a five-year, $100 million contract to stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  *Tim Hardaway Jr.'s four-year deal with the Mavericks is worth $74M.   *Richaun Holmes has agreed to a four-year deal worth as much as $55 million to return to the Sacramento Kings.  *Devonte' Graham is signing with the Pelicans via sign-and-trade.   *Jimmy Butler is expected to agree to a maximum contract extension with the Miami Heat."
They‚Äôre going to be paying Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler $75MM in 2024. Which is probably not going to feel good unless they manage to win the title before then.
"What's your alternative? You have no choice but to pay the player while he's still great, the other option is just lose Jimmy Butler and tank which is stupid."
"That‚Äôs because Harden is in another tier of player so he gets more heat- like saying LeBron gets more criticisms than Jimmy Butler, well yeah, more is expected of him as a upper echelon superstar.  Dame is a star, Harden is a superstar.  Dame is fringe top 10, Harden is top 5, Harden is an MVP superstar talent, Dame is a fun Cinderella outside shot candidate kind of player.  He has lower stakes and less heat because people expect less of him."
&gt; more motivated  here comes this brain dead take  what about him screams unmotivated? the dude literally has been the only bright spot on the shittiest team in sports. it's not his fault his 2nd best player was a pissed off jimmy butler for 1 season and his next best player was lazy ass andrew wiggins
"keeping simmons is the best option so hopefully no bridges have been burned fully.  The regular season still has value you just have to not have the worst choke in franchise history in the playoffs, they were set up to have a legitimate chance to win this year and Simmons was still a big part of that.  Adding was always a better option, having someone to run the offense when Ben turns into a lemon is something we've needed for years.  We had jimmy butler for like 2 months and then decided tobias was a better option...  We really got screwed by the league office when they installed the Colangelos.  Even with everything that has gone wrong you could argue they had chances to win in 2019 and 2021.  From Hinkie getting ousted, Fultz forgetting how to shoot, Colangelo doing nothing for 4 years, Brand lighting everything on fire for 2, to Simmons in the playoffs to Okafor, Colangelo, Brand, Tobias, Butler walking for no return.   I mean you can see all the Hinkie guys getting paid this offseason and even some last offseason.  TJ, Jerami Grant, Richaun Holmes, Covington, Saric.  It is insanity that he may have left us with a better roster in 2015 than we have now (that being Roco/Grant/Saric/Embiid and the first pick being either Simmons or Ingram since he wasnt there to draft).  Then you have so many valuable picks, Nerlens and Jah when they still had value in trades, and room for two maxes.  The way the Sixers fucked this up is absolutely legendary."
"2019 - Toronto champs  2020 - Miami in the finals  2021 - PHX and MIL in the finals  The last three title runs shows that with a little luck any good team can make it to the finals and possibly win it all.  The Heat have 31 yr old Jimmy Butler as their best player and he isn't getting any younger.  The time to go for it is now.  Lowry, Butler and Bam is a damn good big three.  Duncan Robinson, Hero and PJ are really good rotational players."
This is a Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler situation where one is useless when the other has the ball. You would prefer for LeBron to have the ball because he is the better desicion maker but that means Westbrook is useless and his defenser can sag off into the paint making it harder for ad and lebron. Or you can have lebron playing off ball which isn't playing to his strengths at all. I get they need a playmaker to play do anything when LeBron isn't on the court but 50 million sounds mighty expensive for a glorified sixth man. If the issue was playing with LeBron of the court then all i can say it's a coaching issue. The clippers don't have any phenomenal playmaker and still manage to be cohesive with only one of Paul George or kawhi out there all because of the coaching change. It just doesn't feel like the best move without considering how Russel Westbrook has been injured parts of the last four seasons
The Jimmy Butler deal gonna be ass down the road but they‚Äôll be very damn good the next couple years
I thought he called Jimmy Butler.
&gt;  Russ/Devin Booker/Jimmy Butler/Lebron/AD  Apparently not
"I don‚Äôt see the obsession with Giannis going to the Heat. A Giannis, Butler and Bam pairing would be catastrophic with Jimmy and Giannis overlapping too much on offense and Bam and Giannis bringing the same thing on defense. How would Giannis to the Heat work?"
Jimmy Butler Kyle Lowry Demar Derozen all United by crushing losses to Lebron James
"Miami biggest losers, they really went all in on Jimmy ""no jumper, no mcl, stupidly locked in"" Butler because of the bubble. Should have traded him to the warriors for Wiseman and picks and built around Bam."
Jimmy bang yo wife in the bubble Butler
lowry i respect. butler three point shot is not respectable. it is d wade eqsue with his three point shot. teams have 4 shooter out most of the time. bucks had lopez pj kris and jrue. all respectable shooters. raptors had freddy norman ibaka kawhi gasol. all better shooters than jimmy bam demar. pj signing does alleviate this issue
"Miami needed a PF and he's the right price, and all the decent offense creators were off the board already. It's an organization that values defense so he'll be welcomed here.  Starting 5: Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, PJ Tucker, Duncan Robinson  Defense heavy, for sure. We had offense problems last season, looks like we're in for more of it.  If Oladipo signs a small contract then in the later part of the season we can put out a defensive 4th quarter lineup of Lowry, Bam, Jimmy, PJ, and Dipo."
"We arent punting the next 3 years‚Ä¶punting would be doing nothing. You really that naive?   Booker vs Butler is very debatable. Booker is a better shooter, Jimmy is a better facilitator, driver and defense. Paul is better overall, at this point him and Lowry provide pretty close production volume."
"just find it kinda funny how they heat are simping for jimmy butler, but they was playing hard ball with wade"
"When the Heat turned Whiteside, Waiters and James Johnson's contracts into Jimmy Butler, that's all I needed to know."
"Fools gold  They just gave fat contracts to Duncan Robinson, jimmy butler and Kyle Lowry"
kyle lowry and jimmy butler is gonna be so underrated until playoffs. that team is going to go insanely far
Not with this attitude. But if you put on a suit and go in person to meet Jimmy Butler and hand him your resume directly he will hire you on the spot for a well paying job and then you can live in the nice areas of Miami.
No no see Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt shoot logo 3s like Trae Young. Also wtf is defense?
he younger than Steph and only a year older than Jimmy Butler lol plus that‚Äôs like one of the only old Knicks
It‚Äôs fine we‚Äôre getting jimmy butler
Jimmy Butler demands trade in over/under 2.5 years?
Also they only had two all nba players while the bulls had 1 and another all star in jimmy butler. Not even to mention d rose who played better than both jimmy and pau during the playoffs.
"Yeah dude, I'm sure you, the guy who's only experience building a roster is in 2K MyLeague knows more about roster construction than the fucking Boston Celtics' front office.  You keep bringing up Harden despite the fact that Harden wouldn't have made us contenders last year. Toronto traded for Kawhi and the only reason they even won the championship was because KD tore his Achilles during the Finals. We were going to trade for AD, but there's absolutely zero reason to trade for a player who has his heart set elsewhere. And if you think Jimmy Butler or PG13 would've made us Finals contenders years ago, I have a bridge to sell you."
Jimmy Butler would be a promising up and comer in this lakers roster
"And what if a player becomes available during the length of his extension? MIA is literally a top 3 NBA destination.. you will never be able to trade that contract. You're stuck with a maxed out Jimmy Butler now, im not tryna be an asshole but I think Heat fans should be PISSED right now."
"I'll pose the same question: if Jimmy Butler were injured, do you talk about the Bucks like this? They got two out of three teams with injured superstars and they win in 4 with or without Jimmy."
"I guess I you quantify it that specifically, it's hard to match. So, you're saying if Jimmy Butler had been injured, that would somehow invalidate the Bucks ring? My point is, you can't say for sure that the Suns lose against those three teams if they were healthy. It's just a pointless conversation, really."
He should just sign. Jimmy Butler will randomly drive by in the middle of the night and throw bags of money on Demar's lawn if he signs for the MLE.
"At the start of the 22-23 season, Miami will be paying Lowry, Butler and Bam ~106 million. Jimmy will be 34 and Kyle will be 37 going on 38. They‚Äôre pretty solidly in win now mode."
Sadly for the heat they signed Jimmy Butler and not Bubble Butler. This gonna be a big ooof in a year or two
oh i think he's an incredibly phony guy that appears to have lots of people fooled who aren't paying that much attention. everything he says is specifically crafted to uphold the public 'jimmy butler' character he's created of himself. i would certainly hate him if we were co-workers or something.   but at the end of the day he's a hell of a player
"It‚Äôs wild how all of these old vets are getting huge fucking paydays. Jimmy Butler, Kyler Lowry, Kawhi Leonard (eventually), and CP3. Im not saying they‚Äôre undeserved, but the game has changed. These old heads are still producing and valuable to teams despite being ‚Äúpast their prime‚Äù or injury prone‚Ä¶ or both lol"
"which FAs do they have? Jimmy Butler? The top 15 player that they're paying like 45M a year till age 36?   They drafted Bam, Herro, have had Goran for a while. Am i missing somoene?"
maybe it's a dig at the fact that jimmy butler will be making more money than trae as a 36-year-old fossil despite already being the worse player
"Go big or go home I guess, if you're not rebuilding in this league you might as well be competing, and Jimmy Butler definitely makes them more competitive."
Did Jimmy f'n Butler just turn into a negative asset?
‚Ä¶who? Who was going to offer Jimmy Butler a contract that pays $40 million at 32 years old and $50 million at 36?
Jimmy butler will fall off hard by then. The dude struggles to put up good offense like he did in the 2020 nba finals
"yeah probably. but just as someone who watched jimmy butler on my team, there's so much shit he's doing to impact winning that aren't super athleticism dependent"
&gt; fan of team that just extended jimmy butler for 184 million dollars  FUCKING OOF WOW
Lmao like butler wasn't the major force in that happening. Let's pretend like Jimmy wasn't carrying not even a bit and won 2 games in the finals off LeBron fucking James.
"But seasons before and after Jimmy Butler don't bode well for KAT either in terms of playoff basketball. The wolves were 11th seed winning 31 games immediately after Jimmy leaves and that roster wasn't that much better than the current Nuggets roster, it's just that Jokic is a far bigger difference maker than KAT and he makes those around him better."
"Trae Young, SGA, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, and KAT would be my starting lineup."
Jimmy Butler
"Could have been Jimmy Butler type player, but he's an idiot lmao  Shows how being smart can really make a player who isn't as physically gifted (per NBA standards) like CP3 or Butler capable of getting super far in their career compared to guys who are possibly more physically gifted but dumb"
"""thirst guys"" he knows about the Jimmy butler and 3rd stringers, right?"
"Sounds like he's just happy to be on any NBA team, and will hype up whatever team he's on at the moment.   Which is what being a good teammate is all about - these are his new brothers in arms, so he's gonna support them. Would you rather he show up like Jimmy Butler, talking about how they all suck?"
Jimmy Butler has entered the chat
I personally don‚Äôt value team success too much. Jimmy Butler was just the best player on a finals team.
"You gotta contact Jimmy butler, he‚Äôd appreciate your talents in south beach"
"Smart move, get all the players that Jimmy Butler hated for not working hard enough and put them on the same team. That way Jimmy can save all his anger for one game instead of spreading it out over several. Also makes it easier for Simmons and KAT to schedule their Twitch streams.        I am really curious how this would work. Feel like this team would badly need a KG in the locker room"
"It all stems back to Fultz busting IMO. He was supposed to be the third star in their young core they could compete with for 5+ years. Perfect fit next to Embiid and Simmons as a pick and roll point guard who could take pull-up 3‚Äôs and create his own offense in isolation. Basically a better offense and worse defense but much younger version of Jimmy Butler.  Fultz busting led to panic trades for Butler and Tobias Harris, which didn‚Äôt work out."
Jimmy Butler:   Paul George:
"Un popular opinion but trading shooting for Jimmy butler was not the best move long term.  Butlers three was not as bad as it is now. But if Philly committed long term to butler jojo and ben,it would have gotten ugly with three non shooters starting"
Jimmy Butler shot 55% from the field as the best player on his team in the NBA finals and he's not talked about like he's on Iverson's level. Getting to the finals doesn't automatically make you immune from criticism or solidify your career.
Ben Simmons is not a point guard. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been chasing after a ball handler since Jimmy Butler left

"The teams that ""tank because they dont just want to be a 44-38 middle of the pack team"" within 3-4 yrs of tanking realize ""Well shit trying to compete for a title isnt everything lets just be respectable and try to make some postseasons"". Bulls basically have gone full circle on this from the Jimmy Butler trade to now 3-4 yrs later doing the Vuc trade and going all in on this current iteration of their team."
"Next up, Jimmy Butler and KAT üçøüçø"
"Throw a couple contenders for the recent finals  2020- the imagery of Jimmy Butler leaning over the rail after that ridiculous triple double and Danny green‚Äôs brick are probably the most memorable moments from that series   2019- this was a great series, but notable moments I can‚Äôt come up with   2018/2017- KD‚Äôs daggers in both game 3, also we got JR forgetting the score in 2018  2016- self explanatory   2015- there was a 3 where curry turned a cavs defender around that I remember being pretty notable  2014- a vicious Ginobili dunk over Chris Bosh in game 5 was my lasting memory of this series  2013- Parker‚Äôs falling down clincher in game 1, Ray Allen‚Äôs 3 in game 6, and Bosh‚Äôs block over Danny green at the end of game 6 stick out"
I don't believe he got the IT factor. Jimmy Butler exposed that entire roster and they should have traded everyone BUT Butler. Instead they got rid of Wiggins for a lateral move while giving up a lottery pick in the deepest draft to protect this guy's feelings and have a familiar face... I'm sure if you waited a year for DLo's value to keep tanking you could've had him for less.
"It‚Äôs been over 1000 days since Jimmy Butler left i wonder when people will realise KAT has changed a lot since then (although he‚Äôs still not fully figured out how to be a leader). What part of him is soft when he averages 11 rebounds and is one of the best post up players every season? (Don‚Äôt let YT compilations tell you what a player can and can‚Äôt do, folks.)"
"LMAO for sure, they had KG one of the best bigs of all time and did nothing but fuck up. Now they got KAT and are making the same mistake. Not to mention Jimmy Butler. And they didn't pick Curry too lol."
"If they didn't want to learn from Jimmy Butler, the only person to drag them into the playoffs in recent memory, I don't think they're learning from PatBev. Granted there may have been a change in mentality there that I don't know about, but that's my gut feel."
"Remember, MIN once had Jimmy Butler and we all know what happened."
And KAT thought Jimmy butler was bad‚Ä¶..
"I‚Äôm a little confused by your comment. No one is contesting that some people are loud and others are reserved. My question was whether the former are loud because they are more insecure or if that‚Äôs just something which sounds nice to us. Is Jimmy Butler demonstrative because he‚Äôs a hard worker and he gets frustrated when others don‚Äôt match him or is he just super insecure and acting out to hide that? That‚Äôs my question.    If this is so obvious, I don‚Äôt think it should be that hard to prove."
"If Jimmy Butler couldn‚Äôt stand the losing attitude of the Wolves, I‚Äôm sure PatBev will love it! /s"
Jimmy Butler would‚Äôve been an amazing player to set the culture. Wonder if they can get him.
"Yeah, Thibs and Jimmy Butler couldn't set culture, Patrick Beverley obviously will.   /s"
If only they could've had Jimmy Butler.
"supposed to be a playmaking and defending wing with high work ethic and could maybe develop a passable shot. I'm pretty sure his ceiling comparison was jimmy butler lol  and I just remembered, that because of his super religious upbringing, a lot of media people think he doesn't mesh well in the locker room"
Still have Jimmy butler PTSD
"My point is that very few players over history have been highly effective, playing high minutes all the way through the playoffs into their mid-30s. We‚Äôll have to wait and see over the next two years. I think that Lebron, Steph, Kawhi, PG, KD, Harden, Dame, Chris Paul, and Jimmy Butler will get one more championship between them where they are top 1-2 guys on their team. If they win 2 then that group will be pushing the bounds of success for 31+ year old players and proving that longevity has increased in my opinion. If Lebron and CP3 have another playoffs where they‚Äôre fighting injuries the whole time, Kawhi never has another healthy playoffs, and Harden has injuries all year again then I think we‚Äôll know that longevity hasn‚Äôt improved all that much."
He going to pull a Jimmy butler with a bunch of third stringers and a janitor and some how end up in miami.
They said the same thing about Zach Lavine and Jimmy Butler in Minnesota. Then Zach tore his acl and jimmy had a meniscus tear.   Love Thibs as a person but he never learns.
"Kat and Bev,  jimmy butler part two."
There was a lot more going on in that locker room than just KAT not buying into Butler/Thibbs. Jimmy has a toxic personality and a lot of shit was handled wrong by Thibbs.
"KAT couldn‚Äôt buy into KG, Thibbs and Jimmy Butler influence   DLo couldn‚Äôt buy into the Warriors culture in half the season he was there  Big doubt if Pat Bev can swing much here. But at least PatBev can hype up Ant"
"Basketball Reference has Rondo at a 60.5% chance of making the hall.  And there is a lot of guys with lower odds that made it in and he is above active players like Klay and Draymond, Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler"
"&gt;None of my links stated that.  ""Toronto's asking price has been accordingly high: as ESPN's Brian Windhorst reported earlier Thursday, the Raptors have asked for multiple first-round picks and young players, including Philadelphia's Matisse Thybulle and Tyrese Maxey, in order to deal their franchise legend to his hometown.""  \-- [https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/](https://www.phillyvoice.com/nba-trade-rumors-sixers-kyle-lowry-raptors-price-heat-nba-trade-deadline/)  Furthermore, the original point of the thread was that Lowry was not worth Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, and a first -- which you argued for a couple days.  &gt;Miami isn‚Äôt paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don‚Äôt have to,  Well, yeah they are, since Lowry's ask was [$25 x 2.](https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/dallas-mavs-eyeing-kyle-lowry-two-year-deal-nba-free-agency)  Even Lowry didn't think he was worth this contract, and it's not as though adding more AARP-eligible years adds value to the team.  In all likelihood, this contract will be among the league's worst by next season -- as we repeatedly see with expensive deals for players in their mid-to-late thirties.  &gt;especially considering how that deal essentially puts them at the salary cap, and especially because \~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry‚Äôs asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year.  Again, you don't pay more for adding years that late in a career.  &gt;I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it‚Äôs actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.   35 year old Dragic is not better than Caldwell-Pope -- which is why Dragic has not been an NBA starter in four years -- and his play dropped off significantly last year, and his health is unknown.  If they were the same age, that would be true, but Caldwell-Pope is seven years younger.  Dragic also has a worse contract.  &gt;Achiuwa is actually a young prospect.  Achiuwa is an extremely raw 20th pick, which makes him unlikely to be anything but a replacement-level player.  There's obviously a chance he's more, but it's slight.  &gt; It is also better than no return.  If Dragic is healthy and can play.  &gt;They‚Äôve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived.  Kendrick Nunn is a point guard, and played 30 minutes per game for the Heat in both the preceding two seasons.  They also had Vincent for both of those seasons, and he even played 13 minutes per last year.  So, no."
Someone like‚Ä¶ Jimmy Butler?
"Yeah.... but I think Jimmy Butler might be just a little bit better than Pat Bev tho...  I believe he's more so alluding to the ""General Soreness, you fucking need me, get me to Miami"" version of Jimmy Butler instead of the one that actually helped the team."
I mean Jimmy Butler was great for us until he wasn't. I'd take a full year of that. (Reminder: We didn't get that full year of Butler. We were the #3 seed and then he got hurt and bc the West was so competitive we barely squeaked into the playoffs.)
Of course we were a better team with an all NBA forward on it but you are also framing it as if it was a carry job by Butler when in fact he did have another all NBA player with him on the roster.  KAT's health has been the reason the Wolves were so bad these past 2 seasons not lack of Jimmy Butler.
Right nothing to do with your best player that season and culture setter leaving lol  You said everything but Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
True that shout out to Jimmy Butler
This is Timberwolves front office confirming everything Jimmy Butler implied about Ants to be true.
Jimmy Butler 2: Electric Boogaloo incoming?
Hell.  Would be happy to arrange a free cell phone with the only number being to Jimmy Butler=D
"  None of my links stated that. If anything the Raptors were seeking multiple firsts, but no team offered multiple firsts for Lowry‚Ä¶.which is a big reason why we couldn‚Äôt get a deal done in the first place.   Miami isn‚Äôt paying Lowry $5 million more a year if they don‚Äôt have to, especially considering how close they are to the cap, and especially because ~$5M of TPE rarely amounts to shit. Lowry‚Äôs asking price was always around $30 million a year with a 3rd-year. NOLA and Dallas were both willing to give Lowry $30Ms and cleared up significant cap space for it.   I said Toronto was offered KCP/Wes/Trez at the deadline. Dragic/Achiuwa is not a far smaller return, it‚Äôs actually a better return because Dragic is better than KCP and Achiuwa is actually a young prospect. It is also better than no return. So that take didn‚Äôt age well.   They‚Äôve only had 1 true point guard (Dragic) since Jimmy Butler arrived. Might even be longer than that because it was the same case during the Waiters/Winslow/Johnson/Whiteside days."
jimmy butler never gets criticized properly or fairly while guys like trae and harden are overly criticized + he just comes off as super obnoxious to me.
"Jimmy Butler. He's just gotten really irritating to me over the years, in the media and his antics on the court."
"people like to compare him to bron, now if that were bron and lets just assume for arguments sake he didnt really want to shoot, and its a younger bron, you reckon hes walking the ball down the court on these posessions?!  lebron would be going like a freight train, basically like giannis, trying to get every last bit of value out of his ability to drive and transition offense.  i guess we have to cut simmons some slack here because of youth, still, how hard is it to understand your strengths?!  i also dont have within recent memory how that series played out, im guessing raptors did a number on curbing simmons.  phillies whole offense looks like its given the keys, the deeds, the codes, secret passwords, everything to butler to win for them. (and respect to jimmy, he tried to deliver the goods)"
"butler is trying so fucking hard to get them something, i respect that, and why is simmons just walking up the floor, i figure his biggest win condition right here is pushing. At least drive and kick for jimmy"
Who‚Äôs jimmy? I was referring to the late great jazz artist Jacques butler. Do I not have a flair on? Coulda sworn it says I‚Äôm into jazz
"I've seen Westbrook wear a Metallica shirt. But he probably just does it to look cool because that's what literally every celebrity does to act like they have good taste in music, So they'll put on an Iron Maiden shirt.  But judging by generations the only person who doesn't listen to hip-hop that I know off is Jimmy Butler."
Jimmy Butler
"Bulls offered Jimmy Butler 4/40 in 2014 (he was due to become a RFA in summer of 2015), Butler turned down the deal to bet on himself. He had a breakout season in 14/15, winning MIP  He signed for 5/90 in the summer of 2015"
jimmy butler
"Joel embied, jj reddick, jimmy butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons  and al holford all on the same team and still could reach finals??!?! How?!?!!?!"
I find it hard to believe they ranked Kyle Lowry over Jimmy Butler. Kyle is great but Jimmy was borderline mvp level at times last year.
"People act like the Wolves never had talent when almost every year they are a dark horse playoff team. I spent like five years thinking, ‚Äúoh man, these Wolves are a team to watch!‚Äù until I realized KAT just doesn‚Äôt make anyone any better. They underperform every year. It certainly doesn‚Äôt help him that Wiggins never ever developed at all considering his own hype.   I think it is also telling that Jimmy Butler couldn‚Äôt get out of Minnesota fast enough, because all he wants to do is win and he didn‚Äôt feel like MN was the right place for that. A lot of that was on KAT. If you are the dominant big everyone says he is, than there would almost be no better team to be on than the Wolves for Jimmy. I mean, that 17-18 team was absolutely loaded. KAT, Butler, Wiggins, Jeff Teague, Derrick Rose, Jamal Crawford, Taj Gibson with Tom Thibodeau coaching and people act like KAT never had any help.  They were the 8th seed after Jimmy got hurt halfway through the season. They were in the top 4 of the West before that. It‚Äôs like KAT tries to not make the playoffs. I‚Äôm sure if the season were ten games longer, they probably would have missed it then too.   All those underperforming seasons really soured me on KAT."
And Kyle Lowry is better than Jimmy Butler? Wtf?
"JJ tied the game on an and 1 with 3:29, after that raptors possession goes as follows.  Ibaka misses three pointer  Kawhi misses 27 ft jumper  Kawhi Makes pullup jumper  Siakam Makes layup  Kawhi misses 9ft shot  Kawhi misses three pointer  Then with 10.8 seconds left Kawhi was fouled and missed 1 which set up a jimmy butler game tying layup.  That left the raptors team with 2 buckets in a three minute stretch and only one of those buckets came from a half court offense. While it is better than three shot clock violations, I still think it was the worse that their offense looked during that entire playoff run. While both teams were tired after 7 games, sixers defense still deserves credit (and I think Brett Brown deserves a lot of credit for out coaching or at least coaching up to the same level that nurse was at)"
imagine if the 76ers had a star level creator like jimmy butler to close games in big moments.
Jimmy Butler was so close to becoming an enemy of Toronto. His will was unshakable.
"Not only no but hell no. I think KAT is a likable guy, but he's allergic to winning basketball. I'd blame it on the city of Minnesota being cursed, but Jimmy Butler dragged them to the playoffs. Without Jimmy Butler, KAT has not only been kept out of the playoffs, the closest the Wolves have gotten is still a full 10 wins behind 8th place.  I don't want that curse anywhere near my team. If I have to pick a center for a max contract, I wouldn't just pick Embiid and Jokic first, I'd pick Gobert, I'd pick Adebayo, I'd pick Ayton, and I'd legit pick Clint Capela over KAT if my goal is to win games.  There's the hot take people were looking for. KAT is definitely one of the most talented centers in the league, but I legitimately believe Clint Capela, an excellent starter who's nowhere near All-Star level, would be more of a contributor to a winning team. I expect some people to fire back at me on this, but I'm standing by it. KAT does not play winning basketball and I don't want to tank forever."
"The narrative that Jimmy butler and CP are ""great leaders""... IMO a great leader is someone who gets the stragglers to buy in.. it should not be surprising that guys like CP and Jimmy can get a bunch of 23 year olds to buy in.. that is the only time we've seen CP3 or Jimmy lead men... when the group of men is mostly 23- 25 year olds.. any time CP and/or jimmy had to get equal or better level talent to buy in, they seemed to have issues (ben simmons, blake, KAT, Harden to name a few that these guys couldnt get on the same page)"
"If you wanna talk about AST/TO let‚Äôs do it. There are still many players with comparable to higher usage that do way better. Like Chris Paul, the Joker, Dame, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowery. All of whom play just as large as roles, if not bigger, on their team as Russ."
"I mean in no particular order: LeBron, Giannis, Luka, KD, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Embiid, Jokic, AD, Dame, Trae Young, PG-13, Tatum, Booker, CP3, Mitchell, Jimmy Butler, and potentially Westbrook, Beal, Klay, Zach LaVine, KAT as well, too.  Give Beal/LaVine/KAT 4 seasons of apex LeBron as a teammate &amp; they absolutely can win a chip."
KAT mailed it in when Jimmy Butler took the Wolves to the playoffs.  He‚Äôs not a winning player.   Meanwhile Booker stepped up his game as soon as he made the playoffs.
"Zion is definitely better than Jaylen Brown and Jimmy Butler.  Ingram is ranked too low, while Ja is ranked too high."
"John wall right now, but in a couple years it's gonna be jimmy butler"
"raptors because fuck the raptors lmao, heat because jimmy butler is a fake, trailblazers because it would be funny to see them lose in the first round again, and bucks because they only won last year because of injuries"
"Booker at best is a neutral defender at best, just like LaVine or Beal. And like I stated as someone who watches all 3 of them, I PERSONALLY believe Lavine and Beal are better. I‚Äôll give you that Booker can be put above them right now because of his finals run (Beal and Lavine just haven‚Äôt had that opportunity) but Booker is not 13 places better than Lavine man. I mean, Ja Morant is above him that‚Äôs crazy. Lol.   Also, Booker is not a ‚Äúreally good‚Äù player maker. Trae is. He‚Äôs a negative defender sure, but Booker is like you said not an elite defender while Trae‚Äôs playmaking ability is elite. Trae was dominating against 3 of the top 5 defenses in the league before he got injured. His playoff run was arguably just as special. Kyrie cannot lead a team either but he‚Äôs coming off a 50/40/90 season and is more proven than Booker.   As far as PG, you didn‚Äôt mention him and IMO there‚Äôs no argument for Booker &gt; PG right now. And Jimmy Butler is coming off a year of injuries and underperforming in one playoff series but there‚Äôs only a handful of guys who impact winning basketball games more than Jimmy."
"Lotta names before Jimmy Butler that don't contribute to winning as much. I get his last season performance left something the be desired like shooting, but dude is a top 15 player in my eyes. I also don't think Book is a top 15 player, top 20 yes but top 15 is too high. He's gotta show more throughout the season. I'd be willing to admit I'm wrong based on the season."
Neither are close to Butler defensively and Jimmy is an amazing slasher and better playmaker than the two  The man was putting up 40 point triple doubles on LeBron James in the finals last year. One bad playoff series does not bring him down  Also how the fuck is Devin Booker better than Paul George
There's quite a few players on this list higher than Jimmy Butler that aren't actually better than Jimmy Butler
"based off what you showed,   butler averages more points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, less fouls, less turnovers, better ts%, per, ws48, bpm  you also didnt even include two years where jimmy was all nba and middleton wasnt even an all star"
"idk Judith Butler's contributions to Queer Theory is STRONG, IDK if Jimmy Butler can compare tbh"
No way Butler gets forgotten and I am not talking about just his finals run. Jimmy has a grand personality. He is friends with celebrities and constantly dates stars. Jimmy will probably be a Michael Strahan type. I don't think he will act but Jimmy will be around he loves the spotlight.
Lots of Lebron post today huh? Let's go back to Jimmy Butler day.
"&gt;	lol seriously, there were constant debates about how to rank Hayward/PG13/Butler the year before he joined the Celtics.  I don‚Äôt remember that at all, sounds like revisionist history lol. IIRC Jimmy made all nba that year"
"Ok go through the teams that'd trade, all things equal, their best player straight up for Jimmy..   No: LAL, LAC, Jazz, Portland, Phoenix, Denver, mavs, grizz, warriors, pelicans, Minny, Houston, Philly, nets, bucks, hawks, Celtics, wizards, hornets, Detroit  Maybe: sac, OKC, raptors, cavs  Yes: spurs, Knicks, pacers, bulls, magic.   By that, albeit crude, metric he'd be 20th. That's not even considering all the teams with multiple players they'd rather keep over butler. Boston, warriors, nets, jazz, Lakers, clippers. Then maybe Milwaukee, phoenix and Denver.   Butler isn't bad but his game is from the old version of the NBA."
"How they should be and how they are, are too completely sperate arguments. Refs got it right according to the rules.  The worst ones are when we see a ball go out because of a foul. They don't call the foul and can't review why the ball went out. They just look for the last person that touched it.  I saw Jimmy Butler get slapped across the arms. They called it off the opposition first. They did a review and it got over turned to off Miami, which it clearly was. Only reason it went out though was because of the foul.  Edit: To your point, it is stupid because they wouldn't allow the shot to count if the hooter went off. It has to be out of the hands for it to count."
"Thibs keeping in rose when bulls were up 12 with 1 minute left, then proceeds to tear his ACL.  Yes you could say this is bad luck but Thibs has a bad habit of overplaying guys, like playing Jimmy Butler the whole game (and in one case 53minutes when game went to OT) but luckily butler is one durable dude."
"I know it's pointless to engage with trolls, but you seriously believe that Jimmy Butler should be ranked that low? What sport are you watching? The dude averaged 21/7/7 last year on 60% TS and led the league in steals -- those are elite numbers. The year before he led a team to the Finals. Idk who in their right mind would put him anywhere below 20."
"Jimmy Butler also had better offensive options around him last year to finish his passes. ""Only 6 points per game"" is literally bigger than the difference between Steph and Jayson Tatum, 6 points at that level is massive. Jimmy's scoring is probably his biggest liability and is the biggest issue with him as a first option"
"Weird how you left off the one stat that is directly related to the score, Jayson Tatum averaged more ppg then jimmy Butler has ever averaged in his 4th year. It is absolutely not unreasonable to pick the person who has made the ECF in 2/4 years and while I agree jimmy is a better defender the Celtics lacked defensive identity this year but Tatum had shown he can be an excellent defender before so it's not like comparing the best defender ever to the worst. ""Doing everything better except scoring"" is kind of a big deal."
"Yeah thank God they add up all your intangibles at the end of the game and add it to the score, otherwise I might take the guy who dropped 50 on KD over jimmy Butler."
Jimmy Butler
"jimmy butler is an elite finisher, a far above average playmaker, an elite defender ‚Äî the literal only thing tatum is doing better is shooting from range. why is this an argument?  if i'm trying to make a team i'm picking up jimmy... and just giving him a shooter to create for ‚Äî it's a lot easier than picking tatum and giving him a point guard and defenders to help him"
"Oh... a lot.   People don't remember guys.   I mean, you go back to the 80s... there were so many studs. Adrian Dantley. Mark Aguirre. Fat Lever. Derrick Harper. Alex English. Jack Sikma. Sindey Moncrief. Ricky Pierce. Dale Ellis. Alvin Robertson. Tom Chambers. Mark Price. Hersey Hawking. Rick Smits. Rod Stickland.  Terry Porter.   Lots of great players. People forget. The Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, and Bulls just destroyed so many teams. Between 1980, and 1998, only two teams won a title other than those four: Rockets and Sixers.   The Bucks has some really good squads in the 80s I remember.   &amp;#x200B;  So, looking at that, I'd say guys like Dame Lillard will likely be a name that people will be like ""Oh yeah, that guy was great.""    Paul George and Jimmy Butler, unless they win a title.   Same goes for Mitchell and Gobert. Randle. Beal. Wall. Kemba. Isiaih Thomas  If it's possible to forget an MVP, then I think Joker might fade from the memory with time unless he wins a title. I mean, I don't know a lot of young folks who pull out Dave Cowens comparisons ever, and that dude won an MVP, two rings, and ROY.  I feel like Blake has enough crazy highlights that people will remember him. Melo is like Nique or Gervin... or Bernard King. He was just such a prolific scorer. I doubt he'll be easily forgotten.   Hard to say though.   It seems like, the further we go along with time, the more accessible the history of the game is, so the more permanent players are.   People know Stockton, Malone Barkley, and Miller, even though they didn't win title. Maybe fewer know Run TMC.    But in the 90s, I don't most young fans at that time would have been able to tell you Dave Cowens was. For a lot of people, the NBA really started with Bird and Magic, and all you really need to know about the NBA before that time was Wilt, Russell, and Kareem."
"Kawaii, Jimmy Butler, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, Kyrie Irving, and as much as it pains me Beal"
If you‚Äôd take Jimmy Butler over Tatum when trying to make a team you‚Äôre delusional.
"I assume Jimmy Butler will make it, so I guess Conley, Wall and Kemba"
Jimmy also doesn't have the luxury of playing next to Giannis.    Did people already forget about the 2020 finals run? Butler had 2 30+ pt triple doubles in the finals against the eventual champions.
"Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Zach Lavine, etc...  they need to make a championship run or have some exceptional games like harden or lilliard to be not forgotten."
"I don't think that's *that* unpopular. Tatum outplayed Butler in the ECF even though the Heat won (although you could chalk that up to the matchup‚Äî we had a ton of wing defenders to throw at Jimmy, but no one who could slow down Bam, so it's no surprise Bam looked like the Heat's best player that series)."
[We have Jimmy Butler at home.](https://missouristatebears.com/images/2017/9/29/MOST_Johnson_Alize.jpg)
"Did you edit your comment? Could of sworn you put Joe Harris instead of Jeff Green. Nonetheless, I was just giving examples of long, strong players who could help build a wall (which you'd really want 3 players to help execute here). Heat also had Jimmy Butler, Iggy, and Olynik to help Bam/Crowder.   To put it into perspective the Suns had Cam Johnson as their 3rd biggest player at 210 pounds. The Heat had 7 players bigger than Cam playing in that series. Giannis averaged 21 points vs the Heat."
Jimmy Butler is back in Chicago
Jimmy Butler is back in Chicago
Simmons does this every single year and hasn‚Äôt improved offensively. Jimmy butler has played well in the playoffs multiple times. And his numbers seem to be going down now too
Jimmy Butler in shambles
Nah Jimmy Butler. Neither guy shoots 3s well enough to combo into kawhi. But demar with defense is pretty much jimmy butler.
"&gt; If it's shooting, and the shot is maybe fixable?  Jimmy Butler and early Kahwii are good comps for that type of wing.  They were rotation players even when they were not shooters."
Did you watch Jimmy butler this year?
And instead they kept both and got rid of Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson.
"&gt; but Butler would be the go to guy if you want to lift a team up   This is after the D.Rose injury of course.   Also factor in you evaluation the teammates Jimmy have compared to D.Rose.    D.Rose literally carried a franchise all by himself and broke down.   To those who have followed the Bulls, most would easily be biased on D.Rose up to that point. Because D.Rose challenged a prime LeBron with two superstars with him. Jimmy on the other hand was traded. Because GarPax didn't see him as someone worthy of a supermax.     But since D.Rose didn't recover as expected from his ACL injury. His career coursed a different path. And it's not even fair to compare."
Butler. I grew up watching the Bulls early 2010 era. I loved watching them battle night in night out. Two of my favorite players for sure. I love my boy D-Rose but Jimmy is a dawg.
Jimmy Butler at peak ‚Äúfuck around and find out‚Äù energy.
Jimmy Butler also gets in the Kawhi mold.  The absolute worst one though is the KD comps.  Any taller guy with decent ball handling and can shoot 3s automatically gets put as the new KD.  So many players get drafted because they have the same physical profile and aren't even a quarter of the talent KD is.
"Jimmy Butler had a better career, which is sad to say because Rose was far ahead in terms of potential"
"Jimmy Butler is also a better player than Ben Simmons, and even so, I still think it's wild to pay millions of dollars to not go to work."
Jimmy butler definitely - career wise. I‚Äôm a rose fan btw:)
Jimmy Butler did the same and it went pretty well for him.
"Overall, it‚Äôs Jimmy. But D Rose at his peak was a Top 10, possibly even Top 5 player in 2011 and 2012 before the injury. So yeah, Jimmy Butler"
2020 Playoff Jimmy Butler &gt; 2011 Playoff Rose
"I would counter that teams obsess over this player archetype for good reason. Jimmy Butler, Paul George... any hyper-athletic 6'7""+ guy that can do everything BUT one thing is super valuable. If it's shooting, and the shot is maybe fixable? Worth gambling on all day."
"i know every defensive wing gets this comparison, but patrick williams is extremely similar to kawhi leonard  RJ reminds me of Jimmy Butler sometimes"
"Jimmy Butler isn't exactly the most unbiased source there lol. I agree Hinkie had misses, just like every GM. I still think he would've done a lot better than who replaced him."
"PG: Kyle Lowry  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Duncan Robinson  PF: PJ Tucker  C: Bam Adebayo  Key Bench Players: Tyler Herro, Victor Oladipo, Max Strus, Markieff Morris, Dewayne Dedmon"
"Jimmy Butler, as a bulls fan, I was always indifferent about him honestly, just thought his game was just blah, up until the year he and wade played together. Then the stuff in Minnesota happened and i thought as much as he may feel like this, he‚Äôs not a good enough player to talk this much shit üòÇ. But he definitely earned my respect leading the heat to that championship run last year tho"
"No. Teams in the West weren't giving up much. The Rockets wanted Jimmy Butler over a second player with an injury risk even if the Spurs would have even looked at them. The only other serious offers were the Lakers and Clippers which weren't clearly better. If the Timberwolves were honest with themselves about Butler, maybe they should have gotten involved.   The East didn't really bid against the Raptors. The Spurs would have been good with either Embiid or Simmons. A Simmons trade would have left the Sixers probably at least equally equipped to beat the Bucks as the Raptors were."
Jimmy butler. Now he in Miami and fawks with him.... love his determination and how hard he plays
Jimmy Butler. I'm a Raps fan and disliked him in the 2019 playoffs when he was on Philly. I'm excited to see him and Lowry team up in Miami.
"Even in the last 5 years , prime Jimmy Butler for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a second round pick was a travesty, especially if Houston‚Äôs 4 FRP offer was real. I get that RoCo was a valuable role player in his prime and Saric was coming off a really good sophomore season, but that isn‚Äôt enough for what Butler offers"
"Can name a few   LeBron James, I hated all the hype he got in his early career. Was an avid Carmelo Anthony fan and thought he would be better. I definitely grew to love watching LeBron play.   Kobe Bryant. Allen Iverson is my favorite all time player, so that was a big influence in me disliking kobe. I did grow to love watching him play, and grew to love him as a person. RIP  Jimmy Butler. For a while I thought he was an asshole but he definitely is just committed to winning. Have to respect someone who gives their all trying to win with whatever team he is on."
"you spot on my boy, how you gone talk about demar not getting out the second round when you can‚Äôt even get to the party w/o a year of jimmy butlerü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Jimmy Butler. Thought he was a locker room cancer for a long time then I realized how hard of a worker the guy is and then that finals game where he played like 47 minutes sealed the deal for me. Jimmy Buckets is cool in my book now. Also his Hot Ones is hella funny.
"Sad to say but Derrick Rose is probably in that category. Also Horace Grant, Joakim Noah, Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng, and maybe Jimmy Butler. Butler probably has a better chance than Rose."
"Timberwolves fans:  Bane   Do you really think disparaging our team bothers us?  Putting on that marvelous show while puffing your chest out, all that energy spent just to hide the truth from yourselves; that your front office and coaching staff is incompetent and you are going to fall short of your aspirations because of it.  Theatricality and deception are powerful agents to the uninitiated.  We are most certainly the initiated.    Poor Philadelphia, who looked up at the light after their short stay in the shadows, thinking they invented the Process.  Ohhhh, you thought the Process was your ally, you merely adopted the Process.  We were born in it, molded by it, we didn‚Äôt see the light until Ant played like an all star in the second half of his rookie season.  We even sent you Jimmy Butler as your last hope to win, knowing you would squander it.  The Process betrays you, because it belongs to us.    Now we will take Simmons for the same pittance we gave you Butler, a debt to be paid, and have 5 potential all stars starting in their young prime with a solid bench.    As for the rest of the so called large markets, success is a menace, it tricks smart people into thinking they can‚Äôt lose.  Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.  You will fade slowly as your overpaid, aging superstars become negative contracts.  Meanwhile the Milwaukee‚Äôs and the Phoenixes and the Utahs and the Denver‚Äôs will rise with us.  We come here not as conquerors but as liberators, to return control of this league to the people.  The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests, and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure.  The lottery will be your only hope for years."
Twolves Nuggets 2018 fight for 8th seed last game of the season Jimmy Butler coming back to early from injury leading the Wolves to the victory. Had Denver Won they would have been the 8th seed
"Too much love: Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Bradley Beal, Zion, Paul George, Tobias Harris  Too much hate: KAT, James Wiseman, Myles Turner, Porzingis, Lauri Markkanen, Kyle Kuzma, pretty much any role player that Lakers/Lebron fans want to throw under the bus whenever the team isn‚Äôt playing well."
nah. if the bucks lost in the playoffs to the raptors without kawhi or the heat without jimmy butler then you'd have a point.  Like the jazz literally lost because they could not stop terence mann. they will never be good enough.
"As unlikely as it may seem right now, the Sixers path to success is for Zach Lavine to inform the Bulls he won't re-sign despite the moves they made, and for him and Rich Paul to see his best chance at a ring with fellow Klutch client Ben Simmons in Philadelphia.  Winning a chip or coming close with the Sixers dramatically increases the value of three Klutch Sports properties (Simmons, Lavine, Maxey).   Meanwhile, I'm not sure Demar Derozan and Lonzo Ball fit all that well around Lavine.  Is Derozan gonna bury 3pt shots after Lavine drives and kicks it?  I dont think so.  Is Lavine going to cede the #1 scoring role to Derozan and wait for kickouts?  I don't think so.  With all of them together, I still don't think they're better than Atlanta or Boston.   Besides that, the Bulls lost Thaddeus Young and Otto Portert and Lauri Markkanen, but just took Portland's FRP instead of Larry Nance Jr.  I suspect they signed Derozan to a marquee contract and Lonzo Ball to carry the weight after Lavine leaves instead of seriously thinking those guys can make the conference finals in the East.    Because he was in a contract year and had say in where he was going, the Bucks got Jrue Holiday for has-been Eric Bledsoe and picks.  Also in his contract year, the Sixers got Jimmy Butler for Dario Saric and Robert Covington.  It's a players league.  Zach Lavine and Rich Paul have the power.   **Ben Simmons, Zach Lavine, Matisse Thybulle, Tobias Harris, Joel Embiid**  **Tyrese Maxey, Shake Milton, Furkan Korkmaz, Paul Reed, Andre Drummond**"
Jimmy Butler. Solid player but doesn‚Äôt put up the stats and probably won‚Äôt win a championship.
so why didn't Jimmy Butler get fined in Minnesota?  I don't get that shit.  They shouldn't and won't fine Ben Simmons.  Philly shamed him as if he isn't a human being.  Fuck outta here.
Who they could have? Think of all the big names who got moved over the past two or three years through trades. Aside from Kawhi they could have gone in on Jimmy Butler. Jrue was an option to take a swing at.  Other than that you‚Äôve got PG13 and Harden who wanted out of their situations via trades. Harden especially got traded for what amounts to a bag of nothing. Wouldn‚Äôt count AD here considering how hard he poisoned the well of offers and forced his way to LA.  That‚Äôs basically 5 of the top 25-30 players in the league (who actually fit with Dame) who were all available at one point or another in the past 3 years.
"&gt;I know they can shoot better, but it's fake giving me Rondo/Wade/Butler Bulls vibes  Different situation pairing a relative non shooter in Derozan with a shooter in Lavine versus pairing 2 non shooters in Rondo/Wade with another non-shooter in Jimmy Butler after hiring a ""pace and space"" coach they essentially killed their space and pace.  The Derozan/Lonzo signings are slightly different in that they are more complementary than marquee names designed to put asses in seats.  The Wade/Rondo moves were from a management team that ran the Bulls like a business trying to turn a profit while the Lonzo/Derozan signings are more basketball moves for on court production designed to maximize what you can get out Lavine rather than trying to sell jerseys and tickets.  I do think the Bulls deliberately overpaid for Derozan not because they liked Derozan that much, but more as an announcement to the rest of the league's top players that the Bulls are under a new regime and they will spend money on you."
Ben has plenty of leverage.  He‚Äôs going to follow the Vince Carter/Jimmy Butler/James Harden playbook.  He can just not pass to Embiid the entire time he‚Äôs out there.    You‚Äôll pay him whether or not you play him.
I don‚Äôt think the Jimmy Butler or Harden comparison works at all. Those guys are so good that teams aren‚Äôt going to care about them making a stink.  Is Simmons worth trading for with his on court AND now off court bullshit?
"Jimmy butler would be forgotten, the dude lead his team to the finals, could have lead philly to a championship if it weren‚Äôt for a couple of bounces,   , contrary to what the media says, his team does really well,   And whenever he leaves that said team, they struggle,"
"the lenght of the contract means nothing as we've learned in the last years.   he probably wont sit out for a whole season (let alone 4 years) and lose a shitton of money, but he also doesnt have to because the sixers dont want a grumpy Simmons around the team. thats just going to turn the locker room into a toxic mess. you can look at the Jimmy Butler situation in Minnesota or the Harden situation in houston as examples for this.   so the sixers will tell him to stay home (without getting fined) until they found a trade. which brings us to the next problem: the sixers maybe can stay afloat while having 30 or so million of their cap space just sitting at home but its not something that you want for obvious reasons.   thats his leverage."
"How did Butler sabotage Minny?  He dragged them kicking and screaming to the playoffs.  They were a bottom tier team before him, they were a bottom tier team after him.  Jimmy wanted to win, they didn‚Äôt, he left.  Minny is a dumpster fire of an organization and they‚Äôve made the playoffs only once since KG, thanks to Jimmy.  If you can waste KG‚Äôs prime, fat K Love, the best shooting center ever (KAT) and players like Wiggins and Lavigne are crazy better the second they‚Äôre out, you‚Äôre a shit organization.  It wasn‚Äôt Jimmy‚Äôs fault in Minny, and it is Ben‚Äôs problem in Philly.  Not comparable situations.  Kawhi definitely forced himself out of SAS, but he had to waste an entire season and declare he wanted to go to LA just to be sent on a 1 year rental to Toronto.  And even then there was more good will and value attached to Kawhi‚Äôs name than Ben‚Äôs.  Ben fucked up good and people have taken a fine tooth comb to his lack of improvement and wasted potential.  Embiid became a 40% 3 pt shooter to hide him on offense, outrageous."
"&gt;They went from the 3 seed to the 8 seed because Jimmy Butler got injured. They were 37-22 when Butler played and 10-13 when he didn't play. So they had a 63% win percentage when he played, which would have been the 3rd best in the west.  my point is that the team was carried on the backs of Butler and KAT. Imagine if the rest of the team actually fit around Butler and KAT. Because Simmons does fit in extremely well next to KAT,D'lo and Ant.  &gt;1: because the game is not played on paper. If you think D'lo/Edwards/?/Simmons/KAT can compete for a 3 seed, then why couldn't D'lo/Edwards/Beasley/McDaniels/KAT compete for anything last year?  Because D'lo missed 30 games,KAT 20 and Beasley 20+. Besides that Ant was a huge negative until after ASB,Ryan Saunders tanked the team and the roster had a gaping whole at PF.  &gt;2: because Jimmy butler is a better floor raiser than any of KAT, Simmons, etc. Already showed the wolves record with/without him &amp; the heat in his 2 seasons are 71-39 when he plays 13-22 when he's out.  Simmons is also a huge floor raiser that solves our biggest issue."
"&gt;Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT held the 3rd seed for most of the season   They went from the 3 seed to the 8 seed because Jimmy Butler got injured.

that would be fine he would go in like Jimmy Butler.   clowning everyone in practice    and shouting YOU NEED MEEEEE
Jeff Teague/Andrew Wiggins/Jimmy Butler/Taj Gibson/KAT   held the 3rd seed for most of the season so I don't see how  D'lo/Anthony Edwards/?/Ben Simmons/KAT can do any worse lol.
They should trade for jimmy butler
Just cause he looks exactly like jimmy butler lol
Never forget [Jimmy Butler in a Luke Bryan video](https://youtu.be/3yyZ0UOZgcQ)
"Big alpha dog Jimmy Butler with his Rachel Nichols interview lined up right after his ""spontaneous"" outburst at practice"
"Instead of hearing that Jimmy Butler dominated the starters with the third stringers, wed be hearing that Joel Embid clocked Ben."
Sixers should pick up this guy to get Jimmy Butler back.  Also from Pennsylvania (where the 76ers play if the Balls are reading this)
"His stats are far above average. 14.6/4.8/5.7 with 1.5 steals is very respectable and the list of players who average his statline or better is:  1.	Jimmy Butler 2.	LaMelo Ball  And that's the whole list. Obviously it's very selective to include all of those stats, but it helps to illustrate that Lonzo provides good stuff all around - solid rebounder, good passer, good defender (steals don't precisely correlate to defense bit they are still valuable), and can hit threes. It's not a super common skillset."
"Alright cool so they fine him for a week and force him to come, now what? Jimmy Butler in Minnesota part 2?"
Like Covington and Saric for Jimmy Butler?
Discount Jimmy Butler
"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs enough. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a terrible offer though.   Trade value can plummet when a player threatens to sit out. For instance, Philadelphia traded Robert Covington, Dario Saric, and a second round pick for Jimmy Butler when he demanded a trade. This proposed offer from the Timberwolves is certainly better than that trade. Beasley is a 40%, high volume shooter, McDaniels has a lot of potential, Reid is a solid backup center, and Beverley has a ton of playoff experience. The 76ers also have a chance to package the first round picks for a Star later.   Honestly, I‚Äôm not really sure if a drastically better offer is out there:  -	The Raptors reportedly don‚Äôt want Simmons after drafting Scottie Barnes. Which makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Warriors don‚Äôt think that Simmons and Draymond fit. Which also makes sense, since neither can shoot.  -	The Kings are unwilling to offer Fox or Haliburton, and an offer based around Buddy Hield seems similar to the Wolves current offer.  -	The Trailblazers aren‚Äôt trading Lillard. Maybe they‚Äôre willing to trade CJ? I‚Äôm not sure about that though, cause CJ and Lillard are best friends. There are also reports that the Trailblazers think Simmons is too ball dominant for Lillard. Plus, I don‚Äôt think Simmons can really coexist with Nurkic and Nance."
"Almost like our problem has consistently been shot creation in the clutch instead of ""spacing"". Good thing our FO went and got really good shot creation players over the last few years like Tobias Harris and Al Horford while alienating Jimmy Butler."
"Boy, it's almost like they could use a third star like a Jimmy Butler type or something..."
"Lol, this is exactly what we're talking about here. Lavine has a fucking negative basketball IQ when it comes to defense and defensive instincts. Dude might be able to function as a net-neutral with proper coaching and good pieces around him, but he is not good. Good is Jimmy Butler or Paul George, good is not ""oops, i forgot about a rotation 5 plays in a row but made a nice steal or lateral shift a couple times so my fans forgot about my bad plays that led to a dude getting dunked on"""
"What you are saying is true.  However, the Sixers know this as well and have been trying to draft a chucker to take over in the 4th like Jimmy Butler did three years ago.  It's so important, the Sixers traded up to #1 for Markelle Fultz.  But going back to your point about leverage, Morey and Sixers fans are or should be justifiably excited about Tyrese Maxey filling that role, I think.  Maxey is as much of a hit as Matisse Thybulle.  The sky is not falling."
I won‚Äôt accept this jimmy butler slander
Not totally disagreeing with you but I think the Bulls will benefit from acquiring Ball and Caruso and having a good defender on the opponent's main ball handler in most games; a luxury they haven't enjoyed since Jimmy Butler.
"Also its often overlooked what they actually improved.  For instance when he played with us, Bogdanovic really improved his defense.  However it was only against a subset of opposing wings and forwards who needed to use size and strength to score.  Against guys with quicker lateral speed, he got torched, and nothing could stop that.  Yes against Lebron he really improved his defense, but Jimmy Butler took  him to the woodshed and threw the body afterwards in the woodchipper.  Sometimes also other fanbases over estimate a guys defense because they don't watch his games.  Lot of off season trade proposal threads on Brogdon over-estimated his defense, lauding his size often.  They never watched him get torched while playing on-ball defense against small quick guards.  (they also saw fairly good assist numbers while not realizing his failures as a playmaker)"
"The main superstars who are good on D are Giannis, Davis, Tatum, Embiid, Paul George, Jimmy Butler."
I really think Jimmy Butler would have loved playing with Lavine. I think he would have been a great mentor for Lavine too.
"Kyrie is going to become an activist.  LeBron is going to be a GM, business mogul, actor, producer  The real question is, WHO BECOMES A SHOW HOST?!  How great would it be if Kahwai was a host.  Imagine him with Klay Thompson or Jimmy Butler or Steven Adams just shooting the shit on an NBA show."
"Lol yea young players don‚Äôt develop, you think James Harden, PG, Leonard, Jimmy Butler had the handles they have rn in their first 2 years?"
Jimmy butler he doesn‚Äôt act like a leader to me Dnt take control over the games just being a role player lately
"Shame on the Wolves fans for painting this picture that Jimmy Butler was still under contract with the team.   Like obviously Thibs handled it *horribly* and they should have traded him sooner. But this take is bogus. The dude was literally still under contract with the team. Even if the front office was stupid enough to not trade him, he still has an obligation to that contract. You don't just get to weave in and out of that situation as you see fit lmao."
"I have the opposite, jimmy butler. basically this simmons situation on steroids"
Hear me out. Hire jimmy butler to break embiid‚Äôs legs in the middle of the night. We tank for 2 more years and complete the process.
Jimmy Butler or Rondo. Both are just dudes that look like they hate losing and I can respect that.
Krawczynski keeps using the terrible deal Thibs made with Butler as a barometer. Glad Bodner pointed out that Simmons isn't likely to detonate the locker room like Jimmy did.
"And they were refusing to extend/pay Jimmy market value. He told them if they weren‚Äôt going to pay him to trade him &amp; they sat on it &amp; tried to force him to play out the year.    I don‚Äôt like how Minny fans have sold this image of villain Butler when they traded for a max player, refused to pay him market value then bristled when he wanted out to a team that would.   Why would any player risk getting injured/losing the bag for the Wolves? Everyone clowned Schroeder/IT but the same could have happened to Jimmy had he gotten hurt that season. It was 1000% the Wolves fault."
This has Minny Jimmy Butler vibes.
A year before that with the Jimmy Butler saga.
"Ben Simmons.   Don't overreact to Doc Rivers destroying his value, just like Doc did to Paul George.   Simmons would be incredible next to a knockdown scorer like LaVine. He's never played with an offensive weapon like that, the closest was Jimmy Butler and even that worked out pretty well."
"They didn't have the cap space for Jimmy Butler, what makes you think LeBron could have signed there? He wouldn't take less to go to the Lakers either."
I see Rajon Rondo on ESPN at some point as a regular hot take guy. Bro is a brash asshole.  Same with Jimmy Butler.
"IDK I think it's pretty obvious when a team's third best player is Jimmy Butler or Joel Embiid, they're surefire contenders and probably favorites for the title if the KD warriors weren't around. If KD still gets injured, they're favorites over them. What's crazy is no team was willing to take a serious risk on Kawhi. Like I don't think there was even any buzz from the blazers about them giving up McCollum for him."
"Idk man, that SOUNDS reasonable at first glance, but Jimmy is competitive. Most NBA players are. If your coach tells you that there's a better chance at winning even if you're not comfortable, usually guys like Jimmy take up that change 100% and try their best   Idk the story, though...if this is how it went, that's a suspect decision by Jimmy ""You fuckin need me"" Butler"
"f#@king nerves of some people, telling grown man what to do.  if its bothersome tell jimmy to f#@k off, otherwise shut up and do agent sh#t,.... yes sir, no sir, Mr butler."
It already happened when they didn't want to pay Jimmy Butler over the other players on the team.
"Maybe?  &gt;Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt interested in getting hit with a tampering charge. Butler found himself in a dangerous situation after he liked an Instagram post about James Harden wanting to join the Heat, but Butler was able to talk his way out of it.   https://www.yahoo.com/now/jimmy-butler-explains-why-he-liked-post-about-james-harden-joining-heat-i-just-want-the-guy-to-be-happy-184458794.html"
"Jimmy Butler has ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money  Basically he can tell Pat Riley to go fuck himself and it‚Äôs not going to make a difference, he‚Äôs still going to make hundreds of millions of dollars"
&gt; Jimmy used to be so quiet earlier on in his career didnt say a word lol   It was a huge deal that Butler called himself the team leader in Chicago when Rose and Noah were both there. Kind of a dumb take to say he didn't say a word early in his career.
"Trae young, capela, John Collins, Brogdan, jimmy butler, bam, holiday, pascal, Hayward, Lowry, kemba  Literally all those guys would be better players. You must be mental to think he had a real chance if not for other factors."
"I think they are about even, but Kyle Lowry theoretically does fix a lot of problems for Miami. They get a very good guard defender giving them a great switchable defensive guard/wing/big combo in Lowry, Butler, Bam. He can be an off-ball shooter with Butler playmaking or be the lead playmaker and scorer for the team.   Miami had the same winning percentage as Milwaukee last year when Jimmy Butler played. They also added PJ Tucker and if Tyler Herro looks a bit more like his rookie year self, this team is very well constructed."
"When Jimmy came in the league all anyone would talk about from Bulls broadcasters to the coaching staff was his insane work ethic and how he rose to every occasion the older guys on the team (Gibson, Rose, Deng, Joakim) brought to him on an effort level.  He said on the Reddick podcast that when he came into the league he was surrounded with those guys and those Bulls teams in general were super hard-nosed and just grinders and he had to step up to their level when playing. That team with Rose got a 1 seed in the East by out working everyone, not through talent (yes I know Butler wasn‚Äôt on that roster, just using it for context)."
Malcolm Brogdon  Jimmy Butler  Mikal Bridges  LeBron James  Myles Turner  6th man Eric Gordon
"&gt; With that being said, it‚Äôs hard to see the Sixers making a trade that will make them significantly better than they were.  At this point, the goal isn't to be better than they were. The goal is to  be better than they would be if they keep Simmons and he either sits out the year or intentionally plays shitty (ala Harden or Jimmy Butler)"
"Apparently, I‚Äôm Jimmy Butler now. ü§£"
Is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqOtqz8bSDk) the one you mean for Jimmy Butler?
"Dreymond, CP3, Jimmy Butler, Steven Adams, Collin Sexton"
"Only problem is if the team doesn‚Äôt like the trade offers they‚Äôre getting. The team may want to hold out longer, but the player wants to be traded so you can end up with a Jimmy Butler in Minny or Simmons on Philly situation"
"Embiid could realistically win MVP next season, I really think you'r being a tad dramatic unless you think his career and peak is over. NBA teams change consistently, we'll probably only have 3 or 4 guys still here in 2 years time. We could always package Maxey + Matisse for an actually good player. Tobias becomes easier and easier to trade after this season. Winning a championship is never likely, but ""it ended when Jimmy Butler left""? Come on lol. As a Raptors fan you should know about how quickly the league changes"
bro that fucking game without jimmy butler.... rose put up the best worst stateline nearly double double w turnovers if i remember. we couldnt buy a bucket yet pushed the game so far and won with some miraculous 3 from kirk.
"They had championship aspiration 3 years ago. Them choosing Brett brown and Ben Simmons over jimmy butler sunk them. If they had listened to butler and dropped brown who was a terrible coach, then traded Simmons at the height of his value they‚Äôre likely sitting on butler/embiid/third star and likely go to the finals in 2020 and last year"
"Jimmy Butler is a much better basketball player than Simmons. To think, you chose Simmons over Butler. Lol."
"this is going to be another Jimmy Butler in Minnesota situation, isnt it?"
Jimmy butler is still in the league tho
The bubble was actually some of the best basketball I have ever watched. Jokic and Murry underdogging two rounds of the playoffs and then Jimmy Butler playing like an insane person in the finals. I really enjoyed the narratives the bubble created that might not have been possible.
"Here's my opinion:  2021: Suns win 4-1(Giannis was too good this Finals)  2020: Heat win 4-3(Jimmy Butler was great, but you know he's no LeBron)  2019: Raptors win 4-2(I don't see much changing here)  2018: Warriors win 4-0(Again not much changing here, except that game 1 isn't as close)  2017: Warriors win 4-1(Game 4 was basically refball so the Cavs still win that game, but not much else)  2016: Warriors win 4-2(I think this is obvious)  2015: Warriors win 4-2(not much changes again)  2014: Spurs win 4-0(LeBron was still good this series but his teammates were horrid, put any Spur in that situation and they lose by 30 every game)  2013: Spurs win 4-1(Still no player who is close to LeBron in this Finals)  2012: Heat win 4-2(KD was notably a worse all around player back then, but at the same time he wasn't why the Thunder lost and LeBron wasn't close to the only reason the Heat won)  2011: Heat win 4-1(Mavs don't win much with 2011 Finals LeBron)"
"We don't even have to go back that far..  Jimmy Butler with the practice rants and Nichols interview, and Harden with the being out of shape, going to strip clubs during the pandemic, being very low effort on the court - plenty of ways to be a locker room cyst other than just not playing like this comment thread has been arguing.  Not to mention the Kawhi situation where Ben can just claim that his knee doesn't feel right despite what team doctors say, and no one can know how someone else's body truly feels except the people themselves. Kawhi situation was different since he had his own doctors on his side but some people claimed that Kawhi was pulling that type of stunt."
Do you have any proof of this??? because i don't remember people thinking this. Mostly I just saw people say the Twolves won the trade because they got an in prime jimmy butler for a player who is injured. I don't remember people exactly trashing Lavine.
How dare jimmy butler not beat AD/Lebron with Kelly Olynyk and Solomon Hill. What a fucking scrub
"Jimmy Butler is a great player, but he can‚Äôt be your best player to win a championship. He gave 110% in the 2020 NBA Finals, and had nothing left by game 6.  This is why I don‚Äôt think Miami will win unless Bam reaches another level."
"On ball defense first and foremost. The 3 point shot kills us. I always think, if you add Jimmy Butler to the Jazz that‚Äôs an instant title favorite"
"Jimmy Butler was homeless after his mother kicked him out at the age of 13. It is amazing that he survived, let alone play in the NBA.  Carmelo Anthony grew up in the projects in Brooklyn with a single mother and had a rough upbringing.  DeMar Derozan grew up in Compton and definitely saw/went through some wild shit."
"rebounds, great passing, great defense, plays with Jimmy Butler? lol"
&gt; Yeah that's kinda the point. Once Paul got injured you guys didn't even look competitive.   15 point leads at half of both games against the best team ever? With eric gordon as your best teammate?  &gt;  If you'd given Giannis a top 5/6 point guard of all time in 2019 he would have won a ring  At this point you‚Äôre clearly trolling but I got time. That was Paul‚Äôs worst season of his career. Giannis had middleton who made an allstar game and all nba team while Paul didn‚Äôt. 2019 giannis had way more help then 2019 yet he got swept by Jimmy Butler. Foh
"For the Knicks, it will be that an opposing team will figure out a defensive scheme to stop both Julius Randle and Kemba Walker, and they won't be able to offensively overcome it. Also, RJ Barrett will be solid player this coming season, but still not an all-star level player the caliber of Paul George or Jimmy Butler, which is what the Knicks need him to be to REALLY get over the hump.     I legit hope I'm wrong in all of this, and that the Knicks do in fact have what it takes to win a championship."
"Jimmy Butler, the player you're thinking of is Jimmy Butler. He gets added to the Heat and they make the finals, before he got there Dragic got the Heat to the playoffs 2 out of 5 seasons and only made it out of the first round once. If that's worth having a jersey retired then D. Wade deserves a solid gold statue."
Jimmy Butler 2020 Finals game 5
Jimmy Butler‚Äôs game 5 in the finals was just insane given the stakes and all the injuries. The heat had an amazing record that season when butler would take less than 10 shots. So seeing him take over was just incredible
"PG isn‚Äôt a superstar, he‚Äôs an All-Star. Do you think Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum and every other top 15-20 player is a superstar?"
PG: Jrue Holiday  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Myles Turner
Bron couldn‚Äôt handle Jimmy Butler lmao
Yeah like this one. Others ive had over the yrs.   Ben Simmons-JaDeveon Clowney  Blake Griffin--Tony Romo  Chris Paul--Phillip Rivers  Lamar Jackson--Allen Iverson  Ja Morant--Kyler Murray  Jimmy Butler--Richard Sherman  Draymond Green--Donta Hightower  Kevin Garnett--Ed Reed  Rob Gronkowski--Shaq  Kyle Lowry--Steve Smith  Dirk Nowitzki--Antonio Gates
"Jimmy Butler - tough, hate/love player who finally gets to the Championship but falls short to the league favorite in new colors (Lebron) like Cam w/ Peyton."
Okoro continues his March to Jimmy Butler 2.0
Jimmy butler moves up to a top 5 player tbh
"This. And is one of the reasons why I hate Jimmy Butler. I understand trash talk and all that, but to call KAT soft after all this is just awful."
"&gt; 3) ‚Äú You don‚Äôt know who is important to you until you actually lose them.‚Äù   -Every team that Jimmy Butler has left  lol, no."
"Funny thing is, there is no hard cut definition of superstar. The word superstar is so arbitrary that even PG and Jimmy Butler to name a few have been named superstars ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Disagree a fair bit with the last stretch of ur list.   1. KD 2. Giannis 3. Steph 4. Bron 5. Kawhi 6. Harden  7. Jokic 8. Embiid 9. Luka 10. Dame 11. AD 12. PG 13. Kyrie  14. Trae 15. Tatum  16. Jimmy Butler 17. Chris Paul 18. Donavan Mitchell  19. KAT  20. Zion  21. Bam 22. Booker  23. Lavine 24. Beal 25. Gobert  26. Shai 27. Middleton 28. Russ  29. Jaylen Brown 30. De‚Äôaaron Fox
"Joining the league in 1990 the Minnesota Timberwolves drafted all time great Kevin Garnett in 1996 and proceeded to have this legend of the sport for his best years until 2007 at which they were able to draft Kevin Love in the 2008 NBA draft who proceeded to give his best All NBA years to the Timberwolves up until 2014 at which point they traded him for the #1 pick in the 2014 draft, Andrew Wiggins as well as selecting future All Star Zach LaVine in the same draft. In the next year Minnesota would proceed to solidify their young core taking the greatest shooting big man of all time Karl Anthony Towns at #1 in the 2015 draft to add to their young core. To provide leadership to this team Minnesota brought on former coach of the year Tom Thibodeau and then traded Zach LaVine for perennial 2 way All Star Jimmy Butler. As the Butler situation soured in early 2019 Minnesota still had their young superstar center and had traded Andrew Wiggins for the young Brooklyn All Star DAngelo Russell. Immediately that 2020 draft Minnesota had the option to draft LaMelo Ball but opted for the young stud Anthony Edwards to create a new star studded young core.   Minnesota Timberwolves all time record: .394 win rate and 9 playoff appearances in 31 seasons."
"Focusing on weaknesses and working on things you‚Äôll never use in a game are different things.   Jimmy Butler definitely spent zero practice time drilling on full court around the back passes, or say, 10 foot scoop shots, for example."
"He guarded Jimmy the entire series.  Giannis guarded Butler more than any other Bucks player and held him to 9 points on 25% shooting with 4 turnovers.  [https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612749/matchups/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=OFF\_PLAYER\_NAME&amp;dir=1&amp;PORound=1](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612749/matchups/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=OFF_PLAYER_NAME&amp;dir=1&amp;PORound=1)  And he didn't guard KD because Giannis isn't great at getting through screens and it would have worn him out, ultimately affecting his offense which was pivotal since Khris and Jrue were extremely inconsistent on that end of the floor. On the possessions Giannis did guard KD, he shut him down as well as anyone possibly could.

On the contrary a lot of greats became that by expanding their games in ways people told them they couldn't. Jimmy Butler doesn't become the player he is now if he doesn't work on his play making and scoring but I bet you when he was riding the end of the bench some assistant coach was advising him not to work on that and just focus on improving his rebounding and defense
Who called him out? Jimmy Butler?   I'm supposed to believe that guy over KG or anyone else who has praised KAT. Besides look at KAT's numbers in 19/20 before he got injured and they blow Lavine out of the water.  And the guy who has made 2 all star teams and all NBA isn't dedicated to getting better? I like Lavine because he's a former Wolf but there is a reason he was traded away and not KAT lol.
Damn a hawks fan saying this. I wouldn't say Jimmy is better EASILY. I think Trae would be the better pick IF you have a good defensive team that can hide him on defense. He just brings so much to the offense it's hard to say Butler is easily better
Jimmy Butler took y‚Äôall to 6 games basically by himself lol why‚Äôs it crazy to think adding Bam and Dragic they could have won?
They kept bargain shopping for player no other teams were particularly high on.  They never made their Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler trade(Bulls-Wolves trade) where they had to give up actual value for someone that could raise their ceiling.
Jimmy Butler for peak LeBron James? Sign me up twice
Jimmy Butler for arguably the greatest basketball player of all time? Yes please.
"Lighten up Francis, it was a bit of hyperbole. More like top 10 in current player, as good or better than PG or Jimmy Butler. But they DO call him Maple Jordan, lol."
Better than AD. Around the same as KG Imagine AD with jimmy butler toughness
"Jimmy Butler too. 6'7"", 220 guard/forward who excels at pretty much everything but isn't amazing at one thing (at least on offense. Elite as a perimeter defender but so is PG). Can take over a game occasionally. Main stats are also just average af at first glance. Only thing is the man is the opposite of default off the court"
"Dame Lillard. No surprise that he got good because it was always clear that he could ball and played with confidence but I had no idea he‚Äôd have this level of range.   Similarly for Steph. Always knew he had unlimited range but thought he was an undersized 2 at Davidson. Didn‚Äôt expect him to be a legit pg with handles and vision.   Finally, I thought jimmy butler would be closer to Tony Allen during his early Chicago days but he developed an elite mid range game along with his lock down d."
Jimmy Butler for Prime D Wade?  I'm down for it.
Hell yeah. Dwade is a smaller version of Jimmy Butler with way more scoring threat
If simmons had the fuckin balls of Jimmy butler he wouldn't be in this situation to begin with cause he wouldn't be passing out of open shots and layups
"I guess I just don't see Ben Simmons entering the Jimmy Butler zone, two very different guys. I don't see things getting significantly worse."
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs actually entered that zone yet. In my mind right now he‚Äôs damaged and just wants out.   But he hasn‚Äôt entered this Jimmy Butler zone where he wants out and he‚Äôs going to be an issue about it. When he does which forcing him to show up would probably do if he does become an issue then it‚Äôs like okay you‚Äôre a locker room problem, you‚Äôre bad and to get your way your going to cause problems.   At least right now it‚Äôs like the agent being the dick head about it and if push comes to shove he‚Äôs holding out which is better than becoming an actual cancer to get removed."
"Jimmy Butler had to do this during the NBA Finals and he completely crapped out by game 6, scoring 13 points and getting blown out by 30+, because he was too tired to play that hard game after game."
"&gt; Just a joke since if he pulled something like this they would obviously bench him.  I don't think it's a joke, I think this is exactly the kind of thing we'll see from Simmons. This is what eventually got the Raptors to trade Vince Carter, what got the Wolves to trade Jimmy Butler, and the Rockets to trade James Harden. If Simmons just sandbags it this year then it kills Philly's ""we'll just keep you"" stance. If it becomes a question of whether they'd rather have a guy who's actively hurting them or whom they just don't play, or some lesser players who will actually help them, I'm guessing they'll opt for the latter.   While it's fun for fans to think about what it would be like for the Sixers to do whatever is necessary to punish Ben Simmons, the truth is they can't just throw a season (or multiple seasons) away simply to make a point or to be petty with Ben Simmons. He'll get paid either way, it just becomes a question of how much Philly can take before they have to give in. You'd imagine that even if Daryl Morey has the stomach for that, I don't know how on board Embiid will be with just throwing away parts of his prime so they can feud with Ben Simmons."
He should just show up and pull a Jimmy Butler.
&gt; The last FA star any Philly team attracted was Bryce Harper   Didn't they signed Jimmy Butler as a Free agent a couple years ago?
Jimmy Butler.
"lol, so naive. Just look at what happened with the wolves and butler when thibs thought he could make it work and refused to trade jimmy when he wanted out. You're talking out of your ass while I have legit examples that happened recently. But hey, you keep dreaming up these silly little takes. I'll be back here to rub it in your face when it all blows up."
Sixers vs Celtics: Ben Simmons loses ball handling duties to TJ McConnell. Sixers lose.  Sixers vs Raptors: Ben Simmons loses ball handling duties to Jimmy Butler. Sixers lose.  Sixers vs Hawks: Ben Simmons retains ball handling duties and fails spectacularly. Sixers lose.  Simmons has shit the bed in every playoffs series he was eliminated in.
"I'd love to hear what you think Wolves fans think ""about Jimmy Butler and KAT""."
"Not really, they still delude themselves about Jimmy Butler and KAT"
Aw man this couldn‚Äôt have happened to a better franchise (puts on jimmy butler jersey)
I bet someone like Jimmy Butler would really change the defensive culture in Minnesota
"This is just pivoting from plan A to plan B and it's not something unheard of. ""We will not trade player X"", one month later he is traded.  And honestly both sides shouldn't have dragged this too much. Simmons already tarnished his reputation on-court and now off-court with this bullshit. Besides his contractual obligations and since he can't pull a ""Jimmy Butler"", if he wants to be traded he just gotta show up and play to increase his trade value to an acceptable point for anyone.  Sixers gotta realize they cannot get a haul for Simmons as well. Their biggest fear is obviously to alienate Embiid but they gotta move on. Offseason is basically over and this team needs as much as preparation to be a legit contender, even that may not be sufficient."
"Jimmy Butler, DeAndre Ayton, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Antawn Jamison"
Yeah I shit on Jimmy Butler not Precious Achiuwa or Bam. How do you not get what I'm saying?
We shit on Jimmy Butler not Miami Heat specifically.
"Why are you pretending like your hate for Jimmy Butler hasn‚Äôt in turn caused you to shit on the heat?  We don‚Äôt hate you, we laugh at how much you hate us"
How is fuck Jimmy Butler related to the Miami Heat? You keep ignoring what he did to the Timberwolves and that he continues to badmouth us to this day so of course we aren't going to like him.  You hate us because Jimmy doesn't like us and again that's sad.
Uh. Are you really gonna tell me you haven‚Äôt gone into a heat thread on this subreddit unprompted to shit on us. Don‚Äôt make me expose you right now  &gt;stay frosty fam  You keep embarrassing yourself  You have a post titled ‚Äúfuck Jimmy Butler‚Äù at 600 upvotes in your subreddit. Yeah this discussions overüíÄ
None. The ratio of your Jimmy Butler posts that got upvoted to oblivion to our like two timberwolves posts shows how one sided this ‚Äúbeef‚Äù is  It‚Äôs an encyclopedia of Jimmy Butler in your sub bro good god
"You literally replied in less than a minute‚Ä¶ my ass lmao. I wonder how many posts I‚Äôll find in the twolves subreddit if I search Jimmy Butler, mind doing that for me?  Edit: holy shit I did not know you guys talked about him that much"
Jokic outside of his passing   Donovan Mitchell   Jimmy Butler
The fact that you brought in Jimmy Butler outta nowhere kinda showcases how rent free he is in your head. Get over it lol I‚Äôm sure KAT already has
Paul George or Jimmy Butler
"Rudy Gobert, Bam, Jimmy Butler"
"I don't think Simmons will just sit out entirely, but only because it will be far more effective for him to show up and just play lazy, uninspired basketball to make Philly simply want to get rid of him as soon as possible. I'm sure he'll just do the same things Jimmy Butler did in Minnesota and James Harden did last year in Houston. It's possible the main motivating factor in trading him may be Embiid going to Morey and just telling him enough is enough and that he needs to go. It will be interesting to see how it goes, but I imagine it'll end with Simmons traded in December, and probably for a less than exciting trade package."
Jimmy Butler
"&gt;One has happened significantly more often than the other.  You're right about this, but I think it proves a point you're trying to fight against. There's been a number of high profile players who have asked for trades (Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden), but it's hard to find any that just showed up and played hard for their team after doing that. Some were traded before it got to that point, and in the rest it became a mess.   About the only example I can think of when someone made a trade demand and still showed up and played hard and it wasn't a mess was when Kobe Bryant did it in 2007. But IMO that's an anomaly because he had a No Trade Clause, so it led to a stalemate between he and the Lakers, where he realized any trade package the Lakers would get for him would make his new team weak enough that he'd no longer want to go play there anymore. As a result he just stayed (and then the Lakers ended up being much better than he'd expected).   I think it's far more likely that this Simmons thing gets messier and the Sixers eventually give up and just trade him for whatever they can. If you're expecting Ben Simmons to show up and play great for you guys to rehab his value, I think you'll end up disappointed."
"&gt; they feel like they have nothing to lose.   I guarantee you that Philly does not feel like they have nothing to lose where they can afford to just piss away the next couple years playing ""who can be more petty"" with one of their star players. Do you think Embiid would be on board with them screwing around during his prime like that? Philly has a lot to lose. They need to resolve this situation quickly before it becomes even more of a mess for them, and simply getting Ben Simmons in line is not their goal. They want to trade him and hopefully for pieces good enough to keep them in title contention.   We've seen other teams try to fight these battles of wills with disgruntled stars before and the teams always lose. Vince Carter, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Anthony Davis, James Harden, etc. In the end the teams have more to lose and always give in. No team can stomach a disgruntled star player for very long, [no matter what they might say in the press.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30338326/sources-houston-rockets-willing-get-uncomfortable-james-harden-russell-westbrook?platform=amp)"
"&gt; There are no consequences worse than trading Simmons for a bad return. That's just voluntarily dumping any chance of building a Championship roster.  One, ""bad"" is relative, and Simmons value is there for a reason.  Two, yes there are. You sound like a wallstreet bets guy lmao.  ""IF I NEVER SOLD THE MONEY ISN'T GONE"".  Well the money is gone.  He's not recovering his value, and all he's goign to do on the sixers is poison the well on his way out.  You want a worse scenario than a trade?  THe sixers players and front office spend a year getting asked about Simmons while Simmons says he doesn't want to be there and you  manage to piss off the whole damn team while also wasting a year of Embiid(and pissing off the most important guy in your franchise) and Simmons value dropping the whole way.   &gt; Except there's 0 instance of that actually happening. Even the Harden example that people love bringing up, he was still a massive net positive for the team, he just wasn't the clear-cut best offensive player in the league like he usually is.  Lmao excuse me?  That's just hilariously wrong.  Vince Carter? Jimmy Butler? James Harden?  I'm not talking about throwing games.  I'm talking about living with your 2nd best player openly not wanting to be there. You think the Timberwolves was a happy place while Butler was still on the team?   &gt; He'll get traded as soon as Morey gets an offer he thinks keeps the 6ers on a Championship track.  A trade for Ben Simmons that puts them on a championship track doesn't exist, and it's not going to suddenly materialize."
"&gt; Simmons won't play again for the Sixers;  This is not a fact. Threatening to not show up to training camp and actively sitting out while getting fined are two very different things with a lot of steps in the middle. Most players show up to camp, and just play poorly until traded very rarely do they actually not play.  &gt;The longer he stays in his holdout thing, the more distractions the locker room will have and it will be less likely to see good results.  The drama in Philly will be there regardless. If we trade him for Malik Beasley and we're the 7th seed after 20 games that'll cause drama and questions too. I hear the issues with the locker room but players talk, they know the situation already I don't think we're walking into an unknown. Ben just isn't the type to have a Jimmy Butler in Minn type of outburst, he'd fake an injury before doing that IMO.  To address the rest of the comment, I have a hard time seeing how the average fan is better at predicting this stuff than a GM of 15+ years. His job is to help the sixers win a championship, and when you step back from the cliff of all these what ifs, you've got a player you need to trade right after a terrible series. He's going to ask for a lot when the guy could win DPOY next season, but this is Daryl Morey. He asks for crazy trades all the time, it's literally his negotiating tactic and it's worked many times in the past. I don't think we'll even get a CJ level player, but there's a chance with more waiting that we might. Right now everyone is saying to bite the bullet on deals that actively make us worse where we can't even get a starter level player in return for someone who is hugely important to the team like it or not.  This is not worse than the Dwightmare, this isn't worse than the Harden/Vince Carter situation. Ben has no leverage. Nobody wants him, and we've been trying for months to trade him. He's got 4 years left on his deal and I understand the risk we're walking into but nobody seems to realize how bad it would be to take these bad deals now, when in all likelihood Malik Beasley is available for Ben Simmons at the deadline."
Add Jimmy Butler and Julius Randle too.
Jimmy Butler had a 7.5 BPM and .255 WS/48 in 20-21. That‚Äôs MVP level production.   He averaged 26-10-8 in the NBA finals on 55-31-89 in 19-20.  If anything he‚Äôs underrated because of his 4 really bad playoff games in 21.
"LMAO no he wasn't.   His best season was 2016, where he was All NBA 3rd team. Lowry in '16 was not better than: LeBron, Steph, Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Kawhi, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeMarcus Cousins or Anthony Davis, that's 10 right there and then you have guys like Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, LaMarcus Aldridge are all IMO better and then guys like Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Millsap, Marc Gasol, Karl Anthony Towns, Gordon Hayward were debatedly better.   Lowry at his peak was a top 20 player for sure, but top 10 is a huge stretch. ESPN had him at #18 following his 2016 All NBA season, Sport's Illustrated had him at #34, Washington Post at #14, Fadeaway World had him outside their top 20, CBS at #17. Lowry was never a consensus top 10 guy."
That you Jimmy Butler?   Wade already told you once.
"I've never seen Ben play without effort. I've seen him play badly, and at the end of the Hawks game I saw him play scared, but never without effort.   Unpopular opinion: I don't consider Ben a bad person because he has fallen short on the court. I don't think he wants to fail. But if he were to play without effort then I would no longer respect him as a person. And no, currently he has done absolutely nothing to make me not respect him as a person.   Ignoring how I would feel personally though, no one has sandbagged since 2004 and I don't think Ben hates the Sixers more than anyone has hated their team since then. I know people want drama, but it's more likely he just skips camp, takes the fines, then shows up for games and plays at his level until he is traded. I know people want him to go full Game of Zone Jimmy Butler on the team but that's just not his personality.   Is it a bad relationship that might be unfixable? Yes. Is it the worst player/team relationship since *2004?* Hardly."
Because Jimmy Butler has beef with KAT and the Wolves and these fools have no personality and copy what their favourite basketball player does. Quite sad if you ask me.
"Jimmy Butler. He runs hot and cold, we all saw it last year."
"it ain‚Äôt us. look at u/zmajxd profile. i see this fool under every single heat/jimmy butler related post shitting on us. most wolves fans can‚Äôt accept that jimmy was the best thing to ever happen to them, and they chose wiggins over him üò≠üò≠üíÄ"
"I don't like Jimmy Butler that much, but if he was somehow able to pull out a championship in the bubble just by brutal force and effort, he would then always be a reference point for a team ""having a puncher's chance"" at a championship. At the start of every playoffs, you'd be reminded how he willed the 2020 Heat to a championship and discuss who could be the next  team to do it. He would be an inspiration to all of the lower seeded teams each year."
I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen this one yet on here.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stupid locked in for playoffs‚Äù before getting swept by the bucks - Jimmy Butler.
How tf do you take Jimmy Butler over Kyrie Irving lol.
It can never be stressed enough that Bryn Forbes outscored Jimmy Butler in a playoff series
...and Blake...and Jimmy Butler.
"Dunk machines like Blake age poorly, as do players who miss a lot of time, so I don't think they are crazy for having BG in the mid-teens.  Blake went on to sit the majority of games over the next six seasons, the time frame projected here.  Embiid hadn't played an NBA game.  Giannis was coming off a rookie season where he averaged 7/4.  Payton was young and this is the type of shit that happens when you rely entirely on data, as this list did.  They admit that this may be a huge overranking, adding  &gt; So we have bona fide stars like Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin ‚Ä¶ and then we have Elfrid Payton?!? Is this CARMELO‚Äôs version of PECOTA‚Äôs infamous Wily Mo Pena projection? Time will tell, but Payton logged almost 2,500 minutes as a 20-year-old rookie last year while flashing excellent passing and defensive skills.   I'm just glad they provide us with some public player projection data, while I have to admit it's far from perfect it's the only gig in town so take it or leave it."
"That doesn‚Äôt really change what I‚Äôm saying, IN the past 20 years the Kings have made it out of the first round 3 more times than the wolves, and they haven‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2006.   The only reason the wolves have made it into the playoffs once since 2004 is because of Jimmy Butler.  LMAOOO"
"I understand why people would take Jimmy Butler over Bryn Forbes; the playmaking is real, the rebounding is great and he's an awesome leader. But at the end of the day Bryn Forbes is simply the better two-way player."
"Bryn ""defensive stalwart and outscorer of Jimmy Butler"" Forbes"
"They had had Reddick as a shooter, plus an alpha in Jimmy Butler.   The point is, Morey is a well known GM, but he didn't turn around a situation in Philly."
"Jimmy Butler, I don‚Äôt wanna be a delusional heat fan but, he was in the conversation this season at one point before the injuries and covid and because the heat had a real bad losing streak without him and when he returned they went on a good winning streak.  He almost averaged a 20 point triple double and was the steaks leader this season. Coming into next season, I believe he‚Äôs gonna be hungrier than before, he‚Äôs also working on his 3 and with the addition of Lowry, he doesn‚Äôt have to be the teams primary playmaker and he focus more on getting buckets, real dark horse MVP prediction, but we‚Äôll see"

I mean it went 4-2 with Jimmy Butler and his 2 other best players on the Heat being injured so it's not hard to see why.
"Whew, some passionate Jimmy Butler fans here. I respect your take but I also have my own opinion."
1. Jimmy Butler  2. Wade 3. Kobe  4. Giannis  5. Curry
"Bucks fans are the only one still doing to this day on every thread they can. Along with some really salty Minnesota fans who can't move on. Your team deserves your attention, not Jimmy Butler."
"I thought this game was super impressive. But then it made me realize how impressive LeBron's conditioning truly is. Jimmy is not a slacker. In any way. I don't think you've ever heard that about him. Yet one game of him doing this, and he can barely get up off the floor, and in the next game he was toast. LeBron was putting in these performances for an entire series all playoffs long. Also year after year. He can't to that extent now probably because old. But Butler is only 32."
Better scorer and more fun to watch than Jimmy Butler.
Paul george vs jimmy butler was a genuine discussion
He looks like the white Jimmy Butler
"One thing that always gets me is when people bring up Butler's FTs. But Butler gets a lot of his freethrows from driving to the paint. He's not always necessarily looking to finish, but he is getting hacked a lot. Here he is 46 minutes of game time, taking it right to Kieff, who's on of the toughest players in the league, and DPOY runner up AD. A lot of players would settle for the jumper. Jimmy is built different."

"&gt;I do believe the Blazers had plenty of opportunities to trade away some pieces, mainly CJ and/or Nurk, to have a better chance to win. This kind of speaks to my point of the not really trying. They‚Äôve been sending out this same core for the past 6 years and they have not changed much as a team. They‚Äôve had the same problem for a while and everyone knew their weaknesses which was wing depth and terrible guard defense.   Like what? They tried trading for Paul George and it didn‚Äôt go through, and they couldn‚Äôt compete for harden last year. Also they tried trading for jimmy butler on 2018 but that didn‚Äôt work out either. What other Star players have been traded in the last few years? Chris Paul or Jute holiday, we‚Äôll that‚Äôs just puts us in the same position as before. There really haven‚Äôt been that many moves the we could have made to get us to contention without drafting well."
Jimmy Butler and Paul George
"Pacers x Heat if Indy can overcome injuries and stay competitive. Not sure if Vic will really return this year, but the possibility of us meeting again in the playoffs again gives me chills.   And before Heat fans jump down my throat saying they‚Äôre too good for us, I‚Äôm just speaking from our perspective after the ‚Äò13 Paul George ECF, the ‚Äò19 Vic debacle and weird Jimmy Butler vs TJ Warren semi-rivalry."
I think you mean Jimmy Butler defeats the Lakers.
"""The Duel""  The only game in NBA Finals history that had two players (Jimmy Butler and LeBron James) to post a Top 10 Finals Game Score in the same game."
Jimmy Butler &gt; James Harden
"Too many things happened in between his departure and the current situation to really say.  It was clear from the begining Embiid and Simmons weren't a natural fit, which split fans. Some saying that they eventually could make it work. I think Hinkie would have tried to make it work. Who knows if it ever would.  I really think the process is a great what-if and I wish people would be more down to talk about it in a nuanced way because there's a lot of interesting stuff to think about in my opinion.  Even people who were down with the process split at a certain point. There were a number of moves after Hinkie left that were still in the spirit of the process. Getting Jimmy Butler was one of those moves. Draft a core and then use the remaining assets to add a third bonafide star.  Embiid didn't even nickname himself The Process until AFTER Hinkie was fired. It was basically a fuck you to the front office for giving up on it, and why process sixer fans will give their life to protect Embiid.  I'm rambling now. The whole thing is fucked. They killed my sweet boy."
Jimmy butler
"&gt;Philly gave up Jimmy Butler of all people to keep Simmons.     That was their mistake. Philly kept Simmons on account of being more naturally gifted so they expected that if he develops a jumper, he'll be the better player. But unless Simmons explicitly promised to do that before singing the contract which seems improbable given his constant public insistence on not shooting, he isn't at fault for accepting the money.   Granted it would be ridiculous to do so but for the team to be built around Simmons would have to start with trading the superstar for players that fit around him like Orlando Dwight or Giannis. And he's being whiny about it. No excuse for that. Saying that two top 10 players of all time did better doesn't really do anything other than point out how mistaken everyone is in judging his abilities."
Paul George  &gt;  Jimmy Butler
"well good news  KAT hates Embiid, KAT hates Jokic, KAT hates Gobert (though I think that one's less intense and one sided), KAT hates Jimmy Butler ..... I don't think KAT is on particularly good terms with Cousins"
It does if you want them to trade you. Jimmy Butler went with the ‚Äúbe a complete asshole to everyone startegy‚Äù. Simmons is probably better.
With these third-stringers Jimmy Butler could build a dynasty.
"Yes, in the way of it didn‚Äôt yield a championship team, but no, in that it still got Embiid, and the goal of The Process was to obtain a true superstar through the draft. The Process still resulted in a team with Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Tobias Harris, and then management fucked that up."
"Philly gets hurt for the season but Ben is hurting his career. After this stunt more GMs and owners will be turned off to this guy. Why even give him a max contract or any large guaranteed cash if you know he'll go scorched earth on ya?   He is a good player but his attitude and what he does definitely makes him over rated. And despite all the drama someone like say Jimmy Butler brings to a team, at least you get both production and someone who wants to suit up.   Emptying his home and burning every bridge...yeah 6ers gonna hurt a season or 2 but its better to get rid of the cancer sooner than later.   I just call it as i do: if we're gonna have drama over players, they'd better be well worth it and Ben isnt worth the hassle at the stage."
Some irony here. LeBron in his youth wasn't on a team that was the best situation for him but he got his team buckets regardless. He didn't disappear in the playoffs or demand a trade he left when his contract was up. Kobe didn't leave he just made his team better. Any good player doesn't need the team to cater to them the way Philly has tried to cater to Simmons. That line straight up makes no sense to me. It's like if Rondo demanded a trade from Boston after having a team that's literally catered to him. Philly gave up Jimmy Butler of all people to keep Simmons.
We get it buddy you hate jimmy butler no one gives a fuck.
"The same people have been pushing the Patriots to fire Belichick for like 10+ years. There's literally no possible way to make them happy.  the worst part is how many fans agree with them. Boston fans legitimately feel like they've been victimized in every sport for the last 20+ years. Pats fans think that the 6 superbowl wins are a consolation because they deserved 10+. Celtics fans wanted the team to trade all their assets for every single player who's become available over the years. They tried starting a petition to fire Ainge because he didn't trade Jayson + Jaylen for Jimmy fucking Butler.   Worst media in all of sports, but only because Boston fans are the worst fans on earth. Most entitled, ungrateful assholes you will ever have the misfortune of interacting with."
"His defensive schemes were solid, his player development was pretty good, the only person who had a big problem with him was Jimmy Butler, who was well known for being difficult to get along with, and you're making shit up about the team criticizing him, that'd be stupid even if they did feel that way."
I feel like meeting Jimmy Butler would be a memorable experience lol.
"Jimmy ""James Hoffman"" Butler"
I love Jimmy Butler.
Jimmy Butler and Pogba are tight
"‚ÄúF√∫tbol is king over there, so they had no idea who I was.‚Äù  Funny enough I asked someone working at the Manchester United VIP restaurant who his favourite celebrity was who came in there and he said Jimmy Butler."
Mark Wahlberg is a huge influence on Jimmy Butler. Interesting.
Then there's Jimmy Butler
"Nah that season they were pretty comparable, we finished with 3 less wins then them plus had the jimmy butler drama too. How were we not competitive but the kings were? 3 wins is nothing, and considering they were 9 games out of the playoffs should show you how good the west was. That season clippers were the 8th seed with 48 wins. We were way closer to the kings, then the kings were to making the playoffs."
"I still say that Butler is so heavily underrated in that whole series. He was the 2nd best player in that series, no questions asked. He was 100% the best Sixer that whole playoffs, and I said from the beginning they should've kept Jimmy and traded away Simmons after that series. After I saw Simmons shrink to the 3rd (4th??) option on that team in that series, I knew he'd never live up to the hype.  In my alternative WHAT IF...? time line, if Philly decides that Butler stays, they keep Embiid, and then last year, Philly can easily put together a package to Toronto for something like Thybulle &amp; picks for the expiring Lowry, and there's a sick guard tandem to put around the big man, and a legit title contender."
**SHOCKING:** Kyle Lowry sexually harasses his teammate Jimmy Butler.
Lmao that is some shit I would expect from a narcissist 20 year old though. I highly doubt grown men in the nba would pull that shit outside of maybe Jimmy Butler
"You're out of your mind. ""Carried""? Here were AD's stats in the Finals, and just for shits and giggles, let's compare them to Dirk's stats from the 2011 Finals when Dirk won FMVP and Tim Duncan's from the 2005 Finals when he too won FMVP:  * **AD (27 years old)** - 25.0 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.3 spg, 2.0 bpg, 57.1% from the field, 42.1% from 3, 93.8% from FT  * **Dirk (32 years old)** - 26.0 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 2.0 apg, 0.7 spg, 0.7 bpg, 41.6% from the field, 36.8% from 3, 97.8% from FT   * **Duncan (28 years old)** - 20.6 ppg, 14.1 rpg, 2.1 apg, 0.4 spg, 2.1 bpg, 41.9% from the field, 0 3s attempted, 66.7% from FT line  Yeah, AD was a huge disappointment, especially after [playing defense like this on Jimmy Butler](https://youtu.be/k0tn9QRJMec?t=1m22s) üôÑ"
ESPN: Jimmy Butler shoves new All-Star teammate Kyle Lowry in heated sexual dispute following injury
"he was criticized, but then everyone got distracted by ben simmons, and since that's an ongoing saga it's still holding everyone's attention.  jimmy butler and the heat are not an ongoing saga, like they had a successful off-season and are just getting on with business."
"You critique Kawhi for having dominated no regular seasons but put Embiid over Kawhi. They both have health issues that hindered their regular season potential. Kawhi has 2 DPOY &amp; beat Embiid with Jimmy Butler to go on &amp; win the finals. That last one with his knees looking like they could give out.  Honestly think Kawhi vs Harden is very arguable, Steph might be too but if Kawhi was healthy it wouldn‚Äôt even be a question if he was top 5. The question would probably be top 3"
"Or Jimmy Butler , crowder and Bam Adebayo two all NBA defensive guys and another great defender , it's truly isn't hard at all. Why doesn't everyone just do that. And even the heat wall this year wasn't as effective"
Lol it was a joke chill. jimmy butler is on your team is it really that baffling or are you just playing dumb
"Jimmy Butler: played like dogshit but has had multiple great playoff performances in 2019 and 2020, so is still given the benefit of the doubt  Julius Randle: played like dogshit but is excused because he's seen as a rising player who is still learning the ropes when it comes to playoff basketball  Porzingis: played like dogshit, because he's a stagnating player who's never had a good playoffs, and is letting down his generational superstar teammate, gets a lot more criticism  Ben Simmons: played like dogshit, serious lack of offensive development + multiple prior playoff disappointments = gets a huge amount of criticism"
"Jimmy Butler, the way he handles himself and his resume doesnt add up and no one criticizes him about how bad he was in his Playoff Series this past season as much as it shouldve been."
"Jimmy Butler  He's had just as many fails in the playoffs as successes but has the reputation as some kind of ""ultimate winner""  This year he had literally the worst series I've ever seen a #1 option have and his reputation didn't get damaged much at all  Plus he's the most free throw reliant player in the league yet rarely gets brought up when it comes to those discussions about foul baiters"
"In no particular order:    1. Lebron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. James Harden   5. Kawhi Leonard   6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Anthony Davis   8. Nikola Jokic   9.

Draymond Green   29. Khris Middelton   30. Russel Westbrook   These are the guys I can think of that I would say have an argument over Gobert right now.  As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"I think they want to end tampering, I just don't think they can. At the end of the day they can't stop two players from talking to each other. I'm just gonna use the heat situation as an example because it's fresh in my head. The gm of the heat could call butler and tell him to try to recruit Lowry. The NBA of course isn't gonna be able to prove anything based off of a GM talking to his own player. Jimmy could then go to Lowry and be the middle man and all negotiations would go through him since the NBA doesn't want to stop players from talking to each other (for obvious reasons) and can't say there is a problem with a GM talking it his own player. Alternatively 2 players share an agent the gm could just call up the agent and to talk about player x who is not on the team. If they get questioned about it they can just say they were talking about player y who is on the team. Tampering done correctly can't be caught."
"Not just an elite offensive player, Boban has been the single best player per minute in the NBA. Boban is the per 36 god monster.  From 2015-2017 if you calculate the win shares/48 of all players that played at least 10 games the list goes like this.  &amp;#x200B;  |2015-2016|2016-2017| |:-|:-| |Boban Marjanoviƒá (.325)|Boban Marjanoviƒá (.280)| |Stephen Curry (.318)|Kevin Durant (.278)| |Kawhi Leondard (.277)|Kawhi Leonard (.264)| |Kevin Durant (.270)|Chris Paul (.264)| |Chris Paul (.253)|Rudy Gobert (.250)| |Russel Westbrook (.245)|James Harden (.245)| |Lebron James (.242)|Jimmy Butler (.236)|"
"&gt; We‚Äôre less than a year removed from him going toe to toe with Jimmy Butler in the finals.  When LeBron was the undisputed best player that would not have been a close contest. LeBron is still a top 10 player, but he has definitely lost a little of his fastball."
I don‚Äôt get the LeBron hate. He was injured last year. Give him. A chance to play healthy. We‚Äôre less than a year removed from him going toe to toe with Jimmy Butler in the finals.
What about Jimmy Butler?
"And Brown was right to do that.  Unlike Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons is afraid of contact, and that's brutally exploitable in playoffs.  However, the young socialite won the political struggle, got Brown and Butler run out of town, and got to be responsible for ball handling last year.  How'd that go ?  It's not a coincidence that none of the teams linked to Young Ben have aspirations that include winning multiple playoff series."
Jimmy Butler had a 35pt Triple double win + 5 steals in the NBA finals against this generation's greatest player.  Mr. Butler deserves no shade ever. He's a made man imo.
"Yeah, these posts are dumb. There is no need to hate on a guy on Jimmy Butler. What are you going to yell at him? ""Hey Jimmy, must suck making a half billion dollars to play basketball and becoming a top 10 player in the world at your peak. You fucking suck Jimmy"""
&gt; Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler missed the last two games of the regular season with a back injury.    https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/nba-playoffs-heats-jimmy-butler-status-for-game-1-with-bucks
"Dude you had J.J Redick (sp) and Jimmy Butler on ur team to teach you to to shoot and be a killer, and you fucked it.  Grab your cash and go lol. And I‚Äôm a fucking C‚Äôs fan too"
"This sub loves Jimmy Butler so a lot of people view KAT only through his perspective, which is very negative"
"Philly ousted Sam Hinkie because they didn't trust the process. They replaced him with Bryan Coangelo who was a nepotistic hire by Jerry Colangelo. When Hinkie left, the Sixers had the following assets on their books:  ASSETS:  * Joel Embiid  * 2016 1st round pick (became 1st pick/Simmons)   * Jerami Grant   * Christian Wood   * Richaun Holmes   * Robert Covington   * Dario Saric   * Nerlens Noel   * Jahlil Okafor   * 2016 Miami 1st round pick   * 2016 OKC 1st round pick   * Kings future 1st round pick   * Pick swap with the Kings   * Tons of 2nd round picks   ____  While hindsight is 20:20, it is undeniable that most of these assets were ultimately wasted. Brett Brown and the Colangelos completely wasted Philadelphia's window of contention by creating a culture which caused Jimmy Butler to want out. Shortly after picking Brown over Butler, they fired Brown and replaced him with Doc Rivers. After yet another 3-1 loss, Rivers threw Simmons under the bus in an interview which ignited the situation you are dealing with now.  There is no argument here, I just wrote that to be diplomatic. The Sixers FO has been terrible."

The thing that saved Kobe is his success cuz otherwise people would view his personality as an tryhard asshole similar to Jimmy Butler at Minnesota.

Finals Winner: Heat  Finals MVP: Jimmy Butler  MVP: Jimmy Butler   DPOY: Bam Adebayo  ROY: Micah Potter  MIP: Tyler Herro
People used to. It was really bad during the Jimmy Butler drama but it's died down a ton.
"That was never the point of contention. I would personally have RJ top 125. I just disagree with the assertion that he doesn‚Äôt deserve to get penalized for playing poorly. If we believe better player = better at helping team win the championship then its necessarily true that we compare players, in part, according to their playoff performance. For instance, Jimmy Butler is probably lower on most ppls list for 2022 than in 2021 despite putting better numbers in the regular season. Now, of course Butler might not be ten spots lower or even five lower but the point remains that he‚Äôs not ranked as highly."
"I genuinely do not believe Kyrie to be on that list.  \- Giannis  \- Luka  \- KD  \- Harden (the only player im listing who actually did do what is suggested)  \- Steph (would never happen, but if he wanted to leave im sure GS would grant his wish)  \- Dame  &amp;#x200B;  I honestly think any other player would be told to pound sand. Much like ben simmons currently is. There may be some other exceptions where a team would be incentivized to move on from a player for tax/cap reasons (say if Jimmy butler really wanted out of miami)"
"It's amazing how Ben and his team completely screwed this all up.   Somebody talked about how Ben was able to pick the right fights which covered his flaws. NCAA, LSU, Jimmy Butler, etc...   Almost all the reasons why he would want to get traded has a grain of truth. People for years, claimed Embiid and Simmons' offensive game overlaps where they hold each other back. He is getting a disproportionate amount of blame for the Atlanta loss (but still deserves the majority). The team tried to trade him in the first year of a 5 year contract, but he's the asshole for asking for a trade after 1 year of a 5 year contract.   This latest revelation does have a grain of truth in in as well, in the press conference after the game on Monday Night, when Andre Drummond answered ""We lost"" when asked about his individual performance. r/Sixers celebrated him for that, ""Team First!"" How much shit would Simmons get if he was going 0-6 from 3PT and costing the team games and playoff positioning for the first two years?   All these little bits of truth doesn't hide the major truth, he really never made that commitment to contributing in the half court. He could get to the line anytime he wants. His FTA &amp; FT% are poor, he should be getting to the line at least 5 times a game (10 attempts). He should be shooting 80% from the line. Giannis shoots 10 FTA a night a bit under 70% and that's an **extra 4pts a game!!!!**"
Jimmy Butler in shambles
"&gt;but his side didn‚Äôt do themselves any favors by taking it to the public this way. It tanked his trade value further as well as pissing off the fans.  It's not on him to preserve his trade value. If anything, it benefits him to tank his value.   It was the team's responsibility to keep this civil, once shit past the point of no return then why wouldn't he just sit out and put his future team in a better situation.  That's why you don't damage ties with players still on your roster.  &gt;Why not wait if you know the same deal is still there at the deadline  Because you don't know the same deal is there...Which is the point.   Waiting **at best** gets you the same offers as before. At worst, you end up having to settle for less.   Minnesota overplayed their hand with Jimmy Butler and ended up only getting Covington, Saric and a 2nd."
"Are you out of your mind?  The sixers let Jimmy fucking Butler go to please him. They forced Embiid to adjust to him. His team and fanbase has been defending him for years when everyone else was calling out his lack of professionalism. The guy had the roster built around him, the team being adjusted to fit his lack of shooting, had the fans and teammates standing up for him for years until it eventually blew up. Now, after both his managers publicly claiming they can't get to him, and with several years left on a 30 million dollar a year contract he chose to sign before fucking off like a spoiled brat because someone had the nerve to claim he was being unprofessional, you are trying to spin it the sixers dragged his name in the mud? LMAO.  Claiming the main factor in this mess is anything other than Ben Simmons being a spoiled brat is pathetic."
"You don't need to curse us bro.  Did you see what happened to DRose, we got cursed enough to make up for the 90s legends.  I guess I get it since the Jimmy Butler teams were so dominant against the Raps for a few  years there (~2011-2015 ish period)."
"I mean, I‚Äôm all for player empowerment in situations like Harden and Paul George. It does set a dangerous precedence but those guys shouldn‚Äôt be in the prime of their career, wasting away on teams that aren‚Äôt trying to compete. That‚Äôs only fair. A player signs a 4-5 year deal with the expectation that the organization will build a winning franchise around them. I believe if the franchise can‚Äôt build that contender, it‚Äôs only fair for the player to ask out. He‚Äôs no longer playing under the circumstances that he signed for. It is a slippery slope but it‚Äôs a fair way to do business.  Ben and the Sixers on the other hand. They were a winning, contending team. He has an MVP candidate teammate. They fired Brett Brown and Elton Brand. They got rid of Jimmy Butler for practically nothing. They brought in a winning coach (say what you want about Doc. I have my reservations on him as well but he does win basketball games). We can argue if those are positive or negative moves regardless of Simmons. But regardless, they are moves that the org made to get the team in a contending spot. They could‚Äôve easily unloaded Simmons a year ago but decided to keep him. They placated and coddled him every step of the way and he still cries that he wants out. Why? Because he‚Äôs too embarrassed to show his face to the teammates and fans that he disappointed? Because he thinks a different market will help his brand? Whatever the case may be, it has nothing to with the Sixers winning or losing and it has nothing to do with Simmons being on a contender or not. He‚Äôs just an immature cry baby who refuses to improve in any way that would help his team.  So while I think a player asking out of a contract can be warranted, I‚Äôm fully hoping the Sixers stand firm on this until they can move him or he budges. I almost have more respect for Kyrie than Simmons. Kyrie is selfish and an idiot. But at least he believes in something. Simmons is a pussy and doesn‚Äôt even believe in himself."
"""Employee refuses to give customers shots of espresso."" Jimmy Butler, probably."
Jimmy Butler and Kawhi are also better players than Ben Simmons will ever be though.
"LeBron was a supreme defender with the Heat, but the fact Giannis can be an impact defender as a wing or big really makes him more valuable.  Giannis had 5 blocks in Game 6 of the Finals along with his 50 points.  He also shut down Jimmy Butler for an entire playoff series.  That type of versatility in unique."
"&gt; Why are people here struggling to understand that trade leverage can change over time.  Because it's not based in reality.   Every single instance of teams ""waiting for a better offer"" on a malcontent player has resulted in those teams either getting the exact same offer or worse.  On one side you have case studies such as:  * Kawhi Leonard * Jimmy Butler * James Harden * Anthony Davis * Paul George * etc etc.  And on the other side of the debate we have case studies such as:  * N/A   ***  &gt; they have to wait until a team gets desperate.   There's also very little reality going on here too.  Historically, the market actually gets worse for sellers as the season progresses. [There's no real history of stars being sold at the deadline](https://ca.nba.com/news/revisiting-some-of-the-most-impactful-deals-at-the-nba-trade-deadline-since-the-year-2000/rk8sg9udnjt416rhzcbyald04) because the market is so grim that most teams looking to sell end up bailing early.  The trade deadline is a buyer's market and it's specifically a market for teams looking for cheap expiring contracts.    It's a terrible market to be selling a max player on a 4-year deal, because most of the league won't even be in a position to facilitate the trade.   One of the main reasons big trades happen in the offseason is because teams giving up big trade packages need all 3 of the draft, FA and buyout periods to restock their roster.    No, the Minnesota Timberwolves are not going to bring in 8 G-Leaguers to pad out their 7-man roster at the trade deadline, especially not if they're ""desperate"" to make the playoffs.     ***  The issue isn't everyone else not understanding. The issue is people mistaking desire for reality.   Just because you want something to happen doesn't mean it will.   &gt; put them in a better spot to win a championship  That ship has sailed.   Dame isn't available, and even if he was, there are other teams with better packages available."
"What did the agents for Juwan Howard, Glenn Robinson, Vince Carter, James Harden, Carlos Boozer, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving and whoever else advise their clients to do?   Kyrie literally threatened to have surgery if the team didn‚Äôt trade him and he sure as shit wasn‚Äôt signed by Klutch. Juwan Howard &amp; Glenn Robinson were rookies who even refused to play for the teams that drafted them and Klutch didn‚Äôt even exist.   What you are attributing to the agent you should be attributing to the player. The formula has always been make shit as uncomfortable and contentious as possible so the team trades you. Ben Simmons &amp; Daryl Morey are essentially playing a game of chicken.   An agent with a fiduciary duty to act in the client‚Äôs best interest is not going to advise their client to give up money, especially given the fact that the money cannot be recouped.   It is Ben Simmons decision to not report and y‚Äôall continually suggesting that Rich Paul would advise his client to give up money means you fundamentally don‚Äôt understand agent representation or the laws that govern agency agreements.   Again, y‚Äôall‚Äôs Rich Paul‚Äôs hate boner is fucking weird."
Jimmy Butler is not an elite iso scorer who can just get past every defender in the league. You can't just 'run creative sets' and get him open shots against stifling playoff defense in a 7-game series.
no one will give a shit lol look at Kawhi or Jimmy Butler.   the second he starts playing well for his new team the vast majority of people will forget all about this.
Coffee vs. Anti-Coffee match with Jimmy Butler. AEW book it now!

What is misogynistic about suggesting people had sex? He didn't say anything about her using it to advance her career. Is it misandrist toward Jimmy Butler?

"Top 15?  Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler, Jokic, KAT, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul  These are all players I would rather have. Honorable mentions (aka: players I would still rather have, but aren't as good as the above) - Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, Draymond Green, Pascal Siakam, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Zach Lavine, Bam Adebayo, Zion Williamson, Donovan Mitchell."
Unfortunately both of those guys lack the killer instinct that makes LeBron great. It‚Äôs why Jimmy Butler left both of em.
Jimmy Butler is fuming
That's an example of it not paying off.  Jimmy Butler took a QO with the Bulls and it paid off.

"Yall living in an alternate timeline? Jimmy Butler is a giant diva, thats where all those memes about him playing with the third string team on the wolves was about. Hes a giant baby that trash talks players on his team and creates toxic situations. That has been true for the Bulls and the Wolves, I dont know if that was the situation for the Sixers but obviously he was rubbing people wrong in the organization. He went to Miami because the team culture suits him and the organization historically appeases divas like lebron and wade. In about 2 seasons I can see him requesting a trade, you'll see him on the lakers or something."
"Larry nance jr, Jusuf nurkic, Jimmy Butler, Giannis, sabonis.   You have to be an above average defender in order to count as a hack of all trades, those are the rules. I didn‚Äôt make them so don‚Äôt get mad eat me."
Multiple things I disagree with  Combine the top 2 tiers  Luka has a better argument to be tier 3 than Embiid  PG is easily tier 5  Where the fuck is Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler.   Last season on the heat, he had a career high in almost every category except for scoring. He lead the league in steals and played every role for the heat both offensively and defensively.   I think he fits in this category because he‚Äôs not the greatest shooter.. but he could get a bucket when the time is right. He‚Äôs also not a traditional PG, but averaged 7apg since joining the heat."
"All while trying to make Jimmy look like the diva and bad guy.  I don‚Äôt care what the stats say, Jimmy should go down as one of the all-time winners for sure, fuck these near-triple double averaging, showboaters (not Westbrook though he has the same passion as Butler but just does too much, and smaller too) who don‚Äôt wanna win!"
"A large part of these rule changes involve jumping into airborne defenders.  That's really never been Harden's MO.  I think that's what he's talking about.  The armhooking, initiating contact, and stuff like that is all right up Harden's alley but he's never really been the guy to pump fake and jump into an airborn defender.  That's a Jimmy Butler/Trae Young type thing, not a Harden thing."
Jimmy Butler is the same way. We had a contentious game with Miami last year and Jimmy went to the post game with glowing feedback for RJ and his development. Classy stuff.
"Some good points for sure. Dray could definitely be an issue on a bad team‚Ä¶I put him in the Jimmy butler camp in terms of personality. Butler had a few years of being a locker room cancer label on bad teams. But when they win he‚Äôs a leader and passionate.   All that being said, at minimum you‚Äôre getting a top 3 DPOY candidate on any team. I think dray would be tremendous on most all teams but definitely by himself is leading a team anywhere. But very few defensive minded players would.   Would love to see Klay been a first option at some point. Or even his whole career. He adapted his game to play with Steph."
"I'm not going to dig through four years of Doogie's tweets to find the conversations about who pulled that trigger. They didn't put it into the official press to preserve their relationships with the front office. This stuff was all reported through twitter.  On Butler's contract, he wanted the Wolves to effectively offer him a new contract, which would have taken effect before his previous contract expired. In order to do that, they'd have to have the cap space to offer the additional money.  [From Jon K:](https://theathletic.com/534624/2018/09/19/sources-jimmy-butler-requests-trade-from-timberwolves/)  &gt;There were reports of friction between Butler, Towns and Wiggins, but sources say that is not the main reason Butler has decided to move on. Butler was hoping for a renegotiation and extension of his contract this summer, one that would have raised his salary for 2018-19 to $30 million and added another four years and $145 million on to that. But the Timberwolves would have had to cut an enormous amount of salary to pull that off and deemed it unreasonable if they wanted to stay competitive in the near term.  &gt;With that off the table, the Wolves offered a four-year, $110 million extension, which was the highest they could go under the rules of the collective bargaining agreement. Butler could get a new five-year deal worth $188 million from the Wolves next summer, so he turned that offer down."
"No, the other poster is right. Glen Taylor vetoed Thibs' attempt to trade Wiggins to Chicago. It's been pretty widely confirmed by the MN beat writers.  Thibs was GM, but Taylor has always meddled with the purse strings. He took Wiggins out to that famous dinner, had him promise to improve, and shook hands over the agreement.   Butler was his own dumb thing. He wanted us to gut the roster to offer him the max a year early. It would have required us to totally restructure things in order to have the cap space to make the offer AND Jimmy would have been making less due to signing the long term portion of the contract earlier. Just a dumb alpha-dog ""This is my team now"" move that he never got over.  What changed after one year was that Butler wasn't happy and demanded a trade. Thibs tried to hold onto him as long as he could because he thought he could change his mind and make him stay (didn't even bring the trade demand to Taylor, hushed it up), and that's what led to the whole media circus."
Taj Gibson Joakim Noah &amp; Jimmy Butler all developed under Thibs so this is extremely false.
jimmy butler
"Then you get to really fantasize about if Chicago had done Wiggins for Jimmy straight up. Rubio/LaVine/Butler/Millsap/KAT becomes an actual possibility.  Clearly it's just me rosterbating at this point since Zach was still recovering from the ACL, but man that team would have been fun."
"That‚Äôs just wrong. He literally offered Wiggins the max instead of butler. That is the first reason Butler created a snow ball effect of frustrations with the org.  Yea, that max offer came down from our owner. But if your saying thibs only made that trade for Butler with a strong plan of resigning Jimmy long term then what changed after just one year?  Also, we made the playoffs that year by one game. Missing lavine/Wiggins for a half of season would‚Äôve made us miss the playoffs for sure. And that‚Äôs not even mentioning lavine when he came back was healthy but not in form basketball wise, he didn‚Äôt play great when he came back."
When was the last time the Bulls were three games above .500? The Jimmy Butler era?
"If they pulled the trigger years ago they could have traded Ben for Jimmy Butler, that was the Wolves first request."

TJ ‚ÄúBubble‚Äù Warren sends his regards to Jimmy Butler
post jimmy butler tryna draw a foul
"Yeah Jimmy Butler anticipates where his defender is going to try to block and attempts to shoot through it.  Kobe and KD would also do this some what and it was called the rip through. You have to be smooth doing it because you can‚Äôt just latch your defenders arms into your shooting motion anymore.    Harden is arm hook and throwing head back in recoil. Kawhii also is big on the arm hook, but he does it while driving the lane. Vlade also would attempt to draw fouls this way, probably the most traditional way of doing it.     Reggie, Dwyane and Harden also would do the kick out, where they would jump fairly neutral, but move their legs forward to cause contact. The rule was changed for Reggie, but since it is a landing space issue it still sometimes gets called.    Luka was probably one of the biggest offenders of the jump in foul. Steph and Dame started doing it a lot after they saw how consistent it was. Trae also would do it a plenty.       Harden is not the face of this specific flopping, but he dabbles in all the flopping types because he is a true master of the flop."
"A lot of these guys go from pretty effortlessly winning their whole lives to going to a bad situation in the NBA and get fed up with losing. Part of me feels bad for Bagley since the Kings are seemingly refusing to trade him but also not really playing him. Just cut your losses if you don‚Äôt like the guy or trade him for anything. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm shocked if he‚Äôs a jackass‚Ä¶  I‚Äôve been lucky enough to work with a decent amount of NBA players. Jimmy Butler was the nicest one of them all. After I worked on something for him/the Bulls, I got texted a video message from him thanking us and inviting us out to a game next time we were in Chicago."

Jimmy Butler. Acknowledge his intensity and competitiveness. The whole ‚Äúget us to the playoffs and I‚Äôll take care of the rest‚Äù shit was just so cringey lol.
Jimmy Butler
"The timing is irrelevant as far as empathy goes you either have empathy for people or you don't and most people don't have it for popular figures being ridiculed by the mob. I guarantee you hes not doing this for public gain, look at how he's being dragged today for it.   I'm not sure what he did to publicly exacerbate things. He wanted a trade and avoided the team as long as he could. Doc and Embiid and the media did as much to exacerbate the situation as anyone, and compared to Ben, James Harden did more to embarrass his franchise, so did Jimmy Butler."
I wouldn't say KAT the team put Jimmy Butler a player that helped a lot to make the team into the playoffs I would say he was the main dude. Jimmy ended up traded because Kat didn't wanted him. Honestly now they have a very decent starting lineup.
100% agree.  Fultz over Tatum or Lonzo Not keeping Mikal Bridges Handling of Jimmy Butler Coddling Ben Simmons Drafting Okafor
If you look closely you can actually see Jimmy Butler in the back stirring shit up
I just hope this proves the differnce between scrappy players who get to the line a lot on legit fouls and the guys who leaned on foul baiting. Jimmy Butler is not the same kind of player as a Trae Young.
"It's still dumb to me to keep the top 50 from 1996. When they were ranking the top 50 in 96 there was less talent to be judged (let's say 2000 players). Now that they're ranking the top 75 out of say 4000, it's only natural the guys at the bottom of the top 50 list get pushed further down by all the new talent. Especially when a lot of these guys were very marginal talents.  Like by all means keep Petit, Mikan, Cousy on there. But we've got dudes who made 2 all star teams and never won a championship or MVP in the 60s on this list. Even players like Paul George and Jimmy Butler are more accomplished than some of the low tier 50s/60s players."
"Outside of CP3 and Patrick Ewing:   Carmelo Anthony, Dominique Wilkins, and lowkey Dame Lillard, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler"
"I agree it‚Äôs dumb, even though I agree with the general sentiment. A lot of people have talking points without knowing why they are true.   The reason it is immoral for the NBA owner to have that money is because he/she makes that money from exploitation and wage theft. no other way to do it. impossible to pay your employees what they are worth while amassing billions.   Jimmy butler earned the bulk of his cash from himself, nobody else. He‚Äôs actually underpaid, based on the money he brings in to the Heat (or they wouldn‚Äôt have hired him) in order to make a profit.   It‚Äôs not about how much you have, it‚Äôs about how you got it. Artists, athletes, musicians, etc. are the most honest of the wealthy class, but they still need that income taxed."
Imagine paying ven Simmons over paying jimmy butler
Jimmy Butler
Ima Bulls Fan but you Gotta Love Thibs he don‚Äôt give af. I remember him Playing Jimmy Butler 48min a night in Random January Games. Good Times.
TIL Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt short for James
"Nah she just sucks. She just makes cliche, predictable, generic ass comments all game long. You can figure out her talking points just by seeing what teams are playing that she is calling. Milwaukee? Giannis plays soo hard and is so incredible in transition. Portland? Dame's outside shooting is so incredible from the logo. Miami? Heat culture and how intense Jimmy Butler is.   She brings literally nothing to the games she calls. Putting the game on mute provides more information than what comes out of her monotone mouth."
Zero accountability with this bum i can see why they hired him  Jimmy Butler was right  Doc doesn't watch the game? Did his timeout guy not tell to take a timeout either? Maybe his play guy didn't teach him a good play
"No one had a problem when Dwight was giving Jimmy Butler a concussion at the end of game 5 of the finals, ensuring an easy game 6 victory, but now that the team is imploding, time to scapegoat him for hacking."
Same energy Bulls fans gave Jimmy Butler when he was just a young rook clawing for minutes.
"We are the ""Jimmy Butler taking out his rearview mirror cause he hates looking back"" of fanbases but for brakes."
"It's all about the times.  Jimmy Butler is 32, the salary cap is $112 million.  When AI was 32, the cap was $55 million."
"For the spurs:  Malcolm Brogdon - 2016  Kawhi Leonard - 2011  Jimmy Butler - 2011  Nikola Jokic - 2014  Last spot is between Derrick White, Norman Powell, and Larry Nance Jr. I'd say."
"It's silly too because the difference between Jimmy Butler and someone like Jeanie Buss or other lower net worth owner is smaller than Jeanie and Ballmer yet both Jeanie and Ballmer are wealthy, but Jimmy isn't?"
Jimmy Butler is rich. The guys that‚Äôve signed Jimmy Butlers checks is wealthy.
Jimmy Butler is wealthy. What did he do wrong
I could see Barrett developing into a Jimmy Butler-type player
"Klay is an above average defender and one of the most efficient shooters in NBA history. I don't think anyone says Klay is a ""historically"" good defender.    But how many guards that made the all defensive list this past decade would you elect to sign over Klay Thompson?  A list that's basically voted on by reporters who read player stat sheets and vote based on blocks and steals.  Chris Paul sure...arguably Jrue Holiday or Jimmy Butler..  But how about Matisse Thybulle?  Tony Allen?  Patrick Beverley?  Eric Bledsoe?  How about Ben ""Lebron 2.0"" Simmons who defers a layup in the playoffs?  You want Oladipo or Roberson instead?  John Wall?!?  And how is John Stockton a 3 &amp; D player at all?  A 38% 3fg shooter that averaged less than 2 attempts per game compared to Klays 42% on 7 attempts per game?"
You likely hire a company and there are tons in florida. Plus it‚Äôs jimmy butler lol he has the money for it
Jimmy butler ? Please.
"Man the morons in this thread would have you think Klay just sits and shoots and can't do anything else. If jimmy butler top 75 klay top 75. If Dave Cowans top 75, klay top 75. If god damn Sam Jones top 75, klay top 75."
"Well...you see, Jimmy Butler is my father. So I can‚Äôt relate"
"Klay is such an entitled douche. It‚Äôs funny him and Jimmy Butler are this subs golden boys that can‚Äôt do no wrong. Klay is a great player and will make the HOF fame but he is literally more of a Chauncey Billips than Ray Allen. It‚Äôs funny how good a players reputation can be if they are on good teams.  I mean if you want me to choose who wins a 1v1 between KAT or Klay, I‚Äôm putting my money on Klay. It‚Äôs just ridiculous."
"Fouls off-ball just aren't called as much and when you're the GOAT off-ball player that's a problem you're going to face. He's actually pretty good at playing through contact when driving to the rim, he just doesn't do it as much as other players like Harden, Lebron, Jimmy Butler. Who dominate the ball."
"I posted this in an r/sixers thread.  Here‚Äôs my running list:  The 30 for 30 on The Process is going to be so insane.  All the injuries to draft picks who sat our entire seasons, Fultz and Simmons baggage, the bounce shot on the Toronto series, burner/collar-gate, the Collangellos in general, Jah fighting a Celtics fan and also getting busted by the cops with a gun while speeding, Mike Scott fighting an Eagles fan during a tailgate while wearing a redskins Jersey, almost killing Zhaire Smith, Jimmy Butler in general, will Dario ever come over?, MCW won rookie of the year, wanting to re-sign Nerlens (instead of Al Horford) only to have his agent not take our calls, and now Nerlens is suing and the sixers offer might be the thing that makes his case, Adam Silver interfering with everything on behalf of the other team owners‚Ä¶.  What a wild ride we‚Äôve been on for so long."
Crazy that after we won Ben got the confidence to be a knock down shooter helped by Jimmy Butler coaching him up in the off-season
Paul George and Jimmy Butler do not belong on a top 75 list
"I disagree with this. He is Top 75 as are other guys like Paul George and Jimmy Butler that were left out.  However, since they kept the original 50 in place, I don‚Äôt think any of these guys were in the next 25 to be added on. There were a lot of guys that could be removed for modern players if you‚Äôre trying to just make the best 75 players list, and not a next 25 list."
"Pretty wild that people are really just saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a 90% chance he‚Äôs lying‚Äù as if the entire NBA community hasn‚Äôt been ripping him to shreds for the last 4 months straight (much of this is self-inflicted but that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt AFFECT him still). It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre talking about Jimmy butler here, this guy has clearly had confidence issues for the past year"
"&gt;Weird, I just saw a clip of him trash talking KAT and the franchise two years later. So strange that it was all about money and he didn't actually care but still did that.   Because he gave an ultimatum to Minnesota to pay either him or KAT because both of them were due for an extension.  &gt;It doesn't matter WHAT he's unhappy about - this isn't about Butler at all.   I mean you literally said Butler feels bad about what he did in Minnesota :(   &gt;If he's unhappy the franchise won't create room to give him a max extension - that's still him being genuinely unhappy.   The franchise wanted to max him but wanted to wait until the off-season to do so with his bird rights. You are entirely missing the point on why Jimmy Butler was a piece of shit in this situation.  I only replied about the Butler part because you are factually on every account wrong. His situation isn't at all comparable because he was willing to destroy KAT's career for his own sake."
"&gt;What are you talking about? Philadelphia couldn't max him that year either - in fact they balked at it that offseason and he forced a sign and trade.   I'm talking about his time in Minnesota.  [Butler rejects the Timberwolves' four-year, $110 million contract extension offer. It's the maximum offer the Wolves can give under league rules, but Butler was reportedly hoping that the team would make the necessary roster moves to restructure his contract and offer more money. As a free agent in the summer of 2019, Butler could be offered a five-year, $188 million contract from the Wolves or a four-year, $139 million contract from another team.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jimmy-butler-trade-request-timeline-how-the-situation-got-so-bad-with-tom-thibodeaus-minnesota-timberwolves/)  He wasn't unhappy in Minnesota he wanted to get his max."
[after not being able to beat KAT with the Heat for 2 years in our last game he finally started taking trash to him](https://youtu.be/KwHoVbwII1M)  If after 2 years you still hate on KAT and the Wolves you don't feel bad about anything.  Besides he only wanted out because he wouldn't wait until the off-season to receive his max from us. He wanted us to trade Teague and whoever else so we could free cap space to sign him to a max that summer.  Jimmy Butler isn't some folsky hero that should be admired and is just a greedy person who will stamp over others to get what he wants.
&gt;Jimmy Butler must've genuinely felt bad about his situation in Minnesota.  Cap. Nobody who feels bad about his situation goes on national TV and throws his teammates under the bus. Nobody who feels bad about their situation for months after being traded keeps taking shots at his old team and teammates.
So sad we kept Ben Simmons instead of jimmy butler
Jimmy Butler seems like a fun guy.
"I'm pretty shocked that AI pulled that little compared to Jimmy. Is Butler really better by him to such an extent, or is it just a case of times and earnings changing?"
So a deluxe jimmy butler coffee experience.
"No team with a Ben Simmons caliber player would be mad if they traded for James Harden. James Harden is a top 5 player in the NBA. Ben Simmons is a tier below.  And the ben Simmons didn‚Äôt fuck Ben the sixers . They did that to themselves by playing passive on a max contract with a legitimate all star in jimmy butler then they maxed alhoford and Tobias. They are a tier below every other contender because they tried to game the system now their pieces don‚Äôt fit. Ben Simmons will be an all NBA player wherever he goes, the sixers will be a shit franchise whom ever goes there. Punishment for the scummiest move in NBA history."
Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt going to be going broke hahaha. Dude is smart and I‚Äôm sure has his money managed well. Players going broke is most common back in the day or from players on smaller contracts. But once you get to superstar level - making hundreds of millions of dollars from endorsements and contracts - you‚Äôre not going broke lol
Jimmy Butler has that Ugly Wanda energy
Those are 3 pretty extreme cases but none of them made Jimmy Butler money.  Antoine Walker career earnings of 108M. Highest paid season was 14M.  AI career earnings 155M. Highest paid season 21M.   Latrell Sprewell career earnings 97M. Highest paid season was 14M.  Jimmy Butler career earnings 145M. He still has 184M guaranteed over the next 4 seasons. Highest paid season 34M and he will be getting 52M in 2025-2026.
I want to remind y‚Äôall that what the Sixers FO is doing right now is the same scumbag tactics that NFL owners use. Jimmy Butler was an absolute asshole for the way he acted while forcing himself off the Twolves yet Jimmy got a pass because ‚Äúhe just wants to win‚Äù. Throughout this whole Ben Simmons saga people have been conflating multiple different conversations. Is Ben in any place to demand a trade? I don‚Äôt think so. But is it best that Simmons and the Sixers part ways at this point? I say that‚Äôs a resounding yes
Timberwolves go .500 without Jimmy Butler challenge (impossible)
I don't think the guys who go bankrupt typically have Jimmy Butler money.
"I think Morey‚Äôs logic for the trade value part is that it‚Äôs kind of a vague thing. People know how good he is at everything besides the one glaring deficiency and coaches vote him for these awards and recognition etc. so even if he doesn‚Äôt play, he‚Äôs banking on desperation or at least more horses in the race so that teams have to compete against each other to inflate the value beyond where it is now. It‚Äôs def a gamble but I think it‚Äôs the right strategy bc esp now, it seems the team isn‚Äôt seeing it as much of a distraction as fans and teams around the league may think. From everything players have said they don‚Äôt actively hate Ben but it‚Äôs brought the team closer as they can focus on basketball and the guys who are invested and when he shows he wants to show up then they‚Äôll welcome him. If it was like super toxic and Ben was pulling a Bynum and repeatedly fucking off practices and never saying anything else then it would be more pressure to get it over with imo. But ironically his personality is kind of an extension of his play style on offense lol, he‚Äôs not that Jimmy butler aggressive type so he‚Äôd at best be passive about the hold outs and not be a super disruption (saying no and then getting sent home is a quick thing but I bet they knew he‚Äôd try something like that) and he‚Äôs not gonna be loud and boisterous either bc he‚Äôs an introvert and generally quiet. I think Morey just called the bluff again yesterday and he realizes he needs to at least put in effort and they‚Äôll still try and give him his wish of s trade but now isn‚Äôt the best time.   Who knows if he actually plays at all before like December but I think this is a big step to actually discuss with the team and his teammates bc before he was ignoring everybody in the facility. And while we have a lot of disdain for him now, if he did ever play again and show an improved version of himself and we win games, the boos will get quieter after like the first few home games. And if he makes some good PR type quotes postgame etc. he‚Äôs def scared of that reaction but it won‚Äôt be permanent unless he plays badly or shows the same timidness as before but luckily that‚Äôs mostly in the playoffs and he should be dealt by then lol"
"If Jimmy Butler came in and said he wasnt mentally ready to play then i'd call bullshit.    With Ben, its 100% possible that it's the truth.  Dude won't shoot a basketball, he's got some issues."
"&gt;Herro provided that remark to Jeremy Tache of Bally Sports Florida, who    asked him about his career projections and what his goals were    long-term.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;""I feel like I'm in the same conversion as those guys. The young guys    coming up in the league who can be All-Stars, superstars one day‚ÄîLuka,    Trae, Ja‚Äîthose guys like that, I feel like my name should be in that    category, too.  What do you want him to say here?  /r/nba has a bitter jealousy of Tyler Herro it is really strange. If Jimmy Butler said he was in the conversation of players that are better than him, everyone would be happily conversing on how you want a player with that dawg in him and that hustler mentality. But no, because it is Tyler Herro, he is delusional? Newsflash, nothing he said is wrong. Tyler Herro could be an All-Star one day. It is not outside the realm of possibility, especially if he plays like he did last night."
Jimmy Buffett is supposedly around 600-650M net worth. Big Face Coffee would have to expand for Butler to keep up
"Jimmy Butler asked Kyle Lowry to buy a 100k gift. Lowry refused. Butler asked again. Lowry said no again. Butler then told Lowry he should go home, Lowry threw it back and left."
Shoutout to the Jimmy Butler episode of Tanked
ESPN: tensions grow in Miami as Heat star Jimmy Butler extorts 6 figure sum out of teammate
"Yeah but like...it's a joke. It's not Jimmy Butler's fault that those exploitations are happening, and in fact NBA players are doing more to bring awareness to those issues than most other millionaire athletes. It's not like if Jimmy Butler doesn't talk about his wealth people will forget how much money he has. We all know these guys are rich as hell, and honestly, if you just look at it from an economic standpoint, they earned their wealth based on how much revenue they generate at their job.  If you actually want to change the system, then don't let Jimmy Butler making a joke distract you from who the real villains are."
"It's not Steph's fault that he was born privileged, but it's hard to get excited when the guy whose NBA star dad had trained him from his pre-teen years with the best possible coaching, facilities, equipment, etc. succeeds. You know who makes me feel good? Giannis. And Jimmy Butler. And even Draymond. Or a few hundred other guys before I'd get all emotional about Steph and Klay. I'm not criticizing them; they're great. They're just a boring story.   You probably thought that Shooter McGavin was robbed of his green jacket, too."
"Jimmy ""Mizuhara Chizuru"" Butler and Kyle ""Kazuya Kinoshita"" Lowry"

he's not top 10. LeBron KD Russ Kawhi Steph Harden Dwight Jimmy Butler CP3 Giannis shit even PG might be higher than dame
Jimmy wasn't a proven winner when he forced his way out of Minny. The bulls won 1 series in 2013 (Butler averaging 11/4/3) and 1 series in 2015. That's it.

Im feeling big Jimmy Butler vibes from his growth under Thibs. Namely becoming such a good defender while also never being a loss on the other end
"GIANNIS WASHED EURO, JIMMY JORDAN BUTLER FOR FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN"
also Jimmy Butler gave his top shelf coffee to Tyler Herro
"Possibly, I don't think we'd start Gabe Vincent. But if Lowry's out we probably have Jimmy be the primary handler and he could share point time with Herro.  In our first preseason game Butler was out and Herro started at the 3 alongside the other regular starters, and it looked fine."
"Yea AD, while some would say questionable, is more than deserving of being considered on the list. His resume is much better than Shaq‚Äôs was when he was included in the top 50 in 1996. And I know people complain about the use of advanced metrics, but being third all-time in PER behind two of the best ever, MJ and Lebron, is nothing to snuff at. It shows the whole potential of what AD could do if he has it all together and is healthy. He was the anchor of the Lakers‚Äô defense in their title run and was arguably their best player all the way till like Game 3 of the Finals when Lebron showed more consistency, and a memorable game 6 duel with Jimmy Butler, in that series."
Jimmy Butler
Butler downplayed it in front of the media but yes it‚Äôs clear we did. The Bucks also did it to us last season. We were even missing Jimmy.
Jimmy Butler is an asshole.  He is much worse than anything Ben is doing.   Jimmy got all dick hard over the fact that Wiggins got his contract before he did even if there was no way to give him one until the end of the season.
So what Jimmy Butler did on the Wolves?
"So serious question, who is winning MVP? Jimmy Butler or Bam Adebayo? Or will they just give the MVP to the entire Miami Heat team like they did for the Hawks with that Player of the Month award?"
"And every player in the NBA knows that if you go back, they will set you up to take the fall.   For the first time in ben Simmons entire career, we are talking about his scoring as the reason his team didn‚Äôt succeed in the playoffs. They set him up to take the fall. Ben Simmons, all NBA , all star, one of the best young talents in the league renowned for his defensive prowess, is a shit player because of scoring.   If he steps foot on a playoff court, and the sixers lose (which they will because they are a shit playoff team), he will take the fall for the loss again.   This team isn‚Äôt a team of accountability, first they blamed the GM, then the coach, then jimmy butler, then the new coach, then Ben Simmons. After Ben is doc, then Morey. Then the cycle of blame continues.   Ben and embid don‚Äôt fit, they knew a year ago and made a push to change it, now they are lying to y‚Äôall and you are eating it up."
"To be fair with Chicago it all came down to Derrick's unfortunate injury, if that never happened realistically they get a chip or at the very least make the NBA finals. In Minnesota he was coaching a bad team, still brought them to the playoffs thanks to Jimmy Butler too. In New York in the span of just 1 season hes brought them from irrelevancy to the 4th seed, give him some time to prove himself with this squad and he may just pleasantly surprise us"
Jimmy Butler is a baby
Seeing this and the Wiggins is too much to bear. I fucking hate Jimmy Butler
Jimmy butler and say I wasn‚Äôt dribbling my basketball
"I agree. Nobody is perfect, but that doesn't mean that trading KAT gives them anything.  Through the years we've seen both that KAT's quality can make a very bad team about average, and that when he was with other good players (Jimmy Butler), the results improved proportionally on both ends. I think he's just a plus."
"It doesn't need to be a ""generational"" player to be better than Beal.  In the last few years there has been Tatum, Luka, Trae, Ja, Zion, lamelo, Edwards...   yes, the lottery is dependent on chance, but if you spend a couple years rebuilding eventually you'll get a good pick.  Also NY, LA, and Miami have advantages of being destination cities, which DC is not.  We can't just go out and get Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, KD, etc."
"It's funny to me when people act like the wolves were a surefire top seed had Jimmy Butler not gotten that injury. They went 8-9 in that 17 game stretch he was injured and the west was super close all of that season.  Also I'd say the wolves average to slightly above average in terms of team health that year. Jimmy Butler missing 23 games was their only significant injury and 3 of their starters played in literally every game.  The spurs were missing Kawhi 73 games. The warriors were missing Curry 31 games, KD 14 games, Klay 9 games, and Draymond 12 games. The rockets were missing CP3 24 games and Harden 10 games. The jazz were missing Rudy Gobert 26 games. All of those teams had similar injury issues or worse."
"Spot on.  My only update is that Jimmy Butler is most like Kise. Noted for having a complete all-around playstyle with less emphasis on the three, plays true small forward (vs. Lavine and George who also often listed as SF/SG), has outside business and modeling interests, known for a more humorous personality, adapts his playstyle depending on the situation (like in the scrimmage with the third stringers where he only shot the ball once), and can enter the Zone to compete one-on-one with the greatest like in his 40-point triple double win against the Lakers in the Finals when Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic were out.  &amp;#x200B;  My only"
For sure...  &amp;#x200B;  No Jimmy Butler... Laker's victory **should have been easier** without facing his tenacious defense and without needing to stop his 4th-qtr midrange game.
Jimmy Butler is an elite player tho
"First half of first sentence is fine,  but ragging on a guys ‚Äúheart‚Äù and ‚Äúwillpower‚Äù when his teammates all suck is just petulant  Also, sick of folks pretending that Butler did it on his own. People rag on Towns because the team lost while Butler was out, but takes it on faith that Jimmy would have carried the team to wins had the situation been reversed. Despite the fact that Chicago was pretty underwhelming the previous two seasons, with better role players than the Wolves had."
"There's a reason Butler was able to beat them using 3rd stringers. You can say a lot of things about Jimmy, but one thing is for certain, he is passionate about winning. I think that's why he blew up on the Wolves starters. They seem like they are not as passionate about winning as much as Jimmy."
"Like I said, you're pointing out a correlation.   Okay we can look at the more average joe. Shane Larkin had a wingspan of 5'10, mediocre if not bad shooter.   Mulder can shoot extremely well, his problem is more mental. Has insane wingspan for his height.   Jimmy Butler, short wingspan, has been shooting between 24-29% from 3p t range and is just inconsistent in general.   Plumlee, very short wingspan for his height, awful shooter from everywhere. Same with Cody Zeller.   Kawhi has a long ass wingspan, elite shooter from midrange and 3pt. Same goes for Tatum and Paul George.   Wilt despite having Gobert level wingspan and shooting terribly from free throws, had actual reputation for being an elite perimeter player at the time. KAT has a 7'4 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Jokic has a 7'3 wingspan and can shoot like crazy. Embiid is well above average too. Tobias Harris, 6'11 wingspan. Harden, 6'11 wingspan. McGrady 7'2 wingspan.   I'm not really seeing a pattern here."
Wolves blew their best chance at any relevance with the Jimmy Butler situation
"Our organisation is the most pitiful one in basketball debatedly all of sports. The wolves have only ever been better than mediocre once, I have 0 faith in them to ever accomplish anything and consistently ruin great players. Jimmy Butler told us this but we vilified him and yet only now people are beginning to accept that he was right all along about everything."
"For real tho, Wiggins with like KG or Jimmy Butler mentality is a first ballot HOFer"
Why is Jimmy Butler dressed as a typical LA homeless man
"I remember specifically Wiggs and Jimmy were just laughing and talking, thick as thieves, after a regular season game. Last year, I think. But I remember taking note of that and coming to the conclusion that butler probably haaaaates KAT if he and Wiggs are just chilling like that."
Jimmy Butler smiling in the nosebleeds
Jimmy Butler drafting his congratulations message to Wiggins right now.
KAT IS TERRIBLE. JIMMY BUTLER IS RIGHT!
"Bruh your team even drove away Jimmy Butler lmao. Your team needs all Jordan, Kobe, Jimmy, Giannis, and Tim Duncan to change the culture."
Jimmy butler left so Tyler herro could cook the Lakers

Brian scalabrine and jimmy butler?

Jimmy Butler and co gonna be waiting outside their Lakers locker room after that one
Jimmy butler is the poster child for fake tough guy. Jokic exposed this fake tough heat team
"It was fun alternating between ""send Jokic to Gitmo"" and ""the ghost of Slobodan Milosevic will haunt Jimmy Butler"""
"Watch some of the guys that play through contact, guys like Giannis and Jimmy Butler are feasting with refs calling real fouls and not jumping into defenders"
Bulls game plan on who to attack after game:   **ATTACK**  Jokic  **BOX AND 1**   Jimmy Butler  Kyle Lowry  Dewayne Dedmon  Bam Adebayo
"They need a good floor general for the playoffs, doesn't have to be a PG, imagine if they had a versatile wing that can playmake like Jimmy Butler"
"Nah man you got it wrong, at least with me. I loved Jimmy and I hold no ill will towards him for wanting out. I wish we would have kept LaVine and traded Wiggins instead, which is exactly what my gut was *screaming* at me when we made the trade. LaVine‚Äôs just got it, and Wiggins doesn‚Äôt. It was evident during their time with us.  Butler is a stud. Dude dragged us to our only playoff win without KG and I‚Äôll always be grateful for that. I just miss Zach."
Talk about diminishing value  2019: Traded for Jimmy Butler  2020: Traded for Seth Curry  2021: Traded for Moses Brown
So does Jimmy Butler
"I don‚Äôt think he needs an excuse for his behavior. If a player wants out, it‚Äôs in his best interests to be what fans will see as an ass. That‚Äôs just how the league is structured. We can‚Äôt look at this at a friendship because what it‚Äôs really two sides of a business. I don‚Äôt doubt Simmons has issues and I don‚Äôt doubt he‚Äôs using this to not play for the team. Both are true If it wasn‚Äôt this method, it would be the Jimmy Butler method. It‚Äôs not in his best interests to play nice with the Sixers, that‚Äôs not how you get traded. It‚Äôs not about being professional."
"Jimmy Butler is lowkey one of the biggest foul baiters in the league but I never really see anyone call him out for it  He doesn't do the Dame ""trick play"" on threes(as he's not a high volume three point shooter) but he does do the Harden technique of driving and not even attempting to score, instead just trying to draw contact and get FTs"
"What? I said winning, not pretending to be.  For example they should have signed Carlisle in the summer as a coach. Players, there are a lot of players better than Jimmy Butler (which is a great basketball player) in doing the whole leadership stuff. Unluckily they didn't know that in advance."
"\&gt;I think they had to change their mentality from the ground, bring in veteran and winning players/coaches that may help them really growing.     Maybe some Jimmy Butler/Tom Thibodeau types?"
Jimmy Butler: anyone want coffee $20  PJ Tucker: anyone want Kobes $20k
"No, it is a good argument when you don't twist what he said to fit your narrative/argument.   How is anyone shocked that when you take 2 All NBA caliber players and put them on the same team, the team is good.. but then when you take one player off the team.. the team becomes bad or worse. Shocking, I KNOW!  Go look at the teammates Towns has played with outside of the Butler year. Tell me how many of those players were a top 50 player. Top 75? The Wolves have done him no favors to put legit talent next to KAT.   And I'd like to remind everyone, when everyone was saying you'd have to trade 2 firsts, AT LEAST, to get off Wiggins (he was very bad), was the year Jimmy came over and the year after. Jimmy AND KAT carried that team to the playoffs. There's a reason KAT was an All star, All NBA player that year. He put up great numbers an, without a shadow of a doubt, helped take that team to the playoffs.   Ridiculous and biased to say otherwise."
The Wolves only made the playoffs the 1 year Jimmy Butler was there. KAT‚Äôs value can‚Äôt be super high when he has shown to not be able to impact winning as the main guy.
"Name the second best player (after Jimmy Butler, when we made the playoffs) that KAT has ever played with.  It's not even clear who that player is, but no matter who you choose, that player probably kind of sucks.  Not to mention our past draft picks: Culver, Okogie, Dunn"
I wonder what would've happened if the sixers traded Simmons for Kawhi.  They would've had Jimmy Butler or Joel Embiid as their third best player in the playoffs. Maybe Kawhi even stays.
I was ok with not giving Jimmy Butler the max because he wasn't an ideal fit next to Embiid and Simmons. He was also a little older so I was leery of his max contract turning into a toxic asset later on.  Egg on my face. Guess I'm as dumb as CoAngelo.
"Yeah, I think it's dumb too, but apparently that's the discussion. Jokic is ""tough"" just because he has big Serbian brothers who look mean. Whereas Jimmy Butler is an ""all bark, no bite bitch"" who grew up homeless in Texas and has faught people on every team he has ever been on.  This sub is rediculous. I really don't get the Jokic fanboying.  EDIT: apparently one of Jokics brothers is an amateur MMA fighter but fighting skills aren't exactly genetic"
Bulls fan here‚ÄîI agree with you. Pacers feel like they‚Äôre in the same purgatory that Bulls were in with the Jimmy Butler/DWade/Rondo squad. Moving Sabonis would offer them a chance to retool that Turner really wouldn‚Äôt.
"seriously though, Trez is currently 3rd in win shares per 48, trails only Nikola Jokiƒá and Jimmy Butler"
"Done pretty well for himself being unathletic, as you put it, with an MVP and as the best center in the game. Love to see what he could do if he was athletic like Jimmy ‚ÄúNo MVP‚Äù Butler."
With Jimmy Butler at place 2 and 4 to accurately represent the chaos he brings. I'm already liking this list.
Jimmy butler yelled at them ‚Äúmeet me out back‚Äù when he was being physically separated. I‚Äôm sure he just wanted ‚Äúto talk‚Äù.
"So Simmons is Magus and Embiid is Frog and since Embiid (Frog) has turned down the choice to kill Simmons (Magus) because it won't bring Chrono (Jimmy Butler) back, Simmons decides to join the gang because he has a score to settle with Lavos (Trae Young)?"
Jimmy Butler makes $34.38M this season and was fined 30k.  That's the same as someone who makes $50k getting fined $43.63
Yup. Jimmy Butler is still getting boatload of calls.
We weren't talking about Morris. I'm saying Jokic is a pussy and jimmy butler would give him the fucking hands.
"&gt; Counterpoint, since Morris didn't get suspended, won't this incentivize dirty players to do this in the playoffs?  I assume opposing teams will be prepared for it next time... don't have your star respond, then call a timeout, sub in an end-of-the-bench guy, and hit Jimmy Butler mid-air next time he goes up for a dunk or layup."
"We had Chris Paul, AD, and Jrue for years. Eventually most players will leave, so those were bad examples.  Randle signed a 1 year deal there to replace Boogie and we let him walk when we knew we were picking Zion, because they play the same position and neither can effectively play another one. Another bad example.  Christian Wood Barry played with us, and we waived him. Another bad example.  Pelicans could‚Äôve brought Lonzo back if they wanted to, but decided to sign and trade him instead. That was the Pelicans decision, not Lonzo‚Äôs, so another bad example.  We literally extended JV before the season so that doesn‚Äôt even make sense.  Zion has lots of years left, and the Pelicans may want to trade Zion before Zion even wants to be traded with the way things are looking.  BI said he wants to be here and is behaving that way, plus he has multiple years left on his deal.  I could say Philly is a farm team because AI, Barkley, Jimmy Butler, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, Christian Wood, and JJ Redick all left.  Also, Ben Simmons is about to leave.  Also, Joel Ennius will force us way out after you fail  to put enough talent around him and get eliminated early in the playoffs again.  Tobias Harris will probably want out after that too.  Let‚Äôs just play it safe and say Tyrese Maxey will want out after that as well.  How did that post even get this many upvotes? ü§¶"
Yea Jokic brothers will smoke the Morris twins and Jimmy Butler too.
"I mean the 76ers aren‚Äôt particularly great at retaining talent either. Off the top of my head.   Andre Igoudala, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, Mikal Bridges, Al Horford, Ben Simmons (soon)  None of these guys are as criminal as AD and CP3, but you can conceivably make a deep playoff run with these guys alone."
Their problem was that coach they had when Jimmy Butler was there.  That was their shot.
"Current NBA players are conditioned to whine at the refs, Giannis barely finished his motion and he was already looking at the ref... c'mon man, finish it strong without thinking about fouls, do it like Jimmy Butler. This league desperately needs more physical play, it's walking in the right direction at least"
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. Maybe it‚Äôs a mentality thing. Shame. KAT seemed primed to be a big deal, but he‚Äôs basically been persona non grata in the league since Jimmy Butler left."
"A million stars have been traded in recent years. Kawhi, Paul George, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Nikola Vucevic, Jrue Holiday etc   The Blazers never seriously went after any of them. They could have beaten what some of those guys got back from the teams that traded for them."
KD is insane. Kg is 1st in FGM and 10th in FGA. Jokic is 3rd in FGM and 33rd in FGA. Jimmy Butler and KAT are also quite good in this statistic and are also havin quite efficient seasons
"&gt;The NBA has suspended Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic for one game,...    &gt;   &gt;Morris has been fined $50,000 for initiating the altercation, and Miami forward Jimmy Butler was also dealt a $30,000 fine for attempting to escalate the altercation."
"Let me start by saying Jimmy Butler would kick my ass. He‚Äôs a 6 foot 6 super athlete. So he would probably kick 99.9% of the worlds ass.   2 things.   1. Jokic isn‚Äôt in that 99.9%  2. Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt really want to fight him, or else he would have at the beginning of the scuffle when he ran up and hugged him.   Nobody likes to get held back in a fight more then professional athletes. They love to fake fight. I would do the same thing, I mean way to much to lose to actually fight. I just thinks it‚Äôs funny how dumb they look when the fake get held back."
Backcourt Jimmy Butler trying to get his boys posed for that insta
"I know I‚Äôve been guilty of virtue signaling and being facetious and posturing for my friends. The Heat organization‚Äôs response is exactly what I‚Äôd want and expect if I were or felt like some kind of a member of it. I agree tho that that doesn‚Äôt mean some of their reactions aren‚Äôt funny or silly. Jokic would likely beat jimmy butler in any kind of scrum but if you‚Äôre a member of the heat, I suppose you want to see your teammate express that kind of fire. Even if it is transparent."
"Honestly, I don't think Jokic would have really minded either. He would probably get heated, but he would get it.   Jimmy Butler is a fool for acting like this came out of nowhere."
HAHAHAHA RACHEL NICHOLS AND JIMMY BUTLER HAHAHAHAHA
Take Jokic‚Äôs side all you want but calling Jimmy Butler a fake tough guy is just not it lol
"Full excerpt from the statement:  &gt; In addition, Miami forward Jimmy Butler has been fined $30,000 for attempting to escalate the altercation and failing to comply with an NBA Security interview as part of the review process pertaining to an on-court matter.  Not sure why but that made me lol irl"
"Well yea lol I don't expect Jokic to have the best season of all time. The post was about what he's done so far, I was just adding to it. Jimmy Butler so far this season is having like the 8th best season of all time by that metric too"
"They literally said so my man, they said they increased it to a flagrant 2 because of Jokic‚Äôs cheap shot. If he never retaliated it wouldn‚Äôt have been a Flagrant 2.  ‚ÄúQUESTION: I have never heard that before, that if the first shot leads to a retaliation, that goes into consideration on the foul the first guy gets?

Jokic to the Heat for Jimmy Butler and Markieef Morris
"In recent memory, probably someone like Jimmy Butler"
If they suspend Jokic they need to suspend Jimmy Butler and Bam for equal time.
Jimmy Butler should just a wear a damn cape at this point with how extra and overdramatic he is.
jimmy butler is worse.
"So to be clear, LeBron with Wiggins as the second option should be at least the same level as Jimmy Butler, KAT, and Wiggins who barely made the playoffs? Replace Jimmy Butler and KAT on that team with LeBron and they make the playoffs too, correct?"
Jokic and his brothers would eat Jimmy Butler
TIL Jimmy Butler has an outie  And TIdidn'twanttoL that Jimmy Butler has an outie
What I want is either a Jokic repeat or a Jimmy Butler MVP
"Haha reminds me of how Mark Wahlberg thinks he would've stopped 9/11:  &gt;‚ÄúIf I was on that plane with my kids, it wouldn‚Äôt have went down like it did. There would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin and then me saying, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to land somewhere safely, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äô‚Äù [Source](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/01/mark-wahlberg-thinks-he-could-have-stopped-911.html)  Him and Jimmy Butler are bros too which makes a ton of sense."
Rookie Jimmy Butler maybe
"Hall of Lame, unfortunately. Love me some Lowry and Jimmy Butler but this is a poser move.  Great picture though."
I love Jimmy Butler dude
My guy I just think Jimmy Butler is a very good basketball player and I like to remind Sixers fans (who mocked us when we built the team around him) when they start to talk shit. There‚Äôs existing bad blood between our fanbases if that helps you make more sense of it.
Are NBA athletes hiring nephews to defend them in social media. Jesus Christ you sound like OBJ nephews that wouldn't shut up in the Giants and Browns subreddit. Trashing both orgs and claiming OBJ was the second coming of Christ. Jimmy Butler is not Jesus Christ either.  He is a loud mouth underachiever who blames everyone else when he ball hogs the team to a loss. Right now Pat Riley has his bitch balls in a vice but sooner or later he isn't gonna care how tight he gets squeezed if he feels he needs to call Rachel agian
"I don't understand why this keeps circulating? This makes me think his brother is a bad person. It doesn't make me think he'd get beat up by Jimmy Butler?? Like what is this supposed to be saying regarding ""toughness and badassery""?"
"Also, lost in a lot of the ""hold me back bro"" from the Heat last night is that if Jokic's brothers really are trained MMA fighters (which is my understanding), they'd likely be able to literally put to sleep nearly anyone they wanted to that isn't also a trained fighter.  People, especially competitive athletes, really underestimate the difference technical skill makes during a fight.  Even Durant's body guard wouldn't worry me nearly as much as like Kyle Lowry get knocked tf out on live TV. Could you imagine the NBA having to respond to Jimmy Butler getting put in hold by one of Jokic's brothers in the middle of a game?   There's no way those guys get within 100 yards of the arena for the next game in Miami..."
Jokic would be the dog shit out of Jimmy Butler and it‚Äôs not be said enough
They legit think Jimmy butler could take out Jokic. I‚Äôm speechless
Jokic would destroy Butler in a fight lol Jimmy don‚Äôt want that smoke.
"I'm a big fan of the way Jimmy Butler plays. Leaves it all on the floor, hustles, etc. But he's the poster boy for fake tough guy in the NBA."
"I never underestimated that fact, but you can't tell me Jokic isn't slightly out of shape. He literally gets into shape during the season and the year just started. If Jimmy gets in and gets out and keep moving he can tired Jokic out. Cause one of the big things about not getting knocked out is having more endurance and stamina, it isn't the only factor but it helps. Jokic can barely pay 32 mins without getting tired. Butler plays 35 mins and still goes hard. I'm not saying either one of them can win I'm just saying being big doesn't mean you just win. Fuck around get slam like what Barkley did to shaq"
An odd way to confirm they would have no problem murdering Jimmy Butler
"It‚Äôs honestly weird how much our sub hates Jimmy, I have a Butler flair on r/Timberwolves and anytime I bring up how good he was for us I get downvoted."
That Jimmy Butler is a real battleaxe
Trolling Jimmy Butler by insinuating he got pussy ü•¥ Lol good ones dumb ass wolves fans
I was at this game and those guys on the floor seats were just in front of me and were eally giving it to him. Jimmy Butler walked over to them and challenged them to say something to his face.   They didn't...  it was pretty awesome.   Great game
"The Pistons have won 3 NBA championships. Come back when the Timberwolves even make the playoffs again, remind me the last time they did? Oh that's right... your boy Jimmy Butler carried them there."
"It is not weird. I am pretty sure KAT calling him on that has nothing to do Butler having a relation with Rachel.  KAT felt betrayed after the whole ordeal. Because what Jimmy implied was that KAT was soft and lazy. That's why he wanted to leave. Imagine being KAT and just practicing at the court. Then your teammate comes in with his maniac mode on, does some stunt, then immediately talks to a journalist that he already arranged an interview with and drags your name in the mud (without directly mentioning you). Jimmy did this to get out of Wolves. What he did afterwards was not better, he made sure he did not have problems with Wiggins (no 3 name at the team at that point) which further implied KAT was the problem. But in reality contact was the issue, he wanted to get out because of that. Because at the time he would get the third best contract in the team as the best player. And I think he was sick of Thibs style.  Btw we don't really know what happened during that practice. I think most players did not even understand the point and they just took it easy. There are some rumors saying that it didn't go long, Jimmy put on a show and he left as soon as he made his point. If I were KAT, I would not push against JB when he just showed up in the practice and acting like a maniac. But then he turns on the news and sees JB gloating and explaining how he is the best and the rest of team sucks"
No this is a self dis. Jimmy Butler left and made himself a star. At the end of the day even if he never makes another basket a bunch of fans were making fun of him for getting laid.  A whole stadium full of virgin energy. lol.
Maybe im light headed after beating off after reading all the fanfic porn in the comments.     But I have a feeling that Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry are gonna want smoke after these comments. Those dudes dont play.
"&gt; Because that mutha***** is special. For real. Any time I text him, which we text plenty, FaceTime, phone calls. I always tell him, ‚ÄòContinue to show why you‚Äôre the best player in this league.‚Äô Because I saw it. I saw it. He can do everything. Like, legit, he can do everything. He works and I respect it. He works. And then he‚Äôs in the house. He‚Äôs with his girlfriend. That‚Äôs how you become the best player, you‚Äôve got to be obsessed with it. And he is. He is.      I think the bond just grew from there, because he would always ask questions. We‚Äôd always watch film together. And yeah, we‚Äôd be joking around a lot, too. But he wants to do right and when he does wrong and you tell him, he‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄòYeah, you‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre right.‚Äô I was like, you know what, you‚Äôre a real mutha*****. When somebody tells you you‚Äôre wrong, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòYeah.‚Äô And thinking about it, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOK, OK, I see what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äô If somebody tells me I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôm like, you could be right, or maybe I could‚Äôve handled that better. Like, ‚ÄòYeah, you‚Äôre probably right.‚Äô  [source](https://www.phillyvoice.com/jimmy-butler-joel-embiid-sixers-heat-nba-philadelphia-miami/)  But yes, go on with made up narratives"
What does that have to do with Jimmy Butler being garbage?
"Preach on.   The way that some of these American athlete rags to riches stories are glorified is pretty ridiculous. Then again, a lot of the people commenting are just vomiting up other peoples ideas. They get told by the TV or ESPN how hard Jimmy Butler had it growing up, and they just vomit that out. Not a lot of critical thinking going on here."
"Why don't you go to Honduras or  Rwanda and see what happens to kids who actually get kicked out?  ""How fucked the system is"" lol.  Wow, you mean there's an actual system, that gets paid for by other people, that tries to find solutions for you?  You mean there's no civil war involving child soldiers going on?    My guess is you've never lived outside of the US.    This ""woe is me pity me attitude"" and ""Jimmy Butler had it so tough"" narrative is absolutely embarrassing.  You should be embarrassed.    Spend 1 week in Rwanda.  You'll be booking your flight back by the end of 1 hour and crying to be back in ""this fucked up system."""
"1.  No, half that 'Chicago team' did not hate him.  2.  It was one incident that's the root cause of all the Bulls' locker room issues, and it was mostly spurred on by Wade.  Then, there was a counter-jerk because Rondo went to the public to trash on Wade and Butler.  3.  The players that Jimmy ""called out"" are no longer in the NBA.  They were that bad.    4.  I'd imagine it were very few Bulls fans that came over to your sub, if any at all.  Most of us hated the trade.  We were lost and floundering as a franchise 4 fucking years after Butler left, and only this year gained competency."

Lol people who dine off this dumb speculative drama are much softer than Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy ""HeAt cultUrE I wake up for 4 am workouts gonna go whine to Rachel Nichols all about that smoke"" Butler"
Fake tough guy Jimmy Butler
Seriously. My wife only knows who Jimmy Butler is because she listened to me talk about his huge cock every game for three weeks.
"This is not true regarding the max. We offered him the most money we legally could, and told him and his representatives we fully understand if he doesn‚Äôt accept and will be offering him the full five year max the following offseason. We also couldn‚Äôt have even traded Wiggins and offered him the max, because we still have to take back salary even after what likely wouldn‚Äôt have gutted the team and assets.   Not saying Jimmy was wrong to leave. I‚Äôm not a salty Timberwolves fan and still like Butler (though really hated how he went out). This was an excuse on Jimmy‚Äôs part, and if he truly believes this then he is actually not a smart person who understands how his own leagues cap works.  But this is just not accurate and I honestly can‚Äôt believe most people think this."
Jimmy Butler is such a little bitch for that whole saga.  The fact the r/nba was fan girling over every moment at the time shows the maturity level of this sub.
Proof? Says here it was taken outside of the Nuggets locker room: www.si.com/nba/2021/11/09/jimmy-butler-challenges-nuggets-bench-nikola-jokic-foul-video
People like you say things like that and it's funny cuz it's wrong.   [We offered the max we could at the time knowing he'd decline BECAUSE we could offer a lot more the following season if he wanted to re-sign.] (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jimmy-butler-rejects-wolves-four-year-110-million-extension-offer-owner-says/amp/)
They declined the Rockets' offer of 4 first round picks for him 2 weeks before taking Roco Saric and a 2nd. But keep blaming Jimmy Butler for the Wolves' incompetence.
"That doesn't fucking matter.  Jimmy was on our team for barely over one season. He started drama right after we lost in the playoffs by disappearing off the radar and not doing any of his required exit interviews with the team.  Are we supposed to bow down to his greatness for that one season? Like he was the only one worth a damn on that team? Lol  You guys are idiots.  And Simmons doesn't hold the Sixers back. Y'all are fucking morons. Simmons is a good player (over paid maybe, but still good) on a roster that's not built for his skills since Embiid does a lot of the same stuff Simmons does and they both can't clog the paint at the same time. That's the fault of their GM.   Is Simmons a bitch for doing what he's doing? Yes.  Is Butler a bitch for doing what he did? Yes."
&gt;Jimmy Butler and the heat have a reputation for wanting to ‚Äúfight‚Äù other teams.  Lmaoo flair checks out
What are the chances Minnesota wins this 5th game if its not against Jimmy Butler?
The whole mess started because Jimmy Butler was fully willing to re-sign on a max and the Wolves wouldn't offer him one. He literally pressured the org into getting a trade return for him instead of having him leave for free in the offseason lol.
Why didn't Jimmy Butler think to organize the bracket better so they wouldn't face the eventual champs in the 2nd round. What a mistake
*THE* Jimmy Butler??
Fucking Jimmy Butler wants to ‚Äúfight‚Äù everyone over shoves
So he's a whiny bitch with millions of dollars? Got it.  Fuck Jimmy Butler. üëç
Butler pressed his palm against Ant‚Äôs abs‚Ä¶  ‚Äú*Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶*‚Äù whispered Ant  ‚ÄúBut I have to. Take my culture.‚Äù Jimmy said in a low growl.  **BEEEEEEEEEEEP**  ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a technical on Butler! I don‚Äôt know what he was thinking!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that?‚Äù muttered Rachel Nichols as she stared dumbfounded.
It‚Äôs weird to me how the Lakers are below the Wolves in the standings and got blown out by them but you still tryna talk shit for Jimmy Butler
The Jimmy Butler will still make the playoffs.
"As a fan of winning basketball, it warms my heart to see the Wolves actually utilize talent and to win. As a Heat fan, it hurts to see my squad not show up. As a Jimmy Butler fan, I HOPE AN ASTEROID BLOWS THE WHOLE STATE OF MINNESOTA OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND ALL YOUR HACK BASKETBALL PLAYERS WITH IT."
‚ÄúTough Guy‚Äù‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Jimmy Butler strikes again.
This isn‚Äôt even true butler tried to get the ball from Edwards edwards didn‚Äôt like it softly pushed jimmy and then they just stared
jimmy butler likes to look tough and act a like a bitch
Jimmy Butler has to be the biggest fake tough guy in the league right now. Dude always acts like he‚Äôs gonna do something like every couple games and doesn‚Äôt do shit ever.
"Butler is great but he‚Äôs been really cringeworthy this year, drama queen crybaby. You have a contending elite team now play some basketball and stop crying. Maybe he thinks he‚Äôs an A lost star now, sorry Jimmy but you do have legit weaknesses"

You love to see it. young Wolves were gunning for Jimmy Butler and his squad all night long.. Anthony Edwards is all heart!
"I love Jimmy, but food for Ant for standing up after Jimmy snatched the ball. Probably earned a lot of players respect including Butler"
Anyone getting a little sick of Jimmy Butler?
Fuck Jimmy Butler
Say what you will about Jimmy Butler but he still sells out the Target Center
"""Jimmy Butler is resting as a 'precaution' against general soreness""  Which is even funnier than just resting for general soreness.  If anyone hasn't seen the video of our broadcasters just losing their shit over this, I highly recommend a watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGOjLuEvd4)."
Jimmy butler a bitch lol
Soon after that Jimmy Butler got injured and the Eolces went about .500 the rest of the year. They were a great underrated team i
Fuck Jimmy Butler and fuck the city of Miami. Suck my freezing balls you cocaine losers. Palm trees fucking suck
"&gt;They maxed wiggins, who was playing like shit, over Butler, who brought them to the playoffs.  Don't spout shit when you think you know shit and are just blatantly wrong.   [They traded for Jimmy in June of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2646262-jimmy-butler-traded-to-timberwolves-for-zach-lavine-kris-dunn-no-7-pick.amp.html)  [They agreed to max Wiggins in October of 2017.](https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2722896-andrew-wiggins-timberwolves-agree-to-5-year-148-million-contract-extension.amp.html)  [They offered Butler the max the next summer of 2018. They knew he was gonna turn it down cuz he could make more from us the following summer if he re-signed.] (https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jimmy-butler-rejects-wolves-four-year-110-million-extension-offer-owner-says/amp/)  So. Look at the timeline. Wolves maxed Wiggins Oct. 11, 2017 and the season started October 17. Jimmy hadn't even played a SINGLE minute in a Wolves uniform when they maxed Wiggins, guy.  Get your facts straight."
AYO REAL TALK IM FROM MINNESOTA AND YOU KNOW WHAT? JIMMY BUTLERS A FUCKIN BITCH! FUCK JIMMY BUTLER!
The Jimmy Butler
"Warriors fans, is the man correct? I've seen Kuminga and always got Jimmy Butler vibes. a Gritty 2 way player who will be a defense first guy and then his offense will catch up"
Tatum is smooth like T Mac. Makes it look effortless. He‚Äôs not a super physically emotive person like Jimmy Butler.   He definitely misses too many Kobe style high difficulty jump shots.
 &gt;Context: Jimmy Butler and the Heat have a reputation of wanting to ‚Äúfight‚Äù other teams.    I mean do they even? Says who lol?
Kawhi and Jimmy Butler come to mind
Jimmy Butler unlocked a beast tonight just not for his own team
THE Jimmy Butler
"No, you‚Äôre just a salty sore loser crying on the Internet because you‚Äôve deluded yourself into thinking you can win a championship with Jimmy Butler as your best player. It‚Äôs okay, you guys will flame out in the second round this year and keep biding your time. Maybe when Jimmy is 40 he‚Äôll put you guys over the top!"
@jimmy butler again
"Hey r/heat fans, it‚Äôs me again. I‚Äôm enjoying my free air conditioning while you dumb bitches always have sand in your vagina. Fuck Miami, fuck palm trees, and fuck Jimmy Butler."
"Oh, you mean two places that don‚Äôt take bets on the actual races and make money? Wow, they must know more than vegas. Can‚Äôt believe vegas even stays in business how bad their oddsmaking system is. Crazy stuff. Sorry Jimmy can‚Äôt beat the wolves since leaving them :/ oh and just for kicks, the fact that bbref has Jimmy ranked above KD right now shows me it‚Äôs absolutely laughable. I‚Äôd bet there‚Äôs a higher chance LeBron takes home MVP than Butler. Honestly, I‚Äôd throw money on it right now with you that LeBron gets more MVP votes than Butler."
Jimmy butler in shambles
"We offered him literally the most we could without trading pretty much everyone else on our team so we could max him which would then place us with 3 max contract players on our team. By this point by the way Jimmy had already been leaking stories about his unhappiness with the Wolves, he also didn‚Äôt fly back with the rest of the team to Minny after our playoff loss and refused to participate in the standard end of season medical exam.   The trade with the Heat broke down because for once in his life Thibs was smart and decided Kelly Olynyk, Josh Richardson, and a 1st wasn‚Äôt enough. Jimmy was fair to be pissed off, but publicly humiliating the Wolves wasn‚Äôt a professional way to handle it.   Wolves fans can admit the organization shares some of the blame, but the fact you guys think Jimmy was completely in the right is hilarious. The dudes forced his way out of 2 teams now and is on his 4th team since becoming a star, maybe, JUST maybe, he‚Äôs a bit hard to please. Regardless this is a pointless argument, I don‚Äôt like Jimmy Butler that much, it‚Äôs nice to beat a guy who trashed your team, if you are that upset about it then oh well. Gg tonight"
We‚Äôve won five in a row and been fine. I just love trolling douchey entitled heat fans and sissy fake tough guy Jimmy Butler. Hold this L clown we own you
"That‚Äôs a load man. Wade won Finals MVP his 3rd year in the league. Either he‚Äôs competing or he‚Äôs not. He outplayed Jimmy tonight for sure but he‚Äôs no where near his level. I get Wolves fans are excited after that win but Butler is outplaying him across the board this season and is a top 5 mvp candidate.  Ant will definitely be a star, but don‚Äôt make excuses for him by saying he‚Äôs only a sophomore, he lead the team tonight."
"I think the commenter means heat fans will be generally sore after the loss since the Heat lost.  Also we don't hate the heat, we just really fucking hate Jimmy Butler."
"Jimmy ""I've never even finished in the top in scoring for any given season and still for the nickname 'Buckets'"" Butler"
"Jimmy Butler is definition of a ‚Äúfake rich white girl‚Äù. Tired of of these gullible annoying cringe fanboys Defending him and thinking he is tough. How is he tough when he flops the same as Trae Young.  I‚Äôm sick of people say their tough and act like scums. Don‚Äôt want to be a baby but truth is their bullies and they deserve to be put in their place.  Real tough Guys were Rodman, Oakley, Lambert, and Artest. They never screamed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tough‚Äù like a cringe Instagram model like Butler did to a player last year LMAO.  I‚Äôve never seen Butler be real tough other than talk shit and act annoying. Fuck Butler fuckbois and keep defending what the golden angel did to the Wolves when he disgracefully disrespect the organization but guys like KAT and Wiggins.  The fucker still hasn‚Äôt apologized btw which shows he is a grade A shitty scum. Wish Artest and Lambieer were playing in today‚Äôs league to put him in his place."
"Player A: 25/5/6 on 63% TS  Player B: 23/6/5 on 58% TS   Player A is Jimmy Butler and Player B is LeBron  James.   Ignoring that LeBron is like 37 and named LeBron James, do you think Jimmy Butler is better than Curry, Durant and Giannis this season? Because he's objectively better than LeBron James."
Three straight play off appearances and you can‚Äôt even beat the Timberwolves? How does it feel to know we own Jimmy Butler every time we play him?
For noted tough guy jimmy butler he‚Äôs really reaching low here
The Jimmy Butler
Fuck Jimmy Butler.
I didn‚Äôt see the game thread but I wouldn‚Äôt know why either. However I know that there isn‚Äôt any animosity against the wolves unless we play them and I imagine it‚Äôs all to do with the Jimmy Butler situation. I can understand the wolves disliking the heat because of that.
"Just look at this thread. Look at the amount of wolves flairs screaming fuck Jimmy Butler, and look how many heat fans are congratulating ant. We‚Äôre aight lmao"
Throw in one Jimmy Butler push and lived to tell the tale
We need to be in the East or whichever division Jimmy Butler is on cause I haven't felt that much intensity in a Wolves game in a long time.
"I wrote the Miami Heat initially but Jimmy Butler sounded better in the title and forgot to delete the ""the"".  Oops :P"
And EMBARRASSED Jimmy Butler. Hilarious how Jimmy left the game in a heart beat with his head down
The Jimmy Butler
Tough guy Jimmy Butler would *never*
"FUCK JIMMY ""ANTHONY EDWARDS WANNABE"" BUTLER  FUCK THE HEAT  LET'S GO BABY"
Ant was the Phoenix that arose from the ashes Jimmy Butler left behind.
The Jimmy Butler
FUCK JIMMY BUTLER
Fucking Jimmy Butler and GB over in the same week it too much for my sadistic heart.
AYO JIMMY BUTLER FUCKING SUCKS
Fuck Jimmy Butler
Jimmy butler is the guy who thinks he had it worse then anyone else and he had a tough life but always acts like everyone else was born with a silver spoon.
Big tough guy Jimmy Butler
"As expected, Anthony Edwards pushing Jimmy Butler for no reason is good according to r/nba"
"Fuck Jommy Butler for sure, but idc Jimmy Butler at the end of the day. Fun villain and nice to play him, but would MUCH rather see Embiid in a series"
"This game is an example of why the NBA needs to get rid of conferences. Imagine Miami vs. Minnesota in the first or second round of the playoffs. It would be a great series.   Minnesota probably won't be able to make the finals before Jimmy Butler gets old , so we will never see them match upin the playoffs."
"s/o to when I was downvoted for saying Lowry wouldn't be a 17 &amp; 7 player this year.   &gt;he averaged 17 &amp; 7 for a 27 win team. He will be turning 36 years old this season and all of his advanced stats painted him as a pretty average player last season. He's not washed in the sense that he's useless, but folks expecting him to be an all star caliber guy are in for a surprise. I think he probably averages \~11 &amp; 6 this year.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;I just don't see him getting the minutes. He averaged 17 ppg in 34 mpg last year. He will be turning 36 years old and competing for minutes with Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Victor Oladipo and then a slew of rotation guards.   Last year Butler played 34 mpg, Oladipo was at 28 mpg (recovering from injury so possibly expect an increase in mpg this year), Herro averaged around 31 mpg, and Vincent and Strus were around 13 mpg each in bench roles. Assuming he fills the Goran Dragic role (26 mpg) I'd be shocked if he averaged 15+ ppg. Even if he got more mpg, Miami has a lot of scoring options, I just don't see Lowry needing to score all that much.   Last year only 2 players averaged 15+ ppg at age 35+, they were LeBron James and Chris Paul. Lowry is great but he's obviously a tier or two below LeBron and Paul. Paul played 32 mpg last year and was also an All Star and All NBA 2nd team the past two years. Lowry as good as he is, is still a ways behind Chris Paul.  Folks were saying I was a hater for suggesting he'd average &lt; 15 ppg lmao"
"Jimmy Butler ""only because"" he's significantly better than both Tatum and Brown? Lol ok, thanks for your input."
"Chris Paul, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, and Russell Westbrook are ahead of him in my book as far as deserving and honestly there‚Äôs probably more that i‚Äôm not thinking of or am on the fence about. Beal is a stud though and he deserves more success"
"Overall count doesn't matter. We got savaged in the last 2 minutes, but don't misrepresent like there weren't legitimate fouls against the Heat, Jimmy Butler scores all his points by getting wrapped on drives while the Jays are still shying away from contact in the paint."
I mean Butler got angry because of Thibs. He asked for a trade after our playoff loss and Thibs denied him and figured he could fix the situation except he couldn't then Jimmy had a temper tantrum the next year because that's the only way they would move him. Thibs is a good coach but not a good Executive.
"If you think basketball is Herro trying to rip Grant to the ground and Dragic hitting Tatum in the face while Jimmy Butler falls to the ground crying, I feel deeply sorry for your parents"
"Cause 80% of the people in this sub have no idea about basketball, they are just here for the hype, the memes and covid.  Collective thinking is a thing, people refuse to think for themselves and just follow narratives.   Jimmy ""cancer' Butler  Tom ""washed"" Thibodeau"
"The Timberwolves franchise definitely has a problem when Jimmy Butler is the 2nd best player in franchise history after playing there for one year before leading an insurrection against the organization.  KAT is an easy target here, but the common denominator is Glen Taylor. They were a bottom feeder longer before KAT got there."
Foul on hjaylen brown for the crime of defending jimmy butler.   Someone should call The Hague. Free throws aren‚Äôt enough
Jimmy butler gets every call
Interesting question.  I see Brown as a Jimmy Butler type.  Not the most talented but with an insatiable desire to win.  Ben Simmons has all the talent in the world with some amazing physical gifts but can't seem to put it all together.  The desire doesn't seem to be there and I'm not sure if that's because he's not all that into Philly or what.   I still think Simmons will be regarded as the better player even if Brown has the better stats.
I asked some friends last year and we were split.  Just curious.. Would you guys rather have Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum?  I don't think there's a wrong answer.
Let‚Äôs see what a Miami Heat team would do without Jimmy Butler before I say Bam.
"Yea, I am at a loss of why they offered Harris full max and not jimmy butler when they let go of convingtonw for him!  Outside of that these guys seem totally committed to bringing a ring.  Goes to show that these often faceless unaccountable guys can quietly dismantle a cities hopes while taking max profit from us. They are far more replaceable then the star talent and I‚Äôm on the team of #tradetillmaninstead in Houston thus so   Paying Daryl more then rockets right after and telling China and Tillman you can go eat rocks out em over the top and love Seth curry add on!"
"Mitchell, Draymond, Jrue, CJ, Butler (though Jimmy is still one of my favorites)"
"Iggy always overperforms in the playoffs since 2015, that's what old vets like him do usually. Crowder TS isn't even that wild of an aberration especially considering lack of fans. Butler is a master at baiting fouls, how does that differ from his regular season numbers? I genuinely don't know and would like to. And Jimmy is a career 33% shooter from three as well if you want to use career numbers. And he has a career 35% in the playoffs so that kind of kills your logic there a little bit."
"I think it‚Äôs because of who Miami is made up of.  Jimmy Butler who a lot of teams passed on in the trade market despite him being sold for peanuts. Even a contender in the East (Philly) said no to him.  Bam and Herro who went in the late lottery, meaning plenty of teams had the opportunity to take them.  It‚Äôs a classic case of, ‚ÄúNo, the children must be wrong.‚Äù"
The best player in a series doesn‚Äôt score just 1 point. This isn‚Äôt jimmy butler vs the 3rd stringers
That‚Äôs true Jimmy Butler is the best player in the league
"The point you are missing is that Draymond has a bigger impact on the Warriors and Ben would have a bigger impact on the Sixers. Which player is worth more on an open market? Ben. He's 25. Would the Dubs trade Dray for Ben? Sure. He's 25. But for this year, and this team, Draymond is more important to winning than Ben is.  Also, Ben really has never shown up in the playoffs. Jimmy Butler was the ballhandler in their best postseason and Ben was in the dunker spot not doing a thing and not being particularly effective on defense either. Draymond has done it in the Finals. This matters. A lot. Regular season NBA don't mean shit.  You'll find that most discussions about sports end up coming down to ""Well that's just your opinion man!"" Particularly when people are fans, which in the age of social media just means ""abandoning all critical and self-reflective thought about the thing I am a fan of"".   I remember years ago I was cringing the Hornets for the Batum max and the Hornets sub was telling me he was a going to be an All-Star and they were darkhorse Finals contenders.    So you aren't an outkast, you're just a Philly fan. You're like the people on the National Mall right now attempting a coup because they don't know anyone who voted for Biden and their Facebook just shows them what they already think.  EDIT: Take some upvotes, I appreciate your passion and your engagement."
1. Steph 2. Harden 3. Dame 4. Doncic 5. Trae 6. LeBron 7. Towns 8. Kawhi 9. CP3 10. Beal 11. Giannis 12. Booker 13. Kemba 14. Jokic 15. Jimmy Butler
"Can you prove he‚Äôs not a good defender? If you check the numbers (blocks, steals, advanced metrics) against wings that have recently been on All Defense teams he stacks up very well with them. He‚Äôs a small notch below Kawhi, on par with PG and RoCo, and a notch above Jimmy Butler."
"I'm a Jimmy Butler fan, and honestly, after hearing the Timberwolves, 76ers, and Heat commentators over the years, no one compares to Stacey King.  I mean, it's not even close."
Jimmy Butler in the 90‚Äôs would be cool  Mark Price in today‚Äôs era would be great imo
"Those numbers are pretty crazy is the wild part of it,  just not by his standards.  How many dudes in the league can pull that on cruise control on any given night?  Luka?  Jokic?  Maybe Jimmy Butler if he's playing good?  There's not just many that do everything he does at that type of level, all the time without considering age, let alone with that as a factor.  A lot of people hate on, or disagree with him as a person or player, but from a purely basketball perspective its a privilege to watch him play.  I'm not his biggest fan,  but this type of player comes along once a generation.....maybe.    Often the ones slated to be the next LeBron James, are very good but lack something to their game.  The biggest pull for LeBron in my opinion, is setting IQ and everything aside the dude can do literally everything on the floor at a very high level."
I have no proof of this but at the time I thought the timberwolves should have traded Wiggins for butler instead of Lavine. He was such a better shooter. Lavine and Towns playing off of a Jimmy would‚Äôve been nasty.
"Because the father nonsense was projected on him by the fans. Weirdly so.   He was entirely incompetent and the team visibly quit on him before last season even started. All it took was Jimmy Butler coming in and being like, wow, this dude sucks.   Seven weeks and a new coach and now we have Embiid running baseline to baseline and actually enjoying life again.   It's not coincidence."
"Embiid, Jokic, Vuc, LeBron, Jimmy Butler, Sabonis (although I‚Äôm noticing it more this year than previously), Giannis (He doesn‚Äôt have any moves nor does he have a jumper but like Dwight he‚Äôs impossible to stop in the post due to athletic ability and finishing around the rim)."
"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. AD took a gigantic dump on the Nuggets while Jokic couldn't even bother to run up the floor to guard washed up dwight at times during that series.   AD deterred about 900 jimmy butler drives during the finals.   Yea, I'll take the guy who is one of the best rim protectors in the league and good at everything else to boot. Yea, Jokic is a better passer, but it's not like AD is a bad passer himself. AD is a super unselfish player who happens to be one of the best scorers and defenders in the league. Meanwhile, the nuggets nearly got bounced by the jazz because Jokic couldn't guard a pick and roll.   As much as I love Jokic and enjoy his playstyle, his glaring defensive weakness is gets overlooked more than it should. He plays the most important defensive position on the court and he sucks at it."
"Jokic, Tony Parker, Kawhi, Ingram, Jimmy Butler"
Not for Jimmy Butler. Business only
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler was picked at 30 and had no real NBA caliber offensive skills when drafted.
Jimmy Butler the goat. Took 2 games off lebron and AD despite all the injuries to his teammates
"Nah,  this is that Jimmy Butler gw bucket. Same spot."
"Hard not to be hopeful. This is the best the roster has looked since the Jimmy Butler, JJ reddick team a couple seasons ago that almost made it to the finals."
"&gt;What moments in NBA history do you feel are under appreciated,  &gt;For me it‚Äôs Jimmy Butler in the 2020 NBA finals  lol what?"
"like they swept the undermanned heat, with jimmy fucking butler as their leader, right? like they swept that sorry ass no center having rockets team last year, right? like they swept the fighting for an 8th seed blazers, right? the lakers ain‚Äôt impervious to getting bounced"
Jimmy Butler is incredibly overrated. His teammates can all score yet all I hear about is how he carried the Heat. Yeah his finals run was impressive but before that he would disappear in the playoffs and got carried by his teammates
"Jaylen and Tatum are good, not better than OG Simmons is better on guards not on power wings PG on ball has slept Lebron hasnt guarded a good wing full time in a playoff series since Jimmy Butler in 2015 AD is better"
"Cleveland had a once in a generation player born in a neighboring city in their market.  Oakland is completely misleading considering they included the Silicon Valley market. Players there have access to unrivaled financial opportunities. They are definitely a glamour market. GSWwas considered small market but their rise paralleled the rise in their market.  Detroit is a good example, but that‚Äôs not a team that easily duplicable.  Dallas is an attractive market in a growing state with no state income tax. I don‚Äôt consider them a small or non-glamour market. And they also had the rate foreign players who cared more about loyalty than playing in a flashy market or chasing ‚Äòchips.  Boston has history that players respect. They‚Äôre like Green Bay, it‚Äôs not comparable. They‚Äôve been getting free agents a lot lately.  Teams like Cleveland, Indiana, Minneapolis, and others have to basically hope they can tank for years and then hit on a once in a generation talent. American players don‚Äôt seem interested in playing in non-glamour markets. It‚Äôs not the size, it‚Äôs the allure and flash. Miami has gravity because of the other stuff that comes with living there, not its size.  The NBA blows right now if you‚Äôre a Pacers, Cavs, T‚ÄôWolves, Grizz, Hornets, or Pistons fan **AND** want to win a championship. There‚Äôs other teams I‚Äôm forgetting.  Unless you get lucky with a Giannis or a legendary player is born near your city, what hope do you have. Jimmy Butler wasn‚Äôt going to Indiana. You better hope your draft a hall of fans player who is foreign or doesn‚Äôt care about American city glamour.  Hell, Toronto **WON** a championship and couldn‚Äôt keep their star. And they‚Äôre a huge city.  Player empowerment sucks for fans."
"I think they actually will do something about that 'stopping so the defender runs into you' thing that he's been doing. Similar to how they made kicking your leg out on a jump shot an offensive foul a few years ago.  Also, i feel like people need to realize the difference between foul baiting and flopping. What Trae is doing is annoying, but it's not flopping. He's exploiting the rules to make defenders foul him whereas flopping would just be acting like he got fouled when the defender didn't even make any contact. Guys like Lowry, Smart, Dillon Brooks, Blake Griffin, etc are the worst floppers in the league. Trae, Harden, Jimmy Butler, etc are the worst foul baiters in the league, but there's a big difference in that the latter are actually drawing fouls even if they're exploiting the rules to do so."
"Look at that scrub only working out 6 days a week.  Jimmy Butler would work 8 or 9 days, at worst."
"""That motherfucker picks up full court!""- Jimmy Butler"
"&gt; It is said he pulled a ""Jimmy Butler"" and beat the upperclassmen starters w/ a bunch of 3rd stringer freshmen as a freshman,  As a Bruin, I can confirm that this isn't just a rumor, it's pretty well known fact. As soon as Alcindor got to UCLA, he was the best player at the school. He was just forced to play on the freshman team."
"It is said he pulled a ""Jimmy Butler"" and beat the upperclassmen starters w/ a bunch of 3rd stringer freshmen as a freshman, though he did not scream ""You fucking need me!"""
"?  The argument was team success or personal success for a player that did and didn‚Äôt have another top player. It literally had nothing to do with the playoffs. All you had to do was scroll up to not put your foot in your own mouth lol.   And even if, Giannis‚Äô competition in the playoffs was Jimmy Butler, and the heat won. Then Lebron beat the heat. So, I guess your too shy to say you agree?  Would you like to twist your own words for a third time? You might finally spin in the right direction"
"how are they getting superstars without trading tatum or brown? lmao.  The biggest misconception in basketball is that Ainge never pulls the trigger. He only pulls the trigger on the right deals.  When people mention ""He didn't trade for jimmy butler or paul george!"" they would have been trading the jaylen AND Tatum picks - which would have been TERRRRRRIBLE trades. The only somewhat questionable non-trade is Kawi but even that would have been Jaylen for 1 year of Kawhi, which very likely wouldn't have worked."
"TJ, that's my fuckin' dude. Pure hustle.          I think it was Jimmy Butler (back when he was still on Chicago or Minny, can't remember) who was like ""who the fuck is this dude full-court pressing all the time? Fuck off!"" lmao"
"Dude, the fan base is totally there. It‚Äôs just that we suck astronomically hard. One playoff appearance in 15 years doesn‚Äôt exactly engender fan support. In 2018 when we had Jimmy Butler, the Target Center was rocking. If a competent, sustainable team is built, the fans will be there."
"This narrative needs to stop. He was carrying incredibly bad teams, dumpster fires. In the middle of the season after a terrible loss in the post game locker room he said things like we need to play like we want to win and that you need to be pissed when you lose. He, as he has always done, said the team as a whole needs to play better and work.   He didn't call out anyone and he included himself in all the talk. It was Wade that said me and Jimmy are great it's everyone else that needs to change and so Butler gets caught up in that.   The Bulls were over Butler at that point and were looking to move him so once they decide they're done with a player the hit pieces and rumors start coming out. From that point he became a terrible leader and all the young guys hated him, when not long before all the young guys looked up to him and loved him. They pulled the same nonsense when they wanted to move Rose. Reports started coming out that only the old players that were past their primes liked Rose and all the young guys saw Jimmy as the leader and Jimmy was a great mentor.   The things he says now whenever the Heat win or lose...he's been saying since he became a go to guy for his teams...even with the Bulls."
"I think he means Doncic‚Äôs body language, it appears slower and more methodical than his contemporary superstars. Think of the energy and strength that is clearly visible in stars like Jimmy Butler, and compare that to Lukas laid back movements that he‚Äôs no doubt developed by being one of the most skilled players in whatever league he‚Äôs played in. I would guess that as his game and his body develop he‚Äôll appear more visually explosive and athletic because he literally will be."
"The higher free throws back then we‚Äôre a result of way less 3 point attempts which players are a lot less likely to be fouled on and a greater usage of the big man.   For a lot of GMs/coaches the ideal team in the modern NBA is essentially to have one supreme ball handler that dominates the court and in order to score most of these guys really on jacking 3s or driving and fishing for contact.   I‚Äôm not saying nobody has ever BS‚Äôd the system, just that it‚Äôs no unbelievably wide spread and the calls now are certainly worse than they were before. It‚Äôs so bad that these dudes are not even trying to finish, just look Jimmy Butler last year on some of his drives. Dudes In the 80s/90s may have gotten some shit calls in their favor, but they played with the intention of scoring on all their drives"
The only timeline is one where they kept Jimmy Butler and Thibs
"Not many rooks, even guys who stay 4 years in college, have the skill to come in and make above replacement level impact on a winning / contending team. Most talented guys that struggled their frosh season make their leap 2nd season and enter draft then. PP improved a bit as a soph then his numbers and efficiency actually regressed a junior before blowing up as a senior.  4 year guys becoming good role players in general let alone as a rook are even rarer than 2 year guys... since Lillard key names are:  Draymond Green, CJ McCollum, JJ Reddick, Jeremy Lin, Larry Nance Jr, Buddy Hield, Malcolm Brogdon, Denzel Valentine, all 3 Plumlee Brothers 2 of the Zeller brothers (not Cody) Taj Gibson   And technically Jimmy Butler. Probably forgetting a few but none better than Hield/Brogdon. That's clearly much less than 2nd year guys."
"This is exactly how Jimmy Butler plays lmao there was a point where he was head and shoulders above even Harden in FTA, i think it was the bubble. Dude did the same crap."
Well my dad is Jimmy Butler. And he definitely ain't polite.

"Dellavedova shut Curry/Warriors down in the 2015 Finals    &gt; Stephen Curry missed an NBA Finals-record 13 3-point field goals (courtesy of Elias Sports Bureau) in Game 2, in large part thanks to Dellavedova's defense. Curry was 0-for-8 when guarded by Dellavedova on Sunday, including 0-for-5 from 3-point range, his worst shooting performance against a defender in any game this postseason. - [source](https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F0608%2FFSNBAFINALSDellavedovadefense.jpg&amp;w=570&amp;format=jpg)   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Overall, Dellavedova held the Warriors to 3-for-15 shooting, including 0-for-6 from 3-point range, and forced six turnovers as a primary defender in Game 2. That's the most turnovers forced by a Cavaliers player in a game this postseason, and only Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler and Khris Middleton have forced more turnovers as the primary defender in any game this postseason.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Warriors shot 1-for-6 from the field and turned the ball over three times with Dellavedova as the primary defender; the Warriors shot 8-for-18 and turned it over once when guarded by anyone else in the half court over that same span.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt; Although this number is expected to be high since he was guarding Curry, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that Dellavedova contested 11 shots in Game 2, more than any other Cavaliers player."
"The Bulls from 2010-2012 had a couple ultra talented teams as well.        MVP Rose, prime Joakim Noah, Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer, with Korver and Taj off the bench. Then they added Jimmy Butler and Rip Hamilton the following year. I always liked those teams."
Thibbs famously played young Jimmy over Tony Snell despite GarPax threatening to fire him if Snell wasn't a starter. Butler had just bet on himself so the Bulls front office didn't want him to breakout yet in order to have him commit long term for less money.
"Jimmy dropped 40 in a finals game with no 3s, and playoffs are harder to score in, against a elite defensive team and butler isnt even a scorer. Im sure someone like westbrook or giannis could do it."
"I'm not Jimmy Butler, but i'll call it out a loser mentality"
Did kg help them win that series or Jimmy butler? It has to be one of them
"lmfao losing finals as an arugment is so bad, Jimmy Butler had his career highlight of making it to finals and Lebron has done that 8 times in a row and backpacked some mediocore rosters."
Jimmy Butler currently leads the league with Selena Gomez
"They said Giannis was better, he stayed silent. They said Harden was better, he stayed silent. They said Jimmy Butler was better, he started to pay attention. They said damian lillard was better....That man popped off on god LMAO.  r/NBA can suck its analytics, steph curry the face of the nba after bron since 2014, and don't ya'll forget."
It's him or Jimmy Butler.
"Doncic is way above PG, and Jimmy Butler is as well"
Isn't he the Sixers fan that thought Jimmy Butler sucked and wanted the Sixers to re-sign Tobias Harris instead of Butler. (Even though they could re-sign both).
"I know appreciating effort is important, but this is just not good analysis.  Way too positive on offense. His passes were a bit late quite a few times this game and defenders were often able to recover on 3 point shooters because of it. His drives sometimes lacked force against lighter defenders, that he could have taken to the rim. Still a good-ish game on offense, but not that positive.  On defense this is a lot of bad analysis.   All ""bad"" box out examples are plain wrong. Why should Doncic box out when he is the only player close enought to get the rebound? Nobody boxes out a player that is not in body contact. Doncic cannot take two steps back just to uselessly box out Jimmy Butler and the ball hits the ground for no good reason, because nobody is in rebounding position. If Butler were to try to get the rebound from behind it is on the teammates to call it, not for Doncic to take the eyes of the ball, which is an absolute no-no for the designated rebounder. The rebounders ""eyes"" for opposing players is his own body, so if he feels body contact he uses his whole body to stay infront.  The first example for his defense is pretty much the only time where it was really bad, the other times were at worst lack of initiative, but staying in the defensive scheme.   The example Def #11 of not covering a moving opposing player is actually zone defense, he absolutely has to stay near the basket. The Bradley 3 at the end is correctly played by Doncic, he cannot let Dragic get a 1 on 1 to the basket against Kleber with a wide open corner 3 for Duncan Robinson on the right side. He and Kleber were the only Mavs in good position on that transition defense, the rest were just too slow to cover Bradley and Robinson."
My favourite player-fan interaction was Jimmy Butler-Giannis in the conference semis

Just ask James ‚ÄúLiterally Jimmy‚Äù Butler.
"Right, remember the Jimmy Butler vs TJ Warren beef last year? it fizzled out because months passed between games. Imagine if they played 3 times in a week"
Imo Lowry isn't going put us over the edge in going for the chip. He's also a 34 year old expiring contract so it's not even certain that we get to keep him and singing a 34 year old to another contract is also a bit risky ngl. We have given up dudes for Jimmy butler who didn't resign and it hurt like hell and I would rather not have the same thing happen again.
"Jimmy butler literaly got traded for Dario saric and Robert convington... lol, because of the way he acted on the way out. I get harden has at least one more year on contract but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they didn‚Äôt get that much for him"
Aye bruh this sub thinks Tobias Harris is better than Jimmy Butler right now it‚Äôs so reactionary over here üòÇ
"It should say something that Jimmy Butler, who has an amazing work ethic, loved Thibs. While soft ass KAT hated Butler and Thibs."
I mean he was playing Jimmy Butler like 42 minutes a game for no reason
"How many more random players are people gonna be link to us?People literally make these threads just to dump on the Celtics.   Threads made just to dump on Celtics/Danny Tracker:  Should've traded for:  ~~Paul George~~  ~~Jimmy Butler~~  ~~Anthony Davis~~  ~~Kawhi Leonard~~  ~~James Harden~~  Should've drafted:  ~~Collin Sexton~~  Yes, instead of trading an injured IT &amp; the no.8 pick for Kyrie, we should've kept it. Sub would still dump on us for hoarding assets  Or Imagine if we did trade for Kawhi or AD as basically 1 year rentals &amp; didn't win a thing. Sub would absolutely sh*t on Danny Ainge for trading JB   And absolutely no one on here would praise us for going for it"
Just because the math doesn't have the outcome you want it too doesn't mean it's a bad stat.  It strictly measures how many points you are getting for the number of shots you are taking.  Its the same reason why 3 pt are weighted more heavily as well.  Obviously there's more to look at.  But in your example objectively yes the guy who gets to the line more and is good enough at the line is scoring as efficiently.  Take for example Jimmy butler.  Had 20(19.9) pt per game last year with an efg of .474 but a ts of .585.  No surprises he took 9 ft a game at a good clip.    Vs a guy like deandre ayton who averaged 18.2 pt per game last year on a efg of .548 but a ts of .568.  Hes  only taking 2 ft attempts a game but made them at a fine rate of 75 %.   You can't just act like the free throws don't matter.  They had almost identical usage and butler took 2 less shot attempts per game and scored 2 more points.  That's a significant difference.  Thay 2 pt is the extr 2 percent of ts that he has because of those free throws.  You may not like butlers game because he's playing for the foul but its still effective at doing what's most important which is scoring as many points as you can on every posession.
I honestly think that Minnesota squad just did not care to win. Jimmy butler literally called out all of the starters and beat them in a pick up game with the third stringers. And then you see what jimmy butler does once he departs and plays in the bubble.   I think you can‚Äôt deny that jimmy called that Minnesota squad out for a damn good reason. I don‚Äôt think thibs can be blamed for the young squad that didn‚Äôt care to practice enough.
I remember thibs was always a really good defensive minded coach. It seems like he really prefers defense over offense. A lot of players got really upset with him because he ‚Äúruns players into the ground‚Äù he did have jimmy butler playing over 40 minutes a game consistently (it seems like this I haven‚Äôt confirmed with actual stats) and a lot of people blamed him for Derrick Rose suffering his initial injury because he had Derrick Rose playing heavy minutes as well. Basically he likes to utilize his best players to the maximum on every given night. He definitely makes good adjustments late game and will prefer a defensive line up in late game situations. He is a good coach overall. I just think it was kind of like the Lovie smith situation. He was a great coach but his time just ran out teams watched all of the film basically our offense became very stagnant/we really just didn‚Äôt have a second weapon and that wasn‚Äôt really thibs fault at all and we lost Derrick Rose so we basically had to blow our team up at that point.   He‚Äôs a good coach overall and I like how he‚Äôs been coaching these Knicks so far.

Yea cause giannis totally wasn‚Äôt guarded by Jimmy butler in the playoffs lol
a lot of it was jimmy butler to be fair. They dropped from 3rd to 8 seed when Butler got injured
"&gt;Thinking the Lakers had they not brought in LeBron would be a playoff team in the West is preposterous.  It's not remotely.  They were 12 games out of playoff spot in 2018 -- starting two 20 year-olds, and one each 22, 23, and 24.  Only 1 player over 25 played over 700 minutes for that team -- Brook Lopez.  That was one of the youngest NBA teams in recent history, when weighted by minutes-played.  They were barely older than a college team.  They also had 20 year-old Ivica Zubac and 20 year-old Thomas Bryant.  They traded Zubac to make room for Davis, and he immediately started for the playoff-bound Clippers.  Bryant is starting in Washington -- who are not a playoff team, but he'd certainly be a capable backup.  They also would've had plenty of cap space to re-sign Brook Lopez, who is also capable of starting on a playoff team.  Plus Ingram, Randle, Ball, Caldwell-Pope, Hart, Kuzma, Caruso, Clarkson, and Hunter -- all guys currently playing well for various teams.  Or, they could package some of those assets -- with the 3 firsts and second round picks they used on Davis -- to acquire other players.  For just two examples, they had more disposable assets than Miami needed to trade for Jimmy Butler and still had more than Indiana needed to trade for Malcolm Brogdon.  Just to name two very good players who have recently been on the trade market for much, much less than the Lakers spent on one season of Davis.  They were on their way back to playoffs, even without James -- exactly because of the original topic here, they drafted very well year after year, and that left them with a wealth of young assets."
"Lol, theres nothing really to work with here man.  I guess you could trade Edwards and picks for someone but its not a good enough trade package to bring home anyone that moves the needle enough to justify mortgaging the future.  Dont really need a repeat of the Jimmy Butler thing"
"Well in a vacuum you gotta think of everything, and usually as big men guard other big men, I sure as hell ain‚Äôt picking AD to defend the tough big men of past like Tim Duncan or Dirk. Guard Jimmy Butler sure, but there‚Äôs many better big men defenders in a vacuum"
"I dont think you watched this game and are just giving a reactionary take, so I'll leave you what I left the other guy:  Siakam needs to just got back to the fundamental. Jimmy Butler doesnt get 20 every night, but he's always consistent on defense and  makes the right plays on offense.  Right now, Siakam is just fouling a shit ton when he should be just trying to defend well. And on offense he's being overwhelmed and its leading to him being on an island trying to take on 5 dudes at once. His best way to score was on fast break scenarios, corner 3s, and hustle plays inside. By adding the dribble game, he's just trying to do too much on ball which is making it difficult to score inside.  I dont think he'll be ""Hibberted"" because Siakam's skills are modern and work, he's (and to a certain extent Nurse) just lost focus of how he needs to be utilizing his minutes. Less trying to be KD/Kawhi and more trying to be Draymond/Jimmy."

The soft ass players who couldn‚Äôt deal with Jimmy Butler being a meanie poo either
To be fair jimmy butler missed some time with injury so they could have had a better record
"Disagree. Even using espns trash top 100, its clear he isn't even top 30. Who on that list would you take Siakam over?  1 LeBron  2 AD  3 Giannis  4 Doncic  5 Kawhi  6 Durant  7 Lillard  8 Curry  9 Harden  10 Jokic  11 Tatum  12 Jimmy Butler  13 Bam  14 Embiid  15 CP3  16 Simmons  17 Booker  18 Mitchell  19 Zion  20 PG  21 Murray  22 Beal  23 KAT  **24 SIAKAM**  25 Kyrie  26 Gobert  27 CJ  28 Ingram  29 Trae  30 Lowry  31 Ja  32 Jaylen"
"Hoiberg also never got the players he wanted, imagine giving a coach with a system based on shooting washed D-Wade, and Rajon Rondo to complement Jimmy Butler, who is also not a great 3pt shooter"
"Yeah he did it multiple times, and and did the same play right after this one (but hiw the rim).  He also guarded Jimmy for most of the game, and did very well, forcing butler stop dribbling and desperetly looking for somone to get rid of the ball. Jimmy had something like 2/3/2 iirc.  Yeah i know Jimmy also wasn't in his brighest day and in any given night can play much better, don't get me wrong. But the defense played by Luka was very positive in most possessions."
"I mean who's the actual 10th best player, approximately Jimmy Butler? I'd take Butler over him rn"
The perfect player for Harden is someone like Jimmy Butler. A non-ball dominant elite defending wing that can also playmake at a relatively high level.
"To not waste more gas with you since you are quick to dismiss reality, Utah will remain a perennial 6-8 seed whose realistic objective is to get to second round. This is the squad that you will call ""full of difference makers"".  Jrue Holiday (a reserve all star just like Donovan ""Kobe"" Mitchell) Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis as well as Paul George and Chris Paul were all traded for Role players and that's just in the last two years.  I would've gone for Chris Paul, or Jimmy rather than the corpse of Mike Conley when they had the chance.  If going to the second round to lose 8/9 games is what you call doing more, I'm intrigued to see what you call doing less.  I take it that this year ""since they have Bogi"" they'll win two games in the conference semi finals and pat one another in back ."
"If Sam hinkie would have shut up about tanking instead of calling it the process, maybe silver would have ignored him.  If brown was a better coach, maybe you would have Jimmy Butler."
Counter-counter point:  * [Here's how AD approached guarding Jimmy Butler in the playoffs](https://youtu.be/k0tn9QRJMec?t=81)  * [Here's how Giannis approached guarding Jimmy Butler in the playoffs](https://youtu.be/3sxwmkMmOUk?t=229)
By leaving the team you promise would do great and team up with a top 3 player final mvp with a stacked team is  any better? Why people act like he did a Jimmy Butler when what he did was (to quote Dame) running away from the grind
I hope its better than Doug McDermott being trained by Jimmy Butler.
"He doesn‚Äôt have the scoring ability to be a top 10 player yet. Every single top 10 player is the best player on their own team, and can be the best player on a playoff team.  The best rookies in the past 15 years have been Luka, Blake, Trae, Simmons, Mitchell, Rose etc. have all been very good, and close to all star level, but nowhere near top 10. Players like Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Embiid, KAT, Trae, and even Luka are all players in the later part of the top 10 or outside looking in. Lamelo isn‚Äôt even the best player on his own team."
"The Rockets fans that were insistent it was fake news unfortunately have to face reality.   The only thing I‚Äôm surprised about is that Harden is going about this the Jimmy Butler in Minnesota way now.   It is what it is. He‚Äôs right. They are nowhere near good enough to compete for a title and may not even make the playoffs. Gotta suck for guys like Wall, Wood, PJ, EG but Harden is right"
"two parties - one side sees him as developing into a more team oriented player who's able to hit game winning shots, and dont want to let another guy go before they grow into who they can be (i.e. jimmy butler).   the other side sees a full rebuild on the horizon with the new front office and patrick williams being the only core pieces. zachs stock is very high, so he'd need to net a huge amount, more than it took to get jrue for sure"
jimmy butler was literally better than him
Prefer it to Jimmy Butler running into defenders and getting 12 free throws a game
Imagine complaining about flops when you have Jimmy Butler lol
"Jimmy butler will never win a ring he went to Miami to be wit std ridden women, fuck the heat and their fans"
"Despite the memes we were given, Jimmy Butler going nuts with the TWolves.  On court product has been shit too, especially the regular season."
yeah and that team was stacked. More stacked than the Jimmy Butler heat...
If not booker than Jimmy Butler... elite on defense one of the best in the game on D. And a very good offensive player. If you saw him in the finals you know what I'm talking about. Or Kawhi.
"Before he was lowballled and left Cleveland, David Griffin had three moves ready to go; one involving Jimmy Butler, one involving Kawhi, and one involving Paul George. After he left, nobody would talk to us, we built the super-team of 10 years ago and all was lost"
Giannis  Kawhi  Jokic  Jimmy butler And many many more are way better
"You can believe that if you want but I have always been of the opinion that the Cavs won in spite of Kyrie. Too many people just look at raw numbers without factoring in intangibles that aren't quantified, whether it be team chemistry, mental make-up, etc. You can have all the talent in the world but still completely squander it. Being a good teammate is worth more than things like scoring 5 points more than someone else IMO.   I mean, even in that season, I would have ranked the following better than him:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Anthony Davis 6. Damian Lillard 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Klay Thompson 9. Russell Westbrook 10. James Harden 11. John Wall 12. Chris Paul 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyle Lowry 15. Paul George 16. Gordon Hayward 17. Blake Griffin 18. Mike Conley  So that leaves two spots remaining with Kyrie in the mix with guys like DeMar Derozen, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl-Anthony Towns, Bradley Beal, CJ McCollum, Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, etc. There are a bunch of names within the remaining players that I'd rather have on my team than Kyrie even in that season"
"Iono I have Jimmy Butler and Westbrook taken just a couple picks behind Durant, extremely disappointing"
&gt;And no it's not his fault who his teammates have been. But it's not been a total shitshow of running mates. I watched a lot of wolves in league pass when it was him Wiggins and Lavine. The way they threw away games in the second half and mostly 4th quarters was infuriating.  That was 3 years ago.  &gt;Jimmy Butler is a clear winner and he bares some responsibility for not demanding the same work ethic Jimmy was (Jimmy's move to get traded was absolute bullshit and not cool at all)   KAT made all nba third team that year and was as important to the team success as was Jimmy.  &gt;And I have to assume to team consulted him on the Russell trade. If that's the case you're about to have a subpar season and potentially hand the warrior a lottery pick with his permission.   He was the one who forced the team into trading for D'lo (and I don't disagree with that decision)  I mean you can find games of the Wolves this season when KAT went down and watch the ones where he did play and you'll find a shocking difference. And the last season was a disaster only because KAT went down for half of the year.
"I think he's a decent playmaker. But the evaluation of playmaking for centers is rapidly changing. He's not doing the same things as Jokic, Bam, or Sabonis. And that's me being a bit of a homer by throwing Sabonis in that group.   And no it's not his fault who his teammates have been. But it's not been a total shitshow of running mates. I watched a lot of wolves in league pass when it was him Wiggins and Lavine. The way they threw away games in the second half and mostly 4th quarters was infuriating.  Jimmy Butler is a clear winner and he bares some responsibility for not demanding the same work ethic Jimmy was (Jimmy's move to get traded was absolute bullshit and not cool at all)   And I have to assume to team consulted him on the Russell trade. If that's the case you're about to have a subpar season and potentially hand the warrior a lottery pick with his permission.   I just don't think you can sit back and say the man doesn't deserve any criticism when all he's been able to prove is his ability to get superficial stats. Sorry but this is his team, and he holds some responsibility"
"If anything I think you could put Jimmy Butler squarely ahead of Russ in that regard. I don‚Äôt know anyone who dislikes Russ the person, just Russ the ball hog."
"With less than a minute on the clock and a chance to ice Game 1 of the 2015 Finals, Timo Mozgov was absolutely mauled putting back a layup. No call. Had the foul been properly called, that game doesn‚Äôt go into OT, Klay and Kyrie don‚Äôt collide, and the Cavs don‚Äôt face the rest of the series without one of our best players. More than likely, the Cavs win that Finals, repeat the next year, LeBron signs longterm for a Cavaliers dynasty, Kyrie stays, and we bring in either Kawhi or Jimmy Butler. The LeBron slander stops in its tracks"
"The heat were getting blown out before the Bam and Dragic injuries. The Heat squeaked out two wins on the back of Jimmy Butler and 4th quarters with 10 free throws.  Warriors weren't favored if Klay didn't go down in game 6, just like Warriors being at best a second round exit when Klay comes back next year."
"I feel like you're being intentionally dense so you can feel superior by making a statement sound dumber than it is.   There is absolutely a point where common opinion flips. Where Jimmy Butler became an Allstar or where Kawhi started being viewed at a top 5 player in the league. Obviously those are all culminations of many games but there are definitely individual points where those became the prevailing opinions. For example, Lebron's game 6 performance in 2016 likely was ""the game"" that made people put Lebron over some other player"
Maybe think about how Tatum could be better than Jimmy Butler in the playoffs first.
"I'm 6'4"" without shoes. That means I am taller than...  - Steph Curry - Kyrie Irving - Russell Westbrook - Donovan Mitchell - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Kyle Lowry - Fred VanVleet  ... among others, and three inches or less shorter than:  - Kawhi Leonard - Jimmy Butler - DeMar DeRozan - Zach LaVine - OG Anunoby - Draymond Green  - Klay Thompson  ... yet I am the complete opposite of an athlete lol"
"Just some articles:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2781284-jimmy-butler-reportedly-took-issue-with-andrew-wiggins-effort-defense  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/06/15/report-jimmy-butler-had-problems-with-andrew-wiggins-last-season/  I can't dig out all the tweets from our beat writers, but the clear issue was that Butler wanted to be designated a franchise max player, but he needed to wait a year for the team to extend him using his bird rights. In the meantime, they gave Wiggins the max, and Butler took offense to that. He went to Thibs and asked to be let out when it became clear he wasn't going to be ""the guy"" for the franchise."

Has anyone ever seen Jimmy Butler and Inspector Gadget in the same room?
Jimmy Butler. Even in his Bulls days he'd have a monster 35+ point night and then have 6 points the next game.
"Hey Duncan, thanks for allowing us to ask you questions.  My question is, what do you think is the most misunderstood thing about Jimmy Butler, especially after his years going from Chicago, to Minnesota, then Philly, and now Miami?"
"Depends at what point. Going into college or earlier it was like potential Jordan-Kobe alltime great to by the end of college, it was more like multi time allstar version of that player. Jimmy Butler or PG maybe, trade some bulk for athleticism. Though, I do think that they assumed he would fill out more."
"2 way all star wing, Kawhi, PG, Tatum, Jimmy Butler type of player"
What is Jimmy Butler like as a teammate?
"Jimmy Butler take was bad, but OP also ranked Draymond Green 197th in the league.   [Edit: Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/j2ezdm/top_500_players_in_the_nba_190181/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)"
"The Miami Heat have added these players to the OUT/Health and Safety Protocols list, following the completion of contact tracing:  Jimmy Butler  Goran Dragic  Kendrick Nunn  Bam Adebayo  Moe Harkless  Udonis Haslem  KZ Okpala  This is in addition to Avery Bradley, on the list Sunday.  ADDITIONALLY: Meyers Leonard (shoulder) is questionable, Kelly Olynyk (groin) is probable and Gabe Vincent (knee) is probable."
Jimmy Butler and the third stringers got this.
The funniest thing about the bubble was the huge wave of social media posts from players the second they got out from their vacation spots surrounded by people. Still can recall Jimmy Butler in that F1 car.
I just have one question.  Jimmy Butler is an asshat.
"Yeah it's a fair point I had thought that also and it might be what ends up happening. I just think for Hou there is also a level of urgency for this to happen regardless of what lip service is being given in this report, Harden's trade value getting him for 2 playoff runs vs 1 is a big difference. By trading for him you really are trading for him right now it's why the concerns about his next contract are overblown getting him is about now not about the right to give him $53 mil or whatever at age 36. The age thing is also why if you are a team I am trying to do this now the east in particular is wide open this season.   Best player to get traded in season recently was Jimmy Butler. Before that 2011 with Carmelo Anthony and Deron Williams. So yes what you are saying is true usually."
The fact that OP ever had Jimmy Butler at #3 overall suggests that this list is very reactionary.  So it's perfect for this sub!
"how do you feel about the memes comparing your looks to Sheen Estevez, including Jimmy Butler yelling ‚Äújimmy neutron‚Äù at you from the bench?"
Most of this list is pretty predictable - either guys coming off unexpected career seasons or guys aging out.  Jimmy Butler doesn't belong at all.  Take away the half game he went down in injury and the first game back from injury where he wasn't 100% yet.  He's looked like normal Jimmy Butler in the rest.
you had Jimmy Butler at #3 last year? wtf
Jimmy Butler is fine haha. He‚Äôs only played 5 full games.
My question is why do you think jimmy butler was sort of seen as a 'problem' for other teams? It seems like he manages to be a great leader for this heat team and gets young players like yourself open looks and playing solid team defense.
What does jimmy butler smell like?
"I wouldn't say your ""odds go up"" if you're in a large market specifically. Which players on large market teams have made it who haven't deserved it?  Like last year's large market all stars were LeBron (and elite, household name on the first seed), AD (elite and in the first seed), kawhi (elite and on the 2nd seed), Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo (both very, very good/elite and on a high seed), Kemba and Tatum +Boston was the 3fd seed) and depending on if you count Houston and Philly as big markets, Harden, Westbrook, Embiid and Simmons, all of whom are also pretty elite.   Though you aren't wrong about everything else. It's why the raptors had 2 stars last year, it's why sabonis was an all star."
Favorite Jimmy Butler moment?
Is it true that Jimmy Butler wakes up at 3am to practice? Haha jk I don't a have a question in mind :(
"How do you feel the NBA‚Äôs covid protocols this season have been in terms of both safety and freedom? Obviously your game yesterday was cancelled, but it was originally planned to continue even after half of the Celtics roster was ruled out, and was only cancelled when the Heat couldn‚Äôt field 8 players. Do you think the NBA‚Äôs generally been making the right calls with these situations?  On a related note, what new rule implemented due to the pandemic has been most annoying to deal with (even if it‚Äôs ultimately necessary)?  Loved watching you in the finals by the way, must have been hard carrying that bum Jimmy all the way there (jk, love Butler too)."
Would you rather have a 4 ft. Jimmy Butler as a teammate or Charles Barkley now???
Is Jimmy Butler that type of guy who closes his fridge door with his hip? Love form Latvia.
Another way to look at it for the crowd that doesn‚Äôt like being honest about guys being busts is Wiggins is a big reason Minnesota is still a mess. Two no 1 picks in a row is a massive boon for a rebuilding franchise. Median level no 1 pick past 25 years is a Blake Griffin caliber player. Wiggins falling so short is a big part of why Minnesota has only had one season worth a damn since 2014/15 and that was with Jimmy Butler
Midrange and good footwork. Seeing Jimmy Butler getting a 40pt triple double in the finals without even attempting a three was incredibly refreshing.
"Don‚Äôt really have a favourite style of play, but I love Jokic, Murray, Kyrie, Luka, Jimmy Butler, and DeRozan to name a few."
Jimmy Butler is not near the level of star as playing with Steph Curry lol and Draymond is possibly the smartest defender in the league.
&gt;Wiggins: ‚Äú...Here the culture is different. The guys behind me I know they got my back. It‚Äôs great here.‚Äù   Shot at Jimmy Butler?
"Y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt put together a competent team around him and towns worth shit. The best pg he had was Rubio who can‚Äôt score for shit.  Never had a defensive center/great defense in general and never had a good coach (Thibbs was not great offensively).  And Wiggins was one of the few players who did well in the playoffs for y‚Äôall. I remember that.  So yes, he‚Äôs not a star, but your franchise didn‚Äôt do him any favors.  And jimmy butler got traded from 3 teams. He was considered a headcase before the heat."
"He played that way next to Jimmy Butler, Taj Gibson, and KG. You can say a lot of things about those guys, but ""not trying on D"" isn't one of them."
"They didn‚Äôt make it to the finals, right? So as I said, they weren‚Äôt a championship team.  Even so, did you watch them in the playoffs? It was mostly because of Jimmy Butler they went that far. Jimmy went to the Heat the following season and the Heat made it to the finals."
Does Jimmy Butler really like coffee or was it a bit that went too far and he couldnt walk it back?
"It sounds silly, but the Sixers really need Jimmy Butler."
Jimmy butler is that guy as well
You think Kawhi is on the same tier as Jimmy Butler??
"Nah, he's behind Luka/Jokic/Lebron as well.    He's somewhere with Jimmy Butler and AD, hovering around top 5 status but not quite there."
Real talk what if the Timberwolves never traded for Jimmy Butler?
"Yep! Lots of great defenders have average physical ""tools"". Fred Van Vleet, aging Chris Paul, Tony Allen, Jimmy Butler (same wingspan as his height, supposedly, but his arms look super short irl).  Defense is at least 50% mental if not more"
"Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, and Tobias Harris were all in the same draft. Harris hit his 10,000th point a few days ago, Kawhi today, and Jimmy most likely would have got to 10,000 today too had the Heat game not been cancelled."
"While Jimmy Butler is not a better player than AD, I would argue he played better than AD in the Finals."
Maybe a guy like jimmy butler?
If that‚Äôs not basketball then what was jimmy butler game 5

Jimmy Butler is a bum
"This is an enormous overreaction. Edwards is 19 and has shown great flashes. We are all excited about this kid. James Harden did nothing in his first four seasons in the league and still became a star. Jimmy Butler was a terrible rookie. Bradley Beal had a very ho hum rookie year. Brandon Ingram looked truly awful his rookie season. Look, players take time and we are only a few games into the season. LaMelo just not so many games ago played awful and this sub was calling him a bust. Can we chill and let these kids grow up? Come back in 2-3 years on this. None of these players were expected to be generational talents. I am very confident in our selection of Edwards based on what I‚Äôve seen from him already. Great handle, good vision, very strong moves to the rack, good ability to create separation, hits big shots in the game. His efficiency isn‚Äôt there yet but he‚Äôs also being told in the second unit go ham, so he is volume scoring. Let‚Äôs relax."
"lol yeah... i didn't deny that. dude plays hard every night though. he's no MJ or Kobe, but he gives 100% effort every night. i would rather have jimmy butler than james harden on my team any given day"
"I know Richardson hasn‚Äôt shot well for us, but he‚Äôs completely changed our defense.  He should be getting looked at for All-Defense   The Mavs have played several star guards who‚Äôve had Richardson as their primary defenders and here are their stats in those games  Booker: 22/5/3 on 8/15 shooting but with EIGHT turnovers  PG: 15/2/4 on 4/13 shooting with 4 turnovers   Jimmy Butler: 2/3/2 on 0/6 shooting with 3 turnovers  Harden: 21/3/10 on 5/17 shooting with 2 turnovers   Murray: 21/4/9 on 8/19 shooting with 3 turnovers  LaVine is the only star guard that has really cooked us and most of his damage was done with THJ and others on him.  Not only that but our steals as a team are way up and that‚Äôs largely due to Richardson, he‚Äôs been phenomenal on D"
"&gt; You don‚Äôt want him guarding the other team‚Äôs best offensive players  he's guarded Paul George, John Wall, James Harden, Jimmy Butler and Aaron Gordon all successfully so far this season."
"lebron family  father: lebron  sons: bronny, curry, kd, pg13, jimmy butler, jokic, harden, dame, demar, iguodala, russ"
What narratives? We watched it live. There‚Äôs a reason Jimmy Butler was running point and not Ben. How do you explain that?
"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"
Jimmy Butler I think
"I would say there are tiers, and Lebron, CP3, Rondo, and Draymond are all in that top group.  I might put Jimmy Butler in there too."
Jimmy Butler
Ben Simmons has made more three pointers this season than Jimmy Butler.
"He's had stretches like this with the Wolves as well. There was a period where ""he was learning from Jimmy Butler"" and did really well defensively but then stopped caring again."
I really thought Stanley Johnson could be an 18/8/4 guy with All-NBA Defense. Like a less scoring Jimmy Butler/Paul George.
"PG started his career at the 2 just like Jimmy Butler, they just ended up going up a position with the way the league went"
"Basketball is really mental. It's why Lebron picked up meditation as a hobby. It's why Jimmy Butler, Lebron, and Draymond Green are important for their teammates. Those three guys project confidence that creates that energy for their teammates and Dray won't *let you* have a mental block. He'll scream at you until you're more worried about him than you are missing the shot. They keep an eye on the mentality of their teammates the whole game though and don't let you slouch or give up.  If your confidence goes in the middle of a basketball game you can become dead ass useless to your teammates. You'll stop driving, you'll stop shooting and you'll play scared. Defenders will read you like a book and eat you.  ([Defenders want to unnerve you](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlUH6eDIyq3ASwo/giphy.gif) and get you off your game so you make dumb moves. It's why you blitz baby quarterbacks until all they can do is run the ball.)  So the mental aspect is a big part of this game, I think. If his mental health is in the way it's blocking his playing."
LeBron has the time gem for sure. Been able to sustain his youth while cultivating his garden of young talent.  Kyrie has the soul gem. No explanation necessary.  Power gem...hmm I'd imagine that's gotta be a big man so maybe Embiid or Giannis.  Jimmy Butler has the reality gem for constantly staying competitive with different franchises.  Mind gem? Idk.
no they only have 6 players. simmons is gonna look like Finals Jimmy Butler ready to pass out by the 4th quarter if the game doesn't get cancelled
He was either primary ball handler and secondary scorer or tertiary ball handler and tertiary scorer. Wiggins needs the ball in hands to be in rhythm but he is super effective at cutting.  He never had the role that he needed to succeed. I mean it worked alright for the first few months with Jimmy danger but he got ran into the grounds by thibs and then when butler went down he couldn't compensate.
"Jimmy Butler, Deng, Noah, etc would have never been the players they became if not for Thib‚Äôs giving them those major minutes."
So I presume you would choose Jimmy Butler over Giannis?
"He really reminds me of Butler. They both can't shoot, both have really hot games and really cold games, RJ is a worse defender but he's still above average. I think Jimmy is about his ceiling"
I like RJ's game. Despite the bad shooting he's very aggressive on offense and plays good defense as well. Also what a body at only 20. Grow into a Jimmy Butler type 2 way player. He did develop under Thibs as well!
"As much as people shit on Brand, as he deserves, I do think the Tobias and Butler trades were good. It was wasting and not utilizing the other picks nor being able to acquire stars in free agency that was poor. Also the poor organization structure.  ""Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the Philadelphia 76ers for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick""  Is a steal. No offense to RoCo, but he's nowhere near worth Butler and Saric is a low end bench player due to his defense and his offense not being enough to warrant more minutes.  ""The Philadelphia 76ers acquired Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott early Wednesday morning for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Philadelphia's protected 2020 first-round pick, the Miami Heat's unprotected 2021 first-round pick and the Detroit Pistons' 2021 and 2023 second-round picks""  That Miami pick isn't going to be amazing, but outside of that:  Chandler is in China. Muscala was traded for Zubac, but he's not great(although he is playing better for the Lakers).  Those trades weren't bad and they traded low assets for better players, it's just filling out the rest of the team wasn't done properly until this year."
"It makes me sad that all of these guys played in Hinkie's last year with the Sixers and are turning out to have been good choices by him (even beyond guys like Embiid, or the pick that was about to become Simmons):  * Jerami Grant * Robert Covington * TJ McConnell * Richaun Holmes * Christian Wood * [the rights to] Dario Saric * lots of extra picks  The team was really gutted in the era between Hinkie and Morey (yes, they have Tobias Harris and had one year of Jimmy Butler to show for it, but it makes me sad whenever I think about what Hinkie could have maybe done with the team he had in 2016)."
Jimmy Butler maybe?
This is totally off topic but I had a weird dream where I went to an NBA game and I got a bunch of Rocket‚Äôs jerseys and lanyards from Jimmy Butler.
"Even if yall do ""get lucky"" it still probably going to be a complete waste. Need to start learning how to win. Got losing down pact. They've had multiple top draft picks over the past decade.   So start going the other way build a team that knows how to win. Stop resting guys to help your odds. They suck anyway don't worry about it.  This why tanking is kind of dumb. It's closing in on two decades of this shit. Jimmy Butler had to drag this team to a winning mentality and they couldn't handle it."
That guy? Jimmy butler
"The organization could have kept him and offered him a 5 year max as a free agent, but that would have taken them hugely into the luxury tax.  You can't blame ownership for not wanting to pay a ton for a low-end playoff team.  That said: you can't blame Jimmy Butler for looking at Wiggins and being frustrated that Wiggins was making more money."
"Trae, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Bam, Sabionis, Randle, Kyrie People, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, Vucevic, Lowry, Spicy P, Ben Simmons. Would Seth be better than any of these guys?"
"Jimmy butler has a problem with authority and team mates that boils down to ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt do what I, Jimmy Butler, deemed correct at all times‚Äù color me shocked"
"I pity them, but they drove out Jimmy Butler and immediately resumed being complete garbage. KAT's recent story is tragic but even before all this all indications were that he is not a franchise player."
So what's Jimmy Butler up to these days?
Right lol. This dude is acting like we would have given up jimmy butler for a scrub
Jimmy Butler
"They would‚Äôve been fine if they had traded Wiggins for Butler instead of Lavine. The Bulls were fine with it and Thibs wanted to do it, but Glen Taylor vetoed it and made them do the Lavine Trade. KAT and Lavine is definitely a playoff contender even if Jimmy walked"
"You probably look at box score alone. Kyle Lowry is one of the most impactful players of the last decade. He is the definition of a player who is not done justice through stats. He ranks extremely high in advanced Metrics among some of the top players in the league, 7th in the last decade in impact by wins added. Kyrie is an elite scorer, but there is more to winning than simply scoring. Kyrie is not as impactful as Lowry by the eye test, or advanced metrics. Coming from a Spurs fan, there is a reason he has elevated his teams much more than Kyrie has. Jimmy Butler, Lowry, are of that class"
"2 back to back MVP and 0 Finals appearance to show for..   He failed the first year against the Raptors led Kawhi because he was doing the same shit  He gone and fucking do it again the next year against Heat led Jimmy Butler  That in itself should be enough talking point for ESPN and fan to see how big of a gaping hole Giannis has, yet nobody ever talk about it.. instead everyone just keeps chanting trade Khris Middleton for a better guy"
"People keep saying that all you have to do is put up a wall and that's it. In reality it's not that easy. To make the wall effectively you need great defenders at multiple positions. Remember he lost to 2 defensive players of the years in kahwi and gasol backed up by all defensive team caliber players in sikam, ibaka. Then the next year he lost to a great defensive team that had Jimmy butler, bam, crowder etc.. How many team can realistically say that have that amount of good defenders? If you just listened to r/nba you would think he got bounced by a bunch of scrubs. Each team he has lost to has gone to the finals."
"He was the main piece in a trade for Jimmy Butler... Clearly we made him look good (he makes it easy since he is good, but OP is ridiculous)"
"We brought in Tom Thibodeau to teach him defense. We brought in older vets like KG and Crawford to try and mentor him. We brought in Jimmy Butler to lessen his workload and hopefully light a spark in his ass.. and lastly we poached David Vanterpool from Portland because he worked magic with Lillard and McCollum and we thought maybe he could get some improvement out of Wiggins...   People don't watch our games and they don't follow our team, and I don't blame them, but jesus people need to realize that we gave Wiggins every chance to succeed and he couldn't. Go look at his Draft  profile and you'll realize how little he has changed or developed his game in 6 years"
I would love Jimmy Butler on this team. I feel like he would fit in with our hustle culture
"1)no??  That doesn‚Äôt even make any sense lol  2)the bulls just came off of 4 years of tanking, no one cares about any team that loses all the time.  And yet, they‚Äôre still like #3 in NBA merch sales üòÇüòÇ with NO superstars (although ZLV is making a strong case thus far, the point still stands) they‚Äôre one of the most profitable global sports mega brands to ever exist  3)Jimmy Butler bulls jerseys outsell his heat jerseys ü§£ fun fact:  I watched two of the ‚Äúfinals‚Äù** games this year in Nairobi, and literally ever single bar was flooded with Bulls #21 jerseys   4)Derrick Rose became one of the most popular athletes on the planet literally overnight after ONE great (massively overrated) season because ‚Äúomgomgchicagoisgoodagainomgomg‚Äù lol  The Chicago Bulls = basketball, to the most people around the planet.  The NBA &amp; sport of basketball in general is still coming down from that singular high 23 years later.  The entire world has been salivating for the Bulls to be good again for over two decades, and it‚Äôll never change"
this is based on this year and what you assume will happen based on play from previous years right?  Otherwise jokic is likely just no1 and embiid is top 5.  I personally wouldnt put much weight on  what happened previous years even early into the season so list needs a lot of changes.    cj and vucevic have absolutely been top 20 so far.  CJ's putting up 27/4/5 on 62ts% beating dame across every box score metric.  Vucevic is putting up 23/11/3.5 and easily 2nd in TPA.  I got some downvotes from magic fans for downplaying the rest of their team and some have been injured but he really is carrying them right now.  Jimmy butler has done very little this year.
Jimmy Butler would be expelled from the league
"I mean it literally just happened with jimmy butler. Don't get me wrong, he's a good player, but he's not top ten. LeBron, Steph, KD, Kawhi, Giannis, Harden, Luka, Jokic, Dame, and Embiid are all better than him (pretty clearly IMO)."
"I mean, imagine if Shaq said this to an established player, like Jimmy Butler. I think Shaq got off easy with how nice Mitchell ended the conversation."
"What a stupid take on a guy who's only 24. Go look at what guys like Steve Nash, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Gary Payton, Chauncey Billups, etc. were doing at his age. Dennis Rodman is a HOFer who didn't even touch the court til he was a year older than Mitchell is now."
Disappointment might be over doing it but his stats are better then his play offensively. He takes away from his team mates because there is no fear that he will shoot and if the defense is set he rarely takes it to the rim. He allows teams to double off him. He is a glorified 6-10 rondo. If He misses  a few shots he mentally collapses he starts playing with his head hung. Also think of the players he has played with they improve his stats but also look that they did else wear. Jimmy butler goes crazy in Miami. Tobias looks like a shadow of who he was in LA. Embiid is a beast but would be better if Ben could at-least semi spread the floor. He score the quietest points. I never see him do anything at big moments.
"I honestly don't feel like Shaq is hating on the new generation, I think he just doesn't consider them a winner until they lead their team deep in the playoffs. Mitchell played great in the last playoffs but his team still lost to the Nuggets in the first round after being up 3-1 so Shaq doesn't consider that success because it happened to him when he was in orlando.   I think Shaq gives credit to people like Steph Curry, Lebron James, Dame Lilliard, Jimmy Butler, and more because they have led their teams to more success."
"We have most of the guys back from H&amp;S protocols except for Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley, who are pretty important for our perimeter defense (and well, *Jimmy freaking Butler*).   Also Tyler Herro has missed the last few games with neck spasms, which has hurt as well"
"If Seth Curry is on the court, he just increases the offense for both teams, he helps the Sixers offense and he'll help the opponents offense.   If he is on the court in closing 5, James Harden/Jayson Tatum/Jimmy Butler etc. will force a switch and get him onto them and he will bleed points.   I've seen this happen to my own damn team, Kemba got hunted by Jimmy a bunch last year."
Why tf would we trade our only remaining valuable piece from the Jimmy butler trade for role players and picks all over again. Thank god the bulls FO is competent now and they have some sense unlike y'all who just don't want the bottom teams to ever come out of that rebuilding phase.   It's already established that our FO doesn't wanna trade Lavine and even lavine's happy under our new head coach and FO. He can just play this and the next season out and can go to a contender if he really isn't happy and btw he'll only be 27 when he hits the free agency. Foh with everyone wanting Lavine for trash ass players and late first round picks
He continues this way throughout the season... Jimmy butler will be proud and will call him his son!
"Ah yes, because the game where LeBron played 41 minutes, scored 40 points, took 21 shots, and guarded Jimmy Butler the whole game is him ‚Äúcoasting‚Äù"
"It's not the same and you know it.  Gobert is a traditional center. He guards Joel Embiid. He guards Anthony Davis. He guards Jokic. He guards the other elite centers. He's not an athletic freak that can guard multiple positions like Giannis.   Giannis has the build to guard guys like Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler. He's one of the very few guys that can legitimately guard any position. That's so incredibly valuable as demonstrated by the way the Lakers used Davis last year but for some reason, maybe it's coaching idk, Giannis is often not put on these guys in the biggest moments of games.   Jimmy Butler was killing them in must-win games and he never took that assignment, even though he has the wingspan and body to do it. You don't see a problem with that?"
"Jimmy Butler, he made that finals really fun to watch and as an ex Miami fan it was good to see competive ball from them again  Edit: and Iggy for everything he did for my warriors"
i love Jimmy Butler ü•≤ but also all his ads just turn out to be Mich Ultra ads. why is Jimmy Butler only marketed to calorie-conscious suburban moms?
Jimmy Butler is peanuts lmao
"&gt; When it comes to fouls I do believe that big men should be treated more harshly simply because part of being a post player is contact.  you are not making a rational case for the need for distinction between a post player and a perimeter player here. part of being a post player is contact but part of being a slasher for instance isn't? why would a call be different depending on the players height - it's the same action happening in the same area of the floor.   your entire argument hinges on your personal abstract idea of what a ""post player"" and ""perimeter player"" is. if you are not demonstrating the difference between hitting Dwyane Wade on the arm and hitting Shaq on the arm doing the same thing in the same place then none of this means anything.  &gt;Never did we see any of the great big men deliberately flopping because that‚Äôs not how a center should play.   but is it how a perimeter player should play? ""flopping"" is only acceptable for certain players and not the others?   &gt; It‚Äôs not enjoyable for anybody except you guys to watch a game where 40% of the opponents points come off of free throws  this does not happen with just post players though. James Harden isn't a post player. Jimmy Butler isn't a post player. Luka, Trae are not post players.  if your enjoyment of the game diminishes because of fouls then why are you only campaigning for post players to be treated more harshly and not the perimeter players? out of the top 20 players in free throw attempts per 100 possessions last year, only 5 of them were bigs (Embiid, AD, Giannis, Trez, Wood) and out of that 5, just 3 of them run post ups at a meaningful number. could it be because your team doesn't have a post up big but a lot of perimeter players lol?"
"Oh shit, I forgot about Jimmy Butler. That was a great individual season for Butler. But then he was gone within a year and by the end of it you'd still rather have Lavine.  And weren't you the guys who paid him? I'm happy with what we got, Di'Angelo's contract wasn't much better. And I'd much rather have Wiggins than Di'Angelo."
You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about if you‚Äôre calling Jimmy Butler garbo. They made the playoffs and Andrew Wiggins got worse. Just accept that your team is paying a good role player max contract money.
I still think trading Butler was the right move. We were stuck in eighth seed purgatory with him carrying a crappy roster to first round exits. There really weren't many assets there to build around Jimmy. Most of it was caused by poor management in the years leading up to the trade.   For example one disastrous move was trading two picks to Denver to move up and draft McDermott. Denver used those picks to draft Nurkic and Harris. Lavine was also available McDermott's slot. if we came out of that draft with some tradable assets then we can talk about building around Butler.
"It's like a rebirth. Although, when a player fills the box score offensively on a bad team, while entertaining af, I don't take it too seriously. When a player shows little effort defensively on a bad team, I don't take that to heart much, either. There was that one year the Wolves were a playoff team, but even under Thibs and with Jimmy Butler they ranked 28th as a team in Adjusted Defensive Rating.   If Wiggins' defensive effort and contributions eventually do regress to where they are for his career, like majority of Wolves fans have proclaimed, well that's probably the final nail in the coffin in terms of his reputation."
but the jimmy butler ‚Äúmistake‚Äù got you Lavine.....?
PG -&gt; Andy Murray  Jimmy Butler -&gt; Stan Wawrinka
"As a Bulls fan, thank god! No need to repeat our Jimmy Butler mistake."
"I like to pick cool players in the east who I like and watch their games. For example I like Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler so I end up watching a lot of raptors and heat games, and really liked the philly/toronto series. I like bradley beal, too, but I only watch their games when they're playing a good team."
"Don‚Äôt be sorry for them. They had Jimmy Butler with Thibs get them to their first playoff in 14 years, how do they repay them? Chasing them out of town. They still commented on his hiring by the Knicks saying he was the problem."
....You guys had Jimmy Butler and Joakim Noah
Exactly Jimmy butler was waaay more ergieous with it than people think
They need a win now player. Someone like Jimmy Butler perhaps
I mean i really think its a legit criticism if there is any ounce of truth to how Jimmy Butler described the Wolves org as then damn I can understand how you can develop bad culture.
"After a full ‚Äúnormal‚Äù season where there‚Äôs no Covid to worry about, if the Wolves still stink, he‚Äôll request a trade.  Should‚Äôve asked for a player option. He signed his 5 year max in the middle of the Jimmy Butler debacle. Can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt make the contract more favorable in terms of player movement."
"So you're equating the Sixers with Jimmy Butler, to the Sixers without Jimmy Butler?"
So you are comparing the Sixers losing Jimmy Butler   To the Cavs losing one of the two best players to ever play basketball?   Near.
Why did they fire Thibs and Get rid of Jimmy Butler again?
"The only scorer I would take over him is Durant.  I thought maybe you were talking about how he likes to game the system to score his points, but you put Jimmy Butler on here so it cant be that"
Admit Jimmy Butler was right and join the Heat üòà
no jimmy butler has missed half their games with covid and a stiff ankle
"You tellin me that KAT, Garnett, KLove, Jimmy Butler, D'Lo, Cassell, Rubio would not dominate?"
"Jimmy Butler, Rubio, D'Lo, Sam Cassell... theyd dominate"
All he needed was to play with a defensive minded vet like Draymond Green    *checks wiggins defensive rating playing with Jimmy butler*
Him and Jimmy Butler was right are the guys who I notice the most. We can do everything right and they'll still find something to shit about.
"Geez man, 48 hours later and you still want to have this conversation even though you‚Äôre just making excuse after excuse for KAT and not saying anything new. I thought you said good day? Just let it go lmao you‚Äôre obviously dug into your opinion and aren‚Äôt changing it so what are you doing.  Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth that the only way to make my argument factual is to say KAT is not Michael Jordan. Was rookie Ben Simmons so unbelievably great that Embiid gets no credit  for taking that team to 52 wins? Did Jimmy Butler not do exactly this, drag the Wolves to the playoffs as their best player and then after leaving they dropped right back into the lottery? The Nuggets consistently improved under Jokic‚Äôs tenure there and were the second seed by his 4th year.  Sure you can pull out reasons why every single one of those situations weren‚Äôt 100% only due to the best player on the team that I‚Äôve just mentioned, but the absolute best thing you can say about KAT is he once went on a 10-10 record across 20 games. Neat."
Thibs was trying to build around Jimmy butler .  Rosas has been trying to build around KAT
"Fun post!  This took some work to put together.  Was fun to read.  I haven't gone through this in detail, but here's a handful of ones where I would have gone a different direction:  Texas active:  Gimme Jimmy Butler over LMA, even with total career considered.  Last years playoffs alone were enough to push him past LMA if you ask me.     South Carolina active:  Ja gonna give Khris a run for it pretty soon, and I'm a Bucks fan.  Still Khris for now.  Maryland active:  Gimme Rudy Gay over Oladipo.  Numbers and longevity speak for themselves."
"Lol how do you figure it doesn't translate into wins? That's some magical thinking. It translates into, as far as we can tell, about 10-15 extra wins over and above what they would have without him over an 82 game season. Which is pretty standard for players in his tier, i.e. All-NBA players who aren't quite in MVP territory. The difference between someone like Jokic and KAT isn't anything about the players themselves, its about the team he has around them. If you put an All-NBA caliber player on a team with sub-replacement level players, they're going to lose.  And so if we try to make your argument at least somewhat serious and factual, that's all it amounts to: KAT is not (or has not yet been) one of the handful of GOAT-tier generational talents, like Lebron or MJ, who can turn literally any roster into a playoff team by themselves alone. But then, no one ever said he was THAT good, and its not like Jokic or Embiid or Jimmy Butler are that good either."
You Forgot Jimmy Butler (2017)
"They were 1 bounce from OT, and it was game 7. Winner had the right to play against Milwaukee.   Jimmy Butler was just on fire in the 4th of that game.   In OT, who knows what would have happened.  It was the best team the Sixer have had in a very long time, they just got beat by the best Raptors team in a very long time haha."
Cant have a Jimmy Butler finals performance when you play in the West...  His playoff numbers are better than the vast majority of stars too. People just judge him differently from others.
"The greatest thing about Ingram is not just that he‚Äôs incredibly skilled and always looking to get better, he‚Äôs ride or die for his team. He literally punched someone during a game because they were acting up on a teammate (rondo I believe?). When you know your star player is giving his all and also undoubtedly has your back it builds trust and takes teams to the next level. Another good example would be Jimmy butler with the heat."
The thing is if harden had been more consistent in the playoffs I think he could get a pass on the ring thing. Or even if he has a jimmy butler finals performance that would push him into the top 20 all time. But 1mvp and some scoring titles aren‚Äôt enough. I do hope he wins a ring this year tho.
Surprised Jimmy Butler wasn't the pick for Texas. But I dont know much about Aldridge
I also don‚Äôt know if Lamarcus is destined to be in the hall of very good as OP says. Basketball reference currently has his HOF odds at 50.89% (actually over Jimmy butler who has a 43% chance). Whatever formula they use obviously isn‚Äôt a perfect method but I do think he‚Äôs borderline HOF. Will he get in? Ehhh who knows it‚Äôs honestly a good debate but it‚Äôs a bit unfair to automatically enshrine him into the hall of very good IMO
Texas needs some help.  Grant hill is the best player all time from there.  Bosh and lamarcus dont come close to reaching the tier grant hill was in.  Also jimmy butler is the best active player from texas right now unless you want to be real technical and reward julius randle for his start to the year
"Seeing that Donovan Mitchell highlight got me watching old Dwade highlights, and I forgot just how dominant this dude was. It's crazy how he had no real jumpshot, but was still able to get to the rim whenever he wanted too. The closest comparison I can think of is Jimmy Butler with Westbrook's athleticism. If you got some time, check out some Wade highlights."
"I have 1 gripe and 1 note.   Gripe: I think Jimmy Butler is better than Lamarcus Aldridge. If we are going by career of active players maybe. MAYBE. If we go by skill level right now, Jimmy B  Note: I only noticed 1 state that had an Active player that could overshadow the best player. Illinois. AD has a way to go but he could pass DWade for sure. That is really saying something."
"&gt;‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs been effectively our point guard all year long,‚Äù Spoelstra said ahead of Saturday night‚Äôs Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics at Disney‚Äôs Wide World of Sports complex.  &gt;Although Kendrick Nunn had been cast as the Heat starting point guard during the regular season before giving way to Goran Dragic in the opening lineup in the playoffs, Spoelstra said Butler long has been a de facto floor leader.

It was heavily reported about Jimmy butting heads with the older guys on the team due to their loyalty to Rose. Not soon after, Rose was traded.   He most definitely wanted to be the ball handler in Philly.  &gt;Butler admitted to asking Brown to handle the ball more often, but he said he felt it was a mistake to make such a drastic switch:  &gt;""To this day, I don't think that that was fair, to switch over like that. Even though I think we played great basketball like that, I don't think it was fair, because the entire year, Ben had the ball, the entire year, Ben had the ball, so you mean to tell me that in one playoff series you just switch it up like that?

He has said so multiple times."
"Kawhi, Curry, KD and Harden can all impact the game outside of scoring, but that's not their game.  I'm talking about guys like LeBron, CP3, Draymond, Jimmy Butler, etc. Guys that play defense, serve as floor generals and do all the little things for their team to win."
Idk about LaMarcus Aldridge over Jimmy Butler for Texas
"LaMarcus Aldridge over Jimmy Butler is an interesting call. I might just be a victim of recency bias, but I think much more highly of JB."
"Like a mini Jimmy Butler. Just does whatever it takes to win, doesn't mind taking the back seat for others to get their games going, and if no one else is he'll try to will his team to a victory."
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
"Should get in over Randle: Tatum, Giannis, KD  Similar tier: Jaylen Brown, Middleton, Sabonis+ Bam (if they're not  centers)  Randle currently outperforming: Tobias Harris, Pascal Siakam, Jimmy Butler  I think he should make it if he can keep near his current level of play.  IMO the knicks have shit tier point guards and spacing and his numbers don't even do justice to his full impact.  I'm not a big believer in players earning all-star nods because of past achievements, he's been really good and deserves the nod imo."
Can you guys bring Jimmy Butler to games.
"Jimmy and Goran get into a car crash and Jimmy can't afford to pay, so the judge sentences him to be Goran's butler."

"*""I'm Jimmy Butler. Do you speak, uh, in English?""*"
"&gt; How can you say KAT leads his team to a .500 record   They went 10-10 in the 20 games Butler missed that year. That's .500.   Anyways, you're not serious. Your response to the evidence is ""wah wah ah blog boy stat answer""- in other words, no response- and your entire argument is KAT is bad because the Timberwolves are bad. But basketball is a team sport. All the evidence suggests that KAT contributes to winning, at more or less an All-Star/lower-tier All-NBA level, and that he's been on extaordinarily bad teams, except for the one season he played with Jimmy Butler where Butler wasn't going all super-diva trying to get traded.   I mean its such a stupid argument, the guy is 25 years old and the ONE season he had ONE good teammate, they played at a 50 win pace. Its not his fault the Timberwolves front office only managed to put even a *single* good player next to him for only one season so far in his career.   In any case, I've made my point, backed it up, you disagree but can't actually give any factual/statistical/etc. reasons to back it up, so.. guess we're done- good talk mate"
"lmao okay buddy  Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker can't handle Jimmy Butler, but they can KD/Harden/Kyrie, let alone AD and LeBron.  Come on. Don't be stupid."
"I think the answer is that ""culture"" is just a vague term that people use however they want, basically making it meaningless.    Is culture putting together a good team through the draft?  The Heat got Jimmy Butler through free agency...is that winning culture,  but the Nets aren't? How come?"
I look at him like Jimmy Butler. Both were homeless for a while. So they've seen how bad things can get and are a bit fearless cause of it.
"&gt; Jimmy revealed that Goran *acts like he doesn't understand English to get away with cheating in card games* with the Heat, Butler also said that Goran managed to *always distract him while ordering a coffee, resulting in him never actually paying for it*  Also sounds like a recipe for a good Rush Hour type movie."
This just shows Dragic's fighting SPIRIT and ONCE AGAIN a lack of leadership from one Jimmy Butler.
The Jimmy Butler trade has gone from a Wolves win to a Bulls win to a lose-lose trade imo.
"As Jimmy Butler complaints about it, Goran replies ‚ÄúOh? This how we do in Slovenia.‚Äù"
"Jimmy ""Starbucks"" Butler"
Idk. I just remember Jimmy Butler averaging 29/10/9 in one series on 56/27/92 splits. Can‚Äôt remember who it was against though. I just remember it being an great defensive team
"Jimmy Butler didn't sign with Miami to party.  He signed with them to play under Pat Riley and Spoelstra, on a team that took basketball and hard work as seriously as he did.  In other words, he signed with a competent team that wanted to work as hard as he did."
"i think you have unrealistic value on who Oladipo is, he is no Jimmy Butler  truth is he‚Äôs not a top 25 player(and not a top 30 player either tbh but its close) so paying someone like him 30% of the cap is a risk not a privilege and its something more suited to the Hornets or Knicks  if you dont want a good rookie and a promising player like Okpala for him i guess try and see if you can give up Oladipo+Tucker for the two Mavs 1st rounders the Knicks have or work out a sign and trade to the Wolves for D‚ÄôLo"
"Oladipo isnt the only player in the top 25-35 player range that‚Äôs going to be available, not by a long shot  there‚Äôs more reliable players that are also better that become available each season  paying 30% of the Heat‚Äôs cap to Oladipo for 4-5 years isn‚Äôt nearly as enticing as you seem to think, no chance we do it without some chance to move him in a year or two and giving up a incredibly valuable 2027 1st for Oladipo is simply a non starter  The Heat offered Josh Richardson and a mid 1st for JIMMY BUTLER when he was on the Wolves, you haven‚Äôt been paying attention if you think a 2027 1st is on the table"
Goran and Jimmy Butler  Edit: Goran haggling down the price of Big Face Coffee from $20 to free
"Dawg. Giannis lost to a team with a best player who is worse than him and a bunch of dudes acquired via trade or developed by the Heat. What are you saying? The reason the Bucks lost to the Heat isn't because the Heat are in a desirable situation -- the Bucks are MORE TALENTED than Miami. They lost because they got outcoached severely and because Giannis woefully underperformed. This woe is me attitude has to stop from small market teams. They secure superstars and then fail to materialize competent enough teams around those stars.   Miami secured their star and he was surrounded by Bam Adebayo (developed all star), Tyler Herro (rookie), Dragic (traded for YEARS ago), Jae Crowder (traded for), and Iguodala (traded for). Jimmy Butler was signed in free agency, but he's a worse player than a lot of the stars on small market teams... Maybe teams should draft their own Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro, trade for their own Jae Crowder and Iguodala, develop their own quality coaching staff that's up to snuff and surround their home grown superstar with that instead of bullshitting around keeping coaches like Budenholzer as the head of their program.  I mean, OKC had Paul George AND Westbrook and couldn't make it out of the first round... Is that because they're a small market? Kawhi and Paul George JUST LOST TO DENVER."
"That's besides my point, though, isn't it? Jimmy Butler played for a ton of teams. How many made the finals? Giannis is a better player than Jimmy, yet Milwaukee got their ass kicked. Jimmy isn't even a top 10 player in the league lol. Good management AROUND Jimmy is why Miami made the Finals. Small market teams have better stars than Jimmy that they've stumbled into by luck -- where's the good management? Why the fuck is Bud still coaching the Bucks?"
This is why ratings are so shit. Refball bail out guys like Jimmy Butler
Maybe...  Giving up your future to pair Jimmy Butler with Wiggins and KAT is an objectively dumb move. Best case scenario what that team is a second round exit. Why would he want to stay for that anyway?   Miami went to the Finals with Jimmy and the way they did it was by not giving up all their assets.
Well Jimmy butler would probably still be here.  So that would be nice

"Ahhhh okay gotcha - you're talking about strictly stylistically. In that case I see what you're saying. Agreed in that sense, RJ is more of a secondary ballhandler/playmaker - more in the Jimmy Butler ""wing who's a good passer"" than an out and out 'point forward' you want initiating the offense every time down ala Luka/LeBron.  I thought you were saying the people who loudly shouted how RJ was trash last year were proven right. My bad for the premature pitchfork sharpening lol"
Not answering any questions. I‚Äôm right and Jimmy Butler is the goat
"Jimmy"" Ben Simmons"" Butler"
Jimmy Butler three pointers about to be the new Blake Griffin dunks.
"AD last season played 62 out of 72(?) games last season at 35 MPG and then played the entire playoffs.   Meanwhile, Embiid played 51 games, Ben Simmons 57, Jimmy Butler 58, Westbrook 57, Paul George 47... I could go on but I think you get the picture.  Please don't let Skip Bayless's takes cloud your judgment. Do some research. That man is a certified clown who only cherry-picks stats that promote his narrative/agenda and *never* makes a good-faith argument."
Jimmy Butler feeling jealous rn.
"I know I sound like shaq but I‚Äôve seen every defensive built prospect be compared to Kawhi or Jimmy Butler. Okoro, Pat Wil, OG, Culver etc. Just don‚Äôt be disappointed when he doesn‚Äôt develop to a top 10 offensive talent because 98% of the league doesn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad player or can‚Äôt be on a championship team"
Should he be in it? Sure. Should he be in it OVER Donovan and Booker? Fuck no. He's All Star voting is a popularity contest anyway. If it was actually based on stats/performance Julius Randle would likely be over Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo in regards to votes.
All that shit about how jimmy butler was a locker room cancer
"You're a Timberwolves fan, so I don't blame you for not knowing what the playoffs are, but here's why Towns is nowhere near Jokic or Embiid or Anthony Davis in New Orleans:  **Playoff stats:**  **Jokic:** 33 games, 24.7 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 6.9 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.8 BPG, shooting 51%/41%/84% (60% true shooting)  **Embiid:** 23 games, 22.3 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 2.9 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.9 BPG, shooting 43%/28%/78% (55% true shooting)  **Davis (New Orleans only):** 13 games, 30.5 PPG, 12.7 RPG, 1.8 APG, 1.8 SPG, 2.5 BPG, shooting 52%/25%/85% (59% true shooting)  **Towns:** 5 games, 15.2 PPG, 13.4 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.4 SPG, 1.0 BPG, shooting 46%/27%/73% (54% true shooting)  Jokic and Embiid and AD in New Orleans have all been the best players on teams that went to the second round of the playoffs or beyond. Jokic and AD raised their game in the playoffs to a ridiculous level.   Towns can't make the playoffs without Jimmy Butler dragging his ass, and he was absolutely awful when he got there.   Those guys are all way better than Towns in the regular season too. Towns is one of the worst defensive big men in the league. Embiid and Davis are perennial DPOY candidates. Jokic is a better defender than Towns, too, and given their respective physical tools that should really not be the case.   There's just no argument for Towns to be in a tier with those three."

"Lowry is good friends with Jimmy Butler, But Lowry is from Philly.  Do you mean he fits well into Heat culture?"

wtf theres a kid in my school called Jimmy butler
"The best timeline is the one where Tim Duncan came into the league in 1997 and kicked Jordan's ass in the finals, then when Jordan came back for the rematch the next year, Duncan kicked his ass again, sending Jordan into retirement. Then an 8th seed Knicks team went to the finals, and then Duncan kicked their ass too for good measure. Then he kicked Shaq and Kobe's ass in the Western Conference Finals for 5 straight years en route to kicking Reggie Miller's ass, Allen Iverson's ass, Jason Kidd's ass twice, and then the Piston's ass. Then he came back to kick the Piston's ass again for good measure. Then when Shaq ran out of the West to avoid Duncan, he kicked Miami Shaq's ass. Then he kicked Lebron's ass. Then he kicked Kobe's ass some more in the Western Conference Finals en route to kicking Kevin Garnett's ass, and Dwight Howard's ass, and then Kevin Garnett's ass again. Then Lebron formed a super team with Wade and Chris Bosh to try to stop Duncan's reign of terror, and then Duncan kicked their ass for 4 straight years and built a robot teammate in the process. Then Lebron fled to Cleveland to try to form a new super team to stop Duncan, and then Duncan kicked his ass 4 more times for good measure, while also kicking the three point revolution's ass in the process. Then Duncan's robot gained sentience and demanded a trade, getting shipped off to Toronto. Then when Duncan's robot led the Raptors to the finals, Duncan kicked their ass too. Then a worldwide pandemic tried to stop Duncan, but he went to Disney World, and then kicked the Heat's ass after their cinderella run, despite Jimmy Butler having the two best finals games by a non-Tim Duncan player in NBA history."
And Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy plays far and away better defense than Doncic, is much more reliable than Doncic, can tell people where they're supposed to be on defense, and is coming off a great playoffs. The post I was responding to was comparing the two straight up and when comparing them straight up Butler is better right now and I don't care what Doncic projects to be because, again, we're talking about right now."
And the game was lost was by 1 point to the returning jimmy butler and the heat in miami...this is a great stretch
"Yes, he is. Randle and Draymond do make some good cases. I think it‚Äôs hilarious everyone is leaving Sabonis off the all star team this year but he‚Äôd most likely get more All NBA votes than both Randle or definitely Bam (whom has shown to be just a little less important than Jimmy Butler on his own team)."
PG: Sam Cassell  SG: D'lo  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: KG  C: KAT  6th Man: Kevin Love
"You mean the season he had 59 game of jimmy butler or the one where he had 10?  Yeah the 2018-19 season he had a cool 48 games with roco that was fun. Jared bayless started a few games for us back then because Rose and tyus was hurt. Keita bates diop and Cam Reynalds also played a shit ton of rotational minutes for us. All this time Andrew Wiggins was his co star, the warriors are 16-15 with Wiggins as curry‚Äôs co star and way better roster talent than what ever Kat has had"
"KAT 100% does and it doesnt get talked about enough.  He was one of the most hyped young players for a while and he has had such a disappointing start to his career, only making the playoffs once thanks to Jimmy Butler dragging them there, only for KAT to play like shit in the first round and lose.  The guy is one of the most gifted scorers Ive ever seen as a Center but he is soft as shit and doesnt make his teammates better. People will blame his rosters, but other elite players also play on subpar rosters but actually drag them to the playoffs because they are actually elite, like Jokic, Harden, Dame, etc."
I remember Jimmy Butler managin to get one of Jordan Bulls record. It was the most points in a half. Jimmy had to score 40pts in two quarters.
Making a few 3s in one playoff series and being absolutely cooked by Jimmy Butler in the finals isn‚Äôt exactly considered strong
They‚Äôve got what it takes to beat everyone except BKN. They almost beat TOR except for a lucky game winner with Butler/Reddick instead of Green/Curry. Not saying Green = Jimmy but Embiid is better now and so is Harris and Curry is equal to Reddick. it‚Äôs practically the 19 sixers without jimbo
"jimmy butler is known for being calm and collected and never saying anything mean to his opponents, shame on the hornets for encouraging this tomfoolery!!"
Jimmy butler has the second highest amount of 50 point games as a Chicago Bull with 2.   MJ has the most with 30.
you realize that that side of the story is from jimmy butler who forced the team to trade him? taking that at face value is peak r/nba
Derrick rose and Jimmy Butler both as much admitted towns and Wiggins were choads...organization caters to young choads...eventually catering to biggest choad and gets the biggest choads best friend on the team who is also an overrated choad...but seriously this team and player are so far removed from relevancy at the moment...if they kept Butler and the coach they would be far more stable and possibly an annual playoff team....maybe edwards will be the real deal
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I‚Äôd have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
Those are Jimmy Butler numbers yikes
"Back when he was on the tail end of his Chicago days, my buddy and I were walking down Michigan Ave to go to lolla and we see someone walking towards us ahead and I go ‚Äúdude that‚Äôs Jimmy fucking butler right there‚Äù and my buddy‚Äôs like ‚Äúno way that‚Äôs him‚Äù and yes it was indeed Jimmy Butler and he has on the phone so we didn‚Äôt want to bug him or anything but we just kinda said ‚ÄúJIMMY you‚Äôre the fucking man!‚Äù As he passed and he gave us a classic Jimmy Buckets smile and nod and I felt so cool.   Also Jimmy was in a class project with my sister who went to Marquette. She said he did absolutely nothing but was still super cool. Pretty sure he banged her roommate too lol"
Cmon u think it‚Äôs going to change with a new coach. They don‚Äôt have what it takes to win. They are good players but they need a Jimmy Butler
"Word fanatic means: a person filled with excessive and single-minded zeal, especially for an extreme religious or political cause.   Jimmy Butler is a great personality who doesn't take shit from anyone and he's someone that people are afraid to be because of social stigma. It's great to an extent. Obviously you don't want to become a Stan."
"The KD less warriors swept their opponent in the west finals. And Klay only missed 1.5 games while Kawhi was injured/broken down since the bucks series.   There best win was Philly though, looking back with retrospective it makes sense why they went 7. That team with embiid, Simmons, jimmy butler, and JJ. If that team existed right now they would be massive favourites. Only reason they weren't higher seed is because the team was only put together really by the time the playoffs came. It's really an elite team to have beaten, better than plenty of teams who have made the finals."

"Unless people actually follow the bulls/nba closely,  i feel they all still think of LaVine as the ""why would the bulls trade jimmy butler for him"" kinda guy."
Jimmy butler should be added to the list..
Jimmy Butler also had 3 triple doubles this week?  Some masterful performances out of the East this week.
Which pixel is Jimmy Butler?
"is it Thibs fault that Jimmy Butler tried to instill a winning culture into a traditional shitty franchise and it wound up blowing up? I side 100% with Jimmy when that happened, there's no excuse if Jimmy can tell that KAT and Wiggins are not giving what they need to then clearly there were deeper problems with Minnesota than their FO and Thibs in the FO. Jimmy could've worked out great long term, since he left Minnesota he's only been on teams that have done deep playoff runs and Minnesota is once again the worst team in the West so is it really a Jimmy Butler and Thibs issue?"
"jimmy butler was literally homeless as a kid and he's never intentionally injured anyone, why don't you root for him instead  he has the added benefit of actually being good at basketball too"
"And seriously, why did he call Jimmy Butler a legend? All he did was lead a team to the finals and lose. If that makes him a legend I guess Latrell Sprewell is a legend üòÇüòÇ"
"Jimmy Butler, Vucevic, Jrue Holiday, Mike Conley. All bad men. All players who rarely get the recognition they deserve."
To young to remember the pre Moses Malone sixers so I'll go with the Jimmy Butler sixers
Man Jimmy Butler is a baller.
Jimmy Butler advocating for pedestrian safety. Love to see it
Jimmy Butler should be higher
"If you guys only had a Jimmy Butler type or Roco, from a couple years ago, that would help."
Solid team maybe. Great team? Not since KG won MVP. They were marginally good for one year largely due to Jimmy Butler. Not since.
"Oh my god why the hell people still think this unironically?  In their infamous Jimmy Butler season, KAT was T-2 in win shares. He knows how to win but pieces weren't here for the much of his career."
How many casuals do you think know Jimmy Butler before the finals? Bam Adebayo? The finals was already lopsided for the Lakers before Heat players started dropping like flies  It doesn‚Äôt matter if people like the Lakers or not. What matters is if they know about them. People know about Bron. People know about Steph. People know about KD. The ideal scenario is a close series that isn‚Äôt derailed by injuries with big names.
I do agree having Jimmy Butler and Miami does have a big impact on ratings
"Those games were fun as hell, I‚Äôve got no beef with the wolves. KAT throwing games where Jimmy Butler was playing in order to force a trade on the other hand is pretty trash."
"Yeah I don‚Äôt want 80s basketball, but I know Simmons is at best a top 20 player while Magic is an MVP. He‚Äôs played with 2 legit stars/superstars in Jimmy Butler and Joel Embiid and they carried him in the playoffs."
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Nikola Jokic 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Luka Doncic 12. Paul George 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kyrie Irving 15. Bradley Beal  Yeah I know I know Joker too high..... stay sleep man.
"LeBron, Giannis, Harden, Dame, Embiid, Kawhi, Steph, KD, Luka, Beal, Jokic, Kyrie, Mitchell, Tatum, Jimmy Butler, AD, Simmons, Gobert, Booker, KAT, Klay, CP3. You can argue all 22 of those guys are better than PG"
"&gt;Ryan Saunders got Timberwolves fans more free French Dips than wins in 2021 season  Jokes aside..    Why all that LOSSES is on the coach though?  It's fuckin idiotic to blame it all on a coach just because the players are too fuckin SHIT.. Those players get paid millions, but still not good enough to get any Wins  &gt;   But somehow, it's just easier to cut ties and scapegoat a coach.. than to just trade those shit players, and build a better culture for an incept franchise. Apparently   &gt;  Wolves been mediocre for decades.. Only good season they had since Garnett left, was when they had Jimmy Butler.  That's pathetic..   Their fans deserve better, but scapegoating a coach will definitely never change anything."
FREE JIMMY BUTLER!!!
Jimmy Butler. They should trade him to the Bucks for Brook Lopez and DJ Augustin
"‚ÄúAnd jimmy missed a lot of games as well‚Äù ok and? He still played.And did you just equate losing harkless to AD, and or shroeder? Herro is still player a majority of the game. You‚Äôd think jimmy butler, Bam, Duncan, playing 1/2 of game Herro, And igoudala would be able to blowout. Lebron, kuzma, KCP, and the rest of the lakers"
"I wouldn't say it was a good defensive performance either. They were getting caught on a lot of screens, Robinson could've ended up with a much better day.  Lebron was probably the worst defensive player on the floor for the Lakers, somehow. For all the talk about other guys letting him down, and I get that, he was letting them down on the other side. His defense was so bad, guarding the worst shooter not moving to help off Iggy which allowed free finishes at the basket. He got too far behind KO as he cut through, then tried to catch up late when THT had already rotated which resulted in someone else, I think Nunn, having a free cut for a layup.      But I also would not say Kuzma was the only bright spot. We saw Wes can guard Jimmy Butler really well still. Having someone to guard the big wings counts for a lot. I've liked Kuzma this season, but I would not make too much out of this performance. It was good he at least showed he can score on a small, weaker player. I don't think his defensive assignments were any compliment to him, ideally you might give him a look on Butler besides cross matching, but I think they had him chasing shooters which probably isn't ideal for him. He finished 8-21, too."
*Jimmy butler has entered the chat.
that was a very jimmy butler-esque hesitation by Jaylen
How‚Äôs Jimmy Butler working out for Minnesota?
"Irving is already a starter  So already locked was Embiid, Giannis, KD, Kyrie and Beal  Yet to be called out but very likely would be Tatum and Brown, Simmons or Tobias Harris, Bam Adebayo, Gordon Hayward, Trae Young, Vucevic, Middleton, Sabonis, Randle, Vanvleet/Lowry/Siakam, oh and of course James Harden has gotta be a lock.   Of that full list the guys that probably won't make it would be Randle, maybe Vuc or Bam so there is a ton of competition still and I didn't even throw LaVine into the list.   But basically of that list the following teams will have to have an all star just because of their standings and success and those would be Boston, Indiana, Charlotte, Toronto. So that's 4 spots completely locked up with Boston likely being 2 all stars so really 5 spots. Then Harden will very likely get a spot. That leaves 1 spot left now which will be fought for between Middleton, LaVine, Bam, Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Vucevic, Julius Randle. I can see LaVine making it over all those guys just cause of the season he is having but then again the way Beal didn't make the roster last year and Beal was clearly a better player than Trae Young but still Trae got the spotlight at the time. But still LaVine is on a better team and is having a more efficient season from a numbers perspective than Beal was at the time."
Idk did you know Jimmy Butler has played 17 whole games?!
"Right! I think about this once a week.  And I'm not even a Philly fan.  Imagine Embiid, Simmons, Jimmy Butler, and Mikal Bridges. Plus... whoever."
"I generally don‚Äôt like even putting players on lists like these until they retire so I can accurately compare them to their peers in every aspect. Lebron and KD are obvious exceptions because they have balled out since the beginning of their careers.   Kawhi took a little bit of time to get going, but he‚Äôs a super star right now. Kawhi has only had around 5 Top Tier offensive seasons so far in his career. I want to see a little bit more of sustained scoring greatness before I bump him up.   Melo was a bad defender and wasn‚Äôt efficient, but even right now, he can get hot and become borderline automatic. I have seen very few pure, unadulterated scorers like Melo and I respect that greatly. Also a phenomenal technical rebounder when he puts his mind to it like he did in international play.   Luka could blow out his knee a la Derrick Rose and never be the same player again. The NBA is fickle. Some players burn out, some don‚Äôt and go on to greatness. I don‚Äôt even rate Jimmy Butler that high at this point in time. He‚Äôs not even a top 30 or 40 SF of all time."
"It was a dynamic duo of Jimmy Butler and, Kelly Olynyk."
"You see this is what I don't get. It makes sense to compare years of elite play when two players are relatively on the same level. But Kawhi is just on another tier above Melo as a player, doesn't matter how long Melo player for. You don't say Jimmy Butler is better than Luka because he played for more elite years do you?"
Wingspan is just extra surface area for Jimmy Butler to put his body/momentum into
Kuz is trusted enough to guard Jimmy Butler. Gets an and 1 on the other end too. Impressive progress despite a short offseason
So just like Jimmy Butler then? Defense is good but you‚Äôre gonna sit here and act like refs haven‚Äôt blown calls? Cmon
Bron average 40 if he got jimmy butler calls
They‚Äôre really just not gonna give LeBron calls when Jimmy Butler is right there just getting whatever lol
Where is the Jimmy Butler that carried the Heat in the finals gone ffs.
Is Jimmy Butler missing a rebound ? Shouldn‚Äôt he have three ?
"I mean these guys do literally say that I think.   I‚Äôve heard the argument before that they will occasionally try and view it like this, when we look back at this season a year or two down the line, will we say ‚Äúman it was really stupid that Julius Randle was an all-star over Jimmy Butler‚Äù   If the answer is yes they will select the other player"
"He‚Äôs only shooting 44% from the field. Harris, Middleton, Randle, and Bam deserve to be a reserve way more than Jimmy does this season. If Butler gets in over any of those three, then it will be purely off reputation."
"if jimmy butler or luka (based on their last playoff run) had their teams in the position lebron does... the mvp race would be over.  yet, the voters keep rewarding guys like giannis when they haven't proven value, only stats against lesser teams."
If randle doesn‚Äôt make it but jimmy butler does I‚Äôm gonna be pissed.
"Jimmy butler does not have a case, and it is absolutely ridiculous to argue he does.  19/8/8 on 44% shooting is not impressive at all. He's also missed a ton of games and his team is 11-17. If you are a bad team your stats have to be way better. In fact even with a winning record that's not all star caliber stuff."
Jimmy butler
"I guess it has to be luka even though he‚Äôs playing at last years level.  Since I think other 3 are playing better, lillard only debatable one.  Still this year should matter if we‚Äôre basing off past too much isn‚Äôt jimmy butler a fringe top 10 guy too."
Start: Paul George  Bench: Jimmy Butler  Cut: Tatum
Start Paul George   Bench Jayson Tatum   Cut jimmy butler
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. This whole sub pulled out every excuse possible to not watch the game. Lebron and AD figuring it out and the Jimmy Butler show was compelling tv. People assumed it was going to be a boat race so when things tightened a bit they never came back. How one can look at the series and even watch a couple games but still say it was a shit series is crazy to me.
"I cannot understand WHY does defense get overlooked so much when it is HALF the game lol.  How can Brooklyn even compete with Lakers when it's ""Big 3 vs Big 2"" BUT the 2 best defenders are on the Lakers side. So really it's Big 3 vs Big 4, and then the Lakers are much deeper bench wise. So I can't see the Nets winning maybe give them 20 percent chance but it's doubtful that series even goes 7 games.  Now who COULD be the team to upset Lakers???  In the Finals you could see Miami Heat upset the Lakers if Butler is Butler, Bam is Bam, and the supporting cast all shoots 40+ percent from 3 plus they keep up their ELITE DEF in the playoffs like last season. BAM with experience is scary he could match AD possibly, Jimmy can maybe even match an aging LeBron, so it might be cast vs cast and the Heat could have the slight edge if healthy with Precious Achiuwa the difference maker the X factor.  The SPURS??? Yes with Pop coaching and Tim Duncan experience beating the Lakers they can school the young Spurs how to beat the Lakers. Duncan knows how to get inside LeBron head he almost beat him 3 times in the finals. So yes they know LeBron secrets....and then you have the Big 3 of Dejounte, Derozan and LMA who are all very complimentary players. Murray is a DEF beast, Derozan is a leader, and LMA is a Vet. Not to mention the depth of guys like Gay, and Poetl and PATTY MILLS  The Sixers are the BEST team in the NBA this year. They have the MOST depth and the best players. The problem is coaching. Doc Rivers is a choke artist with the Clippers and Celtics. The 2008 win was in spite of him. Awful coach the guy doesn;t have a clue what he's doing out there.  So will the Lakers beat them?? Yes easily only because Doc Stinks. If Phil Jackson was coaching this Sixers team they EASILY win the chip. Embiid &gt; AD, and the Combo of Simmons/Tobias is good enough to match LeBron. Simmons on DEF and transition offense and Tobias with the clutch shooting like his game winner to beat Lakers this year."
"Here's my attempt. I put slashes where I thought there was some debate or was uncertain:   * Thunder: CP3, Harden, PG, KD, Adams/Ibaka.  * Hornets: Kemba, Dell Curry, Glen Rice, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning.  * Pacers: Reggie Miller, PG, Danny Granger, Jermaine O'Neal, Roy Hibbert/Rik Smits.  * Jazz: John Stockton, Donovan Mitchell/Deron Williams, Adrian Dantley, Karl Malone, Rudy Gobert.  * Clippers: CP3, World B. Free/Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo.  * Pelicans: CP3, Jrue Holiday, Brandon Ingram, Anthony Davis, David West.  * Nets: Jason Kidd/Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Vince Carter/Drazen Petrovic, Kevin Durant, Brook Lopez.  * Suns: Steve Nash, Devin Booker, Shawn Marion, Charles Barkley, Amar'e Stoudemire. * Nuggets: Fat Lever/Chauncey Billups, David Thompson, Alex English, Carmelo Anthony, Nikola Jokic/Dan Issel.  * Magic: Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Rashard Lewis, Hedo Turkoglu, Shaq.  * Timberwolves: Stephon Marbury, Sam Cassell, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Garnett, Karl-Anthony Towns. * Grizzlies: Mike Conley, Tony Allen, Shane Battier/Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol"
"You might have forgot because r/NBA is full of Laker fans who have some real fucking stupid takes on Kawhi.   Last year, people were really upvoting comments saying that Jimmy Butler &gt; Kawhi."
Understandable. I cried during Game 3 Lakers v Heat when Jimmy Butler single handedly willed the team to a win
"if you count jimmy and james as the same name, then butler and harden jsut did it on Feb 15 like 4 days ago  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202102150LAC.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202102150SAC.html"
Jimmy Butler opened some of my snaps a while back
Some guy said Jimmy Butler is nothing but a 3-D  player and I was just amazed at the absurdity of the comment
"I've said it many a time, but if he had a Jimmy Butler-esq playstyle, I'd think he was worth his max."
100%.  We don't have a Draymond Green/Chris Paul/Jimmy Butler who forces guys to stay active/aggressive on the floor.
"I mean his best teammate was Butler for one season and they made the playoffs (and he was the main option that year too), aside from that he's played with Wiggins being his ""co-star"" and below average role players and starters like Jeff ""can't make an entry pass into the post"" Teague.  Realistically KAT hasn't had a real chance to show he can lead a team except for one season with Jimmy that was an injury away from being a 3 seed. (Plus this year no one should be putting anything on him considering circumstances even if he wasn't playing well, and he is playing well)"
"We have Jimmy Butler, so I can absolutely relate to how annoying that can be,"
The East runs through ~~Joel Embiid~~ ~~Giannis Antetokounmpo~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ Tristan Thompson
"We‚Äôre the Nuggets not supposed to be a top 3 seed, Jamal Murray MIP but bro isn‚Äôt even half off what he looked like before, Heat looked like the best team in the East but lost to the Clips bench twice even with Jimmy Butler against no Kawhi or PG, bubble was clearly a fluke but rings are rings ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
I will never bet against Jimmy Butler.
If the Heat make the playoffs its not because of Jimmy Butler.  Its cause the Eastern Conference is trash.
Somewhere Jimmy Butler is sipping coffee
It's pretty disrespectful to compare Kawhi to Wizards Jordan who shot 42% from the field and 19% from 3 lol. Statistically Jordan and kawhi are just similar.  Jimmy Butler is similar too but he's obviously not on the same level as Kawhi or Jordan.
can he? he couldn't guard jimmy butler last year and he's not even a quick player. he's a positional player who utilizes PnR.  giannis can't fight through a pick.
"I hate to hold that against him...in his one podcast, I believe with Jimmy Butler, he gave the impression that Elton Brand had no desire in re-signing him. EB, if I'm not mistaking, wanted to go all-in on defense for the playoffs, but we obviously saw how that panned out....  But to your point, he'd be an EXCELLENT bench piece....100% an upgrade over Furlan Korkmaz"
"So the maximum reserve guards in the East would be 4.  I think Harden, Brown, and Young all have better cases than Lavine.  Plus there are 3 front court locks - Tatum, Middleton, and Bam.  So that last spot comes down to Lavine vs Ben Simmons, Vuc, Jimmy Butler, and whoever else. I think he‚Äôs about 50/50. He‚Äôs gotten a lot better this year but I still don‚Äôt know if he deserves it over guys who affect winning more."
Jimmy Butler shoots technical free throws for the Heat even when Duncan Robinson is on the court.
"With all due respect to Jimmy Butler and Heat cohorts, if they can't swim then they are irrelevant to this post which is the new standard for nba relevance."
That teammate: Jimmy Butler
"KAT is one of the biggest disappointments of the last 5 years. He was supposed to be the next great big man but thanks to his trash D, he only made the playoffs once (thanks to Jimmy Butler)."
"Clippers are a threat. Kawhi is a known LeBron antagonist, Lue knows his tricks, PG adds another element, and they‚Äôre improved this year, which means they‚Äôre not the same squad we saw in the bubble.   Mitchell is near the Jimmy Butler range of ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù which is the same guy that carried the Heat to the Finals. Gobert is quite possibly the best defensive player in the league. The rest of the team and coaching is solid af. They‚Äôre going to be a tough out. They‚Äôre kinda like a homeless man‚Äôs 2013-14 Spurs"
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kyrie Irving 10. Russell Westbrook 11. Kawhi Leonard 12. Zion Williamson 13. Jimmy Butler 14. Kemba Walker 15. James Harden
Where are all the Reddit clowns that were complaining that Jimmy Butler and Jayson Tatum made 3rd team all NBA over Middleton last year? This was the favourite blog boi take.
Jimmy Butler being named an all-star this season is a complete joke.
Jimmy Butler being an named all-star this season is a complete joke.
Jimmy Butler being an named all-star this season is a complete joke.
"The talent is undeniable but from the stories we hear, him and the Celtics didn‚Äôt get on for a myriad of reasons. If he‚Äôd just stick to basketball and cut all that other weird shit out, he could easily pull a Jimmy Butler lite in terms of image rehabilitation after his Timberwolves and 76ers stints."
They can't be further from that lol. Without Jimmy Butler they're a 10-12th seed
"Jimmy Butler always seems unstoppable when he's playing the Raptors. People forget because of Kawhi's shot, but Jimmy Buckets almost singlehandedly won game 7 for the Sixers."
Almost like when Kat went to the playoffs with jimmy butler ü§Ø
Zion LeBron Steven Adams Giannis Jimmy Butler
Jimmy butler took a 8th seed team to the finals. Can I say much more.
"Yes Luka is in fact better than Jimmy Butler. If you can‚Äôt present an actual argument other than false stats that aren‚Äôt even true or saying ‚ÄúLuka is 21‚Äù, don‚Äôt bother embarrassing yourself further."
"Joakim Noah was great, I think Jimmy Butler learned a few things from him.  Butler was very quiet and reserved when he entered the league.  Noah was never quiet and reserved in Chicago, I don‚Äôt know how he was after he left.    It helps when you are playing great, though. If you are a rookie trying to get minutes you may not want to make waves.  If you are past your prime, again, you want to be perceived as a good influence, a coach on the floor.  Even great players are sometimes guarded with their language because they want to sell shoes and not offend anyone."
"LeBron, KD, Giannis, Steph, Kawhi, Harden, AD, Embiid, Jokic, Luka, and Dame are the only guys better than him. Then you have guys like PG, Jimmy Butler, and Tatum who are roughly on the same level as him. You‚Äôre either delusional or extremely biased if you think he‚Äôs not at that level."
"I mean KAT had a 65% TS% that year so that helped offset Wiggins incessant chucking somewhat.  With how bad Wiggins was, those 47 wins was nearly a miracle.  Not to mention Jimmy butler being the first in command obviously , taking into account free throws and possessions used"
Jimmy Butler is pretty good. He comes off as down to earth.
As a Heat fan Jimmy Butler ones are fun to watch
Jimmy butler/Joakim Noah.   Man those guys were tough as nails. Our team rn is soft af. No motor at all and are sluggish from the start. Having a guy like those would really help us. We are banking on Garrett temple and Thad young for vet help which is in no ways bad but not ideal.
"You're a Nets fan, there is quite literally nothing you can say that will affect me because I know anything that we do wrong still makes us better than the Nets.

Jimmy Butler is insane.

Alternative title: jimmy butler hit from behind but at the end of the day he‚Äôs the one pumping like an energizer bunny
I love Jimmy Butler so much
Jimmy Butler?
"I kinda want to see a team of dudes above 30 make a run at the Gold. If that's 12, that would be:  F LeBron James  F Draymond Green  F Jimmy Butler  F Gordon Hayward (he'll be 30 in a few days)  F Kevin Durant   G Chris Paul  G James Harden  G Russell Westbrook  G Stephen Curry  G Mike Conley  C DeAndre Jordan  F/C Blake Griffin  that'd be cool"
uhhhh jimmy butler?
"&gt; So much BS spewed in so little time  Hahahahaha  &gt;Use eFG% and you find it's abysmal too for a Center. He shoots like shot, outside of FTs, which he's really good at. Real effective at maximizing FTs too when he shoots bad as he's a good flopper  Yes, he shoots like ‚Äúshot.‚Äù  FTs are the most efficient shot in basketball. Why would he not try to maximize that?  &gt;Jimmy Butler &amp; Simmons also were on that team that went to 7, and Butler &gt; Embiid at the time; Jimmy was also the clear leader of that team while Embiid got locked up so bad that he cried post game that series. They only went to 7 because Embiid got clamped by Gasol and couldn't fulfill his obligation to the team, even tho the Raptors role players were abysmal that series.  Yeah you‚Äôre just trolling. Embiid led the Sixers in plus minus that series. He was clearly the most impactful player on the court.  Did they or did they not take the eventual champions to 7 games?  &gt;Where are you getting the 45.9% playoff numbers? I see 45.9 for the 2020 playoffs, but for the 18 &amp; 19 playoffs (on a bigger sample size) he shoots 42.8 and 43.5 percent, respectively. Average it out and he's below 45%, right?  My bad, it‚Äôs 43.7%.  &gt;You literally know 0 basketball if you're arguing Embiid is better at elevating his team than Orlando Dwight based on assist numbers as a Center. What the fuck? Is this a troll? Are you braindead?   You‚Äôre clearly the troll. Embiid is a far superior offensive player than Dwight.   &gt;Does Sabonis carry his team three times better than Dwight then, because he's averaging 6 assists to his &lt;2?   LOLOLOL nice strawman.  &gt;And '20 years old' was a clear hyperbole, but you knew that. You just tried to hit me with a bunch of 'gotchas', and it failed  AKA you‚Äôre backtracking because you lied."
"He also wasn‚Äôt even really bad in Minnesota.  He is the only one to make the playoffs with that franchise since 2003. In his last season, he got fired at 19-21 and was probably going to lead them to .500 that year if he wasn‚Äôt fired (they started off the season with a very bad record because of the Jimmy situation and were turning it around).  Even in the front office, it‚Äôs not like he did anything terrible. He seemed to want to move Wiggins, but the owner interferes with that. He landed a franchise player in Jimmy Butler. He made some poor draft picks, but outside of that nothing else was really too sketchy from him. It‚Äôs not like he mortgaged their future draft stock.  Compare that to their current GM, who also drafts busts, but sends premium draft assets for D‚ÄôAngelo Russell."
"This is basically ""who is famous/who does the media constantly talk about"" with Jimmy Butler, and Trae Young thrown in. Which isn't to take anything away, but it's also not surprising if you've turned on ESPN any given day over the past couple months."
"So much BS spewed in so little time  Use eFG% and you find it's abysmal too for a Center. He shoots like shot, outside of FTs, which he's really good at. Real effective at maximizing FTs too when he shoots bad as he's a good flopper  Jimmy Butler &amp; Simmons also were on that team that went to 7, and Butler &gt; Embiid at the time; Jimmy was also the clear leader of that team while Embiid got locked up so bad that he cried post game that series. They only went to 7 because Embiid got clamped by Gasol and couldn't fulfill his obligation to the team, even tho the Raptors role players were abysmal that series.  Where are you getting the 45.9% playoff numbers? I see 45.9 for the 2020 playoffs, but for the 18 &amp; 19 playoffs (on a bigger sample size) he shoots 42.8 and 43.5 percent, respectively. Average it out and he's below 45%, right?  [https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203954/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203954/?Season=2020-21&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals)  You literally know 0 basketball if you're arguing Embiid is better at elevating his team than Orlando Dwight based on assist numbers as a Center. What the fuck? Is *this* a troll? Are you braindead? Does Sabonis carry his team three times better than Dwight then, because he's averaging 6 assists to his &lt;2?   And '20 years old' was a clear hyperbole, but you knew that. You just tried to hit me with a bunch of 'gotchas', and it failed"
Butler and Simmons are better than any team Orlando Dwight. Jimmy surrounded by a couple shooters took Bron and AD to 6 games in the Finals
You must rate Jimmy Butler pretty highly as well then?
"I go off the bball ref number because I feel like it gives a better picture of actual impact.   On nba.com he has a 108 def rating for the 2017-18 season, which is easily his worst season of his career .  His numbers were artificially good based on playing with Jimmy butler .   The derived bball ref value gives a better picture imo"
NBA fans: Superteam bad! Rings invalid! It's unfair  NBA fans: Giannis pls come to Miami with Jimmy Butler (Top 10 player superstar who carried the finals) and Tyler Herro (future GOAT)
"Rose vs Philly is the obvious, so I'm gonna go for a more recent one. What if they gave the Max to Jimmy Butler and actually built around him? I feel like it would've gone wrong with GarPax anyway, but I wonder what a good front office could've done around Jimmy here in Chicago."
Jimmy Butler
"**TEAM KESAVAHRAJ**  New expansion team owner G_Kesavahraj immediately earns the support of his fan base after adding a star laden roster that appears to fit very well together. Wings Bradley Beal and Jimmy Butler highlight the group, while BFFs Tobias Harris and Boban earn the fan love on social immediately.  After a 3-3 start to the year, the team finds their rhythm and chemistry. Beal and Butler prove to be an ideal yin/yang, as Beal provides the shooting and spacing while Butler focused on crashing to the line, dishing, and bothering every other wing on defense. Both players average 20 PPG as the team swells up to a 28-20 record midway through the year. Both Beal and Butler make the All-Star team.  At times, the presence of Boban as a starter slows the team's pace down, but with Beal and Tobias Harris the club still feels like they have enough shooting to play a half court game if need be. The club finishes the regular season as the # 3 seed out East.  In the playoffs, the team turns up the gas even more, crushing the feel-good story Knicks 4-1 in round one. Goran Dragic showcases his own scoring prowess in the series with 21 PPG, perhaps having saved up his energy for the playoffs. At this point, the team truly feels like a title threat.  But in round two, the group matches up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis, who may prove a handful for them. Sure enough, Tobias Harris struggles with the matchup, and switching over Jimmy Butler leaves some open holes on the perimeter. Khris Middleton hits 5 threes in game 2, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Bucks.  Now down in the series, all the good vibes start turning sour. Jimmy Butler gives a press conference, blasting the team's defensive effort (and making indirect shots at Beal in the process.) The group responds with a strong Game 3 win, but falls back into old habits in a Game 4 loss. Butler puts the team on his back and scores 31 in Game 5 to pull off another win and take the series back to 3-2. Still, the Bucks' hot shooting ends up carrying them in Game 6, leading to a bitter defeat.   The team licks its wounds and pride after the loss. Surely, they had the talent to compete for a title, but it just wasn't in the cards this season."
Jimmy Butler did it almost every playoff game last year
"Jokic has a lower usage percentage than trae. Does that mean that you think Trey is better than Jokic?  As does LeBron, Kyrie, Paul George, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, and Zion Williamson."
No order btw  1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Anthony Davis 4. James Harden 5. Kevin Durant 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kyrie Irving 8. Paul  George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Joel Embiid 11. Nikola Jokic 12. Luka Doncic 13. Zion Williamson (yes that's right) 14. Chris Paul 15. Giannis  16. Rudy Gobert 17. Donovan Mitchell 18. Jimmy Butler 19. Jaylen Brown 20. Ben Simmons  maybe a healthy KP top 25
"Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Bam Adebayo. my opinion is not biased what so ever  In all seriousness though they will lock you up and throw way the key"
"Don't get me wrong, I would've *loved* Jrue, he might be the most underrated player in the NBA, basically like a smaller Jimmy Butler, but, there's no way we should have matched Milwaukee's offer for him.   You should only offer that amount of picks if you know you have a Top 5 player under control for the foreseeable future, like the Lakers, Clippers, Nets, and Bucks do."
That Jimmy Butler flop needed to be #1... not because it was ridiculous but because him checking to see if the refs saw was just absolutely hilarious.
"Bulls doesn't have the asset to give up in trades though. From the moment Bulls traded Jimmy Butler, their success is always dependent on player development. They got lucky with Zach. But Lauri has been plagued with injuries.   Back then I fantasize playing Lauri at center and AG at PF. Even without Pat Will, I was hoping Otto could stay healthy. Should have been a good fit on paper. But looking at my take two years ago, it really looked bad now üòÇ   Lauri is soft and dude can't be a full time center. Bulls currently don't have an identity. Other than Zach bailing them out in some nights.   I won't really think of fit right now, because Bulls roster is currently full of tweeners. Coby is a PG who is a high volume scorer, who struggles to make plays. Wendell is a center who can't protect the paint, struggles in PnR switches, struggles in the post and struggles to rebound. Lauri can't even stay on the floor...   We just got lucky Paxson stepped down, AKME got hired and Donovan is not coaching. Bulls another year or two of player development IMO. Then maybe they are in position to make trades and supplement their needs. Right only Zach and Patrick Williams can be considered as Bulls core. I don't see any major trades from AKME."
"Yeah he was, they also had Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick, with Jimmy being a leagues better player than Simmons and Harris, that‚Äôs a huge, huge loss for the Sixers. If Jimmy stayed, I‚Äôd have them as East favourites every year."
"Tell me who else is putting up 34/10/4 on 63TS while playing all NBA defense. Against 3 top defenders like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Embiid."
"Even if he's fully healthy there are definitely 15 players better  LeBron, KD, Steph, harden, Kawhi, Giannis, Doncic, Jokic, embiid, Lillard, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Bradley Beal, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Booker"
"Jimmy Butler on the impact of Meyers Leonard's words on the Jewish community, ""I have a lot of Jewish friends. They call me Saul."
"Also the transition to the athletic and larger Small Forward swiss army man.   Even lower tier teams like Memphis with Rudy Gay was in the mix. But LeBron and Durant were having an outsized impact to teams looking for wings that could pass, shoot, dribble, drive, post, dunk, run the half court, run the fast break, complete ally oops...   Throw a smaller defender on them and they were getting either shot over or backed down, put a big and they were blowing by for monster jams. It was great with coaches and players struggling to keep up with these amazing guys except by the opposing guy defending.   * LeBron vs. Paul Pierce * LeBron vs. Paul George * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. LeBron * LeBron vs. Iguadala * LeBron vs. Durant * Kawhi vs. KD (sadly didn't get to see the full picture) * LeBron vs. Jimmy Butler  More too, but these were some gems.   It was a great blend of some teams still having their Bigs (Memphis, Dallas, Duncan) and pace + space vs. more complex creating open shots (mostly 2's), switching defense with also some heavy grinding defenses.   One of my favorite times as. a basketball fan: 2008-2017  At the same time I will say that in the playoffs, a lot of teams try to just jack up 3's and it doesn't work as well."
tb to when TJ Warren and Jimmy Butler were battling on the court now Jimmy wearing his colors
"What he's saying is he will take proven players (e.g. Jimmy butler) over unproven guys (e.g. Zach Lavine) .  Forget about the timeline and what not, just get him good players period ."
I haven't seen anyone mention this yet; remember when this guy played 1 on 1 with Jimmy Butler and jimbo let him hit like 6 straight open jumpers to make it 0-6 and then proceeded to still beat him?
"I never really cared for Jimmy as a Bull, he started to win me over on the Wolves, and well now....I don't have anything good to say about him so I won't say anything at all.   Fuck Jimmy Butler"
"Dwight made the finals in  09 when he beat LeBron James and a scrap of acorns and Old man Paul Pierce and Ray Allen without Kevin Garnett. I‚Äôm talking 2010s. Cousins was more than stats, he even developed his 3 point shot in NOLA. To everyone saying he was empty stats is tripping. No one slanders KAT for failing to lead MIN to wins without Jimmy Butler, Cousins was showing improvement."
Raps looked like they had nothing left if that game went OT. To bad that Jimmy didn‚Äôt get another run on that squad. Although that Simmons/Butler fit was kinda a problem.
I can fully admit that Jimmy Butler was the only reason that series went to 7 games.
"I mean I don't think Jimmy Butler can really replicate what he did in the NBA Finals last year either. It was an all time great performance, but it felt like a ""this is the best I'm ever gonna play"" all time great performance."
"Danny ‚Äúalmost traded for prime Westbrook, prime Blake, PG-13, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, James Harden‚Äù Ainge"
"Who‚Äôs the best player from Texas? Jimmy Butler or Chris Bosh? Trae Young is from here too, so is LaMarcus Aldridge. Surprisingly few ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù from Texas though, but a lot of solid bench players. Can‚Äôt forget College Stations own A.C. Fresh either."
"What‚Äôs your source on lebron being the most dedicated? What‚Äôs your measurement of dedication? Do you think jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt train hard or eat well? Do you think Paul George breaking his leg was an example of poor diet? What about Gordon Hayward? Kevin love was famous for his diet and training and he‚Äôs been barely able to play for years. James Harden has a shit diet and partied late and is a god damn iron man. Is Kevin love just didn‚Äôt training or eating well? A huge part of genes is determining if your body reacts well to training, too. Not everyone can handle the work load, some people develop over working conditions like tendinitis or lose their cartilage. Plus there‚Äôs shit like lebron‚Äôs teammates mocking his diet.   Yes, lebron maximizes his potential. But his potential is defined by hitting the absolute gene lottery. If you ever played sports you would see first hand how working hard is not the greatest determination of success, health, potential, etc. Some guys are born jacked, put on muscle easily, and just don‚Äôt get fat. It‚Äôs ridiculous how much advantage some have. Some guys are just always injured. It‚Äôs just the way life is."
Pg: goran dragic  Sg: bradley beal  Sf: jimmy butler  Pf: tobias harris  C: Boban
"Texas so it‚Äôs a choice between LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Bosh and Jimmy Butler. Jimmy peaked the highest of the three so I‚Äôll say Butler.  Edit: Ignore all that. My dumbass forgot Clyde Drexler."
Jimmy Butler (framed for his wife‚Äôs murder by a one armed man) is expected to play tonight
Jimmy butler
"It's because the Knicks haven't been relevant on the court, so you might as well try to make them relevant off the court. You do this by drumming up crazy hypotheticals like off the wall trade scenarios. Fans do this as well, myself included. I was at the dinner table one night when I blurted out ""Do you think the Bulls would trade Jimmy Butler for Landry Fields? The Knicks could use the upgrade."" I remember almost choking on my chicken pot pie as my Uncle grabbed my testicles. My Dad simply laughed and said ""Keep dreaming, son."""
His career free throw rate is .382.        Trae is .538 this year. Harden is a career .523. Jimmy Butler career .507     Kobe isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as the stars today. Stars today are drawing fouls way more often than Kobe was. That‚Äôs crazy.
what would teams do if like their star player did that? like what if jimmy butler said that? would they release him?
"&gt;	It's impossible for me to hate on Westbrook.  You know, me too. He's one of the most interesting, polarizing players in the game today.   Passion cranked up to 11. Astounding athleticism. Notoriously thin skinned with the fans, which makes abusive fans target him. Same with the media. But also very clean off court reputation, unless I've missed something.   Even in the world of hyper competitive sports where all these guys have been busting their butts for their whole lives to get where they are you still have only a handful of guys like Russ that make the rest of them look like they're not working hard enough.   Jimmy Butler is the other guy in that category for me."
I dont think its completely out of the question that a HoF caliber player drafted 2010+ is going to retire before bron. I could see PG or Jimmy butler getting outlasted by 42 year old lebron whos playing with bronny for fun.
"&gt;This is in part a direct result of the premium on shooting: the guys who are great drivers and finishers but can't shoot from deep don't really have a place in the league anymore.  That's just not true didn't we all just witness [Jimmy Butler put up 40 in the Finals without making a 3.](https://www.nba.com/news/jimmy-butler-triple-double-finals) Jimmy was the first player to do that since Shaq did it in 2002. I would argue that there are definitely places for those guys in the league, guys like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, and Giannis Antetokounmpo have the ability to score but they usually just look and play differently in this area. In this area, those guys have to be a physically dominant point forward type players and are be able to play bully ball in the post and run freely and physically dominant opponents in the halfcourt, or else it's much harder for them to exist. Zion is another good example of this because although he can sometimes shoot the three, he prefers to score mostly in the paint. Another key point to this is being a good free-throw shooter which why I would argue Jimmy Butler is the most prominent and best prototype of this type of scorer in the NBA.   The other type of player that can thrive nowadays without being able to shoot from deep, is a guard, particularly one who is either incredibly athletic and/or skilled whose best skill is usually their vision and passing rather than their ability to score (although most of these players can and do have multiple ways to score but are generally pass-first point guards). Guards like De'Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Luka Doncic, and to a lesser extent Demar Derozan. As I mentioned before these guards with the exception of Derozan (although he has become a much better playmaker in his Spurs era) are pass-first guards which means that they look to make plays and find their teammates before scoring. It's also to note that when most of these guards do score they score either in the paint or the mid-range because they either have the physical strength like Luka does to body other players and easily get to the paint or the free-throw line or they have the handles, athleticism and quickness like Fox, Morant, and Westbrook do to blow pass their opponents to finish at the rim."
"No, that he‚Äôs one of the worst players to get minutes in the last decade. I‚Äôm not trying to argue he‚Äôs some amazing player but before we found out he was a bigot I never heard anybody outside of Portland complain about Meyers Leonard and I also wouldn‚Äôt question the judgement of spo and jimmy butler. If he sucked that bad he wouldn‚Äôt have played for the heat and resigned"
It was a joke from jimmy butler
Because he won the championship. Ran through the West in the playoffs. The Lakers won a record 17 consecutive road games against the West--something even the Warriors never achieved.  And Miami's best player is Jimmy Butler.
"There's ""not having a ring because you got gentleman's swept by Jimmy Butler in the second round"".  Then there's ""not having a ring because you lost to to the GOAT in the Finals twice"".  It's Malone."
Nah he‚Äôs gonna be so well behaved that he calls Jimmy Butler ‚ÄúJimmy Butla‚Äù because he never uses a hard er on anything
Would Jimmy Butler like it if the heat traded for big KAT? BE REAL MY MAN.  You planning on doing any more 3 pt contests in the future?
"Because Lavine is shooting the best despite being the opposing team focus.  Mitchell has Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley, Simmons has Joel Embiid and had Jimmy Butler, Brown has Tatum and vice versa and had Kyrie and Hayward, Booker was the same but now he has CP3.  Who was the best teammate Lavine had? Teammates matter and to disregard that is disingenuous to your own argument."
"While I agree, was it moving the needle? The GM and front office has to have the same goals. Jimmy Butler to the T-Wolves in the West to win now is questionable. If you guys weren't winning at the moment and Thibs traded Barrett and Knox for Hayward or something, are you happy? Even if that gets you a little playoffs at a bottom seed?"
"Its not like trading for jimmy butler is a bad move, jimmy is obviously an amazing player  I'm sure he didn't expect jimmy to flip his shit and demand a trade"
"If this team is formed, my understanding is that they obtain the rights to Jimmy Butler as well...I think it's in the league bylaws or something"
*Jimmy Butler has entered the chat*
Jimmy butler is the goat for getting them to the playoffs
But instead he stayed and won 2 more rings then recruited Jimmy Butler. In the timeframe you drove out the only 2 people that gave you success since KG in Thibs and Butler because KAT and Wiggins were lazy losers
"To be fair, I don‚Äôt think the Wolves expected Jimmy Butler to force his way out in under two seasons."
Jimmy Butler copypasta mainly
Does Jimmy Butler go to the bathroom a lot bc of his coffee intake?
"Theres a difference when defenders actually foul and when offensive players initiate contact to get called for fouls. Theres a reason why Jimmy Butler gets alot of calls and nobody is calling him out. Steph curry actually do that, just not as often as harden, trae or luka.  and when he does He just doesnt get the calls he deserves. But its once in like 10-20 games.  Again, im not saying harden or trae shldnt do it. But it just isnt considered a skill at all lmao even Steve nash said this aint basketball. Pretty sure a 2x mvp knows better than you"
"Probably Jimmy Butler, I love how hard he plays and how he's been able to claw his way to stardom."
What's your funniest Jimmy Butler story?   Also did you fork out 20 dollars for his coffee in the bubble?
Is Jimmy Butler Jordan‚Äôs son?
Is Jimmy Butler the biological son of MJ?
jimmy butler never left sixers
"&gt; Dwade was an ironman like kobe, never got injured, possibly Heat/Cavs ECF in 2007?, He was out for most of the year that time  As I see it, yes  &gt;Brandon Roy/Dame Lillard/Greg Oden big three  Ask again later  &gt;Kobe to the bulls in 06  As I see it, yes  &gt;Heatles go to Bulls instead of heat to team up with Drose  Without a doubt  &gt;Russell Westbrook drafted by the Heat in 11' and keeps his college defense prowess and improves upon it  Very doubtful  &gt;KD stays in OKC  It is decidedly so  &gt;OKC trio stays in general  Yes  &gt;Kyrie and Klove never got injured in 15' finals  Better not tell you now  &gt;Gilbert Arenas playing into this era  Better not tell you now  &gt;Chris Bosh never got his blood clot  Better not tell you now  &gt;Demarcus Cousins staying healthy on either warriors or Lakers and still playing at a high level  My sources say no  &gt;That sixers lineup of Ben Simmons/JJ Reddick/Jimmy Butler/Tobias Harris/Joel Embiid stayed together  Don't count on it  &gt;Curry to the Hornets (or was it Knicks, Timberwolves who could pick him? Any trash team really)   Most Likely  &gt;MJ drafted by the blazers  Outlook good  &gt;KD drafted by the blazers  Yes  &gt;Drazen Petrovic never got into that fatal car accident  Very doubtful  &gt;Steve Nash never got injured on the Lakers  You may rely on it  &gt;Shaq had the drive to improve like Kobe/MJ/Lebron etc  Ask again later"
Didn‚Äôt Giannis foul Jimmy Butler to lose that playoff game lol
Without looking it up it‚Äôs jimmy butler isn‚Äôt it
I know he'll probably never win it... but we need to acknowledge for a second that Jimmy Butler is clearly the most valuable player by the strictest of definitions.
"It‚Äôs never a guarantee. Remember when Jimmy butler claimed he was prepared to resign with Philly only to bounce to Miami?  Granted it was under different coaches and circumstances, but the same could happen with Lowry for all we know"
"Will probably be Jokic or Giannis, with a decent shot for Harden with KD out for so long.  Jimmy Butler might make a serious run at it if the Heat can get into a top 2 seed which is more likely than people think. (Super easy 2nd half schedule)."
"I‚Äôll gladly take the flair if a mod wants to give it. My team is trash right now, but we‚Äôve finally decided to tear down and start restoring. We like that.  Speaking as a fan of a team with 3 titles we can restore our past culture. Your team cannot. (Shoutout Troy Weaver) But hope y‚Äôall get some leadership, cause you fans deserve better. Franchise should have supported Jimmy Butler and maybe KAT would be something other than being the most talented player in the league to not accomplish anything."
"Prime Hakeem without any allstar teammates beating Clyde Drexler, Charles Barkley, Malone, Stockton, and Ewing is more impressive than current Lebron beating Dame, Harden, Jokic, and Jimmy Butler with AD on his team"
In 2014-2015 Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler sometimes had that nickname! haha
Jimmy Butler is lowkey making a run at it
&gt;I kind of like having less adjustment and just have some things left to common sense.  One way I'd look at it is this kind of what role adjustments are trying to do. The idea that it's basically common sense someone who has such a higher offensive burden is more impactful than a 3 point sniper.   One thing they talked about on the podcast is they found the idea of to truly properly gauge impact offensively varies based on role. It's not necessarily one baked in set and stone formula that applies for all. That's part of why they do it.   &gt;just intuit that his impact is largely a reflection of his role.  Yeah I get this it's just sometimes our intuitions can be off more than we realize. One thing I always said about PIPM though and it doesnt just no longer be true at all for LEBRON is I preferred comparing players who had at least somewhat similar roles on teams as opposed to comparing a Duncan Robinson vs Jimmy Butler directly.

Prime DeRozan and Jimmy Butler.
This is a good way to lose your money based on these predictions  Giannis is lower than Embiid and Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt even on the list
Jimmy Butler should be in the MVP conversation
Jimmy Butler
ehhh Outside the year yall had jimmy butler and made the playoffs you guys have had top ten picks like the last 5 or 6 years. I think it will take more than a top 10 protected Rubio is basically only there for  salary purposes
Jimmy butler and all star snubs. Happens every time
Jimmy butler in the last 9 games has attempted almost 100 free throws.
"&gt; Miami's 1st round pick was seen as valuable in 2019 when the team didn't have Jimmy Butler and Bam hadn't developed yet so your point is absolutely not comparable to the Minnesota situation.  I didn't say it was, but keep kicking that strawman's ass  it also had already been traded multiple times by 2019  &gt; No GM will trade them anything of value at the deadline for a pick that has the 60% chance to be the 4th pick and you know people around the league know that this team isn't this bad when everyone is healthy.  Who knew goalposts could move so fast?! I guess just ignore your own quote and change the argument when it becomes obvious how ridiculous it is lol   So now your stance is that teams would rather have second round picks than minnesota's first, despite the fact that it is mathematically impossible to end up below any second round pick? because that's what half the teams in this article you're commenting on are asking for"
"&gt;Miami's 2021 unprotected first was traded four times and they just made the NBA finals. Teams care about even the miniscule change something could go wrong and it could be a top pick regardless of your team's prospects.  Miami's 1st round pick was seen as valuable in 2019 when the team didn't have Jimmy Butler and Bam hadn't developed yet so your point is absolutely not comparable to the Minnesota situation.  &gt;My ""entire argument"" is that your assertions that 1. the warriors have no assets to trade and 2. that ""no GM"" would trade for a pick that might not convey that season is patently ridiculous when we're talking about a pick that was already traded without the guarantee it would convey that season lol  No GM will trade them anything of value at the deadline for a pick that has the 60% chance to be the 4th pick and you know people around the league know that this team isn't this bad when everyone is healthy.  It's not the 2025 1st round pick where D'lo and KAT could dip but next years."
"I mean Dame is leading a team down two of it's best players two a better record in a tougher conference right now. He's single-handedly carrying his team to a playoff berth.   I think it has a little more to do then being well liked, also were you not around this sub during the bubble? Jimmy Butler is incredibly well liked dude."
Remember how the Jimmy Butler bulls would literally always beat the DeRozan Raptors back in the day to just an absurd degree. 55 win Raptors people would be talking about the need for them to ‚Äúduck and avoid at all costs‚Äù the .500 average and often miserable Chicago bulls

Jimmy Butler is my favourite player in the NBA
"You can just admit you didn't watch the series. Ben got plenty of plaudits for how well he defended Kawhi. Kawhi was also playing some of the most incredible basketball I've ever seen, lighting up an all NBA defender in Jimmy Butler, and solid defenders Tobias and Ennis.  He didn't guard him game 1 but from game 2 onwards he couldn't get anywhere much on Ben and mostly attacked other people. When he attacked Ben he was hitting crazy contested mid rangers which you have to live with. The footage is [all there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFk83GD7fko), and the stats are there too.  Vs Ben Kawhi [shot 20/50](https://go.nba.com/lr6c) with 7 shooting fouls drawn, and 5 assists vs 6 TOs."
Jimmy Butler as SG is so much better than washed up Rondo
"Couple of reasons. The coaching carousel (4 head coaches in 6 years IIRC) didn't help for sure, and the longest tenured one we had was not able to connect with his personality. Wiggins is a very chill guy, but as Sam Mitchell said, didn't react well when you tried to dress him down in front of everyone. He didn't rise to the occasion he shut down instead. Thibs is a yeller. Add in that when we brought Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague in it put Wiggins in a position as a catch and shoot player in a low ball movement offense he would just disconnect from the game. That disconnect would transfer on defense, and he would just not pay attention to his man at all. After Thibs, Wiggins did play a little better but he was still inefficient, he would decide before he got the ball what play he was going to make, it lead to a lot of poor choices. There are technical issues he had (like his dribble being too high so he got the ball stolen from him a lot) but more his struggles stemmed from him just not being aggressive enough to be the #1 option."
Jimmy Butler
&gt; But I don't see how they any better than when they had Jimmy Butler  Competition is worse.   Philly's chances will all come down to Embiid. Can he stay fit and/or can someone stop him.
"lol, Rondo‚Äôs my 2nd favorite player (only behind Jimmy Butler) and I always hated how much people criticize Rondo in the regular season.   Like yeah, the dude doesn‚Äôt care about the regular season unless he plays Boston, but playoff Rondo is a real thing. You need high IQ plays and players, both of which Rondo brings to the table."
Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt on par with Kawhi? Dudes a winner and one of the best personalities in the league
"Idk man, I'm just not seeing it with Philly. Sure Embiid has been great. But I don't see how they any better than when they had Jimmy Butler.  They still don't have a closer or someone who can get them into half court offense late in games during the playoffs. They are benefitting from an easy schedule.   I don't see how the Nets aren't the clear cut favorites in the East. **They are steamrolling the entire league without Durant**"
The people saying Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt worth a max contract after his last season with the Sixers.
Yeah we were forced to trade jimmy butler for josh Richardson that‚Äôs absolutely fucking us over. And kawhi brought Toronto a championship how is even the same. Plus I have seen raptors fan be a little salty about kawhi leaving them as they should be. I don‚Äôt see how my comment was so stupid other than jimmy butler is on your team so you like him
1. Goran Dragic (All Star (sub-in) like 2 seasons ago) 2. James Harden (MVP and multiple NBA scoring leader) 3. Jimmy Butler (Averaged 26.2pts in his only Finals appearance to date) 4. Kelly Olynyk ( 3&amp;D player (needs work on both tho) ) 5. Bam Adebayo (last year All-Star whose young with a very high ceiling IMO)     Pretty decent starting squad but they definitely lose their depth in the process. Not so sure it would've been worth it.
"Jimmy Butler has missed 14 and KD has missed 19. PG has missed 11, no one else in contention has missed over 10"

"Jimmy Butler deserves a max contract on whatever team he is on. The Sixers would not give him that.    The team lacked leadership and direction at the time which Jimmy didn't vibe with at all.    Before the Heat, Jimmy had never got to decide where he was playing while also not getting the full respect he deserved. He was a huge reason ya'll even made it that far into the playoffs that season.    But a better question would be: how did he fuck over the Sixers? I want to hear your answer for that."
Tbf we turned Butler into Saric and RoCo and then turned RoCo into Beasley and Hernangomez. It‚Äôs not like Jimmy walked for nothing.
In an alternate universe Jimmy Butler is an amazing CB or Safety in the NFL
"PG: Stephen Curry  / Chris Paul / Luka Doncic  SG: Klay Thompson  /  James Harden  / Damian Lillard  SF: Lebron James  /  Paul George  /  Jimmy Butler  PF: Kevin Durant  /  Draymond Green /  Derrick Jones Jr.   C: Anthony Davis  /  Nikola Jokic /  Joel Embiid  There's nobody else I'd want catching garbage time lobs besides Derrick Jones Jr. He's my 15th man, I can't imagine being convinced otherwise. His dunks are too good and he's an elite put-back player. Just nice guy to have on the team.   I made sure to have a playmaker, a shooter, and an elite defender at each position so that the team can essentially play any playstyle and succeed. Can use dominant post-man, traditional ball movement, heliocentric offensive-creator etc. Could even go with a twin towers lineup by sliding AD to the 4."
It seems like after the whole Jimmy Butler controversy no one has said anything about KAT or really anything about the Timberwolves except for the fact they suck.
The Wolves traded Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen for this dude and 1 season of Jimmy Butler.
"That‚Äôs fair. But out of Bron, Giannis, Harden, Kd, Steph, Ad, Embid, Jokic, Luka, Dame, Kyrie, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, who can Middleton go above? Plus there‚Äôs still arguments for Jaylen Brown, Ben Simmons, Beal, Lavigne, and Mitchell over Middleton."
"Hey man! I could have said Jimmy Butler is Black Jesus (he might be), but I‚Äôm trying to be objective. Hahahaa."
"Jimmy Butler, then he wouldn't have been on the sixers and he carried them that series."
"I know. I took him off for Jokic. I have Lillard 11.   The point I was making is Beal isn‚Äôt top 10. I think Lillard is better, Jimmy Butler is probably better, Simmons and Tatum are pretty close."
"Jimmy Butler no questions asked. He has a truly inspiring story, he cares about the game and his teammates regardless of the hate. He transforms players into winners and is humble with his faults. True leader that‚Äôs always fun to watch, I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how he literally does everything on the court and is super smart while doing it"
"Wilt slept with 20,000 women and all he got was Otto Porter Jr.  Michael Jordan, far less promiscuous, got Jimmy Butler.  GOAT."
"Jimmy Butler poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses.  And I couldn‚Äôt be happier."
PUT JIMMY BUTLER IN THE MVP CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW
jimmy butler is the best locker room cancer i have ever had the joy of watching in my pathetic life
"I think Ben would be better on a better franchise with a better coach. He probably needs to be in a Jimmy Butler role, to be honest. They've actually setup the Sixers to be successful this year with the shooting they've added. Last year was a disaster even before the injuries."
"Melo is super flashy and fun to watch, so he‚Äôs easier to spot than Gordo. Especially if you don‚Äôt watch a ton of games.   It‚Äôs definitely close, but I‚Äôd say that Gordo is still the more impactful player. He just does all the little things right and is probably the steadiest players I‚Äôve ever seen on the Hornets. He‚Äôs also able to get a good shot whenever the Hornets are struggling, which means that we rarely have long stretches where we can‚Äôt do anything. Hayward is *really* similar to Jimmy Butler in how he plays, though Butler is a bit better"
Jimmy butler and bam are untraceable
"Its been a really annoying past couple years as a Bulls fan having to convince everyone of our players value from people who never watch us but have strong opinions on our players ability.   Bobby Portis, Zach Lavine, Tony Snell, Justin Holiday, Jimmy Butler if you go back far enough. The list goes on on separate accounts I've taken mad flak for just saying they're not the trash this sub acts like they are.    It really killed my engagement on here. Everyone just assumes you're a homer &amp; writes you off. Whats the point of discussing my team if somehow /r/NBA always knows better?   I wish there was a sub where we could regulate who could comment based on some way to validate if they were watching games and what games they were. They would still be able to comment but you could easily check &amp; see ""Oh they've only been verified as watching 1 Nets game this season, their opinion on them is probably malinformed &amp; can be written off."" Its authoritarian but I think the discussion &amp; content that would arise from such a thing would be really unique &amp; insightful instead of just ESPN on reddit."
Imagine current Jimmy Butler with 2015 Kawhi defense.
"One of Gordon‚Äôs best attributes is that he can score at will whenever we need a tough basket, but he doesn‚Äôt need to score all the time. It lets the rest of the team get on a roll, cause he isn‚Äôt monopolizing the ball. He‚Äôs also good at all the little things, so he‚Äôs a big plus whether he scores or not. Jimmy Butler is definitely a good comp"
"Bounces around knicks fans media bubble, and the occasional fan rushes to r/nba to make another thread that gets shot down in /new  Same with ‚Äúis Jimmy Butler an mvp this year?‚Äù bouncing around the Heat bubble the last couple days"
Majority of people recognize you have a problem. The fact that you included Jimmy Butler is hilarious. Just quit.
Jimmy butler will lose it if they lose Dragic
"If Utah ends up with best record by far, it seems many people will not want to only give them one player in the 3rd team. League leader in points per game has always been, as I remember, always at the lowest 2nd team All-NBA, but I think Beal's situation my be an exception. So I think Kyrie, Mitchell, Devin Booker, Chris Paul and Beal all are close. I guess I could bet on Beal because he probably has the least of ""shared vote"" with others.  Paul George has a great season, I think he'd be there. Also they can count Anthony Davis as forward I think, last season it was totally possible so why not now, he could get votes over any non-star players. With the missed time he might miss it anyway though, because Jimmy Butler is playing fantastic.   These are the doubts I'd say, the other guys in this list are basically sure bets to be All-NBA."
"Nice selections. This is what I've come up with while trying to take into consideration individual stats, team success and games played/minutes.      |Team|Player|Position| :-:|:--|:--|.    |1st|Damian Lillard|G| |1st|Stephen Curry|G| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F| |1st|LeBron James|F|.   |1st|Nikola Jokiƒá|C|.   |||.   |2nd|James Harden|G| |2nd|Luka Donƒçiƒá|G|.  |2nd|Kevin Durant|F| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|F|.   |2nd|Joel Embiid|C|.   |||.  |3rd|Chris Paul|G| |3rd|Kyrie Irving|G|.  |3rd|Jimmy Butler|F| |3rd|Paul George|F| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|C|"
"Bro it‚Äôs like 1am and ive been drinking and I‚Äôm on mobile and I just don‚Äôt care enough about this to quote you lol. We‚Äôre debating how good his loss was like why? He lost lmfao Lebron averaged a 33 point triple double one finals and guess what nobody cares cuz he lost lol. Have Butler win one and talk to me about how good he is in the finals. ‚ÄúHe had an all time carry job‚Äù yeah he carried his team to a loss lol. Also if we‚Äôre talking injuries you don‚Äôt bring up the fact he played against a pacers team without Sabonis, and Bucks team without Giannis (he actually played fewer minuets in that series than Bam did in the finals, so if you don‚Äôt count Bam in the finals you can‚Äôt count Giannis in this series) and a celtics team without Hayward(again less mins than Bam in the finals), all while the Heat were at full strength. Please keep telling me about how hard the heat had it lmfao. Jimmy is a great player, but he‚Äôs not even sniffing top 5 and I‚Äôm done with this convo BC I can‚Äôt keep hearing you spout the same shit about a guy that you very clearly love. It was nice talking with you tho, all love here ‚úåüèº"
"sixers fans trying to downplay embiid so simmons can win DMVP, lol  Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in the league, but unless you're peak Kawhi, you aren't as valuable as an elite interior big.    Ben is a great perimeter defender (with room to grow), but he's not at Kawhi level. He's likely not at peak Paul George level right now.  ||Peak|Games|DBPM|DPIPM|DLEBRON| :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| |Ben Simmons|2020-2021|88|+2.2|+1.6|+1.65| |Kawhi Leonard|2014-2016|202|+3.1|+3.5|+3.30| |Scottie Pippen|1994-1995|151|+3.1|-|-| |Tony Allen| 2011-2013|209|+2.7| +3.0|+2.55| |Paul George|2013-2014|159|+2.5|+2.5|+2.38| |Jimmy Butler|2014|67|+2.0|+2.1|+1.65| |Andre Iguodala|2011-2012|129|+2.0|+2.4|+2.0|. |Andrei Kirilenko|2005-2007|180|+3.2|+2.6|-| |Metta World Peace|2002-2004|197|+2.3|+2.2|-| |Draymond Green|2015-2017|236|+3.2|+4.1|+3.75| |Rudy Gobert|2017-2019|218|+2.4|+4.2|+4.15|  Embiid is the best defender on the Sixers. If anyone is gonna take a defensive MVP from Rudy in the next couple years, it's gonna be Joel (Unless Ben takes another leap)"
"I don't think Harden is that good. He was on a good team for a long time as a really good player. I don't think he takes the Rockets from 15 wins to 55 wins like LeBron did Cleveland. If he joined Cleveland in 2015 instead of Lebron, they got to like 35 wins, and if he wasn't on the Rockets but they had the same roster they get like 35 wins instead of 55 wins (I guess he's like a +20 games versus +40 games). And beyond this, some of the more important wins come in the playoffs. Harden lost to some great teams but great players usually overcome great odds. Miami went to the Finals the first year Jimmy was there. Rockets never went to the Finals and only had one great Conference Finals showing.  Miami without Butler, even with Bam in (though not the full roster) was 4-10, but with him they're 16-8. Does Harden have the same flip? I don't know. Miami does have offense problems, but it's hard to believe that he has that turn around being that the Nets have the worst rated defense in the league.  This is all subjective in the end, unless we as a community agree to what counts as better so not sure why we're even discussing."
shaq and jimmy butler as well
Sixers may have made the playoffs once Ben and Embiid got healthy but they didn't really hit that level of culture change until they had that season of Jimmy Butler.
I think most of the guys on your team have picked up the scoring slack so gordon doesn‚Äôt need to go out and drop 30 every night anymore like earlier in the season. Kinda like Jimmy Butler.
Not sure if he‚Äôs in a slump. I think most of the guys on your team have picked up the scoring slack so he doesn‚Äôt need to go out and drop 30 every night anymore like earlier in the season. Kinda like Jimmy Butler.
This is totally ignoring things like Spo being arguably the best coach in the league and Butler being surrounded by an all NBA defender and 3 elite shooters. Jimmy has 3 shooters better than any shooter on the Bucks lmao
I got that straight from Jimmy Butler when he did the JJ Reddick podcast and he said it. He didn't boast about killing them or anything he just said he took one shot and the game happened. I've never heard anyone in the NBA say the story was fake. So I really don't understand what point you are trying to make.
luka being better than jimmy butler is a r/nba nephew take
"Jimmy Butler. He isn't a born superstar like Magic, MJ, Duncan &amp; Lebron."
"I would be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt reach that level. I feel like that‚Äôs his floor. When he adds a mid range jumper, improves footwork to do fade aways, I can see him play like a better offensive version of jimmy butler."
I would put Butler at the lowest as the 11th best player in the league but there are ways to put him higher.   You could argue he‚Äôs better than Giannis and Embiied. I mean after all...look at the bucks series. Jimmy was playing games with Giannis and made him miserable. As for Embiied...Jimmy Bullied him last season and in the playoffs vs Toronto in game 7 he took over while Embiied and Simmons fell back because they weren‚Äôt ready for that moment.
I think there‚Äôs an argument to be made that Butler is a potential top 5 player when he plays with ‚Äúthird stringers and rookies‚Äù but it would still be a hard sell for most people.  Although...really the finals showed what he‚Äôs capable of in that position. He took Lebron and the lakers to 6 games with an injured Bam and Dragic who were the leading scorers for the pacers and the Celtics.   Game 3 and 5 jimmy was an absolute monster. Real talk though if Bam and Dragic were healthy i think it would have been a 7 game series.
"Hey dude, good question. He was seen as a slasher who needed to get better shooting but with a high IQ. That high IQ has translated into some excellent passing moments from him. He does need to become more reactionary and instinctive on the score / dish decisions. He‚Äôs still certainly a scorer but hopefully will develop into a Jimmy Butler type who can drive, finish, dish, draw lots of contact in the lane, and nail enough of his open shots to keep you honest and make you pay."
"So real talk...I live in Illinois and love the bulls. It‚Äôs unfortunate that nonplayer choices(FO and Owner/President) are holding them back but the next best thing is to watch former Bulls stars flourish. Thibs,Rose and Butler are all in good positions right now.  That heat vs bulls game yesterday was incredibly fun to watch. Especially because Jimmy was trying to send a messege to the FO through that game.   The bulls are probably my 3rd favorite team to watch this season though and the Roster is growing nicely."
You're telling me the guy who we knew was going to be an all star when he was 16 years old wasn't a top 10 genetic prodigy of all time? This is a hot take. Maybe you're thinking of Jimmy Butler?
RJ has the same type of athleticism and build as butler. I think he has a slightly higher ceiling just being ahead of where jimmy was at the same point. I completely disagree on his passing. He‚Äôs a. Restive willing passer who just has to play next to elfrid Payton.
"As someone who lives in NY and has multiple friends that are knicks diehards:  Yes they picked the worst year to finally get a good coach and start being competent. However there's no telling how good a winning culture is for player development. Look at Jimmy Butler, he was an end of the bench guy for his first year or so and then as rip hamilton got injured he was put in the line of fire and had to work through playing the game the right way in order to get minutes from thibs."
"Chicago Jimmy was handling point a ton actually. That aspect of being the ball handler and facilitator always been there with Butler since Chicago, most notably in those seasons with Pau Gasol"
Kat compared to Jimmy?  Lmao.  How quickly we forget Jimmy guarded KAt in the infamous 3rd stringer game and kept yelling at him he as soft.  Jimmy Butler is Your Father is maybe the greatest song of all time.  Froggy Fresh should have made a remake with KAT instead of Lebron
RJ is scoring wing but he‚Äôs shown that he can make advanced reads on the floor. He‚Äôs a great secondary ball handler because he can organize an offense and make plays for others but he‚Äôs not a traditional point guard. He‚Äôs similar to a player like Jimmy Butler imo.
"I know this has come up before, but my biggest hope for RJ is a Jimmy Butler style of play: huge menace on D, uses his smarts and timing to start drawing fouls. He's already showed some clutch prowess internationally. Canada/Knicks need it."
"Lmao, Lebron and Harden turnover the ball a lot when teams wall them off but you think Jimmy is no where the scorer or passer would succeed lol? bruh. You do know teams walled of young lebron and even went under his pnr even in Miami?  The reason teams don't wall him off is because Jimmy at best will average 25ppg in a series, you defend Giannis like that and he is averaging 35ppg. It's almost comical because walling of Giannis the last 3 seasons would still mean 25ppg on 58% TS which would still be as good as all but one series from Jimmy Butler."
"Everytime yall get a lead, you give it right back up and Jimmy Butler will see that and take advantage of it"
He‚Äôs jimmy butler
"Giannis finds shooters well enough, he does not have to be Lebron lol. Bucks shooters get a lot of open shots from the wall but the problem once again is they are inconsistent and no one is as feared as Duncan Robinson. Teams were probably just as scared of Robinson as they are of Jimmy last year. Duncan could set a screen and two would go his way, no one on the bucks got that type of attention and Middleton does not play off ball in that manner. Giannis ""problem"" is he is the most dominant paint scorer in the league and can sleep walk to 30ppg on 20 shots. Giannis obviously needs to add more to his game but making it as if Butler is Lebron is ridiculous (he is not much of a better passer than Giannis). Also if you crowd/send help at a player they are more prone to make bad passes."
" There are numbers for this type of shit. Butler is a 40% jump shooter and that number is worse when he is contested. If you think Jimmy taking jumper keeps opposite teams up you are crazy. Teams are willing to sell out because ""Giannis is so great"" not because it works lol. if you are willing to concede 3 pointers to stop one player, that should tell you something but you guys can't seem to think critically. This would not be a discussion if Giannis played with great enough shooters that would constantly hurt them of this decision."
Is this really a joke? You can use this same concept with Lebron nephew. Dont even mention Jimmy Butler in the same stratoshphere of shooting with Harden and Kyrie. Jimmy Butler is literally left open and dared to take a three. Harden is doubled from halfcourt because defenses are scared of his stepback. Kyrie had that one bad shooting playoffs with Boston but that was an outlier stop it nephew.
PG: 23/6/5 on 64 TS%  Jimmy Butler : 21/7/8 on 57.5 TS%
1st Team: Ben Simmons Fred VanVleet Jimmy Butler Giannis Gobert  2nd Team: Jamal Murray Dort Covington Bam Embiid
"Yeah, but walling off Giannis works, because he isn't as versatile.    He can't shoot or playmake nearly the same as Butler. That gap is bigger than the scoring gap between the two. In the playoffs, when teams really lock down, Giannis just isn't versatile enough to impact the game as much offensively. Jimmy can score almost as much when he needs to. Man almost averaged a 30 point triple double in the finals, severely undermanned and outmatched.    I'm not saying Giannis is a one-trick pony, but against elite teams in the playoffs, he's much more limited."
"&gt; You know who else should be clowned for not trading for Kawhi? Every team that could match an offer of Demar Derozan.  Well, every *Eastern* team anyway, as Pop was extremely adamant that he would not trade Kawhi to the West. But this is my point with Ainge: just look at what the trade packages were for Paul George in Indy, Jimmy Butler in Chicago or Minnesota and Kawhi in San Antonio. The Celtics could have *easily* beaten every one of those and still had a shitload of assets/players left over. The fact that they didn't get even one of those guys is a huge red flag, don't you think?"
"Lol what, nothing against Jimmy Butler but KAT deserves to be compared on the same tier as an AD or Embiid/Ben Simmons type guy"
"**Jimmy Butler Trades:**  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(CHI) FOR Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn, Lauri Markkanen(MIN)  - Jimmy Butler, Justin Patton(MIN) FOR Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 2nd round pick  The Wolves came in with good intentions but came out worse with both Butler trades"
"I mean, Jimmy Butler looks like Jamie Foxx.  Oubre and Cedi are also not ugly despite their giganticism."
The episode with Jimmy Butler at TWolves practice is Breaking Bad level quality
"personally I'm a kind of neurotic workaholic and I kind of like Jimmy Butler. I don't mind that kind of climate and might even savior it-- so I don't really agree that there's no mentorship or development, but I understand how it's not for everyone."
"He‚Äôs not near them offensively though, and that‚Äôs more important. Nobody says Jimmy Butler or Paul George are better than Steph and Harden"
"dude he had Rose, Boozer, and Deng who were all top 10 scorers for their positions and Noah was one of the best facilitating bigs in the league. those teams had plenty of offensive talent   oh yea and there was this jimmy butler fella"
"On the one hand, I don‚Äôt believe this shit. On the other, it is Jimmy Butler. Is our belief greater than his drive or petty competitiveness? I leave that as an exercise for the reader."
of course it‚Äôs the Sixer fan who‚Äôs got notes on Jimmy Butler
"They were just in the Finals, kept their keep players, the young guys now have playoff experience, Jimmy Butler. Brooklyn's ascendance notwithstanding Miami still looks good for a run"
I think to be a title contender they need a top 7 or 8 player. Jimmy Butler is good but if he's your best player you don't have enough.
Holy shit Jimmy Butler looked good when he was on the Timberwolves. Man is sexy.
Did you know Jimmy Butler has Thanos on speed dial
"Oh for sure scuffling but still at league average or a little better from 3. He isn't Jimmy Butler from 3. Still, he could just be done. Who knows."
Does this make Jimmy Butler Thanos
Jrue is smaller Jimmy Butler
They are also 20-13 when Jimmy Butler plays. They're 12-2 when he scores 26 or more.
"He was given the opportunity to be the man his first season, he was given KAT as a teammate his second second finally he was given Jimmy Butler and a well known coach in Thibs. The man failed at every opportunity and looked disinterested on the court constantly.   He had access to NBA facilities, to a coaching staff dedicated to him etc. You can blame his career solely on him."
The Miami heat offense is basically Someone sets a screen handoff to duncan robinson at the 3 OR jimmy butler (when he feels like it ) drives the ball and gets the foul call OR bam score a little jump shot from the paint .. there that‚Äôs the offense . occasionally you get tyler herro to shoot some pull ups but dude has been getting too much head this season and his legs seem drained.  Dragic occasionally will hit a 3 pointer and then hit the bench. Nunn well he could hit the little pull up but he needs to play more minutes to get into his groove .. that‚Äôs the offense guys
"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/07/14/report-security-called-to-jimmy-butlers-hotel-room-because-of-workout-dribbling/amp/#aoh=16172558995788&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s  Even NBC makes a tongue in cheek reference to the fact that Jimmy loves to bring attention to himself, saying there's a non-zero chance that he called security himself. Either Jimmy is a completely unempathetic asshole or he was dribbling a basketball around his room to bring attention to the fact that he was working out. Even Matisse Thybulle had his workouts in his vlog and they didn't require loudly dribbling a basketball in his hotel room.   https://www.businessinsider.com/jimmy-butler-heat-practice-330-am-2019-10  It doesn't really matter how they started. The thing is that Butler always has to bring attention to how hard he works. Every rumor or story you have heard about Jimmy Butler in the past five years is spread by Jimmy Butler. There are other stories like how Rondo called him and Dwade out for trying to air team drama with rookies, his feud with KAT, him refusing to let Rubio talk to his old teammates, plenty of rumors of him beefing with Simmons and the staff of the 76ers except for Embiid. Dude comes off as disingenuous because he's always trying to get good media coverage of himself. He did the infamous Wolves practice and literally immediately did an interview with Rachel Nichols to try to make everyone else look bad and he continues to embellish details about it, even three years later. On the podcast with Reddick he talked about how he loved being with the 76ers and refused to sign with them that offseason."
Let‚Äôs take a look at the last few finals appearances and who their best player was:  Lebron beats Jimmy Butler.   Kawhi beats Curry/Durant  Durant/Curry beats Lebron  Durant/Curry beats Lebron  Lebron beats Curry  Curry beats Lebron  Parker/Duncan beats Lebron  Lebron beats Parker  Lebron/Wade beats Durant/Westbrook  Nowitzki beats Lebron/Wade  Kobe beats KG/Pierce  Kobe beats Howard  From the looks of things... you might need both a great guard and a great wing. Unless you‚Äôre Dirk.
Jimmy Butler basically canceled out Giannis getting calls because he stole them all.   Our Game 2 of the bucks was insane.
Lot of fans loved those headbands.  I loved when Jimmy butler was on the sixers and basically the whole team wore them.
"""AND SINCE I GOT THE ROLLIE, I AINT GOT THE TIMEEEE"" - Jimmy Butler"
"If you want to watch a young core develop over the years from being bad to good then how‚Äôs the perfect time to be a detroit pistons fan.  We‚Äôre ass this year but so far 3/4 of the rookies we‚Äôve drafted have looked solid, and it likely could‚Äôve been 4/4 if one of them didn‚Äôt get injured 7 games in.  Jerami Grant looking like the most improved player his first season as a #1 option if the NBA doesn‚Äôt randomly say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and give it to Julius Randle who‚Äôs basically putting up his same numbers from last year.  Hamidou Diallo is likely to breakout here after putting up 19 last game on a minutes restriction and doing solid today too.  Then you can see vets ball out as they try to revitalize their careers here.  Shit we lose a lot, but most our losses are within 2-3possessions. I think are win margin, which we don‚Äôt get a lot, is by like 5.5pts.  We‚Äôre not a good team right now, but we have some promise.  If you wanna watch a team that‚Äôs winning now then watch Portland or Miami. Hard as shit not to love Dame or Jimmy Butler and both teams are fun to watch even without knowing who the rest of their rosters are."
Jimmy Butler is such a bitch.
"Yes, it happens a ton and it has happened for years. The person you're taking the number from generally has to be a relatively unknown player where there aren't thousands and thousands of unsold jerseys of that player out there in the world.  Another example is Landry Shamet, it has happened to him twice. When Jimmy Butler came to Philly, Jimmy took Shamet's number 23 and Shamet switched to 5. When James Harden came to Brooklyn, Harden took Shamet's number 13 and switched to 20.  Edit: Derrick Jones Jr. just switched his number mid-season from #55 to #5. Rodney Hood had previously worn #5 but when he got traded away, Jones was allowed to switch to #5."
"No, he likely didn't.  The Lakers last year could have been James, Ball, Ingram, Kuzma, Zubac with Green, Hart, Hunter, Howard, Caruso, McGee, Morris, Rondo, Caldwell-Pope, Wagner, or something off the bench.  That team is ridiculously deep, and more than good enough to win.    They also could have traded for, say, Jimmy Butler and/or Malcolm Brogdon without using even half of the assets they blew on renting Davis.  And adding Butler to that team makes them the certain champions.  No one in the East last year could be Butler and Adebayo, so they've no chance against James+Butler+Ingram.  No one in the West threatened the Lakers, either, so they wouldn't beat either of these squads."
Numbers that‚Äôs literally the only reason because though impact and leadership he‚Äôs at easily in that top 10 range. Look at that heat squad  from last season who was the best player on that team. Dragic was the leading scorer in bubble is he better than jimmy butler? This can‚Äôt just be a numbers argument. Take jimmy butlers leadership and intangibles off that team. Bam is great but he was a decent big the year before does he take the leap to all star without butlers influence. These are the factors that should be considered.

Butler played well enough to win that series and take the chip in 2019.   His teammates played terribly.   Philly fans were chanting for Jimmy and Booing Ben Simmons do not Forget that!!!
No doubt in my mind that Jimmy Butler is better than Kawhi Leonard  &amp;#x200B;  heat fan are we?
"&gt; No doubt in my mind that Jimmy Butler is better than Kawhi Leonard    Sorry but Kawhi is on another level.  If you wanna say tha Butler is underrated, yeah, we agree, even more considering what kind of elite finals he played.  But one thing is saying he's underrated, another one is overrating his level."
who's Jimmy Butler ?
Jimmy butler is likely not winning in 2015 and he wasn‚Äôt anywhere close to what he is now. Last year jimmy legit tore it up and went toe to toe with lebron better than a lot of guys we‚Äôve seen in the past.
&gt;No doubt in my mind that Jimmy Butler is better than Kawhi Leonard
1. LeBron 2. Harden 3. CP3 4. Jimmy Butler 5. Lowry
"From my experience people use ""chip"" as short for winning/playing well in playoffs. You dont have to win a ring per se but if you impress in post season you wont really get slammed much. See that players like Dame, Jimmy Butler, Chuck, Harden,... get much less slack than Russ (and Giannis right now I guess, it will be onslaught if he doesnt impress in post season very soon). Those dudes delivered in post season (I still see some Harden shit talk but it is going away), while Russ hasnt really delivered to that level - at least not as first option. He is coming off of 3 bad playoff series - that is bound to taint his image. Also imagine if Kobe stayed as first round exit/not making playoffs kinda dude ever since he and shaq left? I dont think Kobe needed to win those 2 titles to keep his reputation, but he would need to show something- Russ has kinda failed to deliver on that so far in his post Durant career."
"Lavine is not a more impactful player than 2015 Jimmy butler.   Better scorer, but not a more impactful player."
PG: Goran Dragic  SG: Jimmy Butler  SF: LeBron James  PF: Udonis Haslem  C: Bam Adebayo   We'd do alright
RJ looks more Jimmy Butler tbh
"I don't know russ's background, is he from the streets like ""my mom kicked me out and couch surfed with friends"" a la jimmy butler, or more ""single mom but living in middle class burbs and comparatively ok lifestyle"" from the streets a la drake?"
&gt;I think y‚Äôall are sleeping on Jimmy Butler.  Dude is the perfect fit for that show.   I cannot believe I had to read so many comments before getting to this one.
"Starters  PG: Tim Hardaway Sr.  SG: Dwayne Wade  SF LeBron James  PF: Chris Bosh  C: Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal   Bench:  Goran Dragic, Glen Rice Sr., Jimmy Butler, PJ Brown, Bam Adebayo, Alonzo Mourning"
"No, I just think it‚Äôs dumb to dismiss Jimmy as a better player because of his scoring and leaving it at that. Not allowing the conversation to leave PPG and FG% and leaving it at that.  The last 22 games Zion has been averaging 29 PPG and is shooting 65% from the field. Mad impressive. If he keeps that up then I admit he is an All-Time scorer, but he‚Äôs not averaging that for the entire season yet. And when talking about All-NBA the entire season is what matters.  I‚Äôm leaving the conversation at that since you‚Äôre not willing to go any further and I‚Äôm not willing to claim he‚Äôs an All-Time scorer so by default he‚Äôs better then Butler. He‚Äôs amazing, but his scoring alone doesn‚Äôt put him over Butler at this point. Not unless we‚Äôre bringing games played into the conversation.  I have nothing personal against him I‚Äôm just frustrated that every statistic or bit of evidence I bring up ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù apparently. So no, I don‚Äôt want to keep this going. Agree to disagree and ima move on. Sorry if I sound salty, but I can‚Äôt do this anymore."
They also drafted Corey Joseph one spot ahead of Jimmy butler
"Your username is randomrocketsfan and you forgot Harden? Really?   LeBron, Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler, Luka, Jokic, Chris Paul, Dame Lillard etc."
"I think y‚Äôall are sleeping on Jimmy Butler. Dude is the perfect fit for that show. My choice would be Steph, Jimmy B and D wade. I don‚Äôt know who replaces Ernie though."
Only rival would be Jimmy Butler in the modern game.
Lying deceitful cancerous locker room destroying non-chemistry-having Miami-joining-just-for-coke-and-hoes ass Jimmy Butler ass head
"Jimmy Butler does, he took them to the finals"
"Yeah they are, so how does leading one of the best offenses out him over jimmy. They are doing so bad because of defense, a flaw zion significantly contributes to. The fact that op claimed he should get it over butler is laughable"
I don‚Äôt think Nate even trained. Put Jimmy Butler in there. Dude will be training 24/7 with Tyson before the fight.
Can someone do this to Jimmy Butler please...
"Jimmy still has a slightly better per 36 then Zion and that‚Äôs also not accounting for the Heat being 28th in Pace and the the Pelicans being 18th in Pace. You can go to BBRef and look at the lineups that Zion plays with.  Their top rebounders in Hernangomez, Steven Adams and Josh Hart spend either half or more of their minutes on the court with Zion. Same goes for Ingram and Lonzo playing alongside him. They surround him with rebounders to make up for his lack.  Jimmy Butler is the 3rd best rebounder on his team behind Bam and Precious. And Precious plays most of his minutes without Jimmy anyways.  You can claim stats are flawed without context, but it‚Äôs pretty easy to look into the context. There is really no argument for Zion being at Jimmy‚Äôs level at this point in their careers."
They signed him bc he looks like jimmy butler
Has anyone ever seen Jimmy Butler and these dude in the same room?
If anything that just supports Jimmy as a rebounder though. About half of his minutes are in a small ball line-up where he‚Äôs the PF. Zion is very rarely out there without another big. We don‚Äôt even have to contextualize rebounding by position. Jimmy Butler is still better regardless of how you want to view it.  That‚Äôs my argument. Do you really believe that Zion is a better rebounder then Jimmy? If so I‚Äôd like to here your argument now because I already explained mine multiple times.
"His ceiling is a top ten player.  If Jimmy Butler can come from where he started to where he is now, theoretically anyone can.  But I must warn you that most don't."
"I personally expect him to end up behind PG13 and Jimmy Butler, but he has certainly solidified himself in the upper echelon of the NBA. He is a genuine star, and should start racking up All-NBA nods as soon as NOLA starts showing up in the playoffs."
Comments like these are the easiest way to tell who actually watches and knows basketball and who doesn‚Äôt.   Jimmy Butler is probably a better overall basketball player than Zion. Zion Williamson this season has been better than Jimmy Butler.  Both can be and are 100% true. You would know that if you actually watched the games and not the box scores.
Jimmy Butler if he doesn‚Äôt miss anymore games this season.
He‚Äôs not head and shoulders above Jimmy butler this season please stop
He‚Äôs heads and shoulder above Jimmy Butler this season. Not to mention Sabonis or Brown.   Plus being the nba‚Äôs golden boy? He‚Äôs second team
"I thought for sure that the answer would be no, but he honestly might.  These players are over him for sure:  1. Lebron (I know that he's injured, but let's be real here) 2. Giannis 3. Kawhi 4. Paul George (might get voted in as a guard)  Jimmy Butler should get voted in over him. Randle might as well.  But after that, Zion has as good of a case as anyone. It seems like it will be between him and Randle for the 3rd team."
Jimmy Butler does not belong on this list
Jimmy Butler
Man now I really want Jimmy Butler to play for the blazers. Dame hitting logo shots all night and Jimmy locking down the other team's best player... I need this injected into my veins.
"Jimmy Butler as MJ, come on guys"
"If Blazers sacrificed bad took a risk on a disgruntled all star on the trade block, they could‚Äôve gotten an inch closer to an NBA finals appearance and close to a ring.   I remeber when Jimmy Butler was available and thought Portman should‚Äôve tried hard for him. Blazers are a good example of a team that should take a risk for a star even for a one year rental to give your team a franchise superstar and legend his best chance at greatness."
They should‚Äôve traded CJ years ago and I like CJ. Issue is Blazers are perfect example of a team that has stayed complacent for years without going hard for an all star like Jimmy Butler. Imagine if Butler was on the Blazers? They actually could‚Äôve beaten GS in the 2019 WCF.
"&gt; Every other superstar that gets traded gets their team a young star on the front end.  Yea when you trade a guy the caliber of Harden you want at least some guarantee on your return, usually in the form of a good young player with potential. Theres a reason the Wolves did not accept the Rockets 4 1st round picks for Jimmy Butler (granted the return they did end up getting wasnt great but still). The Rockets had no good young players to throw into the trade and the only way to match salaries was Brandon Knight. At that point you're getting 4 picks, at least 2 of which are likely guaranteed to be late picks, for an all-nba player in his prime. Sure the later ones could be good but do you really want to wait that long to get even the chance at that? Picks are always a gamble, even top ones, and if thats the centerpiece of your trade return and not a complement, its a problem. They're obviously good to have but when you're dealing with a Butler or Harden you want some concrete guarantee in your return."
"He‚Äôs averaging less free throw attempts per game then Giannis, Embiid, Trae, Zion, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler. He‚Äôs shooting less free throw attempts and shooting a better percentage from the field than Kobe did his MVP season. If Harden is boring than I guess all those I just named are more boring to watch.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs leaning for fouls‚Äù just isn‚Äôt true either because if you actually watched him you would see he gets the majority of his fouls driving to the lane and getting contact through the arms. He slows down the game because he‚Äôs controlling the pace of the game with his facilitating which is what you want your point guard to do. Watching him facilitate and throw lobs and behind the back passes is pretty fun to see. You‚Äôre entitled to your own opinion bud it honestly just sounds like you‚Äôre a hater."
"&gt;I never said anything about DLo firstly. MPJ was not even playing well until the last 20 games. Jokic has been winning for the past 4 seasons without him.  Yes but he at least had Murray for all of those games.... and the only great stretch Ant has had was the week after all star break. So yeah on the season I'd say MPJ has been much better.  Yeah he was winning because Millsap wasn't washed and Gary Harris was great also. And you were in the playoffs the last 2 years how has he been winning the past 4 years?  &gt;We‚Äôve literally seen Towns with a good supporting cast of Jimmy Butler, Wiggins, Teague, etc. and the best he‚Äôs done is an 8 seed first round exit. Jokic has led this team much further with a worse supporting cast than that.  Wiggins had the worst year of his career in 2017-2018 and Teague was always awful. That team was also the 3rd seed for most the career and we ran into the 2018-2019 Rockets.   Man you really need to stretch the truth to make KAT look bad lol"
"I never said anything about DLo firstly. MPJ was not even playing well until the last 20 games. Jokic has been winning for the past 4 seasons without him.

Jokic has led this team much further with a worse supporting cast than that."
"Yeah that is all certainly reasonable.   Thing is, we know butler has another gear, and this is by far the highest gear we've seen from lavine (not that that's a bad thing). Like, Jimmy can put up the points efficiently when it comes down to it, but that hasn't really ever been his role or game. But I can see a lower tier team starved for points choosing lavine once you lay it out that way"
"&gt;Jimmy Butler will go from inarguably better by a long shot to definitively worse  Butler today is not ‚Äúinarguably better by a long shot‚Äù than Lavine, that‚Äôs my point. He‚Äôs already on those guy‚Äôs level."
"So, one year from now, Jimmy butler will go from inarguably better by a long shot to definitively worse? Vucevic who is having a career year and will finally have a real compliment in lavine, will what, fall off a cliff? Paul George whose game hasn't been predicated on athleticism since his leg broke will suddenly stop being able to shoot and defend?   I know you don't want to have a real conversation cause you just say the names without a single explanation"
"Not just him, i would also let KD, Kyrie and Jimmy Butler do whatever they want"
"And jimmy butler has 2.2 spg with only 31 games played though, so he doesn‚Äôt qualify"
"Butler got the pg duties because he tried to guard Kawhi in game 1 and got absolutely smoked and was atrocious on offense because he was using all his energy doing a shit job on Kawhi, so Ben guarded Kawhi the next 6 games. They won the chip and we took them to 7 and a buzzer beater, and honestly Embiid fucked up by getting in Simmons way on the Kawhi shot. He wasnt great that series but his defense on Kawhi was great, Kawhi just kept making tough mid range jump shots, what else can you do? His offense was bad but his fit with Butler wasnt very good, I remember multiple times Ben would hit Jimmy in the corner and he wouldnt shoot, idk if he was tryna make a point or he saw a driving lane or whatever, but he did that multiple times. Maybe its just the fact that hes not a good 3 point shooter, but he wasnt a great fit plus he took Bens playmaking role (rightfully so) so of course Bens averages will be down. His other series he wasnt good was his rookie year vs Boston, but Ben was our best player in both the playoff series we won, obviously 1st round so nothing major but it counts for something. When Ben was injured last playoffs we got swept 1st round."
"Ben has never played with a shot creating guard next to him, literally never but weve always been a 50 win team with him. He has always played with (except for jimmy butler) at best average playmakers. It really isnt better having a guy like Westbrook just because he fits better and will shoot if hes open. Theres a reason Ben is consistently top in 3 point assists, and its not because hes easy to guard. Youre basically saying hes hard to build around because spacing is expensive, but its not, Simmons went on a 17 win streak without Embiid his rookie year with Saric, RoCo, Bellinelli and Redick. Theyre not even expensive players, theyre all role players. Not saying he would have that kinda win rate consistently against the best teams (that run was mostly against below .500 teams) but thats a cheap team, he could get a lot better players around him."

"Lol when I was watching this game, I couldn't help but think how fucking good Butler would fit on this knicks team.. Then I felt like a dumbly and remembered Thibs was the head coach so no duh he would fit perfectly.    Jimmy would look pretty slick in a Knicks uniform though, ngl.  The garden would absolutely love him."
"None of that matters. Jimmy Butler was homeless as a kid, should he be grateful just to be a millionaire and not sign the max?  I think Brown should've at least gotten the second year guaranteed if he wants the long term stability. Otherwise what's the point of signing long term? If they guarantee it, that means you're good enough to get that much in an open market. If they don't guarantee it then there's no difference with not signing that in the first place"
Nets hadn‚Äôt beat the Timeberwolves since Jimmy Butler was on the team lol
"Jimmy Butler: ‚ÄúWhat now, Lamarcus Aldridge?!‚Äù"
Jimmy Butler is 13/60 this year lmfao
Gobert and Jimmy Butler have the same odds
Timberwolves legend Jimmy Butler sighting
"I mean, but are the players actually in the right?  Just because they have less money are they actually worth supporting?   To be honest I've been a fan of the NBA for a long time but this past season I've felt the players become more out of touch and spoiled than ever before. Jimmy Butler going at a journalist for trying to make his writing more interesting was a real dark moment for me as a writer/editor myself that made me question why I want to support such anti-intellectual assholes at all."
"I find it hard to think anyone that would be discontent with Dame holding a ring. Maybe the losing team in the final matchup, but even then, they'd just be upset that they lost, not that Dame has a ring. Only other player I can think of is Jimmy Butler."
"Jokic, Lebron, Giannis, Harden, Kawhi, Kyrie, Luka, PG, Gobert, Embiid, Steph Curry, Randle, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, CP3 are 15 guys."
Respect to Jimmy Motherfucking Butler skyrocketed. He gave it his all.
Yes and no. Usually you would replace with a hard cap. In this case smart teams that sign players to appropriate contracts win long term.   The idea behind parity is that if you want LeBron you might have to pay him twice what you pay a different max player like Jimmy Butler. Currently the only beneficial max players are those they significantly outperform their price tag. Mediocre ones can actually drag your team down.
"And for some perspective, Kieff average 5.9 pts per game in the playoffs. He had a definite impact for sure, but it's not like he proved to be a massive competitive advantage for the Lakers. Dude was getting cooked by Jimmy Butler half the time he was on the court in the playoffs."
Jimmy Butler made it to the finals as the best player for the Heat.  James Harden has never made the finals as the best player for the Rockets.  Harden is a much better player than Jimmy.   There was also no Dynasty Squad in the 2020 Eastern Conference. Context matters. A lot of dudes potentially could reach the finals with a solid enough team backing them and some luck involved
"The only active players to have currently done it are kawhi, kd, lebron, and Steph. If you want to open up to ‚Äúactive players to be the best player on a team to make the finals‚Äù you only add Dwight and jimmy butler.   All the other people you mentioned at the very top besides them aren‚Äôt obvious additions to that list, seeing as a lot of all time greats aren‚Äôt on that list.   If I had to make a guess on which players might eventually be able to join that list, I‚Äôd say embiid."
"Someone like Jimmy Butler? A younger CP is probably a better example because while Book would be the better pure scorer, CP would be better in almost every other aspect of basketball and provide the necessary leadership for a championship team."
Because James Harden is literally stratospheres better than Jimmy Butler.  ‚ÄòComparable regular season stats/accolades‚Äô  Harden‚Äôs had two more All-NBA seasons than Butler‚Äôs had All-Star
Like I don‚Äôt think James Harden is worse than say Jimmy Butler even though Butler generally plays well in the playoffs and Harden doesn‚Äôt always
"Herro is never gonna be even as good as Jimmy Butler, never mind James Harden. If he really was the roadblock that prevented a James Harden trade, Miami‚Äôs entire front office needs to retire in shame."
"It‚Äôll be interesting to see how Riley gets out of this hole. Not sure the Heat have the assets to get a star easily. Maybe they just take the risk on Westbrook and hope it works out.   I know Jimmy is a franchise legend, but it might be in both of their best interests for them to trade him. The Warriors could offer a massive longterm package with Wiseman and draft picks that helps Miami think more longterm, and the Warriors would get the 2nd superstar to put next to Steph (and a high IQ player for Kerr‚Äôs system), and Butler gets to play with his Olympic team buddies in Draymond and Klay, so he‚Äôs not going to be upset that they traded him to a good situation."
Jimmy Butler is screaming in the #Heat locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Butler comes out say ‚Äòy‚Äôall on that bulls‚Äî!‚Äô Team is imploding. Jimmy is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room
"He hit the greatest 4 rim bounce shot while falling out of bounds to beat Embiid.  Let's not forget that it was in Game 7, Embiid had a huge series and Jimmy Butler was also playing incredible.  Kawhi, while definitely the MVP, was also incredible,  the Sixers gave them their biggest challenge and once again, it was a once in a lifetime shot that beat them.     Let's not act like the series or game was a blowout.  And, Kawhi was the MVP then, this year he isn't even in consideration while Embiid is a top MVP candidate.   So, be honest with yourself, Kawhi would have been the 2nd best player on the court....which on that court last night is still a huge standing."
"I‚Äôd say you have to be top ten. Embiid lillard luka and Jokic are all guys outside the top 5 that are legitimate number 1s on their team. Sometimes, but rarely, even a guy outside the top ten can be a solid 1st option and lead his team far, as we saw last year with Jimmy Butler."
"Ah. They were, though.   I think they‚Äôve both improved since then.   I‚Äôm not going to make excuses for Butler. But, I respect that the guy went from the absolute bottom of the first round and worked himself into a top ten player. He comes off like he has a chip on his shoulder, and playing with two young #1 picks that he‚Äôs carrying probably didn‚Äôt sit well with him.   Was he a dick? Yes. Was he wrong? Debatable. I know Jimmy carried a team to the finals less than 12 months ago, whereas Wiggins and KAT are still on  lottery teams."
"Everyone talks about guys like Chris Paul and Lebron being amazing coaches one day, but I‚Äôd take Jimmy Butler as an AC or HC over them any day. He‚Äôs respectful, inspiring, and unifying but he takes zero bullshit and knows what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Obviously there are a handful of truly great leaders playing in the NBA right now, but I‚Äôd argue Jimmy‚Äôs the one the average player actually enjoys playing for(and currently with.)"
"Lmao I love these braindead takes of a seven year old. ‚ÄúButler got upset and called KAT names on his way out the door so KAT is soft, even though he wipes the floor with Jimmy every single time they play while jimmy has a top team and KAT plays on the worst team in the league‚Äù"
"You guys still lost 4 in a row to the Bucks and now recently blew up the team because you realized that roster couldn't compete in the East. What exactly did I say was wrong?   We are 3-13 without Jimmy Butler this season. 10 games behind the 1st seed. People are discrediting a team that's not playing as well as they did last regular season? Really? The Bucks were 12 games ahead of us and got beat down. Celtics/Pacers all had better regular season records and got beat down. How exactly do you write this team off again in the playoffs this season?! How exactly are fans pointing to a disappointing playoff performance from the Heat already, I'm curious. If Butler left the team, yeah we stand no chance. If Bam left, yeah. Some important player like Dragic left no doubt. We lost Jae Crowder and added Ariza in return + more pieces. This team should have a better record and are underperforming this season due to health reasons. You get downvoted for having an opinion as if regular season record matters so much come playoff time lol. Player talent matters and the Heat are one of the more talented rosters in the East."
"[He said more than that](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2800185-jimmy-butler-reportedly-insulted-karl-anthony-towns-andrew-wiggins-they-soft)  Maybe he wasnt as blunt to the public or the media.   But he did say they (KAT and Wiggins) ain't shit and that theyre soft, at practice."
"Well our team was hit with covid earlier this season and Jimmy Butler missed quite a few games. Even if we're ""objectively"" worse from our record, come playoff time we should have a fully healthy team with more on the line to play for. I don't understand how people can say we were hot last playoffs and completely discredit us and comments like that get a million upvotes and I'm just saying the same exact roster isn't to be written off gets massively downvoted lol.  There's still a month left of play and we're at .500 around 10 games behind the 1st seed. We could easily make a run at the same exact seed as last season and you'd still have people write us off. It's absolutely ridiculous and pisses me off.  I also did mention our record against top teams this season as being worse in my other comment. Don't understand the downvotes, I was clearly making a distinction between records against top teams. The drop-off from last year doesn't make too much sense considering we didn't lose anyone besides Crowder and added a few nice pieces."
"We hope he evolves into Jimmy Butler. But yeah, I think I saw a comparison that RJ's stats in year two of the NBA were better than Butlers stats at same age...at Marquette.   Could be wrong, bound to happen sometime, but I  pretty sure."
Wasn‚Äôt your only playoff appearance in the last 2 decades because of Jimmy fucking Butler

"It's Greg Sylvander, and he has no credibility at all. He's a heat fan with twitter followers who makes guesses and calls them reports and has never broken news. And the report about Herro  [was denied](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/12/miami-reportedly-open-to-james-harden-trade-tyler-herro-not-untouchable/) by the most reliable South Florida reporter (Barry Jackson, Miami Herald) 2 days after Sylvander's fake report.  Sylvander and the ""organization"" he works for (5 reasons sports) have been caught lying about multiple other things this year, including:   Lamarcus Aldridge to Miami being a done deal (via Sylvander),   Oladipo not getting traded to Miami (via Sylvander, ""reported"" 5 minutes before he was traded).   Kyle Lowry to Miami being a done deal,   And most notably, they also made up the report that Jimmy Butler [declined an all star game invitation](https://heatnation.com/rumors/report-jimmy-butler-was-chosen-to-be-all-star-but-he-refused-to-attend-game-without-bam-adebayo/) because Bam didn't make it, which the league put out a statement [denying](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_denies_that_jimmy_butler_rejected_all_star_invite/s1_13132_34242260)  The Heat had 0 first round picks available to trade, they were never getting Harden. This report about Herro/Harden never made sense, what would the offer have even been? Kendrick Nunn, Duncan Robinson and 2 2nd round picks for Harden?"
"Wish KAT the best, wish he stays with the Timberwolves and consistently leads them to deep playoff runs.  I don‚Äôt agree with it, but Jimmy Butler is such a proven player in terms of what he has achieved that no surprise his words carry weight"
"&gt;Why?   MINNEAPOLIS -- ‚Äî Karl-Anthony Towns scored 24 points, including eight in the fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-111 win against the Miami Heat on Friday night.  Ricky Rubio added 17 points and Naz Reid scored 16 off the bench as Minnesota had seven players score in double-figures to overcome 21 turnovers. Towns keyed a 22-6 run midway through the fourth as the Timberwolves pulled away.  Towns missed the past two games due to personal reasons on the one-year anniversary of his mother‚Äôs death. Minnesota lost both games by at least 25 points to Brooklyn and Milwaukee. Against another Eastern Conference playoff contender, the Timberwolves finished strong to win for just the second time in six games, a stretch against all East teams.  ‚ÄúThis win meant a lot to me, just being able to do what I love and be able to be on the court with these guys,‚Äù Towns said.  Jimmy Butler had 30 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, but Miami lost its third straight game, all coming on the road. Trevor Ariza scored a season-high 21 points for the Heat, who started the night seventh in the East and a half-game ahead of Charlotte.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt deserve to win,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúWhenever we take these teams lightly, we don‚Äôt do what we‚Äôre supposed to do on the defensive end, we just look bad as a whole, as a group, as a unit. It‚Äôs not good basketball.‚Äù  Miami appeared ready to put away the Wolves, the West‚Äôs worst team at the start of the day. The Heat finished the third quarter on a 15-5 and led by five points with Goran Dragic hitting a buzzer-beating 3-pointer.  Towns didn‚Äôt let Minnesota fade away. He finished the pivotal fourth-quarter run with a deep 3 and walked back up the court holding out three fingers to the hometown crowd.  ‚ÄúTough couple games this week for us, but we responded tonight,‚Äù Wolves coach Chris Finch said. ‚ÄúTotal team effort; what I love about it is it was probably our best team effort of the season.‚Äù  TIP-INS  Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed his fourth straight game with right knee soreness. ... Butler, the former Timberwolves star who forced his way out with a trade, was booed loudly the first time he touched the ball by the limited fans in attendance. ... Butler recorded multiple steals for the ninth straight game, setting a franchise record and extending the longest streak of his career. Sherman Douglas had eight consecutive such games in 1990.  Timberwolves: G Jaylen Nowell missed the game with a right tibia contusion. ... Towns extended his streak of games with a 3 to 70 games, the longest stretch by a player in franchise history. ... Edwards had a steal for the 25th straight game, the longest active streak in the NBA, and longest by a rookie in team history. The NBA record for a rookie is 31 straight games by Chris Paul in 2005-06.  KEY STAT  Heat coach Erik Spoelstra highlighted an important factor in the win: second-chance points. Minnesota had 10 offensive rebounds leading to 23 second-chance points. Miami only had five second-chance points.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs tough to overcome,‚Äù Spoelstra said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a problem right now, us being able to finish our defense. At least the last three games, that has not been good enough.‚Äù  JOINT FUNDRAISER  The Timberwolves and Heat agreed to auction their pregame ‚ÄúWith Liberty and Justice FOR ALL‚Äù warmup shirts to raise money for The Daunte Wright Memorial Fund. Wright was the Black man fatally shot by a police officer on April 11 in a nearby suburb.  The Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks ‚Äì the previous two teams to play in Minnesota ‚Äì along with the WNBA‚Äôs Minnesota Lynx joined the cause. Each shirt will be autographed by players. The auction ran concurrently on the Timberwolves‚Äô website during Friday‚Äôs game.  UP NEXT  Heat: Host the Nets on Sunday.  Timberwolves: Travel to Los Angeles to play the Clippers on Sunday.  ------"
I think it is because he has asked to be traded from two teams and didn‚Äôt win. Jimmy Butler was on his way to being hated until he got to the finals last year.
"As a Jimmy Butler fan I think a lot was misunderstood. KAT seems like he‚Äôs a really great dude, and I for sure am a fan of his, I don‚Äôt think that was the problem. I think it boils down to 2 types of people not being able to see eye-to-eye on how to proceed and act, which doesn‚Äôt really say much about the individual necessarily, more about the divide the differences made. He even recently said that he‚Äôs done chasing stats and that he cares about winning only, Jimmy with KAT with this mentality would have been a great mentor, just 2 seasons too late."
"i would be mad but this trash team absolutely deserves ridicule. i love fox but he‚Äôs not really an alpha to me, even when he goes sicko mode and averages 35 PPG for a week i don‚Äôt really see him as the soul of the team like someone like jimmy butler. our team has no heart, most of the team has had no reaction to our losing streak  and i didn‚Äôt follow the knicks closely during the fizdale era but he cannot be worse than luke walton, i swear that an AI could coach this team better. walton literally had maurice harkless as our center down the stretch last night"
Doesn't even matter anymore. Somehow the Nets added Harden's supermax contract and the Heat added Jimmy Butler. Both teams were over the cap.
"I will tolerate zero Jimmy Butler slander. That man is an absolute dog, clutch buckets clutch defensive plays and a great leader for his team."
"We were inconsistent last year. 2nd least amount of wins for a playoff team against sub .500 teams. But one of the best in the league against top teams. Our record was actually understated because of the quality of losses.   My point about Rivers stands lmao. I'm saying you're prematurely talking about a team based on regular season when we literally showed up as a 5th seed and made noise. It was totally expected if you were following the games. You can pretty much do the same thing this season and figure out which teams will go far. I know Sixers and Nets will do some damage this season just from the quality of wins. The Heat didn't exactly lose anyone crazy from last season so expecting a shitty team is absolutely ridiculous lol. Just watch how the dynamic shifts in the playoffs. LeCoasting is a real thing for not just LeBron but most teams not struggling to find a playoff spot. Jimmy Butler just like recently turned it on and the rest of the team is very cold. Still like 20 games left.   We absolutely demolished the Bucks and Pacers last season and pretty much the Celtics. There are 2 new ""fresh"" teams in the East but the dynamic just expands. I'm excited."
"Jimmy butler on the wolves were a better road team than the heat, heat actually have a shot of beating their road record from last year while having a much worse home record"
"LOL, if D-wade somehow tampered his way into getting Jimmy Butler to come to the Utah Jazz, then we are wasting his talents and need to get this man on a plane to Kashmir to broker a deal between India and Pakistan."
"Yeah excuse us for getting hot in the playoffs. Never mind we had the most wins against top teams in the East being part of the reason we were able to abort the Bucks and Pacers. Celtics put up a small fight. If you count out this Heat team, that's just dumb lol. Even if I wasn't a Heat fan, I would have this take 10/10. Did you not fucking see Jimmy Butler carry this team against the Lakers? I don't think a single team in the NBA can put up a fight against a healthy Lakers team. Absolutely no chance.   The whole point of the playoffs is to get hot. You could use that excuse for any team... insane take."
"‚ÄúIn this moment I am euphoric. Not because of a phony God‚Äôs blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my own intelligence‚Äù   - Jimmy Butler, professional quote maker"
"I think Chris Paul is a better point guard than Damian Lillard. And Jimmy Butler is a better small foward than Paul George. These are just my opinions, don't hate me."
Jimmy butler doesn't pick up the mail like some softy he follows the mailman for 5 blocks after his 3 in the morning gym routine and beats him up till he drops his mail like a br game
Should have kept Jimmy Butler but you sided with Hoiball instead. Now you have nothing to show for.
bruh miami fans really said jimmy butler should be mvp lmao
"Why would Miami want Derozen, they already have basically him but with high-level defense in Jimmy Butler."
"&gt; It was Wade who got Jimmy for us after all.   Well, that's not exactly true.  [https://www.insider.com/jimmy-butler-wanted-join-heat-dwyane-wade-conversation-2020-9](https://www.insider.com/jimmy-butler-wanted-join-heat-dwyane-wade-conversation-2020-9)  It was Wade's comment about Miami's culture.  Who is responsible for that culture?"
"Yeah i gave up after I lost AD, Jimmy Butler, Lauri, D'Angelo to injuries/COVID. They were all too good to just outright drop so i took so many L's"
I mean lebron is bigger than jimmy but he still guarded him. Butler is tough guy but those guys are bit bigger
"Yeah I mean shit just moves super quickly these days. Personally, thought the Lakers really should have been pursuing players instead of kawhi. Like it worked out for them, because they won anyway, but they had wayyyyy more options with that cap space, and could of gotten a third star like Jimmy butler(who Iirc was reportedly willing to take a pay cut to join the Lakers) or any other star much much earlier and been an even more dominant team.   I respect them taking the gamble, but you can‚Äôt be pissy that a gamble doesn‚Äôt work out. I mean come on"
Wolves fans gave a very complicated relationship with jimmy butler but he seems like he's a fan favorite around the rest of the nba
I'm not hating on Jimmy Butler. I just don't think he's a better player than KAT. And to his fans that is the same as calling them a son of a bitch.
"&gt;You‚Äôre right, Jimmy only had a RAPTOR Rating of +8.1 and Towns had one of +3.8. Jimmy had a real plus/minus of 4.01 and Towns had one of 1.94.   Does that account for games Butler played without KAT? Oh wait he didn't because KAT played all 82 games....   &gt;And it‚Äôs true that Towns got shut down in the first round by 18‚Äô Clint Capela of all people  Yeah by a historically great team... who was one of the better defensive teams in the NBA...."
What makes KAT a better player than jimmy butler ?
"&gt;Talent is one thing, Jimmy was a better player and the leader. It wasn‚Äôt a narrative developed after the fact, it was an observation that almost everyone made during that season.  Come on man. The offensive gap between them is enormous. Jimmy Butler could have been slightly better than KAT in 2018 but atm its not close.  I also love how when there is no statistical argument people resort to ""intangibles"""
Jimmy butler currently is a better and more impactful player than KAT lol
"Jimmy Butler is inarguably one of the most intense and sincere players in the league. He said that young core wasn't serious about winning, and so far they haven't proven him wrong."
"The Heat are 4-11 without Jimmy Butler this season. Let‚Äôs say they win 3 more games with, which isn‚Äôt  far fetched, they‚Äôd be 3rd in the East.  I‚Äôm not sure if you watched game 6 of that finals series, but it was fairly obvious that the entire first half was Lowry vs the Warriors. Obviously Kawhi was the main guy that series, but by no means do they win game without Lowry.  Kawhi is a better shooter. That‚Äôs it. Probably a better playmaker too. Footwork is an eye test thing that I‚Äôm not gonna debate with you.  Giannis has consistently ran the best defense in the league for 2 years. As DPOY. He‚Äôs the better defender. I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a debate.   Paul George is a better offensive weapon then Kawhi. Is he the better player... probably not.  It has well been document that Kawhis quiet demeanor has lead to him not being a great leader. It‚Äôs probably one of the reasons the Clippers gave up a 3-1 lead, as they had no leadership.  The game planning thing... yeah that was probably bullshit what I said. All I meant by it was that Kawhi doesn‚Äôt possess any elite offensive capabilities that teams need to scout for(Currys Shooting, Jokics Passing, Giannis Driving.)"
"I think it‚Äôs more reasonable to expect Jimmy Butler to show out in the playoffs as an 8 seed than any of the other teams that would be there.  Heat overperformed last playoffs and has many of the same players, so there‚Äôs a precedent there too."
"anthony davis and damian lillard are better players than jimmy butler, the fact that butler was a hair away from leading a championship level team disproves your statement."
Jimmy Butler was 2 wins away from leading a championship team less than 6 months ago.
"You're really overrating his performance in that series. His +/- was great, but he also shot 37% from the field for the series and only averaged 17.6 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, with more turnovers than assists. Gasol really shut him down. Jimmy Butler was amazing in that series and was the only reason Philly came so close to winning.  Jokic is a better playoff performer than Embiid, and it's not even close. These are their career playoff numbers:  **Jokic (33 games):** 24.7 ppg; 11.2 rpg; 6.9 apg; 1.1 spg; 0.8 bpg; 3.0 turnovers; 51%/41%/84% shooting (60.6% true shooting); 26.9 PER (only LeBron, Mikan, and Jordan have a higher career playoff PER)  **Embiid (23 games):** 22.3 ppg; 11.5 rpg; 2.9 apg; 0.9 spg; 1.9 bpg; 3.7 turnovers; 43%/28%/78% shooting (55% true shooting); 21.4 PER  So Jokic puts up better raw stats than Embiid in the playoffs, he is much more efficient, and he has made deeper playoff runs despite playing in a tougher conference. It's no contest."
Neither is Embiid or Jimmy Butler.
And I think you‚Äôd be crazy. Tatum has lead the C‚Äôs to multiple ECF‚Äôs already as the best player on the court every time. He was drafted in 2017. He‚Äôs already a face of the league and might one day be the best player in the league if he keeps growing like this. Jimmy Butler isn‚Äôt a better player and the league is promoting Tatum as a face for years to come. When it comes to superstardom a big part is being the face of the league. Jimmy never was that. Tatum already is.
In no universe an I gonna accept people thinking that Jimmy Butler is on a higher tier than Jayson Tatum.   It‚Äôs just not happening.
Yeah kawhi or jimmy butler with a better 3 but worse at defense than both by a good bit
"Yes, Jokic is having a terrific season.  But BPM is so watered down at this point.  Just look at all the guys having historically great seasons - Jokic 9th, Giannis 75th, Embiid 89, Curry 92, Lebron 111, Jimmy Butler (?!?) 119.  Like really?  In the entire nearly 50 year history since they started fully tracking box scores, 6 guys are in the Top 120 ever in one season.  And there were 7 last year too.  Anyway - not trying to discredit Jokic here - he's the deserving MVP.  Just pointing out that placing BPM into historical context is fast becoming pointless with the stat inflation in today's game."
"Danny Green literally guarded no big premiere wings, and on the few plays he did, he got cooked because he's slow as hell. You didn't watch us last year; Tatum cooked us regardless and dropped like 41 in LA last year  Wes is a better on ball defender and is better suited for guys like Jimmy Butler, who Danny couldn't handle last year"
Jimmy Butler and a random 3rd stringer.
Prime Dudley age 25-28(2010-2013)  Age 25 (2010-2011)- 26.7 MPG - 10.9/3.9/1.3/1.1 with 47/41/74 splits.   Age 26 (2011-2012)- 31.1 MPG - 12.7/4.6/1.7/.8 with 48/38/72 splits   Age 27 (2012-2013)- 27 MPG - 10.9/3.1/2.6/.9 on 47/39/80 splits     12 seasons after the initial ankle injury Grant Hill averaged a very respectable 13.1/4.7/2.6. In the prior 6 seasons Hill averaged 21.6/7.9/6.3   Grant Hill post ankle injury was still a better player than prime Dudley but he was closer to to Dudley skill wise after the injuries than he was to Jimmy Butler.
"Chris or Jared Dudley? Jimmy Butler and Detroit-era Hill have very similar games. I would give the edge to Hill on offense but Butler on defense. Plus, Hill did have an old but still efficient Joe Dumars on those Pistons squads."
People saying Jimmy Butler never watched prime Grant Hill and I say that as someone who loves Jimmy Butler
lebron guarded jimmy butler for 23:46 in the finals. AD guarded him for 22:56. not a significant difference. and he defended him well
"I‚Äôm going to play devils advocate here. Let‚Äôs take KAT‚Äôs skill set vs Jimmy Butler. Who plays like a big, and who plays like a guard?"
"I feel like this video I made like 6 months ago was ill received, but applicable to this thread, so I‚Äôm going to link it:  Is Jimmy Butler a Guard or a Big? Evidence That He's Both https://youtu.be/m9AvPM-d-CQ"
"Our guard rotation is waaaaaay too crowded anyway, about time for Wes to be moved out entirely. He's a good matchup for bigger SGs like Jimmy Butler and somewhat useful because of his on-ball D, but that's pretty much the limit of his value  Schroder, KCP, Caruso, THT, McLemore and Wes should be the pecking order, in that order"
Oh my lord the jimmy butler trade package is an absolute monster.
"Steve Nash's favourite sport was soccer. Jimmy Butler switched from football to basketball because he liked the AC in the gym over the hot outdoors. LeBron was a great football player in highschool too. The popularity of football in America can't be overstated; often it takes work for basketball coaches to convince good athletes to focus more on basketball. I would wager the amount of superstars whose initial ""favourite sport"" was something other than basketball is significant. Hyper-athletic guys play essentially every sport in high school anyway."
"Players that near guarantee a playoff spot more so than Rudy: Lebron, Harden, Jokic, Embid, Giannis, Curry, chirs Paul, Jimmy Butler, damian lillard. There more too. That isn‚Äôt a good enough argument for mvp"
"Per game basis simply shows the consistency of that. Like if we go by totals, currently, T.J. McConnel has 89 steals and is averaging 1.6 a game. On a ‚Äúper game basis‚Äù Jimmy Butler is leading at 2.1.   Basically we use the per game statistics because it values consistency over totals. After all, basketball is a game of consistency."
"I said make the finals, not win it all. Literally last year Jimmy Butler and the Heat made the finals with team defense, 3 pt shooting, and smart veterans. To answer your question, the 2004 Pistons"
"&gt;Jimmy Butler and KAT would be hilarious too, but KAT might end up in tears after Jimmy verbally shits in KAT‚Äôs proverbial mouth.  A guy who is still strong in face of losing 7 family members this past year will cry if Jimmy tells him he's soft..."
"I don't see why they can't win the west at least. You don't necessarily need a top 5 player, just a guy who can take over a close game like Jimmy Butler did last year, and Booker can absolutely do that. They play great defense and can shoot the ball well. The Lakers and Clippers are favorites but I don't see why the Suns can't pull off an upset. Now if they were to make the finals, I'd take Brooklyn, Milwaukee , and Philly over them"
"Obvious answer is Russ and KD.  I also think Draymond and KD would be interesting, too.  Jimmy Butler and KAT would be hilarious too, but KAT might end up in tears after Jimmy verbally shits in KAT‚Äôs proverbial mouth.  Edit: forgot Russ and Pat Bev. That would be great, but really anything with Russ would be great, he‚Äôs a treat to listen to when talking about something/something he‚Äôs not fond of. So matter of fact and to the point, it‚Äôs refreshing in this day and age."
"2019 Sixers? Simmons, Jimmy Butler, Redick and solid role players? And you still lost in the 2nd round in the East  Meanwhile AD's best teammates in the playoffs have been Jrue and old Rondo, who aren't bad by any means but nowhere near as good as Embiid's best. AD also missed Cousins that year with his injury halfway through so he had to take on the KD Warriors by himself"
I wasn‚Äôt part of that crowd. I was part of the crowd that said ‚Äúlol‚Äù when they played the Lakers   The knicks also don‚Äôt have a jimmy butler   Are you honestly telling me that Randle can deliver outstanding performances   Rj can be consistent in a limited series   Mitchell Robinson doesn‚Äôt get into foul trouble  early in games vs Giannis  And that Rose will get out of his bad slump?
They literally tried. They acquired Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler in trades to try and 4-headed beast the East and failed.
"To an extent.   But I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more to do with Embiid being engaged playing at a MVP level and Doc actually knowing how to use Tobias. Brett Brown was quoted last year saying, ‚ÄúWe need Tobias to be our new JJ Redick.‚Äù  Like think about that fucking sentence. It makes my skin crawl as a basketball junkie.   I mean there‚Äôs a reason Embiid came into this season not fat and ready to dominate. Jimmy Butler notoriously clashed with Brett and thought he was shit, and that rubbed off on Embiid as Jimmy and he are really close still.   Brown lost the locker room before the season even started last year. Was roster construction good? No. But neither was the coaching.   Brett should have been canned after losing to the Celtics skeleton crew years ago his first time in the playoffs. It was clear then what his limitations were when Stevens coached circles around him."
Jimmy Butler would never force his way off a teamüòä
"Nah Kawhi is Chris Partlow for sure. Accomplished and completely cold while doing what he does best.  I vote Jimmy Butler for Brother Mouzzone. Focused and calm on the job, but talkative and affable off the clock."
"Rose-Wade-LeBron-Bosh-Noah would have been the craziest fucking basketball team of all time. Holy shit.  Not to mention, they would have had a super late pick still in the next draft, and still could have landed Jimmy Butler. My god."
"Well, if u really must know. The Heat have been plagued by injuries both early on and as of late (Butler early in the year, Dragic throughout the year, and now Oladipo just to name a few). In addition to injuries the loss of Jae Crowder has been worse than anticipated. Besides that the Heat have struggled to shoot the 3 ball consistently w even Duncan Robinson struggling, although as of late he‚Äôs back to form. Dragic is a year older and is really showing it. But at the end of the day this team never looked like a finals level team until the playoffs anyway last year. That team still shows up in glimpses and has looked really good in the brief time we‚Äôve seen Dipo on the floor. Butler still has the ability to take over games and we shall see if playoff Jimmy is still a thing when that time comes."
"until we get an actual guard who can create his own shot to go with Jo/Ben then I don't want to move him.    If Dame or Booker or someone like that came available, then yeah...but short of that(which isn't happening) can we at least try it again with a guy who can get their own shot next to them.   reg season wise they have proven to work and have been top 3 seed pretty much since the beginning.  It's playoffs and the one year they had Butler they looked unstoppable.  God mode Kawhi and Ebola riddled Embiid stopped that team then of course we let Jimmy go."
He definitely has the talent and the skillset but the top 10 is so crowded that unless you make some noise in the postseason there's no point in letting you into the top 10. Jimmy Butler is at the bottom end of the top 10 and that guy lead a team to the Finals.

"sorry, after a week of being confused, i realized i told you the wrong statistic. It wasn‚Äôt defensive rating, it‚Äôs player general defense. He‚Äôs among the ranks of lebron, ben simmons, giannis and jimmy butler. for reference the players at the bottom of this list are cole anthony, kevin knox, and jordan poole. rj is 16 on this list MB is 48"
Because Jimmy Butler is amazing
"My first thought was ""Jimmy Butler"""
&gt;Yeah I don‚Äôt think any of them are bringing a star to Chicago lol  Josh Richardson got Jimmy Butler for Miami.  Sometimes stars trade for less than you might think.
"You forgot the Jimmy Butler stan threads, refs are soft threads, Gobert overrated threads, Hornets announcer threads and 'whats wrong with the celtics' threads"
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
how did jimmy butler look heat fans? didn‚Äôt watch the game so don‚Äôt want to make any observation but looking at his box score he clearly isn‚Äôt right imo.
"I say Jimmy Butler. Could also be PG, CP3, or Kyrie."
This is an invite to a Jimmy Butler 3rd stringers joke isn‚Äôt it?
"I‚Äôll keep editing maybe but fuck me, and fuck your guys for not pointing it out. Jimmy is 100% Jimmy. McNulty to Butler, Butler to McNulty. We‚Äôve seen how they behave in environments they disapprove of, actively creating a firestorm.  Furthermore, we have seen neither are good with boats (link for the Butler kayak video).  Also they have gotten really close after a long struggle but left disappointed.  Jimmy‚Äôs are both kind of endearing psychopaths.  Also like, Jimmy"
literally jimmy butler
Alize looks kinda like jimmy butler
"AD, KP, Jimmy Butler, Kemba (I know all of these guys aren‚Äôt all stars but they are big players, important to playoff teams.)  Lamelo and Wiseman, Harden (who NEVER gets hurt like LeBron), CJ, Oladipo, TJ Warren, a ton of injuries."
Except for the season where Jimmy Butler brought a winning culture to Minnesota and led the Timberwolves third string (plus KAT and Wiggins) into the playoffs in 2017-2018.
I honestly dont get how Jimmy Butler does it. Harden at least employs body trickery and ref bait moves
Rj Barrett [Jimmy Butler]
Jimmy Butler
"If anyone in this subreddit, right now, with a straight face, would look my in the face and tell me they'd rather have Paul George on their basketball team over Jimmy Butler for a playoff series, and they didn't just wake up from a coma that started right before last years playoffs, then idek what to say."
Patrick Williams [Jimmy Butler] I see lots of Kawhi comparisons but I can honestly see him becoming more of a Jimmy Butler type player
"Lmao, imagine thinking Jimmy Butler was good enough to lead a team."
"&gt;When he left the game, we went on runs. When he came back in, runs ended.  and yet Harden's net rating for the series was +15.0 per 48 and cp3's was +8.3.  and that's including games 6 and 7 in cp3's off time.  in the 5 games he actually played (i.e. when he was stopping all those runs), his net rating was -1.0 per 48.  the rockets were a ridiculous -21 per 48 when harden didn't play.    &gt;Harden had 3 playoffs that were good statistically, but well below his normal performance level, especially against good teams. He played worse than in the regular season, and got fewer stats in more minutes.   apparently it's a problem that's going around, because harden played 7 series the last 3 years and led both teams in game score in 6 of those series.  so if his numbers and play were dropping off, they were somehow staying above some really good players.  that's 2 series against KD, 2 against steph, 1 against lebron, 1 against AD, 2 more against donovan mitchell, 1 against cp3, and 5 with cp3 as a teammate.  KD is 3rd in history by leading 55% of his series in game score so that shows how tough leading 6 out of 7 series at any point is.   &gt;Jimmy never made it out of the second round because he'd never been on a team that should have. He was the best player in the playoffs on a squad that had Embiid, Simmons, no coach and negative spacing.   and because he's never been a top 10 player.  teams led by non-top 10 guys tend to struggle to get out of the 2nd round.  we're not going to rewrite history because of how good jimmy was in last year's playoffs.  something tells me if harden averaged 19/6/5 on that philly team, you wouldn't be here singing his praises.  harden loses to a 4 hall-of-famer juggernaut due to an injury and you can barely bring yourself to say anything good about it.  &gt;If you need a basket in a tight game, he can get it.  it's not just that he didn't get out of the 2nd round in the east, he didn't get out of the 1st on 4 occasions and missed the playoffs on another.  no one is saying he isn't good, but the myth that jimmy butler can just will he and his team to greatness just because he was great in last year's playoffs is not well-supported by history."
"Jimmy Butler was getting this sort of talk during last year's playoffs. Kinda quieted down now that the Heat aren't that good, even though that's *really* not his fault."
"&gt;  people gotta let go of the ""cp3 was the best player against the warriors"" thing.  Stop looking at stats.  He was unquestionably the best player against us.  Anyone watching the series would tell you that.  He broke down our defense time and again.  When he left the game, we went on runs.  When he came back in, runs ended.  He bothered Curry more than any post season challenge outside of a sprained knee did.  Stats are not everything.  CP3 controlled the game and ruined our offensive scheme.  It also wasn't just ""big shots"".  It was CP3 closing every game while Harden leaned on his knees exhausted at half court.  &gt;  while harden was getting guarded by whoever was the best defender on the floor.  This is how I know you either didn't watch the series or don't know what you're looking at.  Our best defender is Draymond Green, he never guarded Harden.  Our second best defender was Klay, he never guarded Draymond.  &gt;  harden has had 3 really good playoffs in a row and only gets stopped by teams like the durant warriors (sometimes only when his 2nd best player is in street clothes) and lebron/AD when he's got a broken westbrook anchor dragging him down.  Harden had 3 playoffs that were good statistically, but well below his normal performance level, especially against good teams.  He played worse than in the regular season, and got fewer stats in more minutes.  The truth is Harden has too much muscle and is an asthmatic.  He literally can't breathe come fourth quarters where he's played 40+ minutes.  His teams are not only dependent on his skill, they're literally built around him and don't work well with him off the floor.  So they can't just rest him before the end because they'll dig themselves a hole.  It's a big reason Harden decided to lose weight last season.  Weight he has now put back on because he's on a super team where he can defer possessions to KD and Kyrie.  &gt;  butler had never been out of the 2nd round until last year, despite playing a lot of years in the east, and it's not like his individual playoff numbers were amazing and it was just his teammates letting him down.  Again with your preoccupation with numbers.  Jimmy never made it out of the second round because he'd never been on a team that should have.  He was the best player in the playoffs on a squad that had Embiid, Simmons, no coach and negative spacing.  They were one shot from beating the eventual NBA champs because Jimmy performed in crunch time and because of a lucky bounce on a Kawhi jumper.  Jimmy affects the game more than just x points on x% ts.  Playing good defense, being in the right place at the right time, forcing your opponent to take tougher shots, being able to get a basket when the defense tightens up and your team needs it.  &gt;  part of the problem is his teams usually relied on him to be their best scorer down the stretch and he simply wasn't up there with the best at doing that. maybe last year was the start of a trend in the other direction.  Jimmy's clutch scoring advanced stats have him top 5 in the NBA every year and top 5 in the playoffs every year.  If you need a basket in a tight game, he can get it.  If you can't see why Jimmy is a beast, it's a good thing you're not a GM."
Nearly every star in the NBA is a millennial... Jimmy Butler has millennial mentality
You can thank Jimmy Butler for that.
I agree they are initiators. Jimmy Butler and LeBron play point forward. Luka sort of does
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler and Lebron
Celtics will win the championship this year   Tyler Herro is a poor mans kyle Kuzma and Jimmy Butler doesn‚Äôt have a great work ethic he just has a bad sleep schedule.  Order restored  Also Bam... fuck it I can‚Äôt even make something up about Bam. He‚Äôs dope.
"Initiator is the term you‚Äôre lookin for, and big initiators the are the most valuable players in the game   Luka, Lebron, Jokic, Giannis, Jimmy Butler = big initiators   A good two way 5 is super valuable but it‚Äôs still not quite as valuable. In football terms think of an initiator as QB and the two way center as a pass rusher   That‚Äôs why in the 2021 draft Cade is unanimous #1, while Evan Mobley‚Äôs range fluctuates a little bit"
"Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Miami and Brooklyn are better than the Celtics. I trust Giannis, Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant more than Jason Tatum. The only favorable matchups are Atlanta and New York for Boston. At the best, he's between the fifth to tenth best player in the NBA Eastern Conference. Boston faces any of them I previously mentioned, and they'll be out in the first round."
"Mikal, Williams, and Barrett are the next Gen Kawhi, Paul George, and Jimmy Butler."
Mahmoud Abdul Rauf. He was proto-Steph with the attitude of Jimmy Butler. He would be a super-duper star today.
Jimmy Butler is one of those dudes who gets away with a lot of subpar performances because of how he's perceived.
"[Jimmy Butler approves](https://theathletic.com/2107706/) &gt;Robert Frozena: He loved Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift, too. ‚ÄúParty in the USA‚Äù was his No. 1 jam.  &gt;Scott Kuykendall, sports information director: We were in Orlando and it was very rare for a bus driver to have music on. When you get on the bus, it‚Äôs serious. But for whatever reason we were in Orlando playing in the Old Spice tournament and Miley Cyrus ‚ÄúParty in the USA‚Äù comes on, and Jimmy just started singing. He knew every word."
Jimmy butler was traded for Robert Covington and Dario saric.
"The NBA really loves selling rags to riches stories, and unique ones at that probably make it even better.. Not just the usual ‚ÄúAfrican-american dad leaves single mother to nurture NBA star as a kid‚Äù, like actual unique ones, like Giannis or Butler.  If Giannis or Jimmy win a chip there‚Äôs really not a better storyline, so if they had to, they‚Äôll make it happen."
"Stacey King for the Bulls. Here are some of many:  * ""Big-time players make big-time plays!"" When a player makes a clutch shot.  * ""Let me step back and kiss myself!"" When a player makes a big shot.  * ""Bang, bang, bang!"" Whenever a player makes a 3.  * ""Give me the hot sauce! Sriracha"" When a player makes a big shot.  * ""I didn't come for the massage, I came for the facial"" When a player posterizes another player.  * ""Thadgic Johnson"" Whenever Thad Young makes an assist.  * ""Brought to you by the law offices of Young and Satoransky"" Whenever Thad and Sato assist each other  * ""Jimmy G Buckets, and the G stands for gets."" When Jimmy Butler would hit a clutch shot when he was on the Bulls.  * ""Windy City Assassin"" Would say that about Derrick Rose.  * ""Theis, Theis baby"" When Daniel Theis scores.  * ""Stop it"" When a player makes a big shot/tough shot/dunk  * ""I'm hype Neil Funk"" When a player makes a big play. Neil Funk was his old announcer partner.   I couldn't find a recent video, but here are some highlights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_LQmvFpwbU    Bonus: Here's him and fellow announcer Adam Amin roasting a Bulls fan for his jersey. Stacey and the Bulls ended up reaching out to him and giving him a Jersey and Bulls gear. The fan took it in stride: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZtfAnV3mrw"
Yeah Jimmy Butler who was developed elsewhere in a place other stars have come from. I just said he isn‚Äôt perfect but Minnesota obviously can‚Äôt develop talent for shit and they‚Äôve proven time and time again they can‚Äôt build teams either. Even the perfect version of KAT is probably not taking this team to the playoffs in the West.
"You're talking about the man that cried because Jimmy Butler, the man that carried them to the playoffs, was too hard  He should try to prove he's a star and carry his team to the playoffs before thinking about switching teams"
Jimmy Butler fits that even more imo
Dame is tradable only if Blazers decide to blow it up  Same for Jimmy if Miami is contending they are not trading Butler they would rather trade other players to get Butler some help.  Id say Clippers are more likely to trade Kawhi (because injury history and him possibly getting injured before being traded away) than PG
All the bucks fans actin like they wouldnt be bitchin if this was jimmy butler or smth against them in the playoffs
"JImmy Butler doesn‚Äôt use Bing, AskJeeves, or Yahoo search- he ain‚Äôt got time for that."
"What has Jimmy won as the best player on a team? Low playoff berths in the East?  I definitively rank KAT as more important to that team.  They were the 4th ranked offense in the league off of KAT's 36 minutes for 82 games with 21 ppg on 65% true shooting.   I know yall like to romanticize Butler but dude constantly struggled to be an 8th seed in the East and never made it past the first round without significant help. Went to the Wolves, barely scraped into an 8th seed again. Went to the 76ers, manages to get the 3rd seed... on a team that was the 3rd seed and had one less win than the previous season? Can't beat Kawhi despite having a starting lineup of Simmons, Redick, Butler, Tobias, and Embiid. Call me crazy but if I had to point at a reason that the Heat beat the Celtics and Bucks, it would be Bam.   So how has Butler proven to be a constant winner? By getting the 8th seed in a weak East?"
I trust him to develop one this off-season. Or at worst become mini Jimmy Butler

"""For that one game"" sir he had 35 and 40 point TDs in 2 games while Miami was down their primary ballhandler and their defensive anchor was injured. They started 2 rookies ffs.   Year 17 Bron is not ""built different"", he guarded Crowder as his primary defensive assignment while Jimmy guarded LeBron. The difference in effort was huge.   The sheer audacity to say Butler's conditioning was ""completely gassed"" when compared to a 35 year old player with lots of mileage on his body is insane lmao Butler is one of the real grinders out there."
"Kawhi hit this biggest shot, so sure. Jimmy also forced Brett Brown into changing the offence after Simmons and Embiid fell apart, and they looked the better team when the ball was in his hands in the half court. Kawhi got numbers, and at an above average efficiency for the 7 games as well, but that diminished from game to game. His leg got worse, Philly game planned on defense better, Jimmy got what he wanted when he wanted, even typing up game 7 with a layup before Kawhi hit a maircle jumper on his 39th field goal attempt. I'm glad Kawhi did because I've watched Toronto for over a decade and never thought I'd see them play in the finals, his jersey is even hanging on my wall. Having watched those games multiple times, Butler was on the same level down the stretch of that series. It's revisionist history to say that it was 1 v 4 when 3 of the 4 were just as inconsistent and shambolic ad Siakam and Lowry, who were swallowed alive by that defense. It was pretty much all Jimmy's doing. And if they go on to win that series with Kawhi not hitting his 39th shot, then yeah, I'd say it's because Jimmy took control of the offense and Toronto just ran out of gas."
"I got you. I‚Äôll go by the positions they are playing this year.   PG: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, CP3  SG: Paul George, Bradley Beal, Zach Lavine, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell   SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown  PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Julius Randle   C: Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Bam Adebayo, KAT   Top 10 in order:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard   4. Stephen Curry  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard"
I don‚Äôt know about best player in the series tho. It was practicallt kawhi vs butler simmons tobias and embiid. Only pascal showed up in that series. But for sure jimmy was dominant last year.
Please tell me who he‚Äôs better than   1. Kd 2. curry 3. Lebron  4. harden  5. kawhi 6. Giannis 7. Luka  8. Embiid  9. Jokic 10. Dame  11. AD 12. PG 13. Kyrie  14. jimmy butler  15. Beal
"Second best player? you really rate KAT over Butler?!   Jimmy has demonstrated over his career that he is a winning player. KAT is a hollow stats guy, puts up numbers but cant win ball games, and its beyond saying he needs help. If you are truly a high calibre player your team isnt the 29th or 30th ranked team in the league with you on it.  I consider KAT closer to DeMarcus Cousins than i do AD. AD elevates his team (yes even before coming to LA - they werent good, but you put AD on the wolves and they arent bottom of the league). DeMarcus PACKED the statsheet but could never get off the bottom. KAT is the guy that makes his own stats but doesnt help his team, doesnt raise the floor and therefore is a hollow stats guy and not a winning ball player. He is over rated for this reason."
Jimmy ‚ÄúHikaru Nakamura‚Äù Butler
"He definitely was. Simmons couldn't do anything on offense so they gave it to Jimmy and he got anything he wanted down the stretch of those games. Toronto couldn't hit anything so Kawhi had to take an absurd number of shots and rightfully so will be remembered for that series. But as someone who's supported the Raptors for over a decade and has a Kawhi jersey hanging on my wall, Butler was on the same level that series."
"Lol were you caping for Jason fucking Garrett on the r/nfl sub literally at the same time you were talking shit about ‚Äúloser‚Äù Jimmy Butler?  &gt; Tbf if he had a QB who was better with his arm than with his legs, and an actual OL, I think he would get better results. Hard to pin it all on him when he hasn‚Äôt been given much to work with. WRs that can‚Äôt get open, OL full of inexperienced or just flat out mediocre players, etc.  True big brain stuff there!"

Gotta love Jimmy Butler. Would‚Äôve loved to see him in green
I fucking love Jimmy Butler.
"The fact that the T-Wolves had 1 playoff appearance since 2005, and that playoff run was because of Jimmy Butler only makes his reputation more legendary."
"IMO Butler.  ~60 games for julius vs ~40 for butler, 21/7/7 for jimmy vs 24/10/6 for julius is pretty close, and jimmy is better on defense but julius has been good on that end"
"I was in McDonald‚Äôs eating a 20 piece chicken nugget meal when LeGiannis came in and ran with my FOOD! Luckily the security guard that was there was the one and only Jimmy Butler aka LeKumpo's FATHER, and he tackled LeGREEK and got me my food back!"
Umm okay? Still doesn't answer my question about u being salty over Jimmy Butler
Tyler Herro   Jimmy Butler    Ben Simmons   Zion Williamson    Pascal Siakam
Jimmy Butler the typa person to type www. before every website.
Jimmy Butler is pretty close.
Lmao right I need help meanwhile you are arguing about jimmy butler vs lebron and say one of the dumbest comments I've seen on reddit    Congrats
Look at Jimmy Butler at game 5 of the NBA finals. Dude did not fucking stop
"Miss me with Paul George, Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green etc   Jimmy is a great player. And last finals were only extended because of him. But by no means was he EVER a best player. Embiid needs to play a whole season. Paul George was a legend going against Lebron back in the day. But Wayoff P was never the best. Draymond really? Word..."
"I think about what Gilber Arenas talks about on good teams - who is the vocal leader of the wolves? Who is the alpha? Who is the guy kicking everyone‚Äôs ass when people are not doing their jobs?  Who is the draymond of this group, who is the dame, who is the udonis Harlem, who is the...jimmy butler?   I think the wolves have a little bit of a personnel identity problem.  Who is going to lead them, who is going to hold folks accountable?   They got a lot of young guys.  Rubio has been a good bet, but he‚Äôs not the super loud strong type.    They need some team leadership to rally everyone and be the bad guy at times."
"I can't help but think about the alternate future where we have Jimmy Butler, but also flip Simmons for Harden which could've been possible since with Jimmy here we probably(unfortunately) don't have Morey.   Harden/Butler/Harris/Embiid"
That's because he is Jordan's long lost son  Source: [https://www.sportscasting.com/a-look-at-the-insane-rumor-that-jimmy-butler-is-michael-jordans-illegitimate-son/](https://www.sportscasting.com/a-look-at-the-insane-rumor-that-jimmy-butler-is-michael-jordans-illegitimate-son/)
I'm very interested what Jimmy Butler would have to say about this
"Love Jimmy  I think Iggy is like 6 years older than Butler is but is definitely more ""in tune"" with things than Butler from what we can tell."
"I mean Lebron has taken multiple shit teams to finals, coexisted with older, younger, superstars and elevated multiple players.  The whole body language thing is always just nonsense, someone like Jimmy butler is seen as a great leader but look at him in Minnesota, I know there known now as weak but leadership is about adjustment and changing your style to fit everyone."
No one works harder at telling you how hard he works or how good he is than Jimmy Butler.  Cant wait to see him get his ass kicked in the playoffs. Man had one good postseason and thinks he's some superstar lmao. Man hasn't sniffed higher than a third team all-NBA spot and has only even made 3 out of 10 years.
I'd say the Wolves actually lost that trade since Jimmy Butler was a headache for them and was gone after just one season basically.
Beal is pretty amazing in how he can be the leading scorer while not really relying on his 3pt shot much at all.   When he drives he does some Jordan/Harden shit every time where he contorts his body in 5 different directions and somehow lays in this graceful layup through two big men.   Not to mention his 12-16 ft jumpers are all so silky.    Give me Beal/Russ + Jimmy Butler + Demar DeRozan + Capela and lets become the greatest team of the pre-Three era
"Jimmy Butler asked if he practises his jumpshot: ""I don't care. I really don't. I don't pay attention to it. I don't be on the court at 4 AM like that."""
"Ah yes, ""Perennial loser"" Jimmy Butler who made the NBA Finals and took the Lakers to 6 without Bam or his starting PG"
Imagine Jimmy Butler and Tim Duncan on the same team. What a team that would be.
I‚Äôm so sick of perennial losers like Dame and Jimmy Butler giving these ‚Äútough guy‚Äù ‚Äúembrace the grind‚Äù type of quotes with 0 hardware to back it up. Guys who are never a lock to get out of the first round talking as if the league runs through them.
"Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Fred VanVleet, Gordon Hayward, Jerami Grant, Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler  There were a lot of really good snubs. Tobias Harris isn't clearly ahead of that pack. Trae Young should have been next up if anything."
Jimmy Butler has to be one of the best players to lead a team personality wise alongside Westbrook
"Yeah Jo and Jimmy were and are incredibly tight.   Ben and Jimmy seemed to get along well personally, but both took issue with Brett Brown taking the ball out of Simmons‚Äô hands and having Jimmy run the offense in the playoffs, mostly because they hadn‚Äôt been doing that during the season. Jimmy mentioned Ben was frustrated by that and basically said he would be too in his position.  The Sixers mostly just fucked up by not giving Butler the unquestionable full max. He‚Äôs a massive asset to let go and only get Josh Richardson in return, and Jimmy only seemed to want to leave after they were wavering on him and reportedly asked if ‚Äúthey could control him.‚Äù   Despite the imperfect fit, Ben/Jo/Jimmy were incredibly good together."
"He would definitely be a top 5 offensive player, but people forget how bad he was defensively. Some of Larry Bird's best trash talk is about Dominique's defense. Considering how perimeter defense is way harder now, he would probably struggle a lot on that end. And unlike his time when big men dominated, wing players like him reign supreme now. Whatever advantages he would benefit from today's game on offense would be negated by the disadvantages on the defensive end.   Like everyone else said, his shooting wouldn't be a problem. He'd get to the rack every single time. It's not like he's Giannis or Ben Simmons either, in fact he's a better shooter than a guy like Jimmy Butler. His shooting wouldn't even come up in his criticisms. Like I said, his defense probably would.   He probably wouldn't have reached the Conference Finals in this era too. Even if it is not the case with CP3, I feel like we would've done him dirty about it too. I feel like we wouldn't have appreciated and respected him as much. The reason I think that is because every year he would lose to a team that had a comparable wing player like LeBron or Kawhi or even the likes of Tatum/Brown and Jimmy. There are no such guys to compare with CP3, only Steph and there were no such guys to compare Dominique back then only Bird."
"These people saying 2016 was a fluke are sort of right, but even in 2014 and 2015 Draymond was a much better shooter than he is now.  Green drilled a firm motion for years and years, and then when his body changed due to wear, injuries, and age, the results of performing that motion changed as well, and at that point it was already too hard-wored to adjust. Same thing happened to Jimmy Butler"

"This is how I know you don't watch much, and I'm not even a Harden fan. It's just being an objective basketball observer, Embiid is selling contact and flopping with the best of them, he'll rip through and throw his arms up with little attempt trying to make the shot. And you can't talk foul hunting without Jimmy Butler. Dude had entire games last year where he'd hunt Fts and act like he got snipped when drawing contact. You also have Trae Young who's pretty blatant with it."
"I think most would agree these guys are definitely better (when healthy):    - Giannis  - Harden  - Jokic  - Embiid  - LeBron  - KD  - Kawhi  - Curry   - AD   That‚Äôs 9 guys. Dame could arguably be #10. Luka has a good case for #10. I‚Äôd say Paul George and Jimmy Butler have solid cases too when they‚Äôre healthy and playing well. Tatum is right there too. I‚Äôd say those are the 13 players in the league with a lot of other guys having cases to be 14/15.    So, I‚Äôd say Dame is in the 13 for sure."
Jimmy Butler
"Yeah all those Bulls players. And even when they didn‚Äôt have major injuries guys like Joakim Noah dealt with minor injuries and soreness come playoff time from all the heavy minutes.  Even in Minnesota, Jimmy Butler and Zach LaVine both played very heavy minutes and got injured."
Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler
LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  He‚Äôs better then 15 of these guys? No. Cmon bro.
"LeBron  Curry  KD  Harden  Kawhi  Giannis  Embiid  Jokic  Dame  Luka  Paul George  Kyrie  Jayson Tatum  Jimmy Butler  Chris Paul  Devin Booker  Trae Young   Julias Randle  Jaylen Brown  Bam Adebayo  Ben Simmons  Zack LaVine  Nikola Vucevic  Bradley Beal  Rudy Gobert  Donovan Mitchell  Anthony Davis  CJ McCollum  Demar Derozan  Zion Williamson  Brandon Ingram  DeAaron Fox  SGA  KAT  Sabonis  Which five guys is he better than?  I think he has an argument, but it isn‚Äôt easily."
They had Jimmy Butler and Thibs and still coukdnt get KAT to be a winning player.    They're much better off with Cade or Mobley
"Man, is KAT a top 12 player? His stats look good and he checks a lot of boxes, but he just never wins, never seems to make his team better, and the only player he had issues with is Jimmy Butler (not excusing Butler completely).   I know basketball is a five man on the court sport, but KG did a lot more with the Wolves and heck AD did more with the Pelicans."
"Peak Noah was DPOY, played point center, and was 4th MVP voting. KAT is a very good scorer. Noah carried a team that started 33 year-olds Kurt Heinrich and Mike Dunleavy, washed Carlos Boozer, and year-3 Jimmy Butler (back when he was truly god awful on offense: 13 ppg while shooting 39% from the field and 28% from 3) to the 2 seed. Please stop saying KAT is better than Noah was."
"The whole Jimmy Buckets / Towns  feud in Minny, rumored to have been partially over Butler seducing Towns' then gf.     Actually, that's #2.  The first is Joe Smiths illegal sign that cost the wolves like 400 draft picks."
Jimmy Butler and the 3rd String Wolves is my favorite band.
"Outside of 2009 he doesn't have playoff success. In that aspect, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Jimmy Butler, and Paul George have been better yet guess who will be higher in all-time talks."
"you think a team wouldn‚Äôt have made the playoffs with Jimmy Butler, James Harden, Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic as the core of your team? lmaoooo y‚Äôall Miami fans something else"
Yeah but i think that‚Äôs got more to do with small market bias and attracting an audience. For national media like ESPN their job is to get ratings and guys like Steph are just more popular. For example Colin Cowherd on FS1 had a segment today where he said Chris Paul was his MVP and Jimmy Butler was top 3. Nonsense but it‚Äôll draw attention
Last years finals were fun bro. Jimmy butler went off and lebron got his 4th ring. Not sure why you didn‚Äôt enjoy it
Jimmy Butler and the Timberwolves
"**PG:** fuck Fred VanVleet, marry Malcolm Brogdon, kill Collin Sexton   **SG:** fuck Devin Booker, marry Donovan Mitchell, kill Zach Lavine   **SF:** fuck Jimmy Butler, marry Jayston Tatum, kill Paul George   **PF:** fuck Jerami Grant, marry Zion Williamson, kill Julius Randle   **C:** fuck Nikola Jokic, marry Joel Embiid, kill Anthony Davis    I really didn't want to kill Julius Randle but I guess them's the breaks. Fun exercise OP, thanks for posting."
"&gt; doesn't seem fun at all  This. They always talk about the feeling of winning a championship, that nothing else compares to it. Basically 15 guys have fun per year (and not before quite a lot of pain). After winning a conference finals you're like... not allowed to be happy with that. Jimmy Fucking Butler was sad after last season, with all he accomplished. It sounds like a bad deal to me."
"Wiggins was definitely the more explosive athlete of the two, however he never had the natural feel to the game IMO.   His Knicks in high school and college were that he didn‚Äôt play aggressive enough, and then once he got to the NBA he was able to score but didn‚Äôt really have much else to contribute (wasn‚Äôt a good play maker, bad rebounder for his size/athleticism, wasn‚Äôt a great defender).   I‚Äôm not sure exactly what happened with him, but he had a big falling out with the Canadian National team (rumours were he was asking for a ton of money to play, wanted the team to guarantee roster spots for his brothers, and was fighting with Canada‚Äôs couch Tirano) and then I think there was issue that happened once the Timberwolves traded for Jimmy Butler and got Thibs are there coach.   Not completely sure if it was always a motivation/work ethic problem, but Wiggins career is very odd considering how explosive of an athlete he is. Definitely wasted potential there"
"When has Joel showed up more than Giannis lmao? He had Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons and couldn‚Äôt beat the Raps."
"Freddy, Collin, brogdon  Devin, Mitchell, lavine  Jimmy butler, Tatum, George   Zion, randle, grant  Davis, jokic, embiid"
Giannis LeBron Kawhi Paul George Zion Williamson. Pick Jimmy Butler or Jayson Tatum for the final spot   Those should be the forwards. Sorry Julius Randle and whomever else misses the cut.
"I think they are looking at KAT career as a whole since coming in and until now outside the Jimmy Butler year they havent really done much. They have been in the lottery almost every year. I agree this year is a wash due to injuries but you guys did have Wiggins, KAT, Rubio and Lavine at some point. KAT imo is talented enough where it should translate to wins but it hasnt to this point."
"Timberwolves made a win-now move too early.   I hated the Jimmy Butler trade when they made it, and it set their organization back a few years.   Besides that they are just a destination that really struggles to attract free agents. It has to be one of the least desirable NBA locations to live."
his ceiling is whatever the next evolution of Jimmy Butler is. Jimmy with a jumper.
For me I see him as the Next Jimmy Butler
"No, he really wants to win. Jimmy Butler is completely consumed by it. I love RJ, but Butler exists on an entirely different spiritual plane."
"They needed Jimmy Butler 3-4 years earlier is what they needed. And while I loved the Booze Cruise, he didn't have the offensive game to help Chicago get over the top and was an overall letdown of a signing."
"Jimmy Butler also has a negative wingspan. Obviously Herro won't come any close to that level, but wingspans are overrated. Having a huge wingspan is definitely a plus, especially in help defense, but you can have an awful wingspan and be average/passable on defense"
When was the last time Jimmy Butler took one shot in a half. He just chillin today just pass the ball to Robinson and Ariza
"Steph #1 by landslide, Russ is up there. Kyrie is exciting but I hate him. Jimmy Butler last year in the playoffs was electric"
Jimmy Butler and its not even close
"&gt; Im not talking about fucking jimmy butler having one season with a high ftr.  They have virtually the same career FTr lol.  &gt; They are also completely different players, and i don‚Äôt watch enough of jimmy butler to have an opinion on his play style.  How do you know they're completely different players in the way they draw fouls, if you dont actually watch Jimmy?  &gt; I understand the ridiculous of it but jimmy only takes like 13 shots a game anyway so when he starts getting calls his ftr jumps up much higher than other players. Its the same reasons centers are so high on that list.  Ah, so it's all fine and dandy to shoot 9 FTA a game in 13 shots, but 11 FTA in 25 shots is too much? Come the fuck on dude.  &gt; We are talking about James harden constantly season after season baiting for fouls.  They still are fouls, as explained a million times by the refs on twitter for everyone to see. There also like a gazillion youtube vids explaining how the rules work and why the narrative that Harden flops and travels is utter BS.  &gt; I‚Äôve also seen ref go on record and say calls that Harden got should not have been called.  Sauce?"
"&gt;  I am criticizing the part of his game i dislike.  So you're criticizing him because of something as subjective as taste? Not his ability?  Why? We're not talking about how exciting a player is, we're talking about how the same people who called Harden a 'statpadder' are now defending Steph for doing the exact same thing (putting the ball in the basket and winning games)  How do you not see the irony?  Edit: Jimmy Butler had a FT rate of 70% just last season. But he's a winner alright.  &gt; But again we were never talking about Butler either so its kinda irrelevant  It's not irrelevant. This is EXACTLY the problem. People CHOOSE to ignore all those instances (Giannis, Jimmy, Embiid, Lebron), but only focus on when Harden does it."
This is going to end up with Towns or Capela making all nba 3rd team over Jimmy Butler or Zion
"Whole lotta guys that blow our minds today, there won't be room in the history books for them. Anyone really gonna talk about Jimmy Butler? He's so godlike that the nba-viewing world collectively apologized last year for not treating him like a god. It'd take a quality documentary or else I predict that whole episode gets forgotten. On the other hand, he can and should do great things post-career. I trust him more than any other NBA player to have himself a strong second half.  I'm having a hard time envisioning a future where people spend any time talking about Zach LaVine, Bradley Beal, or KAT. But they have time left to change that. Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell are currently getting themselves off that list, so it's a thing that can be done."
Yeah i also gotta admit the media did shit on him for how the Chicago run ended and lets be honest since then jimmy has proved more than rondo and wade.   Straight up jimmy contributes to winning basketball but i think the reason he is on his fourth team as a star on only age like 30/31 is because for him its my way or the highway and he'll make his work environment uncomfortable. For sure the NBA is unlike any work environment i can imagine and i work on sets in Hollywood with the worst personalities but there should be a bit more professionalism.   All of that being said i wish we never paid wiggins and paid butler and him and kat got happily married ever after because thats a sick duo at its peak.   You to man! Nice level headed talk
"Exactly... Jimmy Butler is a disgrace, he is cheap.."
Enough with that cheap act already Jimmy Butler... Just stop getting publicity with that.  And shame on you..
It's the same reason why people back in the day didn't like dwight. The dude way a goof ball and talented. Say your a kobe type and driven to succeed. there is no clocking in and clocking. It is 24/7. Your in the gym before every else. Maybe Kat has learned a lot since Jimmy left. People change. One of the issues top 3 picks have if they're even a little bit good is that the organizations tend to baby them. WHich if you like butler where you were highly recruited and drafted a bit later. You had to pay your dues. Maybe jimmy thought he could teach a younger wolves team to be more driven. Instead they were like hey chill do and I think that rubbed jimmy the wrong way. Taking on Kat's personality. Part of the wolves lack of success falls on Kat's shoulders. You cant be part of a squad that thinks they need to tank for future success. You were supposed to be the answer. It should have stopped with you.
"That is no reason to behave to KAT this way  in public. Also Jimmy Butler thinks he is a superstar but he is not. Even true superstars don't behave to former teammates, who are younger, this way."
Because Jimmy Butler is a disgrace to the sport.. Cheap character.
Jimmy Butler is just cheap.. Lame.
"While I agree Bam locked down Towns, the matchup numbers aren‚Äôt correct... can‚Äôt be spreading false information crediting him for all the misses lol  Towns airballed two 3s with Dedmon and later on, Jimmy defending. While missing a layup off the roll with Dedmon guarding him, and a hook shot on a post up with Butler contesting.  2/6 vs Bam  3/5 vs Dedmon  1/3 vs Butler  1/1 vs Iguodala  Last basket was an open dunk... (Could say Dragic or Bam was responsible)"
"Honestly I'm just fucking sick of Miami fans taking everything Jimmy Butler said on his way out the door at face value. The amount of shit I've seen talked about KAT based on what are pretty much the same as comments from a bitter ex-girlfriend are absurd. It's honestly made me hate your fanbase. One player leaves the organization on bad terms and now it seems like everything he said is taken as gospel.  People that follow the timberwolves know more about the situation with Butler and all of the things that proceeded it. We may not know KAT personally, but we have seen way more people talking about his personality than just Jimmy Butler. So we take the word of the 20 or so people that speak highly of him over the word of the bitter ex.   I know that Miami fans want to stick behind their guy, but it's factual that he does have a history of locker room problems. Minnesota fans hate him for a good reason.   I'm sorry about the personal things I've said. I'm currently experiencing excruciating pain and I am a little loopy from the T3's even though they're not working.   Obviously that doesn't excuse it, but I hope it at least explains it a little.   Anyways, before I'm (rightfully) banned I'll say I take that back and I hope your family is safe."
You mean the one with Jimmy Butler lol?
"You're a fucking idiot. Attacking Jimmy Butler for his past is literally as personal as it gets. It has nothing to do with him being black and everything to do with him being a piece of shit.   &gt;given historical sentiment about our people and abandonment then you're lost.  This pretty much means that any ill feelings towards any black person are racist even if they have nothing to do with skin colour.  Also, you are really stretching the stereotypes to race bait here. There is no stereotype about black people not being loved by their mothers.  I hope Jimmy Butler has to retire due to reoccurring kidney stones and I hope someone you love gets cancer."
"Lol. Race has nothing to do with how much of a bitch you and Jimmy Butler are. Nothing i said had anything to do with race.  Anyways, Wolves have a better shot at making the playoffs next year than the heat.  Enjoy your Corona and meth infested state you bitch."
[Source?](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/jimmy-butler-record-vs-towns)
"When the Heat start to fall apart Jimmy Butler will blame everybody in that locker room but himself. Then he will request a trade.  Jimmy Butler is a toxic locker room presence who got jealous when the Wolves offered KAT a max and not him. His ego will never let him be the #2 on a team and his talent will never let him win a championship as a #1. Butler is a drama queen.  Miami is a team on decline and Minnesota is a team in the rise. The only reason Miami has a shot at making the playoffs is how weak the east is. But even of you do make the playoffs you will never win with Butler as your main guy.  Miami fans need to get off Butler's dick and stop acting like everything he says about someone he clearly doesn't like is true. You don't see KAT whining to the media about Jimmy for a reason. It's because he isn't so insecure he feels the need to talk about Jimmy in public. Jimmy is a fucking snitch who needs to keep his personal issues with KAT personal, and quit talking. The fact that KAT is still in his head enough that Butler still feels the need to talk shit tells you everything you need to know.  It has worked out in Miami so far, but it's always a matter of time with Jimmy. He will quit on the Heat the same way he's quit on literally every other team he's been on.   I guess it must be hard to stomach that your team's only star is a cancerous piece of shit whose own mother didn't even love him."
"Jimmy Butler to Jimmy, back to Jimmy Butler, up for the layup! OH! BLOCKED BY EDWARDS."
For a second I thought jimmy butler had just missed.
Who talked shit? Jimmy Butler went in the post-game talking nonsense and OP called it out with facts. No shots were taken at any of your players. Stop being so defensive.
"Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Dirk Nowitzki, Damian Lillard, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Amare Stoudmire, Shawn Marion, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Nikola Jokic, Manu Ginobilli, Tony Parker, Scottie Pippen, Paul George, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol, Joakhim Noah, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Andrei Kirilenko, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady...  That should be about 30 player drafted after the top 3 (which is the goal of tanking) and most of them have been late lottery picks, even some second rounder.  All these players let your franchise be a contender, or at least compete for the second round.  Sure you could nitpick on guys like Shawn Marion, AK47 or even Dray and Manu, but all these players are a product of clever drafting over mindless tanking for the first pick."
"Look, KAT seems like a nice guy, but he's not winning basketball games.     Since he entered league - wolves record:     \- '15-'16 = 29-53  \- '16-'17 = 31-51  \- '17-'18 = 47-35 (ONLY season with Butler, also only season over 44% winning.)  \- '18-'19 = 36-46  \- '19-'20 = 19-45  \- '20-'21 = 20-47  &amp;#x200B;  In the one and only season Butler was on the team, it suddenly jumps up to 57% winning, and no other season in KAT's entire career was over 44%.     Jimmy Butler may also have a bad attitude (not mutually exclusive), but he's proven he wins everywhere he goes and KAT doesn't."
"&gt; Imagine if the Cavs had traded Wiggins for a wing.. let¬¥s say Paul George or Jimmy Butler &gt;  &gt; 3 peat easy, at least 2 of 3  Damn, Bron needs all the help he can get. How about form a team the right way?"
"It was a scrimmage game, bench players can afford to go all out cuz they don't play in games that count.  And it's kind of like sucker punching someone by planning things out?  Jimmy butler only tried at practice to go to the media?"
"jimmy didn‚Äôt beat shit. drose said butler only scored a single bucket, which he even later admitted to himself. lying to rachel nichols when you only got 2 points is kinda weak huh don‚Äôt you think?"
"I feel like management destroyed his value more by not taking his trade demand seriously. Getting RoCo and Saric isn't bad. If KAT ever learned how to play quality defense I think those two players fit very nicely alongside him. Not like LaVine had that high of value when he was traded. Markkanen and Dunn are whatever. RoCo ended up getting a first for the Twolves.  I just put more of the blame on management and KAT than Butler. Jimmy had relatively low career earnings, a decent amount of miles on his body, and a shorter window of being a star/getting paid. He couldn't fuck around and be a nice guy. He had to look out for himself.  I'm honestly pretty disappointed in KAT's development. Apparently obesity runs in his family, but I think he has done a bad job taking care of himself. Jokic was able to make a body transformation in pretty short order. When I watched KAT at Kentucky I thought what really separated him from Okafor was his ability to move his feet on defense and be a presence there. I think his shoddy defensive play is a reflection on his effort both on and off the court. I just haven't seen any indication he wants to put in the time and effort it takes to be one of the best players in the league. Is he even a top 5 center right now? I would argue he isn't. That is pretty disappointing for what was one of the most promising players in the league a few years ago."
IDC how much I get down voted. Jimmy Butler is a POS
"The jimmy vs ant narrative is new to me and stupid as shit. Im a wolves fan but i still usually like butler and i always know how good he is and the impact he brings. That being said for some reason he clearly isn't over KAT and its odd for a 30 year old man and im glad KAT brought up rachel Nichols. I don't even hate on him for that but i just think its odd... The only thing I hate about what butler did was how he is ""all about the team"" but sat with general soreness, at least like AD didnt front and pretend to be the ultimate team player when leaving where as butler sat, did espn interviews and cussed out all his co workers and employers"
Simmons and Butler got along great. The team itself had great chemistry but Jimmy didn‚Äôt like Brett Brown. Can‚Äôt speak for other situations but Jimmy never had a problem with any of our players.
"&gt;I bet Jimmy wouldn't want to mess with Ant, we know where ant from. I stg seeing an Edwards trash talk with Jimmy Butler would be one for the books  What was the need for this? Ironically, it seems as if Butler and Ant would probably get along."
"&gt;Jimmy knows KAT more than anyone on here lol.  That is just an appeal to authority. Besides, you're going to take the word of someone who clearly has a personal vendetta against KAT? Garnett also knows KAT well and he had nothing but compliments for the way he worked. And Garnett isn't exactly known for withholding his opinion or letting laziness slide.   And if guarding LeBron is the metric for not being soft then why the fuck did Butler call Wiggins soft?  Face it. Butler and Miami fans are just salty that the Wolves have had their number. And Butler is a toxic player."
Brb flying to miami for the sole purpose of punching jimmy butler in the face.
Jimmy Butler leading Miami to the Finals last year proved to me there are culture issues in Minnesota that he didn‚Äôt like and couldn‚Äôt change. Butler won that one.
Like is Jimmy Butler not soft when he flops? But KAT is soft when he confronts Embiid?  I don't think any Heat fans watch enough of KAT to say he's soft.  You're just repeating what Butler said because you're on his dick.
Ahh good old jimmy ‚Äúlet me call Rachel Nichols real quick‚Äù butler. Ultimate tough guy/team player/
"&gt; what are you talking about my guy? Kobe had shaq for 3 rings and gasol and bynum for 2 on a stacked deep team.  Go rewatch the Spurs series lmao Shaq wasnt beating them without Kobe and vice versa. If you think Shaq could win without Kobe why didnt he do it in Orlando with Penny?  &gt;Gasol and bynum for 2 on a stacked deep team.  Bynum was injured for 80% of the games we won during the title years bud.   Gasol was an all-star sure but I think it's pretty hilarious that you bring up Pau but then said Jimmy had no one when Bam was literally putting up similar if not better numbers than Pau ever has last post season. Weird, right?  Heat fans are wildly defensive over Butler even worse than Kobestans tbh."
"Well let's compare the two shall we...  One is the greatest winner of all time, the other is Jimmy Butler."
"lol another post that was made by people caught up in the moment. Of course they would say that lmao PG had the worst playoff run of all time while Butler had the best.  However, the Bubble was a very weird setting and considering PG was struggling with depression at the time it makes sense given his drop off. It is a very close conversation between the 2 and I have them as 13 and 14 but Jimmy has not done enough to put himself above Paul George just yet"
"ok heres 20-25 (im not gonna do 25+) ppg scorers. i was curious so i looked. i think hes better (on offense) than only rozier and grant on offense (and im not even sure). i understand simmons plays a non-traditional role on the sixers, but seth is still wrong imo  List of 20-25 ppg scorers: Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton, Julius Randle, Nikola Vucevic, Brandon Ingram, Paul George, Jerami Grant, Russell Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Domantas Sabonis, Terry Rozier"
Jimmy Butler has outplayed LeBron fucking James in a Finals game. That's his legacy forever. Even if we never sniff the Finals ever again Jimmy's a Heat icon because of that run.
"No one said that Wiseman looked better than Edwards or LaMelo, that‚Äôs a straw man.   All I‚Äôm pointing out that as bad as Wiseman has looked, his stats aren‚Äôt that bad for a rookie. Giannis averaged 6.8 points on 51.8 TS% as a rookie. Jimmy Butler 2.6 points on 52.6 ts%.  All I‚Äôm saying is give the kid time. We‚Äôve seen plenty of players who weren‚Äôt all that good in their rookie season become stars."
Jimmy butler - certified sociopath
Heat playoff wins without Lebron past 17 years: 53  T Wolves playoff wins without Jimmy Butler past 17 years: 0  I'm super mad.
All these kids are wrong Jimmy fucked KAT‚Äôs gf and the guy literally did nothing about it. Butler punked him then and he‚Äôd do it again. KAT is too soft.
"Stats aren‚Äôt really a good indicator. Jimmy Is a significantly better defender and playmaker and elevates his team way more, which coincides with more wins. Kat puts up 25/10 every game just to still lose. It‚Äôs not all on him but he also doesn‚Äôt do much to actually help his team, at least compared to butler."
Why are you defending jimmy fucking butler
"As a big Jimmy Butler fan, this feels like the correct answer.  The league has changed a lot since the Jordan era with constant news reporting and social media, we are able to get more of a window in to their relationships than ever before.  MJ had one of the best public relations teams in human history."
It‚Äôs weird how much hate some stars get for not shooting 3s well but no one cares that Jimmy Butler has shot 20% this year.
I guess today is Jimmy Butler day on this sub
And that was without jimmy fucking butler too
anthony edwards reminds me of jimmy butler lmao
Bro Jimmy Butler literally just had some LeBron-tier finals carry job to make the Lakers sweat and he's not even top 30??
"You had me until you said Bam is better than Randle, clearly you are a big heat fanüòÇ if Jimmy Buckets and Bam are so good why are they 6th in the EAST... Julius Randle is leading the Knicks with little to no help. Bam looked fucking lost out there when Jimmy and Drag√¨ƒá were hurt. Speaking on this season only Randle &gt;&gt;&gt; Butler and Bam. You need to watch some more NBA buddy"
"As a neutral fan in this regard, jimmy butler is in fact that dude"
Just utterly proven winner Jimmy Butler.
Dude just got dropped off in the finals bruh you bugging imagine no rings Jimmy Butler being the king's father like bro are you ok?
Jimmy loves to talk when he‚Äôs winning.   Cricket Butler won‚Äôt chirp any other time.   Typical of petty folks with inferiority complexes.
"&gt;I‚Äôd rather have a winning player than someone who puts up empty stats that have led to no wins  It's called win shares, and KAT has higher per year.  &gt;Butler wins with the bulls, comes to the Wolves and they make the playoffs for the first time in what 15 years  After missing 30 games? That's him getting them there? On a team that when KAT was injured and it was just Jimmy he had a losing record? It's almost like having two good players makes a team better...  &gt;Butler is a winning player, KAT isn‚Äôt yet.  KAT has literally contributed to more wins per year than Jimmy has. Jimmy has been on *teams* with more wins. Do you see the difference or not yet."
"And yet by most accounts Rondo was a better leader for the young dudes on that Bulls team than Jimmy. If Rondo is that bad, what does it say about Butler than he was a worse leader than Rondo?"
Because jimmy butler is clearly an asshole a la Michael Jordan and KAT doesn‚Äôt spend all his effort and time worrying about winning basketball games
Rachel Nichols did the interview with Butler right after he beat the T Wolves starters with the third stringers  I love Jimmy but it was all very choreographed lol
Wtf did we even do??  Also you really must be a new fan...weird seeing a bulls flair and not supporting Jimmy Butler.
I‚Äôm a neutral party but I hate jimmy butler
Bro all it takes is a glance in your history to see you comment 15 times an hour for at least the last 24 hours... so when are you finding time to sleep? Unless you live somewhere where there‚Äôs more than 24 hours in a day??   I seriously can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre letting Jimmy Butler ruin your life like this. Go to therapy. There‚Äôs more to life than sports
Minneapolis is Edward‚Äôs city. Jimmy Bitch Butler is no longer welcome. GET THAT SHIT OUTTA HERE!

Both gonna have long careers in the league and hopefully in the future we all look back and laugh at the times we debated future MVP Ball vs future MVP Ant instead of spending time on important things like pointing out Jimmy Butler has a lower career PPG, APG, RPG, VORP/Y, WS/Y, TS, BPM and PER than KAT."
 Jimmy Butler more of an all-star asshole than an all-star basketball player
&gt;Got that ~~jimmy butler~~ KG dog and work ethic to him  FTFY
Facts. Highest ceiling. Superstar potential. Got that jimmy butler dog and work ethic to him too. Watch out now.
"Completely un-biased opinion from another franchise that thinks we‚Äôre rivals lol  TWolves fans should thank their lucky stars that a player as transcendent as Jimmy G Butler ever wore their jersey. When the second best player in franchise history was there for like 15 mins, you know your franchise ain‚Äôt it lol /trolling   But seriously, I really like what the Wolves are building and don‚Äôt hate them at all. Would love to see them get over the hump."
"Did you take Ant's dick out of your mouth before typing this?  &gt; I bet Jimmy wouldn't want to mess with Ant, we know where ant from   You think Butler is intimidated by a Timber Puppy?"
"Yep, easily:  He‚Äôs a mentor to the young guys and ant  He played this season even though he lost over 5 family members (that died) to Covid, including his mom  He stands up for his teammates  He donates to charity  He has monster dunks that can get the entire team hyped up  Like you can personally hate Towns if you want since you come off as a massive douche, but when your best reason for liking jimmy ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 1-4 against the wolves‚Äù Butler is because he‚Äôs a ‚Äúdog‚Äù (???) then I feel like this conversation is with a 12 year old and it‚Äôs going no where."
You speak the truth but reddit sucks off Jimmy ‚Äú1-4 against the wolves‚Äù Butler and you‚Äôre never going to win this argument
Everyone should be offended what Butler did. He might had good reasons but inviting the media (especially Nichols) to talk subtext shit about your teammates was such a trash move. Even if he was right and his path was more successful after that.  It's a move I won't forget Jimmy Butler.
"Wolves fans have every reason to feel some type of way about Butler. The man openly trashed their franchise a year or so after they traded future assets for him. I mean, look at LaVine, maaaaan.  Jimmy going in on KAT comes off so out of pocket. I honestly wouldn't expect it, with Towns' year of tragedy losing his mom and 6 other family members to fucking COVID. This the first time they've met on the court since the nightmare that was 2020.   KAT had to have said something to get it poppin ... but the ""call Rachel"" line absolutely wins it for me."
"And it's not like a Pels fan is trying to play tough against Jimmy ""literally carried a team to the Finals 12 months ago"" Butler, ffs."
Lmao sure. That's why I am making constantly threads about Jimmy Butler and poking a voodoo doll with needles because he's rent free in my head üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
"when people say KAT is soft and jimmy butler is tough, what they're really saying is jimmy butler is good at PR. bunch of nonsense everywhere. let me know when jimmy's entire family dies of covid and he plays the season"
He‚Äôs not wrong tho. What has KAT done in his career to not be considered a loser? He can‚Äôt lead his team to the playoffs. He‚Äôs always on one of the worst teams in the league. The dude hasn‚Äôt done anything to prove Jimmy wrong. And this is coming from a huge KAT fan.  They could have called Butler childish or immature but calling him soft is wrong
Butler has had success before he teamed up with KAT and after he teamed up with KAT. KAT has only had success when he played with Butler.  KAT needed Jimmy way more than Jimmy needed KAT
When did people start disliking jimmy butler again lmfao.  This is amazing trash talk. I like KAT a lot but the knock on him has been that he‚Äôs soft for years and jimmy got to see it first hand. He and Wiggins are cool despite Wiggins not being 1/3rd the player KAT is so it‚Äôs doubtful that Jimmy is just making shit up.
"KAT gets the W for the smart ""Call Rachael"" clapback while Jimmy Bugs Butler got those 12 year old insults."
"&gt; while having the sixers flair  Who cares?  It's a conversation about Jimmy Butler and Karl-Anthony Towns.  A 60 year old Knicks fan could be the wisest basketball fan ever but you're gonna be like ""lol you're a Knicks fan, you're dumb""?"
"[Anthony Edwards on KAT's trash talk with Jimmy Butler: ""Man, they grown men, dog. They just be talkin, havin a regular conversation, if you ask me... It's no competition if we not talkin sh\*t to each other.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/n7ggu9/anthony_edwards_on_kats_trash_talk_with_jimmy/)"
Jimmy Butler is the quintessential NBA fake tough guy.
"So what is toughness exactly? KAT could literally give Jimmy Butler a swirlie if he wanted to lol, but he doesn't have anything to gain by doing it."
https://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/27/14411488/rajon-rondo-dwyane-wade-jimmy-butler-chicago-bulls-instagram  Got you that link to talk shit with
https://www.gq.com/story/rookie-of-the-year-anthony-edwards  &gt; (Allen Iverson) just himself. He reminds me of myself. I don‚Äôt really care how people view me. I‚Äômma be myself no matter what. That‚Äôs what I like about him and also about Jimmy Butler. When I started to [read on and watch Jimmy Butler](https://www.gq.com/story/Jimmy-butler-vs-the-world). He‚Äôs himself no matter what.  https://youtu.be/iPa8o9mkhMo?t=16m
"He fucking called Rachel Nichols to fly out and do an interview about it dude. He left 3 teams in 3 years but sure it's just the Wolves. One thing Jimmy made up? Let me again refer you to the title of this post: ""Jimmy Butler in his post game interview said Bam locked up KAT but KAT had: 27 Points on 8/16 FG while shooting 9/11 FT‚Äôs along with 6 Rebounds &amp; 4 Assists"""
"Which has nothing to do with Jimmy Butler.  Or KAT, for that matter."
"Poorly worded for reddit reactions, but it's true. KAT is not a tone-setting leader and it's hurt Minnesota. There's a reason Jimmy Butler made such an impact on the team and it looks like Ant has the potential to replicate that."
Literally don‚Äôt think about him until we play you clowns. You lot on Reddit must think you‚Äôre actually Jimmy fuckin Butler the way you walk around with your heads up your asses
Are we gonna act like KAT isn‚Äôt a better player than Butler?  Also Jimmy couldn‚Äôt lead Minnesota or Philly to the finals so yeah.
Can‚Äôt stand jimmy butler
"Beal's morale is up now and is unlikely to be traded unless the Wizards haven't made any progress by the deadline. Same with Zach Lavine, who I see getting traded if the team keeps sucking by the deadline.  Siakam is the only guy yall could get right now, and honestly he's a decent fit. Maybe Jimmy Butler is the absolute best *if* the usual reports about his drama with the team lead to a trade, but I doubt it."
Has even happened in the East very recently. The only time Jimmy Butler missed the playoffs in his career was actually with a winning record at 42-40. The Wizards also missed the playoffs that year at 41-41.
Good question - It‚Äôs interesting to see the differences in all the comments.  Duncan Ginobili  Magic Shaq Dirk Rondo Dame Curry Embiid Jimmy Butler
I just got out of a thread full of people telling me it's great that Jimmy Butler is yelling at teammates and shit lol..
This man is the Jimmy Butler of agents
Jimmy Butler??
It's fucking Jimmy Butler  This is such a non story lol
Paging Jimmy Butler about to run his ass off his 3rd team
"This 50 points shit is so dumb, TJ Warren scored 53 points and some nephews said he was better than Jimmy Butler. Where‚Äôs TJ Warren now? Where‚Äôs his ceiling? KPJ got hot on the worse team with the greenest of light. Yall need to just watch the game and let them develop."
‚ÄúBreaking News: Jimmy Butler is Jimmy Butler‚Äù
"Bulls traded him so they could tank, has been one of the worst teams in the NBA since  Timberwolves made the playoffs for the first time in 13 years and immediately went back to one of the worst teams in the NBA since  76ers, left as a free agent (sign and trade) after they didn't want to pay him?   Heat, 10th seed the previous year, immediately made the NBA finals?  Jimmy Butler is very clearly a toxic teammate that destroys teams when he joins them."
"it depends, I do not think LeBron has been the undisputed best regular season player in the last 6 years, because dudes like Harden &amp; Giannis &amp; Curry went all out to have tremendous seasons while LeBron was coasting to save energy for the playoffs.  If I had to pick one guy to win one game or one playoff series to save my life I would take LeBron, although KD in 2017 &amp; 2018 is right there.  If we're making tiers of NBA players, it's LeBron/KD/Curry in the top tier for me and you could argue that LeBron belongs in his own tier.  But that's only 3 guys, and the next tier is considerably larger: Harden, Jokic, Giannis, Kawhi, Luka, Embiid, Dame, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie.  Any of those dudes could be the best player in the world, that's 10+ guys."
Jimmy Butler
"I think it's important to note that Jimmy Butler is Bernie Lee's only big client. After him, the next biggest are Justin Holiday, Mike James, and Isaiah Thomas. Not exactly the clientele to benefit from sports reporters or insiders."
"For that reason I prefer to think about it in tiers.  Tier 1 (No particular order): Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Luka, Jokic, Steph, AD, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal.  Tier 2: CP3, PG, Kyrie, Klay (if healthy), Lavine, Randle, Tatum, J. Brown, Jimmy Butler, Trae, KAT, Donovan Mitchell, DBook.  Tier 3: Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, Siakim, Ja Morant, Vucevic, CJ McCollum, Jamal Murray,.....etc. You get the picture.  Tier 4 is essentially good role players with tier 5 being good bench players and tier 6 being situational guys and backups."
Jimmy Butler told the media that he wanted to be the point guard of the Chicago bulls when d rose was back from injury. I don't doubt he's a problem
Jimmy Butler is heel incarnate (I love him but his personality is very much a heel imo)
"At one point in a playoffs, sources said, Butler turned to GM Andy Elisburg and screamed, ""I (bleeping) chose you. I can't win without you."" Butler left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the Jimmy in every way. Jimmy's gone."
maybe but i've seen you around wolves threads before and all you do is talk shit so i think you'd say so either way. you're like a jimmy butler burner account.
Yep. Michael Jordan to Richard Hamilton to Jimmy Butler.
"If anyone can handle Jimmy Butler, it's spo. Man had to deal with Wade, Bosh and Lebron for 4 years. Hell, he got cuss tf out by wade during a TO and he didn't even blink."
That‚Äôs just a normal Jimmy Butler season
"I saw Jimmy Butler at a grocery store in Miami yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
Well no one expected kawhi and jimmy butler to be superstar level players but here we are.
"Yeah Embiid must have chased Jimmy off the team too, oh no wait Butler just wanted his money. Also Jimmy lost to the Minnesota third stringers in an actual NBA game so maybe you're just underrating the third stringers?"
"Butler is in a different breed than most NBA players. It‚Äôs just not about working out, it‚Äôs about how much time they apply to the mental side of the game. Jimmy clearly watched more game tape than most people, if not all other players in the league. It‚Äôs the reason why he‚Äôs a ‚Äúwalking winning play‚Äù as Zach Lowe would say, because he‚Äôs put in so many hours going over game tape to learn more about the game."
Jimmy Butler is basically the Joe Pesci character in any Scorsese film.
So you‚Äôre gonna tell me that how they perform for their team throughout their career is irrelevant to how good a player is? If your definition is someone who can be number one on a championship team then where is Jimmy butler?
"So y'all just straight up lying then, huh? I seriously doubt Jimmy Butler threw a bowl of soup at someone. In fact, I met him one time at a barber shop and he was an absolute gentleman. He even went out of his way to breastfeed my niece. Nice guy, really chill about it."
Well this definitely sounds like the measured response of someone denying a completely untrue allegation. And this would be so out of character for Jimmy Butler that I instantly believe his agent
"I literally said out loud ‚Äúno fucking shit, it‚Äôs jimmy butler‚Äù when I read the headline haha"
So which team is Jimmy Butler gonna get traded to this summer?
No surprise. It‚Äôs Jimmy Butler
"https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-vs-jimmy-butler  Kevin Durant has averaged 29.0 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists in 10 games versus Jimmy Butler in his career."
"He could win a Finals as the best player, but not in the same way that Lebron does. He would need 2 guys who are studs that are only slightly worse than him, maybe like Jimmy Butler and Dame"
This is because KAT is a soft guy who doesn't work hard enough to win. Jimmy butler exposed him
"Jokic, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler are the 3 players that come to mind."
"I don't think you're arguing against anything I said because I agree with your statement. Being the #1 option on a contending team doesn't make a player top 5 automatically. Jimmy Butler was the #1 option in the Heat and his team was two games away from winning the whole thing. on the other hand, Just because a player didn't lead his team to contention, doesn't automatically exclude him from the conversation (again, depends on that player's situation).  We can look at players and assess their value and what they bring to their team irrespective of this arbitrary criterion of being a #1 option."
Jimmy Butler.
Kind of surprised to see Jimmy Butler projected on All-NBA second team.  Thought that slot might go to Mitchell or Beal
"The Lakers, Philadelphia and New York are the standouts to me. Philadelphia have a lot of great defensive personnel; and the Lakers and Knicks are coached really well defensively. Gobert and Embiid are great at rim protection. Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons, Thybulle, Caruso and Jrue Holiday are great on the perimeter. Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Draymond Green and Giannis are great help defenders."
I'm triggered Jimmy Butler can't even make top 15
"He wasn't relegated to being the fourth option. He was the fourth option because the first three were:  Joel Embiid  Jimmy Butler  Tobias Harris  I am obviously a huge Ben fan but I want all of those players taking shots before Ben unless it's in transition or there is a mismatch in the post.   I am not worried because I watch every Sixers game and have seen the difference between how he's used this season and last. Idk if it's Ben being more willing to do the little things or just Docs coaching and schemes but he has been incredibly useful on offense, while shooting less frequently than ever.   So if we lose to the Bucks or Nets or whatever I am almost certainly not gonna blame the guy that averages (at least not only him) 14-15ppg for averaging 10-12ppg. If he's turning the ball over or getting roasted on the other end, or not pushing the pace then that's one thing. That's what he does for this team. But him not being a jumpshooter doesn't matter to the current iteration of the Sixers. They know he can't and that's why it isn't important for him to score in our offense.   The example you used is really my point exactly. The Bucks depended on MVP Giannis to score 25+ a game. He is their superstar number one option. His deficiencies caused him to not score efficiently or at his normal numbers. That hurt the team. Simmons isn't our primary or secondary scorer, he's our primary facilitator. He needs to be able to do that and a lack of a jumper is not likely to hinder that ability since it hasn't all season. The regular season does matter I'm sorry it does. It's not the playoffs but it is important.   And I know you might want to say that his limitations will hurt Embiid, but trust me they won't. Doc knows how to use Ben to make Embiid's life easier and he's been doing so all year. The playoffs won't change the fact that you can't just leave Ben wide open in the dunker's spot or when he cuts to the rim.   So no, I'm not worried about that. I have concerns, but not that Ben won't be able to score enough for us to win, because that's not typically how we win anyway."
"&gt; butler and nunn  I can tell you don't watch Heat games, just like the rest of /r/nba. Nunn is NOT a positive defender. The only positive defenders on the Heat are Bam, Jimmy, Ariza and Iggy. The rest are below average defenders."

"Jimmy Butler then. The point is that the lines are more blurred than ever in positional roles. Forwards and Cs can initiate offensive sets, Bam or Jokic, and PGs can play heaps of off ball minutes."
Top 10 (This Season):  1. Nikola Jokiƒá - 11 2. Russell Westbrook - 9 3. Luka Donƒçiƒá - 5 4. Domantas Sabonis  - 5 5. Ben Simmons - 3 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo- 3 7. LeBron James - 2 8. Draymond Green - 2 9. Kevin Durant - 2 10. Jimmy Butler - 2 10. Julius Randle - 2 10. Malcolm Brogdon - 2
That 76ers team also had Jimmy Butler though too lol.
Jimmy Butler won 2 games against the Lakers when his two best teamates were hurt. Putting up a 40 point triple double while guarding Lebron James. This was after Lebron James talked shit the game before. Jimmy did this with a hurt ankle.  I'd shut up if I was the owner. This is not a guy you want to play in the first round. Nor someone you want to irritate in any way before a playoff match up.
Pretty confident. If the Bucks beat us 4 times they are the better team and they move onto the second round. But I truly feel like the Heat are playing their best basketball right now going into the playoffs.   Also it‚Äôs not over until we lose or win four times.   ‚ÄúFirst to 16 wins.‚Äù-Jimmy Butler today.
"Had it not been for COVID, Miami Heat would‚Äôve been 4th seed for sure. Bright side, Jimmy Butler has been sat out for the last few games, fresh just in time."
In a game where the Heat sat Jimmy Butler the Bucks went full force on a game that is meaningless for their own seeding but high stakes for Miami's seeding
"Harden, Curry, Jimmy Butler, Lebron, Jokic. The ball movement would be phenomenal."
Jimmy Butler = Your father
"That streaky run in the bubble last year really went to all your heads didn't it? Haven't truly been relevant since LeBron left, still aren't. A team that lives and dies by the play of Jimmy Butler right now, goodluck with that in the playoffs."
"I'm just talking shit, sorry.  I've always liked Jimmy Butler.  He did say in an interview (that I can't find) that if the ""team makes it to the playoffs, he will take care of the rest.""  Dumb joke on my part:)"
Jimmy Butler literally just said that the HEAT are going to the finals again this year... this man Does Not Lie!
"Monty Williams did a hell of a job . But it's gotta be thibs. Shame the man only won it once in Chicago. Dude whipped the Knicks into shape . That's what he does , they weren't open to it in Minnesota , that's their loss. He's a great fucking coach , culture changer , talent developer. I love what he did with that roster. I'm fan of the man since he was running the Celtics defense . RJ Barrett looking like he's gonna be legit two way star , like Jimmy Butler turned out to be . Julius Randle looking like the new Mr knick . Thibs is the man . I never forgave the bulls for firing him , it was always them and the Celtics for me , now I find it hard to root for the bulls , I even find the new regimes moves stupid. Still sour about that one. One more beer and I'm going to bed."
the celtics rebuilt off of a rediculously lopsided trade off of their three HOF players that were way past their prime. most teams dont have that.  &amp;#x200B;  as for Miami and Brooklyn they're basically the two most desirable locations for free agents to go to becuz who wouldnt want to be a young multimillionaire in miami or NYC?  &amp;#x200B;  its hard to imagine a place like indiana/milwalkee/OKC/any other bumbleshit city signing jimmy butler or KD/kyrie/harden.
"This is what happens when you have two non-NBA caliber coaches, including possibly the worst coach in NBA history over a 4 year stretch. It was shameful the way the front office kicked out Thibs, despite the players playing their asses off for him, and him navigating the team to consistent playoff appearances despite all the injury bad luck.  We got somewhat lucky in 2016-2017 that Jimmy Butler took over the coaching job in the second half of the season."
gafford needs a playmaker that the bulls didnt have. lopez did well for the bulls. i dont know exactly how important of a role player hutchinson really is. carter was pretty good defensively for the bulls he just had garbage support/system around him. jimmy butler was very good for the bulls. rondo went to go play with lebron. i dont get this post.
"Iggy is beyond washed, Dragic is a mediocre defender, Butler is obviously elite, and Dipo is injured rn but washed anyway (and is a mediocre defender). Robinson is a bad defender.   You're just propping up everyone to make Dray look better. Bam is carrying a bad defensive supporting cast outside of Jimmy, and is better than Draymond. And that's no slight to Draymond because he's still a Top 5 defender in my eyes, but Bam is better now"
Easy Micheal Jordan and Jimmy Butler 1 degree of seperation
"At same time Jimmy Butler:  Jimmy Butler says, ""I think I'm stupidly locked in. The amount of film that I've watched, the amount of time I've spent on the court working on my game.""  Source: https://mobile.twitter.com/BradyHawk305/status/1395501117178589190"
Jimmy Butler took away his competitiveness?
"Wolves game, regular season on the eve of the Trade Deadline.  Something like a 24-point deficit overcome culminating in a block on Jimmy Butler and then a wicked fadeaway.   Celebration he completely ignores IT (who was COMPLETELY toxic for Cavs) pretty much KNOWING he would be traded the next day.  Still rings out as such a beautiful game to me"
"dude this is real life and not anime. he‚Äôs doing his best to win so y‚Äôall don‚Äôt hang that shit over his head. I mean people don‚Äôt shit as hard on curry on trying to sell that 3 pt foul at the end, or hardens or jimmy butler foul baiting, or CP3 or Rondo dirty antics, etc. these people and lebron and ultimate competitors so you can‚Äôt blame them from doing whatever within the rule to their advantage."
"Bro we were literally able to get Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris from moves he made two years prior. He literally said he shuddered at the lost opportunity of signing Robert Covington as an UDFA when Houston picked him up. He didn't just suck and guess, he was building something that stood the test of time (BC and EB). Jerami Grant, Nerlens Noel, Richard Holmes, TJ McConnell to name a few pieces that would be really beneficial to contenders not as stars but as high-mid level bench pieces"
Jimmy Butler.
"What other options would be there, a jimmy butler/Paul George level player? That‚Äôs a long way from what they currently have now"

I mean and also that guy named jimmy Butler
"The thing with Chris Paul is that he‚Äôs an incredible game manager. The thing with LeBron is that he‚Äôs better than Chris and he‚Äôs got the body of LeBron James.  Booker is an unknown at this point. We kind of saw it last season where Jimmy Butler rose to the occasion, match LeBron, to have an all-time game and beat an on-fire Lakers team. But the next night? LeBron did it again and Butler wasn‚Äôt there.   Booker is gonna have to match LeBron for a best of 7 games. Anything is possible but I‚Äôm pretty confident the Lakers are the favorites."
"Edwards actually has a decent coach rn, and looked abysmal under Saunders.   and With Wiggins, he was really forced into some fucking shit. He was forced to be a Franchise player, when all the scouting said he was another version of Pippen. Tall, has IQ but should not be your first scoring option.    Then he got thrown into second worst franchise the last 2 decades, the Minnesota Timberwolves.  And after all that shit, whilst he's young, he gets paired with Jimmy fucking Butler enough to traumatise any kid.    He's finally in a system that fits his style, where he gets to play off the ball, make his cuts and dominate on the defensive end whilst still being able to put up 19-20ppg."
"I think Brooks is a very good wing defender, but I don't think he's better than Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby, Matisse Thybulle, Dort, Draymond, or Jimmy Butler.  And it's hard to label defensive positions with all the switching now. Brooks is a wing defender who just defended Steph Curry, a small guard. We've seen OG Anunoby and Draymond guard like every position."
The jimmy butler disrespect  How soon they forget
"Jimmy Butler was right. If you are playing a LeBron team like the Lakers, you are going to have to play nearly perfect. If you start being sloppy with the ball or stagnant on offense, then this dude is going to always beat you."
In the words of Jimmy Butler üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"That‚Äôs definitely not true, and certainly not when the questions are fair. People think Trea Young might struggle in the playoffs because teams will spend 48 minutes going at him on and he won‚Äôt hold up. If he gets roasted on defence by Kicks you think he won‚Äôt take some shit? You think Luka wouldn‚Äôt have took shit if the Clips locked him? That the Luka struggles vs length and athleticism questions wouldn‚Äôt be talked about?  Embiid is a great player, it‚Äôs also totally fair to question how he is going to handle doubles and traps when he has struggled to deal with them in the past. It‚Äôs also not his fault Philly has no perimeter creator, but also fair to ask if a team without one can make a finals.  And, na Jimmy was the most important player on that Sixers team. That Raptors series would have been wrap in 5 without him. Philly couldn‚Äôt do anything on offence that didn‚Äôt involve Butler.  If Giannis has questions to answer about his playoff ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù namely shot creation in winning time, you think Embiid is somehow above it?"
"I'm really curious to see what kind of defense they roll out against Steph. We did a good job of shutting down Harden and Dame in last year's playoffs, but Jamal Murray and Jimmy Butler went off against us. [KCP has historically done well against Curry](https://twitter.com/SamQuinnCBS/status/1394321817146380291), plus we have Mathews, Caruso and THT to run around chasing him if KCP gets tired."
"&gt;so he would be a superstar if he didn‚Äôt drive away Jimmy Butler ?  nope, he would be a superstar if butler stayed and they continued making the playoffs so KAT can showcase his best bigman scoring/passing abilities in the league (As you say), and use those skills to reach the semi's/conference finals  &amp;#x200B;  to put it simply, he's going off in the regular season, that's cool but we aren't going to call him a superstar if he's not going off in the playoffs and making deep runs, and as i said; by driving away butler, he threw away his teams playoff ticket so he's just seen as a regular season performer"
so he would be a superstar if he didn‚Äôt drive away Jimmy Butler ?   you see the issue with evaluating players based on the win loss column right
I have a Jimmy butler sixers jersey so I kinda know how he feels
"We had Embiid, Ben, Tobi, AND Jimmy fucking Butler on one team, with an unwashed JJ Redick.   Greg Monroe aside, I don‚Äôt think people realize how good we were / could‚Äôve been. Just had such limited time to play together before the playoffs, and Embiid had the shits that Raptors series. We had all the momentum leading up to that game 7 shot, Butler played insane to get the game tied when we looked dead. If that ball bounces out I truly believe we win in OT and go deep enough (if not win it all) that Jimmy re-signs with us"

Jimmy butler is underrated id take him over dame
"Lakers ""neutralized"" Duncan Robinson in the finals last year and even then Jimmy Butler got a ton of space from KCP having to faceguard him"
Is that Jimmy Butler in the first pic in the middle.
"Came in at the very end of the night with 2 smoking hot chicks.  He was being obnoxious as hell.  He ordered food, scarfed it down and immediately left without tipping or paying for the food or drinks.  On the other hand I had Jimmy Butler in.  Awesome dude, couldn‚Äôt be nicer.  Also Shawn Marion is cool as hell too."
&gt;The Sacramento Kings have the league's longest playoff drought at 15 seasons  There but for the grace of Jimmy Butler go the Timberwolves.
Except Jimmy Butler
"&gt;They might add Jimmy Butler, Paul George and Zion if they're feeling generous. That's basically the ""they could be an MVP candidate if everything goes right"" group. If I missed someone, let me know.  I don't really watch a lot of either team but I feel like I'd pick Beal or WB before Zion, this is picking nits obviously"
I always think of Jimmy Butler with the Ninja band
"Jimmy Butler is bad perimeter defender? May be RJ Barrett is better? NY run Barrett-Payton-Bullock on perimeter, dont tell me they are better than what we had.   Also, I like the confidence of NY fans. All credit to Thibs for changing the culture, but you guys were one of the worst teams for last 10 years while being in New York, city that all free agents want to come to. And dont tell me you all expected to be 5th before the season."
"In the past 40 years, only one MVP winner had missed more than 10 games, and that was Allen Iverson in 2001 who missed 11. So we can basically say that 10 games is the absolute limit of what you can miss and still be a candidate.  If I asked most fans to name the elite guys in the NBA right now, in no particular order, they'd probably agree on LeBron, Steph, KD, AD, Giannis, Luka, Dame, Jokic, Kawhi, Harden and Kawhi. They might add Jimmy Butler, Paul George and Zion if they're feeling generous. That's basically the ""they could be an MVP candidate if everything goes right"" group. If I missed someone, let me know.  From that group of 14 players, just **four** missed ten games or fewer. 70% of the MVP pool was wiped out by Covid or injuries. That leaves Steph (on an 8th place team), Luka (who had a down year), Dame (who didn't really stand out in any category) and Jokic (who was legitimately outstanding).  I don't want to say Jokic won by default, because his season was good enough to win even in a more competitive year, but...yeah, he was pretty much the only candidate."
"The thing is you named 4 guys we can use in a closing lineup to guard Jimmy, and Thanasis would not be on the floor if those 4 guys are due to his offensive liabilities.  I think we have the personnel to match up just fine against Butler.  The questions will be coaching and execution."
"If we had key guys in foul trouble and Jimmy Butler was going off, I would have loved to see Thanasis guarding him over Pat/Bryn/Donte/just about anybody outside of Khris/Jrue/Giannis/mayyyybe PJ if he's feeling spry that day"
"I was torn also, Jimmy butler too could have got it I honestly gave the edge to Lebron because let‚Äôs be honest no chance to voters don‚Äôt vote him in just how it is"
"I truly don't understand the Curry hype. He had a tremendous second half of the season, but his first half was just kinda meh. The guy who I really think has been lost in this discussion is Jimmy Butler, who pretty quietly carried the Heat to a playoff spot. I'd put him 2nd. But Jokic is the pretty obvious first for me."
"&gt; No, he had siakam on him too and overall Raptors limited Giannis using zone defense and so preventing him to attack the rim. You just can't try the same with Luka  After game 2 was vast majority of time Kawhi  Nobody said it‚Äôs the same thing where we getting this these are obviously very different players   &gt;  so you need someone ready to spend a lot of energies doing that.  I don‚Äôt buy this idea guarding Giannis is somehow physically less taxing than Doncic. Defending superstars is a 5 man team effort. The idea I initially responded to that no coach would put their star on the opponents best player just isn‚Äôt in line with reality. Happens every postseason. Jimmy Butler was guarding Tatum and LeBron last year. We can debate the approach of how to guard Doncic whom should do it and how much Kawhi should guard him. But people have overcorrected on the idea of ‚Äúcan‚Äôt have top defenders guard top players because it‚Äôs too taxing on their offense‚Äù"
"&gt;If you can't take constructive criticism on how to format arguments properly  From someone who has not even attempted an argument.  Why on earth would I do that?  &gt;Your entire argument consists of ""You suck and I'm smarter than you"" as well as ""I have evidence, you're wrong.""   Actually, if you could read, which seems very much in doubt at this juncture, you would see that I posted my actual evidence very early on.  No one chose to comment on that evidence, particularly not you.  Instead, you chose pathetic ad hominem attacks, for the obvious reason that you have no counter argument at all.  &gt;Not a single person believes you because you don't actually respond.  I have responded to each and every comment.  None contained any arguments to speak of, but I took the time to respond anyway.  &gt;You're literally arguing against nobody when you say ""Nobody has provided evidence against my claim"" because nobody HAS to provide evidence.   When I have already provided evidence proving the point, then yes, you and anyone else questioning do precisely need to provide counter evidence, or, frankly, just be quiet.  &gt; You didn't actually respond to me.   You have not posted one word worthy of a response, and yet I'm wasting my time educating you.  &gt;You probably know ""I'm willing to bet"" is a phrase that isn't meant to be taken literally, I didn't actually mean that.   Don't hurt yourself backpedaling so fast.  Don't say things you don't mean, if you don't want to be called on them, and embarrassed.  &gt;My point was that if you reread what say, MazKhan said at the start, it debunks the point.   Pick better allies.  That person did not even know about the trades I specified.  They challenged me to find one such trade -- I posted two, and they ran away, embarrassed.  &gt; And if you REALLY so badly want me to debate you   Honestly, I'd prefer you just say ""Thank you"" and remain quiet.  &gt;unless you can without a shadow of a doubt prove that Brandon Ingram would have made that buzzer beater with the Lakers or gotten them that far without making any assumptions, then the AD trade was a success.   Utter nonsense.  You cannot prove that Ingram would not have had a bubble campaign just like Davis' or better.  Or Ball.  Or Hart.  Or Hunter.  Or Zubac.  Or more to the point, that the combination of those five, plus whatever the Lakers did with that future draft capital would not have won last year and left the Lakers in far better shape for the next decade.  There are precious few NBA players who are better than 5 good NBA players combined, and Davis has never shown himself to be one.  &gt;If you can't, it successfully proves that AD was a net positive, making that trade good.   It proves nothing of the sort.  &gt;I don't even need to reiterate the Knicks flair MCzebo33's point on how valuable AD was to the team.   And why did Davis win nothing in New Orleans if he's so good?  Why is New Orleans' winning percentage this season better than all but two of Davis' seasons there?  Even though New Orleans only received part of what Los Angeles traded for Davis, and hasn't gotten to execute any of the picks yet, they are already better without him.  &gt;The fact is, you CAN'T prove that Lonzo would have developed enough to make that shot, so you can't prove your case.   More nonsense.  Ball is a better shooter from three than Davis, so he's more likely to have made that shot.  So is Ingram.  Hell, I might be a better three-point shooter than Davis.  You're going to have to do much better if you hope to avoid embarrassment here.  &gt; Nobody cares if the Blazers traded away Moses and still won a ring but they lost the trade   If you don't care about the point, why are you wasting my time?  Just go remain ignorant and quiet in a corner somewhere.  &gt;It's about the Lakers and if they won the trade. You objectively cannot prove this, it is why nearly every single comment you've made has been downvoted.   Nothing can be proven to your ridiculous standard -- including your claim.  &gt; Your argument fundamentally doesn't work because you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that they could have had that success without any assumptions.   And you cannot prove that the Lakers would lose last year without Davis.  And you cannot prove that the Lakers would not win multiple titles with all those players and picks they traded away.  &gt;  Jimmy Butler trade hypotheticals don't work because you're assuming that the NBA landscape is the same then and the debate devolves into fanfiction.   See, this is another example of you talking out of your asshole on a topic you nothing about.    Butler was traded on July 6, 2019.  The exact same day Anthony Davis was.  Better luck next time."
"If you can't take constructive criticism on how to format arguments properly, you can stick to losing all your debates and getting laughed at man. I didn't even use ad hominem either lmfao. Your entire argument consists of ""You suck and I'm smarter than you"" as well as ""I have evidence, you're wrong."" You just said I lost the bet but you still haven't provided evidence. Your entire argument fundamentally lacks structure because every time you say things like ""You're wrong, you lost that bet."" and ""No one has disproven me"" as well as ""Why can no one prove me wrong?"" or ""I've already debated this"" you aren't bringing up points. The people you're trying to convince of your relatively unpopular take will not believe you. Not a single person believes you because you don't actually respond. You're literally arguing against nobody when you say ""Nobody has provided evidence against my claim"" because nobody HAS to provide evidence. It is your job to convince them, you're the one with the unpopular opinion. I like that you quote people in your responses, that's something I like doing and more people should do it. It shows a direct response. But when you quote somebody, your next statement has to be directly tied to that.   &amp;#x200B;  Take this instance.   &gt;This isn't a debate, this is me telling you that you need to format and structure your arguments better.  ""So did you want to try and make an argument, or are you just going to pathetically stick with ad hominem attacks and losing bets?""  You didn't actually respond to me. What I said was about your structure of your argument. I explicitly said this isn't a debate on the AD trade. You shifted and made up me attacking you with ad hominem and losing bets. You probably know ""I'm willing to bet"" is a phrase that isn't meant to be taken literally, I didn't actually mean that. Your statement is completely unrelated in every way.   &amp;#x200B;  You did the same thing here:   ""There has been no argument presented that Portland and Los Angeles did not badly lose those trades, despite winning titles in those seasons. In fact, no such argument even exists. I've looked, and I've dared people that are far cleverer than you to find one, and no one has.""  I note that you snuck in some ad hominem to try and devalue your caricature of my point, your personal strawman. My point was that if you reread what say, MazKhan said at the start, it debunks the point. You didn't actually respond to me, you talked about your own point.   &amp;#x200B;  And if you REALLY so badly want me to debate you, unless you can without a shadow of a doubt prove that Brandon Ingram would have made that buzzer beater with the Lakers or gotten them that far without making any assumptions, then the AD trade was a success. If you can't, it successfully proves that AD was a net positive, making that trade good.    I don't even need to reiterate the Knicks flair MCzebo33's point on how valuable AD was to the team. (Funny enough, in that thread you did the same thing of not properly replying to what you quote.) The fact is, you CAN'T prove that Lonzo would have developed enough to make that shot, so you can't prove your case.    Nobody cares if the Blazers traded away Moses and still won a ring but they lost the trade lmao, that's a side point. It's about the Lakers and if they won the trade. You objectively cannot prove this, it is why nearly every single comment you've made has been downvoted. It's why I commented at all. Your argument fundamentally doesn't work because you cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that they could have had that success without any assumptions. Jimmy Butler trade hypotheticals don't work because you're assuming that the NBA landscape is the same then and the debate devolves into fanfiction."
"&gt; Maybe you should educate yourself, Butler chose to sign with Miami as a free agent, Richardson was part of a sign-and-trade, which rarely results in equal value being exchanged.   I'm aware of that, and there's no reason Butler could not have been signed-and-traded to Los Angeles instead.  &gt;Butler would not have chosen to play with LeBron, he wanted to be the guy, so the Lakers would not have gotten butler.

"&gt;We win zero rings with lebron and BI and lonzo  You don't know that at all.  Even if you were right, the Lakers could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler with a mere fraction of the assets they spent on Davis.  James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench wins easily."
"This team doesn‚Äôt have a Jimmy butler, you‚Äôre right, but they‚Äôre built much better than the 2018 team. They don‚Äôt have defensive liabilities that can be hunted, embiid, Harris and Simmons are much better than they were, and we have probably the best backup center in the league. If the sixers had dwight in 2018, we‚Äôd be taking about how they won the championship right now. The sixers were +90 when embiid was on the court that series. They were +10 with him in game 7 in 45 minutes of play time.  Also, Tatum is a way harder matchup for thybulle because of the size, he‚Äôs always struggled more with taller players, which is why Kemba has a very tough time against him"
"Sure, I‚Äôm all for criticism, but it must be *valid*  When it comes to 3 pointers and my boy Jimmy Butler? Dude can‚Äôt throw a ball in the ocean. That‚Äôs a valid criticism.   But to say Klay *only* has 3 pointers and that his defense will be hobbled? That‚Äôs not valid at all. Dude was on all nba defense just 3 years ago. He‚Äôs been rehabbing for two years while also not accumulating wear and tear by playing 82 games the past two seasons. It‚Äôs like riding a bike, especially when you‚Äôre a player of his caliber.   The guy‚Äôs criticism valid and there is no sugarcoating here. I‚Äôm just being a realist."
"&gt;I stopped reading...  This is probably why you are clueless on the subject.  James/Ball/Ingram/Kuzma/Zubac with Hart, Caldwell-Pope, Caruso, Green, Howard, McGee, Rondo, Hunter, and Wagner is by-far the deepest team last year, and would've had a very good chance to win.  Not only that, they could've traded for, say, Jimmy Butler instead of Davis.  Butler was traded for peanuts, in comparison, and James/Ball/Butler/Ingram/Zubac and that bench wins easily.  And the Lakers still could've signed Davis in December, and would still have their future draft capital."
Jimmy Butler Jr
Jimmy Butler?
"Honestly I think this is where culture really becomes important for a team. They're all very talented dudes that's obvious. Very skilled. Know how to play defense and can at a high level. But the culture in LAC is one of entitlement, rather than accountability. Kawhi and PG are talked about as the leaders of that team but neither guy is vocal or a true culture setting guy like LeBron or CP3 or Jokic (seriously if you have any question about this - look at how MPJ and Aaron Gordon and Austin Rivers and Jamal Murray, all dudes who have some kind of ego, have locked into and spoken in volumes about the Nuggets culture). Kyle Lowry is another of those guys for instance, Jimmy Butler as well.   Hell, Kawhi literally LEFT a great basketball culture in SAS under shady circumstances and still does get a bunch of preferential treatment from the Clips, I'd wager, even though they say he doesnt.   Point being, even though they're talented they have tons of breakdowns and they like to talk a lot without having accomplished... really anything, together. Individually they can all make great defensive plays, but sometimes they fall asleep or arent locked in on what the rotations or proper help are, etc etc. I really think it's mostly culture though because you can see it when things go poorly. They get frustrated, they press offensively, and more often than not that means Kawhi or PG isos, meanwhile the defense continues to slip. Last night was weird because it meant Rondo got hot and Boogie came in smoking hot and kept them in the game when Kawhi and PG were both mostly uh... pretty not good.   As far as top guys going off like, Luka and Jokic are incredible. Just for Jokic, the only two guys who defended Jokic well this year in large sample sizes are Ayton and Myles Turner. Jokic still got his, but they made it tough on him. Robin Lopez also lowkey had good games against Jokic. But again, Jokic still ate. The Clips with just Zubac, who is solid? They have no chance against Jokic. Havent for the last 2 years."
"Yeah that is likely going to be the playoffs again. Refs swallowing their whistles is something we have to overcome, I just hope they swallow them for both sides. That Jimmy Butler call at the end of the game from last year will never not make me mad."
Lol obviously not talking about this year I‚Äôm talking about previous years they‚Äôve just never been matched up mainly because KD plays SF and AD PF/C they never really matched up 1v1 since AD played the role of a rim protector until recently where he‚Äôs guarding anyone really. From Jokic in the western conference finals to Jimmy Butler. So if both were healthy 100% AD would matchup with KD especially since KD is playing the role of a PF.
Jimmy Butler
"The Bulls would have been far better off doing literally nothing in the past 5 years.   Honestly, their roster could have been Jimmy, Rose and Taj Gibson off the bench, and whatever draft picks they would have fallen into. That‚Äôs basically the ‚Äò21 Knicks vet roster + Jimmy Butler + whatever picks developed. That team cracks the playoffs in the East easily with Thibs as the coach."
"You‚Äôre mixing up 2018 they lost to the Celtics and beat the heat. The Celtics that year were horford and a bunch of young guys, that wasn‚Äôt an amazing team and Embiid didn‚Äôt play well in that series.   2019 was a dog fight but you also had Jimmy Butler. He was by far the best player that series. Losing him makes you guys a lot worse. Simmons and Embiids both played terrible that series again."
Jimmy Butler
All time Jimmy Butler. FJB.  Current probably Culver for how trash he is
Yeah. At least Jimmy Butler can be fun from time to time. He has a much better sense of humor.
You obviously don't watch games lol I don't understand why you continue to argue. Garlands potential is through the roof and he's definitely not the worst player in the NBA. Hes arguably the most talented player on the Cavs roster and the Cavs aren't even the worst in the league any more.  I bet you think Okoro is a bust too. Did you think Kawhi was a bust? Jimmy Butler? Iggy? They all averaged close to what Okoro is averaging his rookie season and those are his comparisons. He's shown plenty of potential on defense. One good example is how he locked down Harden during those couple of Nets games.
"Y‚Äôall got blown up by Jimmy Butler lmao  KD, Kyrie and Harden will feast"
Donovan Mitchell/Jimmy Butler/and Jeff Teague would make a stacked college team
"You really shouldn‚Äôt put your own thoughts into Kawhi‚Äôs head. You have no idea what Kawhi is thinking.   Plenty of people think something will be great from the outside looking in and then don‚Äôt enjoy it once they have it. He could love being by his family, or he could view moving closer to family as a big mistake. We don‚Äôt know.   Most likely he signs with the Clippers for a 5-year max, but bouncing for Miami to play with Jimmy Butler, who he‚Äôs long respected, or to go to New York to be the man in Madison Square Garden aren‚Äôt super outlandish."
The Jimmy Butler special
jimmy butler paid these refs with his coffee money
"For sure. Basketball reference has an adjusted shooting section that attempts to do that. I just did the math myself and depending on if you use raw numbers or percentages, Kobe's TS% of .548 in 1997-98 is equivalent to about .596-.598 this season, which is slightly above Luka, CP3, Jamal Murray, and right around Jaylen Brown, Bradley Beal, and Jimmy Butler."
"I actually just checked, and league average TS% was even lower than that in 1997-98 (Kobe's second season): .524. Kobe had .548 TS% on 30.4 points per 100 possessions, which is roughly equivalent to .597 true shooting today. That means that that sophomore season of Kobe's was the same relative efficiency and ever so slightly lower volume than Jimmy Butler this season (31.7 points per 100 at .598 TS%). Pretty impressive."
&gt;	He either needs to apply actual pressure with an ultimatum or he‚Äôll have to sit there and watch his prime pass him by with no results.  Or he could just embrace the grind rather than taking the easy way out. (Or whatever nonsense players like him and Jimmy Butler have been feeding small market fans for years).
"I rank jimmy butler higher than Westbrook, yes."
Is that all we base players on now? You must rate Jimmy Butler pretty highly then?
PG: Jalen Brunson  SG: Jaylen Brown  SF: Jimmy Butler  PF: Jordan Bell  C: Uhh... Jaron Blossomgame
I think it will be interesting if CP3 opts out. He had NY as one of his trade destinations from OKC and he has ties to Leon Rose.  The following year Id watch Lavine or how things playout with Jimmy Butler in Miami.
what are you talking about. There a bunch of solid FA options. We dont need to address a star this year as long as we build upon our success and guys like RJ and Randle improve stars will come to us   **2021 Free Agency**  * Kyle Lowry  * Mike Conley * CP3 (PO) * Kawhi Leonard(PO)   **2022 Free Agency**  * Zach Lavine * James Harden (PO) * Jimmy Butler (PO) * Bradley Beal(PO)
I mean it‚Äôs beyond annoying seeing Sixers fans point to a team carried by playoff Jimmy Butler to imply that the 2nd and 5th options on that team are good playoff performers lol
"The Nuggets have been between 16th and 10th in DRTG the past 3 seasons (12th this year) which is fine. And they‚Äôve been fine in the playoffs- you can‚Äôt really look at overall playoff team stats in a vacuum like that because there is a ton of noise, and teams only play against a few different teams- I mean Simmons has only played against 4 teams in the playoffs, that‚Äôs not gonna tell you a lot of you‚Äôre just looking at the raw team numbers.    Let‚Äôs look at how the Sixers have faired in the playoffs with this pairing:  2018: slapped around in the second round, gentleman‚Äôs sweep  2019: carried offensively by Jimmy Butler (no longer on team), Embiid was absolute dog water on offense vs Toronto, and Simmons had the lowest USG% of the starting lineup, with Butler averaging more assists AND fewer turnovers than him. Sixers lose in the 2nd round again.  2020: Non-competitive sweep, Ben doesn‚Äôt play, Joel is mediocre at best despite averaging 30ppg.    That‚Äôs not a lot to show.... and again, he was the 5th option in 2019, and you no longer have Jimmy. If you want to win a title with those guys as your two stars he needs to be able to do more than hide as a 5th option, we‚Äôll see if it works this year. But his non-spacing ability is almost certainly part of why Embiid has been so awful on offense in the playoffs thus far.   The nuggets held the Clippers to less than 100ppg average over the last 4 games of that series last season, arguably as good a team as the Sixers have ever faced in the playoffs. And the Sixers play in a far less competitive conference."
Jimmy-Lamar-Danuel Butler-Jackson-House
Wolves fans should be thanking Jimmy Butler for saving them from being in this post rn lol
"Definitely think he's more likely than not to make it onto 3rd team, but it's going to be partially dependent on how certain players are categorized. I think he'll definitely be behind Giannis and Kawhi, since they're forwards without any question. After those, you've got a number of players that could realistically be classified either way like Jimmy Butler and Paul George, depending on how voting pans out. There's also the slim possibility some really fucky position labelling where guys like Luka and Bradley Beal get considered as forwards so that people can fit more guards in.   He 100% should make one, but you can never say lock when it comes to the lower end all-NBA players."
Marcus smart deserves a mention if jimmy butler gets 1
They‚Äôre a Jimmy Butler type player away from winning it all imo.
"Jimmy Butler was the best player on the Sixers in 2019. Reddick was also still really good. Embiid and Simmons were both absolutely terrible offensively in the Raptors series, particularly Embiid. 17.6/8.7/3 with 28 turnovers and PUTRID 37/34/84 shooting splits is about as bad as you can play as a superstar on that end of the ball- I know his +/- was good but that‚Äôs a bad indicator in a single series (for comparison, the Sixers were +6 with him off the court vs the Celtics last year and got swept). Neither of them have been better than Jokic in the playoffs, even suggesting that is absurd with how awful both of them have performed, and how dominant Jokic has been. Simmons has the same issues as Giannis in the playoffs because of the decline in full court offense, but nobody talks about it because the Sixers never have had the expectations to win that the Bucks have. That will be different this year."
"Defensive advanced stats aren't great as everyone here has already mentioned, but I think there are much better options than RPM.  Just out of curiosity, here are the 20 players with the highest **538 Defensive RAPTOR rating** (min. 1,000 minutes):  1. Rudy Gobert (**massive** lead for 1st) 2. Clint Capela 3. Matisse Thybulle 4.

They took A game off the 2018 Rockets led by Jimmy Butler
Wiggins with the addition of Jimmy Butler. I think trading for Butler and then essentially becoming the 3rd option took a hit to his confidence.
"They were down KD it was pretty sad to watch. CP3 was getting abused on pick and roll. The whole Rocket team deserved to get dunked on Capela was useless again, Harden bricked free throws in game 6.  Can't always cry super team. Paul was trying to create a super team with Jimmy Butler that very off season. These are big boys they know the drill.  I wouldn't dunk on Dirk because he played extremely well up until that point then. I would for CP3 that playoff because he basically only showed up for one game."
You think Jimmy Butler is the WORST player you could add to make them a contender? Guess y‚Äôall are further away than I thought.
"Curry, i just think he deserves one. (2015 the strongest case)  Then maybe Jimmy Butler"
"Lmao every time Greg Munroe is in the game, it's a Toronto fastbreak highlight reel. Then in the 2nd half, Brett Brown is like ""fuck this"" and starts experimenting with Boban, Jonah Bolden, and Amir Johnson, none of which really works either.                 One day I'll go back and re-watch this entire series, but not today. I will say, it's insane how LOUD the Toronto building gets, I miss NBA playoff basketball with fans. And I'll give it to that Sixers squad for holding it together when the momentum shifted hard many times. In this particular game, Jimmy Butler had like 5 or 6 huge buckets to silence the crowd when the Raptors were putting together a run."

Lets say Jimmy butler doesnt win a championship this decade but Middleton does. Would middleton be on your list over JB? JB 21/7/7 Middleton 20/6/5
How is he underrated? Hes more talked about than Jimmy butler
I just shocked Jimmy Butler has friends. Like any friends.
I mean either way it was and is pretty clear lowry wants to play with jimmy butler he‚Äôll end up in Miami some how some way and not Philly
"Everyone grew up learning to be a Jimmy Butler type player. No one wants to stand in the corner waiting for their shot and just play defense all day.  In the league, there are more good versatile players than there are true 3&amp;D players only  because the player has to be near elite at either 3 or D to be given enough time to develop the other aspect."
"This is a weird question. Obviously it's earlier to be a standard 3 and D player than Jimmy Butler. But why use Klay as the standard? Like 99% of the population could shoot 10,000 jump shots a day and they still won't be as good a shooter as Klay is"
"Of course, but in relation to my first comment, I was pointing out the things that Jimmy does that most don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why I mentioned that PG is a different player. He‚Äôs excellent defensively, he‚Äôs an elite shooter and he‚Äôs a very complete player on both ends of the floor, but Jimmy Butler is different."
"Jimmy Butler.   People are underestimating how difficult it is to be at the level of shooting Klay was(is).  Klay has never had a season below 40% from 3 while consistently being around top of the 3 point makes leaderboard, while giving All-D level defence.   We have really haven‚Äôt seen people that are that consistently good at shooting, while also being a consistently good defender.   We have seen players like Jimmy before where they are big athletic forwards who use their size to get to the rim. Jimmy is an amazing player, but I think Klay is a lot rarer than people realize."
"It's not that simple. The Sixers were not a respected franchise outside message boards. Players didn't want to go there. Porzingis and Russell refused to work out for them. I have a hard time believing Jimmy Butler ends up there if the team was being run by Hinkie.   You need good draft picks to build a team (either through those players or through trades). But you're increasing your reliance on luck by doing what Hinkie did while also making the franchise look like some Mickey Mouse operation. Had Embiid not been hurt before the draft, this team drafts Jabari Parker and they are sitting at the bottom of the standings today. You need to have a plan if your picks don't work out. Hinkie's plan was keep losing until one turns into a superstar. That's a bad way to run a team."
"if season ended today i would have bron first team over kawaii but lets say he comes back with 5 games left. that means he will only have played 46 games and kawaii will have played ~56. so you gotta give that edge to kawaii  Jimmy Butler has much better advanced stats than Tatum or Randle, but will have only played in about 55 games. Zion also has better advanced stats than both of them but his team is in the 11 spot.  It's kind of a tough call for those forward spots   curry and luka i have to say are the only 2 deserving of first team (both playing ~65 games) because kyrie will have played ~56 games and harden maybe will only have played 42 games. so actually i dont think harden should even get 2nd team if he only plays 42/72 games. Dame was in the running for first team but now has slipped significantly behind the top 2.  So I would have kyrie move up to 2nd team, and probably drop harden to 3rd."
Yeah that‚Äôs definitely what I‚Äôm saying lmao  Of course we are better with KD than without him. It doesn‚Äôt mean he was NEEDED in any year prior to this. We would have won the same with a Paul George or Jimmy Butler in his place and they are far worse players
"Current players: boogie, rondo, draymond, Marcus smart, and jimmy butler."
This is true but you will get flamed from the dudes who will just say verbatim ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a 7 footer who can get a bucket anywhere‚Äù without referencing what he has actually achieved.  He has yet to win on a non-stupid superteam.  Honestly dudes like Jimmy Butler have far more impressive playoff resumes without having rings
Such a beast. Towns does this with one of the worst teams in the league and jimmy butler keeps single handedly losing games with a team that went to the finals  Can‚Äôt wait to beat the piss out of the heat again on the 7th
You said durability is a factor. Are LeBron and Jimmy Butler not considered durable players now because they got injured in this season where damn there every star has gotten injured?   Isn‚Äôt LeBron still referred to as the best player in the world? I‚Äôm saying your point about durability in this context and conversation doesn‚Äôt mean much
"Steven Adams, Russle Westbrook,Ben Simmons,Jimmy Butler, and deandre Jordan"
Bruh Murray played in the bubble through the WCF and didn‚Äôt even have much time to rest Lebron and Jimmy butler even got injured come on man
"KAT outside of one season with Jimmy Butler (where they made the playoffs) has never been ‚Äúpaired with all stars.‚Äù  Ever since they‚Äôve had DLo, one of them has always been injured. Not to mention, their coaching situation has been garbage for his entire career. Replace KAT with Shai on the TWolves and they‚Äôre a 10 win team."
I feel like Jimmy Butler doesn't get hate tho
"[Kevin O‚ÄôConnor of The Ringer reported Sunday that the Miami Heat are ‚Äúpursuing a deal for Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry harder than anyone.‚Äù He added that if Lowry gets dealt, his preferred destination would be to Miami due to his friendship with Jimmy Butler.](https://www.hothothoops.com/2021/3/21/22343686/miamj-heat-kyle-lowry-trade-duncan-robinson-tyler-herro-kelly-olynyk-lamarcus-aldridge)  [Lowry's top destination if he is traded is reportedly Miami, Tim Reynolds of the Associated Press reported Tuesday.](https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-kyle-lowry-prefers-miami-heat-as-trade-destination)  cry more ü§°  he gone (just like every star in Raptor history) + Masai is washed"
"I‚Äôm starting to feel this way about my Bulls. Zach is the only player since Jimmy Butler that has developed at all. Our players are always wildly inconsistent. This is why we fucked up firing Thibs. For his faults, he is a great development coach. Whether it was Rose, Jimmy, Noah, Deng, etc., he always got guys to play to their max potential. He had even DJ Augustine looking like a budget Chris Paul way back when. Now we see what he can do with NY and part of me is just sad we didn‚Äôt make Thibs our Popovich."
"Gobert, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler"
"Jimmy is a legitimate culture changer and game changer, especially defensively. Beal is nothing defensively. Beal is not as good as Butler. People shouldn't just disregard defense because the lack of numbers attached to defense."
Way harder to emulate his style when his style doesn‚Äôt really have a category to put in.  Too many intangibles he has mixed with parts of different play styles he utilizes. And that‚Äôs not even factoring in the defensive side of the ball.    That‚Äôs why a Jimmy Butler gets mad respect.    He isn‚Äôt the absolute best at any one thing but is very good at just about everything in the game of basketball.         Plus heart you can‚Äôt teach or emulate.   You either got it or you don‚Äôt
The Heat would be just as bad as us if they played in Green Bay. Jimmy Butler is the reason they're a playoff team

"3P% is so integral to a player's reputation compared to the past.  Westbrook shoots around 30% from the 3, but in the 80s and 90s some of the best guards - Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Clyde Drexler - all shot around 30%. For his first 4 years Michael Jordan actual shot *sub .200* from the 3.  Back then guys like Westbrook or Jimmy Butler would have been normal shooters. Now that people realize how effective the 3 is, and especially with the high volume 3s since Steph came along, they are considered two of the worst outside shooters in the league."
"Jimmy Butler, Paul George"
I think Sixers too. Harden loves Morey. And Heat. He likes Jimmy Butler/is friends with him.  Nets was top choice though. Harden actually did seem less of an AD/Lakers situation where he wanted out but was willing to compromise where to some degree.

Jimmy ‚Äústupidly locked in‚Äú Butler
"Nobody is going to argue that Butler had a great series here.   In fact, he came up short.   As the franchise player, he simply didn't get it done.   But that said, what I love about this stat line, and what I love about Jimmy's game, is that even when he isn't scoring well, he still puts his all into every other part of the game.   There are a lot of guys who, when they aren't shooting well, let it take them out of their entire game.   But that's not the case with Jimmy.  The big problem with his game is that he's just not a dominant offensive player.   For some reason, his 3pt shooting has just gone down the toilet since he got to Miami.  He's the kind of talent who would tear it up with a couple of great scorers on his team (like Curry and Klay).  He'd be a perfect fit in any number of 'big 3s,' but he just can't carry that offensive load as the first option in a context where the team lives and dies by his offensive output.   But kudos to him for still busting his ass off elsewhere on the court despite his struggles."
Jimmy ‚ÄúSuperstar‚Äù Butler
"The early morning thing is really funny though. It‚Äôs not even a protestant work ethic thing to be up before 6am, it‚Äôs just bragging about where your circadian cycle is at.   Like if Jimmy Butler practices more than any other player, brag about that, or maybe even don‚Äôt because development isn‚Äôt just about sinking as much time as you can? You get diminishing returns for long workouts, and sleep is absolutely necessary to develop muscle. It‚Äôs complicated!"
"The right move is to trade Jimmy Butler to the Warriors for Wiggins, Wiseman, Minnesota pick, Warriors pick, and then shake them down for a future Warriors pick too.  The Heat have to ask themselves, can they build a better team than the Bucks or Nets in the next 2 years? If the answer is no, then move Jimmy, because once Jimmy starts getting to around 35-years old, he will start declining.   Something being overlooked is Jimmy is going to be a free agent next year. If he has another All NBA season you can expect him to opt out and secure one last big max deal. If his teammates are still poor next year outside of Bam, he might just leave Miami and they get nothing back.   Miami doesn‚Äôt have great options to improve the roster.  Because Bam took the extension instead of waiting, they only have around $25 million in cap space, well short of Kawhi‚Äôs max which will start at $39.2 million. This creates an awkward situation when it comes to acquiring him. Moving on from him, there other move is bringing in Kyle Lowry, at 35-years old, who could fall off a cliff any year, or being in someone like Lonzo or Markannen, and hope they don‚Äôt just steal your money.  They only can trade their 2028 draft pick and Tyler Herro has lost most of his trade value. There just aren‚Äôt good opportunities to upgrade the roster significantly to get on the Bucks / Nets levels, so they should move on from Jimmy‚Äôs timeline and move to Bam‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs unfortunate because Jimmy fits well with the franchise, but it‚Äôs the right move. The Heat should celebrate the two years and retire his Jersey for the contribution to the franchise, but it‚Äôs in both parties best interests for a breakup.  As for Jimmy, the Heat wouldn‚Äôt be doing him wrong. I‚Äôm sure he will be happy to get to compete for a championship with Curry and get to play with his friends from the 2016 Olympic team."
Rondo pointed out the same thing for game 6 to pick up jimmy butler full because the past 5 games they were letting him bring the ball up with no pressure. Lebron obviously is the mismatch hunter and he would always put steph in a pnr to make his offensive game less effective

Jimmy Butler calls everyone soft..  *But what if he's actually the one who's soft??*
Damian ‚ÄúJimmy Butler‚Äù Lillard
Did you really just compare Jimmy ‚Äúsofter than butter‚Äù Butler to Kobe Bryant?
tfw the timberwolves and jimmy butler have the same amount of rings
Jimmy Butler calls everyone soft..  *But what if he's actually the one who's soft??*
"*Finally, the last minute of the game*, thought Jimmy Butler as he received a quick inbound from his trusty big, Bam Adebayo. *This is where I excel.*      Jimmy dribbled down the court and glanced around at the mass of Heat fans cheering his name. He smirked and reached towards a small sack tied around his waist by a simple string. He dug his hand into the plump pouch and grab a hand full of its contents.      *South Beach sand.* He takes it everywhere he goes. Jimmy, while dribbling, brought the sand to his nose and wafed the smell. Ah yes! That smell! He could sense the gulf shore breeze in each granule. It was the perfect smell to remind him of his destiny, to be one with Heat culture. He dreamt of this moment.       He ritualistically blew the sand out of his palm and all over the NBA court; the crowd went **wild**. Jimmy then began squaring up his defender, Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. Giannis was a large man, that was certainly the case, but Giannis lacked one critical factor.      *Tyler Herro.* Jimmy quickened his moves. Right, left, right, left. Giannis had no chance. Butler approached the 3-point line and whipped the ball over to Herro, ready at the corner for the 3.       Routine catch-and-shoot from one of the bubble‚Äôs biggest breakout stars, Herro collected the pass with style and immediately jumped for the release. He flicked his iced wrist; tiny South Beach sand grains sprinkled out from underneath his fingernails.      *An S-tier release*, noticed Jimmy Butler. He gazed as the ball achieved a beautiful arc over the Bucks‚Äô defense. Jimmy turned and began his shift to defense. *Herro had too much drip to miss--*      Clank!      Jimmy spun around to see that the ball had smacked the front of the rim and was hurtling toward him. He nabbed the ball, eyeing the shot clock. 14 seconds. They were down by 1. He squared up Giannis again. The sand he had previously blown onto the court was now crunching underneath his shoes. *Down to the wire*.   Sure, It was surprising to see that Herro had missed, but it didn‚Äôt matter anyway. The Heat just needed to bring Jimmy to the playoffs. They needn‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôll handle the rest.      He darted towards the basket, worming his way around Giannis. Bucks‚Äô center Brook Lopez slid into the lane. Jimmy juked outside, spun, and jumped. A mid-range attempt.      *I‚Äôm stupidly locked in.*      \[Game Ended. Milwaukee Bucks Defeat Miami Heat 4-0 in series sweep\]"
What a winner jimmy butler is
Would the Nuggets trade MPJ for Jimmy Butler?
"The overreaction on this sub during the playoffs is insane lol. Jimmy Butler just arguably had his best year of his career this season, no it doesn‚Äôt make sense to trade him for Andrew Wiggins."
"I think you meant to ask ""could/should Jimmy Butler entertain getting himself traded?"""
Jimmy Butler really scored fewer points than Bryn Forbes
Damn Jimmy butler was locked in.
"Except nobody said that? The only thing that Heat fans said was that Jimmy Butler and Bam wouldn't keep shooting 20% from the field.  Jimmy Bulter finishes this series averaging 14.5 PPG on 29% shooting from the field, that's why Miami got swept. Still, Milwaukee looks like the best team so far out of the Big 3 in the East, so i expect Nets-Bucks to go seven games."
Heat are in a weird place as they have some good young pieces but they also have Jimmy butler who obviously wants to contend now as he doesn‚Äôt have very many good years left.   Lowry clearly wasn‚Äôt the missing piece but idk how they‚Äôre going to keep Jimmy happy after a 1st round sweep.
"I can give you KP and Brunson for one Jimmy Butler, but let's be real, Heat are not trading him."
"Yea my bad, I‚Äôm sure bam ‚Äúcan‚Äôt create his own shot‚Äù Adebayo and Tyler ‚Äúhood tendencies‚Äù herro will develop into stars/superstars before Jimmy ‚Äústupidly locked in‚Äù butler and goron ‚Äúdirty pos‚Äù dragic are too old..."
"Yeah, well maybe we should have kept him then instead of making this place a boys club.      The team just got sold and if we don't start winning the team is going to get moved after a while.     Team wins, team stays. Team sucks and continues to suck, team leaves. But it'll be okay because the nasty man Jimmy Butler is gone I guess."
"‚ÄúWe get there, us as a team, I'll handle the rest.‚Äù   \-Jimmy Butler when they go to Cancun"
The Timberwolves haven't made the playoffs without Jimmy Butler in 17 years.
"The Heat have been mediocre since Lebron other than one fluke run because the East was a mess. Bam is like the 5th best center in the league. Harden is a top 5 player in the league. The chances that Bam becomes a number one option on a championship team are slim at best. Jimmy Butler is on the wrong side of 30. Harden and Jimmy are a championship caliber 1 and 2 and a draw for other players. You give Pat Riley something to pitch and you‚Äôre going to have an interesting next couple of years. As is, you might be looking at a tear down unless you get lucky."

Jimmy Butler gonna clap some ass in Cancun
Jimmy Butler has a superstar level impact on his teams. Just look at what happens when he doesn‚Äôt play well. Last year he played well and they made it to the Finals(yes the team in general played well).   Did you guys really forget what he did last year already?
so is jimmy ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù butler
"Jrue is great, but he is not better than Jimmy Butler. People compare the performance of the main guy on the team, who was the major focus of the Bucks defense, to Jrue who the focus after Giannis and Khris.   Jimmy shit the bed, and a lot had to do with that Bucks defense of throwing a bunch of really good defenders at him and some exceptional team/help defense....but he is still a great player and 1 series should not take away from his other highlights throughout his career."
Jimmy Butler and being traded for Wolves picks
The difference here is that Kyrie was actively sabotaging the Celtics at the time. Jimmy Butler was actually trying to win this series. lol
Jimmy Butler is a glorified Marcus Smart
In what world is Jimmy Butler top 10 cause it isn‚Äôt this one üåç
Jimmy Butler has shown he is capable of playing at that level for short sample sizes. That is all you need in a playoff series.
Did anyone actually think Jimmy Butler was a super star?  He's always seemed like a star at best to me. He's not as talented as the real superstars in this leauge but he plays harder or as hard as anyone.
"Jimmy Butler is a star, not a superstar."
Jimmy Butler was not a superstar outside of this four game sample size either lol what
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt won a playoff series in 18 years but Jimmy Butler hasn‚Äôt put up a 40 point triple double in the Finals in 7 months so who‚Äôs the real loser here?‚Äù - Every Twolves fan today.
what's the over under on Jimmy Butler pulling an AB this off-season and calling the Don a cracker
Jimmy Butler is a Superstar. Why don't people understand that a 4 game sample size means very little in the long run?
Jokic looking like Jimmy Butler out there.
Because Jimmy Butler had two all time finals performances. Nothing against Jimmy but that is hard to replicate.
"[After the T-Wolves' first-round loss to the Houston Rockets. Rather than fly with the team back to Minnesota, he instead went to Los Angeles.

"Jimmy Butler is a real unpolished offensive player compared to most stars. He has a solid handle and good court vision, but his scoring game is all tough layups and throwing his body into people hunting for fouls. I don't get how people complain about Harden and Young but give him a pass, at least they can hit shots."
Jimmy Butler was right about one thing this series. He was stupidly locked-in
"Yes, because a team with Lebron &gt;&gt; a team with Jimmy Butler"
"Jimmy ""Bubble God"" Butler the top 10 player couldn't even score more than what, a 5th option? lmaooooo"
"I already know I'm gonna get downvoted, but I don't wanna hear Jimmy Butler talk trash in a media conference ever again."
"""Giannis calls Jimmy Butler edible"""
Bulls beat Celtics 2-0 while taking home court then proceeded to lose 4-0 where jimmy butler averaged mediocre stats.
Jimmy ‚ÄúThird Stringer‚Äù Butler
That wasn‚Äôt Jimmy that was James Butler.
"Everyone should give the Bucks credit for improving and changing the gameplan instead of this narrative of ""bubble flukes."" Jrue Holiday over Bledsoe is a world of difference and Giannis and Lopez have been much more dominant in the paint. Jimmy Butler got straight up exposed though I can't front."
"Jimmy ""I'll handle the rest"" Butler"
Is Paul George better than Jimmy Butler? /s
Jimmy Butler or Tyler Herro? Whose the bigger bubble fraud?
"clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game      ball is inbounded to Butler who turns face to face against Giannis   ""You took my family""      moves to the left      ""You took my friends""      moves to the right      ""You took all that was dear to me""      clock winds down to 2      ""I cant get them back, but I can do this for CULTURE, FOR HEAT CULTURE""      goes up, fire coming out of his shoes      ""I AM STUPIDLY LOCKED IN X4""      Ball flies over Giannis's head, over Khris' outstretched hand, goes straight into the Jrue's hand for an airball.

"The Heat went into halftime of a close out game up 7 points.   In the second half, Jimmy Butler scored 2 points while watching his team get outscored by 24. That‚Äôs just the cherry on top of this shit sunday."
The wolves would be better than the Heat if they had Jimmy butler
"Jimmy Butler said ‚ÄúWe get there, us as a team, I‚Äôll handle the rest‚Äù then proceeded to shoot 4/22, 4/10, 7/17, and 4-14 while getting swept. If this was a PG quote it would be a top 10 most upvoted post in the sub or something like that."
I'm stupid~~idly locked in.~~  \-Jimmy Butler
Jimmy Butler is stupidly locked out rn
Bucks icon Jimmy Butler.
Y‚Äôall said Jimmy butler was better than Pg cause of his 1 bubble performance. I didn‚Äôt forget
"That ""LeBron went to Los Angeles to be a movie star and Jimmy Butler went to Miami to be a sex addict"" thread title still makes me laugh."
Jimmy butler going from 24 percent to 35 percent from 3 in the bubble back down to 26 percent the next year. Bubble boys.
"Jimmy ""locked in"" Butler"
"Jimmy Butler Cancun WR speedrun,30% FG% hack!"
"‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm stupidly locked in‚Äù - Jimmy Butler   I love Jimmy. Thought he and the Heat would put up a fight. It is what it is, but I for one am glad to see the Bucks showing us what we thought they would in years prior.  Reaaaaaally looking forward to this Bucks and Nets matchup."
I legitimately don't know which was higher:  The number of shots Jimmy Butler made or the number of dirty plays Dragic made.
No he didn't.  Tobias had a 59 percent true shooting on a 23 usg.  Jimmy Butler had a .607 TS on 26 usg.  So just checking the stats Butler is better in his role as the number 1 than Tobias is at his as the number 2.  Tobias is a much better perimeter shooter but that's about it.

Or making the defensive change to have Giannis guard Jimmy Butler much more in this series compared to last year.
Jimmy butler took 64 shots in this series. He made 19

"Nobody here will argue PG is not better literally in the minute Butler's team gets swept.  Also nobody here will argue that Butler is not better on any other day when PG has a bad game. That's just how it goes in these areas. At the moment Jimmy Butler is the worst, always has been and will be."
"Jimmy ""Andrew Wiggins"" Butler"
Jimmy butler took 64 shots in this series. He made 19
Jimmy ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù Butler shot under 30% from the field in his playoff run and averaged under 15 points.
Jimmy Butler or Julius Randle  Who has been more disappointing?
"Jimmy ""I'm stupidly locked in"" Butler ended with 19/64 fg"
"well who is? jimmy butler is top 5 (he ain't 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th) and kawhi doesn't even scratch the top 10"
Not as good as jimmy butler tho
"I mean it just seems pointless, and it's purely speculative. .  19 year old Amare was way better than 19 year old Hakeem.  19 year old KG was better than 19 year old Duncan. Look at guys like Kyle Lowry and Jimmy Butler who didn't even become all-NBA players until their late 20's."
throw in like Simons and picks for Jimmy Butler. idk maybe do the Myles Turner trade everyone said Boston was gonna do.
"Because I actually watch games and it's clear to anyone how strong Lakers were no matter who they were playing against. It took 6 games because the Lakers played with their food and Jimmy Butler went nuts.  No the Lakers weren't staring at 0-2, AD had a bad game and the team didn't bring it. Once AD got comfortable and had consecutive 30+ games it was clear the Lakers took over and Suns had no answer, they would still make it close but Lakers were clearly better."
I didn't know his sister is Jimmy Butler.
I would love a Jimmy butler for CJ McCollum trade
"‚Äújimmy butler top 5, kawhi not top 10, lebron about to run through the west‚Äù  I‚Äôve never seen you say something that turned out to be true lol"
I‚Äôll go watch the tape. And ask jimmy butler ü§£
**Kobe vs Wade** - Kobe  **Duncan vs  Garnett** - Tim Duncan  **Dirk vs  Robinson** - Dirk Nowitizi  Some of my own:   **James Harden vs Kevin Durant**  **Donovan Mitchell vs Devin Booker vs Bradley Beal**  **Rudy Gobert vs KAT**  **Jimmy Butler vs Kyrie Irving**
"I get it. People get mad at guys like me for not seeing all the regular season games from every team. I'm a Warriors fan. I watch the Warriors games and the playoffs. The best players are the ones that show up big in the playoffs. Like Booker just did. Players like Bradley Beal are nice. Giving you 30 PPG but he's going home. The top players in the NBA play their best against the best. Booker has just taken that leap. Just like Jamal Murray did in the bubble. Or even Jimmy Butler. Before last year, Jimmy Butler was just another Paul George type player. Great but not when it matters."
&gt;Man is every bit as good as jimmy butler or Paul George imo  Offensively
Channeling his inner Jimmy Butler I see
"I don't know man, that's such a bad take.   Which superstar do you think that could magically move teams and automatically be assumed to be a **real contender** year after year after year?  You're best bet is KD but we'll see. Think about that, Kawhi switched and choked last year. He built the team he wanted on a blank canvas and he might drop to Mavs this year. CP3 from New Orleans to Clippers then Houston same story couldn't get it done.   He made the finals because he's fucking LeBron. How many more stars or superstars have joined over the last years with disappointing results?   D'Lo/KAT I thought would be guaranteed playoffs at least, health asides that doesn't look guaranteed. Porzingis from NY to Dallas was looking straight fire but he's regressed. OKC Russell, PG, Melo was getting spicy. We can go back and say Jimmy Butler 2019 on 76ers would be considered a superteam... LeBron in any of these situations would somehow land him in the Finals.  You can say LeBron's lucky he was healthy for the majority of his career but when you spend 1.5M+ year after year on your body it sets a gold standard for everyone."
Man is every bit as good as jimmy butler or Paul George imo. He just not flashy and not a big talker and plays for a small market. Celtics fans would agree with me.
The MVP for the Bucks was Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy is a way better fit than CJ what are you talking about.  He can guard 1-3 best player instead of Dame or someone. Dame stretches the floor and can play off ball if need too. Butler lives in the paint and at the foul line.  Bam and Jimmy games overlap way too much imo. Dame and Jimmy dont. Jimmy ball handling will be a great 2nd option for the blazers and needed to run the offense when Dame can actually get some rest now. all his best skills arguably get amplified playing beside a 35ft floor stretching shooter like Dame. His passing, getting to the line and paint all should go up."
Here‚Äôs a secret  It‚Äôs a tad bit easier to defend just Jimmy Butler rather than Kyrie KD and Harden all at the same time
"It's a funny thing, too, with fans...you see it in every sport.  You draft a kid who isn't a finished product and will take time to provide ROI, and when he shows up and isn't a finished product, everybody loses their minds and says he sucks, and calls him a mistake and clowns the team that picked him. Either that, or they ignore situation entirely.   Like *of course* rookie Josh Allen struggled. He had a roster full of garbage and wasn't ready yet. *Of course* Baker had some trouble until the coaching situation was actually stable.  I don't know whether Lamar will suddenly look like a much better passer now that he actually has some NFL-quality receivers, but it shouldn't shock anyone if that happens. I don't know if Carson Wentz will have a ""miraculous"" bounceback with a healthy, stable team instead of that shitshow that was the 2020 Eagles, but it shouldn't shock anybody.   Just like nobody should have been surprised that Al Horford, when not forced to play on a team that made zero sense together, looked a lot better. Just like nobody should have been shocked when the Lakers *still* couldn't space the floor in the playoffs. Just like nobody should have been shocked when that 2016 Bulls team had problems with spacing (Backcourt: Jimmy Butler, D-Wade, MCW, and Rondo.) Just like nobody should have been surprised when the Wolves and Hawks suddenly looked a lot more competent when their good players got healthy and they hired better coaches."
"Trade CJ + whatever is reasonable for Jimmy Butler (assuming Miami is not willing to give him the full max extension he is seeking), re-sign Norm to start at the 2, add a defensive minded backup center like Nerlens Noel, and fill out the roster with whatever 3&amp;D wings they can get. Baby you got a stew going."
Kat was a rookie that average 18 11 and 2 blocks that year. Russ was the 2nd best player on a team that made the western conference finals and had gone up 3-1 on the warriors. Jimmy Butler had made his 2nd all star game and was seen as the air to derrick roses legacy in Chicago at thay point. The warriors tried to trade for love but said no because they valued Thompson more (Jerry West nixed the deal) Draymond was never on the table. Hayward was better than Love that year he played in Utah so he didn't get credit. Lowry was meme on r/nba but was the same player he is today.  It's not revisionist history once again play on the court matters.
"Even at that Kyrie was a top 20 player Love wasn't.  KAT, Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, Russ, Paul George, Kawhi, Dame, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, John Wall, Kyrie, Derozan, Lowry, Hayward, Cousins (pre injury still), at absolute minimum where better than Love with more players being arguable. Y'all literally call anything a superteam."
New coach and CJ + two first round picks for Jimmy Butler. Portland's saved.
"I don't think they did.  I mean, when guys like Paul George and Jimmy Butler went West I didn't here anyone dismiss them as being from the ""weak"" Eastern Conference.  Not to mention no one writes off guys like Bradley Beal or Trae Young as only playing in the ""weak"" Eastern Conference, not to mention Jason Taytum and the Celtics.    Really it only sounds like the East was considered weak because Lebron kept winning there."
"No its fine, all we need to do is get rid of CJ, get a 6'5""+ wing who can score and play defense like Jimmy Butler, get Zach Collins back fully healthy with no ill effects from his injuries, have Simmons make a leap as the back up PG, get a defensive PF to replace Melo off the bench, find a decent two-way center to back-up Nurkic who can also spread the floor for the bench unit, and get a defensive minded, big name coach to replace Stotts. And then gel in a couple of off-season months and run it back next year. I don't know why everyone is making this so complicated."
"They only had the balls to press Lebron because they knew they had rim protection help. Same with Kawhi in the Spurs series, same with Jimmy Butler in the Chicago series same with Paul George in the Indiana series and Celtics in the 08 series."
"LeBron, Tatum, Dame, Jimmy Butler, and either Luka or PG and Kawhi will all have first round exits too. So what‚Äôs your point?"
"A number of reasons.  First off, culture and leadership in the locker room are a thing. Which is not to say dame is lacking in those areas - he‚Äôs a fantastic leader. But trading away Jamal to get a guy that we just beat in the playoffs (regardless of his heroics) is a bad look for your locker room. Jamal is one of the heartbeats of this team. Wouldn‚Äôt happen.  Scheme wise, Jokic can make anyone work. So I‚Äôm not saying dame is a bad fit. Dame would be a great fit because of his spacing. But Jokic and Murray have an insane connection as well, and Murray is still ascending. There‚Äôs no compelling basketball reason to trade him either.  So if there‚Äôs no compelling basketball reason to trade him AND it‚Äôs a bad move for the culture/locker room chemistry that we have built AND we would have to attach assets like future picks‚Ä¶why the hell would we do it?  This isn‚Äôt 2K where you just trade for whatever stars you want. And we aren‚Äôt a big market coastal team where you just go grocery shopping for whatever all-nba players you want every offseason. We are a small market team that relies on our strong culture building, player scouting/drafting, and player development. Our whole motto during this ascent was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt skip steps.‚Äù Skipping steps is like the wolves trying to jumpstart their success by trading for Jimmy butler (or I guess the sixers too, but they recovered well enough afterwards). Even if we fall short this year, making a blockbuster trade for dame abs giving up on Jamal before we even got to see this core-4 play together for more than 10 games would be a massive failure and the definition of skipping steps.  Before Murray got hurt we looked like legitimate finals contenders. Having Gordon along with our big 3 unlocked so much. Now, missing Murray and Barton changes so much of what we do, including Gordon‚Äôs offensive role. The spacing and pressure those guys provided opens up so much in terms of cutting and rim pressure from Gordon and mpj. We owe it to ourselves to see if that core can get it done like we think it can. No way we blow it up because Jamal tore his ACL."
Jimmy Butler syndrome.
Or rather he's shown that he shouldn't as a second option to a similar but better guard. As a second option to Jimmy Butler or DeRosen or any other playmaking SF/PF in need of spacing and perimeter targets CJ would look very desirable.
"AD, a first round pick, and kuzma to  Miami for Jimmy butler and Herro"
"Hahaha jimmy butler, show me kyrie harden lillard, show me the ones because surely he would guard them if he could, they are the teams stars not switching."
Well I have a game of AD shutting down a red hot Jimmy Butler in the Finals.  That‚Äôs a bit better than getting demolished by Jokic in January.
Kuzma is locked in for a few years I think.   We would have done better resigning Rondo over Shroder. Also Pope turned into a bubble fugazi worse than Jimmy Butler.
Heat. Tired Jimmy Butler was the highlight moment of the 2020 NBA Finals; for him to go from carrying the weight of the team on his shoulders last year to being swept is heartbreaking.
"Gassed? Gassed is Jimmy Butler in the finals last year; man left his soul on the court and was at point of collapse. This is just pathetic. LeBron had ample time to get up there, gassed or not. Sub yourself out, if anything."
"There needs to be a conversation about resting after this season is over. I think teams should go as far as not allowing their superstars to go play in the olympics. Shouldn't have let players go to the all star break. Its no surprise that the two teams that played the longest are so dramatically worse this year. Tons of superstars are hurt and nether the Lakers or the Miami heat look ANYTHING like they did last year. As much as people whine about resting their players, lets see the same energy when they are \*\*supposed to rest\*\*. The turnaround was way too quick and there will be more injuries of superstars by the end of the playoffs. The Miami heat looked horrible and tired and jimmy butler wasa shell.

Yes exactly. Finally someone gets it. Russ needs to shoot the ball &lt;10 times per game. Like you say I don't think his ego allows for that which is why he will never win a chip and why anyone who is serious about winning one needs to stay away from him.  Simmons should be traded if the 76ers don't make the finals and Jimmy Butler won't ever win one either. All three of these players are too poor at shooting to succeed in the playoffs in the current NBA imo.
"I‚Äôm feeling some Miami last year vibes with this Suns team, might be CP3‚Äôs Jimmy Butler moment"
People roasting booker for talking trash saying its easy to do so when winning seem to also be the same people that will roast  a guy like jimmy butler for talking trash before getting absolutely embarrassed   Always weird to me
"CJ for Jimmy Butler straight up, who says no?"
Blazers would probably love to overpay Jimmy Butler in a sign and trade for CJ+Simons+RoCo+picks. Just one idea.
Odds for Rich Paul's first call after this game:   Damian Lillard - $1.01  Kawhi Leonard - $1.45  Chris Paul - $1.88  Jimmy Butler - $2.22
Tbf Lebron won against Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro in the bubble and MJ won against Stockton and Malone
"Miami has a strict conditioning program that other teams do not have, which is why Jimmy Butler liked the Heat because Pat Riley knows basketball too well. If you don't past the program, I think you can't participate in training camp or you get cut.  Here's a link if you'd like to learn more. There's a before and after picture posted by Dion Waiters too, which really shows how intense Miami's program is.

They‚Äôre gonna try and get jimmy butler aren‚Äôt they...
"Jimmy can opt out after next year and is looking for a big extension, but CJ is under contract for another 3 years, instead of just one. If Miami starts rebuilding around Bam and doesn't want to max Butler for another 4 years, they might consider trading him."
CJ and all the picks it takes for Jimmy Butler would be amazing.  As far as guys we could get for him straight up? Nobody good since his contract is terrible.
Yeah for every Jimmy Butler there's a Nerlens. Everyone talks about betting on yourself like it's a sure fire move. Sometimes your confidence is misplaced.
"jimmy butler or ben simmons would be ideal. i'd offer up CJ/Nassir Little/Ant/FRP's to make it happen (not all of those, but some combo of them)."
"CJ + Picks + assets (Nassir Little maybe) for Jimmy Butler, Heat might think the Butler + Bam combo hit its ceiling last year and want to retool around Adebayo for the future"
"sounds easy right, trading cj isn‚Äôt going to happen because you need somebody good enough to replace what he already giving dame. what is miami gonna swap two way star jimmy butler for cj for some picks ain‚Äôt gone be shit if dame and butler on the same squad"
Fire Stotts AND trade CJ for someone that actually compliments Dame's strengths and hides his weaknesses (Jimmy Butler?)
Jimmy Butler and Herro for CJ and Simons?
"I liked that idea that Blazers fan brought up a couple days ago when they said McCollum, another player and some picks for Jimmy Butler. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possibly though"
trade Cj and whoever you need for Jimmy Butler
"Why the fuck would we send Jimmy Butler, a better player than CJ, for CJ... AND include picks outgoing from us? Wtf?"
"I don't want Dame to leave the Blazers but my god they're letting him down by not capitalizing on series performances like this. Fire Stotts, trade CJ for a big (if they add picks, Jimmy Butler would be a perfect fit with Dame, idk if the Heat would go for that though), get some actual defenders at the guard position instead of Dame being backed up by even worse defenders."
"I don't want Dame to leave the Blazers but my god they're letting him down by not capitalizing on series performances like this.

Congrats to the Nuggets, scary to think what this team would be capable above with Jamal Murray healthy. Hope they can keep going regardless!"

What a stupid fuckibg thing to say. Saying Jimmy butler looks like Jamie Foxx isn't racist its a fact. Get fucked with your horse shit. You're a bitch with a pussy ass flair and ur mvp is a pussy who constantly complains about getting fouled. Sorry fanboy but you a puss puss
Jimmy Butler is not their best player.
So Jimmy Butler? I bet he would‚Äôve liked another quality teammate
"It allows teams to add players they don't have cap room to sign as free agents. Like how Jimmy Butler ended up in Miami: he wanted to go there but Miami was over the cap, so what Butler did is get the Sixers to re-sign him using his Bird rights and then trade him to Miami in exchange for some pieces the Heat had. This way Philly didn't just lose Butler for nothing and Butler was able to go to the team he wanted.   With Schroder it's possible he'll want to sign with a team that doesn't have cap space, so to make it happen he could be signed and traded, with the Lakers getting something back."
CP3 does for teams what Jimmy Butler fucking dreamed he could do
"1. Sorry I didn't mean high volume currently, I meant he would need to in our system around Ben and Jo 2. He was during the playoffs for sure, but this season he was the lead man on the Heat and got absolutely crushed. My issue is that creators like that can be streaky and that's fine, but if we're running an offense through Joel Embiid, you need to be able to score outside of the paint at a high clip more consistently than not, because otherwise we lose all momentum. If you took Jimmy + Seth and an elite 4 who can shoot at 42%, I'd like Butler. But that's the issue, you need a 4 who can shoot lights out or you're donezo.  Replacing Green with Butler straight up, IMO, increases our ceiling but lowers our floor, Green's threes this season have been back-breakers for opposing teams making a comeback."
Jimmy Butler
"Yes, with Jimmy Butler shooting 50% from 3 for a couple series and Herro averaging 19 in the ECF, I believe so."
At times yes but even last playoff run he guarded Jimmy butler a lot 1 game he for sure normally doesn‚Äôt guard other teams best players until the 4th in most games
"I think people say that because in 2019 your best player in the playoffs was Jimmy Butler, so the current core really hasn‚Äôt done anything. And even though that team had some major structural issues last year, most contending teams can at least avoid a sweep even if they lose their #2 or more, see: Denver this year."
"1. Jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt shoot a high volume of 3‚Äôs 2. Jimmy butler was arguably the best player on the team in the one playoffs he was in philly 3. You‚Äôre just going to compare Danny green to butler over a 4/5 sample, rather than looks at years of data we have of the players?  Although butler doesn‚Äôt necessarily fit well with this team, his overall talent level overrides any fit problems. Replacing Green with butler would make the sixers odds close to the nets, IMO"
"Damn the Jimmy Buckets bandwagon fell off hard. There‚Äôs still no way i‚Äôm cutting him when he‚Äôs achieved more playoff success than both of the other two have, not to mention the fact that every CF team from last year has struggled mightily bc of the short offseason.  As of rn i‚Äôd Start Tatum, Bench Butler, Cut PG"
"It's almost like superstars enjoy playing with him and the media-driven (by LeBron sycophants and salty Boston sports loyalists) narrative about him being a bad teammate is absolute bullshit. Kawhi asked him to come to LA. Jimmy Butler wants to play with him. LeBron crawled back to his racist owner to leech off of 22 year-old Kyrie's talents for a many titles as he could get, and the moment he feared Kyrie wasn't goof enough (against a fucking ""JUGGERNAUT in Golden State""), he tried to have him traded for bum ass Bledsor and PG13."
"1 might be underselling that team a bit.  D Rose was killing teams single-handedly, the bulls heat game that year was a great barometer. Even with LeBron and Wade on the court, Rose was the most unstoppable person on the floor.   Buuut....  That team was stacked beyond belief as well. Prime Noah, boozer was playing very well, but they also had korver, Deng, Jimmy Butler, Rip Hamilton... If Rose didn't get injured and they were able to keep that core together..."
"Tatum, Paul George, Jimmy butler"
"We don't really have any other lead guard playmakers on this team (besides Tyrese Maxey who is a rookie and still pretty rough around the edges). Seth curry, Tobias, Shake, korkmaz are all secondary playmaker types. I mean, we had Danny Green bringing the ball up the floor at one point this season with Ben and a handful of other players in the COVID protocol. George Hill should help with that but he is not the player he used to be. In a way we still have a Markelle Fultz / Jimmy Butler sized hole in our roster from a perimeter offensive initiator perspective"
"5 games is 5 games.  Jimmy butler wasn't better than Giannis just because he busted the Bucks up last year, right? My argument is that this is a homer ass opinion dripping in recency bias and small sample size.  Call me crazy but I would think using a small sample would be  faulty logic. But hey thats just me ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
jimmy butler is better than kawhi
Deservingly so. But he was a different beast before the injury.  Him and young Jimmy Butler would have done serious damage.
The fact that jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt have a three point shot severely compromises his ability to go for a drive. Jimmy is being a tad bit overrated.
"He‚Äôs hit a game winner on philly before when they had Ben Simmons guarding him(I think, it might‚Äôve been over Jimmy butler I can‚Äôt remember)"
Porzingis + THJ for Jimmy Butler (Sign &amp; Trade)
I don‚Äôt know how to add a picture here but google Marcus smart and jimmy butler. They got into each other‚Äôs faces a few years ago and there is definitely not 4‚Äù apart. Marcus‚Äôs nose is at Jimmy‚Äôs top lip.
"They don‚Äôt have any options. This is their core, money cannot really be used elsewhere   I much rather be in the Sun‚Äôs shoes With a young core locked in and having an old Cp3, and prove to already be a good team than someone like Miami  Who‚Äôs gonna be paying Jimmy Butler big money, for probably first round exists"
"Every facet of the game? Butler shot 25% from three this year.  I won‚Äôt argue that Tobi is a better player than Butler, but it can be argued that he‚Äôs better for the Sixers. The Sixers biggest need is spacing, Embiid and Ben are interior scorers, and that‚Äôs pretty much what Jimmy has become at this point in his career.  It just would not be viable to put three guys who want to get almost all their shots in the paint on one team."
"No, jimmy would make this sixers team much better than harris could. Butler is better than Harris in every facet of the game. It aint like Jimmys teammate did not disappoint against bucks. We talking about a top 15 player in the league vs a borderline all star at best. This is a delusional take"
"Okay so the heat would have to trade at least Jimmy butler, a young player and picks for Harden who is 9 years older then the rest of their young core, and who also plays the same positions as multiple other of their top players. Yeah harden is great but gutting your future for a very very slim chance is stupid beyond belief."
"Just for my own pleasure:  Harris: 25ppg, 50/38/90  Butler: 14.5ppg, 30/27/72  As much as I know Jimmy had the worst series of his life against a tougher opponent, it's abundantly clear that Harris fits the Sixers better than Butler. Maybe they made the right call there"
It‚Äôs literally a comment about Jimmy Butler you made on this exact same post.
Jimmy Butler asked for trades. Nobody on the team asked for him to be traded. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
In this same thread you talk shit on Jimmy Butler calling him toxic what‚Äôre you on right now?
Get jimmy butler to truly get the band back together.
Jimmy butler.    He's as toxic as a player could be
"Yeah, it must be that he‚Äôs foreign. Not that Kyrie and Westbrook are notorious assholes to journalists or anything. If only he got constantly blasted like those American media villains Dame Lillard and Jimmy Butler."
"Just came off a trash series, but it's normally a bad move to double jimmy butler"
Randle was much worse. But Jimmy disappointed me more...because he‚Äôs Jimmy Butler. He‚Äôs supposed to go off but he didn‚Äôt
"You can do this with every team though.  Blazers:  2004: Telfair 2 picks before Al Jefferson.  Kevin Martin was also a late first rounder.  2005: Traded 3rd pick for 6th and 27th.  Got Webster, didn't get Deron Williams or Chris Paul.  2006:  Okay we fucking nailed this one and got Roy and LMA.  2007:  I don't think I need to explain this one.  I'm sure having Roy/Durant/LMA at the 2,3, and 4 woulda never worked though.  2008:  Brandon Rush 2 spots before Robin Lopez.  Lopez not a world beater, but he's been a fuckload better than Rush.  2009:  Claver 1 pick before Casspi.  Casspi wasn't great, but at least he was an NBA player.  Claver was not.  (Gibson went 4 picks later.)  2010:  Williams was trash, but so was every player after him so this year fine.  (Except I guess Lance, but he went like 15 picks later.)  2011:  Nolan Smith lol.  Next 3 picks were Faried, Mirotic, and Reggie Jackson.  Jimmy Butler was 9 picks later, but we still had healthy Roy so I can see why we passed on him.  2012:  Meyers Leonard.  Again a shit class.  Draymond Green got drafted, but he went 35 so literally everyone fucked that up.  2013:  CJ at 10.  Did that one right kinda.  Giannis did go 15th, but again a lot of teams fucked that up.  2014:  No picks.  Can't miss if you don't have a pick.  2015:  RHJ.  Another shit class by that point.  2016:  No picks again lulz.  2017:  This is the best one.  We had 3 first rounders and traded 2 to move up to #10 and select Zach Collins.  Mitchell went 13.  Bam went 14.  Oops.  Also took Swanigan at 26 while Kuzma went 27.  I know Kuzma gets a lot of hate here, but he's a legit NBA player, unlike Swanigan who is already out of the league.  2018+  Tough to tell with guys that young.  Simons/Little/Stewart haven't done much, but neither have a lot of other later picks this early in their career."
Imagine if this were Jimmy Butler
"Jimmy Butler is way too hated. Instead of being celebrated for his great playoff run last year, he gets hated on for not being able to do it again when being guarded by elite defenders with a group of role players that have sucked all year.  Since he's been in the league, Duncan, LeBron, Curry, Kawhi, and Durant are the only other 5 players to be the best player on a finals team. What he pulled off last year isn't common.  Everyone complains about the super teams winning every year, but then when a second tier star and a team that plays good team ball puts together a good playoff run, they get relentlessly hated on."
Yea man. But hey. Jimmy Butler and KD were his top choices I think
"I feel like players like Jimmy (and Gobert, since you listed him) are hard for box score watchers to fully appreciate, since a lot of what makes them special isn‚Äôt their scoring. Most people didn‚Äôt watch a lot of the Heat (or the Jazz) in the regular season, so they see what Butler did in the playoffs and want to label him a bubble fraud like he wasn‚Äôt exceptional all year. Elite defenders‚Äô value is rarely shown in the box score."
Dame is incredible but not necessarily a good fit next to Mitchell. Their game is redundant. If we were going to upgrade from Bogey it would have to be an elite 3&amp;d wing like Jimmy Butler
"Obviously I‚Äôm biased, but Jimmy Butler is actually a really underrated answer to this question. Granted, a big chunk of it is from Bulls, Philly, or T-Wolves fans, but I don‚Äôt get why everybody outside of those three fan bases would dislike him so strongly. Well, maybe Bucks and Celtics fans."
"LeBron is hated, Gobert is hated, it seems like Jimmy Butler is hated by quite a few people too"
Is Jimmy butler a superstar to you?
**Who Should Make it**  LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Stephen Curry   James Harden   Russell Westbrook   Dwight Howard   Chris Paul  Carmelo Anthony   Anthony Davis   Kawhi Leonard   Damian Lillard   Nikola Jokic  Giannis Antetokounmpo   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   **Who‚Äôs *actually* going to make it**  In addition to the names above:   Paul George   Kyrie Irving  Klay Thompson   Kevin Love  Rajon Rondo  Andre Iguodala  Blake Griffin   Draymond Green  Jimmy Butler   Kyle Lowry   Rudy Gobert   Marc Gasol  LaMarcus Aldridge   Al Horford   John Wall  Derrick Rose   Kemba Walker  Joel Embiid
"Not a current roster, but what the 76ers did a couple years back trading for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris would fit the bill."
OK so you guys are saying Kyrie is one of the best 15 players in the league.  So which of these is he better than:  Durant   Harden   Giannis  Kawhi  Embiid  Mitchell  Doncic   Jokic  Lebron  Dame  Anthony Davis  Curry  Jimmy Butler  Westbrook  Beal
In the first quarter the Nets shot like Jimmy Butler. That wasn‚Äôt gonna be happening again.
"plenty of players can drag g-leaguers to the playoffs. a very select few (bron, jimmy butler last year, both magic finals teams) can drag them to the finals. no one can win a title by themselves. even dirk had key role players like shawn marion and jason terry pulling their weight"
Bro Jayson Tatum and Jimmy Butler round out the top 15. Mitchell isn‚Äôt better than those two
"Giannis has played:  Jimmy Butler/DRose Bulls  Lowry/DeRozan Raptors  Pre-Kyrie Celtics  Blake Griffin Pistons (swept)  Kyrie Celtics (beat in 5)  Kawhi Raptors (lost in 6)  Bubble Magic (beat in 5)  Bubble Heat (lost in 5)  This year Heat (swept)  Superteam Nets (undecided)  Mitchell has played:   PG/Westbrook Thunder (Beat in 6)  Harden/Chris Paul Rockets (twice)  Bubble Nuggets   This year Grizzlies (won in 5)  This year Clippers (who knows)   I don't think the opponents the Jazz have faced are vastly better than the Bucks. None of the teams the Jazz played went to the Finals, the best team they played was the CP3/Harden Rockets and Kawhi's Raptors were 100% better than those Rockets"
You can say the same thing about last year. Got essentially swept by Jimmy Butler and friends
We out here doing seances for Jimmy Butler or Ben Simmons.
"&gt; Had one all star on their team who was also the lone all-NBA player that season.  I can see this happening now for the same reason it happened in 2004 - a team starting very slow record-wise and getting no All-Star love.  We saw Trae Young, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo miss the all-star game this season because of their team's record in the first half of the season, and that trio plus another borderline all-star (the Pistons had 4) would definitely contend."
They had so many good young pieces there was a time they coulda flipped some for Jimmy Butler and instead they signed milsap
Take Jimmy Butler out and put the Glove in there. That would be a ridiculous defensive squad.
"Why is Jimmy Butler on here? Most overrated defender in the league, dude doesn't deserve to be on here with a bunch of DPOY level defenders."
"The people left open would be Ben Simmons, Butler of Jimmy, and Iggy lmao"
"Current: Donovan Mitchell, Jimmy Butler All time: Kobe"
"Caldwell-Pope is 2 names away from Jimmy Butler and 3 from Clint Capela, so maybe intended to click one of those two?"
"Well deserved by Gobert. I just wish in such a superstar guard heavy league, they‚Äôd give more credit to the defensive guards instead of whoever is leading in blocks. Jimmy Butler led the league in steals but only got 2 third place votes. Jrue Holiday and Thybulle been great defensive guards but only got 6 and 1 third place votes respectively. Most team‚Äôs best or second best player is a guard. Not saying give them the award but they deserve better than a few pity third place votes."
Probably an unpopular opinion but Jimmy Butler
jae crowder &gt; jimmy butler
"That trade basically had nothing to do with Meyers.  Miami didn't want him, they wanted the cap flexibility to sign Jimmy Butler.  Getting rid of Whiteside allowed them to do that."
He had no business winning it. Derrick rose deserved it and last year Jimmy butler should have won
"How is anything I said wrong? Harden completely bottled the spurs series but still averaged 24 points on 56 ts percentage for the series.   By no means am I saying that I don‚Äôt think he choked that series, but you said harden has choked more games than any star or something. That‚Äôs just not true. He generally plays exceptionally well in the playoffs but has a small list of very memorable games in which he completely shit the bed.   He‚Äôs never even come close to having as bad of a complete series as jimmy butler just had. The day harden gets swept by a team that he can definitely beat and he drops the worst stats on the planet and puts up absolutely zero fight game in and game out, then maybe you‚Äôll be right. But for now, we shouldn‚Äôt pretend that harden is as big of a choker as jimmy air balls   Btw, I like jimmy, I‚Äôm just fucking around lol"
"This looks like a good place to repeat my somewhat-popular trade idea  Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 2 Blazers 1sts  * 2 Heat 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline. BI is the greatest asset in the trade so the Heat pay the most. They can build around a BI/Bam duo for the next decade.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as four first round picks to help with their rebuild. That leaves them with 8 picks they can trade if needed! Can upgrade PG and/or SF  -- maybe they package picks with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams. Or maybe offer the Cavs Bledsoe and 4 1sts for Colin Sexton. Etc."
I will rank him as high as people ranked Jimmy Butler last year and when he crashes he will suddenly be ranked as a career choker like Paul George
"Jimmy butler played like shit in the game 7 of the raptors series though. He scored 16 points on 48% ts with 1 assist. I don‚Äôt care who you blame for the series, the fact is they got it to 7 games and in that 7th game, Jimmy butler played poorly. He also played poorly in the game 6 of the lakers series last year. And he had an all around bad series against the wizards.   I don‚Äôt care what butler averaged for the raptors series as a whole. He played bad in a game 7. Harden had good numbers in the clippers series but played poorly in game 6 so he choked that series according to you. Butler has choked 4 times at least.   Lakers, wizards, raptors, bucks. Wow what a list. Now let‚Äôs ignore all the good series he‚Äôs had and just run with that narrative. That‚Äôs what any good 12 year old basketball analyst would do"
"Yeah it's like the Paul George / Jimmy Butler debate. We had this exact post 7 months ago with ""the Butler/PG debate is officially over"" and guess what, it's flipped again"
"50 passes per game list looks like pretty good company. ""PTs created"", pushes Ben up the rankings. What makes you think assist to pass percentage a good metric? 3 of the top 4 players by that metric are score first guards that dump the ball off when double teamed. James Harden gets ranked 10th by that sorting. It seems more indicative of play style than ""goodness"".    Trae Young  Russell Westbrook  Damian Lillard  Luka Doncic  Chris Paul  Mike Conley  Ja Morant  James Harden  Jrue Holiday  Ben Simmons  LeBron James  Marcus Smart  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Derrick Rose  Tobias Harris  Nikola Jokic  Dennis Schroder  Royce O'Neale"
He's such a weird player.  He's definitely better than Middleton but he's also definitely not in that elite tier.  He's more talented than say Jimmy Butler but he isn't more impactful. I honestly don't know what to think about PG anymore other than to get off jokes half the time
"I‚Äôm not saying he played a good series, but there‚Äôs a difference between choking and having a bad game or even a bad series. For example, Jimmy butler did not just choke this past series. He just had the worst series of all time. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a choke though.   Btw, if I really go through jimmy butlers career and quote to you all the stats from the games he played bad in, then it would look terrible. But that‚Äôs not a rational way to analyze a player. Harden has a lot of really strong playoff moments as well. Same with jimmy butler  The way you know not to engage with somebody in a conversation about a player is when they only define that player by their failures and completely ignore their successes. You aren‚Äôt smart. You‚Äôre not doing good analysis. You‚Äôre a 12 year old twitter troll with shitty takes"
Caron Butler or Jimmy Butler?
Covington wasn‚Äôt even on the team when the Sixers player the Raptors. He was traded for Jimmy Butler.   What a casual.
"Embiid couldn't beat Kawhi in the 2nd round with Jimmy Butler, Tobias, Covington, Reddick, and Simmons  Tatum took LeBron to 7 games in his rookie year with Hayward and Kyrie Irving out for the series. and he beat the sixers 4-1 his rookie year and swept Embiid last year.  Cope how you want but Tatum is clearly better."
He saw Jimmy Butler and said hold my beer
"Paul George/Jimmy Butler/Eddie Jones vs Magic/Curry/Nash/Harden ""shouldn't really be a debate""  Paul George/Jimmy Butler/Eddie Jones vs Bill Russell ""shouldn't really be a debate""  Lol, it's 2021 and people still compare players using such a shallow argument.  Then again, you also ""personally"" think Embiid is better on offense, so it's evident you're clueless about the sport."
"I feel like that‚Äôs more luck, it‚Äôs the desperation of the clippers to lure kawhi with a star combined with jimmy butler saying no to going to the clippers"

Jimmy butler played like crap and so did herro but u right either way
"Ben is a great player, but they had an incredibly easy schedule to finish that season iirc   The only playoff bound teams they faced were the Wolves, Cavs and the Bucks   The Wolves were missing Jimmy Butler from his injury, and the Bucks were tanking to face the Celtics without Kyrie those playoffs  Most of the teams they faced during that win streak barely cracked 25 wins that season"
I would take Luke Kennard over jimmy butler
Jimmy butler need that round the clock fraud protection this year
Every tall lanky shooter gets the KD comp.  It's as lazy as saying any 6'6-6'8 wing is athletic but can't shoot is basically Jimmy Butler or Kawhi Leonard.
"Miami just went to the finals with 2/3 stars being a non-shooter. The key is to make up for it at every other position. The problem with that is role players are inconsistent which can lead to situations like this year‚Äôs Miami team just gets shutdown because the role players can‚Äôt hit and the lanes get clogged for the star. Granted Jimmy shot well from three in the first two rounds last year.  Giannis and Russ have the right idea that they need to take threes. Some favorable variance, like Butler had last year, can at least let you win playoff series if the guy gets lucky. Simmons is the worst because he just refuses to participate in what is a necessary part of winning basketball."
"Jimmy Butler was 30th pick, 1st round of the draft"
"City of Chicago wasn't informed.  I think the fan vote happened within Thibs' office. That would explain why Jimmy Butler got a 2nd place vote, Taj Gibson got a 3rd place vote, Luol Deng got a 4th place vote, and Carlos Boozer got a 5th place vote."
"He never shows up **when we need him**. The Denver series is literally the only time in his entire career he's been there in a remotely close series  &gt; Plenty of metrics paints him as a big-time offensive contributor on the level of Jimmy Butler and Paul George. That's how efficient his scoring is  He's literally league average TS% lmao. His efficiency is as average as they come. Because he wastes a billion possessions a game with bad midrange 2s, doesn't get to the line, and cant finish at the rim  You're ignoring the biggest problem: he's one of the worst defenders in the league and is extremely selfish. Unlike those other guys, when CJ is cold, he's legitimately one of the worst players in the league. He becomes worse than useless. You'd rather not have him on the floor if he isn't make shots.  &gt; But you're not just replacing his production with Norm Powell. It's not that easy.  Sure it is dude. Hell we can replace him with way worse than that. He missed a 10 game stretch two years ago. We had the #1 offense in the league without him  He missed a 30 game stretch this year. We had the **second ranked offense of all time** without him. Clearly we can replace him. quite easily actually.  CJ and 3 firsts for Butler. Let's get it done."
"well you said he never shows up and then just named two series where he was fantastic - not every player is just gonna perform to the level of their contract in every playoffs. Ask Khris Middleton. Ask Paul George. Ask Jimmy Butler. Those guys have all looked unplayable at times, sometimes multiple times in the playoffs. And the regular season is actually a real thing that matters. CJ was great this year and has been great for a number of years as a scoring guard. He shot 9 threes a game and made 40%. Ya know how many guys can do that? Plenty of metrics paints him as a big-time offensive contributor on the level of Jimmy Butler and Paul George. That's how efficient his scoring is. Obviously, he's a much worse player in other aspects of the game, that's why he's not a star. But you're not just replacing his production with Norm Powell. It's not that easy."
You mean to tell me Minnesota hates Lebron more than Jimmy Butler...?
"My biggest problem with this proposal is that Jimmy is nearly 32 and Portland giving up 3 firsts for him is setting us up for a pretty bleak future.  Harden went to the Nets for 3 firsts but Butler is not Harden and we have no mechanism to acquire additional talent.  On top of that letting Simons go would give us zero backup guards, we could pick up some players on minimums but that isn't exactly depth.  I'm fine with letting Little go."
One Jimmy Butler Please
"Doesn't necessarily have to be this year, and you never know who could force their way off their team to join. Would you put it past Jimmy Butler to force his way to the Knicks to play under Thibs again and play with Dame?"
KAT threatened to not sign his extension if Wolves kept Jimmy Butler  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/09/17/report-karl-anthony-towns-wont-sign-contract-extension-until-timberwolves-handle-jimmy-butler-situation/
&gt; Ben Gordon  The Bulls have cornered the market in unsuccessful franchise players since the MJ era:  Elton Brand  Tyson Chandler  Eddy Curry  Derrick Rose (no fault of his own)  Jimmy Butler  Zach LaVine
Or maybe Jimmy Butler who has had average to even good 3 point shooting seasons in his career lost confidence in his shoot and became a bad 3 point shooter for the last few years. You can easily be confident in one part of your game and not have confidence in another.
"No man, I'm insinuating that Jimmy Butler, who is by all accounts one of the hardest working and most confident players in the league, can't shoot for shit. How do you explain that?   Maybe work ethic and confidence won't necessarily translate to a good outside shot?"
Luka is a career 74% three throw shooter. This year he shot barely over 50% on 51 attempts. How do you explain that? I'm not saying he lacks confidence in any other part of his game. I'm saying he lacked confidence at the line these playoffs. Do you disagree  with that?   Are you insinuating that Jimmy butler is as good as Jordan?
"Well, I don't know... maybe we can ask Jimmy Butler.  Also confidence is the last thing that Luka lacks. He's just not a great FT shooter."
Jimmy Butler is WAY more likely to move than Steph or Dame.
"Your team got exposed for the frauds they are lol, you have Kyle Kuzma of the east on your team, my team has one of the best young stars in the league and are looking to have a bright future, you about to sign Jimmy 'Stupidly locked in' Butler to a big contract and stay getting exposed lol, LeBron made your pathetic franchise relevant"
"Giannis was exceptional defensively against the Heat, he completely locked up Jimmy Butler, you can't just ignore half the game, he's playing fine against the Nets, its been only 2 games and he's had one bad game, he was great in game 1"
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.   Blazers sell the farm to contend with Dame/Norm/Jimmy/RoCo/Nurk.   Pelicans sell Ingram to get a better-shooting player who helps space the floor for Zion, as well as three first round picks to help with their rebuild -- maybe they package those with Bledsoe to actually get something valuable for that contract. Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
"Man if you seriously believe that he choked all of those series then you clearly didn't watch them. You're considering games where he shot almost 50% ""choking."" You're also looking at games where he was in the 6th man role which is completely different. Every star has their bad playoff games (look at Lebron in 2011, or Jimmy Butler this year since you're a Heat fan). I really don't have anything much else to say, try actually watching basketball instead of spewing bullshit to make it fit your hatred."
"&gt; Although I‚Äôm not convinced that snagging CJ for long term (albeit less money) is any better, financially.  Yeah I would agree - it isn't any better for them.  &gt; The reason I think the trade could work is that we can attach picks and promising young players to it. The Heat also fizzled out early, so they may want a change.  Jimmy is the perfect Miami Heat player. I don't see a world where MIA values some late 1sts (which POR 1sts will be late with Dame, Jimmy, Norm &amp; Nurkic) and Anfernee Simons (who will be a RFA next summer) or Nassir Little.   I think MIA is fine rolling the dice with their current core and internal growth of homegrown players + future free agency. I mean they signed Butler to a max contract when they had negative cap space lol"
first he needs to jimmy butler them into the olympics lol
"Yeah, his free throw shooting percentage isn't going down, it's still as high as it's ever been, it's just the number of FTs he shoots per game is going down. Initiating contact is incredibly exhausting/physically demanding and becomes harder to do as you get older unless you have super crafty old man game like Jimmy Butler."
"I don‚Äôt think you even realize how you are contradicting your self.   &gt;	LeBron was literally reaching out to his competitors who were in their primes to team up.  This is literally what KD did. And he did it with a team that won a chip and went to back to back finals and beat him after he was up 3-1 just a few months prior.   &gt;	LeBron is the equivalent of Barkley calling a prime Stockton and prime Ewing  If this is your analogy, surely KD joining the warriors is like if Jordan went and joined the pistons after they embarassed him in the playoffs.   &gt;	Good thing Kawhi rejected The Father of the Superteam Culture.  So first you say,  ‚ÄúLeBron was literally reaching out to his competitors‚Äù  And then end your post with this? Lmao Kawhi literally called up KD, Jimmy butler, Paul George etc, probably a few other players to try and team up on the clippers. You truly don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
Is Jimmy Butler then ‚Äûhomeless mans Giannis‚Äú?
"Number 1 on a championship team? yeah from the current players other than Harden who proved it by going 7 games with the Warriors. obviously Jokic, Luka, Giannis, Embiid and others can still prove it but they haven't. but it's fine, not everyone can.  If you make the finals it's enough for me usually you don't have to win. like Barkley, Malone, Iverson. I think Jimmy Butler is more proven as a 1st option on a championship team than Giannis but I know you guys disagree."
It‚Äôs also a team‚Äôs Twitter account. Every team does that shit. They‚Äôre paid to talk shit and hype their own team up lmao  People acting like Giannis took a dump on Jimmy Butler
"&gt; there's nothing he can add. asking players to add moves to their repetoire is an unrealistic ask even for superstar players. their skillset is rarely going to change too much.  I think the way Kawhi and Jimmy Butler evolved their offense shows that it's possible. Kidd improved his shot a lot too over the years. I'm sure there are many obvious examples I'm missing.  It's possible, and Giannis can do it too."
"I'm not doubting that a very small non-vocal minority in your sub just like any sub probably complained about it, but I haven't seen anyone talk about it besides non-Piston fans calling out Piston fans. It's cringe AF and annoying seeing people who clearly put in no time to actually see how a fanbase feels about it to go and assume ""Pistons fans kicking themselves right now haha"".   &amp;nbsp;  Reminds me of when people were telling us we were kicking ourselves for Noel leaving when he didn't want to be there, Fultz playing better when he needed the change of scenery, or how Jimmy Butler turned out after not wanting to stay vs keeping Tobias in 2020. It's as if we the fans didn't already know what all three of those players could do after having defended them for so long. These were all situations where most of our fanbase didn't like how things turned out, but knew it had to be done and accepted it. If anything, they should've called us out for how much we wanted to get rid of Tobias Harris in 2020."
"I mean Jimmy ""stupidly locked in"" Butler shooting sub-30% from the field probably wasn't part of the Miami Heat gameplan"
I agree. Only I said it last year when the Heat beat em and they were out coached not by Spo but by everyone and their mom who knew they were doing it wrong on both ends.   It took them a lost series and a whole year to figure out how to beat Jimmy Butler and the Heat. I don‚Äôt see them even winning a game here. Maybe they steal one but I doubt it.   This has everything to do with coaching.
"Exactly, that whole showdown was incredible, and Jimmy Butler had one of the most memorable performances in recent Finals history, including an indelible image of him exhausted, leaning over that table thing on the baseline towards the end of the game as he used up every ounce of energy in his body to will his team to victory.  You can be upset about the outcome or find the product less entertaining without fans, but to say it wasn‚Äôt memorable is just a lie."
"The Sixers franchise was a legitimate joke in the period between Hinkie and Morey  I'll give them a pass on the Fultz issue because no one could've reasonably seen that coming, other than that:  \-Gave up 2 firsts and Shamet for the ability to give Tobias Harris a contract no one would likely match anyway  \-Lost Jimmy Butler because someone in the FO wanted to 'control him'  \-Paid a role playing center 100m over 4 years to pair with two paint-dominant players  And the sixers STILL don't have a perimeter scorer/reliable 3 level scorer + secondary ball handler which is what they've needed for like 3 years"
Id argue that‚Äôs this sub with every player. Jimmy Butler was getting flamed on this sub when the heat went out. Giannis is getting sprayed currently. It‚Äôs just the nature of NBA fans to be reactionary
"After seeing Kawhi drop 34 a game against Simmons, Jimmy Butler and Tobias all taking turns, I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about his production offensively. He gets to his spots and you have to hope he misses."
Jimmy Butler to the bucks confirmed? üëÄ
Good players have back to back forgettable games all the time. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. Jimmy Butler just shot 29/27/72 for the whole series. It happens
"Trade idea:   Blazers get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * Brandon Ingram  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  Pelicans get:   * CJ McCollum  * Nas Little OR Anfernee Simons (if desired)  * 3 Blazers 1sts  Heat flip Jimmy for a young all-star SF who fits well with Bam's timeline.

Maybe Bledsoe and 3 1sts for Jerami Grant. Then you run Lonzo/CJ/Jerami/Zion/Adams"
"I‚Äôve been saying it for a while and people were downvoting me because they‚Äôre on copium.   Giannis can‚Äôt do shit to KD. Jimmy Butler ate him up last year. He‚Äôs best as a weak side, or roaming defender.   Did is an absurdly gifted player athletically and his defensive timing is absurd. He‚Äôs just not the type of guy to individually clamp someone."
How can you say luka is better in the playoffs when he has literally never won a playoff series???????????  Like sweeping the heat and holding Jimmy butler to all time bad shooting splits is just as inpressive/more impressive than losing in 7 to a possible contender
Jimmy Butler&gt;Pandemic Pingis
 Bruce Brown&gt;Bryn Forbes&gt;Jimmy Butler
Kawhi   KD  Steph  LeBron  Harden  Giannis  Jokic  Luka  Embiid   Dame  Which one of these players is Kyrie better than? Here's some more that are debatable too  AD  Jimmy Butler  Booker  Beal  CP3   LaVine  Paul George
Forbes outscored jimmy butler last series and he will outscore Middleton this series while making $2.4 million a year
They didn‚Äôt think he could shoot and his projection was a defensive minded wing with some upside on offense if he could improve. Nobody thought he would be anything close to what he was today. Even when the Spurs drafted him they said they were scared shitless about trading up since he was so raw on offense. He‚Äôs a great example of the defensive wing prospect that becomes a great all around player. Jimmy butler represents that archetype to a lesser extent too.
"I think that‚Äôs what this guy is trying to say. I‚Äôm a Bulls fan and realistically we are probably competing for the playin again, but hey I hope this guy is right. We haven‚Äôt made the playoffs since Jimmy Butler left."
"I completely agree, but I‚Äôve seen people on this sub talk about how the Bubble was so forgettable and boring, and I don‚Äôt understand that at all.   Did these people forget the insane back and forth between Murray and Mitchell in Round 1? Luka going toe-to-toe with the Clippers and making insanely clutch shots? That nutso 7-game series between Houston and OKC? The OG Anunoby buzzer beater and the rest of that 7-game series against the Celtics? The Nuggets coming back from down 3-1 AGAIN against the Clippers? The Bucks falling apart in one of the more surprising collapses in NBA Playoffs history? Bam‚Äôs game-saving block on Tatum in the ECF? Jimmy Butler playing like a superstar on the biggest stage and turning in some of the grittiest performances you‚Äôll ever see in the Finals? Anthony Davis playing maybe the best individual defense I‚Äôve ever seen throughout the Lakers‚Äô entire playoff run?  None of that was particularly memorable to these people? The players were probably more focused in the Bubble, so I agree that it led to some better basketball and more competitive series."
That‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs obviously a wing with good defense and can hold their own on offense   So Jimmy Butler?
Jimmy butler enters the ring
"fine, jimmy butler is a unicorn t-rex. go look at the top SF defenders wingspans. 6'11 is absolutely elite for a SF. you don't defend players with your forehead you dummy. you use your arms."
&gt; He's bigger than Jimmy Butler who does just fine at SF  Jimmy Butler is 4 inches taller and weighs 230.  Also not doubting you but where did you see that Powell weighs over 220? Everywhere I see he's listed at 215.
"Lol yeah, OP is out here clutching his pearls over a statistical ABOMINATION!!1!, acting as though the league has never seen the likes of it before...meanwhile NBA superstar Jimmy Butler did the same damn thing this year.    Hey OP ‚Äî stop telling on yourself! It‚Äôs ok not to know a lot about basketball, just pay attention for a while and shut the fuck up."
"They have way more potential in my opinion. Offensively the Hawks top 3 guys are probably better than the Heats best offensive guy. And Trae is so much better than Jimmy Butler already, offensively."
That‚Äôs Bull. Simmons and is to blame for his 5 years of zero progress in the NBA. He didn‚Äôt listen to his last coach and got the man fired. He got them to move on from Jimmy Butler by complaining about not getting touches. He‚Äôs the one who won‚Äôt attempt an open dunk because he‚Äôs afraid of getting fouled and having to shoot free throws.   Rivers is a coach. He‚Äôs not a wizard.
"1 actually seems more like Harden, and 2 is Jimmy Butler"
So Jimmy Butler who‚Äôs down for all that shit
I don‚Äôt disagree. Because Ben is broken.   But Jimmy left because of Brett. This is well documented. According to Woj the Sixers actually did offer the max to Butler as well.   Jimmy was the one who leaked that Brett ran video sessions and wouldn‚Äôt say anything lol
"That series doesn't go to 7 without Jimmy being the primary ball handler. Jimmy is on record saying that he has a professional relationship with Brett but that the primary reason he left was due to the reports about needing to ""control"" him. Butler chose not to resign and the sixers also chose not to resign him. It was mutual and the reason they were able to do a sign n trade."
"Jimmy Butler left because of Brett Brown, man.   And he is on record being wtf in the Toronto series when all of the sudden Brett made him point guard."
Coach has to work with what he is given. Not resigning Jimmy butler because Ben didn't like being off ball has nothing to do with the coach. Dragging Brett Brown just seems like an excuse for the massive organizational issues. Hopefully Morey finds the answers
"Also, except for drafting Embiid which was a no-brainer at 3, the Jimmy Butler trade was a better move than anything Hinkie did.  It doesn't even matter that he left, especially since they gave up dogshit for him. It was the one move that gave them an immediate shot at the title, without sacrificing any long-term potential."
"Use Jimmy Butler then? LeBron, Cp3."
"As a rookie it was just Simmons and Embiid and a bunch of spot up shooters. Since then he's played with Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler, even Josh Richardson and Seth Curry don't need to just sit on the 3 point line to score points."
Those sources? Joel and Jimmy Butler.    Lmao...
"All Jimmy Butler, maybe Bam too, then all Tyler Herro"
He actually publicly said he wanted to stay with the Bulls.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2713293-jimmy-butler-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-bulls-amid-lakers-celtics-rumors
"True, but I also think Philly being a 2 man show before Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris arrived plays a role in this."
Don't forget that new reports show that part of the reason why Butler was let go was due to Ben protesting his increased off ball role with Jimmy on the floor
"&gt;Bam Adebayo was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  &gt;Jimmy Butler was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  Both these player's get most of their points within the paint. To open up the paint for easier scoring, we need spacing. We had ZERO spacing all year and in the playoff's, the Mammoths that are the Bucks front court just packed up the paint and neutralized that aspect of our game. Hard to be a factor in the paint when one of your main shooters has gone ICE COLD because he can't create separation from other guards."
"Bam Adebayo was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  Jimmy Butler was a nonfactor in the playoffs.  The whole team completely shit the bed, probably due to the fatigue of the compressed schedule over the last year."
"Yeah my bad, i'm a self admitted Jimmy Butler stan and spent a lot of time on the heat sub and it was just easier and shorter to speak that way. Drob has regressed and Nunn has also regressed from his ROY runner up season. Everyone regressed cause no one had the opportunity to develop. Not to mention both players are also much older than Herro. I'm sure Herro will come back better"
"‚ÄúNeed a consistent #2‚Äù. Just say upgrade for a star. Because between Collins, Hunter, Bogi they are all consistent  They def should make a trade sooner than later bc they are stacked and probably past a point of diminishing returns. You have guys with crazy upside but none of them will be able to showcase bc they all play the same positions.   Hunter is the guy this sub seems to love, meanwhile I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs one of those guys who will be exactly what he is now for the next decade. That‚Äôs not a bad thing , but some will chase that Kawhi/Jimmy Butler dream of a 3&amp;D turning into a star. The odds are that‚Äôs not happening. Pro-ready, 4 year college guys rarely become stars. So I‚Äôd trade him now. Package with Reddish another ‚Äòupside‚Äô guy who you better trade sooner than later bc he‚Äôs not gonna flourish playing behind all these guys. ESPECIALLY now that Huerter has made a leap. Huerters value, both to his team and around the league, is gonna skyrocket in the ECF now that Hunter AND Bogi are hurt.  It probably won‚Äôt happen, but will the Wizards get a better package than 3 out of this 4?: Hunter/Huerter/Reddish/Okongwu for Beal?  And if you‚Äôre the Hawks:  Trae   Beal  Bogi  Collins  Capela   Bench: Gallo, Lou, 1 of the 4 above   That‚Äôs a damn mob. You can trade 3 guys and still not miss a thing and walk into next year the #2 team behind BK. If I‚Äôm ATL I‚Äôd prefer to keep Hunter to my my 3&amp;D bc they have enough offense"
Jimmy Butler is out as well
"It seems the whole Sixers organization is yes men. A lot of people say that it's the 76ers 'culture' that they aren't progressing, but culture starts at the top and works its way down to the coaches and players.  This was evident when Jimmy Butler opened up about his time in Philly. That's when I was sure there was something wrong at the top.  Such a fucking shame. He's a prime example of a talent who doesn't work hard. The other end of the spectrum is Giannis - an unknown kid from Greece who walked all the way down from the stands to shake the commissioner's hand to league MVP and DPOY. The ideal sutuation for Simmons is like the talented players who also worked hard - LeBron, Kobe, Jordan, Hakeem and so many more all-time legends, but I feel so stupid even mentioning them in the same comment as Ben Simmons."
Might as well put Jimmy butler on the trade block too cause hes not playing with Ben Simmons again
"Jimmy is one of my favorite players and I was LIVID that the Sixers botched that. You can definitely argue that had they instead traded Simmons and kept Butler, the Sixers could win it all this year.   Fuck Ben I guess."
"&gt; so even if you didn‚Äôt feel fear from them, you eeked out that series by the slimmest of margins.  Right but that's because of Jimmy Butler. And as fans, we feared Jimmy Butler in every game. Embiid and Simmons have never been scary.  That's not even talking shit. The Raptors were the same way for the longest time. Nobody was quaking in their boots about facing Lowry and DeRozan. Kawhi was our Jimmy. He was just a better version."
"Exactly what I was thinking about #13.  Simmons made the decision to pass to a teammate in a way that resulted in that player immediately scoring.  If a player is regularly recording assists on plays like that one, it actually is a pretty good indication that they have some level of court vision and decision-making that helps the team have successful possessions.    If your standard for whether an assist should be recorded is ""it doesn't count if the player who scored did all the work,"" that opens a whole conversation about which skills are considered essential to a play.  Should we not count assists when someone passes to players like Duncan Robinson, who has such a quick release that he can get a shot off even when he's fully covered?  Like what about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQYzSRgmwlo) play? Jimmy Butler literally doesn't do anything to create the play, he's just standing there watching Duncan Robinson sprint around a screen then hitting a difficult catch-and-shoot 3.  But no one questions whether *that* should be an assist, because it's clear that Butler's pass to his teammate in that moment resulted in his team scoring."
"Guy came into the heat with D-Wade, been with the overaging superstar group( shaq, antoine walker, alonzo), when D-Wade was playing at his absolute best after his injury dragging a mediocre heat team to the playoffs, than the heatles, than post heatles, and that jimmy butler era run to the finals.  Even though Haslem didn't stand out as a player and i'm not a heat fan... he's one of the players I feel some sort of attachment for growing up as a middle schooler to a 30's aged man."
LMAO Jimmy Butler and Simmons reunited
"Honourable mentions are kinda short, no Jimmy Butler? Serge Ibaka? Kevin Love?"
He took more mid range shots as he got better because he was being given the green light to do so as he improved. Same thing happened with Jimmy Butler and Jalyen Brown
"Right, but they also had Jimmy Butler, a Ben Simmons who did more offensively, and JJ Redick. They had more people who were consistently scoring, and they were both younger. Also, the raps were a couple of bounces away from getting bounced, so even if you didn‚Äôt feel fear from them, you eeked out that series by the slimmest of margins."
"You will notice that Heat fans won't slander Jimmy Butler. Dude took us to the finals, played hurt and is still recovering from COVID.   Simmons and Butler don't belong in the same sentence"
Jimmy Butler in the Bulls was already 10 times the player Ben Simmons is.
"Jimmy Butler: Several amazing playoff performances in his career, 2 straight years of basketball where he was near the top of the league in every advanced impact statistic  Ben Simmons: Regressed since his rookie year, constantly bad in the playoffs, just ruined his teams best chance at a championship in 2 decades.  Jimmy got his proper amount of hate/criticism. Ben didn't save anything"
100% agree he needs more credit. Never see his name floating up its always Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro  Even Bam needs more credit

Daily Discussion Thread : [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules#wiki_daily_discussion_thread)"
"People have to look at this situation from both sides I think, Ben Simmons, even though he has never been a shooter, has been effective on both ends of the court simply because he is a presence and he makes his teammates better. He hasn't lost his athleticism, he wasn't injured or anything, come playoff time something got to his head more so than usual. Last year in the bubble they got swept by the Celtics without Ben Simmons, they year before that they were very competitive vs the champions, Raptors. You don't regress from 14-7-6 playoff average alongside Jimmy Butler to below 10 average vs the Hawks in the span of 2 years. More than Ben Simmons, I think Doc Rivers approached this team totally wrong and made massive mistakes in team lineups and rotation. Seth Curry was guarding Huerter for almost all of game 7, who is 5 inches shorter instead of Thybulle or Korkmaz, who was a starter in the series but didn't play more than 20 minutes. They also had no solid gameplan other than giving Embiid the ball wherever he was on the floor, and expecting him to drive to the rim, leading to turnovers. He is talented, sure, but he is not Giannis. Play him closer to the post, put Curry-Korkmaz in the perimeter, with Harris as a midrange threat they would have won this series 4-2. Apparantly this was too hard for Doc Rivers to notice."
"We shouldn't be slating Philly for taking him #1, what is an issue though is they've had a first-hand look at him for years and failed to move him while he had peak value. They should have seen he's not a good fit next to Embiid, he's not really putting in the work to improve, he doesn't take coaching well, etc, and then traded him 2 years ago for a king's ransom. It should be Embiid, Jimmy Butler, and whatever you get from trading Ben in Philly currently."
Yeah. That wouldn't be a bad role for him. Not sure I LOVE the fit with the 76ers as currently constructed (assuming Ben is gone) but he fills some holes for them. Don't think it puts them over the top. Sounds like a poor man's Jimmy Butler in that instance. Could be worse off for a 3rd scorer.
"100% agree man, he‚Äôs said all the right things but actions speak louder than words and his actions tell me he has no interest in getting better.   It‚Äôs weird when you think at least some period of time he was exposed to a guy with a work ethic like Jimmy Butler and instead of thinking you know if I worked like that guy I could do anything.  Everyone is different man and it takes all kinds I guess."
"But no improvement doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre not putting in the work, if you wanna criticize an nba players work ethic you actually understand what it takes to actually make the jump and its not as simple as just working harder. We take shit like that for granted but it‚Äôs actually very difficult. For example, why is Draymond a bad shooter despite there being tons of evidence of him working on his jump shot? Did he just not put in the work? Why is Jimmy Butler a bad 3 point shooter? Did he not put in the work?   Look, Ben isnt the guy we thought he was and if he wants to truly be a star in the playoffs then the weaknesses of his game need to be addressed but to suggest the solution is as simple as ‚Äúputting in the work‚Äù for a player as talented as him is like saying Javale McGee needs to put in the work to become a knock down shooter. Its like no its obviously not that simple"
Jimmy Butler led his team to the finals yet no one is saying he's better that Joel Embiid. Jason Tatum led his team to ECF yet no one is saying he's better than Anthony Davis who has no playoff success that time.
You mean like Jimmy Butler and Al Horford?
"Do you remember game 1 when Jimmy was tasked with guarding kawhi all game? In game 1 Jimmy Butler put up 10/5/3 on 4/12 shooting. Compare that to Bens averages over the series when he guarded kawhi the other 6 games, 12/7/5 on 60% from the field. I dont expect people to know shit like this though"
"2010‚Äôs  PG - John Wall  SG - Jimmy Butler  SF - DeMar DeRozan  PF - Giannis  C - Brook Lopez  Bench: Jamal Crawford, Joe Johnson, Joakim Noah"
"As a Heat fan, I would cry watching Ben Simmons, Bam Adebayo, and Jimmy Butler sharing the floor together. That spacing would take us back to the 1940s."
&gt;Watching 5 whole basketball games? Instead of you simply explaining your opinion?  You literally told me there is no way Andrew Wiggins would outperform Jimmy Butler and somehow anything I write is supposed to inform you or change your opnion.  Go and watch the games if you don't believe me.
"I‚Äôm no Jimmy Butler fan myself.  However, he said it when he moved to Miami which was end of 2019 Playoffs right when the Sixers were at their best.  He came out of told his story because both he and JJ left that offseason and JJ wanted him on the podcast.  Jimmy wanted to stay originally but then when management basically said, ‚ÄúWe only want Jimmy to stay if we can control him‚Äù  Jimmy knew he had to go.  He made a point of saying the differences between the two organisations. He‚Äôs not the first person either to point out how the Miami Heat is well run.  Great organisation that from top to bottom has an identity and sticks to it. This coming from a fan of a division rival. Can‚Äôt stand them."
With Jimmy Butler's mentality he'd be a better Jimmy Butler.
Butler scored more than embiid and Simmons combined for several games. They were a 1 and a million shot away from going to the ecf with Jimmy but Ben's selfishness ruined their championship aspirations
Jimmy Butler was pretty horrible given the hype he got after last year's run.
"&gt;In no order. Off the top of my head. Paul george, Kawhi, Lebron, Anthony davis, Lillard, Zion, Luka, Donovan Mitchell, CP3, Devin Booker, Jokic, Embiid, KD, Harden, Giannis, Jimmy Butler, Beal, Steph Curry, Klay, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie.    &gt;The maybes... KAT, Ja Morant, Rudy Gobert, Westbrook. Probably more but i think I've made my point.  &gt; &gt;22 that are better and more then i couple that are debatable.  You are out of your mind on a lot of those.   In no particular order:   1) kyrie - this dude has done fuck all but get injured and be a cancer ever since Cleveland. This dude is whatever the opposite of a leader is. Kyrie absolutely shit the bed with a far better Celtics roster than what the hawks have.   2) Klay hasn't played in two years now. He's also not better than Trae young. Klay is a great supporting player, but he's not the type of player than can carry a team like Trae young has.   3) Westbrook? That one is absolutely laughable. While I have my disagreements with some of these players, Westbrook is clearly not as good as Trae young at this point in his career. How many times does Westbrook have to blow a close game for you to see this?  4) Ja Morant hasn't done anything to really show that he's on traes level. He's a good player. But he still can't shoot and it hinders his game.   5) There is no way in hell Rudy gobert is a better player than Trae young.   6) I wouldn't take Jimmy Butler over Trae Young. This hawks team is a worse roster than Miami had a year ago. And Jimmy Butler had a pretty forgettable year tbh. Maybe he bounces back next year.   7) CP3 is probably a wash at best. At his best he's better than Trae, but he can't carry a team like Trae can due to years of injuries and milage. Pick your poison. I'd take Paul in a single game, but Trae for an entire year  8) Tatum is debatable at best. I would say they are on the same tier. Same with Paul George."
This. They should‚Äôve kept Butler and Harris and looked for some shooters with their exceptions. Instead they let Jimmy go for peanuts and decided to sign Al Horford to a max. Not to mention letting Redick leave
I‚Äôm not moving the goal posts. üòÇü§£ü§£ you sent the chart not me.

I can‚Äôt reply to your dumb ass anymore
"In the short term, fines for ‚Äúdetrimental conduct‚Äù like when Jimmy Butler started waving the towel   Another possibility was to leverage removing testing for Marijuana in return for tighter team controls   In the long run, during the CBA negotiations, push for a hard cap, etc"
"In no order. Off the top of my head.

"If you do a closer look at the assists of guys like Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan and Ben Simmons youll notice a recurring theme: they dont generate many assists on shots at the rim. Ill let yall figure out what a common theme between those players is.  Also the very loose giving of assists on jumpers in the NBA has been a thing for decades, open secret what a joke it is."
You‚Äôre exactly right He hasn‚Äôt improved because he hasn‚Äôt done the work to improve. Chris Paul couldn‚Äôt shoot when he came into the league - look at even the development of somebody like Jimmy Butler who by all accounts is an absolute madman in the gym.
"There were rumors Butler didn‚Äôt like Ben in addition to Brett Brown. I wonder if Jimmy was going after Ben for not putting in the work to develop his offense and Brett, as Brett seemed to do, coddled him and told Butler that Ben is good as he is."
"I think the important thing to remember is if the Sixers hung on and won game 7, does this story still get told today? If the answer is no, ignore this media hit piece, it‚Äôs probably nonsense. This man had 2 years to talk about 2019 and Jimmy Butler and he waited until the Sixers crashed and burned because that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs going to get clicks and we can start the revisionist history/conspiracy theories. I see this ALL the time in Boston."
"As a 49 yr old 76er fan born n raised in NE Philly, who remember Mo Cheeks lay-up to clinch the 1983 NBA Championship, I can tell the Reddit World, this Game 7 Loss, the 26pt Game 5 Choke Collapse Loss, and entire Atlanta Series will take decades for Philly to get over....DECADES.....  Nobody and I mean nobody sees how #25 can show his face in the Sixer Uni next year.....he must go....Simmons career literally went down the crapper in the span of 1 Week.....from Perenial All-Star, nearly untradeable due to his immense value, to now, the 76ers would be lucky to get a crap expiring contract....Simmons us due $34mm next year  He has been offered Shootin Coaches, Sports Shrinks, FT Coaches, you name it, the 76er Organization has made all of the resources available to Simmons, but he is too cocky and egotistical to think he needs to take a Jumper....he still think there are no flawa in his game.  Nobody in Pro-Sports has ever witnessed such a sudden collapse of  vaunted player who is yet turned 26yr old.....  Here is the Philly Fan in a nutshell....blue-collar type, very bright sports knowledge, very passionate....will absolutely LOVE any player showing 100% effort, even if the talent is lacking....Philly Lved AI and Barkley and the Phils Aaron Rowand when he busted his face running theu the CF Wall....Philly loved Lindros, but hated his parents.....  If you do not show effort or passion, Philly will hate you regardless who you are  The 76ers can blame themselves!  From Colangelo being a complete Douchebag, drafting Markelle Fultz instead of Jayson Tatum, plus giving Danny Ainge 2 Lottery Pick 1st rounders, to the Jimmy Buckets trade  for Roco &amp; Saric and having Butler tell Brett Brown and Brand, umm thanks but no thanks,Ben Blows I'm signing with Miami, to all of the other wasted Lottery Picks, Noel, MC Williams, Okafor.....and NOW SIMMONS....fuckin joke....total joke  &amp;#x200B;  And dont think Embiid didn't blow in Game 6 &amp; 7.....8 TOs in each game....WTF ....yeah he is an MVP....not"
It‚Äôs not about knowing your role though. It‚Äôs setting up for failure since Jimmy had zero reps to get used to his teammates too. Both Butler and Simmons basically got the shaft
Jimmy Butler beating TWolves starters with third stringers
"The way teams will guard Simmons, the only difference between Simmons as the role man and Dwight Powell is Simmons can hit the open man if the defense rotates over. But that‚Äôs a lot to pay so much for. The real factor that they should consider it for is that KP is apparently pretty unhappy too, so it might make sense to trade him before he demands a trade and ranks his value too.  Gonna be interesting if either KP or Simmons get traded. The last player as good as either of them who had to rehabilitate his image as much was Jimmy Butler when people thought he was a cancer."
"Nah I think both things can be true here. That was the reason we didn‚Äôt pursue jimmy super hard and they were ok with the sign and trade, as well as jimmy wanting to go to Miami all along. Ben was frustrated and we had to choose between him or butler and we went with the younger guy who ppl thought had a brighter future but boy were they wrong"
"Jimmy Butler was 2 points away from becoming a Sixers legend. If Kawhi's shot doesn't land, I think the Sixers take it in overtime and Butler would have been the centerpiece of discussion for the next few seasons the same way Kawhi was.  Plus Sixers/Bucks would have been a great series in 2019."
"&gt;Am I the only one noticing this, when he drives he's always looking backwards.  [meanwhile when butlers driving he cant look back](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2580778-jimmy-butler-removes-rearview-mirror-in-his-car-as-a-symbol-to-never-look-back)"
Like playing as a small ball 5. Playing the Draymond green role. He wants to play on ball.  It was literally reported today that them making Jimmy Butler the primary facilitator on offense pissed Ben off.
"They discussed this on the Lowe Post podcast when he interviewed Yaron Weitzman, who wrote a book on the Sixers.  Weitzman pointed out three main reasons why Butler wasn‚Äôt brought back:  1) ben simmons‚Äô dissatisfaction with his role in the playoffs with butler handling the ball more. ben quoted as saying hanging in the dunker spot ‚Äúdefinitely isnt his role‚Äù. jimmy alludes to this in his interview with jj, he says he agrees with ben it wasn‚Äôt fair to him to switch up the offense the way they did without demoing it out first in the regular season etc.  2) the Sixers overpanicked to the no backup center minutes. the no embiid minutes were REALLY BAD in 2018-19 and they assumed embiid would miss time and they could get a lot of value out of a good backup, so they saw someone like horford as really important  3) the brett-jimmy relationship. apparently brett made it clear he was okay with coaching jimmy going forward but i think the front office may have interpreted that as ‚Äúwell he might be okay with it but is this the ideal relationship?‚Äù"
"Front office chose Ben Simmons over Jimmy Butler, what a bunch of cotton headed ninny muggings."
"Where are you getting these personal facts about him ‚Äúnot giving a shit‚Äù or him demanding to be the primary ball handler? Or the jimmy butler situation? Every time I‚Äôve heard jimmy speak about the 76ers he‚Äôs never dropped names.   I‚Äôm not calling you out, I‚Äôm curious.    Ben is still a young man and putting a whole franchise on his shoulder like he‚Äôs Jordan is completely unfair. Of course they brought in jimmy, jimmy is a grown as man.  Ben was 22 at the time. Jimmy was talking about accountability, Embid was acting like a giant baby all that season. A lot of y‚Äôall have short memories man.   I‚Äôm a Celtics fan and Tatum and Brown are just coming into their own despite the hype around them. They still do young boneheaded mistakes which is why we have smart there to reign them in. You need a vet presence."
"I mean obviously if Booker doesn‚Äôt win a ring then you‚Äôre comparison of him to Jimmy could be right, but the question is assuming booker accomplishes two big things that Jimmy didn‚Äôt. So therefore butler isn‚Äôt a good comparison for this scenario. Had the heat won it all and Jimmy got FMVP he would 100% be perceived differently than he is now"
Can we send Jimmy Butler to Doc‚Äôs shooting camp too?
"As a Raps fan, I felt so bad for Butler because that dude was a warrior all series... and while I'm happy (obviously) that my team won the series, it's so sad seeing such a heart-and-soul hard worker like Jimmy get bounced from an absolute one-in-a-million moonshot from Kawhi.  I still maintain to this day that if the Raps didn't have Marc Gasol, they would have lost."
"You tell me does a lineup of:   Prime Russ   Jimmy Butler   Giannis   Bam  Embiid   With DeRozan, Draymond, Simmons and Zion off the bench   They go 16-0 in the playoffs my guy"
I don't think making the finals is enough to automatically make you a superstar. Is Jimmy Butler a superstar ?
"The Sixers that season matched up better against the Bucks than the Raptors. Defensively they had Embiid down low to switch onto Giannis and that's after Giannis having to get through Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons. This Bucks team also didn't have Jrue Holiday and was a much weaker version of the current Bucks team. Looking at how the series Raptors and Bucks ended up, there is no reason the Sixers can't replicate that result."
"Because it so far hasn‚Äôt shown for anything outside of Embiid when they drafted multiple players.  Their front office has been a mess for years now  Overpay of other players while not keeping Jimmy Butler  They havent really developed their players either outside of Embiid, whos more natural progression. You‚Äôd think developing would be part of the process to making the team better.  It‚Äôs a cool title, great for marketing, but the process hasn‚Äôt done much for them"
The kid gloves need to come off. This is what? His sixth year in the league? Jimmy Butler was right about bens lazy ass. No more coddling
I been saying this. They should have re signed Butler instead of Harris or they should‚Äôve gotten rid of Ben. Jimmy was the one player other than Embiid that they should‚Äôve kept
What's the chances of the Knicks making a move for Simmons.  He will be given the green light along with Randle. Thibs value defenders and Simmons could be turned into a similar player to Jimmy Butler... From a ball handling and defensive perspective.
"Yeah I've been saying this all season.  Jimmy Butler was the only guy that had any killer instinct.  In that game 7 vs Toronto everyone was scared and timid and Jimmy kept them in it and even had the late basket to tie it up.  Embiid and Doc can throw Simmons under the bus all they want but they are both issues as well.  Embiid looked gassed at the end of the game and gave up a couple easy dunks and missed some rebounds he should have had.  I have been a Giannis skeptic but he showed me a lot in their game 7.  He went super hard and got some huge contested rebounds late in the game to help his team win.  Embiid was playing one end of the floor.  So was Simmons.  What Simmons lacked in passing and scoring, Embiid lacked in rebounding and defense.  He finished the game with 11 rebounds which doesn't sound bad but there were a few big ones he missed late in the game where Collins or someone would fly in and snag a rebound right in front of Embiid."
They're an Anthony Davis away from a title. Contention? They would just need ~a Jimmy Butler.
Jimmy Butler shot 29% from the field this playoffs and we are trying to act like he was a positive on the floor. Dude is a bum who gets hyped up by that fluke ass bubble run.
"Agreed on Tucker, love watching him.   Disappointing to see Simmons for sure. Even if he couldve grinded to get better like Jimmy Butler did when he entered the league he would‚Äôve really had GOAT potential with all of the gifts he has."
https://uproxx.com/dimemag/ben-simmons-sixers-jimmy-butler-free-agency-off-ball-point-guard-2019/    Litterally the reason they didnt sign butler back sounds a but diva ish to me
"&gt; Kawhi could‚Äôve just pick his spots from anywhere, no matter who was guarding him. I can see Artest and Kobe switching it up a bit and taking turns on Kawhi, and for sure Kawhi would‚Äôve had a tough challenge, but Kawhi also burned Jimmy Butler and Giannis in the previous series. Kawhi was just unstoppable that season.  Hmm   &gt;  That leaves Kobe‚Ä¶again, Kawhi would‚Äôve been a very tough defensive draw. Green was a very viable 3 &amp; D player. Siakim could‚Äôve spelled on Kawhi on some sequences too.  I see that you give leeway for Kawhi guarding Kobe saying it would make it hard for Kobe but for Kobe/Artest guarding Kawhi it's BBQ chicken or something?   Artest was no slouch defender especially against players like Kobe/Kawhi/Melo. Artest would be the best defender in the series hands down and the best player to have guarded Kawhi in that entire playoff run. He undoubtedly would give Kawhi a much harder time than Jimmy Butler. That's on top of Artest trying to make you mentally frustrated while trying to get under your skin all series which is something Butler doesn't do. Imagine how FVV and Dillon Brooks guards Curry, but instead some huge beast that is Artest is on your hip at all times. He didn't give anyone room to breath.  And with Kobe being the secondary defender on Kawhi, he would not be too far off either. He gave Melo a hard time in the 2009 WCF's behind Artest and Melo was just as capable of a scorer as Kawhi, just less efficient but with just as many tools if not more flexibility. I also feel Melo was quicker than Kawhi, while Kawhi is slower but more powerful which would allow Kobe to stay in front of Kawhi much easier than Melo.  There's no one on that Raptors roster that would give Kobe a harder time than what he faced in the western conference. Green would have been Kobe's primary defender but you have to realize that Danny Green wasn't capable of playing defense like prime Shane Battier ([incredibly underrated 1 on 1 defender vs Kobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aDM5d27_w)) and Tony Allen, who both still struggled to guard Kobe. In that video even with that amazing defense Kobe still gets 27ppg that series and drops a 40 piece. Don't forget that Kawhi was hiding defensively all playoffs guarding people like Ben Simmons, Iguadala and playing zone defense against the Bucks, the few times Kawhi is on Kobe, Kawhi isn't going to put much effort into it."
"&gt;Show your sources then, because nationally recognized reporters like Woj and Shams have said that Jimmy tried requesting a trade because they couldn't afford him a max extension before the offseason after they maxed Wiggins early, the team (Thibs) told him they'd work with him to facilitate a trade, Butler gave a list of preferred destinations, Thibs had a deal done with one of those preferred destinations (Miami) and then reneged at the last second to try to force Miami to give them more, and the deal exploded. Butler, pissed that they blew up a trade that they said they'd make, started acting out to force their hand.   And nationally recognised reporters aren't mouthpieces? Jimmy Butler who flew in Rachel Nichols to do a lying,slam piece on the Wolves is someone who you will trust in good faith?  You do understand that there are people who feed Woj and Shams information and they aren't investigative journalist who are bastions of truth and honesty lmao   But okay let's not believe people who are around the team and live in Minnesota but Rachel Nichols.  I mean you literally told me if the source isn't someone I like I won't believe you..."

"I'm so sick of Laker fans offering garbage for great players. ""I'd be okay if we parted with Alex Caruso and maybe a pick to sweeten the deal for Jimmy Butler."" Their hypothetical Lillard trades are a joke."
"Brett had jimmy butler, doc had literally no point guard. We can do this all day. Maybe let's just accept that it's always been the roster and not the coaching"
Bruh y'all trippin. Jimmy Butler and Simmons are both overrated as fuck. The only difference Butler would have made this series is that he would've went 4/14 instead of 1/4 from the field. Did we not see this man hard selling this playoffs?
"Only source I can find is this one text convo where Jimmy said Ben wasn‚Äôt doing things right and Ben Simmons got mad. Even though there isn‚Äôt anything other that suggests Ben had a problem, he probably did have one with Butler given his current attitude issues and just being a major bitch.

"Because it was the maximum amount of money he could have been offered at the time. Like I said if he waited until the off season he could have received the full max via his bird rights but you keep on changing facts lol.  [Butler rejects the Timberwolves' four-year, $110 million contract extension offer. It's the maximum offer the Wolves can give under league rules, but Butler was reportedly hoping that the team would make the necessary roster moves to restructure his contract and offer more money. As a free agent in the summer of 2019, Butler could be offered a five-year, $188 million contract from the Wolves or a four-year, $139 million contract from another team.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/jimmy-butler-trade-request-timeline-how-the-situation-got-so-bad-with-tom-thibodeaus-minnesota-timberwolves/)"
Pretty sure your GM tried to get Butler to take a discount after giving Wiggins a 5 year max early and Jimmy felt really disrespected by that.  Feel free to change the facts though lol.
"From what I remember the thing that Jimmy Butler claims pissed him off was that the Sixers were worried about ""controlling him"" (he said this on JJ Reddick's pod). Idk if it was the coach, GM, or whoever made this comment but according to him that is what did it."
Jimmy was the best player on that Sixers team and he took over the end of games. Everyone was still on the Butler is hard to manage bandwagon. Dude just wants to win and I can‚Äôt imagine he loved how Simmons treated the game
"JJ Reddict was on the team and confirmed it as well. Also, not everybody is Jimmy Butler status and can say stuff, burn bridges and still be guaranteed a job."
Jimmy Butler
"Yeah, a bunch of people saying ""don't get caught up in the heat of the moment/recency bias/etc""  This issue has been apparent since around the time Jimmy Butler got fed up and left."

"Probably will get downvoted, but why not trade Edwards for Simmons? If you are attempting to compete for a Championship, then building around a Big 3 of DLo/Simmons/KAT all on max contracts is the foundation. All 3 are at their peak as players or closing in on it at 27-29 very soon. Edwards at just 19 is the foundation for the ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù when you give up on building a championship team with DLo &amp; KAT on Max contracts. Their peaks will never overlap, which is why they will continue to lose. Edwards might be All NBA by the time he‚Äôs 24, but neither DLo or KAT will be in town by that point. And you have to question if he even reaches that point while a heavy portion of their offense involves those 2. Do you want to chase a championship or chase Chet Holmgren? You can‚Äôt do both. Committing to neither will put you in purgatory with a talented team who can‚Äôt win or lose enough.  Giving up LaVine for Jimmy Butler wasn‚Äôt a bad trade when Minnesota was playing extremely well in the West after being a mediocre team previously. It‚Äôs not ideal, but the results with Jimmy were different then the results you had with LaVine. It‚Äôs the nonsense that followed that season which made people sour on the deal as hindsight is 20/20."
so much better than jimmy butler
"Covington, Powell, and Jones Jr. come off the books after next season. That‚Äôs $32 million in room to sign a swingman over 6‚Äô6‚Äù to play the 3, and a weak side defending, 3-ball shooting PF.   Jimmy Butler, KD, and Julius Randle, JaMychal Green, Jaren Jackson Jr., Bamba, Okongwu, and others will be available.  Dame should be patient and wait a year, and if they don‚Äôt make moves at the deadline next year, then consider asking for a trade."
So pretending you didn't play Jimmy Butler and the merry men in the finals?
"I don't know man, Jimmy Butler ain't half bad."
"I think he can get several all-nba's under his belt, a consistent all-star. Maybe a few years here and there where he is a top 10 player in the league. A Paul George/Jimmy Butler level player."
Jimmy Butler
"Randle, Bogdanovic, Joe Harris, the entire lakers team as a whole, Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons"
"No disrespect to the Bucks but they have the easiest path to the championship ever.     \- Oladipo was out   \- Jimmy Butler played bad   \- Kyrie got hurt   \- Harden wasn‚Äôt 100%   \- Played 5th seed Hawks   \- Trae got hurt   If the Bucks win the Finals, this season officially does not count."
"Jimmy Butler played at the Lifetime fitness in Plymouth, Minnesota while he had his stuff going on with the wolves.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/amp/jimmy_butler_played_pickup_game_in_minneapolis_amid_trade_demand/s1_8061_27357209   I live here in Minneapolis, it was known he would go play every now and then at that lifetime."
"Good God. As a heat first, Atlanta fan second, let me tell you: the contrast between the two Reddit threads is crazy. The hawks Reddit is just happy we‚Äôre here and they post a bunch of shit memes. I fucking love it.   The Miami thread? You‚Äôd think the heat were gonna get KD, Gordon Hayward, Kawhi Leonard, and now Dame based on what some of those dudes post. They‚Äôre delusional honestly. And I love the heat. They‚Äôre my favorite team out of any sport. But damn!! They also think Jimmy Butler is a top ten player in the league!!!  Not trying to hate on my fellow fans, but what I think is going here is that the heat are ‚Äúcool‚Äù cuz it‚Äôs Miami and they‚Äôve won chips, but they‚Äôre not a bandwagon team at the moment. So I think that thread is flooded with somewhat new fans who are applying the soccer fan mentality to the Miami heat. Lol."
Omg I think the blazers should trade for jimmy butler too!!!!
"They weren‚Äôt an all time great but they probably would have gone back to back.  That 76ers team was built much better. Had Jimmy Butler, Robert Covington and had the floor spacing provided by the shooting of JJ Reddick.  The 2016 Warriors team almost lost to OKC. But we don‚Äôt use that as a knock against them."
We probably would have to trade Jimmy Butler away with Achiuwa to get Dame. Unless Dame himself says that he wouldn‚Äôt play on the court if traded somewhere.
"I don't blame him for wanting out, but if he really uses the backlash to his endorsement of Billups/Kidd as his excuse for wanting out that's definitely up there with the all time ways modern stars have done it. We've got The Decision, Norris Cole (my favorite), ""That's all folks"", the Jimmy Butler practice, Fat Harden in a strip club during Covid, and now ""sorry I didn't read the news when I was 7"""
"They would do a bam for dam straight up in a heartbeat of course but I think we're supposed to fill in some realism here, the pieces they'd need to include with bam would result in the heat being left with just jimmy butler, dame and draft picks in 2030"
"KAT went to the playoff 1 time in his career and it was the year Jimmy Butler was on his team and he averaged 15ppg in the series. Jimmy just took a team to the finals, how can you even bring up the playoffs"
Just don't get stupidly locked-in like Jimmy Butler
People definitely thought that ... also a lot of people you mentioned didn‚Äôt get a chance cuz they missed mad time ... guaranteed if you went back to 2009 and asked would you rather have wade rn or prime Kobe ... Kobe wins by an absolute landslide ... it‚Äôd be like asking people in 10 years  2021 Zach lavine or prime jimmy butler  Like on paper it looks good and is comparable but let‚Äôs get fuckin real ourselves
Imagine Damian with Jimmy Butler and Adebayo in Miami.
"Jimmy Butler but more physical, a better passer, and if he gave you the same feeling Jordan did when he pulled up from midrange."
Jimmy Butler would disagree
"&gt;DA has a solid midrange, is one of the best rebounders in the league, has great court vision for a big, one of the better hookshots in the league, does well against most guards on the perimeter, defends the paint as well as any other center, is good at staying out of foul trouble, and doesn't take plays off. Meanwhile, Herro can shoot the ball, and when that shot isn't falling, he's a detriment to the team.  He has all of that but he barely attempts any shoots that aren't pointblank at the rim.    &gt;I'm done with this one. The fact that I have to defend Ayton&gt;Tyler Herro in terms of talent, effectiveness, and potential just says to me that you're either trolling or just a remarkably dense homer (and I don't think it's the former).   I never said that Herro was better than Ayton I was just comparing the circumstances. You can't say the way Herro was playing last summer wasn't a great showing for a rookie like you can't say that the way Ayton is playing now isn't also really great but you also can't take a biased 12 game samplesize and determine a player rankings based on that.  If we went by last years playoffs Jimmy Butler was a top 5 player in the NBA and if we went by this playoffs Jimmy Butler is a bottom 100 player in the NBA  &gt;Oh no, a team's sub hyped up their guy. What a crime. I'm talking about here, in the land of multiple fanbases where opinions aren't as uniform as team subs. Most of the people I see putting Ayton above KAT are not Suns flairs.  I mean Suns fans are the first one's to jump in and say how there is a conversation about DA being better than KAT, I can link you all the instances of them doing that if you want. But I have watched both of them and the difference between them is a chasm (otherwise every center in the nba could shoot and score like KAT...)."
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don‚Äôt fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he‚Äôs not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don‚Äôt act like later round lottery draft picks don‚Äôt turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
"Tough to say. Fitting a guy without a 3pt shot is a little tough, especially if he‚Äôs your second or third best player like most people think he‚Äôd thrive in   The second and third option must operate off the catch, and if they‚Äôre only choice is driving into a mid range or a layup, your offense will suffer  He‚Äôs succeeded so far cause he‚Äôs the main option. He gets to dictate what happens in every play, same thing with Jimmy Butler. Both of their 3pt shots are non existent but they‚Äôre ability to dictate plays makes it work. You put these guys somewhere else and their success will be much lower"
"CP3 to Phoenix feels like Jimmy Butler to Miami to me. Both are the perfect places for each player. You could tell last playoffs those young guys respected the hell out of Jimmy, very similar roles with both to me"
"Not Jimmy Butler, that‚Äôs all I know"
"Simmons just seems to be the ""Anti-Jimmy Butler"".... basketball is just a job where he gets paid multi- millions,while at same time getting to date hot models and celebrities.Dude loves the ""NBA"" lifestyle,but not basketball itself unlike Butler who sees basketball as his life."
"&gt;Ayton is 2nd in the 2021 playoffs in Win Shares and plays well on both sides of the ball. KAT has only made the playoffs once, when Jimmy Butler led the Timberwolves to the playoffs, and the one time we saw him in a playoff situation he got dominated by Clint Capela.   ""both sides of the ball"", I mean if you gave KAT open lobs every possession shit he'd play good too ü§£  And yeah KAT being all NBA that season had no impact on the making the playoffs?  &gt;and the one time we saw him in a playoff situation he got dominated by Clint Capela.   Have you ever checked what Jimmy Butler averaged that playoffs?  &gt;It‚Äôs just really unfair to even try comparing WindNo players like Ayton to regular season players like KAT.  Delusional."

"KD, Harden, Dame, and Jimmy Butler when he‚Äôs healthy"
Hopefully it‚Äôs not a case like that finals game last year when Jimmy Butler just ran out of gas after his huge performance
People on this subreddit really are amazing. Even if we ignore the players contracts and salary cap Tyler Herro is just straight up not better than Ben Simmons. Also why would the Heat want to surround Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler with even less spacing lol?
"Lmao there's a reason it's almost unanimous that Lebron would be unbeatable and that KD would be his only real challenge in the scenario. To have the best team of all 1 player, the player needs to be a big, quick, versatile small forward that can defend, shoot, handle and playmake. Lebron/KD are unique and it's why they are so dominant. The players you're looking for in this scenario are going to be Lebron, KD, Kawhi, PG13, Giannis and then guys like Jimmy Butler are second tier. They are quick enough to keep up, long enough to clog the paint on drives and recover, strong enough to push em around. Specifically Lebron, KD, Giannis and to a lesser extent Kawhi would DOMINATE on the inside, would shoot 90% and get the lions share of rebounds. It's the same reason that no centers could keep up. Those guys can still hang with post defense but the bigs are nowhere near quick enough to hang on the perimeter or ball handle. These games are dominated by a specific type of player, and it's not a 6'3"" point guard."
"My bad, think I got that part mixed up with Jimmy Butler."
Jimmy Butler couldn't get through to Simmons.
"Trade idea:   Raptors get:   * Jimmy Butler  Heat get:   * De'Aaron Fox  * Marvin Bagley  Kings get:   * OG Anunoby  * Tyler Herro  * Precious Achiuwa  * Rodney Hood (filler)  * 2022, 2024, 2026 Raptors 1sts  * 2024, 2026, 2028 Heat 1sts  Let's say the Raptors draft Suggs. They will have a lot of cap space so let's say they sign John Collins or Richaun Holmes. Then they run something like Suggs/Fred/Butler/Siakam/Collins. That's a good playoff team.   Heat pay up to move on from their aging core to get one of the top young players in the game. Fox is a beast, averaging 25/4/7 last season. Plus they get a reclamation project in Bagley, who still has potential. A Fox/Bam duo could be built around for the next decade.  Kings get a a quality young wing, a promising young point guard, a promising young big man, and six 1sts to continue their rebuild.  They can go forward with Haliburton/Hield/Anunoby/Barnes/???, with Herro/(Ninth Pick)/Precious off the bench. That's a solid young core."
"Career TS% for a star as in for Jayson Tatum, not for Jimmy Butler. And you mentioned the playoffs.  The only run he had with elite efficiency was 2021 in the bubble.  ‚ÄúThis is true for most players‚Äù  Which is my point. The difference between the two is Jimmy Butler no longer can shoot. So those dips that he used to have are going to become much more pronounced when the reality that he CANT SHOOT becomes more obvious.   ‚ÄúElevate‚Äù doesn‚Äôt imply just TS%. Volume matters and volume matters A LOT come playoff time. Tatum in his last two years alone has hit higher playoff volumes than Butler has EVER had, all while rivaling or straight up destroying him in efficiency. Butler will CONTINUE to struggle while Tatum will not.   Tatum PPG increases   2018 - +5 2019 - -0.5 2020 - +2 2021 - +4   He‚Äôs done this maintaining relatively the same efficiency.   ‚ÄúNot really, he was incredible efficient last postseason without a jumpshot‚Äù   Except that was in the bubble where he suddenly received a respectable jumper. Which is what I explained prior‚Ä¶  So no, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmarginally‚Äù different. Jimmy Butler will largely become more matchup based in terms of playoff performance just like every other guard in the league that cannot shoot.  The Lakers were quite literally going under Jimmy Butler screens and had whoever the fuck before finally putting AD on him. The DHOs of the Heat were clearly a problem lmao. He looked great against the Bucks last year when they wouldn‚Äôt even put Giannis on him and didn‚Äôt have Jrue or PJ. He then struggled against Smart, Tatum, Brown, before finally feasting on Lakers dumb strategy and weaker guards."
"Unbelievable. Go rewatch game 3 and 5 of last year‚Äôs finals where Jimmy was the best player on a floor that also had Lebron and AD, WHILE jimmy was missing his 2 best co-stars. Not you, impokk, but anyone who seriously believes that Jimmy is in the same tier as Middleton or Tobias. Ask yourself if they could‚Äôve done THAT. 40 pt triple doubles and shit‚Ä¶these jimmy haters need to gtfo.  To answer the thread, right now, I still lean Butler. But it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Tatum pases him, if he hasn‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs really close, IMO. I think the defensive and playmaking impact Jimmy has gives him the edge right now."
"&gt; career TS% from a guy who has recently become a star is more than laughable. But you know that, you also know why volume and TS is more impressive than just TS ‚Ä¶ (I hope)  You‚Äôre welcome to look at his efficiency since he became a star.  2014/15 - 22.9 ppg on 56.2 TS%  2016/17 - 22.7 ppg on 52.8 TS%  2017/18 - 15.8 ppg on 55.7 TS%  2018/19 - 19.4 ppg on 56.4 TS%  2019/20 - 22.2 ppg on 61.6 TS%  2020/21 - 14.5 ppg 39.4 TS%  Keep in mind that league average TS% was lower back in 2014 then it is now. He‚Äôs really only had 2 ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù runs. 2016/17 and 2020/21. The rest are either average, above average or elite.  &gt; average efficiency? Sure. He also regularly DIPS in efficiency even when he could shoot.  This is true for most players. When the playoffs come around defences tighten up and efficiency goes down.  &gt; Jesus Christ. Tatum came off an injury that clearly affected him and wasn‚Äôt playing well at first. Regardless, my entire POINT isn‚Äôt about their respective percentages in the regular season, it‚Äôs about how they can elevate to scoring heights in the playoff. Tatums volume is more sustainable because he can SHOOT the basketball.  But the elevate part isn‚Äôt true though. Tatum‚Äôs efficiency either dips or remains the same literally every season of his career.  2017/18 - 58.6 TS% (RS) to 57.8 TS% (PS)  2018/19 - 54.7 TS% (RS) to 53 TS% (PS)  2019/20 - 56.7 TS% (RS) to 56.3 TS% (PS)  2020/21 - 57.6 TS% (RS) to 57.7 TS% (PS)  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the fact that he maintains those averages pretty consistently is incredibly impressive. To say he *elevates* them in the postseason is just straight up not true. Which is fine, the list of players who‚Äôs efficiency actually goes up in the playoffs is very very short.   &gt;Jimmy whose efficiency dips in the playoffs anyways, has now forgotten how to shoot. Why is that significant? Because now as a player he depends on getting to the line to bolster his efficiency. In the playoffs, it becomes easier for elite defensive teams to hone in on that much more than they can a 3 level scorer like Tatum with elite 3 point creation.  I mean, not really. He was incredibly efficient last postseason with no jumpshot. It‚Äôs only this season that he‚Äôs really been inefficient.  &gt;1.) the attention he received was MUCH different than what he‚Äôs going to get going further. The HeT aren‚Äôt a surprised team anymore.   This is the most ridiculous made up ‚Äúreason‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen for a player playing well. Teams know who Butler is. Nobody was game planning for fucking Tyler Herro last season lmao  &gt;That Bucks series was not just Jimmy not playing well, it was a textbook example of a team shutting down a star. Which is infinitely much harder for a player like Tatum.  It‚Äôs marginally harder, not ‚Äúinfinitely‚Äù. You‚Äôre speaking solely in exaggerations."
"&gt;A better question would be ‚ÄúJimmy Butler or Tobias Harris‚Äù   I don't think I've ever met anyone who'd actually legit take Tobias Harris over JB.   Actually, I take it back, I did meet one person. But they were convinced that last year, Butler's best days were behind him... He had his best career this season lol."
"I originally had ‚ÄúJimmy Butler‚Äù and then added the second sentence after getting downvoted a couple minutes later. The regular season and playoff push part added at the same time. So you read both parts. You‚Äôre the one saying you didn‚Äôt read it man, sounds like you care a little too much if you‚Äôre gonna make that up"
"I'm not here to argue though, I'm here to laugh about Jimmy ""I'll handle the rest"" Butler."
"Yeah I'm sure the edit was totally something else üëç, can't imagine caring this much about a jimmy butler argument"
"Jimmy Butler will never make another NBA finals in his life and he will never win a ring, but Tatum probably will."
A Knicks fan having a hate boner for Jimmy Butler is so random lol
Tatum... If there's any argument against advanced metrics its Jimmy Butler.
"There are a lot of things wrong here.  First of all, every other player besides Jimmy shit the bed, so Jimmy had the full defensive pressure of not just Giannis, but Jrue, Middleton, Tucker, Divincenzo, and Lopez in the paint. Butler is a player that thrives off slashing, and having a wall like that built against him left him with no options.    Butler vs Harris or Middleton isn't a better question than Tatum vs Butler. Butler has crazy good impact stats, is a much better playmaker than Tatum, scores more efficiently, and is a better defender. The only thing Tatum does better than Butler is score at a higher volume."
How did Miami take the Lakers to six games without Bam and Dragic? Are you saying Jimmy Butler alone is better than AD and Lebron?
"S: Lebron, Steph  A: KD, Kawhi  B: Harden, Giannis, Westbrook, Chris Paul  C: AD, Dame, Luka, Kyrie  D: Jokic, Embiid, Jimmy Butler  E: Trae Young (If he makes it to the finals he moves up)  This is based on superstar status, not skill level. Mainly who non-fans would recognize from commercial success."
paul george or jimmy butler or russell westbrook
"Beal, Jimmy Butler, CP3, booker, CJ, Randle"
"Trae isn‚Äôt a superstar yet. One good playoff run doesn‚Äôt make a superstar. If it did, Jimmy Butler would be one. The winning has to be sustained for multiple years."

Jimmy Butler ran point all the way into an NBA finals run my friend
"Scottie at his best was a 21/8/5 guy, and he was the best perimeter defender. Adjust those stats to present-day pace and scoring, and it's likely a 24/7/7 guy. I'd say like a version of Jimmy Butler that was better on defense, or a Kawhi Leonard type that wasn't as great of a shot creator.   Scottie was a lot better than what this sub gives him credit for"
Jimmy Butler light
Jimmy butler 2.0
"Around 8-12, probably last year Jimmy Butler in the playoffs level but all season long. I'm taking Giannis, Harden and Luka above him though and there's already players above them."
"At his peak the season without MJ he was a 22ppg scorer, 8 rpg, 5 apg, with great defense. That sounds like  a Jimmy Butler type of player. So wherever y‚Äôall see Butler is the tier Scotty would be in."
"Go back to your cry baby franchise who lost a winner in Jimmy Butlerü•≤, probably gonna move to Seattle in 13 months!! Kirk Cousins can also suck it!!"
He's genuinely playing like a scoring point guard. It's great to see. Playing more of a Jimmy Butler role than his usual high volume scoring self.
That would be Jimmy Butler.
Jimmy Butler
"I worked at the Benihana in San Diego for about four years and saw a fair number of famous people. Jimmy Butler was the only athlete who tipped well. Every Charger who came in there tipped like ass, including LT and his agent/manager."
It's what Jimmy Butler called him on a long time ago and here we are.
"I'd put him in the same category of Jimmy Butler and PG, where the conversation will be dicey depending on if they get some rings or not."
Ngl Jimmy Butler also has the same mentality and u can tell.
"It would be great if we could just clear cap space and get Jimmy Butler to come over, but OKC doesn't get FA like that.  We have to draft players and hold them against their will to stay here..."
"For all the 1-on-1 defender greatness, it seems a habit with Milwaukee to have superstars go nova.    Last night, Trea Young goes crazy.    2020 Jimmy Butler. reg season ppg: 19.8  Bucks series ppg: 23.5    2019 Kawhi Leonard. reg season ppg: 26.4  Bucks series ppg: 29.8"
"Difference is thibs has had success. He had the 1 seed his first 2 years as a hc, then dragged the bulls through d-roses injury problems unleashing Joakim point center Noah, Jimmy 30th overall Butler, and FVV level production from Nate robinson, dj augustin, and A-A-Ron Brooks. And even in Minnesota, they were an elite team when jimmy was healthy. Compare that to kidd who was ass in Milwaukee."
"I think our real problem is attracting talent.  Post-Hibbert PG13 Pacers could have been great. Instead it was a team with Monta Ellis as the 2nd option  2015 FA (some were restricted I think):  Kawhi, Marc Gasol, Kevin Love, Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, Brook Lopez, Danny Green, Khris Middleton, Reggie Jackson (PG13's long time friend and aspiring teammate), Rondo   2016 FA: KD, Conley, Horford, Derozan, Whiteside, Howard, Batum, Beal, Barnes, Bazemore, Gasol, Jordan Clarkson, Eric Gordon     We also traded a first round pick and still landed on a lineup of:  Teague  Monta Ellis   Paul George  Thad Young  Myles Turner (20 y/o)  w/ either Lance Stephenson, CJ Miles, or Rodney Stuckey as our 6th man  --------------  This is why I don't harbor resentment towards PG13. He asked for help and we did fuck all. And, while I think that is more because the market than the FO, not every player can be expected to be Reggie and stick it out through thick and thin. He's from Cali, wants to win or play in Cali or both, fine. We don't offer winning, well, it's done for.   But I think our mediocrity has little to do with it. While the Hawks and Suns did fantastically tanking in our time since PG13 the Pistons, Knicks, Magic, Kings, and more have seen little reward for it."
Might be a dumb question but could the sixers have kept both tobi and butler as long as they didn‚Äôt sign horford? The Butler contract was 31M more than Horford‚Äôs so just wondering if it still would have worked out. Idk if they had bird rights on Jimmy and I don‚Äôt really know anything about the salary cap lol
"After the Heat flamed out this year with Jimmy playing like garbage I saw ""Jimmy Butler is just Stanley Johnson with an alarm clock""."
"This is one of my favorite domino effects in recent NBA history, that is partly accidental.  &amp;#x200B;  So Mikal Bridges, the 10th pick, gets traded to the Suns from the 76ers for Zhaire Smith, the 16th pick, currently in the G League, and the Miami Heat unprotected 2021 pick. That pick was considered to be a huge gem, because Dwyane Wade was going to retire soon, and the Heat did not have a lot of young talent to keep them up.   The 76ers wanted that pick badly and used it to trade for Tobias Harris. Remember, in between this they were able to get Jimmy Butler for just Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless, and a 2nd round pick.   To get Harris + Boban Marjanovic + Mike Scott, they gave up Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala (who got traded for Ivica Zubac), the Heat 2021 first, a lottery protected 76ers 2020 first, and two Detroit second rounders.   So now the plan for the 76ers was to wield a lineup for the next few years of Ben Simmons, JJ Reddick, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, and Joel Embiid, and fill the bench with their remaining picks and exception players. But Kawhi's game winner in the 2019 East semifinals resulted in Butler and Reddick's departures due to mismanagement from the part of the Elton Brand Front Office, who instead only kept Harris (likely due to the number of picks they parted with for him) and gave Al Horford an ill-advised max extension. That Horford deal led to the Danny Green-Horford swap, then the Kemba-Horford swap.  Jimmy Butler went to the Miami Heat, which made them at least a borderline playoff team, and then he took them to the finals. That made the 2021 Heat pick hardly valuable anymore, and so the Clippers were forced to part with more picks than they originally expected to when they traded for Paul George in order to sign Kawhi Leonard.   Meanwhile the Suns kept building, and eventually, got Monty Williams as their coach, who led them to an 8-0 record in the bubble, and then they were able to deal for CP3, who got traded to the Thunder from Houston for Russell Westbrook, which doesn't happen without the Paul George trade. And an underrated reason for the second seeded Suns finish this year was Mikal Bridges ability as a 3 and D wing.  So in the big brain move by Elton Brand, he let Jimmy Butler walk in order for the big asset he parted with for Tobias Harris to look like nothing, and force the Clippers to have to mortgage their entire future to get Paul George and Kawhi Leonard instead of only a few picks. Obviously so smart because Jimmy Butler has only been to \*checks notes\* the NBA finals, and the 76ers have been to \*checks notes\* the Eastern Conference Semifinals."
Sign and trades don‚Äôt give back equal value...if you‚Äôre expecting a good young player and a first I hate to disappoint. Jimmy Butler was sign and traded for Josh Richardson lol
"I love this comment because the Sixers traded for Jimmy Butler, completely derailing your entire comment lol.   No one is saying it happens every year, I don't know why you're caught up in thinking I'm saying it's common.   Over a long period of time, opportunities *will* become available. Like I said, do the math that I showed you (which is very conservative) and tell me what you come up with."
"How are this years' Bucks better than the team the Raptors beat? And the Raptors beat a Sixers team with Jimmy Butler, Embiid, Tobias, and Simmons who was actually agressive. And Kawhi's carry job was absurd during that run. Nothing Trae has done comes remotely close."
"Eh not really.  * Kawhi had an agent reshuffling before asking out of San Antonio (but stayed with same overall agency).  * Kyrie changed agent before leaving Boston.   * Jimmy Butler changed agent before leaving Chicago.   Not saying that's definitely what Embiid is doing, but it is something that can happen.  Maybe he wants a better sponsorship deals. Maybe he isn't getting along with his current representation. Maybe he's looking to change teams.   Generally there's a reason for why players change agents, it would be too much of a ball ache process unless he had some sort of reason."
"&gt;Mavs took Luka Doncic over this guy   Is this bait??  Or copy pasta..    You know how insane Doncic is, and how even more insane he could be with a better team.

AND HE'S IN THE WEST   &gt;   Trae Young has been GREAT, but even Jamal Murray and Jimmy Butler did crazier Historic shit just last season in the Playoffs..     This Atlanta team is playing such insane defense all around. Defense is what makes the difference.

"You know that guy is joking right??  It's classic bait. Copy Pasta  &gt;   Luka is better.. with way more potential. He was the best player on the floor in the last two Playoffs.

Did you forget what Jamal Murray did last year in the playoffs? Or Jimmy Butler??   HISTORIC shit.   Even greater than anything Trae Young did or doing in this Playoffs run  &gt;   We'll see who does what in their careers, long term. The end matters the most. Unreal consistency is the difference between just a few and the rest   It'd be premature and ignorant to even talk about all that right now. Especially when you just have to be biased"
Nate McMillan stock is reaching Jimmy Butler last year levels.
"it was TJ who was talking to Butler about it, but like Jimmy said nobody would speak up.    Jimmy did.   Then he basically refused to shoot open 3's for a month which has never been explained.   my tin foil hat theory is that at some point before the deadline they told Jimmy they will help him go where he wants this summer if he just plays ball the rest of the year.   they then spent way too much for Tobi to fill that 3rd max slot.    the past 7 years since we drafted Embiid really have been wild as fuck"
"The difference is no one on the Hawks is really playing way over their head (Herro, Robinson, heck even Butler), the Hawks best players are young and clearly on an upward trajectory, and their best player isn't Jimmy Butler who's always really been a 2nd-3rd tier star. It's not really comparable, most of the Hawks players have proven they can do what they're doing and all figure to keep getting better"
"Yall got Embiid though. That's the most important part. Imo the worst moment that wasn't just shit luck was choosing to keep Simmons over Butler. The more I look back on that, the more I think that it was a 'me or him' from Jimmy"
"&gt; 2009 has Harden/Curry/Rubio  Did you just put *Rubio* ahead of Blake, Jrue, and Demar DeRozan?  '11 should be mentioned, too. (Kawhi, Kyrie, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris, Vuc, Klay)   '12 was AD/Dame/Draymond/Beal/Middleton which ain't bad, either."
"Honestly there really was never going to be a Kobe trade for one simple reason: Kobe had a No Trade Clause. That meant that anywhere the Lakers would be willing to trade Kobe (i.e. for a package that included at least one, and maybe two, All Star caliber players) was going to be a trade that Kobe would veto as it would leave him alone on a new team that couldn't contend. The Lakers weren't going to trade Kobe to a team and get nothing of value back, and Kobe wasn't going to agree to a trade that would use all its assets to get him. It was basically a stalemate. Kobe didn't want to just not be a Laker anymore, he just wanted to be on a team that could compete for championships, and he didn't see the Lakers being able to do that.   I suppose Kobe could have gone the Jimmy Butler/James Harden/Vince Carter route and tried to sandbag his value by mailing it in on the court or trying to ruin team chemistry or something, but he never did that. Actually a big turning point in that whole fiasco was the second game of the regular season, where the Lakers went to Phoenix (a team that had been kicking their ass for the last few years, and who was one of the best teams in the West), and [the Lakers absolutely blew them out](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200711020PHO.html) despite Kobe having a very subpar game. I think that was the first time Kobe began to think ""wait a second, maybe this team is better than I thought?"" By the time Bynum went down with his season-ending injury in early January the Lakers had the top seed in the West and Kobe had retracted his trade demand. A couple weeks later the Lakers traded for Pau and the rest was history."
"Some Twitter troll posted the intro to Rachel Nichols bubble interview with Jimmy Butler, but it instead cut to really loud moaning, which has caught a number of users off guard.  https://twitter.com/Spida45SZN/status/1412309476208640001?s=19"
"&gt;The least watched Final‚Äôs game in game 3 of the 2020 NBA finals, with just 5.94 million viewers.  Kinda sad that this was the Jimmy Butler game, where he put up a 40/11/13/2/2 on 14/20 shooting to single-handedly steal a game from the Lakers.  One of the better individual performances in recent playoff history, and everybody tuned out."
Yeah but did you see one of Lebron James and Jimmy Butler?
Maybe Jimmy Butler can help her through this...
2021 will ALSO be the first NBA finals since 2019 that we don't see either LeBron James or Jimmy Butler.
Technically the title is true AND your comment are both true. It is the first finals since 2020 AND the first finals since 2019 without either LeBron or Jimmy Butler.
Remember when everyone said Jimmy Butler in full Miami heat gear was playing basketball in his room that everyone loled at last playoffs that‚Äôs when they are saying it happened lmfao people just don‚Äôt like her so they gonna try to ruin her life.
"&gt;	word is spreading fast she was having an affair with Jimmy Butler in the bubble.  Ersan Ilyasova, too. They‚Äôre just pulling names out of thin air with no actual source."
"she's not living that down. i don't think she leaves right away, but she'll probably leave after her current contract expires. the story has snowballed on her/ESPN, i think Maria Taylor probably leaves (or will not be renewed cuz she's DEFINITELY not getting ""Stephen A Smith money"" let alone $5 mill in a post-COVID landscape with all these companies trying to recoup lost revenue from the pandemic) and that will be a sticking point for some viewers (rightly or wrongly she'll be the ultimate scapegoat), plus the basketball talent at ESPN has been drawn into the situation to the point that they've had to take sides supporting whichever female they predominantly work with whether its Maria or Rachel.  plus everything she says from now on or has said in the past will be pored over and scrutinized for tone, sincerity, intent etc. for instance topics like BLM or even MLK Day that the NBA has clearly embraced as a day for a lot of games amid ongoing conversations about MLK/race/etc., where virtually every NBA personality with a platform is expected to to have something to say, anything she says will get pushback, especially if Taylor leaves and she's perceived as an insincere ally.   she's also tried to be too friendly/buddy buddy with the superstars but that's backfired on her with people openly speculating if Jimmy Butler smashed. both the Jump and her interviews always have some tabloid-y  elements trying to unnecessarily stir shit up, and now she's getting a taste of her own medicine in that respect.  the sad thing is that she probably is right in most of what she said (hosting Countdown IS in her contract, ESPN probably gave it to Taylor last year in some tone-deaf attempt to promote diversity during a charged racial time in the country) just that she added a few lines that in today's climate are not going to be well-received. Taylor understandably did her no favors by not trying to quash the beef when she tried to apologize"
"She probably isn‚Äôt up for it. In addition to losing her Finals gig this morning, word is spreading fast she was having an affair with Jimmy Butler in the bubble.   Not the best day to be her..."
"Can we just drop this narrative that all finals series have to include a player named Lebron James or Jimmy Butler? This sub is full of nephews who were probably born after 2010 and dont even know what real basketball is about. You just watch it because you found out that your favorite Kardashian was dating some NBA player and now you watch it just for that.   I can count up at least 3 Finals that didnt include Jimmy Butler or Lebron James. The 1990-1991 season? No Lebron or Jimmy. The 2003 Finals? Nope. Hell, in 1980, neither of them were even alive!   Can we just enjoy the game and stop creating these narratives?"
I saw Jimmy Butler just a few posts ago.
&gt; now rumors is Jimmy Butler piped her and sent her back to the streets.   &gt;   &gt;That tuff!üî•üíØ  This sub seriously needs a minimum age requirement
Well she is married to someone not named Jimmy Butler so that would make it kind of scandalous if nothing else.
Andrew Wiggins and Jimmy Butler do not love it the same.
Hopefully her and Jimmy Butler will have more time to spend together. Miami hasn‚Äôt been the same since they stopped fucking
I have no opinion on her but you can tell r/nba is going on a typical anti media circlejerk (fire all ESPN people) with a cross section from some people that are just mysoginist (she slept her way to the top/fucking Jimmy Butler)
Can anyone confirm that Jimmy Butler clapped her cheeks?
If the Rockets took Jordan instead of the Bulls  If D Rose wouldn‚Äôt have gotten injured   If Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt get traded
has woj confirmed the jimmy butler news
Who would have thought that the 2020 bubble would effectively end the career of Rachel Nichols while black Twitter is saying that Jimmy Butler was bursting hers.
Rachel finna go release her frustrations out on Jimmy butler
Can someone explain this Jimmy Butler rumour?  Where did it come from?
Jimmy Butler is bustin in her cheeks
Now she has more time to hang out with Jimmy Butler
"You can‚Äôt just assume players will get better at the things you want them to. If Giddey can make his handle, shooting, and athleticism better, then can‚Äôt every player this draft be good? If Kispert improves his shooting a bit, and makes his foot speed/handles better he can be Klay. If Kai improves his defensive IQ and handle he could be a mix of Tatum and Giannis. If Kuminga improves shooting and handles then he could be Kawhi but more athletic. If Barnes improves his finishing and shot creation he‚Äôs a bigger Jimmy Butler. All of these hypotheticals are interesting to think about, but realistically none of these outcomes will happen. This is because you simply can‚Äôt erase what you don‚Äôt like in a prospect to make them into something they aren‚Äôt."
"It's certainly true that Bud gets a massive amount of heat and some of that should absolutely go to our players forgetting how to shoot from three every postseason, but it doesn't change the fact that he was nowhere close to championship quality coach in the 2019 or 2020 postseasons. He was dreadful. Not playing his stars big minutes like literally every other coach, going way too deep into his bench way too early, shit like leaving Wes Matthews on the bench while Jimmy Butler roasted our ass...one can go on. I'm glad he's finally seemed to learn his lesson, but I'm not on board with rewriting history to act like Bud was anything less than terrible the previous two postseasons. He seemed to be the only coach to treat the playoffs as just an extension of the regular season and not a whole different animal altogether."
jimmy butler trending on twitter.
"I literally just told you that I have seen 50+ Pippen games last 3 years? I know everything about his numbers without Jordan, his defense and impact in general. You are trying to brush me off as someone who is clueless, but thats not me. I put the time down cause I want to have a valid opinion on past players and the 90's Bulls is one of the teams I watched the most, so try that shit with someone else.  Nothing you said here convices me that he was a superstar. You know who also average 20+ while being a great playmaker and defender? Jimmy Butler, who is also not a superstar. Paul George had equal value as well, and also finished 3rd in MVP voting. Not a superstar.  &gt;He is literally Just slightly worse at everything than LeBron James he was Lebron of his generation, just overshadowed because he had Jordan on his team and the goat overshadows everyone.  This is an INSANE take. So he is basically a slightly worse Lebron? You are overrating him an incredible amount here. Lebron is a MUCH better scorer, better playmaker by a significant margin as well, much better leader and Pippen is only ahead defensively while not being close to Lebron in anything other than rebounding."
Id be interested in seeing what Jimmy butler could do if he wanted a role
Jimmy Butler?
"I don‚Äôt know, but why isn‚Äôt anyone here talking about the Jimmy Butler piping Rachel Nichols rumors?!?"
"This OC far exceeds the content of r/nba. Hell of a job OP  For reference, there is a posted that was made minutes before this about a Rachel Nichols and Jimmy Butler sex tape"
"Wait I thought it was a trash stat? Lmao. And raptor ranked Lillard as tied for 10‚Äôth with Jimmy Butler, not 6‚Äôth . Why lie about that? Than ranking is pretty accurate in my opinion. He should be ranked somewhere between 10 and 15.   Kanter has worked on other teams defensively when he has played with strong defensive guards. He has never been a good defensive center but this season was his worst defensive DRAP season for a reason. He wasn‚Äôt exposed in Boston last season for instance."
"I have never seen anyone who is not a complete troll claim that Jordan had no help. No superstars though? Thats just factual. Pippen was a star player, but not a superstar. He is in that same tier as Paul George, Jimmy Butler etc. He is better than both just to be clear, but he is not in the superstar tier like Lebron, Durant Curry etc."
So does Jimmy Butler apparently
I haven‚Äôt seen where it came from it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúJimmy Butler‚Äù trending and all the tweets are about him smashing Rachel and linking some noise complaint someone filed against him in the bubble. I don‚Äôt see any actual verified reporters commenting or anything though lol
Anyone see Jimmy Butler apparently nailed Rachel Nichols in the bubble trending on Twitter? Is that true lol
im so confused i saw this on twitter. What is the reason everones saying jimmy butler smashed her
"A lot of people would argue over that but they forget the rankings are always based on the playoffs, like Jimmy Butler last season was ranked top 10 in the NBA after these playoffs and how he played I‚Äôm pretty sure most fans don‚Äôt consider him too 10  Even Trae was viewed as over rated now he‚Äôs respected and viewed as a winning guy  So yeah maybe AD isn‚Äôt top 5 right now, but he was dominant in the playoffs and was in the FMVP discussion so he was pretty much top 5 then, but because he was mostly injured this season he wasn‚Äôt"
"&gt; Not blindly sticking to the drop scheme, but incorporating way more switching, particularly in small-small actions. This absolutely destroyed the Bucks in last year's series against Miami, when they would mindlessly drop on even small-small actions and get burned repeatedly with the screener getting good looks &gt;   The reason Bucks stick to drop scheme is because it's been working for them, consistently being top defensive team every year under Bud  And it's due to personel, Brook Lopez is terrible at switching, Giannis is terrible at navigating screens and is way better on help defense  Also drop coverage has been better for them vs the Hawks than actually switching, i've pointed out this before the Hawks in the first 4 games actually scored less points per game with Trae Young healthy than in the last 2 when Bucks adopted the switching scheme   Hawks first four games, 104ppg Bucks playing drop coverage  Hawks last 2 games, crippled Trae Young as well, 109ppg with Bucks switching &gt;Not going under screens guarding Jimmy Butler (a poor off the dribble shooter) until they were on the verge of getting swept, and not letting Giannis guard him. They did both of those things in the rematch, putting size on him with Giannis/Tucker and going under on screens daring him to beat them with the jumper, and absolutely clamped Jimmy for the series.   Again, this goes to the same thing, it's personel and Giannis is not good at guarding other guards because he can't navigate screens, he's said that himself because of his size   &gt;Play your fucking core guys more minutes. Bud did absolutely mind-blowingly stupid things like playing Khris Middleton 33 minutes in a PLAYOFF game that he was +18 in but the Bucks lost by just 2 points.    https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202009020MIL.html  You mean the game Middleton was in foul trouble? He had 3 fouls in the 2nd quarter, so again no point at all   &gt;They idiotically didn't run anywhere near enough PnR actions with Giannis as the roll man. Not from the top, not side PnRs, etc. You have one of the most devastating slashing forward who can murder teams as the roll man, and they did little to exploit this. They're running much more of Giannis as the roll man this year.   Giannis was used as a roll man in 2.3 possessions last season, he's being used as a rolle man 2.4 possessions this season, again you're completely wrong and basically no adjustment was made, you're just spewing bs  https://go.nba.com/hfdj  https://go.nba.com/qed8"
"A guy, who while injured, went on a championship run taking down the reigning MVP, the Sixers with Jimmy Butler, and the Splash Brothers seems pretty good to me."
"the initial reports were wild... about Boogie, DeMar, and DeAndre spending all night in there and Jimmy Butler booking out a girl for a week, but ultimately, I think it ended up being a non-story once those reports were relatively debunked. Who knows though, might have just been a PR cover-up. Got some hilarious memes and pasta out of it though."
"The 2004 timberwolves went to the conference finals and won 2 games against the lakers who had Kobe, Shaq, Karl Malone and Gary Payton. If you add jimmy butler and KAT to that team, they sweep any real team"
"Yes. Baron Davis, I think, was on a podcast, maybe it was Gilbert, saying that the very same warriors you describe above had 3 luxurious (Ferrari) type cars parked outside his salary negotiations where he was a free agent and they said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre yours‚Äù.   Jimmy butler on the JJ reddick took home multiple expensive wine bottles ($20k?) at team dinners on the team card.  You think Cuban doesn‚Äôt give the boys a non-Mavs linked card to play with? Please."
Its gonna be surreal when he loses ... i guess it was surreal for jimmy butler too last year
"https://twitter.com/NBA_Math/status/1400808305086271495/photo/1  Here you go. This was the TPA for the first round (essentially BPM x minutes played), though it may have only been through 5 games.  Not a perfect stat by any means, but it illustrates the point. He was getting absolutely abused on defense by Austin fucking rivers and shot like shit on the other end too.   You can't compare the heat to us. The Heats other best players are Jimmy Butler and Bam, neither of whom can shoot. You can't play 3 shooters. Meanwhile the blazers post norm trade were one of the best shooting teams in league history - pretty much everyone in our 8 man rotation was a 40% 3 point shooter on high volume other than our 2 centers.   You can incorporate DJJ when you have Dame drawing 2 defenders from 30. You can't when spacing is at a premium because your two stars can't shoot. We should've been running Dame trapped --&gt; Nurk at the FT line --&gt; DJJ lob cutting in from the corner at least a few times a game"
"Okay since we know LeBron is almost the entire reason for this stat, the slightly more interesting stat to me is that this is the first time in 5 years that the leading scorer (in the playoffs) on either finals team, not both, has stayed with their 1st team.   2017 - Cavs LeBron vs. Warriors KD   2018 - Cavs LeBron vs. Warriors KD  2019 - Raptors Kawhi vs. Warriors KD   2020 - Lakers AD vs. Heat Jimmy Butler"

"Pippen led his team to a 54 win record and the second round as the #1 option. On like 23/6/6 with worse efficiency than his years with MJ.  He did something that at least 8 players do every year (make it to second round). Other players who have led their team to 50 wins and the second round as a #1 option include  DeMar DeRozan, Donovan Mitchell, Paul George, John Wall, Jimmy Butler, Jermaine O'Neal, Vince Carter, Carmelo Anthony, and Blake Griffin.   Before you say how Scottie finished 3rd for MVP that year, so did Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jermaine O'Neal, and Carmelo (2nd).  Meanwhile AI actually WON the MVP and led his team to 60 wins as the #1 guy. He was also universally viewed as a top 3 player from 1999 - 2003. Whereas Scottie was always in the second tier of the top 10 after guys like MJ, Robinson, Hakeem, Shaq, and Barkley."
"Yes, absolutely.   Imo Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons are the two biggest winners of these playoffs legacy-wise by escaping with **zero** finals losses!"
"There's almost zero argument for Pippen over Iverson. Are you kidding. Scottie is one of the best #2 guys ever, but that's all he was, a #2 guy.  Scottie is closer to Paul George and Jimmy Butler than AI."
Jimmy Butler was playing injured. He was out for 2 weeks for his back before playing. The Heat also didn't have Oladipo who was in their starting line up. People forget that the Nets without Harden were wiping the floor with the Bucks. Then Kyrie went down.
"Jimmy butler wasn‚Äôt injured the bucks swept them, Kevin Durant wasn‚Äôt injured the bucks won, trae young was playing and gannis wasn‚Äôt the bucks beat them, you just mad your heat got swept, anyway suns in 6"

"I see it more so the refs/nba gifted the heat the 06 title by making ridiculous calls, especially Wade. Fuck him and his bullshit ways of getting fouls called by jumping into players. The effects are still rippling through the nba today. Also, This did take place during the big ref scandal.   However, the '11 title made a lot of things right, or feel right.  Disclaimer: I've always disliked the heat going back to the mid 90s knicks heat playoff series.   Another thing: I like Jimmy Butler and that bubble ball heat team was fun. First time I can honestly say I pulled for them."
"The pelicans also matched up pretty bad against the wolves too. The wolves had swept the pelicans (4-0) that season and Jimmy Butler always tore them apart. Not to mention the Jazz always gave the pelicans a fit due to Gobert.   Now if pelicans were in the East, they could have made the finals for sure."
"I think you're overreacting a little about how good/bad Butler is in terms of top whatever players, but you brought up some good points. I do agree he is overrated tho.   Like you touched on the fact that he shot much better in the bubble. No one ever brings up that Jimmy was one of the worst high volume mid range shooters in the league last season, but he gets into the bubble and suddenly becomes an elite mid range shooter. That diversified his offensive game much more than in the regular season."
"The Bucks Heat series really exposed how limited of a player Jimmy Butler is offensively and basically shut down any narrative of him being a superstar or a top 10 let alone 15, 20, and arguably 25 player in the league"

"You know, I think Jimmy butler himself said he sees a lot of himself in Devin Booker. Cp3 is just a pure team guy these days"

"The Butler hate in here is getting a little ridiculous. Some dude said he's barely a top 15 player, like that's an insult? Basically the top 10 spots are held by hall of fame locks still playing. 10-20 is elite caliber players that may not have the accolades or overrall team to shine brighter. Butler makes whatever team he is on better and a playoff contender.   Also people out here shitting on Butler for not winning rings. You guys have any idea how hard it is to win a ring? Its been golden state, LeBron, or Kawhi for like the past decade. Charles Barkley hopped teams to, was a bit of an asshole, never won shit, and people suck him off in here daily and he's a HoFer (I love Chuck too).   Respect Jimmy Butler people."
"Off the top of my head, Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and Jimmy Butler were at the end of the first, Devin Booker 13th, Giannis mid-first.  Just gotta have a really good scouting department and trust them."
I could see Jimmy Butler as Brazilian
I'm a die-hard heat fan but I'm a basketball fan first Meaning I'm not a heat fan that thinks everything is great even when it sucks I tell it like it is whether good or bad anyways this guy Keith Pompeii who said the SO-CALLED PROCESS in Philly is/was a failure is so right he's So ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY CORRECT and the reason he's correct is because Philly hasn't done anything yes they went to the conference finals they made the playoffs but guess what the players don't give a shit about that they want to get to the finals and that's something Philly hasn't done and as long as you have Simmons on your team Philly will never get to the finals and BTW if you would've kept the Other man who has a lion's killer instinct and a work ethic second to none who will  go to war with and for his teammates this man's name is Jimmy Butler but Philly chose to keep soft ass Ben Simmons who can't shoot the fucking ball and won't do what it takes in the off season to get better. Ben Simmons is softer than Donald Drumpf hahaha many a times I've seen Ben Simmons toe to toe with a player backing up and letting the other players take care of it because he's such a candy ass. Anyways from the Miami heat fans to the Phillies fans thank you for Jimmy Butler now you can suffer with your Ben Simmons hahahaha. But there may be a chance he'll be gone.
"Jimmy Butler literally went on a podcast and said that Brett Brown was the reason he decided to leave the team.  And that was somewhat my point. Jimmy Butler being bought into the Sixers is viewed as a success of the process, while his leaving the team isn't, despite them both happening 2/3 years after Hinkie was fired and the Sixers stopped tanking."
Would you pay 35 year old Jimmy Butler 45+ million dollars especially when he‚Äôs a terrible fit for your two young stars?  Honest genuine question.
"Simmons and Butler don‚Äôt fit great, but you could always trade Simmons for a lot, and they can play together okay. The defense is actually great with them both on the court, and Simmons got out of the way enough to not be a detriment to Butler/Embiid on offense, even if he didn‚Äôt add value to the offense.   An underrated culprit of their failure against the Raptors is Tobias Harris. Jimmy created him so many wide open threes and he was just bricking wide open shots all series."
"Look at all the finalists from the past 10 years. Take out Lebrons superteams. You basically have teams built around guys that weren't drafted that high except for the 12' Thunder.   11' Mavs - Dirk (late lotto pick)  12' OKC - The original process. Three top 5 lotto picks   13'/14' Spurs - Best player on those teams was Kawhi (mid first pick), even though they still had Timmy D who was #1 pick. .   15'/16' Warriors - Two mid to late lotto picks (Steph and Klay)   17-19' Warriors - Same as above but with Durant.   19' Raptors - Built around Lowry, brought Kawhi in to take them to the promised land.   20' Miami - Built around Jimmy Butler and Adebayo, two guys who were not drafted high.   I think the way OKC is going is the way to ""tank"" and build a team. Just amass assets. Be somewhat competitive. Hopefully 2-3 of the dozens of picks they have hoarded turn into something."
"&gt; Jimmy to have more success than a few multi-round runs when they‚Äôve never been on super teams.  Was Butler, Embiid, Simmons, Harris not a loaded team? I appreciate that it was Simmons' second season and Embiids's post-All Star season, but that version of Simmons was better than the one today. That's quite the solid team."
"Butler is only 1 of 7 players since he‚Äôs been in the league to be the best player on a finals team. An 8th one will join him once the Bucks/Hawks series concludes, but before Butler did it, LeBron, Curry, Duncan, Kawhi, and KD were the only other players to hold that honor. Leading a finals team is a lot rarer than people make it out to be.   I don‚Äôt know why people expect guys like Jimmy to have more success than a few multi-round runs when they‚Äôve never been on super teams."
Jimmy Butler has made it to more finals these last two years than Philly has in the last 20 years.
"Butler wanted out and made it to the finals with a worse team the year after he left. The year after that Jimmy played like absolute shit in the playoffs. Weird things happen and I think it‚Äôs really difficult to say what would‚Äôve happened had we say kept Jimmy and gotten rid of Tobi.  I didn‚Äôt want Jimmy to leave and honestly didn‚Äôt think he would. I have no negative feelings towards him after hearing the full story, but he seems like almost as much of a head case as Simmons."
"The goal was to win the championship, or more accurately to build a team that could win the championship. Embiid played MVP caliber this year and Butler led a team to the finals last year, there is no doubt that should be a big time championship contender every year, especially with the extra two Top 50 caliber players they had to add to their two All NBA guys.  The process is a success in that it built them a championship roster, even with the blunders of the Colangelo/Brown years, which are a series of pissing away all the wealth gathered during the process. From getting rid of a draft pick to move up 2 picks in the draft, wasting a No. 1 pick on Fultz, trading Mikal Bridges, and then losing Jimmy Butler because you decided you should build around guys that played worse than him in the 2019 playoffs.  The failure of the Sixers is from what happened after The Process / Hinkie. The Tobias Harris trade is generally marked as the end of the process as that‚Äôs when the Sixers had cashed in all their major trade chips, but the decay was already there with the 2017 and 2018 draft blunders.   The process is such a success that they were so asset rich that they are still a fringe contender after pissing away an All NBA player."
"&gt; The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time  They should hang this in the rafters"
"Butler and Embiid were and still are friends. Embiid was depressed at the start of last season. Sixers front office did him dirty and got rid of all of his friends (Jimmy, JJ, and TJ)."
"Because now more than ever we see guys push through the ceilings we try to put on them. Look at Giannis when he came into the league, borderline unplayable, now he‚Äôs a guaranteed 1st ballot HOFer and he‚Äôs only 26. Pascal Siakam went from raw gangly rebounder to 2nd option on a chip team and All-NBA 2nd team. Late bloomers like Lowry or Jimmy Butler went from role players to legitimate all-stars. Even 5 years into Julius Randle career, no one would‚Äôve said he‚Äôd ever make all-star and all-nba 2nd team but look what he just did. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to put a ceiling on someone who‚Äôs going to be in the NBA for 15+ years and constantly developing their game."
"The Sixers had Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Jimmy Butler, and Joel Embiid on the same team all at the same time. The process was a resounding success. That was even after burning assets like Mikal Bridges and the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft.  Getting rid of Butler is the big mistake (in addition to the Fultz pick), but that happened post process. If they kept Butler, you have Butler, Harris, and Embiid which is a great big 3, and could have used Ben Simmons in trades more aggressively."
"&gt; By your definition of problematic to build around, every player is problematic to build around.  Yes? There are very few players in the league at a time that aren't challenging to build a contender around, that's factually true. By ""build,"" I mean build a team that can win a title, not just a good playoff team.   &gt;But, I mean, LaVine has never even made the playoffs and is worse on both ends of the court than KAT.   KAT's made the playoffs once, as the 8 seed, largely off the back of Jimmy Butler. Lavine just put up 27/5/5 on 63.4% TS as a shooting guard. KAT's career year was 26/11/4 on 64.2% TS.  They're comparable offensive players, and Lavine's defense is about a billion times easier to scheme around. I'd rather take that."
This is the same organization that paid a 0 time all-star player 5 years 180 million in Tobias Harris and paid a fundamentally flawed player 5 years 177 million in Ben Simmons.   I think he has them over a barrell in negotiations. They either pay him or are forced to trade him. The supermax gives all parties clarity.   No one stays once the team refuses to pony up the supermax. See Jimmy Butler and Demarcus Cousins.
I like Brogdon but he is an injury risk. Plus I don‚Äôt know if he takes you up to championship team level. I think the type of player philly needs is jimmy butler whom they are not getting. So the next best thing is demare derozan or kyle lowry. If they could get zach lavine he would be a good fit as well (like murray-joker pair). I don‚Äôt think you can win with sexton or the other names out there. It will be hard to convince people to trade a young asset for an old one but they may get draft picks and young players with derozan or lowry packages.
"No one in the league can guard Durant 1 on 1. Basing whether a player is a good defender  based off of guarding KD or not is pretty dumb. Giannis locked up jimmy butler in the first round after not guarding him last year when he went off. Besides, giannis is a better help defender anyway."
I mean he shut down Trae and jimmy butler. KD Isn‚Äôt stoppable that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt giannis‚Äôs talent. Like wtf stop being bitter
"Definitely the players still dealing with the plague.  You can show the aftermath, House Mavs and Heat on fire, white walkers running around, their castles partially destroyed, Jimmy Butler trying to fend them off with 2 G-Realm peasants, the muffin maker's boy, and a mangy goat but succumbing to their onslaught.  You could have a recurring joke where Giannis and Khris Middleton charge into battle, only to be pulled by Bud 30 seconds later and sent to the showers.  Every time House Bucks are going to win, they get pulled.  Trae Young and Embiid trying to out flop each other, falling down when the other coughs or something ridiculous like that, maybe a cameo by perennial flopper Manu Ginobili coming back and showing them both how its done.  Discord in House Jazz where Gobert and Mitchell don't get along, the former still touching stuff while clearly infected, but denied it saying its just a cold or something.  Lamelo and Lavar orchestrating a coup to take over House Hornets, maybe with Lonzo in the background asking his dad if he's still proud of him but Lavar ignoring him and holding the ROY trophy.  Meanwhile Liangelo is pulling the carriage that Lavar came in.  House Knicks with a resurgence but they wildly overreact and are smug like they're already champions while everyone reminds them they've sucked for years.  Meanwhile Thibs players his guys no matter what.  Arrows could be stuck in Julius Randle's back and Thibs will say he looks fine and to keep fighting."
Jimmy Butler in that 1 finals game where he went particularly nuclear
Ahh yes perennial best player and reigning NBA champion Jimmy Butler. Got me there
Yes we should hold LeBron and Jimmy Butler to the same standard. Amazing point
Must mean Jimmy Butler is still a top 5 player in the world too
How tf you got Jimmy Butler before KG??
Jimmy Butler.
"If I‚Äôm considering possible movements, regression, and injuries I have East Guards | Zach LaVine, Trae Young, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Lonzo Ball, Bradley Beal, Collin Sexton East Forwards | Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Bam Adebayo East Replacements/Snubs | LaMelo Ball, Cade Cunningham, Domantas Sabonis, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Caris LeVert, Julius Randle West Guards | Stephen Curry, Donovan Mitchell, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, De‚ÄôAaron Fox, Devin Booker West Forwards | Nikola Jokic, LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Karl-Anthony Towns, Paul George West Replacements/Snubs | Chris Paul, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr,  Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Rudy Gobert  Hopefully I‚Äôm not forgetting anyone"
"Kings fan here and actually thinking about writing a post.   Context  It‚Äôs important to remember that the Kings are in the Pacific Division (Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, and Kings) plus also in the Western Conference (TrailBlazers, Jazz, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Thunder, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Mavericks, Spurs, and Rockets), so they have to be GOOD. Like 4th through 7th seed good in the East (Atlanta, NY, Boston, Miami GOOD).  Plan  Advanced Stats wise Fox is low level all star good, but no Trae Young/Jimmy Butler/Tatum and while his shooting has improved he‚Äôs more of a 1 3PT made a game guy than 5. So we HAVE to win with Defense and Playmaking, as long as Fox is our main guy.  Maybe a hot take but I think Halliburton makes an all star team before Fox and usurps him by his 3rd year, but either way the game plan has to be let Halliburton run the offense and use Fox as a Wide Receiver with his speed while they share the court. Delon Wright/Buddy/Justin James/Terrance Davis off the bench for the 3rd guard spot.  Forward-wise older Harrison Barnes, promising Robert Woodard, and our likely SF draft pick (Franz Wagner) give us enough coverage at 3 to not get crushed by better Small Forwards. But we really fall apart at the big man spots (PF/C) with only Marvin Bagley as our only under contract player.  This is where it looks hopeless. Even Bagley believers think that his only value is returning a late 1st and getting his $11M salary off the books. In Monty‚Äôs shoes I move him via waive if we can‚Äôt get a 2nd rounder and free up his cap space. Once we have that $11M back, we can sign one off Holmes back/Daniel Thesis/Otto Porter Jr. to fill a PF or C spot, bring back Metu/Jones to give back up C minutes, and use our Midlevel to sign Bismack Biyambo or Dwight Howard.  From there it‚Äôs all about the entire 9 man rotation committing to running down the opposing teams shot clock every possession and using Fox‚Äôs athleticism to get in front of every fast break."
I know my fellow fans would disagree but I would LOVE to see this man beside Jimmy butler. He‚Äôs not on the radar at all for Pat I‚Äôm sure but this kid is a certified DOG
Heat and Raptors had Kawhi/Gasol and Jimmy Butler/Bam
He joins Jimmy Butler and 4 other random guys
How about Jimmy Butler for the Heat with the Heat Miser haircut
"&gt;I did notice in games without Butler Bam kinda disappeared and lacked an aggressive playstyle  I mean he averaged 19/9/6 in games without Jimmy, which is right where his season averages were."
He outscored jimmy butler vs y‚Äôall. You guys shouldn‚Äôt be talking
With Jimmy Butler.
"Wiggin's doesn't even like basketball, he is what he is. Jimmy Butler hated that about him. When you have talent and are in the top league, and you don't even work to maximize what you have."
"So Melo, Mourning, Detroit AI, Jimmy Butler and Gilbert Arenas and Billups were/are a superstar, but Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Deron Williams and Donavon Mitchell aren't and never were. Gotcha."
&gt; He lost the team well before the beginning of the year two seasons ago.      These quotes are from May 2019:   https://www.phillyvoice.com/sixers-stars-joel-embiid-ben-simmons-jimmy-butler-defend-brett-brown-job-security-rumors-swirl/
&gt;3rd stringers  jimmy butler may have had an advantage all along in that infamous wolves practice‚Ä¶
I mean LeBron is [one of the clutchest players in the NBA](https://www.nbcsports.com/national/lebron-james-jimmy-butler-among-10-most-clutch-players-nba). You probably don't want him shooting free throws in crunch time but you should trust him over pretty much every active player to take the last shot.
"Well, the third-stringers of a Jimmy Butler-led team are indeed spooky"
"Maybe I should have said when comparing to recent Team USA rosters.ompared to the likes of Tyson Chandler, Kobe, CP3, Jimmy Butler, Paul George"
"Is it a stretch to call Wiggins the best one on one defender this year? Like just going off your thing, opponent FG%, he played 71/72 games, guarding the best wing/guard on the opposing team every single night(guys like Jimmy butler, Tatum, LeBron, kd, beal, dame, kawhi, middleton, Mitchell, siakam, lavine, CJ, derozan, and more...) and he held these players, on average, to 38% from the field?! Like I know it's a bold claim, but Wiggins dominates in this 1 on 1 defensive stat, and judging by the eye test(I saw about 60 warriors games live) he was fantastic too. He moves his feet like kawhi on defense, is underratedly strong, rarely got blown by, and even when he did, he was probably the best wing shot blocker in the league.  Wiggins was so damn good defensively this year. It'd always put a smile on my face to see Wiggins contest a shot because it felt like when he did, opponents would never score it. And with oFG%, we can see that my visual assessment was confirmed with stats as well."
They need to call up Jimmy Butler or something
Why tf isnt Jimmy Butler on this team
"just about zero percent.  the league is much more saturated now than back then and as time goes on the answer approaches closer to zero.   these are not mailmen, plumbers, milkmen taking a career shift. many of these athletes are feed cocktails (e.g. hgh) to enhance their development from young age and groomed and dedicated to the sport.  the younger you start and the effort you dedicate will often translate into more success, there are natural talent limitations but time and effort and bridge some of these gaps over others who invest less effort but more natural talent; jimmy butler is classic example.  the framework has been know.    peace and long life!"
Jimmy Butler was the best player on KATs only playoff appearance.
Well yeah...  but jimmy butler literally took kats team to their only playoffs in like 20 years.
Well Jimmy Butler swooped in right after to replace Rose and he probably would not have blossomed if not for the added opportunity
"Luka, Jokic, Dame, Jimmy Butler, Zion"
"When Rose got hurt Jimmy Butler had played 42 games and scored 109 points, and had 0 starts as a rookie as the 30th overall pick  I am not saying he was bad, but he didnt see the court with Rose as his MVP level much. We never saw what could have been"
"I mean, they were still good after that. If they had just not had any good players after Rose's injury, then sure, but they still had Jimmy Butler, a great coach, and were/are an iconic franchise from a city that produced a bunch of elite basketball talent, so they had the hometown lure.  They were in a perfectly fine position post-Rose. They just fucked up."
"Prime Ron Artest was Jimmy Butler before Jimmy Butler. Lockdown defender and could give you buckets on the other end.   Also while Yao was out for most of the series, he was instrumental in the game 1 win."
"He isn't that close lol... CP3's like a fringe top 15 guy and Giannis is arguably top 5.  They're both elite players obviously, but like Giannis is inarguably better, by a wide margin. That's like saying Jimmy Butler and Embiid are close"
"Maybe a bit biased, but I don't like Dwayne Wade ever since he used the Bulls for a final payday and caused a massive riff in the locker room. At the end of January, Dwade convinced Jimmy to collectively throw the young players under the bus in a post game press conference.  Rajon Rondo, being an understanding vet went off on Dwade on Instagram, all three faced fines and the young players jumped on twitter to defend themselves. The Bulls went on a massive downward losing swing after this. Then around March, after Dwade got hurt, the Bulls led by Rajon Rondo, Jimmy B, and the young players went on a run to secure the 8th seed. Bulls take 2-0 lead against the Celtics on the road behind Rondo, Paul Zipser, Jimmy Butler, and Bobby Portis. Rondo breaks his thumb and misses the rest of the series, Dwade plays like absolute trash. We eventually Lose 4-2 to Celtics. Jimmy is traded, Rajon was waived, and Dwade was bought out. The bulls haven't won more than 27 games since until this season where we won 31."
" Booker is definitely top 20 but out of Jayson Tatum, Zion Williamson, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns, Donovan Mitchell, Bradley Beal, Rudy Gobert, and Chris Paul, is Booker definitely ahead of 7 of these players?"
Because she's black but if you post about jimmy butler sleeping with Rachel it gets removed.
He probably would have left them on Jimmy butler terms
He‚Äôd probably get as frustrated as Jimmy Butler on that team and go ape shit in practice
"He‚Äôs also not better than Julius Randle, Jaylen Brown, Trae Young, Westbrook, AD, Lavine, Vucevic, Kemba, McCollum, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Kawhi, Shai Gilgeous Alexander."
If Jimmy butler doesn‚Äôt go to Miami that‚Äôs a top 5 pick probably
The Jimmy Butler trade to Minnesota didn't work out for either team.
"He is an awesome player who can play a strong role on a championship team or be the best player on a mid level team. I have not yet seen him be the best player on a contender, but Jimmy Butler, Kawhi Leonard and others  have built themselves up to that point."
"Brynn Forbes outscored Jimmy Butler in the series.  Anyone who's watched Giannis in these playoffs wouldn't hold the position you do lol. Every question from the last few years has been answered.  I mean what more can he do. Hes averaging like 30/14/5 in the playoffs. Hes had 1 bad playoff game the entire playoffs.  Hes making fadeaways, turn around jumpers. He scored 20 fucking points in a quarter in the Finals. Just a week after hyperextending his knee.  Hell never be a great free throw shooter. But yesterday his free throws made intentionally fouling him still better offense than the #1 offense in thr league in points per possesion. The Nets led the league with 1.17 ppp. Giannis at the line yesterday was scoring 1.22."
"How'd game 6 go for the heat? If I remember correctly LBJ and AD were celebrating winning it all with like 10 minutes left in the game with butler at 12 pts and -18. As for the FGA point who was the 1st option on the 2017 warriors? Who was the 1st option on the 2018 warriors? If you're telling me that KD was the 3rd option on the 2017 warriors im going to have to HARD disagree cause come crunch time I know whose getting the ball. I never made a claim that one was better than the other either but you can put those words in my mouth if it makes you feel good, happy to bring someone who seems so miserable a little joy. Basketball is very much a what can you do for me right now sport and people saw this year jimmy not doing much for them I don't know why you wouldnt expect people to claim jrue was better it doesn't make it true but it's not like it's COMPLETELY unreasonable is all I'm saying man."
"&gt; as the third option jrue only averaged three less points  Hey buddy. You should maybe check how many field goals each of these guys attempted per game. Literally .3 apart LMFAO. Fuck outta here. They‚Äôre taking the same amount of shots a game this season.   yes and the people calling jimmy bad now are forgetting he dropped a 40 pt triple double in the finals last year and judging it completely off of just 4 games this year.   You are literally crying about how people are using recency bias for jrue while you are simultaneously doing it for jimmy, be better.  And once again I‚Äôm not saying jrues shit, or bad at all. He‚Äôs not better than Butler"
We actually got a first round pick and moe Harkless(who eventually got traded for mook) just for existing essentially during the Jimmy butler signing
"1) Collangelo was gone by the time Jimmy Butler was on the team, that was Brett Brown/Elton Brand. The same duo that traded Richaun Homes for nothing. The fact that you don‚Äôt know this tells me you don‚Äôt follow the Sixers very closely, if at all   2) Holding one of Okafor and Nerlens made sense because Embiid was hurt. One of them, ideally Nerlens would have (and still is honestly) a great backup for Joel.   3) Once again, Hinkie was removed before he was even able to trade either of those guys. He also did a stellar job trading MCW and other players from the Sixers during the process, so saying he couldn‚Äôt shape a quality team is a stretch. He found great players like Covington, Grant, and Wood that wouldn‚Äôt have had a shot on any other team and now those guys, along with a few others, are still in the NBA today.   Hinkie was a great GM. He also worked with Daryl Morey on the Rockets, another great GM."
He's an above average defender and good playmaker. He can run an offense as the primary ball handler. Like you said career high 5.4apg shows he is a good playmaker.   He's just a good all around player and has zero major weaknesses. He's closer to a Jimmy Butler archetype than he is to a CJ Mccollum.
But I was told Jimmy Butler was a good leader and Andrew Wiggins was weak
"Yes. Harden hasn‚Äôt only lost to the warriors. He‚Äôs also lost to the champion lakers and a 67 win spur team. And again, saying giannis is better because he‚Äôs in the finals completely ignores the circumstances both players had to go through on their way there.   Is Jimmy butler better than Tracy mcgrady? Better than harden? The logic just doesn‚Äôt apply consistently"
"Better than steph Curry, worse than Jimmy butler."
Fuck Jimmy Butler
"Watching Jimmy Butler and LeBron trade buckets at the end of game 5 was pretty fucking excellent especially with the meme of Jimmy Butler getting tired at the end but yeah can a lot of those instances the other guys team-mates just didn't show up, I feel bad for LeBron in 2018 though, Kevin Durant's my favorite player so I was happy to see him when the chip but even though I knew Cleveland didn't have a chance that series, LeBron went to fuck off in that game and unfortunately we know how regulation ended and it ruined a masterpiece smh"
They did look for real with Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick though
After they swept us I remember they were saying Jrue Holiday is better than jimmy Butler
"Middleton is fine, he's had some huge games, they need a third guy that can take over at times and Holliday isn't that guy.  Chris Paul could have been that guy.  If they could have swung Jimmy Butler, he could have been that guy.  They just need a third consistent scorer."
"By that logic you could say Jimmy Butler isn't a star lmao. Jrue is a star for his two way play, not exclusively one side of the ball or the other. He's just inconsistent like Middleton"
"Nah, didn't guard Jimmy Butler. Take it away."
"0-4, bryn forbes outscored jimmy locked in butler"
She's free right now with Jimmy Butler
Kuzma shut down Jimmy Butler? What series were you watching?
"Jimmy Butler has 2 of the best 3 NBA Finals game scores, so should probably include him.  Mikal Bridges is a sneaky one. He wins a championship on average every 2 years and does it by letting other players shine on offense, scoring efficiently when he gets his chance, and playing defense."
Jimmy Butler
Racel Nichols living her best life with Jimmy Butler in the skybox rn
"Jimmy Butler is just a bit role by Jamie Fox, change my view."
"You cant teach athleticism you can teach basic skills and fundamentals. There are a million players who come into the draft super raw and develop over time just look at Jimmy butler , westbrook , giannis , etc."
"And unless they decide to trade 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029 picks for‚Ä¶ who? KAT? Butler? Who might conceivably want out that McCollum and picks for would move the needle? I only say Jimmy because that‚Äôs been floated a little bit.  I guess Simmons would improve the defense, but they lose offense there, and their spacing gets so much worse, and Nurkic took 30 3‚Äôs last year, not sure you can play those two together.  I guess if it turned out the jazz wanted a change they could do nurkic and picks for Gobert but I don‚Äôt think the jazz are in that position. I‚Äôm just spitballing here, but I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a move to make. When you have $74 million owed to two guards under 6‚Äô3 next year and they aren‚Äôt Klay and Steph it‚Äôs really hard to be a top tier team"
Did Jimmy Butler call Rachel?
We also need Nick Mullen as Rachel Nichols for the entire time talking about  getting plowed Jimmy Butler
"Why? Do the bulls get credit for jimmy butler, or the pacers for Paul George? Just because a player improves doesn‚Äôt mean they were molded by an organization, and especially not by just one guy."
Jimmy Butler is a total prick.
I would swap Julius Randle for Jimmy Butler. I dont see him having another career year.
"I berated that bitch for, like, two straight hours! I mean, really personal stuff. Way over the line! The kind of stuff that cuts you to the core, you know? He held it together without a single tear. Dude, when our 1on1 was up he cried for a month straight. Every day, crying all day long. It was... depressing. Yeah, it was really sad. He talked about taking too many pills. I think he tried to kill himself. He did, he did. I saw it, but I didn't tell you about it.  \- jimmy butler"

"There isn‚Äôt a trade package out there that would be worth it for OKC, what he‚Äôs done in the playoffs at the age of 20-21 tell all you need to know about the caliber of player he will grow into.  I guess you *could* **maybe** make the argument that they would trade SGA for the 1st or 2nd pick in this next draft but they absolutely don‚Äôt need more picks they need more players, expect OKC to make a trade for a top 20 player like Jimmy Butler-Minnesota, not trading away a potential superstar that has impressed so much at the age of 21."
Jimmy Butler didn‚Äôt watch
"The little details in there about people being scared of Butler and Butler taunting about busting his ass, and the little tidbit about Butler winning the game of 1 on 1 makes me about 95% sure the source for this part was Jimmy Butler."
"&gt; ‚ÄúCrowder was maybe the only player on Miami‚Äôs roster with the courage, bravado, and shared history ‚Äî from their year together at Marquette ‚Äî to confront Jimmy Butler when he felt it necessary,‚Äù wrote ESPN‚Äôs Zach Lowe. ‚ÄúA prolonged series of one-on-one games between them was perhaps Miami‚Äôs secret defining moment of last season‚Äôs bubble run.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe two had started trash-talking during five-on-five action in practice toward the end of the seeding games. It got heated, and they cleared the court to settle it with a series of one-on-one games that lasted somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour. The player with the ball had to start either on the wing or at the top of the key, and could take only a certain number of dribbles before shooting.  &gt; ‚ÄúThe trash talk became so profane, and so personal, it was borderline uncomfortable, team sources said. Almost the entire Heat contingent stayed to watch. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been busting your a‚Äì since school!‚Äô Butler taunted, according to Crowder. (It got much worse than that.) Everyone loved it ‚Äî and appreciated Crowder for bringing an edge to practices. (Butler won the final game.)‚Äù"
"You‚Äôre looking at career instead of their peak seasons. Jordan‚Äôs top 2 scoring seasons were above 40% followed by another of 44%  Dwayne Wade had three of his best seasons when his FTR was well above 55%.   Hell, even for current guards, Jimmy Butler FTR is 63% since he‚Äôs been in Miami, and yet I never hear him complained about."
I remember when Nene put Jimmy Butler in a headlock during game 3 and got suspended for game 4 lmao
Jimmy Butler
I once saw Jimmy Butler walking around with a steel chair
"This happens every playoffs. GSW had Durant and Livingston, Toronto had Kawhi, Miami had Jimmy Butler doing it last year, and now the Suns with CP3 and Booker. Sometimes, the mid-range is the best shot available because the defense has taken away the other shots or made them difficult, and you need players on your team capable of making them."
Just cause you don't like his playstyle doesn't mean the man isn't a superstar the fuck?  Harden in 2019 still averaged the most ppg without free throws   Harden in that stretch without KD this year averaged 29/10/11. He wasn't even top 5 in FT this year including being below Jimmy Butler and I never hear anything about how Jimmy flops or shit
Since when is Jimmy Butler the arbiter of truth üòÇ they just didnt mesh well as teammates because jimmy is a flaming asshole
Word is that Jimmy Butler found himself in the Team USA facility
Mavs: Jimmy Butler
"NBA Twitter only likes her because she‚Äôs hot. You should see the alleged, how would you say,encounters she had with Jimmy Butler and Ersan Ilyasova"
This guy was a centerpiece of a Jimmy butler trade.   Thibodeau sucks as a gm
Did Jimmy Butler fuck Rachel? when did this all comeout? I must of missed it.
Klay or Jimmy Butler could be good in Chuck's role too. Kobe would've been good but RIP.
"Shooting and defending will most definitely make the hawks better, especially if he is able to do it more consistently. If you can shoot and defend well for 7 games straight, you can win a series. And If long-term investments wouldn‚Äôt work then players like Jimmy Butler, Brandon Ingram, Giannis, and other hard-working slow-to-come-along players wouldn‚Äôt have a place in the NBA."
Idk but we need that Rachel Nichols and Jimmy butler tape
"Correct. He‚Äôs soft as seen on tv, as told by Jimmy Butler, and as shown by the yearly losses."
It's hard to get over it when you go from Jimmy Butler/Goran Dragic --&gt; Harden/Blake --&gt; Trae/Lou Will --&gt; Booker/Paul all in one playoff run.
Jimmy Butler does ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
"I don't think rigged, or Adam Silver making a call or conspiracy stuff like that - I think it was just a regular case of human fallibility. I think I'm also a little frustrated by it because a lot of the calls in the Brooklyn series, especially Game 7, were *extremely* frustrating. Despite scoring from the restricted area more than any other team that got past the first round, we've been bottom on FTA per FGA by a reasonable amount counting all the playoff teams. Middleton is about the only player willing to flop for the calls, so when after playing series against Jimmy Butler, KD/Harden, Trae Young and now CP3, when he doesn't get those whistles it's maddening."
I dont think ive seen a Bulls fan here who doesn't simp for Jimmy butler.  Until now
"&gt;Twitter must be your source of truth. Anyway, it doesn‚Äôt make me think because how does it even affect the fact that Jimmy labeled KAT as lazy. Whoever Jimmy nails doesn‚Äôt change the reality that KAT is lazy and soft.   Jimmy Butler must be your source of truth."
"The Bulls use a territorial pick to add Dwyane Wade, then use another territorial pick to pair him with Andre Iguodala, then use a territorial pick to add Derrick Rose, then draft Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the draft, before drafting Anthony Davis with a territorial pick the next season."
"They're both FA, Miami don't need to offer anything.   Kyle Lowry, Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, PF?, Bam Adebayo."
"I loved the Jimmy Butler - LeBron James shootout in Game 5 of the 2020 NBA Finals. 35-point triple double from Butler, 42-point near triple double (only 7 assists) from James.  I have a three other favorites from way back in the 80s and 90s:  Larry Bird - Dominique Wilkins in Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals.  Bird finished with 34 points, 20 in the fourth quarter. Wilkins finished with 47 points, 19-of-23 from the field.  Michael Jordan - Charles Barkley in Game 2 of the 1993 Finals. Michael Jordan had 42 points, 12 rebounds, and 9 assists. Charles Barkley had 42 points and 13 rebounds.  Michael Jordan - Charles Barkley in Game 4 of the 1993 Finals. Michael Jordan had 55 points. Charles Barkley had a 32-point triple double."
You know who else are great players Jimmy Butler and Chris Paul. And how well did they play against the Bucks defense. There was a likely chance Kyrie would have met the same fate as them if he played further in the series.  Let the Bucks fans have their win and just wait until next year's playoffs to settle any questions.
&gt; Jimmy Butler is also very good-looking.  even tho he look like a tiki mask?
"It was a mistake because Ben wasn't the guy pushing the team over the top. Jimmy Buckets and Embiid were the clear key guys and JJ leaving for nothing also hurt the overall balance of the team.  Ben was/is a defensive specialist in the playoffs and Kawhi averaged 35 PPG. It wasn't Ben's defence on Kawhi that got the Sixers to 7, it was the overall team defence on the rest of the Raptors that made it happen IMO. Ben is a part of that though.  If anything, the playoffs proved that the only truly max guys on the Sixers were Embiid and Jimmy Butler. Nobody else was and is, to this day. The Sixers should have had the tough convo with Ben to say 'you're not a max guy if you can't do x,y,z' and if he still thinks of himself as a max guy, the Sixers could have traded him at peak value. I think at that time the Sixers had a lot of assets, and cap but it was spent on the wrong guys.  Gobert is DPOY though, not just all-defence 1st team. Ben hasn't reached that level. They both have their struggles but like I mentioned, a center is more fundamental to a good defence. You have a higher floor with a DPOY C than an all-NBA 1st team wing. That's where that extra value emerges. I think around 25 mil is probably where you'd want to have Ben Simmons' contract."
can confirm  we signed Al Horford and traded Jimmy Butler for Josh Richardson to piss off Embiid.  Also let JJ walk  It's a miracle he hasn't asked out already.
"I'm a hetero female, and I think Kevin Love is HOT. Jimmy Butler is also very good-looking. Kelly Oubre comes up on these lists a lot, but he's a little too ""pretty"" for my tastes."
"The team doesn‚Äôt have a leader. The team desperately needed a guy like Jimmy Butler to call other people out on their shit. None of these guys are that guy. Draymond is there, but he‚Äôs too busy recruiting guys to call guys out for playing like ass."
"They were definitely a contender last season.  The only thing is, I'm not sure if they were considered one when Gallinari signed in Atlanta.  But that doesn't take in player mentality. For all we know Demar thinks he is the difference between a fringe playoff team and a contender. Jimmy Butler did and he was right, with a little help from a bubble."
"Jimmy Butler, and Jrue Holiday.  Holiday would be a really good co-star."
"Giannis is a good one.  I feel like Jimmy Butler, or Jrue Holiday form a great pairing."
LMAO!   Rachael down bad.  Seriously though she has had a rough stretch from the Maria Taylor comments and the Jimmy Butler bubble rumor.
I say Jimmy butler of Paul George.
lmao Jimmy Butler as Lanky Kong  Minny pettiness is so much more fun then Boston pettiness
"i mean he's written books about rankings, makes sense why his mindset would be like that.   But does it really matter for average fans, outside of the top stars like Lebron, Steph, KD, Harden, etc? Like do Heat fans care wether Jimmy Butler is ranked top 10-15, especially when he lead their team to the finals last year? the rankings outside of the very top players don't matter that much.  The very top players can affect the game more, but outside of that, the roster construction matters way more than where the star player is ranking"
That 2017 night when y‚Äôall got Jimmy Butler was the last one I could think that lived up to the hype
"Jimmy Butler with his size, strength and shot making ability. Kyrie or Westbrook for their super fast drives and hang time around the rim"
"NBA refs are biased towards stars. Please, I beg you, please stop denying that. Jimmy Butler couldn't average more than 15 points if there was no touch foul in the NBA."
"https://youtu.be/ciKdF97JWpU  Around 7:00 mark.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.libertyballers.com/platform/amp/2019/9/5/20847564/source-jimmy-butler-would-have-stayed-for-a-max-sixers-uninterested  Most of the articles stating the the 76ers offering him a max contract came after the fact Jimmy already agreed with Miami. 76ers didn‚Äôt want to look cheap and stated that they did, but was turned down."
Inb4 jimmy butler tells lebron he's too soft and doesnt work hard enough.
Steph/CP3/Jrue Harden/Jimmy Butler Kawhi/PG13 Lebron/KD/Draymond AD/Bam   6th Man: KD
"&gt; Josh Richardson was acquired by the Philadelphia Sixers in exchange for Jimmy Butler and the draft rights to Mathias Lessort. Hassan Whiteside was acquired by the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Maurice Harkless and Meyers Leonard. Maurice Harkless, the draft rights to Mathias Lessort and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own) were acquired by the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for cash. Jimmy Butler, Meyers Leonard and cash were acquired by the Miami Heat in exchange for Josh Richardson, Hassan Whiteside and a conditional 2023 1st round pick (MIA own)."
inb4 Lebron and AD take their talents to south beach and join Jimmy butler
"this team USA would be better off losing early so we get kicked in the ass and get a foolproof wake up call that this team dogwater.       Need to cut out deadweight players such as Lillard, Booker, Lavine, Javale McGee, Keldon Johnson and replace team with players that can playmake or actually give a shit like Trae, Zion, Jimmy Butler, Westbrook, or Steph       Also Popovich and Floyd Pierce can take their return flights to the States right now really. Get a real coach like Coach K from Duke or Steve Kerr in"
"I think the big issue with the current team is that there are too many pure scorers and you can‚Äôt just pick the 12 best eligible players to make the team.  This would be my team. I think it‚Äôs a good mix of scoring, passing, size, defense and experience.  Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Zion Williamson, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo, Myles Turner"
"Doesn't really make alot of sense what you are saying. Guys with only one year left have lower value than guys with multiple years.  Ex. Kawhi Trade, PG trade to OKC, Chris Paul trade to Suns, Jimmy Butler to Sixers  All these guys had one year left on their contract, so they were traded for okay packages but nothing crazy"
Khris Middleton underrated.. cmon. Real ones know opposing teams are worried   Jimmy Butler may be on the opposite side on a consistent scoring production perspective of being passive in my eyes
"I'll never forget the Cavs fan I saw saying they had a chance to get both Paul George and Jimmy Butler, with Love going to the Pacers and the GOAT trade package for Butler"
Yes Jimmy Butler has never been good outside of the Bubble or played basketball before 2020 for that matter
"Miami or Philly. I feel like him and Bam complement each other‚Äôs game so well, and they Miami would have enough cap to get some good depth and S5 power around those two if they let go of guys like Jimmy Butler, Gordon Dragic, and Trevor Ariza they could even get a lot more. A starting 5 I think would push the heat up top would be this  PG-Malcom Brogdan SG-Bradley Beal SF-Davis Bertans PF-Bam Adebeyo C-Brook Lopez"
I‚Äôd say Jimmy Butler.  There‚Äôs a mean-streak about Kawhi too.  That game against Dallas was murder.
Jimmy Butler has that same level of near-sociopathic competitiveness
Jimmy Butler battling with LeBron. Figured we‚Äôd win the series anyways so I was able to enjoy the game fully.
"The rockets announcers seem like trash. Also he said ‚ÄúButler is a great player, but could he get 23pts 9 rebounds and 6 assists‚Äù..... uhhh yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure jimmy could do that lmao."
"In order, AD, Lebron, Kawhi, Curry, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown and more, but basically superstars or anybody that could overwhelm the opposition defensively"
"Did things in the finals that haven't been done in years? My god. Literally in the same series Giannis averaged more points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks with fewer turnovers. Jimmy Butler had multiple 40 point finals games last year including a 40 point triple double. What exactly did he do that no one has done in years?  It's perfectly acceptable to say he's improved defensively. But going from unplayable defensively to just a standard defensive liability does not make him good defensively - it's still a big demerit to his game. The only player considered top 25 that has defense as bad as Booker is Trae Young, everyone else is close to neutral or better."
As a hard core LaVine fan I just keep thinking he shouldnt be there. Tatum and KD should get his shots and Booker is here now too.   Jimmy Butler would help more
"Would Jimmy Butler help with physicality, playmaking, and not taking contested 3s?"
So this team basically needs jimmy butler out there to run with the 3rd stringers
He doesn‚Äôt often but it does happen like every 3/15 games and he‚Äôll still get 30 sometimes. I‚Äôm not even hating that‚Äôs insane in it‚Äôs own right but that‚Äôs just how much free throws are important. Jimmy Butler is another good example of that. He has plenty off field nights but is an excellent FT shooter
"&gt;And let's be honest, GarPax didn't want to retool around Jimmy, their project with the Rose era was over   Exactly. They were planning on blowing up the roster the year *before* they fired Thibs but knew it would be career suicide to do it all at once, so they had to manufacture reasons for each.  They blamed Thibs for the lack of success in 2014 and fired him. Then blamed Rose for the lack of playoffs in 2015 and traded him. Then blamed Butler for the lack of success in 2016 and traded him.  Thankfully, Jerry finally blamed Gar Pax for the lack of success in 2020 and we got some new decision making in place."
"That Wade signing was just awful from the get go. Rondo was not a good pairing with Butler either but adding Wade just made things worse as everyone in the NBA was going to spacing and 3 point shooting, the Bulls had 3 guards who could not hit open 3 pointers.  Which leads me to believe signing Wade was never a basketball move but a business move to put asses in seats and sell some jerseys. Gar Pax knew it was never going to work, but they could make the move, make Jerry some money, then blame Jimmy saying it's just impossible to build around him so you can justify getting rid of the last remnants of Thibs like a spurned ex girlfriend burning photos of the jerk who she just broke up with for a really dumb reason."
"You wanna talk about wasting draft picks? The Timberwolves (along with the Kings) are the true experts in this field that all the other teams bow down to  Selected Brandon Roy in 2006, good job. Immediately trades him to Portland for Randy Foye because reasons.  Drafts a Florida Gator in 2007, sound logic as Florida were back-to-back NCAA champions. But y'all took Corey Brewer and not future DPOY Joakim Noah  The Timberwolves drafts 3 point guards in 2009, none of them were named Steph Curry or even Jrue Holiday  They took forward Wesley Johnson over DeMarcus Cousins in 2010, if they didn't want a big man Gordon Hayward &amp; Paul George were also still available.  Another forward in Derrick Williams in 2011 despite drafting Johnson the previous year.   Acquires Shabazz Muhammad in 2013, a shooting guard that can't shoot or guard anyone. Out of the league in 4 years  Drafts 4-year college player Kris Dunn in 2016, he shits the bed in his rookie season despite being touted as ""NBA-ready"" and ended up being packaged in the Jimmy Butler deal (not that I'm complaining, he was decent for the Bulls)  Drafts Justin Patton in 2017 (John Collins was still on the board), dude gets injured in Summer League and has played a grand total of 296 minutes of NBA basketball since. Last seen on the Rockets"
"&gt;No Lebron, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Beal, etc.  Most of these guys are rehabbing from injury/sickness"
"For everyone saying ""the world is catching up""... it is, but we're still a cut above and beyond.   The starting 5 of players **not** here is insane. **Steph**\-**Harden**\-**Lebron**\-**Kawhi**\-**AD** with a bench of **Cp3**, **Jimmy Butler**, **Lowry**, **Westbrook.**"
"Yea but you know idiots are gonna be saying that Giannis was overrated and had a ""Mickey Mouse Run"" due to injuries when the Bucks are likely gonna lose to a healthy Nets juggernaut next year. Giannis can average like 50 and idk if that still enough to take down this team which is ridiculous  Already saw it happen for AD who went from ""Better than Tim Duncan"" to ""Not top 10"" and Jimmy Butler who I actually saw some people calling him better than James Harden last year due to leading his team to the finals"
"r/nba siding with famous hard workers RJ Hunter, Jerian Grant, Denzel Valentine and Bobby Portis over Jimmy Butler and an undersized wing who had a top 20 career ever on half a knee."
"Things are looking up for the Timberwolves. New ownership, a team with decent talent (KAT, D-Lo, Ant), a competent coach in Chris Finch, and a GM who isn't afraid to make moves when necessary.  People like to shit on us for ""wasting KG's prime"" when he chose to stay in Minnesota for a total of 12 seasons. His loyalty should not be something used to blame the team for. A mid-market expansion team playing in the north where it's cold and can't attract FAs isn't gonna be eager to get rid of their franchise player until absolutely necessary.  Also, fuck Jimmy Butler."
&gt;Minnesota. Jimmy Butler is the only reason they‚Äôve been relevant for about 20 years and that was 1 year. And KG was the only reason they were relevant before that.   Jordan is the only reason the Bulls were ever relevant outside of a 2 year Rose window.
"Not that I would have anything against criticizing Butler as a leader at the time, but no - they are two different people with different actions (no matter if they ""pretty much were aligned"" lol). One big difference between the two were that Jimmy Butler actually showed up for pracctices. Pretty big difference.  Well, I haven't really seen anyone make that claim either? The claim was that Dwyane Wade was a terrible leader - which he evidently was - and that it rubbed the fans the wrong way - which it certainly did.  Kind of hard to see what you're arguing."
"okay sure man Wade was a bad leader, you'll also have to call Jimmy Butler a bad leader, Wade and him were pretty much aligned in their leadership philosophy, and there was a rift between the vets and the young guys.   So congrats on making that argument. I'm just saying Wade being a ""bad leader"" wasn't even close to being one of the main reasons why that team sucked and barely made the playoffs."
Curry  Harden  Luka  Dame  Cp3    Kawhi/Bron/KD healthy equal imo  Tatum  Jimmy Butler
"It‚Äôs funny hearing the 3x3 guys talk so much shit on the NBA players. If some NBA guys, especially stars, went after this, they would destroy this event.  You could have a team with Curry, Harden, and KD and just put the other team on skates the entire game and end the game quickly with the 2npoint threes.   You could do a team with Jrue Holiday, Jimmy Butler, and Bam Adebayo and just steal the ball from these bums every possession. Hell, even the offensive Steph/Harden/KD team might steal the ball every possession."
"He‚Äôs a professional athlete getting max contract who doesn‚Äôt care to get better. That‚Äôs just embarrassing  Life isn‚Äôt all about a career, no, weird you keep pushing this point, but life is about fulfilling your duties and dude refuses to do that, he‚Äôs kicking back cuz he already got paid. Makes him a walking L idc how much money he has or how good he lives  He has a responsibility to his teammates at the very least to get better, not surprised he got called out by Jimmy butler, embiid, his coach, among others. Not to mention his responsibility to 6ers fans, we all know how they feel at this point"
"Booker is way higher.  Having him in 24-28 puts him below guys like Gobert and Towns and Zion and Beal who he is better than.  I had Booker 12th to 16th.  Him, Trae, Kyrie, Paul George, Jimmy Butler are all in the same tier."
"Exactly, when the heat lost they were clowned on. They were heavily liked last year too. Jimmy Butler was praised for his performance. As soon as he lost, all that praise got thrown out the window."
Yes I remember Bryn Forbes specifically locking up Jimmy Butler
All I‚Äôm gonna say is Jimmy Butler was outplayed by Bryn Forbes
"&gt;where as Jimmy Butler looks past his or already peaked.  I mean, I get this because he is 31. But this season was the best year of his career."
Booker has a higher ceiling and both have lost in 6 games in the finals as their team‚Äôs leading scorer. I‚Äôd say their impact is close but I‚Äôm siding with Booker because of his age and he‚Äôs still ascending towards his prime where as Jimmy Butler looks past his or already peaked.
Jimmy Butler I remain a loyal Heat Fan Here!
"Jimmy butler by far, the defense and playmaking gap is just so much"
"I mean I see what you‚Äôre saying, but who should‚Äôve made it over him? Kawhi made All-NBA first team while only playing 52/72 games, and PG and Jimmy Butler (on the third team) played 54 and 52 games respectively."
Dame for jimmy butler  Paul George for hoodie Carmelo
"What would be your dream team USA 3x3 team? I feel like the formula for success is high energy players that can make their own shot and can guard 1-4 on D. Some thoughts are Westbrook, Klay, Draymond, Kawhai, PG, Jimmy Butler."
I dont think that any star-mentality player will get demoralized for that.. more like they would use it as a motivation to get better.. thats a difference between wiggins type of players and jimmy butler for example
"It was still decent when he came into the league. After they got Jimmy Butler though, he was placed in the corner as a corner shooter, that he just isn't, which obv caused him to lose interest and is the reason why his numbers decreased. After Jimmy Butler left, he was given the ball more, which let him slash, which is his fort√©, and he started playing a lot better again."
"Somehow get him Jimmy Butler and he's 100% staying. Jimmy compliments him perfectly. But realistically, one or more of Simmons, Jerami Grant, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, Noel (continues listing 2 way wings and elite defensive bigs)"
What does Beal do that CJ doesn't do? To me Beal for McCollum is a lateral move. Trading a score first SG that Dame is friends with for another.     Like someone else said hope Jimmy Butler gets into a conniption in Miami but with him you have 1 year until he goes toxic
Jimmy Butler
"take a deep break before you have a conniption  &gt;No reason to think he‚Äôs \[KAT\] available  my response was to this statement. timberwolves isn't some well oiled machine of an organization, mate. they are BAD with him, really bad. the number of pieces they need to compete for a title is beyond their current means.  furthermore, KAT will never be the best player on a championship team. Never. Jimmy Butler showed the world what he is made of.  Additionally, the timberwolves have only made it out of the first round once in the last 30 years+. The franchise is littered with tombstones of the careers of lottery picks that never developed. Your franchise coddles KAT. That is why he's soft as ""baby shit.""  meanwhile, the state next door just won a title. their best player was the 15th overall pick.  Have a nice day."
"Give years ago?  Should have been easy: KD, Curry, and AD should have been on everybody's list. James Harden and Leonard too?  Jimmy Butler and Giannis were pretty safe bets.  The All-NBA teams were full of young players,  Any combination of those folks would have been reasonable.  I do get the Wiggins pick. He looked pretty good that year."
Jimmy Butler has entered the chat
"Yes! In fact, if the Bucks swapped Giannis for LeBron, I think they‚Äôd still be contenders. If you swapped Jimmy Butler for LeBron, the Heat would be consistent contenders. If you swapped LeBron for DeMar DeRozan, the Spurs would be favorites again. I think there are a lot of situations without other HOF players where LeBron could thrive."
The sudden death of Flip Saunders. Fundamental fork in the road of our franchise. Which led to KG hating Glenn Taylor even more than he already did and ditching the rebuild idea in favor of Jimmy Butler.
Jimmy Butler is a pretty good impersonator of SpongeBob's house.
"In the three full games he played he averaged 7 assist to 3.6 TO (half probably offensive fouls) not great but also not terrible. Jimmy butler playing like a God, Jae crowder shooting the piss out the ball, and Buds horrific game plan are the top three reason why we lost. And go ahead and lump in everyone playing horrible and out of sync (outside or game three Middleton) for the whole series. Those are the reasons we lost."
They kinda are but they haven't really made much noise since Jimmy Butler. Attention has shifted to some of the better performing teams
If you watch his games pre 2019 playoffs he is doing a lot more ball handling and initiation of the offense in the half court. At some point Coach Brown offloaded those playmaking duties to Jimmy Butler and he stuck Ben in the dunkers spot.
"Yeah, I think the basis of the deal would/should be Wiseman + 7 for Miles. If Jimmy Butler cost the #7 and LaVine, I don‚Äôt see why 7 and Wiseman shouldn‚Äôt be the base for a guy like Miles."
The one I question is jimmy butler. Do people think injuries are the main reason he sucked or did he come back down to earth?
‚ÄúNow that the 2010s are over‚Äù bro that‚Äôs not how this works lol. How do we know there won‚Äôt be another Giannis / Jimmy Butler / kawhi/ Paul George type breakout from any of the more recent draft classes. You can‚Äôt say because it‚Äôs 2021 we can rank these younger classes‚Ä¶ I mean we have seen one year of Edwards and Melo etc. you have to wait until they all retire to be able to properly go back and evaluate their career‚Äôs as a whole
"&gt;11 - Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Bump Kemba Walker for Nikola Vucevic for your starting 5.  Not saying Kemba is not as good as Vuc, but I am saying Kyrie, Klay, and Jimmy are better than Kemba and this lineup needs a big man, Vuc is a 2x all star."
"There‚Äôs about 6 superstars in the league. Maybe less. I think RJ is going to be a star but not a superstar. To me RJ has more of a Jimmy Butler type ceiling. Which is still really good. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible he becomes a superstar because he has the mentality of one and has the work ethic, but rn it just seems unlikely."
