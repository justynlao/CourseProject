"The disrespect to Jacob Evans, who we picked over Gary Trent Jr...."
Ben Simmons?  PG: Ben Simmons / Malcolm Brogdon Marcus Smart  SG: Terry Rozier / Alec Burks / Buddy Hield  SF. Mikal Bridges / Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr  PF: OG Anunoby / Jerami Grant / Marcus Morris  C: Myles Turner / Nikola Vucevic / Jakob Poeltl
2 main points i disagree on:  Fournier has been inconsistent. not a fair assumption he's gonna get $22/yr. not sure Gary Trent Jr. for thay matter will get as much  Some of the young guys have shown real promise: Pritchard and Nesmith (sp?) in particular
"&gt; Not sure if he lands in Toronto  We don't need a SG, we are going to probably re-sign Gary Trent Jr so it make no sense for us to go for recovering goods in Oladipo.  And we don't need him as a PG because well a) he isn't a point guard b) we already have Van Vleet under contract"
"Gary Trent, Jr. turned down a 4 year $54M deal last December to bet on himself, so it should be interesting to see what he gets on the open market (hopefully with Toronto).  He signed with Klutch sports so my biggest nightmare is that he ends up being a Laker next year."
Gary Trent Jr. Also had a buzzer beater to win the game this season. Chin up kiddo.
Portland was correct in trading Gary Trent Jr. I love the dude and hope he does well but just look at his shooting % right now. Portland was going to lose him anyway and this year we got a great upgrade which might help us get out of the first round.
PG: Luka(8.0)/ Trae(6.5)/ SGA(4.1)  SG: Lavine(19.5)/ Mitchell(5.1)/ Gary Trent Jr.(1.6)  SF: OG(3.8)/ Mikal(4.3)/ Duncan Robinson(1.8)  PF: Tatum(9.8)/ Zio(10.2)/ MPJ(3.5)  C: Bam(5.1)/ Brook(13.0)/ Dwight(2.5)
DJ Augustin  Gary Trent Jr.  Jerami Grant  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Nikola Vucevic  Dillon Brooks  Dorian Finney-Smith  Tim Hardaway Jr. (Love that guy tho)
I guess Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr. gonna have the Steph Curry green light smh
Gary Trent jr either goes 4/16 or 8/16 lol
"people don't realize this yet, but gary trent jr is gonna be the new jrich."
"Lowry's definitely our best player and the team would be worse off without him, but the biggest issue with the roster is the lack of a starting-calibre centre when we have an excess of playable guards (Lowry, FVV, Norm Powell/Gary Trent Jr, even rookie of the month Malachi Flynn).  As long as keep one of Lowry and GTJ, getting a decent centre this off-season will go a long way. The fanbase is optimistic about a return to form next year--a long offseason, a return to Toronto, another year of development for Siakam/FVV/OG, half our guys recovering from Covid, and a high draft pick."
"Just got to match whatever offer sheet Gary Trent jr gets and a lot of Raptors fans will get their wish.  OT, but that trade is going to look putrid for the Blazers if Powell bounces this offseason."
Anyone else have a mild aneurysm when Gary Trent Jr. took the inbound?
Gary Trent Jr looking like he's pissed he still has to play more lol
I'm just listing down 3 to tie but game winners against Washington   Cory Joseph  Hedo turkuglu  Serge ibaka  Chris Bosh  Gary trent jr
Also Gary Trent Jr
"Michael Jordan, he was gambling like crazy, he was great on ball, but he definitely had a lot of bad moments off the ball  Currently :  \- Mason Plumlee : Malone always used him as a defensive sub, despite the fact that he's not even a better defender than Jokic, he plays hard, but he makes a lot of mistakes, fouls a ton, he's average at the absolute best  \- Kelly Oubre and Gary Trent Jr : those 2 together because they are the same, they play ultra hard, they put on a show, tap on the floor, get on a ultra low stance....but I've actually rarely seen them stay in front of anyone decent, and both aren't strong enough for the real big wings  \- Domantas Sabonis and Brandon Ingram most people think they are average/slightly below average, in reality they are terrible  \- PatBev : he's still useful because he's strong for his size and can switch but he fouls a toooon and a lost a lot of lateral quickness  \- Khris Middleton : he's still a decent option on big wings because of his size but since his injury a few years ago he' snot been the same athlete at all, he can't stay in front, he execute the scheme well, and can send his guy to Lopez/Giannis at the rim, but he can't stay in front of guys  \- Lou Dort : he might be THE best iso defender in the league, but he's not that good at getting trough screens, guarding off ball movement, he's a great defender, but he's gotten a bit overrated  \- Robert Covington : great help defender, a really mediocre on ball guy  \- Donovan Mitchell : the new Russ, still has a defensive reputation because he was good in college, he's at best average, probably worse than that.  \- And to finish the one that will get me downvoted, he's an awesome defender, but Ben Simmons isn't the DPOY"
"Dame, Giannis, Jaylen Brown, Kyrie, Gary Trent Jr"
Thats what Gary Trent Jr will be next year. Our closer.
"Fuck it let's try this...   PG: Fred VanVleet  SG: Khris Middleton  SF: Bojan Bogdanović  PF: Christian Wood  C: Nikola Jokic  Bench: Seth Curry, Chris Boucher, Gary Trent Jr, Lu Dort, Yam Madar just for the hell of it."
"If Lowry is moved the lineup will be: FVV, Gary Trent Jr., OG, Pascal, Khem Birch.  I'm anticipating a lot of changes this offseason though, I think it will be more than just Lowry, I expect FVV and Siakam to be high possibilities for trades."
"Maybe not. Not while we still have FVV on the team. We'll have to pay Gary Trent Jr to keep him so no way we dont start GTJ, who plays a 2. So it would be FVV and GTJ backcourt.  Flynn is still a rook so from a cost perspective, hes not starting. And also who we draft this year will have a huge impact on Flynn. If we somehow manage Cade, this changes things again."
"Thanks for the context and all, and it's perfect valid, but we just got rocked by a Kings team without DeAaron Fox and Harrison Barnes and a Raps team without OG, FVV and Gary Trent Jr. You still had the MVP, Gordon and MPJ. We'll take the W however we can get them at this rate lol"
This team can't beat the Kings without Fox and Barnes or the Raptors without FVV and Gary Trent Jr. Anthony Davis looks like he doesn't give a fuck half the time and who knows when LeBron will be back and then Andre Drummond. Consider it a blessing if they manage to win a play in game.
"Right because exactly the 31st pick is what i’m talking about. Just look at the 2018 draft, far back enough to evaluate whether these players are good and still relatively recent. In the 31-40 range, good young players like Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson were taken and rotation players like Bonga and Carter"
Whatever Gary Trent Jr is about to be paid.
"Missing VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr, and OG too  Super ugly loss"
"jesus christ and this is with FVV, Gary Trent Jr, OG anunoby, and chris boucher all out for the raptors"
That’s Khem Birch not Gary Trent Jr. lol
"Gary Trent Jr had +54 in 30 minutes earlier this year, technically 1 minute more though"
Party Mills = Gary Trent Jr = Weeknd
Kevin Porter Jr and Michael Porter Jr and Gary Trent Jr
We’re in a pretty bad position to make a significant trade tbh. Gary Trent Jr was probably our most intriguing trade asset and we traded him for a few months of Norman Powell
So we just straight up copying Gary Trent jr. now? Smh.
"&gt; tenacious scorers in Collin Sexton and Gary Trent JR, solid players like the Bridges brothers  As someone who once thought they were brothers too — they’re not actually brothers! Seemingly not related at all!"
Gary Trent Jr
I 100% sincerely think that there is a chance that Gary Trent jr could make the leap and become beal/durant level
Gary Trent Jr tho
"Gary Trent Jr has more star potential and younger for our rebuild, they're pretty interchangeable as is but norms a little better right now"
Gary Trent Jr.
"It's because you put the space before the period on #14 and have no space on #23 and #24, here's a fixed version   1. Luka Doncic  2. Trae Young  3. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  4. Michael Porter Jr  5. Jaren Jackson Jr  6. Colin Sexton  7. DeAndre Ayton  8. Mikal Bridges  8. DeVonte Graham  9. Gary Trent Jr  10. Mitchell Robinson  11. Miles Bridges  12. Robert Williams  13. Jalen Brunson  14. Duncan Robinson  15. Kevin Huerter  16. Wendell Carter Jr  17. Donte Devincenzo  18. Shake Milton  19. Kendrick Nunn  20. De'anthony Melton  21. Afernee Simons  22. Lonnie walker  23. Marvin Bagley III  24. Jae Sean Tate  25. Landry shamet  26. Josh Okogie  27. Grayson Allen  28. Mo Bamba  29. Mo Wagner  30. Kevin Knox"
You already got Gary “star boy” Trent jr and now you trying to take dame too?!?!
"You're saying if you need scoring, you'd take Brunson over Gary Trent Jr and Graham? I like Brunson but dude has had like 2 25+ point games the past 2 years."
This but with Gary Trent Jr.
"I have to admit, I can see it being considered top 4 all time in a decade, depending on how the guys develop, but there's a ton of talent. Besides Luka probably being a future MVP, this draft could overcome other top-heavy ones with it's depth. I think Ayton, Bagley, Luka, JJJ, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Mikal &amp; Miles Bridges, Michael Porter Jordan, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Timelord, Gary Trent Jr., Shake Milton are the notable ones."
"This is why we traded Gary Trent Jr. I love the guy and when hes on fire hes on fire, but he also has games where he truly disappears from scoring. Everyone talking shit about how stupid we were to trade. He's just all over the place with performance."
Gary Trent Jr either goes off or plays like crap   No in between
"I think part of this is that the Wizards don't have any inside defense.  Take [this quote from Gary Trent Jr](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mx4vk3/gary_trent_jr_the_west_is_completely_different/): ""[The West] is completely different from the East, it's kind of run-and-gun, it's more chucking 3's. The East is kind of grind-it-out... they'll still throw into the post... you don't really get too much of that in the West.""  The Wizards are a complete horror when it comes to inside defense. Thomas Bryant (who is not exactly a paint menace) is out for the season, and then who is their next best guy? RoLo is kind of competent but plays very few minutes.  Also defense is the side of the floor most impacted by coaching, and the Wizards have Scott Brooks.  Otoh, they have two borderline all-NBA guards. So I think their roster is kind of an anomaly too."
It was kind of jokes to hear Gary Trent Jr talking about Portlands defense compared to Toronto.
"It took a second before Gary Trent, Jr.’s name clicked with me, and this was on my front page, so I wound up reading the beginning like it was going to be an offensive, moronic quote about Western vs. Eastern cultures. (I got all the way to, “chucking 3’s,” before figuring it out.) So now, no matter what anyone says, this feels like the smartest, most accurate thing I’ve ever read."
yessuh i got the chance to meet him when i was in middle school but yeah hes a hooper i know hes been ballin for yall. I also mess with Gary Trent jr cuz hes from apple valley
"Gary Trent Jr was getting PTSD lol, he was just in the back like “I was there last year.”"
"Hell no, but Gary Trent Jr. on the other hand..."
Gary Trent Jr.
"I don't know about their list of ""move after move after move""... Covington is the only piece there that seems really desirable. DJJ is kinda meh. RHJ has been on the league scrapheap for a while for a reason. Norm Powell is nice, but so was Gary Trent Jr.  I would blame their injury curse and kinda poor roster construction as much as I'd blame any coaching"
"Define “good.” You said he’s “pure ass.” Going by BPM (worse than Kuz), here are some players this year that are crystal-grade ass:  Schröder  RJ Barrett  PJ Washington  KCP  Seth Curry  Darius Garland  Tyler Herro  Gary Trent JR  Lou Williams  Ricky Rubio  Lu Dort  Ant Edwards  Dillon Brooks"
"I mean... Siakam went from being all NBA 2nd team to being the least efficient 20pt player.   The players and himself had to deal with COVID. They're playing out of hotel rooms even at home games.   Lowry, an amazing PG might be leaving for nothing in the off-season.  They lost Ibaka for the pipe dream of signing Giannis which didn't pan out literal weeks after Ibaka left for LAC.  They replaced two great C's with Baynes.  There are too many guards, who do we develop between Lowry, Gary Trent Jr, and FVV when we don't know who we'll have next season.  Nurse went from a championship team, to a 2nd best record team, to a team that is now struggling between the FO wanting a tank and the coach and players wanting to making the play-in.  Florida."
Gary Trent Jr
"Uh, we have some nice young pieces IDK what you mean. Gary Trent JR is 22, OG is young, most of our core is 28 or less and we have our own picks moving forward.   And if anything, this is year 1 of our rebuild. If we just had a center rotation for the whole season it wouldn't look nearly this bad. And a game 7 second round exit is something, I'd imagine, the Knicks would love to be a part of."
"I don't know how you can argue Gary Trent Jr is even an average defender at this point. He has bad measurables and he's never graded as a positive defender before. I think you're getting a bit lost in the hype of GTJ right now. Gary is slow laterally, he can't jump, he's got a bad standing reach and wingspan... There's really no data to suggest he'll ever be a plus defender.  Offensively he stands a better chance but even then, he's abysmal at driving to the basket and is pretty much strictly a jump shooter at this point of his career. Maybe he learns how to drive and layup but he hasn't shown any proclivity to do that up to this point."
Gary Trent Jr. never says die!
"Gary Trent Jr it is me, your biggest fan."
OG Anunoby   Gary Trent Jr   Fred Vanvleet   Idk what it is about Toronto but everyone loves to overrate their role players. Might be because of their regular season success last year.
Westbrook shooting solid is still 5% below league average. I’m a huge Westbrook fan but cmon  Yea it’s good. It’s not best shooter of all time level  It’s absolutely not lmao have you looked at the way this Warriors team is playing. Also Covington is a guy who got traded for multiple picks why are using him as an example of a bad player Dame had to cope with. Kanter is better than Wiseman and Gary Trent Jr is clearly a great player - he’s averaging almost 18 on the raptors on better efficiency than Dame this season  The Warriors primary offensive option after Curry is Wiggins who admittedly is better this season but still far from an acceptable second option
Gary Trent Jr
It was probably Gary Trent Jr especially defensively. Not sure who it now
Gary Trent Jr. He will have a breakout season next year
Is there anyone on this sub that would seriously take him over Gary Trent Jr?
"""A lot of the things you guys are proposing in the comments are a bit unrealistic""  Says the guy suggesting the Lakers add Steph Curry, Beal, and Gary Trent Jr."
That's Gary Trent Jr. territory
"Obi Toppin is 23. He's the same age or older than the following 3rd or 4th year players:  Luka Doncic  Trae Young  Deandre Ayton  Jason Tatum  Bam Adebayo  Brandon Ingram  John Collins  OG Anunoby  Gary Trent Jr.  Jarren Jackson Jr.  Michael Porter Jr.  Jarrett Allen  Colin Sexton  Lonzo Ball  Markelle Fultz  Jonathan Isaac  ...and probably more I'm missing. Way too early to call him a bust, but it puts into perspective how soon he should be expected to start developing."
It used to be Gary Trent Jr. :'(
I don't usually disagree with your assessments but I do on this one. Trents peak IMO is how hes playing now but consistently. If you look at his draft scouting reports the weaknesses aren't things he has shown any sign of changing.  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/gary-trent-jr/  Profiles as 3 and D minus the D IMO.
Guy is the taller more talented version of Gary Trent Jr. Id take both of them to be really excellent 6th men long term.
I was low-key mad when Gary Trent Jr hit that game winner against Washington.   We would've dropped below Washington if he doesn't hit the game winner
"and this is why, people, they traded Gary Trent Jr. away"
older gary trent jr is so good
Did Gary Trent Jr. fuck your girlfriend or something? Damn
Imagine not knowing Gary Trent Jr by his initials
Gary Trent Jr
"Shit he's still playing there now, just goes by his spy name ""Gary Trent Jr."""
Any team that has Gary Trent Jr. is a superteam.
"Dragic’s a good choice for sure.   I’d add Jordan Clarkson, Gary Trent Jr., Nerlens Noel, Norman Powell, Joe Ingles (if he still comes off the bench, can’t remember), Shake Milton’s should get to be in this category too with some consistency. Saric has been kind of amazing in Phoenix as a bench big as well.  edit: Naz Reid"
he's putting the Jr. in Gary Trent Jr.
Steph is eating Gary Trent Jr
Give me Gary or give me death!   But seriously I would have like Trent Jr. replace Dame.
"Plus Gary Trent Jr.’s recent emergence and pending free agency also puts a hamper on things, too. Some people stating to trade CJ or to trade Trent while his value is high as well."
Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr
"We could probably be a playoff team as soon as next season   It all depends on what direction we take. We have a chance of keeping our pick this year, and we have our pick next year. So tanking is an option, though tanking usually takes more than 2 seasons, and being awful further than that will only help okc not us   We also will have some good cap space to work with if instead of tanking we want to be competitive. Next season we have about 23m in the cap to use, and if we find a way to get rid of Gordon for an expiring or straight into someone’s cap, we will have basically a max slot   John Collins or Gary Trent Jr are decent options I wouldn’t be mad at if we overpaid slightly.   Wall Trent KPJ Tate Wood is a decent team. It’ll depend on the depth and coaching but it’s not hopeless   It all depends on how we draft with the low picks we’ll get from Brooklyn and bucks and trailblazers.   The ultimate goal is to retool to a low playoff level team. And wait until Brooklyn becomes old when we have their 2025, 26 and 27 picks unprotected"
It'd be cool if our role players could hit open 3's like Gary Trent Jr
Man I wish. We’re also without cj which hurts but it’s cool seeing Gary Trent jr get more playing time
here we go again with Gary Trent Jr.
We are playing the blazers Gary Trent Jr is gonna drop 50 lmao
I'm totally expecting Gary Trent Jr to make more 3s than the Lakers
Gary Trent Jr at 41 is an absolute joke
Basically Gary Trent Jr but he can't make his fts.
With a dash of Gary Trent jr
Derrick Jones Jr. and Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr
CP3 making it over Gary Trent Jr. is just sort of ridiculous to me tbh
Gary Trent Jr
one name you didn’t mention: gary trent jr. hes gonna get the largest bag of all the others on this list. hes with klutch so it’s definitely gonna be around 20-22mil a year
"A lot of guys who are forced to shoot under pressure. here's a few  * [Tyler Herro](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629639/shots-dash/) * [Evan Fournier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203095/shots-dash/) * [Brandon Ingram (tho he's more than stationary from 3)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1627742/shots-dash/) * [Terry Rozier](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1626179/shots-dash/) * [Gary Trent](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629018/shots-dash/) * [Jordan Clarkson](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203903/shots-dash/) * [Tim Hardaway Jr.](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/203501/shots-dash/)  Each of those guys shows a significantly higher aptitude for shooting with defenders in their vicinity, which I think gives a better idea of their ability as spot up threats. Part of spot up shooting, imo, is actually being a threat that other teams respect. Yeah sure Myles Turner can make like 35% of his open 3s. Who cares? No defense does. (This is the trap of the stretch 5 that a lot of teams fall into. Unless you're KAT, it doesn't affect the defense).   Lonzo's shot profile is much more in line with someone like Jae Crowder, both of whom get ignored by every defense in the league. My big point is that we put way too much stock into one number - overall 3pt % - to tell us who's a good shooter and who isn't, and then are surprised when guys fall off in the playoffs or the bubble. Dig a little deeper and you can really start understanding different levels of shooting ability."
Gary Trent Jr: hold my beer  https://youtu.be/F8z6dG7rYUE
"Simmons, Smart  Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown (categorized as guard in All Star)  and my homer pick, Matisse Thybulle. Throw in Beverly, Gary Trent Jr., Paul George, Gary Harris, etc.  I’m not saying all of these guys are better than Vanvleet, I’m just saying he’s not one of the top 4."
Gary Trent JR is only getting better
"He gets voted in because that's who the fans wanted to see - not because his team is better. They're both putting up incredible stats and I wasn't going to be mad if Lillard made it over Luka, but to use team record is a bit disingenuous as Covid ravaged our starting lineup (literally made us play like 6 or 7 games with 5 players out when teams now get to have their games postponed) and Gary Trent Jr/Robert Covington would be the 2nd/3rd best players on our team right now (Brunson would be the 4th best)."
"&gt; a confident Simons that can hit threes and cover ball handling duties and Gary Trent Jr hitting threes and defending.  my point exactly, checkmate foolio"
"Hey man, honestly props for you for trying to use a level of analysis and deep thought. I guess you somehow missed that we upgraded from Mario Hezjona and Zach Collins to RoCo and DJJ, a confident Simons that can hit threes and cover ball handling duties and Gary Trent Jr hitting threes and defending. But sure, go off on a small sample of games where your best effort at rebuttal is to shit you pants and say “duuurrrr record”."
Doesn't say as much as you are expecting... Damien Lillard is carrying most of the load without the 2 other best players on this team with bits of Gary Trent Jr. Iso and hints of Melo.
Gary Trent Jr. is also going off of a lot of isos this year.
Enes kanter Gary Trent Jr
Gary Trent Jr deserves some love
"Yeah,    Bruce Brown   Mykhaliuk   Milton   Gary Trent Jr   Hamidou Diallo   Brunson   Graham   Mitchell Robinson     Nobody of Jokic's caliber tho"
"Basically, he hurts you in more categories than he helps. You generally face off in fg%, ft%, 3pm, pts, reb, ast, stl, blk, and turnovers. Each category counts for one point, and you obviously want to win in as many categories each week as possible. If you beat your first matchup in 7 categories, your record is 7-2.   In the early rounds, you basically want guys that will put up 20/5/5 or better on good efficiency. Guys like Jokic and Embiid are prime because they usually go like 30/10/5 on 60% shooting and 80% from the line. Curry, Kawhi, KD, PG, Lillard, LaVine are all top tier picks as well.   Russ is a bad pick because he shoots 40% from the field on twenty shots a game, which really drags down your team's overall fg%. His 19 ppg are not worth his crappy efficiency. He also has five turnovers and only one three per game. He's shooting an abysmal 62% from the line. The assists and rebounds are are nice, but he's sub-par in every other category.   I wouldn't draft him even if he was available in the final round because he has such a net negative impact on your stats. There are guys in the middle to late rounds who can put twenty points on better efficiency from the field and line, as well as hit more threes. Guys like Jordan Clarkson and Gary Trent Jr. are good examples.   If you are interested in trying fantasy, you can still do free leagues on Yahoo or ESPN, etc."
"If Gary Trent Jr. can continue to show up and play at an All-Star caliber level and Simons continues his growth to be more aggressive and obviously health is on their side, the Blazers have a legitimate shot.  All it takes is for a team to have three legitimate scoring options that can also facilitate to get hot in the playoffs and roll with that momentum if they are deep enough.  The Blazers just need Nurkic back as they need a big that can change the pace that can create and pass out of the post.  I want the Blazers to win so bad because of how badly the NBA screwed over the basketball rich city in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest needs a win after losing Roy, Oden, and Durant."
"when the all star starters were announced it took 5 seconds for the blazers flairs to switch from   ""we should pay gary trent jr whatever it takes to keep him, nevermind paying the repeater tax"" and ""simons is legit, watch some games""   to  ""dame has no help""  one of the fastest flip flops i've seen on here"
"All of a sudden the blazers supporting players are better. Pretty sure most analysts had the blazers in the play in tourney and the Warriors contending this year. Are you trading Dray for Gary Trent? Wiseman for Kanter? Wiggins or Oubre for Derick Jones Jr? How bout for Melo? If Dame's team is better it's because he's making them better, Daddy Steph and his Gravity need to get his team to a top half offense."
The blazers by far have the best team  Pg Damian Lillard Sg Brandon Roy Sf Clyde Drexler Pf Carmelo Anthony C Lamarcus Aldridge 6 Cj Mcollum 7 Gary Trent Jr 8 Robert Covington 9 Derick Jones Jr 10 Jusuf Nurkic 11 Enes Kanter 12 Anfornee Simmons  This team is OP literally there 6th man is an all star level player. The Pg through C are all players who were top 10 in the league in their prime also. This is by far the best team
That’s Gary “daddy” Trent Jr. to you.
"Lol I’m a Warriors fan too and some nights I want to believe, but I think to be a quality NBA team you need a reliable secondary scorer and decent spacing so all players can eat.   Wiggins, Oubre, and Draymond are all decent to good players in their own right, but the only credible scorer is Wiggins (and he’s operating at a 3rd option level in his shot attempts and efficiency). Draymond is one of the worst shooters in the NBA and the spacing with our starting lineup collectively is honestly putrid, hence the crazy coverage Steph gets.   Steph has to score 30% of our points, which is crazy, and it’s insane he’s doing it at a high level given he’s the singular focus of defences. When he’s on we’re 9th in offensive rtg and when he’s sitting we’re basically bottom of the league - netting out to a ~20th overall rating.   I’d easily take a supporting core of Murray, Barton, MPJ, Millsap over what we have. Similarly, healthy CJ, Gary Trent Jr, Nurkic, Covington, and Melo off the bench is better than Steph’s support. And that’s not even getting to the end of rotation guys, where we’re relying on borderline NBA players like JTA, Wanamaker, and Lee/Mulder for heavy minutes."
"Nah, most underrated player in the league is probably KAT, who is an absolute beast but doesn't even get remembered for a mention because he's on the Wolves. If we're talking underrated as far as playing far above their star status, then maybe it would be a player like Gary Trent Jr. Someone that the league as a whole still thinks of as a role player/bench player, despite the fact that they are proving they could start on almost every team in the league this season."
Ah yes they’re winning these games because of Gary Trent Jr. and not Dame. Who gets Trent all the great looks?
"Huh? Kristaps’ numbers are across the board better than Gary Trent Jr.’s. Trent Jr. is averaging 15 points per game while Porzingis is averaging 20.5 points per game. I think you’re underestimating how big of a loss McCollum has been for Portland, yet you would never that they are down key pieces by looking at their record. You can’t really say the same for the Mavs, I’m sorry."
Gary Trent Jr is actually prime MJ against the Lakers.
Gary Trent Jr as well
If Gary Trent Jr was a Maverick he would be the second best player on the Mavericks.
"they're straight up better with trent playing instead of the mccollum defensive sieve, and kanter is better than nurkic right now   like look at how many gary trent jr posts there are on this subreddit right now   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/lmott4/gary_trent_jr_as_a_starter_this_season_1992617_on/  you can't argue that these guys are balling the fuck out in one thread, and then say dame is carrying in the next  people are literally saying trent might get a max this summer but dame has no help ok"
No way we can afford Gary Trent Jr if we sign Lonzo alone. Not to mention signing Hart and Zo
"I want Lonzo to stay after being very critical of him last year, just depends on the price. He’s shown lots of growth in his shooting not only from 3 but even mid range and FTs. Also has been going to the rim more frequently and converting.   Would love to see a starting lineup next year of Zo/Gary Trent Jr/BI/Zion/Steven with Kira/Hart/Billy the main 3 off the bench. Granted re-signing Zo and Hart along w/ getting an RFA like GTJ may not be feasible with the cap."
"Because the difference between Donavon Mitchell and dame is WAY bigger then embiid and dame. Again, they have the exact same record. They are averaging the same points with comparable ts%, (dame 63 vs embiid 66%) and while that is a good difference, dame is more than doubling embiids assists with no increase in turn overs.   Dame is single handidly wiling his team to the same record as embiid, playing more minutes and more games (with Gary fucking trent jr as his second best player) on just as good or better production. If your argument is defense, no guard under 6’6 should ever win mvp.  It’s a myth that embiid is outplaying dame. It’s just not true."
"Free Dame? He wants to be in Portland. Our team is stacked with young talent. Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Harry Giles. We were in the Western conference Finals two years ago you talk like we didn’t win any playoff series in the last five years. We are 18-10 with CJ and Nurk out. If we need anything it’s a new coach. Dame wants to stay and Portland would only trade him if he requested it. CJ has been on fire all season before his fractured foot. Portland led in the fourth quarter of every game in the West Finals but Golden State came up big. These were close games even though it ended in a sweep."

"Lots of guys stepping up! Props to melo for still contributing, and Gary Trent Jr. having a mini breakout. Of course, none of it happens without Dame"
Or Gary Trent Jr is just a good player... Give credit to the guy where credit is due.
We're seeing something similar in Gary Trent Jr.   He's been killing it as a starter.
Also this thing where Embiid's 2nd and 3rd best players are Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris and Dame's are Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr.  And he's in the west.
"His shooting was pretty poor early on in the season, but the past couple weeks he has been hitting 3s much more consistently. He has had a few decent nights of scoring, but nothing crazy. But we don’t really need him to score loads when we have Dame, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons and CJ when he is healthy.   I’m no expert, but in my opinion his defense has been massive for us. He has had some very very clutch steals and pokes, not many blocks. The combo of him and Derrick Jones Jr. has been a much needed boost all around defensively compared to last season. Those big wingspans get their hands on everything lol.   Overall I would say just about any Blazer fan you talk to would be very happy with the RoCo signing. We’ve always lacked defensive ability, but it’s been a lot better than last season imo."
&gt;Gary Trent Jr is getting all the fucking money this offseason   We have to trade CJ. We look too good with Gary on the floor and he's a better defender.
"1. Maybe Lillards best game this season which is saying a lot 2. Gary Trent Jr is getting all the fucking money this offseason 3. Idk how Zion doesn’t get a shot there at the end, I felt good as soon as I saw Ingram dribbling around"
Gary Trent Jr. is a menace
"I honestly wouldn't mind buying him out. We didn't invest anything into getting him, just free the salary space and make a run for Gary Trent Jr or John Collins in the off-season."
Gary Trent Jr also good put ball through hoop
Gary Trent Jr MVP campaign
"Dame time! Gary Trent, Jr. is annoyingly good at making timely threes (stressed me out when they faced the Lakers in the first round), Covington has been good for them. Even a little Melo renaissance. Ultimately though, Dame is a beast and the team fits well around him."
Damn is so god damn good man. Can’t be said enough. And their supporting cast stays at it all game.   Kings legend Gary Trent Jr. is a bona fide hooper
"If we’re only considering the stretch of games while CJ and Nurk have been then Gary Trent Jr has been better than Wiggins. Wiggins has regressed on offense and floats in-and-out a lot. Also, people love to crap on Enes Kanter but he has played really well with Nurk injured. Anfernee Simmons has been shooting 48% since 48% on 3s since 1/24 per CJ McCollum Twitter. A lot of guys have stepped up for the Blazers."
Gary Trent Jr.
"Could make the argument for Gary Trent, Jr. I think Wiggins is better, but GTJ has been playing great."
How is beal or PG not clear favourites over Booker.  Also Capela is the best at switching at all of the big men so therefore has the most value in the playoffs out of all them.  Gary Trent Jr is a ball hawk so I'd probably pick him. Over Harris  Harrison Barnes is pretty damn good and can be your 3rd all star and is shooting 40% from 3 this year.  TJ Warren would be the bench sparkplug with his 40% 3pt shooting and 20ppg scoring.
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary trent jr is definitely on his way there
"That would be awesome, we'll make you a deal.  If you promise not to offer Gary Trent Jr a huge contract we'll let you have Zach Collins because we know MJ likes big white guys"
You have a westbrook flair my guy I wouldn't be talking.  How many players in the league you think could have their team 16-10 with Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr as their next best players?
Everyone ignore Gary Trent Jr... Everyone ignore Gary Trent Jr...
We can also assume that norm Powell and Gary Trent jr would be the GOATs with more touches but that’s not how basketball is played. The only one arguing against math is the one trying to justify how having more assists and fewer TOs makes him an inferior distributor. But hey if you wanna keep defending that clown take go right ahead
Gary Trent Jr. has been filling CJ’s role nicely averaging around 20 ppg over the last 10 games and plays better defense. I’m not trying to start the “should Portland trade CJ” debate but GTJ has been great.
Most of our team plays like they're dead. RoCo would automatically be our best defender right now.Derrick Jones Jr would be our second best defender. Gary Trent would be our 2nd best offensive player right now. Like cmon even your B team is better than our A team.
I'll add Gary Trent Jr to the list
"I would put Gary Trent Jr, Cov or Kanter ahead of Luka in the allstar game. Not Dame in a milion years though, overhyped."
"Blazers management trying to stop the floodgates of ""what you want for Gary Trent Jr?"" calls"
gary trent jr is definitely going to be an actor after he’s done hooping
Damn I remember when Gary Trent Jr sucked. Props to Portland.  Will the salty Portland fans find a way to complain about that aswell?
Watching Gary Trent Jr go from just hitting catch and shoot threes to shooting off the dribble and making consistently has been one of the best player improvements I've seen from this team. I love it
love me some Gary Trent Jr 3s
gary trent jr flail much
Honestly think that’s how Gary Trent Jr built his reputations with the refs as a strong aggressive defender. He was so explicit in showing every ref that he was physical but not fouling because he would shift his hands behind his back so often and exaggerate the fact that his hands weren’t fouling. Eventually refs just started to buy in to his aggressive ball hounding. No Blazer fan thought he could be a plus defender because of his lack of lateral quickness. Anfernee Simons even said that he wants to learn GTJ type of aggressive defense because Anf got tired of getting called for fouls so he tries to plays D passively. So he ends up getting scored in every-time or still ends up fouling.
Gary Trent and Gary Trent Jr.
"2018 2nd round draft is panning out pretty fantastic; Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr, Hamidou Diallo, De’Anthony Melton and Shake Milton. Most of these guys are going to make a nice chunk of change this offseason."
"Start Mikal, Bench OG, Cut Bojan  Start Middleton, Bench Lavine cut Fred Vanvleet  Start Haliburton, Bench Gary Trent Jr, Cut Lonzo  Start KCP, Bench Kuzma, Cut Melo  Start Dame, Bench CP3 cut Kyrie"

"Gary Trent Jr. leading our team in scoring is hardly a surprise anymore. If he can develop a little more at creating his own shot and getting to the rim, he’ll be a starting guard in this league for years.   Too bad he didn’t sign an extension. How much do you think he gets offered this off-season (that we’ll hopefully match)?"
That’s an interesting way to spell Gary Trent Jr.

"Anfernee Simons, Gary Trent Jr, Nassir Little"
"Lowry sign and trade, Gary Trent Jr sign and trade and 2 1rp?"
What do we do with Gary Trent Jr then? I don't think he signs if he's coming off the bench. You also got Suggs coming in as well.
damn. didn't use the gary trent jr trade asset well in hindsight.
"Portland would probably want one of Tyrese Maxey/Matisse Thybulle and a pick, Philly would probably want a pick. The problem is Philky can’t take the contract of Lowry and CJ at the same time, so you could do  Dame + first round pick swap 2023-&gt; Toronto  Lowry + Gary Trent Jr + Toronto’s 1st rounder from 2022-&gt; Philly  Ben Simmons + Tyrese Maxey + Philly first rounder 2023 -&gt; Portland"
"I’m not moving the goalposts. The discussion is about whether you can get a Paul George caliber for CJ. Meanwhile you’re tossing out these trades that are completely irrelevant.  We are talking about Paul George here, not Kemba. Not Jrich. Not Gary Trent Jr   If you could get Paul George for CJ, guess what Blazers would’ve done it."
"Keep moving those goalposts. lol  - Rozier traded for Kemba.  - Curry traded for Josh Richardson  - Normon Powell traded for Gary Trent Jr.   Small shooting guards get traded for good return all the time. And again, we had up to 5 first round picks to trade with him."
I was think more   Dame/FVV/OG/Boucher/any center in free agency with Gary Trent Jr. off the bench
Portland handing out Gary Trent Jr 18m+ per year and him turning into an Evan Turner/Allen Crabbe pumpkin for 4 more years would've sank us. Trading him for a better player who was a UFA was the way smarter move. It only looks bad if we don't re-sign Norman Powell. I don't expect we'll let him walk.  There's absolutely no way anyone can criticize Portland for that trade... Unless they think Portland has been TOO AGGRESSIVE and needs to play things safer... Which would be dumb.
"**2022 Raptors**  PG- Jalen Suggs, Malachi Flynn   SG- Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., David Duke   SF- OG Anunoby, Deandre Bembry, Rodney Hood  PF- Pascal Siakam, Jericho Sims   C- Richuan Holmes, Chris Boucher, Freddie Gillespie"
"I was talking about the period of games where CJ Mcollum was hurt. I did forget about Gary Trent Jr., but he was inconsistent and missed a few games in that stretch as well. Yet the Blazers were still a good team in that stretch."
The Lakers get LA  The clippers get Riverside  Cavs winning a chip tho  Steph CJ LeBron Larry Kosta Koufos  Terry Rozier Gary Trent Jr Luke Kennard Caris Lavert  Admittedly short on post players but nobody is stopping this offense
Bubble Gary Trent Jr
"how are they improving next year? lowry most likely leaving, re-signing gary trent jr doesn't move the needle. Siakam &amp; vanvleet just seem like regular guys &amp;  whoever they draft isn't going to have a big impact on winning."
Gary Trent is not signing for $25 mil. Probably not even $20mil. And Tor has his bird rights so they can make all their moves and then retain Trent jr.
"Seth, FVV, and Gary Trent Jr on one team that wont even make teh playoffs hurts my nba fan heart"
"Just 1 year ago our core of Lowry,Siakam,FVV,OG,Norm,Gasol and Ibaka finished 53-19 and the 2nd best record in the league  Since then we lost Norm,Gasol,Ibaka and most likely Lowry but we added Gary Trent Jr,Jalen Suggs,Boucher and we have about 20 million in cap space to potentially pursue Holmes or Allen and OG and Freddie both improved since 2019-2020 . Im not saying we will be the 2nd seed again but to think our ceiling is 7th is delusional"
"For me mine is KPJ of the Rockets, Rockets fans are hype for him but imo dude is just a inefficient shot chucker and thats the exact same way I felt about Gary Trent Jr in the first month until I realized how inefficient he was"
I remember watching the game yall played against Toronto where Gary Trent Jr hits the game winner. Boy Chandler was ass cheeks that game
Gary Trent Jr for the Suns
LeBron James / Monte Morris  Patty Mills / Gary Trent Jr.
"Wiggins, Wiseman, 7, and 14 to Toronto for OG and Gary Trent Jr, who says no? (not sure if Trent can even be moved in a deal like this via Sign and Trade)"
"Depends on the direction they want to go. If they’re trying to contend now then probably not but if they want to rebuild then they should do it. Siakam is 27, he doesn’t really match up with a rebuilding team. I think a rebuilding team surrounded by Gary Trent jr, OG Anunoby, Jalen Suggs??(4th pick), Wiseman, Bouknight?? (7th pick), Giddey?? (14th pick), and Malachi Flynn is actually pretty formidable. Obviously I don’t know how the picks will turn out but that has potential to be a scary team in the future"
"&gt;	Zach Collins as the lottery pick  &gt;	Trading away Gary Trent Jr  &gt;	Traded 2021 pick to Houston   &gt;	Only young people on the team are Anfernee Simons (good), Nassir Little (eh) and CJ Elleby (no)  If the Blazers don’t win it then we’re not going to have a good time"
"You’re correct that Ingram mostly shoots 3s above the break both this year and last.  But Ingram took 1.5 more catch and shoot 3s per game than pull up 3s and shot 43.2% on them. And while he attempted less than he had the previous year, he was still making only .4 per game fewer than last year.   He averages more made catch and shoot 3s than Huerter, Gallinari, Ingles, Reggie Jackson and Seth Curry and the same as Gary Trent Jr, Mikal Bridges, and Norman Powell."
" * Coach Nate McMillan leaves for House Hawks and is on the brink of being eliminated from the Eastern Finals.  * House Suns wins the West for the first time since 1993.  * New fevers spread across the west.  The Reggie Jackson fever and the Deandre Ayton fever.  Khwai fever hasn't been cured.  * House pistons win the Lottery.   * The blazers house chapter:   Blazers obtain Norman Powell at the cost of Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr.  House Blazers gets eliminated and Coach Stotts gets banished after a long tenure.  Chauncey Billups of house Clippers takes Stotts place as a controversial hire.   Zach Collins reinjured his ankle and is still unable to contribute to the team.  Teams are in belief that Blazers might not be far away from blowing up and are sending messengers.  House Blazers are getting messages from house 76ers, and house Celtics about blowing up the team (Dame, CJ, Norman Powell)."
Gary Trent Jr in Rip City
I want you guys to get Gary Trent Jr
"I have a feeling Norm Powell for Gary Trent Jr. will be like this. The Blazers didn’t want to pay Gary Trent Jr., so they traded him for Norman Powell . . . who has a very similar game to Gary Trent Jr., but is five years older AND Powell is a free agent who’ll likely command as much, if not more, than Trent."
"I don’t get why the Raptors would be interested in Lillard since that seems like a Portland situation all over again except Lillard will probably want to be traded as soon as he gets there.   That would be great for the TrailBlazers since they don’t have to worry about Lillards happiness but for Toronto it’s such a waste.   If you swap Lillard with Siakam and a few picks it’ll be a mess even if they re sign Lowry(who will be 36yrs old next season). Their top players would be Lillard, OG, Lowry, FVV and Gary Trent Jr.   They doesn’t even put them in the same class as Brooklyn, Milwaukee, and even Philly. Such a terrible trade for Toronto and Lillard."
Gary Trent jr
LMAO nah man I'd definitely opt to build a team around Gary Trent Jr. and Malachi Flynn
Ah well if Restricted Free Agent Gary Trent Jr. is there that changes everything. Thanks.
"I have a post from a while ago where I was trying to convince my parents (VERY into basketball but mostly watch HS and College women) that KP was actually supposed to be really good.  They were like  * Why does he only shoot 3's? * How come he won't post up Gary Trent Jr.? * Does he even *have* a post move? * Whenever he gets a rebound why does he just bring it down to his waist? * Does he give a shit?  And I was like ""no... you don't get it... so... uh... aw, fuck you're right."""
Why does EVERYONE forget about Gary Trent Jr. dude will be a starter.
Found Gary Trent Jr.'s account!
"Don’t forget about the 4th pick and Gary Trent Jr who is also 22, exciting young core ngl"
Isn't Gary Trent Jr a RFA lol? Of course he's gonna be back.
Jalen Suggs + OG + Gary Trent Jr + Wiseman + 7th overall pick is a pretty stacked young core
"Amazing work compiling this list! Great to see an overview. Just a noteworthy correction - For the Toronto Raptors, Gary Trent Jr is a restricted free agent rather than an unrestricted free agent."
"That roster's starting lineup swapped Moe / Chief for Roco / (any of DJJ / Collins / Melo / Gary Trent Jr / etc) since 2018. In 2018, that roster was 8th in defense. We can use better personnel. We didn't have a chance lately because we gave up the entire perimeter and fell asleep in the paint because teams rarely dared to try. I mean, the perimeter was always open.  We were worse than almost every tank this season. This roster used to be 8th."
"Partly sure, but we turned Dame, Roco, DJJ, Nurk, Gary Trent Jr, Norm Powell, a bunch of decent-to-good defenders into the *29th ranked defense in the league*. We spent MONTHS this season as the single worst defending team. We did worse than the Wizards. Worse than the Raptors. Worse than *every TANKING team in the league*.  We need a roster refresh sure but the Blazers defense looks like it came from a court appointed attorney who shows up late and hung over. Some of this is tactical. We deliberately give up 3s like they don't count. Giannis could go off on us from the perimeter. And damned if we don't look shocked every time they dare to drive anyway."
"They have a very talented roster. They were in the WCF 2 years ago - they got swept but should’ve taken at least 2 games of the Warriors that they choked away. A lot of differences in the roster, but it’s still built around Lillard and McCollum. Powell Nurk Covington Melo Kanter I think is on par with that 2019 squad - I think Gary Trent Jr for example is a bad loss but Blazers fans seem to think Powell is an upgrade so who am I to tell.  But the problems this year are exactly the same as in 2019. Too much reliance on Dame’s heroics, falling apart under pressure. Don’t forget Dame went for 55 (FIFTY-FIVE) against the Nuggets and still lost because the rest of the team couldn’t make something happen  This Blazers team is way better than their playoff performances. How much better idk but it wouldn’t surprise me if they make the finals or win it all because Dame is just that good and they have at the very least a 6 man rotation of capable impact players."
"Blazers. Folks were from Portland metro area, I've lived in Portland metro area dang near my whole life. All my family and friends were Blazer fans for the most part growing up and it was the only professional team we had back then so I started to pick it up as soon as I was old enough....about '95 when we had Gary Trent Sr, Kenny Anderson, JR Rider, Aaron McKie, Uncle Cliffy, Buck Williams etc. Transition period from Adelman era to Jailblazers and have been going strong ever since."
"The blazers have a pattern of trading away talent year after year and seldom let chemistry take hold. They traded Gary Trent Jr go , in the middle of the season who was on fire and consistently proved his worth and stats . I dare say we would have beat Denver with his play.   Neil hasn't been listening for years , just look at the players ,  still starting on other teams that he and management let go , for lesser talent that didn't pan out.  LaMarcus gave this city all he could and carried the blazers year after year , while we kept trading good guys for  greener grass. He finally had enough. Shame on the fans that disrespected his work here and booed him for leaving. Blazers need a strong power forward that can shoot trading McCollum won't solve the problem. The guy is amazing."
"I did. Which really adds to the point I was trying to make.  David West had a really good career. Was a 2x All Star and a big part of some of the most successful teams in New Orleans Pelicans (then Hornets) history, then was a big part of a couple runs to the ECF with Indiana, and then as an old guy still was able to contribute off the bench to two titles with GSW.  No one can guarantee me that any one of JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet will have a better career than David West, yet he never comes up when discussing 2003, to the point that I literally forgot to mention him."
"2018 is an unusually deep class. Although I don’t think it could yet be considered the greatest, you have to consider the later picks doing well: Mikal Bridges, SGA, MPJ, Huerter, Shamet, Brunson, Devonte’ Graham, Mitchell Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Bruce Brown, and SLAM DUNK CHAMPION HAMIDOU DIALLO"
"I mean, if we're going to talk about ""nice depth pieces"", then god,   2003 has: Chris Kaman, Boris Diaw, Leandro Barbosa, Josh Howard, Kyle Korver, Zaza Pachulia, Mo Williams, Matt Bonner, Luke Walton, Kirk Hinrich,  84 had: Sam Perkins, Alvin Robertson, Otis Thorpe, Kevin Willis, Jerome Kersey, Vern Fleming.   1996 had: Camby, Marbury, Antoine Walker, Kerry Kittles, Peja, Jermaine O'Neal, Big Z, Derek Fisher, Shareef Abdur-Rahim.  I just listed off a ton of guys who made 1-2 All Star teams, guys who started on teams that made multiple deep playoff runs, guys who won titles, guys who were solid starters for over a decade.  Like, no disrespect to any of the players you just mentioned, but you can find Robert Williams, Gary Trent Jr. and Landry Shamet caliber players in literally ever draft.  Unless a draft class goes like, all 60 players deep with ""nice depth pieces"", then ""depth pieces"" really don't matter in an argument on which draft class is the best."
"2018 has SGA as well  they also have a lot of depth pieces in JJJ, Mikal and Miles Bridges, Robert Williams, Gary Trent JR, Shake Milton, Landry Shamet"
"It’s insanely good. You have two superstars in Trae and Luka. Ayton right now I think is a star. There are potential/near stars in JJJ, MPJ, SGA, and Mikal Bridges (imo, though maybe a solid starter). Solid starters include Miles Bridges, Sexton, WCJ, and Huerter.   This is where it gets tricky, but the guys somewhere between solid starter and really good role player are bountiful, and a lot came in the second round: Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, DiVincenzo, Bagley, Shamet, Lonnie Walker, Bruce Brown, Jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, and Shake Milton.  I’m probably leaving out a few guys, which is a testament to how good a draft class it is. We need more time to see longevity and how many stars arise to truly rate it though."
And Gary Trent Jr
Lmao is it just me or does Gary Trent Jr. feel 30 already
"A few more solid players to add to that list: Okogie, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr, Anfernee Simons, Robert Williams, Melton, Duncan Robinson, Kendrick Nunn… yeah that draft class was really solid all around."
Gary Trent Jr.
"Nice situation to be in, that's for sure. I imagine that Lowry's gone at this point. Lack of a true starting center is hard to swallow though.  FVV/Suggs/OG/Pascal/Khem Birch  Flynn/Gary Trent Jr/Boucher  Not bad, not bad at all."
"Trae/Shai/Doncic/Bridges/Ayton is actually a pretty ideal modern NBA lineup, damn. That easily wins the chip, especially if the bench has other 2018 guys like MPJ, Sexton, Donte, Huerter, JJJ, Robert Williams WCJ  Trae/Sexton/Donte   Shai/Huerter/Devonte Graham  Doncic/Gary Trent Jr/ Bruce Brown  Bridges/MPJ/JJJ  Ayton/Robert Williams/WCJ   Fuck that’s sexy"
Gary Trent Jr lights us up every damn time. I’m happy that mf got shipped east.
"&gt; Because my original point was about building a title contender and what players are capable of beingthe best player... like Kawhi in 2019. You're literally not following the thread of what I've said. Nobody said those dudes suck or that will better health yall aren't a playoff team. Are you saying losing in the second round is noteworthy? The Sixers will be ecstatic to find that out.  I followed the thread of what you are saying, I disagree with trading Siakam so you can roll the dice and maybe get a player as good as him in the future especially when any picks we get in return for him will most likely be late lottery or protected firsts. It isn't something we've done with our current front office regime and it was a success in the end. And if we trade Siakam for what would amount of some meh first-rounders might as well trade everyone not named OG, Flynn and Green as well and just go into an extended rebuild rather than attempting a retool. It also isn't that likely that we'd get a player better than Siakam with any mid to late first-rounders we'd get from trading him.  Losing in Game 7 of the second round after your All-Star + All-NBA player goes into a terrible uncharacteristic slump after not touching a ball during lockdown in Toronto in a Disney World bubble during a pandemic is the tiniest bit different than the Sixers losing in game 7 of the second round after Embiid gets injured again and Ben Simmons does a playoff Ben Simmons thing.  &gt; are you trying to win a title or just not be in the lottery because that core is not the former and you know it. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years. And that's before getting into the fact you're going to have to pay some of them in the next few years.  A core with playable centres that had the 2nd best record in the league last year. That's beyond just ""not be in the lottery"". Re-tooling by looking to rectify a weakness that killed us this year (no centres), putting whichever Jalen we draft through the famed Raptors development program and continuing to develop our young guys on top of a core that outside of a pandemic and Disney World bubble was an elite team &gt;&gt;&gt; blowing it up cause apparently 27 is too old.  Who would we have to pay in the next few years? Siakam and FVV are locked in until 2023-24, OG until 2024-25, Flynn's two year team option has him locked in until 2023-24. The players that we have to pay now or soon are Lowry who is a UFA, Boucher who has one more year under contract, Gary Trent Jr who is an RFA, Jalen Harris who is coming off his two-way contract now and if we want to resign them Khem Birch and Stanimal. Based on our current contracts and cap holds, we have the 4th highest practical cap space after OKC, Spurs and Knicks so having to pay some of our players who are really just Trent Jr, Harris, Boucher and Lowry isn't a concern."
Why is no one mentioning Gary Trent Jr?  he's younger than FVV and has a higher ceiling imo
Gary Trent Jr literally exists to murder the Lakers.
It's probably guys like Terry Rozier and Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr
"Now that his trade value has taken a historic dive they HAVE to trade him immediately, right?  Ben, Maxey and picks for Gary Trent Jr, who says no?"
"Its not the same story.  Our starting lineup before Luka was: a rookie Dennis smith jr,W Matthews,Barnes,DFS before he got good and and an old Dirk.Our bench was also ass.  Yall have right now Siakam an all star,Lowry and Vanvleet 2 borderline all stars,OG Anunoby and Powell before u traded him for Gary Trent Jr.  A team like this dont deserve a top pick because they shouldnt even be at the bottom in the 1st place."
"Also Sexton, Shai, Gary Trent Jr, Shake Milton, Shamet and Donte Divincenzo"
"2016: Siakam  2017: OG (not really any better picks after him)  2018: had no picks that year, so I'll use Spur's pick, which they got in the Kawhi trade. It would probably be Gary Trent Jr  2019: Dewan Hernandez??? (59th pick lol)  2020: Malachi Flynn or Desmond Bane, no player late in this draft showed that much promise as of yet."
2014 Zach LaVine instead of Randle  2015 Devin Booker instead of Russell   2016 Ingram was fine  2017 Jayson Tatum instead of Lonzo Ball   2018 Gary Trent Jr instead of Mo Wagner
"Doing it by year:   2016: no one 2017: Donovan Mitchell 2018: SGA, Miles or Mikal Bridges, MPJ and 2nd round Mitch Rob or Gary Trent Jr 2019: RJ Barrett 2020: Tyrese Haliburton, Quickley"
I wonder what Gary Trent Jr is gonna do with his spalding basketball tattoo....
like why are you even commenting when you didn't watch any of the games - he was like 5th on the team in touches vs the clippers  for the amount of touches he got he was scoring about as good as anybody in the league did this year...which would be gary trent jr who spent half the year on the bench
Is the Norman Powell for Gary Trent Jr a good trade for you guys?
Gary trent jr pushed shroeder and got 0 fines ejections suspensions while fvv and deandre who left thr bench get suspended lol.
Gary trent jr is a free man. Man pushed shroeder snd got 0 fines ejections or suspensions but fvv and deandre get suspended for leaving the bench. Nba stay inconsistent
Pistons and Thunder are going to return to the playoffs before the Warriors do  Gary Trent Jr will be a top 20 player in 2-3 years
because Gary Trent Jr was the one who basically instigated and screamed at Shro making Anunoby think Shro was doing anythign even remotely bad.
"“dam right” - TJ Warren, Gary Trent Jr"
&gt; It's not escalation if what you did is less egregious than what they did.  Escalation can be (and in this case is) when someone enters the altercation when they weren't there to start.  He escalated the situation by running at Gary Trent Jr and shoving him when he (Harrel) was not part of the original altercation.  Trent Jr was standing literally right next to both of those guys when it happened.  Trez wasn't.  This is exactly why the refs kicked out Trez.  Your explanation doesn't make sense based on how the NBA enforces this stuff.  Trez escalated it by entering himself into the altercation that he wasn't a part of to begin with.
"Trezz immediately started shoving Gary Trent Jr, not OG. He was absolutely just escalating, not having his guy’s back."
"But he was ejected for going after Gary Trent Jr. who hadn't done anything.  If he shoved OG that's one thing, but he came in like a bat out of hell and attacked an entirely innocent player, haha.  Of course he got ejected."
"For a second I thought to myself, when did Patty Mills start playing for Toronto? Then realized that's Gary Trent Jr. lol"
Not exactly sure why he shoved Gary Trent jr.
Yeah defending Schroder... by way of shoving at Gary Trent Jr who was just standing there. Why Harrell was trying to pick a fight with Gary instead of OG made no sense.
"Gary Trent JR, Greatest Toronto (j)Raptor confirmed."
The fact that Harrell saw OG do the action then proceeded to push Gary Trent Jr.
but dwight got a T he already had 1 thats why he was tossed due to the 2nd T. Harrell should got a T and that  should been it and Gary Trent jr should got a tech and the raptor wqho came off the bench in street clothes should of got T'd up and tossed for leaving bench area.
there was a raptor who came off the bench andx the refs ignored  thta and the fact Gary Trent jr shoved a bunch of people more than harrell and the refs ignored that. Just some bad refs imo.
"Masai was really bad last offseason only getting Baynes for a center and imo should’ve traded Lowry but what else do we depend on man, we ain’t LA or Florida. Gary Trent Jr is a really good get, but we are still too good to tank and still to shit to compete"
Norman the doorman Powell is an upgrade over Gary Trent Jr
"And his son, Raptors legend Gary Trent Jr."
"OG was a clown for that. Especially since Schroder was clearly keeping OG from falling &amp; injuring himself. Plus wth was Gary Trent Jr doing coming in &amp; shoving Schroder? Respect to Harrell (shouldnt been tossed , maybe a tech but thats it)"
Lowry and FVV both out with injury (starters) and OG (starter) was ejected in the 1st quarter. Toronto was missing 4 other players as well. Only starters in this game was Siakam (second night of a back to back and he's having a rough time getting his conditioning back pre-COVID infection) and Gary Trent Jr.
ITT: Gary Trent Jr is a loyal dog for sticking up for teammates. Montrezl is a thug for getting involved.
Yo... As much as I do and will miss Norm... Gary Trent Jr is a boss motherfucker...
"I see Gary Trent Jr pushing, and I see Gary Trent Jr moving  Trez about to shove the entire province of Ontario"
There's no rule against a Gary Trent Jr playing basketball
"I don't get how you can be 6'5"" and athletic and as bad of a defender as gary trent jr, he kind of just wanders around the court"
"Lakers for most practical purposes might not be in a position to make much $$ free agent signings under the salary cap. (ie they would have to waive rights to much of their team and depth to do so) Their one mid cap exception  would be ideally a hedge against schroeder leaving, and secondarily likely for shoring up center position. It's much more likely that they would be into the luxury tax  They are much more likely to have to plan around their own free agents, and trades and then minimum exceptions/buy outs etc   In other words, Gary [Trent](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/trentga02.html) Jr is unlikely to e signed as a free gent by the Lakers."
Gary Trent Jr up in the mix like the dog he is... love that dude.
I don't understand how they ejected Trezz but not Gary Trent Jr
You can do whatever you want if Gary Trent Jr. has your back.
Gary Trent Jr. Is a Klutch athlete and a free agent this year
Gary Trent Jr still shook from the skirmish from earlier
Raptors on a back to back missing FVV and Lowry? Raptors by 20 confirmed. Probably a 35 pt Gary Trent Jr game too
"Fr fr! Was super happy with the western conf once Gary Trent Jr. was traded, what a problem!"
"Gary Trent Jr  But actually, Dame"

Gary Trent Jr. Would like to have a word.
Gary Trent Jr.! He has already has anime hair and style.
"I think I'm in the minority here, but I think Gary Trent Jr is one of the best judges of a baseball player."
Does Gary Trent Jr Understand The Grind Too?  Well played.
“Does Gary Trent Jr. understand the grind”  Oh man he is the grind. I’m going to enjoy watching Raptors fans fall in love with the guy.
"Yeah, haha, it's not like a yolo from Gary Trent Jr is a better chance than our half court offense!  ...uh oh..."
"Fuck yeah, that's the Gary Trent Jr. I know and love."
He deserves the opportunity and Portland is covered at guard for years.  RIP city will always love Gary trent jr.
He turned down a $15million/year contract extension this offseason so he's definitely banking on making more than that per year.  Miss GTJ :(  But I do love Powell as well.     Edit: [Well actually 14.2 million/year on average.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/12/11/report-gary-trent-jr-declined-trail-blazers-extension-offer/)
Gary Trent Jr  Got The Juice
Thoughts and prayers for Neto's recovery from the savage mauling he took at the hands of Gary Trent Jr.   I wonder if he'll ever recover from that savage elbow.
Gary Trent Jr last 3 games:  First game- career high  Second game- second highest plus minus in NBA history   Third game- game-winning buzzer beater  What's he got in store for the Lakers tomorrow?
"Gary ""Get that garbage outta here"" Trent JR looking like Damian Lillard with that shot."
Love Gary Trent Jr. He might not have quite the skill of Powell (yet) but it sure looks like he has a better basketball IQ.
#GARY TRENT JR IS A BAD MAN
WELCOME TO TORONTO GARY TRENT JR.!
"Gary Trent Jr. getting those superstar calls xD  I'll allow it and tell myself it was a make-up call for the ""charge"" on Siakam."
Gary “One Punch Man” Trent Jr  Freaking MURDERS Neto lmao
Gary Trent Jr is a good basketball player.
I I hope Gary Trent Jr ends up being one of Toronto’s best trade acquisitions ever. Good start
GARY. TRENT. JR!

Gary Trent Jr. is the greatest Raptor in franchise history.
Fuckin Gary Trent Jr!
GARY TRENT JR !!!!
I love Gary Trent Jr!
"Why have him at the 2 when gary trent jr is there, why would I have subpar shooter like oubre who isn't a better defender than Gary take his spot. And to top it all off oubre will be much more expensive."
Gary Trent Jr
"They don’t need a superstar. They need quality starters and depth. Vucevic, Gordon, Powell, Gary Trent jr, Wendell Carter jr, Theis, Otto Porter jr, Olynyk, and Gary Harris all got flipped at the deadline. Not to mention all the players that were traded at the last deadline or in the offseason.  At some point you have to pull the trigger. All of those guys are high quality NBA players unlike the everyone on the Warriors bench. If the Warriors don’t trade their own pick this offseason, then it’s clear they’re not trying to win. There is zero argument for drafting another project."
"I usually agree but VC is a nickname that's actually valid because he's been called that for a minute  The most egregious nickname I heard recently was some dudes casually calling Gary Trent Jr. 'Gare Bear', lmfaooo, I hate this sub"
Gary Trent Jr.
"If looking at 2021, Brunson is a step above Gary trent Jr. if using per 100 or per 36. Trent has better per game stats at over 5 more minutes per game, but Brunson shoots even from 3, way better from 2 and at the line, and has a better offensive AND defensive rating, all while playing back up. They are still both very close, and it will take a few years to see."
"Harden (PG), Lebron (SF), Giannis (PG), Jokic (C).  SG is kind of hard to pick, but I think the overwhelming consensus is Gary Trent Jr."
"Add Gary Trent Jr to the list of defensive sieves seeing a lot of minutes. Love the guy, and he sorta always *looks* like he's not bad at D, but, well, he is."
"I know Norman Powell's great and all, but I honestly prefer Trent Jr. over him. He's a better shooter, younger and is likely going to have the same sort of market this FA that Powell has, but he's also a RFA iirc. Just someone to keep going forward, I'd rather have Gary."
How do we know this is Gary Trent Jr.?  His identity is hidden to protect him.
Rookie Gary Trent Jr played all 48 minutes of a comeback win agaibst the Kings at the end of the 2019 season. It was also the first time he even got real minutes in a NBA game iirc.  That's probably not the most recent but it's the most recent I can recall
"I'm not really sure how good a defense a coach is realistically expected to generate with Dame, CJ, Robert Covington, Gary Trent Jr. Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter lead the team in minutes so far this season.   Some of that is on the coach for managing rotations, but a lot of that is injuries and personnel."
Interesting fact: Gary Trent Jr. is now 2nd in  +/- for a single game in nba history just behind Mbah a Moute.

Gary “2nd highest single game +/- of all time” Trent Jr
All I know about Gary Trent Jr is that I can’t tell the difference at a glance between him and Patty Mills.
I don't like every spelling out the 'Jr' part of his name. It makes him a different person. Gary Trent Jr is a different person than Gary Trent Junior.
Gary Trent Jr greatest of all time?
Imagine trying to stop Gary Trent Jr.
"Pascal got to the rim whenever he wanted, I've noticed this season he's went away from the finesse moves, now if he thinks he strong than his defender he just runs them over, so much fun to watch.   Also Gary Trent Jr. That's all."

"Great observation. His foul trouble was one of the main things besides health, that we needed him to work on to help get him to the next level. Him fouling less and still being aggravated has been a great sign. Hopefully he can keep it up and be the player we want him to be! Hey, and Gary Trent Jr would've made a big impact tonight and Barnes has a bright future ✊🏾"
Is Desmond Bane someone that could be a solid 2nd option someday?  Looking forward to this Raptors squad once Gary Trent Jr and OG Anunoby are both back.. Scottie Barnes looks great
"When there is parity, everybody seems mediocre.   That's how parity works.   But these teams aren't bad. Look at the Pacer (7-13). They are over .500 since their slow start, and they got some serious talent: and ROY candidate in Duarte, Brogdon, Sabonis, Turner, Holiday, LaVert.   There's a lot of talent there.   The Raptors? 9-12, but they got Barnes (also an ROY candidate) with FVV, OG, Gary Trent Jr, Siakam getting back to form. The bench is a little thin, but their core rotation players are killing it defensively."
"uh, what? we definitely used him as a shooter too, he just wasn't as good as he is now and we had better bench guards coming in (can't remember how the years line up, but it'd either have been seth curry or when we drafted ant simons/gary trent jr and both are/were worth keeping over pat)  i will always love patty c though, my first and only flair"
Would you trade Drose for Gary Trent Jr or Jevonte Carter?
Gary Trent Jr. McDonald's All-American to 2nd round pick
If only we could find a Gary Trent Jr type player.  Bummer we didn’t keep GP2 around either.  He’s always been an insanely athletic defensive minded guard.  I will take solace in being happy for him now that he’s getting PT and making his minutes count for a championship caliber team.  Just wish he could be doing that in red and black but I suppose I will just have to look forward to seeing GP3 light it up for the Beavers someday…

"This is going to sound like a real homer pick and idk if he counts since hes technically 24.3 but I've seen enough to believe OG could be a future all star. He should definitely be in the mix if eligible. But agree with most of the obvious picks.   I'd order them as follows from most to least likely to nab future all star selections. I'm taking current situation into account so team success and team role play a factor. Also, * indicates that an all star selection was  already achieved so I'm choosing to rank these guys at the top of the list regardless of whether a non-all star shows more potential:   1. Luka Doncic*  2. Jayson Tatum*  3. Trae Young*  4. Zion Williamson*  5. Bam Adebayo*  6. Ja Morant  7. LaMelo Ball  8. Anthony Edwards  9. Cade Cunningham  10. Evan Mobley  11. Shai Gilgeous Alexander  12. OG Anunoby  13. Jaren Jackson Jr  14.

Gary Trent Jr has been a revelation since going to the raptors
"Everyone's talking about Precious Achiuwa's 3rd quarter, but what about Gary Trent Jr.'s 4th?"
Our franchises became friends last year after the Norman Powell / Gary Trent Jr. trade.  We are the North.
"There's no way this list is based on how good they are today, right? Please tell me it's a estimate of how good they'll all be when they're age 24, because then it's only a bad list instead of one of the worst ones I've ever seen  Also Gary Trent Jr is better than half these guys"
"Building on this: for this very reason, I don’t particularly like Gary Trent Jr. Our play-by-play guy (who is otherwise terrific) calls him “Trent Junior” every time he’s doing anything on the court. Not only is that too many syllables, it’s wrong.  It’s then forced me to question whether announcers are calling guys by their last name (which is likely what they’re doing) vs. just reading the backs of their jerseys (which is insane). Does he think the dude’s name is “First name: Gary, Last name: Trent Junior”?? Just be consistent and call guys by their fucking last name or first name. The “junior” only needs to be there if you’re saying his whole name!"
Scottie Barnes  OG Anunoby  Pascal Siakam  Fred VanVleet  Gary Trent Jr  Precious Achiuwa  Khem Birch  Dalano Banton  Would be the likely list I imagine.
I forgot how insane it is that the Raptors ended up with OG Anunoby and Norman Powell (which became Gary Trent Jr) for just Greivis Vasquez
Gary Trent Jr looks like Patty Mills.
"Look at Gary Trent Jr. He was the 37th pick and plays for the raptors who developed siakim, Fred van vleet, OG anunoby into emerging all stars.   Gary trent Jr is currently ranked 3rd in effective shooting behind curry and Durant. And leads the league in deflections. Currently ranked 3rd for DPOY."
Owned him in fantasy and traded him for Gary Trent jr. Feel awesome about it. Not great for rb and assists. Have watched some games. He’s not the playmaker you think he is but he can score in spades.
"Honestly, I could see Gary Trent Jr turning into a star. I extremely doubt him turning into anything more than a star, but I can see him getting getting an All-Star game under his belt during his career given how much better he's doing this year in regards to being a complete package.   I like OG, but I don't see him going Superstar either. Maybe an all-star game, but I see him more focused on his defensive skills and thus less likely to get the splashy play that would get him the All-Star nods."
"Gary Trent Jr. annoyed me last year with his tendency to take ridiculous shots that he had no business making except now he makes enough of them and plays good enough defense that I just go ""yes, please, keep doing that, that's incredibly good, actually"".  I used to make fun of PG13 a lot, but damn he's really proved me wrong over the past few months."
Gary Trent Jr. -  Because I picked him for my keeper league fantasy team and I need him to be a superstar. TBH he's showing flashes of it now
"Unfortunately it’s looking like Gary Trent Jr is more likely. Wish he’d have been kept, not sure how much more Powell added."
gary trent jr
I’m still holding on to my Justise Winslow stocks. But real answer: Gary Trent Jr
"Gary Trent Jr, i dont think he could be a superstar but maybe a small level below."
There are mentions of Kuminga and Garland in this thread.  But I guess if we're not talking lottery picks then I'd say Gary Trent Jr.
Wish we signed Gary Trent Jr to a longer deal lol
The body building physique isn’t an effective one for basketball. Would be difficult to have the cardio for basketball with all that muscle. Probably why Gary Trent jr. doesn’t look like his dad.
"Dejounte Murray, Marcus Smart, Lonzo Ball, and Gary Trent Jr. are all guards who are better defenders than curry too.  &gt;Not to mention, through 15 games Stephs D isnt bad and could improve, it has been anyway  His defense has been solid for a few years, he exerts an impressive amount of effort on that side of the ball. It's part of what separates him from players like Lillard. He's still not close to being an all-defense selection though.  &gt;I dont think he will get all defense, but its just stupid to say he cant.  I didn't say he can't. I said it'd be possibility because voters love him (e.g. 3rd place in MVP voting as a non-playoff team last year). I could definitely see him getting the nod over somebody more deserving like Vanvleet or Trent Jr."

"I feel like at that point Gary Trent Jr is your fifth as your 2 and you do small ball, with OG or Simmons at the 5."
"He just got back from an injury, it'll take him some time to adjust, especially since Gary Trent Jr and OG have taken big steps and Barnes is playing like a veteran.  It'll take the Raptors some time to integrate Siakam into their lineup."
I love Gary Trent Jr so much. This was the first game all season where his offense was as good as his Portland days. He's got such a bright future
how many steals per game tho? He should ask tips from defensive specialist Gary Trent Jr.
Does nothing better? Gary Trent Jr has more than 3x the steals as Powell this season.
"Gary Trent Jr. is leading the league in steals and deflections. If that's not a sign of being good at defense, what is?"
"He hit 4 of the top 5 DPOY last year.... I get you don't agree with him, but he's heavy numbers based, and this is what the early season numbers reflect...  Gary Trent Jr. leads the league in steals and deflections. How does that not matter to defense?  How would you recommend holding him accountable?"
"Idk what's been offered but it's hard to imagine that they're exclusively being offered nothing but 30 year olds that average 15 mpg or something, where they are definitively locked in as career bench players  There has to be something between 8th guy off the bench and 20 year old lotto pick with star upside. A solid starter for next 3 years has to be worth something to a team trying to contend.  Not him specifically, but thinking Gary Trent Jr type players who might not have star upside but also aren't locked in to a bench ceiling"
"Can somebody who watches the Raptors tell me why Gary Trent Jr is #3 in the DPOY race?  He was terrible at defense previously. I've seen clips of him really stepping it up as a guard defender this year, but #3 in DPOY? Is he looking like GP II out there for 35 minutes a game?  Whats happening?"
Gary Trent Jr. coming for Jamal Murray’s crown as the best defender in the league
Gary Trent Jr apparently
"People are being nice here but Gary Trent Jr does not deserve to be on this fucking list whatsoever, even with his defensive leap"
Gary Trent Jr is the bane of my existence
"Trading Gary Trent Jr draft, right? That's what we're talking about... RIGHT?!"
- Gary Trent Jr  - LaMelo Ball  - Evan Mobley  - Montrezl Harrell  - Cole Anthony  - Richuan Holmes   - Grayson Allen  - Tyler Herro   - Dejounte Murray  - Jonas Valanciunas
"This season, due to his injury, he wasn't really pushing the pace or trying to draw contact, especially when he was getting smacked and the refs weren't calling anything. Yeah the 3 pt, jump into your defender rule is a good change. But refs took it so far and personally that for a while they weren't calling anything at all for Harden, even when it was clearly a foul or even intentional. I think it was the Raptors game where Gary Trent Jr. (I believe, not 100% sure) fouled him on purpose and they didn't even call it."
Gary Trent Jr definitely comes to mind
I like how Gary Trent Jr was posing like his shot wasn’t a brick
Imagine not putting Gary Trent jr
Gary Trent Jr and Caruso could get their first All-Defense awards this year. Paul George gets even more statistical backing for an MVP argument if sustained.
"He’s not starting and his defense is too similar to Gary Trent jr, whose offense is superior. Never Caruso"
"Probably more to do with the officiating change. Gary Trent Jr. is another example of a guard taking a big defensive leap (leading in steals), but honestly he gets away with a lot more contact now."
"Dort, Gary Trent Jr, Lonzo, Caruso     Your 2020-2021 All-NBA Defense guards"
I cannot tell you how happy I am that Gary Trent Jr is now in the eastern conference.

The possession before this he drove and kicked to Gary Trent Jr in the same corner for a 3.
I thought Gary Trent Jr was at least in his late 20s or something....He's 22?!?!?
GARY FUCKING TRENT JR
GARY TRENT JR!
Insane how the Kings 2nd round pick in 2018 (Gary Trent Jr) is a better player than their #2 pick.

"Have you seen Gary Trent Jr. play this season. He his a beast in defence and lead the league in steals. He is only 22, plenty of time to improve his offence a little bit."

Kuzma is averaging more rebounds a game than Embiid.  Gary Trent Jr is leading the league in steals per game and is 2nd in deflections  Jaden McDaniels has the same amount of fouls as he does points

Gary Trent Jr leading the league in Steals
Gary Trent Jr
"Miles Bridges, Tyler Herro (didn't expect him to be this good)  Gary Trent Jr as well, look better on defense.  Many star players arent playing as well as I thought except KD, Jokic and Giannis.  GPII, OPJ and Bjelica looks really good in Warriors system.  Team wise: Warriors and Wizards surpassed expectstions"
Gary. Trent. Jr.
Gary Trent Jr
"Really weird game from the Raps. Too many iso plays and defensive breakdowns. We usually move the ball much better than this and have much better defensive rotations. But some great positives to take away, Siakam looked good, Scottie Barnes is not scared of anybody on defense, and Gary Trent Jr. turning into DeMar DeRozan is just an added bonus lol."
"dont worry mods will remove any post related to it until twistedlogic submits his with the caption ""Gary Trent Jr EDUCATES absolute DULLARD James Harden on how to play DEFENSE with STRENGTH and FACTS !"""
What's worse is Gary Trent Jr was literally trying to foul him because he knew he got beat and they still didn't see it.
Yo what the actual fuck how was that not a foul on Gary Trent Jr?  That's actually ridiculous
"I'm not mad that we lost, I'm mad/confused why that was a Gary Trent Jr and Sexton jump ball at the end? Either foul or travel"
"&gt;Gary Trent Jr. still looking like a potential future all star  hotter take than rookie Kuzma looks like a potential future all star, lets slow down a little."
"Never fucking doubt Masai, I keep saying it.  Scottie looking amazing on and off the court, Gary Trent Jr. still looking like a potential future all star, Freddy and OG keep getting better and better, and we still haven't played with Siakam this season. Loving this rebuild, feel like in 2/3 years and maybe a trade or two and we'll be fighting amongst the best again"
And it was between 6’6 Gary Trent jr and 6’1 Collin sexton….  Was literally most beneficial to the raptors to call it a jump ball
"I mean, you also had 6’6 Gary Trent Jr lose a jump ball to 6’1 Collin Sexton. But if you wanna cry refs and lucky shot, sure"
"Y’all crying how it was a jump ball? How does 6’6 Gary Trent Jr lose a jump ball to 6’1 Collin sexton.   It was either a jump ball or Collin keeps possession, he lost control of the ball and got it back….  If anything, the jump ball should’ve been beneficial to toronto because of the height difference….."
GARY TRENT JR HUSTLE FOR THE FING BALL
"Yeah I think the entire top 4 got their guy. Raptors young core is prolly set with Precious, OG, Scottie and Gary Trent Jr. Talented guys  Cavs are in the top 4 every year, it’s not even fair anymore lol. Hope we can get one more piece in the lottery this year.  Suggs has been really rough on offense tho. His halfcourt offense has always been a question mark, hope he shakes it off tho.  This rookie class is amazing"
"Voting Gary Trent Jr for Most Improved would be a next level woke move for one of those ""defense matters as much as offense"" guys, he would deserve it too"
Portland: We have a small duo of guards we should get a wing. Also Portland: Let's trade Gary Trent Jr. For a Smaller player
Gary trent jr  The similarities have been pointed out previously
"Its only been 8 games, and even then 3 years ago we had 2018. You know, the draft with two top 15 players already, the 3rd best player in a finals team and thats still leaving out Shai Gilgeous Alexander, Michael Porter Jr, Colin Sexton, Miles Bridges, Mikal Bridges, Gary Trent Jr., Donte Divincenzo, Devonte Graham, Jaren Jackson Jr, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen, Kevin Huerter, Hamidou Diallo, Lonnie Walker IV, Landry Shamet, and Mitchell Robinson. Also Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson as undrafted players."
Gary Trent Jr.   He's averaging nearly 3 steals a game.
"Ahh shit, I thought we’re talking about the triplets Gary and Trent and Jr   Gary and Jr had a decent night but Trent was a shifty mofo with them steals"
Gary Trent Jr 100% dudes averaging like 3 steals a game this year
Lmao the opposite for the Blazers other than Gary Trent Jr who is going to be a big baller in the coming years.  All the other blazers just fall off the face of the earth when they move
Gary “Gary Payton” Trent Jr.
I love Gary Trent jr
Gary Trent Jr. for all those taking time to decipher stupid acronym nicknames
It'll probably be KJ especially after his Olympic's experience. I'm high on OG but Gary Trent Jr is more likely to have a 'breakout' year than OG is imo
I would say that the Gary Trent Jr. contract from this offseason is his basement barring something horrible happening next season.  Brunson is a good player &amp; should get starting guard/high end 3rd guard $$$.  If he breaks out this coming year it's not hard to see him getting more.
"You're missing Shai, he's got just under a million   Edit: also Gary Trent Jr   Edit: Malachi Flynn too"
"Started coming of basketball watching age immediate post Clyde/pre Sheed Blazers. 1995 or so. JR Rider, Gary Trent Sr., Kenny Anderson, Uncle Cliffy (RIP), Sabonis, etc etc."
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr
"The sticker price looks big but then considering it doesn’t kick in until next year it isn’t that much more than other solid starting 2 guards like Gary Trent Jr, Evan Fournier, Bogdan Bogdanvich, etc have gotten recently.   Terry was our best clutch shooter (well him and Devonte) so I’m ok with it. We weren’t going to have max cap space next year anyways since we need to sign Miles Bridges to an extension too."
"Houston will be awful defensively, Toronto will likely be good/elite on that end.  OG and Gary Trent Jr are better than KPJ, Tate or Gordon.  Scottie Barnes and Achiuwa are gonna be nice additions. If Dragic plays for them, they have a deep, versatile roster."
GSW:  2015: Norman Powell  2016: Malcolm Brogdon  2018: Gary Trent jr  2019: Kelvin Johnson (need a forward)  2020: Lamelo Ball
Gary Trent Jr. would a perfect 3&amp;D for the Lakers.
"I’d say maybe Gary Trent Jr, SGA, or Matisse"
"Toronto is easy.  Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Malachi Flynn, Scottie Barnes, Precious Achiuwa, Khem Birch  Everyone else is expiring or a project."
I think Gary Trent Jr and Gary Trent Sr lived in the same house. Same with Gary Payton Jr and Sr.
"Not sure how close they actually lived but Gary Trent Jr and Tre Jones both went to the same public high school in Minnesota and were close friends, so they had to have lived in the same neighborhood at least, if not the same block"
"2017 McDonald's All-American?   Notable NBA players from West: Trae Young, Ayton, Jaren Jackson, M Porter Jr, Gary Trent, Troy Brown  East: Bamba, Wendell Carter, Sexton, Lonnie Walker,  Mitchell Rob, Knox, Vanderbilt  MPJ was MVP and his team won 109-107"
John Collins 25  Evan Fournier 19.5  Spender Dinwiddie 18  Gary Trent Jr 17  DeMar DeRozan 28  Kyle Lowry 30  Jarrett Allen 20  Duncan Robinson 18  Tim Hardaway Jr 19  Normal Powell 18  Derrick Rose 14  Doug McDermott 14  I think 20 for Lonzo is fine
"That VanVleet/Malachi Flynn backcourt is small and concerning defensively. I don't really trust Ben Simmons, but his size and guarding ability would at the very least make us elite defensively. I think the Raptors' fortunes next season depend on Gary Trent Jr turning into a consistent scorer and OG becoming an elite 2-way player. I don't think Siakam is a reliable 1st-option scoring threat, but if we do trade him I don't think it will be during the offseason. You have to at least see what this current roster does before making any firm decisions."
"And right now they’re working to develop some of the young guys to overtake him in that pecking order. He’s #1 *right now*, but guys like Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. will overtake him in a couple years."
Gary Trent Jr............. He looked terrible to end the season.
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr. I'm expecting that Portland will regret trading him even more than most fans already do. Oh and fuck Neil Olshey. The blazers have the basketball equivalent of stage 4 cancer and our position is hopeless.
"I think Gary Trent Jr is better than a good chunk of young players that are considered to be future stars. Name one and I'll tell you if I think he's better than GTJ or not.   To start off though, I think GTJ &gt; MPJ"
Gary Trent Jr is the reason that I want to watch the Raptors from here on out
Brandon Ingram may not be that much of a reach but he really is one of my favorite guys and the correct answer to the question is Gary Trent jr.
Gary Trent Jr
I think Gary Trent Jr could be the next Ray Allen if he puts in the work.
Gary Trent Jr
Gary Trent Jr.   Went from 3rd fiddle behind one of the best scorers in the game to will be big part of Raps offense with much higher usage.
Gary Trent Jr as well.
Gary Trent Jr wants to know what he ever did to you.
"* Kawhi refused to sign extend for less than a max coming off his rookie contract, and the Spurs tried to lowball him at first.  * Jimmy refused 4/40m with the Bulls, and signed for 5/92m instead.  * Greg Monroe took a risk taking the QO because he wanted to get out of Detroit. Reportedly refused a 5y/60m contract (he denies this was offered). Ended up signing a max contract @ 3/50m  * Tobias turned down 4y/80m and signed for 5y/180m  * Will Barton turned down 4y/42m and signed for 4y/53m  * Gary Trent Jr rejected 4y/54m and signed for 3y/54m  * John Collins turned down 4y/90m and signed for 5y/125m"

"Neil Olshey is a top 10 GM in the league  Gary Trent Jr will be an all-star (this isn't super unpopular anymore now that he went to Toronto, but I've been saying it since last season)  Nassir Little also has all-star potential and will be a 6moy candidate this year  Presti had an awful offseason and he could've built a potential playoff team if he played his cards right (without trading any of his picks), and he's gonna waste SGA's career  Raptors are gonna be a top 6 seed"
Yeah not sure who’s going to get buckets for us… expecting to see a lot of Gary Trent Jr contested threes
"And?  We've got promising young prospects in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Malachi Flynn and Scottie Barnes. Aside from Wiseman, any prospects we got for Siakam would have to fight for minutes with them.  Also, for all of VanVleet's flaws, he's about as close to a cultural replacement as you can get for the juggernaut that was Lowry. Trading Siakam would compromise the franchise's relationship with FVV the same way trading DeMar compromised the relationship with Lowry, except there'd be no Kawhi to wash away the hurt feelings with on-court success."
Well their roster now has a glut of forwards and a relative weakness at guard. They seemingly love OG and just drafted Scottie Barnes in the top 5 who is another 3/4. Meanwhile the best SG on their roster is probably Gary Trent Jr.
"We made the same move after trading for and drafting Gary Trent Jr. We actually used our BAE to sign him to a 3 year deal which gave us full bird rights (which in turn, made him valuable enough to trade for Norman Powell who we just re-signed for 5 years, 18 million).  What I'm getting at is, deals like this can matter in a HUGE way."
"Under whom? Van Vleet? Gary Trent Jr? There's no way in hell they're both better than Dragic, did you not see the playoffs last year?"
Gary Trent Jr I'd assume
"Ah yes I forgot we had all star Siakam, Gary Trent jr, Vanvleet, (Dragic? Idk), Precious, OG, Scottie Barnes, Khem Birch, Boucher, Yuta, etc"
Gary Trent Jr could average 20ppg depending on how many shots he is takes
Gary Trent Jr.
"I was really sad to give up Gary Trent Jr last year honestly. He’s a bulldog and has so much swagger on the court, and he seemed like such good friends with everyone on the team. I always like his promos for the Blazers broadcasts too. I really like Norm too though which helps ease it."
"I don't know that the mods can do anything about this, but I'm incredibly sick of the gay jokes. I've seen others mention this too. Competitive sports is a masculine interest, and is typically popular with heterosexual men. It's tiresome to see so many comments viewing everything through a homoerotic lens. You're not gonna get this from a typical group of guys watching a game in real life. People are going to look at you like you are a freak if you start making jokes about Gary Trent Jr. making you question your sexuality (this was all over the toronto raptors subreddit for some reason). Why has this subreddit become a weird echo chamber for the homosexualization of basketball?"
"My top five  1. Gary Trent Jr   2. Kevin Porter Jr.  3. Lonzo Ball  4. Kelson Johnson  5. Kyle Kuzma  I feel like most of the people mentioned are   - Stars (Zion, Shai, Sabonis, Ja), and would need a 1st team All-NBA or an MVP to win  - Second Year (LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton), and would all need to be legitimate stars to win it since there is a bias   - Guys that will probably be mostly as good if not a little better (FVV, Ben, Fox)"

Gary Trent Jr. turned down 4/$54M for 3/$54M.  And on the flip side Lu Dort probably should not have taken 4/$5M
"Fvv and siakam are in their primes, they have the pieces IMO to win games and playoff rounds and their leaderships mo is to develop while winning as it should be.  That’s why they should have expectations. They can meet them because Birch’s fit as shown last year is what cp’s fit was to Phoenix this year. It answered their defensive hole and allows their proven championship caliber defenders to switch which maximizes them and on offence it gives them the roll man they needed. Gary Trent jr and fvv will have to bend their games to fit each other but they can do that. And if Scottie Barnes buys in he can develop off the bench with Malachi by trying emulate steph and draymond with a green light if they play hard defence in limited minutes.    I think they have the perfect recipe to win and they have winners top down in the organization. I dunno man"
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
"I mean, Gary Trent jr got the same amount of money per year and isn't as good as Norm, so I thin, Blazers paid a very fair market rate for him."
"It was, and as a Blazer fan, we're glad to have it. But it's a painful move to make.  This is a year where we desperately have needed to make big move and changes to our team, but we're already spending $95M of our salary on *four players*, $110M on five this year now that we've signed this deal. And the people making all that cash really are some of our best players, so trading them really isn't a top focus right now.  And if we didn't sign Norm to this new contract, it would mean that we traded off Rodney Hood and Gary Trent Jr. for &lt;6 months of Powell, which did not get us any further than the first round. Basically, we had to sign Norm to whatever contract he wanted, or the whole trade to bring him in would have been completely wasted, but at the same time... doing so pretty much kills our ability to make any other big moves.  He's def getting a good deal and I'm glad to have him, but there's no denying he's pretty much getting the deal we were forced to give him."
im still confused by this is powell more worthwhile to portland than gary trent jr? like they got rid of him cuz they werent going to be able to afford him and they signed the guy they traded him for for the same annual
You really think no one had the money nor the desire to sign Malik Monk to a better than minimum contract? New York  (and I believe at least one other team) offered Nunn more money than the Lakers. FOH. Gary Trent Jr will be worth the $18M. He's better than all those guys you listed including Monk and Nunn LMAO!
"I don’t think they’re ring chasing. There was not a lot of money left when they signed. The Lakers were smart in waiting for all the big money to be handed out before signing a couple of guys today. They may have missed out on someone yesterday but they’re able to get much better value today. It’s not their fault that someone decided to pay Zach Collins $8M a year, Kelly Olynyk $12M and Gary Trent Jr $18M a year."

"In both of those games, the Blazers won because Gary Trent Jr. and Melo over performed and put up 20+, and neither player is still with the Blazers. Also Sixers were missing Simmons and Curry in one of those games.  As for Harris, name me one player that Dame has ever played with that is better than Harris is currently."
"They should do a full rebuild imo and trade Siakam,Vanvleet and Boucher  OG,Gary Trent Jr,Precious Achiuwa,Scottie Barnes and whatever they get from Siakam,FVV and Boucher sounds like a good young core"
"In 2017 we Drafted Lauri ahead of Donovan Mitchell, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, and Jarrett Allen  In 2018 They were too good for the high lottery odds and didn't want to trade up in the Luka, Trae, Ayton draft. We took Wendell Carter over Collin Sexton, Shai Gilgegous-Alexander, Michael Porter Jr. And then took Chandler Hutchinson with Shamet, Robert Williams, Devonte Graham, Mitchell Robinson, and Gary Trent Jr still on the board.  In 2019 we were again too good to get the high lottery odds and missed out on Zion and Ja Morant. We Drafted Coby White over Cam Johnson, Rui Hachimura, PJ Washington and Tyler Herro.   2020 draft is still up the air, but again we were too good for the highest odds and just missed Lamelo, Edwards, and Wisemen"
Gary Trent JR Welcome to Toronto
"Gary Trent Jr.    Like his size and build more defensively, and higher future potential for offense."
Gary Trent Jr. I assume
Gary Trent JR
Gary Trent Jr.
"Equal to the yearly average of the Gary Trent Jr. contract. I get that GTJ is younger and has more potential than Norm, but the Raps had his bird rights which would have meant that they could have made a good offer to Holmes and then signed Norm after. As it stands right now, if they don’t find someone to take on Dragic, the Raptors have no space to sign a center."
Gary trent jr is still younger and lines up better with our core
18Mil per year like Gary Trent Jr. No wonder Norm tweeted 👀👀
"If Mavs want to go aggressive this FA, they could have gone after Fournier (will probably wait it out) or Norman Powell (needs some convincing to leaver the Blazers), or they could've gone for younger guys (and probably cheaper but can still be developed) like Gary Trent Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, or Malik Monk. But Mavs wants to play it safe I guess because once bitten, twice shy. They played the waiting game too many times in the past and got nothing from it."
"He will not make 20m/yr below is reasoning  Here's 5 relatively similar free agent's deals today:  Tim Hardaway Jr 4/74m - better then Oubre and proven fit w/ DAL, older  Gary Trent Jr 3/54M - Trent is better, younger, and more potential  Will Barton 2/35M - ~even, but older then Oubre and injury prone, also specifically fits really well with DEN when healthy.  Alex Caruso 4/37M - Oubre is better and younger (Caruso 28 wow)  Alec Burks 3/30M -Oubre is better and younger  So for 25 year old inconsistent Oubre with seemingly more potential to unlock, and GSW isn't totally convinced he fits in that well...  Oubre will not be getting 20M/yr. I see the Warriors low balling with the full MLE (~9M) (he'd likely do a 1/1+1 deal to prove himself for a bigger deal), or the Spurs/Pelicans/Thunder (only teams with capspace) offering a 2/22-28M deal (12-14M/yr) or 2+1 player option."
Damn they locked him in for 5? Better asset than Gary Trent Jr on 3 years with a players option. Who do y’all got as the better player though?
"I never watched him in Portland, but in Toronto, yeah he’s streaky. His midrange is his issue, which pulls down his average FG% quite a lot, but he broke multiple records in his first few games with us, including an 89% FG game.  Non-Midrange Averages In Toronto: 35% from 3 on 7.3 attempts 56% in the restricted area  Once he fixes his midrange or starts dunking more, his FG% will rise drastically and you can already see the potential because he does have some really efficient games, even if he also has inefficient ones. Just matters what type of shot he is going for that night.  Source: https://raptorsinsider.ca/sky-is-the-limit-for-gary-trent-jr-toronto-raptors-report-cards/"
"Gary Trent Jr, I fucking love you."
Gary Trent Jr is American Patty Mills
This is the guy that said 3 / $55M for Gary Trent Jr.
"Gary Trent Jr. would have been a much better fit, oh well"
"I’d die for Australian Gary Trent Jr, but I think he can get better money elsewhere"
"Gary Trent Jr, if we re-sign him, is going to feel like Conan when he got the Tonight Show but then the prime time Jay Leno Show was greenlit"
More that CJ/Nurk missed a combined 60/144 games.  Your 2nd and 3rd best players missing over 40% of the season is not ideal.  Gary Trent Jr was their 2nd option for a chunk of the year.  While he's not bad he shouldn't be the second option on a .500+ team.
"He should be looking for that contract, regardless of his representation.   &gt;but given he’s represented by Rich Paul -- no stranger to driving a hard bargain on behalf of his clients at Klutch  This line makes me feel like this is less about GTJ and more about Klutch.   Fuck that. Fuck Klutch. Fuck the conglomeration of basketball. But Gary Trent JR deserves 10-20mil. That is the market. Let's talk about the player, rather than the agent."
All the Raptors just kinda murder us the last 3 years. They just added Gary Trent jr who turns into prime MJ against us too. Scheduled loss every time.
gary trent jr?
It's your destiny to sign him and complete the Gary Trent Sr.  Jr. prophecy that will bring on the end of the world.
"I’m assuming Lowry to Miami and Lonzo to Chicago are pretty much done deals so eliminating them.   He hasn’t been talked about much compared to the other FA point guards but i’d LOVE if the knicks signed Reggie Jackson. He’d be cheaper than guys like lonzo and lowry and he can play really well off-ball which is perfect bc RJ and Randle will be playmaking a lot too.   Another guy id love is Gary Trent Jr, i feel i’ve been higher on him than consensus opinion. Solid defender and complete sniper that can also create his own shot a bit"
3 players  * Gary Trent Jr: Dude is gonna have a full season as a starter after leaving portland * Theo Maledon: Was on of my favourite players coming out of the draft * Deandre Hunter: Gonna take a big leap if he is fully healthy
"We had a gym teacher in HS that played college ball l I think, he had like hip replacement and basically couldn’t move well or jump. Somebody challenged him to a 3 point contest because they thought he was washed or some shit. Teacher basically told him like 3 times “you really want to do this?” It was only like 10 shots and the other guy made like 6 but my buddies said the teacher basically like waddles up to the 3 point line, gets the ball and like 10 times in a row shoots, flat footed, and just goes “wet” after every shot haha.    The only other story I have like that is watching pickup ball at a lifetime near my hometown. Lifetimes have a pretty serious basketball crowd that plays pickup there, and I know quite a few former college guys played. Think I saw Gary Trent Jr with his dad there once.  But in a pretty competitive gsme, this guy gets a rebound on the defensive side, goes coast to coast, and dunks, like 3 times in a row.  I said to the giy next to me like “what the absolute fuck, this dude is insane” and I guess it was his buddy cause he goes “yeah craziest thing is he hasn’t played in 3 months.”  Still think it was one of the most impressive athletic feats I’ve ever seen"
"For a star player? Solo shot creation. Luka, LeBron, Kawhi, KD, all do it at historically great levels.  The reason why Shai is so good at such a young age is that he's lowkey one of the best solo shot creators in the NBA. It's also the reason the Raptors struggle; the only ""solo shot creators"" we have are Kyle Lowry and Gary Trent Jr., the former of which is likely gone and the latter of which hasn't really grown into his skillset yet."
He's coming off $17.5/year contract.  Somebody will.   Gary Trent Jr. gonna ask for 20+ now too
"Hopefully hurts them since we'd be well above the cap if we traded for Simmons and that would be a problem if we wanted to re-sign Gary Trent Jr., poach for Allen or re-sign Khem Birch."
"I’m just getting out of thai prison for the last 4 years, I assume the East still runs through Cleveland?  For real tho, I hope the Raptors do snag Allen. FVV-Gary Trent JR.-OG-Siakam-Allen would be so much fun to watch!!"
There’s no way that the raptors accept McCollum for siakam especially when they’ll just re-sign Gary Trent jr
"I agree that you can do it, just that it’s not the norm. The Bucks only played 3 forwards since their starting SG Donte got injured.   The Raptors also have Gary Trent Jr. who they will likely re-sign, and he’d likely expect to start at SG.   The point isn’t that the Raptors can’t have a lineup with OG/Siakim/Barnes, just that they probably won’t start all 3 of those guys. If you’ve got 3 starting caliber forwards (assuming Barnes ends up that good) and you’re only starting 2 of them, it’s a lot easier to trade one than if you only had 2 in the first place."
Siakam. FVV. Gary Trent Jr. that one center that’s supposed to be good.
Gary Trent Jr.
We also could’ve drafted Gary Trent Jr but picked up Jacob Evans because he “was NBA ready.”
"He made like $5M last season. He played to a bigger deal but who knows. The market wants point guards right now, and norm Powell, gary trent Jr, and THJ are available and play the same spot. Signing with LA could mean just giving up 1 or 2 million (although I dont like when athletes give up salary)"
Gary Trent Jr.
"Alright here’s a fun, never gonna happen but would be cool hot take: The Bulls, no matter what off-season they have, will not come out of the east this year with the nets, bucks, 6ers, heat, etc built the way they are this year. I love em but it’s just not happening. Knowing and accepting this opens a crazy door.   Bulls receive:  4th OVR (TOR)  7th OVR (GSW)  James Wiseman  Gary Trent (S&amp;T)  Raptors receive:  Zach Lavine Andrew Wiggins 14th OVR (GSW)  Warriors receive: OG Anunoby Nicola Vucevic  This gives the bulls the perfect opportunity to start a super charged rebuild featuring White, Trent jr, PAW and wiseman + the 4th and 7th pick  This gives the Raptors a bonafide chance to compete in the east (this is where I’ll take the most hate), but FVV, Lavine, Wiggins, Siakam coached by Nick Nurse has a chance to compete in the east IMO. 14 is also a nice compensation all considered.   For the warriors it is the perfect last chance at the classic dynasty to compete. OG is the perfect wing in that offence and VUC is the perfect centre. They’d be well over the luxury tax but that team will still make money if competing.   Thank you for coming to my Ted talk."
Gary Trent Jr should be a tier 2
"Isaiah Thomas is the big one. And cousins was looking great in NOLA pre-injury.  But also we had Whiteside become an actual NBA player once he left (after some time in China or whatever), Bogdan who’s looked much better on the Hawks, Seth Curry before he became Steph v2, Gary Trent Jr...  There’s also guys that just seemed to sandbag a bit for us.. Rudy Gay, who wasn’t bad but not what we had expected, we had the worst version of Rondo, bad seasons from DeWayne Dedmon, Arron Afflalo, Ariza, and pretty much every 37 year old vet we’ve brought on (although it was pretty cool to have Vince Carter for a season)  It’s hard to say how much of it is the organization and how much is the players/bad luck. But after 15 years, it seems pretty clear to me that we are in fact Basketball Hell as Rudy Gay so accurately put it.  Luckily we seem to have turned a new leaf with Monte McNair, it’s only been a season and some change but it’s looked a looooot better.  So yeah in terms of who’ve we drafted, nobody’s gone on to have an all-star type season besides IT. But I wouldn’t at all be surprised to see Bagley make a huge (double) jump once he leaves Sac. Or Buddy for that matter"
"Kevin Huerter, Donte, Wendell, Simons, Shamet, ROBERT WILLIAMS, Mitch rob, Gary Trent jr, Devonte Graham, Brunson, Jevon Carter, Bruce Brown, Melton, Shake, Holiday, Allen and Walker arent busts"
"Gary Trent Jr isn't going to get $20m, I sure as hell don want to be the team paying Fournier that."
"You could make nearly 10 NBA-viable teams out of that draft. Not necessarily in complete ranking order:  1. Trae, Luka, MPJ, JJJ, Ayton  2. SGA, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, Bagley, WCJ  3. Brunson, Trent Jr, Huerter, Miles Bridges, Robinson  4. Graham, DiVincenzo, Huerter, Brown Jr, Williams  5. Nunn, Robinson, Shamet, Vanderbilt, Bamba 6. Melton, Walker, Okogie, Tate, Wagner 7. Simons, Milton, Allen, Diallo, Alize Johnson 8. Holiday, Carter, Troy Brown Jr, Svi, Eubanks 9. McLaughlin, Chiozza, Kenrich Williams, Gary Clark, Metu 10. Trier, Bates-Diop, Hutchison, Khyri Thomas, Watanabe  The last few aren't amazing, but there's some decent role-players in them, which is pretty great value considering that's 50 players listed there."
Any team with Gary trent Jr is a bad team every other night
"Man, I just looked through the draft, it's crazy deep, too.   Devonte' Graham and Gary Trent Jr were second rounders. Miles Bridges, Divincenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Robert Williams.. the list goes on. There's probably nearly 30 guys that could legitimately have 10+ year careers assuming healthy. That's pretty wild."
Nah he's locked in to end his career in Toronto.  Steph Curry and Gary Trent Jr  Dell Curry and Gary Trent Sr.  We ain't winning chips were just gonna get WEIRD
"I'll never forget watching Blazers/Mavs on Valentine's Day last year with my parents.  They LOVE women's basketball but just watch the Blazers in the NBA so they're extremely knowledgeable but not familiar with a lot of players.  I was trying to convince them that Porzingis was actually really, really good and a big deal when the Mavericks got him.  Let's just say it was a real eye-opener in terms of my thoughts about him when my parents were like  * Why doesn't he rebound * When he gets a rebound, why does he just bring it down to where everyone can steal it? * How come Gary Trent Jr. can guard him in the post? * How does your Center not come inside the 3 point line? * Why does he play like he's 6'7""? * If he can stand straight up, why does he have 5 fouls?  Each one I was just like... ok... so, you don't get it... so... and I just looked crazier and crazier trying to convince them.  Sigh."
"Sign Gary Trent Jr, try to trade KP for a secondary ball-handler."
He has...  3. Rick and Jalen Brunson.  4. Gary Payton and Gary Payton II (on roster but never logged minutes against Lebron)  5. Glenn Robinson Jr/III  6. Gary Trent Sr/Jr
"Shows how long Vince Carter been in the league, he played against Gary Trent Sr/Jr, Kenyon Martin Sr/Jr, Dell/Steph/Seth Curry, Arvydas/Domantas Sabonis and Tim Hardaway Sr/Jr."
"Depends on upbringing probably.  Probably elementary or middle school, id imagine NBA players kids get into it even younger. I know Gary Trent Jr had his dad doing drills with him at age 5"
"This. Scoring guards that can shoot all flourish under Stotts because he gives them the green light to get shots in various ways.  Shabazz Napier had a career resurgence with Portland. Allen Crabbe had success with Portland, and has struggled outside of Portland. Gary Trent Jr developed in Portland. Jake Layman, Seth Curry,   It hasn't worked out every time though with guys like Mario Hezonja and Nik Stauskas."
"Yes we have found a lot of late gems who are actually decent. Ant, Gary Trent Jr, and more I’m too stoned to name"
"I mean a team's struggles ultimately fall on all three of players, coaching, and management. It's the player's job to execute a scheme to win games, it's a coach's job to design and adjust a scheme so the players can execute, and it's management's responsibility to supply players who can execute as well as a coach who can get his players to execute.  In Stott's case - he had two clear objectives given by management: to win a playoff series and improve the defense. Management supplied the team with guys they thought Stotts needed to improve the defense, and therefore win a series, with players like Derrick Jones Jr and Robert Covington.  In Stott's case - the management did seemingly give him players that would improve the team.    Add Gary Trent Jr's comments this season about being asked to do way more within the Raptors' defense - and it's hard to say Stotts got too much blame. Maybe he wasn't actually given enough talent to work with - but management has every reason to believe he was and that he failed at his job."
"I don't think Olshey is the problem. The problem is Portland has had to build from the draft. Lillard, McCollum were both drafted by Olshey. And this is exactly why he's paying max to two score first guards. Portland has never had the luxury to construct a roster like 20+ other more attractive markets from free agency.  As a Blazer fan, he's overachieved. Olshey also drafted Gary Trent Jr. (late 2nd) and Anfernee Simons (late 1st)."
"2018 could be top 5 potentially, it's got quality and depth. Ayton, Luka, Trae all have HOF potential. MPJ, SGA, Sexton, JJR, Mitchell Robinson all have all star potential too. Then u got decent role players in both Bridges, Timelord, Divencenzo, Huerter, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr, Bruce Brown &amp; Shake Milton near the end of the draft. K Nunn and Duncan Robinson went undrafted this year too. Had so much fun with this class in 2kmygm."
"To be fair Luka has GOAT potential, which automatically puts this class up a tier from a lot of other classes. Trae probably doesn't have top 10 potential but top 30 i think is where his ceiling could be. Ayton has work to do but his upside is right around where Trae's is. MPJ is below those two but will be a very very good player if he stays health. Then you consider depth and guys like SGA, JJJ, Sexton, Mikael and Miles Bridges who could all be all stars,  excellent role players like Rob Williams,  Jalen Brunson,  Devontae Graham, Mitchel Robinson, Gary Trent Jr., Anfrenee Simons, Donte Divencenzo, Landry Shamet, Lonnie Walker,Bruce Brown, Shake Milton it just goes on and on. All of these guys are either averaging double digit scoring, playing big minutes on a contender, or both.   They definately might have a case for best all time when its all said and done tbh"
"I think the Powell acquisition was the right move as well, it was clear Gary Trent Jr. was not interested in signing long term and Powell is a better player right now, so they made the right choice to maximize their chances of succeeding this year.  As for Collins, he does provide some defense but unfortunately he cannot stop fouling and he's not particularly strong on the glass which limits his ceiling.  And offensively it's maybe harsh to call him a zero, but that's kind of what he's shown so far.  His touch around the rim is rough, he's not a skilled PnR big (he's not explosive rolling to the rim, he's not a natural passer, and his shot on a pick-n-pop is iffy), and his jumper isn't actually that reliable.  He was constantly getting wide-ass-open corner 3 looks and was inconsistent with his stroke on some of the easiest looks he'll ever get.  It sucks that he got hurt, obviously, but he hadn't shown a lot up until that point and now the Blazers need to figure out his future (he's an RFA this offseason)."
"They just need to blow the whole thing up and ship Dame out too. I don’t see any possible trades that make them a contender. What team is going to trade a superstar for CJ and some mediocre assets? They’ve got some decent young guys, it’s time to just embrace the rebuild and hope to get it over with soon. They’ve been dragging this out too long and all it’s gotten them is depleted assets, as they trades FRP’s for Cov and a really promising young guy in Gary Trent JR for a more established guy in Norman."
"2018 has just some solid ass players all around whether they in the playoffs or not right now:  Ayton, Doncic, Jackson Jr., Trae, Sexton, Mikal Bridges, SGA, Miles Bridges, MPJ, Divencenzo, Huerter, Lonnie Walker, Shamet, Gary Trent Jr., Anfernee Simons, Jalen Brunson, Grayson Allen. A lot of quality picks."
Blazers should’ve let Gary Trent Jr take over for CJ this year.
Gary Trent jr
"that draft was so deep. Robert Williams, Gary Trent Jr, Mitchell Robinson, Devonte' Graham, Jalen Brunson were all picked between 27 and 37"
They already made their big trades  Two first round picks for Covington  Gary Trent jr for Powell
"Getting rid of Gary Trent Jr and Seth Curry were pretty awful moves, both of those guys could’ve had a huge impact in this series"
"Idk Lakers cap situation but I honesty think the only guys that should remain on the roster are LeBron, AD, Caruso &amp; KCP. Really want to see LA swing at guys like Gary Trent Jr., Norman Powell &amp; Duncan Robinson.  Need a quality big to soak up minutes at the 5 to preserve AD.  Lakers should come out energized &amp; healed with a proper off season after flaming out in in the 1st round. Need Vogel to get a better assistant for offense even with Bron &amp; AD healthy this team suffered a good amount of 2,3,&amp; 4 minutes scoring droughts. Simply gotta rehab, reload &amp; refocus for next season."
Come reunite with your pal Gary Trent jr.
Trade Norm Powell to the Raptors for Gary Trent Jr and Rodney Hood
just wanna thank the blazers again for Gary Trent jr
I hated Bagley pre-draft and I'm absolutely taking him over Gary Trent Jr
They need to sign Gary Trent Jr in the offseason.
Hope we throw the bag at Gary Trent Jr.
&gt; Gary Trent Jr.  Yeah I can see him working out for yall.
"First off, fit is dumb in the presence of overwhelming talent but Mr. I need my mandatory days off on a team that absolutely hates them is just an off match.  Gary Trent Jr. should be a top tier Knicks target."
I got a Gary Trent Jr jersey now I'm about to pop a bottle on Danny Green one
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
Someone like Gary Trent Jr?
No way Raps give you Siakam. Besides they already have Gary Trent Jr now.
"Portland owns all of their draft picks (after this upcoming draft), and still have Anfernee Simons and Nassir Little on rookie contracts as asset sweeteners. Gary Trent Jr trick y'all, dudes about to be overpaid relative to the value he provides on the court after this summer. The RFA is a curse, not a blessing."
Gary Trent Jr should get a nice payday.
Idk their client list but I know Gary Trent Jr is one so I’m interested to see what he gets this summer.
The defensive oriented players in that class is pretty damn good. I think it is a fluid situation because I don't think anyone would be shocked if a player on the lower end has a better defensive season than player ranked above. Just get rid of Gary Trent Jr from this list
Gary Trent Jr.
"Carmelo Anthony, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal, Trae Young, Gary Trent Jr., Ja Morant, Collin Sexton, Doug McDermott, Lou Williams, CJ McCollum, Tim Hardaway Jr."
Better than Gary trent jr
It’s too late to trade CJ. The time to make that move was last season when they could’ve plugged a bigger Gary Trent Jr into CJ’s spot.  Instead they traded GTJ to get out of Rodney Hood deal.   Now they are basically locked into being a 1st/2nd round exit.
"Ya but for some reason every time either player plays the lakers (rubio's been doing it since his first stint in minny), they go crazy.   Other notable players to explode against us: DJ Augustin, Vucevic, Any Raptors player, gary trent jr"
"he went to Toronto with Gary Trent JR for Norman Powell, but didn't log many minutes with them"
"It's going to be really interesting to see how much Tim Hardaway Jr., Norm Powell and Gary Trent Jr. all get this offseason.  Similar sizes &amp; player profiles between all of them, Trent is younger than Norm/THJ but has the least off-the-bounce juice of the trio (plus he's an RFA).  I think all 3 could be getting Jerami Grant $$$ when it comes down to it.  Makes someone like Terrence Ross look like a bargain (he's not as good as any of these 3 but will be making ""only"" $12.5M next year and $11.5M in 22-23)"
Y’all who is better to have: Tim Hardaway or Gary Trent Jr? Both are free agents
Norman Powell is a big upgrade over Gary Trent Jr but we don’t give him enough touches imo.    If we let him be more of a secondary ball handler like he could be then I think we would be seeing his name more in this thread
"Here’s my logic for the raptors:   * Siakam is 27, which isn’t too old to be a part of a rebuild, but younger players would be ideal.  * The raptors are not in a great situation cap wise. Siakam is making the max, OG and vanvleet are both making 20 mill a year, and gary trent jr is about to be paid. Not a horrible situation, but surprisingly inflexible considering how far they are from contending. This trade doesn’t instantly fix the situation, but they’ll at least have cap space in 2 years when wiggins contract ends.  * Trading siakam lets them tank for a year or two, so they can get more shots at some young talent. If they’re a playoff team next year, there’s a real risk of getting stuck on the treadmill of mediocrity, with no clear path towards contention."
"I’m not basing it off a regular season success. I just told you that comparing the blazers team of last year to this suns team is asinine.   Again, I’m not basing it off the fact that the blazers were worse than the suns record wise, I’m judging it off the fact that Phoenix have bodies to put against Lebron, not a 6’5 Gary Trent Jr and a 6’6 center in PJ tucker. Foolish comparison."
Two years of a roster spot for Smailagic  Taking Jacob Evans over Gary Trent Jr  A couple different choices at the bottom of the roster and we are in a totally different position even with Klays injuries.

"It’s such a deep class too. You got Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, Shake Milton, De’Anthony Melton, Alize Johnson all carving out solid careers or showing flashes as second-round picks. 2018 might just turn out to be one of the best classes ever tbh."
Gary Trent Jr - Future All Star Potential
Dillon Brooks has that same dawg energy Gary Trent Jr. has and I can't help but want to see him go off
Gary Trent jr too
I would love to see Gary Trent Jr. and Dillon Brooks on the same team. Unlimited hype generation.
"&gt; The 2018 draft just keeps on looking better and better. It was STACKED! Ayton, trae, luka, SGA, mikal and miles bridges, MPJ, JJJ, Sexton, jalen Brunson, Robert Williams, Gary Trent jr, even donte divencenzo and **Grayson Allen**."

"He'll be an UFA so if they had no intention to re-sign him, might as well get something in return. Same thing for Matt Thomas.  They have FVV and Gary Trent Jr as their guards of the future and two promising rookies in Malachi Flynn and Jalen Harris, two players who will be cheaper. They also have Paul Watson.   Overall the Raptors made 3 good trades at the deadline. We'll see what the Kings do with Davis, but if they end up re-signing him without overpaying him it'll be a good trade for them too.   My nomination for the worst trade of recent years is the Lakers trading Zubac for Muscala. Just, why?"
I’d protect:  1) Siakam 2) OG Anunoby  3) Fred VanVleet 4) Chris Boucher  5) Gary Trent Jr.
"Same with Kobe, klay, Cole Anthony, bol bol, jalen Brunson, nic claxton,Jae crowder, Ed Davis, garland, jeremi grant, Tim Hardaway Jr, al horford, Luke kornet, Wes Mathews, jabari Parker, Kenyon Martin jr, Austen rivers, Sabonis, Gary Trent jr, Wiggins, Winslow etc etc etc etc etc etc etc   LOTS of guys have nba dads, not many are this good. Damn so hateful"

"Fair enough. I’d take a supporting cast of Whiteside (Melo played 60 games), Melo, and McCollum over Wiggins, Dray, and nobody any day. Even had legitimate role players like Gary Trent Jr. Like I said, I think worse is a given and much worse is arguable. I think if Melo, McCollum, and Whiteside (if you still had him) were traded for Dray and Wiggins you’d be like wtf just happened."
Some dude got all salty here with me when I said GTJ/Gary Trent Jr isn’t well known enough to get abbreviated lmao. This was before he got traded and he was still with the blazers.
"Trade Bledsoe or relegate him to playing off the bench.   Sign one of Duncan Robinson, Furkan Korkmaz.   S&amp;T Zo to Toronto for Gary Trent Jr or to Portland for Norman Powell.   Or re-sign Zo for no more than $15mil/year.   Re-sign Hart, Uncle JJ and guarantee Wenyen Gabriel’s contract for next year.   Cap space is a conspiracy theory.   Lock Zion and BI in a gym with Kevin Garnett and Gary Payton."
1. Gary   2. Trent  3. Jr  4. Gary Trent Jr  5. GTJ
Nice to have a non-exciting win for once. Also GARY FUCKING TRENT JR
Gary Trent Jr.!!!
Lmao. The disrespect to Gary Trent Jr.
"Agreed. You don't let talent like Gary Trent Jr walk. Let some teams set his market value and deal with it. Portland is in win-now mode anyways, they're not pinching pennies. They managed to dodge to lux tax this year by a few thousand so now it's time to start the repeater clock."
"Honestly, I like CJ McCollum and want to keep him here. There's no guarantee that we'll be able to keep Gary Trent Jr. in the offseason, he'll be getting a great contract."
"pre-injury Nurk was much better, even so his touch was always kinda iffy and he's always been pretty methodical with everything he does.  I think the RoCo trade was decent process when they made the move, unfortunately it hasn't panned out well.  My biggest criticism of it was that it was probably 2 years too late to get him (I thought the same thing when they finally traded for Ariza last year, he'd have been the ideal fit next to Dame &amp; CJ like 4 years ago but instead the Blazers had ET &amp; Harkless).   Trust me, I am driving the ""Neil Olshey is culpable"" bandwagon.  He's extremely high variance and I don't trust his process/strategy much at all.  Drafting Dame &amp; CJ=excellent.  Deciding that the seemingly frisky playoff team was worth paying &amp; they were one ET away from truly contending=cripplingly bad.  Nurkic trade=home run.  Drafting Zach Collins &amp; Anfernee Simons=kinda bad.  Drafting Gary Trent Jr.=good.  Dude is all over the map which is equivalent to shitting the bed in a small market."
"God I'm tired of hearing this.  19 out of 20 ESPN analysts picked us to lose in 5 games or less.  We played the Lakers after playing balls to the wall for 8 do or die games while missing our starting PF, starting SF, and our backup SF.  We started an undrafted rookie against Anthony Davis and Gary Trent Jr, a 2nd year 2nd rounder that's 6'5, against Lebron.  Oh and CJ had a broken back and Dame went down with a knee injury.    People were just looking for a story and we were the victims of it."
"Man this is how I feel about the Blazers. Second favorite team for me. You got another godly point gaurd in Dame, it feels like Gary Trent Jr never misses, and Melo is Melo   Anfernee a ton of youthful fun too   Come back CJ 😥"
I mean we beat the Lakers on a last second play after a timeout. Just couldn't get the ball inbounded here. Tough way to end the game on that foul but Cov made a great play. Nothing we can really do when they're making contested threes all game. Just gotta hope Melo and Gary Trent Jr. aren't on the schedule again.
I thought we played the best defense the current rules allow. Nothing we can do if Gary Trent Jr. is making threes over tough coverage from great defenders. Also not a banner game from Harris.
I never want to see Gary Trent Jr again
"Damian ""Gary Trent Jr"" Lillard"
Gary Trent Jr might start on a lot of teams
Gary Trent Jr is what everyone keeps paying Danny Green to be
Lmao it's actually hilarious to mention Ben after getting blown out by Melo and Gary Trent Jr  Denver is the only one where it's a legitimate reason
"depends on the team. the nets might say lu dort, and the Pelicans might say Gary Trent Jr."
CJ and Nurk are both out on injuries that will take a month or two.  Covington and DJJ also missed several games with injuries.  Collins with yet another major injury.  There have been games where Lillard was the only normal starter and his best supporting players were Melo and Gary Trent Jr.
"So at worst they've been dealing with similar missed time problems, but one guy is 13-10 and one guy is 11-14.    &gt; CJ and Nurkic each played 13 games so there isn't much difference in time missed.  Nurkic played 12, and Zach Collins literally hasn't played and plays the same spot.  So our center rotation is Enes Kanter and Harry Giles.    &gt; on-off numbers don't tell you much, because you don't know who else is sitting in that time, if they are playing their entire bench line-up or like to stagger. If their bench unit is better than the opposing bench unit etc.  They tell you a lot.  Our 2nd best player has been either Enes Kanter or Gary Trent Jr for the majority of the season.  We have to play carmelo anthony next to Enes Kanter for significant portions of every game."

I like your gary trent jr.
Ours for the last 10 games of the season has been EASILY bigger. Our second best player is either enes Kanter or Gary Trent jr. But we also had CJ 12 games
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr.
"Okay, what's Joel's excuse for losing to the Blazers last year when Dame, CJ, DJJ, Nurkic, (and Collins if you wanna count him) were all out with injury?  Our starting lineup was Gary Trent Jr., Rodney Hood, Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony, and Enes Kanter.  Our bench was Simons, CJ Elleby, and Harry Giles.  And Joel Embiid lost.  Can you just accept that single game results are just that, single games?  Nearly anything can happen on a daily basis, and you should not come in here and belittle or gatekeep it."
"Teams I got: Bucks, Lakers, Pacers, Heat, Thunder, Nuggets, Raptors.

Not really..raps gave 18M/yr to Gary Trent jr
I don’t see Gary Trent Jr
"You mean in the last reply, after you started getting really condescending and “ok lol’ing” at me? Yeah I’m gonna be snarky back.  Like if you’re going to talk shit about “poor planning to let a dude walk” when we absolutely did not “let” him walk, then yeah. I really hate when people are both condescending and wrong, so you’re gonna hear it from me when you do that.  Not to mention you kind of…interjected yourself and your team into this conversation about AG and the nuggets twice. Not everything is about you. Or Evan turner. Or Gary Trent jr. but you wanted to make it about those things, despite the fact that they are tangentially related at best.  I get that you’re a blazers fan and all, but not everything has to be about them. Other news for other teams doesn’t have to boil down to “how can I relate this to the blazers, the only team I watch and know anything about? I wonder perhaps is there some condescendingly wrong comment I can make about the team/player who this thread is about because I don’t follow them and only follow the blazers?”  Have a good one."
"The blazers used the same logic when we signed Evan Turner to his huge contract. Now, AG is a much better player than ET ever was, so its unlikely that it turns out as badly, but it still has the potential to burn you down the road like the ET contract did for us. It might not matter in the next two years, but what about 3-4 years from now? Your roster might look entirely different, what if you could trade  for a superstar but it necessitates you taking on a couple million in salary. Suddenly the AG extension is the roadblock between the nuggets taking the step to contender. Also, the repeater tax is a thing. No team in the league can afford to just sit in the tax year after year, you might have to give up assets just to cut salary in a few years as a direct result of this deal.  It also begs the question of why give up assets for a guy whos going to get overpaid in a few months, and could you have gotten someone better or cheaper instead. As a blazers fan I am pretty happy we flipped Gary Trent Jr. for Norman Powell at 17mil per year, rather than trading GTJ plus picks for AG at nearly 24 million per year, as was rumored to be a potential deal we turned down."
"As much as I want to throw up in my mouth for even suggesting it...   How about something structured around Fred VanVleet + Goron Dragic for Simmons? That's tons of savvy guard scoring and leadership for Philly and the Raptors can fully embrace their goal of gigantic, defensive focused, basketball. I love Fred as much as the next guy but I am just so damn intrigued at the idea of playing Simmons, Gary Trent Jr, Scottie Barnes, OG, and Siakam. That would be revolutionarily gross basketball and I'm all for it."
That Gary Trent jr game is insane
"That's not the issue with switching situations, trying to compare them makes no sense because they play very different roles in different positions. Paul George has recently had a strong number 1 player on his team first with Westbrook now with Kawhi. Paul fits perfectly as a number two scoring option that can potentially carry as a leading scorer but has a couple of bad years in the playoffs that have unfairly offset his clutch years as a Pacer.  Dame is the first option on a very efficient pick and roll offense that has had issues of extremely terrible defenses over the years. McCollum has grown as a scorer but the lack of defensive abilities in their position as well as a lack of available defensive big men highlights their weaknesses. The Blazers have also dealt with a ton of injures in the past few years and despite they have always over performed in the regular season because of Dame's ability to run the offense. As a Blazer fan Dame has tremendously improved his ability as an offensive player over the years and nothing showed that more than Game 5 vs the Nuggets. The problem is Dame is a terrible defender and because of his offensive load he can be lazy, the Blazers have no guards that can be called defensively good and have never had good wing players. Aminu was never a good shooter and Gary Trent Jr. and Norman Powell are too small to guard played like Lebron and Michael Porter Jr. Our only defensive minded big man have been Covington and Nurkic. That is a ticking time bomb in the playoffs and that lack of defensive gets abused in the playoffs. Dame has gotten better at getting out of double teams but he still can't find teammates that can create plays with other players. He is not a good off-ball player so his role is diluted and his defense is magnified with McCollum."
"I dont think they are in purgatory but their timeline is kind of weird. The young players they have that are 24 years old or younger are OG Anunoby,Gary Trent Jr,Scottie Barnes,Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn, OG and Gary are already starting level players,Scottie is a project who has star potential and both Flynn and Precious looked good in summer league and could develop well. Imo thats a fringe top 10 young core  Its just that on top of those guys they also have a bunch of win now players who dont really have time to develop like Siakam,Fred,Boucher,Dragic and Birch who would rather win now"
Do you have any idea how easy it is to match 19.4 million.  Gary Trent Jr makes 18
Raptors aren't in no mans land right now. We have a core of young talented players led by two 27 year olds (which is still young) with championship experience. The teams is close to rebuilt.   If OG and Gary Trent Jr develop a little bit more and we get a proper starting centre then we're a top 4-6 team in the east. If Siakam regains his confidence and or Scottie turns out to be a solid pick then we're giving any team a run for their money.
Gary Trent Jr continuing that legacy lol
I’d imagine FVV + either Gary Trent Jr or OG just for salary purposes. Maybe 2-3 firsts and a couple seconds
PG: FVV  SG: Gary Trent Jr.   SF: OG Anunoby   PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Khem Birch  Bench:  Goran Dragic  Malachi Flynn  Scottie Barnes  Chris Boucher  Precious Achiuwa
"He’s also never made any bad moves except the reach on Bruno and signing Demarre Carol, who he had to use a first to dump.   -	Traded Grevis Vazquez who was out of the league two years later for picks that became OG (guy is seen as potential all-star) and Norm, who later became Gary Trent Jr.  -	Signed Kyle and Demar to contracts when at the time no one wanted to re-sign with Toronto. -	Traded for Gasol who was super important in the championship. -	People forget, but got Danny Green basically for free in the Demar trade, who was our starting two. -	Got FVV who went undrafted, and is now one of the better guards in the league. -	Didn’t budge with OKC on the Serge trade that was originally reported to be JV + Ross + 2 firsts, got him a year later for just Ross + bad first.  I could go on but it’s not like he just traded for Kawhi and the rest of career on Toronto sucked."
Gary Trent Jr.  44 pts on 17/19 fgs only missed 2 shots
Gary Trent Jr
"Damn you managed to list ZERO people that were used to acquire Lebron, good work!   Not to mention shockingly you managed to ignore Gary Trent Jr, who is arguably the best prospect of all of those players and was drafted in the second round.  And lastly, if you think Nassir Little or Anfernee Simons suck and or busts, it just goes to demonstrate your ignorance even further."
I think I’ve found it. Gary Trent Jr?
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
Gary Trent jr
Gary Trent Jr--Apple Valley MN
The Blazers acquired Gary Trent Sr. in the 1995 draft and drafted Gary Trent Jr. 2018. The Blazers drafted Sr. to the Raptors in 1998 and Jr. to the Raptors in 2021.  Just one of my favorite father/son alignment stories in the NBA.
"1. Gary Trent Jr will be an allstar by 2024  2. This wouldn't be bold coming from a non-Blazers fan, but as a Blazers fan, I think it's pretty bold, but I don't think Dame will be a Blazer next season. I think he'll finish out the season and even if we make the second round or WCF, he'll ask out. We need to go to the Finals to keep him"
"&gt; the day Klutch Sports dies will be a great day for the NBA  That seems very dramatic.   &gt;how most if not all of his moves as an agent can be traced back to benefitting LeBron or LeBron's team,  Because Draymond, Gary Trent Jr, John Wall or hell even Nerlens Noel have benefited Lebron so much.   I'm not trying to defend Rich Paul here, but you're being very dramatic."
"The Weeknd, Gary Trent Jr, Patty Mills"
Gary Trent Jr  Khris Middleton  Klay Thompson
"????   AD, Trae Young, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Jordan Clarkson, Draymond Green, THT, KCP, Gary Trent Jr, Tyrese Maxes, Darius Garland, and many more  They have other clients and most have been paid."
"KCP got paid every year though.   Jordan Clarkson got paid.   Tristan got Paid. Gary Trent JR..Paid.  Terrence Ross, Dejounte Murray.  Marcus Morris had a great deal from the Spurs but Marcus turned it down.   Mikes Bridges, Darius Garland…all got paid well.    So where is this narrative that if you’re not a star e doesn’t get you paid?"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
starters at best/non stars under klutch:  - kcp - bledsoe - Clarkson - THT - Nurkic - T Ross  - Gary Trent Jr. - Tristan Kardashian  - CoJo  Didn't include guys on rookie deals.
"Eric Bledsoe a role player makes 18 million dollars a year, Gary Trent jr just got paid as well l. I can make a list of role players by Klutch that got paid ad well. Lonzo a role player is also making 20m a year now lol"
"Did You Know: Gary Trent Jr  Did I do it right?  I fucked it up, didn't I?"
"If history has taught us anything, she's gonna get with a slightly above average current NBA player that hovers around 18ppg on 45% FG. Somewhat of a chucker.   Gary Trent Jr is my guess. The pick is in."
Hmm I remember that one Gary Trent Jr but I felt like all the other times he was just yelling after an and 1 like most players didn’t really see him jawing at Dame. Dame was pretty off in the first half so maybe Russ said something to him later on in the game idk
"He was chirping a bit, may have been directed at Gary Trent Jr at first though...right after he posted him up and had that spin move.  Think he had some more chirping just kind of directed at no one in particular, but they showed it on the Blazers broadcast.  It's a known thing when Dame and Russ play each other though."
"He played with Steph Curry and his dad, and Gary Trent JR and Sr."
"&gt; NBA, MPJ, FVV, KD, THT, AD, AC, CP what's up with this?  Idk about you but those all instantly recognizable for me.  And typing out Derrick Jones Jr or Gary Trent jr takes forever"
Kanter has definitely been our second best since we lost everyone..  Gary Trent Jr is the only one that really has an argument otherwise
"Then you should watch the Blazers, because Curry has a better team around him than Dame does right now.  We've been down 3-4 starters for the last 2 weeks  Our 2nd and 3rd best players right now are Enes Kanter and Gary Trent Jr, a guy no one had even heard of  till the bubble"
They both are playing with injured teams and both carrying their teams to similar records. You think that when our second best player on the floor is Gary Trent Jr. that Dame isn't seeing triple teams? Stop sleeping on Dame.
"This is Lavine's fault,  First he doesn't pass the ball, resulting in a jump ball (doesn't even try to dribble), then he is out jumped by Gary Trent jr.  Lavine is, at most, a 3rd option on a championship team.  No more."
Yea their intent clearly was to foul. Maybe the refs just thought Gary Trent Jr. was giving Lavine a congratulatory bear hug on their hard fought game?
"How does Zach LaVine lose a jump ball to Gary Trent, Jr.?!?"
And Gary Trent Jr
I feel like Gary Trent Jr and solid starter on a bad-medicore team is the same thing
"If you asked me last year, he could be an extremely solid starter on any bad-mediocre team. Now, he’s like Gary Trent jr in terms of value"
Gary Trent Jr. Is one of those guys you hate until he's on your team. He has this assholish look every time he makes a bucket like he's the best player on the court.
I saw this. I also saw simons commit two turnovers in a row right after Gary Trent Jr. hit 2 straight threes. rookie mistake not finding the hot hand but also the teams mistake because I didn't see another 3 after that
"""He's dong his Gary Trent Jr.""  EJ just slid that in and caught a body"
Underdog vs Gary Trent Jr: Who did it better?
"If Gary Trent Jr didn't miss the the open layup on the previous possession, Blazers would be ahead right now."
"Gary Trent is like Tim Hardaway Jr, they both become Steph Curry clones against us. Nothing new"
"&gt; Devonte Graham, Michell Robinson, Shake Milton, Gary Trent Jr.  Who are those? Do you mean DG, MR, SM and GTJ?"
Murray versus Suns and Gary Trent Jr versus Lakers. Name a better duo.
Fucking Gary Trent Jr! Dude was almost out of the rotation the game before dropping 28 on us.
Gary Trent Jr
Dort  Gary Trent Jr   Jrue Holiday.   All in the convo too
"Didn't realize he was only 22 / year 3. Looking down the list into the late 2nd round, this was a damn good draft. Shake Milton, Devonte Graham, Gary Trent Jr."
"is 2017 really deeper?   2018 is luka trae ofc but there's also JJJ, SGA, Sexton, Ayton if you go in lower tier player but still very good you get Shamet, Mikal Bridges  even the second round is  stacked w/ Brunson, Mitchell Robinson, De'vonte Graham Shake Milton or Gary Trent Jr  there's lot of work to be done but imo 2018 will be an all time great draft"
I’d argue Gary Trent Jr. is the best currently from Minnesota
"I didn't realize Phil Jackson was born in Montana, I thought he was a North Dakotan born and raised so I was going to argue him for all time in North Dakota but he should def be all time for Montana then since the other guy only played in the ABA.  Double Damn, i thought for sure Gary Trent Jr was born in Minnesota but nope it was Columbus."
"it's really tough, you just have to hope the Blazers can hang tough while CJ &amp; Nurk are out.  It's a great opportunity for Gary Trent Jr. to step up, and I like his pairing with Dame in the starting line-up.  Hopefully Rodney Hood can keep his comeback going too and take on a larger role to chip in.     My thinking is that more than changing the coach after the year, the organization needs to take a really long look at Neil Olshey.  He's been pretty high variance and unfortunately it's been more down than up lately.  The Simons &amp; Collins picks in particular are looking really poor right now, Simons just flat out isn't very good and Collins has had problems staying on the floor and got taken over some really, really good NBA players that year (Mitchell, Bam, John Collins, OG).  In both cases the Blazers went for project/upside prospects when they already had a franchise superstar and a couple star players in CJ &amp; Nurk, perhaps going for more ""sure thing"" players or making different moves at the time to maximize the core they had would've been better.  Hindsight is 20/20 of course, but there were signs in the moment that the process was questionable (Simons in particular was a strange, strange pick).   I actually like Stotts and I think he's done pretty well with the roster he has.  Are there better NBA coaches? Sure, but the players still play hard for him and he's not doing things that are tanking the on-court results.  It's hard to coach competent defense with a rotation that includes Melo, Kanter, Dame &amp; CJ (both of them try on defense but size limits their impact).  Even the players the Blazers have that are ""good"" defenders have limitations and/or aren't elite performers.  DJJ is active on defense but still pretty untested.  RoCo is solid but not an All-NBA level stopper.  Gary Trent Jr. tries hard but is small.  Nurk is great on the glass &amp; takes up space near the rim but he's not the kind of big that switches onto the perimeter &amp; is match-up dependent.   Creating a contender in a small market is incredibly tough, even when you strike oil on a franchise player that wants to be there you have to nail every single peripheral move to get over the top.  At least Dame plays in a city that loves &amp; respects him and turns out for him every night, he certainly shows up for us and it's pretty awesome to watch."
"A lot of people might be surprised that Minnesota (the twin cities specifically) has a pretty healthy basketball scene.  Just that those people are fans of other teams, or just the nba in general , rather than following the wolves.  Can't blame em , we suck, but theyd hop on board if we ever get good  Recently have some nba talent come out of the state.  Tyus Jones, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Suggs (will be a top 3 pick in the 2021 draft) and Chet Holmgren (projected top pick in the 2022 draft)"
Brogdon can play the 2!  PG: Dame / Aaron Holiday / TJ McConnell  SG: Malcolm Brogdon / Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Justin Holiday / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Doug McDermott / Melo  C: Sabonis / Kanter / Giles   We couldn't anchor the paint to save our lives but hey we can surround Sabonis with shooters.
Shitposting aside I still think they have enough depth to survive for the time being.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons   SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little  SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm kind of high on the bench but that's still a serviceable 10-man rotation. The idea of Kanter holding down the defense is frightening but he did it during the playoffs when Portland made the WCF a few years ago.  I'm excited for Giles to get some consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest link in the rotation but hopefully he can step up with some consistent minutes. Gary Trent Jr. is ready to take the leap imo.
"The Blazers got murdered by injuries this year and its happening again this year. But honestly, I still think they have the depth to go further than they did last season.  PG: Dame / Anfernee Simons  SG: Gary Trent Jr. / Nassir Little   SF: DJJ / Rodney Hood  PF: RoCo / Melo  C: Kanter / Giles  I'm admittedly higher on the bench than a lot of people but I think there's decent depth through the roster and that's even with CJ, Nurk and Collins out. I'm happy to see Giles getting consistent minutes. Nassir Little is the weakest guy in the rotation but maybe he just needs the opportunity to step up."
Whoops yeah I’d forgotten about that blazers game. Goddamn Gary Trent Jr
Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr look like they could be brothers
"Happy Birthday, Gary Trent Jr!!!"
Gary Trent Jr.
"As of this year, Gary Trent Jr and DJJ but I haven't watched every game but they've impressed me this far."
"Any role player has a huge night against the Lakers. Take your pick, Gary Trent Jr just looked like Klay Thompson against us a few weeks ago"
Boucher was fouled by Gary Trent Jr on his 3 pointer towards the end of the game against Portland this year
Gary Trent Jr. But Blazers rather keep him
Gary Trent Jr about to secure the bag
If THT is getting maxes i don't know whats next for Gary Trent Jr. - straight to highest paid player ever?
"Yeah but we also went to the WCF finals with no Nurk though and most people would consider Robert Covington and Derick Jones Jr. better players than Al-Farouq Aminu and Mo Harkless (ask Heat fants) who they are replacing the roles of from that team, Gary Trent has also made a big jump this year, Melo is shooting 40% plus from 3, Rodney Hood is still working his way back into form but will be there by the postseason, CJ is playing the best basketball of his career (and its mostly by adding 5 or so 3 point attempts a game so its sustainable).  Last year Nurk was out until the bubble and then still with barely any conditioning coming back and the team had no Kanter or Hood or Covington or DJJ and it was pretty much Melo or Mario Herzonja on the wing.   There is a reason people view them as a bigger threat this year. Upgrading your best players from 4-8 and getting your 3rd best player back (eventually with Nurk, he's also not in his normal game shape yet)  Right now the team is still waiting on Nurk to get back to his usual self and still winning at a decent clip which will only keep going up as they play together more and as Hood gets back into form"
Gary Trent Jr is a sniper
Not really directly answering the question but Gary Trent Jr. needs more shots than he’s getting.
"Gary Trent Jr has maintained his shooting percentages, but his usage has gone way down because guys like Melo don’t give him the ball"
BAH GAWD it's the Blazers...with McCollum+Gary Trent Jr+2 FRPs from the top ropes!
"And remember when people said that the Blazers weren't a playoff team last season? Oh, they are the 8th seed, and shit like that. I still remember those comments lol, and they just got BETTER this year, still, I am waiting for Gary Trent JR to score more than 15 points."
"I think for players like Gary Trent Jr, Derick Jones Jr, or Timothe Luwawu-Cabarot (sp?), the 3 letter abbreviation helps. Well, maybe Trent Jr is enough or just Gary Trent cuz no one's gonna think his father is still playing in the league, and I don't know of another Trent in the NBA. Actually Jones Jr should work too... he's the only Jones Jr in the league, but there are 6 other active players with the last name Jones. So it could get confusing."
Australian Gary Trent Jr. needs to come to the Lakers
Gary Trent Jr
"Maybe I'm racist, but Patty Mills and Gary Trent jr look a lot alike."
Derrick Jones Junior has played great defense as well as Gary Trent Jr and ...well that’s about it but RoCo and Nurk should be better by February is my guess
"Never happening but the salaries necessary to match would probably be Derrick Jones Jr. and Collins. I don't think that's valuable enough for the Warriors so they'd have to include some combo of picks, Anfernee, and/or Gary Trent Jr. So yeah, they'd give up depth but they'd still have a solid top 8 in their rotation.   Regardless, this is never happening."
"Dray + Nurk is a great defensive front court (Nurk can handle bigger centers, Dray provides help defense).  Dray, Covington, DJJ are great perimeter defenders.  Blazers suffer from a stagnant half court offense at times. This would surround Dray with shooters (a proven strategy). Dame + CJ/Gary Trent Jr + Cov/Melo (who has been pretty good spotting up) with Nurkic/DJJ in the dunkers spot would be nasty"
"The fact that you've watched this team the last few years doesn't matter. They literally picked up 2 defensive beasts in Covington and Jones Jr. Dame and CJ are bad but not awful defensively. Nurkic is supposed to be a positive defender and Rodney hood, Gary Trent jr and Harry Giles are all good defenders too.  Melo, dame, kanter and CJ are defensive liabilities but their other rotational players are good enough to make this an average or slightly below average defensive team. There's literally no excuse for them to be 29th in the league on defense."
Why is Melo playing more minutes than Gary Trent Jr?
Wished melo played the game yall cooked us lol. Less minutes for Gary Trent Jr is a blessing for the opposing team lol
Dillion brooks is my least favorite player in the league. He plays like if like Gary trent jr. Thought he was kobe for literally no reason at all.
In what fucking world does 36 year old Carmelo Anthony play 28 minutes and Gary Trent Jr plays 18.  What the fuck.
I have to admit it was fun watching Gary Trent Jr drilling those 3s. This kid gonna go mills and have a bright career.
That's Australian Gary Trent Jr
"Dame, cj mccollum, nurk, Gary Trent jr, DJJ, roco.  Toss up between Collins, hood and ant.  Can make a case for choosing Collins for the size depth. Choosing Ant for G back role Choosing Hood for his overall ability, but we would have a jam in 2-3."
Gary Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr fouled him on that last one too haha
Gary Trent Jr. is legit.
Im pretty afraid of Gary trent Jr
"If this motion passes, we progress to Gary Trent Jr. is better than Siakam."
Gary Trent Jr please
Shout outs to the dumb bitch who called Gary Trent Jr GTJ earlier today
I just had this experience today with someone on this subreddit referring to Gary Trent Jr. as GTJ
You say that like Gary Trent Jr. isn't a career 8 PPG player.
"Depending on what Gary Trent Jr does regarding his extension in summer (I think), we may see a more aggressive Blazers FO."
I wanted to see Gary Trent Jr play this game man
LMA (depending on who you ask)  Gary (daddy) Trent Jr  Melo  Not Meyers Leonard
None probably. Will be Pascal OG and Scottie with Fred and one of Precious or Gary Trent jr to start games.
"&gt; Also FVV, OG, and GTJ  ???  Gary Trent Jr was fucking horrid today on offense, only reason we weren't up by like 25"
"How do y'all feel about Gary Trent Jr.? I'm waffling on him, he's got offensive talent but I'm not crazy about his decision making"
"Gary Trent Jr looks AWFUL, Siakam isn't magically walking through that door tomorrow if Barnes is traded (his return is still a month away at least), and while I'm very surprised with what Precious has shown, he's not starter material onna good team this season."
I think this is it. Tbh it's hard to judge a very young team with moderate talent when they are missing their best player. I suspect Masai doesn't mind if Pascal and Fred are in their 30s when we become competitive so he's not dying to flip them for youth/pics. But I figure if he doesn't find a road map to being competitive with the current core of Pascal Fred Scottie and og he will flip both of them. For example Scottie seems way ahead if most people's schedule for him. If Gary Trent jr took a leap and became a 20ppg guy and Scottie develops fast they could make playoff noise while Fred and Pascal still have good years left in them. Doesn't hurt to evaluate a bit.  Masai is both patient and aggressive and he's damn good at his job.
"Gary Trent JR looks like Patty Mills, no?"
"Entertaining game. Great late fake comeback lol. Had way too many turnovers, but the Raps stuck in there and had a chance to get it to OT. Demar was clutch down the stretch for the Bulls and I like what I saw from FVV, OG and Gary Trent Jr."
"Are you asking what could be traded for a first round pick? Move up in a different draft, get a guy like TJ Warren or Gary Trent Jr, or package it with other picks and players to get a guy like Lowry or Hield"
"Nurse had a different starting lineup. FVV and Dragic in the back court. 2 short guys in the back don't work against Wizards' backcourt, especially when one of them is old and a defensive liability. Nurse limited Dragic's minutes, and inserted GTJ into starting lineup. Made a huge difference. Our shooters just couldn't shoot - FVV, Gary Trent Jr, and OG."
Don't forget Gary Trent Jr he had 4 steals!
"To this day, nobody has seen Patty Mills and Gary Trent Jr in the same room together..."
"I have lasting images of Scottie Barnes, Chris Boucher, &amp; Khem Birch/Precious Achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass  As well as Gary Trent Jr. getting to the rim at will on us"
and Gary Trent Jr is basically Norman Powell but younger and a higher ceiling we have so many pieces to develop
GARY TRENT JR
"Dragic isn't under contract for next season, so he's already not being included in that group. Same for Boucher. You need to look at the salaries for 2022-23, that's what would count for trying to open up a max slot for Ayton.   Siakam, FVV, OG, Barnes and Precious is $84 million if the Raptors get rid of literally everyone else in salary dumps or just waiving them (which would include Gary Trent Jr., Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Malachi Flynn, Yuta Watanabe, etc). That $84 million leaves $35 million under a $119 million cap, but then you have to include about $7 million for cap holds for empty roster spots, which brings that down to $28 million. Ayton's max would start at $30 million, as it would be 25% of the $119 million cap."
Gary Trent Jr against the lakers
The present day Lakers killer is Gary Trent Jr.
"Turns out Vlade Divac was not a very good GM and hiring someone competent brought reasonable (expected) improvement. Hopefully, no more striking out on limited, raw, paint-anchored bigs from here on out!  2015: Picked Willie Cauley-Stein (Round 1: Pick 6) [yikes though this draft was a minefield at this point]  2016: Shipped the 8th pick (Marquese Chriss) PHX for the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic (good move) and the 13th (Georgios Papagiannis) and 28th (Skal Labissiere) picks [good move, though lots of bleh in this trade]  2017: Picked Fox (great) but also picked Zach Collins for the Trail Blazers and shipped him to Portland for Justin Jackson (15th) and Harry Giles (20th) [debatable, lots of players that never fully panned out]  2018: Picked Bagley (2nd) ahead of Luka/JJJ/Trae and shipped out Gary Trent Jr. on draft day for future picks [biggest mistake by far]  2019: No 1st round pick because of the infamous Stauskas salary dump in 2015, almost certainly engineered by Divac. Pick was the 14th and used to pick Romeo Langford.  Divac steps down, new GM Monte McNair picks Tyrese Haliburton and Davion Mitchell in 2020 and 2021, respectively."
Rick and Brent Barry would qualify; so would Arvydas and Domantas Sabonis. They’re probably the best father son duo actually.  Jimmy Walker and Jalen rose are another but they didn’t have a relationship   Dell Curry was a good player and obviously steph is steph  Larry nance Jr is HOF caliber and Larry Nance Jr is a damn good player  Mychal Thompson was the first overall pick and had a good career and Klay is Klay.    Gary Trent and Gary Trent Jr were/are both good players
Toronto will blame one of two people depending on how their seasons go: 1) Pascal Siakam: is there friction with Coach Nurse? Is he becoming a diva? Can he stay healthy to earn his contract? or 2) Gary Trent Jr.: we are paying him to be a star and he's just not showing it.

"Gary, The Weekend, Trent Jr."
I will subscribe to Gary Trent Jr. for as long as he doesn’t play on the Lakers
"I’m pretty indifferent to whether Toronto makes the playoffs this year or not - I don’t want to watch a tanking team but we’re delusional if we expect more than a first round exit.  At this point the vision should be hoping a couple of the young guys make the leap to solid starters, maybe we hit the lotto and OG/Gary Trent Jr take steps towards the all-star game, but mostly we want this stash of versatile 2-way youngsters to develop into elite trade capital in the next couple of years for someone we can actually compete with.  You’re absolutely right we don’t contend when Fred is any higher than option #4, hopefully he’s young enough to get another ring with us in his ideal role as 6th man after this rebuild though, we definitely love that guy"
gary trent jr
I couldn't even recognize gary trent jr damn lol  definitely had a major glow up
Pretty wild how big of a misstep the team took with that draft pick. I was mad about taking Jacob Evans over Gary Trent Jr. This is 100000 times worse for our title hopes.
"&gt; Jarred Vanderbilt  oh shit that's my guy 🙈  but yeah, I can see Giles, Vando, WCJ in the pic and if I squint I guess that's Miles. Gary Trent Jr and Monk both had glow ups I guess"
"Harry Giles, Jarred Vanderbilt, Miles Bridges, Wendell Carter Jr., Gary Trent Jr. and Malik Monk"
"Well I think it's because a lot of nba players are the children of former nba players, or are related to former nba players.  Examples being Curry, Klay, Dlee, Wiggins, Gary Payton 2 on just the warriors.  Other examples are Kevin Porter Jr, Cole Anthony, Bol Bol, Booker, Jalen Brunson, Jae Crowder, Darius Garland, Jerami and Jerian Grant, Tim Hardaway Jr., Al Horford, Jaren Jackson Jr, Kevin Love, Kenyon Martin Jr., Wesley Matthews, Larry Nance Jr., Jabari Parker, Austin Rivers, GR3, Sabonis, Garrett Temple, Gary Trent Jr, Justise Winslow, Seth Curry, Marvin Bagley 3 (grandad was in the league)   That's 32 players who all probably had pretty good lives. A bunch probably come from parents who were coaches or well off as well like Michael Porter Jr."
"Herro to fight his clone, Poole to hang out, mpj to send through a time vortex to become a 31st century king, Gary Trent jr, Beasley to write an amorous memoir in 2043."
So does Gary Trent jr walk amongst the living or the dead?

"Recently there’s been some ***very specific criteria*** to win MIP. Those two criteria have been: first time all-star, make the playoffs as a first time starter. Another concept has been picking guys who aren’t in the 2nd year.  Making the playoffs has actually been the more predictive of winning the award but someone who doesn’t make the playoffs basically needs to be a first time all-star. Going back to Love, the only players to miss the playoffs have been Love (first time all-star), Dragic, and Ingram (first time all-star).  Dragic actually has been the only player since Love to not be an all-star or make the playoffs and win the award. 2nd year starter, but the suns improved by 23 wins (up to 48) and just barely missed the playoffs in a stacked western conference. He is the exception not the rule.  Picking a most improved candidate is actually pretty easy when considering these. Guys who haven’t been all-stars or are finally getting a full-time starting job on a potential playoff team.  My picks this year are **Lonzo**, **RJ Barrett**, **Garland**, and **SGA** as first time all-stars. Reddit hypes up SGA *a lot* but the rest of the NBA world hasn’t caught up yet. If he can get his first all-star appearance and put together a solid season he can get it. I think **MPJ** can get here too if he’s solid defensively.  For making the playoffs as a first time starter, my pick is **Gary Trent Jr.** I’m not wild about anyone else for this criteria right now. This one doesn’t usually make itself clear until late in the season. I like the raps to sneak in and GTJ will be a big part of that.  Putting it all in order I’d have Barrett, GTJ, Garland, MPJ, SGA, Lonzo."
"($5) Luka, ($2) Mikal Bridges, ($1) Gary Trent Jr, ($4) Tatum, ($3) Ayton  &amp;#x200B;  So, I'll begin on how I made this team. I started with... Ayton. Yep. Not Luka. Initially, I wanted Giannis, but he's already too old. Then, I was thinking of getting Jokic. The thing is, Jokic's defensive liabilities are really worrying. I'd have to build an extremely specific roster to fix that, and that took flexibility I don't have in this challenge. I scouted for other C's and found Ayton at 3, fairly priced. Immediately taking him.  Then, obviously, Luka came next. Now that I know that I won't get Jokic, I can get a heliocentric player in Luka. I mean, it's Luka, isn't it obvious? He's already insanely good. The offense would be centered around him.  Then, I got Tatum. You want to have atleast 4 shooters on your team, and with Ayton, that's a neccecity. I could get KAT at 4 but he's not laterally quick enough to keep up with wings and his defensive limitations make it risky. Zion is too limited and everyone else is too old. That leaves Tatum. A young, athletic, massive 2 way player with elite scoring. His shooting would compliment Ayton fantastically.  Last 2 were Bridges and GTJ. I just wanted shooting and solid defense. They're roleplayers, they can do their jobs well. They don't have massive offensive or defensive deficiencies and they can space the floor.  &amp;#x200B;  Immediately, this team is 2 way powerhouse because of how massive it is. Luka is 6'7 with a 7'0 wingspan (Estimate), Bridges is 6'6 with a 7'2 wingspan, Trent is 6'5 with a 6'7 wingspan, Tatum is 6'8 with a 6'11 wingspan and Ayton is 7'1 with a 7'6 wingspan. That is.... Insane. Literally insane. The ONLY flaw of this team is the fact that there isn't an elite perimeter defender, but when your average height on the team is 6'8 and the average wingspan is over 6'9, it'll be fine. Perimeter defense is about schemes, not individuals or steals or blocks anyways.  This length and height allows them to clog the lanes on defense and protect the rim at an incredible rate. Any good coach would be able to force ANY offensive player to take the worst shots because of how well this team can contest shots and force players to not even take the shot. The fact that you have multiple rim protectors is insane. This would easily be the best defensive team in the league, and one of the best in this simulation. I cannot understate how important this aspect is on defense.  This also allows the team to be the best rebounding team out of any team. They'd literally crash the boards and dominate with that. We saw how effective that was with the Bucks in the finals. Rebounding can save a team when shots aren't falling.  The height and length doesn't just help on defense. It allows the team to constantly be creating mismatches on offense. If you run a screen heavy motion offense, there will ALWAYS be 2 or so mismatches on the court. Mismatches are what basketball is all about.  With said mismatches comes the pure scoring ability of this team. Players 1-4 are all elite shooters (Luka is usually good in the playoffs) and that pairs amazingly with Ayton, a dominant inside force. Spacing is everything in this league and this team has it in spades.   Finally, Luka and Tatum are 2 dominant scorers in the playoffs, both are clutch and can close at an elite level.  Finally, the team is extremely young. A veteran bench would be needed but it will only get better."
"Ball Handler: Doncic   ($5) 1 or 1A best combination of youth and skill in the list. Age 22. This lineup would give him the ability to run any set he wants. The rest of the team would allow his defense weaknesses to be covered up (assuming the $1 guy buys in). If you're into traditional positions, he'd be PG.  Wings   Gary Trent Jr ($1)  Excellent shooter who would probably get a lot of room to shoot thanks to Tatum and Doncic. Has defensive skills - if he can be convinced to channel them.  On this team, likely to feast on all the open shots that Doncic/Tatum/Ayton will be providing.  Age 22. Traditional position: SG  Mikal Bridges ($2) All around glue guy.  Age 25.  Does multiple things well, could serve as clean-up both offensively and defensively, setting screens or providing help. Traditional set position: SF  Jayson Tatum ($4) 1 or 1a best combination of youth or skill. The best all-around player in this lineup. Age 23. Traditional position: PF  Big  Deandre Ayton ($3) Best young big on this list. Age 23. Can play in and out, switchable all around. Traditional position: C  Defensively switchable enough to help protect Doncic, offensively could pull off a lot of multiple sets with Doncic and Tatum capable of handling the ball as faciliator. Imagine the pick and roll in different combinations with these guys.  And probably most significantly, the youth of this team gives it both a high floor and a really high ceiling."
"Giannis and Jokic are the perfect front court duo honestly. They play off each other so well. However, they're both worth 5$ so im only left with 5$.   Looking at the list I have my bigs so I only need guards. I want a good scoring wing who can also defend so I settled on Edwards. He also has great potential to develop into an elite 2 way player  I only have 2$ now for my backcourt so Ill chose Lonzo Ball and Gary Trent Jr. Lonzo is an elite shooter and defender while Gary Trent even has some creating ability though I will mainly use him as a shooter. He's not the greatest defender but I have Lonzo and Edwards to cover for him  All this floor spacing should maximize Giannis and Edwards slashing ability and Jokic's playmaking will be deadly with these guys, especially since all of them are great off ball. KAT already plays a similar role in Minnesota with Edwards and Jokic is just an upgrade  So my team is  PG: Lonzo  SG: Gary Trent  SF: Anthony Edwards  PF: Giannis  C: Jokic"
Gary trent Jr - ant Edward's - durant - kat - myles
"Luka, Tatum, Ayton, Bridges, Gary Trent Jr.   We get to run PnR with Luka &amp; Ayton, defend like mad along the wings, have good shooting all around and have 2 certified iso crunch-time scorers.  Also this team is young so they can contend now but we don't need to worry about them aging out any time soon.  Also Bridges &amp; Ayton make this too easy, both guys should be more expensive"
Lamelo Ball  Gary Trent Jr.  Anthony Edwards  Jayson Tatum  Nikola Jokic
PG - Luka Doncic $5  SG - Gary Trent Jr. $1  SF - Giannis $5  PF - Robert Covington $1  C - Deandre Ayton $3
"Giannis, Tatum, Ja, Myles Turner, Gary Trent JR"
"Raptors have one of the brightest futures IMO. Top tier FO, top tier development team, probably a top 5 coach in the league, great young talent in OG, Gary Trent Jr., Siakam, and *hopefully* Scottie Barnes. The biggest thing working against us is that we're not a great FA destination beccause we're in a different country.  Raptors were a bad for awhile, there was a lot of effort to improve the FO and development team. Recently, even with the shortcomings in the playoffs it was mostly LeBron beating us, we had a solid team and the COTY.  Kawhi and Spurs had a falling out and we were able to get Kawhi for 1 year by trading DeMar, which was risky trading our star for an injury prone player who wanted to be in LA. We also traded an above average starting center for aging Marc Gasol who was the star in Memphis for awhile, picked up Danny Green, and fired our COTY to promote Nick Nurse. All these moves turned out and the Raptors were one of the best teams, we probably don't beat the Warriors with KD, but they didn't so we won. Still beat a super stacked 76ers, Bucks, and Warriors  The bubble season which was the season after we won we lost Kawhi, Marc looked washed af, we had one of the most injured teams in the league and we managed to have the second best record, and I think we would have made the finals and given the Lakers a run for their money if Siakam hadn't regressed so much during the pandemic start.  Last season we didn't have a playable center and we got unlucky with injuries and COVID, we had the 4th best record at one point until half our starters and coach got COVID.  The teams that I might avoid because they're inconsistent would be: Knicks, Hornets, Timberwolves, Pelicans, Magic, Cavaliers  Then there are middeling teams that are content with being average: Pacers, Blazers, Grizzlies, Wizards"
And it showed. Nash looked lost at times. And with that much talent it’s true. It can work only because their defense was not present so they didn’t need to work on their team defense like the raps do. When Gary Trent jr came to Toronto last year he said he was surprised and happy because we ran a defense here.
"Agree with most of the above, especially Herro, Russell, Kuzma &amp; Irving.   Some others :  - Michael “Curious Mike” Porter Jr.  - Gary Trent Jr.  - Spencer Dinwiddie - Danny Green (love the guy, but corncob city) - Dennis Schroeder  - Jalen Green - Danuel House - Grant Williams  - Robin Lopez - CJ McCollum - Jalen Suggs - Ben Simmons - Marquese Chriss  - Patrick Patterson"
Gary Trent Jr
Is [Gary Trent Jr](https://twitter.com/joshkim_/status/1442996416264253440) now the most handsome player in the NBA?
"Toronto got its Antetokounmpo (Alex, on a training camp deal), Scottie Barnes seems like a fun guy, and they re-signed Masai.  League is fucked!  ~~Honestly most of the FA signings weren't great but at least they retained Gary Trent Jr. for a reasonable contract and Barnes' energy and drive is infectious.  I like the kid already.  A lot.~~"
Gary Trent Jr is +55 so far
"Gary Trent, Jr is +55 in 29 minutes right now."
"Raps up 40. 9 guys have played. 8 of them are +15 or higher. Gary Trent Jr. is +46. Stanley Johnson is -2.  He's definitely been having a better year this time around, just feels like a very 19-20 Stanley Johnson kinda night for him."
gary trent jr. is +50 in tonight's game against the warriors.
"No he won’t, who’s going to max Gary Trent jr?"
"Imagine if Steph Curry was actually Michael Jordan, thats Gary Trent Jr."
I tuned into that game for a quarter when I saw twitter saying Gary Trent Jr. was getting hot and you could legitimately sign a G-leaguer to a 10 day contract who could rebound better than Baynes right now. Its wild.

One of the craziest attempted mutinies ever. Would be like if Gary Trent Jr tried to turn the Raptors against Lowry.
"OG, Siakkam, FVV, Gary Trent jr &gt; Tatum, Brown and smart in the long run. Their series last year was pretty damn close too. The Celtics didn’t improve and I believe the Raptors having 0 home games puts them in the worst situation of anyone this year. So Raptors have the better future."
"This pick had better be worth it.  Our guys look sad out there in more ways than one. Even the ones who play well just seem dispirited. Fred almost had a 5x5 and looked miserable. Probably because he knows no matter how much the team pleads, no help on the boards is coming. Masai is either incompetent, which I don't believe, or he's intentionally leaving this team without a rebounding center to tank.  Fine, tank, whatever, go for the draft picks. But stop making Siakam and OG play out of position at center *two weeks out from COVID*. Siakam lost 15 pounds. That's just gonna piss them off and strain relations with the rest of the organization, and ruin morale for the rest of the year even more than it already is. Having a high pick won't mean shit if we can't maintain the confidence of our own players. And frankly, they all look miserable.  Also, Nurse, for the love of god, run some actual plays on offense. And tell the guys to GRAB THE BOARDS. If I'm gonna waste time watching a team lose at least let me have fun doing it.  Gary Trent Jr. was awesome, though."
I enjoy seeing him share the backcourt with Gary “The Weeknd” Trent Jr.
Gary Trent Jr.      that's all.
blazers legend Gary Trent Jr
I would die for Gary Trent Jr
"He will just sign back with them next season and they will net Gary Trent Jr for the loan lol. As a Blazers fan, I would be so upset if this happened somehow."
"Powell was a major part of their championship team. Him, Pascal, and Fred, + OG who even though he was hurt for the playoffs was part of that team...idk, I just don't see how you let someone like that go for Trent Jr who also is likely to get overpaid. Raptors are the only team who have guys with legit championship experience under 30. If you're gonna let one of those guys go, it just has to be a better return than Gary Trent Jr at $5-$10m less on your books when you're gonna be over the cap ayway"
I honestly hate this trade. I don't see how Gary Trent JR is any better then Norm

"Those are called ""wings"" and mostly play SG or small ball SF because their strength as a SF would be more useful guarding SGs considering the height difference. A good example of an undersized SF is Kawhi. Slightly shorter but he's still able to play the position because of his length and strength. Other examples of undersized SF that performed way better at guard are MJ, Kobe, VC, Wade...they all have excellent size for a SG and only good size as a SF. Besides Wade, who was often faster and stronger than his matchup, they can abuse a smaller defensive match up. I think all the most versatile guards could play SF in college. Guards like Harden, Westbrook, even prime John Wall. I think they could've played SF but are just way more effective at guard. Less popular examples are all the ""wings"" in the NBA. Guys like Norman Powell and Gary Trent Jr. There's a plethora of 2/3s in the NBA. If you're about 6'5"" and faster, youre a big guard. Stronger? Small big man. That's about it."
"look at norman powell and gary trent jr before him, you'd probably consider them gaurds but they play along side lillard and mccollum.   The Thunder also played SGA at SF last year when they ran a three guard line up with CP3 and Schroder"
To be fair to Portland - they were not going to be able to keep either Norm or Gary Trent Jr. So swapping Gary for Norm essentially gives them an upgrade for a playoff push.
"My three year old daughter watches the blazers with us and runs around every game yelling ""I'm Gary! I'm Gary!"" Or ""You can be daddy Gary and I can be baby Gary."". And when she sees him on the screen she uses his full name ""There's Gary Trent Jr."".  For that reason alone I am more heart broken about this trade than any other trade ever."
"Man. Gary Trent Jr looks sad. Buuuuut, dude is a starter and one of the best shooters on the league."
She better write Gary Trent Jr in on that empty Raptors spot.
Gary Trent jr. has had a rough few games as a Raptor.
Gary Trent Jr has had a rough few games as a Raptor.
Honestly we all got real excited about Gary Trent Jr but I’ve been pretty impressed with Rodney Hood today. I thought he was just there for salary matching but he’s been alright
"As someone that openly called Gary Trent Jr. daddy, I look forward to tonight."
What point do you think you’re making there?   I love Gary Trent jr. I think he’s going to be really good. He’s not a good defender right now and certainly not as good a defender as Powell is.
I know you’re our resident troll but anyone that thinks Gary Trent jr was doing anything on opponents best players is absolutely clueless lmao
"First off I want to say I do agree with what you're saying to an extent, but there's another side to it too  Why is it necessary to be a fan of a team? What is wrong with being a fan of a player? I have guys who I have watched since college or their early years in the league, who I have just as much invested in as my hometown team. I don't think it's a bad thing to be a lebron fan or a steph fan or a Gary trent Jr fan, it's a players league after all"
I don’t think Zion fits with the others. He is 6’6 the same height as Gary Trent Jr.
Raptors could've used Gary Trent jr like 3 games prior lol
"Personally I think it would be foolish to trade Gary Trent Jr. I don't see a trade that puts them over the top that's realistic. Their best path to drastically improving is to flip CJ this summer. If Trent Jr. can continue to develop, I think that could allow them to move CJ and replace enough of CJ's contributions to allow them to prioritize defense."
Rodney Hood + Gary Trent Jr for someone make it happen.
Him taking that final step is the only way I could see Portland being a legit contender. Dame is a great first option but cj seems to be the weak link. Hes actually outstanding but if you want to win a chip as a two man show he needs to be top ten great and he's just not that. But if Gary Trent Jr can approach all star level then I think they become extremely dangerous
Dame scored more points in the last 10 minutes than any other player not named Gary Trent Jr
Gary Trent Jr turns into the GOAT every time we play Portland.
"Gary Trent Jr gets just enough of NAW's left arm right before the inbounds to affect it.  Took a couple replays to see it, but oh it was there.  Couldn't call it foul imo"
Gary Trent Jr
"Ideally no, maybe Portland gets a second back?  Hood is salary filler and I'm not high on Collins at all and he's basically salary filler. That being said, I'd rather include Kanter but that wouldn't work in the trade machine.   The other option is a Gary Trent Jr/AG direct S&amp;T."
"Works in the trade machine:  Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Orlando gets: Gary Trent Jr, Rodney Hood, Zac Collins"
"Portland gets: Aaron Gordon, James Ennis  Magic get: Rodney Hood, Gary Trent Jr. , Zac Collins  ???"
Your second best player has been Gary Trent Jr with established vets. Stop the bullshit
Gary Trent Jr
Gary Trent jr and lonzo ball are who I really want
Gary Trent Jr still gonna be a flamethrower though. Sign me up for 7 games
"If you took a drink every time Gary Trent Jr. passed the ball, you'd be thirsty at the end of every Blazers game.  He's not asked to create a lot for others, but still he holds onto the ball like it's a meme stock."
&gt; They aren't mediocre teams though  Dame has been so good that he's making people say a team with Gary Trent Jr or Enes Kanter as the second best player is average.
Gary Trent jr vs lakers.
I'd love to swap AG for Gary Trent Jr but I'm not sure how possible it is.
"Should have Gary Trent Jr in there somewhere. Maybe Kanter too.   I know Trent is staring atm, but he's a bench player - it's just because CJ is out"
"Steven Adams, Josh Hart, and a 1st round pick  Zach Collins, Gary Trent Jr, and a 1st round pick  Robert Williams, Pritchard, and a second round pick"
"I went back and looked at it and I think it should have been called on Gary Trent Jr. Not sure who it was actually called on, but he was in the lane the longest."
Nassir Little may end up being the best of the Zach Collins/Anfernee Simons/Gary Trent Jr draft pick group.
Gary Trent Jr
"Gary Trent Jr. isn't getting traded for any less than two firsts, the dude is legit and is going to get the BAG this offseason.  Oladipo would only be worth it in a sign and trade, as he's not staying in Houston and nobody knows where he wants to go."
LeBron James dunked on both Gary Trent Sr and Gary Trent Jr.
"Gary Trent Jr. and Patty Mills, every goddamn time"
Gary Trent Jr.    That is all.
Gary Trent Jr
"Gary Trent Jr. I thought he was supposed to be a 3 and D guy but he really doesn't do much on the defensive end at all, which is especially bad for Portland given their combined deficiencies. Like RoCo is the only guy who isn't a complete turnstile with Nurkic out unless they overplay Jones or Giles. Seems to me like Trent isn't really the answer for them other than a role player off the bench"
"Gary Trent Jr. has brothers named Grayson, Garyson, and Garydon."
Gary Trent Jr has made more 3s than Lonzo
"Gary Trent Jr. played for Duke, he'd be the starting SG I think over Seth."
"Kris Humphries was the only top 20 prospect from Minnesota for a looong time.  But since 2014, we've got:  2014 - Tyus Jones  2018 - Tre Jones  2019 - Matthew Hurt (turns out he sucks though)  2020 - Jalen Suggs  2021 - Chet Holmgren  2023 - Tasion Chatman  Then throw in some others who didn't quite crack the top 20 - Gary Trent Jr, Amir Coffey and Daniel Oturu (both on the Clippers), Zeke Nnaji (Nuggets) and Tyrell Terry all in that same time frame .    MN hoops is up and coming"
"Yes, im all for Minnesota stuff .  Sucks we are garbage but the overall MN basketball scene is up and coming.  Tyus Jones, Gary Trent Jr, Jalen suggs , Chet holmgren , Taison Chatman (top 20 in the class of 2023) all come from the twin cities.   Its nice to see since Kris Humphries was the last ""big thing"" to come from MN before Tyus, and he graduated high school in 2003"
&gt;Steph shouldn’t be in the mvp race.   How do u look at your self in the mirror after that  &gt;Dame has 3 Starters injured on his team  Curry has played and chris out and currys team is ten times worse u still have Gary the sniper trent jr Anfrenee Simmons and Melo ur whole damn team is full of snipers   &gt;scores more points and assist  Ur boo scores more assist cause u got better teammates and Dray mond in our system so the facilitator of this team ur boi scores .1 more points then curry curry averages more steals and Rebounds and has a 62 point game on Dames head lost the last game cause Dame has an ability to draw charges in Mid Air   &gt;So tell me how curry should be above lillard? Bullshit  It's simple curry has a worst team putting up similar numbers with triple teams and Box n 1s out in waves
That Gary Trent Jr. switch tho.  Flawless.
Everyone was calling that this was gonna be OG's breakout season..  **But can I take a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior Gary Trent f\*cking Jr?**  Every game he hustles like a mfer and every game he goes even harder. It's crazy!
Gary Trent Jr downloaded some clamps in the offseason
"Man Gary Trent Jr is amazing to watch,   Raptors just wanted it more than us tonight and it showed on the offensive boards. Randle gotta let the game come to him and move off the ball more something he can funny enough learn from RJ. But GG raptors hope to see OG and RJ in the all star game this year!"
- The 2021 Raptors are gritty as fuck.  - Fred VanVleet has ice in his veins.  - Gary Trent Jr. looks like one of the best defensive guards in the league.
Trent Jr 🤝 Payton II  Gary
Gary Trent Jr has been playing well defensively this season. Definitely not a turnstile. I think he's top 5 in steals as well
Active defense is contagious man. Like all of a sudden Gary Trent Jr on our squad is completely pestering the opposition now that he's been around Fred and OG for a bit. He even mentioned it in an interview that he doesn't want to be the defensive weak link (or something to that effect).
"I think they need Gary Trent Jr, Gary Payton II, Glenn Robinson III, Bol Bol, Cole Anthony, Seth Curry, Jerami Grant, Austin Rivers, Kenyon Martin Jr, Jaren Jackson Jr, Domantas Sabonis, and Larry Nance Jr.  They need all the second gens.  That'll be enough."
Have you seen Gary Trent Jr?  He can have any of our girls whether they saw the game or not.
Gary Trent Jr. 1st team all defense when?
For sure.. take some profit and move your bet (and a little bit of the profit) on something else that’s undervalued now - not sure what Harden MVP odds are now but something like that.   Or Gary Trent Jr making an all defensive team.
Gary Trent Jr putting the clamps on in crunch time as literally every Raptors fan predicted.
TIL Gary Trent Jr. is an eight-limbed mollusc
"Gary Trent Jr with the absolute brilliant and critical defence at the end. Also, Banton is looking better and better each game. Barnes and Banton are going to be a problem."
"Raptors fans better not say a fucking WORD about Gary Trent Jr, Cole Anthony or Jalen Suggs after this game lmao."
I'm here to talk about our Defensive Lord and Savior GARY TRENT JR.
Gary “Gary Payton” Trent Jr
Gary Trent Jr is Tony Allen with a jumpshot
"Game Notes   - Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.   - Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly   - Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.   - Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)   - Chris Boucher finally had a good game.   - Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.   - Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)"
Gary Trent Jr saved the game!
GARY TRENT JR CAN DEFLECT ME ANYTIME
"Gary Trent Jr has 1 rule   Deflect, deflect, deflect"
IS THAT GARY TRENT JR OR GARY PAYTON? WHICH GARY?
Gary Trent Jr with the lockdown perk
#GARY TRENT JR
Gary Trent Jr might have a say too!
GARY TRENT JR ALL DEFENSE 2021-22
I feel like parks aren’t huge outside of urban areas. In Minnesota Lifetime had some really competitive pick ups games. Pretty sure I saw Gary Trent jr and his dad running drills one day
Gary Trent JR - Suggs - FVV
"If I'm the Mavs I'm doing everything in my power to get two of Lonzo Ball, Gary Trent Jr, or Richaun Holmes this off season."
not a chance dude lmao. gary trent jr was a trashhhhhhhhhh defender with us. he's got t-rex arms too.
"&gt;So whatever source said that   It's the same one the OP listed above:  https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-draft-trade-talks-kyle-kuzma-montrezl-harrell-gary-trent-jr-tyus-jones/  Here's exactly what was said:  &gt; Montrezl Harrell’s decision on his $9.7 million player option is considered a genuine “50-50” either way at this stage, multiple league sources told HoopsHype.  &gt; Harrell could exercise his player option and be traded. The Lakers and Kings have discussed a deal centered on Kyle Kuzma and Buddy Hield, as The Athletic’s Shams Charania reported. Multiple league sources told HoopsHype that Harrell and the Lakers’ 22nd overall pick were also discussed in variations of the trade talks centered around Kuzma and Hield."
People say vlade was a terrible gm but forget he drafted great players like Gary Trent Jr.
"Gary Trent Jr, Jalen Suggs, pistons young guys, Ja and Jaren"
"Raptors should deal the 4, future unprotected first, Gary Trent jr.   for shai and the 6"
This is the Gary Trent Jr. dilemma
"Sounds like Gary Trent Jr. I like the kid, but I don’t like him for 16-20m per year."
"Also when he plays against Lakers. Patty Mills, Gary Trent Jr and most recently Cameron Payne. These dudes gain buffs when they play us."
I was slightly disappointed the Mavs didn't draft Gary Trent Jr for the same reason (Dirk played with Gary Trent Sr).
"Wiseman, Wiggins, and their 2 FRPs would be very worth it tbh. Wiggins will be off contract soon (and will most likely be able to be signed for much lower than max).  We'd have a young talented squad with Wiggins, Gary Trent Jr, Wiseman, OG, Jalen Suggs (raptors 4th pick)"
"A gap of 3% TS isn’t big enough to make a massive difference to me. It becomes a game of making the margins bigger than they really are + it’s just a fact that half the league has to fall on the side of below average for TS%. That has happened with Russ, with Ja Morant, Schroder, Siakam, FVV, Gary Trent Jr, and a bunch of guys I would consider great scorers even with below average TS%."
Norman Powell to Knicks is a great move.  Blazers losing Gary Trent JR AND Powell for nothing is gonna be crazy.  People say they need to go all in to convince Lillard to stay but they already kinda did  Traded two firsts for Covington   Then traded their best young player for Powell.  They NEED to retain him
"So, what you're saying is Gary Trent Jr will sign with Minnesota this offseason before ending his career in Dallas."
A much lesser trade but still very recent - the Norm Powell for Gary Trent Jr swap
"I know this post is a few days old but when I say build around Dame what I mean is stuff like:  A) Wasting time and money on old bums like Carmelo Anthony to ""win now"" instead of developing.. anyone else.  B) Signing CJ to a long, big contract extension shortly after Damian Lillard signed his supermax.  This one is very damaging.  This extension is just now kicking in, despite being signed shortly after Dame signed his supermax.  If Dame forces his way out this summer, they will be left with CJ's extension kicking in and they'll have to find a way to unload him now, possibly giving up assets just to do it because moving contracts like that isn't easy, despite him being a good player.  So not only will it be work to get rid of him they were also robbed of actually getting assets for him a year or so ago.  C) In a ""win now"" move, traded 22 year old rookie contract Gary Trent Jr for Norman Powell who just opted out and is now a FA.  What happens if Dame leaves?  Worst case they just RIP'd an asset, best they sign Norman to a big new deal and try to move him in the future.   We could rattle off examples for days, like how they don't have a 2021 draft pick because they traded it for Robert Covington.  So to respond to your initial statement, which offers a valid point but imo comes to the wrong conclusion.  They indeed did build around Dame, they just didn't do it very well.  It's also worth noting, given CJ's extension following shortly after Dame's that Dame himself very well may have been a vocal factor in this move.  As he was in wasting time on washed up Melo.  It's not something we haven't seen before, if franchises completely give in and essentially make their star the GM of the team it can backfire in the future (ie lebron with cleveland, and I see you with that lakers icon, if they aren't careful them too).  At least with LeBron he might leave your franchise desolate but you get a ring out of it so can't complain too much."
"I think there are a few good reasons.  1.) He’s from the same class as Luka, Trae, MPJ, Ayton and Gary Trent Jr.  If it wasn’t for that he’d get a lot more attention.  2.) He wants max $$ and he’s not shaping up to be a year-in year-out all star.  The league is changing and he may well get it.  The team that signs him might end up being a bag holder.  3.) Can you name a 6 foot nothing guy who carried a team to a championship?  Zeke.   That’s it.  CP3 might end up doing it too, but he also might fall short.  Max for a guy who would have to be the 3rd or 4th best guy on a championship team doesn’t sound right.  I can see a playoff team signing him for max and then dumping him to be a tank commander somewhere else 2 years later."
