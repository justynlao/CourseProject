this works sometimes. Stanley johnson did a decent job on lebron. And then there was tayshaun prince on tmac
The Raptors fanbase actually like Stanley Johnson?
"If Yuta, OG &amp; Stanley Johnson started a podcast together, the raptors fandom will be in tears"
He was the same way during the Raptors game. Elbowed Stanley Johnson in the face for defending him tight up the court.
Pretty sure it's 1 -1. Kyle did a dumb play in the bubble. And Aaron decked Lowry last night. He twisted his ankle last night trying to drive past Stanley the animal johnson
Pleasant: Watanabe and Stanley Johnson are actual good roleplayers   Unpleasant: Siakam continues to be inconsistent
Pleasant: Chris Boucher/Stanley Johnson/Yuta Watanabe - only mentioning one would be a disservice to the rest  Unpleasant: Terence Davis
Play him over Stanley Johnson
"yeah when the nets meet the lakers in the finals, they'll definitely need lebron stopper Stanley Johnson."
"Do you think Lowry's ass has Knee-DAR or something? Or that he knew Stanley Johnson would shove AG forward? No, Lowry sticks his butt out at the point the ball bounces off the rim. In other words, an ordinary box out motion."
I’m not even kidding the Nets should trade for Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson
Masai gonna get them to trade them for Stanley Johnson
"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
keldon is who stanley johnson was meant to be
Stanley Johnson having a career year defensively! He's a Raptor to the core now.
How big of a hole we have at Center and how many guards we have . You don’t understand how big that hole at Center is. Litterally we have no playable centres which leads to lot of small ball and heavy minutes. Then when you look at guards you see how much we lack size. We are playing Stanley Johnson 16 minutes lol
Y’all just really don’t wanna see Stanley Johnson as an all star do you?   Prize for making all star team should be early vaccination.
"Yeah they can do it with Baynes, McCaw, and Stanley Johnson. All expiring and none of those guys are real assets."
I love Stanley Johnson?
WE WANT STANLEY JOHNSON
OG is out too? Damn. Stanley Johnson needs to bring it tonight. (Non-ironically)
Siakam and OG are out this game... on an already thin backcourt. I see Giannis feasting this game. Unless Stanley Johnson goes super saiyan.
"Raptors would need to trade Norman Powell, but they could match salary with Powell, Aron Baynes, Patrick McCaw, and Stanley Johnson.   All four of those guys are expiring (Powell has a player option that he'll definitely decline)."
Raptors aren’t a playoff team yet.  Don’t let Stanley Johnson fool you. He’s done this before.
Raptors are now saying it's Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson &amp; Matt Thomas
Trade scraps for defensive players in the Stanley Johnson/Royce O'Neale/Torrey Craig mold.
I was so sure we’re would draft him.  Just like I was sure we had Donovan Mitchell but we got Luke Kennard.  And I was sure we were taking Devin Booker or Justise Winslow but we took Stanley Johnson.  Sacramento got a steal like he did in this clip
"Blockbuster trade scenario. Clippers gets Lowry, Toronto gets Kawhi, Serge, Danny Green, Philly gets Stanley Johnson, 2022 FRP"
"Not gonna win many games when you shoot 22% from 3 as a team.  And speaking of three pointers, what the fuck since when can Stanley Johnson shoot"
This is a weird one hahaha     Stanley Johnson is not available. We got the clamp bros now.
"Sounds like Stanley Johnson, Honestly though. I have to read whatever the scouts thought that would make him the consensus #1 ( or actually top 3 pick.) Because I feel sad for wolves due to everything, they have a good chance of losing next FRP, no leverage over any free agents due to lack of culture and marketability, but also because they REALLY REALLY need someone with  the impact of Draymond to teach this team and be a mentor for  edwards"
Is Stanley Johnson the greatest &lt;3 PPG player of all time? I think so
I love Stanley Johnson now
Stanley Johnson will NOT be out of the league next season
Im so here for this year's stanley johnson redemption tour. Feel good for the guy
Stanley Johnson is a revelation
Stanley Johnson is a playmaker now
Stanley Johnson gonna fuck around and win MIP
"larry  nance, even stanley johnson, semi ojeleye could be cheap to go get  just to have wing bodies"
I love Luka but the dude elbowed Stanley Johnson in the face vs the raptors but didn’t get called
Tbf that's 2021 dpoy Stanley Johnson you're talking about
If you can get clamped by Stanley Johnson you're not the best player in the NBA
Did stanley johnson absorb power from his teammates?
A year ago I never would have believed I’d be saying get Davis the fuck off the court so Stanley Johnson can play
"Even if he agrees to same salary per year, Warriors will still end up paying luxury tax and repeater tax. It will be tougher to fill out rest of roster. I think they will trade Oubre by deadline for a cheaper and older vet who can provide the same length and hustle. Not saying them exactly, but a Stanley Johnson or Harkless mold."
"Is waving guys like Watson, Bembry, Stanley Johnson really a high price to pay?"
We played Stanley Johnson at C over him....
I’m hoping we bring him back. I Stanley Johnson gets hurt we could use him
Stanley Johnson stole his minutes and after the last few games we know why   3pt sharpshooter &lt; defense
"Or more likely 2 players for 3. Your expiring salaries are McCaw, Stanley Johnson, and Lowry. And now I have completely unfounded images of Ujiri accepting a 76ers godfather offer for Lowry and his 30 M."
Dennis Smith Jr   Marvin Bagley    Stanley Johnson
just go watch stanley johnson then lol
"I also like Watanabe, speaking of out of nowhere. Looks like he could be a great 3&amp;d guy. Stanley Johnson also playing good. Throw in Powell and Davis and that's quite a bench."
"If the raptors can't get anything out of a player, the player usually sucks really badly. The raps usually maximize the talents of players, we're even making use of Stanley Johnson"
Wow I never knew he was 5th overall.   He would have been the highest drafted player on our team lol. Now he's passed the torch to Stanley Johnson.
"Maybe before, but Stanley Johnson has taken that role and the way he's playing, I'd rather have Stanley right now"
They are really about to turn Stanley Johnson into an NBA player 😂
Imagine losing to Stanley Fucking Johnson
Stanley Johnson fighting hard to keep his NBA career
OG did a fucking fantastic job on him 1v1 though. Stanley Johnson did a good job too but had more help D then OG did.
Bubble Stanley Johnson wasnt just a bubble thing.
Stanley Johnson played over 20 minutes and that was a good thing. 2021 really hits different.
Now its the Stanley Johnson redemption season.
Stanley Johnson
Luka sees Stanley Johnson in his nightmares.
"Raptors playing better which is nice. Making Stanley Johnson a competent player has gotta be a COTY move right there.  Technical on FVV was pretty lame considering Luka openly elbowed Johnson right before, lots of weak calls this game."
"Dudes like you are so weird. Stanley Johnson is garbage, that’s all."
enjoying the stanley johnson redemption arc
Scrub Doncic coming after our golden boy Stanley Johnson will do that.
Stanley Johnson always managing to do something dumb.
Stanley Johnson is a serviceable NBA player
Stanley Johnson is a solid nba basketball player. Let that sink in.
I am so here for the Stanley Johnson redemption tour.
If you’d told me a year ago that in 2021 we’d be watching defensive juggernauts Stanley Johnson and Dallas Mavericks square off I’d never have believed it
Stanley Johnson. This man showed out in college went to summer league and BULLIED EVERYONE. He looked like there was no fear then as soon as he gets to the league he disappears under Van Gundy’s system. Has some crazy outlier games every now and then like Gordon but no consistency.
"The Raptors big 3 of Siakam, FVV, and Stanley Johnson"
Stanley Johnson has been pretty fucken nice this season.
Stanley Johnson saw Rudy Gobert get a supermax contract averaging 11 points a game and realized he had been doing it wrong all this time.
"Actually, I seen some defensive potential from Stanley Johnson, if you seen him talk behind the scenes/interviews, he has a great head and attitube for this team :D"
"So much raptor fans made fun of Stanley Johnson last year, im so glad he's productive this year :D"
Hey remember when we gave Stanley Johnson 8 million dollars because he defended Kawhi well in a game once
We can say that we lost because Stanley Johnson full on tackled Rozier on the last shot though
You gonna trust a man that can't tell OG from Stanley Johnson?
"That’s a bad angle, need more than just one to come to conclusive evidence. And this poster thinks that Stanley Johnson is OG."
"Wait, is Stanley Johnson good now?"
I am totally here for the Stanley Johnson redemption arc
STANLEY JOHNSON
I'M HERE FOR THAT STANLEY JOHNSON ELITE CRUNCH TIME DEFENCE
Stanley Johnson has been genuinely impressive this season
The unexpected Stanley Johnson clutch lockdown D saving the game &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I owe Stanley Johnson a public apology
STANLEY JOHNSON CLAMP SZN LFGGGGGGGG
Stanley Johnson is a playable 3 and D NBA player. No seriously.
"Honestly there's merit to that.  I wouldn't go full Process Sixers, but given the highest draft pick on our roster is Stanley Johnson I think we could use a good lottery pick, especially considering how good the draft is this year."
"&gt;O'Neal disarmed another explosive opportunity to disappoint us on Monday, much to the relief of the Magic and NBA merchandisers. Following up his unique willingness to sign early and prevent the Magic from losing free agent Stanley Roberts, Shaq defused the jersey-number flap with Terry Catledge.  &gt;Shaq wisely decided not to challenge for Cat Man's No. 33, showing he is only taller than his teammates, not bigger. Shaq announced he will wear No. 32, his old high school number, instead of 33, his number at LSU. He said the Magic had ""no time for hard feelings"" if they wanted to progress toward the playoffs. The rookie not only said the right thing, he did the right thing, respecting Catledge's veteran status.  &gt;O'Neal wore 32 in high school because no 33 could be found in a laundry basket of hand-me-downs. He said he wanted 33 because people compared him to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who also wore 33) when Shaq made a sky hook, adding if he makes a no-look pass at the Orlando Arena it would be fine if fans thought of Magic Johnson (who wore 32).  https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1992-08-25-9208250132-story.html  [But there's also this video where he says he wore 33 because of Ewing so take anything he says with a grain of salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgWJqupz15w)"
"&gt; Drummond is not willing to limit himself to rebounding and garbage collection.  Half a season of Blake aside, who was Drummond going to stand aside for? Was he supposed to play third fiddle to RJax and Stanley Johnson?  The dude has had to shoot a ton because, until SexLand and Blake, he's never been in an environment where he wasn't told by his coach ""go *be* the offense"". He shared the ball fairly well with Blake in their limited on court time together, and was doing very well with SexLand while both guys were still healthy.  It's very possible he could be problematic about it, honestly, you could be right, but I feel like we'd have no way to know, because he's never been allowed to be in a healthy environment"
This this this.  The Raptors overachieved last year and are underachieving this year. Mind you the roster construction is bad. There is no starting Center. The team needs Lowry or Fred on the floor at all times or else it is barely an NBA team. Lowry hasn’t looked himself. In the last game Stanley Johnson was playing Center!!   There is a lot going on that is not Nick Nurses fault. If the team doesn’t have a few strong stretches through the year where we beat good teams and blow out bad teams I will be surprised. There is a lot of ball left.
"If Masai accepted trading Lowry for Matisse Thybulle as the main returning player, I'd immediately go to the Air Canada Centre and demand to see Masai to ensure he hasn't been drugged or kidnapped or blackmailed.  Thybulle has played 13mpg in 10 games this season so far and has looked terrible so far. We already got OG who fills the low volume 3nD wing except he is a better defender, better shooter, bigger frame all while being the same age. We already have Patrick McCaw, Nick Nurse favourite, who is a 3nD wing who actually plays as a backup PG (tho he is currently out) for us making him more valuable than Thybulle. We got Stanley Johnson who has surprisingly been good and fills the bottom half of the rotation energy hustle defense wing spot that Thybulle basically is. We got DeAndre Bembry who we just signed and could easily step in for a bench wing role with some ball handling.  Thybulle is just not valuable to the Raptors."
Sorry i didn't pay attention to that part. Baynes Stanley Johnson and one more I think? Maybe I'll go listen to it again
Starter Stanley Johnson... Here we go!
Bouchers been beating on a handful of teams this year. Now Stanley Johnson and Baynes on the other hand..
Go Wildcats! Glad to see TJ make a career for himself in the NBA. He was our best player on the 2015 elite 8 team over 5 star recruit Stanley Johnson.
"Tbf the Pistons where missing Grant, Jackson, Wright, and JAH. So I was hoping for a Stanley Johnson revenge game to keep the tank going."
"""Stumbling into Plumlee is Stanley Johnson."" Made me think ""... and with a flute up his nose, Ralph Wiggum."""
"I know our record this year, but I'm still shocked we are on this list.   We were hot garbage in the bubble last year after Brett Brown made his secrit adjustments to turn Ben Simmons into a full time PF during the break.   Pretty sure we gave up a 50 burger to TJ Warren and also lost on a game winner to Stanley Johnson lmao."
"Lowry/Bembry/Norm/Boucher/Baynes  TD/Matt Thomas/Stanley Johnson/Paul Watson/Donte Hall  Strong lineup, Raps win."
"The thing is that though the self-perpetuating cycle argument makes sense, the top of the draft recently leans heavily towards the East.  Over the last seven or eight years, the very top of the draft has been all Eastern Conference teams.  2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 an East team had the #1 pick.  Lot of Cleveland up there after LeBron Left.  Philly and Boston at the top of the draft in the last few years, lot of Orlando and New York a few years before that.  It's really just Sacramento and Minnesota that have repeatedly been in the lottery because it's usually like the 10th best team in the West is a lot better and so they end up lower in the draft than the 10th team in the East.      It's probably just as likely that it's the fault of bad front offices (no offense) than the cycle of the top West teams beating up on the bottom.  Orlando and New York have had a lot of swings in the lottery since 2012 and don't have much to show for it.  The Pistons picked Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson and Luke Kennard with the 8th, 18th, and 12th picks.  Charlotte completely whiffed on lottery picks from 2012-2017.      I think there have been some quirky things that have skewed the East draft results though, mainly that two good teams ""snuck"" into the top of thanks to really atypical situations.  The Sixers tanking + the Celtics fleecing the Nets meant for a few years there, the rich just got richer in the East and that really threw things off.  That really hasn't happened in the West, because the best teams have never picked high and for teams like the Rockets or Mavs, a lot of years they didn't even have a pick.  Warriors getting Wiseman is the closest thing."
Perhaps he and and Stanley Johnson will form “the next kawhi” duo in Toronto
Stanley Johnson on the floor or as I like to call him  FauxG
"Stanley Johnson, Jaylen Brown, Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Rui Hachimura, DeAndre Hunter, Patrick Williams, Issac Okoro"
I want Thybulle even though we have Stanley Johnson and DeAndre Bembry who do 90% of what Thybulle does.
"You underestimate how much of a boner our front office has for 0-and-D players. Pat Mccaw, Stanley Johnson, Deandre Bembry."
"Who's Thomas? Tristan Thompson? I would gladly deal Thompson for Bembry or Stanley Johnson lol, Thompson is inefficient, slow and can't defend anymore, and a bad fit here"
We’ve been playing stanley johnson non garbage minutes.   At a certain point u just have to make what u have work
Stanley Johnson has been in the league no less than 15 years but is still somehow only 24
"Most of my bad takes over the years have come from my insistence on making judgement calls about draft classes despite rarely watching college ball and only really looking at mock drafts and highlights. I'm a real nephew in that regard but I'll never change.   Some examples of my worst takes:  -Stanley Johnson should have gone top 3 (Side note, I did predict in that draft that Myles Turner would be a solid starter with star potential but only because I accidentally watched a Texas game one day because I was snowed into my house).   -Kemba Walker was a future GOAT and would turn the Hornets around for good. I had only watched his UConn highlights so I had no clue who he was. Obviously he turned out pretty good, but not quite what I thought   -i also thought that draft was the turning point for American's in basketball because like half of the top 10 picks were from other countries.   -The Celtics fucked up with Tatum, really though he was a bust. I just didn't like the way he spelled his first name.   -Same draft, thought DSJ was clearly going to be the best player.  Could go on like this forever lol. My draft takes are always trash, but it's fun"
"Nurse and Masai could definitely build a contender with no blue chip names or prospects. Nurse could surround Embiid with Fred, Matt Thomas, Stanley Johnson, and Yuta and put together a good product on the floor"
Who was saying that? That's such a hot take lol. He at least showed something unlike guys like Stanley Johnson and Josh Jackson
"Just a year ago, if you told me Stanley Johnson would be a solid rotation contributor, even just here and there - a few shots at a time with some high effort defense, AND didn't turn the ball over automatically after touching it for three consecutive seconds.... I would've laughed in your face.  It's nice being wrong sometimes."
Are you guys joking??  Stanley Johnson is ashamed of yall
"No its because we dont play man 2 man. Theres a lot of switching and doubling/tripling so its not the because of one dude that Embiid struggled. A month ago Stanley Johnson played phenomenal D against Luka and a reporter kept trying to ask him how he was able to do it and trying to guve Stanley credit for it, but he kept saying that it wasnt him it was the teams defensive system."
"Stanley Johnson shooting 40% for 3 as well. Low volume tho, but its a huge improvement."
I still want cade and i am willing to part with 1 patrick mccaw and 1 stanley johnson (he’s good now i promise).
"Yeah you can’t challenge anything that isn’t called.  A few weeks ago Rozier got fouled by Stanley Johnson at the buzzer and instead of getting FTs to go to OT there was no call. We couldn’t challenge, L2M report said the refs were wrong."
"Most important ability is availability, making Winslow a bust of a draft pick. Not that my Pistons did any better that year, with Stanley Johnson. He’s available, just not any good."
&gt;Wouldn't Pat Mccaw and Stanley Johnson be better than nothing other than being nice?  I would take nothing over Patrick McCaw and Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson vs Justise Winslow was supposed to be the next great rivalry.
Stanley Johnson
"He's even been pretty decent these past few games. He's made a couple nice defensive plays, some flashy passes and cuts, and he runs in transition. He still had a couple of obvious mistakes this game, but everyone looks less error-prone when they're playing next to Stanley Johnson."
I’ve always liked Henry Ellison’s game. The guy just never caught a break. But Detroit ruins everything. Detroit drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell. And There has to be a spot for James Young somewhere.
"I don’t remember if we lost 50 games, but the 2018-2019 second half of the season Pels were a lot of fun to watch. The roster sans AD was Jrue and a bunch of scrappy guys including Jahlil Okafor, Kenny Hustle, Stanley Johnson, Dairis Bertans, Ian Clark, Frank Jackson and Christian Wood (😥).   I remember we beat Denver and Utah on the road then got 40 pieced by Orlando. Good times."
"So maybe reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. He said pistons are fools for   1) Bad draft picks 2) bad trades   And you're out here flexing about drafting middleton (traded after one meh rookie season) and dinwiddie (two bad seasons and walked? Cut? Idk) doesn't matter if you drafted them if they never performed for you.   Let's look at your other picks  2020 - killian hayes (project pick so he gets some leeway but bad as a rookie, gets injured, out for season)  2019 - sekou (has shown flashes but is looking pretty bad overall)  2018 - no firsts, traded for blake who had one good season and is now one of the worst players in the nba not even taking into account his contract  2017 - kennard (ok player, traded for Sadiq who looks like a promising roleplayer)  2016 - henry ellenson (???)  2015 - stanley johnson (bad)  2014 - dinwiddie (been over this)  2013 - KCP (improved after leaving, pretty bad in detroit)   So in conclusion: for the most part the pistons have either   A. Drafted poorly B. Developed poorly C. Signed people like Josh Smith  That's OK, it looks like they're making progress but I don't know why you're being sensitive about your team's shitty history and talking up players you essentially didn't even develop."
Same issue with Stanley Johnson. Seems like a Pistons issue to me.     Cleveland has been pretty up front about jacking up his USG to increase trade value. I think that was reported before the beginning of the season IMO.
"If you look at how Stanley Johnson is playing for the Raptors, just imagine what they could’ve done with Wiggins"
I thought Stanley Johnson was going to be a star
"He was bad but he also did some really great stuff like taking Stanley Johnson into his home as a rookie, when Stanley's mom died."
"So norm, Matt thomas, Baynes and Stanley Johnson would make the numbers work. But why toronto would do that i don’t know"
"Even a package of Baynes, Boucher, Patrick McCaw and Stanley Johnson only amounts to $21.3 million, not enough to take Drummond back. So if Powell isn’t a part of the framework, the Raptors are looking at sending out five players, at least two of whom are in the rotation right now. You know I’m fond of Raptors 905, but that’s a lot of roster space to make up, and the tax bill escalates quickly when you’re taking on salary and signing three or four new players, even at the minimum. And that’s before the consideration of draft pick compensation to make any of this worth Cleveland’s time. The Knicks and Thunder both have cap space they could rent out for assets, but little of that helps because it’s the Raptors, not the Cavaliers, who are taking on too large a salary no matter the deal structure. There’s always a way, just not a straightforward one here.  For those reasons, a Drummond acquisition seems unlikely. Since the Raptors don’t leak much themselves, there’s space for other teams to exploit an obvious need — a centre on an expiring deal — and use that for leverage in the market. It’s happened before.  That's from the raptors athletic reporter. It just doesn't seem possible"
"If the Raptors give up Norman Powell for Andre Drummond that's such a damn fleece.  Just to make the salaries match you'd have to offer Powell, Baynes, McCaw and Stanley Johnson. That's still too much.  I think Lowry is going out but it'll be a 3-team trade. Lowry will go to a contender."
"Raptors get: Jae Crowder 2 first round picks (protected) and maybe a 2nd round pick if raps play hard ball  Suns get: OG Anuoby, Stanley Johnson, Patrck McCaw."
I really thought Stanley Johnson would be a star or atleast a elite level role player.  He’s been a decent 3 and D role player for us though
"OP must've had a brain fart, but I think Stanley Johnson is 4th on this list, OP probably just erroneously typed ""Magic"" instead of ""Stanley"""
Stanley Johnson????
"I think the nuggets would be more interested in Stanley Johnson, I could see them making a move for him"
Stanley Johnson for both
"last season stanley johnson was something, but at least you could still believe in him  baynes is just useless with 0 room for trajectory"
Stanley Johnson is a bum bruh. Get a life loser
I love Jayson Tatum his game reminds me of Stanley Johnson who can dribble
Give us a first round pick and you can have the one and only god himself Stanley Johnson
"&gt; We have like 8 guys shooting above 40% from 3,  and we have Pascal shooting way below his average.  &gt;with 4 of them shooting above 43% (including Stanley Johnson and Bembry, 2 guys who historically aren't shooters).  Those two have taken so few 3 point shots it can't be moving the needle that much. Bembry has taken 12 total threes."
"BBRef calculates DRTG slightly differently than stats.nba.com does, which is why there's that slight difference. Whether we're 16th or 18th, we've been mediocre on defense and we can't afford that.  &gt; Also our offensive rating has improved from 12th last year to 6th.  And I think that's entirely unsustainable. We have like 8 guys shooting above 40% from 3, with 4 of them shooting above 43% (including Stanley Johnson and Bembry, 2 guys who historically aren't shooters).  I find it hard to believe that jumping up about 10 spots in our ORTG after losing one of our better and more consistent scorers is sustainable.  Do I think we're a terrible team? No, I expect we'll land somewhere in the 3-5 seed. But even if we end up as the 10th best offensive team this season, our defense needs to be much better in order for us to really make noise."
"Obviously 2016. Stanley Johnson was garbage, he couldn’t dribble, defend, attack, or do anything. &amp; you’re saying sophomore Johnson was considered a Lebron stopper? Literally no one thought we’d beat them. I literally expected to get swept.   Lebron did not “kill our franchise,” franchises go through up and down phases, it’s literally how sports are."
"Are you talkin bout the 2007 team or the 2016 team? Because I for sure remember back in 2016 Stanley Johnson getting a lot of press for being the “new up and coming Lebron stopper”. If that’s not “hope for a successful playoffs run”, then idk what is. And if you’re talking bout the 2007 team, the Pistons were looking to do a third straight appearance in the NBA Finals and second ring in 3 years. They were also the number one seed in the EC. So which team is it?"
"If its really based on most improved. I nominate Stanley Johnson. He went from an unplayable turnover machine who couldnt score if you handed him the ball alone in the paint to a good defender who shoots 1-2 3s a game at 40%, and can make some decent passes.  Is he a great player now? No. He's an end of bench guy you can throw in for a little extra defense and maybe a corner 3.  Is he like 1000x improved over the player who last year I would have guessed would never play in the NBA again, yes. I actually think Stanley Johnson will get an NBA contract at the end of this year."
Stanley Johnson this year is a completely different player he even talked about it he is just trying to be a good role players now.   It's also different situations this is like playing mcaw over our guards. Also Baynes is 34 he isn't gonna come in as a better player next year. Johnson is like 24 and was a lottery pick plus we signed him for two years and he is taking rhj spot essentially.
stanley johnson has played himself into a contract already this season
Hey man last year he kept playing Stanley Johnson when we were all like what the fuck. Trust the guy
But who's guarding Stanley Johnson?
"I’ll take Jimmy, Hero and Two First for Lowry and Stanley Johnson  That’s fair"
Just referencing you guys since you recently did it with Stanley Johnson.
"&gt; Stanley Johnson  You mean the guy averaging 3 points per game for a below .500 team who has a total of 20 postseason minutes since his rookie season?  &gt; Danny Green  He showed a shot pretty early. He shot 37% from 3 his second season, and then 44% in year 3.  &gt; KCP  In years 2-4, he shot 34% from 3 and averaged 13.7 ppg. Ntilikina's best season saw 32% and 6.4 points.  Frank is nowhere near where Green and KCP were after 3 years in the league. And Johnson hasn't exactly been a stellar role player."
"I think it is mostly luck and basically a crapshoot. For example the Suns drafted Booker at the 13th pick but he was mocked around there and the Suns would have likely picked Mario Hezonja or Stanley Johnson instead if they fell. Similarly the draft class they got Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss was seen as an amazing draft class but ended up sucking. Kelly Olynyk was drafted by the Celtics who are seen as a great drafting team and I remember during the GM/front office survey he was seen as the biggest steal of the draft and not Giannis who was drafted two picks after him.  Also, another talking point people talk about is ""well, he was drafted by the right team and developed him is the reason he busted."" This may be the case were one team brings up the best of a player more than another to a certain extant but I think this is severely overrated as well for true busts. If this was case we would see a lot more busts who sucked on one team all of a sudden blossom on another that unlocks their potential. For example Josh Jackson was still only 22 years old when the Suns gave up on him and still was extremely young. If he had the super high potential that was hidden away and not developed because of the Suns he would have turned into the next Kawhi lite or w/e when he switched teams. The last time I can think of this sort of happening when one player is seen like a bust and then blossoms on other team is Tobias Harris but even he doesn't entirely fit the scenario."
"I didn’t even realize that was him lol, did him and Stanley Johnson switch hairdos?"
Never forget Detroit picked Stanley Johnson #8 overall once
only stanley johnson thought that
Gonna see a lot of Stanley Johnson today
"There a lineup, Flynn, Stanley Johnson, OG, Yuta and Baynes ... And its working."
"I really wished Stanley Johnson would come good. Especially considering we chose him over Michigan native, Piston fan Devin Booker. Fml."
"I’d argue we’re still feeling the consequences of that draft, it set us back so damn much.   Also you’re so lucky you have Devin Booker ... I was SCREAMING for us to take him in the draft, he’s literally a Pistons fan from Michigan, and we fuckkn took Stanley Johnson 😭"
What this game shows is that Kings need to trade for more raptors players. We still have McCaw and Stanley Johnson left and both are defense specialist.
"I think it comes down to whether this season for the Celtics was a bump in the road or something more permanent. The Celtics already have their superstars and don't really have the flexibility to surround them with much more in the near future. It comes down to Tatum and Brown's development.   &gt;OG’s extension kicks in, GTJ is worse than Powell and is an UFA. Stanley Johnson is an UFA too.   OG's extension is $18M AAV for 4 years. Considering the improvements he makes every year, that's hardly crippling. GTJ will get somewhere around there as well most likely.   Let's assume the salary cap stays is around $110M for the next 4 years (itll probably rise), $36M for 2 guys 22 who for arguments' sake at least have higher ceilings than Marcus Smart is very ideal.   Neither FVV nor Siakam are untouchable. They will have another year off their contracts, making them easier to trade.  The optimism comes from the fact that the Raptors have the chance to get high picks in consecutive years to get their 2 stars (like the Celtics did with Brown and Tatum). And if we do get a star player through the draft, the supporting cast is ready made with the potential to be a lot better than what the Celtics have surrounded Brown and Tatum with."
Remember in the 2016 playoffs when Stanley Johnson said he was in Lebron's head because the Cavs only won by 5 points in game 1 of the series?   Good times
"It’s right there in the comment, “Stanley Johnson.”"
Stanley Johnson was -7 though
Stanley Johnson 0 for 6 and -7
stanley johnson -7 in 20mins in a 50 point blowout lol
Stanley Johnson still manages the -7 😤
"Meanwhile, Stanley Johnson managed a -7 in 29 minutes of a 53 point win."
shoutout stanley johnson being -7 in a game where we won by 53
Lol team wins by 53 and Stanley Johnson still a -7
uhh Stanley Johnson -7 with zero points. Lead apparently shrank by like at least 7 points while Stanimal was in there.
Stanley Johnson -7 lmfao
Stanley Johnson -2 lol
"Raps up 40. 9 guys have played. 8 of them are +15 or higher. Gary Trent Jr. is +46. Stanley Johnson is -2.  He's definitely been having a better year this time around, just feels like a very 19-20 Stanley Johnson kinda night for him."
Uhh  If 6th is Boucher and 7th is Bembry I guess 8th is Paul Watson and 9th is Stanley Johnson  We are not a deep team this year.
"Why you probably shouldn't necessarily worry about the #1 HS Junior and waste time studying their games:   Zion was the #5 recruit in his class.  Bol Bol was 4. Romeo Langford was 6.  Nassir Little was 2.   Trevon Duval was ranked ahead of Collin Sexton and Trae Young.  Josh Jackson and Harry Giles? 1-2 over Tatum.   Skal Labissierre was ahead of Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, and Brandon Ingram.  Karl Towns was 5th. Cliff Alexander was 4th, ahead of him. So were Mudiay, Jah, and Stanley Johnson.  Austin Rivers was ahead of Anthony Davis and Bradley Beal   Josh Selby was #1 in his class. Kyrie was 4th."
Rodney Hood and Stanley Johnson..
Patrick Williams is gonna be what I thought Stanley Johnson would be.   The Klaw is probably a little much but I think Pat can be like Ron Artest(without the general Ron Artestness)
stanley johnson my fucking god
"Toronto is pretty good at helping troubled players. Stanley Johnson has been decent here, he’s even a fan favorite, McCaw has had a good game or too. I haven’t watched a game with GTJ or Hood playing yet, but when I look at the box score, 27 min 13 points. I don’t really mind it, as long as he plays ok defense, and can spark something on the bench, I don’t mind."
"&gt;Bucks with Giannis  Giannis was predicted as worthy of the risk/reward as a draft pick around the 15 range and sure enough Bucks were picking in that range. If they had the 5th pick in that draft and ""reached"" to pick him I would give them a ton of credit for that but he kinda just fell into their lap. Same thing with Devin Booker on the Suns. He was seen as a pick in the 15 range and he was picked right around there. If Suns had the 8th pick in the draft for example I suspect they would have picked Stanley Johnson or Justise Winslow like anyone else. How much of these great picks (and btw I am not saying Devin Booker was as great of a pick as Giannis, not even close) are just the prospect falling into their lap and how much of it is having better scouting than your rivals?"
Any first you get from Philly for the next couple of years is basically a second at this point with how good they’ve been. And furthermore what does Thybulle do well other than defend? The dude’s a 30% three point shooter and a 57% free throw shooter 😂😂😂 this dude is basically Stanley Johnson with a YouTube channel. Maxey’s the only legit asset we were really getting.
Man Stanley Johnson still sucks. Boy looked like a veteran as a rookie
"Like i said there is a big difference between being worth 30 million and being worth the minimum, it's like you can't read. No person capable of averaging 14 rebounds a game in an NBA game should make the minimum, it completely stupid. Andre Drummond the two time all star an all nba player is currently making about half what Stanley Johnson is at 27, and you don't fucking know who Stanley Johnson is.   And yes unlike you biased ass i'm capable of recognizing when something is bad for the league. Having the championship affected by guys signing in march while essentially not counting against the cap, because someone else is paying their salary is a horrible fucking look."
"I know who Stanley Johnson is lol dont underestimate what a fucking nerd i am. I do kinda feel your point and maybe im exagerrating but to me Drummond is a guy whos stats dont tell the whole story. Maybe playing with lebron will change him and ill eat crow but there is a legit basis for my comments, i think detroit and cleveland fans would agree."
"Giannis is better but why y'all freaking out. Zion is an all star who is scoring at a historical efficiency, not Stanley Johnson."
"I don't think anyone is saying Drummond is the best player ever. But you are arguing he should makes than around half of what Stanley Johnson make, a guy you have no idea who is. That is just beyond dumb. ANY guy who can get 14 rebounds on average in the NBA shouldn't make anywhere near the minimum."
I was referring to Stanley Johnson but you could make a case for Fred as well. Averaging 20/4/6 40%38%85% while playing defence at a extremely high level
Stanley Johnson with 11 pts 2 assists and 2 blocks. He's really a legit NBA role player now.
Raptors still might squeak this out even though Blazers have been in total control. With Stanley Johnson no longer in the game Siakim might be getting some big buckets soon...
"Stanley Johnson is a serviceable bench guy these days. Actually really good on defence but his offense is mad inconsistent. Still I really like the kid’s upside I hope we re-sign him and keep working on his development, kid has great effort"
If the world turns on me I know Stanley Johnson got my back
Siakim is having issues on the drive because the Blazers aren't even guarding Stanley Johnson
Nobody personifies lack of confidence like Stanley Johnson beginning to run to chase his 3 pointers for offensive rebounds even when they happen to go in
That used to be Stanley Johnson every play losing the ball. Hes so much better now
Fucking Stanley Johnson!
stanley johnson my god
At least Stanley Johnson can still play some offense.
"I mean, on the one hand we’ve been bad in the 3 quarter like half our games.    On the other hand our best player of the 2nd half is Stanley Johnson so I don’t know what to say about anything anymore"
ayo Stanley Johnson looks like less angry NBa Youngboy
We have Stanley Johnson and Aron Baynes. ECF run coming up.
"Exactly, so why were the Raptors so adamant about getting him? They already have Stanley Johnson."
"Pat Will by a lot. Was never high on Okoro, just too raw and Stanley Johnson-esque"
We’ll throw in Stanley Johnson as a sweetener
We have one barely used Stanley Johnson that we could trade for a sprinkle donut
"And yet, the guy with all the CIF SS championships is...Stanley Johnson lol."
"Would your fanbase be upset if thybulle came too, if we gave back like, bembry or Stanley Johnson?"
"Good players like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Matt Thomas and Paul Watson?  You drop him into any bottom dwelling team and he'd look like freaking Bradley Beal."
"Stanley Johnson sucks but he isn't next level, do-everything wrong-and-then-some terrible like Baynes  Edit: This post made me realize that Jaden McDaniels and Jalen McDaniels are two different people and some confusion I've had during the season now makes a lot more sense"
"It was a nice and balanced W, but I’m not taking much from it when they Raptors were forced to start Stanley Fucking Johnson because they were decimated by injuries lol.  Nice to see a career high for Pat tho. That pick is looking real nice."
"One of the better and most balanced games we’ve played all year, but I don’t take much from it being the Raptors were starting Stanley Fucking Johnson because of all their injuries."
"I'm not sure if this is the no fans effect, but whatever it is, it's insane and unprecedented.  What's crazier still to me is that this seems to be affecting almost every single shooter on every single team. True, the Raps offense is a lot of drive and kick, but Lowry, Boucher, Norman, and even Stanley Johnson are having career years from 3. Boucher and Johnson in particular were awful from 3 in past years."
Kawhi Leonard was replaced with Stanley Johnson.
I felt that way as well but pretty much just because Winslow was a wing and Okafor was a center. But I also thought Stanley Johnson was gonna be a top 3 player from that draft.
i enjoyed the stanley johnson tony snell matchup
Stanley Johnson perfectly summarizing every Raptors fans reaction to that Snelly shot
So impressed with Stanley Johnson taking advantage of his opportunities even when they aren't plentiful
Stanley Johnson has gone from worst player in the league to someone who will stay in the NBA.
Stanley johnson making 3's on these clown hawks too      19 point lead with 3 starters missing and still lost this game
Stanley Johnson is clutch as fuck
"Raps have yuta and Stanley Johnson, they're not really well known but I honestly think they have two very good wings on their hands. I hope they blossom and get their due"
Toronto really went out and got the  legendary Stanley Johnson and Henry Ellenson duo.  Could you try any harder to be us
Brandon knight   Andre Robertson   Stanley Johnson   Kwame brown   Zara pachulia
TD2 and Stanley Johnson should do it
Stanley Johnson just doing Stanley Johnson things
Stanley Johnson saw he was compared to Kawhi and Decided to ball out.
Stanley Johnson with the MVP numbers
"Stanley Johnson is likely not in the rotation on a contender to be honest. He is a negative on offense and is probably best used as a the third string SF or 9th/10th man.  I mean dude averaged below 3 points before tonight and still has a PER36 ppg of 8.9, with a fg% of 39%. Good game for him tonight but let's not get ahead of ourselves"

Stanley “LeBron Stopper” Johnson
my “stanley johnson will be good” predraft takes finally coming true
Remember when Stanley Johnson was on the Pistons  and had 2-3 good games guarding Lebron. He was given the “next Lebron stopper” title. Boy that seems like so damn long ago now.
Stanley Johnson plays the game of his life and the Raptors lose to boot. All around great night for Raps fans
Detroit Pistons legend Stanley Johnson
Give Stanley Johnson some help
I trust a Stanley Johnson 3 more than I do a VanVleet 3.
Stanley “DESPITE THE LOSS” Johnson. Put some respect on his name
MVP candidate Stanley Johnson*
"Stanley ""kawhi"" johnson"
"Stanley Johnson at halftime 3-7, 10-3-3, 2STL, 0TO, 0PF. Its Randle's award this year but Stanley Johnson is my MIP. Last year he was entirely unplayable, worse than Baynes this year."
"Would you say our team regressed massively defensively?  We are one of the worst teams defensively in the league.  Siakams numbers are fine when he's partnered with NBA players but he's been stuck with Yuta, Bembry, and Stanley Johnson for a lot of time.  A guy as big, fast, and long as Siakam is isn't a worry in my mind. We need more talent."
Stanley johnson getting DPOY
Ok but have you seen Stanley Johnson play significant minutes?
I still believe in Stanley Johnson
Pistons specifically suggs is tough cuz he would help but we also just spent last years pick on a guard too. I’ve seen the pistons make so many mistakes it’s really tough for me to trust a guy that has a lot of question marks. I feel my draft mind is always skewed since I’m just used to pain and Stanley Johnson type players
"Do you understand how bad the expected value of a bottom half of the lottery pick is? Here's the last 10 #8th overall picks   Obi Toppin  Jaxson Hayes  Collin Sexton   Frank Ntilikina  Marquese Chriss  Stanley Johnson  Nik Stauskas   Kentavious Caldwell-Pope   Terrance Ross   Brandon Knight    Look at this list. Sabonis is way, way better than basically every single person listed. The average expected value of the 8th pick or lower is like ""solid role player"", not ""All Star"".    Even the Raptors would trade a low lottery pick for Sabonis. Even if he doesn't fit your system, Sabonis would be more beneficial to you than some decent role player that you're most likely going to draft."
i looked him up on youtube and is it a running joke that he constantly hates on stanley johnson lol that’s kinda hilarious
Imagine making a Stanley Johnson breakdown video.
"I want the competitive tank lol. If you lose at least lose with style. I don't wanna watch Stanley Johnson try lead a team for a whole season while Siakam, Kyle, Fred, and OG eat popcorn on the sidelines"
How does Stanley Johnson lose two jump balls against Beal lol
"Also shout out to Stanley Johnson for denying Kawhi the ball. That's pretty much the only reason he started, to make it difficult for Kawhi and then when he got the ball we doubled him."
"3 guys from the g-league roster, Bembry and Stanley Johnson is the five that Nick Nurse wants on the floor in the 4th quarter of a close game... I think Masai wants a higher pick for once.  Edit: spelling"
Dude makes so many good cuts just for Stanley Johnson to pass out the ball
LOL at Stanley Johnson starting.
Stanley Johnson
wizards game? we just gave up like 350 points last night to a team that started stanley johnson and malachai flynn
Bro we started Stanley Johnson
"Bro he's coming to the Raps for Stanley Johnson and a second round pick, I asked Masai already"
"Was that Stanley Johnson saying ""WOW... fuck that shit..."" lmao. The double replay was very awkward."
We need another angle from behind Stanley Johnson to see if there was actual contact.
This man really couldn't allow y'all to see him get clamped by Stanley Johnson so he grabbed his head until the damn free throw line!
Remember the Stanley Johnson/Bron beef that lasted 2 games
Apparently Stanley Johnson knocked his hair right off his head with that brutal foul
And I’m Stanley Johnson
"Being a Stanley Johnson fan sucks. I don't care what people say. Every year something frustrating. Just feels if he can't achieve this or that his career is a failure. It's okay to not like him but bringing him down and down and not thinking he belongs with the best is what gets me annoyed. I know it's fraction of people wo hate him, but games like this inflate their egos. I just want Stanley Johnson to get that respect other greats seem to have."
Stanley Johnson really had a positive impact with 0 points
Stanley Johnson: Yes?   Lowry: No
"lmao I just saw this with Stanley Johnson, what's the original one"
"Being a Stanley Johnson fan sucks. I don't care what people say. Every year something frustrating. Just feels if he can't achieve this or that his career is a failure.

Nurse about to run a perfect ATO play to get stanley johnson a wide open three
Stanley Johnson is hella not back next year... Guy is playing for a job somewhere.
should stanley johnson be out there right now? In the middle of the game like that.
Stanley Johnson wanted for attempted murder after that brick
The disrespect to lotto pick Stanley Johnson
infamous lebron stopper stanley johnson
We’re starting Stanley Johnson what do you want from us
Well Stanley Johnson once told us he’s definitely in LeBrons head so I don’t see what the issue is for Toronto
Stanley Johnson
OG Anunoby and Stanley Johnson  OG Anunoby and Jeremi Grant
Glad we have a proper playmaker off the bench now. Letting Stanley Johnson occasionally run point was sending me to an early grave
"Nuggets broadcaster gets it... "" 1st guy ""Stanley Johnson shooting 35% from 3, not bad"" 2nd guy ""used to not be able to shoot at all"" ..."
Stanley Johnson over Yuta
Couldn't stop thinking of this line when Gillespie elbowed Stanley Johnson in the head 😂
"Stanley Johnson is a huge, huge bitch."
I will accept no Stanley Johnson slander!
lol i remember when we also said this about stanley johnson
lol i remember when we said this about stanley johnson
So overrated he should be traded to the raptors for Aron Baynes and Stanley Johnson /s
"If player has a talent he will develop everywhere. What players Wolves failed to develop? Wiggins? He was given all the opportunities here, and he is not better in GS now. Culver? He is a bust. Towns ended up being a bad player? I don’t think so. Edwards and McDaniels have shown huge progress this season. Naz Reid is a completely different player after 2 years, and he was undrafted.  Another question - who did Detroit, Magic, Cavs or Rockets really developed over last years? May be Hezonja? Mo Bamba? Aaron Gordon was expected to be a better player, though he is very good. Even Oladipo was not that great there, he became all star in Indiana later. Detroit were consistently selecting mediocre players in lottery - Stanley Johnson, KCP, others. Who they did actually develop so you can say - WOW, this player is really great? Rockets did not have high picks for a while. Cavs got couple in a row and their young players look good, though not good enough (may be yet) to say that the development matters.   You are just biased because Boston really nailed down their top picks with Tatum and Brown as well as their development and roles. However, there is nothing wrong with being drafted by Timberwolves. In addition, our new GM hired a lot of development coaches and all of recent rookies have shown a progress besides Culver."
Because the Pistons drafted him. Sometimes it’s that simple. The Detroit franchise drafted Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell in successive drafts. The Pistons draft the wrong guys. It’s what they do.
Stanley Johnson
No it’s when the legend Stanley Johnson entered the nba. Nothing has been the same since
"Yeah I'm talking specifically if they're sitting out and the current lineups were permanent. Stanley Johnson, Yuta, Boucher, etc"
"I mean, they could also just have them be active and then not play them. What is the league going to do, fine us for the rotations we use? What if Nick doesnt think Fred, Pascal, Kyle, Gary, and OG are good enough to play? The league doesnt say shit when Stanley Johnson doesnt play most nights, even though he's not injured."
"Agreed but we don’t end up with the team we have if we draft Booker.  One of our few draft mistakes I agree but to be fair there were far worse mistakes ahead of us. Stanley Johnson, Kaminsky, Mario Hezonja, mudiay, and calley-Stein were all drafted ahead of Winslow and are all, in my opinion, worse."
I am the white Stanley Johnson
I counter with Aron Baynes and Stanley Johnson.
"Stanley Johnson for Marcus Smart seems fair for both sides, right??? Right???"
"We also have 2Pat for Patrick Patterson.   Don't know why 1Pat never caught on for Patrick McCaw, but my partner and I call him that.  And 0Pat (ZeroPat). That's Stanley Johnson."
"No thanks, we don’t need Stanley Johnson."
"In 2K terms, Stanley Johnson is a 65 OVR player with a 95 defensive rating."
Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson still has time to accomplish this
He came into this league with 0 offensive skillset whatsoever… thats like saying if stanley johnson kept grinding he couldve been lebron
"Ceiling: Paul Pierce. Floor: Andrew Wiggins. Very promising second year improvement, after a rookie year when he looked like another Stanley Johnson."
Stanley Johnson&gt; Ben Simmons
Stanley Johnson&gt; Middleton
Middleton for Stanley Johnson. Who says no.
1. Stanley Johnson  2. Theo Maledon  3. Bismack Biyombo  4. Darius Bazley  5. Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk  6. Aleksej Pokusevski  7. Dwayne Bacon  8. Cole Anthony  9. LeBron James  10. Isaac Okoro
Imagine drafting Stanley Johnson instead of this dude 😎
Imagine drafting Stanley Johnson over this guy
"But Dame is like...5 levels higher as a scorer lol. He's like the same volume, but with a 8% high TS%, which is an absolutely massive difference. 8% is the difference between Steph Curry and Reggie Jackson or Terry Rozier, for example. Or hell it's the same as between Lebron and Anthony Edwards, Lou Dort, and Stanley Johnson lmao  Plus, while Russ is a better playmaker, but Dame gets 8 assists a night and is **extremely** low TO, whereas Russ obviously gets a ton of them. And we can see in this series that he's more than capable of upping that passing volume (10+ assists in 4/5 games so far)"
Coming from someone with “Stanley Johnson” in their name. One of the worst NBA players I’ve ever seen lmao
"“Consistent shooters? Look no further. We’re signing Stanley Johnson, James Ennis, and David Nwaba.” — Rob Pelinka, probably."
no the better question would be replacing stanley johnson with simmons.
He really has a knack for flipping negative-impact players for valuable role players.  He got Hill for Delly/Henson  Miroric for Stanley Johnson (Nikola sucked tho tbh)  PJ for the DJs
Someone on Twitter said Jimmy was just Stanley Johnson with an alarm clock
Stanley Johnson with oppositional defiant disorder.
"It’s not tho. Porzingis was the best option the Knicks honestly could’ve gotten at the 4th pick. The picks after Porzingis were, in order, Mario hezonja, willie cauley stein, Emmanuel mudiay, Stanley johnson, frank kaminsky, and Justise Winslow. Porzingis, despite his problems, is still a significantly better player than all of those players. For it to be a cautionary tale, it has to be a bad pick or something the team regrets. I guarantee you the Knicks do not regret drafting Porzingis over someone like Emmanuel mudiay. Honestly this draft actually disproves your point. Jahlil okafor is the typical “big man” with typical “big man skills” contrary to Porzingis. However, jahlil okafor turned out to be way worse than Porzingis. A better point would honestly be that it’s a cautionary tale to not take typical big man over unicorn big men"
Stanley Motherfucking Johnson dropped 35 this year
stanley johnson with heat culture
"He wasn't a scrub. He played 12 years and averaged 22 mpg. He had a long career because he developed into a plus defender. In the 2006 playoffs, when the 7-seed Lakers took the 2-seed Suns to 7 games, Kwame Brown started all 7 games and averaged 13 and 7.   He was a bust, but there have been bigger busts. Most fans don't realize how many high draft picks don't pan out.   Since 1995, Anthony Bennett, Michael Olowokandi, Andrea Bargnani (very empty numbers), Greg Oden (only played 105 games due to injury), and Markelle Fultz have also been big busts as the #1 pick.   Huge busts drafted in the Top 5 since 1995: Darius Miles, Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Jay Williams, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Darko Milicic, Adam Morrison, Shelden Williams, Michael Beasley, Hasheem Thabeet, Wesley Johnson, Derrick Williams, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Dion Waiters, Thomas Robinson, Jabari Parker, Dante Exum, Jahlil Okafor, Mario Hezonja, Dragan Bender, Kris Dunn   Huge busts drafted in the Top 10 since 1995: Shawn Respert, Ed O'Bannon, Samaki Walker, Adonal Foyle, Robert Traylor, Jonathan Bender, DerMarr Johnson, Joel Pryzbilla, Keyon Dooling, Eddie Griffin, DaSagana Diop, Rodney White, Dajuan Wagner, Mike Sweetney, Jarvis Hayes, Rafael Araujo, Luke Jackson, Ike Diogu, Patrick O'Bryant, Mouhamed Sene, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joe Alexander, Jonny Flynn, Jordan Hill, Ekpe Udoh, Jan Vesely, Jimmer Fredette, Ben McLemore, Trey Burke, Nik Staukus, Noah Vonleh, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Thon Maker, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith Jr.   On average, the #1 pick is a big bust once every 5 years. There is 1 big bust among the Top 5 picks and 3 of the Top 10 picks are big busts on average every year."
Stanley Johnson has had success against Luka
"I'd probably say 2019 right before the playoffs started. We barely snuck in the Playoffs after I felt we would have a much better year. Everyone and their brother new we would get annihilated by the Bucks.      Tired of years of Drummond not playing up to his potential, watching Blake absolutely carry the team and break down physically in the process, not seeing much improvement from Kennard in his second year who was supposed to be our promising young guy while simultaneously seeing the guy we should have drafted (Donovan Mitchell) putting up 24 PPG and leading his team to 50-32. Watching Stanley Johnson continue to suck and not improve on offense.       It really felt like we had a meh roster with no future that would continually be the 8-11 seed forever.      This year, despite being the least number of wins we've had since 1980 was the most hope I've had in a long time. We have a bunch of exciting young guys, an MIP candidate just going into his prime, 11 guys 23 and under, an exciting new GM that has made a ton of good moves and seems to have righted the ship and a shot at a top pick this year."
"All I'm saying is, Stanley Johnson never let Luka put 39 on him with the Raptors."
The Clips need bonafide Luka stopper Stanley Johnson
"They're way better without him. In fact, they should cut to the chase and just send him home right now. Right away. Maybe for a 2nd round pick and Stanley Johnson."
Aron baynes and we might throw in Stanley Johnson... idk yet
"He should get in line with all the other Lebron stoppers like Morris, Stanley Johnson, PJ Tucker and Jae Crowder"
"This is unbelievably ignorant.  The NBA's COVID protocols have changed multiple times this season. These are not static codified rules in the rulebook. The NBA has already demonstrated they're open to change as the country's situation and CDC guidelines change.  So the ""rules"" from January do not apply in May, whether it's for LeBron or Stanley Johnson."
"Following the same criteria (no rookies, no injuries, starter-like minutes), 538 Raptor has:  Lonnie Walker IV -2.3 WAR  P.J. Tucker/ Dwayne Bacon -1.8 WAR  Bismack Biyomobo -1.4 WAR  Stanley Johnson -0.8 WAR"
3 between magic and Stanley Johnson
People losing their shit about us getting into the lottery this year when our highest draft pick on the roster is Stanley Johnson who was only able to attract 3.7 million per year in free agency
"With sub-par defence which didn’t really fit our system. Don’t know specifics but if guys are willing to work hard and show up then they get a chance. All of the rotational players on are team (other than Stanley Johnson) are either late first rounders, second rounders or undrafted.

"Stanley Johnson isn't a rookie with insane work ethic, you can stay in denial idc but end of the story is raptors should have traded Lowry for him"
Denver was bad in the beginning of the season too. I'm assuming the short offseason screwed them up. Raptors need size or draft picks not another guard. Stanley Johnson dropped 35 last week and I don't see him in our future either
Irrationally? Maybe De'Andre Bembry? I think he only signed a one year deal with us. Also Stanley Johnson. He's hard to watch sometimes but he has great games once in a blue moon that are fun to witness.

I think it's cuz we have good one-on-one defenders like OG and Stanley Johnson on Luka and have a decent overall defensive scheme that does well against Luka.
Jalen Harris? Paul Watson? Stanley Johnson? WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
I love the Stanley Johnson Redemption Arc
Hell I was saying Stanley Johnson shouldn’t even be in the league last season. Glad that he’s proven be wrong this year
The Mavs have no future lol  Your boy was feasted on by rookies and Stanley Johnson
"Just some incredible names on that list, but Stanley Johnson stands out. Paul Watson and Jalen Harris probably have outside fans confused too. Now we just need Malachi Flynn and Khem Birch to join the party."
How the hell did Stanley Johnson score 30? Who let that happen
"Bro we're playing 7 dudes including 3 rookies, Stanley Johnson, and the ghost of Aron Baynes, on the second night of a back to back, don't keep your hopes up lol"
Stanley Johnson isn’t 6’9 with a 7’3 wingspan. Barnes is also one of the best passers in this draft.
"Strange, sounds like Stanley Johnson"
Had to go check the draft cause I was surprised Booker wasn't drafted top 10. I can't believe Stanley Johnson was drafted before him!
Stanley fucking Johnson
Stanley Johnson 😭😭😭😭
Lmaooo Stanley Johnson
"God damn, Stanley Johnson…"
Stanley Johnson ☠️☠️
Yes the miraculous turn-around of all-world juggernaut Stanley fucking Johnson is proof that he is the greatest developer of basketball talent that the world has ever known.
"Just give Stanley Johnson one more year, he'll pan out, I swear!"
If anybody can develop him it'll be Jama. He had a hand in turning Stanley Johnson into a serviceable player for us.
Stanley “The 6th Grade” Johnson
Malachi Flynn and Stanley Johnson
"For the record I would've been fine with that Hayward trade - obviously our defense would've tanked but at least we'd be committing to a concrete direction.  I don't know if Rick will run 3-guard lineups but I'm not a fan of either Caris or Brogdon at the 3. They're good size for shooting guards but neither of them strike me as capable defenders against small forwards.  Also I doubt there will be any additional wing defenders like you mentioned - those guys don't come cheap and the cheap ones (i.e. Stanley Johnson or Rondae Hollis Jefferson) are so miserable offensively that you're basically playing 4v5 which is a no-go.  If we do trade either of Turner or Sabonis, we need a defensive-minded stretch 4 back and unfortunately those guys are just as rare. I'm stuck on PJ Washington being that guy (apparently Charlotte offered him and a 1st for Turner and the Pacers FO said no - I'd reconsider)."
"I mean Stanley Johnson captained one of the best high school teams of all time too, that don't mean you'll run the league"
"The best glimmer in that 2016 playoff sweep was when Stanley Johnson was considered a ""LeBron stopper"", mainly by himself. What a time to be alive."
"And Stanley Johnson, there's your point forward"
Think it’s Stanley Johnson
"I don’t think so but I could see why people think that. It’s definitely burned the Pistons both ways (Stanley Johnson, Henry Ellenson, Luke Kennard etc)"
we drafted stanley johnson over him
For the pistons more recent one is what if we took Devin booker over Stanley johnson
stanley johnson is such a fuckin bust man  7th? overal pick  legitimately the worst offensive player in the league when he was on the pistons  just clueless
What if the Pistons pulled the trigger and traded Rip/Tayshaun for Kobe.  What if we took Donovan Mitchell over Luke Kennard.   What if we took Devin Booker over Stanley Johnson.   [Insert 2003 Draft Pick not named LeBron] over Darko Milicic.

Yall can have Stanley Johnson.
The Pistons reportedly were choosing between devin Booker and Stanley Johnson in the 2015 draft at that pick. How things could’ve been quite different and it seems like Booker would’ve wanted to play in Detroit also
Pels starting SF was 6’4” Moore with Stanley Johnson backing him up
"Man, I was so high on Stanley Johnson. I thought he was gonna be like Ron Artest"
Could I get a Toronto Stanley Johnson
Could easily see us replacing Stanley Johnson with him.  We seem to reserve a slot for that kind of risk/reward signing every couple years.
Don’t remind me the Pistons had the chance to draft Pistons fan and Michigander Devin Booker… and went with Stanley Johnson instead
"as a mavs fan, i believe that luka should be traded to the raptors for stanley johnson"
"Not trade for but re-sign. In a stunning reversal from my ""he may just be the worst player in the NBA"" Im actually cool with the Raptors re-signing Stanley Johnson. This past year he played some great defense, and actually started to show some scoring/ball handling ability that wasnt bouncing the ball off his own foot three out of every four plays. I dont think he will ever be a star player (although who knows what the future holds) but I really think he could become a really good 3 and D guy."
"Yeah Giannis totally sucks and they better get rid of him then. In fact, we’ll do the Bucks the favor of throwing in Stanley Johnson and our 4th pick to get him off your hands, only because we’re good guys."
Scottie Barnes either gonna be Kawhi lite or Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson is the next *Jordan*
I remember a ton of people calling jaylen brown Stanley Johnson 2.0
"After the Heat flamed out this year with Jimmy playing like garbage I saw ""Jimmy Butler is just Stanley Johnson with an alarm clock""."
I really thought Stanley Johnson was the next Butler.
"Im not arguing he wasn't gifted. MJ is arguably the most gifted player ever. He's the GOAT for a reason. But there are a lot of NBA players with physical gifts like MJ or KD, but for a myriad of reasons (mental, work ethic, injuries, etc) they aren't nearly as good. Like if you watched MJ and Michael Beasley or even Wiggins in a casual shoot around at the local gym, they'd all look similar in ability. There's a lot of athletic freaks in the NBA.  I used to go to a lot of Drew League games and Stanley Johnson always looked like a more gifted athlete than James Harden"
"Stanley Johnson, one of the best high school players of all time"
The rules apply. Just not to the top 10 players. You think Stanley Johnson is getting 15 seconds for free throws lol
Seeing Stanley Johnson listed in the Raptors young core is a bit odd
Stanley Johnson is a free agent and I would not call him a young core
"2019 Jaxson Hayes, Texas – New Orleans Pelicans   2018 Collin Sexton, Alabama – Cleveland Cavaliers  2017 Frank Ntilikina, France – New York Knicks  2016 Marquese Chriss, Washington – Sacramento Kings  2015 Stanley Johnson, Arizona – Detroit Pistons  2014 Nik Stauskas, Michigan – Sacramento Kings  2013 Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Georgia – Detroit Pistons  2012 Terrence Ross, Washington – Toronto Raptors  2011 Brandon Knight, Kentucky – Detroit Pistons  2010 Al-Farouq Aminu, Wake Forest – L.A. Clippers  The #8 picks have been dreadful for the last decade. You really gotta get lucky to end up in the top 4 and draft someone good. This year was their chance."
We'll throw in Stanley Johnson
That is true. I’ve been on the “dont trade the extremely young athletic wing” train. I really hope he pans out. I think this will be a big year for him either way. He will either break out and be a consistent rotation piece or he will get dumped and fizzle out like Stanley Johnson did.
We have Stanley Johnson at home
"KP didn't want to go to Philly and his agent wasn't going to let it happen. So if they don't take Okafor or Porzingis the next five choices were:  Hezonja  Cauley-Stein  Mudiay  Stanley Johnson  Frank Kaminsky  I was pretty high on Mario, but with 20/20 hindsight none of those would've been GREAT picks either."
"You really need to do some research man...  Noel was picked by New Orleans. Hinkie turned Jrue Holiday into Noel &amp; a future 1st. That future 1st was traded for Saric &amp; another future 1st. Colangelo dumped Noel for nothing when he took over. He's actually still a solid backup center.  You left out MCW who won rookie of the year but was never really a complete player. Hinkie traded him for a 1st somehow too.  Yeah Embiid dropped because of his injury. Obviously if he's healthy he goes #1 or #2. The consensus top 3 were Wiggins, Embiid &amp; Parker. They definitely got lucky to avoid the other 2.  Okafor was a bad pick but probably made because Embiid's injury wasn't healing. The rest of the top 10 in 2015 was pretty bad (Porzingis, Hezonja, Cauley-Stein, Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Kaminsky, Winslow). Booker is the best pick of that draft but nobody was taking him at #3.  Maybe stop with the hot takes and actually do some research next time pal."
Stanley Johnson saying he was in LeBrons head was an all time stupid comment. Dude was a scrub rookie he had no right talking that wild
Stanley Johnson
Could’ve traded for Kyle Lowry but wanted to keep Stanley Johnson with a go pro instead 🤷
Expectation: Magic Johnson  Reality: Stanley Johnson
Stanley johnson for Ben simmons who says no?
76ers will trade Embiid and Curry. They will sign Anthony Bennet and Stanley Johnson.
"Apparently, the Pistons was down to between Stanley Johnson and Devin Booker and it was split 50/50 between the FO and coaching staff. Obviously, they took Stanley but Booker would've been a great fit for the Pistons since he's from Michigan and was born and raised in Grand Rapids.   They also had the opportunity to take Donovan Mitchell over Luke Kennard but chose Kennard over him. That's two potential superstar picks that the Pistons missed out on big time"
"hey y'all aren't the only ones.  Ainge reportedly offered Detroit the same package but they were determined to draft Stanley Johnson instead.  Poor Kemba, I feel awful for him."
"Notable players drafted ahead of Devin Booker in 2015: Jahlil Okafor, Willie Cauley-Stein, Mario Hezonja, Emmanuel Mudiay, Stanley Johnson, Frank Kaminsky, Justise Winslow, Trey Lyles"
Stanley Johnson
They had the second best record in the nba after kawhi left with additions of stanley johnson and rhj
Raptors' top 15 players not in this postseason:  |1|Pascal Siakam| --:|:--| |2|Fred VanVleet| |3|Norman Powell| |4|Kyle Lowry| |5|OG Anunoby| |6|Chris Boucher| |7|Malachi Flynn| |8|Terence Davis| |9|Aron Baynes| |10|DeAndre' Bembry| |11|Freddie Gillespie| |12|Stanley Johnson| |13|Yuta Watanabe| |14|Paul Watson| |15|Matt Thomas|
"Need to take a chance on reclamation projects like Josh Jackson. His shooting is still terrible 4/5 nights, but he defends well. What's Stanley Johnson up to?"
"You had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, Stanley Johnson over Booker, trading Khris Middleton and Dinwiddie, etc, if we draft well we’ll be fine and looking at how we’ve out drafted multiple lottery teams with the 29th pick I think I have hope."
"Not all first round picks are created equal, the average pick outside of the top 5 is rarely going to yield a superstar. If you're getting 18 #1-5 picks, I'd agree with you, but most of those picks are not very good;     2021- #4 position, #16 &amp; #18 (or #5 if the Rockets get insanely unlucky).    2022- Their own first rounder, Clippers 1st rounder (unlikely to be very good), Sunds first rounder (unlikely to be very good).   2023 - Pick swap with Clippers (TBD), Lottery protected heat pick, Lottery protected Nuggets Pick   2024 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2025 - Basically a Clippers pick swap (TBD), 76'ers (top 6 protected)   2026 - Their own pick, Clippers pick (TBD), Rockets (top 4 protected)   2027 - Their own first rounder  Once you look at those protections, you're not going to get 18 guys like Jaylen Brown (#3 overall) or SGA (#11 overall), you're going to get a lot of guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Mario Hezonja, &amp; Emmanuel Mudiay. If you're lucky, you'll get 2-3 like Jaylen or SGA, which is not worth Luka or Zion."
Stanley Johnson. He guarded Lebron fairly well in a playoff series (4-0 sweep but if you watched you know it was more competitive than the average sweep) and he would routinely put up big scoring numbers in OvO league and in 1 year at Arizona. Never developed into and NBA scorer though
"The guy was really good for the Pistons when we first got him, but he was plagued by injuries and could never quite get right after that. However, he still thought he could play like he did when he was healthy and eventually drove most of our fans insane, myself included. He thought he was a first-option kind of guy and he played hero ball and directly led to many of our losses over the last couple of years because his level of confidence did not line up with his level of health.  With all of that said, he was very nice when I met him, and you can tell his passion and excitement for the game is there. His first game after we traded for him, he got so worked up and nervous before the game that he threw up near the team bench.  If he had been consistently healthy the last few years, the Pistons would be a very different team right now and Blake/Andre would both probably still be here. I'm happy to see him finding some success in Los Angeles. The Suns are the #1 team I'd like to see win it all this year but if it's not them, I'd be happy to see the Clippers find a way to get it done. I like Reggie, I love Mook, and of course my guy Chauncey winning another ring as an assistant coach would be dope.  (On a related note, the only thing I truly hated about Reggie Jackson is that after we retired Chauncey's jersey, he didn't change his number the next season. When we retired Ben Wallace's jersey, Stanley Johnson changed his number at the start of the next season from 3 to 7, but Reggie stuck with #1. Ugh.)"
"The reason why I think the Lakers are a good example is because I knew people would look only at Lebron joining.  I'll admit, that was a product of our city and the team's legacy.  But Lebron isn't the product of tanking, AD is.  And its not that AD wanted to join our team, the reason tanking worked is because *we wouldn't have had the assets to trade for AD if we didn't tank*.  That's why tanking is a success story for the Lakers.  Even if you accept everything else about the Lakers drawing power for free agents, we still wouldn't have been able to get AD if we didn't get that #4 pick, or the consecutive years of #2's.  Had we actually tried, we would have been worse off even if Lebron did decide to join us.  As for the Timberwolves, I think you're doing what I said people are doing and making the wrong comparison.  The wrong thing to compare isn't tanking and non-tanking teams.  Ask yourself how good would the Timberwolves be vs. themselves if they didn't suck.  A Timberwolves team that didn't have KAT and had a bunch of middle first round picks.  They couldn't pair that up with Jimmy Butler and go to the playoffs, we've seen them suck for like 10 straight years, there's no reason to think they wouldn't have missed the playoffs for another decade like that.    Same thing with Philly.  Imagine they didn't have Embiid and Simmons and didn't go to the playoffs, but became Kings East.  They could have languished in the #10-15 seed like Detroit has with no future.  Speaking of Detroit, imagine they kept Blake and tried to make the playoffs every year.  We all know he's way past his prime, but could maybe give you a good game once a week.  Instead of Cade, they'd get some random pick in the #11-20 range because they were able to ride Blake and some other vet they traded for to the #9 seed.  And they decided to keep those guys together and try again next year with.  They would be worse off than they'd be sucking for the last few years and getting Cade.  I'll speak on the Lakers again since I know them the most.  In those years, we got guys like D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and a bunch of random players like Robert Sacre, Chris Kaman, Tarik Black, Lou Williams, Josh Hart, David Nwaba, Jordan Clarkson, Marcelo Huertas, Ivica Zubac, Brook Lopez, etc.  Some of these guys are pretty good role players, Brook just showed he isn't dead and helped to win a championship, even played a pivotal role in one of the Finals games.  As pieces, a lot of them can fit into a good team.  Clarkson was just 6th man of the year, Lou Williams has won that a couple of times, Julius Randle just posted a great season and lead the Knicks to the playoffs, D'Angelo Russell has become a more consistent shooter and fun player to watch, Zubac is probably an above average center on a team with championship aspirations.  But is that a championship team?  Can any of those guys realistically even now lead you to a championship?  Remember, without tanking we don't get Brandon Ingram, or Lonzo.  We'd get maybe Thon Maker, or Georgios Papagiannis (the wrong Giannis!), or TJ Leaf, or Frank Ntilikina, or Coby White, Trey Lyles, etc.  Pelicans don't want those guys for AD.  We're not trading Stanley Johnson as the centerpiece in an Anthony Davis trade, we'd be luck to get Ed Davis in a trade!  Yeah, it was pretty brutal to watch for a while, but so what?  The owners are almost all billionaires, I don't shed any tears for them, they'll never be homeless or miss a meal.  Let the arena be empty, let them lose money, this is a long term plan and when you win, the fans will come back, guaranteed.  Or they could mismanage the team for decades and have what the Kings, Wolves, and Magic have right now.  I doubt Philly or the Lakers would trade their team for those players."
"Damn, Stanley Johnson doesn’t even get a mention when he was in the trade package too"
"Darko milicic, Stanley johnson, Henry Ellison, Austin Daye , mateen cleaves"
"It already feels like they have that rep. Guys like RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Alex Len, DeAndre Bembry all signed here to try and turn their careers around.  Even during the Draft interview process, you had Mobley, Suggs and Barnes all speaking highly about the ""Raptors development system""."
"Oh man. I mostly know the football ones but there's plenty in baseball and I imagine basketball too.  Percy Harvin left the Vikings and won a Super Bowl with the Seahawks.  Jerrick McKinnon left the Vikings and went to the Super Bowl with the 49ers (granted he was hurt the whole time. But now he's on the Kansas City Chiefs which are among the favorites to win the Super Bowl this year).  Randy Moss was traded from the Vikings to the Raiders. He was hurt with the Raiders and then went on to the Patriots. Didn't win a ring but that offense was consistently incredible and went 16-0 one year (lost the super bowl though).  Brad Johnson broke his leg on the Vikings. They traded him and he wound up on the Buccaneers and won a Superbowl in 2002 with him as the starter.  Rich Gannon was traded away. He went on the become NFL MVP in 2002 and faced off against another former Viking, Brad Johnson.   Kevin Garnett needs no explanation.  The entire Minneapolis Lakers team. Went on to become the Los Angeles Lakers.  The entire Minnesota North Stars hockey team. Went on to become the Dallas Stars and a few years later (with a decent chunk of the North Stars roster still there) won the Stanley Cup. This one especially hurts because Minnesota is known as ""The State of Hockey"". Our high school and college level hockey scene is a lot like what you see with football in the south. We went without a professional hockey team for and embarrassing amount of time for a place known as ""The State of Hockey"".  There are plenty more as well but those are the big ones that come to mind."
Stanley Johnson is a dangerously impoverished man's OG Anunoby  Yuta Watanabe is Juan Toscano-Anderson but converted to yen
Do y’all remember Stanley Johnson Oakland Soldiers AAU highlights??
In all fairness Stanley Johnson was a highly touted prospect in highschool. I dont know how he trained once he got to the league. But his skills just did not get better. As a pistons fan I was bummed. I thought he could be decent.
I watched Stanley Johnson drop 40 on my travel ball team back in high school lol
&gt;exactly like Stanley Johnson  &gt;freak athlete  There is no way you've ever seen Stanley play lol. Like the absolute biggest criticism of him from the beginning was his complete lack of athleticism
I know. Guys calling kuminga a super star in the making clearly is not old enough to witness the summer league Stanley Johnson
Have you seen Stanley Johnson in the summer league? He was a monster and put up way better stats than kuminga
"A superstar? He looks exactly like Stanley Johnson in his early stage, freak athlete and  lots of potential but also huge bust potential"
Kevin Knox and Stanley Johnson looked great in SL too
you think people would give more of a shit about 3x3 if Matt Thomas or Stanley Johnson was on a team?  lol what?  like I'm sure even some NBA fans don't know who the fuck I just named.
I remember when Stanley Johnson scored 81 somewhere in the off season and we thought he developed a jumper. Little did I know Stanley 'front rim' Johnson would never change
I think Stanley Johnson has a shot for 2
iirc lebron didn't play very well his first summer league game  same with curry and durant  and stanley johnson was god tier
Stanley Johnson..
Stanley Johnson was the best player in summer league his rookie season
Stanley johnson was a monster in summer league more recently Carson Edwards was good in summer league   On the flip side trae young was bad in summer league
"Mate, they took Stanley Johnson ahead of Devin Booker, Henry Ellenson ahead of Caris LeVert and Pascal Siakam and Luke Kennard ahead of Mitchell and Adebayo.   That's three straight where they made picks that were obviously the wrong decision in a row. That's why the problem is scouting."
damm where tf are those 2 now. i was high on Stanley Johnson in the past watching him get buckets in high school lol
How fondly I remember the Stanley Johnson/Justise Winslow wars.
Stanley Johnson was a summer league mvp. You’d think people would learn by now but I guess not.
*Also relevant:*  * *Summer League Stanley Johnson* * *Summer League Austin Daye*   * *Summer League Rashad Vaughn*
Stanley Johnson also won Summer League MVP for what that’s worth.
"We won’t know for another 5 years if the young core is any good. Could go either way, Wiseman/Kuminga are both so raw, I could see them developing into stars or Whitside and Stanley Johnson. Warriors didn’t draft LaMelo or Anthony Edwards."
Stanley Johnson was a world beater in summer league.
"Stanley Johnson was a beast in his first summer league, that should tell you everything you need to know."
Stanley Johnson was summer league mvp.. enough said
I'd still rather have Eric Bledsoe than Stanley Johnson. You couldn't pay me in cap space to take back Johnson.
*Stanley Johnson*
Stanley Johnson
"Josh Hart, JJ Redick, Wes Matthews, Paul Milsap, Rondae Hollis Jefferson, Avery Bradley, Etuan moore, Langston Galloway, Frank Nitilinka, Stanley Johnson, etc.   There’s plenty of bodies still out there and they just need to eat up minutes in the regular season."
Stanley Johnson
"I'm always cautious about prospects that have NBA ready physiques at 17/18, you have to watch very carefully if they're really just dominating their competition on athleticism - for the most part unless you're Zion, that athleticism won't be nearly enough to be great in the NBA without the skills to match. Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow come to mind."
Celtics can take  Dragic and Stanley Johnson from Raps 👀.   Raps will take Horford and a 1st round pick.
"Bro I checked your comment history you were arguing in the draft sub yesterday saying you can’t stand Killian Hayes. You’re a fucking weirdo and you deserve to be insulted when you say shit like that   It was only stupid to you because you hate the Kid. I defended it fine, you did a terrible job of defending your position bringing up Stanley Johnson as if he was a great rookie lmao"
"Apparently Stanley Johnson had an impressive rookie year now, but in the same breath you’re down on Hayes lmao   Okay buddy"
"Stanley Johnson had that and a great floater game, Vaughn looked like a genuine 3 level scorer.    I'm just saying that you shouldnt assume a player's game will translate just because they do well in summerleague"
"Stanley Johnson, Chris Boucher and a 2nd Rd Pick Lol"
"Summerleague means nothing, Stanley Johnson and Rashad Vaughn averaged like 27 ppg in theirs, 1 is a fringe 15th guy and the other has been out of the league for 3 years"
Kuminga 100%. He’s either Paul George or Stanley Johnson
I want Stanley Johnson lowkey
Can we sign and trade him and Stanley Johnson for lauri markkanen?!? Pretty please 🙏
CJ for Stanley Johnson in a sign and trade? Who says no?
"Jalen Harris became the 10th different player on the Raptors to score 30 points in a game last season. He joined: Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Fred VanVleet, Chris Boucher, Kyle Lowry, Gary Trent Jr., OG Anunoby, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson.  5 of those names are likely not returning so we have 5 now."
Kevin Knox and Stanley Johnson looked really good at summer league too
"McConnell looked good at Arizona but got completely overshadowed by Stanley Johnson, Rondae and Caleb Tarczewski.  I thought Caleb would be a solid big man in the NBA for a while too.  Credit to TJ for knowing where he works in the NBA and working like an insane person to stay there."
"For real, the oldest signed players on the squad would be OG who just turned 24 a few weeks ago, and a 25 year old Stanley Johnson.  OG would also be the longest tenured player on the squad, and would most likely have to become the defacto locker room leader."
Stanley Johnson
"Thats ""Future Top 5 Player in the league"" Stanley Johnson to you"
Stanley Johnson
"yeah honestly they should get him for way less money, maybe even do a S&amp;T with another team to try and get an actual defender.  I think a trade with Toronto for Stanley Johnson would be the most fair and balanced."
I remember Pistons fans thinking that when they got Stanley Johnson
"&gt;Favouring the development of Alen Smailigaic, younger versions of Hassan Whiteside and Stanley Johnson instead of trying to contend while Steph is in his prime is malpractice.  Lmfao, people really have no idea what they're talking about."
"Stanley Johnson is still only 24. He’s a great defensive player, has decent handles/passing, and somewhat can shoot corner 3s."
Stanley Johnson showed flashes last season. He clearly can score so he's just gotta stop putting up 0pt games. His defense is already great
"Focousing on the development of Alen Smailigaic, young Hassan Whiteside and Stanley Johnson instead of trying to contend while Steph is in his prime is malpractice."
"Switch Trent for Stanley Johnson, we would have a shot at breaking the lowest score record"
Wouldn't be surprised at all if Masai offers him the annual Stanley Johnson/Rondae Hollis Jefferson/Bembry prove it contract
I mean sure but when they don't fit Sixers.   We also have 2 of them now. And a stanley Johnson at home.
Henry Ellenson and Stanley Johnson. Is some serious bullshit lol
"I didn't love the bit where he said that he's never given basketball his 100% before college (granted due to other sports pursuits). Alongside his poor shooting form (very flat and starts from the chest), I think his potential is probably role player / 6-7th man IF he develops well from here on out.   Right now I get shades of Stanley Johnson - has great physical tools to dominate the college game but he will need to put in the work to fix his shot and develop the BBIQ to succeed at an NBA level.  I think drafting him 5 - 10 is probably about right though, he isn't raw enough to fall to the late first but if you're going to pick up a 6'3 - 6'4 combo guard that might be only be 60-70% NBA ready, there might be good reason to pick a slightly less polished player with a higher upside like Barnes. That said, I expect the decision must've been very close between the two and it's unlikely that the Raptors were 100% on either until they were on the clock to choose."
"Stanley Johnson had good playmaking and defense in college, not as good as Barnes, but he was better offensively"
SVG who took Stanley Johnson over Booker and Kennard over Spider Mitchell. He always got his man.
But he has playmaking and defensive ability so he's more like an Andrei Kirilenko or Boris Diaw than a Stanley Johnson or Josh Jackson.
"Barnes is more of a project player who, given a couple of years, has the potential to develop into an above-average player.  That Stanley Johnson comparison isn’t bad, but hopefully he comes the player that Stanley should have became/developed into."
Stanley Johnson has been in the league for over five years and Josh Jackson is going into his 5th.
"Scottie Barnes will be in the league for 5 years tops.  I actually have no idea but so far the mold of players with his scouting profile (long and athletic with a bad shot) have often not worked out.  Everyone thinks they’re getting Jaylen Brown/Kawhi Leonard, but just as often you get Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson"
And who signed off on the Pistons drafting Stanley Johnson? SVG.
"Barnes strikes me as a player who is offensively raw, and his handle, while impressive considering his stature, isn't readily weaponized in creating/generating his shot.  He reminds me of Stanley Johnson."
Stanley Johnson
"&gt; Another defensive minded wing that needs to develop a shot? We really got a type.  Dream lineup: Fred, OG, Siakam, Stanley Johnson, Barnes. No points will be scored by either team. Who says no?"
"other stars are like kawhi, giannis while busts are stanley johnson and josh jackson"
Top 5 player in the league Stanley Johnson?
"Star: Paul George, Bust: Stanley Johnson  I think Kuminga will end up somewhere in between, maybe Harrison Barnes?"
Stanley Johnson was thicc and girthy tho
Stanley Johnson
"Kuminga. Project wings with no jumpers have historically busted look at MKG,Winslow,Josh Jackson,Stanley Johnson etc."
"CAN CONFIRM. I AM IN FUCKING SHAMBLES, WE JUST DRAFTED STANLEY JOHNSON 2.0"
Stanley Johnson about to play with Stanley Johnson 2.0
"Every year, we pretend that we know for sure which players are going to be good and which aren't. Every year there's guys we think are meaningless who turn out to be really solid. Every year, there's guys we thing are going to be really solid at the top of the draft that *totally* blow.   Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker in 2014 were really underwhelming for their hype. Dante Exum and Nik Stauskas straight up were terrible NBA players. They were the 5th and 8th picks.   But that's just one year, you might say...  2015: Jahlil Okafor, pick 3...had a lot of hype as a potential #1 overall guy a few months before the draft. Total bust. Mario Hezonja, pick 5? Worthless. Mudiay and Stanley Johnson, picks 7 and 8? Total crap.  2016: Dragan Bender and Kris Dunn in the top 5. Marquese Chriss and Thon Maker in the top-10.   2017: Fultz was a bust at 1. Josh Jackson was a bust at 4. Guys 8-11 were all crap.   You give each draft a few years, and you see that there are really good players drafted in the 20s each year, and some crap picked in the top-10."
Stanley Johnson/Josh Jackson vibes to me
"Star: Cade and Mobley. I know, not exactly a blazing take but I really do think both guys can be top players at their respective position, and I think that anybody who has Green over Mobley is going to look really foolish.  Bust: I don’t see Kuminga being all that good. He’s a big wing with B+ athleticism and subpar skills. We’ve seen this movie before with Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson."
"His ceiling is a much better Jaylen Brown, with much better playmaking. Floor is like Stanley Johnson"
The same agent who hyped up Stanley Johnson.
"Weird story actually, Stanley Johnson literally took my phone out of my hands cuz I was trying to sneak a pic at 5th Ave like 20 feet away, but I think that was because he was underage at the time, I didn't have a chance to take a pic because I was a couple drinks in and fumbling with my phone. He took my phone and said if he finds a pic of him on it he's gonna chuck my phone to the other side of the street, if he doesn't he'll give me $100 and pulled out like $10K wadded in a rubber band. Was legit a Steve Blake-esque story.    Also Reggie Bullock is super chill, was just playing pool upstairs at 5th ave lol."
Scottie Barnes will be Stanley Johnson 2.0
"Lowry can guard Harden or Irving, Simmons and Harris for Durant/the other guard. You are losing a single defender. Shit, we could have sent like Stanley Johnson or Bembry back if you really needed an extra wing defender. You could have made a deal for one instead of George Hill. I just don’t buy that reasoning, but I guess I understand where it’s coming from."
Top 5 in the NBA Stanley Johnson?
"Pistons?  Darko, Stanley Johnson, Kennard, Daye"
"That's more unrealistic than tweeting Stanley Johnson ""win MVP"""
"According to bbref there were 513 active contracts in the NBA last year and the person at half+1 is Stanley Johnson who pulled down 3.8 million and has made 16+ million over his very short career.  Just a totally different negotiation position and also is illustrative of why strong unions are important, because leverage begets more leverage with every passing good CBA.  There is a good argument to be made that being a mid tier NBA player is the best gig in all sport when it comes to financial security vs expectations/spotlight"
"Obi Toppin, Jaxson Hayes, Collin Sexton, Frank Ntilikina, Marquese Chriss, Stanley Johnson, Nik Stauskas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Terrence Ross, Brandon Knight...  Yeah, out of the last 10 Sexton is almost the only one who's turned into a really good player. Ross and KCP are tidy, but nothing special."
"it's like we started jalen harris, paul watson and stanley johnson"
Stanley Johnson is that you?
Except Stanley “in Lebrons head” johnson but yea for real 2016 Lebron was impossible to defend  You’re just hoping he misses midrange shots
"You dense dog? We didnt draft Stanley Johnson ""never letting that shit slide"" LOL"
Stanley Johnson has been listed at around 240 since he entered the league too. I thought he was gonna be the new Ron Artest.
"I really don’t, but thanks for proving my point, that you don’t know what you’re talking about  Yo you know what, I just remembered AD is from Chicago. So with Lebron from Klutch and AD from Chicago it’s basically a done deal they’re coming here right?!?😳😳  They’re under contract so we obviously we have to trade for them. DJJ, Stanley Johnson, and a second would be good enough right? Actually maybe not the second, that might be too much  Regardless, Klutch always gets their guy💯💯. #BronADToTheBulls👀👀"
"I'm pretty sure this season was an outlier for him, he got covid pretty bad halfway through the season and it took him a while to return to form. He also had to take a ton of bad shots due to our bench players' unwillingness to shoot (cough Stanley Johnson cough). However it's definitely something he's gotta work on, I'm not gonna deny that"
"And we wouldn’t have Cade if we didn’t draft Stanley Johnson lmaooo  Homie I just don’t think picking Giddey over Kuminga, or trading away Sengun for lotto protected firsts, were good moves by OKC and their recent draft history doesnt instil confidence in me. I could def be wrong"
Stanley johnson
Legend has it Stanley Johnson is still in LeBron's head
"People said this about Stanley Johnson lol  Like he's not even really a good defender, hustles and moves his feet on ball but fouls a lot and misreads a lot of situations"
"True, that was a famously competetive first-round sweep in 2016. I think having to go through Stanley Johnson made Bron who he is today."
Still remember when Stanley Johnson was the Kawhi stopper on the Pistons lol
So like a smaller Stanley Johnson

"When you’re under contract you don’t have the choice of looking for another job.  Idk why you seem to think this is some uncharacteristic and inexcusable situation. Your job involves you being in the public eye. If you do your job poorly your boss is gonna criticize you. That’s what happened to Ben. For four years we’ve been talking about the major holes in his game and how they hinder his team especially in the playoffs, and moves have been made to compliment bens game, going as far as to get Embiid, the best post scorer since Shaq, to take like 8 jumpers per game to space the floor more for Ben. Despite all that he hasn’t improved even a little bit on those weaknesses. He deserved to get publicly criticized.   And it’s not even like they were saying he was trash. Embiid said the momentum changed after a horrible Ben play that he completely sugarcoated, but then said it led to some empty possessions by him and took all the blame. Embiid who 80% of the time played like an mvp took the blame over a dude that took 3 shots in the last 3 second half’s. Doc just said he didn’t know if he was a championship point guard. What else is he supposed to do? Lie after what everybody saw ? Saying idk is the most neutral answer.  And PROFFESIONALS take stuff like this as motivation and fuel to work harder. They don’t get pissy and ghost their teams. Phil Jackson used to talk to the press about shitty performances by Kobe and MJ and pippen and everyone on the team when they underperformed or cost them games. Popovich does the same. Nick Nurse has done the same with guys like Siakam and role players like Stanley Johnson. Doc did similar things in LAC talking about PG. trades or trade demands or trade talks or ghosting the team didn’t happen in any of these situations. Cause these players had small enough egos to accept the criticism and use it to work harder and improve their games. But not Ben, cause whether his ego is too big or he just can’t be bothered to work on his weaknesses at all, he’s too good for that. If he’s offended he deserves a change of scenery. Pathetic shit."
"Stanley Johnson:  “Play against LeBron [James] — that means something,” Johnson said flatly. “He is the best player in the league and I want to be the best player in the league too, so I have a target on him. I will keep reaching for that goal. … He is a team player so I have to be a better team player to be on the same level as him. Did you see that Game 6 against Chicago where he had like 14 points and 14 assists and controlled everything? The best players win a lot of games, so it is not about your points or your rebounds.”  [Source](https://www.slamonline.com/archives/stanley-johnson-on-lebron-james-i-have-a-target-on-him/)"
"Solomon hill, josh Richardson, Stanley Johnson, Isaac okoro. Can list more. What’s so special about hardens build ? He’s strong but there are plenty of strong two guards. He’s not a fantastic leaper. He’s not super fast."
Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson 🤦‍♂️
Nah don’t worry bro I thought Justise Winslow was the next Dwayne Wade and Stanley Johnson the next Kawhi. It was a weird draft lol
"Boy I thought Jabari Parker was gonna be the next Melo. But more athletic he had bunnies, it sucks he had the 2 ACL tears… I also thought Thought Stanley Johnson was gonna be a defensive stopper that averaged 20ppg. He came out of college with an NBA Body dude was massive as a rookie"
"He literally had 35, 10, &amp; 5.  I’d call that being “lit up”, especially for a player like Stanley Johnson."
Stanley Johnson hasn't lit anyone up
And Stanley Johnson
"A) progress isn’t linear. There are things you and I are better at than our grandparents but there’s a shit ton they could do we’d have no clue where to start.  B) there’s tons in f dudes who can’t dribble with their off hand. Hell, khris Middleton can barely dribble with either hand but that doesn’t stop him from being a deadly shooter. Nobody in the league these days can play in the post like they did 20 years ago. Hell, other than distance shooting where has all this extra skill manifested itself? They’ve changed so many rules to make it easier to score. Guys didn’t all suddenly become so much more skilled, scoring became easier.  It’s a stupid argument. Jordan, shaq, Robinson, zeke, chuck, magic, Larry legend shiiiiiit the assist record is still held by Scott skiles, nobody handles like white chocolate and cwebb changed the game with his passing. Those are easy because they were stars sure but if you’re saying average guys now (like say Kyle Kuzma) are better than average guys then because of skill I’ll tell you straight up Chris child’s would bust his ass harder than he busted Kobe’s chops. You really telling me Stanley Johnson is more skilled? Cmon now.  It’s a dumb argument."
Stanley Johnson
"Wait. I just realized we have enough Johnson in the league for a starting 5  Tyler Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Keldon Johnson, Alize Johnson, James Johnson  At long last! We have 5!"
lmaooo yall signed Stanley Johnson? Is that just for an extra body for Derozan and Lavine to dunk on in practice?
"We signed Alize Johnson and Stanley Johnson yesterday, bringing the guaranteed contracts to 15. We also have Matt Thomas on a non-guaranteed training camp deal. There's no more spots."
"Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas and Alize Johnson would be a superstar"
"Nick Nurse is pretty brutally honest to the media when he isn't happy with a player's play.  Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson, Siakam, FVV, Powell are all players who responded positively with good performances following public criticisms from Nurse.  The difference I see between Nurse and Doc in their situations is you can understand the underlying tough love messaging in what Nurse says about his players.  For Doc to stutter ""... I don't know."" when asked if Ben can be the star of a contender was a damning insight to how he truly feels about Ben.   He must have reached the point where he realized Ben just didn't have the mentality and work ethic to get Philly to where it needs to be."
Nurse ripped Rondae and Stanley Johnson at the start of last season https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dj22ip/lewenberg_nick_nurse_on_stanley_johnson_and/ https://twitter.com/jlew1050/status/1184529998205673475?s=21  Rondae went on to be a quality role player for the rest of the year. Stanley was awful that year but was ok this year   Not really core guys and this was when they just signed there
&gt;Vertical  &gt;Cassius Stanley  I'm taking Keon Johnson   &gt;3PT  &gt;Klay  I'm definitely taking Steph over Klay
"DeRozan, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Matt Thomas. All these former Raps is this a coincidence lmao."
"He is actually good for you guys. Ball, Lavine, demar, coby, Vuc, Caruso, Patrick Williams, DJJ, Arcidiacono, Stanley Johnson etc   That’s a pretty damn good team, Bulls will be fun next year. Probably not better than the bucks-Nets-sixers but they will be like the 4-6th seed"
Stanley Johnson AND Alize Johnson?  The Bulls are smart. They're getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson so they can't get COVID.
"Demar, Stanley Johnson, Matt Thomas...next up Chicago extends 2 year offer to Aron Baynes"
"Good (streaky) shooter, bad defender.   If you guys can find a way to fuse him and Stanley Johnson together, you’ll be set."
stanley johnson connection
If they can find a way to successfully merge Matt Thomas and Stanley Johnson they’ve really got something…
"Fuck these super teams, Stanley Johnson for free smh"
Stanley “bitchass” Johnson
That has to be Stanley Johnson!s account.
and Stanley Johnson.
"They'll take Stanley Johnson, Chris Boucher, 2 2nds and they're gonna *like* it"
"No, he just sucks. You would’ve said the same thing about Stanley Johnson. When Andre Drummond has more drive and a more polished offensive game than you, your NBA career in shambles."
Stanley…..Johnson….
"Stanley Johnson 35 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals. Not so much for the statline itself but for who got it."
"&gt; Also Herro was in the trade talks  Yeah, I'm sure he was.  We just thought it was ridiculous that some fans thought Herro should be considered untouchable for Harden.  I mean, ultimately, it's not that bad, every team overrates their young players.  I've seen fans call the likes of RHJ, Stanley Johnson, Gary Harris, future stars.  Plenty of people on my team's sub think Mitchell Robinson will be Rudy Gobert that is also a 3pt marksman.  Every fanbase is guilty of this."
it’s not like stanley johnson was a huge success either. no one here can possibly know what’s going on behind the scenes or how frank would fare on other teams.
"I remember being so high on Stanley Johnson, he was so good at Arizona"
"First Alize Johnson, now Stanley Johnson. Nets are just collecting defense specialist that Raptors cut."
Stanley Johnson gonna make Brooklyn a real super team
Stanley Johnson is the best Lebron defender.  [Pistons’ Stanley Johnson on LeBron: ‘I’m definitely in his head’](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/04/21/stanley-johnson-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-detroit-pistons-game-2)
"Stanley Johnson. I still believe, damnit!!"
The Stanley Johnson disrespect smh
"Well... I'm a Raptors fan and Pistons fan.   With regard to the Raptors, I'd have to say there haven't really been 'dark days.'  Nothing like what the Kings are going through of the Clippers have gone through, or even the Warriors.   At first, it was exciting just to get a team. We got the ROY our first year. We got some great and entertaining talent early on (McGrady, Camby, and Carter).  Had some playoff runs with Carter, he left in the worst way possible, but we picked up Chris Bosh shortly there after.   Had some more playoff appearances. Lost Bosh, and then started toward building what eventually led to a championship.   The Pistons are likely in their darkest days since the 70s.   We build a contender through the 80s, getting deeper and deeper in the playoffs each year before winning back-to-back.   Had a rebuild that started out well. First got to watch Rodman tear it up with rebounds, lost him in a trade, then drafted Allan Houston. Lost him but got Grant Hill, who was on his way to becoming the best all-around player in the league.   Lost him, but got Big Ben in return.   Got to watch amazing rebounding and defensive performances, and the pieces slowly came together. Tore up the league, beat the Lakers (AGAIN) to win a title back-to-back finals, then eventually traded Billups and everything went down hill.   And since then, it has been almost 15 years since we won a playoff series.   Sure... we've had some entertaining talent along the way. A year of Blake. Some nice rebounding seasons out of Drummond. A sweet old school post player in Monroe. But horrible signings that looked promising (even if questionable) that didn't pan out (Josh Smith) and a bad trade that was the result of mandates from new management (Jennings).   And the draft? We passed up on Klay for Brandon Knight? FUCK!!! I was pissed THAT NIGHT!! And have grown more pissed since, watching what Klay turned into.   We got Greg Monroe, who looked great, but we passed up on Hayward and Paul George in the process.   Then we got KCP over McCollum.   Stanley Johnson? Over Booker, Oubre, and Myles Turner? I mean... it was like shooting fish in a barrel that draft, and we still missed.   Got Luke Kennard ONE PICK before Donavan Mitchell and a few ahead of John Collins.   The team has just drafted SO poorly over the last 15 years."
" Precious Achiuwa, OG Anunoby, Dalano Banton, Scottie Barnes Khem Birch, Isaac Bonga, Chris Boucher, Sam Dekker, Goran Dragic, Malachi Flynn, Freddie Gillespie, David Johnson, Stanley Johnson, Pascal Siakam, Gary Trent Jr., Fred VanVleetand Yuta Watanabe plus 2 frp for Simmons straight up... who says no?"
"Considering every time I respond to one of these I say someone like Mudiay or Stanley Johnson, I’m just going to sit this one out."
"well hopefully, he ends up more like RHJ (who Masai didn't give a PO to but should have) or Bembry in terms of usefulness than Stanley Johnson (who Masai did give a PO to but shouldn't have)."
"Stanley Johnson is a UFA, Cali hs legend and he plays defence js."
"Jonathan Kuminga will be about as good as Stanley Johnson has been.   The Boston Celtics form the next dynasty as they acquire a disgruntled KAT or Lillard. Tatum is on a superstar trajectory and Brown is right there with him. Both guys will be so insanely good and are playing the statistically rarest and most valuable positions in the league.   Sure they might have a few more disappointments in the playoffs, but like Lowry, or more aptly- Giannis players tend to shake that off and just have a godly postseason or two."
Raptors Sixers battle of the benches last summer.  It was a seeding game that wasn’t going to change either team’s standing so it was literally just bench players the whole second half  Embiid and Harris jumping and pointing at the Raptors starters. Raptors starters dancing back. Sending a double to Stanley Johnson at halfcourt. Stanley Johnson gamewinner
"Okoro reminds me of Stanley Johnson. Athletic, strong perimeter defender that can’t do anything else"
Fr has that person seen Stanley Johnson in the pick and roll?
"That was at the start of 17-18. Though there were discussions before-hand, Pelicans finished the trade for him after Boogie tore his Achilles. Gave up Omer Asik, Tony Allen, Jameer Nelson, and a protected first to save 17-18. Then in the middle of the AD drama the next season, Demps flipped him to Milwaukee for Stanley Johnson, Jason Smith, and 4 seconds."
"Demarre Carroll wasn't a good move in hindsight.  Neither was Jared Sullinger.  Giving Stanley Johnson a player option.  But those were very, very minor setbacks in comparison to all the right moves he's made thus far.  He certainly hasn't missed much."
"Generally speaking its usually the player more than the player development too. Weve had a lot of high upside players not imorovs much, but for the ones who did, they all had one thing in common, high work ethic. Thats a difference between scottie fvv pascal og and players like stanley johnson, rondae, cam payne (until he got to china and switched his mentality) etc"
Remember when the Raptors lost Kawhi and snap signed Stanley Johnson
"Man that interview he did earlier this year was pretty telling why he became a bust.   &gt;”I don’t wanna show I can do more,” Johnson said.  &gt;“I’m a professional athlete, I play for money,”   https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/raptors-stanley-johnson-writing-new-career-chapter-grappling-doubts/"
Stanley Johnson is not on an NBA team? That is surprising.
"I mean I wouldn't have them at their pre 2021 form either but this subreddit is underrating them quite a bit. 32 wins is an insanely low total. We aren't tanking this year, the team is definitely trying to make the playoffs. Nurse has never been one to just throw out young players over the established guys if anything that's been one of his faults, FVV played lots of minutes last year, even Lowry played 35 mpg. Outside of the late season tanks he rarely throws the young guys to the wolves. People keep calling us a rebuilding team which I guess is kinda accurate but I think people have this idea that we won't be trying to win next year which is nowhere close to the case. Scottie completely shut down Beal in that game against Washington and I think got better every game on that end. He's someone that I think especially on defense is just gonna get better and better every game. We were running guys like Stanley Johnson, Aron Baynes, Deandre Bembry for a lot of last season, we had probably the worst C group in the NBA to the point that even someone as mediocre as Khem Birch made the team look so much better.   Obviously I could end up being wrong but I would be very surprised if we weren't a top 10 defense this year and win at least 40 games."
"https://www.si.com/nba/2016/04/21/stanley-johnson-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-detroit-pistons-game-2  &gt; “I’m definitely in his head,’ Johnson said, according to ESPN's Nick Friedell. “That’s for sure.” Johnson, who has spent time guarding James the first two games of the series and received a shoulder bump from LeBron early in Wednesday’s game, went on to add more bold commentary about the No. 1-seeded Cavs, who lead the first-round series 2–0.  &gt; “I wish he would just talk when [the game] is 0–0, not when he’s up 16 [points],” Johnson said, according toFriedell.  “He jabbers. He moves his mouth sometimes. Their whole team does, kind of like they’re little cheerleaders on the bench.”   The comments are so ridiculous that I rooted for him just because of his (over)confidence."
"Did you see what your coaches developed Greg Monroe into? How about Austin Daye? Stanley Johnson? Henry Ellenson? Sekou? How many high potential guys have to flop before you can admit that maybe Detroit was the problem?   Drummond was your only self grown all-star since Mehmet Okur, who was let's be honest even more fringe. Even your few good draft picks, Dinwiddie, Middleton, KCP, they have all only flourished since escaping your coaching and your system. I'd say the same of Bruce Brown from the little we've seen of him in NY.   Hopefully things are on the right path, and yall don't waste Beef Stew, Cade, and Killian's potential the way I worry you may."
Damn what happened to this guy. His draft class thought he was even most likely ROY back then… https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2015/8/19/9176849/stanley-johnson-draft-class-loves-him-nba-draft-results-2015
I thought Stanley Johnson was going to be a Damm good player
"[That's too bad, Stanley Johnson really needs the money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0HX4a5P8eE)"
But the Bulls are undefeated since signing Stanley Johnson
Jjj shot the lights out. Griz c team was rough to watch.   Stanley Johnson and Matt Thomas for the recent raptors connect
Best: Oladipo easily going 1 to Cleveland.  Thought he would be 90% as good as PG.  Worst: Stanley Johnson.  Thought he was built like Kawhi and had a decent shot so at worst he would be an above average player and the potential to be a top 15 player.
"Yea. Stanley Johnson fooled me too, bro."
"i was high on luka, didn’t think he was far and away number 1 but was making the harden comp well in advance of the draft, and i thought haliburton was a steal. however i was also super high on stanley johnson and justise winslow and thought ant edwards and lamelo would bust"
Best = Jaylen brown or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander   Worst = Stanley Johnson
"Lmao this is so incorrect I don’t even know where to begin.  The funniest part was when you called Evan Fournier, Mitchell Robinson, and Derrick Rose “role players” like they are Bobby Portis or Stanley Johnson."
Upside? Stanley Johnson?
"I think you're being a little generous with your prediction. I don't think he plays near enough to even be close to all-rookie 2nd team. When Siakam, Boucher, and Yuta come back there's basically no minutes for him. He might get the Stanley Johnson type role and play 10 minutes one game and then dnp the next in my opinion."
Stanley Johnson and Rashad Vaughn were summerleague/preseason beasts. They both averaged over 23ppg.    Johnson is now a fringe 15th guy and Vaughn has been out of the league for like 5 years.
"That's true, OG is one of the best defenders in the league.  My point was that the Bulls have recruited a ton of good defenders. Even if they aren't as good as OG (and very few players in the world are) guys like Caruso, Lonzo, Troy Brown, Javonte Green, Derrick Jones, Tony Bradley, Stanley Johnson, Alize Johnson, Pat Williams - up and down the roster Chicago is filled with lengthy, athletic wing defenders who can help offset the deficiencies of LaVine and DeRozan.  Toronto went the other way by finding solid two way players."
"Both Collins had a ton of hype, felt like Zach had more hype than Stanley Johnson when we then picked Winslow."
No one hated Stanley Johnson more than raps fans. Felt bad for the guy.   Boucher is wild - he’s just hurt.
"Stanley Johnson is my guess. Btw, what a disappointing pick. Dude was the 8th pick and is not far from out of the league at this point."
"&gt;Malachi ""Jason Kidd"" something  Lmao this one is just hilarious, I don't recall hearing this one...  Btw the stanley johnson one was a meme."
"Whats going on with Stanley ""Next Kawhi"" Johnson, Chris ""KP"" Boucher, Malachi ""Jason Kidd"" something"
Harden  Jordan Clarkson  Stanley Johnson  Carmelo   Kyrie
our bench was also pretty trashy last year with guys like stanley johnson so we improve a lot on that front. Saying precious is trash is... I don't know ...
"I hope he makes the roster, it’ll be tough for him because he’s going up against Stanley Johnson for a spot and Johnson provides more defense which is really what we need, but I love Thomas and his shot is so smooth"
"He might fuck around and make it to. I think we have two roster spots left. One for sure is going to Alize Johnson, he’s been rock solid. Thomas hasn’t shot amazing but he isn’t scared to shoot and can get his shot up quicker than anyone else on the bench, defense isn’t his strong suit though. If Coby was healthy he’d be useless but we might could use his shooting. Ironically It’ll probably be between him and Stanley Johnson."
Hey Piston bro why u still got Stanley Johnson as ya flair
when he's clearly the best rookie halfway through the regular season lol  you seem like a casual. stanley johnson was CLEARLY the best player during his summer league and was a beast in preseason.   i could see you making this same post for him before the regular season even started.
hasn't even played a single regular season game yet  i remember stanley johnson was a stud during summer league/preseason
Pacers draft well? Let's take a look....  2020 - Cassius Stanley  2019 - Goga Bitadze  2018 - Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson  2017 - TJ Leaf and Ike Anigbogu  2016 - Georges Niang  2015 - Myles Turner and Joe Young  2014 - Nobody  2013 - Solomon Hill  2012 - Miles Plumlee  2011 - Nobody  10 years worth of draft picks and Myles Turner is the only one who has made any significant noise for the Pacers.
That 3 from the logo and the bow while the Garden tried to thank the team for the season was the most disrespectful thing since Harden ended Stanley Johnson.
"Kawhi is a once in a generation talent, you dont just find one.  Think of all the misses of so called ""Next Kawhi""  Stanley Johnson, Josh Jackson, and more.  We might not ever see another Kawhi type player"
Man I still remember when Stanley Johnson looked like an absolute stud in the preseason
Is it weird that I remember Stanley Johnson in a Raptors jersey so vividly? He must've smoked the Bulls once or something.
Warriors got their Stanley Johnson
"I love that your reasoning is Celtics &gt; Bulls because of scoring and efficiency, but LaVine is the best scorer and by far the most efficient player on either roster.   You say the Bulls will have a bad defense because they lost Thad Young. But the fact is that Chicago had the 7th best defense after the Vucevic trade, Donovan is a terrific defensive coach, and they replaced Thad with strong defensive players in Caruso, Lonzo, Stanley Johnson, Derrick Jones Jr., and Tony Bradley."
"Hey man, he joins other greats that averaged 20 ppg in preseason like... Rashad Vaughn and Stanley Johnson."
"LaVine and Vuc aren't great defenders, but neither of them are bad at defense. DeMar is obviously not a good defender but let's not fail to mention that we have Lonzo Ball and Patrick Williams in the starting lineup and off the bench we have Caruso, Tony Bradley, Troy Brown Jr., DJJ, Stanley Johnson, etc. the entire bench was pretty much molded with athleticism and defense being the two highest priorities.   12th in the league defensively last year, 8th in the league after trading for Vuc, and despite losing thad i don't think that's enough for us to even be in the bottom half defensively this year and looking at our roster we clearly have guys who are capable of playing good defense."
Stanley Johnson. i have never seen an episode of Squid Game
Underachieving wings and shit talking Ben Simmons must be a thing  Anyone got a Stanley Johnson clip?
"Rui was a garbage defender in college and is one of the worst in the NBA right now, he’s as much a candidate for the “Kawhi Jump” as Stanley Johnson is"
Serge to Chicago  * 2017-2018 Raptors with DeMar  * 2019-2020 Raptors with Stanley Johnson and Matt Thomas  * 2016-2017 Magic with Vucevic  DJJ to the Clippers  * 2016-2017 Suns with Bledsoe  * 2018-2019 Clippers with Justise Winslow  * 2020-2021 Blazers with Harry Giles
Damian Lillard would have been Nik Stauskas and Kawhi Leonard would have been Stanley Johnson if they went to the King
"I’ve got a pretty random list. Off the top of my head:  Felicio, Vonleh, TJ warren, Mitch McGary, Jakarr Sampson, Semaj Christian, Wiggins, Stanley Johnson, Olynyk, Sabonis, Gabe Vincent, Tyler Johnson, Robert Swift  Between college ball, prep school, and the aau circuit I’m sure I’m missing more"
A Pistons fan just DM'd me and said the exact same thing.  He said Drummond invited Stanley Johnson to live with him and he said no.😂🤣  He seems to have a hard time being cool.
2011 - fareid to mirotic  2012 - Evan Fournier to sullinger  2013 - Rudy Gobert to livio jean charles  2014 doug McDermott to Dario saric  2015 - mudiay to Stanley Johnson
"Stanley Johnson is definitely better, not that that says much but he is better."
Stanley Johnson is even worse just to give you a heads up
Stanley Johnson. Dudes game looked so nice in high school and college
"James. They’re both godly iso scorers but James is the better defender when he wants to be, even though Luka is deceptively strong. There’s a video out there of James doing 1v1 with Stanley Johnson and someone else and man, he made every bucket. Man is an assassin."
"&gt; Compared to how many times a normal coaches would shit on their players: 0  Nick Nurse had a pretty public spat with Siakam last season where he said he benched him in the 4th quarter because he wasn't putting in effort on defense. Before the 2020 season, he said that RHJ and Stanley Johnson needed to stop chucking like they do in practice show more team play, or they weren't gonna get minutes.  I'm blown away by people taking Simmons' side here. I've never seen a player this spoiled, and it's crazy to me that his behavior has defenders."
Stanley Johnson does this for quite literally 1/15th of the cost of simmons.
"Cash considerations, or throw in Bazemore so we can get a late 2nd round pick.   Then sign a wing from free agency like Glenn Robinson III or James Ennis. Heck I'd call up Stanley Johnson"
My team started Stanley Johnson for 13 games last season once COVID hit.  Y'all are babies.
Two raw to tell. He can be anything between Stanley Johnson and lebron James
really fuckin wish Stanley Johnson panned out. that dude could clamp
"It’s only a matter of time before Bradley, bazemore, and DJ get cut for players like ennis, Stanley Johnson, or Wes Matthews"
"Stanley Johnson   In all seriousness I’d go with Patrick Williams, sucks he’s out for the year"
"I guess you’re right. ROTY Michael Carter Williams was super fun to watch his rookie year, so was athletic point guard Emanuel Mudiay, so was herky jerky triple double threat Elfrid Payton, so was low post savant Jahlil Okafor, so were Josh Richardson and Justise Winslow.. so was Stanley “the next Kawhi” Johnson  Rookie Andre Drummond was Uber athletic, boxing out people, grabbing rebounds, flashing handles and defensive plays here and there.. fun stuff"
"Meanwhile the Pacers (before this year) have drafted:  Cassius Stanley (cut after 1 year)  Goga Bitadze (a Center, when we already are starting 2 Centers, barely plays)  Aaron Holiday (traded him after 3 mediocre years for a pick upgrade to get Isaiah Jackson)  Alize Johnson (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Houston)  TJ Leaf (absolute trash)  Ike Anigbogu (barely played, cut after 2 years)  Georges Niang (barely played, cut after 2 years, now at Philly)  Caris LeVert (pretty good pick, but we traded him)  Myles Turner (hey, we got one right)  Joe Young (barely played, cut after 3 years)  Solomon Hill (left after 3 years, was ok)  Miles Plumlee (played 14 games here)  Kawhi Leonard (awesome pick, so obviously we traded him draft night)  Davis Bertans (another good pick we traded draft night)"
The only one who can stop Stanley Johnson is Stanley Johnson!
Stanley Johnson
Did the Bulls sign Stanley Johnson?
"BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH STOP DICKRIDING THIS EARLY FOR A FUCKIN ROOKIE, that doesnt even play on your team. edit: I seen the comments below, I would've understood if you had a Raptors flair this comment wouldn't surprised me. They thought Stanley Johnson is the next Kawhi, and Flynn the next curry after two preseason games"
"We were starting Malachi Flynn, Jalen Harris, Stanley Johnson and Paul Watson Jr  didn’t really miss them if we weren’t trying to make them"
"Look up Nick Nurse talking about Chris Boucher, Stanley Johnson and Rondae Hollis Jefferson in the past. That's called throwing a player under the bus.  Answer ""idk"" to a question about Ben's play is not throwing him under the bus. Joel telling the reporter about everything that happend in the last 2 minutes of the game is not throwing Ben under the bus.  Nobody alienated him, Doc &amp; Joel literally said they can't wait to get back into the gym with Ben in the same interview. Ben alienated himself because he didn't want to play.   If Ben actually had mental issues, why not bring it up then? Why not bring it up when he was bricking FTs in the playoffs? Why only when the Sixers started docking his pay? It makes zero sense. If I'm Daryl Morey I'm calling his bluff lmao, sit for 4 years if you want."
"The scottie barnes shooting 22% from three? That scottie barnes? His middy has been falling, but i wouldn't say he can shoot yet lol  Scottie's good even tho he can't shoot tho, other guys like Josh Jackson, Stanley Johnson... not so much. I'd say guys like OG and siakam are better examples from the raps alone, even tho siakam isn't a wing"
Give the kid a chance. We haven’t seen enough for Bust talk yet. But wow Jalen Green is already amazing. The Pistons always pick the wrong guy. Detroit took Stanley Johnson and Luke Kennard over Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell.
"Trading Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson. Haven’t won a playoff game since..  Another terrible one was taking Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell, when Mitchell didn’t miss a single shot in his workout. Or taking Stanley Johnson over Devin Booker, a Pistons fan 🤦🏾‍♂️"
will forever remember him as the dude who lost to Stanley Johnson in California state finals
"And they just cut Stanley Johnson 13 days ago. He's a great defender 1 through 4, maybe call him back."
Lmao only reason this tournament doesn’t have NBA players is because it’s unknown  If Stanley Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr teamed up they could probably beat most of these teams 2v3
It's a meta joke referring to a thread that resurfaced where Stanley Johnson was predicted to be a top 5 player in 5 years (in 2016)
i’d rather take cade and regret it later than see him be good somewhere else.  please. i’ve watched us fumble pick after pick. we coulda had giannis one year but he was such a project and from another country im not going to include him.  recently   2013 we took kcp and coulda had CJ Mccollum  2014 no pick  2015 stanley johnson over myles turner and booker  2016 ellenson. coulda had lavert but this is outside the lottery so im not trippin  2017 this is the one that makes me want to blow my brains out. luke fucking kennard over donovan mitchell. (also coulda got bam)  2018 no pick  2019 dekou he’s a bust but was outside the lottery and no other pick was really worthwhile after besides thybulle and kpj.  please for the love of god just take cade.
"It's a joke obviously, there's no comparison.  Stanley Johnson is leagues better"
Are you suggesting it was raps fans saying that about stanley johnson?
I remember that top 5 thread from 5 years ago predicting that Stanley Johnson would be a top 5 player and I’m never letting that shit slide
Why trade for Ben Simmons when we already have Stanley Johnson?
"Um, I guess well offer you Stanley Johnson??"
"Yeah. Funny enough, if Kuminga doesn’t pan out, he’s going to end up like Stanley Johnson."
I've never even heard of Stanley Johnson.
"Stanley Johnson? Andrew Wiggins? Kawhi's overrated? This is hilarious lol  Also in the comments, someone said Drummond at 1 lolol"
"Don’t like the Shai and Cade comp. Shai is significantly better as a ball handler but Cade is stronger and a better defender. Shai is more of a Kyrie type player whereas Cade is like Tatum or a less athletic PG13 but with somewhat better playmaking.  Green and LaVine is pretty solid.  Mobley and Bosh is a bit optimistic for Mobleys offense but not bad.  Suggs is super athletic, he’s more of a Jrue Holiday IMO.  Moody and Mikal is fine but pretty optimistic  Kuminga’s ceiling comp is more of a Jaylen Brown. Less optimistically, I guess Kelly Oubre. Floor is maybe more explosive Stanley Johnson.  Bouk is more of a Jordan Clarkson or Raptors Demar Derozan, an athletic scoring guard.  Davion and Jrue is fine. Realistically he’s a more athletic Pat Bev though.  Wagner-Ariza is ok I guess.  Scottie is much more of a big than OG, and OG, while a solid passer, doesn’t playmake like Scottie. I’d say he’s more like Draymond at the very high end, Rondae Hollis Jefferson on the low end."
partially.  he also called out Stanley Johnson and Wiggins
NBA MVP and DPOY Stanley Johnson?
You mean top 5 player in the league Stanley Johnson?
who the fuck is stanley johnson
Stanley Johnson sounds like a baseball player from 1906
"you're all praising this guy for picking giannis - and good for him - but he  he also really picked andrew wiggins and stanley johnson, and said this:  &gt; ***Kawhi Leonard is extremely overrated, a good player, but is gaining success under Popovich and because of the players around him  it's an L overall for sure"
Stanley Johnson lmao  Stanley isn't even a top 5 player on our bench.
"I don’t remember a single person being really excited about Stanley Johnson when he was drafted.   Solid? Yeah, maybe. But top 5 in the league potential? Nah. Must be a Syracuse fan."
Stanley Johnson was a great punchline to all this.
Who is Stanley Johnson?
"No offense but Pistons had multiple opportunities to get out of that hole, but they consistently drafted terribly with picks like Stanley Johnson over Booker and Luke Kennard over Donovan Mitchell among many others. I trust that the Spurs could find a star in the mid first round eventually."
"I got you bro. Stanley Johnson, Cade, Caruso, SGA, Scola"
Stanley Johnson. He's 25
"&gt;Lebron James: he is a physical specimen the league had never seen before, who is to say he won't age differently than other player, I still think it will be his league 5 years from now  smart man  dude only seriously missed on wiggins (cant blame him, everyone did) and stanley johnson (im confused on that one lol i dont remember his hype ever being *that* high)"
It's true. Stanley Johnson is top 5 easily
OP wrote Stanley Johnson at 5. I have no words.
Stanley Johnson &gt; Giannis and its not close
&gt; Stanley Johnson   got any examples of him carrying himself a certain way
"Stanley Johnson, top 7 player in the league"
Stanley Johnson. I thought he had Larry “ Grandmama” Johnson potential. I thought he was going to be a beast
Scottie Barnes is Stanley Johnson 2.0
"*giannis being top 5 is ridiculous, but what exactly seperates him from stanley johnson or wiggins*       hindsight is always 20/20, but it will always be funny."
"Stanley Johnson? How the fuck??? Stanley was always terrible, I remember us wanting to draft Booker"
u/Dabawse26 Giannis? LOL  Funny how things pan out- I have no clue who Stanley johnson is/ was but apparently they looked good 5 years ago
He’s my Stanley Johnson chill
"Stanley Johnson lmfao. I also liked the ""what sets Giannis apart from Johnson and Wiggins"" lmfao. Aside from talent, skill and physical gifts plus inhuman worth ethic, nothing much."
~ Googles Stanley Johnson ~
I dont even remember who the hell is stanley johnson
"Literally lol'ed at ""#5 Stanley Johnson"""
Where’s Stanley Johnson on that list
What does he really do that separates him from Wiggins or Stanley Johnson tho???
"My mans is still rocking with the Det Stanley Johnson flair, I wouldn't agitate him"
S/O Stanley Johnson Lol
The GOAT Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson on this list from 5 years ago is easily the worst prediction I've ever seen
"&gt;3. Andrew Wiggins &gt;5. Stanley Johnson  Man, I forgot how much hope people had for Wiggins and Stanley."
On the wizards noone but people thought that troy brown jr was going to be something and for the raps uh idk stanley johnson was a bust
Stanley johnson
"Normy declining the PO so he can just come back for the Raps and we get him+GTJ 🙏 Masai long con to screw Portland over and don’t forget somehow Lillard also joins Toronto for Baynes, Hood and Stanley Johnson. Simply amazing."
"there are people who were drafted above booker who arent even in the NBA anymore, like mario hezonja.  okafor is almost out of the league  maybe the suns could see devin's ability but the 12 teams that passed on him clearly couldn't, otherwise he would have been taken over stanley johnson and frank kaminsky"
&gt;I think he is in Chris Paul's head at this point.  Scott “Stanley Johnson” Foster
"Lowry is better than Conley. Cant believe Im even saying this, but Stanley Johnson is basically Thybulle and he's only 1 year older."
"Lowry has not declined at all yet. Youre trading for an allstar. Also, Stanley Johnson can basically do what Thybulle does rn and he's only 1 year older."
"Overrating Thybulle and underrating Lowry. We have too many guards in the first place, and certainly dont need another bottom of the rotation 3nD guard. We already got OG who fills the archetype low volume 3nD already as well as McCaw who is a Nick Nurse favourite, Stanley Johnson, Bembry and Paul Watson."
I always thought Stanley Johnson was great.
"To be fair, any time Stanley Johnson does anything positive at all, Matt Devlin pretty much climaxes"
"Listen, I will always root for the Raptors to win the game I'm watching. But there's tons of upside to losing this season as well.   First of all, this is a fake ass season. Half the league has covid, the Raptors are playing 72 road games essentially, and there's so much shit going on that I really don't think this season matters. Asterisk season. If there's a year to bottom out and just chalk it up to external circumstances, it's this one.  Second, I'm tired of always having to develop guys. I love that our team is filled with underdog guys who were drafted late and worked their way to starring roles for this franchise are great stories, but our only lottery picks on the roster are Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. For once can we just have a naturally gifted talent to build around? Can we get a Ja Morant or a Jayson Tatum. Even RJ Barrett would be a great type of player to take and develop under an organization that has proven to get the best out of its draft picks. Why not? This year's draft class is supposed to be stacked, this is the year to have a top pick. We have never signed a star free agent, we could trade for one, but we have no real trade pieces without gutting this roster for it to be even worth it. The easiest way to inject star potential talent is with a top 5 pick. We have the pieces to go, FVV/OG/Siakam, and you pair that up with a Cade/Mobley and we're off. It's just one season."
Cant believe we turned Stanley Johnson into a basketball player. Dudes still only 24. Plenty of time to fix his shot.
Reminder: Stanley Johnson is still only 24 years old. He can still turn into a solid 3 &amp; D player.
Stanley johnson is a whole nba player
Stanley Johnson 2-2 from three what the fuck
STANLEY JOHNSON IS HIS NAME
Stanley Johnson hit a three what the fuck  Edit: Stanley Johnson is 2-2 on threes what the fuck.
I'm here for the Stanley Johnson redemption arc!
i remembered when i used to talk shit about Stanley Johnson before he became a Raptor  now I stan for him
Stanley Johnson MIP 2021
Idc what anyone says. There should be a reward for turning Stanley Johnson into a basketball player.
"Fuckin Stanley Johnson a legit contributor, Chris Boucher with 16 points on 4-5 shooting, Yuta +15, Bench mob is back on the menu!"
Stanley Johnson is a Two-Way player  Defense and Turnover
Ahhh theres some classic Stanley Johnson
"Damn that’s a real shame, y’know a place where we could set him up for success and also might be tanking? Bring him home you guys can have Stanley Johnson and 2 seconds trust me he’s good now /s"
"I mean from an objective perspective they'd be very wise to keep Allen and give him a long term deal.  From a Worst Center Rotation in the League perspective, he's trash and you should trade him to us for Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson and a 2nd round pick."
"I'll state out front that this is an active debate among Raptors fans, but there is a growing number of us that believe in doing a 2019-2020 Warriors style rebuild, where we suck for one year to grab a talented young player.  We have 2 lottery picks on our team: Stanley Johnson and Alex Len. A lot of our players are really good (OG, Fred, Siakam, Kyle) but we don't have a #1 option and ultimately that puts a cap on our ceiling.  We're playing in f*cking Tampa Bay during a pandemic, where every game is an away game, we got off to a terrible start and have a team with fundamental flaws (e.g. our centers are unplayable, except Boucher who isn't a center), and we're probably looking at a competitive 2nd round series at best right now.  If we can dip into the lottery, grab a top 5 guy in this stacked draft, and then go back to being perennially competitive, I think it's a great move."
"1. We've blown a lot of double-digit leads.  2. At the start of the season Siakam struggled a lot.  He's playing way better now, and although it hasn't translated to wins, the team (at least the starting lineup) is looking better.  3. We have big problems at centre.  Ibaka and Gasol left which has had a huge impact, Baynes and Len have been hot garbage and borderline unplayable, Chris Boucher has been very good but he isn't really a true 5.  4. We have no bench.  Norm Powell has struggled a lot (wild shooting splits of 43% on 3PAs and 31% on 2PAs), Boucher has been good off of the bench but if Baynes and Len are this bad then you might need to start Boucher.  Nick Nurse has Terence Davis and Matt Thomas (especially Matt Thomas) on super short leashes, I'm assuming because of defense, which means they're barely playing.  Malachi Flynn has only seen real minutes in three games, two of which he didn't do much and one which he played well.  TLDR: Stanley Johnson is getting consistent rotation minutes, which should tell you all you need to know about the Raptors rotation problems at the moment."
"Hey we'll take him, we can give you Stanley Johnson or possibly even Aaron Baynes. Both have twitter fan clubs and uhh...I can't really think of anything else they'd bring to your squad"
I would give up Stanley Johnson for him  Both are expiring so they might as well take the younger player and hope for him to develop
You think the Cavs would do a Stanley Johnson and second round pick for JaVale McGee?
"Toronto for Terence Davis, Stanley Johnson and a pair of Lowry's boxers"
These responses suck so far  &amp;#x200B;  let's spice it up  &amp;#x200B;  Stanley Johnson  Gerald Green  Gerald Wallace
Fuck it - Stanley Johnson for Harden.
Stanley Johnson 😤
"&gt;Westbrook isn't very good at basketball anymore.  He's averaging a 20 point triple double in the NBA (admittedly on awful percentages, but that will most likely progress back to normal). Clearly, he's not as good as he used to be, but Russell is still a top 40 player in the world who's had a bad start to his season. He was All-NBA just last season.   I'm just saying, ""he's not very good at basketball"" is a term that should be reserved for Stanley Johnson, not a dude averaging a triple fucking double."
okay you need more drastic measures.  such as returning SGA to Canada.  we will provide you with one stanley johnson.
"kyle fouls damion lee of all people on a game winner. We were up at least 10 on portland most of this game and multiple times. Spurs game we actually should have won. Sixers we were up most of the game and gave it away. Stanley Johnson getting lots of pt. Look at CJ's winner tonight, almost no resistance. This isn't a team desperately playing to actually win. Otherwise they should probably be .500 at worst right now."
That's Pistons legend Stanley Johnson to you
"We lost Kawhi, Danny Green, Ibaka and Gasol, and replaced them with Stanley Johnson, Alex Len and Aron Baynes."
"* Siakam triple double  * Stanley Johnson getting minutes and not being ass  * Another monster Boucher game and he didn't even foul out  * CJ hot streak keeps going  * Melo is still clutch  * Raptors stay in contention for Cade, Blazers tied for 4th  You know what, this has been a pretty good evening."
Stanley Johnson &gt; Damian Lillard
Stanley Johnson and Justise Winslow look a lot more athletic coming into the league than they actually are
"If you were to tell me Stanley Johnson was out here outplaying Norman Powell, I'd think we were still stuck in 2020"
#STANLEY JOHNSON IS ONLY 24
Stanley Johnson goated wdym. Hes Kawhi 2.0
Most impressive thing all season. Stanley Johnson has become a playable NBA player.
"I’m just a fan of girthy thicc muscular jacked chad like Stanley Johnson, Justise Winslow, Semi Ojeleye, Admiral Schofield"
Did Norman Powell regress? Stanley johnson is better than him lol
Stanley Johnson looking more like an NBA player than Baynes and Len combined.
I l-like Stanley Johnson??
Lol Stanley Johnson getting hunted on switches.. you wouldn’t believe there was a time where he thought he lived in LeBrons head
OG shooting like Stanley Johnson and Johnson shooting like OG
We are going to make Stanley Johnson into an NBA caliber player by the time this season is over
that was a soft ass pass from Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson does not want to play for a rebuilding team. Obviously as a megastar his opinion would carry a lot of weight.
Is Stanley Johnson not a viable back up forward?
Beal for Norm + Stanley Johnson? Who says no?
&gt; Nurse should have put anyone but Norm back  Who though?  Stanley Johnson maybe but at least Norm has a history of playing in big moments.  Stanley is an unknown for Nurse.
The real story here is Stanley fucking Johnson  being +10 despite doing basically nothing.
"That's the GOAT Stanley Johnson, put some respect on his name"
Looking over the Raps +/- Stanley Johnson +10. Only other positive is Siakam at +2
"Only Stanley Johnson could have 3 points  nothing else, and be +10 lmao"
Stanley Johnson is ass cheeks. How is he still in the league?? bricks bricks bricks
We are... its called tanking. Its why Stanley Johnson is getting minutes.
I don't think Stanley Johnson is a good player but his hair kind of reminds me of DeRozan's and that's a good thing
Dude got wreckt by Stanley Johnson.
As opposed to... Stanley Johnson and the shadow of Pat McCaw?
I thought Josh Selby from Kansas was gonna be like Baron Davis 2.0 lol  &amp;#x200B;  I was also really high on Josh Jackson and Stanley Johnson becoming Kawhi Leonard-lites.
I really thought Stanley Johnson could be an 18/8/4 guy with All-NBA Defense. Like a less scoring Jimmy Butler/Paul George.
"If you just look at things that way sure. But you’re ignoring that important players on the roster have regressed (Siakam, Norm, Kyle), our bench is significantly worse with players such as Stanley Johnson getting heavy minutes, us not having an actual home court (ie in our home game against the Celtics the crowd booed us - fuck playing in Tampa), and our defensive rotations have been worse with some experimenting by NN that I haven’t been a fan of. It’s a shitload of stuff."
Stanley Johnson can really guard the paint just off of his footballer body
Stanley “Yes Sir” Johnson
Cant believe Nick Nurse is gonna turn Stanley Johnson into a bootleg OG
Stanley Johnson on thr court. This can only get more interesting lol
"Oh no they've brought in Stanley Johnson  (I mean I guess ""nobody is playing defence tonight"" is probably the best situation to bring him into a game, but...)"

We will give you one Stanley Johnson and one Aron Baynes. Final offer
"Dante is on the Cavs and just got Injured. Jahlil Okafor is on the bench as a Piston. Emmanuel Mudiay is out of the league now. Stanley Johnson is on the Raptors but little playing time. Justise Winslow has been injured a long time but he is o the Grizzlies. Kris Dunn is an ok player  who plays for the Hawks now and is a very good defender. Thon Maker is on the Cavs basically almost out of the league. Skal is almost out of the league also. Josh Jackson is making a comeback this year on the Pistons. Frank Ntilikina is still on the Knicks. DSJ is still on the knicks. TJ Leaf  is a free agent I believe. Dwayne Bacon is on the Magic right now. Marvin Bagley is still doing well on the Kings but is injured a lot. Mo Bamba is trash on the Magic, Zhaire Smith is out of the league almost. Mo Wagner is ok on the Wizards now."
"Exum - Plays on the Cavs; Jazz traded him for Jordan Clarkson. Rotation player at best.  Jahlil - Third stringer on the Pistons; only good in very situational matchups. Could be out of the league soon.  Mudiay - Currently not playing in the NBA. Struggled in Utah although I think Utah should've kept him because they really don't have a backup point guard right now.  Stanley Johnson - Somehow got a player option on the Raptors; good wing defender but zero offensive presence. Raptors may need a guy with a skillset like him or he could be out of the league.  Justise Winslow - Has been injured for what seems like a year now on the Grizzlies. Hopefully he'll get a chance in their starting lineup but he's starting to look like a bust.  Dragan Bender - Bust, out of the league  Kriss Dunn - Third stringer on the Hawks now. Injured, but may see time for his defensive skills.  Thon Maker - Third stringer on the Cavs, may be out of the league soon.  Skal - Out of the league currently, wish somebody would give him a chance as a rotation center though.  Josh Jackson - Had a small resurgence in Memphis but signed with Detroit I believe. Could continue to develop as a rotation wing there.  TJ Leaf - Got salary dumped to OKC and then waived. Good riddance.  Okay I'm done."
"Well when the Centers above him in rotation are injured Okafor kicks ass. Dante Exum had injuries, Emmanuel Mudiay sat on Utah’s bench last year and did alright, Stanley Johnson is stealing minutes from Matt Thomas on my Raptors, Justise Winslow played like 7 games last season (I think), Dragan Bender turned out to only be a baby Dragan, Kris Dunn has a worse jumper then Stevie Wonder, Thon Maker realized he was ass and kept a connection to that by making Thongs, Skal Labissiere is still trying to learn how to spell his name, Josh Jackson’s doing alright on the Pistons this year Phoenix was pretty impatient with his effiency and consistency, Frank Ntilikina is the god and you will not besmirch his name, Dennis Smith Jr got traded to the Knicks where player development comes to die, TJ Leaf never turned over a new leaf, Dwayne Bacon burned his foot on a George Foreman grill cooking himself, Marvin Bagley gets injured more then I get rejected (a lot), Mo Bamba is hardly playing this season, Zhaire Smith is Zhaire Smith and Mo Wagner is existing"
"Im not sure you’re aware we have the worst center rotation in the NBA and perhaps the worst depth chart as well, bolstering a whopping 2 small forwards one of whom is Stanley Johnson.   3 good starters is no where near enough to be a .500 team. We can move Lowry for assets and bottom out quite easily.  If it sounds like I’m underselling the team, I’m not. We are 1-6"
Is Marvin Bagley really *that* bad that he’s being lumped in with Stanley Johnson and Dennis Smith Jr?
it gets sketchy because then teams have incentive to lie about some of their player's injuries. If the raptors claim Stanley Johnson has a season ending injury then boom thats cap space back for free basically.
Stanley Johnson
Im still surprised he didnt at least become the wing version of Stanley Johnson. Cant shoot a lick not someone you want ever creating but an awesome defender who hangs in the league that way.   Zach Lowe said on draft night that year Detroit internally was down to either Devin Booker or Stanley Johnson for the pick when they were on the clock. That type of decision can define your fate and future for teams in undesirable markets for FAs
Malachi Richardson and Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson
So you're telling me if our boy Stanley Johnson undergoes a legal name change to DeThrone Green. Raps are back in the fight to the finals for 2020? Obviously have to face former Toronto Raptor Danny Green in the ECF against Philly.
"I'd half agree but Siakam is looking rough out there. We lost a lot of defensive intangibles but are playing as if we still had the best D in the league, all while being a complete offensive black hole even by normal standards. There's a lot of doomer raps fans rn but the pattern I've noticed is playing well(ish) for 50-70% of the game and then having an astonishing collapse and not scoring for 5-7 minutes. We had these moments before but with less frequency and with that suffocating defense stemming the bleeding.   I'm no coach but in those moments of freefall we need to give some of our underutilized offensive players (Thomas, Boucher, Powell [I swear] and ... TD2) more chances to just get buckets, you can't go 5+ minutes without scoring, it fucks everything up. Drop midrangers, do something.  The outside shooting has been uncharacteristically trash and that will probably regress to the mean but I can't help but find the rotations and strategy odd. Why would you play Stanley Butterfingers Johnson in the middle of a huge scoring drought? If your hard-nosed defense is utterly failing against a top-form Celtics then put your scorers in, it doesn't matter lol. There are signs of life at least?!"
stanley johnson?
Can confirm. We have Stanley Johnson and Alex Len.
Might have to actually start Stanley Johnson with the talent that we'll have left.
The 2019-2020 raptors also only had 1 lottery pick  That was Stanley Johnson the worst player on the roster
"Lowry, FVV, OG, Siakam?, Boucher, and I don't even know at this point. Matt Thomas? Norm as a trade piece? Stanley fucking Johnson? We're a mess man"
"&gt; They got Baynes, Thomas, Alex Len, Stanley Johnson, Terrance Davis, Bembry, RHJ, Flynn  So basically no one."
"No one really.   They got Baynes, Thomas, Alex Len, Stanley Johnson, Terrance Davis, Bembry, RHJ, Flynn  Like some decent players where some could potentially carve out roles in a playoff rotation. But downgrades compared to Kawhi, Green, Ibaka, Gasol."
"He should get used to it. Even if he turns it around he's going to be the scapegoat.  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles are hiding the fact that OG isnt ready to create off the dribble and if you ask him to do much more than sit in a corner shooting 3s and defend its no bueno - but he's 23 so Raptor Nation gives him a pass. I'm predicting he'll get this year as a pass and then people will start criticizing him too (thats when he'll be the age that Pascal ascended)  &amp;#x200B;  Pascals struggles also hide that Matt Thomas has an 111 defensive rating while on the floor which is absolutely disgusting defensively. Terence Davis has a 108 defensive rating. This has allowed Stanley Johnson to play (88 DRTG). Baynes has put up zero points and Len got a few rebounds.      This team has a myriad of issues, Siakam just being the most obvious."
I blame Masai for fielding a roster that requires Stanley Johnson to take the floor.
"Last year our offense was also really inconsistent, it's just that with Ibaka and Gasol, it was more likely that 2 guys would be hot and that would get us to 100+ points.   The real difference this year is that the defense isn't elite anymore. Our offense wasn't great but we made up for it by having an absolutely soul-crushing defense - I think at one point we held more teams under 100 than any other team, which was critical because we tended to barely score more than 100. Not only do we not have Ibaka and Gasol to help with this, but we also don't have Rondae and instead have to give Stanley Johnson legitimate minutes - which he's been doing surprisingly well with, but still not enough.  TL,DR: The Raptors compensated for underwhelming offense with excellent defense. With that defense gone, the poorness of the offense is exposed."
"He's been fine. His offense is generating a shit ton of open looks but guys aren't making shots, Powell and Siakam have been terrible, the big man rotation stinks and there are 3 wing defenders on the entire team (Pascal, OG, and Stanley fucking Johnson)"
Stanley Johnson for Mo Bamba straight up
Bobby filled this team with bums.  Terrence Davis  Stanley Johnson  Aaron Baynes  Alex Len  DeAndre Bembry   And we couldnt even bring back RHJ who was solid defensively and hustled his ass off????
"Everyone is ass except for FVV, Lowry and sometimes Boucher  OG struggling in his shots, Norman inconsistent and can't dribble for shit, Siakam isn't his same self, Baynes is literally ass on finishing and handling passes, Flynn too quiet on offense, TD2 and Thomas sucks on defense. Stanley johnson is Stanley Johnson, guy literally fumbles the ball every time."
I’m baffled how Vanvleet didn’t get drafted but Stanley Johnson did.
Stanley Johnson has NO offense holy fucking shit
"all commentators, even raptors commentators, confuse OG and Stanley Johnson"
Can Stanley Johnson dribble?
Siakam + Norm + Stanley Johnson + 4 FRP plz accept Houston
Stanley Johnson.
Stanley Johnson for levert :)
Stanley Johnson playing 10mpg too...
disgusting act by Stanley Johnson
"Stanley ""Steph Curry"" Johnson"
Why is Stanley Johnson on an NBA court?
Well throw in first round pick Stanley Johnson
Stanley Johnson has been in the playoffs before. Patrick McCaw is a 3x champion. Whats your point?
"Alex Len, Stanley Johnson and a top protected 1st rounder  for  James Harden, PJ Tucker and 2 lotto protected first rounders, 2nd rounder (conditional)"
Stanley Johnson
or even just luka for stanley johnson would be cool too
"I'll take Luka + Porzingis for Lowry + Stanley Johnson, does that sound fair?"
