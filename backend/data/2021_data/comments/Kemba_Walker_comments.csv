"John Wall- favorite player. He never got called 'loyal', despite playing through the days of Washington being the league's laughingstock. Looking at the team's playoff wins in the last decade, they only have one victory when Wall didn't play at an All NBA level, and he missed that game after busting his hand a few days before.   Derrick Rose - he's been one of my favorite players to watch. Absolute dynamite! His untimely injuries caused a major blow to the Eastern Conference, and he sadly won't be a Hall of Famer, but I hope he at least gets a ring.  Chris Paul - the point god. His career really speaks for itself, but a ring would cement his legacy   Bradley Beal - I think it's kinda funny to see people hop on the bandwagon during the last two years. Before 2016, he was often called an injury-prone bust, and couldn't really do much as an on ball threat, because of a lack of dribbling ability. I've loved seeing his evolution as a player to the point that he's averaging over 30. He and Wall were my favorite duo in the league too, and once Beal became the team's best scorer, Washington had their best season.  Russell Westbrook/Damian Lillard - I have them here for similar reasons. Russ' effort level is incredible, and quite frankly, I always felt he overachieved instead of the opposite.  Dame keeps Portland in the fight year after year, even when things are far from ideal. Can't ever really count them out.  Honorable mention: Mike Conley, Jimmy Butler Isaiah Thomas, Carmelo Anthony, LaMarcus Aldridge, Paul Millsap, Paul George, Al Horford and Kemba Walker"
"Jaylen  brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, Fast PP"
"Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker, Paul Millsap, Mike Conley, DeMar Derozen."
Nobody:  Kemba Walker: üòÅ
Watching Boston - GSW game and man how good Jaylen  Brown and Tatum actually are. Also how bad Kemba Walker and Tristan Thompson play. It is a good chance using this two maybe even add Marcus Smart and maybe even draft rights to get a good big man. Then we might actually see Boston is one of the best teams in NBA
Kemba Walker regularly gets swapped for defense last year. Message a celtics fan for specific games lmao.  Being purposely dumb is only funny when you're under 15 years old.
"Kemba walker is the best hornet ever, I guess its worth something to go down as the best to do it for a franchise. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Julius randle below kemba walker is an absolute travesty
I remember some of my Celtic fan friends bashing Kyrie Irving to me when he went to Brooklyn and making sure I knew that he would destroy the Nets in a similar fashion. Claiming Kemba Walker was the missing piece.   The rest is history...
"Hmmmm a declining Kemba Walker whose knees are blown out and his numbers are dropping hard and plays lesser defense all for more money then FVV is making, I'm good bro."
Because Kemba Walker is not a massive asshole.
"Kemba walker is great player but he also brings along a huge contract, old age, injury concerns, and a negative on defense..."
Hate me but I don't think kemba walker with his huge contract and injury issues is worth lonzo and adams...
"Lmaoo it's like Brad Stevens was saying about Kemba Walker after his 1/12 (or 1/15 can't remember) yesterday, ""he's a great guy, he'll eventually hit those shots"". Well, I'm glad he's a great guy. How many smiles per game does he average? And high-fives? Do those actually help the team win at all? These people live in a fantasy world"
"Probably not.   Hayward maybe makes the second team if he keeps up his incredible play.  Charlotte's starting five is likely 2018 Kemba Walker/2000 Eddie Jones/1997 Glen Rice/1993 Larry Johnson/2014 Al Jefferson,  with a second team of 2002 Baron Davis/2010 Stephen Jackson (?)/2021 Gordon Hayward (if he keeps it up)/2010 Gerald Wallace/1994/95 Alonzo Mourning  Could very easily swap Big Al and Zo, I was a toddler when Zo was in Charlotte, but Big Al's season was probably the best individual season I've seen in Charlotte, including Kemba."
Kemba Walker and Kelly Oubre share the talent of one all-star  Kelly gets it on Thursdays and every other weekend.
"Ah I see. Then I‚Äôd hold on Siakam, Sell on Kemba Walker, and buy every single SGA stock possible because he would imagine his evaluation is not that high right now."
Buying into Haliburton stock he is fr up next  I‚Äôm selling Kemba Walker stock immediately  Hold on to Lonzo for now
Thankfully for you guys we have Kemba Walker who is worse than Shane Larkin
Jaylen Brown is significantly better at basketball than Kemba Walker. There‚Äôs not a whole lot to it
"The problem lies within Kemba being a purely offensive player. There's a lot of firing power on the Celtics right now and once Kemba's shot isn't falling he becomes a net negative for any team he's playing for really. There's no defense to compensate for his streaky scoring and it's hard to keep him on the field in late-game situations because of that. It's the same reason why Boston didn't want to keep IT and while IT was smaller his physique was at least a bit more sturdy. Luckily Boston's got a bunch of elite perimeter defenders to still keep a good wing defense intact with Walker on the floor but in that case he _must_ be a consistent 20ppg guy at 40% from 3 imo in order to bring substantial value to the squad. If he can turn into this elite, sparkling secondary scorer roleplayer he may very well be worth it for Boston. But the past couple of seasons showed why Kemba was a consolation price for the Kyrie dilemma"
"Let that be a lesson to the world, no one dominates Kemba Walker 30 times in a row üò§üò§üò§"
"At First Kemba Walker, but now Rodney McGrunder"
"Kemba walker will never be fully healthy. He‚Äôs not that good anyway, he crumbles and gets attacked in the playoffs.   Milwuakee has like a top 3 Net Rating this season, they‚Äôre gonna be worse in the reg season compared to last year because they traded all their depth to get better in the playoffs, which they will be. Jrue is such an upgrade over Bledsoe come playoff time it‚Äôs not even funny."
"Fine I‚Äôll say it, I like the Hornets! I like their games! I have a hornets hat! I even got an old Kemba Walker jersey and plan on getting a Hayward one soon!"
Kemba ‚ÄúNeeds A‚Äù Walker.
Yeah don't think Marc and KCP have the same role as Kemba Walker.
Would you rather have Kemba Walker or Tobias Harris?
"As someone who hasn't watched more than 3 Celtics games since Kemba signed there, I'm going to do my duty as a member of /r/NBA and proclaim Kemba Walker as ""overrated"" and make some claim like ""they really shoulda held onto Hayward and traded Kemba for picks""."
Kemba ‚Äú2x NBA Sportsmanship Award winner‚Äù Walker
"Kemba ""needed a"" Walker on display today"
"He could really help a contender, hope the warriors get him somehow. He‚Äôs playing better than kemba walker"
Payton Pritchard is arguably better than old Kemba Walker or at least close.
"Hey Charlotte, if you find the actual Kemba Walker.... send him our way"
Kemba Good Vibes Walker going 1-10 and a missed game winner. Definitely better than Kyrie.
Fuck kemba walker. This motherfucket sucks!!  4 points on 1/12.  Like c‚Äômon man.
Kemba walker isnt a starting calibre playoff PG
"Kemba Walker came up big for you guys, MVP for the Lakers."
Kemba walker sucks. Shouldnt play over 15 mpg in playoff games.
Kemba Walker might be the least fun guy to root for in Celtics history
Kemba Walker sucks!
#AS I SAID BEFORE KEMBA WALKER IS A SOBER TY LAWSON BRO DOING NOTHING
#KEMBA WALKER IS A SOBER TY LAWSON
We unfortunately haven't made savvy front office moves like closing our championship window by trading for Kemba Walker.
"Free-throw shooting is a wash, Steph is at 90% for his career &amp; Dirk finished at 88%, there isn't a discernable difference there but that skirts the point which is this:   It's better to look at these in terms of standard deviations from their peers in my view.  Comparing a big to a small for handles/quick release isn't fair, the smaller players have advantages there (they're lower to the ground with a lower center of gravity, making changing direction easier, the ball doesn't have to bounce as far so smaller players can dribble faster and it's harder for opponents to steal it) in the same way you seem to realize that comparing dunking ability isn't fair because height gives an advantage there.  I think you need to open your mind and take away some of your confirmation bias.  You want the answer to be Steph so you look for reasons to justify this and ignore what doesn't fit your narrative.     If you judge based on standard deviations from their peers (same players in a position group) then the answer changes.  Steph has great handles, but so do plenty of other small guards like Kyrie, Dame Lillard, Kemba Walker and  others.  There are also guards that approach Steph's quick release &amp; shooting range (Dame Lillard) even if Steph is the best.  And there are definitely guards that can get to the rim and finish as well/creatively/skillfully as Steph.   Now let's do bigs.  Has there ever been a big man like Dirk that can score at all 3 levels the way he did?  Do you see a lot of bigs that can face up, post up, drive, shoot and finish the way he did?  How many bigs shot 88% from the FT line like Dirk did?  How many bigs were almost completely ambidextrous in the way Dirk was?  How many bigs had the same footwork that Dirk had?     We can't change their physical attributes so why bother thinking about it that way?  Really it's about who added to their games &amp; scoring packages and could get a bucket regardless of the defender on them and regardless of what was happening.  Steph's not a bad answer to these questions, he's just not *clarly* THE answer."
"This:     When Curry entered the NBA in 2009, the average NBA team attempted 18 threes a game. It hovered around that mark for the first three years of Curry's career until his breakout season of 2012-13 which just so happened to coincide with the NBA itself becoming more 3-point happy. The same year that Golden State's golden child set the all-time record for made 3s (a record he would go on to break multiple times in the coming years), NBA teams for the first time averaged 20 3-point attempts per game.  As Curry's shooting continued to explode and the [Warriors](https://ca.nba.com/contestant/golden-state-warriors/news/btbrq55c3e6btsf1z2poaakb4) transformed into a juggernaut, the rest of the league ramped up its efforts to keep pace with the free-wheeling Warriors. By the 2018-19 season, the fifth straight year that Curry's Warriors reached the NBA Finals, teams were shooting over 32 of them per game.  In that 2012-13 breakout campaign, Curry hoisted 7.7 per game and was the only player in the entire league to average at least seven. Care to guess how many players topped that threshold this season?  28.  There were 28 instances of something this season alone that had only happened a grand total of 28 times in NBA history prior to Curry's arrival.  Kids all over the world have spent the better part of the last decade emulating Curry in driveways, parks and gyms, a trend helped by the fact that Curry is about as physically relatable as any superstar in the history of the game. You can't just go in the driveway and uncork drop-step dunks. Or look in the mirror and pretend to be chiseled like LeBron. Even the famous tagline 'Be Like Mike' ignores the fact that it's utterly impossible to replicate the 6'6"" Air Jordan.  But anyone can heave as many off-balance 3s as humanly possible. Look no further than the NBA itself as James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kemba Walker, Trae Young and many others have followed in Curry's footsteps and leaned into the novel concept of 3 &gt; 2.  The 3-point revolution represents the biggest on-court strategic change in the history of the sport and there's no player more single-handed responsible for it than the original Splash Brother.  ""Seldom are game-changers idle."""
I would love to get Blake Griffin and Wayne Ellington for Kemba Walker and the TPE
"Balls, glen rice, Jordan Bell, Kemba Walker, Desmond bane"
Kemba Walker....Marcus smart gets an honorable mention.
"The thing with Conley is he's never been a complete snub, but if he was in the East he probably would've had 2 or 3, maybe even 4 selections by now.        -----          - 2012-13: 15/3/6 on 44/36/83 shooting to go with 2.2 steals and leading Memphis to a 56 win season.          - 2013-14: 17/3/6 on 45/36/82 shooting to go with 1.5 steals and leading Memphis to a 50 win season.           - 2014-15: 16/3/6 on 45/39/86 shooting to go with 1.3 steals and leading Memphis to a 55 win season.       - 2016-17: 21/4/6 on 46/41/86 shooting to go with 1.3 steals and leading Memphis to a 49 win season pace at the ASB.          Would‚Äôve made it in 2012-13 for an injured Rondo over Brook Lopez (A Big) or should‚Äôve been over Jrue and Kyrie in the first place as Memphis would‚Äôve been a 2 seed in the East compared to them both missing playoffs with under 35 wins.      Would‚Äôve made it in 2013-14 as he had better stats, and impacted winning more than Joe Johnson..Memphis would‚Äôve been a 3 seed in the East‚Ä¶Nets were just 24-27 at the All-Star break.     Would‚Äôve made it in 2014-15 as he had better stats than Jeff Teague and at worse better than Kyle Korver..Memphis would‚Äôve been a 2 seed in the East.     Would‚Äôve made it in 2016-17 as he impacted winning more than Kemba Walker..Memphis would‚Äôve been a 3 seed in the East at the All-Star break compared to 11 seed Hornets. Even maybe over Melo for a wildcard spot.      ----       TLDR: Conley, in the East, would've/should've been an All Star in: 2013 over Jrue, 2014 over Joe Johnson, 2015 over Korver or Teague, and 2017 over Kemba or Carmelo)"
"You brought up Trae Young and his record last year. Kemba Walker was also an Eastern Conference starter. That‚Äôs a dumb argument. Were there Eastern Conference players last year playing as well as Kyrie Irving and Jaylen Brown? That were winning games as well?  The Kyrie Irving hate is unreal on this sub. I‚Äôm not even going to vote and Kyrie Irving and James Harden will easily be named Eastern Conference All Star starters. They deserve it too, unlike the overrated player that wanted to be in Washington and has the worst record in the NBA."
"Yeah let's trade an all star point guard for 2 starter players. Come on Kemba Walker could be used to get at least another all-star or a significant number of picks + a good non-all-star, if I was the Celtics GM I'm never pulling the trigger on that deal."
He wouldn‚Äôt be averaging 35 on a good team but he is still a damn good player  Think about it like Kemba Walker on the Celtics vs Hornets before his Injuries (Kemba scored 30 on the Hornets)
Sorry the best free agents you‚Äôve had were Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker
Kemba Walker
"Trae, Harden, KD, Embiid, Giannis, Beal, Jaylen Brown, Tatum, Bam, Sabionis, Randle, Kyrie People, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, Vucevic, Lowry, Spicy P, Ben Simmons. Would Seth be better than any of these guys?"
Kemba walker is the most overpaid player in the league
"Lol yup, per ESPN play-by-play  2.4		Kemba Walker lost ball turnover (Joel Embiid steals)	110 - 122	 0.0		End of the 4th Quarter	110 - 122"
Kemba Walker was -21 tonight. Terrible.
"Ben is undefeated against Kemba walker, just goofing about that"
Ben Simmons is now 13-0 vs Kemba Walker :)
Is it too early to declare Kemba Walker as a bad signing? Whatever he brings offensively is negated by his defense. And his offense is overrated
The closest I can think of is Charlotte era Kemba Walker. It would depend on the conference and record around all star break.
"Just a cursory glance through the Knicks games proves that isn‚Äôt really the case. Against the Jazz, Conley shot 0-6, Mitchell shot 2-10, Bojan shot 1-7, those are all good shooters. Guys like Devonte Graham and Kemba Walker have been hardcore bricking and the only case of a bad shooter taking an inordinate of shots is maybe Paul Milsap if you count him."
"Even when not at full force, you still have lineups that probably could end up a top 2 seed in either conference. The much maligned world cup team from last time could have a starting lineup of Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, Khris Middleton, and Myles Turner with a pretty solid bench. They may not have the upper-end star power to match the elite teams, but that's a damn good lineup if given time to fully gel."
"&gt;Jason ""tunnel vision"" Tatum  &gt;Kemba 'One Knee left, soon will need a"" Walker  &gt;Jaylen 'Anti-clutch' Brown"
"Kemba Walker, Antoine Walker, Johnnie Walker  Nets in 5, max"
"I would LOVE for you to actually address the main point of what I'm saying instead of condescendingly assuming we ""don't know the rules"", which is that Theis call is called but Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, and Marcus Smart are driving and not getting foul calls. Celts shot 21% from the paint. You're saying that was all clean and good?  I've said from the beginning this is a consistency argument."
kemba walker constantly bitching team btw jaylen brown constantly bitching team btw
"Kemba ""Steph"" Walker"
Kemba Walker deserves to be included in the same conversation as great offensive players such as Trae Young and James Harden!
Kemba Walker is decent
Kemba Walker would rather get two free throws than a bucket
Oh sorry I forgot we consider kemba Walker to be a ‚Äústar‚Äù....
"Ben Simmons is currently 11-0 against Kemba Walker, with two more matchups in the next 3 days."
"lmao okay buddy  Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker can't handle Jimmy Butler, but they can KD/Harden/Kyrie, let alone AD and LeBron.  Come on. Don't be stupid."
What are Lowry's stats? Everyone calls him a flopper but my homer bias makes me think he isn't that much worse than most small guards like Kemba Walker.
Obviously? lol when was Kemba Walker vs Lonzo ball ever a debate? They're totally different types of players and on totally different levels.
"What did Joe Harris get in free agency?  What about FVV?  What about Kemba Walker?  What about Hayward?  What about Jerami Grant?  He‚Äôs getting a big contract nephew.  Celtics should try to get vucevic, but they won‚Äôt do it."
"Love this last bit!     ""Look at this year. Charlotte didn‚Äôt have to do Gordon Hayward as a sign and trade. They weren‚Äôt dumping salary and still had to eat (Nicolas) Batum‚Äôs salary. But they did it because the year before, Boston helped them get Terry Rozier in the double sign and trade with Kemba Walker. That‚Äôs how you build equity and good relationships.  I think Danny has made so many deals with everyone because there‚Äôs no (expletive). No one feels like information is being withheld or that they are being lied to. That‚Äôs important in our business. You have to have trust and I trust Boston when making a trade.‚Äù"
"I dedicate my comment to my one true love, Kemba Walker"
"Remember that the context that we're having this discussion in is ""how can the Sixers do the jump they need to really be in a position to contend?. A Kemba Walker kind of player is not going to be a catalyst that will make Simmons change his style of play this much."
"I think the problem with Allen is, he's due a fat contract that makes it so he is the third piece.  No wiggle room.  As it is, when Walker's contract expires, the Celtics will have a shot at a free agent to pair with Brown and Tatum before they get 30% max contracts.  That would literally be the last chance to add any free agent to Brown and Tatum in their primes.  If they had to re-sign Allen (sunk cost and all of giving up picks), his salary would remove any cap space before Brown and Tatum get paid.  &amp;#x200B;  Personally, I don't think Allen is all that great to be the third best player on a championship team.  And Boston is attractive enough that they could risk it and hope for free agency.  A Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker tier player is much better than Jarrett Allen.  I might be wrong, but I don't see Allen ever being as good as third options on recent championship teams (Lowry, Klay, Love)"
"Incorrect. Korver missed 2 games but Teague, Horford, and Milsap played every game in the ECF.  Moreover, you can make hypothetical superteams with 3 all-stars that people wouldn't consider favorites or even contenders. For example a team with Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, and Kemba Walker."

tbf we had half a kemba walker and no tatum   didn‚Äôt really have the means to bully him today
There‚Äôs Anthony Day-to-Davis Now there‚Äôs Kemba Week-to-Walker
"Boston is cursed with All-star point guards. Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving and now Kemba Walker"
"Yes.  I‚Äôll go a step further, Kemba Walker will not help us win a Championship. Signing him was a mistake and it‚Äôs just another ‚ÄúIT, Kyrie‚Äù archetype player that Ainge loves for some reason.  The undersized high volume, mid efficiency, defensive black hole, below average playmaking PG is being phased out of the league yet Danny is convinced is the way forward and it pisses me off."
"Kemba Walker was a dumb move. He‚Äôs a high volume, mid efficiency defensive black hole that isn‚Äôt valuable to a team w/ title aspirations. He‚Äôs a great locker room guy but isn‚Äôt good enough for what he gets paid. Not to mention how absolutely rubbish he is on defence.   That archetype of undersized point guard who is quick and scores a lot but is abysmal defensively just doesn‚Äôt work anymore. We tried it with IT, Kyrie and now failed w/ Kemba and I can‚Äôt wait till he‚Äôs off the books and we sign an actual max player that isn‚Äôt a liability in the Playoffs, I just hope we still have the Jays at that point.  Just to turn it up a notch, I‚Äôd rather we paid Scary Terry than Kemba. Better defender, better off ball movement and showed up in the Playoffs. He just fits our team identity which is built on defence so much more. Not to mention the bad habits our guys have picked up from Kembas iso game by just standing around.  I also fully understand that we had to spend the money or it would‚Äôve been invalid, but I still feel it wasn‚Äôt the right move.  Before Celtics fans grab their pitchforks, this is MY OPINION. It‚Äôs probably filled w/ bias cause I‚Äôm not a fan of undersized PGs but Kemba hasn‚Äôt done much to change that either."
"Do we need Kemba if we have Payton ""Kemba Walker"" Pritchard?"
"On the flip side, which of the All Stars in the last three years who won‚Äôt make the All Star Game this year? My pick is Kemba Walker."
Not to mention Kemba Walker
ask Travis Schlenk.   and yeah i‚Äôm never going to trust a guy who shoots 42% from the field to be my lead guy. that‚Äôs called kemba walker and it gets you 8 seeds.    this isn‚Äôt even mentioning Cam is going to be a 2-way stud and Trae is literally the worst defender in the NBA  have fun winning in the playoffs trying to score off jumping into guys on the 3pt line and having a revolving door at point guard
Cole Anthony is a homeless mans Kemba Walker and a rich mans Shabazz Napier.
"So let me get this straight- without Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker, **AND** Carsen Edwards, the Celtics still obliterated a playoff team??"
"&gt; **9 Payton Pritchard has a nose for the ball**  &gt; Where would the Celtics be without Pritchard? They are plus-45 in his 229 minutes, and minus-27 in the remaining 251 minutes. All but nearly 50 of Pritchard's minutes have come with one of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, but not both, meaning Pritchard has been crucial in Boston's offense staying afloat in minutes that are precarious without Kemba Walker.  &gt; The Celtics have gutted out a 7-3 record despite outsourcing opponents by just 18 points total. They have four wins by five or fewer points. Scrounging games you maybe shouldn't pays off in playoff seeding.  &gt; Pritchard is active on defense, with a knack for anticipating when it is safe to gamble for steals. Turn your back on him in some location Pritchard deems non-threatening, and beware a Pritchard sneak.  &gt; There are guys who read the game at such a high level -- and move fast enough -- that for them, gambling isn't really gambling. They have an edge. They count cards, basically. Manu Ginobili was a card-counter. What was reckless for most was not so for him because he operated one step ahead.  &gt; Pritchard might be a card-counter. He's averaging two steals per 36 minutes -- an elite number."
"You would do pretty well with a team made up of Smart and Brown and maybe a slightly lesser scorer, like say, Kemba Walker, especially if you could pair them all together with a solid young wing like, maybe, Jason Tatum."
you‚Äôre mad I‚Äôm giving you the harsh truth about your poverty franchise LOL. You have lost more free agents than us these past couple of years. Maybe Kemba Walker will make up for it hahahaha
I walked out of the room for 2 minutes and thought this dude was Kemba Walker at first
Kemba walker looks different here
Who knew Kemba Walker was a better singer than Oladipo
Is that kemba walker singing????? Jkjk
"I mean, Ainge saw a team around Tatum and Brown and thought the best point guard to pair them with was Kemba Walker, lol."
"The Warriors are just bad luck for the TWolves come draft time.   1989: Wolves select Point Guard Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick. This allows Golden State to select another Point Guard by the name of TIM HARDAWAY. Shawn Kemp and Vlade Divac were also available.   2009: Wolves use two First Round picks on Point Guards: Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. Unfortunately, this paves the way for Golden State to pick up a PG of their own: STEPHEN CURRY. DeMar DeRozan and Jrue Holiday were also ripe for the taking.   2011: Timberwolves draft Derrick Williams at 2nd overall. A total bust. Not like the guy that went to Golden State at Pick Number 11: KLAY THOMPSON. They also missed out on Kemba Walker and Kawhi Leonard. Woof."

Kemba Walker is still the best player on the Celtics (which doesn't bode well for the future). Shoutout to the Celtics fans that gave up on Kemba after seven games.
"Lmao I'm sure now r/nba will be saying how the Jays aren't good, they're just carried by a good surrounding cast such as great players like Kemba Walker!"
Kemba walker the return?
Fine  u/celtics get:  Bradley Beal  Davis Bertans  Moritz Wagner  u/WashWizards get:  Kemba Walker  Tristan Thompson  Javonte Green  2021 - RD 1  2021 - RD 2  2021 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/qr\_UOhwtQ
"&gt;Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?  you dont need to salary match if the team has has the cap space to absorb it."
"Who are they gonna get that's better, though?   Even considering throwing in Adams's contract, you're looking at a real small amount of ""players that make a ton of money and are tradeable."" Chris Paul? Ben Simmons? Kemba Walker?   Seems like they're gonna have to back the Brinks truck up, or punt completely on this season by trading for bad contracts and picks, which feels antithetical to where they are in their development."
"Their defense will likely get exploited since they have plenty of weak defenders in their rotation. Mismatches get hunted over and over ala Lou Will and Kemba Walker. Bron will look for his own on Kyrie, Shamet, etc. and also looking to get AD/Shroeder their mismatches."
you say that like Kemba Walker isn't a multiple time All-Star lmfao
"I think the TT acquisition was fine but that doesn't excuse poor roster construction.   I felt like I've had a few conversations with Celtics fans recently who've made the comment: ""Who could we have traded for?"". For the record I'm on board with not dumping one of the Jays/Smart in a rental. That's fine.  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
Apart from the Pelicans game he‚Äôs been pretty solid the past 2 weeks. Looks healthy. Looks like Kemba Walker.
I was beginning to think that the Celtics were the only team who were allowed to lose because of Kemba Walker
"Kemba Walker, dubbed ""worst contract in the league"" by Celtics fans, is carrying the two All-Stars that ""have the worst supporting cast in the league"".  Green teamers have developed cult worship for Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens and have decided to absolve any responsibility on them."
Kemba Walker has been far better than Tatum and Brown over the past few weeks but green teamers will still find ways to blame the team's issues onto him.
"Remember when he picked Kemba Walker over James Harden because he wanted ‚Äúsomeone that would pass the ball‚Äù, as if Harden isn‚Äôt a better passer than Kemba with his eyes closed? Giannis was horrible at drafting last year."

Just like he was obsessed with Kemba Walker.  We traded Harrison Barnes for cap space. We used that cap space to resign players.
"Kemba ""Toxic Positivity"" Walker"
Pretty much. He weirdly likes Kemba Walker too tho.

They called it on Luka against Kemba Walker a couple days ago too.   I'd never seen it called an offensive foul before but if they're gonna start I'm 100% on board.
"The Celtics have unquestionably regressed since last year. They lost Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self.  You probably wouldn't beat the Raptors in a 7 game series starting today, and I would favor the Raps in a few months time.  It's good to have a player as great as Jayson Tatum but the Celtics aren't really going in the right direction anymore. If I had told you that this would be the current roster around 2017, would you be happy with that?"
"We effectively lost 2 All-Star level players, Gordon Hayward left, and the Kemba Walker we have now is a far cry from the Kemba Walker we had last year.   It's really that simple."
They did.  Kemba Walker still exists.
"Kemba Walker has never ever in his eight years in the NBA been as good as Westbrook. Kemba is also undersized, Westbrook is not."
Just looking at Kemba Walker and his contract should have been enough for you to understand that this statement is wrong.
"That's not the argument at all.   &gt;Deandre Jordan or Kevin Durant as a scorer? Sure KD puts up a hyper efficient 30 a game, but Jordan's is more efficient, so wouldnt you take him?  You're using a very generic TS% argument that doesn't actually apply. In the Durant/DJ comparison, both have positive efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a positive addition, therefore you want more of them.   Deandre Jordan = +12  Kevin Durant = +27  +27 &gt; + 12   In the Kyrie/Kemba comparison, both have negative efficiencies so their scoring possessions are a negative subtraction so you actually want less of them.   Kyrie Irving = -21  Kemba Walker = -17  -17 &gt; - 21  It's basic number line math. More negatives is not more good. A guy scoring poorly isn't helping you by scoring even more poorly.   Another example is Carmelo Anthony. Would you rather have Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a star or Old Carmelo Anthony trying to play like a role player?  At this point in his career, Carmelo Anthony trying to score 20ppg is detrimental to his team, he's better off scoring in a limited capacity and letting other guys take the shots instead.  &gt; so for all intents and purposes, Kemba and Kyrie are on the same level of inefficiency during these selected spans.  And for all intents and purposes, when Kyrie was sucking ass through a straw he tried to be the hero and got in everyone's way. When Kemba was sucking ass through a straw he let the Jays take over as the #1 and #2 options."
"You're a Nets fan who spends most of their time complaining about the Celtics.   Not really a great position to talk about salt.   &gt;Jayson Tatum is not an all-star. I mea 54% TS, negative net rating and mediocre defense doesn‚Äôt exactly signal All Star.  &gt; Harris deserves it over Tatum or Brown  &gt; Mostly salty Boston fans  &gt; Um no Bird is not ahead of KD  &gt;No they haven‚Äôt been as good as Tobias Harris or Ben Simmons. Tatum has league average offensive efficiency. Brown 59% is good not all-star level. Defense down for both.  &gt;Boston should trade Kemba Walker, who might be one of the few players with a worse contract, for Blake.  &gt;Yes 56% TS doesn‚Äôt scream superstar, it‚Äôs about league average.  &gt; Can‚Äôt even beat the Wizards  &gt;Maybe just maybe he‚Äôs not great yet, I mean 56% TS nothing to write home about  &gt;Remember when people were comparing Kemba to Beal?  &gt;Cs are one loss way from blowing it all up, you can feel it here ..  &gt;Tobias Harris &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kemba Walker which is incredible to think about considering what was being said about Harris‚Äô contract at the beginning of the season.  &gt;etc etc."
"&gt; they have enough  They have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, neither of whom are high enough level ball handlers. Kemba Walker is a shell of his former self. Marcus Smart is out for a while. The rest of the team is very one dimensional and there's like one role player shooter who defences actually respect."
"Coming out of an all-time bad conference and teaming up with 2 other all stars when 80% of the top players in the league were in the West  Very impressive going through the corpses of KG/Pierce/Ray, 20yo Rose, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Demar Defrozen, Kyle Lowry, Marcus Morris, 5'6 Isaiah Thomas, 5'7 Kemba Walker, teenage Jayson Tatum etc. Most these guys can't even make AS teams in the West (Isaiah, Demar, Lowry, Millsap, Horford, even PG was an injury replacement his first year etc). And these guys were his main competition in the shitty ass Least hahahaha. And he had Wade/Bosh or Kyrie/Love on his team  The best player Lebron saw in the East for his finals streak was Paul George LMFAO. And we see what Playoff P truly is in a real conference the past 3 seasons. Upset as the favorite 3 straight years, getting sonned by Joe Ingles, CJ McCollum and Gary Harris."
I'd want to forget about Kemba Walker too dont worry bro.
Kemba Walker and a 1st for John Wall
Kemba Walker (go home and think long and hard about how bad you're playing right now.) - OUT
"The defence on the 2nd shot was terrible lol. Blew past his man with no resistance, that man never recovered to have any sort of effective contest, Kemba Walker was the other guy and he literally didn‚Äôt effect the shot in anyway because he‚Äôs miniature"
"Orlando domintes: Washington  Orlando is dominated by: any team with Kemba Walker on it, Clippers, Blazers"
Here are some of OP's great threads:  -Would a Tyler Herro for Ben Simmons deal be good?  -The Jokic vs Embiid debate solely exists due to the referees having terrible calls  -Should the Sixers trade for Kemba Walker?  -Is Embiid dodging good competition by blaming his back injury?  -Will people start seeing that Ben Simmons really isn't good enough to lead a team or help a team win a chip?
"Three of the East starters from last year didn‚Äôt even make it this year. Pascal Siakam, Trae Young, and Kemba Walker."
someone go back 4 years and tell a Celtics fan that in 2021 they have 2 all stars on their team *plus* Kemba Walker and the team‚Äôs record is below .500  it has to be Tom Brady‚Äôs fault
"What is equal value? You trade kemba for another player who currently sucks and makes 34 million? What good is that? Or maybe in two years when Beal and Walker are on their last year, you package Kemba with some picks and young players."
"There is no 'next max guy'. The only reason they were able to snag Hayward and Horford and Kemba was because they didn't have any high paid players on the roster. Now they have Tatum, Brown, Kemba. Smart due for a raise after next year, too. The TPE isn't enough to absorb a max contract. So the next max guy, if there is one, will be a result of trading Kemba Walker as the main salary going out. Which may be fine, but probably not going to happen until he's an expiring contract and some disgruntled star is looking to be traded."
"Y'all had Kemba Walker too then. If you can find Kemba, you'd be an ECF team again."
I wonder how Kemba Walker feels right now.
Kemba walker has been trash.
Don‚Äôt bring up Kemba Walker like he‚Äôs a positive right now. If you think he‚Äôs a plus can we have Dejonte Murray for him?
"But that‚Äôs my point. On paper the Celtics still look better than the Spurs to me, yet the Spurs have a better record and gets 0 all-stars. Tatum and Brown have Kemba Walker and Marcus Smart."
"                   Since the IT trade:  Hayward breaks ankle, then never stops getting hurt and leaves team  Kyrie gets hurt in 2018 missing the playoffs and ending any real chance Boston has  The 2019 season I often to refer to it as ""the year I almost gave up watching basketball""  Kyrie is a butthole and leaves Boston, Horford breaks our hearts and goes to Philly  Celtics sign Kemba Walker, a player who is never hurt; joins Celtics and is always hurt  Kings and Grizzles picks (thought to be top 5-10 picks) turn out to be shitty #14 picks.   Everyone in the East (Philly, Brookyln, Milwaukee, Miami) get better and are in a better spot then Boston  Lakers win championship in 2020  SO TO THE BASKETBALL GODS.... GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK NOW"
"Because you have Ayton, Bridges, Saric, Crowder etc surrounding your 2 All Stars while we have a washed Kemba Walker, 15 games of Marcus Smart, and complete trash."
"I'm pretty player friendly IMO but isn't it weird that there is literally no punishment for quitting on your team? You can cripple a whole team if you're a max player who stops caring.   Consider Kemba Walker:   Scenario A: Celtics sign him to a max and they're worried about his knee so they move him after a year to the Knicks.    Scenario B: He signs a supermax with the hornets and they move him to the Knicks after a year  because they made a mistake.  He loses his supermax but still makes max.     In both scenarios, he had no choice in where he got traded and it wasn't his fault but at least he got to pocket a year of supermax. Neither the Celtics nor the Hornets signed him to trick him. But a less scrupulous player can sign the max and quit on the team with no consequences. Neither situation is perfect but the second one is way worse for fans and the league."
Kemba Walker
Kemba Walker
Just imagine having Collin Sexton on his rookie deal right now instead of Kemba Walker.  They‚Äôd probably be one decent big away from having just as good of a chance as Milwaukee or Philly rn
I just checked out KP's stats and they're not nearly as bad as I was expecting.   He's still averaging 20/8 a game while shooting. 35% from 3 after missing substantial time to a knee injury months ago. I'd be much more concerned about Kemba Walker than KP if we're talking about post-injury dudes.
"Most of my bad takes over the years have come from my insistence on making judgement calls about draft classes despite rarely watching college ball and only really looking at mock drafts and highlights. I'm a real nephew in that regard but I'll never change.   Some examples of my worst takes:  -Stanley Johnson should have gone top 3 (Side note, I did predict in that draft that Myles Turner would be a solid starter with star potential but only because I accidentally watched a Texas game one day because I was snowed into my house).   -Kemba Walker was a future GOAT and would turn the Hornets around for good. I had only watched his UConn highlights so I had no clue who he was. Obviously he turned out pretty good, but not quite what I thought   -i also thought that draft was the turning point for American's in basketball because like half of the top 10 picks were from other countries.   -The Celtics fucked up with Tatum, really though he was a bust. I just didn't like the way he spelled his first name.   -Same draft, thought DSJ was clearly going to be the best player.  Could go on like this forever lol. My draft takes are always trash, but it's fun"
Bring in a dynamic and shifty score first PG like Kemba Walker!! I think a Simmons and Walker swap works dont you guys think! Perfect I‚Äôll set it up
"To be clear, this stat measures how frequently a player has to guard different positions, not how effective they are at doing it.  Obviously NBA headcoaches aren‚Äôt going to have Kemba Walker guarding centers 20 minutes per night, so merely guarding different positions a lot shows your coach has some confidence in your versatility, but the stat doesn‚Äôt directly measure how successful players are at defending multiple positions."
"Yeah I see the baggage as mainly the Kemba contract, the cap situation (though in fairness some of that is allocated to the guys who are the other team's future), and the lack of assets to create flexibility.  As for draft capital, to me it's a matter of having made too many selections and seeing too many of those selections ultimately return 0 value. Like let's go all the way back to 2013 and the draft day when the Brooklyn trade happened.  In 2013, the C's pick Kelly Olynyk. He walks away for nothing in 2017.  In 2014, they pick Marcus Smart (indisputably a big fat W), but they also pick James Young, who flames out of the league almost immediately.  In 2015, they grab Rozier. Turns out he's a great pick, but ultimately he's dumped to get Kemba Walker, who has produced mixed results so far and will likely either leave in free agency or cost picks to move. He's followed up by RJ Hunter (out of the league), Jordan Mickey (out of the league), and Marcus Thornton (out of the league).  In 2016, the Brooklyn trade pays off in a big way and they take Jaylen Brown. Unfortunately, they hang onto the #16 and #23 pick# too long and they becomes cap casualties in the form of Yabu and Zizic as necessary draft-and-stashes who never develop into an NBA players. He does manage to turn two seconds into a Memphis 1st (from the Clippers). But that becomes the Thybulle selection in 2019 and turned into #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). Jerome returned the #30 pick in 2020, which has since been turned back into two seconds. Edwards got a guaranteed deal for no real reason and likely will be out of the league soon.  The C's then still take 3 second round picks in this draft, two of whom drop out of the league (Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil). The other was Abdel Nader, who ultimately was dumped for Rodney Purvis, who was promptly waived.  2017 is another strong start with the Tatum selection. At 37, they also get Semi, who has over-performed for being drafted that late. But will he be here long-term? Or end up as another selection who walks away for nothing? Still not sure he belongs in a real contender's rotation. We also end up taking two more guys in the second round (Kadeem Allen and Jabari Bird) who do not play NBA basketball anymore.  In 2018, the last Brooklyn pick gets shipped out for Kyrie, who will leave for nothing. I don't blame Ainge for this one as I don't think many people understood what a headcase Kyrie actually was. They also get Robert Williams in this draft, which looks great so far.  I'm going to set aside the 2019 and 2020 drafts because they are too recent. But I will say the Edwards and Waters picks are really baffling and seemed destined to fail pretty early on. Why is the team so focused on getting undersized guards?  Anyway, the team has made so many draft selections, but aside from the three home runs and Kemba, they've turned into what 2 other guys that fans can feel confident may be rotation players (Robert and Pritchard)? We've got our fingers crossed that Langford and Nesmith will join them, but who knows. Maybe Semi and Grant can contribute, but they are so inconsistent still. That's why I feel those assets were mismanaged."
"* **Marcus Smart:** the longest-tenured player on the team and emotional leader is out * **Jayson Tatum:** got COVID, has shown a lack of energy as the game goes on  * **Kemba Walker:** coming off an injury and is currently inconsistent    * **Danny Ainge:** the Celtics are one of the youngest teams in the league, hasn't/didn't traded assets for veteran win-now style players. * **Brad Stevens:** experiments with lineups all season long, at times to the detriment of regular-season wins (I guess in hopes of knowing what he can get out of matchups in the playoffs)  I have much higher expectations for this team and am definitely disappointed this season. The future still looks bright with the Celtics having key pieces locked up for the next 2-3 years on average. At the end of the day, I am grateful to have a team that is consistently competitive but I am becoming impatient watching teams like the rival Lakers winning rings."
"Nah, never going all in for AD or Harden was the right decision. No guarantee that AD stays or that Harden turns the presently constructed team into championship contenders. The problems arguably started with trading IT and depth for Kyrie (which I can‚Äôt really hold against him) as well as letting rozier walk and signing Kemba Walker. Rozier would‚Äôve been a cheaper contract, allowed them to sign more depth, and fit in with the Jays timeline whereas Kemba is not playing near max level, is a negative on the defensive end, and has a contract that caused the rest of the team to be rookies or MLE level players."
Reminds me of that Celtics Spurs game a few seasons back and Kemba Walker (I believe) was thrown out of the game by the ref. Two consecutive T‚Äôs. One Celtics fan threw something on to the court and got arrested.  As a Spurs fan I thought that was just MALARKEY.

"Fuck Kemba Walker. Clown needs to stop shooting and find his role on this team  He already got paid, he‚Äôs not gonna live up to contract, that‚Äôs fine. At least try and help the team win"
brad stevens drawing up the last shot for kemba ‚Äú1-11 from 3‚Äù walker
Kemba Walker tonight:  18 Claps 26 Smiles 53 Celebrations 23.8% FG 8.3% 3P  Better than Lowry? Better than My nan? üî•üî•
"I am sure you‚Äôd find some guy at a Cavs game with Sexton and LeBron in the same photo. Nobody on this planet thinks that Kemba Walker is a better basketball player than Kyrie, just stop."
Kemba walker needs be a drug dealer with all them bricks
"Brutal game by Kemba Walker. Rarely does one player lose a game, but his second half and OT was awful considering his place in the NBA.  Tatum and Brown should be pissed."

Kemba walker is horrible

"Kemba ""Chuck Norris"" Walker ""Texas Ranger"" dgaf what you want."
Kemba Walker is just Trae Young from wish
When your offense has just become Kemba Walker isos this is fuckin bound to happen lol
Totally outplaying Kemba Walker this year.
"Kyrie deal: seemed fine on paper but Kyrie would get injured year one, choke year two and leave. Celtics end up giving up solid role player Jae Crowder and what would be dolin Sexton up for basically nothing. Great trade for them that just completely backfires  Rozier Kemba swap: Kyrie leaves you for the nets and Roziers in line for a pay day, what do you do, go get the clear upgrade and allstar kemba Walker. Now Walker has injury issues, and has been pretty bad while Rozier has blossomed into a better player than kemba and a star on the Hornets with a much cheaper contract. Meanwhile kemba now has one of the worst unreadable contracts making it even harder to get a better talent  Two obvious trades both backfire"
Kemba Walker
"I've watched less of him so maybe you're right, but in general I just don't believe in undersized point guards (I've been watching the celtics trot out IT and Kemba Walker and seen the negatives that come with them).  It is unprecedented for a small guard to lead a team to a championship.  the closest comp is Curry, but Curry is bigger, more athletic, and just all around better than Trae.  Chris Paul also comes to mind, but he is longer and more athletic and one of the best defensive guard ever - and he hasn't ever won anything, primarily due to injuries (and I think being an undersized guard, you're more likely to get injured).  on top of all that, while he is truly a prolific passer, he also seems to have a habit of making some bad/lazy plays.  I do think he will continue to improve and maybe cut the bad turnovers out of his game, but the rest of my points still stand.  so yes, he's a great offensive talent, but I would not want to build my team around him.  I would rather have a less talented but bigger 2-way player."
"It was a large deal. Collins, OG, Jarrett Allen and Kemba Walker for Murray, JV, Conley, and Plumlee. So far, I‚Äôve gotten the better end of the deal haha."
"Nobody was hyped up last year with the poorly built roster around Embiid and Simmons. None of us expected the Sixers to go far. Also, Kemba Walker has been the 3rd leading scorer at best ever since he stepped foot in Boston, so that‚Äôs wrong. Two years ago if the Kawhi shot doesn‚Äôt have like 6 lucky bounces, we would have the chip easily. Nuggets haven‚Äôt won anything in years either you can‚Äôt exactly get all cocky here when making the playoffs argument."
‚ÄúThe Process‚Äù has been going on for like 5 years when are we going to see the result? Last year you guys were so hyped up and lost to the Kemba Walker led Celtics lmao get out of hereüòÇ. One thing you do not want to get into is playoffs because that‚Äôs truly when the gap between players gets larger.
HERE COMES KEMBA WALKER
In response to point A:  Top Selling NBA Jerseys (Jan 2020-Oct 2020)  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. Jayson Tatum 8.

"I don‚Äôt see how you can say the Celtics future isn‚Äôt bright because of a declining Kemba Walker when his contract will be off the books in two years and that last year sometimes a large expiring contract can be leveraged into semi decent assets. Not only that but the Celtics future is with Tatum , Brown , and Smart. It‚Äôs a disappointing season so far , but I‚Äôm still hopeful of the outlook.  Edit: Kemba Walker can still also be a positive impact on the court and he has been rounding into shape. Unrelated , he‚Äôs  a great locker room guy also"
"We're pretty close to it.   * The only team in the league with 2 all-stars under 25 (and they're both wings) * The 5th youngest roster in the league * All our own draft capital *  28.5m TPE * Marcus Smart + Kemba Walker * We can clear our cap space if we want, right as high-end FAs hit the market (Embiid, Jokic, Beal, etc)  We're incredibly well-positioned for the future.   A lot of the teams ahead in standings aren't better positioned than that. *eg. Denver has a bright future and have played better this season, but I'd take Boston's future comfortably.*"
"&gt; Aren‚Äôt good enough to make a conference finals.. crazy.. and who knows when they will be good enough.  This same squad make the conference finals last year, and that's without Hayward for most of the playoffs. If this team can ever get healthy, they'll be a contender for the 2nd best team in the east. Though even if healthy, BK is going to streamroll them and everyone else in the east.   &gt; They should have paid Terry tho.... I wonder where they go from here.   Hindsight. Terry wanted out/wanted a larger role, and that contract was universally clowned when it was given out. Good on him for turning it around and proving people wrong.   &gt; Brooklyn and Philly will be powerhouses for the next few years, plus Milwaukee will be an issue too.  Out of those 3, only team that Boston probably has no shot at beating is BK.   &gt; With an ageing and what looks like declining Kemba Walker, not much depth and a lack of inside presence the future for Boston isn‚Äôt bright  Considering we have two top 20 players, both of whom are in their early 20s, and are locked up for the next 4ish years, things are actually looking pretty bright for boston."
"There‚Äôs the slightest chance for like a Kemba Walker and draft compensation for Bradley Beal, but I doubt it."
The Celtics also need his specific skill set and the gravity he provides. Someone like John wall just doesn‚Äôt help them as much as 75% of what Kemba Walker was. So yeah agreed the only real solution is roll the dice and hope he can get back to relatively reasonable form. It‚Äôs a gamble with the health but I don‚Äôt think a magically better option is appearing

[Highlight] Payton Pritchard inbounds the ball to kemba walker after a made free throw
Mans got kemba walker on his team im dead
"Lot here firstly on Justise Winslow I think there a few issues   1) There was a time I was also once really high on Winslow but I think that ship has set sail. Injuries are a big issue. But beyond that his skill set really is much more a 6th man/3rd wing off the bench type. Needs the ball in his hands to really have an impact. Nobody guards him on the perimeter. And for a wing he's actually quite bad finishing at the rim. Also his playmaking is good for a wing but relative to guards its nothing crazy I dont think he's a better playmaker than Marcus Smart who youre right you dont want him being the best playmaker on your team.   2)   &gt;Barnes is your Jeff Green-type small-ball 5.   Honestly I think Jaylen Brown is probably bulkier and better at guarding bigger guys. He's closer to a small ball 5 to me. But Brad has never really shown much desire even last year when his 5 best players were Jaylen/Hayward/Tatum/Kemba/Smart to go small like that. Just not who he really is. As a changeup to close games late you can do it once in a while but I think Brad tends to like having a C and traditional rim protector for how he structures his defense.   3)   &gt;Tatum is honestly this odd blend of Harden/KD where he's not as good as either of them at their strengths.  I've comp'd Tatum to pre injury Grant Hill in the past, not sure I see Harden beyond the step back 3s element can see Durant some. I agree his playmaking isnt there to be a no 1 guy yet but there's also consistent gradual improvement with it. Beyond that though in terms of potential improvement, [Ive monitored this for years with him](http://nbashotcharts.com/zoned?id=-5546440) there's a big gap in his %s on shots outside the paint from the left vs right side of the court. Like 45% vs 36% for his career I havent seen a split like it over a large sample size before. And I dont have a good explanation for it. But alot of those difficult jumpers he takes, it really just comes down to whether he's on the left vs right side of the court in terms of whether they are good shots. And Im surprised tbh I havent really seen teams in the playoffs gameplan around this directional tendency.   4)  &gt;I'm treating Kemba as if he's closer to the player he is now as opposed to the player he used to be, and if that's really the case like I think it is, the Celtics are fucked.  Yeah....so this is tough. The gravity he provides coming off pick and rolls is really important to this offense its part of why for this team to reach its ceiling he needs to be out there and Im not necessarily in favor of trying to build lineups without him for key stretches in the playoffs he's too important/unique. But that said I agree with you physically he's not gonna get better with age. Was talking about this with a celtics fan I know last week ultimately we both kind of concluded if your Boston you kind of just have to hope you get lucky and Kemba turns it around and becomes 80% of what he was last yr. Are the odds of it happening great no but I think it's the only way they end up having a high enough ceiling to really contend at the top level potentially. I just think you are capping your ceiling too much putting in someone like Justise Winslow instead of him.   &gt;a guard who is great on offense but bad on defense is worth it, like can you win at the highest level with Kemba Walker as your point guard defensively?   Depends on specifics if its an Isaiah Thomas level defender this becomes an issue. But for someone like Kemba who I think is just a generic poor defender not some absolute disaster yes I do think you can win with that. I think  GSW wouldve been fine if Steph was a worse defender. San Antonio won with Tony Parker. The Celtics defensive rating when Kemba was on the court vs Toronto was 100. Vs Miami it was 112-113 is that great no but the Lakers beat Denver in 5 games with a 113 defensive rating in today's NBA its not a death sentence.   One thing Ive noticed over the years is that teams can excessively hunt a weaker guard to their own detriment. You get out of your own offense too much and there's an elements of fools gold with it you stagnate your offense too much worrying too much about trying to go at that one defender. It's part of why to me the most detrimental guard defenders to have aren't necessarily the small ones who can be overpowered 1 v1 its the ones who are horrible with help defense, give no effort and are lost off ball. Those are the ones who hurt you the most to me, it's why Im not surprised guys like Bradley Beal end up at the bottom of defensive metrics every year.   &gt;John Collins would be nice, but I don't see him getting moved. Thad Young  Yeah I was gonna bring up Thad also that's a good one he can let you downsize the way you were referring to earlier also. I actually do think JC does get moved before the summer it's just how much do you give up. Atl probably really pushes for Marcus Smart I tend to lean against doing that if Boston ultimately"
"Ben Simmons is 13-0 against Kemba Walker, so him"
"I'm saying for this season, I'll say Tatum and Zion are on a similar level, so is brown and Ingram. Kemba has been hurt and inconsistent this year while lonzo has been having a career year. The celtics have no depth while the pelicans have bledsoe, Hart, Adams, and Walker. These two teams have comparable talent for this season."
Kemba Walker? He plays point guard for you guys
"You signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker all within like 3-4 years. That‚Äôs better than like 90% of the league could do."
They had no first round picks and no talent cause of that shitshow with billy king. Within 4 years they had been a playoff team 2 years in a row and put together a good supporting cast while still having 2 max slots open as well. I guess we‚Äôre both biased. You‚Äôre looking at it from the most pessimistic view countering my point by saying bkn didn‚Äôt have a good enough roster to have any max level players. I‚Äôm looking at it like they were financially saavy and didn‚Äôt make a dumb move like maxing Dlo or someone like kemba Walker all while being able to offer a good supporting cast.
"&gt;- The Celtics have the 6th highest payroll in the NBA next season, not including a new deal for free agent Evan Fournier    So... why does this mean a bleak future?   &gt;- Kemba Walker has one of the worst contracts in the league    There's only 1+1 left and he averaged 19, 4 &amp; 5 this year, after starting really slow from injury.   &gt;- Most of their young players like Grant Williams and Romeo Langford have disappointed    Tatum, Brown, Williams, Pritchard, Nesmith haven't disappointed   &gt;- They own no future first round picks from other teams    So... they don't owe anyone any picks. Why is it bleak to not own other teams picks?   &gt;- Marcus Smart will likely have to be traded this summer or else the Celtics tax bill will be massive. And if they don't trade him, they certainly will not be able to sign him to a big new deal next summer when his contract ends.    Why can't they pay him? Why does he have to be traded?   Also, if he's traded then it won't be for nothing. They will get value in return."
"Kemba Walker, LaMelo already up there though"
I'd say Kemba Walker is on that list

"He was awful for a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù player  against the Celtics and Raptors. Legit got relegated to playing the 4 bc he couldn‚Äôt run the point in the half court because he can‚Äôt shoot.   Now If you consider guys like Oladipo or Kemba Walker as great then I agree Simmons is in that tier. Those guys also have all nba teams and all star appearances. I don‚Äôt consider them great though, I think it saturates the term. There are maybe 10ish great players in the league."
"By that logic Simmons is great, but that also means like 30-40 players in the nba are great. Guys like Kemba Walker."
"1 all nba 3rd team doesn‚Äôt make you great my guy lol.   Guys like Kemba Walker, Oladipo , al Jefferson , deandre Jordan, Dragiƒá etc have all made all nba 3rd team and all star games. I don‚Äôt consider them great or elite. They‚Äôre good players but that‚Äôs about it, same with Ben Simmons.   Again this comes down to how you define great lol."

"Skill boost: Rob Williams. All the physical tools are there and then some, if he had a jump shot and some polish to his game it'd be over for the league.  Height boost: Kemba Walker. Pretty self-explanatory, the guy's height is an issue on both ends.   Athleticism boost: Marcus Smart. Yeah, he's already insanely strong for his size, but he's not especially explosive for an NBA point guard. If he were able to power to the rim like Westbrook, even if it's not quite on *that* level, you'd have one of the best two-way guards in the league even with his streaky jump shot."
Kemba walker is dogshit
Guarding an undersized Kemba Walker coming of a major injury troubles is not something that will place him above other great defenders in the league.
"Doesn‚Äôt change my point, bud. The cap will go up by more than 2 million dollars next year, which will put them under the limit, and from that point they can add a few guys to make the move work if they want to. Not to mention the fact that sign and traded exist, which is another avenue that could be explored. They have enough financial freedom to make the move work if they want to, which is besides my entire original point anyway that at least one team in the league would want to trade for Kemba Walker. You couldn‚Äôt argue that point effectively so you had to devolve this conversation into talking about specifically the Lakers cap space. Even if I was off about the Lakers, which I‚Äôm not, there are at least 10 other teams who would be feasibly interested enough and have the ability to make such a move work."

"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  2018-2019 was the high point with that stocked roster. But, Kyrie's headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. There was also the issue of too many mouths to feed with people like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier wanting their touches.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. Kemba is a bad contract, the Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and while Theis massively outperformed his contract they traded him at the deadline just to get under the tax. That being said, this can all be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better / more draft assets.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. I get that it's been a rough season but the dude is looking like Kris Dunn right now. Bust potential"
Kyrie Is a bum no better than Kemba Walker
"FYI Kemba didn't leave Charlotte for nothing, they did an S&amp;T to get back a younger talent in Rozier (arguably outperforming Walker this season). The Kawhi example is not even relevant for this, his camp told the Raps from the beginning he was a 1yr rental.  Under the new CBA , there have been way more examples of franchise stars saying they want out and the organization figures out a way to get something for them."

"&gt;It does not matter. KD and Kyrie will treat any one on one defender the same. I don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt understand this yet.  &gt;They have too many weapons to be throwing doubles around willy nilly all while having arguably the three best iso scorers in the game.   Nope. Jrue Holiday is arguably the best one on one defender in the league. Massive difference between him and say...Kemba Walker.  &gt;And also, Giannis doesn‚Äôt guard KD. That‚Äôs usually Khris Middleton.  Not this season. KD plays the 4 now. Giannis has and will guard him."
"Thank you.  Isiah Thomas - Kyrie Irving - Kemba Walker  All high usage, negligible playmaking, zero Defense undersized PGs whom the NBA has already moved on from and can no longer be the Center piece in an elite team.  Starting to think Ainge is overcompensating for being the forgotten member on the 86 Celtics."
"I started watching games again a couple of weeks ago, for the first time since 2012. The Bucks and 76ers have impressed me the most so far, but the teams that I have found most fun to watch have been Hornets, Heat, Clippers, Suns and Celtics. I'm also excited about seeing the Hawks with Trae Young when he gets back. The players who have impressed/surprised me the most so far are Jrue Holiday, Miles Bridges, Maxey, Rondo and Kemba Walker. I kinda want to pick a team as well, but I don't think I can tbh"
"It feels like you‚Äôre arguing more against some imagined position where I‚Äôm saying all of these guys are trash (obviously, they aren‚Äôt) than the original assertion that it was a temporary lull in top-level talent in the league.  I even call out that that there were plenty of all time greats who played at this time, just that they were pretty clearly on the wrong side of their aging curve (either too early or too late).   Like, Kobe was simply not as good in his 30s as he was in his 20s. In his final two postseasons his efficiency fell off a cliff compared to the two championship runs before that.  2012-2013 was better but also, self-evidently, unsustainable.    You actually seem to agree with me that the big men I mentioned are better than Dwight so I‚Äôm not sure what needs to be said there.  My very hot take is that a smart team in 2021 would use Dwight almost exactly like Gobert is used today.  The idea that Dwight was actually a pretty good offensive player is mostly revisionist history; he was an all time great lob finisher and offensive rebounder, but never better than mediocre in the post (and his demand to get post touches hurt every team he played on).  He is, inarguably, much, much worse on offense than any of the players I mentioned.   And come on, we both know that all the players I listed are much better than any of Love, Griffin, Bosh, Rondo, Aldridge, Parker, etc. It‚Äôs become fashionable to acknowledge how ahead of his time Bosh was but the guy made one all-NBA team in his whole career.  He was a fringe top 15 player in his own era, which makes it look even worse when we see some of the other players who snuck onto all-NBA teams during this time. The most useful thing he adds to this discussion is to show exactly how overrated Kevin Love was in comparison.   You certainly can try to apply a similar argument to eg Kemba Walker but there are just a lot less of those examples now than there were before.  Even if you go past the 10 players I mentioned you still have guys like Lillard, Irving, Butler, Tatum, Zion, Paul George, Gobert, Beal, etc. Most of these guys aren‚Äôt even going to sniff an all-NBA team this year but they would have been shoo-ins for a 3rd team spot or better in basically any of the aforementioned years."
"Oh no, we lost to the thunder while missing our best player Jayson Tatum, a massively important Kemba Walker, and the 3rd most impactful player behind only Jokic and Embiid Timelord."
Kemba Walker
And Gordon Hayward as well. And probably Kemba Walker in a few seasons too.   Maybe the Celtics just gotta stop signing max free agents.
That‚Äôs really a good diagnosis of the franchise. Greatest player of all time Kemba Walker. Who by no means is a bad player. Just a good starting player. Yikes.
"Rozier (and, uh, Wannamaker, I guess) as well as the Greatest Hornet of All Time in Kemba Walker facing his former team."
"&gt;they lose to bad teams at full strength.  How many times would you say we've been at full strength?  We've had 18 games this season with our core 4 (Tatum, Brown, Smart, Walker) playing.  About half of those games have involved guys coming back from major injuries and all of those games have involved us missing other rotation players.   We had 1 game where:  * Tatum had just come back from covid * Kemba had just come back from his knee procedure * Brown was about a week away from missing time to tendonitis * Smart sprained his calf (it looked like he tore his Achilles) * Pritchard was out with an MCL injury  Would that count as losing at full strength?"
Darius Garland + Collin Sexton &gt;&gt;&gt; Kemba Walker + Marcus Smart
"&gt; Nets missing KD/Harden   Jaylen Brown,Kemba Walker, Robert Williams III did not play that game"
Kemba walker for smiling
KD shimmy before every free throw.  Trae Young hop after every lob.  Giannis mean mug after every poster.  Curry with the mouth guard chewing.  Lebron with looking down at the ball before every 3pt attempt.  Kemba Walker smile after losing his team the game
"This is what a clown take looks like "" Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. "" like huh wtf u even talking about."
"Embiid is good, but the players you have around him in that scenario aren't as good as the Jazz. I just think Luka would feast, although I feel he'd kinda overlap with Mitchell. Luka would probably play the point in that scenario, though.  Each player on that Jazz team is a threat. Kemba Walker, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart aren't threats like Bogdanovic and Gobert are. Gobert's defense alone can win the Jazz games.  Utah is also just far too deep. Evan Fournier doesn't come close to Jordan Clarkson, in my opinion. Clarkson just fits that system they've got going on perfectly."
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That‚Äôs 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
Someone once tried to argue with me that Kemba Walker in his prime was a better player than KAT lol
"No, the point he's arguing is that Kemba has dramatically declined this season. That isn't statistically supported when you compare his stats from last year to his stats from this year. Different coach, different system, different role, different shot profile.

Kemba Walker? More like Kemba Charger am I right
"as far as i'm concerned, Kemba Walker is the only person who played basketball today"
Kemba ‚Äúneeds no‚Äù Walker?
"They really forgot about Kemba Walker.  Quality, defining win for the C's"
"Kemba Antoine Walker woke up and chose violence today, I see"
We are losing to 2021 Kemba walker.. that‚Äôs just unfortunate
"I don‚Äôt understand you. THT is not trash LOL. Just under development. He‚Äôs exactly where Lonzo and Bi were a few years ago and those are big names now. CJ is always hurt. He‚Äôs not a star player and he‚Äôs obviously hitting the end of his peak. He‚Äôs more in the above average category in everything but shooting. Klay would come before him. So would the number 2 in Milwaukee. Hell he‚Äôs on the far end of the list of top players. Has he averaged over 20 a game yet? You are selling him like he‚Äôs a former all star or something lol. He doesn‚Äôt lead the league in anything. He‚Äôs more on your team than he might be on any other team. Kinda like a Kemba Walker or Jalen Brown type. But I believe Brown has been an all star. I don‚Äôt know if CJ would be the same player If dame wasn‚Äôt his best friend. I could see him out the league already if he was drafted to another small market team. But hey, I‚Äôm not a GM. What do I know. All I‚Äôm saying is THT got the makings of a franchise player / cornerstone. CJ is at his peak probably."
It's not about heliocentrism. Kyrie can get his own bucket for sure but is a sub par playmaker. KD when he gets his own bucket his efficiency craters. Going from one of the most efficient scorer in nba history to just good levels like 58% TS compared to 62-65%.  The whole reason the clippers failed is because they don't have true pg who can get buckets for others. They recognised that which is why they traded lou will for rondo. Tor in 2019 had Kyle Lowry who is an elite playmaker that year especially (wasn't he 3rd in assists that year). Milwaukee absolutely run a heliocentric system in years past. They have reduced it this season but they have struggled to capitalise on the pressure that Giannis causes defence because no one finds those holes (and to a certain extent when they did they shot like 20% from 3). Boston have been pretty ass this year and their recent winning run has coincided with Kemba walker taking a back seat on his scoring and focusing on facilitating and getting Marcus smart their best playmaker back.  Lack of playmaking is almost always the downfall of teams. And without Harden they have a dearth of it. Maybe dinwiddie coming back will fix thatb(if he is actually fit). That plus I don't trust KD and Kyrie in terms of health and sacrificing for the team in the post season then if the meet someone decent in the 2nd round it will be very tough for them.
it's like asking to pick between Steph Curry or Kemba Walker
"Celtics needed this win and it looks like it got in their heads a little bit, but honestly the lack of bench shooting is way too big a hole for a legit playoff team to overcome. Nesmith is still too raw, and as a Knicks fan trust me when I say Luke Kornet is not the answer (how has he not retired?).  I don't buy in to the narrative that the Jays can't play together because they are too similar (I think that when you have two players with that much talent you just work hard and make it happen), but I do think they would be better served with George Hill than Kemba Walker at this point. I love Kemba but the team can't benefit from his handling and shooting with so few spot up guys around him. Having a better defender and rebounder at that position would be worth the offensive downgrade at this point.  I feel that Boston lacks an identity, which is unusual given their pedigree, Steven's apparent quality as a head coach, and their recent success. Is this team a slashing/cutting team? An offensive rebounding team? Is it a team that scores so efficiently you can't keep up? I don't see how the iso-heavy style becomes a workable game plan in the playoffs unless you truly believe Tatum can 1v1 his way to the ECF.  The Bulls, on the other hand, have a group I really respect defensively and came to play with Lavine hurt. Given Vuc led the team to a win 2 out of 3 without Zach around, and the team struggles with both on the court, it's pretty clear that the Lavine-Vucevic chemistry isn't quite there yet. But hopefully next season they can figure out a two man game that works because they clearly both have the talent. If so, the defense provided by Young, William, and Temple should provide enough well-roundedness to get them into the play in next year. Some upgrades to the bench in the draft and free agency will be necessary to achieve that, but in the playoffs you only need the top 8 guys the Bulls have already.  If Markkanen isn't starting right now, it may be time to trade him before his value declines too much. His skillset is valued around the league and the Bulls have enough players to try to actively build rather than develop. They need a little bit of everything, so it's hard to trade a guy with a decent ceiling, but I personally would rather sell high and try to upgrade my bench scoring and ball handling,"
Kemba Walker
"Kemba ""Kardiac"" Walker, Carmelo Anthony"
"&gt;A semi-decent team missing Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, Evan Fournier, Timelord  That‚Äôs 4 of our top 6 players."
"I think almost all young guys besides Luka and Trae have to improve as a playmaker and reading defenses. Donovan Mitchells started doing it and he's in the top 10 for MVP. And hard agree on all the Fournier takes. Hes got a little French in his game and reads the floor well, like Diaw and Batum. Was a stud in the Olympics a while back.   My main critique of the Celtics FO is the Walker acquisition. He is not a player who fits in that system. He was all iso and pnr in Charlotte, who had some ungodly low number of his field goals being assisted. Kinda weird but a Terry Rozier or a Tomas Satoransky is who they need in that slot. a combo guard who can be a secondary creator but is also a deadly floor spacer and defender. Not a pure scoring point like Kemba. Having Smart at the 2 compounds this even more imo because he's not a bad initiator but can't space for Kemba and he's a ball stopper sometimes (though he makes the right passes a decent bit too)."
"Kemba ""kardiac"" Walker"
"&gt; First loss, we had no kemba, smart, or theis. Jaylen brown played point guard in a lineup with Tatum (struggling with coming back from covid), Javonte Greene, Semi Ojeleye, and Tristan Thompson. We played against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela and still only lost by 8.   Fair, but we were missing Hunter and Bogi - two starters. You can argue Smart/Walker are more important sure.    &gt; Next loss was the second game of a back to back on the road having played four games in six days. You were also coming off a back to back but hadn‚Äôt had such a condensed schedule. We had just played the Mavericks and you had just played the Cavs. Tatum was having fatigue issues and scored 13 points on 4/20 which I doubt will happen when we play you again.    This is honestly just kind of excuses. That's literally your schedule   &gt; we had Kemba who scored 28 points on 62.5/62.5/100 which would have made him the highest scoring player in either of the two losses.   This is literally not even true: Trae had 40 and Tatum had 35 in the first game. Trae had 31 in our loss. Trae had 33 in the 3rd game and Gallo had 38"
Jayson Tatum to the ECF.  Embiid missing half the season.  Jeff Teague floaters.  Lowry taking charges; Kemba Walker taking charges.  Zion dunking from outside the restricted area.
"&gt;Ok? Doesn't that make it even more impressive that Kobe who had another guy taking so many possessions put up similar or better stats than a guy who's been the first option since his 2nd year.   Not when you look at how Shaq was guarded which allowed for Kobe to cook.    &gt;Even then Tatum has had Kyrie, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Jalen Brown and Al horford. Don't pretend that Tatum didn't have help at all. Which is a dumb argument regardless Tatum better despite the stats because kobe had Shaq  I would say you're argument for Kobe that you made in the first paragraph applies here more. Tatum had multiple players gunning for his shots. I won't say he's better but he's doing very well. We'll see how he stacks up with Kobe at the end."

Ben Simmons has never lost to Kemba Walker
"I believe he means insert almost any player in the league on a max and its bad and on a min its good. Most players aren't on a max so it can still apply with all maxes being good.    Even then a ton of max players being number 1 would be really bad. Most teams with 2nd and 3rd max players are competing for the title and pay them to have the talent. Guys like Tobias Harris, Kemba Walker, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton, Blake Griffin(idk how his contract actually works out right now), Russ, Wall, Lowry, Wiggins, KP, McCollum, and even guys a tier above that such as PG, Conley, and AD. If they are maxed and the number one option your team is wasting money unless they use these signing to attract other stars who are better."
"&gt;if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  what are you talking about? what stat did i use that has that? ts% certainly does not.  and we're not talking about whether or not he can be good or has any potential, i've never claimed that he doesn't, we're comparing him to the players above him who are on the list. scoring efficiency is not the end-all be-all, but when your game is predicated mostly on only being a scorer, it's something important we need to look at.  mikal bridges is a 41% three point shooter with 64%ts, literally one of the most efficient scorers in the entire league and will probably make an all-defensive team this year  john collins scored 21 on 65% ts last season, miles and miles ahead of RJ as a scorer.   deandre ayton an elite rebounder, anchor of one of the best defenses in the league while scoring 15 per game on 62% from the floor  deandre hunter again an elite defender already with 62%ts  lonzo is a much better defender and a better distributor, while being  more efficient.  RJ giving you 17 points on 15 shots just isn't that impressive in comparison considering what else he brings. he could develop into a great player and recently has been looking much better, but you're acting like a spot on this list is owed to him when he hasn't proven anything really in comparison to guys who made it onto the list. he might have a case for an honorable mention or an argument for the last spot on the list, but to act like he's some crazy snub and deserves to be on over the guys you listed is legitimately just a stupid opinion that makes it look like you already were a fan of his and saw ppg and thought that's the only thing that matters."
"if your going to determine a young player potential on a stat that has Jordan Clarkson, kemba Walker, Danillo Galinari as is best 3 players, than I dont think you understand how player development works.  Being able to hit the three opens up the rest of your game. Hes been extremly accurate from three as of late Im not gonna penalize his potential because hes not shooting 6-8 threes a game  You keep talking about his fg% so I looked at it  **Heres three wing/foward players relatively similar to RJ and were drafted in the same spot at RJ:**  Jayson tatum second year: 45%  Bradley Beal second year: 41%  Jaylen Brown at second year: 46%  **Now lets look at Rjs most common player comps that i¬¥ve seen: Im sure there are others but I dont see many player comps for RJ**  Jimmy Butler at sceond year: 47%  Demar Derozan at second year: 47%  Im not saying hes any of those players but the numbers are pretty similar and on top of that he also brings good defense to his team.   **Heres some more wings/fowards  in case you think im just cherry picking**  Brandon Ingram(#2 overall) second year: 47%  Luka Doncic (3rd overall) second year: 46% Luka and RJ aren¬¥t nearly on the same level and im not trying to compare them. Just showing different wings   Devin Booker (#13 overall) 42% (shitty comparison as well but also somewhat fits the requirements of this list)  What im trying to say is harping on efficiency splits for a 20 year old wing isnt the way to go"

"Yeah, the only player today whose college resume could potentially affect his HOF candidacy is probably Kemba Walker because he had such a legendary run through the tournament, so if he can somehow bounce back and make a couple more All-Star teams to get himself into the borderline discussion, that championship run could push him over the top.   It likely won‚Äôt matter, though, given how far he seems to have fallen off recently."

He passed the torch to Mr. Smiley Kemba Walker
when was the last time Ben Simmons lost to Kemba Walker?
Ah Ben simmons vs Kemba Walker. The REAL matchup that absolutely noone talks about or cares about
"Any other centres who get described in this way? I only ever hear people say ""he can bang down low"" when it's Tristan Thompson. Never anyone else.  Like has anyone said that Zion can bang down low? Embiid can bang down low? Kemba walker can't bang down low?"
D wade looks like a fatter kemba Walker
"Yeah I mean, Brown was 6/10 and shot well from three. We just denied him the ball (especially Thybulle), and obviously we were ok with Tatum making tough shots over Ben. But we always sent extra help to your stars and let the other guys take open shots.   I always feel like you guys shoot well against us even in this season's sweep. Even the guy who people think is cooked, Kemba Walker, always comes around screens and laces threes with ease against us."
"the weirdest part of this is knowing that even though Kemba Walker is playing like Shabazz Napier, somehow he is going to opt out after next season and somehow we'll still be sad about it."
"I think non-casual basketball fans know KAT is a beast, generational big man, shoots 3s and at 50/40/90 but I HAVE seen casual fans arguing Kemba Walker was on the same tier as KAT"
I like Kemba Walker but I really feel like he‚Äôs becoming this generation‚Äôs Rod Strickland and Kenny Anderson. Like...he‚Äôs underperforming to his potential but will be appreciated anecdotally after his playing day‚Äôs over.
"Kemba ""not the Texas ranger"" walker"
"Kemba ""Talker but can't"" Walker"
"Losing Hayward really hurt them because he was their best playmaker and someone who always made the right play (when healthy).  Now their only good playmaker is Smart, and he's missed time and isn't enough on his own. Brown, Tatum and Walker aren't really playmakers or particularly it passers.   On top of it, Kemba is hurt and isn't getting to the rim anymore or shooting well. And they've missed a shit ton of games to COVID-19.  Tristan Thompson has sucked. The young guys aren't good or aren't playing (at least not yet).  It's basically the perfect storm of total shit."

Kemba Walker sucks vs both LeBron and 2011 Finals LeBron
Dame treated this like it was a playoff game.  Glorified Kemba Walker.
Def Kemba deserves to be there. Kind of reminds me of AI back in the day killing people like every game but the sixers would still lose. I think Walker should be a first or second option too more than a second or third like he's been used in Boston thus far.
"Only 16% of Jaylen Browns shots come from mid range 2s, and he shoots them at a great clip. His shot selection has literally nothing to do with the Celtics offensive struggles.   The Celtics struggles come mainly from the ISO heavy offense they play. And before you try and put the blame on the Celtics current personnel, here's the Celtics rank in the NBA in ISO possessions per game   2021 - 7th  2020 - 8th   2019 - 8th   2018 - 7th   Doesn't matter if we have Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kemba Walker, or the Jays. The Celtics have been an ISO heavy team for years, and the only common denominator is Brad Stevens."
How many shocking losing streaks is Kemba Walker a part of? Has he beaten Lebron yet or nah?
"Kemba ""The New York Knicks"" Walker"
Kemba Walker is Kyle Lowry if Kyle Lowry was bad at basketball
Reminder that Ben Simmons has never lost to Kemba Walker
Kemba Walker always leaves me wanting more these days. Why did he have to have such a strong start to last season to give me such high expectations.....

"A fun, inter-squad scrimmage for the Horn-tics with Terry Rozier, Kemba Walker and Brad Wanamaker, too bad Gordon couldn't make it, get well dude!"
"&gt;Trae Young is the best PG in the draft, leading all draft-eligible players in FPG and second in FPM. However, he struggled down the stretch and his defense and turnover numbers leave a lot to be desired. His ceiling projects as more of a second tier PG at the next level ‚Äì more Kemba Walker than Chris Paul.  I had him in the top tier in that draft, which consisted of 4 players: Trae, Luka, MPJ, and JJJ.  &gt;I think many people will be shocked to see De‚ÄôAndre Hunter listed as one of the least safe players in the draft. It basically comes down to how you feel about his defense. Hunter is routinely listed as an elite defender, and he in fact won ACC Defender of the Year. But on tape, he‚Äôs just brutally bad. His 1.2% STL this year puts him in the Devin Booker range as a defender. His off-ball defense alternates between lazy and lost. His sense of spacing and angles is pretty much non-existent. His on-ball defense was okay but was largely helped by Virginia‚Äôs pack line. I just don‚Äôt see it. Maybe he‚Äôs the elite defender everybody seems to think he is, and if he is, he‚Äôs a valuable player. His offense is rudimentary but more than functional for a defensive specialist. But it‚Äôs nowhere near good enough if his defense is as bad as the stats and tape look. I think betting on Hunter to become the first player in recent memory to be an above average defender with a STL% that low is a bad bet.  I had him in tier 4 in that draft, which was post-lottery first round pick. Haven't gotten to watch him this year. Just took a quick glance at his numbers, but other than unsustainable shooting from mid-range (that will regress whenever he comes back), I don't see anything that really stands out."
'really isn't as good as players like...Kemba Walker'  \-Doesn't watch basketball
"Kemba walker. This sub was saying that it‚Äôs a toss-up whether they‚Äôd take Kemba or Kyrie. Ppl were saying he was top 5 player in the league at one point. That‚Äôs just crazy to me. Kyrie has better handles, is a better defender, is a better shooter, and can finish better. Basically he‚Äôs better in every aspect apart from maybe locker room presence. Kemba is a great player but it‚Äôs not even close in my eyes between him and Kyrie."
"Argentina beat USA with a team that had basically no NBA players in 2019. I'm not sure how many players exactly in their team is in Euroleague now but I'm sure it'll be somewhat competitive. For reference here's the team USA squad that year  &gt; The official 2019 USA World Cup Team includes 2016 Olympic gold medalist¬†**Harrison Barnes**¬†(Sacramento Kings);¬†**Jaylen Brown**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Joe Harris**¬†(Brooklyn Nets);¬†**Brook Lopez**¬†(Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Khris Middleton** (Milwaukee Bucks);¬†**Donovan Mitchell**¬†(Utah Jazz); 2014 World Cup gold medalist¬†**Mason Plumlee**¬†(Denver Nuggets),¬†**Marcus Smart**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Jayson Tatum**¬†(Boston Celtics);¬†**Myles Turner**¬†(Indiana Pacers);¬†**Kemba Walker**¬†(Boston Celtics); and¬†**Derrick White**¬†(San Antonio Spurs).   Not great, but still respectable. If we are going by the worst of the NBA, e.g. Rockets, I think that Euro will win."
When Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making max money than yeah it‚Äôs a pretty dumb take
"Me and my friends recently started a podcast where we discuss what's going on in the NBA. Most recently we discuss whether some players are overhated, underrated or ranked correctly. Also released specific videos on [Kemba Walker,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAvxPapIX8k) [Paul George](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrfmf7LXA00&amp;t=4s), [Westbrook&amp;Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP9JJBblam4). With the full video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJRrGfDgJfU). We're all from Nairobi, Kenya so our accents may be a bit unique."
Shabazz Napier   Kemba Walker   Jeremy Lamb
The universe gave Celtics some more karma with Kemba Walker who has 2 more years left on his max contract after this one.
"Players having great tournament runs rarely actually lead said players to being the number overall pick. In fact, most scouts/execs don't really consider tournament play really that highly. Scouts look for the intangibles of college prospects. Otherwise, guys like Donte DiVIncenzo or Kemba Walker would've gone #1 overall in their drafts."
"Everyone is so quick to jump the gun and be worried about losing Tatum and Brown, when they are 23 and 24. Is Miami going to be worried about losing Bam if they lose in the first or second round this year? Is Sacramento worried about losing De'Aaron Fox since he was also just signed to a 5-year max and they can't put help around him? Is Ben Simmons going to demand a trade if they don't make the finals yet again? Same for Donovan Mitchell if the Jazz don't win this year? What about Sabonis or Devin Booker?  All of these guys are the same ages as Tatum/Brown, but I never hear this narrative about them, except maybe Simmons in trade rumors, and they all haven't won a championship yet either.  Everyone said the same thing about Giannis and then he stayed in Milwaukee. I understand where it comes from when it does happen and guys want out, I just don't know what kind of power they have with 3/4 years left on $24M+ deals where any trade to match salary would send them to a bad team or a contender would be losing key pieces to match salary and they'd be in the exact same spot in a different location. Celtics aren't buying them out lol.  They have literally no leverage to demand a trade this offseason and if you make the playoffs 4 years in a row and made it to the ECF in 2/4 of those where you're the main guy(s), why would you want out that bad?  James Harden spent 8 years in Houston. KD spent 9 in OKC. LeBron stuck it out with the Cavs for 7. Paul George in Indiana for 7. AD with the Pelicans for 7. Melo with Denver for 7.5. Lillard has spent his entire career with Portland. Embiid has played 5 season with the Sixers and there's no mention of him jumping ship. Jokic 6 years in Denver and no one is saying he's going to demand a trade. None of these guys won championships with those teams.  Why does everyone act like their window is closed now or very soon after just 4 years when people act like their help (Kemba Walker, 4 time All-Star, coming back from injury/surgery. Marcus Smart, 1st team All Defense, coming back from injury. Evan Fournier, 18 PPG scoring option, 2 games in) is no help at all? This narrative is nonsense."
"I mean they‚Äôve signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker in the last few years. None were superstars but all were, at the time of signing, All-Star caliber players"
"Really?  Brad Stevens, ""a top 5 coach in the league"".  Tatum, Brown, two ""All-Stars"".  Marcus ""heart and soul of the team"" Smart.  Kemba Walker, who has been averaging 20/3.5/5 after his first ten games.  Payton Pritchard and Rob Williams, two promising young players.  Evan Fournier, a 19/3/4 guy replaced Daniel Theis, another solid player.  That's seven average to ""elite"" players with an ""elite"" head coach.  Maybe not a contending roster but that's more than enough to get to the Playoffs.  When will people finally wake up and start questioning Tatum, Brown, and Brad Stevens?"
"Gordon Hayward, Aron Baynes, Shane Larkin, Greg Monroe, And Kemba Walker.  How'd your team do in 3 seasons of Free Agency?"
"His leg exploded in the first 5 minutes of his first game. Al Horford and Kemba Walker were also free agents, they like(d) it there."
"Yes... Being in NYC means always getting the star free agents. The knicks signing Lebron and Wade in 2010 was really unfair for the league.   Before KD and Kyrie the biggest free agent signing for the nets in brooklyn was (checks notes) a washed andrei kirilenko (and people cried about that signing as well).  The celtics the last 6 years have signed Al horford, Gordan Hayward and Kemba Walker all coming off all star seasons."
Yes. Sixers should trade Simmons for Kemba Walker.
Dallas Mavericks legend Kemba Walker saving us tonight
Rally Killer Kemba Walker
"Russell is the most accomplished player from the Celtics, but Larry Bird had the greatest peak.  Bob Pettit may have been a better Hawk than Dominique Wilkins.  He played in St. Louis, though.  Kemba Walker for the current Hornets, which are different from the Hornets/Pelicans.  I would put Jokic ahead of Melo.  I'm not sure Melo was ever in the conversation for MVP. And advanced stats rate Jokic as better than Melo.  I would put Ben Wallace ahead of Chauncey Billups.  I would put him ahead of Isiah Thomas, too, although I know that's controversial.  I would put Dr. J, Moses Malone, and Charles Barkley ahead of Iverson.  I think Barkley was the best, but it's close.  The Sacramento Kings used to be the Cincinnatti Royals, and Oscar Robertson played for them.  Chris Bosh was pretty good on the Raptors.  Lowry had more success, but needed Leonard to put him over the top."
I think that Kemba Walker is an underrated defensive player.
"The talent level besides Tatum and Brown is not great and those two lack the playmaking skills to make others around them better. Also, Kemba Walker has regressed after the injuries."
"This is the worst iteration of the Celtics in the Ainge era. He has had so many pieces and assets to move around and ends up with Kemba Walker, a career under achiever who is extremely overrated and seems to be a poor leader."
"It's a complex combination of shit luck and poor roster construction in my opinion.  Ainge had a contending roster with Kyrie and Hayward but Kyrie's a headcase and Gordon snapped his leg. Then prior to last season it became an issue of too many mouths to feed and didn't lead to roster cohesion.  It was the right move to make room for both of the Jays to be the face of the team moving forward but I still think Ainge has done a poor job constructing a roster around them. For the record I'm on board with not trading either of those guys for a superstar rental, but on the flip side Ainge sat on his hands with all of the draft assets within the past few years and doesn't have much to show for it.  A common retort I've heard from Celtics fans is, ""Who could we have traded for?""  To the Celtics defense, the roster construction over the past few years has not lead itself to making any impactful trades. The Jays are untouchable, Smart is probably untouchable and Theis' production relative to his contract doesn't give them any incentive to trade him. That being said, that can be pointed at as bad roster construction.  If we want to look at it from a hindsight prospective, we can easily see that if Rozier and Morris were causing locker room issues they should have been traded instead of letting them stay until the offseason. This was also a time with both the Sac and Memphis pick had more speculative value than they'd actually come to have - what I'm getting at it is the Celtics could've gotten somebody who fit the system better.  Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  As I mentioned, this is all hindsight too but if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away.  I'll give credit where credit is due - Payton was a smart choice in that vein and I'm willing to give Nesmith the benefit of the doubt as I think he has a great ceiling of a 3&amp;D wing.  And don't give me shit about Romeo Langford not being ready - I've watched him since IU; can't shoot for shit and can't stay healthy. Bust potential is big."
"Boston gets big names in from other teams like KG, Ray Allen, Gordan Hayward, Kemba Walker, Al Horford. Id say thier history puts them in the group of desired locations.  I think the city has a big impact for sure but it is also how the organization is run, team success, culture, history of how stsrs are treated, ability to build a roster around a star, consistent competitiveness, and those types of things that bring the guys in.   Teams that try tactics like losing on purpose, sitting star players, underpaying, being cheap with salary cap, and the likes are remembered by players as places were you wont be able to get a ring. And the high level players all want accolades and proof they are great."
I‚Äôm trying to figure out how OP had every team in the league and decided to pick the .400 Celtics with Kemba fuckin Walker
"I never said we would win a 7 game series. I‚Äôm just saying we won 3 of 4 before our All NBA point guard was injured. The same point guard who has literally never lost a game in his career to Kemba Walker. We probably don‚Äôt win a 7 game series with our fully healthy squad, but we absolutely *could* have. We had no chance once Ben went down."
He might get Harrison Barnes.  Might.   Think about it. Another person for Kemba Walker to not pass to in the playoffs.
"He made the all star team in a weak East, especially weak at the guard position. He was getting in over guys like Kemba Walker.  I'm too lazy to look at the years but assuming it was 2014 - 2018 he is not making it in the west as a guard over:  Curry, Harden, Westbrook for sure. Then CP3/Kobe/Dame were all right there. Good chance he's a snub 4/5 of those all star years.  How many times did Wall make All NBA those years?"
"He's still playing better than Jaylen Brown, who has been atrocious since his hot start to the season. Not including tonight, since the beginning of February, Kemba is on average +2.5. Jaylen Brown is on average +0.5, and that's going to go down after tonight's team-worst -14.  This is why basic stats are misleading. A hobbled Kemba Walker is still a more effective player than Jaylen Brown."
ben hates kemba walker and the knicks for some reason
"The same Kemba Walker that was drafted 9th, by a team who was in the lottery? Lmfaooooo"
PG: Kemba Walker  SG: Baron Davis  SF: Kobe Bryant (don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm counting him)  PF: Tobias Harris  C: Alonzo Mourning  Coach: Tony Bennett
"That was one game when he was hot. But what happens when he‚Äôs not so hot or cold? A prime example of my point would be kemba walker. When on and hot he‚Äôs a deadly scorer. But when he‚Äôs off and shots aren‚Äôt dropping what else does he bring to the table really? Not a great facilitator, too small to defend and doesn‚Äôt really run an offense. Now you basically just have an undersized 2 guard who can‚Äôt score, facilitate, or defend. That‚Äôs why cp3 is a model that all young guards should build their games after. He‚Äôs a pass first point that can still carry a team with scoring if that‚Äôs what they need. I just think too many points guards rely on their scoring ability and they don‚Äôt work on what their primary goal is as a point guard which is making sure the team is running smoothly."

"#118 in defensive WS (kyrie Irving is 124) that should speak for itself   #348 in defensive rating ( behind Blake griffin, John Collins, Devin booker, and kemba walker) 5 notoriously horrific defensive players.  While the nuggets are #16 in overall defence.  Therefore jokics is a one trick pony who does nothing on defence and does not have an impact defensively I fail to see how that‚Äôs the MVP.   I could even argue the reasoning for his offensive numbers being so good is due to his lack of impact/effort on D. Atleast with Embiid he was doing both offence and defence at a high level so I could see his case. But jokic has no REAL case hence why lebrons ahead of him in almost every MVP race right now except the one that ranks MVP standing on pure stats."

"&gt; If you guys are gonna act like this season wasn‚Äôt a disappointment so far then damn I guess you guys were lower on your team than I thought.   I predicted we would finish between 4th and 6th this year, so yes, I have much more reasonable expectations for this team's talent level than most outsiders. Gordon Hayward was an All-Star level player that left us, and Kemba Walker was missing for the beginning of the year and played like ass upon his return, and is only an All-Star level player in 1 out of every 3 games. That's a massive talent drain as opposed to last year. I expected us to lose in the 2nd round and we are on course to do exactly that.  &gt; Kemba isn‚Äôt going to take the player option and leave , nobody is gonna be dumb enough to pay him more than the 40 million he‚Äôs owed even over multiple years. Hayward and horford have size that‚Äôs the difference. They age better.  Horford was terrible last year for the Sixers and they traded a 1st to get rid of him, he hasn't aged well at all. There are 30 teams in the NBA and not enough of them have good point guards, one of them will overpay Kemba, my personal bet is Orlando with his old coach Steve Clifford.   &gt; And brown can leave in 2024 and Tatum in 2025. You will essentially have one off-season to try and bring in free agents before Tatum watch begins whether he‚Äôs gonna leave for New York.   Tatum is going to sign the supermax.   &gt; And to your final point I‚Äôd rather be Denver/Phoenix/philly/mavs/hawks. All those teams have more young talent and more proven talent without big cap liabilities like kemba  First off, Kemba isn't a big cap liability when he's only on the books for 2 more years at most, and in all likelihood 1.   Secondly, really, Phoenix? Atlanta? Phoenix where the best player on the team is an impending free agent and 37 years old? Atlanta, a team that's literally never made the playoffs, just fired their coach, and looks likely to lose their 2nd best player this summer? And as far as Dallas goes, Porzingis' contract is a much bigger cap liability than Kemba, under contract for much longer and far more injury prone.   The only teams that can rival the Celtics in terms of future are Denver and Philly. That's it."
"Melos last 15 games are better than Ja has ever played. Wouldn‚Äôt even think twice about it. Ja is not gonna be in that star tier of nba players. Like trying to compare Kemba walker to Kyrie. You‚Äôll front like the Celtics fans did when that happened and excited, but in the back of your mind you‚Äôd swap Ja for Melo in an instant."

"&gt;I added up the average assists per game of the other four starters and the highest bench assists guy on the Suns, Celtics, and Bulls:  Not really a great way of doing it because it doesn't factor in the roles of the players you're actually looking at.  1. Marcus Smart assisting Robert Williams doesn't impact how Tatum plays the game 2. You're counting guys who haven't played half the games so far    &gt;4.6 from Kemba...6.1 from Marcus Smart   Your stat makes it look like we've had 2 PGs, we've only had 2 PGs for 5 games out of 36.   Marcus got hurt right as Kemba was coming back from injury. So you're counting these as two separate players but they should really only count as one aggregate player. It hasn't been Smart **and** Walker, it's been Smart **or** Walker.     &gt;Zach is putting up those numbers WITHOUT a true point guard.  And Tatum often runs his offence on his own. We use him in a similar way to how GSW used Durant. GSW would play to their system and then pull Curry/Klay and let KD carry the bench on his own.   We run Tatum + Bench a lot. It's been a running theme for our team for about 2-ish years now, Tatum's been the only star who can consistently carry our bench.    ***  A better way to find what you're looking for is to just look at assisted v unassisted shots [\(example link here\)](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628369/shooting/).     Player| Assited FGM| Unassisted FGM| % Unassisted ---|---|----|--- Tatum| 103 | 176| 63.1 Booker| 126 |158| 55.6 LaVine| 136| 214| 61.1  Tatum is creating for himself at a higher rate than either of the other two."
So last season we can confirm Kemba Walker and Kyle Lowry were better than Bradley Beal since they were all stars and Beal wasn‚Äôt   Am I right?
That Kyrie trade wasn‚Äôt like 5 years ago. It was relatively recent. We signed All-Star Starter Kemba Walker who has been back to form these past 10 days. We traded Hayward (who was leaving no matter what and we could‚Äôve gotten nothing) for the largest TPE in history. Now we just need to use that TPE at the trade deadline or in the summer.
Kemba Walker From the Celtics... Felt disgusted cheering for the Celtics against the raps last year. Enough said  Also hate the Mavericks going back to that 2011 sweep. Swore I would never wear anything Maverick Related but luka is making want to buy his jersey üôÑ
A kemba walker that can shoot threes...fucking disgusting.
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
"Steven Adams, Rudy Gobert, Kemba Walker, and Russell Westbrook."
"Otto porter, Russell Westbrook, kevin love, formerly Blake griffin, John wall, kemba walker, and Andre Drummond  would be a good place to start."
"Harrisson Barnes , Marcus Smart , Joe Harris Brook Lopez and Kemba Walker are gonna end up being the starting 5."
"Yeah most likely he does and I still want him to. While I don't think he can easily be that top tier PG, I think he could similar to guys like prime Kemba Walker or similar version of Jamal Murray was with Jokic.  I'm just saying I still wouldn't mind him coming off the bench. If he is still able to close games, get like 30 to 32 minutes, and play at his best, I think he can still be like that 20-25 million player, I believe he can be."
"Fuck Dinwiddie, Terry Rozier, and Charlotte Kemba Walker in particular. Those guys always got buckets."
They would have a career day being guarded by Kemba Walker.   Meanwhile people point to Dlo's struggles in the playoffs when he was guarded by Ben Simmons.
"Against Kemba Walker. Anyone who have a career day against Kemba.  Dlo was guarded by Ben Simmons, a contender for DPOY."
"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vuƒçeviƒá: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"What about like CJ McCollom+ to Boston, Marcus Smart+ to Portland, and Kemba Walker to I dunno somehwere else and also someone else does the work of figuring out the salaries and what the +es are."
On what planet is the gap between Kawhi and Tatum larger than the gap between Kemba Walker and Nic fucking Batum? Holy hell
They replaced him with Kemba walker and Gordon Hayward was himself again
"1. Bradley Beal FOR Pascal Siakam  2. Bradley Beal FOR Jrue Holiday  3. Bradley Beal FOR Tyler Herro, Andre Iguodala, Kelly Olynk  4. Bradley Beal FOR Ben Simmons  5. Bradley Beal FOR Al Horford, 4 1st Round picks  6. Bradley Beal FOR Jamal Murray  7. Bradley Beal FOR Eric Bledsoe, JJ Redick, 2 1st Round picks  8. Bradley Beal FOR Kemba Walker, Payton Pritchard  Which of these trades is the best?"
"Kemba. There's not one person who is out and proud and like ""man I hate that guy Kemba Walker"""
"&gt; Vucevic would‚Äôve/could‚Äôve signed here for what kemba‚Äôs deal was or close. He‚Äôs only making around 25-30 a year versus 35 for kemba.  Again, we couldn't have signed him without a sign and trade which includes 3 people to agree.  &gt; Rozier was only 3 million. He was gone in FA, so yea, you don‚Äôt have to include his salary. Celtics weren‚Äôt resigning him. They were only hoping for a S&amp;T for the full MLE when overpaying for Walker.   How is rozier gone in free agency when charlotte also needed a sign and trade.  he would've had to go to another team and get the money that he wanted and the celtics would've had to not match it.   &gt; You‚Äôre the casual. Need a quality big to win a title historically speaking. Celtics don‚Äôt have one.   game has changed.  bam is not a traditional big.  draymond is not a traditional big.  AD is not a traditional big.  we still lose to the heat with vuc because the celtics were soft the entire playoffs and rolled over whenever the other team made a run."
Kemba Walker says hello
"love how the post title doesn't spoil the shot. So when I read it, I imagined a nick young/kemba walker no look"
"I don‚Äôt see Boston getting past Giannis &amp; the Bucks. They need a legit 3rd star, someone more impactful than Kemba Walker."
Kemba walker and 2 first rounders.
"Thats the difference a playmaker and a scorer has on the team. There are plenty of roles in basketball and can you honestly name a scenario where an out and out scorer has ever improved his team more than a team who has a playmaker who's on exactly the same level. For every LaVine you get a Kemba Walker, Kemba walker is more important to winning and can affect the whole team more through his plays, but LaVine's role isn't an uneeded one, I've never seen a team thats come close to contending that hasn't had a 25+ PPG scorer a night on their team. Undoutbedly the Bulls will need someone better than LaVine to be in automatic contention for a ring but LaVine fills a gap we need and we'd be stupid if we think there's anyone in the league we could realistically replace him with.  Coby White has the potential to be a scorer as good as LaVine IMHO but you'd be literally throwing away Zach on the hopes that White is just as good, that doesn't make sense to me. Zach needs to improve his playmaking and defence a slight more and he could definitely be on a contending team, however it would take a stupid offer to even get talks going, we won't be able to replicate what LaVine brings to the table so easily."
If LeBron never came to Cleveland Kyrie would be bad personality Kemba Walker
"As much as we know is original plan was to play alongside Lillard in Brooklyn, but then Lillard decided to not leave Portland. So there where Kyrie or Kemba Walker..."

"I don't know why but I feel like some players just tend to have really bad games after really good games, or really good games after really bad games.   Another example is Kemba Walker in 2018-19- He scored 7 points on 2-16 in a 24-point loss to the Cavs- I'd argue it was the worst game of his career. Then the very next game he dropped 60 on the Sixers."
"Baron Davis, Gerald Wallace, Al Jefferson, Kemba Walker"
Now do the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats net rating without Kemba Walker.
"I didn‚Äôt watch the documentary but a lot of those things don‚Äôt seem too far fetched. This might be an unpopular opinion, even among Spurs fans, but I think Tony was our best player in the early 2010s. Him saying the offense ran through him kinda made sense since he was the point guard. Sure those Spurs teams had a selfless motto but it was Tony doing most of the ball handling. He also seemed to have a falling out with Kawhi their last season in SA so it makes sense he‚Äôs not featuring him. But at the same time Kawhis FMVP was more of a reward for him going up against Lebron and not really bcuz he was carrying the team.  I also feel like you‚Äôre selling Tony a bit short by calling him a Top 50 point guard. Like yes he is but so is probably Kemba Walker."
Kemba Walker maybe shouldn't be that close but isn't the NBA Hall the easiest to get into?
He also said Kemba Walker is the best player on the celtics
"Celtics are damn good, will be even better when Kemba Walker returns. They consistently make the ECF during the phase where playoff success isn't even expected yet, because they're still so young."
"I don't know if Trae can start playing that way out of nowhere. Curry can do it because he was a shooting guard before he was a point guard, so he's always played offball. Pretty much every guard who sometimes plays point and has a good mix of offball-onball play (e.g. Beal, Jamal Murray, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday) has always played offball their entire career."
By Current Skill 1. Chris Paul 2. Kyle Lowry 3. Kemba Walker 4. Jrue Holiday 5. CJ McCollum  By Contract / Asset Value 1. CJ McCollum 2. Jrue Holiday 3. Kyle Lowry 4. Kemba Walker 5. Chris Paul
Lmao you genuinely can not be saying you‚Äôd rather have Collin Sexton over all star starter last season Kemba Walker. Collin sexton is a stat stuffer on a bad team.
I guess 3rd option Kemba walker? Given Jaylen brown‚Äôs improvement.
"There are no Lin haters. There are haters of Lin fanboys who came out every time All-star Kemba Walker shot poorly and demanded he started over him, demanded he get significant minutes on the championship Raptors even though he was not good, etc"

"&gt;We pulled off an improbable finals run by beating the team with the best record in the NBA, most PPG in the league, as well as the the best DEF rating in the league. Notice how I said TEAM and could care less about the 2x B2B MVP they have as well.  &gt;On top of that we beat a Celtics team that has gone to the ECF the last 3 out of 4 years with Jaylen, Tatum AND a brand new addition in Kemba Walker.  if you consider these impressive feats, it sounds like you situationally overachieved"

Guys like Kemba Walker and Steph have helicopter parents who are always at their games. These are like ... influencer parents.
"This team needs Kemba walker way more than I originally thought, not because of chemistry or fit but because our bench is so incredibly bad that we just need another good player."
As well as an equivalent great Kemba Walker
"Problems? Celtics don't have a problem in the world. All their young players are getting better, their draft picks look great, and they are about to upgrade Jeff Teague into Kemba Walker in a few weeks. If Romeo and Williams develop anywhere near their potential the Celtics are gravy for at least 4 seasons."
I think people are severely underrating how much an even marginally healthy Kemba Walker will help this team. Our record will be what it is but we should really just be stoked about the Jays because that's what is actually important at this point.
"Yup..    1. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  2. Luka Donƒçiƒá, Dallas Mavericks  3. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  4. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  5. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  6.

b/c sexton has a a good start hes now better than multi time all star kemba walker? Kemba is dynanmic when healthy he was banged up last year and averaged 22 and was a starting all star.   Besides the obvious salary thing sexton is no where near kembas impct.
"""I want someone who passes the ball"" then he picked Kemba Walker. That's him saying that Kemba is a better passer than Harden, which is not true.  Harden does pass the ball a lot, even in the offense we ran in Houston. He actually passes the ball more than Giannis. Is Giannis a selfish player?  It wasn't a joke either, he talked shit after the game too."
"Some NBA fans care that the back-to-back MVP thinks Kemba Walker, a below average passer, is a better passer than James Harden, who has an assist title."
"It's gotta be Jrue Holiday, Goran Dragic/Bam Adebayo or Jaylen Brown/Kemba Walker.   Those are the only 3rd options in the league that are all star caliber players."
"The version of Steph I fell in love with would have been able to drag trash to a #1 offense (while he's on the court). He was that good. Just a straight up fireball who was a threat anywhere within 35 feet. You could just see the fear in the eyes of defenders whenever he was on the court, triple teaming him without the ball.   The current version of Steph is just not that, or anything close. He's like a Kemba Walker on steroids with better passing and decision-making. That's a very great player. But not a cheat code that instantly makes you a #1 offense."
I mean yeah Kemba was better but not so much so that's it's ridiculous to call LaMelo your franchise player imo.  Sometimes I feel as though everybody just ignores how limited of a playmaker and how mediocre of a defender Kemba Walker is because he played on Charlotte his whole career. He hasn't averaged 6+ assists since his third season in the league.
i mean... they had Kemba Walker and replaced him with a knock off version. they did this to themselves.
I mean started off ice cold and oh maybe one kemba walker too?
"If domantas is top 20 then where are the other young players like Brandon Ingram, Jamal Murray, Fox, Kristaps? Or even older players who still play at a high level like Kyle Lowry, Demar Derozan, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker.   Domantas isn‚Äôt above any of those players, calling him top 20 is just straight stupid lol"
all i know is it better not be that bum ass FIBA roster that was led by Kemba Walker.
"For what it's worth Brown was among the next two players I would have listed. Frankly if you believe that Siakam's bad spell of form is more than that you can even put him on the back-end of the top 30.  As mentioned in another reply Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry and CJ McCollum would be included in my 30-40 range. range."
"I never subscribed to this claim. Sabonis was a deserved all-star last season. That being said he's got to keep on performing to really establish himself in the top30. There's some big names in the top 30-40 range.  Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, Kemba Walker, Jrue Holiday, Russel Westbrook, Ja Morant, De'Aaron Fox, Kyle Lowry, CJ McCollum and others."
"Kemba Walker üêè, Muggsy Bogues, Baron Davis  If George Shinn wasn‚Äôt such a POS Baron Davis would have been in Charlotte way longer and would likely be number 2."
"That's a great breakdown of the situation. Simmons is not a player I personally consider in the elite tier where the max contract for them is an underpay, but 76ers fans sound completely detached from reality when they say that he's worth nothing close to his contract without shooting better.   Look around the NBA, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker, Al Horford, Kevin Love are getting paid close to Simmons money and they produce nowhere near his value. Porzingis, Tobias and Wall are getting paid more than Simmons and are producing less value. Simmons is a DPOY candidate and a great passer in transition which like it or not, is valuable in the regular season when players are less willing to sacrifice their bodies on the defensive end. He's a 3 time all-star in 4 years of playing. Perennial all-stars get max contracts easily in today's NBA.  Simmons on the open market is still a 25-30 million a year player. He fits the Sixers exceptionally poorly because their superstar is a big, but that does not make it his obligation to change his game, it's on their front office to build a team that suits their star.   As for the trade request, wasn't this mutually agreed to when his group and the Sixer FO had a meeting at the start of the off-season? They said that they would like to trade him, he agreed that he would be better in a different situation. Then Morey spent the entire summer making ridiculous trade demands very publicly to the point where everyone who follows the NBA knows that the Sixers are only keeping him begrudgingly. Why wouldn't a player hate the team at that point? He needs to report to camp, take the money and crush the team morale as much as he can."
If we tape their arms all together the NBA can‚Äôt possibly expect Simmons to take free throws. Curry will be the default FT shooter and we will dominate in a way not seen since the legendary Kemba Walker Bobcats.
"Your first paragraph is like when the rich kid complains that his loaded parents only gave him 1000 dollars for his weekly allowance. Like in what world is Gordon Hayward, Al Horford and Kemba Walker not big signings?"
"&gt; Using Lou Williams career average? He was averaging 12 points a game with LAC. And was traded as salary filler.  That was his 19-20 numbers...you know...the year before he got traded to the Hawks.  &gt; Also not factoring in Minutes played either. Lol.  When comparing Kemba to what he could do in the playoffs to what he did in the playoffs, minutes doesn't matter. He's an ironman who will play through injuries. Just because he gives you 40min doesn't mean it was healthy Kemba Walker giving you that.  &gt; Yeah you really know what you‚Äôre talking about /s  Well this was an ok argument until insults started getting thrown around for no reason. Have a good one."
"&gt; Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?  That was an exaggeration, but at least 4 of them played equivalent or better in years without Trae. And the rest of the have never played without Trae, so there's no way of knowing.  1. Gallinari: 18ppg in OKC then 13 ppg in ATL  2. Lou Williams: 18ppg in LAC then 10ppg in ATL  3. Bogdan Bogdanovic: 15ppg in SAC then 16ppg in ATL  4. Clint Capela: 16ppg in HOU then 15ppg in ATL  &gt; Hayward played 4/6 games  He averaged 10ppg and wasn't around for the rest of the playoffs to get to that point. Hardly, anything helpful to the team.   &gt; So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.  Wtf?!?!? That's a reach on what I was saying. I said the best players were injured and Kemba was certainly injured and his per 36 numbers certainly show that. Doesn't matter how man minutes he played.  &gt; Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours  Lol wtf does this even mean?"
"Who are 5 guys that were putting up better stats without Trae?   And Hayward played 4/6 games in the ECF, the same that Trae did.   And Kemba played every game in the playoffs that year. Averaged 40 MPG and 17-4-6 against the Raptors and 36 MPG against the Heat with 20-4-5.  So you are literally pretending Lou Williams was a better player than Kemba Walker.   Yeah your not doing Celtics flairs any favours"
"Recent all-stars I definitely prefer Ben Simmons to:  Kemba Walker, Pascal Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Domantas Sabonis, Khris Middleton, Russell Westbrook, Brandon Ingram, Kyrie Irving, Julius Randle, Nik Vucevic, Mike Conley, D'Angelo Russell"

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"I got one that wasn't domination but it is weird. Kemba Walker vs the Heat  In his first playoffs in 2014 Kemba's Hornets met the Heat (and LeBron) in the first round. Lost  0-4  In his second playoffs in 2016 Kemba's Hornets met post-LeBron Wade's Heat in the first round. Lost 3-4  In his third playoffs in 2020 Kemba's Celtics met Butler's Heat in the conference finals where he lost 2-4  Kemba has his first 3 playoffs (2014, 2016, 2020) end to the Heat to three different iterations of the team (Heatles, post championship Wade Heat, Butler's Heat)  And while it isn't what you asked the Spurs were a combined 2-14 against the Lakers in the 80s during the playoffs."
"As long as a future team change isn't too controversial he's close to a shoo in  He's the Nuggets first franchise MVP  The second player to make all nba 1st team (Thompson being the first)  And just 5 years into his career he's 7th in points (8360), 6th in rebounds (4437), 5th in assists (2697), and 1st in triple doubles (57)  He gets even better in the playoffs  Jokic is already 2nd in playoff points (1114), 1st in playoff rebounds (485), and 2nd in playoff assists (277).   The playoff points record is 1540 so he needs 17-18 games averaging around 25 points to beat that record but the assist record is only 280 so he can get that in a single game. Assuming a long career Jokic can annihilate the Denver Nuggets postseason playoff records like how LeBron dominates Clevelands.  Jamal Murray has been to 2 postseason's and he's already 5th in points and 4th in assists.  And for fun, just looking through stats randomly I saw that Chris Webber was only 12 points away from overtaking Oscar Robertson as the Kings all time playoff scorer. Durant is already the Nets 7th highest playoff scorer in a single 2nd round exit. Dwight is the Magics career leader in Points/rebounds/blocks for both the regular season and postseason. In Derrick Rose's short Bulls playoff career he already reached 5th in playoff points and 3rd in playoff assists. The Charlotte Hornets playoff history is so ass that in only 11 games Kemba Walker was already 7th in all time playoff points with #1 being ... David Wesley."
"For the Knicks, it will be that an opposing team will figure out a defensive scheme to stop both Julius Randle and Kemba Walker, and they won't be able to offensively overcome it. Also, RJ Barrett will be solid player this coming season, but still not an all-star level player the caliber of Paul George or Jimmy Butler, which is what the Knicks need him to be to REALLY get over the hump.     I legit hope I'm wrong in all of this, and that the Knicks do in fact have what it takes to win a championship."
Ye that's kind of a Kemba Walker season
the knicks have the literal top coach and upgraded starting PG from elfrid payton to kemba walker. the only way the pacers finish ahead of them is if the pacers are significantly healthier than the knicks.
Kemba Walker
https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/25/17051044/andre-drummond-dribble-highlights-video-pistons-kemba-walker
"2 teams had shorter off-seasons.  Walker, Brown, Tatum, and Dmart played a total of 292 minutes together all season, which was 137th in the NBA. The Jazz had 13 combinations of players above that. The Celtics also had the most days with players in COVID protocols by a large margin - more than the bottom 10 teams combined.   As a result, they never really hit their stride. The defense also dropped drastically from previous seasons. I don't think it's crazy to feel like shoring up their biggest weaknesses from last season (defense and depth) makes them a worse team.   Theis and Fournier were both there for part of the season, and Kemba couldn't get healthy. It feels a little disingenuous to act like they were key pieces."
"&gt;Kemba Walker was an all star in 2020,  So? Kemba was awful last year"
"Kemba Walker was an all star in 2020, John Wall hasn't played meaningful minutes in 3 years.  Wall doesn't 'move the needle' for any team at this point in his career."
LaMelo Ball for Kemba Walker lol
"Well, it is hard to get good players to join non big teams. Most smaller teams have issues in getting a second star to join them. Kemba Walker had issues trying to get others joining him. Then Nic robbed the Hornets after they paid him lol."
"Yeah I'd trade Hayward or Rozier for age 25-29 Kemba Walker. Super easy decision imo. I really like the idea of Ball and Kemba sharing ball-handling and scoring duties, and having Ball guarding wings rather than guards.  Now if you mean the player we're building the team around... I'm sticking with LaMelo, knowing Kemba's significant knee issues started at 29. The ceiling could be a good bit higher than Kemba, and we have 8 years of contractual control, rather than just 4 years of Kemba's prime before the knee troubles happen."
Then I guess Kemba Walker and Blake griffin are idiots. Sometimes millionaires with a passion for basketball care more about a chip than adding more millions to the millions they have...  Blake is only a year older than wall and the last healthy season he had was better than wall. How was he towards the end of his career but wall isn‚Äôt? He had two years on his contract and agreed to a buy out to go contend in Brooklyn.   Kemba Walker had 2 years left on his deal and accepted a buyout from OKC so he could go compete in New York.
Kemba Walker
"All of this is just silly posturing, trying to make teams think there's no urgency to trade him, and to make Wall think they're perfectly fine paying him $44 million not to play this year. But let's be real, Houston would love to move on from Wall and not have to pay that remaining $92 million for him. If Wall wants to play this year, this is trying to get him to give back Blake Griffin and Kemba Walker kind of money for a buyout. If Wall is totally on board with just sitting out the season like Luol Deng then it's probably a stalemate until next summer when he'll almost surely get bought out. Otherwise I'll be interested to see if there's some pushback from Wall to force Houston's hand."
Kemba walker?
&gt; No way the Knicks have as good a year as the last one  I think you're really underrating the fact that we replaced Elfrid with Kemba Walker and that we now have D Rose for a full season this time around. In addition to the general steps forwards guys like RJ are going to take next year. Maybe we won't be good enough for the 4 seed but I think there's a very real possibility we're too good again for the play-in tournament
Nah Presti learned his lesson after taking on Kemba Walker.
Lmfao wtf is ‚Äútop 3 all time Blazer‚Äù supposed to prove  Kemba Walker is literally the greatest Hornet of all time
"1. Steph Curry  2. James Harden  3. Luka Doncic  4. Damian Lillard  5. Kyrie Irving (more of a shooting guard now)  6. Trae Young  7. Chris Paul  8. Russell Westbrook  9. De‚ÄôAaron Fox  10. Jamal Murray  11. Ja Morant  12. LaMelo Ball  Ben Simmons is probably next or possibly as high as 9 but there are other players that are not as talented as Simmons that I‚Äôd rather have on my team due to them not having as big of a gaping weakness like Simmons.  These players include Jrue Holiday, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, Lonzo Ball, Malcolm Brogdon, and DeJounte Murray.  You can also argue Kemba Walker and Fred VanVleet.  LeBron James and Nikola Jokic are elite ball handlers that act like a point guard on offense."
"its not old, but Kemba Needsa Walker is my favorite. Learned about it recently"
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
"Kemba Walker is in NY now. Imma be honest though, I only know Jabari Parker and Tacko Fall.  What I meant was that ever since you guys had that great season with Kyrie sidelined we were all expecting the young team to get even better and start contending for best in the East. Tatum and Brown have gotten better but the team got worse. Just can't figure out why that is"
"Bunch of rookies, sophomore and 3rd year player on our bench last season. Now we have a decent bench. Semi Ojeleye, Recovering Langford, Rookie Neismith, Sophomore Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards and Tremont Waters (both under 6 feet), Jabari Parker, Washed TT, White guy from the bulls and Tacko Fall. Oh I forgot Kemba in and out Walker. Did you even know those guys? Lmfaoo"
"I think you're being a little too hard on your team.  Gotta put it into perspective; you've been a team for a little over 30 years.  Here's other teams in the same boat:   * Dallas Mavericks - 1980  * Miami Heat - 1988  * New Orleans Pelicans (former Hornets) - 1988  * Minnesota Timberwolves - 1989  * Orlando Magic - 1989  * Memphis Grizzlies - 1995  * Toronto Raptors - 1995  * Charlotte Hornets (current) - 2004    You've been to the Finals twice already.  Went to the ECF two more times.  You've been in the playoffs for half of the franchise's existence   You're easily better than the Grizzlies, Hornets and Timberwolves.  I feel like you have to put it into perspective that you're still one of the youngest franchises in the league.  Look at Minnesota.  They got gifted KG, lost him, and they've never recovered.  Literally went through one of the worst playoff droughts in NBA history.  You guys got gifted Shaq, lost him, and still managed to get more superstars and go to the Finals again in the next 15 years.  Other expansion teams would dream of being that successful.  I think with perspective you'd see you're not as bad of a franchise as you're making it sound like.  You've *had* generational talents, way more than a bunch of these other franchises could claim.  Look at your franchise's best players and compare that to teams whose best players are Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry, and Kemba Walker.  Just haven't gotten one to stick yet."
"except ws/48 isn't indictive of actual skill. Look at that list, for the 2018-19 season, and tell me if the results are remotely useful. Javale mcgee is a top 40 player in the league while kemba walker, bradley beal, draymond aren't. Klay thompson isn't in the top 100 players in the league. it doesn't show anything"
"&gt;Did y'all forget y'all got ranthrough by us last season?  Regular season? Thats adorable lol  &gt;Also, outta the 14 playoff games we've played we won 9 of them, soooo.....ü§î.  Clinging to the past, a Knicks fan classic  &gt;Congrats in the last playoffs....We upgraded tho, so let's see how we play this season.  Congrats on old ass kemba walker that can't stay on the court anymore, I'm sure he'll help out Dubious Handles in the play-ins lol"
Kemba Walker. And I guess Eddie Jones
I swear one time he said ‚Äúkemba Walker stops on a dime and gives em back 9 cents‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Just‚Ä¶.why?
Brand new team. No records. Get one primary scorer that gets the game high for his team consistently. Wait 100 games. Record broken.  I'm honestly confused by everyone being confused by this. Kemba Walker could beat this record if he was literally only competing with himself and his teammates.
You talking about Zions acl and getting hyped for Kemba Walker in the same breath is absolutely telling of the sad existence of a Knicks fan.
"Yeah because nobody declines that type of money that early and he was already pissed with the way they‚Äôve been coached with rumors swirling that he wants to be traded to Miami. Zion is an acl tear waiting to happen. NY swapped out their loose end Payton and inconsistent Bullock with Kemba Walker a playoff flamethrower in Fournier on top of two well renowned 3 and D rookies, locked up Julius for less than what he could‚Äôve gotten and Mitchell Robinson added about 30 lbs of muscle. Pelicans added nothing don‚Äôt try and compare that garbage franchise to what NYK is building right now."
LaMarcus Aldridge  Joe Johnson  Paul Milsap  Danny Granger  Kemba Walker
Sadly Kemba Walker
"Lol last year you were garbage, you can be better and still be a 1st or 2nd round exit(which you will be at best).  And you somehow got a lot better going from kemba walker to Dennis schroder and al horford? lollll  And the Sixers not being better this next year doesn't mean they have peaked, hard concept for you to grasp apparently.  You got worse last year, does that mean you peaked? No?  See how that works?"
"How have you watched the league the last 4 years and not understood by now that the cap is mostly imaginary. You can move any money for any money mostly at any time unless you're wildly over the salary cap.   How many of the ""worst deals around the league"" have moved just in the last 2 or 3 offseasons? Because off the top of my head i can count John Wall, Kemba Walker, Mike Conley, Al Horford, Russell Westbrook twice, Chris Paul twice, Andrew Wiggins, Marc Gasol, Kristaps Porzingis and I'm probably forgetting a good number.  And we can say anything we want about Ben Simmons in the playoffs or about his mental fortitude, whatever. He is at worst the 40th-50th best player in the league. At worst. His athleticism, build and skillset on defense make him uniquely valuable in raising the floor of a team in a way not many guys in the league can do, and said skillset fills a lot of holes for Minnesota. And the kicker is he's coming at the lowest cost he could possibly come at. Based on current valuation I'd say Ben Simmons is the highest upside bad contract in the league. By a country mile. Acquiring Ben Simmons does more for Minnesota at this juncture then any free agent they could hypothetically sign within the next couple offseasons because they're scheduled to be past the cap til '23 anyways. So this penny pinching really overall is so needless. The Wolves need talent. Go and get talent that's available at an all time low asset cost. This isn't rocket science.  Sincerely, Dumbass"

"it's not a money disparity though.  the fact that salaries are the same is what's actually causing the player movement.  if the salary incentive is the same across teams, players will seek out other incentives such as location and likelihood of winning a championship.  the problem with the supermax is that it sometimes puts the home team in a bind.  take the Kemba Walker situation in Charlotte for instance.  Charlotte offered Kemba more than the max but less than the supermax, but Kemba's feelings got hurt that they didn't offer him the supermax, so he went to Boston for less money.  the supermax sometimes creates a no-win situation for the team that is trying to retain their superstar free agent."
"No, it absolutely isn‚Äôt. This is a lie bucks fans use to keep giannis humble image in tact. Harden said giannis had a crazy 2019 season but felt like he deserved the award. He didn‚Äôt say anything else. He averaged 36 and 8, he had every right to say he deserved it  Giannis started it by saying harden can‚Äôt pass then choosing kemba Walker and then elbowing harden, getting clamped by him in the ASG and trying to mock his defense after"
"I feel like you've just totally glossed over the reality that basically nobody has cap space during the season. Here are the actual teams who have had cap space during the season and how much for the last three years:  [2018-19](https://i.imgur.com/9OhpVTK.png) - Only Dallas  [2019-20](https://i.imgur.com/loD69OR.png) - Nobody  [2020-21](https://i.imgur.com/uPg37UU.png) - Only the Knicks, OKC &amp; Charlotte  This year right now it's only OKC who is still under the cap.   So if you're saying that we need to figure out a way so that these bought out players will cost the teams that sign them more money, then those are the only teams who would actually have the space to sign someone to something other than the veteran minimum exception, because for anything else you need cap space. So basically you're saying that they should get bought out from one bad team just so another bad team can spend a bunch of money for an older vet they don't have a role for either.   If you want proof that this isn't something anyone wants, look no further than the one team left with cap space this year: OKC. After all, they themselves recently bought out Kemba Walker so they could save a little money since they preferred that to paying him full price when they really have no use for him."
"Kemba Walker. Single-handedly gave Hornets fans something to watch for so many years. He has had some injury problems with the Celtics, and despite playing well, doesn‚Äôt get nearly the respect he deserves from NBA fans. He‚Äôs also an all-around respectable guy. My favorite player."
"Tiny Archibald, Dolph Schayes, Richie Guerin, Rod Strickland, Jamal Mashburn, Kemba Walker, and Malik Sealy. The Bronx."
"He at least deserved a Lou Williams level of responsibility. He was playing very well up until his injury, a solid 15/5 player that was hitting his shots while still facilitating the role.   The amount of scrutiny he was faced with after Linsanity can be attributed to nothing other than him being Asian. Was he far from a point god? Absolutely. But could he play a Kemba Walker type of role for the second squad? Without a doubt.  Look at Kuzma. He‚Äôs probably going to get a hell of a lot of playing time as a scorer."
He already has a ring. The reason for doing a buyout is you get lump sum of money now that‚Äôs considerably smaller than your guaranteed contract. You lose tens of millions. He‚Äôs never getting another contract of note in the league.   Btw Kemba Walker forfeited 20 million guaranteed on for his buyout
I am not that rich and money does have it‚Äôs limitations.  Kemba Walker could still be in OKC right now but he took a buyout.  Love knows he is shot and he knows he won‚Äôt get anymore NBA checks after this.  He can be the Bobby Bonilla of basketball.
Nobody beats Kemba Walker 29 times in a row!
This summer lol. Kemba Walker. Im not disagreeing with you he‚Äôs a minimum player im just saying if there was a possibility of him not going to LA or Brooklyn it would be cause of more money
"I think for Love it really depends on how much passion he still has for the game. If he's kinda over it and just wants to retire, then he won't give anything back. But if he's looking for playing time or wants to be in a winning team again, then maybe it's worth it to give up some money to play again. We've seen LMA, Blake Griffin and Kemba Walker give up a bunch of money to go play elsewhere rather than stay either in a small role or on a bad team (or both). Luol Deng gave the Lakers back $7 million just so he could try to get signed by another team and play again. It just depends on what Love wants."

"I really doubt you watch more Nuggets game than I had the past 4 years, you‚Äôre just behind multiple burners taking on different team flairs dude, stats are cute but you would know better if you actually watch games, or unless you just a huge homer that you can‚Äôt just deal with it.  Murray playmaking is average at best, he‚Äôs not that PnR savant, not ideal to be a primarily lead guard in an offensive engine if he was to be put as a number 1 guy.. hence like I said he‚Äôs a combo guard. Murray works best with Jokic in PnR and their 2 men game and chemistry are what drive Murray play making much better..  For me Murray is like on the same playmaking tier as Jrue Holiday or Kemba Walker. His passing out of PnR into cross court corner 3 are not even as accurate as say someone like Dame or Conley.. and he‚Äôs of course way behind than the likes of Brogdon or Fox when it comes to playmaking.  Also you‚Äôre already flat out wrong about Murray and Brown defense being a tie. Take the L boi. Murray for the most part have been below average on that end, on ball and off ball were bad, got better off ball first, then recently got better on ball but by no means it‚Äôs a toss up when it comes to comparing him to Jaylen Brown. Brown is a multi positional defender able to check 2-4, He clamped Pascal Siakam in the Playoffs all by himself for example. He can legit provide lock down defense where as Murray has been more a liability on that end more often than not."
"Man I think five would be pretty tough for the Knicks at this point because the team doesn't really have clear cut Stars and has a lot of depth at the moment.    if I wanted to protect Randle, Fournier, Barrett and Mitchell Robinson, who in my opinion or the obvious four, there would still be a lot of players I'd want to protect. If I could protect eight players the next three in line would be quickly Burks and Noel, and I would just assume that Rose and kemba Walker would refuse to report to the expansion team enough where they wouldn't get snagged."
"I mean I‚Äôm just going off of regular season success based on when the Celtics had Hayward and Walker, who was still solid in the regular season in 2019. Losing Hayward for nothing and Kemba coming back with lingering issues with his knees was why I wasn‚Äôt surprised that the Celtics weren‚Äôt nearly as good last year as they‚Äôd been in years prior. Not to mention that even in 2019 their front court was somewhat of a liability and they didn‚Äôt do anything to fix it. I think these problems were exacerbated by the odd season but they would‚Äôve been issues regardless. I think they‚Äôll be an improved team this season but I still don‚Äôt think they have the talent to overcome the Sixers or Hawks"
"They beat as many dangerous teams in the West during 2015 that the Heat beat over 2013/2014.   Along the way to the finals they beat the Pelicans (45-37) limited with Jrue Holiday injury, Grizzlies (55-27) Grit and Grind Grizzlies, and Rockets (56-26) post whatever the fuck the previous year rockets were into a good Harden supporting cast where Josh Smith plays the way he imagines he does.  During the Heat's 2013 run they had the terrifying east gauntlet of Bucks (38-44) whose best player was Monta ""have it all"" Ellis, Bulls (45-37) pre-all star Butler/ injured Rose but prime Joakim Noah, and Indiana (49-33) actually a good team with ultimate verticality Hibbert.  In their 2014 run, they beat Charlotte (43-39) the Al Jefferson show featuring pre all star Kemba Walker, Brooklyn (44-38) fine team but this is also the year Deron/Garnett declined, Indiana (56-26) another good team where PG3 improved and Roy Hibbert did the opposite.  The 2015 Warriors run had them go threw 3 all nba members just in the West which was as many as the Heat went through in 2013+2014 in the East."
Isiah Thomas or Kemba walker
Kemba Walker maybe
11. LaMelo Ball 12. Mike Conley 13. Fred VanVleet 14. Malcolm Brogdon 15. Lonzo Ball 16. Kyle Lowry 17. D'Angelo Russell 18. Spencer Dinwiddie 19. Kemba Walker 20. Terry Rozier 21. Derrick Rose 22. Dejounte Murray  EDIT: I swear I wrote out 11-22 numbers but reddit doesn't like starting lists at 11?
UConn fan here. I predicted both him and Jeremy lamb would disappoint at the nba level. They both were always moping around the court looking disinterested and sadge. They also never seemed to really care or go full on 100% during games. They also displayed absolutely zero leadership skills and led a team that started the season ranked #4 in the country and fresh off the Kemba walker chip to unranked and out of the tourney in the first round. Their attitudes always sucked.
[Highlight] Kemba Walker INSANE CAREER HIGH 63 Points vs Celtics!
LaMarcus Aldridge   Tracy McGrady  Vince Carter  Chris Paul  Steve Nash  Paul Millsap  Rudy Gay  Marc Gasol  Kemba Walker  DeMar DeRozan  Shawn Marion  Dwyayayayane Wade
"Lebron   Derrick Rose  Joakim Noah  Jason Kidd  Chris Paul  Kemba Walker  Paul Pierce  Z Ilgauskas, the Cavs guy   Horace Grant  Vlade Divac  Jason Richardson  Dwight Howard  Please no one ask why I came up with these, I totally have no idea"
Kemba Walker  Tacko Fall  Magic Johnson  Reggie Miller  Jason Kidd  Blake Griffin
"Some big names he missed:  * Russell Westbrook * James Harden (I'm calling him a point guard he's a guard with 4 seasons averaging 10+ assists and is almost always directing play fight me), Steph Curry and Jrue Holiday all in 2009 and the only player he picked was Ricky Rubio at tier 2 * On top of Kyrie 2011 also produced Kemba Walker and Isaiah Thomas * Damian Lillard * Oladipo is listed as a PG for his first season - does that count? * 2016 had Ben Simmons (kind of remarkable that around all the hype he didn't even rate him good enough to be an all-star) * 2017 continues it's oofness by also missing De'Aaron Fox (also Donovan Mitchell but I don't think he was considered a PG at the time)."
Because he's the kemba walker
Kemba Walker
"Yes - Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Carmelo Anthony, Draymond Green, Jokic, Kyrie   Yes, but he shouldn‚Äôt - Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin  No - Paul George, Kevin Love, Rudy Gobert, Andre Iguodala  Absolutely not - Kemba Walker"
"&gt; Comparing what they got and what they lost, the latter is obviously better.  Horford&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thompson  Kemba is better offensively then Schroder, but the thing about Kemba is his health and defense are big negatives. Plus paying Walker 36 &amp; 37 the next two years would had been terrible for us only to have him being hurt or getting ran off the court during the playoff. Also we traded Richardson to replace Fouriner, but Evan is the better player so I won't argue with that."
"Well just looking at PG's drafted from 2005 onwards that made All-Star: Deron Williams, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday when he was predominantly a PG, Jeff Teague (hah), John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas, Damian Lillard, not going to count Oladipo as he mostly plays a lot of time at SG and the same will go for LaVine, D'Angelo Russell, Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic and Trae Young.  Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.  Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.  But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot. This would of course not make him a PG.  And finally, no, LeBron is not up for discussion here."
You‚Äôre telling me that the Sixers wouldn‚Äôt still make the finals if you removed AI or replaced him with like Kemba Walker  or some other scrub? Blasphemy
"lol I think mine end up being all guards...  Kemba Walker, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Luka Doncic  all-time team has some size: Steve Nash, Kemba Walker, Gerald Wallace, Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal"
"Raptors are 10th in the league in valuation and just signed Masai to a hilariously large contract.  Oh, and pre-COVID, we were third in the league in average attendance.  Also, didn't you guys just sign Kemba Walker to a hilarious contract, only to give up a 1st to just to get rid of him (AND you had to take back Horford and his terrible contract)?    We'll see who wins a ring first."
We're nowhere close but Kemba Walker combined with Alonzo Mourning would be stupidly fun.  Shaq+Magic is easily the best though.
"If you‚Äôre not trying to downplay Dwades dunk then why mention it lol.   Not to mention that how good a player is doesn‚Äôt change how nasty the dunk is. Kemba Walker is a lot better than Varejao, but Wade dunking on Kemba would be not nearly as impressive as this."
"Ya the wizards have gotten Spencer Dinwiddie and the Celtics got Al Horford, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward and hell even Kyrie had Boston on his list in the last 7 years. What are you even talking about man. And lmfao at Tatum coming to DC. Also, Brad has been great this offseason. Let‚Äôs see what happens tho."
"The East has never been weak at the PG position, what kind of bullshit is this?  Kyle Lowry  Kemba Walker  Kyrie Irving  John Wall  Isaiah Thomas  Trae Young  Ben Simmons  These guys have all been All NBA caliber PGs at some point in recent memory despite playing in the east."
"Kemba Walker, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Mitch Richmond, Vin Baker and Demarcus Cousins.  All former allstars but losers nonetheless."
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
You saw Julius randle and rj Barrett shit the bed in the playoffs and think Mitchell Robinson would save you. The series wasn‚Äôt even close y‚Äôall got blown out a good portion of games and lost in 5. We beat Joel embiid Tobias Harris and Ben Simmons and are supposed to be scared of Evan Fournier and kemba walker. Again I haven‚Äôt seen a single hawks fan say we beat the bucks or bkn next year
He's the poster boy for never staying loyal to a team until you get your bag. Homeboy played even with a bad hip and injured it further and Boston. repayed him by shipping his out. Between that stuff and the Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker trade Boston is going to have a hard time recruiting top of the food chain guys there in FA. They literally gathered all of those picks to eventually try to get Anthony Davis and his father shut them out completely in trade talks.
"im very happy for nyc and kemba walker. this is actually a pretty fun slate, idk about celtics vs bucks and warriors vs suns. id almost rather see those 2 inverted - bucks v suns, celtics v warriors."
There is no way Kemba Walker has enough money for all of the stuff he wants. What if he wants 100 billion dollars worth of American stocks?
"I just want to put into perspective how nuts it is to have 7 all-stars (former or current) on one team.  In SEVENTEEN YEARS since the Bobcats expansion in 2004, the Bobcats and Hornets have had a total of seven former or current all-stars:  Gerald Wallace, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Dwight Howard, Juwan Howard, Tony Parker, and Theo Ratliff"
"Stephon Marbury, players forgotten in this generation will probably be like Pascal Siakam, Victor Oladipo, Demarcus Cousins, and Kemba Walker just to list a few."
Ummmm Kemba Walker.
Kemba Walker
Al who?  Cousins has been gone  Kemba walker  Bradley beal  Middleton
"Derrick Rose, Bradley Beal (unless he makes some very strong playoff runs), KAT, Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Jaylen Brown.  And totally agree, Carmelo reminiscent of Dantley and Alex English, albeit with slightly larger fanbase."
Fred Van Vleet &gt; Kemba Walker. I genuinely think Kemba is so overrated at this point. Fred can run an offense and is a way better defender. Being a better isolation scorer doesn‚Äôt make you a better player
If Mike Conley makes it the hall of fame should be shut down. Same with Kemba Walker and John Wall.
"Kemba Walker probably, there‚Äôs just been far too many great point guards in his era and I feel like he‚Äôs the odd man out. No disrespect at all I hope he proves me dead wrong on the Knicks this season."
Kemba Walker
Kemba Walker is going to end up forgotten like Stephon Marbury. Like Marbury never comes up in top 25 pg lists and such.
"Kemba Walker will be remembered like the Bobcats' version of Mark Price, but without the occasional reminder from the record books."
Prime Kemba Walker &gt; Prime Klay Thompson
"Wtf is this sub's definition of a role player?  Role players don't average 20+ points per game, and role players don't start every single game in their career.  What's next?  Is Kemba Walker a role player?"
"There was a lot of debate about him and Irving at the draft, who will be picked up at first and second pick. Such an incredible athlete.  Wonder what happened to him, as in why he didn't continue to become a good player.  Maybe in a different environment like Spurs, he would have thrived.  Just reading some of the comments in the chat about the draft talent.... Interesting what some reports provided on the players including Kemba Walker, Leonard, Klay Thompson, to name a few that went outside the top 5 picks. https://www.nbadraft.net/2011-extended-mock-draft/  Kanter was a top 3 talent and Butler went pick 30. yikes"
Pretty clear Julius Randle is on track for mvp while kemba Walker return to a 20+ and 9 ast a game all star is there feel good story of the year. RJ earns the first Knicks pick resigned since Charlie ward and the Knicks have to figure out how we can afford to keep Mitch Robinson after leading league in fg% again + top 3 in blocks.
I was about to mention the same player.  Dude was a legit flamethrower for a good 4-5 year stretch with the Bulls.  He was like a Kemba Walker who was forced to play off-ball.
Kemba Walker will be an All-Star.
"Regarding Kemba, his knee and the weird schedule this past year didn't do him any favors, but when he did play he had some decent stats. You can see in his splits, his games with two days of rest were much better than those with one. The hope is that in NY he's not asked to play as many minutes, which improves his efficiency and keeps him healthy.   That's a long winded way of saying I agree that Kemba has shown enough  that you can see him getting another decent deal in two years, while Love's prior season and Team USA showing has done the opposite for him. Maybe a team thinks they can pull off something like Blake to the Nets, but it would mean bringing Love into a team with a star who can motivate him and hold him accountable, and which teams are willing to risk getting unmotivated Love for whatever upside he might have left?   https://www.espn.com/nba/player/splits/\_/id/6479/kemba-walker"
"He hasn't been a Laker since 2018. His dead money is still on their cap, but Deng is not a Laker anymore than Kemba Walker is a member of the Thunder or Blake Griffin is a Piston. Deng was bought out and went to go play for the Wolves after that and then he retired."

"The link I posted has the stats. Since you obviously didn't bother (probably because of your Steph colored glasses.) I put what was relevant below. I'll grant this... It basically says that Steph is a below average to poor defender (by every metric) BPM, RPM and FiveThirtyEights DRAYMOND and those adjusted for DRAYMOND. Problem is, in the playoffs he faces above average to excellent guards. Those PGs and SGs hunt matchups with Steph because to them, he's an easy mark.  **From the article...**  &gt;These are some pretty interesting lists. Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There‚Äôs also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic Cases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents‚Äô shooting data than what we‚Äôve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Guards....**  Kemba Walker	-0.80	-0.10	+0.70  Isaiah Thomas	-2.62	-1.99	+0.63  Raymond Felton	-0.74	-0.13	+0.61  Jaylen Brown	+0.11	+0.71	+0.6  Klay Thompson	-0.91	-0.34	+0.57  Matthew Dellavedova	-1.16	-0.60	+0.56  Jrue Holiday	+0.72	+1.25	+0.54  Jeremy Lin	-0.41	+0.04	+0.45  Mike Conley	-0.38	+0.06	+0.44  Derrick Rose	-2.11	-1.68	+0.43  JJ Redick	-1.66	-1.25	+0.41  Gerald Green	-1.82	-1.44	+0.38  Eric Gordon	-1.76	-1.41	+0.35  Goran Dragic	-0.92	-0.61	+0.32  James Harden	-0.33	-0.02	+0.31  Bradley Beal	-0.95	-0.64	+0.30  CJ McCollum	-1.18	-0.89	+0.29  Mario Chalmers	+0.25	+0.53	+0.28  Jarrett Jack	-1.23	-0.98	+0.25  Aaron Gordon	+0.27	+0.52	+0.25  Devin Booker	-2.76	-2.51	+0.25  Spencer Dinwiddie	-1.30	-1.07	+0.23  Reggie Bullock	-0.91	-0.69	+0.22  Austin Rivers	-1.70	-1.49	+0.21  Dennis Schroder	-2.10	-1.91	+0.19  Lou Williams	-2.83	-2.64	+0.18  Deron Williams	-0.92	-0.74	+0.17  Tim Hardaway Jr.	-2.23	-2.07	+0.16  Jason Terry	-0.54	-0.42	+0.12  Jordan Clarkson	-2.79	-2.68	+0.11  Wesley Matthews	-0.46	-0.35	+0.11  Donovan Mitchell	+0.26	+0.34	+0.08  ***Stephen Curry	+0.33	+0.39	+0.06***  Khris Middleton	-0.17	-0.11	+0.06  Nick Young	-2.61	-2.56	+0.05  Shaun Livingston	+0.18	+0.21	+0.03  Paul George	+1.30	+1.32	+0.03  Buddy Hield	-1.61	-1.59	+0.02  Jae Crowder	+0.38	+0.39	+0.01  J.J.

"Why would he have a bigger role? He'd have the same role. Kemba Walker isnt on the Celtics anymore, you know..."
I think you are severely underrating the addition of those two players especially when you consider who they are replacing. Kemba Walker is replacing Elfrid fucking Payton who was easily the worst starter on a playoff team last year. Drose coming on to the starting lineup ended up scrambling our second unit and making them really ineffective. Trae Young was able to hide and rest on defense because Reggie Bullock can‚Äôt dribble. You saw what he did on a 2-1 fast break in that series smfh. Replacing him with Fournier means the Trae has no where to hide. I would agree with you that our rookies aren‚Äôt going to have a big impact unless one of them really break out and Thibs gives them big mins. RJ is really the swing factor. If he has the 3rd year star wing leap then we would be in great shape. And finally we have Mitchell Robinson. He is the biggest defensive and even offensive piece we missed last year. He is one of the best if not the best lob catcher in the league which would force Capela to not shade Randle whenever he has the ball. Mitch is also one of the best rebounders in the league. His overall rebounding numbers don‚Äôt show it on the surface but he led the league in box outs and the Knicks were the best rebounding team in the league when he was healthy. All this to say that it will be a far more interesting series if we play next year and I hope it happens.
1- GSW should rebuild trading all his best players 2- Bucks will not win another ring in the next 3 seasons (at least) 3- kemba walker is bad sign for the knicks (hopefully i‚Äôm wrong)
"Credit to OP for the awesome structure and idea.  Starting LineUp:  PG: Kemba Walker 10  SG: James Harden 38  SF: LeBron James 39  PF: Marcus Morris 12  C: Nerlens Noel 8  Bench:  Guards: Grayson Allen 4  Wings: Josh Hart 6  Bigs: Bobby Portis 3  First of all I wanted to say awesome job OP, definitely looks like you worked hard on this list and I like it. Also, side note I think you mistook Troy Brown Jr for Bruce Brown Jr. I probably spent more time than I should‚Äôve at this so I hope you guys enjoy.  Anyways, for my team. I went with the approach that‚Äôs been working most for basically the past decade and more now, LeBron plus shooting and playmaking.  Team Reasons:  My strategy was picking up guys who I thought was the best bang for your buck, who I thought were huge steals and honestly I think a lot of these guys are undervalued.  Kemba Walker for 10 is a steal, this is still someone with excellent on ball and off ball guard ability who can average 20ish PPG in that role doing so. He can take pressure off Harden &amp; LeBron.  James Harden is I think the best SG in the game and his scoring and playmaking ability never to someone like LeBron would be amazing like we‚Äôve seen similarly with Chris Paul in the past. He‚Äôd make everyone around him better and scores with ease.  LeBron James age may hurt him but I‚Äôm a strong believer in him. I think he‚Äôll still be as good as ever and at the very highest a step slower but that‚Äôs still a damn good player. His playmaking ability next to this team will be huge.  Marcus Morris for 12 is a huge steal. He averaged 20ish PPG on the Knicks and is an amazing shooter who‚Äôs proven he can play with multiple wings as a small ball C or a wing in general.  Nerlens Noel is someone who I think can thrive as a starter especially next to James Harden. His defence is definitely good enough to sustain a starting spot.  Bench:  Grayson Allen I think is someone who you undervalued OP because he was a starter on a playoff team who averaged 11 PPG shooting lights out from 3, 39% making 2 a game. He also has good enough playmaking ability and to do stuff off the dribble.  Bobby Portis per 36 stats last season he was second in the league in points off the bench and first in rebounding for 3 BP is amazing. Good floor spacer too if Nerlens isn‚Äôt playing well.  Josh Hart or Terrence Ross I couldn‚Äôt decide between. They‚Äôre the same price but I‚Äôm not sure if Ross as a 6th man is a better fit or Hart as a small ball lineup player. I think id go with Hart because of his rebounding even though TRoss is a bigger name.  I think this team has the perfect amount of playmaking, scoring, floor spacing and just enough defence to help them. I‚Äôd honestly say this is the best team anyone can come up with but I do not wanna get ahead of myself."
Kemba Walker is extremely overrated and should never got the contract he got.
1. Dennis Schroder/ minutes for Payton Pritchard is an upgrade over Kemba Walker  2. Tyrese Haliburton is better than De‚Äôaron Fox (this might not be unpopular)  3. Ben Simmons/tyrese Maxey/ Jaden Springer/ Thybulle/ 1 2022 first for Lillard makes the Blazers better in 2023 than they would be just with Lillard in that season (coming from a die hard Blazer fan)   4. Jalen Suggs has the best career in the rookie class  5. Twolves are top 6 seed in 2022 playoffs  6. Knicks miss the 2022 playoffs  7. Wizards make the playoffs  8. Detroit Pistons make the playin tourney (10 seed)  9. Hornets get top 4 playoff seed in 2022  10. Lamelo Ball makes one of the all NBA teams in 2022.  Not sure I actually believe all of these but I‚Äôm pretty sure all are somewhat unpopular and I can at least see them maybe happening.   Would love to hear which are most realistic.   Edit: fixing a couple typos
"Kemba ""Needsa"" Walker"
Kemba Walker isn‚Äôt the player he used to be in CLT and the Knicks will be a 6-8 seed
"I certainly think you are more likely to finish 3-5, but we don't know how the roster changes are going to play out.   ____  **Bulls**: Added DeRozan, Lonzo, Caruso, and Bradley  * Biggest wild card, especially when you remember Vuc only played 26 games in Chicago last season. You can't say you're better than this team because we've never seen this team.  **Knicks** Added Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier   * Last year you beat them 3-1, but it's undeniable that Kemba and Evan are a massive upgrade to their stagnant offense. I think you probably are still better, but I'm not going to say 100%.  **Heat**: Added Kyle Lowry, PJ Tucker, and Markieff Morris   * The Heat were another team last year that was plagued with injuries and covid protocol. Add onto that some massive wins in free agency and I don't see how anyone could say you are definitely better.  **Celtics**: Added Dennis, Horford, and JRich, Lost Kemba and Fournier  * The biggest reason I included the Celtics is because last year they had very few games where they all played together. Brown was injured late in the season while Smart also missed 25 games due to injury. Kemba was never particularly effective with their units, so I think that the additions they made made them better than they were last year. This is another fringe case, but I don't think you can say you are definitely the better team."
RJ Barrett will have the best career out of anyone from the 2019 draft.   He was the second best payer as a sophomore on a 4th seeded team that this offseason got significantly better by replacing Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. RJ himself has shown an incredible amount of progress and commitment to keeping that progress going.   Ja Morant‚Äôs Grizzlies will continue to be too good to get another high pick while also not being good enough to compete for a title. The Pelicans failed to make the play-in tournament twice and Zion will ultimately have his talents wasted there like AD and CP3
"MJs real obsession is just with college guys who were NCAA tournament stars or who had lots of hype in college.   Since he took over with final basektball say in 2006   2006: Adam Morrison---NCAA star tons of hype   2008: DJ Augustin--1st team all American, SI cover boy  2009: Gerald Henderson--Dukie well known commodity especially amongst people in North Carolina   2011: Kemba Walker: Tourney hero rare pick that worked out like this   2013: Cody Zeller: All American, on a no 1 seed Indiana team  2015: Frank Kaminsky: Big name on a Wisconsin team that made the Finals  2017: Malik Monk: SEC player of the year, shooting/scorer on an elite 8 Kentucky team.  The scouting drafting process is akin to what I wouldve done in high school ""Who was the flashiest biggest name most recently on a stage like the NCAA tournament that's left? That's who I want""."
Kemba walker
I'm rooting so hard for Kemba Walker to taste some redemption after a weird stint with the Celtics.
"Go, my king. I will forever root for Kemba Walker, even if I don‚Äôt particularly like the team he‚Äôs on."
"This is incorrect.  Only the starting value of a contract is affected by the salary cap, with each subsequent year being a 5% or 8% raise.  The dollar values of contracts that are already in force are not changed when the cap increases.  If Harden/Kyrie get their extensions now, they will indeed take up a smaller percentage of the cap if we have an increase down the line.  This is why max players will still ask for trade kickers.  A kicker can't boost your salary above the maximum you're eligible for in your age band, BUT if there's a cap spike and suddenly the max allowable for your age group goes up, you can use exercise that kicker in a trade to make up some of the difference.  Kemba Walker is a good example.  People seemed to think that he would cost $41 million if traded because of his 15% kicker, but he was already at the max for a 9 year player so it just disappeared when he was moved to OKC.  However, if we had a huge salary cap spike this season and suddenly players with his service time were able to make up to $40 million, he could have exercised it to boost his salary."
"And more‚Ä¶.  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  ‚Ä¢ Latest free agency and trade news and buzz ‚Ä¢ Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move ‚Ä¢ Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this ‚Ä¢ NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next ‚Ä¢ Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"2019 is probably be the goat offseason. 2016-18 were all pretty crazy too but 2019 was nuts  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Jimmy Butler  Paul George  Anthony Davis  Chris Paul   Russell Westbrook   Kemba Walker   ALL switched teams, and more then a few of them were pretty unpredictable"

"You‚Äôre forgetting the part where Kemba Walker is a significantly inferior player in every possible way to Kyrie Irving lol, stop acting like they‚Äôre comparable.  Kemba fell off hard because he was never actually that good to begin with. Kyrie would need 1 leg amputated before he‚Äôs at the same level as Kemba Walker"
"This is a big tier, honestly probably the most interesting reveal of the whole thing.   The grinders tier I think is full of guys who have different skill sets. Aaron Gordon is on the list of guys who the idea of the player exceeds the reality not a fan. Think Marcus Smart is the best of that group by a distance dont think Jae Crowder or Aaron Gordon are in the category of as valuable as OG Anunoby or Smart. I actually think both Smart and Anunoby are better than Mikal Bridges.   This is putting ALOT of faith in a 17 game sample size of DeAndre Hunter and just ignoring a bad rookie year. Im not ready to go there at all. He talks about the perils of projecting with young players with Ayton and how if the season were 4 games shorter he might be higher we all overreact to small samples with young players all the time.   Damn he did it again after talking about not overvaluing stretch bigs putting Myles Turner this high lol. This is also putting too much faith in Robert Covington for my money who fouls everybody and has fallen off on ball defensively. A little high for Kemba Walker but I  dont hate it pendulum has swung too far against him."
"I thought the 30th pick was from Milwaukee via Phoenix as part of the Aron Baynes cap dump when they opened a bunch of space for Kemba Walker.  Either way, dumping Bane for more future seconds (which I believe they used on that half a season of Fournier) was a waste"
"Can't disagree with us being Tatum/Brown reliant but we were Tatum/Brown reliant last year. We should get better barring major issues. Mainly because the key guys we're losing weren't actually playing much to begin with.   * Kemba missed the first 15 games and then was a net negative during the next 15 as he got back into shape. From then on he was actually really good but missed 13 of the remaining 42 games.   When he was good he was really good, but we didn't even get 30 games out of him.   * Fournier only played 16 games for us with a covid infection in the middle. He had 4 games getting acquainted with the team, then 12 games playing through the residual symptoms of covid.     He just never had a chance to settle in.  We actually never had a single game all season with Kemba, Smart, Fournier, Brown and Tatum playing.   Horford and Richardson should be able to contribute more than Walker and Fournier over the course of a full season, just by virtue of being able to play &gt;45 games each.   Plus we didn't really lose anyone off our bench (one of the youngest benches in the league) and we'll hopefully get some more production from them as they gain some more experience."
"ESPN: Kemba Walker hates money, sources say"
"the rest of the world saw ""Kemba Walker gets traded to OKC...""  OKC saw: ""First round pick and less important things get traded to OKC..."""
And have to spend his time convincing himself that Ball is gonna end up being the next Kemba Walker and that he‚Äôll finally get them a Division Title?
"Walker didn't leave any money on the table. Between the knicks and the thunder, he's making the same amount.  He gave the thunder an 8M/yr discount because the knicks offered him that 8M/yr so the thunder saved 16M but Kemba didn't lose any money"
"Still have no fucking idea why Ainge drafted a sub 6' shooting guard with such a high second rounder.   Actually I love telling the story of how they drafted Carsen Edwards because it's such a clusterfuck:  2019 draft night - Boston owns #20 which ends up being Matisse Thybulle. Boston has 3 first rounders that night so they're kind of forced to trade out.  Boston trades #20 for #24 (Ty Jerome) and #33 (Carsen Edwards). #24 ends up getting traded along with Aron Baynes to Phoenix to free up cap space to overpay Kemba Walker. Phoenix has a protected 2020 first from Milwaukee that they give to Boston.  2020 draft night - Boston's first from the previous trade is #30 which ends up being Desmond Bane (all rookie team, mind you). That pick is immediately traded to Memphis for future second rounders.  Those future second rounders are traded for a half a season of Evan Fournier. Boston then traded their 2021 FRP (#16) along with Kemba Walker to OKC for Al Horford and to free up cap space which they were hopefully going to use to re-sign Fournier. Fournier dipped for the bag.  So long story short, Boston squandered those picks (and ended up giving another pick away) for pretty much nothing."
"Most Improved: Miami Heat =&gt; Bulls  Best offseason: Washington Wizards (hell no, I'm biased but I vote Hawks. Retained all key players and bench pieces, while getting to while touted rookies that dropped a lot and have huge potential)  Worst offseason: New Orleans Peicans (that's fair)  Best value contract: Lonzo Ball, Chicago Bulls  (that's fair or even a slight overpay, I'd say DRose is a better player for less money)  Best value contract (buyout division): Kemba Walker, New York Knicks (seems alright)  Best value contract (minimum division): Otto Porter, Golden State Warriors (also a decent pick)  Worst value contract: DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls (Khem Birch 3/20 is way worse imo, that dude is a third stringer at best)  Best fit: Reggie Bullock, Dallas Mavericks (decent pick)  Worst fit: Robin Lopez, Orlando Magic (okayish pick, Drummond is probably worse though)  Best gettable free agent remaining: Dennis Schroder (definitely right.)"
"The Hornets signing Terry Rozier to a 3 year 58 Million Dollar contract. Especially, since they decided not to extend Kemba Walker to a more than Max contract   Two years later, Terry Rozier is underpaid and Boston had to trade the 16th pick in the draft in order to get off of Kemba‚Äôs contract."
"Celtics: No way we are paying an undersized,injury prone point guard big money!  Kemba Walker: Hold my beer!"
Max contract Kemba Walker lol
"2019 FIBA World Cup team was pretty weak:  Derrick White, Donovan Mitchell, Joe Harris, Marcus Smart, Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Mason Plumlee, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker"
"As a Celtics fan, I can tell you this: Healthy Kemba Walker and Current Kemba Walker are two different players. If the Knicks get the same level of health and coddling we had to deal with last year, then no, he's a glorified bench player. He can still give you 20 points, but he's going to DNP for half of the games. If his knee allows him to play a ""normal"" number of games without minutes restrictions or days off, then they stole a 20 PPG scorer and between him and Fournier they have plenty of help for Randle to take some of the ballhandling responsibilities off of his shoulders.   That's about the biggest ""IF"" in the league currently though, and Celtics fans told ourselves ""if"" he was healthy we would be all set for the past two years as well..."
"Better than jeff Teague, worse than kemba walker"
"They're replacing Elfrid Paytons non production with Kemba Walker, that's a huge upgrade.  Not elite, but barring a ton of injuries, they should be around 50 wins. Forniere is an upgrade over Reggie.  Big Meech,Obi,Quickley and RJ should also get better. Another year with Thibs and bringing back most of roster should help as well."
"You could make an argument none of those guys would even play on the Knicks.  At best all would be spot minute guys.  You could make the case for Howard and maybe Melo or Ariza as a back up PF playing 10-15 minutes a game over Obi Toppin.  Bazemore and Ellington would be a 4th wing. With Quickley, Rose, and Kemba likely seeing some time at the 2 both of those guys would be our 3rd SF.  Nunn would of got some real burn (maybe even started) before getting Kemba Walker but after I have a hard time seeing where he would even play regular minutes on this roster. Nunn is a good player and a great signing. Howard is still very good for 20 minutes a night, but other than that not sure I would want any of those guys on the Knicks.  &amp;#x200B;  C Robinson   Noel  Gibson Sims  PF Randle Toppin Gibson Knox  SF Barrett Burks Knox Grimes  SG Fournier Quickley Rose Grimes   PG Kemba Rose Vildoza Mcbride"
Idk like in the 50s or 60s  Did you know Kemba Walker has a higher career high than KD and Kobe scored more in one half than KD ever has in a full game?
I think ceiling is 3rd seed behind Nets and the Bucks but a big part of that imo will be how healthy Kemba Walker is. I think our floor is the 6th through 8th
"If we did this for the NBA's entire history Westbrook would be a 3X all star, Tony Parker would have like 1, Arenas would have like 7, the Russell Celtics would only have been known to have 2 different all stars (Bill sometimes, Cousy other times) and Kemba Walker would be an 8x all star etc. Fun to think about though."
Are you only counting players who made the most recent All-NBA list?  Cause Kemba Walker is an All-NBA player in 2019 who got traded from the Celtics to the Thunder this offseason. Then got bought out and signed with the Knicks.
That‚Äôs definetly not true about the Knicks lol what are you smoking? They have the same roster as last year but replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier
"The league is stupid... the national bullshit association... when kemba Walker and Andre Drummond sign for the fucking minimum?!?! Just to go with their buddies to win a chip.. I'm done.. you see max deals or min deals.. the economics of this league are as if handled by a drug dealer .. it's pure stupid. If a team has 3 or 4 decent players ,, they get like 20 mill and that gives the team not enough Cap space to sign a ""max"" player... but then you have the teams on the beaches that guys will go to just to win and sign for nothing.. or negotiate buyouts etc.. it's a stupid league.. . It's the ultimate equivalent of you and your boys trying to run a rec league title and stacking your team. The good cities dont don't play by the same cap rules.."
"No one has any clue what they're talking about. Monta Ellis is a slightly less volume version of Kemba Walker. Both short so both have the same weakness on defense. Stat for stat their offense is pretty similar outside of volume. Their ability is the same, their play style is as close as it gets."
"We replaced Reggie bullock with Evan Fournier and we added kemba walker instead of Elfrid Payton and we didn‚Äôt improve? ü§£ you‚Äôre too much. Refer to the last line of my previous comment   Also, no one was signing with the Lakers when they were shit in the 2010s. Were they a small market during that time?"
Kemba walker is injured and a shell of his old self and a year older now. I love my boy d rose but he‚Äôs a year older he deserves his contract he got. Noel is good but has alot of holes in his game. Then alec burke is meh. Taj is also getting older. Id rather have Westbrook in this situation.
"Because Kemba Walker and Nerlens Noel are the quintessential ""winning basketball players""..."
"There's a reason Presti goes out of his way to take care of players that come through OKC.  Straight up, show me an interview where any player criticizes OKC. They, every single time, talk about how professional and welcoming the organization is.  Presti and the front office are completely aware that Oklahoma City is not a big destination for players, so they put the effort in to take care of our guys. Whenever we make a trade, we send players where they wanted to go. PG chose LA, Russ wanted to join Harden in Houston, CP3 liked the idea of being the floor general for the Suns, Horford wanted to go back to Boston, hell even Kemba ""never played a game for the Thunder"" Walker worked with us so he could go to the Knicks.  On top of that, word is that the young guns that have been going through OKC during our tank have all been positive about it. Why not? OKC is giving them opportunities to play that they wouldn't have gotten elsewhere, and now they've got a foot in the door in the league. Ask Moses Brown how it felt to get real playing time in OKC, and now he's got a guaranteed contract and likely playing time for the Celtics."
Mitchell robinson  Kevin Knox  Kemba walker
"And 4 time all star Kemba Walker was just released for nothing by his team. That doesn‚Äôt mean those all star selections were wrong. It means he isn‚Äôt the same player he was at that time.  Paschall earned his selection that year, but has not progressed as he should have, while Barrett has progressed."
Kemba Walker absolutely drains any shot in the clutch I would take any shot from him lmao
The issue with Kemba Walker is if he‚Äôs not scoring he‚Äôs absolutely worthless. He‚Äôs only scoring about half the time and that Knee has gotten a lot worse.
MJ with Kemba Walker.
D Rose and Kemba Walker on NY? How the fuck is gonna work?
"&gt;I'm not a big fan of Kemba Walker. I don't think he's an NBA starter. I see him having a similar career as Jerryd Bayless, minus the defense.   Oh dear."
"just because he was a bench player in 2012 doesn't mean he didn't have a big role + play terrible in the road games in the finals.   You're ignoring him choking in elimination games in 2013  &gt;2015 lmao you‚Äôre brushing off an entire fucking playoff run because Josh smith and Corey Brewer made a couple threes  they didn't just hit a couple threes lmao the rockets season was over until harden got benched and brewer and smith combined for 29 points in the 4th quarter, and erased the 17 point lead the clippers built because harden was playing like ass (in an elimination game. Color me shocked)  &gt;(2015) I know you didn‚Äôt even watch but go back and look at games 1 and 2 at Oracle. Harden is doing everything hitting big shot after big shot... He was good in that series overall and only had 2 bad games  He still continued his trend of being horrific in elimination games. And ""only"" having 2 bad games in a 5 game series is pretty significant. Also, terrible/horrific/awful is a more accurate description of his 2 ""bad"" games.  &gt;(2017) Also, he had a concussion.  Lmao yeah totally man. The way rocket fans cope is pathetic. 0 evidence of this + he was so concussed that [he was caught in the club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJSuJ0B5pzE) (notice the flashing lights lol) the night of his game 6 choke  &gt;2018 Jesus Christ you can‚Äôt possibly blame him losing to 4 allstars as the only one?  I certainly put some blame on him for blowing double digit halftime leads in both games 6 and 7 + disappearing in the 4th quarter of G6.  2020 you're ignoring him continuing his trend of choking in elimination games (this time game 7 vs OKC) again. And yeah he was good in the first 3 quarters in games from the lakers series until he disappeared in the 4th.  tyler herro put up 19/6/5 on the celtics on 63% TS in the ecf last year btw, including a 37 point game. Congrats to harden on being able to put up good numbers on walking BBQ chicken known as Evan Fournier and the ghost of Kemba Walker."

"Semi-related, but on that last point‚Ä¶  James Harden wasn‚Äôt the instigator he‚Äôs been framed to be. The ‚Äúbeef‚Äù started with Giannis‚Äôs comments during the All-Star draft.   In 2019, Harden never went out and said that Giannis didn‚Äôt deserve MVP. Obviously he‚Äôs going to say he himself should be MVP, but he said nothing to discredit Giannis‚Äôs season, or him as a player. During the All-Star Draft in 2020, Giannis said Harden doesn‚Äôt pass the ball, and slighted him by picking ‚Äúcrossover killer, step-back master, Kemba Walker‚Äù over him. Naturally, Harden went out and defended himself. Only then did Harden call out Giannis‚Äôs ‚Äúrun and dunk‚Äù game.  And objectively, on offense, Giannis‚Äôs playstyle requires magnitudes less skill than Harden‚Äôs, most wing shooters, or bigs with post moves.  Giannis is still an incredible player, and he‚Äôs insanely gifted and skilled in different aspects of the game than Harden. But Harden‚Äôs comments aren‚Äôt as outrageous as people make them out to be."
"I usually have [BOS] Kemba Walker as my flair, so I know where you‚Äôre coming from, but it seems like Dame doesn‚Äôt try on defense."
Lmao OKC literally gave *up* assets for Al Horford and a top 6 protected first  less than a year ago.   You gotta watch some more NBA transactions my guy. This is like the most common move in basketball lmao. They just did it AGAIN like a month ago with Kemba Walker!!

"Sengun because they can develop him behind Poetl and with Collins signing in this proposed prediction, it makes center probably their weakest area ‚Äî Murray, White, Johnson, Collins, Poetl (if they don‚Äôt end up with Kemba).  Walker to Spurs for Murray, 16, 18, and future FRP is something I have thought would be a feasible trade but I know Spurs fans will murder me if I speak of it any further"
"Ok I agree that this team needs a PG more than anything, but y‚Äôall talking like Duncan doesn‚Äôt add anything don‚Äôt know basketball. He‚Äôs one of the best in the league at getting open off-ball. All of the ‚Äú3 point shooters‚Äù on this team are actually isolation egomaniacs who just stand around and jerk off when the ball isn‚Äôt in their hands. They‚Äôd be better off giving minutes to someone like Duncan than the 9th best iso joe on the roster Kemba Walker, or Kevin ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù Love"
"If some team with cap space is desperate to overpay for a point guard, do you really think Schroder will be the guy they target? I would think that Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, or even Kemba Walker would be better targets."
"That's true, but Schroder is also entering free agency as a point guard in a market which will be flooded with good available point guards. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills and even Kemba Walker (who could easily be had if a team has the cap space to absorb him). Are there really going to be teams out there lining up to throw tons of money at Dennis Schroder after the lackluster season he just had?  The flip side to you pointing out how guys like Deng and Mozgov got way overpaid is to look at guys like Jusuf Nurkic and how [he got way underpaid](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1015432798138662912?s=19) just because [he entered free agency at the wrong time.](http://es.pn/2ny4aRs) Schroder wants a ton of money but I have serious doubts that the market is going to be there for him."
"Yes, but if nobody offers him any kind of big contract then he isn't going to walk for less money elsewhere. He has to get at least one big offer to make his threat to walk credible, and he'll be competing with a bunch of other free agent point guards: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, etc. Kemba Walker could also easily be had with cap space if some team wanted to take him off OKC's hands. I think the odds of Schroder getting a big offer this summer are small."
"No it‚Äôs the GM that‚Äôs bringing in the crazies. He should know better. Especially about kyrie. I always knew walker was gonna fuck up their stuff. You have to have dame range to be good and that small. Kemba doesn‚Äôt have that.  The Tatum trade was epic, as was the fleecing of the nets, but the rest of the roster construction was medium af."
"I think Schroder is really gonna get screwed this summer. He gambled on himself by refusing the Lakers extension offer, and he really played like shit afterwards. Now he's left hoping a big market exists for him this summer, but he's a point guard in a free agent market flooded with available point guards this summer: Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (if a team with cap space wants to use it to absorb his deal). I really don't see any team making Schroder a big offer, which means he may need to just accept whatever he can get from the Lakers, which will almost surely be much less than the $84 million they offered him back in February."
"Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell, Hamidou Diallo, Obi Toppin, Taj Gibson or Mo Bamba"
"Lol. I didn't say anything of the sort.   Every year we get fans who delude themselves into thinking they'll get a great return for an unrestricted free agent in a sign and trade and it almost never happens. The Hornets got cash for Kemba Walker. The Celtics got cash for Gordon Hayward. The Nuggets got cash for Jerami Grant.   Usually when teams get more, it's because a player is a restricted free agent. The Bucks got three picks for Malcolm Brogdon because he was an RFA and they could match. The only UFA I can think of fetching a lot of value in a S&amp;T was prime LeBron James going to Miami. No UFA got a lot of value back for their teams in the last two years. If you can think of one before that, let me know.  I'm not saying Lowry is leaving Toronto. There's a really good chance he stays. I'm just saying if he's leaving Toronto, it's unlikely Toronto gets a lot back in a S&amp;T since that almost never happens."
"I doubt they'd need to include the pick, tbh. Jimmy Butler basically only commanded a salary match. Same with Kemba Walker to the Celtics. Gordon Hayward to Charlotte got a protected second. Jerami Grant got the Nuggets cash considerations.  That said, Indy gave up three picks, including a first for Brogdon. So it's not unheard of."
"TJ Warren is on par with 4x All-Star Kemba Walker? Kemba regressed due to injuries in the last 18 months, but he had a far and away better career up to this point than Warren."
"Lol yeah T.J. Warren has no fucking business on this list. He‚Äôs a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù...so he‚Äôs on par with Rudy Gay, Kemba Walker, and C.J. McCollum."
Flair checks out  He chose kemba Walker over harden and says he doesn‚Äôt pass lol
kemba walker
They could probably swing a 3 team trade involving Kemba Walker. He makes much more sense on this team since they need creation more than scoring.
That feel when Kemba Walker was their best player of the roster.
"&gt;He‚Äôs the best player ever for an NBA franchise. He‚Äôs in  Counterpoint: Kemba Walker   Dame will get in, but that's not the reason why"
"Ah yes, our talented roster of Jaylen Brown, hobbled Kemba Walker and...who?"
The offseason already start after the 2nd round. Mavs blowing up their front office. Danny Ainge quitting. Lillard getting hot. Simmons on the trading block. Kemba Walker traded.   All of this happened during the playoffs.
"Yea the Timberwolves are most likely not getting Ben Simmons, and we really shouldn't even be a main focus point of discussion. There are better trade scenarios that could be had without the Timberwolves being involved such as:     \-Malcom Brogdan  \-Kemba Walker  \-Lowry S&amp;T  \-CJ McCollum/Damien Lillard (unlikely)  \-Mike Conley S&amp;T  \-Collin Sexton     The only thing the Timberwolves truly have to offer is DLo, but even then I have a hard time figuring out why the 76ers would make that trade, unless they value the scoring aspects of DLo and are willing to look past his defensive struggles."
"Those guys are locked in also what do you mean weird, I guess with the point guards and Hayward‚Äôs injury, and the Kemba walker trade for Moses brown and Horford. But they really haven‚Äôt touched the young guys,"

&gt;The Celtics already started off with a big offseason news with trading away Kemba Walker for Al Horford  Lol. Probably won't make a difference.
"I'd consider a superstar to be a consensus top 10 player in the league, and I don't think Charlotte has ever had one. The 90s Hornets had a lot of low to mid tier all-stars but never a top 10 player.  The single best individual season in franchise history belongs to one of Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Kemba Walker, or Al Jefferson. None would be considered superstars by any stretch at that time.  So that's 31 seasons of no superstars, 33 if you want to count the two year gap where Charlotte had no team. That has to take the cake, right?"
"Donovan Mitchell, Derrick White, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner, Mason Plumlee, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Smart, and Joe Harris.  Not the best team we could have sent, but they definitely should have finished better than 7th."
"Recent History shows the 9th pick as a real mixed bag, for what's its worth, all these players are still playing today (Vonleh might not last past this season). Only 3 of them were basically back ups from the start.  2010: Gordon Hayward (Utah, signed an extension) 15.6/4.5/3.5, made an all star game; 685 games played  2011: Kemba Walker (Charlotte, signed an extension) 19.9/3.8/5.4, multiple all star games, an all nba team; 704 games played  2012: Andre Drummond (Pistons, signed an extension) 14.5/13.7/1.4, all star, all nba, rebounding leader; 645 games played  2013: Trey Burke - starter, then quickly role player  2014: Noah Vonleh - role player, now third stringer  2015: Frank Kaminsky - role player  2016: Jakob Poetl - role player, current starter (usually)  2017: Dennis Smith Jr - starter, now role player  2018: Kevin Knox - role player  2019: Rui Hachimura - starter  2020: Deni Advija - role player"
"Beyond Jamal Murray a healthy Kemba Walker but that's alas a thing of the past and you saw how a diminished Kemba hurt Boston in this regard. Lowry would help in that he moves off ball better, has real gravity from 3(unlike Jrue) and is a better passer but still feels like they need a more creative dynamic scorer. Lowry is 80% 3s+layups for shit profile and not a consistent half court scorer as is.  But alas this is also the issue finding a guy to do all these things, and Lowry would still help youre right. If we're thinking lesser non all star versions of this guys like Kevin Huerter, Collin Sexton, Malik Beasley, Devonte Graham, Goran Dragic, Tim Hardaway. The only of those guys though who might even be remotely realistic is Graham, who will help but at some point if you can only shoot 44% at the rim that's so detrimental in a playoff setting it might just entirely cancel out whatever benefits he provides."
I doubt SGA will be at the Point next year. Remember Kemba Walker is on the Thunder now so he will probably be the 1 and SGA will move back to the 2.
"Ben Gordon, the spiritual bridge between Rip Hamilton and Kemba Walker, an undersized Bradley Beal with the scoring ability of a Montae Ellis Donovan Mitchell hybrid, with CJ McCollums shooting on Jamal Murray type range, would‚Äôve been the ideal pairing for a guard like prime d-rose in today‚Äôs modern NBa."
Jrue Holiday might start to give Kemba Walker vibes if he stays so inconsistent. I hope they both get back to their best and healthiest though
People are talking about how we'd need to trade SGA to do it and all I can think about is how in the hell Presti is gonna get us the 1st Pick for Kemba Walker and a 2nd  Swear that man could sell a family their own car and have them come away happy
"What moves are you making to compete soon? They literally traded an expiring player to get 2 years of max Kemba Walker. Who‚Äôs taking that contract? And what star are they going to get that will commit to them, they traded for Paul George and he asked out after 2 seasons.   For OKC to actually contend again they are gonna have to do it through the draft like they did with Harden, Durant and Westbrook. That means it‚Äôs gonna be a few years of tanking. The extra draft picks are nice because they go deep into the 2020‚Äôs but for now it‚Äôs tanking time  I‚Äôm not saying trade Alexander just to do it but if Edwards or Cunningham are on the table there is no way in hell OKC declines that"
"How about this, defensive RAPTOR rates Kemba Walker as a better defender than Jaylen Brown. They each started all their games, and they both even played for the same team."
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted. Siakam and Beal haven‚Äôt indicated they want to leave so you‚Äôd have to wow the team for them to trade their star player. Wiggins is a negative contract and would need a pick to be traded regardless (see Kemba Walker who couldn‚Äôt even be given away for free) and the 7th pick in a 4-5 player draft + one of the worst statistical rookies in the last 20 years coming off an injury that prevents him from having any skill development in the offseason is not appealing. I wouldn‚Äôt even take that for Siakam unless Wiggins was expiring
You're talking about Kemba Walker lmao
"Kawhi Leonard, Kemba Walker, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson... They're assembling the 2011 draft class!"
Kemba Walker regress to Kemba Sitter.
"I disagree with the premise that Walker was a bad fit on the Celtics. Injuries took him out and when he came back his shooting was god awful. Had nothing to do with his play not fitting. He was still getting good looks and all that  Kemba could fit on any team when he‚Äôs healthy. His whole game is unguardable shooting. He comes off a pick and puts a 3 up near instantly and can do the same if he‚Äôs given an inch of space.  Of course, he‚Äôs a liability on defense, but his whole value would be good on any team. I would have been shocked if he got traded after shooting well in the playoffs. The Celtics are a contender next year and don‚Äôt want tons of cap space wrapped up in someone inconsistent  For that reason I doubt the LA teams will pick him up as he seems like a perfect pick for a middling team willing to take a risk on a player who can be an absolute weapon on offense if healthy"
"No. Thanks for asking.  I disagree with you however.  I do not believe Kawhi's decision is altered by Kemba Walker.  You can disagree with me, it's fine. I don't need to insinuate that you're ""nuts"". It's just a difference of opinion."
Kemba Walker for KCP and Harrell
Mitch Richmond and Kemba Walker.  Probably have the lowest winning percentages.
"The draft lottery isn't rigged, and the Bobcats land Anthony Davis to pair with Kemba Walker.  Or we just draft some one not named Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  Or we accept that Celtics offer of four first rounders instead of taking Frank Kaminsky, aka a tall white guy that MJ loves so much.  Or a well-known one, the Hornets don't *trade Kobe Bean Bryant away*. Of course,big not, he would've ended up in New Orleans once they moved,bso technically he still wouldn't have much Kobe history in Charlotte basketball"
Did YOU read it? Because all that post is saying is that he‚Äôs a a good PG but not elite.  We just had a season of Kemba Walker and smart was easily a better playmaker than him.
Kemba (Dad) Walker
"kemba walker is making $36M.  okc is not going to buy him out.  lakers only have 7 guys under contract so far for next year, 6 if harrell declines his option.  the 4 non-lebron/AD guys together are not even $31M in salary combined.  you can trade all those guys for kemba and then you'd only have turning-37-years-old-lebron, often-incapacitated-AD, and degenerative-arthritic-knees(? maybe just one knee)-kemba signed and they're already over the cap.  at that point they can only do re-signings, min salary guys, and probably-not-the-full-MLE to fill out the other 12 slots on the roster.  ""just manage the salary cap"" like it's that easy.  dinwiddie also wants to get paid on the same scale as schroder btw, but maybe if he gets to live in LA he'll accept the full normal MLE. maybe."
"Our offer for LaMarcus Aldridge was Kemba Walker this yr. 2 years ago would have been the only time to make that trade. 3 years ago we were in the playoffs and lost to the Nuggets in 7 games and easily could have won that series‚Ä¶4 years ago we had Kawhi and Aldridge and were a title threat.  2 of our current starters are from the Kawhi trade. The other is DeRozan who you keep writing off as getting nothing for, we may re-sign  him, or we may sign and trade him.   That value isn‚Äôt sunk at all. The Spurs haven‚Äôt really made any objective mistakes, have drafted well, have developed those picks even better, and have made 0 bad contracts w tons of cap space.  That isn‚Äôt failing at all, if people prefer to suck and rebuild that way, fine. But that doesn‚Äôt make people that disagree with you stupid or wrong."
"The Celtics definitely make some pretty blatantly cost cutting moves. Even their beat writers will tell you that they are very, *very* averse to paying the luxury tax. Two recent examples are the way they salary dumped Daniel Theis and Kemba Walker. They want to win and want to be competitive, of course, but they are definitely not all in in a ""damn the luxury tax"" kind of way like the other teams you listed are."
"In the 2019 FIBA World Cup the US had a roster that had Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Myles Turner and other NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich.  They didn't even make it to the Bronze game. They absolutely would not medal in the Olympics with those players."
Tbh they could probly get kemba walker with kuzma.
"Kemba walker, for sure"
They need a scorer. Even a Kemba Walker would help them tremendously.
Rumours say the Lakers are eyeing Spencer Dinwiddie or Kemba Walker.  Its the lakers. They are not forced to keep every player. They have always a pool of players who are willing to come.  You just have to manage the salary cap.
"**Everything the Boston Celtics did**  They acquired:  - Kemba Walker, whom they had to attach picks to trade away  - Enes Kanter, didn‚Äôt move the needle  - Vincent Poirier, didn‚Äôt move the needle    They Drafted: - Romeo Langford (No. 14 pick) - Grant Willaims (No. 22 pick) - Carsen Edwards (No. 33 pick, via 76ers) - Tremont Waters (No. 51 pick)  Not one of those players turned into something good.    They Lost:  - Kyrie Irving (signed with Nets) - Terry Rozier (trade with Hornets) - Al Horford (signed with 76ers) - Marcus Morris (signed with Knicks) - Aron Baynes (trade with Suns)  That‚Äôs a legit squad to lose. Sure, things didn‚Äôt work out chemistry wise, but the Celtics are back to square 1 with less assets than before and their coach and GM are both gone(retired/promoted)"
Poor mans Kemba Walker. I forgot about him honestly. He definitely didn‚Äôt get the chance to show he could run an offense efficiently but I can understand the concerns higher ups had about him in the league.
"kemba walker, Joe ingles, Michael Carter Williams, Aaron Gordon, Kevin love"

You can‚Äôt compete for a championship with Kemba Walker taking up 37 million of your cap
Kemba Walker is the most overrated player in recent years. He's garbage. We shipped off Lou Williams to get another one?

"There's a chance I could pursue Kemba Walker too. You know, just like to say hi or whatever."
So this is the Battle of Los Angeles we were promised? *Pursuing Kemba Walker in free agency?*
"The run to the Finals has been unreal, but not necessarily historic. The Bubble Suns were something else entirely. It was like the Kemba Walker takeover at UConn, but in the NBA."
"Bev is an expiring ($14.3 mil).  Kennard's deal is 3 years and about $43 mil which isn't great and he's a defensive liability to put it lightly, but he is a 45% 3pt shooter who can handle the ball and create his own shot.  Add Rondo ($7.5 mil) and that's $21.8 mil worth of expirings and around $14.5 mil per year for a 25 year old shooter.  The salary is almost a perfect match for Kemba Walker."
"John Wall, Kemba Walker, Chandler Parsons - all much worse contracts than CP3."
"This is from December 1, 2020.  Your article is from the next day. Neither of which really show the Celtics did their due diligence considering Walker ended up having Knee issues all season.   &gt; The state of Walker‚Äôs knee was the elephant in the room behind those gaps in the rotation, and Ainge sounded positive when addressing it.  &gt; ‚ÄúI think this next year will tell us a lot more,‚Äù he suggested, noting Walker is ‚Äúon a program, and seems to be in a very good, happy spot.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúMaybe we didn‚Äôt do him justice by bringing him back too fast into the bubble, being hurt and finding some urgency to get him ready for the regular season.

"Kemba Walker and Charlotte. Still seems to be a lot of mutual love there. Hope he returns someday.  Either way, that #15 better hang up in Spectrum Center, or I'ma be disappointed"
Can we interest you in one Kemba Walker?
Kemba Walker for me.  He was in our division and mediocre at best until he learned how to flop.  Then his averages all started to go up as he was getting free points from the line and also players had to give him more space as they would get in foul trouble for the flopping.  Then on top of that all it's just made the game awful to watch for me.
Simmons for Kemba Walker? Lmfao.
"He also averaged 11 points in Orlando. Dude's a Rookie who had a lot of upside prior to the draft, give him time.   And as I mentioned above, Gary Harris can totally be flipped for a first - he's an expiring 20M contract on a rebuilding Magic team. If some team is desperate to get off a bad contract they can package a first along with it. Look at what Boston did with Kemba Walker."
"Gordon has more value to Denver than Barnes would. Gordon's not the star Orlando needed him to be and he fits that established role of a swiss-army knife guy for the Nuggets. He doesn't need be the third guy when you have Jokic, Murray and MPJ.   In that sense you can almost say he's overpaid for what he does especially since he's been a streaky 3-point shooter for his whole career (big wings will always get paid though).   And Gary Harris can totally be flipped for a first - he's an expiring 20M contract on a rebuilding Magic team. If some team is desperate to get off a bad contract they can package a first along with it. Look at what Boston did with Kemba Walker."
"We could trade Stephen Curry for Kemba Walker as well. Just no....downgrade at both positions for the Warriors. Actually, Bagley is probably slightly better than Wiseman with none of the potential/remaining rookie deal years. Still, hard pass."
They spelled kemba walker wrong
"Afraid to drive to the hoop based on one series? What about the rest of his career? He didn‚Äôt seem to have driving problems then. Don‚Äôt judge the player based on his last seven games!  And this isn‚Äôt just any point guard. This is a 6‚Äô10 point guard with passing comparable to LeBron (not as good, but comparable) and a handle to match.   Oh, and he is also a defensive player of the year candidate. Come on dude. Let‚Äôs stop acting like this guy is Russell Westbrook or Kemba Walker.   If Paul George goes for 5 first rounders then Ben Simmons certainly goes for 3."
"this is why i think people focus way too much on ainge, stevens, smart, the locker room, etc.  the celtics problems over the last 4 years have been really, really simple:  for 3 years they had arguably the worst contract in the NBA, Gordon Hayward, taking up a whole max slot, with just about 0 production (and you could argue that he was a net-negative for the entire 2018-2019 season).  Gordon Hayward leaves in Fall 2020.  Woohoo!  Except now we have arguably the worst contract in the NBA, Kemba Walker, taking up a whole max slot, with just about 0 production (and you could argue he was a net-negative for a lot of his time on the floor this season).  the best coach/GM combo in the world cannot overcome this in a salary cap era.  yes, i fully blame Ainge for signing an aging 5'11"" PG to a max contract in the first place.  but outside of that singular signing, idk what else in the world Ainge or Stevens could've done to make this team a championship contender.  they have been completely handicapped by wasting max contract slots."
"Boston is less in win now mode than Philly because of their young core (vs Embiid potentially suffering a serious injury). They actually don't believe he will be healthy and that he could have a degenerative knee condition.  They traded him and a first for Al fucking Horford, who himself required a pick to be dumped just a year earlier. That's how big of a drag Kemba's contract is.  https://www.masslive.com/celtics/2021/06/celtics-concerns-with-kemba-walker-started-due-to-lack-of-knee-rehab-ahead-of-nba-bubble-report.html"
&gt; What a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is that Kobe would protect Shaq in defending the pick and roll. Kobe fought like hell to go through screens to protect Shaq from getting killed by quicker guards.  That and pick and roll wasn't run nearly like it is today.  https://www.theringer.com/nba/2016/12/19/16077164/nba-pick-and-roll-lou-williams-kemba-walker-draymond-green-f9a1ec934a2a  Shaq would cough up a few more points per game against modern offenses.
"one aspect that is a little confusing - if he can get the rebound whenever he wants, if he's on D, does that guarantee that the other team misses their field goal?  i'm going to assume so for this analysis:  * technically he's good to generate 3 or 4 points (depending on if the assist leads to a two or a three; if there's a foul on that bucket for a 4 point play, that's 5 total points this guy helped make) and he'd have to draw 1 foul where he would go 1 of 2 from the FT line (or he'd shoot and make a single technical/defensive 3 seconds free throw).  * between the rebound and the steal, that automatically takes away two possessions from the opposing team, and the block, at a minimum, prevents at least one field goal attempt from going in.  * so theoretically, if you were within 4 points in the last min and this guy is inserted into the game, he could generate you 4 points on offense (in 2 possessions) to tie the game, an automatic 2 stops of the other team, and a block at some point.  that basically guarantees that, at a minimum, your team will be +4 in the final 4 possessions, and that's without the block.  so essentially, if a team doesn't have at least a 4-point lead by around the last minute or two, they don't have a chance to beat this guy.  and with the way momentum works in the NBA, you gotta think that you'd probably want to have at least a 6-point lead.  i think this guy is worth nearly the max to a lot of teams.  if the Celtics replaced Kemba Walker this year or Gordon Hayward in the previous 3 years (both max contracts) with this guy, they may have won at least one title."
Ok please don‚Äôt be so hyperbolic. Kemba Walker is not better then him
"Ben Simmons is a Career 14.7% 3 point shooter who is very young at 24 years old.  Dame Lillard is an aging guy who's shooting 8.3% from 3 this year, and who couldn't defend even when he wasn't geriatric.    Do you think the Trailblazers would accept Ben Simmons for Dame and a few first rounders?  Then maybe 76ers could flip him to a tanking team who can buy out his contract.  I just feel nobody is going to want to waste a max spot on a washed guy like Dame.  He's sort of in Kemba Walker territory, except Kemba is still spry."

KARDIAC KEMBA WALKER HAS ARRIVED
"Kemba walker is from Harlem, guys"
Ben has also never lost against Kemba walker
"I like the Sixers, and only the Sixers.  But there are plenty of other players that I root for.  TJ McConnell, RoCo, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, Dario Saric, Jimmy Butler, Demar Derozan, Bobi, Deaaron Fox, and a couple more.  I‚Äôd never root for any of these players when they play against Philly but I do any other time."
"Klay Thompson vs Kemba Walker 2018-2019 Regular season  Klay - 21.5 ppg / 3.8 rebounds / 2.4 assists on 57.1% true shooting, 25.6% usage. 78 games played.  Kemba - 25.6 ppg / 4.4 rebounds / 5.9 assists on 55.8% ts, **31.5% usage**. **82 games played**.

Kemba was the minutes leader on a team he dragged to 39 wins. Here was his supporting cast, in descending minutes played -    Nic Batum, in the totally checked-out part of his career   Jeremy Lamb   A 32 year old Marvin Williams   A rookie Miles Bridges   Sophomore Malik Monk   A sometimes healthy Cody Zeller   And to close it out, 8th man, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist.  You swap Klay and Kemba that season, what do you think happens? I think Kemba gets a ring, and those Hornets don't come anywhere close to 39 wins.  The only thing that's wild to me is that in 2021 people would question this all-nba selection."
Kemba Walker may not have been a superstar but the hornets/bobcats never gave him another star to play with
"I haven‚Äôt seen it here yet, but Kemba Walker. Man was incredible, I was a fan before he joined the celtics. His prime was completely wasted on a dead end team, one of the worst teams in history. It‚Äôs genuinely a shame. Watching him now sucks knowing what he could have accomplished."
...Kemba walker? Kyrie Irving? Klay Thompson? /s  Too many goddamn All-Stars starting with the letter k if you ask me ü§£ü§£ü§£

Yea a Boston team that went to the ecf finals the year before when kyrie was hurt and then went to the ecf with kemba walker in kyries place

No other team can sub in Derrick Rose for Kemba Walker. Only the Knicks are allowed to do that.
Kemba Walker almost got his ass stomped by some Timbs
Sorry I'm late to the party but I just watched the last ot- What happened with Kemba Walker? Was he benched or hurt or something? Didn't see him out there
Kemba Walker
"kemba ""no layups"" walker had the basket sealed off on that play.  great decision."
was #8 on the knicks kemba walker? man that was a dumbass play. why would you guard the basket knowing that they're 3 points behind? lol
i've really seen enough of kemba walker on the knicks already
This game is Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker vs the Knicks
what the HELL is kemba walker doing
Kemba walker looks refreshed hopefully he has a good season without injuries bothering him.
Hard to imagine two worse starters next to Lebron and AD than DAJ and Westbrook. You need shooting and wing defense and you get‚Ä¶not that.   Always should have traded for Hield and pursued Kemba‚ÄîI think he turns down the Knicks for a starting role on a title favorite.   Walker / Hield / LeBron / AD / Rotation Cs
"&gt;Boston Celtics vs New York Knicks  &gt;It doesn't look like it will be a great season for the Celtics as they lost three of their best players last season and have a new head coach. The Knicks had a good preason and were able to keep their best players and probably should be the favorites here.  Wait, what? Yes, we lost meaningful players in the form of Fournier, Theis, and Kemba Walker every other game (or less), but we in no way lost three of our best players lol. We have legitimate depth now with Schroder, Horford and Richardson as well as recent draft picks really blossoming into good form (Robert Williams III, Nesmith, Langford, Pritchard). We have a whole new coaching style and locker room which can work with the players more than Brad could. I think the Celtics are legitimate underdogs but not looking at a bad season."
I‚Äôll take one Kemba Walker for Russel Westbrook please
"I love Kemba and will always root for that dude, I mean what person who follows basketball *dislikes* Kemba Walker? Dude is universally loved.   It's a shame he got injured during his tenure here, he was so fun to watch during the beginning of 19/20."
The Knicks.  -Randle‚Äôs shooting could prove to be a fluke as he was super efficient on super high volume last season -East has improved -i don‚Äôt like Evan Fournier or Kemba Walker
"There also haven't been any preseason games since Friday, and there is still one more day before there will be any regular season games.  I don't know what else there would be to talk about.  I mean, from the perspective of my own team, we could talk about how the transition from an Elfrid Payton/Reggie Bullock to Kemba Walker/Evan Fournier backcourt should change the Knicks offense but opens up concerns for what it will do for their defense - but we've already talked about that ad nauseum since Walker agreed to sign in July.  We're focused on the drama right now because that's what is going on and there are literally no Xs and Os to focus on."

Klay Thompson would be a Hufflepuff prefect for sure.  Jaylen Brown - Ravenclaw  Chris Paul - Slytherin  Kemba Walker - Gryffindor
"No I was joking about the fact that his 2019 stats were so mediocre and asking what other seasons were redeemable because you said ""he was never the same player he was in Charlotte"". Then I cherry picked his best stats in Charlotte to make my point that he's mediocre.   The only embarrassing comment here is you implying Kemba Walker was ever worth that contract."
"For the record, Rose has a HoF probability of about 12% according to Basketball Reference  Behind guys like Al Horford, John Wall, Kemba Walker.  Unless he has some magical reawakening and elevates his game to MVP caliber Rose for a few years, he's not getting in."
"Kemba Walker never really adjusted to that role as a clear supporting option behind Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown for Boston because he thrives as ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù who is most dominant with the ball in his hands, which is what his situation in NY can offer him, especially in pick and pop with Julius Randle"
"Kyrie got injured in game 8, against Butler.  It took Duke several months to find their identity without Kyrie. They ended up becoming a really solid defensive team, and had Nolan Smith looking like a POTY candidate, behind Kemba Walker, at point guard. Then ended up developing into a solid #1 seed and demolished a really, really good North Carolina team in the ACC Championship by smothering defense.  There was internet chatter about whether to even bring Kyrie back into the rotation after the team had finally found its identity behind Nolan Smith. But Coach K kind of shot that idea down at a press conference with his whole, you don't sit a guy like Kyrie Irving thing. Turns out that by putting Kyrie back in the starting lineup, it really messed with Duke's identity as a team, and they ended up getting pummeled by an Arizona team in a game that, on paper, shouldn't have been close."

"Suppose so. Idk, no one's heard of pat mccaw but they may have heard of kemba walker or Zach Lavine"
Honestly I always saw him as a regular season player that‚Äôll do worse in the playoffs. I do think he‚Äôll play better than last year if they make the playoffs again. He can only go up from his performance last year. He got his contract and stability. I think Kemba Walker will alleviate some of the pressure but Walker isn‚Äôt a very good playoff player either. Hopefully RJ makes a sizable leap so he could be the go to guy.
"Whiteside's not nearly as bad when you consider he was a 2nd round pick, who had to work his way back to the NBA through the G-league/NBDL, China, and Lebanon.   Basically anything he contributes is found money. 33rd picks are barely even supposed to make a roster. Whiteside's had a great NBA career compared to guys like Kyle Singler and Bernard James.  Drummond, otoh, was drafted 9th and expected to be a franchise cornerstone.  To put it in perspective, the previous 2 33rd picks before Whiteside were Joey Dorsey and Dante Cunningham. The previous 2 9th picks before Drummond were Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker."
Kemba ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a walker‚Äù + Evan ‚Äúdon‚Äôt google me bro‚Äù
Hornets  Kemba Walker  Kobe Bryant  Gerald Wallace  Larry Johnson  Alonzo Mourning  You could maybe replace Kobe with Baron Davis
kemba walker has a song about him
"Really? Because in the last 5 years, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, D'Angelo Russell, and Goran Dragic have all been All-Stars. Point guard defense is greatly overrated. Westbrook and Harden have won MVP's while playing almost no defense. Dame is considered a top 10 player while being a bad defender."
"Based on ages and injuries, I think it's Lakers, Nets, Heat, Warriors, and 76ers. Each of those teams is counting on 1-2 players that are either old, often-injured, or both in order to contend.  I see the argument with the Celtics, but every team has a few guys with potential who can totally change their outcome if they take a leap. I don't think those guys are as high-variance, on the whole, as aged or injured stars. The Celtics were high-variance when they were counting on Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward. Now, apart from the Rob Williams question mark, they are who they are."
"I think the hawks game planned for him and forced everyone else to create which they can‚Äôt really do. Our offense revolves around Randle because he had the ball in his hands a lot of the time. The only other PG/distributor was elfrid Payton (lol) and rose. Rose was phenomenal but can‚Äôt do it by himself. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd be able to do that again this year. Walker (barring injuries) would alleviate that as he is the main shot creator, Randle can create and so can Fournier. Don‚Äôt forget we were also missing Robinson who is our best and starting center, so capela was able to feast in the PNR with young. The addition of healthy Robinson, Fournier and kemba will help to relieve that pressure of Randle in a playoff situation and teams won‚Äôt be able to game plan for just Randle only."
Maybe going for Kemba Walker would Be a good idea
Difference is one team has Steph Klay and even Draymond as the main guys while the Knicks have Kemba Walker and Derrick Rose as the main guys
"Only the best outcome in hindsight factoring health, a healthy Kemba Walker when he was in Charlotte was a max player.  They got penalized by not being able to retain their star, possibly because of not offering the max.  You're also comparing a situation in which the Charlotte Hornets were cash strapped in the first place.  Make a better argument, or find a new slant."
"I was at a Raptors game vs the Charlotte Hornets the year the Raptors won the title. I took a good look at Kawhi Leonard as he was walking at Scotiabank Arena. Tried to say hi, but he ignored us.   Kemba Walker was also at the arena that same night. I knew about his impending free agency and I shouted him out for carrying the Hornets while he was waiting at the elevator to rejoin his team. He thanked me and I wished him well afterwards. He was such a chill guy"
I met DJ Augustin at Carolina Place Mall when he was still on the Bobcats. Met Muggsy Bogues at a Bobcats game the season before we rebranded back to the Hornets. Vernon Maxwell of Rockets fame lives in Charlotte and goes to the YMCA I used to work at everyday. Also met Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker while working at a movie theater
"Wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I‚Äôve met NBA players but, I worked at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee before they tore it down around 2016-2017, and where I had to clock in was right next to the Bucks locker room where all the bucks players and away players would pass. I walked right pass Russ, Jimmy Butler , D Rose, Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Brandon Ingram and much more. I saw Giannis and waved to him everyday lol (dude is fucking huge!). It‚Äôs so weird seeing them that close in person. My cousin was also the security guard for the locker room so he stood right outside. He was my ride to and from work so I had to wait for him to be done to go home, and he had to wait until all the players left the arena. The cooks in the arena would make food for the away team, and at the end of the night I got the left overs shit was great. Best job I ever had!"
"I have no idea why you're being mass downvoted, you've made solid points lmao.  Not including drafting three MVPs:  - OKC has a very solid track record of regularly drafting great players with mediocre picks.  - They manage to actually get high returns from each of Westbrook/PG13/CP3, despite all of them expressing they wanted to move on. Kemba Walker was also great asset management.  - They signed arguably the best bang for buck contract in the league with Dort  - In addition to the albatross amount of 1st rounders they have, they *still* have a young franchise player in SGA to build around  All of that on top of being a small market.  Idk why r/NBA is circle jerking ""losing three MVPs"" as the primary argument against OKC having great management either.  Giving up on Harden too early is the only knock OKC's management has, otherwise they couldn't control KD leaving and r/NBA hates Westbrook so that's a trash argument."
He's gotta dance like Kemba Walker after each miss.
"They replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with someone who attempted even more 3s per game than he did last year, believe it"
"Celtics stagnant offense is a result of Stevens favorite players and the Js being a bad fit. IT, Terry, Kyrie and Kemba all share the fact that they are ball dominant player (Terry used to be in Boston) who are looking primarily for their own scoring. Tatum needing his iso situations and Brown is relying on good playmaker are just a bad fit to those players, but Stevens loves himself a scoring guard. Never have the Js and their PG been good at the same time. The Js developing into the franchise player they are unfortunately made Stevens offense problematic and a bad fit. Their overall quality and defense was always enough to compete but I expected Walker being an equal bad fit like Kyrie (since we talk about moemns where our scepsis was warranted). I expect the Celtics fully commiting to their wings this year and I'm really exited."
Kemba Walker never fit the Celtics and that he shouldn't be signed
The longer morey holds out the bigger the chance he gets a kemba walker in return
"DRose, Julius Randle and Nerlens Noel are all currently injured and Kemba Walker and Mitchell Robinson have played an average of 48 games the last two years.   Barrett and Quickly were very reliable last year, but Topin and Knox were not. I don‚Äôt trust the rookies or Fournier, but maybe you do."
then you consider kemba walker to be one of the best point guards currently playing?
"No bias, none whatsoever;  Imma say Kemba Walker"
"Boston acquired more all stars, 3, from 2016-18 than any other NBA team and also drafted Tatum and Brown who became All Stars.   The other recent lottery pick they kept over that time was their 2014 pick, Marcus Smart, who‚Äôs an all defensive team member,  If you want ant to you can count their 2015 16th pick, Terry Rozier, who they traded for another All Star, Kemba Walker, in 2019.   They included the 2018 8th pick in the Kyrie trade.  I want someone to tell me which picks that they ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù they should have traded.   No one will, because they can‚Äôt.   It‚Äôs just a stupid ESPN narrative."
"How else would a player be better? Kemba Walker has more in his bag, Kyle Lowry impacts winning more."
We were a much better team than you last year. We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba Walker and Reggie Bullock with Evan Fournier. You replaced Kyle Lowry with Goran Dragic.
"Fred last year (20/6/4) put up similar numbers as Khris Middleton (18/4/5), D'Angelo Russell (21/7/4), Kyle Lowry (19/7/5), and Kemba Walker (20/5/4) in years they were All Stars.    Fred is also one of the best guard defenders in the league and has shot 38% from 3 while taking 8 attempts per game over the past 2 seasons.    Fred is super underated and absolutely deserves to be called a fringe All Star."
Check out kemba walker vs lebron James while your in there. One of the most one sided head to heads I beliebe
"We are a league where teams go all-in on second-tier All-Stars just for a shot at staying relevant. Kristaps Porzingis is making $32 mil this season, Paskal Siakam is making $33M, Tobias Harris and Kemba Walker are making $36M. John Wall is making $44M.  Yes, Westbrook is inefficient, but he is a MVP winner, and so he got paid like one. I don't see anything wrong with that. I certainly don't see him as overpaid. He got paid exactly what he was worth in this league at the time."
Emeka Okafor Jake Voskuhl Kemba Walker Ben Gordon Jeff Adrien Jeremy Lamb James Bouknight
Hypothetically if last year's Knicks team somehow acquired Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier and got Mitchell Robinson back from injury and drafted 3 NBA ready rookies and had everyone buy into the culture and had all of their young players improve again I feel like they could be the first seed in the East  Hypothetically of course
Kemba Walker is on the NY Knicks
They could easily get Kemba Walker or Mike Connelly for him.
"I think it's very realistic to expect Jordan Clarkson type production out of him. In terms of his true ceiling, I think it's possible he ends up as a ""lower tier"" all-star, like a Kemba Walker level player. Either way I full-heartedly believe he has a promising career ahead of him. He's clearly got talent, and everyone in the organization says he works his ass off, and his improvement since being drafted would seem to back that up."
Yeah it reminds me of Kemba Walker with his game winner in college.
"I guess that‚Äôs fair, but during the last 5 seasons Kemba Walker was the best player on his team, made four all star games and an all nba team. A more recent sample size (last one or two seasons) is much more favorable to CJ which makes sense given all the knee issues Kemba has had.  So I guess if we‚Äôre comparing CJ to prime Kemba I‚Äôll agree with you, but prime Kemba is more of a theory than a certainty at this point while CJ‚Äôs played the best basketball of his career in the latest season."
"He‚Äôs a more handsome Kemba Walker. Undersized guard who can‚Äôt play defense, and puts up big numbers on losing teams ala kemba 2019"
"Imagine if Marcus smart had Donavan Mitchell‚Äôs scoring. Then pair him with two future superstars in Randle and rj and u got an unstoppable lineup. Then add certified buckets like Kemba Walker and drose Quickley and add in some defensive anchors like Mitchell Robinson nerlons Noel. That‚Äôs how u beat larden, DurSnake, and anti-vax Allen iverson"
"Lakers will be the 5th seed, Denver will win the championship, Kemba walker will be very productive in NYK, Paul George will be an MVP candidate,  Ben Simmons is the lastest version of ""Ewing Theory"" in that in ANY situation the Sixers will be better without him"
I really never understood how large Ben Simmons is even after watching countless games until trying to guard him with Kemba Walker in 2k. He looks like a monster and him being scared to dunk just makes it soooo much worse. How tf you scared of Trae Young? You‚Äôve probably fucked other young socialites larger than him.  And no one sent 2k the memo bc Simmons is VERY eager to dunk over Kemba on the game‚Ä¶.
Fav:  Lou Williams for dating two women at the same time.   Least: Kemba Walker because he smiles too much on the court.  &amp;#x200B;  Not very good reasons i know
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he‚Äôs technically a SG but I couldn‚Äôt find any other PG‚Äôs besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren‚Äôt from NY and since it‚Äôd be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
"22ppg after 30ppg insane MVP season with 67% TS is terrible, plus his last few games were even worse to add to the terrible turnover numbers  Also his bad defense, he was outscored by Irving and they were matchup hunting on him, they match up hunted him in the most famous shot of that series by Kyrie   He had an abysmal series, if he was some sort of Kemba Walker level all star sure those are good numbers but he was the unanimous MVP"
"Do you want him to suck off Daryl Morey for trying to trade him? For as many stories like Tatum's quote, a second year player, there's as many stories of people being mad after someone tried to trade them. See Kemba Walker, summer of 2021. Bleacher Report story."
"Number 1 overall pick, 6""10 PG who can mostly do it all. They've invested so much time, capital, and resources and to ask for anything less would be such a fuck up. They want a player who's franchise put in similar development resources into a lottery pick or similar.. they don't want to have to re develope anybody, they should get what they put in. Honestly, at lowest I think they should trade for Kemba Walker, send Simmons to NYK."
"* Tatum, both are very good but I expect Brown to be who he was last year while Tatum becomes more consistent and improves on the playmaking flashes he's shown.  * Don't see any of them really improving, more playing in the same role they had. I'll go Nunn, because I think he's a more consistent and less ball-dominant player than Monk, and I think that off-ball scoring will be very valuable to the Lakers.  * Maxey, I think Thybulle is who he is- great defender but offensive nonfactor. Maxey is much more of a young, developmental prospect, and he'll likely see more minutes as a PG/playmaker with Ben out.  * Brooks, I think Clarke is buried in the rotation and Brooks really stepped it up (particularly defensively) last season.  * Huerter, played a big role in a playoff series and he'll likely split minutes with Bogi and LouWill- the only two players on the Hawks who are really SGs, and I expect Lou/Cooper to avoid sharing the floor with Trae for defensive purposes. Reddish has shown a lot less and is competing with Hunter/Gallo/Collins/Bogi for a spot as a SF/PF.  * Miles took a huge leap last with Hayward out, and his efficiency was through the roof last year, but I'm going with PJ. He experienced the classic sophomore slump on offensive, but his defense was still very good. I think he'll follow the trend of players who re-find their footing in their third year, after they're accustomed to the league a bit.  * Bones, he'll be a legit rotation guy and showed out in college and Summer League. Bol still doesn't have a defined role or NBA skillset and he's buried in the rotation.  * Hayes. I loved Hayes coming out of the draft but he's been an appalling NBA player who is good at basically nothing. That means he basically has nowhere to go but up, even if Bey is still the better player. He'll probably get better with a whole season and no injuries, but I think he's gonna be a four to five year project kind of guy if he even sticks in the league. I think Bey's minutes are gonna be eaten into with Cade/Grant occupying a similar role, and I think Hayes almost has to get better, while Bey will slowly refine the things he's already good at- I think he'll develop like his Villanova peer Mikal Bridges, pretty good as a rookie and slowly refining that 3&amp;D skillset until he becomes really good within that niche.  * KPJ, I think Wood is who is and won't take much of a leap. This was KPJ's first year as a PG and he looked promising, I expect him to be a better at playmaking with some experience. Wood is probably still the better play, but with less change in his game.  * Herro, another guy who I think had a sophomore slump but is still a valuable player, even last year he was a solid off-ball guy and actually averaged a higher PPG than Duncan, albeit on much worse efficiency. Herro is also a better playmaker than Duncan, and much younger. Duncan could still be the better player, but I doubt he changes much in his age-27 season, while Herro has a bit more room to grow.  * Both made a big jump last year, and I think this year will be becoming slightly better versions of themselves, instead of another big jump. RJ's shot has really dramatically improved, and I think he'll get slightly better in that area even if he experiences a dip in raw numbers (for example, going from 40% three-point shooting to 38%, but doing so on more attempts per game). I'll go RJ because of the leap from rookie to sophomore, and I think he has a higher defensive ceiling than Randle. I also expect some of Randle's heavy usage to be eaten into by Kemba/Rose, hurting his raw numbers even if he's just as valuable.  * Mann, Winslow has basically taken a Klay Thompson-length break from basketball.  * Walker, I'm very low on Hayes and his fit beside Zion is questionable, plus he has JV ahead of him. The Pelicans backcourt is seemingly an open race, and NAW seems the most likely guy to take that SG spot.  * Pat, I think Lonzo is who he is (which is a very valuable player) but I don't see him developing into a star. Pat looked like a man amongst boys in Summer League and I think he increases his three-point volume; he shot efficiently last year, but on very few attempts. And, on a roster with Lavine/Demar/Vooch, PatWill is gonna be expected to be a go-to defensive stopper, another area he's shown promise in- clearly the Bulls trust him to reach that promise.  * I'll stand with Ant here. I'm not sure what role D'Lo has on the Wolves; he's a poor defender, has below-average efficiency, and is fairly ball-dominant. He's not an astoundingly great playmaker either. I think he's actually better suited to a sixth man role, and he did play in that role some last season. I don't think Edwards back-half a season was a fluke, guy was legitimately great with Finch coaching and KAT alongside him, plus he should take the rookie to sophomore defensive jump; he's a hard worker and has all the physical attributes of a great defender."
"The Celtics were a middling defensive team because they don‚Äôt have a good rim protector.  Rim protection is by far the most important part of a defense, so without it they couldn‚Äôt be elite.  But for the most part it‚Äôs not a rim protector helping Kemba off screens or guarding his man on switches or getting contests on shots when Kemba isn‚Äôt there.  It‚Äôs the players I mentioned, which is why I said they were covering him.  They made his stats better than he is, because they guarded his man.  Did you watch the Knicks/Hawks series last playoffs?  Rose was the only guy out there playing consistently good defense, and he had the hardest job (Trae).  If stats fail you, use the eye test.  No eye test on Earth will tell you Rose and Walker are near the same level on defense.  Kemba is bad, Rose is good.  On offense it‚Äôs a different story, even if Kemba is somewhat of a chucker and DRose can actually run an offense."

"Kemba Walker, Kevin Durant, and Kareem are a few others lol  Also Jeff Goldblum"
lol the Kemba walker just removed from the rotation
Kemba Walker 0 +/-  Rest of team: -2
D rose in 2021 is a better option than Kemba Walker what a time to be alive
Damn so Kemba Walker can't even get 10th man rotation minutes?
"Close, it's actually Kemba who would show up nightly.  He'd set a record of some sort (personal or Hornets record) and still catch the L. I started calling him Kemba ""Despite the Loss"" Walker"
"If you set team record aside altogether, he absolutely was worthy of a spot over Ben Simmons (voted as a guard) in 2019-20 in my opinion. That year, Booker averaged 27 and 7 on 62% TS and I believe he was the league leader in points produced per touch (via points and assists). But, the Suns missed the playoffs by half a game.   In 2018-19, once again setting team records aside, I believe that Booker was more worthy than Kemba Walker of 3rd team honors. (I do not disagree with this selection, I‚Äôm just explaining that Kemba got in because of team record, which is valid)    I definitely think that team record should have a major impact on All-NBA selections, which is why I think Booker would be deserving of All-NBA First team if the season ended today."
"We've got a Kemba Walker..., hardly used (some wear on the knees), one careful owner. Going cheap!"

Bruh they replaced arguably the league‚Äôs worst starter with Kemba Walker on a team that made the playoffs. That‚Äôs something they should have loved. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work out.
he's just kemba walker that can't shoot on offense. That's fun?
I mean any team would be hyped to upgrade elfrid Payton with kemba walker. Problem was we didn‚Äôt know how much he would suck lol
That's OKC legend Kemba Walker to you
"Nah I disagree. Cities like New York, LA, Oakland, and just about every NBA city have working class fans that are passionate about the game and the atmosphere could be like that if the NBA made fans the priority. But the problem is that the NBA too corporate compared to leagues in Europe.   American sports leagues generally prioritize making money at all costs. Compared to European leagues which value competition and the spirit of the game much more. As someone who follows both American sports and European soccer, every conversation in American sports seems to revolve around how the ratings are affected. People in this sub have internalized the business aspect of the NBA so much that they'll reject ideas simply because it might negatively affect the ratings. Whereas in soccer I've never once heard the ratings ever brought up as a topic of conversation. I have 0 idea if the EPL ratings are up or down or where they stand compared to previous seasons because it's just not as big of a priority over there.  Another aspect of American sports that I feel hurts passion is the draft. European players usually play for the clubs that they grow up around, whereas American players get shipped across the country. I feel like I would have had a lot more passion as a Knicks fan watching Lance Stephenson and Kemba Walker develop in our system/academy and finally make their debuts for us when good enough than watching them get shipped off to Indiana and Charlotte, places that they have no connection to and where the fans have no connection to them. Obviously you grow to love the players you draft over years, but the connection to homegrown players is just different."
It just clicked....this means Kemba Walker will end up on the Lakers somehow this year
"Ive always wondered what the hype was with Kemba Walker. I know he was pretty serviceable in Charlotte, although I dont remember any strong runs with their teams.  When he became a FA and went to Boston, it seemed as if everyone thought he'd make the Celtics forget about Kyrie.   Is this one of those cases where he was a big fish in a small pond, and couldn't deliver on a big stage?"
Right?  Kemba Walker is dealing with the same thing and he fits in a pocket.
We have one very lightly used Kemba Walker available
DRose outlasting Kemba Walker... who woulda thought
Would you rather be Kemba Walker or James Michael McAdoo?
For conversations sake ‚Äî was leaving Charlotte any good to Kemba Walker?  Hindsight is obviously 20/20 but this iteration of Charlotte is a lot of fun and seems on pace to being a playoff or play-in team despite a far tougher Eastern Conference.
"A lot of people were critical of the Hornets (nee Bobcats) for not extending Walker, but everything he has done since has validated that choice.   I like Walker. He seems like a solid dude. I'd love to see him find success and thrive, but he always just came across as a Steven Francis/Stephan Marbury type. Extremely talented, but a score-first point guard who wouldn't be able to translate nice per-game stats into team success.   I'd love to be proven wrong on this, but it seems like this is true still. I mean, even looking at his numbers, they aren't far off from what he has done in the past.  In fact, he's getting more points on fewer shots than he did in his first four seasons. He's shooting a career best from the arc, only about 1% under his career average from inside the arc (though a bit lower in that regard from his all-star seasons). He's getting 2.2 assists per turnover (close to his career average of 2.4).   I can't say I'm surprised by this, but I wish the best for him and hope he turns things around.   Perhaps he'll get a buyout and then start fresh with somebody else.  He might not even have to move. Just sign up with the Warriors and given them Kyrie Light (Kemba) while they are waiting for Kyrie to get his shit together."
"Absolutely. They‚Äôre blowing him out of the water impact wise, because he‚Äôs been that bad.   But, they‚Äôre role players. You can trade them or even bench/cut them if they have a bad stretch and you‚Äôre not losing any sleep over it. That‚Äôs what Kemba Walker is being paid yet everyone keeps bringing up the number like it‚Äôs this big number of dead cap holding us back from signing a superstar. If Maxi Kleber god forbid goes down for a season no one is gonna say ‚Äúoh my god they‚Äôre paying him $9M!? what a blow!‚Äù"
&gt;Is Kemba walker a better scorer than IQ or Burks   No
His shooting isnt really the issue he has a 56% TS which is decent. His problem is his knees are blown so he can't penetrate worth a damn. Basically he's limited just to stepbacks and spot ups but Kemba Walker is still good at stepbacks and spot ups
Kemba ‚Äúneeds a‚Äù Walker
"&gt;You guys have had 4 potential ""franchise"" PG's all end their tenure with you far before  IT quickly fell out of the NBA, Kyrie is refusing to play for how long now? and you're quite literally saying this the comment sections of ''Kemba Walker will be dropped from the rotation''. 2 out of the 3 players we lost in the recent past literally dropped from rotations in a season or less."
Eric Gordon for Kemba Walker and Quintin Grimes
"I'm going to be honest, I completely forgot about Kemba Walker"
Kemba ‚ÄúKelly Oubre‚Äù Walker
"I think that your idea about Kemba is a myth. A scoring first, small guard that depends on speed and is major liability on defense would hardly ever have another level in him beyond 30. I.T had a similar scenario, Westbrook is on the same road as well.  He is nowhere near the mentioned guys in terms of style of play and quality. Each of those players led multiple teams to a top 2 seed. Kemba Walker reached the playoffs two times between 2012-2018 when the East was at an all time low in that period"
&gt;	Kemba Walker has been nominated for the Lifetime Achievement Award
"&gt; Is Kemba walker a better scorer than IQ or Burks, probably.  Having watched him this year burks can get his shot off in more ways. He‚Äôs probably a slower IQ"
"That‚Äôs the challenge of being a coach, figuring out that balance. Is Kemba walker a better scorer than IQ or Burks, probably. Is he always going to be more effective on the floor than either of those two, no."
"I like Kemba Walker, but there is no way his ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù career status even comes close to the level of the other guys you mentioned. While it sucks to see his body deteriorate now, he had a couple year run where you could‚Äôve made a fair argument for him as a top 5 point guard who was maybe on par with a guy like Kyrie, Wall, or Lowry at the time. I feel like that‚Äôs pretty close to him reaching his full potential whereas the other 4 just barely got to scratch the surface of what they were capable of."
"Kemba ""Todd Gurley"" Walker :("
Kemba Walker is probably available.
Kemba walker either shoots 60% from 3 or has a terrible game. His play style does not lead to consistently good games
"If you told me 3 years ago that Derrick Rose would be a way better point guard than Kemba Walker, I‚Äôd laugh."
"So, what team needs 1 Kemba Walker?"
Kemba Walker and Gallinari
"* We are a better team without Kemba Walker playing  * I love how the lineups were staggered, RJ plays so much better in a fast paced offense like the bench runs  * Quickley‚Äôs defense and playmaking are starting to catch up to his shooting and he may end up being the best point guard on the roster soon  * Alec Burks is a weapon off the bench  * Obi Toppin may be the most energetic big man I‚Äôve ever watched, and one of the best in-game dunkers too  * Quentin Grimes is gonna be a very good 3 and D guy, and Jericho Sims is gonna be a decent rim running center, our draft is looking very nice this year considering where these guys were picked  * Julius Randle is in his own head on offense sometimes, but he played very well defensively and his passing was very important. If he could just play with the energy that our bench does and let the game come to him instead of forcing offense through the low post, he‚Äôd be playing so much better"
"Knicks were without D rose, Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, and Kemba walker. Excuses are lame"
"Oh no you were missing world beater Nerlens Noel and the corpse of Kemba Walker, def comparable to missing Bogi, Cam Reddish, D'Andre Hunter, and Okongwu lol. Only legit piece y'all were missing was D Rose"
"I have been betting against the Knicks a lot the last few games because I figured, well if we‚Äôre gonna play like shit I might as well make some money off it. So I‚Äôve been betting on the other team for the overall spread, the third quarter spread, the under on points for RJ Barrett, etc. And I‚Äôve won most of those bets.   I‚Äôve never been happier to lose money. Kemba Walker is the 4th best PG on this team and Burks and Quickley should take all of his minutes"

"Yup. I've made my peace with the fact that this group of players is not going to accomplish the things that I hoped they would and that this era is going to be over a lot sooner than I had hoped. Which is crazy to think about it since it's just a little bit more than a year since the Bubble where we were 2 games away from the NBA Finals.   I was optimistic things might be different this year with Ime... but nah more of the same.   I don't think there's anything we can do really, Ainge screwed us his last 2 years as GM, every move since Kyrie left has been a bad move, and now he's left Brad in charge of his mess.   If I could pick Danny's brain, I would ask him what he was thinking when he decided to pass on pursuing Chris Paul in 2 separate offseasons in 2019 and 2020, and why he thought Kemba Walker was a better fit. IMO one of the dumbest decisions ever, one guy is The Point God, the other guy was a fringe All-Star that put up stats on bad teams."
I think Immanuel Quickley should start over Kemba Walker.
"Guess that process takes a couple decades then? Maybe you'll contend for a ring by 2030, bud lmao. You keep insulting the pacers as an organization as if I don't already know the team is bad and the front office is dumb. At least I can recognize when the team I root for sucks, unlike you. Sad sight to see.   But hey, at least Kyrie Irving and Kemba Walker both worked out for you lmfao  Try getting less angry about your team. It's bad for your health, pal"
The Kings subreddit and fanbase is really impatient and reactionary. If we had Steph curry and he had a slump they'd ask him to be traded for Kemba walker.

Kemba Walker in Charlotte. Charlotte fans seem to still love him.
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
Fun fact: Miles Bridges is the only current Hornet that played with Kemba Walker in Charlotte.
Kemba Walker
"---------- ""I can't believe this whole era for them hasn't really worked,"" one league executive said. ""They're stuck in neutral -- and maybe going backwards.""  In the span of three years, the franchise underwent a steep and steady talent drain:  *    Irving, Horford and Morris left via free agency.  * The picks from the Kings and Grizzlies turned into the 14th selection in consecutive seasons, netting Boston a pair of reserve swingmen in Romeo Langford and Aaron Nesmith.  * Rozier was sent to the Charlotte Hornets in the sign-and-trade deal to land Kemba Walker, who was subsequently sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder along with a first-round pick for Horford.  * The trade exception created when Hayward left became two months of Evan Fournier and then Josh Richardson.  * Coach Brad Stevens left the sidelines to replace Danny Ainge as president of basketball operations.  The result? Boston now is short both on high-end talent and high-end assets to build around its young stars.  ""Ultimately, you can't keep losing -- albeit flawed -- All-Star talent like Kyrie, Gordon, Kemba, Horford,"" an Eastern Conference scout said. ""That adds up.""  -----------"
Depends on if rookie Jalen Green is better than rookie Kemba Walker or Jahil Okafor.
"Is Thibs really a COTY type coach, or did he just kind of line up with Randle's anomaly of a season?  It's obvious that Rose, IQ, and Toppin bring a much better pace and energy than the likes of Kemba Walker. RJ Barrett plays hard but his shooting form is so stiff he's always going to be a streaky scorer. And Randle... if they keep trying to force the offense through him, an early playoff exit is their ceiling.  In short, they got to change their starting and bench lineups."
Why did the Knicks sign kemba Walker for all that $.  What a waste
Does Kemba Walker not play for The Knicks anymore?
Kemba Walker is to basketball as Reggie Miller is to commentating.
Why is Kemba Walker getting paid big bucks again?
Kemba Walker is just so disappointing
"There's a whole generation of guards that I hate just because at some point some pundit, or analyst, or rando on this site said was better than Dame.   Kyrie Irving, Demar Derozan, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Isaiah Thomas, Kemba Walker, to name a few. Most of these dudes are good guys and very fun to watch, but a part of me loves seeing them have a bad game in the pettiest way, because I know that at some point someone said with a straight face that they were a better player than Damian Lillard. These days Dame usually gets the respect he deserves, but like pre-2019 everybody was trying to act their favorite player was actually better than Dame because of some stupid shit and I still hate those players, just a little bit, because of it."
"He also seems to be well liked by players, unlike most high profile GMs. Kemba Walker was on JJ Reddick's podcast the other day and kept going back to talk about how good he was to him."

AYE KEMBA WALKER DON‚ÄôT YOU REGRET NOT COMING TO THE BULLLLLLLSSSSS. DON‚ÄôT YOU REGRET NOT COMING THE BULLLLLSSS
I wish Zach Lavine would be reffed like how the all-star Kemba Walker is reffed
Kemba Walker has really regressed since leaving Charlotte. He not even close to all nba level anymore he just an average point god
Kemba Walker  dude looks good for about 3 mins a game and hits some nice shots but cant run the offense and cant be on the floor at the end to close out games‚Ä¶.
"Knicks just sunk a ton of cap space into Kemba and Fournia and have Rose off the bench so no.  Pop has Lonnie Walker, White, Murray, Vessle already that they are developing and he isn‚Äôt a Pop player at all with that tunnel vision.  Hornets just extended Scary Terry who‚Äôs a better shooter.   You gotta be kidding bringing up the Pistons.  Cleveland is most definitely stuck with him."
Julius Randle/Kemba Walker?
"I mean Kemba Walker was supermax eligible with the Hornets after making his 1st All NBA team (3rd Team), which would have been a much more questionable supermax if Charlotte went through with it."
"cause the knicks sub has an insane amount of people who want randle to suck and will just make up nonsense to support it  randle isn't even the biggest ball hog on the knicks with 4.1 seconds average time spent touching the ball per possession, with kemba walker at 5 seconds  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches/?sort=TIME_OF_POSS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=GP*GE*12  and he's not even close to the league leaders in that category"
"As a rookie he was 31% from 3, on 6 attempts per game. I feel like that's not terrible?

Just something a little poetic about Melo &amp; Bridges burning Kemba on the game changing basket‚Ä¶   Walker turning down the Hornets is possible the best thing to happen to this franchise (Bobcats-Hornets era) It finally was the rock bottom for this team and they had to rebuild, Miles looks amazing, LaMelo is a star, Rozier is still here.

But the Jays would need a PG who can play make and set up shots for them, not a chucker like Kemba. And this isn‚Äôt even bringing up what Simmons does on defense lol."
"Boston should trade Kemba Walker, who might be one of the few players with a worse contract, for Blake."
"We have all our own assets still. Plus one of the youngest teams in the league with two emerging all-star wings and one of the best defensive guards in the league.   It's just a case of Boston being held to a different standard than most teams.   * Boston makes 3 conference finals out of 4 = Failure in a league where most teams haven't been able to make 1 in decades.  * Boston has 2 all-stars under 25 = Failure in a league where no other team can say the same  * Boston has the 5th youngest team in the league = Failure in a league where all 10/12 of the youngest teams in the league have losing records (Denver being the other exception)  * Boston has all their own picks = Failure in a league where most contenders have already traded theirs away   We're actually really well-positioned for the future.

"Yea, but there's 0 reason to bring up the C's. We have literally no way of getting him outside of throwing Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, or Kemba Walker at them"
"Tatum and J. Brown are doing great, the issue is there is too much talent on the team to share the ball. If you take away 1 from the team then the other would be at 30 ppg easily. Tatum is A1, and Brown is A2, but brown wants to be the #1 option, and so does marcus smart sometimes, but then you have kemba walker on the team as well. Tatum or Brown can be the #1 option on their own teams, but working together and sharing the rock is difficult. Gordon Hayward was averaging like 17 ppg and coming off the bench on the celtics but now going off with the Hornets.  Siakim is someone who is a true #2 or #3 option. He needs a true superstar in front of him on the team."
"No legit big man, no bench, and man does Kemba Walker suck ass. Getting tired of being a Celtics fan."
Develop them with what goal in mind exactly? Our current core group of players are only going to improve marginally. As of right now we are the new Kemba Walker led Hornets
Kemba Walker: We'll get it figured out eventually  Kemba Runner: We need to fix it now
The help was Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward lmao. Not his fault Hayward didn‚Äôt want to be the fourth option and Kemba has knee issues. He should be criticized for the bench that was put together but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs been sitting on his hands.
&gt;It was apparent that the Celtics and Hornets were the only two teams after him.   Knicks were after him too  https://dailyknicks.com/2020/08/06/knicks-kemba-walker-seriously-considered-signing/
At no point in basketball was Kemba Walker better than Kyrie
"Just because he was available doesn't make him a better player, Kemba Walker as a player has never been better than Kyrie"
Giannis picking Kemba Walker over James Harden for *allstar starter* was disgraceful. Kemba wouldn‚Äôt have even started if Kyrie was healthy
All jokes aside the Celtics need either a playmaker or a rim protector it‚Äôs wild how small this team is or how kemba walker it arguably the best passer on this team
Brad Stevens and Kemba Walker for D'Angelo Russell who says no
Fines incoming for Kyle Lowry and Kemba Walker? Cut down on the flopping league-wide!!!
"exactly. i think lebron, harden, embiid, etc accentuate it. no one can stop them from getting to the basket and they just want their bonus for taking punishment in the process. now kemba walker, trae young, etc are only doing it for the foul. those guys don‚Äôt finish through contact consistently in the nba so the only reason to look for contact for them is a bailout foul. i hate it"
"Kemba ""he's better than Kyrie! - Celtics fans"" Walker probably"
Ship simmons out for a dynamic scoring guard. Someone like Kemba Walker
"I just checked bball ref's HoF probability list and it's laughable, they have Rose at a 12% chance behind Al Horford and Kemba Walker."
"&gt;Our core of FVV/Norm/Siakam are just entering their primes -- yea they're not gonna make any leaps in their games, but they're not declining any time soon (they're still getting better, if anything). They had growing pains to start the season, having no production from the 5 spot or the bench, but they've gone 10-6 in their last 16 and led the team to the 9th best net rating in the NBA.  Just entering primes is just a cheerleader way of saying in their primes. They are currently in their primes:   I never claimed they were going to decline. Not sure what you‚Äôre arguing there. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre not going to improve enough to make us serious contenders.   Going 10-6 in their last 16 games with the 9th best rating means virtually nothing. We are legitimately not even close to contention with this core. We‚Äôre are good, *decent* team, but we‚Äôre far worse than we were even in the DeRozan days.  You‚Äôre being optimistic for the sake of it as opposed to being realistic about the caliber of team we currently are.  &gt;We saw how deadly they could be last year when they had good production at C. We're not contenders right now, but we could be back there in a couple years through some smart trades and signings. Lowry obviously doesn't fit that timeline, so he'll likely be moved for assets.  Yeah...we were ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù enough to be a competitive second round exit, and we‚Äôre far worse off today than we were 1, 2, 3 and even 4 years ago. FVV isn‚Äôt a point guard. He‚Äôs a shooting guard in a point guard‚Äôs body. He cannot run an offence to the extent Lowry can. I think you‚Äôre vastly underestimating how much worse we‚Äôre going to be if and when Lowry gets moved.  &gt;Let me ask you, what happens in your scenario when you blow everything up and play bad for the next ~5 years, and we end up back in the same spot? Our new ""young"" core is now entering their primes again at 26-27, but the team is still a tier below the top teams? Do you blow it up all over again, or do you try to make upgrades where possible?  Let me answer your question with a question: why are you automatically assuming we‚Äôre going to be exactly as good as we are now if we rebuild? The goal of a rebuild obviously wouldn‚Äôt be to field a team as good as the one we currently have. I‚Äôm not sure how you come to the conclusion that a front office that is one of the best in the league at both drafting *and* developing players will end up drafting and developing a mediocre team if given the opportunity to rebuild. If we rebuild it‚Äôs far, far more likely we draft the Jayson Tatums than the Lonzo Balls and Markelle Fultz‚Äôs.  Think of it this way: would you rather be the 76ers the past few years, or the Kemba Walker Hornets? Pretty easy decision."
Kevin Durant is a 7 foot Kemba walker
just was in the celtics sub reading   &gt; [Jay King] Kemba Walker said his struggles aren‚Äôt due to his knee... ‚ÄúNothing with my knee or anything like that.‚Äù (twitter.com)
"Kemba Walker is 6' even, relatively on the smaller side of the NBA in general."
"I watched this live, and the game devolved into a bit of a shitshow (obviously) because the refs swallowed their whistles once it was clear that the C's were in control. There was a phase in the 3rd when they were calling some bullshit that looked like they were trying to let Toronto back in, but Toronto wasn't having it haha, so it got sloppy after that.   I'd also like to point out Siakam in this clip, and why I can't stand him. He's a fucking spaz with arms as long as his legs, and freak athletic ability, but he actually kind of sucks at basketball. Just watch him:  - he runs the floor on the initial break, but completely gives up when Powell doesn't give him the ball at the three point line, and then gets outrebounded by Kemba fucking Walker  - then he does not even pretend to get back on d the other way, never crosses half court  - he camps in the corner, holding his hands out WITH A DEFENDER ON HIM  - puts his hands on his knees and pouts when he doesn't get the ball again even though he wasn't open and didn't do a goddamn thing to help the play  - again does not cross half court to play defense  - finally gets the ball because he was cherry picking, and blows the layup despite expending absolutely no energy because he's a clumsy fucking spaz  All I see when I watch him play is flailing limbs and chaos. Must be super frustrating as a Raptors fan to see the athletic potential but inability to refine his game."
"Just for clarification, I wasn‚Äôt ranking the best point guards. Just ranking the PGs I named. I believe Mike Conley, Jrue Holiday, and most Starting PGs are better than Patrick Beverley + Kemba Walker"
Ben simmons never lost to Kemba Walker and his knees
Kemba Walker is ass this year.
"Kemba ""Step back from consistency"" Walker"

Kemba Walker exists
"They did the same thing with Kemba last year too, letting him play in the bubble even though [Ainge said he definitely didn't look right.](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/10/01/kemba-walker-celtics-not-himself-bubble)"
"Yep, or even Kemba's knee problems and how the Celtics let him play in the bubble even though [Danny Ainge later admitted he definitely didn't look right there](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/10/01/kemba-walker-celtics-not-himself-bubble) while struggling with his knee problems."
kemba walker is not in chris paul's class  very few are  CP3 is like top 5 PG of all time
Kemba Walker + TPE for Jerome Robinson. Wizards will accept that.
"Kemba Walker is not worth being paid like a top 15 player, honey."
Kemba Walker for Russell Westbrick
"Since Harden has been traded, Wall has an AST% of 42.2% which is the same as his career average.   Also keep in mind, this is a comparison to Kemba Walker who has never averaged more than 6 assists a game while being a way less versatile defender.   Since Harden was traded Wall has been putting up 20-3-7 with notably better efficiency than Kemba.   Not sure why you want to shit on John Wall, but good chance you are going to continue to you whatever stat out of context to try and prove your point."
Should the Celtics trade for kemba walker?
"&gt;Just saying, Pistons beat the Celtics with no Kemba Walker,  This makes Celtics better."
"Oh no, you can‚Äôt ask most folks from the Celtics subreddit to be reasonable about Kemba Walker.  They have gone beyond acknowledging he is playing poorly (he is, no doubt) to full on subreddit rage blackouts. Kemba is utter shit to them, *never* a good basketball player (yep, they say that), and we would apparently, to many of them, be better off packaging picks together to dump him. It‚Äôs really made that subreddit a pretty insufferable place these days. It sucks all the joy out of being a Celtics fan and is just way too much Kemba hate."
"Jaylen and Jayson are All Stars. Smart is a meaningful playoff starter. Theis is good, Pritchard, Williams and Williams all have promise and can stay in a playoff game. All told thats a 7 player rotation, where only 4 of those players can close. This is life when Kemba Walker plays poorly.    There's gonna be a tipping point soon, where we have to decide to either fall forward into being a contender, or fall backwards and take serious stock, maybe soft giving up this year to be sure we have the team for the next 3. Suspenseful times."
"This an honest Q, would you take Kemba Walker?"
Here are all the guys people will want to mention ranked in my opinion. Lot of these guys are really close to one another. Especially in the range of Holiday to Murray.  1. Stephen Curry 2.

"Blockbuster Trade that will change the NBA and will make every team better. Teams involved are Bucks, Heat, Wizards, &amp; Celtics  Bucks receive: Russell Westbrook, Bradley Beal  Wizards receive: Kris Middleton, Kelly Olynyk, Kendrick Nunn, Robert Williams, Donte Divincenzo, DJ Wilson, 4 bench players from the heat to make the cap work. &amp; a first round pick from the bucks.   Heat receive: Kemba Walker, Thomas Bryant, 2nd round pick from Bucks   Celtics receive: Jrue Holiday, Andre Igoudala, 2nd round pick from Bucks     What this trade does:  The East instantly becomes very competitive.   Miami Heat: They will get better by adding Kemba Walker for basically Kendrick Nunn and Olynyk. They‚Äôll have Thomas Bryant under contract for next year and will only get better with a core of Kemba Herro Robinson Butler Adebayo Myers Leonard Dragic and Avery Bradley. Kemba will add a lot of fire power to their offense. He will fit right in with all of the shooters and ball movement the Heat play with. Instant championship contenders barring injuries.  Celtics: The Celtics are a great young team as of right now. The duo of Tatum and Brown looks better everyday. The problem is as of right now is that Kemba doesn‚Äôt fit well with them. He is also a liability on defense for them. This trade will get them Jrue Holiday and Iggy. They will get a lot better on defense and I think Jrue would fit right into their team. Iggy will be a nice piece off the bench. They do lose Robert Williams, but that is why they get a 2nd round pick in return.   Bucks: This should be a no brainer for them if they want to compete. At the end of the day it is a long season and they can definitely turn it around in the playoffs. But they can also have Russ, Beal, Giannis as their core. They have a great bench and solid role players. This trade will make them a championship threat rather than a hopeful run. By the looks of it, they will lose in playoffs the same way they‚Äôve lost the last 2 years. Especially if they have to see the Nets. This trade possibly makes them the best team in the East. Bradley Beal is a heck of a player that got want to have. If Giannis can get a player that can score at will and on top of it get the energy Russ brings, they will be extremely hard to stop.   Wizards: The Wizards are in rebuild mode. The Wizards will lose Westbrook and Bradley Beal. They will be getting in return a whole lot of prospects and players they can offer for trade. Kris Middleton is in his prime and has multiple years under his contract. It might be hard to move him right now but in the future there will be some value for him. They will be getting Kendrick Nunn and Robert Williams. Both players could be future all stars. Dante Divincenzo who is a solid role player. Kelly Olynyk who they can always use for trade bait. They will also get a bunch of other young guys and a first round pick from the Bucks to top it all off.   In the end, all of these teams get better. The east will have multiple contenders consisting of the Nets, Bucks, Heat, Celtics, and 76ers. You won‚Äôt be able to tell who will win the east if this trade happens. As of right now the Nets will probably win the east.. This trade definitely makes it unpredictable as to who will win the east.    Who says no to this trade? Let me know your feedback."
"Kemba Walker single handedly cost the Celtics 9-10 games this season so far. And it's only just been 25 or less games in the season. He was quite subpar most of the last season as well. Very easy to neutralize, and it's just the regular season..  &gt;  People actually was being ignorant little shits, acting like he could ever replace Kyrie. So typical.. The idiocy    Despite all his problems and flat earth horseshit or whatever stupid fuckery.. Kyrie was still worth 100x more as a player.  His trade value was extremely high, regardless.   &gt;  But the Celtics lost him for free in the end, and replaced him with KEMBA WALKER. That's hilarious..    Their ""NBA FINALS/championship"" window might very well be shut by now. Even though LeBron is no longer in that conference.    &gt;  I love Kemba, and i often root for him.  But that's just a horrible business decision by the Celtics.  Even 5'8 IT was a far superior player and BIG GAME performer, but they stabbed him in the back.  Boston fuckin Celtics   What happened to Danny Ainge? He's just trolling himself left and right"
Kemba walker is so fucking bad man... it‚Äôs so sad to watch
" **Kemba Walker can't throw a ball into a swimming pool. Last 6 games: 2-12, 4-20, 9-19, 6-18, 1-12, 6-15. Anyone else have him on your fantasy basketball team?**"
I've watched a lot of Kemba walker and he relies pretty heavily on high degree of difficulty shots. When those shots aren't falling it just looks bad.   Heel figure it out though. He always has.
God. This post-game show is so annoying. We just spent half the highlights talking about Kemba Walker.
Kemba Walker sucks ass my goodness  2/12  Would any team want him at this point?

"Well this year Powell is better then Walker mostly because of the knee injuries popping up, but at least Kemba has the track record."
I mean if we just made basketball hockey Kemba Walker wouldn‚Äôt be able to play and Ben Simmons would dominate the league. Do we really want that (I do but seriously)?
"He signed Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, and Kemba Walker in 3 of 4 offseasons  He hasn't really made big trades but he's definitely retooled the team plenty. It just a) hasn't worked and b) is around the margins"

"""Or"" isn't enough.    Over the past 5 years, Danny brought in:  Isaiah Thomas + Al Horford + Gordon Hayward + Kyrie Irving + Kemba Walker + Jayson Tatum + (soon to be All-Star) Jaylen Brown.   If ""or"" was enough then people would already be satisfied. Danny fell short because he didn't bring in all those guys ""and"" more.  You have to get every single All-Star in the NBA or you are a failure."

"Bro he literally took a game off of the most talented NBA team ever assembled without Jaylen Brown, Robert Williams, or Kemba Walker.  Miss me with that shit. Tatum had the most 50 point games this season (45% of them). He‚Äôs one of the great scorers miss me with that shit."
"Around the 2020 All-Star Game, Giannis didn't want Harden on the team because Kemba Walker can pass.

That takes no skill at all,"" Harden said. ""I gotta actually learn how to play basketball and how to have skill. I'll take that any day.""   &gt;   &gt;While Harden didn't mention a player by name, his comment came after Nichols mentioned Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo's joke about taking Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker over Harden in the All-Star Game draft since he wanted someone who would pass the ball."
"Tough era to get over the hump because any given year during his career, him, Kyrie, Curry, Dame, Chris Paul, Kemba Walker, IT, Derrick Rose, James Harden, Kobe Bryant were all in the mix for all-NBA. I think the 2 years he absolutely deserved it were the years he got it which I think were 2015 and 2016."
"Which is the point right?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.  Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  There is definite rewarding of winning for certain guys on that list but not others."
"&gt; Booker has a way better team than Beal, and the Wizards almost made the playoffs with an awful team, oh yeah, and he also has better numbers  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Devin Booker last year 27/4/7 on 62% TS, missed the play-in by half a game, and received 3 All-NBA third-team votes.   Russ was the 3rd team guard also finishing ahead of him was Beal, Lowry, Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, and Kemba Walker. Booker finished 12th in guard voting.  This year he finished 10th.  Just seems like goal posts shifting to me."

Let‚Äôs just look at these playoffs: LeBron, AD, Chris Paul (who is obvisohyl looking better now), Harden, Mike Conley, Jamal Murray, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Dontae Divencenzo, Embiid, Kyrie, Hunter+Reddish. Basically every team had a very significant injury or two.  Yeah, everyone is usually banged up by this time but this has been different.

"&gt; The national basketball team for Yugoslavia if it still existed would be nuts and could 100% take down Team USA.  I think 100% beating Team USA is hyperbolic unless they're playing the same 2019 roster, in this hypothetical scenario, which included: Harrison Barnes, Jaylen Brown, Joe Harris, Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Mason Plumlee, Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Myles Turner, Kemba Walker, Derrick White.  That being said, a Yugoslavian team would wreck shop."
"The gap between the team the US put out two years ago and its best team is massive. If the US actually sent their best players, you're looking at something like:  Steph curry, LeBron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Draymond Green, and DeAndre Ayton.   The team that they actually sent was:  Marcus smart, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen brown, Harrison Barnes, Derrick white, Mason plumlee, Khris Middleton, Kemba walker, Joe Harris, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Donovan Mitchell."
"Huh? How does starting Smart ruin our forward framework? We obviously need to add size to this team, which is why I‚Äôm not giving you names of point guards to add. I don‚Äôt want to invest in point guard. I don‚Äôt want to invest in Kemba Walker. I am good with a Smart, Brown, Tatum backcourt and adding size instead. I can give you almost a dozen names of players with size, because unlike point guard, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm interested in adding‚Ä¶ Larry Nance Jr, Al Horford, Kristaps Porzingis, Harrison Barnes, Marcus Morris, Christian Wood, Myles Turner, Thad Young, Kyle Anderson."
"I think the max they each could have taken was either 16 or 17 and they took 14.5 or something. It wasn‚Äôt some massive pay cut you are trying to make it out to be, nor anything remotely close to Kawhi taking 10 a year, 20M less than he‚Äôs actually making. Stop it.   You people are so hyperbolic. Chris Bosh was the equivalent to Demarr Derozan on the Raptors or Kemba Walker on the hornets. He was far closer to a Nikola Vucevic than an NBA superstar."
Superstar is definitely a major stretch.  His situation in Toronto was very much like Kemba Walker in Charlotte.    Legit All-Star on an otherwise awful team in Toronto that was good enough to carry them to .500 ball but nowhere near good enough to get them anywhere in the postseason.
"Smart taking over as starting PG when we could simply just keep Kemba Walker is a ridiculous suggestion. I‚Äôm sorry, the Celtics are not better just‚Ä¶ without Walker. Brown rocked it all year as SF. Shifting him to SG and Tatum back to SF doesn‚Äôt feel like the right move to me. Yes we need a better starting center, or maybe someone to support RWIII if he‚Äôs healthy, but like I keep saying this isn‚Äôt me saying ‚ÄúKemba is perfect on the Celtics‚Äù, it‚Äôs me saying ‚Äúrealistically there isn‚Äôt a better option right now so let‚Äôs not just dump a borderline All-Star‚Äù.   I‚Äôm fine with moves being made but this suggestion of ‚Äúoh well take walker‚Äôs 19 away and we‚Äôll just make up for it elsewhere and Smart can be PG‚Äù I don‚Äôt see the logic of. Tell me who we get?"
And I‚Äôm still waiting on you to name an **available** point guard that solves all those problems. It isn‚Äôt there yet and neither is our young guard core so I‚Äôd rather keep the dude who was literally an All-Star last year over whatever 9/6/2 guy is willing to come aboard.  Lillard would be ideal but I don‚Äôt see it.  All I‚Äôm trying to say is that Kemba Walker is still a quality basketball player and is we end up keeping him it‚Äôs by no means a death sentence.
"He‚Äôs past his prime nobody‚Äôs denying that, but I reiterate, who amongst available point guards makes this team better than Kemba Walker? Like I said, unless we make a big trade for Lillard, guard core is too young to not benefit from Walker‚Äôs presence."
"Bam is definitely a better player than Ben, and so is brown. This is because i cannot pretend that Jalen brown doesn‚Äôt exist while I‚Äôm defending.   Bam is probably the only legit 1-5 defender in the league, and I‚Äôve seen him shut down guys as varied as Giannis to kemba walker in high stakes playoff matchups 1v1.  His ability to take these 2 1v1 off of a switch is why the heat made the playoffs last year. If they had to pull the box out for kemba like the raptors did, they would have gotten toasted by the Celtics.   I said possibly RJ or Garland because who knows? They took massive steps forward just like brown and bam did. It‚Äôs too early to tell for them and the most recent class.   &gt;it‚Äôs still a risk  I‚Äôd choose a 30% chance of a legit star over having a 100% chance of not getting one."
"It‚Äôs hilarious that y‚Äôall think Luka should be contending right now and genuinely think a Kemba Walker that has knee issues like KP but is a lot older, a trash defender, and averaged 12/4/4 on 32/17/90 in the playoffs is the answer"
Kemba Walker
"I really think some sort of Walker + picks/young guys for Westbrook is best for all parties if the Wizards decide to tear it down. Westbrook has his own injury concerns but potentially less of an issue than Kemba. He has a much higher ceiling for this Celtics team when healthy, is a *far* better playmaker/creator for others compared to Kemba (something they really need since the Jays have understandably struggled with taking full responsibility of that), and is a badly needed vocal leader in the locker room and on the court. The Jays with late season Westbrook are right back in the hunt in the East.       The Wizards save a few million (after salary matching) in each of the next two years, can probably get back some secondary pieces for the rebuild, become bad enough to tank in the East, and still get a decent locker room veteran so their young guys aren't just running around without any direction (see Bulls or pre-Rose Knicks). Westbrook gets likely his last shot at being a core member of a championship contender. Before Stevens moved to the FO, he would have been one of the best coaches Westbrook's ever had so remains to be seen what happens there. Kemba deals with less media pressure in DC and even more opportunity to rest the knee. Obviously it wouldn't be ideal for him to go to a tanking team but he really doesn't have much choice if the two sides can agree to the rest of the deal."
"Then we don‚Äôt do it.  Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, and 3 FRPs + Swaps is more than enough for a 30 year old point guard who relies on explosiveness with a $50,000,000 contract.  Kemba was an Ironman once to."
"Kemba Walker is not good. If he was performing well, he wouldn't want to leave."
Zero shot any gm trades Westbrook for Kemba Walker.
No they need kemba walker !
Kemba Walker will be an expiring contract after next year‚Ä¶you‚Äôll be able to get rid of him pretty easily after 2021-22 if you just wanted him for next season.

"i commented a year ago on some thread basically saying this and got downvoted massively. people here really think that your teammates would prefer their GM support a player unconditionally rather than try to make the team better. it's not personal -- the celtics paid kemba walker a massive amount of money and he's not living up to it at all. you owe it to the other players on the roster to try and make the team the best it can be. it's especially true when you have a player who is injury prone, a defensive liability, and consuming a shit ton of your cap."

"""4 Trades for Kemba Walker that put Celtics back into contention, while gutting the other teams"""
The asset needs to come back in a trade. Even with Walker off the books they have to match salary. So they‚Äôll need to take in close to equal salary in return. It‚Äôs not like they can just clear Kemba to sign a big free agent.
Ah NY legend Kemba Walker whose signature college game was in MSG?
No trade centered around Kemba Walker is putting the Celtics back into contention.

Any chance you blazers would be willing to swap for one Kemba Walker. He has a beautiful smile.
He looks like Kemba Walker low key
"there's 15-20 NBA teams that would've killed to have Ainge as the GM or to get even one of Tatum/Brown, let alone both.  Also everyone loves to forget that Ainge hit on Smart, Robert Williams, Al Jefferson, Rajon Rondo and more.  Oh yeah, he hired Brad Stevens, too.  The Kemba Walker contract was fine last year when he was an all-star but is aging poorly and unfortunately will continue to do so, and losing Kyrie for nothing hurts even if they didn't really give up that much to get him.  Horford looked cooked in Philly and Hayward was hurt again for a good chunk of this year (his contract also has a significant chance of being onerous by the end), all the hand wringing about him is pretty overblown and his credentials as a top GM are bona-fide.  Anyhow it's over now, the Jazz are very much not dead and I hope they beat the Clippers, I respect the hell out of Quin Snyder and Dennis Lindsey for putting together this roster &amp; getting the most out of them."
First mistake is that I don't watch every team.  I guarantee I watch more of the league than you do.  A great defensive big isn't gonna get you a superstar especially when you have to attach a negative value contract in Kemba Walker to make the money match.  That's like me saying CJ McCollum can get you Kevin Durant if I attach Nurkic and a bunch of first round picks.
"3rd in the NBA in WS/48 behind only Jokic and Embiid.  Celtics record with Rob starting, 10-3. Celtics record without him starting, 26-33.  I seriously don‚Äôt give a shit if someone who doesn‚Äôt watch the team has opinions on our players and tells me how valuable or good they are. You haven‚Äôt seen his impact with your own eyes.   A package of Robert Williams, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, and every FRP + Swap is absolutely a superstar sized haul. You don‚Äôt know shit."
"This was after Giannis threw two shots at him. The first was when he picked Kemba Walker over Harden for the All Star Game because he ‚Äúwants someone who‚Äôll pass the ball‚Äù. After the game, he said, ‚ÄúOffensively, we were just trying to find whoever James Harden was guarding. That‚Äôs who we thought we‚Äôd have an opportunity to score on.‚Äù Harden made the remarks quoted above after Giannis said those things about him. I think Giannis was joking but Harden was probably less likely to laugh it off because he felt he‚Äôd been robbed when Giannis won the MVP."
"Dude me too.  I feel SO MUCH better now as a Boston fan, without Brown, Williams, and Kemba Walker; who at this point should just walk up to the alpha on the other team and hold his pocket for the whole game.    Milwaukee fans should honestly be embarassed.  They don't even HAVE HARDEN.  This is utterly baffling, to me."
"As a BOSTON fan, with 25% + of our team injured and the most bottom bitch star ever, kemba walker, I gotta say you Bucks fans should be absolutely embarassed.  And let me say, I am rooting, HARD, for Milw.  For betting purposes and because the gentrification, focus group aesthetics of the Nets is probably the lamest thing I've ever seen.  But this is absolutely pathetic.  I will say, I'm absolutely loving Griffin 2.0. I never thought he was washed up.  Biding his time, on a bad team.  Good on him"
"Someone will. There's always someone. They'll look at his bubble production or his numbers during the season and convince themselves he's been misused and just needs the right players and system around him and by golly they're gonna be the ones to do it. I imagine what will end up happening is some team trades their own KP in basically a swap of underperforming overpaid players. Think Kemba Walker. That or they'll send over a few lesser but still overpaid players and maybe a young guy in exchange for KP and a pick, with some other junk on either side to make things match salarywise."
Celtics aren't giving up Brown for a 30 year old. We already made that mistake with Kemba Walker.
You think Kemba is that much of a negative asset? Idk who would have to give assets to who in that scenario they both seem like a net neutral Walker only has 2 years left. Mavs do the deal tomorrow if y‚Äôall throw in Smart
...without Jaylen Brown. And Kemba Walker for half the series.

"I agree. Honestly, I say move him for another shitty contract that's 1-2 years shorter. It's worth it. Maybe Kevin Love or Kemba Walker. Walker would actually give them a secondary ball handler, too."
"You do realise Team USA brought Donovan Mitchell, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Harrison Barnes, Myles Turner, and Khris Middleton to the 2019 World Cup and still finished seventh, right?"
I‚Äôve seen him on espn being hunted by an injured kemba walker. I saw him getting killed by goran dragic in the playoffs.  He gets killed off of switches.  &gt;no embiid in the west   Myles Turner fouled out in 3 quarters trying to play Dwight. Jokic would eat him.
"Boston Celtics, traded for Kemba Walker."
That's a good question and I don't feel equip with enough knowledge and the Mavericks to answer. Maybe they should take a chance on Kemba Walker or Al Horford.
"Hey, I‚Äôm pretty sure the Celtics would happily taken him off your hands in exchange for the amazing Kemba Walker."
"Kemba Walker. If I am Celtics, I will do it."

Worse contract: Kristaps Porzingis or Kemba Walker?
I‚Äôll trade you one Kemba Walker
"Kembra's career 3 pt shooting is 0.36. Demar's career 3 pt shooting is 0.281. So yes, you're right on that.     Here are the career 3pt% of our young core.     White: 0.357   Murray: 0.332   Walker: 0.369 (higher than Kemba!)   Johnson: 0.36 (same as Kemba)   Vassel: 0.347     I don't know what games you were watching last year, but we're good on 3 point shooting. If anything, letting Demar walk will benefit us because our young core gets more minutes.     You say leadership, but Pop spoke high praise of Murray's leadership on the team.  Pop gave Murray the reigns to the offense in his second year, even though Tony Parker was still on the team. We also have veterans like Mills and Gay to help the young talent develop.     You brought up reasons for Kemba that are not applicable for us. Granted, Kemba is an excellent player who is exactly what the Clippers need. And I'm surprised Boston would want to give up on him, considering he's necessary for that team to get over the playoff hump. But as things stand, the Spurs have no use for him."
Embiid for Kemba Walker and a lobster roll
"New Orleans traded Jrue for negative value Bledsoe and a bevy of picks, Houston traded Harden for bevy of picks and broken Dipo. It‚Äôs not great obv but who‚Äôs going to give the Blazers a better return than Walker/Smart/young player/4-5 frps- again this scenario assumes that Dame demands a trade and that Cs are on his list. It‚Äôs not a huge market, the other contender-adjacent teams that would be willing/able to open the vault via draft capital are not going to send a young star back either. You need to match Dame‚Äôs salary.   Now I‚Äôm not saying this is realistic necessarily just more so that a Jaylen for Dame trade does not actually set Boston up for contention and it‚Äôs contingent on Cs moving Kemba elsewhere anyway so I think it‚Äôs unlikely af."

"There‚Äôs a very upvoted post in their sub talking about every playoffs team has at least one better second option than THJ this playoffs and that‚Äôs why people should start considering Luka as the best player in the nba if he wins this series.  Some guys they named as better on the Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier when only one of them was healthy   Some guys from other teams: Herro, maybe Kendrick Nunn, and ‚Äúarguably‚Äù Kuzma, Drummond, and Harrell"
"Legit no one is disrespecting KLove. I was purely comparing 2018 Kevin Love to 1995 Clyde Drexler, why are you changing the subject? Booker has sample size of 6 games bro, wtf are you even trying to prove here? You want to dive into ""empty stat"" (which I never said this was a case) players who take a deep dive in all statistic categories when they join a contender? Here is a list: Kemba Walker, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Paul Milsap, Melo.  Find my quote that says ""Lebron made his teammates stats/play better""? Are you just pulling shits out of your ass now? So you can squeeze some comments out?  &gt;Sure you can bring up the finals team Lebron went up against in 2018. The difference is Hakeem won.   &gt;   &gt;Also, the 1995 Magic are the only team who can say they Beat MJ Bulls in their prime.  Uh, yes you are comparing Hakeem's opponents to Lebron's, and it is embarrassing even trying to deny you are not. What the actual fk am I reading here?  No one acted like that, you just hate him so much and keep thinking this way. Whole 2016 Cavs roster did the job, every single member contributed. Stop it.  Stop hating, it is so embarrassing to read, very cringe."
He's probably on that Kemba Walker level.  At least he's young.  Kemba looks like degenerative injuries for an old guy.  Maaaaaybe CJ McCollum if the Mavs throw in something else.
He picked kemba walker over him in an all-star game then started backpedaling when harden was available for a trade lmao
"Harden:""I wish I could be 7-feet, run and just dunk. That takes no skill at all,"" Harden said. ""I gotta actually learn how to play basketball and how to have skill. I'll take that any day."" While Harden didn't mention a player by name, his comment came after Nichols mentioned¬† Giannis Antetokounmpo's joke about taking  Kemba Walker over Harden in the All-Star Game draft since he wanted someone who would pass the ball."
"So in other words, 5 games against a Celtics team who was starting Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier and Tristan Thompson until they had to start Romeo Langford... yuh"
"Well yeah but jayson tatums supporting cast consisted of Marcus Smart and the ghost of Kemba Walker, not two other borderline all-nba talents who are great at perimeter defense."
"There's no way around it except raising the max salary. If players like Dame, LeBron, Kawhi, Harden, KD are gonna get paid the same as Mike Conley, John Wall and Kemba Walker, you bet your ass they're gonna get theirs in some other way."
"Not sure how any Knick fan can be disappointed with this offseason. We essentially traded Ntilikina, Elfrid Payon, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker.  And didn't give up ANY assets or sign any long term high dollar deals."
that's kemba walker
pre-apology for when olshey takes evan fournier mitchell robinson and kemba walker plus picks for dame at the deadline
"Kemba Walker is great value @ 8m, I think."
Kemba big money walker
"We replaced Elfrid Payton with Kemba walker for 8 million. And that is bad, how? You sound salty."
This is a post about Kemba Walker signing with the Knicks.  Nothing to do with the playoffs.  Nothing to do with the Hawks.  Yet here you are. A clown.
"The whole debacle leading up to that pick was stupid.  Iirc, Boston owned pick #24 from Philly in the 2019 draft. Boston packaged that pick and Aron Baynes to Phoenix so they could clear salary for Kemba Walker. Remember that Boston had to package this year's first along with Kemba to get off his salary.  Anyways, that #24 was traded for a future first that ended up being Desmond Bane, but Boston traded that pick too for future seconds.  Fucking waste."
"Bro 8 million is nothing in today's NBA lol. 2.5 or 2.6 mill is a minimum, a MLE is around 6 million and trade exceptions are usually 8+ mill.  If you told me five years ago you could get Kemba Walker for an MLE I would shit my pants."
"Knicks were a top 2-3 defensive team last season and the 4 seed. We took the same roster and traded Elfrid Payton, Frank Ntilikina, and Reggie Bullock for Evan Fournier and Kemba Walker. I'm not sure where your logic is?"
"Imagine replacing Bullock and Payton with Fournier and Kemba Walker, while keeping the rest of the roster."
"Knicks, they didn‚Äôt give up future assets, added much needed scoring without sacrificing key defensive players like not signing Noel who was low key the best defensive center stat metric wise last season, oh and added Kemba Walker for like 8 mil so even if he only gives you 30 games it‚Äôs not a huge financial risk."
Omg yes. 31 year old Kemba Walker was gonna be the difference between OKC making the playoffs and being a bottom feeding team.
Ben Simmons has never lost to the Knicks or Kemba Walker and now they are teaming up.
Oh no whatever will we do without our 100th young guy and knee-less Kemba Walker?
"We replaced Elfrid Payton and Reggie Bullock with Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we have gotten significantly better while keeping our chemistry from last season. Will we finish higher than the 4th seed? I don‚Äôt know, but we will be a better team than last year."
"This isnt true at all...The knicks biggest issue was Elfrid Payton, and consistent scoring, and they replaced Elf with Kemba Walker, and added Fournier, and have one of the better defensive centers in the league coming back from injury. They were one basket from being up 2-0 to Atlanta, but instead folded. They got alot better. It wont get them up to the bucks, nets, sixers level, but they will be alot more ready come playoffs."
Tbh I think on paper we are MUCH better but the rest of the East improved too. But objectively speaking the gap between Elfrid Payton and Kemba Walker is MASSIVE.
"How are the moves not good? their biggest weakness in the playoffs was Elfrid Payton getting minutes and scoring, and they added Kemba Walker and Fournier, and have one of the better defensive centers in the league coming back from injury..all the contracts are very reasonable, and able to be traded if needed."
Kemba Walker to the New York Knights after OKC buys out his contract. This year will be insane.

Thunder Legend Kemba Walker
Whenever I see Kemba Walker play in MSG i always remember his game winner vs Pitt. I'm hyped.
"I know people will criticize this move considering Kemba's injury history, but I will take an injured Kemba Walker over Elfrid Payton anyday of the week."
&gt; Kemba Walker heals up and returns to his 2019 all star form  Celtics were waiting for that for 1.5 seasons with liberal load managing. It doesn't look like he can become his all star self and its pretty sad because he's one of best players you can root for
"""I'm coming home again""  -Kemba Walker"
It‚Äôs gonna be OKC for Kemba Walker and less picks than the Sixers want. Morey‚Äôs just gonna have to settle for less
"Well they *have* got some top name free agents in recent years. Al Horford was one of the top players available the year they signed him, as was Gordon Hayward, as was Kemba Walker. I think Boston absolutely *can* get free agents to sign there, but their ownership is generally pretty cheap and has not traditionally been willing to go into the luxury tax unless the team is without question a title contender."
"The Thunder can fix some of those issues. Kemba Walker, Isaiah Roby, Ty Jerome and Kenrich Williams and the Houston picks for Simmons. Jerome shot 43% on 5.3 3PA last season, some of those were pretty deep and he's a legit backup point guard. Kenny Hustle is a do it all forward who also shot above 40% from outside last season, he also has a wet mid-ranger. Roby is another decent 4/smallball 5 who can score inside and pass the ball. Isaiah's not perfect but dude is tough. With those three players, Philly fills out their bench with decent, productive contributors on cheap contracts. Kemba is another effective outside shooter who can provide perimeter creation. It is breaking a dollar into quarters but Philly get better as a team with this move."
"&gt;Umm Kemba Walker, Enes Kanter?  Whoops! Forgot about those star players!   You almost need 2 hands to count  all star games between them."
"Umm Kemba Walker, Enes Kanter? Also the Celtics haven't had the cap space since 2019"
"Another player 24/4/4 on 50/38/80 at 22. And that player is Collin sexton. Both are in losing situations.   Stats don't always tell the story. I'm just saying the narrative on a player changes drastically once they get paid.   Look at DeAngelo Russell, De'aron Fox, pascal siakam, kemba walker. All these players were considered no-brainers for a max and now they get shit on because they aren't carrying teams.  Just saying look for the narrative to change if the team keeps losing."
"Someone on our sub said we haven‚Äôt been a well run organization for a couple of years now and I agree, lots of poor decisions made by the front office since 2019.  We should‚Äôve traded Rozier and/or Morris before trade deadline in 2019 when it was clear the team was dysfunctional. The 2019 draft was also a disaster considering we had 3 FRP, one of which was Thybulle and turned it into Carsen Edwards. Then also maxed an undersized Kemba Walker (same thing Ainge is praised for by avoiding maxing IT).  Now Stevens has to clean his mess up."
"Kemba Walker, Gilbert Arenas, Kawhi Leonard, and Denis Rodman"
I would do it in a heartbeat. The Celtics need to replace an overrated point guard in Kemba Walker with another in Schroeder haha
OKC have Kemba Walker
If the Kemba Walker trade this year proved anything it's that the final step in the cycle is Boston trades the player they spent too much money on to a bad team along with a pick to get back the guy they said was overpaid and who underperformed on that contract üòÇ
"2019: ""That's too much money to spend on Al Horford! Glad we let him go.""  2020: ""That's too much money to spend on Gordon Hayward! Glad we let him go.""  2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Evan Fournier! Glad we let him go.""  Bonus 2021: ""That's too much money to spend on Kemba Walker! Glad we gave up a first round pick to swap him for Al Horford."""
Unless the all star is Kemba Walker
You can follow me to get the latest updates on me freaking the fuck out when we trade assets away for Kemba Walker
"Literally makes me so angry that a rebuilding team with Kemba Walker making $30M, SGA about to sign a max extension, and two new young PGs really wants to come in and fuck us over. JUST FUCK OFF PRESTI GO PLAY AROUND WITH YOUR FUTURE FIRSTS."
Would you like one slightly dented Kemba Walker?
The son of Michael Jordan and kemba walker
"We were pretty damn healthy in the most important game of our season in Game 6 2020 ECF when Marcus Smart decided it was a good idea to chuck up 22 shots, more than Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown.   He is a terrible decision maker, especially when it matters the most, no doubt about it."
"Lol when they had +7 year contracts everyone complained.  A team would sign a player that wasn't worth it to a +7 year max and tank their team for a decade.  Imagine if guys like Kevin Love, Andrew Wiggins, Kemba Walker, and Gordon Hayward signed +7 year max deals."
"&gt;How this will change the terms of the deal is unknown. Boston can fit the 2021-22 salaries of both Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando into the Kemba Walker TPE. That would create a $9.7M TPE for Tristan Thompson.  &gt;All three teams have engaged on expanding the deal too. Now, it's TBD!  [follow up](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1422046080510930944)"
They should look at Kemba Walker. He wasn't as bad as everyone says he was last year. Would give Dallas a good secondary shot creator.
Can Sam Presti interest you in Kemba Walker?
"At the time it was a move that made sense. But in hindsight, it would have been better to save the TPE for the offseason.   The Celtics could have done the Kemba-Horford trade, but absorbed Horford into the full Hayward TPE. This would have created an even larger Kemba Walker TPE‚Ä¶..which could fit the salary of Bradley Beal. Then the Celtics could have focused their efforts on trading for Beal with picks and players but wouldn‚Äôt have had to worry about matching all the salary since they could absorb him into the TPE.   Now if the Celtics still want Beal they basically have to wait till next summer and clear the roster of essentially everyone outside of Tatum and Brown to sign him."
"Jimmy Butler, Mike Conley, Draymond Green even more, Kemba Walker, Russell Westbrook"
"Don‚Äôt forget Kemba Walker is available. I know everyone knocks him for being broken, but I‚Äôm calling it now: One of these teams that strike out on Lowry and Ball are going to get desperate and give up assets for Kemba. I‚Äôd bet there are teams that can talk themselves into trading for Kemba over signing Schroder."
"Lol.  Why would we need to work a sign and trade for Markannen? We have the cap space.  We'd just put an offer above the Bulls comfort zone and use his large salary as filler next year to trade for an all star with our draft picks.    And if we were open for a sign and trade, we'd just make you take Kemba Walker back."
He can without a doubt post up Kemba Walker and bad defenders.  Not sure why you believe otherwise.
"I get your point, but then he shouldn't be seen as a point guard. He should be seen as an oversized wing/small big who can keep up with point guards(on defense), but doesn't have the skills of a point guard(on offense)... which is entirely the case on Ben Simmons. He's an all-league defender who can legit guard 1-5, but can't take a jump shot nor can he post up Kemba Walker."
The problem is the evidence changes so quickly.  Do you want Kemba Walker on a contending team?  The Celtics would likely tell you no.  But we would have all said no about Chris Paul and Mike Conley at points previously too when they seemed washed up.
"The league changes so quickly.  Ben Simmons has a poisonous contract that scares most fan bases.  It‚Äôs like a 4 year contract though.  When he has a good season this year, we might all change our mind.  Kyle Lowry is so old.  He‚Äôs probably the most coveted free agent this offseason.  If he starts to have a bad season, his contract will suddenly be terrible!  Mike Conley had a terrible contract before and Chris Paul!  And now they‚Äôre highly coveted!  It makes you wonder what will happen with guys like Steven Adams, Kemba Walker, Al Horford.  The players are people and people can change, they can fully return from injury, fit in a better system, improve, etc. and we all just have to react to it and change our perception"
How the fuck was harden being an asshole? God you‚Äôre so biased. He said harden doesn‚Äôt pass and chose kemba walker
"Kemba walker, al horford, Gordon Hayward, all max contracts but sure keep tryna fit your narrative lol"
Did it? The Walker/Horford trade made the team better. Kemba was terrible.
Bronx native Kemba Walker is available for 1 FRP
Consolation prize- Kemba Walker üòÇ
Might I suggest a lightly used Kemba walker?
I read this as Kemba Walker at first ngl.
I get the feeling Kemba didn't want to be there anymore so I think it helps if your first trade as GM helps a good (or used to be good) player (all guesses but the arrangement that walker wouldnt stay long in OKC was probably agreed before he was traded there) and doesn't seem like a total fleece to prevent a reputation of being a hardass. Like the previous commenter said too its not like the PG market is barren atm and Kemba just isnt that good anymore.
"Dope: Steph Curry, Luka, Dame, Giannis, Tre Young, Joel Embiid and Jokic  Nope: Ben Simmons, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker, and Kristaps Porzingis   Hope: Zion, Cade Cunningham, Lamelo Ball, Anthony Edwards, and Bruno Caboclo (forever).   Heroes: Bobby Portis, Derrick Rose, Giannis x2, and Boban Marjanovic  Villains: Patrick Beverly, James Harden x2, Kevin Durant sometimes, and Jaxson Hayes  Current Old Guard: Lebron, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul  These are probably the most mentioned names on this sub and the most talked about players. I'm missing a bunch of stars, but these are the people that seem to garner the most attention. The forewords of each list isn't all encompassing, just a meme. The nope category is filled with all stars and a first ballot hall of famer for example."
"donovan mitchell, ban adebayo, jamal murray, pascal siakam, myles turner, devin booker, marcus smart, jusuf nurkic, clint capela, cj mccollum, rudy gobert, damian lillaird, draymond green, kemba walker, klay thompson, and jimmy butler‚Ä¶ are all players within the last 10 years drafted after the number 5 pick.   your point still stands but it also shows that you can get some pretty damn good - truly great players if you hit on your picks."
Can't fault a team for wanting to attach picks to Kemba Walker
"Kemba Walker, some random young role player, and many 1st rd picks maybe?"
"Haha so you're gonna use last year as hard evidence that the Jays need Bradley Beal? Most games missed due to injuries and covid, with 50% of Kemba Walker as our starting Point Guard? Maybe if we didn't have to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for 20 MPG, and start Tristan Thompson for 43 games, things would have been different. Our best 5 barely played together last year. If you think the Celtics were a Bradley Beal away from not being a .500 team then I don't know what you were watching."
"the raptors do not have a history of strong drafting. Just looking at lottery picks we have  3 in 2003: Chris Bosh. Great pick, made the raptors relevant and undoubtedly go the ball rolling for the current success they have now.  4 in 2004: Rafael Araujo. Bust. Andre Igoudala was the very next pick.  7 in 2005: Charlie Villanueva, hard to call him a bust, but he certainly was never more than an OK starter. Danny Granger was on the board and would've been better.   1 in 2006: Andrea Bargnani. Holy shit was Bargnani bad. player 7 years but but only average 15/ppg with awful rebounding and defence for a big man. LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay and Brandon Roy were right there.   17 in 2008: Not a lottery pick but we took Roy Hibbert and flipped him for Jermaine O'Neal who barely lasted a season and traded to Miami for Marion and Moon who did nothing.   9 in 2009: DeMar Derozan. ok, a good pick, no fault here and this pick basically one the NBA Final so kudos.   12 in 2010: Ed Davis. not a great pick, never really cracked 10ppg and ended up being traded for Rudy Gay. Could've picked Patrick Patterson who was a nice piece for the Raptors later on.   5 in 2011: Valanciunas was not a bad pick, he developed in a good player, but we could've taken Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, or Kemba Walker or Jimmy Butler.   8 in 2012: Terrence Ross. dude had some highlight reel plays but wasn't ever a world beater. Andre Drummond was the next pick and although taking him with Jonas wouldn't have been the right move, it is pretty obvious who the better player is.   12 in 2013: Traded for Lowry. great trade and in a terrible draft class it made sense. We could've taken Giannis, but no fault Lowry is an all-time Raptor.   HM to 2014 and 2015 and #20s Bruno Caboclo and Delon Wright, a developmental player who never developed. Could've taken Rodney Hood, Clint Capela, or Bogdanovic. Wright was picked over Bobby Portis and Montrezl Harrell.  We've blown 5 (arguably 6 or 7) of the 9 lottery picks we've had, 2 pretty spectacularly. Although the last few years have been good, historically when we draft top 5, we don't draft well."
And one Kemba Walker.
"He also passed up on drafting harden to draft ‚Äúthe stepback king‚Äù Kemba walker, despite hardens stepback that year being literally the most efficient offense of all time"
Kemba Walker for retaliation?
Kemba Walker to the Pistons
"Nah, you would get 6, 16, and 18 plus Kemba Walker"
"What if they give him for a bad contract, but still a good player. Maybe for Kemba Walker or best case scenario Russell Westbrook. Seems plausible and I could bet that Embiid would view Russ as an upgrade from Ben Simmons."
Terry¬†Rozier¬†for¬†Kemba¬†Walker¬†trade. Boston came out much worse out of that one.
"Everyone clamoring to throw huge money at Kyle Lowry while saying Kemba Walker is broken. Meanwhile, Lowry has only played 5 more games than Kemba in the last two seasons and he‚Äôs 4 years older. Perception is a funny thing."
"I low-key hate it when we say that a team got nothing if a player leaves in free agency. Kyrie leaving opened up the cap space to sign Kemba Walker, who pre-injuries, looked like a great leader for the young guys on the team (all-star starter, albeit from the East in 2020).  It's like saying the Warriors got KD for nothing. They had to give up Harrison Barnes and other role players."
"Tobias Harris is getting paid 180 million and Kemba  walker is getting 140, id say Siakam is a solid deal."
What kind of question is this lmao. Becoming better than Dirk is way harder than becoming better than Kemba Walker.
A Kemba walker CJ backcourt would probably be the worst defensive backcourt in NBA history
Kemba walker is their goat? Damn...
they gonna get kemba walker
"One Kemba Walker, coming right up."
"They‚Äôre not my team but I think they‚Äôll end up in it,  1. OKC  2. Kemba Walker, Darius Bazley, 2021 Boston 1st Rd, 2022 Phoenix 1st Rd &amp; 2023 Denver 1st Rd   3. Ben Simmons &amp; Shake Milton   4. IDK   5. Simmons is young enough to be a part of the Thunder rebuild and should mesh well with SGA. Milton is solid enough to start for OKC too.   Walker is still a solid PG and I think in the end this id the best they can get for Simmons, Bazley gives them a role player with some upside and the picks give them more ammunition to make other deals to help the team"
You‚Äôre literally the one bringing race up here when it doesn‚Äôt matter. Not many unathletic short great defenders in the league at the moment. We can say how good a Kemba walker or a Isaiah Thomas would be in Ben‚Äôs body if you wanna talk about offense
Knicks should pass on Kemba Walker &amp;  just draft a point guard from either of their 1st round picks
Kemba Walker and Antoine Walker both wore 8 for the Celtics.
"&gt; I don't see any team trading an all star-caliber PG for any combo of those pieces.   They might if that PG is either an unrestricted free agent who might tell his team to trade him to the Lakers or he'll just walk and leave his team with nothing (i.e. possibly Kyle Lowry or *maybe* Chris Paul), or if that PG is incredibly overpaid to where his team might just want to get off his contract (i.e. Kemba Walker or Russell Westbrook). It's not like they could use these pieces for Steph or Dame though, obviously.   &gt; the Lakers don't have many picks to trade.   They have the 22nd pick in this year's draft and their 2027 1st round pick, along with a bunch of 2nds.  &gt; Kuz has seemingly been on the trade market for years now and no trades have materialized.   That's not really accurate, or rather doesn't reflect the truth there. Up until free agency starts and Kuzma's extension kicks in, he'll have been on his rookie contract this whole time, meaning before this season he was on a deal that paid him less than $2 million per year. Just because of the need to match salaries, it's impossible to trade a guy making that little and get anything valuable in return, and at that price the Lakers wanted to keep him and see how he developed. It's tough to get good rotation players for less than the minimum like that.   Once Kuzma signed that extension last off-season it made trading him this year basically impossible because of [the poison pill provision,](https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1340781915226435588?s=19) and because the Lakers were hard capped. This upcoming free agency is really the first time in Kuzma's entire career where it will have made any sense for the Lakers to trade him. That's why nothing has ever materialized. People on here have talked about him getting traded for years, but it has never been realistic before now.   &gt; Lakers aren't really in any position of leverage with the assets they have.   This is wrong for one reason, and it applies to all three players: Bird rights. It's the same reason why Lowry is probably going to be signed and traded rather than just signing as a free agent: because the good teams who might want him are capped out, so he'll need to involve the team that has his Bird rights to get to where he wants to go.   Maybe if Schroder and Caruso get monster offers in free agency from teams they want to play for then they'll leave (as would Kyle Lowry if that happened), but it's highly unlikely that happens. Some shitty team with a lot of cap space isn't going to want to blow it on those guys. The only teams who might want to give them big deals are contenders looking for more depth, but those teams are capped out, and thus would need the Lakers involvement.   THT is a different case because he's [a restricted free agent that is Arenas limited,](https://youtu.be/YdCOrUGdgg8) meaning teams can't offer him more than the MLE, and the Lakers are able to match any offer he gets. So if some team desperately wants him, they probably will need the Lakers involvement as well.   So the Lakers don't have *total* leverage over those guys, but it's wrong to say they ""aren't really in any position of leverage."""
A 6'5 kemba walker
So just kemba walker?
how hilarious would it be that in the 2019 off season Philly signs Al Horford and Boston signs Kemba Walker only for Al Horford to end up in Boston by way of OKC and for Kemba to end up in Philly by way of OKC  why did Boston let Al Horford go again
I'd want =healthy= Kemba Walker.  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.
Why not send Kemba Walker back to Boston?
"&gt;Does your team want Kemba Walker? Seems like he'll be the consolation prize for those teams that miss out on Lowry, Conley, Paul, etc.  Ya, that's what I was thinking, there are a lot of veteran points available this offseason.  News this morning is that Dragic might end up a cap casualty in Miami for another option too.  So it doesn't feel like there's going to be much demand for Kemba, especially before he can prove he's healthy."
They don‚Äôt need his contract to hit min payroll. Presti will continue to take on washed up 30+ mil rehab projects to flip into more picks. Currently on deck: Kemba Walker
whoever gives up assets for freaking Kemba Walker needs to be fired lol
I think it would drive down the price of everyone. Of course Lebron would get the most but I think it would help in the regards to certain guys being Max players. Guys like kemba walker and similar talented guys would suffer the most.
"Is he worth his contract? Absolutely. You're right absolutely right that he doesn't help his teams much in the playoffs. But a healthy Ben Simmons can get you into the playoffs. He can make players better, he can shut down the best player on the opposing team. Not a lot of players at or around 30 million a year can. Not Kevin Love. Not Tobias Harris. Not Steven Adams. Not Wiggins. Not CJ. Not DeAngelo Russell. Not Otto Porter. I'd argue not even a healthy Kemba Walker because he can't defend. So even if Simmons never improves I'd take him gladly over a lot of the higher paid players."
"Alright, who wants one gently used Kemba Walker?"
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don‚Äôt fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he‚Äôs not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don‚Äôt act like later round lottery draft picks don‚Äôt turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
If you think you guys are getting a star for Kemba Walker you have another thing coming.
"I don‚Äôt think he has a lot of value. He‚Äôs older than most people think and isn‚Äôt a winning player. At best, maybe someone like Kemba Walker or someone on a similarly bad deal. I‚Äôm trying to think of playmakers because that‚Äôs what they need. Maybe like Goran Dragic. He‚Äôs not bringing back and all star."
Best player in the literal sense? Kemba Walker if they add enough salary on top to match
"Some of these comments are clearly bad faith. They see every offseason some teams taking contracts back for picks attached, but suddenly ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù when it involves a point they want to try to double down on  We just watched OKC take on 35million/year of Kemba Walker in exchange for a FRP, but suddenly 13m/yr is crossing the line"
"&gt; Does it?  It does when you combine the fact that they have a 1st round pick to trade alongside them. I'm willing to bet several rebuilding teams would be willing to take on some money over the next few years in exchange for a pick 22 in a deep draft.  &gt; What max/near max player are you getting with Kuzma and Harrell?  Kemba Walker, Buddy Hield, any impending FA on a team who wants a free first round pick for facilitating a S&amp;T."
"one thing that happened in the NHL was the expansion team asking for 1st rounders to pick the player from a team who had an unwanted large and long contract, i.e, kemba walker"
"Due to the shortened offseason, teams can trade recently-acquired players just 19 days after acquiring them.   **I am aware that the following would never happen. I just got a kick out of thinking about it and wanted to share.**  Imagine if Brad Stevens decides to blow it up and does this in a few weeks:   Thunder get:   * Jaylen Brown  * Jayson Tatum  Celtics get:   * Kemba Walker  * Luguentz Dort  * Theo Maledon  * Aleksej Pokusevski  * 13 1sts (the max OKC can send at this point)   Celtics basically inherit the OKC rebuild, minus Shai. Meanwhile OKC now goes forward with Shai/Brown/Tatum/Bazley/Bradley. I'm sure they could improve with free agent signings or other trades, too."
Kemba Walker definitely smiling atm right as I‚Äôm typing this
"Kemba Walker is always smiling &amp; looking happy, I always enjoyed his energy"
With today's Kemba Walker isn't that just Ben Simmons
‚ÄúKemba Walker but make him 6‚Äô8 tall‚Äù
Too bad you already traded Kemba.  Sex Walker  I mean c'mon
"&gt; that team had a single all-star in Kemba Walker  No excuse to play that badly, when Argentina for example got to the final with zero NBA players."
Most recently I said that the Celtics value their picks too much to use one just to dump Kemba Walker because its not like they get that cap space back anyway. Big oofus
East/west all star is so irrelevant. Just get the best players to start. Kemba walker at the starter was weird as hell.
They could try to trade Horford for someone like Kemba Walker.
"Cavaliers receive: Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle  Thunder receive: Kevin Love, 2023 top-8 protected FRP from Cleveland  76ers receive: Kemba Walker, Collin Sexton"
"Kemba Walker is 30, has degenerative knee issues and has begun his decline. If this were Kemba from 2 years ago? Absolutely.   But as it stands now, with how little games he will likely play, and the fact he most likely will be hampered come playoff time, this would be a bad solution."
"If that was the case we wouldn‚Äôt have Simmons in the first place. Joel is injury prone and is also apparently the entirety of the offensive plan for us. He physically can‚Äôt anchor both ends of the floor for an entire playoff run and it‚Äôs not fair to ask that of him. Trae lighting up Seth showed us that it matters, especially in today‚Äôs league. Jazz relied on Rudy too much on the defensive end and look what happens. One great defender with two completely sieves as a backcourt is not going to win anything. And I love Maxey but having two more of him was not the difference between the Sixers and a chip. Doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to gamble on two late picks being extraordinarily good and playoff ready just for Kemba Walker."
"That's not what imminent means.  &gt;a Kemba Walker trade is imminent, ~~though it is unclear whether the tradewill occur before or after the beginning of the 2021-22 NBA season~~ or it will happen later."
Imo teams should be trying to trade for Kemba Walker not that fraud Damian Lillard
Wiggins and Kemba walker to the 76ers;   Ben Simmons and Danny Green to Golden State;  Kelly Oubre and GSW 7th and 14th to OKC
Yeah that team had a single all-star in Kemba Walker. So a pretty significant difference lol. Most of the guys you named were still just 'promising rookies' in 2019
"&gt;If the Pistons really did turn down 2-3 first round picks then there‚Äôs no point in negotiating. No one is ever gonna beat that so we just hang up the phone.  I dont think this offer does beat it, I think the Pistons should have sold him to the Celtics then and would be mistaken to not sell him over the summer as well.  Also considering the Celtics immediately used #16 (the same value as #14 pretty much) just to dump Kemba Walker, so I think its a decent bet that #16 was involved (maybe taking on Kemba was too.)  Look, you dont have any way to improve other than trading Wiseman+Oubre or trading Wiggins, and I'm assuming if you want to win now you'd want to trade the former.  I just dont get why huffing and puffing about trade value when you have an opportunity to make the best roster around you. I'd overpay for a better shot at a chip (I personally dont believe this is an overpay, but that's besides this point), but maybe as a Warriors fan you are too spoiled by recent championships, you can't see how valuable that is to most people"
Cameron Payne can play Kemba Walker better then Kemba Walker can play Kemba Walker.
"3rd pick and kevin love for kemba walker, bazley and pick #6?"
"4 Teamer &amp; Works on Trade Machine:  Raptors:   - Porzingis - Malcolm Brogdon  Mavs:   - Myles Turner  - Rodney Hood  Pacers:  - Kemba Walker - OG Anunoby  OKC:   - Kyle Lowry - Draft Picks (Presti, duh)  Roast me if this is stupid. Thought of this in 2 min. Go Cers."
You will get a used Kemba Walker and you will like it.
"""Kemba Walker to transition to Celtics WNBA team"""
"""Kemba Walker reportedly upset after being passed up for both the new head coaching job and the GM position."""
"and also I‚Äôm not trying to make it seem like Dejounte is some amazing player that is a true championship quality point guard, idk if that‚Äôs true, but at the start of the playoffs is was agreed that the Sixers had a cakewalk to the conference finals and I think that if they had pretty much any other starting point guard in the league(outside of a few) over this version of Ben Simmons who did not attempt a field goal in the 4th quarter and averaged like 11 ppg they could beat an 8th seed and 5th seed as the 1st seed. Dejounte on this team would have Philly in the ecf, so would like Malcolm Brogdan, Kyle Lowry, Collin Sexton, either Ball brother, man maybe even healthy Markelle Fultz or half healthy Kemba Walker idk Ben Simmons was just that bad"
"Let‚Äôs be real. The idea that dozens of his peers have leapfrogged him is ridiculous.  Would you rather have Kemba Walker than Simmons? Murray? Derozan?   I‚Äôll agree that his value has taken a hit but he‚Äôs still all-nba defense.   And to your point, he is more of a regular season guy‚Ä¶but so what? If this is the best he is and ever will be‚Ä¶that‚Äôs still damn good and not worse than 30-32 players in the NBA.   I think the thought of him being the #2 piece on a title team has lost its luster a bit‚Ä¶but the third best player on a title team? Are people seriously pretending they‚Äôd rather have guys like Dennis Schroeder, Tyler Herro, and Colin Sexton? Sure they can sometimes put it in the whole but that‚Äôs about where it begins and ends.  Ben might not be what we all thought he could be, but what he is, is still a borderline all-star talent even if you have to take him out for hack-a-Ben situations. Which really just means you need a secondary ball-handler in crunch time. His defense is elite. As is his passing and rebounding. If he could develop even a below average jumper and just be more aggressive he would easily be flirting with all-nba lists again, but if he doesn‚Äôt who cares? Way worse players than Ben Simmons have made max money."
"Fox being on the team wouldn't change anything lol.  Literally everyone better than Kemba Walker opted out.  Kemba was like a top 20 or so player at the time, and literally every American better than him opted out.  That's why they finised 7th.  Tatum was their best player during the tournament but got injured before the knockout stage.  I believe all of the losses came when he was out.  When the top end of the roster is weak, it honestly doesn't matter what the last couple guys to make the roster do.  Guy #11 and 12 aren't the difference from 7th to medalling."
"&gt;Overall his shooting off the catch  Fox shot 32% from 3 this year--- that's actually terrible.  He shot 29% last year.  There are reasons the Kings aren't winning.    He's extremely fast, but World Cup team already had Kemba Walker.  You didn't need a 2nd, lesser undersized PG.  This about roles and chemistry and what the team needs."
"The NBA markets big stars. Luka, Giannis, Jokic are marketed pretty heavily. Booker was plastered everywhere as the next Kobe after his 70 point game, the Suns prolonging their rebuild and losing out on that hype is solely on them. Trae is the league's favorite young villain right now, he's gonna be on national tv a lot more now that his team is winning. Hell, this sub has been fuming because the pelicans were being overadvertised despite being a bad team all year thanks to the league being in love with Zion.   The Pacers and the Jazz were marketed in the 90s because of Reggie Miller and Malone/Stockton, not to run some small market charity. Get a generational talent, your team will get air time. The league not exuberantly advertising Nikola Vucevic or Kemba Walker isn't a wild anti-small market conspiracy lol."
As a long time fan of Georgia sports trae young is the most eclectic player we have had in this city since vick..and well since Julio is gone.. He has the fucked up hair of a bball legend ..see lebron  Trae got more or black einstein lool tho. Lol.  I dont think they have the team to win it this year.  But as I've said. Atlanta is an attractive city for athletes... and now the hawks have a player that other players will want to come play with. I'm not up on next years free agency but  trae young + atlanta will attract other players to the hawks next year.  I dont think they have anyone than can stop gianis this year but young have proved people wrong round after round.  If not this year... within the next 2 years the hawks will be in the finals. Yea I know us Olympic team aka the ners are there too.. but that team isnt gelling very well and I think the hawks are probably one more allstar on their roster from being in the finals possibly winning.  I know Kemba Walker will be leaving Boston. If someone like him could put aside this pride and come off the bench behind young.. or possibly young plays 2 guard and he plays 1. That could be all ir would take. They really need a small forward tho. If simmons switched to sf  and was mainly a defensive player who could average a trey deuce that would work too. At any rate. I expect the hawks to land trae young some type of all star sidekick and she hawks will be right there fighting with Brooklynn which may not be the same team next year. With the way kyrie is he could be on the move. Never know. I think harden will stick with Durant and who knows could have an okc reunion if they could find a way to get russ in Brooklyn but again I don't think that is a food fit nor do I think harden sharing the floor with kyrie is either   Interesting changing coming next year for the east and west.
"Exactly,  Right now everything is so overblown its insane.  There are people on our sub thinking the best we could get was kemba walker and we would still have to give up picks."
"...because I don't watch the Celtics? I just know who signs with them, I don't keep track of who's healthy and whatnot. Props to you for watching the ECF during KD and the Warriors reign. I just watched only the finals during those years.      Seems like Kemba Walker also was an all-star in Tatum's 3rd year. Trae Young doesn't have any all star players on his team, despite them being talented. Both Young and Tatum are ridiculously talented, but Young's ECF run is more impressive."
Mine are 3 Tor/PDX/Philly or OKC/PDX/Philly  CJ to Toronto Simmons to Portland Lowry to Philly   OR  CJ to OKC Simmons to Portland Kemba Walker to Philly  Contracts match within the CBA and each teams throw in some role players to reconstruct as the GMs see it.
And it's 100% accurate. We all knew he was terrible on offense (shooting wise). But it wasn't as obvious how big of a liability he was to the team until these playoffs. Dude passed up a couple wide open 6-8 footers cause he has 0 confidence. His contract is massive so they aren't going to get a Lillard level player..... More likely to be a Kemba Walker level player.
Fair enough! This sub is very reactionary and is prone as hell to narratives. Maybe he does develop for all I know. It‚Äôd be a great story and I love to see it. And you‚Äôre right. If we project Ben Simmons to be an ascending player he certainly would be a better piece than a Kemba Walker who will be descending over the next several years. I‚Äôm just not really that high on Simmons.
"1. The Portland proposed trades I've seen on this sub make a lot of sense for both teams actually.  I  find myself trying to talk myself out of it.  2. Unless Beal changes his mind. This isn't happing....plus with Russ there, that just seems to be a REALLY bad fit.  1. I guess a sign and Trade for Derozan?  Maybe add in someone like Murry or Walker.  1. IDK what the Jazz could give up that makes sense for their roster that Philly would want.  1. I know most people keep mentioning them but until Kemba plays and we get a chance to look at them knees.  I would stay away from him.  1. I would think this would be contingent on Minnys pick coveying to the warriors so you could do Simmons for Dray and both their picks from this draft?  But why would the Warriors do this? Other than youth and size is there an attribute Simmons has over Dray that would make him the better player for the warriors?  1. No we already have spacing issues we don't need more by adding Simmions.   1. Cavs should try to offload love and Philly should try to go after Garland.  I don't see a fit on the Cleveland side without some other roster changes for shooting.     1. Is Tillman still made at Morey?  Yes. Ok then nvm."
Well.. I‚Äôll trade kemba walker for Benny and mo picks..  - sam Presti
Kemba Walker come on down
I don't actually know why we would want him but that hasn't stopped us yet. We got a lightly used Kemba Walker we can get you real cheap too.
how bout simmons for kemba walker
"[Weiss] Brad Stevens on trading Kemba Walker: ""We have a lot of things we have to address appropriately and this was really hard. This was not a first few weeks on the job move, just because of the kind of person he is, how professional he is and how good of a player he continues to be."""
"players who had a 55% TS this season:  - anthony davis - kemba walker - ja morant - siakam  players who had a 55% TS in the playoffs:  - trae young - ben simmons (wow, someone who‚Äôs range is 5 feet had TS of 55% this postseason, even though you called it horrendous) - tobias harris - beal"
The 76ers would for sure trade Ben for CJ McCollum before Kemba Walker.
"Kemba will manage to turn it around, because SGA is an excellent fit alongside him in the back court. Walker's going to rehab his knee, get some rest and then be able to basically just take 18-20 FGA.   He'll average probably 20-22 PPG on 4-5 APG on sub 40% FG with 36-38% from 3P on 5-8 3PA.   And then people will exclaim, ""**oh my god** is Kemba Walker *back*?"" And then watch as Presti works his magic once again, and then gets one or two FRP's for him.   Bulls/Clippers/Lakers/Knicks could be all interested suitors."
"You think *giving up assets* to go from Simmons to Kemba Walker would make the 76ers better &amp; make embiid happier? lol...  I don‚Äôt disagree that Simmons needs to go, but the idea that it‚Äôll be a salary dump is pretty silly"
McCollum (sort of) or Kemba Walker is probably realistically all they would get for him.
"Simmons, a 1st and 2nd rd pick to OKC for Kemba Walker."
Will trade Kemba Walker for a 1st mid season too. Most likely.
That‚Äôs kemba Walker music!
"When you eliminate context from the player it‚Äôs easy to be fooled so easily. Porzingis had no inside or post game in NY either. He had these same weaknesses. He was just #1 option. If Luka leaves, Porzingis will average the same on the Mavs as he did in that ONE ‚Äúmax worthy‚Äù season on the Knicks (already injury prone back then btw).  Kemba walker is a similar scenario.  My bet is the next guy to end up like this is Zach Lavine. When he has to actually contribute on a contending team, their stats will suffer and guys like you will ask ‚Äúwhat happened?‚Äù"
‚Ä¶or Kemba Walker‚Ä¶
And that guard's name is Kemba Walker...
"Stevens, who moved into the role of president June 2, said dealing Walker was ""hard"" but that Boston was getting a ""very good player"" in Horford in return.  ""This was really hard. Not the ideal first few weeks on the job move,"" he said. ""That's because of the kind of person Kemba is, the kind of professional he is and how good of a player he is, and how good he'll continue to be as a player.""  Isn't Horford injury prone ?"
"The solution for Morey - sell high on Embiid by sending him to Miami in a 3-team deal and surround Simmons with more shooters to maximize Simmons desire to pass up open dunks for open three-pointers.   Here's the deal: We send Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro, Oladipo, and our 2025 FRP to Philly because mOrE ShOoTeRs! OKC unlocks protections on our 2023 FRP and we send them our 2028 FRP. We all know how Presti loves him those FRPs! OKC also sends Kemba Walker to Miami, we'll take that bad boy's contract on!   Philly can run a starting lineup of Simmons, Curry, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, and Danny Green, with Maxey, Thybulle, and Victor Oladipo off the bench for some added defense. Just imagine how many assists Ben would get per game!"
He‚Äôs gonna be on a non contender for a while after his trade.    Snatching Kemba walker came to mind. Pending health.
Ben Simmons and 2 firsts for Kemba Walker.  ftfy
Ben Simmons for Kemba Walker and 2 firsts who says no
Simmons and Picks to OKC for Kemba Walker  Or   Simmons and Picks to Any perennial lottery team   Or  Simmons and a pick to Portland for CJ
Let's see him get traded to OKC for Kemba Walker
"Celtics entered a rebuild pretty much at the same time as the process too. Since then:  Made an ECF with a bunch of misfits led by IT.    Used the talent on that team to create an apparent contender built around Kyrie, Hayward, and Horford. That team blew up due to injuries but made an ECF anyways with mostly rookies/2nd year/bench players.   Team blew up even further due to the continued awakening of Kyrie Irving, retooled for the third time around Kemba walker, Tatum, and Brown. Made the ECF.   That team was hard capped by kembas broken knees. Are now retooling yet again for a team with Tatum and brown as the undisputed leaders.   Obviously starting the rebuild with KG, Pierce, and Rondo as tradeable assets made things easier than they were for Philly, but you don‚Äôt need to suck for most of a decade to build a good team."
"&gt; I'm not sure what the pool for PG's are.  My understanding is that the most basic, fundamental laws of physics dictate that they will end up with Kemba Walker, and Presti will end up with a couple more draft picks."
Is Boston really going to look at the kemba walker era and decide to give up assets for the center version of that?
Ben Simmons and a first rounder or two for Kemba Walker you heard it here first
Probably end up getting picked up by Presti along with picks for kemba walker
Kemba Walker
Ben Simmons + 1st round pick for Kemba Walker  OKC gets a younger PG and a 1st round pick while Sixers get a better PG
"Welcome to Philly, Kemba Walker.  And Presti would like to thank the Sixers for the additional draft picks provided."
Hey that bag of chips has a name - its Kemba Walker
"Ben Simmons &amp; a first about to get traded to OKC for Kemba Walker, just you wait"
"Except not at all.  &gt;Philly did go all in for Butler  Celtics made a big trade \ll in for Kyrie.  &gt;and had to pay Tobi more than they should have because they tried to rush building a contender.  Then spent assets clearing cap space to bring in Kemba because they were trying to rush building a contender.   &gt;Boston has been the opposite and has played it cautious nearly every time.  Boston brought in more all-stars than any other team over a 5 year period and we've seen a few complete roster overhauls.  Celtic All-Stars over the past 5 years:  1. Isaiah 2. Horford 3. Kyrie 4. Hayward 5. Walker 6. Tatum 7. Brown  GSW are the only other team in the league who had +4.  Even Tatum and Brown weren't 'safe' picks. They traded the #1 pick for Tatum and reached hard for Brown. A team playing safe would have come out with Fultz and Dunn.  The only difference is that Boston's held to a higher standard. Other teams are only expected to bring in 1 star, Boston was expected to bring in every single star that was available."
"With Ben Simmons and Kemba Walker values being in the gutter, you don't know how much Kyle Lowry stans feel vindicated RN"
Thunder should trade Kemba Walker for Simmons straight up.
There is a Kemba Walker option üòÇ
Any big contract player available we would take for Simmons.  Give me Kemba Walker shit.
Or just send him to us for Kemba Walker and 2 first round picks
Kemba Walker for Ben Simmons and a second rounder. Who says no?? Hahahaha
Kemba walker we fucked up not holding him for longer
That‚Äôs Sam presti‚Äôs music. We have a Kemba Walker.
"Nah Harden was carrying a lot of injuries.   What can happen with iron-men players is that they play through a lot of shit and then it starts to catch up all at once.   Kemba Walker is a really great example. He missed 4 games total over his last 4 seasons with Charlotte, but Charlotte fans could tell you he had big knee issues during that time.   Then he comes to Boston and suddenly it all catches up to him and he can't stay on the floor.   Harden played through some mental injuries in Houston. There was one point where he couldn't turn his head because of a neck injury he was playing through.  Kobe was very similar too."
Yea that kp and th can probably get you kemba walker + salary filter instead. Go look at that range.
"From my understanding they have Dennis, Harrell, Gasol, etc coming off the books and Kuzma and KCP's contracts are pretty easy to move. I'm intrigued to see if they can get Kemba Walker from OKC. He hasn't been amazing but he's a way better scorer than Schroder."
He saw Kemba Walker smile and popped a big boner.
I would guess that the gap in maturity between 31 year old Kemba Walker and 44 year old Brad Stevens is much less than the gap in maturity between a teacher and a fourth grader but uh....go off I guess?
"""Never lived up to the billing, for whatever reason?"" This sounds like some revisionist history, let me refresh your memory.  2013-15: Rebuilding years, no expectations yet arguably exceeded them by making the playoffs in 2015 in a weak eastern conference.   2015-16: Lost to 4th seeded Atlanta hawks in the first round as the 5th seed. One of ONLY two teams to beat the Warriors at home this year. In fact, was the team to break their NBA record 54 game home winning streak. Both games with the NBA best warriors that year were highly competitive with the first being a double OT loss at home. Arguably no other team was as competitive with the warriors this season and Celtics would continue to be one of the most competitive teams with the warriors in the next couple seasons. (this is objectively the definition of not meeting but exceeding your billing)  2016-17: Lost in the conference finals as the one seed to the Lebron James led cavaliers, something James has a history of doing to top seeds. Went down to Chicago 0-2 AT HOME in the first round but after Brad Stevens made the decision to bench Amir Johnson in favor of Gerald Green the Celtics went on to win four straight. Three of which were in Chicago. Great coaching decision led to a series win.  2017-18: Acquired Gordon Hayward and Kyrie (via trade) and lost Hayward on DAY ONE of the season, and Kyrie later that season. Still took the cavs to seven games and eventually lost. Cavs would get swept by the dubs. Celtics split the season series with the Warriors and steph curry remarked ""It's looking very, very likely right now"" as to answer a question asking if they would see the Celtics in the finals. This was Jayson Tatum's first season and Brown's second, yet still made it very far without Kyrie at the end and Gordon for the entire year spare for a few minutes.  2018-19: Highly dysfunctional team with logjams at multiple positions. However, I do NOT pin this on Brad. As a Celtics fan I will never forgive Danny Ainge for being a giant pussy and not making a big trade this year. We had the assets and the NEED to given the crowded roster and he didn't do shit.   2019-20: Lost to Miami Heat in conference finals. Could not figure out Miami's zone. I'll give you this year. Kemba totally sucked all playoffs but still should have beaten the Heat.  2020-21: Celtics led the league in games missed due to Covid protocol. On top of that injuries to Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker (who never played back to backs and missed many other games), and eventually a season ending one to Jaylen Brown never allowed the team to gain any continuity. Celtics lost in the first round to arguably the most talented team ever assembled in the Brooklyn Nets.   Even if you blame Brad partially for this past season that's stil only 1.5 out of 8 seasons in which they didn't live up to the hype. To say his teams ""never"" lived up to the billing is just incorrect. I spent way more time on this than I should have"

They traded the last pick of the first round  to sign kemba walker   Obviously it blew up but let‚Äôs not act like it was a move people were calling stupid
Better than Kemba Walker going 1/9 and smiling like he just found out he got a new Max deal
"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

Who wants to throw something at Kemba Walker? That‚Äôs like trying to start a fight with Jamal Crawford
"In the NBA, you have players and you have *leaders*. Kemba Walker, ladies and gentlemen, is a leader. He is a professional, and by all accounts an *upstanding* teammate. If you're a fan, you don't do that. I'm sorry Mark, you just *don't*."
Broke: *Kemba Walker is undersized and a liability on defense*  Woke: *teams score lots of points on us because they‚Äôre obsessed with us and upset that we are the New York Knicks*
The Kemba Walker - Evan Fournier experience
If he don't like the boos at Philly he ain't gonna like the boos in Boston. That's the sole reason Kemba walker walked
"The appeal for Boston is that Simmons is guaranteed to be a great distributor and defender.  Brown and Tatum just seem a bit duplicative on the court.    If you believe in your player development, you are likely to think you can help Simmons improve as well (every basketball coach/development guy has ideas about how they can make a difference).  The other issue is that if you were to think of who the perfect fit would be for a non-star player to make it all come together... it'd be Kemba Walker- a PG/table-setter.  But that didn't work.  (same with Kyrie).  Simmons + Smart + Stevens' gritty/defense attitude has some synergy.  The trade you're suggesting is extremely difficult to find- Jaylen for Halliburton and extra?  It's a *huge* gamble, and it puts a ton of pressure on Halliburton- because once those pre-star guys hit, they're not available, and before they hit, their peak may turn out much lower than Jaylen.    Simmons at his peak is the same ballpark as Jaylen- the problem is getting him to stay at his peak against bad playoff matchups (which, to be fair, is arguably exact same issue Boston has with Tatum/Brown in the playoffs).  This is a long way of saying that this is a far better deal for both teams than a lot of Boston fans would admit.  I'm not saying Boston *should* take this deal- just that it's very reasonable to do so."
"For me, it‚Äôs Kemba Walker. Everyone loves that guy (including me) but he has been really injury prone and therefore inconsistent in last few years."
kemba walker has been consistently torching the sixers for about 5-6 years it's pretty insane.
"You could also point to all the other interviews he gave during the offseason where he said he was playing B2Bs.  &gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling really good,‚Äù Walker said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been available. I‚Äôve been here. I‚Äôve been here all practices. I‚Äôve been able to play in all the preseason games. They rested me for the one. But as far as back to backs, just trying to take it game by game just depending on how I‚Äôm feeling, but it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not playing back to backs. That‚Äôs not my thought process.‚Äù  Real jokester there.  It was the Celtics medical staff who kept him out of B2Bs and his availability was the #1 question he faced in the offseason.  So we could probably point to the other half dozen interviews in the offseason where he mentioned B2Bs or was asked about them as well.  He's supposed to be playing some of these B2Bs and he's already missing the first one of the season.  He also spoke about playing B2Bs for us last season and then never really did, before breaking down in the playoffs despite the lighter load. He's no doubt a great player but the availability is a huge question. A guy like Kemba doesn't get traded and waived for no reason."
"Dear NYK fans, welcome to the Kemba Walker experience."
"I said elsewhere, I don‚Äôt like seeing us blow leads, but this was less of a meltdown by us and more of the Celtics trying to chip away and come back. We outscored them by 17 in the first half, they outscored us by 14 in the second half  The good news is this looked like our best team win, and Luka and KP‚Äôs best game. Even Jalen who didn‚Äôt have a great game still hit his season averages last year. I really think after a couple summers in a row of flubbing free agency we very well might get bailed out by Brunson turning into some version of Kemba Walker/Kyle Lowry. He‚Äôs averaging 15/5/4 on 28 minutes a game this year. I say start him and have our lineup be Jalen/Luka/Bullock/DFS/KP  With THJ/Maxi/Brown off the bench, but stagger Luka and Jalen so they‚Äôre limited together, Jalen plays well with the 2nd unit. I‚Äôm not an NBA coach, but similar to Manu when he was a top 25 player in the league but not starting, but still playing 30 minutes. I think if we could Just always have Luka or Jalen on the floor at all times we‚Äôre a dangerous team."
"I‚Äôll take one Kemba Walker to go, please"
"Call me crazy, but Lavine is another Kemba Walker type players good at putting up stats on a bad teams."
Your flair is kemba walker.
well he's no kemba walker
"Ben Simmons looks like someone‚Äôs create a player at PG in 2k standing at fucking 6‚Äô11. Like bro, you‚Äôre a foot taller than Kemba Walker, how are you not mentally prepared to be matched up against other guards when you have fucking Embiid on your team?  He‚Äôs either faking this mental shit, which is fucked up considering you got millions of people around the world ready to kill themselves rn or that man real deal needs some help."
"Don't agree with this. Duarte shows flashes as a creator, moves extraordinarily well outside of being a great shooter and so opens up the offense.   He also rebounds well (notice that Pacers have been ass at rebounding for a while...and now we're not. Some of that is scheme, but Duarte has helped.) He reads passing lanes, and is a strong and moderately switchable perimeter defender as well. His defensive assignments so far have included James Harden and Kemba Walker.    He doesn't always make the right pass when handling the ball (see [here](https://twitter.com/C2_Cooper/status/1454550299646078979)), and like any rookie he can fail to execute team defense all the time. But the reason why he gets so many minutes is because he's a tertiary playmaker, scorer, and plus defender."

"**Knicks**  **Immanuel Quickly:** IQ, Jesus‚Äô Son  **Derrick Rose:** D Rose, Windy City D, Pooh, Every Rose has it thorn  **Julius Randle:** Beyblade, Big Julius, Don Julio, Orange (&amp;Blue) Julius, Randle wit da Handle,   **Taj Gibson:** Hard Hat, Lunch Pail, Taj Gibson  **Kemba Walker:** K Walk, MJs Son  **RJ Barrett:** Baby Face Barrett, Hesi-Step-back-pull-up-Maple, StarJ,   **Alec Burks:** Alec Tre-Bruk,   **Obi Toppin:** Obi Wan,   **Evan Fournier:** French Phenom, French Toasty,"
"I did watch him, quite literally every game.   But yeah, Kemba Walker has always been targeted over his defence. That‚Äôs not anything new.   I just don‚Äôt know why the Celtics think they can magically find a playmaking defensive point guard that can space the floor. Especially without moving someone like Brown or Tatum."
"&gt; They had Kemba Walker the last 2 years, and I don‚Äôt overly see how they would improve much on that.   Having someone with functional knees is a good start. Availability is the best ability."
"Who could they trade that gives them the playmaking?   They had Kemba Walker the last 2 years, and I don‚Äôt overly see how they would improve much on that.   Playmaking is a rare skill, and tons of the top guards in today‚Äôs game are score first guards. It isn‚Äôt like you can put Rondo in at the point and expect him to be a better PG than Smart."
Same thing could have been said about Kemba Walker. I know it‚Äôs early but he looks way different with a change of scenery.
"The only players averaging 15+ pts a game with a higher eFG% then melo right now are,  &amp;#x200B;  Seth Curry - 16.4ppg on 54% 3pt and a mind blowing 75% eFG%   Nikola Jokic - 24ppg on 40% 3pt and 66% eFG%  Kemba Walker - 15ppg on 57% 3pt and 67% eFG%"
"Just because Irving and Kemba can score doesn't make them bad playmakers.   Kyrie has always been a high level facilitator and Walker was the best pick and roll ballhandler in the league before he started to lose a step, and he's still great at it.  You're also forgetting Hayward."
After watching Kemba Walker give it his all for YEARS in Charlotte I can only say: what the fuck you have to do some monumentally bad shit to piss him off.    I'm glad he seems to be back to his old self in New York City.
"&gt; Turns out that when you replace guys like Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker  you don't follow the celtics if you think this is a big impact.  Gordon Hayward was in street clothes more often than not and Kemba was too.  The Celtics made the conference finals in 2020 with Hayward missing 75% of their playoff games and Kemba being inconsistent at best, at times completely unplayable."
"I don‚Äôt know how fair it is to say Stevens was harder on Walker than Smart when you consider that Walker basically ignored the team with his injury rehab and Smart is relentless. Kemba has been on the court for the Knicks for two real weeks and his defense and crunch time play is, to be generous‚Ä¶.suboptimal.   They‚Äôre in a spot now where they have two fantastic young players and the rest is ok. They slowly traded a dollar for 90 cents over and over, and now they‚Äôre here."
The Kemba Walker Knicks contract is pretty solid too.
"&gt; Man who boos Kemba Walker  He was straight up trash all of last season. He couldn't score, he couldn't stop anyone, he wouldn't pass."
The only contact was with kemba walker and the floor
Man who boos Kemba Walker what is wrong with you people
Kemba Walker was a loser his entire career. These years especially.
He‚Äôs under paid but he shouldn‚Äôt be making Joe Harris money. Harris is passable defensively. Curry is Trae Young/Kemba Walker bad on defense. He can‚Äôt defend a traffic cone and it becomes a real issue in the playoffs.
"I gotta go with Mike Conley.   He gets spoken about like a top 5 pg alot back then in the grit and grind era. He gets paid like devin Booker Zach lavine level. He got put into the the all star game last season for being being ""snub"" all those years.   Half his accomplishments will be broken by ja morant by 5 seasons.   Then kemba walker. He shoots below average and he's only been able to go to the playoffs I think twice in that decade.  Then mike D toni  as a coach. Other than doc rivers which is obvious for many reasons has been soooo lucky to be put in opportunities to coach stacked teams.   Gifted Melo knicks. Turned out bad. Linsanity was talked the most about.   Gifted the super stack 2012 lakers. Turned out bad and kobe gets injured trying to carry.   Gifted the rockets. Couldn't even beat the warriors that one year and had harden with super star after superstar."
So is he better then Kemba Walker?
"He literally couldn't go up for a shot without locking the defenders arms and as a result of the reach in he wss out of steps and had to shoot.    If that's how defense is allowed to be played, even Kemba Walker is gonna be able to lock dudes up lol"
Reggie Bullock was arguably your best shooter. Kemba Walker is currently shooting over 58% from  3. D Rose us currently shooting over 54% from 3.    I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready to expect the 40%+ 3 point shooting from last season of Julius Randle and Barrett as an expectation. Seemed flukey to me‚Äîespecially Randle

"Downvote me if you must, but I‚Äôd rather gotten Kemba Walker than Russel Westbrook"
"RJ deserves so much credit today. He played against Lavine so wonderful on defense today. Kemba Walker was SPLASHIN 3s in the 3rd. But they can‚Äôt keep doing this to our hearts. With the chopped cheeses, halal food, pizza and bagels, our hearts can‚Äôt take these stressful endings."
"My point is that we aren‚Äôt some place that attracts free agents all the time. Listen to what I‚Äôm saying, this has nothing to do with the wolves or your misfortune, so pause on that.  Celtics are a big market but we‚Äôve only attracted 3 mid-tier stars in the past 5 years. For a team that is tied for most championships, has a championship GM, and retired greats that bleed green, you‚Äôd think more come here but that‚Äôs not really the case. We typically draft and trade for players.  Al Horford went well, wish he stayed but he walked. Gordon Hayward was pretty much a mess from beginning to end and then walked. Kemba Walker got injured his first year with us and has been up and down. Turns out things aren‚Äôt perfect over here and we have a lot of bad luck DESPITE being a competently run team."
"&gt; Who tf wants to go to Boston?  Al Horford, Gordon Hayward, Kemba Walker in the past few years lol.  They were also listed on Kyrie's list when he demanded to be traded, and Hardens.   this is such a stupid narrative"
Lmaoooo! The greatest free agent we‚Äôve ever had is Kemba damn walker! Nobody wants to play in Boston and I think most Celtics don‚Äôt expect anybody to come. Also what scummy past? Pierce shitting his pants? ü§£ yeah that totally stacks up to dwades and Kobe‚Äôs scandals.
"He was OK last year. He averaged 17.8 ppg for the playoffs. An 18 and 10 guy is not ‚Äúamazing‚Äù.   In his 19 playoff games he scored 20+ points 8 times. Kemba Walker who people thought stunk scored 20+ points in 9 of his 17 playoff games by comparison. Yes, I know Bam did it on better efficiency.  His best series was against the Celtics. The other series he didn‚Äôt put up any incredible numbers.   15.0 ppg against Pacers. 17.2 ppg against the Bucks. 15.3 ppg against the Lakers.   People were acting like he was near AD‚Äôs level or some shit. His skillset on offense is so limited in comparison to the true elite bigs in the league. He‚Äôs young. He could definitely improve. But the way people were talking about him last year was not in line with his actual production."
"I mean, it's a foul when Trae and Steph pull on somebodies arms, just like its a foul when Embiid hacks someone like Kemba walker when he drives into the lane.     I don't know why this is the hill to die on.  Chris Paul committed a foul, committed a lane violation, the call was made and reviewed and they played on.  The techs that came on that play didn't even involve Lebron, was Cameron Payne and Caruso going all middle school slapping the ball out of each other's hands.  All the players on both teams just kind of left Lebron there.  No one went after CP3, no retaliation needed.  The Lakers and Suns all knew what was up.  Whistle was blown, let's get on up and get ready for some free throws"
"There's this weird narrative about Trae being basically the worst defender of all time. And don't get me wrong, *he is pretty bad*.   But he's not even bottom 3 on his team. Not a very high bar, but the whole ""Trae is actually a net negative because the defense is historically bad"" is crazy. He's 169th out of 500+ in DRPM. You know who is lower? De'Aaron Fox. And I'm not hating on Fox, I love him and think he is amazing and fun and a true talent to build around. It's the narrative that is weird to me. Other notable players with lower DRPM than Trae: KAT, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Ja Morant. Even players like Alex Caruso have a lower DRPM than Trae.   So then you say ""DRPM is a flawed stat"" to which I reply ""absolutely"", but it is the stat that gets thrown around to shit on Trae all the time.   Trae's defense isn't special bad. It's just regular bad. If he was a guaranteed bucket every single time, it would be punished a lot more. People just really really hate him."
Have the tournament in the same place as the all start game make it a 2 week all-star break.   All 32 teams. Top seed from each conference gets a bye.   Winner gets a newly created 15th lottery pick.    I wanna see some kemba walker shabazz napier type carry jobs in this tourney.
Yes they need someone like kemba walker
But he's on the Kemba Walker level bad in this game
Maybe the Celtics just aren't that good. Kyrie was a bad fit. Hayward wasn't good enough. Horford secured the bag. Isaiah Thomas too short and gets flipped. Kemba Walker too old. Starting to see a pattern lol
"Very true for the Celtics.  **Jayson Tatum** got COVID in January and needed an inhaler during games afterward. He didn't appear fully recovered until late March.  **Robert Williams** only played 52 games, missing time with various injuries, including a knee injury that kept him out for a couple of key weeks down the stretch in April.  **Jaylen Brown** tore a ligament in his wrist in early May, missing the end of the regular season and the *entire playoffs*.  **Kemba Walker** missed the first month of the season with a knee injury.  **Marcus Smart** missed 1.5 months with a calf injury.  Those are arguably the five most important Celtics. Since late March, when Tatum appeared fully recovered from COVID, the Celtics are 7-2 in games all five of them play. Unfortunately, with JB out for the playoffs, we won't see anything close to a full-strength Celtics team in the playoffs."
This was a very winnable game for the Celtics had Tatum been able to break those double teams and if the corpse of Kemba Walker had ressurected.
"RIP Kemba Walker, gone but not forgotten"
Yeah he‚Äôs pretty much always gotten abused by shifty quick guards and bigs who can just over power him but is pretty good in almost every other area. Kemba walker should theoretically be a very bad matchup for him but walker seems to have lost a step
Celtic fan's dilemma in the past 5 years  1. Missing Gordon Hayward in the playoff due to injury  2. Kemba Walker shooting inefficiently  Or  3. Drama Queen Kyrie destroying the chemistry and shooting 7-22.
Kemba Walker makes me want to punch brick walls.
"Hi, I'm first half Kemba Walker and I have cable.  and I'm second half Kemba Walker and I am bad at basketball."
Kemba Walker needs to be traded. All the load management shit they did and he still shat the floor
Kemba Walker is the Mad Catz controller version of Kyrie Irving.
Kemba Walker literally rested every other game so he could score 7 points till there were 2 minutes left in the game

Kemba walker is hilariously bad
Kemba Walker is a horrific contract now

"Idk if it's just me, but Kemba walker seems worthless.   Brooklyn isn't scared of him offensively, and he can't guard anyone.   If he can't get into the lane then what's he going to do?"
Kemba Walker still sucks so much in the playoffs.
hey guys did you know kemba walker was coming into this series playing the best basketball he has been playing this season?
"Kemba Walker is just willing his team to a loss, but it‚Äôs still too close, if the Celtics want to close the door on themselves he‚Äôs gonna need some help."
Jabari Parker looks like a better basketball player than Kemba Walker
The celtics need to bench Williams imo.   He‚Äôs the real deal and I wouldn‚Äôt risk him being injured for a game that kemba walker seems to be insistent on losing
Kemba Walker is so bad man

Never lost to Kemba Walker either
Kemba Walker would smile getting dunked on tbh
"regardless of your stances on politics one thing is for sure, you are not allowed to hate kemba walker"
"See, now that's just gross exaggeration.   I don't think criticizing things like the reaction to the guy on jeopardy or caring if Kemba Walker wore a Gadsen flag when he himself is black is anything like you describe. Those criticisms aren't advancing the cause. The people who make those statements don't get blanket immunity because they're also anti racist. They can go too far."
"Kemba walker games played before boston:  66, 82, 73, 62, 81, 79, 80, 82. Dude was an iron man.  Kyrie games played during that same timeframe:  51, 59, 71, 75, 53, 72, 60, 67  Kyrie has also stated multiple times he wants to retire early.  Kyrie is a small point guard. So you must have been against signing him to a long term contract because of injuries right? Or does that only matter when its the celtics?  Come ON man. you've been around since 2012 and you still have these garbage takes? Be better."
"‚ÄúPremier guards‚Äù   ‚ÄúKemba Walker, Dejounte Murray‚Äù  Bruh"
"True the top guys have not played as well as they can and it is on them to perform. Green and curry are much more limited than what I was thinking, nobody is scared of a Seth curry pick and roll. I just think this team would be insanely hard to stop if you replaced Tobias Harris‚Äôs salary slotwith a guy like Chris Paul, Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, maybe even Kemba walker or Jrue holiday etc..   obviously that‚Äôs true cause most of those guys are all better than Harris but also cause every other high level playoff offense we‚Äôve seen has somebody who is a legitimately good perimeter creator and the sixers have the least perimeter creation of any contender and I think that imbalance is largely cause they gave all that money to Harris. It‚Äôs also bad because every team has to play big against embiid and the sixers do a terrible job of taking advantage of slow bigs by forcing them to play in space because their guards are so limited"
"????? You think the person Danny chose over Rozier was Smart when the way the Rozier signed with the Hornets was thru a sign and trade for Kemba Walker?  I'm on Team Terry, but I'm also on Team Smart and he def was not the ""issue"" (I still love Kemba, just in hindsight would prefer Terry)"
The kemba walker special.
"There are probably two key factors here, trust and aggression. Russell whenever he feels like he cannot trust his teammates to reliably score the ball will take on the scoring burden himself especially in the postseason. This means he takes bad looks such as threes or early shot clock mid-rangers. Westbrook os best when he takes like 10 shots a game.   The other factor is that getting by on aggression is not enough in the postseason. He has to play smarter. The post-up is one of his most efficient shots, he had to get down low and make Kemba Walker hurt."
"Lot of those bullshit foul calls helped them out eh.  At one point I swear it was like 26-11 fouls. That‚Äôs just unprecedented, it never happens.  This refs were such bullshit.  At another point it was 19 fouls to 6 in favor of the Celtics. That just doesn't happen unless it's on purpose. And as soon as the Celtics were clearly going to win it was like the fouls just stopped being called  I guess the Nets vs Celtics storylines/markets were too good to pass up. Kyrie vs his old team and he‚Äôs even said in the past he wants to play Kemba walker in the playoffs one on one."
"How about we talk about the first 3 quarters instead the 4th when the refs tried there best to cover it up.  At one point I swear it was like 26-11 fouls. That‚Äôs just unprecedented, it never happens.  This refs were such bullshit.  I was curious if anyone thought the refs were mad suspicious tonight.  At one point it was 19 fouls to 6 in favor of the Celtics. That just doesn't happen unless it's on purpose. And as soon as the Celtics were clearly going to win it was like the fouls just stopped being called  I guess the Nets vs Celtics storylines/markets were too good to pass up.

Hornets Kemba Walker rolling in his grave
Danny has drafted two All-Stars the last five drafts and got a third in Kemba Walker via trading away Gordon Hurtwood to Charlotte. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than that from drafting and trading.
"I'd really only want/need to protect 6-7 players.  Tatum, Brown, Smart, Time-Lord, Nesmith, Pritchard &amp; Grant Williams + Langford if they Celtics *need* to protect 8 players.  Obviously the Celtics are better with Kemba Walker, but if an expansion team wants to take the last 2 years of his deal off the Celtics cap sheet I'd be okay with it."
"Oh, that's definitely fair. I always saw AI more as a very high-scoring PG, like Kemba Walker times 1 million. I can see where you're coming from."
"Not really. Good players are just concentrated on contenders because of salary limitations individually. You could have 30 stars lead every team if spread out nicely.  1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Curry 4. Luka 5. Lebron 6. Dame 7. Butler 8. Kawhi 9. Randle 10. Zion 11. Embiid 12. CP3 13. Harden 14. Kyrie 15. KD 16. Westbrook 17. Tatum 18. Young 19. AD 20. Beal 21. KAT 22. PG 23. Mitchell 24.

"If we had Brown, sure. Walker is a shell of his former self at this point.  Westbrook and Beal are a much better duo than Tatum and Kemba."
In 2023 you owe Kemba Walker 38 million dollars.
Start John Wall over Kemba Walker without question? I think there‚Äôs at least a debate to be had there. Kemba was an all star last year and even on a load management year after injury/surgery he‚Äôs still putting up 19 PPG and 5 AST on better shooting splits than Wall (Wall averaged 20/7 on higher usage). They seem like pretty comparable players to me from the numbers. Haven‚Äôt watched a lot of Rockets games to see how his defense has been this year.
"He had A/B list talent for the Greece game and lost to a roster without a single NBA player.  Poppovich had C list talent maybe D list.  There was no one on that roster who was top 24 in the NBA.  Highest winshares from the previous season for any player was Kemba Walker at 34th.  The team against Greece had Lebron at 2nd, Wade coming off the Championship, Elton Brand was #6 in winshares, after his best season.  Paul, Bosh, Melo and Howard were all much improved from the team that was in the Olympics 2 years prior.  That loss was 100% on Krynieosaiwm."
I would trade terry rozier for fucking kemba walker man
"We haven't really had any games together this year.   Walker, Brown, Tatum and Smart played fewer minutes together this season than they did in just the playoffs last season.   A lot of those guys they did get to play, 1-2 guys were always coming off a major injury/illness. I think we had ~20 games with those 4 playing but more than half of those games came during a stretch where:  * Kemba was on minute restrictions coming back from his offseason knee procedure * Tatum was coming back from covid * Smart was coming back from the nasty calf strain * Brown was starting to miss time with tendonitis  We also never had a single game with our top 8 healthy, the best we got was 5 games with 7 of our top 8 (we went 5-1)."
Would you like one Kemba Walker?
"I cant believe how bad Porzingis is.      A better question....was he ever really that good?       He just stands around out there and does nothing.   As a Boston fan, no way in hell would I trade Kemba Walker for this guy. He added nothing out there."
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It‚Äôs not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
Lmao kemba walker? De'aron fox?
"how about Kemba Walker, Tristan Thompson and two 2nds for Pat Bev, Kennard, Rondo &amp; Zubac?  It's an exchange of bad deals and the Clips get to recoup some draft capital.  Kemba fits their timeline contract wise and for as much as he gets shit on by everyone on r/nba is a clear upgrade at point guard for them."
Kemba walker for sure
"As a Celtics fan I would approve of this, particularly if it could also lead to a trade that sends Kemba Walker elsewhere.  Brogdon running the show with the Jays would be choice."
"Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, 4 first round picks"
Best way to help him would be to trade him to Boston for Kemba Walker

Kemba Walker? Lmao
"Brad Stevens should drive Kemba to the city that hosts the franchise that is willing to trade for Walker. But, one, getting anything of value - aka doing something other than swapping bad contracts - is going to be tough. Two, having a different roster every year is what leads to mediocrity."
"I don't think Wall was much much worse than Walker this year. He was just surrounded by worse players and tried to do too much on offense. Plus he was returning after a long layoff so he was probably really rusty. As to the health, I wonder how much he was just held back by Houston since they weren't really trying to win. He costs more than Kemba but I believe the both have 2 years left on their contract. When locked in, Wall can be a better distributor and better defender with better size than Kemba.   Not saying either is a very attractive option. But between the two, I feel like Wall would fit better than Kemba imho."
"Yeah...but at the end, you still have Kemba Walker.  No thanks."
Report: NBA teams to seek avoiding a Kemba Walker trade
Gordon Hayward for Kemba Walker.  Who says no?
You're getting nothing for kemba Walker
Bradley Beal is going to get traded to the Celtics for Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown. Mark my words.
Kemba Walker with pieces either way
Would you want a lil Kemba Walker? Hehe
Kemba Walker isn‚Äôt a bad choice either if they can get off Luke.   Better one than Russ &amp; Wall imo.  I like RWB more as a player but Kemba seems like the better fit.
A Kemba walker perhaps?
KP for Kemba Walker and a pick. Both fan bases riot
Man I wish I was Kemba Walker or Luke Kennard or Porzingis. Money for nothing and chicks for free
Hard agree. Basically the Kemba Walker signing of front office makeovers
"Alternatively, they could just not dump Kemba and let Fournier go.  Kemba is a better play than Fournier.  And keeping either will put the Celtics above the cap but under the luxury tax, so that would have no implications on signing other free agents.  Paying 2 firsts so you can sign Fournier and lose Kemba is a very obvious shit move.   They could also pay the tax to sign Fournier to 20m.  Or they could dump Grant Williams and Carsen Edwards.  They can renounce Ojeleye, Fall, Waters and Kornet, and depending on the finalized cap, trade away their current firsts for future firsts or make another move to trade Nesmith or Langford for future picks to clear space.  They'd then have 12-15m to work with to sign Fournier below the luxury tax.  It's below what he's asking for, but there are moves to be made where Walker, Smart and Fournier are all retained and the team is under the tax.  Brown, Tatum, Thompson, Williams, one of Langford and Nesmith and Pritchard would round out the team.  The other 6 roster spots would need to be minimum guys though, and that 9 man rotation honestly probably isn't competitive enough to be a real contender barring Tatum and Brown taking another huge leap.  But it would buy them another year while Brown and Tatum develop, while still avoiding the tax.  Idk, I'm not a gm, but I'm just saying there are options available where the Celtics aren't just giving away picks to make themselves worse.  If they can't figure out the cap, I'd expect them to let Fournier go instead of dumping Kemba with picks.  As I said, they'd just be paying 2 picks to keep the worse player without it having salary or tax implications."
Kemba Walker
Honestly think team chemistry was the best with Avery Bradley and Isaiah Thomas squad. Then Irving's weird personality ruined their season and now Kemba Walker is no longer his old self after injury. Team is kinda heading in a wrong direction despite having two young stars Tatum and Brown. Smart and Timelord are also pretty good role players.
"He's 35 and doesn't fit the roster at all. He is a negative asset just like Kemba Walker. He's fine as a buyout candidate and could fill a 12-18mpg role in certain playoff matchups, but at 30million a season he is a terrible player to acquire."
"Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?  Was it comparing each of their best draft picks over the last two years (Williams and Langford vs Thybulle)? Or most recent veteran trade acquisitions (Danny Green vs. Evan Fournier)?  Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead, they have been the former and have not done good enough given the stars they have drafted, the draft capital that they had and their status as a premier organization in the league.  Not sure which random players you are referencing too.  Was it me comparing the two best players on the respective teams (Embiid vs Tatum)?

Not very random.  Roster building does not happen over one season. Some teams need years to build rosters, other teams need a couple seasons.  Boston should be the latter, instead they have been the former.  You are correct, my KG and Ray Allen were incorrect.  I did not remember that they were traded for.  Did Kemba Walker, Al Horford or Gordon Hayward lead to a championship?  Does Gordon Hayward leaving for absolutely nothing lead to a championship (no one would have given them a 2nd round pick and a bag of basketballs for Gordon Hayward?).  They were smart to let go of Horford when they did.  And if Kemba was that guy maybe they don't get their butts handed to them as bad as they did.    I think Tatum and Brown are great and I have high expectations for Tatum, but there is nothing anyone has seen that leads anyone to believe that they have the organization that would build around. But the good thing is that now they have turned the team over to Brad.  Good thing Brad Stevens has a reputation for being able to work well with superstars like Kyri...oh wait."
"Very puzzling. 2-3 years ago people would have said both of these people are top 3 at their job, and it would have been reasonable to say they are both the best gm and coach.   I get that the owners think Brad might do a better job than Ainge who clearly dropped the ball considering an entire playoff team worth of players left them while he brought in 1 Kemba Walker aaaand drafted meh since Tatum. But getting a coach on Brads level seems highly unlikely, ESPECIALLY if they are searching for one and they dont have one of the assistants lining up who showed great promise. Are they just gona sign Dantoni or some shit, gamble on another unknown? seems hella weird."
Fuck...no. Kemba walker is not it for a playoff team.
"Absolutely not.   At no time, during his stretch, was the Boston roster the best team in the East.   He made the playoffs in 2015 when no one thought they would. They made the 5th seed the next year when the East was good. Atlanta had a better roster and beat them in 6. He made the ECF the next year, and without their leading scorer, took a game from the Cavs. They make the ECF again without Kyrie and Hayward.  The 2019 season, they weren‚Äôt better than Milwaukee even if Kyrie played like a star, so ECSF or ECF was their limit. From 2017-2019, at no time, even thought Stevens has done well against the Warriors big 4, does Boston beat them in the series. Maybe 2019, but that would require Kyrie to play like a star and not quit on the Celts.  2020, they underachieved against Miami in the ECF, but that was also a limit for me. I expected them to lose in the ECSF to a healthy Philly team or lose in the ECF to Milwaukee. And he outcoached a good HC in Nick Nurse in a great 7-game series.  And this year, team struggled with COVID. The lack of depth showed. A super overrated coach does not beat Brooklyn, playing their 3 stars, with this roster, period. That is also without their 2nd best player in Jaylen Brown, and with Kemba Walker bricking everything until the end."
I just gotta hope and pray our FO isn‚Äôt dumb enough to trade the franchise player for Kemba Walker and some late first round picks

"[According to Stevens, Walker received an injection of Synvisc, a drug that has been marketed as a pain reliever for osteoarthritis, a degeneration of cartilage that can occur in the knee, hip and thumb joints.](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/726909/celtics-guard-kemba-walker-gets-knee-drained-has-injection/story/)"
"I know more about the salary cap than you. We had cap space to sign Kemba, we didn't get anything meaningful for Rozier. Trading him in the 2018 offseason or in season is getting something for him.   Morris is a quality player starting for a contender right now. We knew before the season we were probably going to have to trade him before the deadline to get under the tax. They got nothing.  Signing Kemba Walker under the cap after being over the tax the previous season is a DISASTER. You are nothing more than a common green teamer making common excuses for this pathetic rebuild."
That‚Äôs not what that means. You‚Äôre creating a fake meaning to excuse him for saying harden can‚Äôt pass and choosing kemba Walker for no reason lmao
"Ainge has signed and traded for more All-Stars than almost any GM in the past 20 years lol.  KG, Allen, trading back for A. Walker, Horford, Irving, Thomas, Hayward, and Kemba... The narrative that he doesn't make these trades or that he's 'scared,' to do so when his nickname used to be 'Trader Danny,' is hilarious.  If those Grizzlies/Kings picks had been landed further than where they were projected to land initially, he'd probably have gambled for more stars honestly."
"We *could've*, but would we have? You can get a bigger name, but it's really damn hard to get big names when your assets are a TPE, the shell of Kemba Walker, and Marcus Smart. Fournier's a decent player that we can go over the cap to re-sign, which is helpful when we have next to no cap space to begin with."
"I promise you he doesnt give a fuck about the rockets twitter or milwaukee ads lmao  and he was right, he lost mvp to russ, steph, giannis, all with different narratives changing to benefit them. it wasnt an actual insult at giannis, saying a former APG leader doesnt pass and choosing kemba fucking walker over him is though"
that title belongs to kemba walker
"While i wish Kemba all the best as our franchises all time leading scorer, I must say after reading everyone say the HAyward and Rozier signings were the worst things imaginable, and not signing Walker to a 200 mill extension was the dumbest thing ever, i am enjoying myself."
"I get that the celtics weren't great, but they have an all-nba star player in Tatum, an all-defensive player in Marcus Smart, a 17 ppg+ player in Fournier, a serviceable center in Thompson and despite his injuries, an actual NBA player in Kemba Walker.  How is that a g-league roster."
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
"Oh the Celtics need more help now, maybe they should sign Kemba Walker"
If only they had kemba walker...
"A couple of years ago they had Irving Hayward Brown Tatum Horford Rozier Smart Morris Theis Williams all on the roster. As Tatum moves into his prime you would think they would try to improve the roster each season but its been going the other way, and now they really only have Brown Smart Williams an injured Kemba Walker making $30 million a year.  I think the Celtics honestly just got a bit unlucky. Haywards injury, Kyrie heel turning on the city, Philly losing their minds and offering Horford that contract, Kemba getting hurt, Turner being snatched out from under them, etc."
"&gt; It a pretty simple goal for theses guys. Win a title.  GMs can't control the outcome, only the process. Ainge has been amazing. He constructed a roster with Tatum, Brown, Irving, Smart, Hayward, and Horford. Sometimes things just don't work out.  &gt; He could have swung with kawhi or jimmy or pg.   Any of these trades would have to include Brown and therefore it'd be a mistake to make it. Kawhi and Butler would probably have left for LA and Miami anyway.  &gt; Then on top all that literally for 20 years his best free agent signings were horford Hayward and kemba  For the first few years of his tenure Boston was rebuilding and accumulating assets. Then he made the Big 3 happen. Then another short rebuild. Only at this point Boston was in a position to court free agents and Ainge got Hayward, Horford, and Walker. He did very well."
"At least he had 08 championship to fall back on, but he had a roster to go to finals with Brad Stevens as the coach. It was combination of injuries, personalities, and free agency which hinder those roster to reach the finals.  They have Brown and Tatum, but rarely anything else unless Celtic fans believe Robert Williams, Payton Pritchard, Aaron Nesmith, Romeo Langford, and Grant Williams will get better. Is Kemba Walker knee going to hold up to his shifty moves he will put stress on his knees?"
"I think 'healthy' is a relative term here. Kemba Walker having busted knees is sort of baked into the equation. Jaylen Brown getting hurt is more of a freak thing though, and Tatum+Brown makes them I think comfortably the 4th best team in the East. You wouldn't expect them to beat the Sixers, Bucks, or Nets but they also wouldn't be so badly overmatched that it wouldn't be a series.  Is that a terrible place to be? Not really. I think if you're the Celtics though it's not just that you're now probably a tier below the top contenders, it's the way it's happened - a couple of years ago this was clearly the best non-Lebron franchise in the East. The lack of progress, and watching multiple teams - including the one that should have been buried by the trade that got you Tatum and Brown - pass you by is probably what is most grating. There's a lack of progress here compared to what I think people expected this team to look like at this point."
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
"THANK YOU.  I mean look all of your comments come with the benefit of hindsight but at the end of the day he sat on his hands with his warchest of assets and don't have anything to show for it.   Also not to shit on Kemba but once has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line because the Jays and Marcus Smart are more or less untouchable.  But if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core.  Brandon Clarke, Matisse Thybulle, Desmond Bane - all players that Ainge either missed out on or literally traded away. Payton Pritchard was a solid pick, but Ainge should've doubled down on getting that type of player."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
"Which is not a good thing. Zarren is a smart dude but he's also Ainge's protege, which means Boston is going downhill, fast.  The entire house needs to be cleaned. Ainge, Zarren, Brad Stevens, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Kemba Walker, the training staff, every single one of them needs to go. Rebuild around Tatum and Robert Williams because they are the only people deserving to represent the Celtics uniform."
"[In case no one knows Kemba's nickname is ""Cardiac Kemba""](https://www.atthehive.com/2016/1/27/10836002/kemba-walker-has-truly-earned-the-nickname-cardiac-kemba)"
"I mean he basically traded Markell fultz for jayson Tatum and Romeo Langford.   Picked robin Williams with a late first round pick  Picked Payton Pritchard with a late first round pick   Assembled great teams of multiple all stars that have been ravaged by injuries.   Made big free agent signings of kemba walker, al Hortford , Gordon Hayward.   Traded for Kyrie with a hurt IT4 and a pick that ended up being Colin sexton.   Not all of these worked out but they were definitely the right move at the time"
"Also missing: Kemba Walker, Robert Williams, our competitive spirit, our desire to have Lucky‚Äôs back."
Trade kemba walker ass
"You can't be as psyched as having Jabari Parker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
Hey Blazers fans I‚Äôll trade you kemba walker for Dame straight up
"Sure! Keep Brown and Tatum, but resigning Fournier (who we used a massive TPE on) costs a lot in the tax. We‚Äôll be in the tax next year, so starting Fournier at ~$10 million (Marks calls this conservative) gives a $19 million penalty. *If* the $5.9 million tax payer exemption is used, the tax would be $35 million. Now, we can avoid a harsh payment by dumping Tristan Thompson‚Äôs expiring contract (it‚Äôs $9.7 million), but it doesn‚Äôt say how to do this. Marcus Smart also has an expiring contract, but his theoretical extension would make him severely underpaid, so I, u/5WinsIn5Days, don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be extended, because the extension would be 4 years and $74.4 million, which Smart wouldn‚Äôt accept. He‚Äôs our longest-tenured player and one of Danny‚Äôs favorites, so I don‚Äôt see him leaving until the 2022 offseason. Surprisingly, the guys we picked in the 20s (Pritchard, the Williamses) look better than the guys we picked at 14 (Langford, Nesmith). It has a whole subsection of fluff on Kemba Walker that doesn‚Äôt say how to dump the contract, or if we should do it. We have second round picks in 2021, 2022, and 2026, and all of our future firsts."
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."

Rid of Kemba Walker
"Would you consider Kemba Walker a PF or Center then? Because for prolonged periods or even entire games (like when Kemba was on Hachimura in the play-in), he was on those guys on defense."
Worst than Kemba Walker. Lmfao

I‚Äôve had both as well and they are minor ‚Äî was back on the mat in under 3 months for both of mine, the removal was under a month. His had some sprains but definitely nothing serious.

"Can‚Äôt post the charts put here‚Äôs the text if you don‚Äôt wanna click:  Damian Lillard had reason to believe that Portland‚Äôs fans would make a difference in his first-round series against the Nuggets.   The Trail Blazers were the last NBA team to start allowing fans into their home arena this season‚Äîmuch to Lillard‚Äôs chagrin. But once they did, the Trail Blazers went 4-0 in home games with fans, including crucial wins over the Lakers and Nuggets that helped Portland avoid the play-in tournament.    The Ringer‚Äôs NBA Odds Machine  So good, it should come with a spoiler alert  Moreover, Portland has seemingly benefited from an extreme home-court advantage in recent playoff history. From 2013-14, Lillard‚Äôs first postseason, through 2018-19, the last postseason before the home-court-free bubble, the Trail Blazers were a miserable 6-21 on the road in playoff games‚Äîbut against those same teams at home, they were a much better 13-11. That gap represented one of the largest home-court advantages in the league.   So in advance of Game 3 in the Blazers‚Äô first-round series, with the Moda Center allowing four times the capacity that it did during the regular season, Lillard conveyed confidence in his home crowd. ‚ÄúWe know that our crowd is loud, our crowd has pride, they really care, and they gonna come ready,‚Äù Lillard said. ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs going to play in our favor.‚Äù  And then the Trail Blazers lost Game 3 in front of those loud, prideful, caring fans, before winning Game 4 to salvage a split at home‚Äîjust as they‚Äôd split the two games in Denver to open the series. It turns out neither team‚Äôs home-court advantage mattered at all.  But it‚Äôs not just Lillard, and it‚Äôs not just Portland vs. Denver. Across the league, home-court advantage has disappeared in this postseason‚Äîeven as fans flock to arenas in their greatest numbers since the start of the pandemic, and even as players, coaches, and owners express excitement to play in front of the cheering masses once again.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be pretty special for our fans, just to have our fans in the building and make us proud,‚Äù LeBron James said before the first Lakers‚Äô home playoff games in eight years, and his first in Los Angeles. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I came here for, is to play a playoff game in front of the Lakers faithful.‚Äù  Except like Lillard‚Äôs Trail Blazers, LeBron‚Äôs Lakers split their two home games‚Äîjust as they‚Äôd split their two road games in Phoenix. Home-court advantage didn‚Äôt matter one bit.  Through 32 playoff games thus far, two home and two road for each club, home teams are 16-16. In the 16-team playoff era, home teams‚Äô winning percentage has never been close to this low‚Äîexcept last year, in the bubble, when ‚Äúhome-court advantage‚Äù by definition didn‚Äôt exist.    The same is true for point differential, rather than pure win-loss record. Historically, home teams have won their playoff games by an average of four to five points per game‚Äîbut this postseason, that average is down to 0.9 through 32 games, in line with the bubble playoffs (1.0) for the lowest by far.    Typically, the NBA‚Äôs home-court advantage is one of the strongest across the major North American sports, and it tends to increase in the postseason. From the expansion of the postseason bracket to 16 teams in 1983-84 through the 2018-19 season, home teams won 61 percent of their games in the regular season and 65 percent of their games in the playoffs. (That pattern holds even accounting for the fact that better teams play more home games in the playoffs. FiveThirtyEight‚Äôs Neil Paine calculated the same playoff boost of 4 percentage points even with this adjustment.)   But this postseason has been different. Since the introduction of the shot clock, 88 best-of-seven series before this season had started with the home teams winning four games in a row. For comparison, only six had started with the road teams winning four games in a row, meaning a home sweep of games 1 through 4 was 15 times more likely than a road sweep. Yet this year, no series started with four home wins in a row, while Clippers-Mavericks saw four consecutive road wins.  That‚Äôs just one data point, but it sure fits the larger pattern.  Best-of-Seven Series to Start With Four Road Wins  2021 First Clippers Mavericks ???  2017 First Celtics Bulls Celtics 4-2  2005 First Mavericks Rockets Mavericks 4-3  1995 Conference Finals Spurs Rockets Rockets 4-2  1994 Second Rockets Suns Rockets 4-3  1969 First Lakers Warriors Lakers 4-2  1963 Conference Finals* Celtics Royals Celtics 4-3  *Unlike the other series in this chart, which used the standard 2-2 format for the first four games, the Celtics and Royals alternated home courts for every game of their 1963 series. The sudden diminishment of home-court advantage could wreak unexpected effects on this postseason. Game 7s might not favor the home team as much as usual, for instance, and the presumed powerhouse clash between the Nets and Bucks in the second round might not hinge on the Nets‚Äô home-court advantage. The Lakers could win the title without hosting Game 1 in any round.   It‚Äôs still early in the playoffs, so the advantage could still tilt back toward the home teams in a Game 7, or in later rounds. And all this analysis comes with the caveat that injuries to stars have seemingly affected teams more at home thus far: Donovan Mitchell missed a home game for Utah; Anthony Davis missed half a home game for the Lakers; Kemba Walker and Robert Williams missed the same home game for Boston. (Injuries do go both ways, though: The 76ers‚Äô Joel Embiid missed most of Game 4, helping Washington to a home win.)  Yet this phenomenon fits with a recent trend in the regular season, too. From 1984 through 2013, home teams‚Äô winning percentage in the regular season never dipped below 60 percent leaguewide for more than one season in a row. But it‚Äôs been below 60 for eight regular seasons in a row now‚Äîreaching an all-time low, of course, this season, when most games had no crowds at all.    ESPN‚Äôs Kevin Pelton found that home-court advantage was stronger in games with fans this regular season, but in the postseason, teams with more fans aren‚Äôt benefiting from the extra crowd size. In fact, the correlation between attendance and home point differential is negative-0.22 so far, meaning more fans are associated with a worse performance from the home team.   Don‚Äôt read into that figure too far. The quality of the teams allowing larger crowds somewhat scrambles this analysis‚Äîfor instance, Miami could bring in 17,000 fans per home game, while Milwaukee was allotted just 9,100 in its first-round sweep. But as this graph shows, there‚Äôs also no evidence that larger crowds have helped the home team this postseason.    Crowds have helped the overall product, as players clearly enjoy competing in front of fans and the television viewing experience improves immensely with thousands of chanting, cheering mouths working in unison. (They‚Äôve also exposed a considerably uglier side, throwing popcorn and water bottles, and hurling spit and offensive invectives toward players and their families.)  But improving the general NBA experience is distinct from improving a specific team‚Äôs chances. Consider the Clippers and Mavericks once more: After much discourse around Mark Cuban‚Äôs desire to pack Dallas‚Äôs home arena, the Mavericks found enough legislative leeway to get to more than 17,700 fans for both home games‚Äîthe highest attendance for any team in the postseason. Dallas proceeded to lose both home games anyway.  As Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said before those losses, ‚ÄúJust because you‚Äôre home doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre going to walk out there and win a game. You‚Äôve still got to keep doing the things that you‚Äôve been doing well in previous games   I didn‚Äôt particularly care for this article that I read"
"&gt;we are going after Walker? These discussions happen well in advance.  Ummm... their entire conversation in that article was about how the conversations didn't happen in advance.   * When Horford was negotiating with Boston, we didn't have cap space.  * When Horford pulled out of the negotiation because he was negotiating with Philadelphia, we suddenly gained cap space.  * We used that cap space to pursue Kemba Walker.    * We then went back to Horford and said we can work some cap magic to have both of you. It was already too late as Horford had made an agreement with Philadelphia.  * Horford then came out and said later, if he knew we were getting Kemba sooner, he would have re-signed with us.    Horford also said but he wouldn't have re-signed with us if he knew we were keeping Kyrie.   Your argument relies on you not understanding the timing or cap situation at the time."
"I'm just saying, he's on the record saying his decision would have been different if he knew earlier.   &gt;And what about if he‚Äôd known Kemba Walker was coming. Horford paused.  &gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get caught up in the past,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut, yeah, that would have been totally different.‚Äù"
"&gt;Kyrie signed with the Nets the first second he was able too. Horford had plenty of time to make his decision and did not return.  Actually no...   Horford declined his player option with the expectation from the team that he was going to extend on a longer-term deal for less money. Then he got poached by Philly before the FA period even began.  From Windhorst:  &gt;The Celtics were, from what I am told, one of the teams that kind of stomped their feet about what they felt was tampering. Not with Kyrie, although that looked like it was lined up pretty far in advance. But with Horford. What happened with Horford ‚Äì again, from what I am told ‚Äì really upset the Celtics, that they were thinking they were going to be able to negotiate with him, talk to him about a new contract, and all of a sudden, it was like he already knew what his market was and was out of there.  So no, there wasn't plenty of time.   After this we scrambled to attract Kemba and then went to try and re-negotiate with Horford but it was already too late by that point.  Here's what Horford said specifically:  &gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that has anything to do with it for me,‚Äù Horford said. ‚ÄúI just think that if Kyrie would have stayed, I don‚Äôt know if it would have worked. There would have had to be some major changes as far as players, because it was just clear that the group that we had just wasn‚Äôt going to be able to coexist.‚Äù  &gt; And what about if he‚Äôd known Kemba Walker was coming. Horford paused.  &gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get caught up in the past,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut, yeah, that would have been totally different.‚Äù   As I said:  ""Hoford specifically said he wouldn't have returned if Kyrie did, but also said that if he knew we were bringing in Kemba earlier he would have come back to play for Boston."""
"If I'm a knicks fan the last thing in the world I want to hear is rumors like that.   All it takes is a little too much success going to Dolan's head and next thing you know you're trading for Kemba Walker and Kevin Love. Let the young guys grow, build a winning culture, try and take the next step in free agency. There's a literal blueprint right across the river."
"Kemba Walker was a big free agent at the time of his signing just two years ago, not sure why you omitted him lol. It‚Äôs obviously somewhat of a factor to certain people but every team has fans who suck. Also Horford is still black lmao."
Well no shit y'all have the Avengers and we have Jayson Tatum and the corpse of Kemba Walker (sometimes)
"They said be careful what you wish for, then they ended up with kemba walker lmao"
Kemba Needsa Walker
This is like asking whose better between Tatum and Kemba Walker or Luka and Porzingis.
Known playoff performer kemba walker? Lmao
"He's about to get a playoff series win in his 3rd season! I guess I always felt it would be more likely he'd have a *good, but never really leading his team to the playoffs* career arc like Kemba Walker, Demarcus Cousins, Devin Booker before this year lol. Maybe I made that underestimation also because of his size."
Westbrook for Kemba Walker
Kemba walker is barely a starter and no were near his Hornet days. Tristan Thompson is a role player and no were near his 2016 cavs days. Fournier who? And Marcus smart is the heart and soul of the team but he‚Äôs still a role player. Tatum is the only star. Sorry
Kemba Walker with his smile
Kemba Walker
"Lmao celtics started Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford that game. Their second highest scorer was Rookie Payton Pritchard. They were missing Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, AND Robert Williams as well"
"kemba ""erik bledsoe"" walker"
"And I disagree with all of them. The only one who might get in is Kyrie and that‚Äôs moreso due to his immense fame than his actual basketball ability (to explain: I think Kyrie is great, but he‚Äôs closer to trae than he is to, for example, Curry).   Those people aren‚Äôt following the post, they‚Äôre just campaigning for their favorite player. If anyone actually thinks kristaps porzingis or kemba walker are ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù please never take them seriously. It would be best for you to block them because they clearly have no idea wtf they‚Äôre talking about"
"Go look at some of the other names in this post. People here are listing Kyrie, Trae Young, Kemba Walker, Kristaps Porzingis, &amp; Russell Westbrook. None of them are getting as much push back as Paul George even though he is at least on the same level as they are."
"In no particular order, Kevin Love, John Wall, Russell Westbrook (debatable), Kemba Walker (unfortunately), Klay Thompson (mostly injuries though), Otto Porter Jr. (his contract is almost up),  and KP.  Also, Wiggins until recently, Steven Adams (sadly), and I'm skeptical D'Lo returns decent value.   I know we give Bertans shit for his contract, but it's not like he's forgotten how to shoot. The Wiz just have insufficient spacing outside of him and Beal. They're just asking him to make 3-4 3's a game on high efficiency. He'd play better if they had even one or two more quality shooters in the rotation."
It's disgusting to see especially when guys like 6'0 Kemba Walker can pull down 8 clutch rebounds while having a pretty bad shooting night. He still found a way to contribute and getting a rebound for him is theoretically a lot fucking harder than for a 7'3 guy.
"How you gonna let Kemba Walker get 8 rebounds on you though. Giannis will average 20, Embiid and Simmons might get that each if they get that far."
"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Kemba Walker. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kemba. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
Too bad Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker combined for 56 tonight to outlast them.
Some idiot franchise gave Kemba Walker even more than that so I won‚Äôt be surprised if Lowry gets his 2nd bag.
"Even worse tho, if they had the 8th pick they could have gotten either Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, or Kawhi Leonard."
"Ainge has a weird boner for score-first PGs I guess.  One has to wonder if they took that max money and signed some cheaper, more complimentary pieces. Ricky Rubio went for 17M/year for example. You could've gotten him, a good sixth man and another complimentary guy for the price you paid Kemba. That would've also let to having more trade-able assets down the line.  AND, if you were going to sign Kemba Walker and put yourself into a position where you can't effectively salary match for mid-tier contracts (which doesn't go well with the fact that they had a warchest of draft picks and untouchable players) then the least you could've done over the past few years is draft older, more complimentary guys that were ready to contribute immediately next to your core."
I think the real question is how many picks do OKC have to attach to Kemba Walker to grab Ben.
Kemba Walker and Mike Conley! What is the consensus thought on Harden?
"Reminds me of France-USA at the FIBA world cup 2019.  Donovan Mitchell was on fire, but Kemba Walker didn‚Äôt pass the ball to him, because he wanted to be the man on that team himself.  France won and eliminated the USA"
"&gt;These other countries have been training together for years  These other countries have been training together for 2 weeks before any major events. The US can do the same, no one's stopping them from calling up Kemba Walker and Myles Turner to carry on from that 2019 roster, if chemistry is all they lack."
Doubt it. He'd probably get $5-8m. He still shot 42% from the field and 34% from 3. It's not like he completely fell off the map. He just mailed it in this year.  Get him on a lower tier contract and he'll probably actually start trying again.  He's on basically an expiring deal worth $18m this year (and $4m guarantee next year).  Kemba Walker is at $36m this year and $37m next year and you want to act like that's not worse than Bledsoe? Kemba is hardly better than Bledsoe at this point. One mailed it in. The other's knees are shot.
"Because the 2019 roster was even worse? Their best player was Kemba Walker and they were rolling out guys like Mason Plumlee, Brook Lopez, Kyle Kuzma, and Derrick White."
People that want westbrook need to realize they need to trade more than dennis to get russ to match salaries. I'm not a fan of gutting half the roster for a borderline all star whose game will age horribly. He's a couple of years away from looking like kemba walker without a jump shot.
"&gt;Its such a weak free agency   Not when it comes to point guards it's not, especially ones who are at least on Schroder's level. There's only a few teams that have $20 million in cap space to make him a lucrative offer, and Schroder will be competing for that money with Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, and Patty Mills. Hell, if some team with a lot of space wanted to they could very easily trade for Kemba Walker and get a better PG than Schroder. If Schroder was hands down the best PG available, then sure, one team might throw a ton of money at him just as BPA, but that's clearly not the case this year."
"That's true, but considering all the other point guards who will be free agents this summer, I find it highly unlikely some team thinks Dennis Schroder is the best of them. Kyle Lowry, Reggie Jackson, Cameron Payne, Lonzo Ball, Patty Mills, and even Kemba Walker (who could be easily had if you have the cap space to absorb his contract in a trade) are all probably more desirable options or worth more money than Dennis Schroder is. I think the odds someone makes Schroder a $100 million offer this summer is practically nil."
"Aside from the cliche ones, Jr smith, Jamal Crawford, and Kemba Walker all have great highlights"
"Giannis is a super likable dude. Granted, anyone this side of Sarah Huckabee Sanders would be likable compared to Chris Paul, but Giannis is likable by any standards.  This stuff about Milwaukee being a fucking miracle though is getting a bit nauseating. Now that he's won a title as the best player on the team, he's in the conversation for best player in the league. With, really, only LeBron (questions about him being officially past his prime or not,) KD (questions about health) and Curry (age) being in the conversation.   Throw in smart trades/free agent signings and Milwaukee isn't a small-market miracle, but rather just a damn smart franchise who lucked into drafting the best player in his draft in the mid-first round.   I just hope Giannis stops the ""I coulda formed a superteam"" bullshit. One, there was no place he could have realistically gone and had a better roster around him. Two,  where the fuck are these mystical superteams? I'll give you KD to the Warriors, but LeBron and Kevin Love? KD and Kyrie? Kemba Walker joining the Celtics? Even LeBron with the Lakers. That's a superteam?!? LA has won a playoff series in one of LeBron's three years there. AD never won shit."
"Don‚Äôt you understand??? We NEED to get rid of Simmons, we can‚Äôt just not trade him because the offers are dogshit we need to trade him for kemba walker you don‚Äôt understand."
Kemba Walker for Terry Rozier?  Victor Oladipo for Caris LeVert?  Kyle Korver for Copy Machine?  PG13 for SGA?
You‚Äôre literally a Kemba Walker fan. Dont waste my time
"&gt;11 - Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Bump Kemba Walker for Nikola Vucevic for your starting 5.  Not saying Kemba is not as good as Vuc, but I am saying Kyrie, Klay, and Jimmy are better than Kemba and this lineup needs a big man, Vuc is a 2x all star."
"Sounds a lot like Kemba walker, 4 time all star. And Kemba has averaged more than 6 assists per game once. CJ as a 2 averaged almost 5. He‚Äôd be just fine    Trust me you‚Äôd get a lot further with CJ than Lonzo"
"NBA should have their very best making insane $$$ relative to their teammates, but they need to do it smarter. they should have ONE slot per team where the team owner can throw the bank at getting a supreme player with a Godfather offer (maybe you set an upper salary limit for this player at like $100-150 million a year), but not have that number count against the regular cap. then the rest of the team is capped as usual, so basically the 2nd best guy can still command a $30-40 mill salary if his production matches expectation and all of the luxury tax/repeater tax/etc. gets applied to the combined salaries of players 2-15, not that alpha player. that way, a small market team can at least bid for Giannis or Lebron if their owner is deep-pocketed and willing to spend, and failing that, not get hamstrung by overpaying to re-sign say Kemba Walker or Tobias Harris (i.e. really good but not great players) to a huge number that almost immediately wrecks the team's flexibility going forward when those guys are getting paid in the neighborhood of Lebron, KD or Steph but clearly not at the same level  i think if you then tie on certain conditions, like once those upper tier guys sign a deal they HAVE TO honor the full years on the deal and not try to bail out for greener pastures prematurely (like AD/Harden), i think there'd be more parity. there'd be less concentrating of the very best players, and there'd be more money for the mid-tier/bench players since the salary cap hit from the main guy is no longer there (e.g. if say the salary cap for Golden State is $120 million and Steph is owed $40 mill, that's $80 mill spread around 14 other guys before luxury tax comes in; but if Steph's $$$ isn't counted, then that's $120 mill to be shared around 14 guys, providing the salary cap stays the same)"
Celtics goofed it by trading Kemba walker and a 1st  this off-season instead of trading him at the deadline next offseason. Feel like Kemba would rehab a full offseason increasing his value progressively therefore getting more value than Al and Moses brown
Frank the Tank in a tied Game 6 of the NBA Finals.  Kemba Walker beside himself.
1. Kemba  2. K Walk  3. Cardiac Kemba  4. Mr. Walker  5. KW15
"Wayy wayyyy too soon to say that Kira can't shoot yet, the man barely played in his rookie year and even if he had, rookie year shooting splits are no guarantee of future shooting ability, see DeAaron Fox, Mike Conley, Kemba Walker etc. Point guards take awhile to develop and that man has speed to burn, so he just needs his jumper to become passable and that man will be extremely hard to stop in the future.   As for NAW, he can create his own shot against most guys in the league and has had a couple of 30 point games in his career, which is impressive for somebody who is still just 22. I think he projects as more of a 6th man than a starter going forward though, but as a starter, I like the idea of having some guard shot creators to run PnR with Zion. The Ingram/Zion PnR is easily switchable."
"&gt;[Wojnarowski] The 76ers are trading Ben Simmons to Oklahoma City for Kemba Walker, sources tell ESPN."
Aka to the Thunder for Kemba Walker lol
Ben and a 1st round pick for Kemba Walker. Who says no?
Kemba Walker &amp; Ish Smith
Kyrie and Kemba Walker
So‚Ä¶  PG - Kemba Walker  SG - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander  SF - Luguentz Dort  PF - Darius Bazley  C - Mike Muscala  6th - Ty Jerome  7th - Theo Maledon  8th - Isaiah Roby   And assuming they don‚Äôt grab anyone of starting interest in FA which I don‚Äôt think they will?
"Sam Presti here, for the low price of Ben Simmons, thybulle, and lets just toss in a first round pick for the fun of it you can have Kemba Walker."
Can‚Äôt wait for Kemba walker to leave OKC and win an MVP
"So Presti has essentially traded Dennis Schroder for Kemba Walker and 3 first round picks.  &amp;#x200B;  Schroder for Green and a first  Green for Horford and a first  Horford for Keba and a first  &amp;#x200B;  And soon, Kemba for multiple firsts or a player and a first."
"Kemba "" Broken Knee Can't"" Walker"
Kemba ‚Äòtennis balls on the foot of his‚Äô Walker
I will personally drive Kemba Walker back to the airport if he even sets foot in LA.
Agreed which is why that pick is too valuable for simply an old Kemba Walker.
Can I still claim that my 21 year old Antoine Walker jersey is a Kemba jersey though?
I wonder if Michael Jordan is laughing at Kemba Walker for leaving him?
Imagine if Kemba Walker plays like the Kemba of old next season and it then traded to a contender more more picks!
I don't love this. Moses is a good pick-up &amp; I'm OK with clearing Kemba Walker but I don't love bringing back Al Horford or getting rid of the #16 overall pick. Feels like we got fleeced.
How can Lakers trade for him? Wasn‚Äôt Kemba Walker just traded to OKC?
Kemba (needs a) Walker
Trade guys for assets just to trade back for them in 3 years Celtics will trade Marcus Smart to OKC for Kemba  Walker and 4 1st round picks but I'm surprised OKC is giving up Moses Brown he's good what's SGA thinking about his team.
"I'm not soothsaying by any stretch of the imagination.  Boston just made a trade that cleared the amount of cap space it would take to make a trade for Luka, mathematically.  There are only two reasons Boston made the Kemba Walker trade, for free agency or for a trade.  I'm just pointing out the obvious here."

"I loved walker here and I really do wish him the best, he‚Äôs just so damn likeable. That being said, I agree, unfortunately his knees gave in and he‚Äôs been out for so long with inconsistency. He has shown flashes of all star, but not the all nba kemba. I think he helped brown and tatum develop, as he gave them the spotlight to shine, I feel like he kept the locker room p stable overall, and I hope the celtics give him an ovation when we play the thunder. Sad it didn‚Äôt work out, but we did feel pressured to sign a replacement to Kyrie (although you really can‚Äôt replace kyrie lmao)"
You mean Kemba Walker who would make $37M and $40M in the next two years who has degenerative knees and can't play back to backs? The Celtics save $20M and get a proven prospect in return and a key player back that was part of their success. #16 picks are hit or miss and the Celtics have tons of young players all ready
Kemba Walker is going to play very little basketball in Oklahoma City. He's going to get the better part of the next year to rest his knee and then he'll make a cameo at some point when he's feeling tip top in order to buff his trade value.
"https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/nba_players_with_trade_kickers_in_2020_21/s1_14822_33795086 &gt; The following players have trade bonuses on their contracts, but those bonuses would be voided if they were to be traded during the 2020-21 league year, since they‚Äôre already earning this season‚Äôs maximum salary:  &gt; ...  &gt; Kemba Walker (15%)  I think we're still on the 20-21 league year since the playoffs haven't ended, but if there are any NBA contract gurus out there who know better please chime in."
"Brad:  Sam, we'll trade you a 1st round pick, Kemba Walker who put up amazing stats and can help you guys wi....  Sam:  Shut up, just shut up.  You had me at 1st round pick :')"
I know it‚Äôs business and you have to do what‚Äôs best for the team but add Kemba Walker to another player the Celtics are doing dirty. Making him the scape goat and sending him off to a rebuilding team
He is a better fit at Hawks. Trae will absolutely enjoy his calming presence.   Trae YOUNG - SKYler Mays - Kemba WALKER  YOUNG SKYWALKER!
"It‚Äôs about the perceived value of the future vs Horford/Walker/CP3/Melo really.   The Thunder are now in the position the Celtics were a few years ago with an abundant amount of picks and while the Celtics failed to move them for something the Thunder are setting up shop for several things; massive influx of young players that will allow them to tank more while developing a core faster than expected and sparing the usage of their deeper picks in 26 and beyond. So they basically get to eat their cake too all for what just taking on several bad contracts that suddenly turn good in a years time?   I think any trade done with OKC is borderline mental at this point because the sooner they have an actual team with promising talent the sooner they can godfather offer Dallas for Luka when he wants out in two years. Or something along those lines with another player.   And all of this is just because several GM‚Äôs signed really bad deals with poor luck and bad fits. And like Morey with Horford, Stevens with Kemba now it‚Äôs the new guy getting rid of the past GM‚Äôs final sin.  From the Thunder perspective they give absolutely zero fucks about how bad the contract is as long as they get a pick. You can always attempt to combine a good pick with a mid tier pick for an all time great pick. Imagine if the Thunder can move up from 3 to 1 because they add the 16th pick or a few more. That‚Äôs the luxury the Thunder have now."
Kemba Walker is beyond negative value. I'm honestly surprised they got someone who could actually help an NBA team at some point while trimming an entire year(and a lot of money) off of what they would have had with Kemba.
"&gt; I really dont think 35 year old Al Horford is a better basketball player than Kemba Walker  Well that's completely incorrect.   https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1=horfoal01&amp;p1yrfrom=2021&amp;player_id2=walkeke02&amp;p2yrfrom=2021  They played pretty similar, and Horford on the Celtics gelled with Smart and the Jays in a way Kemba never did. He provides great leadership, the players love him, and doesn't have a degenerative knee.   No one's saying he's an All-Star. He fits us way better than Kemba will."
"So, just to be clear, Kemba Walker played every game for the Celtics last year 100% healthy. Is that correct? He missed the first month, didn‚Äôt play any back to backs, and was 100% healthy for all 43* games he played?"
"&gt; referring to humans as ""net negatives"" is literally only some shit weirdos on this sub say lol   Is this your first time talking about sports or something? The obvious context is: ""on a basketball team, Kemba Walker as a player on a max contract is a hindrance to his team"""
You know who else is an offensive liability? Kemba Walker. Moses is still young and can potentially fill in his frame a bit more and become a solid player. He reminds me of very very young Clint Capela.
There‚Äôs nothing that can come between Kemba Walker and the hard court. Not even knee cartilage.
Are you implying that Kemba Walker was 100% healthy this year? I‚Äôm not sure what you have an issue with in this comment. Kemba absolutey played games this year at less than 100%. Boston is absolutely in a different position than OKC.
"When I just googled Kemba Walker, the first article that popped up was Forbes from an hour ago titled ‚Äú[The Boston Celtics Don‚Äôt Actually Have to Trade Kemba Walker](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2021/06/18/the-boston-celtics-dont-actually-have-to-trade-kemba-walker/amp/).‚Äù The news of the trade must have broken minutes later. I bet you that author feels like they wasted their time."
who would give up draft picks and pay $40m for one year of 32-year-old kemba walker?
"I hope there is more to this, because this trade is awful   And my Kemba jersey just became a Antoine Walker throwback jersey, which makes this the worst trade in history"
"Green teamers working overtime to defend Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum and (most importantly) Jaylen Brown from all criticisms by scapegoating Kemba Walker, as if he was single-handedly holding the team back.  It's disturbing what is happening in Boston. People deify three people who have achieved nothing in comparison to other Boston sports teams. Tatum redeemded himself a bit but I respect guys like JBJ and Bergeron way more than the trio of Stevens/Tatum/Brown."
I'm honestly surprised OKC are trading Moses Brown. He seems like a really promising young player with size/athleticism and significant potential as a lob threat/rim protector. Not sure what acquiring Kemba Walker does for them at this stage in their rebuild.
Good trade.  Kemba Walker is trash and giving up a 16th round pick usually isn't that impactful.
"What kind of fucking trade is this?  Trading perennial all star in Kemba walker and a first round pick for the old ass body of AL Horford, some unproven young player and a 2nd round pick?"
"Celtics are the most savage organization. Trading away Isiah Thomas after his career year performance. Thomas played in the playoffs for the Celtics with an injured hip after the passing of his sister. Still was traded. Now Kemba Walker is traded after signing with the Celtics. Feel bad for Horford, he tried to get away from this shit organization only to be brought straight back lol"
Kemba Walker and a 1st for Al Horford and Moses Brown? Guess Boston really liked Al.
I really dont think 35 year old Al Horford is a better basketball player than Kemba Walker and I dont think saving the extra $$ on guys who both have 2 yrs left is worth giving up the 16th overall pick in a decent draft. Horford also means you either move Robert Williams to the bench or have to play a Robert Williams/Horford front line major minutes. That or move Horford to the bench which is perhaps the best option. This is purely about saving $$ not about making Boston a better basketball team.
Kemba Walker the starting PG for the New York Knicks!
"Kemba Walker stats for this season. 19, 4, 5, on 42% from the field."
"In a pretty random order and from the top of my head I‚Äôd say:  Derrick Rose   Luka  Brad Beal  Kelly Oubre  Gordon Hayward  Kevin Love  Steven Adams  Zach LaVine  D‚Äôlo  Kemba Walker  Russ (despite my flare this isn‚Äôt biased I swear, I‚Äôm just attracted to that man, his body and overall intensity is üî•üëåüèª)"
"Boston has attracted more highly compensated UFAs from other teams than any other team since 2015.   Al Horford in 2016, Gordon Hayward in 2017 and Kemba Walker in 2019. Kyrie was traded. That is three unique UFA signings.  GSW has 5 big dollar UFA signings, but four of them were already with the team. Cleveland had three, with all of them being resignings (Lebron, Lebron and Love). Dallas got DeAndre Jordon twice somehow according to my data, and resigned Nowitzki in 2016. Miami signed Butler, and resigned Whiteside and Wade. Brooklyn got Kyrie and KD, and resigned Brook Lopez. Toronto resigned FVV, Lowry and Derozan.   Three other teams had 2 big salary UFAs, 12 teams had one, and 8 had none."
Oh boy. Not this narrative again. Maybe we should have maxed out Kemba Walker instead. (Points to head)
I think a 4 way trade with Simmons-Porzingis-Kemba Walker-Russel Westbrook with randomized destinations needs to happen
"Ok...and how do you think it looks to the rest of the league that in 2020 he got essentially 4 months off and still couldn't come back healthy for the playoffs, and then this year missed the first month, did not play any back-to-backs and was still not able to be healthy for the playoffs?   Look, I actually like Kemba Walker, and I think the best move is to keep him and hope he plays himself into being a positive asset again, but you can't act like his value is not at an all time low right now SPECIFICALLY because of his knee issues. We would get screwed if we trade him this summer. We're not getting any of the sweetheart deals that r/bostonceltics says are ""totally possible"""
Kemba ‚ÄúDespite the Win‚Äù Walker
Kemba Walker believes in the heart of the cards and can be a Super Saiyan according to JVG
Kemba Walker 3-14
"It's not. We re at ""Kemba Walker floors Harden"" flopping"
"Once again, kemba walker man..."
Kemba walker useless af
Fucking kemba walker cant even hit a point blank shot
Bench Kemba walker.....
Bruh kemba walker trash af. Get him out of there man
Kemba Walker is just ass
"Imagine if Kemba ""max contract"" walker gave the team more than 2 points"
Kemba walker
"I have some good news and bad news, the bad news your starting point guard has four fouls, the good news it's kemba Walker"
Kemba walker has had enough
I really really want Kemba Walker to be great.  his UConn run made me fall in love with college basketball.  Shit was magical.    I really really want him to be... And sometimes when he hits that badass step back jumper I think it's possible but he's just not gonna be  ):
Kemba Walker is stealing money from the Boston Celtics
Imagine if all that money spent on Kemba walker went literally anywhere else.
Kemba Walker is terrible
"On a similar note Kemba walker always seems to be smiling too whenever the camera pans to him, even when the Celtics are losing."
"simply wouldnt call jaylen brown or kemba walker top 15 lol, well about the clippers, theyre.... the clippers"
"Because every player not named Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker were injured in those games."
"In games that Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Kemba Walker all played the Celtics went 17-16.   The injuries definitely took a toll and losing the 50 games Hayward played for them last year hurt too, but they definitely underperformed even when close to healthy."
"Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kemba Walker are clearly their 3 best players."
"The problem with the Clippers is they don‚Äôt have a mobile 5 that can keep their defense from completely falling apart any time there‚Äôs a pick and roll. Either you switch and Luka destroys the big, or you hedge and recover and send help all the way over to the rim and leave shooters open on the weak side.  Right now, Zubac and Ibaka are liabilities in the pick and roll. Ibaka is not who he used to be, same thing happened in the Celtics series last season where a hobbled Kemba Walker played him off the floor and forced OG Anunoby to play center.  They need to be pre switching all the pick and rolls and keeping Ibaka and Zubac out of them but they just don‚Äôt. They just let it happen. Either Lue is incompetent or he just doesn‚Äôt care, and hopes the Mavs hot shooting cools off."

"&gt; and you have celtics fans wondering why they‚Äôre getting singled out  Regardless of the rest dont start this shitü§£ its always Boston vs the rest of the league because the majority of people outside new england have a raging hate boner for anything sport related.   Also yeah tatums been playing like ass but it‚Äôs not like he has much to work with. The only person he has who can reliably shoot rn is Kemba Walker, the guy yall are so quick to draw Kyrie comparisons to so you can shit all over him. r/nba is so quick to say ‚Äúomg look how good Boston shouldve been on paper!‚Äù but dont watch games and also fail to consider how we‚Äôve had constant injury problems and probably the worst bench in the league, or one of them. Im foggy on the details here but we also got substantially less practice with our starters than other teams due to covid injuries etc.   When tatum drops 40+ its ‚Äúwow omg get him out of there he has no help‚Äù but when tatum plays like shit its ‚Äúwow omg cant talk bad about goldenboi babyface‚Äù. Maybe celtics fans are aggressive because everyones always at our necks for simply existing when we havent even been to the finals in a decade+ or so but ok ü§®"
"&gt; You realize John Stockton, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Elgin Baylor, Reggie Miller, Allen Iverson, etc never won? They have no legacy?  Yea he's definitely not talking about those players, who are all era defining stars. We're talking about Kemba Walker, a very good player, but someone who wont leave much behind in the way of awards, or mind blowing stats, or iconic playoff moments. The reason you brought up Robert Horry, or really the reason almost anyone brings up Robert Horry, is his rings. Proving that for the non-first ballot hall-of-famer players, you need championships to leave behind a legacy to the majority of the NBA fanbase. I don't think it's fair, but it's how it goes."
