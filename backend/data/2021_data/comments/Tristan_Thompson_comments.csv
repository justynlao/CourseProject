"Tristan Thompson haunting us again, this time in a different uniform."
"Here is our roster after your mentioned players:   2 Veterans: Tristan Thompson and washed Jeff Teague   2 Euroleague pickups: Daniel Theis and Javonte Green   9 rookie contracts: Tremont Waters, Carsen Edwards, Tacko Fall, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Rob Williams   Our team routinely is packed with young players with midlevel upside. It's not so much Brad isn't creative enough with his offense, it's just a matter of ability. The team is top heavy and most of these young guys don't know what their ceiling is going to be. Ainge sat on the draft picks and decided he was going to try and build out the roster with young talent instead of trading for established names. It's worked out because Jaylen, Tatum, and to a degree Smart have all worked out, but it's left us top heavy. A contested Tatum 3 is better than Semi Ojeleye doing literally anything. Replace a handful of the rookies with solid veterans and the offense would look a lot better. Despite the fact that it seems like it's not working, Boston is one of 3 teams with a top 10 offense and defense, even with the rotating cast of young players.   Stevens has gotten more than his money's worth in Theis and spun gold out of guys like Jordan Crawford, Jae Crowder, Evan Turner, and others. A good number of former Celtics have gone from Steven's system where they had success to flounder elsewhere.   It may seem boring or uncreative or like bad coaching but if you look at this roster it's a borderline G-League team after the starting 5. This IS the optimized Celtics offense.   Here's the Offensive Rating of the Celtics for each year Stevens has been coach: 27th, 18th, 10th, 8th, 18th, 10th, 4th, 9th   The season we spiked back up to the 18th best offense Ainge made Brad take on **7!!!** rookies, 2nd year Jaylen Brown, no Gordon Hayward, and a hobbled Kyrie Irving.   I hope this doesn't come off as a rant because I really built this comment as I went and it's actually been a frustration of mine with the team overall that we have so many young players, and often undrafted guys rounding out the roster, instead of giving Stevens some older guys to work with. When Stevens had a roster of mid career guys he led us to the #1 seed in the East.   TL;DR  Stevens is a good offensive coach. Boston doesn't have the personnel to do much more than whats on the court right now, but even that is a top 10 offense. When given more established players Brad can spin gold."
"&gt; It's not just who's guarding him but how he affects the way we play.  Lol if your center is gonna be guarded by a SG, ofc he’s gonna have a positive impact on the game. Tristan Thompson also looked like prime Shaq out there scoring over two 6’6” guys"
Tristan Thompson
"I need them to start calling him Tristan   ""Thompson"" this and ""Thompson"" that is making me sad."
Watching Boston - GSW game and man how good Jaylen  Brown and Tatum actually are. Also how bad Kemba Walker and Tristan Thompson play. It is a good chance using this two maybe even add Marcus Smart and maybe even draft rights to get a good big man. Then we might actually see Boston is one of the best teams in NBA
East runs through Tristan Thompson baby
Curry pulling down more boards than Tristan Thompson again man must be getting that PTSD lmao
"I don't like being a hater, but Tristan Thompson might be the least skilled offensive player I've ever seen."
Magic-kobe-Drose-PG-tristan thompson
Isiah Thomas  Kobe  Ron Artest  Karl Malone  Idk about center. Tristan Thompson? Can’t think of any
"Jeff Teague, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson"
He was arguably the toughest player in the league before his injury.  Didn't he have a large stretch of games/average games played?  I think he was the first or at worst top 3 with like Tristan Thompson.  You're bound to get injured having 5 straight finals runs where you're playing nearly an extra season compared to other people after all that.  He already proved his toughness.
"very true &amp; good points, especially if the Celtics don't think that getting Vooch now puts them over the top in the east (I don't think it would).  If they could do it in the offseason it might also make it easier to shed Tristan Thompson and/or other contracts, plus they would have more flexibility around draft capital which would help."
"Payton Pritchard pleasant, Jeff Teague unpleasant. The bench would be Semi Ojeleye pleasant, Tristan Thompson unpleasant.  I expected a leap (still, not this big) from Jaylen so I don’t really think he fits this, tho he is close. I had no expectations for Payton and I expected Semi to be getting 0 minutes. I expected Teague to be a solid backup and Tristan to be a solid starter. All four of no where close to accurate so far."
Donkey got punch in the face by Tristan Thompson at a nightclub.. so we all know who the fake tough guy is
pleasant: Jaylen Brown becoming an All-NBA player  unpleasant: tristan thompson plays like a grandfather
"They cannot pick Drummond up, if you buy Drummond’s 28 mil a year salary out so that he can sign for like 6 mil with the nets that should be investigated. If you don’t buy him out, they need to match salary (and value to compensate for the bad salary they’re sending) - which is impossible. Javale I can see, but if anyone thinks Javale is going to do much against turner/sabonis, Giannis, Embiid, Jokic or AD they’re in for a bad time, hell if you expect him to do much against Tristan Thompson, Montrezll or Ibaka you’re going to have a bad time."
"Uh no not really lol gobert couldn’t do a thing on curry we’ve seen other centers atleast keep up with him like capella and AD, even tristan Thompson did great on him for stretches in 16"
Based on more than half the teams having a center who is clearly better defensively...  1) Nikola Jokić - Denver Nuggets  2) Joel Embiid - Philadelphia 76ers  3) Rudy Gobert - Utah Jazz  4) Jusuf Nurkic - Portland Trail Blazers  5) Nikola Vučević - Orlando Magic  6) DeAndre Ayton - Phoenix Suns  7) Jonas Valančiūnas - Memphis Grizzlies  8) Steven Adams - New Orleans Pelicans  9) Myles Turner - Indiana Pacers  10) Clint Capela - Atlanta Hawks  11) Jarrett Allen - Cleveland Cavaliers  12) Mitchell Robinson - New York Knicks  13) Karl Anthony Towns - Minnesota Timberwolves  14) Al Horford - Oklahoma City Thunder  15) Tristan Thompson - Boston Celtics
"Because Tristan Thompson sucks, not because the 2 big look itself."
Didn’t Draymond get beat up by Tristan Thompson after antagonizing him?
All they need is Tristan Thompson and the prophecy is complete...
Would rather have Tristan Thompson or Turner?
Tristan Thompson is not a good big anymore. I swear the guy hasn’t had a single good game this season and looks pretty darn washed.
Kemba I think will be fine by the playoffs and Tristan Thompson is a good big. The Celtics just don’t have good spot up shooters and lot of their late firsts have been duds tbh  Ojeleye is ok I guess as a 7th man. But yea I don’t see much shooting on the bench. I think they need some wings who can shoot which aren’t easy to get
UMMMMM...They got Tristan Thompson you dummy.
I forgot tristan thompson was with the Celtics
"I like Time Lord (Robert Williams) but he doesn't get a ton of minutes, I'm sure for good reason. So basically we have Theis and Tristan Thompson which... is almost certainly not going to get the job done."
Is Tristan Thompson injures?
"1:1 trade, Tristan Thompson for KD, who says no."
They just need Tristan Thompson and Nets have the ultimate trade package
"Brad Wanamaker, Ish smith, tj McConnell, Tristan Thompson, dj Wilson"
Would you be interested in a lightly used Tristan Thompson?
Tristan Thompson can attest to this
"Well technically Tristan Thompson was supposed to be that, I've got no idea what's wrong with him lol"
"Kemba's a point guard, Smart can play point guard but he's more of a playmaking shooting guard.   Agree with you on the front court - Tristan Thompson was supposed to be the guy for us but he's having a rough start. Wish that the Hayward for Turner sign-and-trade had materialized, but we still have a TPE so whether we can get into that contender conversation depends on how we use it."
Embiid averages more career ppg vs Steven Adams compared to Tristan Thompson.  Hope this helps.
Tristan Thompson is more than competent.   Hope this helps.
Isn't darius garland signed there too? That's why (other than them being former teammates) him and Tristan Thompson are such good friends.
Fuck Tristan Thompson
&gt;I was going through a Tristan Thompson thread talking about his possible jersey retirement in CLE  LOL who the fuck thought Thompson was getting his jersey retired?   &gt;Who in your opinion between Kyrie and Collin would get his #2 jersey retired ?  They probably both would.
"A lot of comments saying its like the 1st year LeBron was with the Lakers, but LeBron was injured (and many were also) and we didn't get to see them at full strength in the playoffs.  I prefer thinking of a supporting cast like George Hill, Larry Nance Jr., Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson, with Jordan Clarkson coming as the 6th man. If the Kings are just as good as these cats, than LeBron can make them contenders, as proven in 2018."
"So, one more caveat here is that for somebody to negatively impact your team, there has to be a demonstrable negative to playing them...  If you're absolute shit, like the Pistons or Wizards or Wolves, replacing one terrible player with an average guy doesn't really change the outcome of your season.  Secondly, if you're just some minimum-salary scrub pressed into service, there was no opportunity cost to your acquisition. Draft capital, trade capital, or financial capital outlay matters.    With that in mind, some possibilities:  Kelly Oubre. Expensive as fuck because of the tax, cost something to acquire via trade, totally awful.  Coby White. Absolutely terrible on both ends, two years in a row, after being a high lottery pick. Plays a ton of minutes, and they're all bad.  Marvin Bagley. Not only has he been completely fucking terrible, picking him over Luka, Trae, Sexton, Shai, Bridges, MPJ, JJJ...fucking unbelievable.  Tristan Thompson...man does he totally blow. The Celts used their one FA asset on a guy who's been awful."
I love all the Celtics fans that are still convinced Tristan Thompson is better lmao
Boston hasn't proved anything. Who's guarding Embid? Who's guarding Sabonis? Who's guarding Giannis? Who's guarding KD?  Tristan thompson? The way emibid/sabonis are playing I'm taking Philly/indiana on that alone.
Hey! Don’t forget about uhhhhh Tristan Thompson
It’s an art. Even in like 2k for example (even though it’s a shit example but probably the most relatable to us all since none of us are nba athletes)everyone wants to be a scorer but nobody wants to be the pass first pg or wing defender. Like I did both because all my friends just wanna shoot but they make me play point because the only vision they have is the ball going in the net lmfaooo. And honestly scoring don’t really win championships that much. Chemistry Defense and great rotations can go a long way which has been the case with most teams the last few years. Even the warriors 2014-2018 they may be known for 3s but my god the ball movement and IQ they have on the court it’s insane not to mention you add in steph motherfucking curry who’s off ball movement is probably goat you have a great mix. I loved watching them play and that iggy mvp championship was one of the best championships I’ve watched since I’ve started watching basketball (I’m only 21 old heads) The system allowed everyone to do well so even if curry had a bad night klay or someone else could drop 40 on you. Look at the nets they have no system yet no good rotations no bench and get their ass handed to them. Look at the clippers when PG and kawhi are out they might as well put fans in the game. Look at Lebron’s old teams when he sat out im still in shock the Miami teams went negative in rating when he sat though. They had a fuck a lot of people but in the end TEAMS win games. That’s why I personally think some nba players and teams will never win. Any NBA caliber talent can come in and drop 20 but can they add to the defense can they play make can some defend multiple positions do they move well off ball. It’s why I like the nba now compared to back then. You can’t just be good at one thing anymore like the old days if you were just a paint guy that’s it. You have to evolve every asset of your game or you will not be there long. Hell even Tristan Thompson shoots 3s now. Would anyone have expected that 5 years ago ? Lol
"Against Embiid, Giannis, Tristan Thompson, Myles Turner/Sabonis, Vucevic and then someone like AD or Jokic??  He will get absolutely roasted"
"I’ll say this once again Tristan Thompson is one of the most luckiest players in nba history, this man skated through the league while being Ass and still gets paid 10’s of millions of dollars"
Celtics getting Tristan Thompson in part to cover Embiid is...not working out lol
So much for the idea of running the offense through Tristan Thompson at the top of the key.
The bad man left CLE though... Tristan Thompson is now in Boston.
Embiid is one of the bigs in the league that knows how to draw fouls and the Celtics tried to guard him with Theis and Tristan Thompson. It’s not a recipe for success.
"Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Brandon Clarke"
Tristan Thompson got a T for yelling at his own bench against the Wizards.
George Hill is an good backup at best  Hood is too inconsistent and injury prone to be a reliable piece  Clarkson played like he never touched a basketball once the postseason came around  Drummond runs laps around Tristan Thompson  This Cavs team easily would’ve been better than the 2018 supporting cast
"No, the 2018 still had guys like George Hill, Rodney Hood and a bunch of vet guys + a much more uinjured Kevin Love, it’s close though. It’s amazing what you can do when you ain’t paying max money to Tristan Thompson."
I believe JR Smith was the one who said he ‘couldn’t play’   Guess that’s what happens when LeBron leaves and vets immediately put all their playoff/Finals expectations on the new guy. I remember Tristan Thompson declared we were gonna be playing for a playoff spot at the start of that season. We went 19-63
Tristan Thompson did say “The East still runs through Cleveland”. They might as well blow it up
"Don’t overrate the players now, Lebron has the ability to make people look better than they really are, look at Tristan Thompson"
"Nah bruh Jimmy gone. Can't count that shit lmao for this team currently. That's like Tristan Thompson saying ""The east run through us"""
"But that difference also comes into play in the situation of fouls as well.   When 7ft 280 lb is guarded by 6’9 240 lb Tristan Thompson and 6’8 245 lb Daniel Theis, those players are forced to play significantly more physical, which also puts them in a bad position to guard effectively without fouling  Tonight, Embiid absolutely embellished, but almost every single one of those instances were absolutely fouls. Lots of pulling, waist grabbing, arm/wrist pulling."
Tristan Thompson was right
"When Lebron was still there and they were struggling, people came up with trade packages for a star to put next to him.  The standard package that people get suggesting was Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, and the Nets pick from that year.  It was said so often that it became a meme.  That Nets pick went on the become Sexton, and now Sexton is busting the Nets' ass.  Full circle."
Tristan Thompson was right. The East does still run through Cleveland
itt: celtics fans not understanding why their team doesn't get as many calls as the best big man in the league who's being guarded by daniel theis and tristan thompson
For all the complaints on FT - there is Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson guarding Embiid. He's much bigger and stronger than both. Point out which plays weren't fouls on him?  &amp;#x200B;  There were a LOT of hard contact fouls. Celtics shot more jump shots - generally leads to less fouls
"Tristan ""2016 NBA champ, and also 2012 All-Rookie Second Team"" Thompson"
tristan thompson has been upgraded to 'an excellent defensive player'
Cue the yearly “Tristan Thompson has developed a jumpshot” story we’d get in Cleveland
* Nickeil Alexander-Walker * Jamal Murray  * Chris boucher  * Dort  * Dillion brooks  * Brendan Clarke  * SGA * RJ * Olynik  * Tristan Thompson * Wiggins    Canadians have the talent to become a pretty strong player in the world basketball stage.
"&gt;How do you do that after meme-ing every fucking contract on the cavs as being so bad?  In fairness, he got forced into paying Tristan Thompson by Klutch Sports."
"All-Canada Team is nasty.  * **PG**: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, Cory Joseph * **SG**: Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker * **SF**: Andrew Wiggins, Dillon Brooks, Trey Lyles * **PF**: Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke, Khem Birch * **C**: Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell"
"I mean ...  Does this apply to ""the east runs by us"" from Tristan Thompson after LeBron left?"
Tristan Thompson does too
Tristan Thompson?
"Canada has three streaks of 3peats:  * Bill Wennington '96-'98 (2nd Bulls 3peat) * Rick Fox '00-'02 (Lakers 3peat) * Joel Anthony '12-'13 (Heatles) + Cory Joseph '14 (Spurs)  With the number of quality Canadian NBA players increasing, it seems likely that there will eventually be a longer streak: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray are legit stars, RJ Barrett still might become a good player if he escapes NY before he gets too much Knicks stank on him, Andrew Wiggins is finally showing some signs of life on defense with Draymond kicking his butt in Golden State, and there are a ton of solid role players that could easily find a roster spot on a championship team: Chris Boucher (2 chips already), Lu Dort, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Cory Joseph (1), Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson (1), Trey Lyles, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell. Marcus Carr is coming, too, and there are a number of other current NCAA prospects."
"I watched those seasons too. On what basis are you arguing they had better seasons? Because LeBron was better offensively and defensively than all of those guys and he had a better season. Using plus minus is a flawed stat, it just means that overall the team was good. Tristan Thompson was like 3rd or 4th one year because he played most of his minutes with LeBron."
Why don’t people talk more about how absolutely useless Tristan Thompson is in every situation yet still continues to be a starter in the NBA?
"That was the worst they looked all season. I think the celts could have used Rob Williams for this game as he is more of a stretchy, athletic big than Tristan thompson/Daniel theis.  Also, the Celtics trying to re-integrate kemba meant less time for pritchard/Teague.   Was a weird game, celts didnt get too many shots to go and they were sloppy.   The Knicks didn't even have to play good. The Celtics were abysmal. Too many times this season of 3-4 minute scoring droughts.  Gg though!"
Grant William and Tristan Thompson combining for 50 minutes and 6 points
NBA players height/weight is so weird in real life. I've only ever seen Aaron Gordon and Tristan Thompson and AG looked like he was malnourished and Tristan Thompson looked a lot smaller than 6'9. Weight looked spot on for Tristan though but I thought he was maybe more like 6'6 than 6'9.
old ass Tristan Thompson lmao
"Tristan Thompson, Montrezl Harrell, Serge Ibaka got paid 9m/yr each. Robin Lopez got 7m. Steven Adams got a 2 years extension for 17m/yr. And those were in the same free agency. Sure, Dwight's injury history and past locker room history might hurt his value a little but I would assume that he's worth at least the same as some of the names on this list"
"It’s pretty simple if you use reading comprehension. Brad should’ve used Kanter better last year/kept him this year because at his best, he’s better than current Tristan Thompson"
Tristan Thompson wasn't on their roster last year
The way Kanter plays on the Blazers &gt; Tristan Thompson
Damn. Incredible season for him.  Where’s Tristan Thompson rank in all these?
"Our big man depth is fine lol - Tristan Thompson, Theis, Rob Williams.   It's not elite but it's good enough, you don't need elite big men to win championships."
That’s cute. I’m guessing ur such a casual that u don’t know who jr smith or Tristan Thompson are
"Celtic fans didn’t want him in the potential Hayward sign and trade, so they could sign Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson"
I think Celtics depth is solid with Pritchard Teague ojeleye and theis once Kemba comes back.  They also have Tristan Thompson who’s a solid defender at the center position and won’t be abused like kanter did. The Celtics could use one more wing scorer but I don’t think interior defense is a big issue for them
"Super team with old ass d wade, Tristan Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, jr Smith, George hill, Larry nance? You’re tripping"
hope tristan thompson owns the boards against deandre jordan
"we have 3  centers. tristan thompson looks great, Theis is decent. and Robert Williams looks great in the few minutes he comes off the bench  we need to use our TPE for probably a backup wing/2 guard combo or a power forward like john collins"
"I’ve always noticed that sports games can never do difficulty correctly. If you have to change sliders to make it less easy or more difficult, then it is not done correctly. You should only have to use sliders for easier or less challenge.  Madden is the worst with this. You can only get stops if you get takeaways, so pretty much interceptions.  NBA 2K is just as bad, where your guys can’t hit dunks, but opposing Tristan Thompson can be perfect from fadeaways close to the 3-point line. That’s not good whatsoever.  NHL is also bad, in that your goalie will never make the save, so you have to shoot like 50 times to win."
"Idk, according to Tristan Thompson Lebron [""eats like shit""](https://www.gq.com.au/fitness/sport/lebron-james-apparently-has-the-worst-diet-ever-which-is-great-news-for-your-next-cheat-meal/news-story/d5e04366a6fefcce8843ac3622fd7bd9)"
"Pretty sure Tristan Thompson said that Lebron doesn't have that good of a diet, that he eats a lot of desserts. He just works out so much that he burns everything off"
"Yeah, but if they were C's fans they also can't tell the difference between Myles Turner and Tristan Thompson."
There are 3 important numbers to know:  109 mil: “cap”  133 mil: “luxury tax line”  139 mil: “tax Apron” aka the Hard Cap.   You have the option to go as far ahead of luxury tax as you want and penalties go up- but for the most part you can only resign your own players (this is basically Something called Bird Rights). If you use an exemption to get another player (free agent and not trade) then you get restricted to the the Hard Cap aka the Tax Apron line (the Celtics used the MLE to get Tristan Thompson this year and so they are hard capped). Though if you are above the luxury tax line you can still sign veteran minimum players (Nets and Blake griffin for example). The league set it up for you to basically keep your players and if you go over (so the Warriors are about 40 mill above the tax line and are paying like 80 mill in “taxes” and so that you extra money goes towards the teams below the “luxury tax line” as a reward. Nets and Warriors and all the other expensive big baller teams are funding the rest of the financially responsible teams
"Over Kyrie? If we are talking about overall greatest Cavs players as far as team culture, fandom, etc - and not just the most talented, here’s a few:  LeBron  Austin Carr Larry Nance Sr Larry Nance Jr (already) Mark Price Zydrunas Ilgauskas Brad Daugherty Tristan Thompson Bingo Smith Ron Harper Lenny Wilkins Tristan Thompson  **Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye**"
My top 5 Cavs of all time from a lifer -   LeBron  Mark Price Larry Nance Sr.  Big Z Tristan Thompson (fuck everybody TT is goat)
I’d laugh so hard if he’s on here posterizing Tristan Thompson
"Tristan Thompson, Carsen Edwards, and a 2021 first rounder for Derozan?"
"You’ve got the superstar goggles on, I remember Toronto once getting a tech because Tristan Thompson elbowed Lebron. If it was anything that could potentially injure the NBA golden child that’s a fine and an ejection"
Doing forget about Tristan Thompson
Celtics fans will tell you Tristan Thompson is the worse

"Well take kyrie and Tristan Thompson, and Wiggins off of the caviliers.  That means no kevin love to cleveland   So it would have mostly been LBJ and first/2nd round exits. They would neve4 be good enough for a ring they would never be bad enough for the lottery. Since cleveland is a super small market free agents wouldn't flock over there.   Maybe he steals 1 ring. But he won't have his 4 rings without leaving."
"The roll to the rim, Tristan Thompson fills. Play on words!"
Tristan Thompson kind of effective so far
Fine  u/celtics get:  Bradley Beal  Davis Bertans  Moritz Wagner  u/WashWizards get:  Kemba Walker  Tristan Thompson  Javonte Green  2021 - RD 1  2021 - RD 2  2021 - RD 2  https://tradenba.com/trades/qr\_UOhwtQ
The Tristan Thompson method
"Tristan Thompson has filled his role well for us, he controls the glass and gets the occasional bucket, I think our fans just had unrealistic expectations for him.   We have two major issues, we need another guy who can put up 15 or so points a game and a facilitator.   Smart can be the facilitator when he gets back, he was doing well before he got hurt, and it’s a part of Pritchard’s game that needs improvement. Obviously he’s a rookie so there is plenty of time to develop it. If we could get a veteran guard on the cheap to replace Teague and run the offense for 15 minutes a game it would help.  We need the other scorer to take the pressure off the Jays when only one of them is on the court. Kemba looks better by the game but we need a wing or a stretch big as well. This is what we need to use the TPE on, but it probably won’t happen until the offseason so we can spend all of it. Ideally Nesmith or Langford will develop enough to take that role on in the future."
"Gordon Hayward is good, Tristan Thompson is not, and Kemba is clearly not 100%"
The east has always gone through Tristan Thompson 🤷‍♂️
I hope this game helped Brad finally realize that Tristan Thompson should never be played over Timelord.
bro the nba gonna kill tristan thompson for the lore wtf
The tristan thompson thing was so dumb and their whole fanbase was behind it. Same with Semi Ojeleye🤔. Grant williams might be a bit of an exaggeration tho
"Here's the thing --  *What centers?*  Since Brad started, Ainge has given him a steady stream of bargain-bin, 6' 8"", bench-quality power forwards, and expected them to be starting centers.  Brandon Bass, Jared Sullinger, Daniel Theis, Tristan Thompson, I could go on.  We end up playing 'center by committee', and it gets absolutely, ruthlessly exposed as soon as we get into the playoffs, and run into guys like Bam or AD.  Brad can't *use* our centers, because Ainge keeps giving him *tiny guys who suck.* They *can't* play center. Certainly not at a championship-contending level, and now, not even at *regular season* level.  I'm sorry for ranting. But this center issue is a *real* stick up my ass."
Tristan thompson was a Celtic killer though in the playoffs
Let’s not pretend that Celtics fans thought their supporting cast was actually decent in the beginning of the season lmao.   “Grant Williams next Draymond green”  “Semi Ojeleye has reinvented himself into a top tier sniper role player”   “Tristan Thompson is better than Myles Turner and his championship experience will help the Celtics”
MF acting like he doesn't know the Eastern Conference still runs through [Cleveland](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/cavaliers/2018/09/27/tristan-thompson-cavaliers-eastern-conference-favorite-celtics-sixers/1449997002/)
"I am not sure why anyone thought otherwise. We went from jrich/horford/trash version of tobias/shake as our supporting cast for Embiid/Simmons, to all star tobi, seth, danny green, shake milton, dwight as a backup.      Meanwhile the celtics lost Hayward and the best player they got back is Tristan Thompson, Kemba is only getting worse and his playstyle doesn't complement the Jays. I had the sixers above Boston in my pre-season predictions, but I didn't predict the Celtics would be this bad... I'm not complaining though."
I think this is one of those cases where its just as much about the guys filling in as about who is missing. It doesnt seem like Marcus Smart should have this big of an impact but when his minutes are going to the likes of Aaron Nesmith and Tristan Thompson it makes a little more sense.

"Lost Hayward, Kemba is cheeks, Danny made no moves aside from getting a nearly washed Tristan Thompson and a completely washed Jeff Teague, no Marcus smart. Roster full of bums outside of 5 guys."
"Tatum and Brown are studs and can definitely be part of a championship core in the future.  But last year, especially with Hayward out a few weeks of the playoffs, their lack of a bench really hurt them.  You can't win a championship when your bench is full of rookies, 2nd year players, Enes Kanter and Brad Wanamaker.  The Tristan Thompson/Jeff Teague signings were a good idea on paper but it hasn't really worked out."
"I think I actually agree with this.   Brad peaked when he had that Horford, IT, Crowder, Evan Turner, Avery Bradley, Amir Johnson crew. True unselfishness and no real ""star"" besides IT and they could play his system of wings and bigs where everyone passes and is you keep moving the ball until you get a great shot.   But man, he doesn't know how to work a stars strength into the system he runs. it's either ""everyone better be able to pass"" or ""you, superstar, go iso and take the shot""  We have a roster where neither of those two things work because we don't have kyrie anymore and we don't have passing bigs or a true playamking point guard.   Obviously I think some of it is the roster but this team has more talent that what we're seeing and it's def Brad's fault.   What's pissing me off is the organization is pointing fingers at the players and everyone is defending brad and Ainge.   Honestly, I've watched too many Celtics games to blame the players this time around. Its just not working and blaming a 24 and 22 year old all star for ISOing when their teammates are Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson is fucking embrassing and it's going to run both of the Jays out of town.   Ainge has this off season to really get this roster fixed or we''re legit fucked lol"
"Now we can dump all our problems on a mix of Kemba, Jeff Teague, Tristan Thompson, Brad Stevens, Danny Ainge, Bill Simmons, Lucky, and the ghost of Al Jefferson"
Don't think Tristan Thompson post ups are gonna get it done
"Who's Thomas? Tristan Thompson? I would gladly deal Thompson for Bembry or Stanley Johnson lol, Thompson is inefficient, slow and can't defend anymore, and a bad fit here"
You're not watching these games.  Zion is by far the more impactful player. Love BI though. Even last game they gave the ball to Zion to make the right play and he passed to BI for the game winning shot. He also drove in into and through Tristan Thompson for the and 1.  You will start seeing them go to Zion more and more down the stretch because he makes the right play.
Robert williams is ranked 11th in PER. You better contact Brad stevens and let him know hes got an all star benched in favor of tristan thompson

Luka is probably 6'8 at this point. Tristan Thompson is like 6'9 so they are close
Wth Doncic is like as tall as tristan thompson?
Tristan Thompson at least gives the Celts energy.
You just need to let them grow and put an actual team around them that isn’t constantly hurt and actually has valuable veterans. Playing Tristan Thompson a ton of minutes kind of signals how shit their rotation is.
"And he is, to the Nets, what Tristan Thompson or fucking JR Smith were to the Cavs.  It's insane."
The 2015 Cavs game 5 starting lineup   LeBron James  Tristan Thompson  Iman Shumpert	  Timofey Mozgov	  Matthew Dellavedova
"They were 8-3 before Kemba came back, with Smart starting at PG in most of those. Teague was only starting when Tristan Thompson was out, the regular lineup was Smart, Brown, Tatum, Thompson, and Theis."
"Oh damn, I looked at the wrong thing and thought I saw Rose on a cheaper contract. I messed up there. That's still cheapish in today's NBA, but I thought read he was on a lesser salary. That's my mistake.  I will say, not being stuck with Kemba's contract would have opened the door for a little more flexibility. We ended up with Tristan Thompson and Enes Kanter with our last MLEs. I would have preferred just upping Timelord's minutes over them 2. People always say players can't be traded such as Al Horford last year, but there's always a way to make something happen. This just sounds like more reason for me to not like our FO, because this screams mismanaged cap along with underwhelming roster construction."
They could have had Myles Turner and Doug McDermott for Hayward instead of losing him for nothing.  They were not interested since they thought Tristan Thompson was a better fit for the price.  Turner is going to be top 5 in defensive player of the year voting / the clear starting 5 and McDermott would be the first guy off the bench for them.  It’s an egregious mistake.
"They can use the full value because they won't be hard capped from signing Tristan Thompson. However, if they acquire a player through a S&amp;T then they become hard capped again."
&gt; Don’t know how Boston gets that deal done.  Picks and whatever is needed to move them back under the hard cap (I think Tristan Thompson does it)
"On top of the fact that we are clearly in a rebuild/development cycle. I have got shit all year for saying it but look at our roster, we have 10 guys 24 or younger. Our ""veterans"" are an injured Kemba, Tristan Thompson , and Jeff Teague.  Everyone needs to relax on the celtics talk, our best players are 24 and 22. Our young guys even look promising, Pritchard, Williams, Romeo, and now suddenly Nesmith all look like legit NBA players when they are on the court.  Give it time guys, teams with 22 year old leaders dont win championships"
"Imagine if LeBron demanded the Cavs trade Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, and Wiggins to get him from Miami and the furthest they got in the playoffs was the 2nd round. That's what Melo did to the Knicks."
"&gt;I don't think people actually know who Myles Turner is. He's an undersized 5 who gets doesn't create shots for himself.   Im well aware, Im not a big Myles Turner guy in general. This isnt an argument of ""Danny is a complete moron for not wanting Myles Turner"" it's an argument about why are you turning around and offering $10 mil to Tristan Thompson then if you decide you dont value the C position. None of those issues you listed TT was ever going to fix other than maybe post defense which is at the bottom of the list in terms of what's most important.   &gt;Turner wouldn't fix that problem, he would be part of that problem.  One thing Turner would help with is per CTG the Celtics have gone from 9th in terms of opponent FG% at the rim last yr to 25th this year. What he can help is all relative, Celtics are 9th right now in defense. If you put Turner on the team maybe its like 4th. Does it fix their offensive issues no not really but it gives you a bigger margin for error.   Beyond that I dont largely disagree their issues come down to the offense being average, lacking depth/good players, Kemba and never getting to the rim. A number of those issues you listed existed last year also and didnt prevent the season they had. They just lack enough good players."
Yo that Tristan thompson! i thought that was a guard
there was no foul.  I even watched other angles that the people under you said to watch.  I'm not a Celtics or Tristan Thompson fan.  This is a result of certain players getting favorable calls.
"the Celtics are starting Theis and Tristan Thompson right now and their 6th man is Aaron Nesmith, Im fine with them having 2 all-stars"
Combined Theis and Thompson are giving us a lot of what we were getting from Horford.   * Theis gives us the shooting  * Thompson and Theis both switch reasonably well  * Thompson has a bit of a post-game  * [Theis + Thompson have been a lot better at playmaking in the post for one another lately](https://www.celticsblog.com/2021/2/20/22292298/parquet-plays-the-daniel-theis-tristan-thompson-high-low)

Tristan Thompson is thicc as fuck and Williamson just trucked him
How do you make Tristan Thompson look like a child? Wtf is Zion made of
"At the expense of Danny Ainge no less ....TWICE.    Every GM makes mistakes, but if MJ calls the Celtics and offers something for Tristan Thompson, someone needs to take the phone away from Ainge."
"It’s not that it isn’t valuable it’s just replaceable. If you want only rebounding, prime Tristan Thompson is just as good as AD, Joel, etc.  That’s how you get Javale McGee being a top 10 player in 2018."
"That is not stacked  Stacked is  MVP LeBron James  FMVP Dwyane Wade  AllNBA Chris Bosh  Ray Allen  ALL NBA Kevin Love  Kyrie Irving  Tristan Thompson  Jr Smith  Kyle Korver  MVP AND DPOY CANDIDATE /ALLNBA Anthony Davis  Kyle Kuzma  Rajon Rondo  KCP  Former DPOY Marc Gasol  6MOY CAN DENNIS  6MOY MONTREZL  Caruso  Etc  Vs   Patrick Bev, EG, Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Ryan Anderson... lol.

"Put Ben Simmons in an open gym and he’ll hit a ton of 3s, there’s videos somewhere on the internet somewhere of Tristan Thompson hitting like 20 straight 3s in an open gym. Totally different world in a real game even when you are wide open"

"&gt;the question was asked with that specific phrasing because tristan thompson had literally just made a comment like a day or two earlier praising lebron for being a father-like role model leadership presence on a team with a bunch of guys younger than him or some shit, which never gets brought up when people endlessly circlejerk over this clip..  Nah that’s bullshit. Tristan was just making a joke.  It’s a massive reach to extrapolate an age-gap joke to “LeBron is our father figure”. The reporter was clearly trying to get a reaction out of Kyrie."

"You cannot tell the story of basketball without Vince. He popularized basketball in Canada and is a huge reason behind the influx of players coming from Canada. Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett. There are many more that were exposed to basketball because of Vince."
"CLE didn't buy out Tristan Thompson last year, that doesn't seem to be their thing."
"I only bought it after getting my tax return and fantasy football winnings :P oh and funny story Tristan Thompson almost killed me when he dived for a loose ball and landed in the seat next to me, that dude IS HUGE. Funny we've got him now."
"Man I vividly remember a moment when the Cavs were in the Finals and it's near the end of the quarter with a few seconds left. LeBron takes the inbound, dribbles up to half court and is wide open, but passes it to Tristan Thompson for a half court heave. Just lol."
"I couldn’t even name the Bulls center when they were running the triangle, I’m sure Tristan Thompson is at least as good or better"
"And DJ Augustin, Myles Turner, Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen, and Tristan Thompson."
"Haven't had any continuity. Kemba missed the first half of the season, during that stretch Tatum missed several games due to COVID protocol. Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague, their 2 main FA signings haven't panned out at all. Marcus Smart got hurt when Kemba came back. Add in Pritchard's injury (a guy that actually has contributed really well off the bench) in there too."
"If he plays a Tristan Thompson role he can contribute to any team in the league, but the man wants to be a combination of Jokic and Embiid and he's just not cut out for any of that shit"
"He's not bad. He's like Tristan Thompson is steroids, but we don't see TT trying to be a hero with the ball on his hands"
They didn't buy out Tristan Thompson last year.  And Thompson did far more for the Cavs than Drummond's 1.1 seasons there.
I remember someone telling me that Tristan Thompson was as good as Myles Turner.
"I see Celtics fans are still working through their emotions following Tatum’s 6 points/8 rebounds/4 assists on 3-14 shooting (21%) and 0-2 from three performance against the worst defensive team in the league.   You might not know this, but neither Tristan Thompson nor Andre Drummond were on the Celtics last year."
Tristan Thompson is who the Celtics did this with
"I'd be shocked if the C's pursue Drummond.  We already have Drummond-lite in Tristan Thompson.  Sure Drummond's stats are better, but what does Drummond provide on the court that Thompson doesn't to a reasonable degree?  And I'm sure the sting of Kyrie is enough to avoid any potential for locker room cancer.  Ainge has already vocalized that wings/vets are priorities anyways as our wing depth is trash right now."
"Injuries, Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson both suck more then they should, and finally brad is trying to figure things out. I think he feels that as long as they are playing there best come playoff time the regular season won’t matter."
Think you guys would like Tristan Thompson at the deadline? Have a feeling Boston might be sellers this year
"In writing and replying to most of the comments on this thread there was not one mention of Tristan Thompson, I actually forgot that he was on the Celts. And I thought Robin Williams was pretty well received rookie-caliber player."
"Kanter &gt; Tristan Thompson. He’s a monster on the boards and plays big, physical centers much better. He always does work on Embiid"
Why is Tristan Thompson +8 in this game
Tristan Thompson acting like a tough guy against garrison Matthews
Tristan Thompson became Westbrook's shooting coach?
"Celtics it'd be -&gt; Kemba underperforming, lack of interior defense + injuries.  Hayward was nice to have off the bench but the Celtics dont need him right now, especially with Jaylen Brown's emergence (once again, mans is ceilingless I guess).    I dont mind Tristan Thompson but the guy just seems to not care on defense, wouldve preferred to see that money go towards someone like Favors or Ibaka."
Jerami Grant - 53  Kevin Love - 75  Duncan Robinson - Just outside top 100  Tristan Thompson - Probably not top 200
"Cavs starting lineup in Game 6 and 7 of ECF in 2018 (Love was injured):   George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron, Jeff Green, Tristan Thompson.  Beal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; literally everybody on the 2018 Cavs, including Love."
David West and Tristan Thompson
Tristan Thompson was something else in 2016
Peyton Pritchard is going to have a good career.  Tristan Thompson on the other hand is pretty washed.
Ainge wouldn’t hang up that fast. First he would counter by offering them to give Barnes+all their firsts for the next 4 years for Tristan Thompson

The funniest play of this game Tristan Thompson clearing going out of bounds &amp; the refs just ignoring it
"They can have one slightly used Tristan Thompson for Joe Harris, if that's what they want."
You have Tristan Thompson and Theis instead lmao
"Kyrie had the best games of his life and they still had to come back from down 3-1. For AD to replicate that it would take the same from him which can’t just be expected. The drop off from the crazy Kyrie to Mo Williams is much bigger then the drop off from Anthony Davis to Tristan Thompson.  I know you are a Lakers fan and simple facts don’t process well, but it is completely reasonable to say the Warriors could win in 5. They doesn’t make someone a troll."
You have to look at who he’s replacing though. Drop off from Kyrie to Mo Williams is bigger than the drop from AD to Tristan Thompson
Where’s Tristan Thompson when u need him 😂😂
"Good point, noted not-NBA player Tristan Thompson didn’t experience a health condition that could impact his ability to play basketball.   Also, no other players have missed time due to Covid, at all. Including the best shooter on the Sixers"
"I find it funny and scary that Tristan Thompson, King-Ding-a-Ling, contracted COVID-19 **first** before a major STD."
Just never forget when Tristan Thompson laid him out. Then smile and breathe.
I mean he had Kyrie who was obviously great and then guys like J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson.  Didn't exactly have a superteam.
"Nearly 600k deaths. But people need Tristan Thompson to confirm ""it's not a joke""."
Tristan thompson not allowed to criticize?
The pandemic runs through Tristan Thompson
"It’s more so that the virus symptoms are pretty inconsistent around the country. Some people have it really bad like Tristan Thompson. My grandfather had the same thing and sadly he is no longer with us. But for me and the rest of our family it wasn’t very severe and I was better in a matter of a few days. I can see a lot of people getting something similer which is why they don’t want the vaccine, because they already beat covid with no problems. Some people are already immune and the virus doesn’t affect them. This is why people get mad when the vaccine is forced, because they feel like it doesn’t people since they haven’t seen it first hand"
"Based just on these tweets I'm 99% sure he did have covid. The second tweet literally says ""Tristan Thompson on having COVID-19"""
Never said we were experts either. But the media has an incentive to make money so they slander players or put shit takes.   My lively hood doesn't depend on the fact that I create a narrative that Tristan Thompson is a POS but Bill Simmons and his crew live off of that.

It goes without saying that I'm surprised Tristan Thompson ever scored 25 points
Holy fuck was Tristan Thompson good on D tonight
"This is just a plain stupid take.   Our rotation was:  **Starters:** George Hill, JR Smith, LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson.   **Bench:** Jordan Clarkson, Kyle Korver, Rodney Hood, Jeff Green, Larry Nance Jr.   And then the three guys to round out our roster were Jose Calderon, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic.  Please enlighten me; what about this roster screams *great team*?"
"eh, they didn’t lose too many top guys for many games Tatum’s played 45 and Brown 47  losing Tristan Thompson, Teague, Langford, Robert Williams, Smart for stretches is tough but not much of an excuse when the Blazers, Mavs, Heat, Lakers, have missed more important guys to injuries/covid"
"Any other centres who get described in this way? I only ever hear people say ""he can bang down low"" when it's Tristan Thompson. Never anyone else.  Like has anyone said that Zion can bang down low? Embiid can bang down low? Kemba walker can't bang down low?"
"&gt;Everytime I talk basketball with my friends and family, Tristan Thompson comes up  Are you related to TT? Or perhaps a kardashian?"
"Tristan Thompson stinks, you're right about that. Langford hasn't even played 400 career minutes, it remains to be seen if he can be good or not. Personally I think he will be good. Pritchard has better numbers than Korkmaz despite being a rookie.  Bottom line, I'm not too worried about this team's future. We'll see if they can salvage something this season, but they're not nearly as bad as they have played thus far."
Missing one Tristan Thompson isn’t a huge dea
Pritchard and Langford? My man Korkmaz is our 10th guy and he's better than both those guys. Tristan Thompson stinks too
I can’t imagine thinking saying names like Delly and Tristan fucking Thompson would somehow prove a point.
"Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, Matthew Dellavedova, and Kyrie Irving (just game 1 but it counts)."
"Losing Hayward really hurt them because he was their best playmaker and someone who always made the right play (when healthy).  Now their only good playmaker is Smart, and he's missed time and isn't enough on his own. Brown, Tatum and Walker aren't really playmakers or particularly it passers.   On top of it, Kemba is hurt and isn't getting to the rim anymore or shooting well. And they've missed a shit ton of games to COVID-19.  Tristan Thompson has sucked. The young guys aren't good or aren't playing (at least not yet).  It's basically the perfect storm of total shit."
"Yeah, people always talking about Lu Dort, another Canuck, but Brooks is another killer defender who seems at times like he could make a jump on offense, and at least tighten up his 3 and be a real contributor on a contender  After the disappointing passivity of dudes like Wiggins and Bennett, Canada has a whole bunch of bad mfs coming out.  Jamaal Murray, Brooks, dort  + Up and coming SGA,Rj barrett, chris Boucher, khem birch, Brandon Clarke, Nickeil Alexander Walker  + veterans like Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Corey Joseph, Dwight Powell,  Hopefully can run for a silver at next international"
There's no way Tristan Thompson is getting his jersey retired even if he stayed in Cleveland until the end of his career.
They don't have to retire his number but he played in New York for 10 years as a starter during their most successful run in the last 40 years. Kinda like as a Cava fan I'd Tristan Thompson isn't necessarily one of the best Cavaliers ever but if he had re-signed last off-season for another 2 or 3 years then I think he absolutely ends to in the rafters because of his role in those championship runs and his long-standing commitment to the team.
"Turns out Luke Kornet, Robert Williams and Tristan Thompson are BBQ chicken"
"Well first off... we didn't have two of those guys this game. Playing Tristan Thompson instead of Tacko Fall does change the equation somewhat.   Secondly, we're winning the regular-season series against Milwaukee and Giannis has really struggled against Boston (16 point and 13 point nights)."
"I had actual Celtics fans telling me at the start of the year that Tristan Thompson, timelord, and Theis were gonna be able to not get totally dominated by Giannis and Embiid in playoff series lol."
"I hated Tristan Thompson when he played for the Cavs against the Celtics, I think I hate him more now that he's on the Celtics &amp; keeps being patient zero for protocol violations."
Tristan Thompson
Is Tristan Thompson even on the roster anymore?  Seems like they just forgot to cut him at this point .
Tristan thompson always get the ball tries his hook shot and it comes up short. And when he's cold I hate seeing smart shoot.
"Better than their PLAYOFF roster, which Hayward was not a part of. Kemba is actually doing better now, about on par with his stats last season. Tatum is better, Brown is better. Theis is gone but Timelord is miles better. Add Pritchard, Fournier, and Tristan Thompson to the roster. It is better than last year’s playoff roster."
"Half of Bostons games lost is just by Tristan Thompson, Langford and Javonte Green lol"
"Bam if he can put it all together. Right now he  reminds me of DeAndre Jordan on defense and a bit limited like Tristan Thompson on offense. But he’s still raw, lots of potential."
"Friendly reminder that of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry.  And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall."
"Did you watch our games this year? Sexton is our go-to scorer and he's way better at it than Drummond. Garland's better too. Nance and Love both are as well when there healthy. Sexton and Garland and Nance are all very strong facilitators as well. I mean, just the fact that you said that makes it clear you haven't watched any of our games this year, which means you haven't watched any of Drummond's games this year, which completely invalidates literally everything you said. He is solid at getting steals for a big, but he's not even the best stealing big on our team (that would be Nance). And steals per game and blocks per game are not measures of good defenders; Hassan Whiteside and Steph Curry have led the league in blocks and steals per game, respectively, and neither of them can guard a fence post. He didn't even run the pick and roll for us that much, so I have no idea where you're getting all of this from. Most of our shooting comes from Sexton slashing. I never said anything about Marc Gasol. I think he's not a stating level center in the league anymore. But I can tell you, having watched Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond each many, many times, that Tristan is a better player. You'll see once Drummond plays with the Lakers, since I assume you'll watch those games. He tricks people who only look at his box score. He's worth the contract the Lakers are paying him, but not much more."
"Tell me who was the the go to scorer for the pistons or cavs. Once again tell me who were the ball handlers that were supposed to get the offense set for those teams while Drummond was there also. You claim he cheats on defense for rebounds but he averages close to 3 defensive plays per game (1.4 steals and 1.5 blocks, elite defenders don't average that). How can you claim he does little to open up the offense when he's seen as a great pick and roller? Do you know how that opens the offense for shooters if someone helps on the roll? Just because the cavs and pistons had garbage surrounding him doesn't make him a bad player.   Everything you said was devoid of facts. Marc Gasol is a below average center at this point. Drummond is a clear upgrade and judging by his pursuit in the buyout market from playoff teams, he's clearly seen as an upgrade and contributor for a playoff team by most of the league. Someone like Tristan Thompson is an average center. No one wants the below average washed Marc Gasol right now."
"That takes into account the last 3 years, so basically the last 2 playoffs for Harrell.  Whilst I'm sure his grandmother's death affected him, it's more about his skillset and that skillset not being conducive to the playoffs.   That guy who tweeted what I originally posted is the BBALL Index founder and Lakers fan, and what he said is on point, bigs who are post scorers on offense or anchor bigs on defense have a lot less value in the playoffs.   Conversely, bigs that are stretch bigs on offense or mobile bigs on defense, have a lot more value in the playoffs.  Think about it logically, it makes sense. It's why somebody like Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson (god damn it Danny Ainge), Drummond, Harrell etc. aren't valuable in the playoffs, whereas bigs like Ibaka, Gorgui Dieng are what everybody wants.   Celtics played Theis over Kanter in the playoffs for most of last season. Raptors were dominant whenever they played Ibaka in the playoffs last season, but thankfully they didn't play him enough minutes, and we high PnRed Gasol to death when he was out there and exploited him."
"Which Cavs team? Back in his first stint? I’m not knocking LeBron at all, but he’s had at least one other All-Star and usually two on every team he’s made the playoffs with since his first Cleveland stint. He had K-Love, Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, JR Smith, and some pretty decent complimentary pieces and we considered that a carry job.   It’s possible that he would take this team to the ECF but I don’t think it’s a given at all, especially since nobody in question is in the Eastern Conference."
"You can't be serious.   The way Drummond is perceived here, you would think Tristan Thompson is way better than him."
"This isn't really true for athletic Centers though. A lot of centers peak in their early 20s, like Drummond and Tristan Thompson. Capela also had his best years in his early years, although you might argue that's team related."
"If anything, TT is average. But Tristan Thompson in 2021 has no offensive game at all and is average at best at rebounding. He can't guard the rim for shit"
You're out of your mind if you think Tristan Thompson is above average. Unless I've teleported back to 2016
"1/2 Tatum, Brown  3/4 Smart, Kemba  5/6 Timelord, Fournier  7 Pritchard  so 8/9 would probably be Ojeleye and Tristan Thompson"
"The most-recently-drafted Top 10 draft pick to even play in the Finals is Kentavious Caldwell-Pope -- drafted #8 overall by the Pistons in 2013.  The most-recently-drafted Top 10 pick to play in the Finals with his draft team was Harrison Barnes -- #7 overall by the Warriors in 2012.  Of the past 100 top 10 picks -- 2009 through 2019 -- only Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry have even played in the Finals with their draft team.  &amp;#x200B;  This idea that a team just needs a first-round pick to win is not well supported."
I mean he did outrebound Tristan Thompson for an entire playoff series
Tristan Thompson
"Backup PG =&gt; Brunson  Consistency =&gt; Too vague so I don't know what you mean by that  Rebounding =&gt; Who should we trade for? Andre Drummond, Hassan Whiteside, Clint Capela , Enes Kanter , Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson?  I suppose we should offer their current team all our first round picks and give them a max contract post trade.  I think you are searching too hard for holes. Mavs don't need to be perfect to become champions. A little better team than right now and with some winners luck, they can get it done."
"Perfect storm.  Smart missed half the season and hasn't looked right since he returned.  It's impossible to overstate his defensive impact on past seasons - this is the guy that used to cover up for IT's extreme defensive inefficiencies.  That's a big part of it.  Hayward was a better defender than people give him credit for and he's gone.  Tatum is the best defender on the Celtics and he missed a bunch of games plus had Covid hangover for weeks.  Tristan Thompson has not been as good as advertised.  Jaylen taking on a bigger offensive load has seemed to hurt him on the defensive side.  Really no one major thing other than Smart, just a lot of little things going wrong.  Kind of the story of this Celtics team this season.  It's hard to fix things when there's no easy switch to flip anywhere."
"&gt; I didn’t use TS% because isolating a subset of games on bball ref doesn’t give you TS%.  It does though. When you go to his games played, you just click advanced stats and it's right there.  [Link.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walkeke02/gamelog-advanced/2021/)   Then you select the games you want and it will give the average TS% for those games.   &gt;2016-2017 he shot 44.4% from the field and 39.9% from 3, both better than the subset of games you are talking about.  &gt; Even last year he shot 42.5% from the field, 38.1% from 3.  &gt; 2017-2018 he shot 43.1% from the field, 38.4% from 3.   Right... In the 1st and 3rd seasons, he was less efficient than he currently is.   In the 2nd season, he was equally efficient as he currently is.    You're arguing about people hiding behind TS% but all you're doing is hiding behind FG% and 3P% with zero consideration for shot selection and shot quality.      &gt;Would you rather him get to the line less but make slightly more of the attempts, or would you rather him get to the line more?  Would you rather:  * score more points on x number of possessions   * score fewer points on x number of possessions    You can say ""nephews this"" and ""nephews that"" but we're not living in the 70s anymore. FG% isn't an accurate way of tracking efficiency (especially when we're talking guards who shoot a lot of 3s).   Unless you want to sit here and argue that Tristan Thompson (currently 53% from the field) is more currently efficient than Steph Curry's best-ever season (50.4%)?"
Tried to Tristan Thompson the Lakers
That’s okay. I’ll take Tristan Thompson disappointing over having my team act like the league has a conspiracy against them
Yeah sorry about that. Probably could've included Tristan Thompson.      But another example is Utah with Ed Davis last season. We thought he could replace Favors and it was an absolute mess. Didn't mean it as a shot at any team specifically.
Tristan Thompson Jeff Teague Daniel Theis Javonte Green and semi ojeleye and 2 2nd round picks all for JJ . Or we could keep Thompson and Ojeleye and deal the rest of the players for Fournier Wagner and Kornet.  Ill take the younger guy who might sign with us for the future
Im laughing at the idea that mitch Robinson would get benched for Tristan Thompson or Daniel theis.
Lemme guess Tristan Thompson
"Do you actually know how many good *low cost* (&lt;12 mil.) veteran (&gt;8 years in the league) guys that have gone to Boston the last 5 years? Because I'd be happy to list them out.  Tristan Thompson and Enes Kanter are the closest 2 approximations of MLE vets or older composed role players that Boston has had in the last 5 years and both haven't really been contributors of JJ's caliber *even with him having a bad year this year.* I think it's absolutely fair to say that Boston, a team that has been to the ECF 3 times in the last 4 years, should be an attractive destination to the JJ Reddick types yet they're not."
"&gt; No team is winning a ring with Ibaka as the 3rd option. My point still stands.   This is just a stupid, superficial statement. The Cavs' third and fourth leading scorers in the finals were JR Smith and Tristan Thompson.  &gt; In Game 1-4 both Roberson and Waiters shot ridiculously well. Of course they fell off the cliff in games 5-7.  You're focusing way too much on Waiters and not enough on Roberson. You also don't seem to understand how Roberson's drop off really affected the series.  &gt; Kanter was a huge key if he could stay on the floor. He provided the 3rd efficient scorer they needed. But his defense was so crap that he could only play 12 minutes per game in the series. He was a massive plus against the 67 win Spurs.  Okay. This does not align at all with the made up narrative you were trying to suggest in your original post."
Tristan Thompson cursed them
Nope that'd be Tristan Thompson.  The east runs through him.
"Not disrespecting Harden whatsoever, but if you compare the 2 teams... there’s a huge difference in having as your 2nd best player Chris Paul instead of Kevin Love (who was terrible that season). I’d prefer having guys like PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela over JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson any day of the week"
"Tristan Thompson dated Kylie (admittedly, a Jenner not a Kardashian proper but same diff) while playing on Cleveland.  I know we're talking the wolves not the Cavs, but I'd argue Minneapolis is a much better city than Cleveland by basically any metric except for NBA championships"
"Yeah, just like the Tristan Thompson and Channing Frye over-pays back in Cleveland."
There are 3 important numbers to know:  109 mil: “cap”  133 mil: “luxury tax line”  139 mil: “tax Apron” aka the Hard Cap.  You have the option to go as far ahead of luxury tax as you want and penalties go up- but for the most part you can only resign your own players (this is basically Something called Bird Rights). If you use an exemption to get another player (free agent and not trade for his bird rights) then you get restricted to the the Hard Cap aka the Tax Apron line (the Celtics used the MLE to get Tristan Thompson this year and so they are hard capped). Though if you are above the luxury tax line you can still sign veteran minimum players (Nets and Blake griffin for example). The league set it up for you to basically keep your players and if you go over (so the Warriors are about 40 mill above the tax line and are paying like 80 mill in “taxes” and so that you extra money goes towards the teams below the “luxury tax line” as a reward. Nets and Warriors and all the other expensive big baller teams are funding the rest of the financially responsible teams.   If you are in luxury tax the deeper you go you pay more per dollar over the limit and if you are in luxury tax for 3 out of the past 4 years the. You get put into the repeater tax category and all the luxury tax fines increase and you lose some exemptions
"Eh this has far more to do with a team that is over the cap trading for a player or needing to re-sign one. Happened before with Tristan Thompson. The clippers did the same thing with Morris and Kennard. Shit, Tobias Harris got a max contract solely because they couldn’t afford to lose him and still be over the cap. Hitting free agency with a team over the cap is probably the single best way to get paiddddd as a role player"
The Tristan Thompson strategy.
"Yup, Tristan Thompson."
yes he will get it   he will put up 10/10 and get 13-15M a year  LeBron gets his big men paid ask Tristan Thompson or hell Mozgov
"[Wolves vs 0-17 Sixers, the teams lined up on the wrong sides and had to restart. After 4 quarters of awful basketball, the Sixers get their first win in a thrilling 85-77 final.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/11975239/philadelphia-76ers-minnesota-timberwolves-restart-direction-mishap)  That Cavs/Warriors finals game where the 1st quarter lasted an hour and David West and Tristan Thompson accidentally kissed was pretty terrible too, but at least that was terrible in an entertaining way."
"truth is people are underestimating him, he's like tristan thompson on steroids (maybe little worse on defence) but if you put him on a team with LeBron and AD, he'll be very useful"
"Mozgov, Tristan Thompson both got big contract because of Bron"
Basically needs to be a better version of 2016 Cavs Tristan Thompson. If he commits this is a big pickup
0. Luke Kornet  1. Tatum   2. Brown  3.Kemba  4. Smart  5. Robert Williams  6. Payton Pritchard  7. Tristan Thompson  8. Semi Ojeleye  9. Grant Williams  10. Aaron Nesmith  I didn’t include Fournier or Romeo because they haven’t played for us at all this year or Mo Wagner because he has played like 10 minutes.
"LeBron made Tristan Thompson look like a solid starting C on a championship team. Drummond is in every way better than TT. If he stays down low, AD can also play more on the perimeter which he prefers."
"If you look at the last 20 years of 4th picks, you'd probably take 17/5/3 and 40% on threes - basically Miller's first 10 years - over half of them?  Patrick Williams Deandre Hunter Jaren Jackson Jr Josh Jackson Dragan Bender Kristaps Porzingis Aaron Gordon Cody Zeller Dion Waiters Tristan Thompson Wesley Johnson Tyrese Evans Mike Conley Russell Westbrook Tyrus Thomas Chris Paul Shaun Livingston Chris Bosh Drew Gooden Eddy Curry"

"The Celtics currently have one center on the roster that deserves playoff minutes: Timelord.   Tristan Thompson has been horrible this year, especially on defense, and has no part being a part of any playoff rotation unless he has some sort of miracle turnaround.   Robert Williams is great and is probably better than Drummond, but he’s had health issues in the past and his high energy playstyle means he’s not gonna be playing the crazy high minutes that some players get in the playoffs.  Getting Drummond would be adding a guy to the rotation who can be effective in the playoffs, secure rebounds, get some steals and blocks, score some second chance points, and soak up the non-Williams minutes without being a massive liability like Tristan would be.   Also I’m totally here for the Drummond vs Embiid revenge arc."
"what was super about them?  they couldn’t win without lebron. their defense was awful, and the offense lived and died with lebron and kyrie iso’s to create everything  or was it Love’s elite finals play where he was out played by tristan thompson and jr smith in ‘16?  the only thing super about the Cavs was LeBron and Kyrie being elite on offense."
He got tristan thompson and timofey mozgov big contracts. I think drummond will be ok.
"Just this week he said that Tristan Thompson is in and out of Health and Safety protocols constantly, missing tonnes of games, because he's always partying.  He has been in protocols twice, once now and once a while ago when he was a close contact of Robert Williams when he had it. He had played 36 out of 38 games when Vernon made that claim."
"This has to be the worst offseason of Ainge's tenure, right? Lost Hayward for essentially nothing, signed JEFF TEAGUE who was clearly no longer an NBA player, Tristan Thompson is turning out to be a bad fit, drafted Aaron Neismith who looks completely lost whenever he's on the floor, used none of the draft capital over the past or next few years when he could have moved up a spot or two and gotten Haliburton.  Just awful. Peyton Pritchard is the lone positive."
Having Tristan Thompson on your team will do that 😂
"Dude we traded CJ Miles, Jonas Valuncinuas, Delon Wright, and **an extra** 2024 second rounder for a 34-35 year old Marc Gasol.   I understand our situation was dire given how we were a full out win now mode but that's the difference. Do you think 12' OKC wouldn't have went full out let's go for the ring if we could go back in time?  I don't think teams are grasping how hard it is it get to the Finals or some shit. These players' windows are very limited, if 76ers, the Bucks, or even I'd say Heat (repeating)/Celtics don't reach the Finals in the next few years I'll be the first to say it's the same OKC situation. Deep regrets.  LeBron when he returned back to Cleveland after their Finals run remember how hard Tristan Thompson fought tooth and nail for his extension? Check that shit up right now, 4 months a contract stalemate that included missing training camp.   People probably forget right? I remember people here were giving shit to everyone. Tristan 8.5 points 8 rebounds ain't worth 20M! Tristan Thompson is valuable he can defend all positions! Look at LeBron and his posse helping his buddies get rich and ruining our future! We are screwed if we sign Tristan long term if LeBron leaves! Dan Gilbert is too cheap once again!   Seriously. Prime example of a win-now. Houston fans and media already praised Houston for attempting to go for a win-now mode even against arguably the greatest teams of all time. They seriously capped their future but they were very close and majority agreed it was well worth it.  Lowry is a needle pusher. How many times did Boston fans go on the fence about Danny Ainge not trying to win-now. They had chances to get Paul George/Jimmy Butler remember? Seeing Jimmy Butler's success on Miami would he + Eastern Conference Finals that went 4-3 against LeBron not been a good try in 2018-19?  Trying to protect your future is very important but when you have a realistic shot at the title there should no question you go for it."
"Yeah, and then that team got gutted during the offseason, and the replacements (Teague and Tristan Thompson) were clear downgrades from Kanter and Hayward"
I think the Celtics will be fine but I also think they need to make a trade. Like if they can add Harrison Barnes(1st and Langford for him) they have a shot at coming out of the east   Maybe trade Tristan Thompson as well for a bench piece in a separate deal
trez is more jj hickson than tristan thompson  thompson and trez really aren't all that similar
Aka Tristan Thompson on steroids
montrezl is basically peak tristan thompson for lebron.
"Agree with those areas, I have to shout out Toronto area too: Wiggins, SGA, Cory Joseph, Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray, NAW, RJ Barrett, + more who made it (Tyler Ennis, Thon Maker, Anthony Bennett, Nik Stauskas, + more)  And future's looking good too, specifically a kid named Elijah Fisher"
Also quite overlooked is the Bogut injury and how well Tristan Thompson played in those last games so well he got paid about $100million for it I hope he send Bogut a Christmas card every year for that
"&gt;He’s been playing 20 minutes a game for the past while  What's ""the past while""? How many games is that?  &gt;It’s just that we have him as the clear best center, Theis who deserves minutes and is a veteran, and Tristan Thompson who also is a veteran center who deserves minutes. That’s exactly why the Celtics are trying to trade Thompson or Theis, they want to make sure Robert has a large amount of minutes because he deserves it.  What does this mean? Why do Theis and TT deserve more minutes if he's so much better? What's stopping y'all from playing him 30+ minutes?"
"He’s been playing 20 minutes a game for the past while. It’s just that we have him as the clear best center, Theis who deserves minutes and is a veteran, and Tristan Thompson who also is a veteran center who deserves minutes. That’s exactly why the Celtics are trying to trade Thompson or Theis, they want to make sure Robert has a large amount of minutes because he deserves it."
Tristan Thompson was on his way to developing one but then he joined the Celtics. Dunno if he even tries anymore.
"Canada: Only other country with an NBA team   Canadian players: SGA, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Lu Dort, Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, and a few others.   Nash the best Canadian player ever is also the only Canadian HC currently. Coaching the Nets who are obviously one of if not the most interesting team in the NBA right now."
"It's more of an underachieving roster than a G-League caliber roster. Their depth really isn't good at all and they have basically nothing on the wings outside of the Jays. Also when Timelord doesn't play Tristan Thompson hasn't been all that great and it kinda creates a hole at the center position.   Also none of their draft picks outside the two stars and maybe Timelord have really hit. Pritchard  is a nice piece and Williams looks good in spurts but both are bit players. Then you have Langford, Carsen Edwards, Semi Ojeleye, Tremont Waters, haven't really worked and if you go farther back and look at picks like Yabusele, Ante Zizic, Jabari Bird, Demetrius Jackson, Abdel Nader, those guys never really worked out. Rozier was a good pick but for the most part they haven't drafted well over the last 5 or 6 years outside of getting the two stars. It's hard when your drafting late in the first round every year but we've seen teams able to get valuable rotation pieces in the 20s where the Celtics have more or less whiffed."
"Tristan Thompson wasn't lying, the east runs through the cavs so he threw the game for the greater good."
"I don't know dude, does it really matter tho? In the end, a rebound is a rebound, contested or not. If you're questioning about rebounding ability, I would ask you this in return: assuming you think that Westbrook's rebounds are ""stat padded"" or ""gifted"" to him by the offense, why wouldn't there be a lot more players around the league doing as he does? The fact of the matter is that his team knows and he knows that he's not the best shooter but he's an elite rebounding guard, so the best plan for the offense is for him to grab the rebound and push the ball while shooters space the floor around him.   Centers and big men will always have an inherent advantage in rebounding due to their size and relative proximity to the basket when a shot is taken, and it's honestly incredible that Russ has averaged a triple double every season since his MVP year (I think, correct me if I'm mistaken though).   &gt;If you saw '10 rebounds' on the stat sheet, then looked them all up and 5 of them were of the type above, would your appraisal of the rebound performance change?  Honestly? Not really. Getting the rebound is a pretty nice feat in itself. That's why everyone clowned Tristan Thompson for getting outrebounded by 6'3 Steph Curry in the finals.  At the end of the day, rebounding is about getting clear possession of the ball, either to stop another shot attempt by the opposition or to give your team another. That's what it all boils down to. Contested, uncontested, ""stat padded,"" it really makes no difference to me."
"There’s no excuse for that. He coulda started Tatum at the 4, Ojaleye at the 4. Grant Williams at the 4.  Anyone at the 4. But you don’t not on any circumstance start Daniel thies and Tristan Thompson together for 30+ games"
"It's not about his players, it's about the lack of adjustment that kills him. He doesn't want to draw from his bench like more successful teams do. He does well in the regular season despite injuries because he's forced to use other players, case in point was last year in Indiana when everyone except TJ Warren missed games. He pushed guys like Justin Holiday, Aaron Holiday, and TJ McConnell and the team won more games with their injured roster than in his two other years.  His problem is that when team rotations invariably get tighter in the playoffs, he refuses to adjust. Doug McDermott and Aaron Holiday barely got any run even when the team shat out 8-12 point quarters against Boston. He continued to start the undersized and already on his way out Monta Ellis against the Cavs. Sabonis was killing the Cavs in limited minutes in 2018 and he refused to pull Myles Turner, who was getting dominated by Tristan Thompson in Game 7. In that same game, LeBron sat for a long time in the 4th and he refused to put Oladipo in."
"Huh? Lol Nah this ain’t it.   Tatum and Brown ALONE should be better than a 7/8 seed. Then add in Kemba, Marcus smart, Fournier, Tristan Thompson… The GM has done his job this ain’t no G league roster they are more then equipped. They just got hit with injuries   Where Ainge deserves criticism is for not capitalizing on their crazy amount of assets and folding them into another star and making Boston a juggernaut. They’ve had like 5 mid to late round first round picks which have turned out to exactly what mid first rounders do, role players. (Grant Williams, Langford, nesmith, Pritchard) . That’s way too many guys like that on 1 team, especially one trying to win now. Also let Kyrie out the building, Hayward walked for free, didn’t go after harden, AD, etc  But not becoming a juggernaut is a far cry from ‘they have a g league roster’. They have finals caliber talent just injuries have hurt and yea coaching. I made a thread very early wondering why/how the Celtics were starting two traditional centers in 2021 I was utterly baffled. That’s 100% on the coach.  https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ltd2ca/waitthe_celtics_start_theis_and_tristan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"
"Brad at halftime: ""Y'all are so trash, I want you to know I'm talking to you, so I'ma say your name then I'm gonna call you trash. Jayson Tatum, you trash. Tristan Thompson, trash. Grant Williams, believe me when I say this, you are trash."""
"I'm fairly optimistic about next season as long as they identify things that **were** in their control and correct how they went wrong (obviously most of this team's problems were out of their control, i.e. highest-affected by covid and lots of injuries).  If the Celts could somehow shake down into the lottery and against all odds get a decent pick, theoretically a lineup of:  Kemba / Smart / Jaylen / Jayson / Timelord  all healthy is a top-5 starting lineup in the East, if not higher. Then a bench of:  Pritchard / Fournier / Nesmith / Grant Wiliams / Tristan Thompson  is an average bench, especially if Pritchard and Nesmith can build on impressive rookie campaigns. All that plus a solid 1st round pick could lead to a season where the Celts are competing for the East in a real way."
"We traded Theis, Rob got turf toe, and now we're left with Tristan Thompson."
"celtics center rotation is grant williams and tristan thompson, dont have to look much further why the celtics have been bad"
We aren't driving because they stopped calling fouls and Tristan Thompson can't get offensive rebounds
"The advanced and counting stats point is true, but it still doesn't account for the context of how the Cavs were defending Golden State. The Cavs sold out to attempt to stop Curry and Klay and basically sent no help to KD, even on switches. The end result was seeing KD score a ton of his buckets one-on-one against guys like JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and George Hill, which wouldn't have been possible without Curry as his PG. Obviously KD gets credit for having a great offensive series, but the situation that lead to his success was partially dependent on Curry.   IMO Durant still deserved FMVP both times, but it's not as clear cut as you'd think just based on the offensive numbers."

"No there are a few international players as well that don't fit the NBA mold but for some reason do phenomenal on the world stage. Case #1 Pick Anthony Bennett, didn't do well in the NBA but plays well on FIBA stage. Phillip Scrubb and his brother are good.  But this year:  PG // SG // SF // PF // C  Murray // Shai // RJ // Boucher // Olynyk  Brooks // Wiggins // Dort // Clarke // Tristan Thompson   Cory Joseph // Trey Lyles // Alexander-Walker // Dwight Powell // Anthony Bennett   I mean this is a grezzy team. US is a monster will take years to compete with, but sold lock for top 4 in the world with this roster. Even 2nd is possible."
"You are joking right? We are all in awe and love our NBA players. Especially RJ, Wiggs, Shai, Dort, Murray, Olynyk, Birch, Boucher, Brooks, Cojo, Dwight Powell, Tristan Thompson, Clarke, Naw.  Don't worry, we keep an eye on all our sons. They all have our love and support, esp RJ, Shai, Dort, Murray and Boucher."
Thanks Tristan Thompson!!!
Tristan Thompson is that you?
Lebron Draymond Tristan Thompson Kawhi Curry Iguodala  Love Durant
Isiah Thomas and Wilt Chamberlain are sitting at a whole 1% more TS% than Westbrook in the playoffs and Tristan Thompson is in the top 20 all time for playoff TS%. That stat somehow went from being undervalued to massively overvalued in a short time lol.
Not too upsetting but I really thought Tristan Thompson would be a cav lifer.

"Danny Ainge, the guy who assembled the roster of Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Kemba Walker (who was coming off a starting all-star season when we signed him), Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, Evan Fournier, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, and Tristan Thompson? one of the most solid and YOUNG 9-man rotations in the league? there are problems with this team, and none of them are Ainge"
I still find the picture of [David West and Tristan Thompson](https://imgur.com/gallery/f27bp) in the NBA finals absolutely hilarious. The refs in the background really make it.
"The problem is our starting 5 is really all we have going for us.  Kemba/Smart/Brown/Tatum/Timelord is a arguably a top 5 starting 5 in the NBA, but our supporting cast stops and ends with Tristan Thompson and Evan Fournier. It's not completely awful, especially with the addition of Fournier, but the rest of our bench players are young and not ready to carry the load off the bench. Pritchard is maybe the closest, but he's still learning.  I'm not a doomer by any means, I think we have one of, if not the, brightest future of any team in the NBA, certainly in the eastern conference, but the fact of the matter is out role-players are a lot weaker than other contenders this year, and it would take all of our best 7 guys staying healthy throughout the entire playoffs, as well as an 8th/9th guy off the bench (one of Grant Williams, Payton Pritchard, Romeo Langford, and Aaron Nesmith) making a big leap *in a playoff push* for us to really and truly contend."
"they are certainly high variance, my worry is that everything after the Jays is a question mark.  Will we get good Kemba consistently?  Will we get good Smart for long enough?  Will Time Lord be able to stay on the court?  Will Tristan Thompson ever move his fat ass out of drop coverage on PnR (that might work against Philly but as we saw vs. the Blazers on Sunday that's a recipe for disaster against a team with players that can shoot off the dribble)?  Will Evan Fournier get in a groove?  Will the young kids give the Celtics anything consistently?  Each one of these questions could pan out in the Celtics favor (except for Tristan Thompson giving them anything, fuck that guy), but to get enough of them to break right for Boston collectively seems like a long shot to say the least.    I'll be happy to be wrong here and I don't think that if they come up short it's a referendum on Stevens, Ainge or the Jays.  If anything they're ahead of schedule still and have overachieved recently which has created artificially high expectations.  Progress isn't always linear, hopefully we can see some signs of life from the Celtics down the stretch and figure out a plan to make some tweaks this summer."
"I am basing it off their play this year, which has been far worse &amp; much less consistent than at any point in the last 5 years.  Also, their roster construction makes things difficult for them this year, particularly when it comes to Embiid.  Tristan Thompson is garbage in general and too small to really bother Embiid, and Robert Williams is way too small and fouls too much (this has been a problem for the Celtics this year vs. Philly).  Also with the way Philly is playing this year &amp; their roster construction, it's not nearly as easy to swarm Embiid with more shooters on the court.  And there's no more Brett Brown on the other sideline to drag Philly down.   I expect the Celtics to play hard &amp; fight, they're just significantly undermanned this year compared to previous seasons where they made deep runs."
"Yeah, this comment chain made me think I was tripping lol. Had to double check that Drummond led the league in rebounding 4 times while getting over a steal and a block a game.  Idk how much 'empty stats' matter it's not like Tristan Thompson was a huge winner without Bron lol"
I do want this sub to calm down a little before we see Drummond play more than 2 games with Bron.   Bron literally got Tristan Thompson $80m
"I honestly believe in Drummond because I believe and respect guys who proved something in the league whether it is big or small.  Still guy is extremely disappointing from what the good flashes I have seen from him in his young days and considering where he is now. I relate as a fan of similar players who aren't well liked by fans, but he has to give really better effort on both ends and play smarter if he wants to get the respect he wants.  I think Lakers should've not went for him. I think they picked him up because they feared the Nets would've taken him, but tbh I think Nets would've still rather went for Aldridge than Drummond.   Still Drummond's ego is really wasting the talent he has. All this guy has to do is literally play like a better Tristan Thompson and just get boards while playing solid defense. I do think his defense isn't so bad, but he does seem to play lax. Guy can be playing like Rodman if he had that motor in him."
"Bro to me the way he jammed it in made it obvious it wasn't a goal tend. He had it in his hand first, then a split second later jammed it into the rim and pushed it in. IF it was over the cylinder it would not have wedged with the front of the rim. Unless he had crazy hops and got completely above it and wedged it down. But we're talking about tristan thompson here."
"Not exactly the answer to your question, but...  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best."
"He is underrated i would take him before Baynes, Robin Lopez, Tristan Thompson"
"When I was in college at BC, we had this dude Craig Smith, who ended up getting drafted by the Wolves and stuck around for a bit.  He was weird, because his mechanics looked horrendous, and he would practically throw the ball at the rim, but they would go in at a surprisingly high rate.   Tristan Thompson reminds me of that."
currently it's Tristan Thompson.  All time probably Ricky Davis although you can make a better case for it being Kyrie Irving than you can for the world being flat

"Dude I have never heard anyone ever argue 8ppg on 36% shooting argued like that. For your third best scorer that is a joke. Also +/- numbers there mean almost nothing. Cmon dude that’s not even Rodney Hood numbers. He was the teams 5th option behind Tristan Thompson. Was he playing all NBA defense? Because he is there to play all nba offense, and rebound like a mf. Not be Draymond Green without passing on offense. He played smart sure but like I would take PJ Tucker over that. And that dude doesn’t account for a max contract.idk who Kev thinks he is gonna help"
So when does Tristan Thompson get off the court?
"Tristan Thompson couldn’t breathe without getting a foul called on him and it completely took him out of the game. As you said it’s not why we lost, our horrendous shooting and perimeter D took care of that for us, but the refs were god awful.   Bazley also got a few calls by just running to the basket and flailing once he realized he was screwed."
"Tristan Thompson averaged more points per game than Kevin Love in the 2016 finals.  If it wasn't for ""The Stop"", Klove wouldn't have even been a positive player for the championship he did win."
You don't agree that if a teams third highest paid player played better than 9/7/1 on 36/26/70 shooting with 7/3/2 attempts that wouldn't help the team as a whole play better? Dude got outscored by Tristan Thompson.
I’m pretty sure it stands for Tristan Thompson but you may be right
"""Effective immediately, I am banning the Kardashian family **for life** from any association with Tristan Thompson or the NBA"""
Tristan Thompson was never married.  It's easy to cast stones from our position where the majority of us rely on a partner to create a financially stable environment to raise children. Most married people would see a change in lifestyle were they to divorce.   The calculus is different for rich people.  They aren't financially bound the same way others are.   Not sure why this is so hard to understand.
"&gt;It's even more NBA related than most of /new  that's demonstrably untrue. tristan thompson cheating on his girlfriend has nothing to do with the nba. nephews posting lowe-effort hypotheticals that get removed in 5 mins can be annoying, but they're nba related."
"All the contenders have good bigs now, if you don't have anyone who can match up with Jokic, AD, Embiid, Ayton, Gobert, etc... you're going to struggle in a lot of matchups.    When the Warriors were killing people with smallball they were going against guys like Capela, Tristan Thompson, Steven Adams, not world beaters."
He is to Philly fans what Tristan Thompson is to us
"&gt; Having a solid veteran around  He hasn't been a ""solid vet"" for years. They'd have been better off just keeping Tristan Thompson around of ""champion vet presence"" - at least he plays hard."
Yo your point stands but I’ve also seen Tristan Thompson put the clamps on Steph.
"The Brampton legend bro low key you were kinda disrespectful but it's cool. Honestly I think Brandon Clarke, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, and Khem Birch is a solid front court. Olynyk game is much better suited for international basketball, and I'm excited to see how Boucher performs in that setting too. You'd think his insane blocking ability will reak havoc on less talented role players on some of these international teams.    Dillon Brooks at 6'7 can also slide over to the 4 spot even though he seems to be allergic to rebounding."
"Smart and Kemba have shown their playmaking abilities, along with Jayson.  It is much more gameplan then no playmaker. Jayson is a good playmaker, but not from the point, which Brad has been trying him at recently. The only time the ball is in Kembas hands now is on a catch and shoot or spamming pick and rolls with Tristan Thompson and then just pulling it out.  Marcus has still been good in that aspect, the ball is just in his hands less now so he has less opportunities.  Jaylen is a terrible playmaker and continues forcing shots when he is off, completely icing everyone else out of the game.  Either Brad has no control of these players, or his gameplan is terrible, but either way he has to go."
Tristan Thompson
I swear there entire offense this game and a lot of the year is give it to one of those 3 then iso and make a shot or pass for a 3 or pass tristan thompson for a little hook. And most of it is iso
"If you think founier, rob williams, Tristan thompson is near jordan Clarkson, Joe Ingles, favors, niang, oni I suggest you watch more basketball outside of the Cs..  Rob williams is a very solid bench player. The others are eh"
"How.   Celtics have a 30 ppg scorer, a 26 point per game scorer (who’s really a 28 ppg scorer when we take out the COVID month), a 25 point per game scorer, a 20 point per game scorer, another 20 point per game scorer on 60% true shooting (Fournier) off the bench, and a top 3 most impactful player in the league (according to WS/48) of the bench as well.   This is not to mention Tristan Thompson rebounding and Marcus fucking Smart who’s All Defensive 1st team."
"Celtics depth is fine now (especially if we running an 8 man like the playoffs with Embiid)  Kemba Walker  Marcus Smart  Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Joel Embiid  Evan Fournier  Robert Williams III  Tristan Thompson  That’s 5 people averaging 20 with one averaging 30, another averaging 25, and another also averaging 25"
"Tristan Thompson, perhaps? Make a list of basketball skills and he can't do any of them."
"Yeah, but you guys have been shorthanded all season and are still winning games even with just Kyrie. No shame in a loss here, you guys have a good bench and Tristan Thompson isn't exactly gonna take advantage of your lack of a rim protector."
was actually really disciplined defense there to not foul but it probably woulda been better to send like Tristan Thompson to the line instead of Tatum
Because Tristan Thompson needs another reason to go into health and safety protocols
"Celtics are starting Tristan Thompson, Romeo Langford and Semi Ojeleye. Yuck. enjoy the 1 seed Nets"
"But he's been playing the point the second half of this year? And again, I'd rather have an embiid level center to pair with Tatum than ben simmons with Tristan Thompson."

"Reggie had few playoff highlights that for some reason makes him one of the most overrated players ever (AI is another one). I have no idea how you went on putting Miller over Drexler. I can understand that it is difficult to compare some of the players from different eras, but Reggie and Clyde played in the same era. And Drexler was superior player in every way except shooting. There is no question in my mind who was the better player. Neither had a HoF or second true star in their team, but Drexler pushed his Portland team to the best record in the league and twice to the finals. Drexler was 5 for 5 in game 7s/5s (when best of 5). He upped his game when it was on the line, like when Houston was 2-0 down to Jazz in first round in '95 (exception would be '92 WCF and finals when he was playing with injured knee which needed a surgery after the season). Reggie is remembered from that fourth quarter show against the Knicks but he had a lot of bad elimination games too. He lost all three game 7 contests (against Knicks, Magic and Bulls) and his team was way under .500 in playoff games decided by three points or less or in overtime. Drexler's Blazers teams were 12-5 in playoff games decided by three points or less or in overtime (I can still remember Porter losing the ball against the Pistons when down one and Cliff  Robinson fumbling it against Lakers accounting 2 of those 5). So, I don't think that the ""clutch/playoff player"" image of Miller is exactly well placed.  Drexler's best years were from late 80's until his injury in March '92.  Until that injury he was arguably the best open court player the league has seen. His game was mostly slashing, cutting, posting on smaller players and getting to the boards ie. moving a lot and coming of screens (he averaged 3,7 ORb his best season which would have put him 3rd last season behind Drummond and Tristan Thompson. For example Westbrook's best season is 2,2 ORb. Drexler averaged 2,2 or more for 10 seasons). I personally think that Clyde was way better than Reggie even after his injuries. He was just so much better passer, rebounder and defender. And he was putting up \~20pts seasons even as a 2nd and 3rd option in the Rockets. And one of his biggest strengths, the opposition's fear of him attacking the open court, doesn't even show in stats.  From Bleacher report:  ""Clyde averaged more points on a higher shooting percentage (though Reggie,  of course, took a lot more threes) and averaged twice the rebounds, twice the assists, twice the steals, and three times the blocks while achieving more playoff success and winning a ring. Since nobody would say Reggie was a better defender than Clyde, these facts beg the question. How can anyone say Reggie was a better player than Clyde? ""   [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/333705-clyde-drexler-vs-reggie-miller-head-to-head](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/333705-clyde-drexler-vs-reggie-miller-head-to-head)"

It definitely didn't quite live up to the expectations. Reminds me a bit of when people claimed England had a ""golden generation"" in soccer and they ended up failing to qualify for Euros in their primes..."
"Pretty sure we could match up with the Heat but the top teams are stretches. And contrary to the other guy's assertion Robert Williams is still raw and honestly looks like the same (admittedly good) player he's been his whole career. Just with more minutes this season finally. But he can't handle Giannis or Embiid, and Tristan Thompson would get abused even worse."
"Rob Williams has been our best defender and is on a minutes restriction until the playoffs. Tristan Thompson has been great defensively but hes missed more games due to covid than any player in the league. No one can stop Embiid and Giannis by themself, its a team defense. Rob matches up pretty good with Bam though. Kornet is third string , 10 minutes a night guy split between him grant williams and aparently we are going to run parker in small ball 5 lineups."

Kevin Love played power forward alongside Tristan Thompson. It's not like they didn't play with a defensive big at most times
"2016. Yes KD played bad. Yes Lebron played better. But that doesn’t mean KD had better players.  Russ vs Irving. This is closer than people think. I know I trust Irving more in the clutch than Russ. Imagine if KD had Irving at the end of Game 6 instead of Russ? Did you already forget that it was Irving that made THE SHOT of the 2016 Finals? Come on bro. But lets give the slight edge to Russ.  Love better than Ibaka. Isn’t even close. Love is a multilple time All-Star and All-NBA player that can give you 30 points if you need it. Ibaka never made All Star or All NBA.  Role Players. This is where 2016 Cavs blow the 2016 Thunder out of the water. Dion Waiters? Cleveland dumped him to OKC. Ridiculously inconsistent. Adams can’t shoot beyond 5 feet and can’t be a small ball center. Kanter’s defense is trash makes him unplayable. Morrows defense is trash makes him unplayable. Andre Roberson is literally one of the worse shooters (perimeter player) of all time. Cavs had solid role players like Tristan Thompson, Jefferson, JR, Shump, Frye, and Deladova. Guys you could rely on to play solid defense and hit shots."
It felt like Tristan Thompson lost that many in a row at some point this year
Yea it doesn’t get called unless it’s egregious though. In any game. There were two dudes on edges of the paint. Easy no call. Shit Tristan Thompson spent 8 seconds under the hoop in that Celtics game and no one called it

"I tried to start an MVP chant for Tristan Thompson when I was at a cavs wizards game a few years back. A few people laughed, nobody joined in sadly"
"&gt; First loss, we had no kemba, smart, or theis. Jaylen brown played point guard in a lineup with Tatum (struggling with coming back from covid), Javonte Greene, Semi Ojeleye, and Tristan Thompson. We played against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela and still only lost by 8.   Fair, but we were missing Hunter and Bogi - two starters. You can argue Smart/Walker are more important sure.    &gt; Next loss was the second game of a back to back on the road having played four games in six days. You were also coming off a back to back but hadn’t had such a condensed schedule. We had just played the Mavericks and you had just played the Cavs. Tatum was having fatigue issues and scored 13 points on 4/20 which I doubt will happen when we play you again.    This is honestly just kind of excuses. That's literally your schedule   &gt; we had Kemba who scored 28 points on 62.5/62.5/100 which would have made him the highest scoring player in either of the two losses.   This is literally not even true: Trae had 40 and Tatum had 35 in the first game. Trae had 31 in our loss. Trae had 33 in the 3rd game and Gallo had 38"

Send him to Tristan Thompson camp
"Team Canada is looking distressingly stacked with NBA players too, although I'm not sure who has confirmed 100% yet. Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, RJ, CoJo, Khem, Wiggins, Olynyk, Trey Lyles... If I'm their teams' coaches, especially  the guys who played into this postseason, I'm worrying about the damage to their bodies by the end of the summer. It's all just been too intensive since the restart last season."
Isn't rodman like Tristan Thompson from the cavaliers?. Guy was an amazing rebound guy and that's what they used him for. Idk how you replace him exactly because the things he was good at he was very good at.
"Tristan Thompson had some sort of consecutive games played streak record, didn't he? (Maybe it was the Cavs franchise record or something)"
That's just not true. JR Smith and Tristan Thompson stepped up big time and got nice paydays out of that 1 series. And the rest of the team contributed to exceptional team defense against one of the greatest offenses ever. And Ty Lue deserves credit as well. Just because they aren't flashy names like Lebron and Kyrie doesn't mean it wasn't a team effort.
Kevin Love has never appeared.  Averaged less PPG and total points in 2016 finals than Tristan Thompson.
He's probably getting that Tristan Thompson contract
"Yes because you traded your defensive anchor mid season. 5 is by far the most defensive player, and the only position where defense is statistically shown (and logically obvious) to be more important than offense. I'm a Cavs fan and LOL and paying or playing Tristan Thompson, he is ass.  Draymond is more important than Brown and Wiggins combined. So this OP is just a pointless, feeling based circle jerk.  Getting rid of Ainge was fantastic, no sarcasm there."
Yup. Def remember Tristan Thompson dominating the offensive glass
"Ya exactly this. LeBron gets a lot of credit for 2015 for taking two games off the Warriors with Delly, Mozgov, and Tristan Thompson all starting. Losing this series while putting up a good fight would still look good for KD."
"I would like another center not named Tristan Thompson. No more tiny guards from the draft. I don't care about their shooting numbers, they won't even be allowed to touch the ball in important games. Another SF/PF and some veterans. A Jeff green type that isn't Jeff green because the fourth time will not be the charm."
"Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, &amp; nets pick"
"Kyle Korver, Jr Smith, Tristan Thompson, Channing Frye, Bogut ... All serviceable role players literally the same as the warriors and nets"
"Salary earnings = actual basketball Ability??   So, was Tristan Thompson better than Steph Curry in 2016??"
"the question was asked with that specific phrasing because tristan thompson had literally just made a comment like a day or two earlier praising lebron for being a father-like role model leadership presence on a team with a bunch of guys younger than him or some shit, which never gets brought up when people endlessly circlejerk over this clip..  she was basically trying to get kyrie's take on that comment and see if he felt similarly  the reporter didnt just come out of left field claiming he was kyrie's LeDaddy"
It's Tristan Thompson all over again.
eh its lebrons last few years. if they cant improve the roster elsewhere and the money is just wasted im sure lebron would rather overpay someone than just lose him for nothing. look at the tristan thompson contract for example.
Rudy Gobert just a taller Tristan Thompson
"I don’t think Thanasis is a problem for the league, as he is also a player and his salary is in the cap. I guess it is not incredibly rare for NBA teams to make deals for dudes who are close to superstars. LeBron publicly strong arming Cavs to re-sign Tristan Thompson, Deandre Jordan being close with KD and Kyrie at Nets come to mind instantly."
They oddly resemble Tristan Thompson (minus the beard) and David West from this angle too.
Curry outrebounding Tristan Thompson that series was so damn funny like yeah we know TT's just an average center but still
"East runs through Cleveland, West runs through Joe Ingles - Tristan Thompson maybe"
"the could trade Pat Bev, Kennard, Zubac &amp; Rondo for Kemba Walker &amp; Tristan Thompson.  Kemba was an all-star last year..."
"Celtics should protect: Tatum, Brown, Time-Lord, Smart, Nesmith, Pritchard, Langford, Grant Williams.  If an expansion team want to do the Celtics a favor and take Kemba or Tristan Thompson, more power to 'em"
Fair.. but imo jaylen draws the toughest assignment.. And they have to make up for Kembas shortcomings.   Once time lord becomes the starter ft should alleviate some back end concerns that Tristan “I can’t defend pick and roll or block shots” Thompson provided.   And yes Jaylen is not as good in a team defensive concept but that’s because of weaknesses in the team unit imo.  If you’re gonna go small with Tatum at the 4 you need an eraser at 5
That would be an interesting situation because one of the reasons the Cavs couldn't put talent around Lebron was that he made them overpay his buddies on the team. I remember Tristan Thompson getting a ridiculous contract out of it. I would wonder if he'd learned his lesson there and not force them to overpay Schroeder.
"Speaking of Al Horford, back when he was good in the Celtics, Tristan Thompson used to lock him up in the playoffs every year."
Isnt Tristan Thompson a starter?
Yes because Tristan Thompson is better than Giannis
"It's tough to find anything that works for both sides.  His contract is 2 more years (1 guaranteed year + PO in 2022-2023), it makes the most sense to play out next season with him and then see what the Celtics can do when he's on an expiring deal.  The only trade that could make sense would be a deal with the Clippers if they decide they need a better PG (yes, Kemba is better than Reggie Jackson, Rondo &amp; Pat Bev).  You can get there with Kennard, Rondo &amp; Pat Bev's deal.  If I am the Celtics I am also looking to get Zubac included in the deal and moving Tristan Thompson to the Clippers.  I am not sure how much that deal excites either side, so again it's probably still more likely that Kemba plays for the Celtics next year and then the team takes another look when he's on an expiring deal in 2022."
"AD was never going anywhere but LA.  Kemba clearly saw no problem with IT.  Shit, Tristan Thompson signed and he's a Klutch guy, so that casts even further doubt that AD (also Klutch) really would've cared about that.  Likely more just AD's dad taking a pot shot at the Celtics.  &gt; Wasn’t OKC also confident they were going to keep Durant? Sounds to me like no one had a clue were he was going.  It was down to Warriors and Celtics - nobody thought he was staying except OKC fans in understandable denial.  Celtics were damn close by all accounts, including having him spend a weekend in the Hamptons with Tom Brady."
"Hows Canada Rank?  RJ, Murray, Dort, Shai, NAW, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, Kelly O, Brooks, Boucher, Powell, Brandon Clarke"
Gobert come playoff time is about as effective as Tristan Thompson
"&gt;he’s worth way more than the MLE  I mean, not really?  Did Trez have an above average season, yes.  But 1) fans discount defense in favor of offensive stats and 2) fans also don't seem realize the contracts of certain role players.     This year, Jae Crowder, Derrick Favors, Serge Ibaka, and Tristan Thompson all made MLE.  They don't necessarily put up the numbers that Trez does, but they are all likely more reliable players for a playoff team as they aren't huge defensive sieves.  The year before that, Seth Curry, Derrick Rose, and Tyus Jones all signed for roughly the full MLE, while other good players like Bullock, JaMychal Green, Richauln Holmes, and Rodney Hood all signed for less.     Literally every single one of those guys has an argument for being a more useful player for a contending team looking for playoff success than Trez.  Trez absolutely has a market, but it's smaller given his playstyle (which is good for the regular season, but difficult to play in the playoffs).    Saying that he deserve ""way more than MLE"" is silly, because substantially more useful players get MLE all the time."
"Tristan Thompson really justified his entire season with that Game 3 performance, he really seemed so amped for his first playoff game as a Celtic in Boston.  Shame it didn’t translate in Game 4 with the larger crowd."
"It actually goes even further than that.  AD, Gasol, Draymond, Tristan Thompson, Tim Duncan, Chris Bosh, Tyson Chandler....   the closing 5 of almost every NBA champion for the past 10 years has had at least a well above average defensive center. with all being very above average other than thompson"
You mean Tristan Thompson? What’s insane about it? He’s heavier. He doesn’t bring up the ball. He doesn’t need to get back on fast breaks. He doesn’t facilitate. He just camps in the key and gets rebounds.   Different positions and output completely.
"Welp, Clippers fan now.  How Mike fucking Budenholzer let Griffin play like this, when even Brad Stevens, make him look real bad with Jayson Tatum and TRISTAN THOMPSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
50 Ball and 2016 finals tristan thompson showing up
"I dont understand what Bud is trying to do. We literally showed them that you have to stop the role players to have a chance against the Nets, but the Bucks ain't doing anything to stop them. We played Claxton off the floor with Tristan Thompson, and you are telling me that you can't do that with Brook Lopez and Giannis?  Offensively they ain't moving the ball at all, its just bad ISOs over and over again. The Nets have really bad defenders on the floor but I see no one trying to attack Irving or Griffin, and when the double comes they never expect it so its always half a step too slow, allowing the defence to recover."
Oh it’s only UFAs that go to the Lakers under Klutch? Yeah I guess if LaVine does sign there he can join guys like Bledsoe and Clarkson and Draymond and CoJo and Nurkic and JR Smith and Tristan Thompson and Wall in LA.
"Evan Fournier, Jabari Parker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and Semi Ojeleye are the only celtics that have been in the league for more than 2 years. The rest are late 1st and 2nd round picks from the last 2 years. That is the Celtics team without Tatum in the playoffs this year. That team wins 20 games in a season in the East. It is probably a worse version of that Cavs team in 2018-2019 that won 19 games.  Kristaps Porzingas, Tim Hardaway Jr, Dorian Finney-Smith, Boban Marjanović, Josh Richardson, Maxi Kleber, hell, the entire Mavs roster is NBA veterans. A lot of them + veterans. They'd probably win 35 games in the East.   Luka is a fantastic player, but his supporting cast was clearly better than Tatum's this year's playoffs. It's just a fact."
"Yeah that's why those Mozgov, Tristan Thompson, Delly, contracts all paid off.   Maybe you shouldn't talk if you don't know what you're talking about?"
"The wording was questionable, but I think the sentiment was spot on regarding the LeBron quote.  Since his time on the Heat, most every team that LeBron has been on has been LeBron centric rather than team centric. Deserved, probably, given that he's been the best player of the last decade. But Phil is also speaking from the POV of organizational development rather than individual. Building more for long-term success rather than hopping team to team once assets are burned out.  At least with Miami, you had that lynchpin of Pat Riley to keep everything in order. LeBron wanting to ditch Spoelstra early on for example, but Riley reaffirming that ""No, Spo is our guy"". Compared to say Cleveland, where LeBron had no equal in the FO, you could see more of the organizational cracks forming in terms of team chemistry (Kyrie, Love early on), contract issues (Tristan Thompson), etc that weren't really too apparent on the Heat."
Lots of guys play a shit load of minutes as Ironman and then break down suddenly. Klay Thompson and Tristan Thompson come to mind. Harden was also out of shape this year and that puts a huge extra strain on your body. Add on the fact he was ramping up minutes and load a lot with extra weight and less training it’s no wonder he’s been dealing with injury.
Was just going to say so many LA players or players on Miami go by the wayside because they get stuck in their celebrity. Also Tristan Thompson.
Recall when Claxton got clowned by Tristan Thompson lol. Y’all out here acting like he’s a legit big
Tristan fucking Thompson was destroying these dudes on the boards.  Imagine how many Brook &amp; Giannis are getting lmao
If Tristan Thompson looked like an all star against the Nets then I expect Giannis to look like Thanos.
"So in other words, 5 games against a Celtics team who was starting Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier and Tristan Thompson until they had to start Romeo Langford... yuh"
Tristan Thompson is 11th and Anderson Varejao is at 14 lol. Otherwise it's not a bad stat for looking at the league's elite players
"BOS gets: CJ McCollum, Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Richardson, POR 2023 1st, POR 2027 1st, DAL 2025 1st, CLE 2025 2nd  POR gets: Kevin Love, Jaylen Brown, Collin Sexton  DAL gets: Norman Powell, Taurean Prince, Tristan Thompson  CLE gets: Kemba Walker, POR 2025 1st, DAL 2024 2nd  It’s not realistic, nor does it make sense, but here is one."
"Kevin Love is still on the team with a massive contract, playing like trash and being a locker room cancer. LeBron ran Kyrie off, then bounced, every piece of the Kyrie trade was garbage. The 1st round pick from that trade got flipped into Jordan Clarkson and Nance Jr, Clarkson didn't play well in Cleveland. The whole Dwyane Wade in Cleveland bullshit LeBron forced. Demanding specific coaches, etc. The dude came in like a tornado, reorganized the entire team structure, won a championship, and then left everything in shambles and the team's still trying to recover without draft picks or really anything to show for it other than the single title.  The Cavs are having the problems they are because they couldn't develop talent while LeBron was there. He comes in, makes you trade away any existing assets you have so he can bring in his friends, and then leaves your team high and dry without any assets or young talent to recover.  Friendly reminder that LeBron got Tristan Thompson max contract money that he's *still* getting paid. If that doesn't prove to you just how bad he can fuck a team, I don't know what will."
Reminds me of that time Lebron flopped off Tristan Thompson bc he thought it was a Celtics player who made contact. It be your own ppl sometimes lmaooo
"how about Kemba Walker, Tristan Thompson and two 2nds for Pat Bev, Kennard, Rondo &amp; Zubac?  It's an exchange of bad deals and the Clips get to recoup some draft capital.  Kemba fits their timeline contract wise and for as much as he gets shit on by everyone on r/nba is a clear upgrade at point guard for them."
"That’s the entire point I’m making, one or two games in the regular season means nothing. Having a couple of close games without Harden means nothing because there are so many other variables in any single game. With the exception of Shamet, who was the one building a brick factory while we made that run, your role players were already doing well throughout that game. Meanwhile Giannis shot 11/30. The game before that, Kyrie was bad and probably won’t be that bad again very often, while Giannis was great but also shot 4/8 from three which probably won’t happen too often.  I’m not saying this is some guaranteed win for us, I’m saying the idea that missing Harden in a couple of close losses means you’ll clean up when he is there is stupid, and the Nets have exploitable weaknesses we already knew about (and showed in the playoffs via Tristan Thompson crashing the glass ) that Harden doesn’t help with."
"Two things.   1. I don't think you can adequately assess the median from his website as there's no minute requirement. his overall chart includes people that played a few minutes and only a few games. Again, without additional descriptive information, you're just guessing at numbers.   2. It's important to set descriptive ranges (appropriate value for an all star, starter, good bench player/6th man, bench player, end of bench/replacement), because teams require all of those guys. Even using your median that includes everyone that touched the court this season, that doesn't mean everyone who falls below that median was actually a net negative. Guys like Gary Trent, Tristan Thompson, Jaren Jackson, Terance Man, etc. all played key roles for their teams. It is essential to assess impact relative to their position. So was Melo's impact great for a starter? (What most advaned stats usually set 0 at) No. Was it average for a regular bench player/replacement? Yea (tends to be around -2). Considering the impact does he have valuable skills at his position Yea.   But like I said, most people just see the negative and assume that means net negative/detrimental to on court play, and that is not what those numbers mean. As you can see on that chart, it's basically led to an environment in which fans believe the majority of players are hurting their team, when all it means is they're not starting quality (which is very restrictive)."
"I am not a LeBron stan but this post is so bad and relies on zero context for anything and is solely made to shit on LeBron.   &gt;2007 - Lebron’s Cavs finished 2nd in the East with a modest tally of 50 Wins, which would have placed them 6th in the West. They got dominated and swept 4-0 in the finals.  His team was terrible with the second best player being Boobie Gibson. The fact that team makes the finals at all is an achievement and he loses to the best team in the league and one of the best of decade.   &gt;2011 - Lebron forms arguably the first super team of the 21st century and sets precedent. Heat have a pretty easy run to the final, but again get dismantled by western opposition and lose 4-2. Lebron averages 17.7 ppg and is mostly pretty bad.  This is the only outright bad thing of his career I would not really try to defend it. Other then saying that Mavs team does get horribly under rated as we only look at this series as the LeBron collapse.   &gt;2012 - Lebron now in his prime at 27, wins his first ring against a very young OKC team 4-1 in a lockout shortened season.  He was awesome, and beat an amazing young team. Lockout or not great win.   &gt;2013 -heat narrowly win a 4-3 ECF series vs a young and beatable pacers team. Heat again narrowly win the finals after a series saving shot by ray allen. Series win be characterised as being won by the roleplayers. Most accounts say Spurs were the better team and it was theirs to lose.   That Pacers team was fantastic and built really well. Let's not forget the years on Roy Hibbert being a defensive beast at the rim. Also LeBron I believe dominated Game 6,7 of that Spurs series and clawed them back in game 6. So ya Allen hit the shot, but they were in that game cause of LeBron.   &gt;2014 - Heat are again taken to 7 by a young and beatable Pacers team. An ageing spurs and late 30s Tim Duncan Don’t make the same mistake as last year and dismantle the heat 4-1 quite embarrassingly. Puts last years narrow loss into perspective.  That Spurs team was built perfectly. The aging Dwade along with a poor supporting cast built so much stress on LeBron. I do agree this series should go longer considering his greatness, but that Spurs team was just amazing.   &gt;2015 - lebron leaves Heat after 4 years and goes to Cavs with the intention of forming another super team with Kyrie and others. Cavs get a modest 52 wins, which would have put them 7th in the west. A good series vs a much better team and Lebron’s cavs lose 4-2.  KLove, and Kyrie were injured in the finals. Hard to beat a great Warriors team that won 67 games, when your second best player is Tristan Thompson. Iggy got the finals MVP for just guarding LeBron. This similar to 2007 I don't see how anyone can shit on him for.   2016 - another 4-3 win after big momentum shift due to Kyrie irving heroics and other roleplayers. Again by most accounts, Similar to 2013 Spurs series, it was GSWs to lose and they did.  He was amazing in this series. I don't see how anyone can really take coming back from a 3-1 lead in the finals against a person, but you somehow did lmao.   &gt;2017 - similar to 2014, GSW made it right and dismantled Cavs for a 4-1 victory. Putting into perspective last years loss 2018 - 4-0 GSW, 2nd sweep of his career in finals  Lumped these together, cause for the love of god look at that Warriors team. Hard to beat it. Especially in 2018 without your second best player.  &gt;2019 - no AD, Lakers don't qualify for the playoffs.  He was injured and that Lakers team was meh. They make the playoffs if he's healthy all year, but that team was not good enough to be anything more then a second round exit at most.    &gt;2020 - Beat the Miami heat 4-2 for his 4th ring. Led by example and played well throughout the series, massively supported by AD.  Ad was awesome, but so was LeBron. A ring is a ring. Jordan needed Scottie to be great. The fact AD was also great does not take away from his greatness.   &gt;2021 - AD injured, Lebron led Lakers are a first round exist.  Injury riddled season. The suns were a better team possibly even without the injuries.   I personally think LeBron is the best player ever. But, I have 0 reason to argue that Jordan is not the best. You can fully think what you want. But, let's not just shit on him for minimal reasons without adding context. If you switched their careers we'd be doing the same thing to Jordan. Just look at these players as great."
"yeah cause Lebron's teammates were JR Smith, Mozgov, Tristan Thompson, and Iman Shumpert lol  EDIT: How could I have forgotten the Curry stopper Delladova"
Tristan Thompson lmao
"""Tristan Thompson"" and ""young stars"" should not be in the same sentence lol"
Is it fair to say being on a Lebron team is bad for player development? I guess you could say Kyrie developed under him but did anyone else? Does Tristan Thompson count?
Kyrie? JR? Caruso? Tristan Thompson? U smoking crack?  EDIT: Mario chalmers lmaoooo. The list is so long.
Except Lebron isn't going to go to bat for Dennis like he did for Tristan Thompson. Everyone knew that the Cavs got fleeced when they resigned TT in that deal but Lebron forced their hand and they had to appease the king.
He knows he can get more because the Lakers are capped out and can't replace him if he leaves. Same thing Tristan Thompson did.
"The thing is I don’t think Jaylen wants to go back to just spot up shooting. He keeps improving and was an All-Star, and when Hayward left he had to fill that role of facilitating. I think he’s going to continue to want the ball and not just stand in the corner. Which is fine, but if you notice who’s doing catch and shoot, most of the guys just aren’t consistent enough. Smart has never been a great shooter, and all the other guys are too young and haven’t developed their shot as much. There’s flashes of it but we need guys who are knockdown and proven shooters because Marcus Smart, Grant Williams, Semi Ojeleye and Romeo Langford missing open 3’s is taking points off the board. Smart at least has value outside of his shooting deficiencies, but they could really use a guy like Luke Kennard, Tim Hardaway Jr, or Duncan Robinson. Fournier takes so many off balance shots I wish he wasn’t trying to do so much with the ball (like he had to in Orlando). I think next year will be better for him if they re-sign him  I don’t think they need a stretch big (although it doesn’t hurt) but rather a guy that’s great on the glass so he can pull down boards and go back up with it, or kick it out to open guys when defenses fall apart. Robert Williams is great at this and is a good passer, Tristan Thompson would be great at this but every time he pulls down a rebound he gets tunnel vision and almost always goes back up with it"
"They compare very similarly really. Your problem is you are basing too much on the finals vs the 1st round instead of comparing the 4 teams in question. You need to look at each series in a vacuum when comparing luka vs lebron carrying their team.   Steph, klay did not have a good series vs the cavs in the finals. Steph was playing like pandemic p for the first 2 and a half games. Klay avg 15 ppg. That didn't have anything to do with lebron it was a mix of them choking and the defense of delly and Tristan thompson. The warriors won because of their superior depth and steph played much better towards the end of the series. There was no one on the warriors playing like kawhi has in this series.  I'm not arguing luka is carrying more than lebron did that series and I give lebron the edge for doing it on the biggest stage, but you are sloughing it off as not close, maybe you're a lebron fanboy?"
I was hoping the Celtics would trade Tristan Thompson but if they keep him maybe he can recruit Giannis
Congrats for shutting down Tristan Thompson. That was a real test.
"Every-time I bring up this point I usually get downvoted lol. When Curry was struggling to breakdown Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love, two bigs he usually abuses for fun, it was clear he wasn't close to his best. Even Iguodala was not fully healthy. That doesn't take anything away from the Cavs comeback, but people never bring this up, but always want to talk about how the Warriors were lucky that all the guards for the teams they faced in the 2015 playoffs were injured. And they will say Kevin Love and Kyrie, like Kevin Love has ever had a great series against the Warriors. They are a terrible match-up for him."
Kevin Love is usually shit against the Warriors. I bet anything they would have rather faced Love than Tristan Thompson and Mozgov.
Tristan Thompson robbed the Cavs because of Bron.
Would've been a great move for them until he trades away Jaylen Brown to make space to re-sign Tristan Thompson
I don’t want to be an agent. Rich Paul had the easiest path to being a sports agent ever. Lebron says I want to be paid this amount and every team goes okay. I want Tristan Thompson to be on my team and get paid. NBA team says okay. Any person who wants to be an agent and has any skill at all would being able to do what rich Paul has done in his position.
"Tristan Thompson has actually, somehow, been pretty effective. I'd scratch that one out"
The celtics are a couple pieces from being a good team. Jaylen/Tatum really were good this year they’re just getting better. They need someone who actually has size. Robert Williams is 6 foot 8 starting at center. Tristan Thompson just isn’t the answer as a starter(i love his energy off the bench). That small ball stuff was not working.
"As a Cavs fan, Mo Williams, Daniel Gibson, Tristan Thompson, Mozgov, &amp; Dellavedova. The counting stats don’t change much, but all were much better players with LeBron.  To me he doesn’t make star players stand out more, because they have to sacrifice some to him, but his impact allows role players to excel in a role rather than being near unplayable without. It’s a sub 35% 3pt shooter all of a sudden becoming a 40+% guy, just look how guys like Mo Williams or Chalmers shooting fell off a cliff the year LeBron left."
"&gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  What trades should he have made? Especially with those picks? And bear in mind we would have to use Horford/Hayward/Irving as matching salary if we're trading for some star on a big contract. Possibly Smart + a bunch of other players for someone with a smaller salary but those trades are tough during the season.  And there's a lot of hindsight bias. Those Kings and Grizzlies picks ended up in the middle of first round but they could have been much better. The Kings had their best season in ~15 years. If things went a little worse for them that pick could have been Zion or Morant.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  As opposed to trading them mid-season? Though if the rumors of the Hayward-Turner trade are true then yeah, Ainge should have done that deal.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  Again, what else are we doing if we don't sign Kemba? And we had to use that cap space. The following year Brown's big extension was kicking in.  &gt;Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt;Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   Yep, those are not great.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  True but drafting in the middle of first round is a crap shoot. And Ainge's overall draft performance is amazing."
"Copy/pasting this from /u/_irongiant_'s comment in the Celtics sub, just to provide context to the negative things he's done over the past two years.  &gt; In my eyes this is a much needed move. Ainge had a great stretch as a GM until 2019 but since then it's just been blunder after blunder.  &gt; Coming away with Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Grizzlies pick for anything  &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  &gt; So many blunders in the span of 2 years has left this team asset-less and in a bad spot. 99% of GMs would have been fired over these moves/non-moves, so Ainge would be doing us a favor by stepping down.  Granted, I don't agree with the ""we drafted this guy instead of this better player"" logic just because that's all hindsight, but all the other reasons are valid."
When we did that trade for Capela I was so shocked that a team closer to contention didn't outbid us. He would be so good on the Celtics and instead they signed Tristan Thompson in the off-season.
"You can pretty easily argue all of those points.  &gt; Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.  It should be pretty obvious after last night that Romeo Langford is going to be a good player in this league.  Edwards was a 2nd rounder and Williams was pick #22 which usually amounts to not much in this league.  As for Thybulle - what would the Celtics have even done with him?  He's utterly useless on offense and they already have Marcus Smart- any Smart/Thybulle lineup would be a disaster.  &gt; Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing  This doesn't even make much sense.  Nobody was giving up a fortune for free agents to be and the Celtics are precisely the kind of team that would generally be looking to acquire these guys.  &gt; Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything &gt; Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders  These aren't bad decisions so much as coin flip calls.  &gt; Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing  No choice on Kyrie, Horford got overpaid and that's not Ainge's fault, and they got the massive TPE for Hayward.  &gt; Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract  This is again a hindsight issue due to his knee going south.  At the time the signing was 100% justifiable and universally applauded.  &gt; Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson  Really don't see the issue here.  He's a great postseason player and gave them a dimension they needed.  You're really not going to do much better than TT on an MLE."
"He was great up until 2019 but has been bad since then.   - Coming away with only Grant Williams, Romeo Langford, and Carsen Edwards in 2019 while simultaneously trading away Matisse Thybulle.   - Not trading Morris and Rozier at the 2019 trade deadline and letting them walk for nothing   - Not trading the highly valued Kings and Grizzlies picks for anything   - Trading away the pick that became Desmond Bane for 2 2nd rounders   - Letting Kyrie, Horford, and Hayward walk for virtually nothing   - Signing Kemba Walker, an aging undersized inefficient PG, to a max contract   - Using the MLE on Tristan Thompson     Then there was the whole ""I haven't seen any racism in TD Garden"" thing which may or may not have alienated some of the players.    99% of GMs would have been fired for having the 2 year stretch Ainge did. Him stepping down is doing us a favor."
"Such a steal that you traded him and the 30th pick (Desmond Bane) for two future second round picks, and paid Tristan Thompson about twice as much to take his spot?"
"&gt;Shoulda gave up the farm for Jrue Holiday when they had the chance  I don't think Jrue was the solution, they needed forward depth not a second PG.  Hayward, Jae Crowder, Bobby Portis, etc are all good defensive forwards that Portland could have gone after in FA, hell even Tristan Thompson or even  Dwight or Javale could have been good defensive backup centers. Trades aside, they had options and just didn't pursue anything. It's honestly baffling.  Then there's trades. I'm confident they could've traded for some good defensive 3&amp;D forwards from rebuilding teams like Taurean Prince or Kelly Olynik, not to mention guys like PJ Tucker or Aaron Gordon who got picked up by contenders for basically nothing. Gary Trent Jr is literally a better defender than Powell and they packaged that trade with picks which to this day still makes no sense.  Sorry Portland fans, you guys have an atrociously lazy FO"
"You can't be as psyched as having Jabari Parker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson and the ghost of Kemba Walker."
Schroder is going to get $25M a year not because he deserves it but because the Lakers are capped out and can't afford to let him leave for nothing so they have to resign him. Tristan Thompson part 2.
"Ah yes the all star roster of Schroder, Caruso, Gasol and Kuzma of maybe the roster of JR Smith, Hill, Tristan Thompson"
"word. not sure what the rules are, but i feel like it's prob alright to post specific sections:  #The tradable contracts and assets  Once you remove Tatum and Brown from any trade dialogue, Ainge and his front office are looking at a mixed bag of trade options.  **Expiring contracts: Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson**  Smart is the longest-tenured member of the Celtics' roster and Ainge has made it clear how valuable he is to the team.  ""Marcus plays as hard as anybody,"" Ainge said on ""Toucher and Rich"" after the trade deadline. ""He competes at a level that -- he's won playoff series for us with his, I wouldn't call it bravado, just with his intensity and his competitive spirit.""  Smart, who earned first-team All-Defensive honors in 2018-19 and 2019-20, is on an expiring $14.4 million contract, but is eligible for a contract extension. Boston or an acquiring team (six months after the trade) can add a total of four years and $74.4 million of new money. If there is no extension in place, Boston would have a decision to make with regard to the future of Smart.  Thompson is on a $9.7 million contract and could be a financial casualty if the Celtics sign Fournier. The 30-year-old averaged the second fewest minutes in his career (23.8), but still managed to put up 7.6 points and 8.1 rebounds. He had a +2.6 net rating in the 11 games in which he came off the bench.  **Recent draft picks: Robert Williams III, Aaron Nesmith, Payton Pritchard, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford and Carsen Edwards**  Boston has five former first-round picks on rookie contracts, plus Edwards, who was a high second-round pick in 2019. While the Celtics' front office can be critiqued on their draft history, they have done a solid job drafting in the 20s, most notably the selections of Robert Williams (27 in 2018), Grant Williams (22 in 2019) and Payton Pritchard (26 in 2020).  Out of the six youngsters, Robert Williams III has the most value and upside of the group. He started 13 games in the regular season and is a candidate for an extension this offseason, making it unlikely that Boston would move him in a deal.  The jury is still out on their former lottery pick, Romeo Langford. Since the Celtics selected him No. 14 overall in 2019, the guard has spent more time on the inactive list as a result of injuries (and also COVID-19) than on the court. He has played in only 48 games his first two seasons, but did see considerable playing time in the playoffs in place of Jaylen Brown.  If there was a positive to a rather disappointing season, it is that Aaron Nesmith got better from the first time he stepped on the court until the end of the season. Nesmith averaged a season-high 9.2 points in May, shooting 55.9% from the field and 50% from 3.  **The former All-Star: Kemba Walker**  Walker still has $74 million left on his contract, including a $37.6 million player option for 2022-23 that he is all-but-certain to pick up.  Walker has averaged 20.4 and 19.2 points in his first two years in Boston, getting selected to the All-Star team in his first season. However, after missing six games in his final four years in Charlotte, Walker has missed 37 games over the past two seasons, and didn't play in back-to-backs this year.  According to ProFitX, Walker played $10 million below the actual value of his $34.4 million contract this year.  **The trade exceptions**  The Celtics were hard capped this past season, making it difficult for them to use their large, $28.5 million trade exception. However, starting Aug. 3, Boston will no longer have to operate below the apron, and will have three trade exceptions at its disposal to use: $11 million, $5.0 million and $4.8 million.  But like the case with re-signing Fournier or using its $5.9 million midlevel exception, there is an added cost associated as it relates to the luxury tax to acquiring a player via trade using the exceptions.  **The draft picks**  Despite trading four second-round picks as a part of the Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade and the March trade to acquire Fournier, the Celtics still have second-round picks in 2021, 2022 and 2026."
i need a joe biden executive order outlawing tristan thompson putback shots NOW
"Tristan Thompson hesitated after that rebound with Kyrie swatting at it, he wanted to make sure the right teammate was passed to."
"Like him better as a small ball 4. Putting him at the 5 is putting him out of place a bit. I much prefer green or matter a fact, Deandre Jordan was decent against Tristan Thompson throughout the Regular season matchups"
"Rookies, second year players that were injured last season, and Tristan Thompson"
"I don't think it is for sure way more valuable.  If you look at the last 10ish years of NBA champions it's hard to find a rim protector in there.  But you'll find elite wings in there like Iggy and Draymond, Kawhi with the Spurs and Raptors, Lebron and Battier at the Heat.  Those guys all dictated NBA finals series with great perimeter D against guys like Lebron.  Kawhi and Iggy won finals MVPs for being good at defending Lebron on the perimeter.  The best rim protectors to win titles in the last 10ish years are an old Dwight Howard off the bench and Tristan Thompson.  I think there's a great case for Rudy's importance to Utah's success and rim protection is definitely important but I don't think you can dismiss wing defending as being less important."
That was what the warriors did to LeBron back in 2015. Put Iggy on an island and deny the passes.   To this day Lebrons biggest weapon is his ability to get mediocre or bad players involved and have them looking like super stars by getting them into a groove. Take that away and now LeBron has to do it himself. I know he still had crazy fucking stats and would often (if I remember) end up with double digit assist but it was so spread and forced that it didn’t amount to much. Like take game 5. LeBron had 40/11/14 and next leading scorer was Tristan Thompson with 19.
Tristan Thompson is top 10 all-time in Bball Ref Ortg
"Bucks man-handled the Heat. Nets look like they're cruising for the most part but while they're dropping buckets the Celtics have managed to keep up a respectable pace without their 2nd best player and with a relatively shallow roster.  If the Nets can't contain Tatum, Tristan Thompson &amp; 3rd stringers I can't imagine how they're going to handle Giannis/ Middleton/ Jrue/ Lopez/ Portis"
"Nah, do Tristan Thompson instead. He'll follow you home afterward."
Not everyone https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2015/8/26/9200531/norris-cole-rich-paul-tristan-thompson-sign-qualifying-offer
Tristan Thompson
Devin Booker  Jordan Clarkson Ben Simmons Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tristan Thompson Kris Humphries  You can fill the rest ;)
It’s Sekou Doumbouya dunking on Tristan Thompson
Kevin Love would have helped the Warriors close the series quicker lol. People really need to stop saying the dumb without Kyrie and Love. Draymond Green eats Kevin Love alive in almost every match-up between those teams. Tristan Thompson was actually more of a threat to the Warriors. As he is a better defender than Love and was killing the Warriors on the glass.
[It's Tristan Thompson getting dunked on last season.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS78dffWoVI)
Let's just look at the names:  Lebron James vs Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving vs Steph Curry  Kevin Love vs Klay Thompson  JR Smith vs Draymond Green  Tristan Thompson vs Andre Iguodala   Does that look even top to bottom?
"Perfectly even matchup, top to bottom. Korver and Klay are basically the spiderman pointing meme, KD and Tristan Thompson both went to University of Texas, so they're also the same player pretty much."
Draymond was suspended for game 5. Warriors then lost Bogut for the rest of the series and the Cavs were bullying (particularly Tristan Thompson) in the paint. Warriors had to play more of Varejao and Ezeli in which they were god awful on the floor.
Tristan Thompson was not the best defensively
"nah, it was tristan thompson"
Tristan Thompson started at center in 2016.
Nah but Tristan Thompson wasn’t exactly Dikembe out there
"I think Tristan Thompson, but I could be wrong"
Nah they had Tristan Thompson.
"I don't know the other four guys, but Tristan Thompson is my center. This dude tricked the whole league into thinking he's a good rebounder, but his numbers are a lie. Thompson will grab an offensive board and miss 2-3 easy put-backs in a row just to inflate his stats. Then he'll get every single uncontested rebound on defense, while letting most of the contested rebounds slip right through his hands. I don't care what the numbers say, TT is not a good rebounder. And that's pretty much his only job.  If there are any Cavs fans reading this, how did you put up with this guy for 9 years? He actually sucks."
"When the best players on the team were Hill, Hood, Shumpert, Tristan Thompson and JR Smith he would be completely delusional to think they would be anything better than maybe the 8th seed."
"Big dumb, thought lebron won a ring in his last year but I misremembered. That was the year he went solo mode and carried everyone. Still a finals team tho, and with what Tristan Thompson said before the season they had targets on their back"
"Please, everyone knew the Cavs were gonna be bad   Just go look at the thread of the initial announcement of Love getting this contract   Everyone knew it was a bad move but they were just paying him for the sake of it. Not a single person said anything close to ‘the Cavs are still trying to win games’. It was clear as day their time was over, having Kyle Korver, Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson isn’t a long term plan and if you or Love thought that, you are on the edge of delusional"
We'll give you 1 Tristan Thompson on an expiring contract so you can chase a 2022 FA?  Although I really don't know what Kuzma's value in the league is. I think you're right it's higher than fans would say.
"Olynyk, Tristan Thompson"
"This, Tristan Thompson was awful against Embiid.  Embiid went 13 for 15 with 5 shooting fouls drawn over the course of 32 possessions against Thompson. Among 30 players with &gt;20 possessions against Embiid this season Thompson was the worst of all of them by a pretty notable margin."
"They did ship wade out of Cleveland quickly. If you’re talking about Tristan Thompson, he was incredible in the 16 Finals"
Tristan Thompson has been no better than a backup center during his career except one 18 month stretch.  Anyone who watched basketball in the last 5 years knew giving Thompson more than the minimum was clown shit.  Theis is significantly better and the Celtics salary dumped him to duck the tax lmao
Tristan Thompson has nearly completed his journey in transitioning into Kris Humphries
"For all GMs reading this, OP is lying his ass off.  You should definitely trade for Tristan Thompson."
"is Tristan Thompson ever going to see the light of day again with Horford, Timelord, and Brown on the roster"
"Tristan Thompson made sure to trick everybody with like a good 6-8 week stretch to begin 2019-20(contract yr) otherwise the reality is he hasnt been very good at basketball in 4-5 yrs. Injuries took their toll, never was a great roll man to begin with, but now he's just immobile cant switch at all like he once could. Think it was like his calf or something in 2017 that was really the downfall after 2017 he went from being good at switching to a liability on the perimeter. Doesnt add value as a rim protector and he's gone from like 67% at the rim to 57%. He's largely a minimum value backup level big at this point."
Yet the final 7 minutes of game 7 he was guarded the majority of time by Tristan Thompson and faded into obscurity.
"Tristan Thompson was a little over a year older than Holmes, coming off a 12 and 10 season but only got 19m/2.   Plumlee was 3 years older than Holmes, coming off a 7/5/2 and got 25m/3.  Steven Adams was younger than Holmes is coming off a 11/9 season and got 35m/2.  I write this to say the market has no consistency and I have no idea how much Holmes will get. I feel like Christian Woods deal should be the high water mark for younger unproven bigs right now. If Holmes gets Steven Adams money I'll think it's an overpay."
"Ontario (Canada): Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles, Mfiondu Kabengele, Cory Joseph, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Brandon Clarke, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker…. Damn!!! We got a squad!!!!"
"“Oh I’m Tristan Thompson, I’m the biggest guy on the floor I should probably have more rebounds than CURRY”"
I mean... so is Tristan Thompson. That doesn’t mean shit. Lebron and AD would have forced themselves places regardless of agent
"Shai, Jamal Murray, RJ Barrett, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson starting 5"
"They could have done that for a fraction of the price though. Guys like Robin Lopez, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Howard would have been fine."
Many players change their routines. Blake Griffin changed his to remove the hitch at the top and improved around 10% i believe. Tristan Thompson literally changed which hand he used. There's at least a dozen more that have changed little parts of their routine and set up to improve their stroke.   These guys are shooting most days during the off-season so can get in thousands of reps on a new routine before having to hit it in a game. Therefore it's much easier for them to change something.
"are teams that attached to the 20-30th pick?  those guys can become anything, even a player as good as tristan thompson!   ... who was picked 4th."
"When the Cavs were shopping players in Lebrons last year and trying to get another star to compete with the KD Warriors, the package of Iman Shumpert, Tristan Thompson &amp; the Nets 1st round pick was getting posted everywhere for trade ideas until it essentially became a meme."
"&gt;No one cares       Are you sure no one cares when Tristan Thompson, Danuel House and Malik Beasley are sleeping around?"
"Bro I mean a roster of Jamal, SGA, Wiggins, Barrett, Dort, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dillon Brooks, Olynyk, Dwight Powell, Chris Boucher and Cory Joseph is pretty ridiculously good, they have a lot of exciting younger guys too...Alexander-Walker comes to mind. A fully healthy Canadian B-ball Olympic team has gotta be the second best team in the world by a long shot, right?"
"At this moment in time it’s Al who’s good but getting old, timelord who is great but is legitimately physically unable to play starting minutes, Tristan Thompson who can be good depending on the matchup but doesn’t outweigh the cons, and moises brown who has about a 20% chance of being a good big and is making pennies on the dollar compared to other NBA players for the next couple years.   Would be amazing if we could just somehow combine all four of them into one player lol"
"Actually other sports have done it.  But this guy explains why Lebron deserved the Finals MVP way better than I could:  *LeBron James is fighting an army by himself. He's probably going to lose, but he's not dying easily.*  James' average line in these NBA Finals is 36.6 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 8.4 assists per game.  **Only Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and James Worthy** have managed to do that **in a single NBA Finals game** since 1986. **James is doing it every game.** *James is the only person to have 35 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in that time frame ... and he's done it three times in this series.*  *His 40-point triple-double in Game 5 was the first in decades. James had 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists by halftime, something nobody has done in any game -- finals, postseason or regular season -- since James entered the league.*  James is the Cavaliers' offense. He scored or assisted 16 of their 17 first half baskets, including every one in the second quarter. He ended up scoring or assisting 26 of their 32 field goals.  **He's doing this out of necessity. When James is on the court, the Cavaliers score 97.2 points per 100 possessions. When he is off the court, they score 54.6 points per 100 possessions. THAT IS VERY BAD.**  With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, the Cavs are down their second- and third-best players. None of LeBron's remaining teammates can create his own shots.  J.R. Smith loves trying, but he is woefully inefficient in doing so. Tristan Thompson can score on offensive rebounds, but isn't a great post-up player. Timofey Mozgov works best in the pick-and-roll, which needs James to act as ball-handler. There was one possession in Game 5 where Matthew Dellavedova tried going one-on-one with his defender. It looked like an escaped zoo animal trying to break out of a lasso after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.  There is no course of action for the Cavaliers besides just giving the ball to LeBron over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Against the NBA's best defense, this should end disastrously. But it hasn't been a complete disaster. It's been kind of close.  The Warriors are winning because they're a great team with several great players. Sometimes Stephen Curry is great! Sometimes Klay Thompson is great! Sometimes Andre Iguodala is great! Everybody's great! The Cavaliers have won two games and made two others close solely because LeBron James is playing like a demigod.   By the literal definition of the term, James has been the most valuable player in the NBA Finals.  But if the Cavaliers lose, don't bet on James receiving the award that goes to the most valuable player.  Once upon a time, it was reasonably common for players who put up astounding performances for losing teams to receive championship event MVP trophies, but sometime in the past 40 years or so, that trend fell out of style.  In the NBA, a losing player has only received the MVP once, when Jerry West won the award in 1969, the very first year an award was given. His was as preposterous as LeBron's. He averaged 38 points per game in a seven-game defeat to the Celtics and had a 42-point triple-double in Game 7, the only triple-double with a higher point total in finals history than James' Game 5.  The MLB and NFL have also given out MVP's to losing players just once, and both were a long time ago. The only losing World Series MVP was Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson in 1960. If that series were played now, the trophy would almost certainly go to Bill Mazeroski, who hit a walkoff home run in Game 7. The only losing Super Bowl MVP was Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley way back in Super Bowl V, in 1971.  Hockey players who lose the Stanley Cup are still kind of in the running for the Conn Smythe Trophy, but that's a bit more understandable because it's meant to reward the player with the best overall postseason performance, not merely the best performance in the decisive series. It's been given to losing players five times, with four being goaltenders. But this too is becoming increasingly rare. After two defeated players received the trophy in the first four years it was awarded, only one has gotten it in the past 25 years: Jean-Sebastian Giguere in 2003.  Whether the move away from rewarding losing players is a conscious effort on the part of leagues, a change in the voting procedures or thought processes for participating media or merely a coincidence is unclear. But it is clear that nobody is particularly interested in making an incredibly awkward moment happen.  Picture the scenario of the Warriors winning and James winning the MVP. The confetti-covered Warriors are celebrating their team's first championship in 40 years. It's the photo opportunity of a lifetime, a moment Warriors fans will cherish for decades to come.  And now Adam Silver has to speak into a microphone and tell everybody that none of them was good enough to win MVP. They have to stand aside as somebody goes searching for LeBron. Is he in the locker room? Does he come out, despite being devastated by defeat, to receive the trophy on stage? Does somebody go quietly bring it to him backstage? Does he even want the dang thing? Everybody involved hates it. The LeBron-hating contingent would go apoplectic, convinced once and for all that people will go to great lengths to praise James in spite of his consistent failures.  For these reasons, James will almost certainly need to will the Cavaliers to a win in Game 7 in order to be the NBA Finals MVP. If he doesn't, somebody on the Warriors -- probably Curry, perhaps Iguodala or somebody else depending on what happens in the future -- will get the award.  But let's not forget what James is doing against incredible odds.*"
I thought it was playing with Lebron will help you get a huge contract? Look at Tristan Thompson.  Guess playing with Lebron can easily make you a worse player.
I say this fully knowing that I get my shit mixed if it came to it.   But ain't no one scared of no bum ass Tristan Thompson.
We’ll give you Tristan Thompson and the Kardashians for the 10th pick
"Tristan ""Play if you want"" Thompson"
"So the plan is to intentionally trade 2 of our only good players for worse assets than what they’re worth? What is the logic in that? The ceiling of white and Murray isn’t what potentially brings a chip. They are supporting pieces. It’s the  players you add onto that, and  the players you develop with them that vaults you to that position.   “Tank for first pick”   We can literally tank with those 2 on the roster without taking on worse players. And either way tanking doesn’t guarantee you get the 1st pick.   “And absorb bad contracts to get FR so finally found gems like Manu and Parker from late picks”   I’m 100% confused on what you meant by that statement so I’m just going to assume you meant take on bad contracts to get picks so we can get gems like manu and tony. In that terrible deal you suggested we got Tristan Thompson who has absolutely 0 positive value, Marcus Smart who is expiring and 2 players at rookie deals at positions which we literally do not need. On top of that no picks whatsoever. And the Spurs have already found and developed gems with late picks; those being Derrick White and Dejounte Murray both of whom were 29th picks, and both of whom who aren’t getting traded for scraps to the Celtics."
"Marcus smart , tristan Thompson , payton pritchard  , aaron nesmith   For both of them"
Tristan Thompson could help Zion navigate the world of reality TV.
"Man, at this point, the Bucks might as well suit up JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and Matthew Dellavadova"
He's been playing with Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond who were basically only good for getting boards. Kevin Love didn't need to get rebounds with them in
Cavs in 6/7. Nets lack of interior presence got them bounced. Atleast we have Tristan Thompson to do our dirty work and was a big help in 2016 as well.
Tristan Thompson is not stopping Giannis maybe Bucks in 6
"Get yourself a ring, Jae. God damn I really wish the Celtics would have brought him back over Tristan Thompson."
"Ayton is just a prototypical center though. He’s elite at everything a center should be; but it’s not like he’s got special skills like passing or shooting  Warriors won with Bogut at C. Cleveland won with Tristan Thompson. You don’t necessarily need an elite center, but you do need an elite guard or wing"
"The funny thing is, the Celtics have continued to implement this philosophy where they throw up a Hail Mary for the top free agents year after year to try to recapture the glory days but nobody can stand to be in that pompous asshole of a city for more than a season without wanting out. Only a matter of time before Tatum and Brown ask for their walking papers. But hey, at least you guys have Tristan Thompson. 😂"
"Preach, one time I looked up Tristan Thompson Net Worth for some reason and it was lower than HIS YEARLY GUARANTEED SALARY... How dumb can these pages get"
"Nah, once the Warriors went small and inserted Iggy into the starting line up, they easily figured out the Cavs. They were toying with the Cavs from Games 4-6, none of those games were close. The Cavs 2 wins in that series were by a combined 7 points.   People forget Kyrie played Game 1 and the Cavs lost. and Love was a horrible matchup against the Warriors with Draymond making him look like a scrub every time.   Tristan Thompson taking Love's minutes and being a versatile defender was better for the Cavs"
"No patriotism like Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke Have for Canada."
"Kind of patriotism Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson and Brandon Clarke have for Canada."
"&gt; who is dating a Kardashian  Tristan Thompson dated a Kardashian, do people flock to see him?"
Tristan Thompson for sure
Now we know who got Tristan Thompson to switch his shooting hand on free throws at halftime of a finals game.
Tristan Thompson switched shooting hands IN the league.
Worked for Tristan Thompson....sort of..... [Here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2013/08/10/tristan-thompson-right-handed-left-handed-switch-canada-cleveland-cavaliers)
Andrew Wiggins was their best player. It's not like they're that great of a team. RJ Barrett was his sidekick and choked in the 2nd half of the CR game.  This was also the first time out for this group.  Cory Joseph was the best player on the 2019 World Cup team. Tristan Thompson was the best player on the 2016 Olympic qualifying team. 20-year old Andrew Wiggins was the best player on the 2015 team.  What does why does this keep happening to Canada basketball? mean? This is the first time they fielded a good team and they lost an overtime game. And even though their roster is solid it's not like they have a superstar on it.
Tristan thompson and the 45th pick
It’s not that they have NBA players. The problem is that the Canadian roster has been so inconsistent year to year. Half the time layers opt out of playing for no reason at all. See Jamal Magloire of years gone by or Tristan Thompson more recently. The hope was that the talent this time would overcome the lack of chemistry and they could build on it going into the Olympics.   So if you don’t know where you are going to get commitment from how can you ensure chemistry?  What really hurt Canada was a lack of height (and centres) vs Czech who had two players over 7 feet tall and that the three point shooting went ice cold. Even then they lost by two to the eventual winners of the tournament.
"He’s better than that, tbh.  2 seasons ago he was a monster for us and this past season he was put into a shit situation sharing the floor with Tristan Thompson.  Theis can be a good starting 5 and if not, he’s one of the best bench bigs in the NBA."
"Dude, he better be passing the ball to Jaylen and Jayson, literally your 2 best scoring options... If Marcus Smart gets more assists to Daniel Theis or Tristan Thompson then your offense is in the shit tier"
"considering him getting injured is the reason we didn't win the chip it's honestly not that insane, LeBron won a ring with Tristan Thompson, Dame would be similar to LeBron and Kyrie but better"
"this coming season I think will be a transition &amp; evaluation year.  It's a sink or swim year for so many of the Celtics pieces (Timelord, Langford, Grant Williams, Smart) that the team needs to see where those guys are and showcase them to try &amp; increase their trade value if nothing else.  What they can get on the court from Pritchard &amp; Nesmith in year 2 will also have a huge impact on the future, those guys need reps next season (and hopefully a summer league &amp; full training camp this offseason).  I could see the Celtics making a move around the periphery to move Tristan Thompson for some veteran PG depth to go with Smart (maybe Ricky Rubio or someone like that on an expiring), but nothing major.  I wouldn't be in a hurry to throw lots of money at Fournier, he's a fine player but I'd much rather preserve flexibility for next summer if at all possible."
"Jamal Murray is a FIBA god too btw, him and Barrett had some great moments for us and are pretty committed to the program. Add SGA and future projected top 3 pick in Elijah Fisher, we got some great talent coming up. Also having Wiggins finally enter the program is huge, very few non-USA teams can match his natural athleticism, he can basically get buckets whenever he wants.    We came a long way from Cory Joseph and Tristan Thompson being the faces of the program, but I'll always rate those guys."
"Aside from SGA/Murray injuries, we need other NBA players to buy in as well. Imagine if we had Olynyk, Dillon Brooks, Oshae o'Brissett, Khem Birch, Tristan Thompson for today's game"
3 team deal. Celtics get KAT. Wolves get KVon. ATL gets tristan thompson
"That’s crazy to me. I guess because this season was so fucked up they had a hard time getting players? You’d think Canada would at least be like a top 5 team, *at least.* Nick Nurse, coach. A roster with NBA players on it. But where are like SGA and Tristan Thompson and Kelly O and Dillon Brooks? Was Jamal Murray planning on playing? How has Canada missed the Olympics 5 straight times???  I hope they get their shit together and put together a squad."
"Despite the roster's wealth of NBA experience, Canada is missing a number of notable talents.  In addition to injured Denver Nuggets shooting guard Jamal Murray, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Memphis Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks, Boston Celtics big man [Tristan Thompson](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/6364), Houston Rockets big man [Kelly Olynyk](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/2041), and Toronto Raptors bigs [Chris Boucher](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/46591) and [Khem Birch](https://www.thescore.com/nba/players/11121) are sitting out the qualifiers."
Would have won without him if only we had a couple big man suiting up for us. Could have really used khem or Tristan Thompson.... Or even Kelly
"Yeah, I believe the Cavs own pick in that draft was Tristan Thompson. Huge difference there"
Tristan Thompson should have been there.
"And Jamal Murray, Dillon Brooks, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olnyk, Tristan Thompson, etc."
Not to mention Tristan Thompson and Kelly Olynyk. Really could have used their size down the middle when we went cold beyond the arc.
Tristan Thompson did Canada no favors by not playing. He could at least made that Balvin stiff work a bit instead of looking like Rudy Gobert in the  NBA regular season.
"Yeah that was definitely an omission on my end although one can quibble about how much of that is solely due to LeBron being born in Ohio.  One could have easily imagined the mid 2010 Cavs hitting the salary cap to keep their ‘talented young roster’ of Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Andrew Wiggins together."
Tristan Thompson and some sloppy second round picks
Tristan Thompson and a future top 10 protected first round pick. Philly pays 50% of his remaining salary. Fair is fair.
"I hope these next few guys pan out better.  We were supposed to have a golden generation. Year after year we had guys go high in the lottery, even two 1st overall picks. Wiggins Bennett Olynyk Stauskas Tristan Thompson Tyler Ennis Cory Joseph. If you told me that there would be 0 all star games played between that group I would have called you a hater."
"Easier said when you are  far away from the United States, and the influences of agents and the nba, all the time- not just in season. It’s sad Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, Kabengele, and Brandon Clarke dont care enough to bother to play for Canada."
people forget Kyrie played Game 1 and the Cavs lost. and Love was a horrible matchup against the Warriors with Dray making him look like a scrub every time  Tristan Thompson taking Love's minutes and being a versatile defender was better for the Cavs imo
Rajon Rondo  DeMar DeRozan  James Johnson  Kyle Kuzma  Clint Capela  Ricky Rubio  Bradley Beal  Bojan Bogdanovic  Al-Farouq Aminu  Kosta Koufos  Jarrett Jack  Bogdan Bogdanovic  Kyle Korver  Gerald Green  Markieff Morris  Marcus Morris  Bismack Biyombo  Tristan Thompson
"Regular season doesn't mean jack compared to post season, so Lebron. Lebron in general is a more desirable player because he can do a huge carry job with people like tristan thompson and jr smith lol"
"Bogut getting injured completely changed the warriors shot blocking, defense and paint play, suddenly tristan thompson turned into shaq, just bullying mofos for points and offensive rebounds."
"Duncan stayed because had tt, so obviously it helped him. Teams would rather have a young raw Tristan Thompson than a polished Jimmer.  Getting these guys adjusted to NBA speed is whats best as far as the teams are concerned, as for the players, it's up to them. I could see a few guys sticking around longer and they certainly deserve to be paid for their talent."
"Damn, that's actually a much worse than it looks initially when you reexamine draft... when Kawhi, Klay, Butler, Kemba and Vucevic were still on the board. Hell even Tobias Harris or Isaiah Thomas. That was actually a great draft, a ton of role players that could contribute to championship level teams - the Morris twins, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, Bogdanovic. The odds were actually in your favour that year to get something worthwhile. Sorry that sucks."
"What you a big Tristan Thompson guy or something?  Jk lol I’m just bored, I should probably go do something more productive."
Tristan Thompson isn’t good at all
I bet you watch Tristan Thompson highlights don’t you.
"Clearly you want a certain answer lmao ""while Tristan Thompson lost in the first round"" was he supposed to backpack them over the fucking Nets?"
"God what a great finals series. I really want to rewatch it, but I think this is as close as I'll get. I don't want to rewatch Tristan Thompson on the cavs, was painful."
"Man, I really wanted us to trade for Onyeka Okongwu. I was super high on the guy, I saw a league that's slowly trending towards more perimeter oriented, and Onyeka's strong enough to still outmuscle most centers, and quick laterally enough to contest more shooters/not get slaughtered on PnR defense.   I see the Bam comparisons, although Bam's game at Kentucky was different than how he's utilized more in the DHO's with Spoelstra's Heat. I still could see OO doing well on most teams that had proper spacing. His game reminds me of a mix of Bam/Tristan Thompson/T-Rez, where he's going to have an insane motor.  OO's game on offense is still not polished enough, but he certainly has the tools + work ethic and swagger to make it work.   I love me some Timelord, and I think he's our center of the future. I cannot deny there are times where I question his durability and health, and other than the foot injury that OO had early on, he's been a relatively healthy guy. He's someone I coveted on the C's.   Smfh at those calling bust though."
"He declined for some reason. Probably rehabbing, and given all the injuries I don’t blame him.  Kelly Olynyk and Khem Birch too, but they’re both FAs so it’s a little more obvious why they did. Tristan Thompson just cuz I guess."
Tristan Thompson *should* be the primary center. No idea why he pulled out. His money next year is guaranteed.
Tristan Thompson played 447 straight games his rookie season till 2017. That’s pretty impressive as well  Westbrook is wild because of how explosive he was
Remember that one time Tristan Thompson hit him and he went flying like he was shot.
James Harden  Rick Fox  Rashad McCants  Lamar Odom  Tristan Thompson
"There’s sooo many great ones honestly, but two of my favorites that haven’t been mentioned in the thread yet are:   &gt; Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned  &gt; Kevin Love was confused when he didn’t see Jordan Clarkson run onto the court moments before tipoff Monday night. Then Love saw teammate Tristan Thompson, who was lagging behind. Thompson said one word to Love. “Utah”."
"Cavs drafted terrible, there is no way going around it. Not to mention how suspious is that they got 3/4 number 1 picks in the years that Lebron was gone. If Lebron doesn't come back - what are they going to do with Wiggins, Bennett, Kyrie and Tristan Thompson?  The idea behind the OP's questions is, is it worth it to tank as much? The Sixers got the pieces but as for now ""Failed"" because the didn't had the culture, the coach and the management which was a side effect from the tanking.  Suns tank for ten years and just this year were able to ""bank"" on it.  I think that there are far more ""bad"" examples from tanking than successful ones"
Love played a lot of small center with Cleveland. Tristan Thompson lol?  Big Z never won a championship but he made the Finals and had multiple deep playoff runs.
Love was a pf. He played with Tristan Thompson in Cleveland.  Illgauskus never won a championship with LeBron.
"Mozgov was mediocre in the 2015-2016 season (in the video), which unlocked Tristan Thompson at center and Channing Frye as his backup."
Not true. My sister knows all about him and Tristan Thompson because of the Kardashian thing. He’s definitely famous for the Kardashian connection as well as basketball. He’s probably just as famous for basketball as he is being connected to Kendall.
"The gap in playmaking is about the same in scoring IMO. Nash might be the best passing small ever and Steph is the best scoring small ever. If either focused in on the other trait they’d produce more but the gap would still exist.  Steph is a better defender and it’s noticeable. Nash was horrific on that end and I’m no exaggerating, it was cringey to watch.  Steph was like the 2nd best rebounding Warrior last season, and out rebounded Tristan Thompson in I believe 2 finals series, he’s actually really good at it for his size and position."
Al Jefferson - post moves   Matisse Thybulle - blocking jump shots from behind   DeAndre Jordan - catching lobs   Manute Bol - blocking shots without jumping   Tristan Thompson - offensive rebounding
I think everyone gets a turn with it  I remember Tristan Thompson and Cory jo even brought the trophy to Toronto. When ibaka won he took it to the Republic of Congo.   Giannis is doing the same for Greece. Except the finals mvp is only his lol.
"I dunno, the Celtics’ biggest problems were: - the ENTIRE bench was rookie contract guys who weren’t quite ready and never got a steady role bc COVID; the young guys will improve some, and now there’s a mix of vets, too - Kemba just wasn’t Kemba, but the chance that he would get his groove back meant they couldn’t play Smart at PG regularly, where he is best. - Covid, injuries, more covid - Tristan Thompson played like deep fried ass - not enough passing - covid again - guys tuning out Stevens  Assuming guys got vaccinated (🤞) and Tatum’s playmaking from the Olympics (where Udoka was on the coaching staff) carries over, every single one of those got addressed to some degree. Cs did lose Fournier, who’s a good player, but he just wasn’t on the squad and healthy for more than a handful of games: it’s a step back on paper, but kind of a depressingly small difference from last year even without considering the defensive improvement coming with Richardson, Dunn, and a healthy Langford getting his minutes. And shit, Tatum and Brown are both under 25 and still improving.  Time will tell, but I legit expect a step forward on a couple fronts."
"&gt;Horford (small upgrade)  Horford ain't the same AL from two years ago, but even at 35 he still is a a whoooooole lot better then Thompson. Tristan was unplayable at time last year. I think offensively Schroder is a downgrade, but Kemba health and defensively make him a liability."
tristan thompson hit it first
Tristan Thompson off the bench?
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yyGCpla2UY&amp;ab_channel=NF  He went 3/16 and there isn't a single double team, he was even getting switched on to Tristan Thompson, Larry Nance and Kevin Love lmao and couldn't score"
"Forget spacing, Kareem could score every posession if he was being guarded by someone like Tristan Thompson."
Kareem is dropping 50/20 on Tristan Thompson lol and Bron isn’t big enough to guard him either
Danny Green is fine but Tristan Thompson against Kareem?  Maybe give Bron Kawhi or Klay as a 3 and D guy and then a HOF Center
"Boston Sends:  4 second rounders, a first rounder, Kemba Walker, Evan Fournier, Tristan Thompson  Boston Receives:  Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, and 17m TPE that they likely will not even use."
Tristan Thompson has requested a trade to the Bucks.
"first go around yes (+2018 but by that time we were aging out and had zero assets left), second go around no. 2015-17 we had some of the best playoff offenses ever. Obviously you can argue that's because of Bron but Kyrie/Peak JR/Tristan Thompson/Prime Kevin Love is a pretty damn good supporting cast"
"Doesn't matter if it's intentional it's still sick.  Lebron had that behind the back between Tristan Thompson legs and I'm pretty sure that wasn't intentional, doesn't make it less awesome."
Gordon Hayward and Tristan Thompson?
"If everybody is healthy and chooses to play for you guys you would be silver medal favorites imo with a chance of upsetting USA for gold.  You’ve got Murray/SGA/Brooks/Wiggins/Olynyk   Then Cory Joseph/Dort/RJ/Boucher/Birch  And that’s still leaving off some solid guys like Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Dwight Powell, Oshae Brisset, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker  That’s a lot of talent, and if they commit to the three year plan then they’re for sure strong contenders"

"He fits into your Tristan Thompson TPE, right? I think if you toss Memphis a 2nd round pick, that'd be a great deal for all three sides."
"Yeah I watched a good amount of Celtics games this past season. In addition to what you mentioned, the amount of Daniel Theis + Tristan Thompson lineups they played was pretty tragic lol, this season gonna be better for sure"
What about NBA champion Tristan Thompson?
"The East still runs through the Cavs - Tristan Thompson, 2018"
"He’s top 7 if the criteria is dating a Jenner/Kardashian. Harden, Booker, prime Blake, prime Odom. Would still put him ahead of D-Lo, Clarkson and Tristan Thompson"
"2013 draft was a terrible year, the talent wasn’t deep, reminiscent of the 2006 Bargnani draft where there wasn’t a polarizing can’t miss prospect.   2012 draft, they passed on Dame, but it was understandable given that they had Kyrie from 2011. Putting two lead guards in a starting line up a population notion a decade ago.  2011 they scored Kyrie and Tristan Thompson. 2014 they were going to select Embiid before he got injured, and instead selected Wiggins to move to Minny for KLove package."
"I mean, I still remember getting a picture with Tristan Thompson at Summer league one year. Mostly because it's ridiculous with me double fisting bears and him wearing a shirt that just said ""pervert.""  Me and my gang now exclusively call TT the pervert."
"i would’ve audibled mid question  kyrie: okay, sorry continue  me: so anyway, tristan thompson said lebron was a good dad. it got me thinking, how many dads on the team could your dad beat up?"
"I mean tbf the only reason why the reporter was asking this question in the first place is because literally the day before this happened, Tristan Thompson told reporters during his media availability that ""Lebron is a great father to us young guys"" kind of in a joking way, basically roasting him for being old.  and then this Kyrie clip woman probably read that quote in print, where the lighthearted/jokey nature of the comment might not have been as obvious, and she was curious if kyrie had similar feelings, so she asked him about it the next day.  was the way she asked the question still kind of bumbling/awkward? yes. But its not like it was some random crazy theory out of left field that she just pulled out of thin air and made up herself. It was just a follow up on what his teammate said (granted, a poor follow up)  Hell if she had worded it slightly differently and not completely botched the delivery and used the phrase ""parental role"", she might have gotten a halfway decent answer from him"
"One thing I do want to point out is that the number of starts Tristan Thompson got last year is an indicator of how banged-up our rotation was, *not* an indication that we lost a starting-caliber player. TT *sucked* for us last year, and there were times when he was our *only* healthy big man."
revised  PG: Damian Lillard - 36$  SG: Jamal Murray - 7$  SF: Khris Middleton - 30$  PF: Bobby Portis - 3$  C: Embiid - 38$  BENCH  Tristan Thompson - 2$  Andre Iguodala - 2$  Kent Bazemore - 2$  this team is not losing
Further apart now then it used to be. Im sure alot of people who know nothing about basketball or the NBA know who Tristan Thompson and Ben Simmons are. Purely because of the Kardashians
Defense against Curry was different after the hospital game. Started switching instead of having Delly fight through the screen so there was a lot of Curry on Tristan Thompson matchups after that.
Tristan Thompson in shambles
"I wouldn't mind if they kept him if it could work somehow, but the relationship with the fans and team is likely past the point of repair. If Morey wants to hold out on accepting packages that are way below his value then I'm fine with that.  My original post is true though lol. He had 3 utterly horrendous games at the end against the Hawks, and while they're more important obviously because they were playoff and elimination games, it shouldn't define his career and value. He's obviously got some serious stuff to work on, but he's young and has all star and all defense accolades on his resume. People on here are acting like he's Tristan Thompson lol."
"I have this comment saved for this exact situation   Edit: please check out these numbers from as late as 2016 courtesy of u/Nejkulatoulinkatejsi:  Last year's (2016) postseason was the best defensive run by a wing ever. (You could argue 2012 too after Bosh went down and LeBron had to play a full time PF/C against West/Hibbert and Bass/Garnett while somehow also defending George and Pierce at the same time, but we didn't have the Tracking stats back then).

"Those horrible contracts were guys that have already won with Lebron (JR Smith, Tristan Thompson) not recently acquired undersized point guards coming off a potentially career ending injury. Unless IT was an all-nba player that year and the Cavs won the title I don't think Lebron was staying or IT was getting paid. Let's be honest here, no one thought the Cavs were better after trading Kyrie for IT especially with how dominant the Warriors were in the last 2 years. The writing was on the wall with Lebron leaving sooner rather than later.   Lebron's playbook since joining Miami has always been the same. Sign to a team. Mortgage off the team's entire future to go into win-now mode. Once the players that were acquired  to try and win are no longer worth the money they are getting paid then move on to the next team and repeat. The Cavs were on the decline at that point and had no assets or cap space left to improve the team. Lebron was gone the next year and everyone knew it."
Tristan Thompson did the same with the Cavs and he got the bag.
"What would be a fair contract for IT that wouldn't immediately be overpay knowing what we know now?  It's a losing situation. Any contract the Cs gave IT would have been a monster, and instead of feeling bad for him, everyone would have just mocked and bullied IT like they do Mosgov or Tristan Thompson.  There is zero nuance in the comments. The truth is IT's contract situation came at the worst time for him. Trading for Kyrie was not bad for IT. Again look at Tristan Thompson. If IT had recovered and proved he was good again, Lebron would have made sure he got paid. In his contract year, IT fell off a cliff. That's just unfortunate timing."
"Now I'm trying to think of other lineups that would be close. 2017-18 Celtics had Kyrie (1), Smart (6), Brown (3), Tatum (3), Horford (3), which is pretty up there, but I'm struggling to think of other teams that  ran anything like three 1st overall picks.  I think technically in 2014, between the Cavs signing LeBron and trading for Kevin Love, the Cavs had 4 #1 picks on their roster. They never actually played together since the trade happened before the season, but theoretically they could've put out lineups of Kyrie (1), Wiggins (1), LeBron (1), Bennett (1), Tristan Thompson (4)."
You must have missed the time where he outrebounded Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love combined in the finals
" I saw him at Texas. He wasn’t the greatest defender mainly because he would sometime overplay. A guy like Neemias Queta is better than him all around. Sims needs to work on his offense, or be like Tristan Thompson, and use his wingspan and length to his advantage and become a great offensive rebounder. Prime Tristan Thompson was great at that."
I'm feeling pretty good about the re-tooling this summer  - +Al Horford – Tristan Thompson  - +Josh Richardson – Evan Fournier  - +Kris Dunn – Kemba Walker  - +Dennis Schroder
"WOW holy shit. You guys have Jones, Len AND Tristan Thompson? These are GOAT Hawks Centers."
"Don't expect anyone to have watched us, but Damian Jones was a very serviceable backup big for us last season. Far more useful than Whiteside, and I prefer him getting minutes over Len and Tristan Thompson."
reminds me of the tristan thompson situation except he didn't know he wasn't amazing.
Tristan Thompson
That’s definitely what did it. Ben Simmons has been an consecutive all star for years now and one series sunk his value he’s lucky it’s not a contract year. Tristan Thompson never deserved an 82 million contract but luckily he won the chip in his contract yr. This guy isn’t at all grasping that he’s talking with tons of hindsight lol.
"She’s been around the block apparently. OBJ, Tekashi 69, DaBaby, Tristan Thompson, Waka Flocka"
"Which is crazy cause if you look next door, Kennard got a ~14/year and Marcus Morris got a ~16/year contract from the Clippers who are basically in the same position so thinking he'd get 25/year when he's not playing any better than those guys is really reaching. Looking back at Tristan Thompson on the Cavs, he got a 5 year $82 and that was a contract everyone thought was a crazy overpay for a team that had no options. There's really no precedent for a guy--playing like he is--getting more than Schroeder was offered, even when the team has their back against the wall."
"Tristan Thompson switched hands early in his career, had his highest ft% season right after, then regressed over the following seasons."
Tristan Thompson is also [ambidextrous](https://www.si.com/nba/2013/08/10/tristan-thompson-right-handed-left-handed-switch-canada-cleveland-cavaliers).  &gt; He’s naturally almost perfectly “multi-handed” if not purely ambidextrous.
Tristan Thompson switched the hand he uses to shoot FTs. [Channing Frye was suggesting he try it](https://sidelinesources.com/nba-news/channing-frye-suggests-for-ben-simmons-to-switch-his-shooting-hand/).
Not needed now.  Resigned Holmes and traded for Tristan Thompson. My question is what's going to happen with the Porzingas? he's been mentioned alot.
You will take Tristan Thompson whether you want to or not.
"Warriors win that series if Andrew Bogut doesn't get injured. that injury completely changed Golden State's shot blocking and interior defense, suddenly tristan thompson became shaq."
"We literally only lost Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Fournier, and added Al Horford and Josh Richardson.   \-Kemba missed nearly half the season and showed close to no burst/athleticism anymore, and was essentially turned into a jumpshooter. He was streaky before getting hurt, then take away his ability to drive and he either scores an inefficient 25 or puts up a complete dud while also being a turnstile on defense.   \-We had Fournier for a total of 16 games and had a losing record with him. I would've liked to have kept him, but he was never really integrated well and therefore him leaving shouldn't be factored into this team.  \-Thompson was awful save for game 3 of the Brooklyn series."
Tristan Thompson and a bag of Doritos
"The Tristan Thompson trade hasn't been completed yet, we could easily shed more salary in that trade by getting rid of Carsen Edwards and not taking Dunn in return."
LA LAKERS is Tristan Thompson  Dwight Howard is Khloe Kardashian
Lol. touche.  He was just a poorly thought out impulse signing by a inept front office. He looked like a competent deep threat in Boston due to our spacing and y'all brought him to be THE spacing around 2 other bigs and the fit wasn't right.  Was like a worse version of us trying to run Tristan Thompson and Daniel Theis at the same time this last year.
Tristan thompson is one of the most famous NBA players
"Yeah, but again, we're comparing them to Fournier, who played sixteen games for us, and Tristan Thompson, who actively made our offense worse every time he stepped on the court. If we get *anything* out of Dunn, that's an upgrade, although honestly I don't think we're keeping him once trades start back up  Also, for what it's worth, I don't think Dunn's unplayable when healthy, but... yeah, his health is *really* worrying."
"Meh. I'll take Horford, Richardson, and Dunn over 40 games of Kemba, 16 games of Fournier, and literally any amount of Tristan Thompson in a heartbeat."
Might get that Tristan Thompson money if he shows up in the playoffs.
I mean Tristan Thompson is from Brampton
"These guys all looking for Lebron to get them paid.  See JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Timofey Movgov, Matthew Dellavedova, Kantavious Caldwell-Pope, and Alex Caruso for more information."
"I will always believe that if Khem Birch (or Tristan Thompson) were on Canada's team this summer, we would've qualified for the Olympics.  Dwight Powell, Trey Lyles and Andrew Nicholson are fine players, but none of them are know for their defence.  We were abused down low in all of the games.  A tough, physical post defender would've changed everything."
"&gt; I feel like young developing players always have a hard time taking a backseat to Lebron though.  Tristan Thompson had his best years with Bron. Kyrie learned how to win. AD learned how to win. THT played great. Caruso got better. Daniel Gibson shot 40% with Bron.  There are plenty of players who played Great with Lebron. That's why he's known for elevating the play of his team mates. Kuzma/Lonzo just don't fit well with Bron. Ingram played great his last year with Bron, and would have kept playing great if we could have kept him over Kuz."
That didn't stop Brampton Mans HOFer Tristan Thompson
Tristan Thompson is from near Toronto and he knocked up a Kardashian.  It aint stopping real ones 😤
Tristan Thompson made it work in Cleveland
"SGA, RJ Barrett, Jamal Murray, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Dillon Brooks, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Brandon Clarke, Dwight Powell, Kelly Olynyk. Thats a playoff team. Name 5 countries that can match that talent output. The only thing holding this team back is injuries. Don't be surprised when Canada becomes a legitimate medal threat."
Is nobody going to acknowledge that Tristan Thompson isn’t even on the Celtics anymore but OP says he’s washed??
"They are good examples, but JR Smith and Tristan Thompson are represented by Rich Paul and the Cavs were in the midst of doing everything possible to keep LeBron happy. I think them sharing the same agent (whom LeBron may or may not have self-interest with outside of his own contract) with James played an outsized role in their deals."
"Jordan, Kobe, LeBron, Curry, Shaq, Yao, and maybe Tristan Thompson unironically."
"To be honest, the move *probably* works on most teams in the NBA. Most teams aren’t able to turn around and get Westbrook plus a bunch of solid guys on the min. Not quite the same contract, but Marcus Morris was able to pull together 4/64 from the Clippers, they were over the cap, had his bird rights, and either had to pay up or lose him for nothing. Tristan Thompson and JR Smith with the Cavs as well. Schroder assumed ‘lose me for nothing’ was enough leverage to be a no go for a title contending team. I feel like he could have pulled a Spencer Dinwiddie contract somewhere if he saw the writing on the wall early enough."
Could team USA have gotten PJ Tucker? What about Drummond? Tristan Thompson?
"RJ- ""LeBron didn't have as much help as MJ""  MJs Teammates:  Scottie Pippen 17.7 ppg 7x all star Dennis Rodman 5.2 ppg 15.3 rpg 2x all star Horace Grant 12.6 ppg 1x all star Steve Kerr 8.2 ppg Toni Kukoc 14.1 ppg  LBJs Teammates: Dwyane Wade 22.7 ppg 13x all star Anthony Davis 23.9 ppg 8.6 rpg 8x all star Kyrie Irving 21.6 ppg 6x all star Chris Bosh 18 ppg 11x all star Ray Allen 10.3 ppg 10x all star Zydrunas Ilgauskas 13.8 ppg 2x all star  Honorable mentions because these guys were important pieces on championship teams: JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Rajon Rando, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Howard"
"Everybody’s a hot commodity until they join the “king” and fuck up in a game. Then they become garbage.  See Jr Smith, he never got another contact ever since he fucked up that one time.   However, if you sign with Klutch then you’re guaranteed a big bag no matter how trash you are (see Tristan Thompson)"
"He left George Hill, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Love. What a dickhead"
Tristan Thompson???
I've heard it could also somehow involve the Celtics/Hawks/Kings trade with Tristan Thompson and Delon Wright somehow. There's been no talk about Schroder's contract and no talk about why the Hield-to-the-Lakers trade fell apart so it's at least consistent with the idea that Schroder is still somehow involved.
Hawks Tristan Thompson
"&gt;How’s that even possible? Any chance Beal is involved?  No reason for the Wizards to sign Dinwiddie if they're trading Beal and rebuilding.  I'm guessing it's an expansion of the Russ trade, so includes Wizards, Brooklyn, Lakers, might even loop in the Celtics with their stalled Tristan Thompson to the Kings trade. And Miami has been hella active this off season so throw them and the Raptors in there too with the Lowry/Dragic sign and trade. OKC somehow always ends up in these to grab a pick as well"
Unknown Reason: Tristan Thompson wants to go to the strip clubs in Atlanta
Isn't he in the Tristan Thompson trade? He was gone regardless of us figuring out the details.
I thought there was a Tristan Thompson + Langford for Rubio trade to be made earlier in the offseason before those moves happened.
Tristan Thompson and JR Smith as well.
"Ontario Canada would give them a run:  Jamal Murray, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson, Rick Fox, Jamal Magloure, Sim Bhullar, James Naismith."
And Tristan Thompson got $80+ mil
"I love the idea of getting a player from another team with the Richardson trade exception to get Dragic. Who would be the candidates? Lamb, Aminu, Tristan Thompson, Derrick Jones, D. Jordan?"
"You think he signed off on letting Caruso go? You think he’s trying to save Jeanie Buss money? Did you see how he leveraged Dan Gilbert into overpaying guys like Tristan Thompson, JR Smith and Iman Shumpert?  You either got something super duper planned or there’s issues in Lakerland. It’s never a good look when the owner is trying to stay out of the tax while claiming to be a win now team. It doesn’t add up."
"Celtics players missed the most games due to covid , hell tristan thompson alone was in protocol at least 3 times alone"
"Watch that series. That motherfucker moved the nine other players on the court around like chess pieces. He slowed the game to crawl and micromanaged every play. It was mesmerizing to watch. I’ve never seen a player take control of every aspect of the game like that.   He made the finals competitive with a big three of him, Matthew Delavdova and Tristan Thompson. What he did in that series is more impressive than the 3-1 comeback."
"I think the prospect of sending him to Sacramento for something like Harrison Barnes, Tyrese Halliburton, and Tristan Thompson maybe led Morey and Rivers to reassess the situation."
"&gt; Is this a serious question...?   Yes, it is.  &gt;John Wall  He was not overpaid, he was one of the best PGs in the league when he signed that contract. The fact that he later got injured has nothing to do with the pay his agent got him during the last negotiations.  &gt;Ben Simmons  Ben is on a completely standard max extension for a player who is a number 1 pick, ROTY and All-Star. He would have gotten that exact same contract from any team, with any agent.   &gt;Lonzo Ball  You think so? Hollinger expected him to get a contract starting at $25 million a year, and he ended up on $18 million. Most reporters considered around $18 million to be the floor for Ball.   &gt;Eric Bledsoe  Really? What do you feel he's worth? He's on a two year contract, with only the first year fully guaranteed. He's making about half of what a max contract would be for his seniority. Seems about right where he should be.   &gt;Gary Trent jr  I reckon that's a bit early to say. If he keeps developing from how he played last year, he's a bargain on a contract that starts on $16 million. But he's a 22 year old kid coming off a rookie contract, so his career can obviously go in any direction still.   Overpaid, though? I bet a lot of teams would be happy to pay that for a 22 year old shooting almost 40% from 3PT, averaging 16 ppg.   &gt;KCP  Nah, man. His first contract with the Lakers was obviously an overpay, and entirely a bribe job for enticing LeBron to sign. However, his current contract is perfectly reasonable on the performance he's put up. Pretty average player making pretty average money, who signed an extension with a team that was salary capped and couldn't replace him if they let him go.  Anyway, like I said, Rich can get players paid when he can hold LeBron's weight over the head of the FO, which is exactly what happened in KCP's case.  &gt;Terrence Ross  Average player on an average contract. His base year salary was roughly 1.3 times the MLE, that's what he should be making.   &gt;Tristan Thompson  TT's current contract is at the MLE, which is where it should be. He's still a solid defensive player who can put up a few buckets on decent efficiency. That's what the MLE gets you.  His previous contract was an obvious overpay, but again, that's the LeBron effect, and the fact that the Cavs being capped out, they literally had no choice but to re-sign him.   &gt;JR Smith  Again, LeBron-cast signing. The Cavs have no choice but to sign him, as they can't replace him with the lack of cap space.   &gt;Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals.  It seems rather that your argument is that NBA salaries are too high, rather than these specific players being overpaid."
"De'Aaron Fox, Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Ben Simmons, Richaun Holmes.   Terence Davis, Louis King, Mo Harkless, Chimezie Metu, Tristan Thompson."
"Is this a serious question...?   John wall, Ben Simmons, Lonzo ball, Eric bledsoe, Gary Trent jr, KCP, Terrence Ross, Tristan Thompson, tht.  Basically the only people that aren't overpaid are lebron, AD, and the guys still on rookie or vet min deals."
Delon is already gone. Sent out to get Tristan Thompson when it wasn’t clear whether we’d be able to retain Holmes.
"If I was set to fry in the electric chair, and was for some bizarre reason told ""you can pick 1 NBA big man and if he can't come up with a single post move he can execute properly even with no defense, you'll be pardoned"", then I would pick Tristan Thompson and rejoice in my freedom as I watched him bounce the ball off his foot and out of bounds trying a drop-step against air."
"I just listed a few.  There were metric tons of players that went during those years that they could have lucked into outside of Waiters, Tristan Thompson, Anthony Bennet, and Wiggins. I give them a pass on Wiggins. Kyrie was uncontested number 1. MAYBE basing your scouting only off of hype/popularity isn't the way to pick players. If a casual can navigate the draft then certainly I can hold an org accountable for being absolute TRASH when given a unique opportunity to create a dynastic team."
"I don't understand how anyone could watch Tristan Thompson play basketball and think ""we should use the 4th pick on this guy."""
You don’t remember Wiggins because he never played for the Cavs. He was traded to Minnesota for Kevin Love.  Obviously Bennett wasn’t a good pick.  Kyrie was obviously a good pick.  Tristan Thompson while maybe not what you hope from a #4 overall was a contributor for a championship team.
Tristan Thompson has made more than Michael Jordan in NBA salary.   Actual Goat? /s
He's a socialite. Imagine a Kardashian making fun of him for not shooting like Devin Booker or worse than Tristan Thompson. That'd be hell for him.
I just see Tristan Thompson
Looks like Tristan Thompson tbh
"""We're still four-time Eastern Conference champions, so until you take us down from that, teams ain't got much to say,"" Thompson said. ""Boston, Philly, they ain't got much to say. Boston had home court Game 7 and lost. Philly, you guys almost got swept. Toronto — we already know that story. So until someone takes us down, there's not much they can really say."" Tristan Thompson before the Cavs went 19-63"
"Sacramento  Bagley, hield and Tristan Thompson for John Wall and every pick the Rockets ever had. Even picks from the past.   Then Sacramento buys out Wall who also joins Brooklyn.  And the kings sell to a group in Seattle for the rest of Mozgovs contract and a Subway Sandwich."
"The Tristan Thompson, Shumpert &amp; Nets pick for ""insert superstar"" that were all over the internet on every basketball forum a few years ago.  The Kuzma, Caldwell-Pope, Harrell, etc. for ""insert star"" proposals that have been everywhere for the past year were almost as bad.  The sign &amp; trade proposals for Schroder were annoying as well."
"Effort and athletecism are not sustainable when age makes the player slower and every year younger  faster players enter the league. There needs to be some elite NBA skill to sustain the career when athletecism starts to slip. Otherwise you just stop being an NBA caliber player.   Fareid is also in the archetype of big that loses value VERY quickly when they lose a step. (Undersized and unable to shoot or create offense). Tristan Thompson and Clint Capela come to mind, though Capela was good this year so we'll see if that was a short-term fluke."
"Tristan Thompson the goat, career playoffs leader in offensive rating by a mile"
"I liked what I saw from Damian Jones last year tbh, but that might be because I was comparing him to Whiteside. He brings some good size and gives effort on both ends, which is what a want from a 2nd/3rd string big.  I think there's a chance we trade Tristan Thompson if we can."
"Injuries ruined his career, he could've been a solid Tristan Thompson type in the NBA"
This is a good one. My girlfriend and all her friends know Tristan Thompson but would have no idea who Giannis is
I believe he outrebounded Tristan Thompson in the finals one year
"Yes he was. He came back during the OKC series but was a shell of himself. He was literally unguardable before, once he came back he made Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson look like Scottie Pippen-level perimeter defenders. He could barely move out there."
"You mean cp3 the dude who’s choked almost every time lmao   Lowry the known playoff beast   Horford, the guy who got outplayed by Tristan Thompson   I’m not comparing, i just found it funny u use THAT as the knock against the young guns when it clearly is where they thrive"
Tristan Thompson is a better scorer than Lebron in the finals because he has a higher FG%
"No one makes it to the nba and becomes 1st team all defense and an all star without hard work. But hard work doesn't always pay off. Also, the players in nba history who switched their shooting hands didn't see some giant leap in shooting efficiency, Tristan Thompson being the most recent example."
Alternative title : Tristan Thompson lazy defensive rotation after gambling to steal the ball and failing.
Tristan Thompson casually jogging back.
"Similarly, Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson were both drafted the same, although one of those picks was from a trade I believe"
"No, you just said he’d be Tristan Thompson. And if you truly believe Hollins had it harder than Bill Russell you are straight delusional."
"The solid proof is there if you just watch Russell, which it seems you’ve never done. Russell was one of the best athletes in NBA history, a legitimate track and field superstar. He was faster and could jump higher than 99% of the league today. Anyone ever called Tristan Thompson a great athlete? Seriously, watch some film on Russell and just watch his athleticism and then tell me “yeah that TT”"
"See, I don't even think there's solid proof he wouldn't be Tristan Thompson today. Where's that video of Mitchell Robinson or Andre Drummond maybe playing against guys in pickup and he legitimately looks better than prime Lebron. You become SO much better against worse players and SO much worse against good players.   It's literally impossible to tell. I'm not saying that would be true, I'm just saying it's literally impossible to know because all of these NBA players can really fucking hoop and the only reason they look bad is because they're against other NBA players."
They didn't run Tristan Thompson off the court. You think he's a better defender than Ben Wallace?
"What the fuck is with all these people going “hurr durr you think he’d be a bum today?!?!!?” whenever someone brings up how shit the 50s and 60s NBA was? Nobody is saying that Bill Russell would be Tristan Thompson today, they’re saying that the 11 championships aren’t as impressive as they seem. Michael Jordan’s six championships in eight years is infinitely more impressive than the entirety of Russell’s championship runs with the Celtics."
"Can one make the argument that the Warriors would have survived in 2019 if the Warriors, in fact, did not survive in 2019?     I'm sure you're checking the rest of the thread too, so I would suggest checking Shaq's Finals averages from the 3peat.  26 and 12 is not 38 and 17.     If 4 matchups against the Cavs is considered physical then we have different definitions.  Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson might scare you but they don't scare me."
"Jayson Tatum.  He's trash compared to people's opinion of him, especially Celtics fans. He takes bad shots And a lot of them. He doesn't create good looks for his team mates. He takes away team mates opportunities. He's far too inconsistent, which again hurts the team, is he gonna shoot 3/20 tonight and get blown out by the Bulls, hit 3/15 and lose to the Wizards or go 20/30 and beat the Nets, who knows just roll a dice. Guess his teammates just hope Tatum pops off? Cause they aren't getting enough ball to get any rhythm going if he doesn't.  The more the Celtics rely on Tatum, and the less they have other players on court taking and creating shots the worse they do. I swear the Celtics roster should perform better every season, but they do worse year on year.  I also think that the way Tatum plays, he makes the players around him worse, like the opposite of the CP3 effect. Like for example, Evan Fornier joins the team and goes from scoing 19ppg to 13ppg despite the fact his shooting percentages went up. On the flip side, Thies had the opposite effect, he moved to the Bulls and his PPG went up, despite his 2pt% staying the same and his 3pt% going down... Look at everyone else who joined this team? Tristan Thompson went from 12ppg to 7ppg, Kemba went from 26ppg to 19ppg. Who could forget scary Terry? MF went from 9ppg to 20ppg. No player has joined this team and gotten better and all of them who left suddenly improved and everyone acts like it's a God damn mystery. Everyone just forgot the fact Rozier got a massive pay day? Dude looked great, but just never got his chance, and guess what he balled out when he was given the chance. If it wasn't predictable why did the Hornets pay him so much and let Kemba walk?   As Tatum's usage rate goes from 10% to 30%, the Celtics go from a Win % of 70% to 50%... Despite what everyone expected was to be the Celtics getting stronger every season due to their high draft stock and already strong roster with guys like Brown, Smart, Irving/Walker, while the team had Hayward on the roster taking the bulk of the salary space AND being out with injury.  He's a great player, with great potential, but his game has major floors which need to be fixed. He's an above average player, on an okay team. But jesus people suck him off like he's in MVP contention despite only going 36-36 with a very decent surrounding cast.   Like if you said to me 2 years ago, there will be a team with: Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, an All NBA calibur player, Jaylen Brown, Tristan Thompson starting and a bench of Fornier, Teague,  Parker, Williams and Thies, I'd say holy shit that's a top 4 team. But no just 7th in the East, 36-36 record. What?"
"They extended Tristan Thompson and JR Smith Klutch client which they shouldn't, but those are Lebron guys who didn't do much to be edge players. They got paid with that unbelievable comeback to be in history book for 2016 chip."
Superior offensively but Tristan Thompson was negated. Iirc he was nursing some injury after 2016 while GS really made a concerted effort to gang rebound moving forward so the Cavs barely had any advantage left.
"That’s because the Cavs relegated him to the corner thanks to Tristan Thompson. They took a top player in the league and said stop doing what you do, do this instead. Unfortunate af for him in the long run."
I truly can’t wait to see which spots Kuz decides to frequent around here. I’ll never forget when Tristan Thompson got caught cheating on Khloe and I found out it was in this shit ass hookah lounge near my house lol. Just totally bewildered that an nba player would’ve ever had a reason to go there.
"Kings: starting Buddy &amp; Bagley to keep their trade value up.   Starters: Fox, Buddy, Barns, Bagley, Holmes.   Bench: Davion, Haliburton, Terrance Davis, MO Harkless, Tristan Thompson/Alex Len.   Closing: Fox, Haliburton, Davion, Barns, Holmes.  (Maybe Buddy for Davion)."
Tristan Thompson
Tristan Thompson
"Kawhi, Kyrie and Klay are pretty much locks for HOF I think. Butler has a chance if he wins a championship before the end of his career. So yeah makes sense. 2018 at this moment is definitely weaker, but then again it’s only been 3 years. Luka is definitely going to be a HOFer, Trae too most likely. Maybe Ayton, but don’t think it’ll surpass 2011, that year also had players with high peaks like IT, Kemba, Vuc and other solid players like Morris twins, Tobias Harris, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas etc. Pretty deep draft with some top talent."
That Tristan Thompson poster was something else. Hope Bruce gets him playing with that type of aggression again
"Oh right, they got Tristan Thompson with their own pick."
"Lol I love the angle you took at this. I actually think the Warriors would have won in 2017 without KD if you replaced him with Barnes. This is with the faulty assumption that the rest of the roster remained the same. Warriors struggled with the Cavs' physicality in 2015 and 2016, especially when it came to rebounding. Zaza did a much better job than Bogut in this particular matchup. Both him and West were huge acquisitions that helped the Warriors match the physicality and rebounding of the Cavs. Tristan Thompson couldn't be stopped in 2015 and 2016, but he was a non-factor in 2017. KD wasn't the reason for that."
Yes but Love was an all star who averaged 8 points that series. The Cavs won the game he missed. He was able to rebound but he was basically a shittier Tristan Thompson against the Warriors healthy or otherwise. Meanwhile “worst offensive all star of all time” Draymond dropped 32 in game 7 and would have been MVP if the Warriors won
"3 team trade idea that Kings fans will probably get mad about:  Golden State Warriors: Ben Simmons, Damian Jones (for salary purposes)  Philadelphia 76ers: Harrison Barnes, Buddy Hield, GSW 1st round pick  Sacramento Kings: Draymond Green, Shake Milton, Kevon Looney (for salary purposes), 2 GSW 2nd round picks  **Why the Warriors do it**:  I think everybody agrees that Ben Simmons is the best Draymond Green successor the Warriors could possibly find in terms of style of play. Everything the Warriors have done the last 2 offseasons has been about trying to extend their window of contention for as long as possible, and this move is in a similar vein. Furthermore, Draymond Green is going to suffer age related decline faster than most players, and as he gets older is going to be more of a 5 than a 4, and the Warriors remain committed to James Wiseman. This move undoubtedly makes them worse in the short term as Draymond is a better player than Ben Simmons, but the Warriors don't seem to care that much about the upcoming season, evidenced by them being very conservative with Klay.   **Why the Sixers do it**  This move is all about maximizing fit and spacing around Joel Embiid. This move unlocks Tyrese Maxey and clears the way for him to be the starting point guard. Their starting 5 becomes Maxey/Hield/Barnes/Harris/Embiid with Seth Curry a strong contender to win 6MOY. That starting 5 has lots of shooting to surround Embiid, and in Barnes, they get the wing defender to replace Simmons as well as a solid 16-18 PPG scorer, and in Hield, they get the 3-point sniper that Embiid can run the lethal DHO actions with, something he had great success with when he played with JJ Redick.   **Why the Kings do it**  Alright, I admit this one is kind of a hard sell. But hear me out. Draymond Green is still a more valuable and better player than Harrison Barnes, and is a better fit around the young backcourt that Sacramento is trying to build around with Fox and Haliburton. Sacramento was the #30 defense in the league last year by Cleaning the Glass, and they could use a still DPOY caliber player on that end of the floor, as well as a vocal leader, much more than they need Harrison Barnes' ISO scoring. Draymond can be the necessary bad cop to Luke Walton's good cop.   As for Buddy Hield, his role on the team has been marginalized with every passing year, and has been in trade rumors for years, at this point the Kings want off his contract as he is their 4th guard and they get Shake Milton from the Sixers to be said 4th guard and lead the bench along with rookie Davion Mitchell. This move does leave them light at the 3 as Terence Davis(?) becomes their starter at that position. However, they would have a lot of shot creation in their backcourt (Fox, Haliburton, Mitchell, Shake), and the requisite intelligent defensive bigs to complement them with Draymond, Holmes, and Tristan Thompson as the backup 5. They also pickup a valuable 3rd string center in Kevon Looney.  This move is made by the Kings with an eye towards trying to compete for the playoffs NOW by getting a proven leader and defensive presence in the team, and let's not forget that Draymond Green shoots 3s well when Steve Kerr is not the coach of the team, evidenced by his outrageous run at the start of the 2016 season under current Kings coach Luke Walton, and in the 2017 playoffs when Mike Brown was the interim coach."
Idk why people add Kerr and Longley whenever they name Jordans stacked teammates. Those guys are literally just solid role players. It's like naming Kyle Korver and Tristan Thompson among LeBron's loaded teams
Sacramento Kings: Tristan Thompson also...
"Although Mozgov was the second scorer, I'd argue Tristan Thompson was their second best player. He may have scored less than Love, but he is such a negative on defense that I'd prefer TT.   Also, Love was really really bad against Indiana and Boston."
He is worth it specifically to that team. Like Tristan Thompson for 80 mill on the cavs  But I get ur point your right as well dude 🤝
"&gt;And his agent now is Rich Paul. And he got the midlevel.  Yea cause nobody is getting swindled again for fucking Tristan Thompson, lol."
"Yeah sure, but Tristan Thompson, JR Smith and few other overpaid players would agree"
Ben Simmons and Tristan Thompson on the Kings would be nice...
"He got stitches of hair implants, though, as Tristan Thompson can attest to."
How is losing Kemba Tristan Thompson and Fournier for Horford and Schroeder a B-?
"George Thompson, David Thompson Klay Thompson Tristan Thompson mychal Thompson"
Just look at poor Tristan Thompson
KD was always a super nice kid and so was Tristan Thompson when they used to come into my bar to do a weekly UT basketball radio show we hosted at the bar. Quiet but super respectful and demure. They both ALWAYS walked behind coach Rick Barnes and always looked at him for permission before eating or drinking or talking with people.
I mean not to stereotype but Tristan Thompson is Canadian.
"I've met LeBron before. He's pretty douchey but puts on a great face for the cameras and the kids. This was when he went back to Cleveland. On the other hand Tristan Thompson was super friendly, which may come as a surprise to a lot of people.   Giannis on the other hand, is one of the nicest people I've ever met. The only nicer NBA player I've met is Cory Joseph.   On a random note, Joe Young who had a cup of coffee for the NBA players is a real douche, and Avery Bradley is pretty douchey as well."
"Tristan Thompson probably the best bet for me. Think my only choices are TT, Anthony Bennett or Tyler Ennis. TT holding it down for Brampton off court though"
He was not a top 3 player on the Cavs during the 2016 finals. Tristan Thompson and Jr Smith outplayed him.
Tristan Thompson thought he had Curry on height till he got outdone on the boards in the finals   /s but I had to drop it as one of my favorite Steph facts lmao
"Nurkic defended Simmons over a Kevin O'Connor tweet just a few weeks ago. Plus, it seems everyone at Klutch now gets along. Hell, even Tristan Thompson and Draymond got over their beef when Draymond signed with Klutch."
"&gt;I agree with some of the general sentiments VisionGuard brought up but I do not understand this Tristan Thompson comparison at all.   &gt;   &gt;Horace was the third option on those Bulls teams whereas Thompson was pretty much an afterthought. Thompson also never averaged double figures in any of the seasons where the Cavaliers were championship contenders. Really weird comparison to make.  I'm literally saying that Horace's career numbers are the same as Tristan Thompson's.  That's a verifiable fact.  Generally speaking, when someone is a teammate of Jordan, we tend to say something like ""his statistics don't count the way they do for everyone else - indeed, he was so much better, even though, again, we would not make such a claim were he to be the teammate of someone else, since well, those are the numbers, but again, that doesn't count so long as he's a teammate of Jordan"".    My point is, while that's fine to do, we tend to *also* over mythologize those players and most people don't even know these sorts of easily checkable facts.  Horace's career numbers are basically those of Tristan Thompson's."
Because he instilled the prima donna and entitled culture to Ben Simmons. Ben doesn’t listen and feel like he’s above everyone else already so he doesn’t put much effort into improving. Same with Rich Paul. He thinks highly of himself but his highest achievement is being a friend of LeBron. Any agent could get AD and LeBron level players a max. The only overpay he ever negotiated was Tristan Thompson but only because LeBron was still there with the Cavs so they had no choice really but to obey. Rich Paul is a non-essential. The players are there for the LeBron platform and connection.
"What I dislike about Rich Paul is his association to LeBron. Despite that Rich Paul is his own person, he has the reputation of representing clients who will eventually play for LeBron. So the idea that a player on your favorite team will to play with LeBron is worrisome for fans.  Rich Paul also has built a rep of  providing his client's with the most money possible. For example, he was able to get Tristan Thompson a very good deal because the Cavs would not be able to replace Thompson. The Cavs would risk LeBron leaving if Thompson didn't get paid. Rich Paul got Thompson paid and he benefited by representing LeBron's client. Good for players, but not good for fans.  I definitely think rich Paul is deserving of repoint NBA players regardless of his degree status or whatever people mention. His credentials speak for themselves. He now represents a lot of players that aren't afiliated with LeBron or the Lakers, but there is still the feeling that a player represented by rp will go to LeBron's team."
I agree with some of the general sentiments VisionGuard brought up but I do not understand this Tristan Thompson comparison at all.  Horace was the third option on those Bulls teams whereas Thompson was pretty much an afterthought.

"&gt;he was not Kevin Mchale but also was above the ""good role player"" thresshold of someone like steve kerr  He has basically the same stats as Tristan Thompson.  Like, uh, sure."
Rich Paul was selling dreams to mid-level guys. He’s only good at negotiating if Bron is on the team already (i.e. Tristan Thompson)
"idk about that these are just the top 14 behind LeBron  2. Anthony Davis – Los Angeles Lakers, PF/C  3. Ben Simmons – Philadelphia 76ers, PG  4. Trae Young – Atlanta Hawks, PG  5. John Wall – Washington Wizards, PG  6. Eric Bledsoe – Milwaukee Bucks, PG  7. Draymond Green – Golden State Warriors, PF  8. Miles Bridges – Charlotte Hornets, SF  9. Markieff Morris – Los Angeles Lakers, SF/PF  10. Dejounte Murray – San Antonio Spurs, PG/SG  11. J.R. Smith – Unrestricted Free Agent, SG  12. Marcus Morris – Los Angeles Clippers, SF/PF  13. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope – Los Angeles Lakers, SG  14. Tristan Thompson – Cleveland Cavaliers, PF/C  15. Trey Lyles – San Antonio Spurs, SF"
"Their clients are AD, Simmons, Trae Young, wall, Bledsoe, Draymond, Mikal, Kief, dejounte Murray, Jr, Marcus Morris, KCP, Tristan Thompson, Lyles, Harrel, and a whole bunch of other role players   Please tell me which of these have been an enormous win for the Lakers or Cavs"
Everything is centered around LeBron. He wants Noel to sign a minimum with LAL and then re-sign with them at bigger deal (ala Tristan Thompson).  Signing with Minnesota or Philadelphia does LeBron no good.          He also doesn't him going to another team like Houston that could hurt their chances at winning a title.
"Tristan Thompson was probably still their best defender in the finals. He was picking up Curry in the P&amp;R, causing turnovers in the paint, and boxing out everyone on the boards"
"Even then Tristan Thompson was a pretty darn good defensive big. He wasn't a great shot blocker or anything, but the dude was more than capable of switching onto guys like Steph and Klay and defend them well. Sabonis isn't anywhere near TT's defensive level."
Stephen Curry has blurry vision. He also out-rebounded Tristan Thompson in the 2017 &amp; 2018 Finals
Rich is a fantastic agent if you're a player who can utilize Bron's leverage. That essentially just means AD and Tristan Thompson. And I'm pretty sure a mentally challenged monkey could get AD a max contract.
"Yes, that is absolutely what he has done.  Sometimes it's win-win (Tristan Thompson), but when loyalties conflict there's zero doubt of whose interests come first - and it ain't guys like Noel hustling for a contract."
"Steph,Klay, and Draymond were the 7th,11th, 35th picks in the draft. GSW front office acquired KD in free agency. Cavs front office acquired Lebron in free agency. Along with a 1 pick (Kyrie), another 1 pick(Bennett), another 1 pick(Wiggins/Love), and whatever high number pick Tristan Thompson was. The Cavs clearly were the ones in position to build a superior team"
"Anthony Davis, Ben Simmons, Trae Young, John Wall, Eric Bledsoe, Anthony Edwards, Draymond Green, Miles Bridges, Markieff Morris, Dejounte Murray, Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Tristan Thompson, Trey Lyles, Cory Joseph, Darius Bazley, Malik Beasley, Jordan Clarkson, Darius Garland, Montrezl Harrell, Talen Horton-Tucker, Ben McLemore, Jusuf Nurkic, Mitchell Robinson, Tyrese Maxey, Moses Moody, Gary Trent Jr.  I'd say they're doing okay."
Only time I remember him getting a client paid more than they’re worth is Tristan Thompson. But that was more a perfect storm of a LBJ team+have to win now/not lose him.
Tristan Thompson JR Smith Here's the whole list: https://basketball.realgm.com/info/agent-client-list/Rich-Paul/258
The same top rebounder Tristan Thompson who got out rebounded by Steph curry
Those numbers aren’t the great when you consider how awful at defender he was. 15/6 is not a good look for a near-max player.  Now pull up his stats for the other playoffs. Dude rarely played at the all-star level people claim he was. JR and Tristan Thompson often outperformed him.
"That and Love didn’t have the ability to play the 5 like Bosh did. A large part of Cleveland’s problem was that they were paying a shitload of money to Lebron, Love, and Tristan Thompson who were all best utilized at the 4. Also, I think Love was a better player when he had the extra weight."
"gotta love a compilation that starts out in an exhibition game against a CBA team and features stale clips (Tristan Thompson is on the Cavs for one of those shots, Vucevic is on the Magic for another) and features two pointless 3s at the end of the game when the Sixers have already lost.  Good to see that much like Ben Simmons, this clip is resting on its laurels of ""accomplishments"" from years gone by and doesn't show up under pressure"
I am shocked Tristan Thompson isn't on the list
"He was still a pretty exceptional rebounder during the LeBron years here. He wasn’t pulling down 12-15 a night like he did in Minny but he was also playing next to another top rebounder in Tristan Thompson.   Love lost quite a bit of weight since his top years in Minnesota, and I think it made it harder for him to bang down low on offense. He still had the skills, but why would he be anything but the third option playing alongside Bron and Kyrie"
"15 PPG could be good for a 3rd option, if they are scored efficiently.  Pair that with bad defense and that isn’t a good 3rd best player on one’s championship contender, which Love wasn’t in the 2016 playoffs because JR Smith and Tristan Thompson were both better basketball players for that run.  Bosh had to make similar sacrifices to his offensive game alongside LeBron and Wade as Love did with LeBron and Kyrie, but he was still having a star level impact on the game because of the other half of basketball."
"&gt;I'm curious if any Celtics fans can tell me how he's so efficient  he doesn't force it, either. he looks to pass if the shot isn't there. he's no tristan thompson/andre drummond"
When is the deadline for the QO? Sometime in September? I remember Tristan Thompson dragging out his RFA out and him getting paid but he had LeGM on his team.
* Jamal Murray Gets Brain * Tristan Thompson Cheats Raw * King James' Royal Staff * Nick Young: A D'Angelo Russell Joint * Gilbert Arenas Punks Nick Young
"Lebron is an incredible rebounder because of his sense of how the ball will come off the rim. He is significantly better at literally every piece of basketball than TT, so that doesn’t shock me at all. He also plays 38 minutes a night since he was 18. If you’re trying to defend your arguments in the future, think of someone better than the miserable Tristan Thompson to compare people to 😂"
"But he crushed the rockets in 5 games in 2015? He crushed the Blazers in 2016, 17, 19. He helped close off game 7 against the thunder. He crushed the spurs in 2017. He crushed the cavs in 2017 almost averaging a triple double outrebounding their starting center (LOL tristan thompson sucks but still). Talk about not showing up in the playoffs amirite lol"
"The east runs through the cavs, Tristan Thompson was just a couple years off"
thats that Tristan Thompson quality
"The main difference being that Anthony Davis is a vastly better basketball player than Scottie Pippen.  If Jordan fans gassed up Mo Will, Tristan Thompson,  etc. that would be one thing. But let's not act like AD hasn't been a perennial 1st Team all NBA guy, MVP candidate, DPOY candidate and put up monster 28/12/4/4 seasons in NOP."
Tristan Thompson would like a word with you.
"I would say he definitely has tremendous influence.  Kind of like how he basically got his buddy Tristan Thompson a max contract in Cleveland.  Tristan Thompson?????   The ""win now"" attitude with the Lakers in acquiring the big contracts of AD and Westbrook has GUTTED the Lakers of their young talent (Randle, Lonzo, Ingram, etc.) as well as their future #1 picks for years.     Just like the Cavs were left in shambles when LeBron left, in a couple years when LeBron/Westbrook are gone and AD is playing on one leg, unless a couple of young stars want to team up and come to the Lakers, they will have the potential to suck for a long time.  At least the Cavs had some #1 picks to start a rebuild.  Not the Lakers."
Tristan Thompson going from surprisingly really valuable in the 2016 Finals to completely and utterly unplayable in the 2017 Finals is one of the weirdest things I've seen happen in the league.
"Imagine a player that gets who when he's in the entire gameplan is to switch everything until you get him, iso, and score by default.  Rinse and repeat.  Every single time.  That's Marvin Bagley.  He gets targeted to a hilarious degree. The defense breaks in a matter of seconds, no matter if he's playing 4 or 5. Mo Harkless may not be a sexy name and Tristan Thompson may clank bunnies off the rim.  Neither of them may have the (inefficient) raw stats of Bagley, but they keep the train chugging along with a base level of defensive competence.   Bagley breaks the offense 7 times out of 10 with selfish, black-hole habits, and breaks the defense within 30 seconds 10 times out of 10."
Tristan Thompson will never outrebound Steph again in their matchups lol.   Holmes is still underrated for what he can bring. D.Mitch better  than what I thought.
tristan thompson and david west 👀
He gave Tristan Thompson an 80 million dollar contract he was never an elite GM
"Well those are all stars but guys who were bench guys or end of the career guys end up getting elevated JR Smith, delladova, Tristan Thompson etc"
"&gt; what ""skill"" does he have? He's really not polished at all.  Watch him from a few years ago, and the skill and polish are glaringly obvious. He was a guy who was posting and attacking good defenders, like Tristan Thompson, Al Horford, even Gobert. Not a guy who looks afraid to post up Deandre Hunter (no offense to Hunter).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRbAdIlNASw  If you showed someone in 2018 the current KP, they'd barely recognize him."
"Shaun Livingston was rail thin compared to most NBA players' physiques, and he could still score on post ups. He couldn't in his early Clippers years, but he was damn near automatic by the time he was a Warrior because it was something he worked on.  KP has clearly regressed - this is a guy who just a few years ago, his eyes would light up if he had Tristan Thompson or Al Horford defending him in the post, and would even go right at Myles Turner or Anthony Davis.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRbAdIlNASw"
Tristan Thompson was notorious for this
Tristan Thompson was close as a rookie 3.1 to 3.4
"Honestly? It was my first reaction to the Tristan Thompson signing this year.  I always thought he was a fame-chasing, slow, unskilled coattail rider- due mostly to being a reach when he was drafted, his Kardashian history and playing alongside Lebron for so long. Though I must admit, I never really paid much attention to his game, that was just the impression of him I got.  But he’s been great as a veteran presence, putting in solid minutes, and been a fantastic locker room dude so far!"
Completely agree. I honestly thought the Tristan Thompson trade was to acquire assets for a secondary trade but he was right about that too. Seems to have been a net positive for this team on and off the court
"""Bro, I make $44M and Buddy makes $23M. You gonna get them to throw in Tristan Thompson and $12M of minimum guys to make the numbers work? Lol good luck."""
Tristan Thompson will do great things for the Sacramento Kings franchise.
"He had little to no value at the trade deadline last year. They decided that giving him another offseason with the coaches was worth more than getting a second round pick. He then came back into camp the exact same player, and immediately got hurt and missed most of the preseason. Thats when the decision to remove him from the rotation was made. He has had pleny of opportunities, and even started over 40 games last year and would have had even more if he wasnt injured like usual.   Marvin isnt in the rotation because he can't stay avaliable and got outplayed and outperformed by Mo Harkless and Tristan Thompson. The fact that his reponse to not being good enough is to whine through his agent/dad/aunt/uncle instead of hitting the gym tells you everything you need to know about this dude.  Sent his ass home until you can trade his deal. You don't cut him as that guarantees his 11 million on your cap and you're gonna need that to make deals at the deadline."
I think that was the game where he got more boards than Tristan Thompson
If he doesn't get much minutes he probably be a distraction to the team.  His ego too big. Terrance Davis is better and len gives size. We have Tristan Thompson and Holmes at center already.  Louis king not getting mins.  Len might not even play on most nights.
"Because the context is Marvin Bagley. In a vacuum sure, Jeff is not a wackadoo. But congratulations about not caring about or not wanting to talk about Marvin Bagley in a thread about Marvin Bagley from Marvin Bagley's agent.   How is it contradictory. The team tried all of last season to build up his value and he instead got hurt a bunch and was generally not good. This off-season he came into camp and got out played by Alex Len and Tristan Thompson so they decided just to shut it down because they understand sunk cost and aren't wasting their time anymore on him. A good trade never materialized and Marvin Bagley never really impressed anyone with his play."
"LOL it's definitely not about pinching pennies. The Kings played better with him off the floor. You can argue that he deserves to be in a 10 man rotation, but just barely. Tristan Thompson is worlds better than him on the Kings' roster if that tells you anything."
You joke but the Kings added a lot of big men in the offseason and if he's getting outplayed by Tristan Thompson and Alex Len then he should be out of the rotation.
"He's behind Tristan Thompson, he's not playing his way into the rotation. He might get a shot if someone gets hurt, but keeping a guy around who you got trade offers for and who has asked out because he might get fringe minutes if some injuries happen is a very weak case."
"It's not Jeff's job to care if Bagley is bad and been outplayed by a mix of Tristan Thompson and Alex Len in training camp. It's not Jeff's job to be fair and realize he's on the bench for a reason. It's also not Jeff's job to care what kind of trade offers were on the table for Bagley and if they were worth it for the team or not. Jeff is doing his job, but that also doesn't mean the Kings necessarily are wrong either."
"Dude has been outplayed by Tristan fucking Thompson. Don't fall into the sunk cost fallacy, he's a bad player and they won't be able to squeeze blood from that stone"
"Of course but time line appears to be:  Kings tried to trade him last year, got ass deals  Kept him in hopes he improves and stays healthy  Didn’t improve, has injured is knee  Looks to have been outplayed by Tristan Thompson   Will be riding the bench now  And now cause his agent is trying to save face he releases this info and now it’s LoL KanGz , wHy dIdnT tHeY TradE hiM?!"
I wonder what potential deals were offered for bags lol.. like a 2024 Spurs second rounder something  I sorta wish Bagley would just shut his ass up and work hard to earn it.. doesn’t seem like he’s doing that because he Should be better than Harkless and Tristan Thompson but fact is he’s not
Harkless and Tristan Thompson. It’s sad but bagley really is worse than those players. Man was getting torched by 2nd round picks in garbage time preseason games
"Tristan Thompson was a slight overpay for a season. But ultimately he was a high value player at his peak, played big minutes, and the east ran through Cleveland."
"Tristan Thompson, Serge Ibaka, Russ, Patrick Ewing, Jokic, Dennis Rodman, Timelord, Al Horford, Clint Capela"
"By that same metric, Tristan Thompson and JaVale McGee were genuine Finals-level starting centers.   He's obviously better than both but being on finals team doesn't mean you should be treated like someone who can carry the team to the finals, which is what you're looking for with a max contract."
"Reminds me of Tristan ""we're still 4 time Eastern Conference Champions"" Thompson quickly realizing they have 0 chance anymore."
Isn't this why Mozgov and Tristan Thompson were massively overpaid?
"And most of the moves made to win that chip wasn’t even thanks to genius thinking on his part:  1. Kyrie. The obvious No. 1 pick in his draft. Dan may be terrible, but even he isn’t that stupid to not pick him. Or that was what we thought until he picked Anthony Bennet 2 years later.   2. Love. A Love-Pick no. 1 (Wiggins) deal wasn’t some genius move Gilbert pulled out. It was already being discussed as a popular trade option the moment the Cavs won the first pick. All Dan had to do was to make the move.   3. Lebron. Cleveland is lucky as hell that this man was willing to come back after the shitshow they put him through. Dan Gilbert had *nothing* to do with this man coming back.   4. Supporting cast. Yes JR and Shumpert were good pickups but nothing too extraordinary. Tristan Thompson developed into a good starting C playing alongside one of the greatest playmakers of all time. Matthew Dellavedova wasn’t signed with “back-up PG on a championship team” mindset, so you can’t praise Dan for that.   And when you compare this to what the Lakers were able to do in the 2019 season alone, Gilbert pales in comparison. Signing guys like Avery Bradley, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Javale McGee, and an *upgrade* in the head coaching staff, and resigning others like Alex Caruso was better than anything Dan Gilbert has accomplished over his 2 Lebron stints *combined.*"
"God, I hate this feeling of hope that crawls back every single year. Ultimately to be crushed 82 games (most of the time, like 15 games in tbh) later.   But this year actually feels different. The team chemistry is amazing. Tristan Thompson was a complete, pleasant surprise, with the way he is buying in and motivating the other guys. Davion is a natural born-killer. Fox bulked up but has shown he still has the speed, and a better looking 3pt shot. The Terrence Davis trade is looking to be highway robbery, getting such a reliable spark-plug off the bench for only a 2nd round pick, AND being able to resign him this summer to a team friendly deal. And Haliburton keeps impressing me day by day.   Can’t wait to be let down again, but at least this year it should be fun, scrappy ball to watch instead of just being 30th in defense and an absolute shit-show on the court."
Tristan Thompson is the vet currently. Definitely making his presence felt. Also I know it sound crazy but Davion Mitchell spending that extra time in college and his work ethic is vet like. He shifted the culture.
"The Wolves top 3 players (KAT, D-Lo, Ant) are better than the Kings top 3 players (Fox, Barnes, Haliburton).   The Kings have better back-end starters. Holmes, Hield, and Mitchell are better than McDaniels, Beasley, and Naz Reid.   The Wolves bench has Taurean Prince, Patrick Beverley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Josh Okogie, Jake Layman, and Leandro Bolmaro.   The Kings bench has Tristan Thompson, Marvin Bagley, Mo Harkless, Terence Davis, Jahmi'us Ramsey, and Neemias Queta.   The Wolves have the better bench.   The Wolves head coach is Chris Finch. The Kings head coach is Luke Walton.   The Wolves have the better head coach.   Based on this, the Wolves are more likely to be successful this season."
"I'm not sure why I'd need to pick between Andre Drummond thinking he's Michael Jordan and Andre Drummond thinking he's Ben Simmons.   Knowing your role is a *huge* part of understanding how to play effective basketball. Cavaliers-era Tristan Thompson was an asset because he tried to play like Tristan Thompson, not LeBron2. Clint Capela is an asset, despite his limitations, because he *knows* those limitations.   There's a reason why we never saw Mavericks-era Tyson Chandler calling for an iso on the wing or Clippers-era DeAndre Jordan looking off Chris Paul following a defensive rebound so he could run point on the break himself. Those guys knew their roles.   Whenever Andre happened to have a game where he was able to limit himself from trying to do all the things he's terrible at, he proved he could be an asset. But more times than not, especially late in his Pistons career, dude just couldn't resist a tasty 3-point attempt or one-on-one dual culminating in an off-balance contested banking runner."
"Meanwhile, Tristan Thompson came in a future “superstar” while he was raw"
"Can't wrap my head around that either, lebron puts you in the best position on the court to shine, making you better, to the point where his teammates get huge contracts.   Tristan Thompson, dellavedova, Jr Smith, mozgov, among many others got paid and they'd all tell you it's thanks to lebron. And kyrie finally gets his due, bc you wanted him to take the shot, he's a much better shooter. Really could've been loved forever in Cleveland.   He just couldn't handle sharing it with lebron. And he couldn't lead the celtics lol"
Yeah he shouldn't be taking fadeaways against Tristan Thompson come on
96-0 Tristan Thompson FMVP
"If Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson speak up in support of Kyrie, we'll have a great 5-man lineup of former Cavs players. Ted Cruz can be head coach."
"Boobie Gibson, Sasha Pavlovic, Drew Gooden, Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, Matthew Dellavedova, Tristan Thompson, Timofey Mozgov, Iman Shumpert, JR Smith, Kyle Kuzma, Talen Horton-Tucker, Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope...  Be lucky to be a member of a LeBron team ---&gt; make three good plays in the playoffs ---&gt; get overpaid for those three plays ---&gt; never sign a big contract or play well ever again."
"For starters, let's keep in mind that there are 150 starters in the league.  Danny Green is 34 years old on the decline of his career being used as a role 3&amp;D player.  He's certainly not top 120.  Jae Crowder averages 10/4/2 on fluctuating efficiency and he's not a starter.  Again, not top 120.  Tristan Thompson is not a starting caliber player and certainly not Top 120.  Reggie and Nerlens are both starting caliber on a handful of teams and they have *fantastic* team friendly deals--the latter to the point that there is a lawsuit about his agent not returning calls.   10-12 million for a legitimate starter is no the norm, and thinking a young player with lots of upside on that is incredibly out of touch.  The fact that you are using Danny Green, Crowder, and Thompson as examples shows how off base that is."
"https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/  Lets see, we got ...   Danny Green Jae Crowder Tristan Thompson Reggie Jackson Nerlens Noel"
"It was most likely going to be Cleveland regardless, but the pick they got from the Clippers turned out to be the no.1 overall pick, and their own draft pick ended up being no.4 which they used to draft Tristan Thompson. If you're interested, the trade was Mo Williams and Jamario Moon to the Clippers for Baron Davis and a first round pick which turned out to be Kyrie."
"Can we all agree that Hield, Davion, Tristan Thompson, and 1+ 1sts is a fair value, in a vacuum? Wonder how far off Daryl and Sactown are"
"Having Fox and Ben on the same team isn’t ideal roster construction since Fox isn’t a great shooter, though he’s improving year on year. But it still improves the team imo   Kings get:   * Ben Simmons   Sixers get:   * Buddy Hield   * Davion Mitchell  * Tristan Thompson   *2022 SAC 1st   I think this helps both teams"
Bro they got Tristan Thompson paid tho
"&gt; You guys  My biggest issue here is that you're acting as if everyone in a fanbase has the same opinion on someone just because they support a certain team.   Just going off of your other replies, maybe that's because you support a player more than a team. Obviously if you support a player you're always supportive of the player? Whereas you can support a team and sometimes dislike players on the team (for example, I never liked Tristan Thompson or Jae Crowder, even when they were on the Celtics)."
"The Kyrie pick was actually an unprotected 1st round pick acquired from the LA Clippers (alongside Baron Davis) for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon. That pick was unprotected and ended up being #1 overall.  The Cavs's own pick was #4, which they used to draft Tristan Thompson."
"Coming from a fan of the team that been good for 7 seasons in 50 years lolol and y’all have the record for most number one picks and still the worst drafting success of any team. In 8 years you had 7 lottery picks and 3 of them are number 1 picks. Drafted Bennett, Tristan Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, passed on Embiid, Kawhi, Giannis, Lavine. The most remarkable thing your teams has done is the [great comeback](https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1588411/).  At some point self awareness is supposed to stop you from making a fool of yourself. But go off."
Tristan Thompson and JR colluded to injure Andrew Bogut in 2016. The finals completely changed after Bogut was injured.
This kinda reminds me when Tristan Thompson still thought the East went through the Cavs after Lebron left
"I think the Kings are definitely on the up and coming for real though, De’Aaron is one of if not the most underrated players in the league and Rese is a great glue guy for a team. Davion, despite the small sample size, is an amazing defender and brings a “dawg” mentality that that team has been missing. Add in Tristan Thompson too, he’s like when Shump was on the team in 2018-19 and they were known as “The Scores”.  Sure, they might not make noise right away, but they are a team to watch out for and if De’Aaron and Rese continue to improve and Davion “Off Night” continues to inspire the team to hustle defensively then “Welcome to Basketball Hell” will be known as a defensive slogan rather than a mocking term. Remember, the Kings have had a Top 10 offense for years, but have consistently been at the bottom of the barrel defensively. Getting “Off Night” could be the missing piece to the puzzle."
"I have no idea who the actual reporter is, but the day before this happened, Tristan Thompson told reporters during his media availability that ""Lebron is a great father figure to us young guys"" kind of in a joking way, basically roasting him for being old.  and then this lady probably read that quote in print, where the lighthearted/jokey nature of the comment might not have been as obvious, and she was curious if kyrie had similar feelings, so she asked him about it the next day.  was the way she asked the question still kind of bumbling/awkward? yes. But its not like it was some random crazy theory out of left field that she just pulled out of thin air and made up herself. It was just a follow up on what his teammate said (granted, a poor follow up)  Hell if she had worded it slightly differently and not completely botched the delivery and used the phrase ""parental role"", she might have gotten a halfway decent answer from him  its really not as batshit insane incident as people make it out to be lol"
"Gilbert is many things, but cheap is not one of them... He ok'd 82million to Tristan Thompson for example"
same Bron that convinced the Cavs into putting $30m/year into bonafide scrubs like JR Smith and Tristan Thompson
This kid has it. He just needs to polish and mold that game and he’ll be amazing. He isn’t afraid to take a shot or go at the rim. He tried ending Tristan Thompson Last night

"Doesn't matter, he's replacing Tristan Thompson."
"What team is dumb enough to trade for Kyrie? The Kings? Kyrie for Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson? Kyrie to the Magic for Gary Harris, Mo Bamba, and Robin Lopez? Lol"
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There’s no evidence that he’s good at his job when it doesn’t involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron’s. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel, even his client Zach lavine is unhappy with his pay. Rich Paul has only been able to use the “pay my guy or lebron might leave” move"
"Where would he be without his connection to LeBron? There’s no evidence that he’s good at his job when it doesn’t involve helping out a team or friend of Lebron’s. See Tristan Thompson, KCP and Anthony Davis. See Ben Simmons and Nerlens Noel"
And the same general approach has also gotten a lot of dudes paid way above what anybody thought they would get. See Tristan Thompson. He's got his way a lot too. See Anthony Davis. Y'all acting like he's still a bum off the street in a suit is way out of line.
But he had that nasty dunk on Tristan Thompson a year ago how could the rockets waive him???? /s
Honestly Atyon isn't really a max guy. But then again  Capella and Tristan Thompson got paid too so what do I know.
How did they clearly get better? By adding Tristan Thompson?
Tony Allen Joe Harris / Duncan Robinson / etc. Jeremy Evans (Dunks) Tristan Thompson (Offensive boards)
"Josh Richardson, Schroeder, Horford instead of Tristan Thompson, Teague, Semi Ojeyele"
"&gt; Ben Simmons cannot be your max contract point guard. You’ll need some other player to handle the ball in the half court  People are always so vague when it comes to ""ball handling"" and ""point guard duties"". Ben Simmons has good handles and good passing. Can you just be specific in describing what roles he can and cannot play?  &gt; The man is literally only an elite offensive player in transition. Being elite for 1/5th of the game and playing like Tristan Thompson with court vision minus the offensive rebounding in the half court won’t cut it.  I would respond to this but the answer is in the article. It very much seems like you did not read the article, so you're proving me right about people not reading it."
"Lol if you’re trying to contend, Ben Simmons cannot be your max contract point guard. You’ll need some other player to handle the ball in the half court and even then it’s difficult (but not impossible) to build a championship level offence because he can’t play center defensively. The man is literally only an elite offensive player in transition. Being elite for 1/5th of the game and playing like Tristan Thompson with court vision minus the offensive rebounding in the half court won’t cut it."
"yeah same here, at best that was just dumb. though, it's not like disregarding COVID is a new thing in the NBA (see: Tristan Thompson, Kyrie, etc)."
"On second thoughts it’s not as bad as the Cavs having 3 1st overall picks and a 2 4ths in 4 years and only getting Tristan Thompson, Kyrie, Waiters. And Love out of it.   But they also traded Waiters for JR and Shump and won a chip so maybe it’s all vindicated?"
"I'm far from an NBA historian but I'd wager the '15-'16 Cavs simply because there isn't much depth relative to other championship teams imo.  I'm not sure if I'd bet on that team getting to the 2nd round without LBJ.  PG - Kyrie Irving, Dellavedova, Mo Williams  SG - J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, Dahntay Jones  SF - LeBron James, Richard Jefferson, Jordan McRae  PF - Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, James Jones  C - Timofey Mozgov, Channing Frye"
"He got the following guys a bag:  Tristan Thompson   KCP  Eric bledsoe   Dejuante Murray  Clarkson    Garland   None of these are top 10 players and all have or in garlands case will get a bag  Rich Paul may be unpopular, but i wouldn't say he's a bad agent"
i want him to throw up a pull up 3 and scream old school-along came polly  then pull out a michael scott half court pull up and scream noting but net  then pull a tristan thompson and take it from one side and pull up close to half courtt with time on the clock and just pop it.    i'd buy a ben simmons jersey if he does this.  it is an entertainment league afterall
"Neither of us really knows whether Jimmy faked anything, but he sat out 3 games for Minny (none of them consecutively), and played pretty damn well in the other games he played, except against Milwaukee.   &gt;i don’t think there’s any prior situations where the org just continues to fine a player for an entire 4 seasons. Shit even an entire season.  Of course not, but no other player has threatened to straight up sit out their contract either. Tristan Thompson did threaten to sit out, but he was a free agent, so that would have been trivial.  Of course Ben Simmons isn't *actually* going to sit out 4 years, or even a single season, he can't afford to do that. This is a game of chicken, and Ben isn't in a very strong position.  The fact that this is a shitty situation for both parties is unquestionable, but the Sixers really should have the balls to ride this out. And so far, it looks like they do."
"Didn't play against them in school, but played against Anthony Bennet and Tristan Thompson at local gyms a few times, they were dominant. Owned every one of us on the floor.  It showed me just how amazing you have to be to play in the league.  Also had a few run ins with Jerome Williams and Vince Carter at a playground at Bathurst and Lakeshore in Toronto way back in the day. They didn't really play hard, but were lightyears better than everyone, even if they only played at about 10%.  Grew up with Jamal Magloire's little brother, and both him and Big Cat were so freaking good. Justin would've made an impact on any NBA team he would've played on. Unfortunately, he was killed before going to prep school.  Toronto in the late 90's, early 2000's really flew under the radar for basketball talent."
Actually she moved with him to Dallas but he got super depressed and did drugs started cheating after being traded. Shit Khloe even moved to Cleveland for Tristan Thompson. I know becauseI I watched the show.
Because he probably saw what Rich Paul did for guys like JR Smith and Tristan Thompson.
2011 Enes Kanter - Tristan Thompson  2012 Kevin Murphy - Kostas Papanikolaou  2013 Shabazz Muhammad - Giannis Antetokounmpo  2014 Dante Exum - Marcus Smart  2015 Trey Lyles - Devin Booker   Just wtf
Got real sick of watching Tristan Thompson grab an offensive board and then blow the putback. Dude was like Drummond lite out there
"Tristan Thompson played 447 games in a row for the Cavaliers, starting in the 2012-2013 season and ending on April 5th, 2017.  This includes all the playoff games for the 14-15 and 15-16 seasons.  I doubt there’s ever been a player with a lengthy career who’s never missed a game."
"TT as in Tristan Thompson, or Shump's wife and R&amp;B star Teyana Taylor?"
"Tristan Thompson: “We’re still 4-time Eastern Conference champions, so until you take us down from that, teams ain’t got much to say. Boston, Philly, they ain’t got much to say. Boston had homecourt Game 7 and lost. Philly, you guys almost got swept. Toronto - we know that story”  Edit   Who’s the butt hurt douche that is downvoting an actual quote  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/09/27/lebron-who-tristan-thompson-said-road-to-eastern-conference-title-still-goes-through-cleveland/"
"Look at the facts. Humphries = Career Ended, Tristan Thompson = Lack of success beyond expectations, Ben Simmons = Lack of success beyond expectations, James Harden = Lack of success, Blake Griffen…. This is just the NBA. We haven’t even started down the other sports or music…"
Tristan Thompson is Lethal 🥶
"Yeah, exactly! Like, if you want to say that Trae is better because his volume playmaking makes up for the difference in their defense, I think that's a perfectly valid argument, and it's a reasonable conversation to have. If the article were making *that* argument, instead of just going ""Trae has the 'it' factor over Tatum"" (because Tatum couldn't make it past the fully healthy Nets with *Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson* starting games for the Celtics), I wouldn't be yelling about it."
"We're not talking about a random b, lmao. Your experience is irrelevant to the conversation. Even more so if you're not a POC.....no offense of course.   &amp;nbsp;  We're talking about player experiences.   A team with fans who were so racist Bill Russell didn't even want to get his jersey retired publicly.   Kyrie came out and talked about his issues with the fans as well. So did Marcus Smart, Tristan Thompson, and I believe Jaylen Brown did as well."
"Fans overrate scoring. Simple as that.  Players who specialize in other areas (i.e. Draymond, B Wallace, Rodman) will never be *fully* appreciated because so much analysis is reductive to the point of ""Who scores the most points?""   You see the same thing in soccer. Ask about the best players of the past decade. People will invariably name goal scorers like Messi, Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic, etc. It is very easy to understand the person whose job is to finish the chain. What's harder to value correctly is the people who toil in the support structure, like a defensive midfielder, center back, or goalie.  In basketball there are players like Ron Artest, Jae Crowder, Andre Iguodala, Tristan Thompson, Jrue Holiday (until this year), Andrew Bogut, and Tyson Chandler who just sort of fly under the radar because the things they excel at aren't the things that most impress the general public (i.e. shot making).   But to actually win basketball games, you need rebounding, passing, defense, etc. That's why you see Scottie Barnes as a top 5 pick in the draft, and the Bucks selling the farm for Jrue, who is not regarded as a great pure scorer. Teams have more of an understanding that winning isn't just about having a bunch of guys who can drop 20 every night."
"I'm reaching just for the sake of this thought exercise, but all I've got is:  Reggie Bullock  *MAYBE* Tristan Thompson?  *MAYBE* Schroeder?  And I don't have the confidence to die on any of these mole hills. Not the least of reasons being that he's not helping any of these teams enough to suddenly get out of the first round."
"It turns out that the East does run through Cleveland, y'all owe Tristan Thompson an apology!"
"nah, it’s Koby Altman  every single year we draft the dude who is known to work harder than others   multiple times the cavs said they want to build a culture first, team second   after LeBron left, Gilbert and Koby made the decision to focus on getting guys who worked hard as hell. Sexton was the first piece, but you can’t ignore that he’s the only other Cavalier that’s ever been reported as being difficult to play with.   i think if you look at the quotes of Darius Garland, he feels like more of a leader  not even mentioning this team had vets like Tristan Thompson, Delly, and now Rubio on it. Sexton really ain’t that kind of leader, Okoro is just as hard of a worker"
Tristan Thompson shivering.
Tristan Thompson
I know Tristan Thompson had a long stretch of games for the Cavs his early years.
Why did the Kings sign Tristan Thompson again?
"The ‘16 Cavs did a great job slowing the game down and limiting fast breaks and the number of Warriors’ possessions.    By the ‘17 finals, the Warriors figured out how to neutralize Tristan Thompson and his offensive rebounds,  and the 14 second shot clock reset rule change greatly benefitted the Warriors style. Neither of those advantages were KD dependent."
Damn that’s crazy…Tristan Thompson is on the Kings
IIRC there was a graph showing that Giannis is indeed the best KD defender   The worst was Tristan Thompson
"Someone like Tristan Thompson maybe. A couple of the guys I mentioned like Luis Scola, Ricky Rubio, Drew Gooden etc.   An average player should be a starter on half the teams in the league and be able to get playing time on good teams, not just dumpster fires. Marvin Williams was a below average starter and only got playing time cause he was on the bobcats."
Tristan Thompson said as much too.
That was Rico Hines and Tristan Thompson
"It's not AD's fault, he was posting up known defensive juggernauts Terence Davis, Tristan Thompson, and Buddy Hield. Occasionally even Lebron's own Kryptonite, Marvin Bagley."
"Im pretty sure he was just talking to former teammate Tristan Thompson, both were chatting throughout the game because they are friends"
Wasn't he just joking with his ex-teammate Tristan Thompson?
Tristan Thompson still in the NBA? lol
Tristan Thompson vs lebron was the real story this game has been waiting for
I always forget then remember that Tristan Thompson plays for the Kings now

Tristan Thompson with the fire plus/minus of -16 in 12 minutes  Welcome to the Puke era
Cannot wait until embiid comes back got these role players like Tristan Thompson and the ones on the warriors flexing without him in the paint
"As someone who has watched most kings games over the past five years, I can say definitively that Alex Len, Tristan Thompson, and Mo Harkless are better basketball players right now than Marvin Bagley will ever be. He is in his fourth year in the league and has shown zero improvement or desire to help the team. He is objectively the worst defensive big man in the league and he is a black hole on offense who cannot score effectively. He is like if Jahlil Okafor had no post game. He is that bad. Anyone who thinks he can contribute at all to winning at the NBA level either has not watched him play or is delusional."
Tristan Thompson is on the kings? Lmao
"Psst hey luke, how about starting Tristan Thompson 😏"
I want Ben Simmons and Devin Booker on the same team. Kendall’s ex and her boyfriend. A movie. Or Karl Towns and Tristan Thompson on the same team. Will Jordyn still sit courtside???
"So Tristan Thompson is your team's heart and soul  Are you: A) fucked, B) kinda fucked"
Tristan Thompson talking like his opinion means anything
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
"&gt;Sacramento then made obvious defensive-minded personnel moves in the offseason, such as drafting Davion Mitchell at No. 9, and acquiring Tristan Thompson, Maurice Harkless, Alex Len and Terence Davis  Lol"
Tristan Thompson doesn't know shit. Overpaid nothing. He needs to actually perform instead of this tough guy provardo acting like he knows what it takes to win. I can just imagine him in the locker room telling these young guys about how him and the cavs won. 😳
"NBA Legend, Tristan “360 No-Scope” Thompson."
Known Forward Tristan Thompson
JR Smith isn’t Tristan Thompson
The bad old players are retired. The ones that are left are obviously the good ones. Except Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson.
There’s been nonstop Tristan Thompson quotes for the past week like he’s Scottie pippen selling a book lmao
Wait stop saying Horford is better than Tristan Thompson?
To be fair anybody who’s played that many games is gunna have some bad fouls and questionable plays if they were competing he’s no Tristan Thompson
"Kings already have Tristan Thompson, why would they add Horford?"
"His 6 fouls that game were on Tristan Thompson, then LeBron, then Kyrie, then Kevin Love, then Kyrie again, then LeBron again."
"The NBA Star took to Instagram and commented underneath a post about Khloe Kardashian stating:  “She needs to worry about her pu**y skills if every ni*** she dated cheated (pu**y trash).""

"Can someone explain what the Tristan Thompson line meant, still trying to wrap my head round the trade system. Does it just mean they offered him a contract?"
I highly doubt anyone's salty about Tristan Thompson when it comes to those Cavs teams. It's probably more so because many thought Thompson didn't play well with the Celtics but idk what goes through Simmons' mind personally
"Took Bagley over Luka: Yea no shit this is a huge miss as has been discussed 1000 times. Besides, previous ownership (Vlade) did that, unreasonable to attribute that to Monte McNair.  Lottery picks on three point guards: And all of them are looking like great picks? Tf?  Froze on trading Barnes: His trade value is as high if not higher than it's ever been. Not to mention he's one of the most solid vets in the league, you need guys like that on a young team. Not saying we shouldn't have traded him or look for deals now for the right return, but he certainly hasn't lost trade value.  Spent actual money on Tristan Thompson: Yea we traded for a contract that expires this year? And another solid vet? What's the issue?  Bogdanovic: Had a trade for Divencenzo that fell apart. Weren't able to get a new deal, and let him depart instead of re-signing him by overpaying and confirming continued mediocrity. Made the best of a bad situation  Bill Simmons is  a 🤡"
just as hes equally salty the celtics signed Tristan Thompson. he blames tt for the celtics sucking last year
Lebron surrounded by some of the greatest shooters in NBA history? Sounds cool but I doubt they'd be able to handle Tristan Thompson and JR Smith
"Even as a huge KD fan this is going too far  Steph and KD basically cancel each other out  So now we have Kyrie, KLove, Tristan Thompson and JR Smith vs. LeBron, Klay, Dray, and Iggy  Yikes"
"Andre Drummond, DeAndre Jordan, Hassan Whiteside, Steven Adams, Tristan Thompson, and Clint Capela for the 3 pt contest"
Never forget Tristan Thompson almost outrebounding the entire Hawks starters during the playoff sweep
Can't wait to hear from Tristan Thompson 🤔
Even tristan thompson knows they’re tanking
&gt;Tristan Thompson and David West   I had forgotten about this. Just rewatched it and now I can't stop laughing. Thank you.
Wasn’t he the one front and center when Tristan Thompson and David West were smooching?
Tristan Thompson misunderstood.  It’s the West that runs through the Cavs.
Myck Kabongo got disqualified at Texas (and ruined any potential NBA odds) for practicing with Tristan Thompson after he became a pro.  Their rules are very strict and mostly stupid.
"Oh man yeah, he was a 3rd pick -- he didn't play a minute at Kentucky either.   That draft is so weird -- Kyrie Irving was super injured at Duke, went 1, Kanter didn't play, went 3. Then the rest is like Derrick Williams, Tristan Thompson, Jan Vesely, Bismack Biyombo.... and somehow, Kemba, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, Kawhi and Nikola Vucevic went behind these guys."
TIL Tristan Thompson plays for the Kings

"If he never played for the Hawks, then why did he get traded there?  Did Boston just give him away  for a bag of chips?  Why would Altanta want to have Triston Thompson NOT play for them rather than have a bag of chips?  I mean, a bag of chips at least makes a delicious snack, you can't make a delicious snack out of Tristan Thompson not playing for you, can you?    This line of questioning is just leaving me with even more questions."
"The warriors have guys like Steph, Draymond and Kuminga.  We had JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love, and rookie Collin Sexton."
"It’s because the roster is built to his likeness, that isn’t indicative of being a good teammate or making your players better. LeBron fills his team with a collection of talented guys who serve no purpose of leading a team or helping a team win a championship but serve the purpose of playing off him. As we see, some players can (Tristan Thompson, Jr Smith, KCP, Shane Battier) but these aren’t nucleus to win championships without him. Also, LeBron has had a knack for leaving right when he senses the team is on a decline (D Wade injury concerns in 2014, Bosh getting older/Kyrie getting traded/Kevin Love struggling with injuries and regressing from his prime) so of course they’re not winning a championship without him, they lost WITH him."
"Your explanation for why he wouldn't be as good defensively was about mobility though  U said modern bigs have to be able to guard the perimeter. Is Orlando Shaq really gonna do that much worse than a Brook Lopez? Marc Gasol? Javale Mcgee? Tristan Thompson etc ?   &gt;In terms of pure mobility, there are countless other starting Cs in today's game that are far more mobile than Shaq.  Than Orlando Shaq? Absolutely not. Like I said...he was more mobile than 90% of the bigs today. Idk why u guys have it in ur head that all the bigs today move like Giannis. Literally...all the best centers pretty much suck at guarding the perimeter and are slow outside of Bam. Hell Jokic just won the damn MVP and he's as slow as they get."
"To be fair, 2018 Cavs didn't have a single player close to AD's caliber either. Replace Tristan Thompson with AD, and they might have a chance against that 2018 GSW team"
"The type of rebounding is huge but because it's a stat that leads to (/defines) a possession another big aspect is who is getting the rebound and what they're able to do with it.    The best example of this is probably Cleveland.   * Tristan Thompson grabs the defensive rebound, hands it off to one of LeBron/Kyrie who walks the ball up the court for a standard offensive possession = 1 rebound.  * Kevin Love grabs the defensive rebound and is [an immediate threat to initiate one of the most unguardable plays in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C34bBtDz0gc) = 1 rebound.   Those two rebounds are very different in terms of value but they're both counted as 1 defensive rebound. Both were good but a Kevin Love defensive rebound was generally better for the team than a Tristan Thompson defensive rebound.  It's the same with the Russell/Wilt rebounds. Yes those two were grabbed a lot of rebounds, but they were both able to [push the ball up the court immediately for easy buckets/assists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2AlFrOj5Mc) (not to mention the famous Russell/Cousey outlets). Not only do they have guys like Drummond beat in rebounds per game, but their rebounds were more valuable.   And that same logic can be applied to OKC. Do you want Steven Adams getting the rebound and then handing the ball off to Russ or do you want Russ doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPvYSN0wtUw) and [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cod-G0cyWE0)"
"Youre saying the JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Eric Bledsoe and KCP paydays didnt maximize their earnings?"
"Are you fucking kidding? Look at the list of Rich Paul clients and check their career earnings. Nerlins got the shaft, but hes gotten guys like Tristan Thompson, KCP,  Bledsoe, JR Smith way more money than theyre worth."
You got fortunate enough last season to get a mid season coaching change combined with amazing veteran leadership from Chris Paul to lead you to the finals. I’d love for this slide to turn into a Walton firing and for some great veteran leadership from our stars… uh… Mo Harkless and Tristan Thompson
"Ahh yes the multiple hall of famers in tristan thompson, matthew dellavadova, and jr smith"
"If you think LeGM doesn't have a say...and I mean some high input in trades, signing/resignings...you're crazy. Bron wanted Westbrick, it's been said hundreds of times. We know what his word means. Same way he got Tristan Thompson the heavy overpaid bag in Cleveland, he made sure to look out for THT his client also, to get his boy Rich Paul a lil more cash to take Adele on some nice dates."
"I dunno, I remember it being a huge contention point with him at the Cavs too when they didn’t want a huge tax bill from giving JR and Tristan Thompson their paydays."
"Major Tristan Thompson saying the East still runs through Cleveland after LeBron left energy here. Except it’s Kawhi and it only strengthens Raptors fans abandonment complex. Makes sense considering Vince, Kawhi, and Kyle all forced their way out."
Reminds me of when Tristan Thompson lost it on him on the court one time.
Will Tristan Thompson be there ?
"&gt;It's apples and oranges. Those Kobe teams won at a very small time. The Durant warriors would probably destroy them.   I think you're missing my point. Kobe accomplished the same amount as KD with a far less talented team.   &gt; Also you're leaving out Andre Bynum who was pretty damn good in those days.  What? Andrew Bynum was a role player on those teams and he missed the entire 2008 postseason. He was a good rim protector but he's not Draymond, Klay level good.   &gt;Durant is every bit as good as Kobe ever was. There is a lot of revisionist history about Kobe, but look at the numbers.  Kobe destroys KD in defense and it's not even close. It's much easier to score now than it was during Kobe's era. I also think Kobe's perceived 'inefficiency' is really overblown. Many people will cite 'oh Durant was a more efficient ISO scorer than Kobe ever was.' This is when you need to look at the tale of the tape as opposed to advanced metrics or statistics because they can't tell you the whole story.  All ISO efficient scorers this league have one important luxury that players back then really did not: the rate at which a big man is switched onto them.  It is very rare now for teams to run an ISO without a PNR to get a big or mismatch onto the player ISO-Scoring. How often do you see a team run a switch for Durant, Harden, Curry, or LeBron to get their primary defender off of them? Just take a look at the 2016 Game 5 or 6 highlights that LeBron had. They forced the switch repeatedly so that LeBron could ISO against a big. You could even watch James Harden's recent explosion on the Cavs where the big (Tristan Thompson) was switched onto him repeatedly.  This big vs. guard ISO wasn't as prominent back then for one simple reason: the bigs back then couldn't stretch the floor for 3 points.  When guarding against a big setting a PNR before the three point explosion, you could live with a player scoring a given 2 points if you trapped the ball-handler. Now, you can't simply because 3 points, despite just being one point greater will add up terribly in a game. Teams nowadays do not have the luxury of being able to trap the ball handler when the big setting the pick can shoot the 3 ball. Ironically, this is how Golden State went on an absolute tear last year. Everytime they had forced it out of Curry's hands in the PNR with Green, there was a three on four, which back then would have led to a 2 point score; instead they blew games open with repeated 3 point bombs.  In the previous eras, ISOs were run with the primary scorer being guarded by the primary defender, whether that be Bruce Bowen, Doug Christie, etc. So when you consider that Kobe's points were predicated on playing one on one against their best defender, as opposed to a slower big, then you hold his shooting percentages, whether advanced or just regular FG% in higher regard.   &gt;He didn't rack up multiple MVPs. He was never this dominant force that could just carry a team to greatness.  KD doesn't have multiple MVPs either. Kobe could carry a team much more than KD can. Gasol was good but he's no unanimous MVP, not to mention Klay, Draymond, and Iggy.   &gt;Kobe was never at any point the best player in the league. For three of his titles he wasnt the best player on his team.  I'd say he was the best from 2006-2010. You could argue that Kobe was just as good as Shaq in 01.   &gt; Those warriors were better with Durant than they would have been with Kobe. No question.  Nah. Fact is Durant had to join the most stacked team in NBA history to even win a ring. Kobe's 2008-2010 run is better than anything KD has done. He averaged 30/6/6 on 57% TS in the playoffs, played excellent defense, made 3 straight Finals, and won 2 FMVPs. And this includes 2010 when he was banged the hell up. KD needs to prove he can win without the most stacked team in NBA history before he passes Kobe."
Tristan Thompson last lol  From watching the 2017 and 2018 Finals that seems accurate
"How tf is it Rich Paul’s fault that Ben wants out.   Rich Paul advocates for his clients like every other agent in the NBA. if he got Tristan Thompson paid by leveraging Lebron, then that’s him being amazing at his job. Also every center in the nba was getting fat deals at that time and Tristan had the whole I can switch and I’m on a championship level team appeal.   The shit with Nerlens was bad if true but that’s the only real issue I have with him.   Agents negotiate FOR their clients against teams. I’m sure if you support the team, you’re not going to like them but that’s their job.   When GMs sing players to great value contacts and get or trade guys who wanted to stay for better players we praise them.   Ben Simmons is still a shithead though. I work in corp law so in my opinion all of this is just millionaires arguing over contracts and money. The same way lawyers have a duty to represent their clients, so do agents."
"Big defense is overrated in the playoffs ? Tristan Thompson is basically the only meh defensive center that's closed games for NBA finalists in the last decade.  Also Barnes is good defensivel, saying he's been insane is really pushing it."
"I would say that being immediately traded as a rookie over guys like Dion Waters and Tristan Thompson would skew someone's outlook on ""the game"" to a more cynical, nihlistic standpoint"
Tristan Thompson
that tristan thompson re-up deal does not get enough scrutiny i always get downvoted for saying that on here
"It's interesting that people shat on the Cavs for giving Tristan Thompson, JR, and Love big contracts."
"I love Lebron, especially as a player, but he's almost too good to his friends. He deserves to have some control over the roster, but his friends are typically very expensive to keep around.  Exhibit A is the Cavs with Tristan Thompson/JR Smith. Things like bringing in Wade, trading Crowder/Thomas, and a lot of moves that didn't fit the roster were made for him.  We *all* knew Russell wasn't the right move for this team, but here we are."
That's because that's the only memorable thing about him that series. He averaged less points per game than Tristan Thompson.
"Using this list and your assists #s above, here's assists per game (from most):  * Anthony Davis:	2.05  * Kevin Love:	1.59  * Chris Bosh:	1.35  * Kyle Kuzma:	1.35  * Zydrunas Ilgauskas:	1.22  * Dwyane Wade:	1.15  * Drew Gooden:	1.15  * Mo Williams:	1.04  * Kentavious Caldwell-Pope:	0.90  * J.R. Smith:	0.89  * Kyrie Irving:	0.84  * Anderson Varejao:	0.71  * Mario Chalmers:	0.64  * Daniel Gibson: 0.62  * Tristan Thompson: 0.55  * Eric Snow: 0.45  * Sasha Pavlovic: 0.38"
Ever seen Tristan Thompson shoot?
Tristan Thompson switched to left I believe. May have just been for free throws
"They’re cool with each other now, but Draymond and Tristan Thompson had like a two-month-long beef that began during the 2018 Finals."
"But that's what you need to question, what is their wrong doing?   Is AD/LeBron purposely trying to fuck them over? No they are not. LeBron wanted JR Smith and Tristan Thompson for Cleveland. It was a huge overpay and would be detrimental the second LeBron left but like Windhorst says... you do whatever to make him, or in this case, those two happy.  They care more about legacy than money at this point... they'll do whatever they deem is right in order to get there again, another ring. I've blindly trusted Masai since the get-go when he was hired. If he was to make any moves which fuck us up royally I would stand by it because I know he's trying his best. I wish others could see the same here with Bron/AD  It's like blaming Masai last year for not getting a proper center, how Aron Baynes was unacceptable. Yeah we could argue that was a mistake but fuck, have some faith these professionals know what they are doing."
"Guard 80/20 : we've seen a lot of guards on elite teams being bad or below average while their team was still an elite defense, most elite defensive wings can guard guards, and most guards can be hidden on defense because most of them at least have size. On the other end we've seen plenty of elite defensive guards on crappy defensive teams.  Wings 55/45 : I'll say that bad wing defense is worse than bad wing offense, but an elite offensive wing is THE key to the current era IMO, can't win without one  Center 20/80 : Brook Lopez/Giannis, AD, Marc Gasol, Draymond/Bogut, Tristan Thompson, Duncan, Bosh, Chandler, Pau/Bynum, here's the list of centers that have closed games for the NBA champions in the last 10/15 years, no defensive liabilities and basically all have case for all defense/DPOY at some point of their careers. Can't win with a defensive liability at center"
"It's not just that they passed on luka. That class is littered with stars and good rotation guys. 4 have gotten the max, ayton could possibly get it in the summer, JJJ got a huge deal and MB3 can't even beat out Tristan Thompson."
"Gonna get downvoted to oblivion but i feel the same way about moving screens and how it helped teams like the Warriors.  Damn near every screen looks like an offensive foul now.  Shit, I know Tristan Thompson used to just shove mofos toward the end of his screens."
"I don’t know why people think Lebron is a good player GM, he’s probably a great leader but he’s also the same guy that bullied the Cavs into giving Tristan Thompson and JR Smith ridiculous contracts when the KD warriors were his competition."
Imagine the difference between having Al Horford as your center and team leader and fucking Tristan Thompson.
Tristan Thompson was a good defender the year they won the title.  The Mavs were just as much a jump shooting team as the warriors were relative to the league when they won
Tristan Thompson is on the Kings?
"Love, Thad young if they want to maybe go smaller. Not sure if Robin might be available. Tristan Thompson might be an option"
That player was very clearly Tristan Thompson who was a disaster here with us.  And everywhere since lebron left cleveland honestly
"Your points are understandable. In response, He may have spoken his feelings after one game but that's not a reflection of just this game only. For the last couple seasons, Celtics fans have been complaining about playmaking on offense, play calling on offense and personnel. And on nights it works, it's not an issue and everyone's happy and when it doesn't, people get rightfully mad about it. The team is the same general makeup with a few subtractions and additions and when the same problems as usual come up, the same frustrations will too.  1. From a playmaking perspective, everyone we've had so far in the last 3 years is fine, passable but not terrific. This includes Kyrie, Kemba, the Jays and everyone else. Hayward was generally excluded from this as our best passer along with Horford but Horford left and Hayward was never fit. They Jays have improved on this aspect, yes, but not enough. When they struggle to get a shot, as you can see often from whenever Aaron Nesmith or Pritchard got the ball last year, or even lobs to Rob Williams, the pass is just a bit off. Enough that they can't go straight up and shoot it off the passes.  2. Play calling/offense. It's a lot of isos or 2 man screen game if any. It's a lot of your turn, my turn kind of offense and when it works, it's great. I'll throw it back to something Brad hammered home in our NBA finals year without kyrie. Paint touches. It's something from the eye test, no numbers to prove, to me that has decreased a by some amount. We worked hard that year to get it to Horford inside so we can get the ball outside more. And that has gone down as the Jays have gotten more involved with the offense. We still do run some cool stuff to run those kind of looks with Al now and at times with Rob Williams last season. We couldn't with Tristan Thompson with his stone hands and not as much with Kanter due to him being better off trying to score when he gets the ball. We can't really do that with Grant Williams because when he's at center, he's not in the pain often, as we play a 5 out of sorts. And when Tatum posts up, he's looking for one thing only and it's not to pass it out. We can definitely get better with that with our current personnel and we should but there needs to be gradual changes in that too.  3. Personnel. He's not always the problem. And its absolutely too soon to dislike it. Watching Josh Richardson has been pain so far. Some more Nesmith would be nice but I imagine he's not playing a lot for a reason. I'll choose to believe in Ime for now. We haven't had an out and out shooter for a while. None comes to mind. Could've been Tyler herro but Miami got to him in the draft first. And he's since shown to be more than that anyways. Wasn't Carson Edwards. Isn't Nesmith quite yet. So the who are they passing to criticism is fair, but obviously if trying to be solo offense isn't working and is costing us wins, then fucking pass even if they suck.   We suck at rebounding this season so far. Getting progressively worse every year. 21st in the league this season, 14th last season, 11th and 10th the 2 seasons before that.  Etc. Could go on. Don't want to be too much of a downer.   TL:DR Basically, things could be better. Smart isn't only frustrated about this game only and he isn't necessarily wrong either. And it isn't solely the Jays at fault. But it's fixable, and hopefully will be asap. I would rather be celebrate than bitching."
Man I though after the 2016 Finals the debate was finally over.  Tristan Thompson is the best player in the league.
Didn’t your GM reject a Turner for Hayward sign and trade in favour of signing Tristan Thompson and the chance to not re-sign Evan Fournier? Or was that offer never actually there?
The thing I love about Tristan Thompson is that he tries to shoot sky hooks over a wall of three defenders from 7 feet
What if you got him for Tristan Thompson and a filler
We’re 7-1 since trading Theis. Freeing up more minutes for Robert Williams and Tristan Thompson has worked better.
"Ah yes JR smith, KCP, Caruso, tristan Thompson, and plenty of others known players who got worse with lebron."
"Its cause the centers who defended embiid were Tristan Thompson, Rob Williams and Luke Kornet"
"""Tristan Thompson still alive?"" Bruh"
I swear to god this motherfucker Tristan Thompson turned into Bill Russell in the 16 finals. offensive board after offensive board
He wasn’t in the finals. Tristan Thompson might’ve been their third best player
"Yeah I agree, but damn it’d be great if he was never “forced” to shoot left handed as he was growing up. Didn’t Tristan Thompson have a similar experience but ended up transitioning to his natural hand at some point? It might be too late for Ben but I’d love to hear he atleast tried it out."
"""Top picks"" are overrated, first of all.    Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 7 out of 100: Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 12 players, only 5 were top 3 picks and just 3 were first overall -- over 20 years.  Mediocre teams have a path to contention, and we've seen it.  It's disturbingly simple.  You build your team by drafting the best players that you can, wherever your picks fall, and by making smart trades for better players, or players that fit better.  When a ""star"" player becomes available, as they often do, you trade some of those assets for that player.  Toronto did this.  Miami did this.  Milwaukee did this.  Denver did this.  Utah did this.  None of them tanked, and none of them relied on top picks or huge free agent signings\*.  Every team in the league passed on those teams' key players in the draft.  So invest in your scouting and development operations and draft better if you want to win.  If that fails, swindle  other teams by pulling trades like Donovan Mitchell for Tyler Lydon and Trey Lyles.  &amp;#x200B;  \*Yes, Butler signed in Miami, but he also signed with Philadelphia which is not exactly South Beach, and had no problem playing in Minnesota -- and Jimmy never leaves the gym anyway."
Tristan thompson apparently
"What is ""very rarely""? and when does it become not rare enough for you that it becomes serious? Tatum, Jrue Holiday, and Tristan Thompson have all stated that they have felt long lasting effects of COVID. As of Jan 21, 2021, little over 100 players have tested positive in the NBA, adding on the time from then to now, and the 3 month break when they weren't tested, let's very liberally suggest 200 NBA players have tested positive. That would still be a 1.5% of the most fit people on the planet who experienced quality-of-life altering symptoms (at least in the short to medium term). And that's just the players who have come out and stated their battle with the virus. To put this in perspective, the AZ vaccine has caused blood clots in 0.0004% of patients, that is orders of magnitudes lower than the aforementioned 1.5%, and the vaccine was suspended (at least in canada and denmark to my knowledge).  More importantly, ""just don't be fat"" is such a immature and elitist view (I walk around 145 so don't worry about me). Even if you have taken tremendous care in your body and health. Just dropping 50-100 pounds is incredibly difficult and takes a long time to a accomplish responsibly, and the long term impact of years of obesity doesn't just disappear the second you hit the ""normal"" BMI mark."
Yeah not tryna be a dick is still useful but as you mention in your post huge difference between missing Durant or lebron And missing Tristan Thompson
"Jae Crowder (yes he was traded but he was on that team), Jordan Clarkson, George Hill, Jeff Green, Rodney Hood, Kyle Korver, Larry Nance jr, JR Smith &amp; Tristan Thompson as support around a consistent 3rd option scoring 16-18ppg (there is max 3 teams in the league right now that could say no to such a 3rd option...) in Kevin Love, and THEN you have Kyrie and Lebron. Really don't believe i'm overhyping them, it's just not true Lebron was alone against the world."
"Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague don’t fit our timeline either yet we went out and signed them for a reason, to (at least try) and fill needs"
"There are two separate pools of players on our team. Grant Williams and Tristan Thompson went into protocol earlier so those are the two that will likely be able to play tomorrow. Barring other positive test results, The others should be back this weekend."
"Teague, smart, Pritchard, Edwards, waters, Nesmith, tacko, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson"
Embiid looks like a man on a mission this season. I don't think Tristan Thompson/Daniel Theis/Timelord are going to bother him.
"Think about it. Kemba for Drummond makes sense. You don't need Kemba. You need a proper, big ass, big man. Tristan Thompson is giving up more than 70% of field goals attempted in the paint. Daniel Theis is an excellent player, don't get me wrong; but you need someone to take you to that next level.   Smart is more than serviceable as a starting guard; Teague is a questionable sixth man, I think Wanamaker filled that role way better, but you don't even need that much playmaking from your PG because Tatum and Brown are both excellent playmakers."
the east runs through tristan thompson
"So we're calling Avery Bradley a ""significant upgrade"" now? Same with Tristan Thompson?"
"Ooohhh Barnes is definitely a good pickup. I don’t follow Celtics ball all that much, how is Tristan Thompson for ya’ll? Cuz iirc last season size was one of your biggest weaknesses i think"
They'd just need to pick up Tristan Thompson and they could add a pick to get literally anybody.
"You listed Tristan Thompson for the Cavs, but not Andrew Bynum alongside Pau? He was pretty good for us."
"It’s good that their main competition in the East only has front court players like... Giannis and Embiid.  Heck, even Tristan Thompson can feast regularly."
Tristan Thompson was already on the team he was one for three consecutive first round picks. Remember Anthony Bennett?
"basically he can be what we had with Tristan Thompson in 2015-2016 but much better. Elite at screening, elite defender (can guard multiple positions), really good at rebounding and young as well at only 22."
"I highly doubt it. Unless they manage to do something crazy like manage to flip an injured Dinwiddie for a competent center or find someone who can immediately start late in the draft, I don’t see how they can win a title. The only team with a bad defense to win a title was the 2016 Cavs and they had Lebron who was still amazing on defense when he wanted to be and Tristan Thompson playing some really good basketball."
They can have Tristan Thompson if we get Kevin Durant
"Reminds me of the old ""surely Tristan Thompson + the Nets pick will get us this bonafide superstar"" that Cavs fans were saying a few years ago"
‘Very valuable player for every team to have’. I mean so is Jerami Grant lol KCP...Tristan Thompson...Pat Beverly .... most role players are very valuable! Lol
"""Remember Tristan Thompson?....bigger"""
"so much this.  OP has the Celtics using a protection slot on Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford, 2 late lottery/mid-first picks from the last 2 years.  There is no chance in hell the Celtics would protect Thompson, who is about to be 30 and on a MLE contract over 2 21 year-olds on rookie scale deals."
"there is absolutely zero chance the Celtics would protect Tristan Thompson over Aaron Nesmith or Romeo Langford.  TT is about to be 30 and is on the MLE, Nesmith/Langford are 21 and on rookie scale deals for multiple seasons."
"Great rundown.   I actually picked up Diallo in fantasy in week 2—I've been a fan of OKC since '10 after watching Kobe and KD battle it out, and started watching OKC games more. Everybody knows he's an athletic freak, can't win a dunk contest without that, but it's quite impressive how much of a better defender he's become and more confident of a ballhandler. He rarely turns the ball over, makes good decisions, attacks with confidence and I think learned a lot from CP's year there. Helps to guard two of the craftiest guards in the league, both of the old guard and new.  He singlehandedly won me this week. KAT, Tristan Thompson, and Garland all went down for me and Lavine's 45 and Hami's back to back 20 point outings made me 1-8 to 5-4."
imagine thinking horford was better against tristan thompson lol
I thought you were talking about Tristan Thompson.
"I'm actually getting kind of exhausted reading these discussions on ""gravity"" and how Steph gets ""double/triple teamed as soon as he crosses half court."" I find them lacking in nuance.  Curry sees a lot of defensive attention, and LeBron's Cavs in particular had great success doubling him on the PnR with Kyrie + the screener's defender (notably, Tristan Thompson was great at hedging and doubling off Draymond's pick).  But MOST other teams do not double/triple team Steph as part of their scheme, including the Raptors in the 2019 finals (who still managed to play phenomenal defense on him). The truth is, most NBA fans don't know what a double/triple team is, and how it's different from a hard hedge or box-and-1 defense. Steph sees a combination of defensive schemes against him, but the double team is actually less common than you'd think. He's gotten too good at passing out of it, and teams rarely will overcommit like that nowadays. Having Draymond on the floor as a kick-out facilitator makes it even more untenable.  That being said, Steph DOES demand an insane amount of defensive attention. But every superstar at a certain caliber deals with this. I think LBJ, Harden, and Steph probably create the most fear. It feels like coaches mail it in on over-scheming for Kawhi and KD, because those are two players who are going to get theirs no matter what.  What makes Steph unique, is that the defense needs to start looking for him at the hash mark. That's what the blog boys mean when they talk about ""gravity."" It's not about the amount of attention, it's about when it starts."
"Players out due to Covid-19 protocols for BOS: Tatum, Grant Williams, Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson  Players out due to injury for BOS: Kemba, Romeo Langford  This is gonna be so great....."
"Horford will turn 35 by the time playoffs begin. He *helped* somewhat contain Giannis a couple years ago (still 25.7PPG in 40MPG), when he and Middleton were the only legit threats. Semi in his rookie year was on Giannis just as much, and did just as good a job as Horford. Next playoffs Giannis feasted on the Cs, even though it was the Kyrie cancer year... 28.4PPG on over 60% TS. Giannis has gotten better all around and as a playmaker, while Horford is older and slower. Highly doubt Horford would be a better option now covering Giannis as Tristan Thompson or even Semi. As an overall player, yeah... but not in slowing down Giannis. And a healthy Kemba was 23.5PPG on 60% TS until January when his knee became an issue. If he's back to that you can easily argue he's better overall value."
He was one of our only 2 bigs since Robert Williams got the virus and Tristan Thompson and Grant Williams got quarantined because they sit next to him on the bench.
Tristan Thompson and DeAndre Jordan too
It depends on what he looks like this year. Being LeBron's teammate on a championship team has worked out pretty well for lots of role players in the past. Just ask guys like JR Smith and Tristan Thompson.
"Tristan Thompson was not close to average defensively in 2016. The Warriors had Draymond, KD Iggy and Klay on defense. Looney and Javale were also a lot less exploitable than Jokic."
"Tristan Thompson was not an neutral defender. Neither were Bosh, Haarlem or Birdman. Maybe Looney was but they had way too many other defensive option to care."
GSW v CLE when warriors led 3-1 every one talks and rightly about LeBrons block what not is the injury to Warriors center Andrew Bogut. The next 3 games Tristan Thompson went on his best career 3 games and signed a $100m contract. I hope he sends Bogut a Christmas card each year to thank him for being known more than just a Kardashian handbag

Jaylen Brown  Jayson Tatum  Marcus Smart  Tristan Thompson  Grant Williams  Peyton Pritchard  Kemba Walker
"Tatum, brown, smart, kemba, Rob williams, payton Pritchard, Tristan thompson/theis"
"and you fail to mention the good pieces you got to replace those losses including kemba walker and tristan thompson, who are both very much still good players.  meanwhile we went from a gasol/ibaka tandem at center to baynes, len and maybe sometimes boucher although he's more often played at the 4."
Still better than the average Tristan Thompson attempt at a post move...
"😴 He’s trash.  I’m starting to get annoyed that bc they’ve unexpectedly won a few games people are starting to overhype his impact. Like he’s some intangibles genius. Like stop it. Draymond makes his team better....like Alex Caruso makes the Lakers better. Like Delavadova or Tristan Thompson made the lebron cavs better. Or Pat Beverly a few years back. Are these plus players ? Sure. But that doesn’t mean they’re anything more or really that good.   Draymond is a quality role player who perceives himself , and has fooled fans,  to thinking he’s some elite player. It will be hilarious when they start losing again as Draymond triple singles it up."
"Jaylon Brown, Marcus Smart, Jason Tatum, Daniel Theis, and Tristan Thompson"
"Most people grow up playing baseball in the summer here. And the Jays were wildly popular in the 90s with back to back World Series.   But I’d say we have better basketball players than baseball players right now. Thanks to Vince Carter’s popularity in the 2000’s and with the Raptors recent championship and 7 year run there’s way more to come.   Outside of our Lord and Saviour Steve Nash there’s:   Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Chris Boucher, and  Kelly O to name a few.   We the north!"
Lebron was genuinely the only player the Warriors were guarding and took it to six games. His next two highest minute getters were Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson. That team got an absurd amount of offensive rebounds and basically played extremely ugly iso basketball to throw off the warriors.   Steph was basically a frontrunner in that series and only played well when his team was already ahead. In all of their losses he played like total shit which is why he didnt get FMVP.  The series changed when yall started Iggy and he did a good job guarding Lebron.
Yeah look at the team Lebron carried to the finals and took that series to 6 in 2015.  ||| |:-|-:| |Player|Total Mins| |LeBron James|274| |Tristan Thompson|247| |Iman Shumpert|215| |J.R.

Cant believe Danny Ainge went and signed Tristan Thompson ass lmao was the market that bare Danny??
I know Tristan Thompson has been putting em up but I wouldn’t call him their best player
It’s between him and Tristan Thompson when we look at their second best player in the 2015 finals.   In 2016 they conveniently lost to a Cavs team that was something close to healthy. It’s just weird when I see the “they proved they could win” thing.   Nobody would suggest the Raptors proved they could win (by dethroning the healthy GSW) because they beat the limping Warriors.
Not if DPOY Tristan Thompson has anything to say about it!

Definitely Tristan Thompson debunked the whole 'LeBron has perfect diet' myth
You overestimated Tristan Thompson immensely then
The Tristan Thompson maneuver.
So a Tristan Thompson
Signing bad contracts is worse than letting a player go. When will people learn that? Same people who think Cavs needed to sign Tristan Thompson years ago.
"Yes! Thank you. All the problems people have with the Celtics (soft, not competitive enough, inconsistent effort) are exactly Tatum’s problems.  When he became the “leader” of that team, they took on his bad qualities.  I honestly think if they traded him and Tristan Thompson for Lillard the Celtics could win the title next year."
"Game 1 went to OT and that's when Kyrie got hurt. Cavs literally had to rely on Delly to nearly kill himself to take that series to 6. It was LeBron, Delly and fucking Tristan Thompson against Steph, Klay and Draymond."
Like Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love (to an extent). I know I'm missing some of the others.
"Not to mention Dillon Brooks, Tristan Thompson, and Khem Birch."
"And Kelly Olynyk, Tristan Thompson."
"Jamal Murray - SGA - Corey Joseph   Dillion Brooks - Lugentz Dort     RJ Barrett - Andrew Wiggins   Kelly Olynyk - Chris Boucher   Tristan Thompson -  Dwight Powell - Khem Birch     Barely misses cut: NAW, Nembhard, Ejim, Mulder"
Yep. This is the same way Tristan Thompson got paid. You are stuck either paying the guy or having him walk and get nothing and the player is certainly better than the vet min you'd have to replace him with.  Then LeBron leaves because he fucked your cap up.
"OK, sure. Then let's use their shooting splits against the Warriors since they had the same opponents and both series went 7. Similar sample size.

You could argue that shooting wasn't as important then as it is now, sure. But compare it to the Cavs squad in the playoffs.   |Player|FG%|3P%| |:-|:-|:-| |LeBron James|52.5|34.0| |Kyrie Irving|47,5|44.0| |J.R. Smith|43.6|43.0| |Kevin Love|38.5|41.4| |Tristan Thompson|52.7|0| |Richard Jefferson|52.4|39.3| |Iman Shumpert|41.7|38.2| |Channing Frye|59.4|56.5|"
Tristan Thompson might be up there
Center minutes on the last five NBA championship teams  2020 Lakers: JaVale McGee / Dwight Howard (16.6 / 18.9 mpg)  2019 Raptors: Serge Ibaka / Marc Gasol (27.2 / 24.9 mpg)  2018 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee / Jordan Bell (14.1 / 9.5 / 14.2 mpg)  2017 Warriors: Zaza Pachulia / JaVale McGee (18.1 / 9.6 mpg)  2016 Cavaliers: Tristan Thompson / Timofey Mozgov (27.7 / 17.4 mpg)
"I looked it up:  Tristan Thompson, Steve Nash, Moses Malone, Wilt Chamberlain, James Harden  Might be a bit of a stretch"
"I mean, yes almost all of them in the last two decades?  * Lakers started JaVale McGee with Dwight as his backup * Raptors started an old Marc Gasol who was making a lot of money, but was on a minimum and unplayable on the Lakers two seasons after * Warriors for their two most recent titles used some combo of Jordan Bell, Zaza Pachulia, Kevon Looney and JaVale * and going back to 15/16 the Cavs started Tristan Thompson  idk if you call this moneyball, but it's basically just spending your money in places where it is hardest to get production above replacement level. except for the really elite centers like Embiid and Jokic, the defense/rebounding/rim roll skillset is in such an over abundance right now"
Same thing with Tristan Thompson
"“You ignored all the details of the series.”   Sorry bud, you lost the last shred of credibility you had on that point when you started talking about Ty Lue’s adjustments like he suddenly figured out a 5 out offense with K Love at center.  Guess what Tristan Thompson played waaaay more in those pivotal elimination games than he did at any other point in the series. Are we just ignoring reality now in the service of the all-mighty god of spacing?  Please don’t talk to me about never watching playoff games when you just make shit up whole cloth. Kevin Love was terrible on both ends that series so no, opening it up to the “spacing” he provided did not win them the championship. It’s almost like winning basketball is about more than that.  What have you got for me next box score hot take artist? 😂"
"Cleveland have had Waiters, Kyrie, Bennett, Tristan Thompson, Sexton, Garland and now Okoro. That's eight top-10 picks in ten years. They have been incredibly lucky and should get even better with the 3rd pick this year"
"It is generally believed that we will be able to shed Tristan Thompson without paying someone a pick just to take him. I hope that's not a delusion, but I'm pretty sure it is."
Tristan Thompson liked that.
"#Perfect offseason  Tatum recruits Bradley Beal during the olympics, he requests a trade to Boston and we trade Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, Robert Williams, and a decade of picks and swaps for him  #Realistic offseason   Re-sign Fournier to a 3 year deal around 40-45m   Trade for a good starting PG like Derrick White or Ricky Rubio  Agree to a cheap extension for Timelord"
The Celtics are fully prepared to take him off your hands for NBA champion Tristan Thompson along with budding young superstars Carsen Edwards and Semi Ojeleye
"Lamar Odom, Kris Humphries, Tristan Thompson, Ben Simmons. Who else?"
"It has a chance, but right now it’s gotta be 2011. Kawhi, Kyrie, Butler, Klay, Kemba, Bogdanovic, Vucevik, Reggie Jackson, Tristan Thompson, etc."
The disrespect towards the GOAT Tristan Thompson...Unbelievable
"As a Celtics fan I 1000% believe it. Team was full of fkn meatheads this year. And by full of meat heads I mean Tristan Thompson was a massive meat head last year. The stories I heard about this fucking guy. Just gave Zero shits about covid the minute he got to any city he liked. More than one report came out about that. Fkn guy was basically patient zero, prolly got covid twice. Also about 99% sure he was the dude telling Griffin not to come to Boston, in no small part because half the team hated his ass for giving them all covid so he could get his dick wet."
Tristan Thompson is so bad 😂😂😂😂 he’s gonna be in Taiwan next season 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"They started Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson together. That’s their season in a nutshell. I was so perplexed by this I made a whole thread. In 2021, the way the modern game is, to start those 2 guys together it blew my mind. There was no amount of injuries that makes that acceptable"
Tristan Thompson moment
Stares at tristan Thompson
"Yes, to the Celtics for Tristan Thompson and Marcus Smart. Twist my arm and we'll throw in Grant Williams."
"There may not be a ring, but Pippen is kinda right anyway. The Cavs (LeBron) won two games in the finals in 2015 without Irving (who went down in the game 1 loss and Love.  Seriously. Their starters for those two games were:  Lebron  Tristan Thompson  Timofey Mozgov  Matthew Dellavadova  and  Iman Shumpert  Those guys would never be real starters again"
"Tristan Thompson was great too, that's why he got paid"
"He was shooting 30%... Tristan Thompson and Timothy Mozgov played better against GSW than Love and he's supposed to be a ""star"""
"Collins is so vital to Atlanta’s game. I would definitely love him on my team. He’s such a good rebounder, basically a Tristan Thompson but Collins can shoot 3s and score points in the paint. Plus his chemistry with Trae is at 100%. If Atlanta doesn’t resign Collins, idk what the fuck they are doing"
"I was gonna say the exact same thing. My wife knows next to nothing about the NBA, but she damn well knows who Tristan Thompson is."
"Tristan Thompson also averaged a double double.   10/10, but still"
"Rockets are better than a Team Canada that could run RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kelly Olynyk, Jamal Murray, Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, etc etc. Really dude?"
"She and Pippen split, but it seemed like he was trying hard to get her back. While she was seen with both Future and Beasley. Supposedly has stepped out with others as well. Tristan Thompson supposedly before Khloe Kardashian. Supposedly, Future's line about fucking your bitch in some Gucci flip flops was about Scottie Pippen."
"yeah I'd just be looking for him to compliment Smart &amp; Pritchard, don't need him playing 30 minutes nightly or carrying a huge load.  Just a guy who can help keep the ball moving, play some defense and handle a bit of offense as a 3rd/4th option.  Shouldn't cost more than a 2nd rounder to acquire I'd think, the only trick is what other moves the Celtics make and whether or not they have enough space under the hard cap to get him.  If they shed Tristan Thompson that should help, but depending on what the team does with Fournier they may not have enough room to fit $17M worth of Rubio on their cap sheet."
"I think that was because he had played for him before, not necessarily because they think he’s a franchise cornerstone. I’m sure they would have listened to Tristan Thompson if he had played for Udoka before"
Smart + Tristan Thompson for CJ works financially. No reason to involve Horford.    CJ is a pretty horrible fit for Boston though considering we would have zero playmaking and he is redundant with Fournier.
tristan thompson would start over boucher if every canadian was available
"No, because the Cavs would’ve just been the same as they had been from 2003-2010 and they wouldn’t be able to draft Kyrie or even Tristan Thompson had Lebron stayed with the Cavs past 2010"
"The discussion at the time was him, Tristan Thompson, or Jan Veselý, and Tristan Thompson went 4th."
"""Incompetence"" isn't a magic explanation for what happens in a lot of these cases.    Look at the Cavs.  They draft LeBron, try to surround him with talent (twice), but he continually refused to commit to the team long term.  As a result, free agents were not coming here, and then management is stuck overpaying Tristan Thompson ridiculous contracts to keep LeBron happy.  When players are joining up and moving to destination cities, no amount of ""competent"" or ""incompetent"" ownership is going to make a difference.    Do you really think LeBron went to the Lakers because of Mitch Kupchak or Jeanne Buss?  Hell no, he went because of Hollywood's ability to expand his burgeoning entertainment businesses.  Kyrie and KD went to Brooklyn because there was enough cap space and it was a destination city.  If I'm a player in the NBA, I'm looking to play in Florida, Texas, or another state with no state income tax."
"Which is wild cause Canada's golden generation is absurd.  Jamal Murray, Andrew Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, SGA, RJ Barrett, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, NAW, Khem Birch, Trey Lyles, Lu Dort, Chris Boucher, Brandon Clarke -- like that's alot of NBA level guys, some of which are projected to be stars asap, some which are now, some who can play D and shoot and grab boards.   No excuse for them not to get bronze or better. Like that list is deep."
Yeah dude Romeo Langford and Tristan Thompson are gems….       /s
wait DION WAITERS AND TRISTAN THOMPSON WERE TOP 5 PICKS??
"True, the 2011-2014 stretch was just stupid good for the Cavs. But the Magic have picked top 6 for multiple years (Oladipo, Gordon, Hezonja, Isaac, Bamba... you guys also traded the Sabonis pick which was 11) and I feel like those resources have been mostly traded away for nothing worthwhile.  I'd be upset with the front office more than anything. I'm not saying the Cavs front office is full of geniuses (Anthony Bennett? Dion Waiters? Tristan Thompson?) but I'd like to see the Magic retain and develop talent."
Lmao - makes me think of the Tristan Thompson - David West near kiss from the finals.
TIL Tristan Thompson was a top 5 pick. WHAT
"I mean he was very obviously used wrong in Philly and also the worst fit possible.   And do you even watch our games? Kemba would mostly look for his own shot, couldn't finish, and had an inconsistent shot. And then his knee would always get worse when it mattered, and at that point he'd just be trash. And there was no point to it all anyways because Tatum and Brown are both better scorers and Tatum is a better facilitator anyways.  Horford can defend the post and shoot, which we seriously lacked last season. We can just move on from Tristan Thompson, he's not that good. We can use Smart at the 1, which is better for our defense, and Horford is a better passer than anyone on the team anyways. Thinking that Kemba is a better fit is simply a case of getting too caught up in positions and losing sight of what the team actually lacks."
&gt; Still pretty integral in the Finals runs in Cleveland.  I would argue that Tristan Thompson killing the warriors inside after Bogut went down is what won them the championship.
"3 number 1 picks in 4 years when Lebron left and 2 number 4 picks.   Those players were Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters,  Anthony Bennett, Tristan Thompson and Andrew Wiggins (traded for Kevin Love)."
Thought that was Tristan Thompson
Tristan Thompson.....
"Fournier sign+trade + Romeo, Grant Williams, and Tristan Thompson gets the job done."
"&gt; Tristan Thompson married Khloe, and he’s now in Boston.  Sheesh"
*Tristan Thompson has entered the chat*
"Honestly, he should just be relegated to big man duty. If he played maybe a small ball five, maybe similar to an old Tristan Thompson style, he could just defend, rebound, set screens and throw outlet passes.   I don’t understand why he is a point guard. He doesn’t have any offensive ability besides passing and being athletic. He really shouldn’t be doing much besides passing the ball setting a screen and trying to get a rebound."
"I get that Ben had a horrific series. Basically his worst nightmare came to be.  But let's not act like Ben is complete and utter trash. He's a career 16-8-8 guy, third team all NBA last year, first team all defense this year and runner up for DPOY. Before his mental collapse he was one of the most dangerous players on the fast break in the NBA. He shoots 56% from the field for his career, and 60%% from the line (still abysmal but not other-worldly terrible like the 30% he shot this series). And he's 24 years old.  I know he has gotten exposed in the playoffs, but I just don't see how he can't be a key piece on a winning team. I bet there are several teams that would take a chance on him. And then there's the argument for what would happen if you built a team around Ben's abilities, as unorthodox as they are.  He had a really, really bad series, but you're acting like he's Tristan Thompson or something. I want him traded and think they need to do it, but we have to assess further out than this one series."
"The #1 pick was going to be Nerlens Noel until he hurt his knee.  After that, the Cavs wanted to make a push for the playoffs that year, and already were backlogged at the Guard position (Kyrie/Waiters), plus the PF/Center positons (Tristan Thompson, Anderson Varejao, Andrew Bynum), so they wanted someone who could fill the SF slot, and with how much a crapshoot the rest of the draft was, it made moderate sense to reach on him to fill a need.  He was going to be a lottery pick, so it wasn't a huge reach, but he turned out worse than anyone could've expected."
"I'm all for trying it out, but I can't imagine this is really the answer. Or maybe a better way to say it: if this IS the answer, I think he's just doomed to be a bad shooter. Tristan Thompson tried to switch hands, and it didn't help. If his right hand was actually that much better than his left, it would've been obvious to him a long time ago."
Unless it's delusional and totally serious. Like Tristan Thompson saying the east runs through the Cavs in 2018 lol
Tristan Thompson changed his shooting hand after his 2nd season in the league.
"Tristan Thompson tried switching hands, but it didn’t take."
"“We have more than enough shooting, lets trade some for tristan thompson” is also not a phrase any half decent gm would utter"
I just wanna play down low and get offensive rebounds like I’m Tristan Thompson lol only problem is I’m 5’10.
"It's all mental at this point. Something about shooting must've fucked him up sometime during his career. It reminds me of Nick Anderson missing those free throws against Houston in the 1995 Finals and it haunted him forever mentally.  At this point, he or Philly needs to let him see a sports psychologist or someone that can talk him through it mentally. If it's not mental, might as well try shooting right handed like Tristan Thompson. Nothing to lose at this point, it's more embarrassing being afraid to shoot than to actually miss."
The anti-Tristan Thompson
"Tristan Thompson, find a new slant"
Tristan Thompson in shambles
"Still don’t get why they didn’t trade him at the deadline for literally anything. Now you have his contract off your books but you don’t get anything for it because you’re already over the cap. Even if all you could get was a Tristan Thompson or whatever, they should have moved him."
Idk Ricky Rubio shot under 40% fg% and Pritchard is a promising backup that can actually shoot. Rubio is pretty ball dominant when they already have Tatum and Brown that can handle the ball besides smart.  I’d rather keep a quality piece in Tristan Thompson and promise in nesmith
Got Pritchard on the roster still. I’d expect you could also see a Tristan Thompson trade as well now that they have added 2 extra bigs
Like Tristan Thompson. Dude got PAID for being on the same team with the same agent as LeBron.
"They already have Tristan Thompson and Timelord, they didn’t need a 4th C with Horford coming back."
"At all, we were so bad but they couldn’t even do it and Tristan thompson was balling on them smh"
"I think he said that the problem was Tristan Thompson not caring about protocols, going out every night and him not getting along with other players but that was called bullshit by a number of players on the team🤷🏾‍♀️"
"It’s good in the backcourt and on the wing, but the bigs are dicey. Like, they’d have to live with some combination of Tristan Thompson, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, and Chris Boucher. They’re not bad in an Olympic context, but compared to the US or Serbia they’ll have a tough time."
"This right here.  The moment Bogut goes down we weren’t able to effectively stop attacks on the inside, so honestly at that point I agree, just go all out with the small ball.  Sure we would have gotten killed on the boards from Tristan Thompson, (as if that wasnt happening anyways) but man at least we would have someone out there not named varejao."
"Cavs were already over the cap when we signed Tristan Thompson, what would you have us do if we let him leave for nothing? Hope we could find someone that could replicate his performance with a vet min/MLE contract?Besides we won the 2016 Finals after we signed him to his new contract so it was well worth it."
"Coach! Because I think he's a great coach on the floor and player motivator who will get everyone to play up to their potenital,  but as a GM he seems to favor his guys which ends up in overpays (ie: Tristan Thompson, KCP, Etc...)"
"TBF, sometimes you get screwed by Tristan Thompson doing that."
"it saves the Celtics $$$ and gets them more cap flexibility sooner.  If they blow all that flexibility paying Evan Fournier I'll be disappointed, but if they're able to move Tristan Thompson for a ball handler (or add one otherwise, they still have TPE to use) it'll make a lot more sense.  I liked Kemba and it hurts to give up the 16th pick to move him, but I don't think his knees are going to get better and he'll always be exploitable in the playoffs due to his size.  This move gives the team more options to re-tool around the Jays while both are still under contract for multiple seasons."
kuzma for tristan thompson perchance?
Maybe he should do what Tristan Thompson did and switch shooting hands
"I’ll say the same thing about him I did about our young guys struggling to improve this year. COVID’s effect on practice time makes it really hard for developing players to learn the NBA game.   He’s inherently not a sure thing, but at the price point especially I’m a fan of adding him and hopefully finding someone who wants Tristan Thompson or relegating him to the bench and seeing what Rob and Moses can become."
yeah Robert Williams just can't stay healthy which left Tristan Thompson as our only healthy center who should be getting minutes in the playoffs. We were forced to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye way more than we would have liked.
The Al Horford and Tristan Thompson front court would have been excellent about 5 fucking years ago..  And they have Lob Billy and Moses Brown too. More trades are coming
"&gt;Celtics free up 9M in salary(roughly) to bring in a FA.  Ehh more about saving ownership a buck than anything else. Celtics only play is still resigning Fournier and using whatever exceptions we can manage; nothing changes on that front. And short of someone like Beal demanding to play in Boston we'd still need a ton to go our way to be players in 22-23's free agency/ offseason.  &gt;I don’t know if Horford is a true starter at this point in his career, but he will definitely be productive in Boston.  The problem here is our Center rotation is back to being bloated af with Robert Williams, Tristan Thompson, Al Horford, and Moses Brown all in play. Until we make another move we've effectively taken a step back in that regard."
"The Celtics still have Robert Williams, Horford, and Tristan Thompson at the 5 ahead of Brown.  They can probably trade Thompson's expiring for a player on a longer contract at a different position, but until then, Brown is in Tacko-territory."
"Don’t worry, it’s all coming together. Now we got Horford and Timelord as our backcourt, Moses Brown and Tristan Thompson as our wings, and Marcus Smart as our center. We’ll be unstoppable"
I imagine Tristan Thompson is gone either via trade or he just opts out I think Boston needs to get a point guard now that Kemba is gone
It was a panic signing to replicate Kyrie except ur never gonna replicate a guy of his caliber. Marcus would be a fine PG and Tatum and Brown can play the wings or you can start Fournier who was really redundant with Kemba there anyway. Horford also can space the floor.  Your starting lineup is   Smart who is one of the best defensive guards in the league and an excellent playmaker  Fournier who was averaging almost 20 in orlando  Tatum and Brown for the 3 and the 4  Horford who is a great defender and can shoot at center and this was a big weakness before as it was Tristan Thompson starting
Tristan Thompson and Dwight Howard will beat Wilt’s point record lol
Tristan Thompson to the Bucks in a mid-series trade?
Not that I think the results would change _too_ much but this should really be using EFG% instead of FG%. If Tristan Thompson is the _closest_ defender on anyone when they take a shot its most likely they will be near the rim where FG% is naturally higher. Conversely if a wing defender is guarding someone and they are the _closest_ defender there's a much higher chance it will be a midrange or 3pt shot (compared to someone like Deandre Jordan) so the FG% will naturally be lower.
"Hahaha, look at the poor Celtics fans, they won't get past the next game, watch this [Wojak](https://i.imgflip.com/2zutki.jpg) comment with something like ""yeah but we won a championship 35 years ago"". If Tatum could stop bricking so many shots, maybe they would be half decent. Or if someone better than Tristan Thompson would sign with them in free agency, oh wait they are way over the cap."
"Fournier, Kemba, and Tristan Thompson"
KD jawing with superflopper Smart and Kardasian satellite Tristan Thompson
"I'm a Celtics fan and hate other celtics fans. The Celtics subreddit the past two weeks has been so fucking awful. There was this one comment in a kyrie/Tristan Thompson hate thread where the top comment was ""we should have a 'fuck Kyrie' 'Black Lives Matter' chant during the game"". So fucking awful."
I wonder if the Celtics can try to find a simple way to attack the Nets defense when they go small?  Like Tristan Thompson has been sealing off guys like Tyler Johnson underneath the basket but the Celtics haven't really been able to find him.
Maybe the celtics should try to run more through Tristan Thompson.
"Tristan Thompson, Marcus Flopp, and Fournier are insufferable. Love the hustle by other C's, but their game plan is to hop on Tatum's back. I kind of want to see another Tatum carry job to watch the sub implode."
"They're struggling too much with Tristan fucking Thompson to make me believe they'll do anything against Brook Lopez, let alone Embiid."
"Makes sense. Seen this before with Tristan Thompson and the Cavs, and with Tobias Harris and the Sixers."
He was pretty good at at one point but is a specialty player. A slightly better Tristan Thompson
"You could fill a datacenter with videos of the amount of times lebron's insane passes did not end in a bucket because he was passing to Jae Crowder, Booby Gibson, Iman Shumpert, Mo Williams, Kay Felder, Sasha Pavlovic, Joel Anthony, Dahntay Jones, Delly (love him, but holy shit could he not shoot sometimes), Mozgov, Chris Andersen, Derrick Williams, Damon Jones, Eddie House, Tristan Thompson, Mario Chalmers, Shannon Brown, James Jones, Kendrick Perkins, Anderson Varejao, Ronny Turiaf, Udonis Haslem, CLE Rodney Hood, CLE Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green when it wasn't his 1 game of the month, Drew Gooden, Michael Beasley, George Hill, Jose Calderon, Donyell Marshall, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, David Wesley, Lonzo Ball, Larry Nance Jr, KYLE FUCKING KUZMA EVERY DAMN DAY EVEN AS I WRITE THIS, Shane Battier, Richard Jefferson, and DERON FUCKING WILLIAMS"
Irrelevant cuz Tristan Thompson and the Cs are about to win 4 straight and make Kyrie cry       /s
Kemba walker is barely a starter and no were near his Hornet days. Tristan Thompson is a role player and no were near his 2016 cavs days. Fournier who? And Marcus smart is the heart and soul of the team but he’s still a role player. Tatum is the only star. Sorry
"Celtics needed Tatum to drop 50, Marcus Smart to go 8/11 from the field, Tristan Thompson to score 19 and the entire Nets team except of Harden and KD to underperform massively just to win by 6 points"
"According to the article that you’ve posted, he said that while he didn’t experience it in Boston himself, plenty of other people have spoken up about it. That doesn’t mean that he has never been racially abused in a playoff setting. Nor does it invalidate him from not wanting to be racially abused in a city that has a history of doing so. His former Cavs teammate and a current Celtic, Tristan Thompson has also spoken up about the fact that the Boston crowd has racially abused him. Stop attacking someone for not wanting to be racially abused, you dolt. That is incredibly ignorant and only helps Boston in not being held accountable"
Tristan Thompson had a nice game too!
It will be competitive but watching Tristan Thompson bully the Nets in the paint makes we think what Giannis will do.
"We absolutely cooked Griffin, and thats us, where our best healthy big is Tristan Thompson. The Nets then are going through Giannis-Embiid-Davis/Gobert, they need to figure the defense out, especially under the basket"
"Bad timing because he just had his best game of the year, but Celtics fans have been watching Tristan Thompson play volleyball all fucking year. Ayton looks like Kareem in comparison."
"We need to box out better. We were giving wide open lanes for put back dunks to Tristan Thompson at least twice, and that's not because we are too small or anything, we literally gave TT a free runway"
"a few serious game threads ago i posted a comment saying that this series was going to be more competitive than people gave it credit for **if boston could play to their skill level**. i got downvoted immediately, but the proof is there now.  this game is exactly what i meant. KD scored 39, harden scored 41, and it still wasn't enough. we have a good team, our enemy is inconsistency and injury. but if tristan thompson plays like this the rest of the series, if tatum can light it up (not a 50 every game, but a good game every game) and kemba turns up too, then we have a fighting chance here to go to 7, and maybe snatch a pass to the second round.   i'm not confident, and i'm not saying it will happen, but this game proved that it's possible if the team is locked in."
"I mean Tristan Thompson drew a foul that went to review for a flagrant where he literally didn't get touched. Everyone saw his smirk, truly an Oscar worthy performance."
"Tristan Thompson sure knows how to say the right thing sometimes:  &gt; Tristan Thompson: ""I can’t fucking wait til Sunday. 17K. Green. I’m gonna see the Leprechaun. That’s what it’s all about.""  https://twitter.com/JaredWeissNBA/status/1398501893639270401?s=20"

"just as everybody expected, the offensive firepower of Tatum, Tristan Thompson, and Marcus Smart was too much for the Nets."
"Neither this Clippers roster nor that Cavs roster was 'dog shit'. They have depth but not much shooting. How is it dog shit when you have Rondo and Beverly as your 7th and 8th men off the bench. Cavs had two star players and a lot of very good role players and shooters. Korver, Jordan Clarkson, Hood, Tristan thompson, Nance Jr. Thats a lot better than most teams 6-10 rotation."
"The Nets will win this series, but hopefully now some people will realize they aren't unbeatable. They are the favorites and will be until they are eliminated or have already won the title, but this game shows that they have deficiencies that aren't easily mitigated.   KD and Harden combined for 80+ and they still lost. Tristan Thompson absolutely murdered them under the rim, and he's an offensively limited player who isn't able to play the minutes they would like him to because of it. Not only do the Bucks and Sixers have more bigs that can outrebound them, but they have more defenders to make the Big 3's lives more difficult on offense.   Should be an interesting playoffs in the East."
&gt; also happened before your parents were old enough to think about producing spawn like you.  Did Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson play back then?
"What an outstanding game from Tatum, and let's not forget some great contributions from the likes of Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart, and Evan Fournier."
"Imagine having KD, Harden, and Kyrie (AND the refs) and still losing a playoff game to Kemba-Smart-Fournier-Tatum-Tristan fucking Thompson lmao"
If Tristan Thompson is dominating the glass like that I can't think what Brook/Giannis or Embiid would do to them.You love to see it.
Tristan thompson tackling guys... refs scared of that Celtics crowd
Tristan Thompson really fouled Harris tho
People celebrating the Marcus Smart kickout and Tristan Thompson flop now furious as the refs.
Tristan Thompson putbacks and Evan Fournier corner threes are okay in my book
Turns out the east still runs through Tristan Thompson
KD needs more help to handle Tristan Thompson
Is Tristan Thompson the best center in the league?
Everything I ever said about Tristan Thompson this season has been disproved tonight.
I’m getting PTSD to the 2016 finals the way Tristan Thompson is playing
TRISTAN GOD DAMN THOMPSON
"Nets made Tristan Thompson look good, they're gonna struggle against Embiid, Giannis, or AD"
NBA champion Tristan Thompson
TRISTAN WILT THOMPSON
This looks like 2016 finals Tristan Thompson
"In all fairness how could a team like the Nets expect to compete with the big three of: Jason Tatum, Marcus Smart and Tristan Thompson"
Nets getting hoed by Tristan Thompson 😹😹😹
Tristan Thompson with a big 15 and 9
Losing to a Celtics team without Jaylen Brown with your starting C getting sonned by Tristan Thompson...
I love fucking Tristan Thompson
If Tristan Thompson is doing this to them what are Brook Lopez and Giannis gonna do
I love Tristan fucking Thompson
I think the Celtics just played that bad. The Nets interior defense in particular is bad. That’s why Robert Williams and Tristan Thompson are feasting. I don’t see the Nets getting past both the Bucks and 76ers.
Nets defense rejuvenating Tristan Thompson career
the Celtics have won the 2020-2021 NBA finals and Tristan Thompson is MVP
"Man, if tristan thompson is giving the nets problems, what the fuck are they gonna do against Giannis and JoJo"
tristan thompson looks like michael b jordan imo
Claxton getting sonned by Tristan Thompson lol. Would love to see how he does against AD/Lebron/Drummond if the Nets and Lakers make the Finals.
Have you ever sparred with a guy who is better than you? Lol people speaking out of their asses. Weight matters but just because Tristan Thompson is 6’10 it doesn’t mean he will beat up someone who’s 6’1 and has experience....
"I don’t think trae noticed lol, not during the game itself. Hard to do anything when you only notice it on video after the game. 50 cents’ woman definitely noticed tho. Definitely wish Tristan Thompson could go over to that trash knick fan’s house and deal out some retribution lol"
Tristan Thompson came out and said he’s received racist comments while at Celtics games and I doubt he’s the only one. If he didn’t know about it that says something about his lack of care.
Why are you asking me? All I was saying comparing Tristan fucking Thompson to Thor is insane. But watch some early UFC pride fights like Fedor vs Hong Man Choi or Mirko vs Hong Man Choi and Choi was much larger than Thompson.
True but you used Halfthor who you called “large actor” who weighs 150 pounds more than Tristan Thompson
The thought of Tristan Thompson following me in a big Escalade or something sounds unnerving
Who is getting banned from NBA arenas over Tristan Thompson? Sounds like low value to me
Until Tristan Thompson follows you home.
Tristan “Kyrie Irving” Thompson
"&gt; Ok scratch that game from the record. 17-15 when their 3 best players play is still not good  Lol... and you're still counting a bunch of games where we've been massively injured?  For example the game before that:  * Kemba had only just come back from his knee procedure and was still on minute restrictions * Tatum had just come back from covid * Brown was starting to miss time due to tendonitis * Payton Pritchard was also out with an MCL  You're looking at games without any understanding of what was happening in those games.   Instead of blindly throwing numbers around, if you actually looked at those ~30 games you'd see there's a lot more going on than you realise.  &gt;Small sample size + seemingly cherrypicked   Why do you think the sample size is small?   We played 72 games and had our core 4 together for less than we did during the 17 games of playoffs last year.    Period| Games Played| Minutes Played ---|---|---- 2020 playoffs (17 games)| 17| 349 2020-21 Season (72 games)| 17| 292   You're using these stats terms without any understanding of how/why they're relevant.  ""small sample size"" - Yeah exactly my point.  &gt; every team dealt with injuries this season.   All you're doing here is showing you don't understand scale.   Injuries aren't binary.  Phoenix having their top played lineup for 52 games and 706 minutes is very different to Boston having their top played lineup for 11 games and 131 minutes.  Just to put it into perspective, your top-played lineup this year had 22 games played. Twice our top played lineup. So no, your situation isn't comparable to ours.    &gt;To players like Robert Williams (one of the most injury prone players in the league), Romeo Langford (injury prone &amp; is not good), Nesmith (not good yet), and Tristan Thompson   I wasn't even counting the injuries to Langford and Nesmith (who didn't miss much time at all).  As I said, I'm talking purely:  1. Our top 4 players  2. Our playoff rotation  Langford and Nesmith aren't part of either."
"&gt;For example, one of those losses you've listed was a 1 point loss to the Lakers:  Ok scratch that game from the record. 17-15 when their 3 best players play is still not good  &gt;The Celtics are 8-2 when Kemba, Smart, Brown and Tatum are all playing without minute restrictions.  Small sample size + seemingly cherrypicked + every team dealt with injuries this season. I'm sure quite a few of those 8 wins where the celtics top 4 players were all nearly completely healthy were against either really bad teams, or teams dealing with injuries to their top guys  &gt;Plus, as Spinexel mentioned, we also had other injuries / covid cases outside of those 4.  To players like Robert Williams (one of the most injury prone players in the league), Romeo Langford (injury prone &amp; is not good), Nesmith (not good yet), and Tristan Thompson"
Kuz doing his best Tristan Thompson impression.
"James Harden had his worst season when he did, Tristan Thompson got outrebounded by Steph in a finals after he started"
"Are you really trying to act like Richard Jefferson and Tristan Thompson were on par with Draymond? Klay is also a much better two way player than Love, and GS had better depth. C’mon man."
Tristan Thompson is playing for Canada? I thought he just became a US citizen
"And the way to protect your weaker defensive wing after that switch ? Having an effective rim protector behind him.  Very few teams play 5 out, guys like Brook Lopez, Gobert, Noel, Embiid were the key to elite defense this season again.  You look at all the players who've closed games at center for finals team recently : AD, Bam, Draymond, Marc Gasol, Ibaka, Tristan Thompson, Bosh, Duncan,...  Most those teams had weaker links defensively (the Cavs were not a good defensive team) but were still elite defensively"
"And Wiggins, RJ Barrett, NAW (Shai’s actual cousin), Tristan Thompson, Dillon Brooks, Brandon Clarke, and Dwight Powell. The only guys not going to training camp so far are Murray &amp; Shai. Murray must be faking too lol. According to you, Shai rests the entire back half of the season healthy, and is still skipping out on all the marketing and endorsements that would come from being THE guy for team Canada, in order to be ready for the tanking Thunder’s start of the season. How much rest does he need lol?"
"To expand on this, the Suns signed him using the non-taxpayer mid-level exception, which is the main way for over-the-cap playoff teams to add role players in free agency.  The Suns used theirs on Crowder, Portland used theirs on Derrick Jones Jr, we split ours across JaMychal Green (7.5) and Bol Bol (2-ish), Utah used theirs on Derrick Favors, Boston on Tristan Thompson, Toronto split theirs across Aron Baynes (7) and Alex Len (2-ish) and Washington used some of theirs to give Robin Lopez 7.2  Just looking at what other teams did with their MLE last year, I would bet Crowder had other bidders and Phoenix had to go the 3 years to bring him in."
"Oh yea, I mean look at these NBA lineups for last 2 months:  PG: Jamal Murray (21.2 pts/4 rbs/4.8 ats per game)  SG: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (23.7 pts/4.8 rbs/5.9 ats per game)  SF: Luguentz Dort (19.5 pts/4.4 rbs/2.2 ats per game)  PF: Chris Boucher (14.1 pts/6.7 rbs/1.1 ats per game)  C: Kelly Olynyk (19.1 pts/8.6 rbs/4.2 ats per game)  Bench:   PG: Cory Jospeh  SG: RJ Barrett  SF: Andrew Wiggins  PF: Dwight Powell  C: Khem Birch  Super-bench:  PG: Nickeil Alexander-Walker  SG: Trey Lyles  SF: Dillon Brooks  PF:  Dwight Powell  C: Tristan Thompson"
The list I saw on Twitter had Tristan Thompson on it u/NAD_83
Those Tristan Thompson/Draymond Green illegal screen battles were a sight to behold.
"Yeah I'm just gonna ignore you. I recognize your username. You've been defending Lue since the Cavs days and you actually thought Tristan Thompson was worth $80 mil. You once wrote ""NOW WE CAN SEE WHAT LUE CAN DO WITHOUT LEBRON"".   Laughable."

"Tristan Thompson, Kyle Lowry, and Andre Drummond are all you need for the answer to that question."
"Not to take away from Durant, but does defending Tristan Thompson really count as defending the 5?"
Tristan Thompson did that same shit Saric did falling out of bounds last game.... maybe if you're blindly chucking the ball towards the opponents basket when you're out of the play... maybe don't do that
The one where he flopped on Tristan Thompson (his teammate at the time) will forever be my favorite lol
We running our offense through Tristan fucking Thompson in a Playoff game in 2021 bruh 💀 💀 💀
Loved Tristan Thompson on the cavs
Imagine ever thinking Tristan Thompson was good lmao
tristan thompson starting the break for the nets
lmao its annoying watching tristan thompson dude sucks
Have we got one mention of Tristan Thompson and Kyrie Irving being on a championship team together yet or being drafted the same year by the same team?
"I saw kd, kyrie, harden, grant williams, luke kornet, carsen edwards, tremont waters, romeo langford, semi ojeleye, tristan thompson at that exact same party as Porzingis"
"Think more Tristan Thompson and Andre Drummond. This scenario is more if you had an expansion draft, and for some stupid reason the Nets let go of KD and Harden"
"I used to play against Jamal Magloire back in his Uni days. You know how people always say he wasnt that great, All Star selection notwithstanding?  Yeah, no one, and I mean NO ONE could stop that man, he didn't even try that hard, just stood up top and shot, occasionally destroying some poor soul down low.  His little bro, Justin (RIP), was way better, had to play against him in High School. He was on another stratosphere against high school kids. He didn't hold back, like his bro did, he would yam all over everybody whenever he could, lol...  Also played playground ball against Andrew Nicholson, also unstoppable on the playground.  Watch Anthony Bennet DOMINATE at the local gym with Tristan Thompson.  No All Stars, just NBA players, some fringe, but no on could do anything against any of them.  It wasn't even fair."
NBA has this warped notion that you need a team full of offensive shooting threats to win the league when that has seldom been the case.   Lebron's teams always had a center (like Tristan Thompson) who couldn't shoot nor was a real offensive threat. Warriors had Dray.
"If everyone was healthy and wants to play we would have:   SGA, Murray, Wiggins, Dort, Boucher, Brooks, Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Khem Birch, Oshae Brissett, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell, NAW from the Pels, Cory Joseph"
"Off the top of my head we have Olynyk, Khem Birch, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson, and Dwight Powell. I'm not sure which of them will decide to play though."
Don’t disrespect Tristan Thompson &amp; half the wizards starting 5 like this
"Lol, I do..always!  He reps Canada hard and wants to play each year, plus is besties with Jamal Murray and was one of the early commits last year and again this year too.  Honestly love his game and followed his whole career and because he played a few years of college and was a 2nd round draft pick to a weak team his buzz was never huge.  Showed flashes of promise late in his rookie year by than was injured his entire 2nd year.    He came back and had a great 3rd year lady year and now in his 4rth year he is A 2-way star, or close to it all season for Memphis.  He is a slightly better RJ Barrett type but will eventually get passed by RJ if RJ keeps going the way he is.  It's unlikely Brooks makes an all-star by game, but he will be near that level for a few years in his prime for sure.  He might be our 4rth or 5th main player in Victoria, or 5th to 7th with our complete team including Murray and all out stars.  Clearly we need some bigs to show up an play big for us, but I f I ranked guys right now, he may even be #4 or 5th, behind only Jamal, Shai and Wiggins and possibly be tied with RJ. Than Nekeil Alexander Walker.  Kelly Olynyk, Chris Boucher, Tristan Thompson would all be very close too.  Than, very close behind your next tier by would be the Brandon Clarke's, Khem Birch, Lugentze Dort, Dwight Powel, Oshai Brissett"
And Tristan Thompson outrebounding half of the team
"I can't believe the Celtics didn't want this guy...  Like, ok, you don't want to pay 18m to Myles Turner, but then you turn around and give 9.5m to fucking *Tristan Thompson*?"
dj has been plenty paid. it's not like he's tristan thompson. i blame them for not recognizing that jarrett allen was the guy who should be center.
"The series was a lopsided 6 games (Warriors +50) and Tristan Thompson, only getting heavy minutes because Love was out, wrecked us on the boards. We’d have abused Love routinely had he played.   The Warriors were very clearly the better team, healthy Cavs or not."
They need a better big than Tristan Thompson too
Get Tristan Thompson off the goddamn floor he is killing us
Tristan Thompson makes for an excellent tank commander.
Tristan Thompson is getting abused by everyone on the Jazz lmao
"In scenarios with players like Lin, the question that should be asked is what can he currently contribute to an NBA team?  He was never a particularly good shooter, didn’t defend well either, and wasn’t really much of a playmaker outside of PnRs.   His best trait was his speed/quickness and first step, but that seems to have disappeared due to injury and age.   Maybe a vet mentorship role? But he seems to want playing time.   Role players in the NBA usually have at least one definable skillset that makes them standout, such as Jordan Clarkson with scoring, Tristan Thompson with rebounding/hustle, Rubio with passing/playmaking, JJ Redick with shooting, etc.   Unless Lin has become a sharpshooter or developed some other valuable skillset, he’s probably not going to be make it back in the league."
Tristan Thompson you mean
Kevin Durant and James Harden to the Celtics  Jeff Teague and Tristan Thompson to the Nets  And we both give a second round pick to the Wizards because we feel bad.
I'm excited for the Bleacher Report article suggesting the Suns send Booker over for Tristan Thompson and a 2nd-rounder.
"The Minnesota Timberwolves have traded Karl Anthony Towns and DLo for Kemba Walker, Tristan Thompson, Marcus Smart and 3 first round draft picks."
"RJ Barrett, Chris Boucher, Kelly Olynyk, Corey Joseph, Tristan Thompson, Jamal Murray"
"This is an awful take. LeBron was the best player on the floor by far, but you don’t take that warriors team to 7 without help  Kyrie - 27/4/4 Tristan Thompson - 10/10  JR Smith - 11/3/2 and some big time shots K-Love was pretty trash overall, but he had one of the biggest defensive stops in nba history"
"Because we have Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson. All need to play. That’s why I literally said we are trying to move a center not get one, that is to make space for Timelords playing time, which by the way has been 20 minutes per over the last while."
"I don’t know how the season will play out given how close all these teams are to each other, but I do think there’s some context missing about our losses to you. Not only didn’t we have Kemba in both our losses, but we were also missing Smart (who we’ve been missing all year) and in our first loss, we also didn’t have Theis. As a result we had Jaylen Brown as point guard in our first game against you in a lineup with Tatum/Javonte Green/Semi Ojeleye/Tristan Thompson. This was against Trae/Huerter/Reddish/Collins/Capela. In our second loss, we were on a back to back on the road having played four games in six days and we had Jeff Teague starting. In the one game Kemba played, he led our team in scoring, plus minus, and steals and really was the difference throughout the game."
I think there's a good chance tristan thompson will be traded somewhere
"Tristan Thompson made off like a bandit too.  5 years/$82 mil, for an 9/9 guy who was often injured afterwards."
Tristan Thompson available
"I don't think people would be as mad at that love contract if the dude ever showed up. He's been made of bandaids since he lost his minnesota weight, and is one of the worst defenders I've ever seen. As much of an overpay Tristan Thompson was, at least when he hustles he passed the eye test.  Kevin Love fucking sucks"
"hmm, maybe it should happen.  draymond and zion to the celtics for langford, tristan thompson, and every pick we have until 2035"
Tristan Thompson is not our starting center.
His sprint was slower than Kyle Singler and his lane agility was slower than Tristan Thompson. He really wasn't athletic by any measure.
Fans: We want a Blockbuster trade  Danny Ainge: We have a blockbuster trade at home   Blockbuster trade at home: Tristan Thompson and a second for Baynes
"&gt;Celtics trade for: Chris Boucher   &gt;   &gt;Raptors get: Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, 2 FRP in 2022 and 2024  What the fuck? 2 lottery picks + 2 FRP'S?  Boucher is great, but for that price tag? Hell no.  &gt;DEAL 2:   &gt;   &gt;Celtics trade for: Lonzo Ball and Wily Hernangomez   &gt;   &gt;Pelicans get: Marcus Smart and Payton Pritchard  Lonzo Ball has been shooting lights out, but he's not a better defender than Smart (heart and soul of our team too,) and why the fuck are we losing all of our guard depth? I'd rather keep Smart + PP over Lonzo Ball.  Ball is gonna get paid + RFA. We could lose him.   DEAL 3:  &gt;Celtics trade for: PJ Tucker   &gt;   &gt;Rockets get: Tristan Thompson and 2022 2nd Rd. Pick   &gt;   &gt;Use Exception to SIGN **Andre Drummond** \[offer him guaranteed big role\] and cut Theis/Wily  You're fucking high."
"Yea i dont really see alotof real life trades out there... heavily centered around either tristan Thompson or andre drummomd, niether of which even remotely fit on our roster"
He could play 36 minutes however he doesn’t because Tristan Thompson and Daniel Theis also need to play

"He’s actually been starting next to Tristan this season so sorta, although he’s definitely better at the 5. Although if the question is on fit with Porzingis, that would probably be a better fit than with Thompson."
"Shouts out to the time Steph Curry got more rebounds in a single finals game than Tristan Thompson had in the whole Finals series up to that point. Bullyball Steph is real, and must be feared"
LeBron dragged Tristan Thompson and the ghost of JR Smith kicking and screaming to the 2018 finals by being our entire offense

"S&amp;T isn’t what hard caps us. To my understanding, it was signing Tristan Thompson that does so. We used the non-tax payer MLE to get him, which means we can’t go over the tax apron. This gives us about 22 million of free space without shedding salary. The TPE is worth 28.5."
"&gt;cannot play the way he wants to in Boston where JT and JB need the ball so much and are not nearly as good playmakers.  Rozier (23.7%, 23.3%) has thrived on lower usage than Kemba (27.2%, 27.5%) both of the last two seasons.  He certainly wanted a bigger role than he had next to/backing up Kyrie (Rozier's usage their year together was 18.3%), but that opportunity was there if the C's just bought into him as a starter.  &gt;Kemba's also basically an upgrade over Rozier in every respect including Rozier's best skill, shooting.  Have you looked at their stats?  Rozier has been better across the board for shooting, especially this year where he's a top 20 shooter in the league from 3.  That's ideal if you're thinking of how someone can play in as a third option.   Thinking that Rozier's superior shooting and efficiency wouldn't be ideal next to Tatum and Brown is really looking through some Ainge-tinted glasses.  &gt;we still have plenty of time left with him.   That's kind of the problem though, isn't it?  Even if he gets healthy, you have 2-3 years (maybe) of his late prime left, and by the time his salary clears your books, Brown, Tatum and Smart (assuming you re-sign him) take up most of your cap space.    If you had Rozier, you'd have 6-8 more years of expected prime performance, and you could currently have had $20M more in cap space to use on depth or at least somebody better than Tristan Thompson.  You have an amazing team (certainly better than your record), but I would bet that spinning this trade as a win is going to feel more and more difficult as time goes on."
"i mean he can have a good role in boston they're starting tristan thompson right now lol  hayward did fine last year, that's the job that's up for grabs with the TPE right now"
"Your comprehension skills are wanting  We trade LeBron, Kyrie, Love, and Tristan Thompson in 2018 and we reload with young talent and draft picks. Just look at the Celtics after the Big 3"
"Yes, their current starter is Daniel Theis, and he would either move to the bench or move up to center and replace Tristan Thompson.  Theis or Thompson would then be the starting center depending on matchup.  Drummond is poop.  And it sounds like the Magic want 3 firsts and a young player or 2 (Nesmith/Langford or Pritchard?) for Vooch if they're trading with Boston from rumors I've seen."
"No one said purposely trying to lose, and im basically the only fan who will say this repetitively. Im constantly being downvoted by my own fanbase for my unpopular opinion. Ive been saying since Hayward walked, this team cant win as currently constructed. 22 year olds dont carry teams to rings. Veterans with bum knees dont last to the finals. A bench with all 24 and younger players is not a good bench. Our entire supporting cast is Smart Theis Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague and neither of our young stars are ready for the finals. I understand you just want to meme on boston fans but look at this team objectively and tell me why they should even compete for a finals spot nevermind win it. This roster is in development mode waiting for Kembas contract to expire"
"Thats the thing about young players, they develop. But shoot, if in all your wisdom you don’t deem any of our high draft picks outside of LeBron to be any good I don’t know what to tell you. Carlos Boozer, Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, Wiggins, Sexton, Garland, and Okoro aren’t exactly a black eye on the organization. We missed on Anthony Bennett but he was good enough to package with Wiggins and land Kevin Love. Not a whole lot of lottery picks outside of them considering we were consistently in the playoffs from 2005-2010 and in the Finals (that’s the series you play to win the championship) from 2015-2018. Oh, I forgot those dont count because LeBron was raised in Northeast Ohio...where are Kawhi and PG from again?"
"Better with an engaged Kemba over a disengaged Kyrie. Kyrie looks pretty darn engaged in Brooklyn though, i dint think we see that same guy if he stayed with us in Boston. It is what it is, loosing Kyrie basically commited us to the super young reb2uold which NO ONE seems to acknowledge for some reason.  We have a roater with Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague as our veterans and people are shocked a 22 year old Tatum isnt just dad dicking the league yet. 10 of our players are 24 or younger, we are basically waiting on Kembas contract to expire at this point and developing Rob Pritchard Romeo and Nesmith"
"Cavs LeBron has the GOAT flop imo. Literally got sent across the court by Tristan Thompson, his own teammate."
I feel Tristan Thompson fits the Celtics well but maybe I don't watch enough
Tristan Thompson + Iman Shumpert + the Nets pick
tristan thompson has been terrible on D this season
"ugh, this again.   Trades do not need to be structured the same way on both sides.   It is perfectly legal for Boston to do *whatever* to send out salary sufficient to stay under the hard cap.   The trade could be structured from Boston's end like this:   Tristan Thompson to SA for a 1-55 protected pick that will never convey.  LMA to Boston (absorbed into TPE) for a 2nd round pick.  While on SA's end, it could be structured as a single trade in which they get back more than they send out."
"They are hard-capped, though. They'd have to send something back to get under the hard cap.    Either one of Theis or Tristan Thompson both make the math work."
"Nope. You can take back any player into the TPE who makes less than the value of the TPE without sending back matching salary. If a player makes *more* than the TPE, the TPE does nothing for you.   The TPE Boston has is 28.5 million, so most players fit into it. Their problem is that they're hard capped because they signed Tristan Thompson to the non-taxpayer Midlevel Exception, so they cannot at any point go above the Apron. They have a hair under 19.8m in space under the Apron. So while they could take back a guy making 28m, they'd have to send away a little over 8m to do so.  Also, if they combine contracts to do that and go under the minimum roster size, they need to send out more to account for the new minimum-salaried guy to fill the roster slot.   For Miami, they can take back a player making up to 7.5m into that trade exception without sending back salary, but they cannot use that as matching salary to take back a bigger contract."
"Would have to face the Cavs in the East still.  Kyrie, Joe Harris, Lebron, Jae Crowder, Tristan Thompson  Bench: Garland, Sexton, Wiggins, Danny Green, Dion Waiters, Tyra Jones  Would probably beat y’all out"
"Boston is my vote.  Tristan Thompson has been a disappointment, Timelord is too inconsistent, Theis is fine but could slide to the four some and LMA would be a huge upgrade anyway.  Not only do the Cs lack a strong interior presence they are just short on rotation pieces.  After the Jays their top minutes guys are TT, Theis, Semi and Pritchard.  Even as Smart and Kemba return from injury they still could use another piece and a starting quality big could make a huge difference."
"&gt; nt the same team lol. Either way, the Cavs were just as talented as the Warriors. After Lebron they had Kyrie, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love. Kyrie was a beast and outperformed Curry that year. Then JR and Tristan are the best roleplayers you can have. Cavs were so good you have to ask Lebron why weren’t they winning 73 games themselves lol  Holy shit lmfao. Incredible mental gymnastics.   &gt;So that’s my question to you. If Lebron is so good and so great as he claims he is, why hasn’t he ever won 70+ games in the regular season just as Jordan and Curry did? He had just as good teams as those two, especially with the Heat. Again, Lebron is great, but he’s overrated. I won’t be surprised if he pays the media to prop him up. Or maybe the media is just desperate to see another Jordan for ratings even though he clearly isn’t.  Damn you’re right. Curry is clearly the 2nd greatest player of all time."
He was an integral piece in their championship. Dieng can't even start on non playoff teams and you comparing him to someone who was an important piece on a championship team? I'm his prime he was definitely closer to a Tristan Thompson caliber player.
"So what you’re telling me is that when Dwight could guard on the perimeter he was a DPOY and now that he can’t guard on the perimeter he’s a liability, hmmmm sounds like that’s what I’ve been saying. If you can’t guard on the perimeter then you’re a liability. Old centers (obviously not all of them, like Hakeem would be fine) couldn’t guard on the perimeter.  Butler is an elite finisher at the rim and Dragic was playing the best basketball of his entire career in the bubble and was also a great finisher at the rim. I’m not saying these guys were like Tony Allen our there but they were competitive when switching. I’d rather a contested shot at the rim than an open mid range jumper. 90% of Boston’s offense came from starters because Boston essentially had a 6.5 rotation. It was reliant on Tatum and Brown taking over because Kemba couldn’t operate in the PnR because of Bam’s switching.  Teams have been winning titles with great 3pt shooting since LeBron’s first title in Miami. Since then the only championship team without excellent 3 shooting was last year when LA had 2 top 5 players on one team. Analytics just hadn’t hit basketball until this decade, so teams just weren’t smart enough to realize this.  Players being smart enough to manipulate defenses to foul them doesn’t change how offense is run. It’s just an added skill that the top iso players now have. Giving more freedom to perimeter players, giving them more opportunity to either drive and kick and having guys good enough to just pull up off a screen, that’s changed the modern day offense.  Also bro you really can’t just be looking at raw shooting percentages for determining quality of 3pt shooting? I guess that means that last season Dame (40% from 3) was just a little bit better of a 3pt shooter than Tristan Thompson (39% from 3). The average 3pt shot from the 90s was a relatively open shot. In the 2000s a little bit less so with guys taking more pull-ups and a bit more contested shots. Now today guys are taking moving, contested, step backs, and 30+ footers. The skill in those shots are not equal.  I don’t know why you think analytics have fooled anyone, haven’t you ever been told that numbers don’t lie. That’s not to say that a 3pt is the right shot in every scenario: up by like 10 with 3 minutes left, absolutely just go for a two if it’s a higher percentage shot, but analytics tells us that too. You talk down on the strategy that analytics tells us to run (shoot as many 3s, layups, and free throws as humanly possible) but that works when you have the personal to run it. You realize that theory got the Rockets closer than anyone else to beating the best team in NBA history? Now I know you’ll probably just say “well that’s what costed the game” and I disagree. Not being able to make a shot to save their lives in the 2nd half costed them that game. CP3 being injured costed them that game. Fatigue as a whole costed them that game. Their offensive strategy was the only reason they were even in that game/series."
"73 win team that team was built for the regular season. They overachieved. Besides you forgot Curry injured his knee in that playoffs and wasnt 100%? Draymond was suspended 1 game? Bogut was injured? That wasnt the same team lol. Either way, the Cavs were just as talented as the Warriors. After Lebron they had Kyrie, JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love. Kyrie was a beast and outperformed Curry that year. Then JR and Tristan are the best roleplayers you can have. Cavs were so good you have to ask Lebron why weren’t they winning 73 games themselves lol  So that’s my question to you. If Lebron is so good and so great as he claims he is, why hasn’t he ever won 70+ games in the regular season just as Jordan and Curry did? He had just as good teams as those two, especially with the Heat. Again, Lebron is great, but he’s overrated. I won’t be surprised if he pays the media to prop him up. Or maybe the media is just desperate to see another Jordan for ratings even though he clearly isn’t."
Tristan Thompson in shambles
"We can't use the full value until the offseason *unless* we shed some salary to get under the hard cap.   Right now we're about $20m under the tax apron/hard cap  - if we dumped a contract in the ballpark of ~10m or so without taking anything back (Tristan Thompson for example) that would give us enough to use the full 28.5M.   The other option is to wait until the offseason when everything resets, and then we'll be able to use the full value. But you'd have to be very confident in what the market would look like."
"For what it's worth, this came out somewhat recently that seems to indicate that he doesn't have a great diet, but it also isn't necessarily the truth.  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/02/lebron-james-worst-diet-ever-tristan-thompson"
Would a team whose best players are an aging Kemba and Tristan Thompson do well? Yes or no?
"I think the non-tax MLE is the more likely of the two. It’s what Favors and Tristan Thompson got, and I think that’s the market for fringe starting centers/high-level backups."
"Tristan Thompson? There was a lot of smoke that we wanted him last year, and we ended up getting him."
"the only one that wasn't there was Tristan Thompson. Idk why but that is hilarious to me, must've had quality date night planned with Khloe, totally not cheating or anything..😂"
"I didn’t ignore your last sentence, just doesn’t mean that much.  Why do you think golden age centers would fair any better than these dudes (also love that you include Kanter cuz he’s literally the poster boy of how much harder it is to be a center today than 30 years ago).  Also Theis is a good defender for the modern NBA. Yea he can’t stop Embiid 1 on 1, there’s probably only been about 10 people in the history of Earth who could. Saying he gets abused against competent centers just shows a lack of understanding for the Celtics defensive scheme. Their play is all about ball denial and holding strong in the perimeter, Theis excels at that for a center. Just cuz he can’t stop the guy once he’s got the ball in good post position doesn’t mean he’s a bad defender, you’re just not paying attention at the right times. Any fan who wants Drummond is just a nephew who doesn’t understand defense (also Drummond is a terrible post defender).  I also like how you casually ignore guys like Bam, Hordord (of 4 years ago), and Tristan Thompson (of 4 years ago) who ate all very good switchable bigs.  Teams as a whole have 100% gotten better. 80s-90s defenses would not beable to handle all the action and shooting in a modern day offense. It’s a natural progression of sports. In 20-30 years this era will also be worse comparably."
Wait... which one is tristan thompson?
"Well yeah, one’s a current back to back MVP and on the short list of most talented players in the NBA and the other one is Tristan Thompson. It means a lot more coming from someone of Giannis’ stature."
"For the most part yes. Throughout their entire title run, the Warriors had a rotating cast of centers. David Lee. Andrew Bogut. Kevon Looney. etc.   The Raptors problems come more from having both Serge Ibaka and Mark Gasol leave in one offseason and they either didn't have the guys on the roster or sign anyone in free agency to replace those players. Ibaka and Gasol are both pick-n-pop bigs who can protect the rim, and losing Gasol's passing was a big blow to their offense and the sets they could run off that.   Baynes has the pick-n-pop going, but can't stay on the court defensively. He started off hot for Phoenix last year, but he got worse as the year went on and even when he was producing it wasn't on the defensive end of the floor. Boucher looks really good and can provide *some* rim protection, but he is way too skinny and can get bullied by bigger guys with regularity.   Celtics have the same issue. Since trading Isaiah Thomas, the Celts have lost and/or traded: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, and Jae Crowder. They have replaced those guys with Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams, Kemba Walker, Daniel Theis, and Jeff Teague.  Just from a pure talent standpoint, they have lost significantly at every position, and they haven't drafted well to replace what they lost. Kemba is playing better as of late, but he is still a defensive sieve and Teague has been a total loss for this team. Theis is good and gives great effort, but he is undersized at the position and gets dad dicked with regularity.   The Celtics are missing more than a true center, and even if they did have one to anchor their defense (Timelord looks like the player they need at C), they have such a lack of depth on the wing and guard positions that they would still be struggling."
Danny Ainge on the phone with Meyers' agent to offer Tristan Thompson and a supermax as we speak.
But when Tristan Thompson says something similar to this about his own team he got clowned on for it.....
Except with rim protectors like Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson?
"My best case scenario Canada team  First line  Sga, RJ Barrett, Andrew Wiggins, Chris Boucher, Kelly olynyk  Second line  Cory Joseph, Dillion Brooks, Lu dort, Brandon Clarke, Khem birch   Third line  Kevin pangos, Nickel Alexander-walker, oshae Brissett, Dwight powell and Tristan Thompson"
1.	Marcus Smart isoing 2.	Grant Williams or Semi Ojeleye checking in 3.	Tristan Thompson posting up
It’s why I’ve never been a fan of his. He’s constantly whining and looking for calls. It’s embarrassing. Best one was the playoffs years ago when he was in the Cavs and Tristan Thompson ran into him and he flopped to the ground and was looking for a call before realizing it was his own team mate. Just fucking play basketball man
"So this has nothing to do with any other player. And like I just said, he can do whatever he wants.  LeBron simply gets too much credit for contending every year. Casuals see the consecutive finals appearances and don't see the price the franchises paid to contend. The Cavaliers post-2018 lost Kyrie, overpaid Tristan Thompson. overpaid Kevin Love and have been awful. LeBron didn't have to deal with any of that. He went to Los Angeles, teamed up with Davis and won another ring.  The Cavaliers are going to be paying for that championship for years going forward.   It's unsustainable to contend. It drains every bit of assets a team has. When it's over, the team is in shambles usually.   LeBron is able to contend so much because he's not responsible for that cost. It's not his problem."
"Lmao that’s almost every superstar . Kd and kawhi have been on the same amount of teams and bron been in the lg longer. He took George hill,jr smith ,bron, klove, Tristan Thompson. If you replaced him with kawhi or kd . I don’t think that team is going to the finals that year ."
Tristan Thompson has really good touch. I’d much rather have him
"he has been bad in detroit cleveland and now la. for 3 years ish, longer actually. it is his player trait. ad played horribly and was the reason laker lost. but dont excuse drummond for fumbling easy layups. tristan thompson made those with lebron on drummond"
He’s in the same pool as Tristan Thompson and Bismack Biyombo as guys who are inexplicably starting over far better players
Ayton at 22 is already having a better career than ADisney. If you put Ayton on the Lakers right now they will be contenders for years to come. ADisney is just a fringe role player who begged daddy Lebron to get him a max contract. Similar to when Lebron got Tristan Thompson a max contract when he was on the Cavs.
Reminds me of Tristan Thompson
Shame he cant do the cavs tristan thompson role efficiently
The average center is someone like RoLo or Tristan Thompson. Len is somewhere in the 40s or 50s.
I’d still take Turner over Grant Williams or Tristan Thompson but I understand your sentiment

"Klay Thompson talent, Tristan Thompson brain."
"Dude, I love Robert Williams, but let's not act like anyone knew he was going to be this good this early on. That being said, i'd sure love to have Myles over Tristan Thompson."
"I was at the game, he is an absolute monster. As a nets fan any time Tristan Thompson was on the court I breathed a sigh of relief."
why doesn't DeAndre Jordan play anymore? it felt like Robert Williams and Tristan Thompson were bullying them inside
"Yeah, but you're playing Tristan Thompson more minutes than him. Those minutes could have been Myles' minutes."
Yeah but you used the savings on Tristan Thompson.
They were abusing Tristan Thompson pretty easily. Robert Williams is 6’8 and can get out and guard guys on the Perimeter ok enough when they switch the PnRs. Embiid and Lopez don’t have the lateral quickness Williams has. They’re slow plodding centers compared to Williams.
"Celtics fans, why does Tristan Thompson start when you have time lord on the bench?"
And yet Tristan Thompson gets more minutes
But Tristan Thompson is literally the NBA version of Tristan Thompson
Tell her the Nets are the nba version of Tristan Thompson cheating on the Kardashian grifter
My girlfriend wants the Nets to win because Tristan Thompson compulsively cheats on Khloe Kardashian. She is super smart and I love her but sometimes she is wrong about what is best for the world. She thinks that turnover was karma.
It's Tristan Thompson that specifically looks incredibly generic.
tristan thompson with the giant flop
Celtics fans: why does Tristan Thompson still get more minutes than Robert Williams? Williams is clearly the better player
Nets getting torched by Tristan Thompson.... what are Giannis and Embiid gonna do 😮
"Yeah, what Harden did when Thompson had position on him had literally nothing to do with KD fouling Tristan.  KD not understanding how to box out is a much larger problem."
PLEASE GET TRISTAN THOMPSON OUT OF THE FUCKING GAME
"Tristan Thompson sounding like my aunt when he said “don’t forget, long shot long rebound”"
Tristan Thompson has a softer voice than you’d think
Tristan Thompson just makes us so much worse as a unit. Why TF is RW now starting these games and halves? He's statistically far superior
How you get blocked by Tristan Thompson? Damn
lmao the only positive for the nets is tristan thompson
Tristan Thompson is gonna be unplayable this series. They’re already going at his ass on every possession
tristan thompson dogshit lmao
It's not cheating. Professional athletes are allowed to cheat on their girlfriends/spouses. It's in the NBA player handbook. Ask Tristan Thompson. He'll show you later.
Kiki Vandeweghe averaged 29ppg one year. He has another two seasons of 26ppg.  Kelly Tripucka averaged 26ppg one year. Jerry Stackhouse averaged 29ppg one year. All of these guys were role players and Kevin is/was too.   &gt;then took a backseat as a 3rd option stretch big so that the team could win lmao  His team was better without him on the floor. His team won the championship by giving his minutes to Tristan Thompson. In another series vs the Pacers he was benched for the team to win. What kind of star player makes his team worse? What star player averages 8ppg to win a finals?
"The thing is that they have so much flexibility on what they want to do.   Their cap situation is good, so they can sign great role players if they want to. They can absorb contracts for even more draft picks (they have about $57m in trade exceptions). They can flip the role players and draft picks for a star some time down the road too.   Let's say Boston wants to get some flexibility for their cap, they could trade Kemba, Tristan Thompson to OKC, throw in a draft pick and get some role players in free agency. OKC could absorb the entirety of the contracts and still be under the cap for free agency.   If OKC wins the lottery and want to win now, they could trade their entire treasure trove of picks and get great role players back. Heck, they could trade half of it and possibly still win the lottery the following year."
"It's pretty ugly.  Of the past 100 top 10 draft picks ( 2009-2019 draftees ), the only 5 to even reach the Finals with their draft team are: Harrison Barnes, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, James Harden, and Stephen Curry. And two of those wouldn't have made it without a certain free-agent acquisition.  So while building a winner high in the draft is a nice idea, its recent track record is bleak, at best.  The preceding decade was just a little better, with 8 out of 100: James, Westbrook, Durant, Bynum, Howard, Wade, Kenyon Martin, and Paul Pierce.  Of those 13 players, only 6 were top 3 picks and just 4 were first overall -- over 20 years."
who? Tristan Thompson?
"It started when Curry couldn't shake Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson. Two bigs he routinely abused anytime they had single coverage on him. It's clear that injury affected his lateral quickness and agility. People always say things like Curry is going to age so well because he doesn't rely on athleticism, they don't realize how much he relies on his quickness and agility. Things like that and stamina will def be affected when a player ages, Steph is one big injury away from looking like JJ Reddick."
"Miami wasn't a trio superteam, more like an legendary duo in Wade+Bron, with Bosh as a 2nd-tier star player that wasn't playing like he did in Toronto.  Cleveland had Kyrie+Bron, and who was the third superstar really? Kevin Love, who didn't really get integrated when sharing minutes with Tristan Thompson? KLove has regressed since his Grizzlies days.  LA had Bron+prime AD, and that was really it as far as star players."
I hope Tristan Thompson has been practicing his mandarin
I pray that the Celtics find somewhere else to send Tristan Thompson this offseason.  He killed the Celtics when he played for the Cavs and now he kills the Celtics while he's playing for the Celtics.  Dude is so good at killing the Celtics you'd think he's Khris Middleton or some shit
"As a Celtics fan, I was reaaaally hoping to target him in a trade this summer. We really need a legit starting big who can keep Timelord healthy.  But it looks like this is out of the question now.  Maybe JJJ will be available tho? Memphis fans, any thoughts on this?   Boston needs a (spot) starting caliber PF and/or C this summer. I want Danny Ainge to target Kai Jones in the draft, buy we need another guy who can immediately step in as a starter or backup.   I've been pining for Val all year, thinking JJJ might be untouchable and Val was the more realistic target. I've also had my eye on SloMo and Justise. I wouldn't be opposed to Clarke or Tillman either.   On our end, we'd probably be offering up a package (pick 2) of: Marcus Smart, Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith, Grant Williams, Tristan Thompson, possibly even Timelord in the right deal. What would it take to make it happen?  JJJ + Kyle or Val + Justise for - Smart + (Romeo/Nesmith/Grant/TT) and 2 FRP's sound fair?"
"He also said ""Horford with the rebound"" instead of Tristan Thompson. Horford hasn't played for the Celtics for like three years..."

"TBH I wouldn't want to double Tatum what with all that premium offensive talent out there on the floor with him.

Or leave the Jokic-esque Tristan Thompson open so you can send a help defender at the guy who's dropping 50?  That seems like a losing strategy..."
"There a lot you can hold Brad accountable for this year, trying to play Daniel Theis and Tristan Thompson together is one of them. We even played a game against LAC and started Theis, TT AND Grant Williams LOL   But his star player catching Covid and missing 3 weeks, his star PG having to be heavily managed  cause of his knee and other injuries, his team captain missing time after his calf exploded, his second best player playing through knee tendinitis, a torn ligament in his wrist and being generally banged up, the big veteran center catching Covid and missing 3 weeks, his best center not being able to stay on the court, the guy they traded for to come save the bench catching Covid and not having actual NBA players on his bench from 10-15, is not Brad Stevens fault."
Somehow I didn't know the Celtics had Tristan Thompson and Jabari Parker lol
Because Tristan Thompson said he came here for the playoffs. Whole different beast now
The Celtics' defense puts the clamps on the Wizards.  Tatum just pick apart Wizards' defense(?).  Sucks that Hachimura is on foul trouble and Bertans just seems to be unplayable at times.  Also did I see a glimpse of 2016 Tristan Thompson out there? My guy just a hand on every rebound today.
I think the refs are using Tristan Thompson to make up calling so many fouls in favor of Tatum   That man is getting wrecked and no calls at all 😂
The Celtics having success using pick and rolls with Tristan Thompson... Everything is going wrong for Wizards this game
tristan thompson shows why he got paid. hes a playoff guy.
Tristan Thompson.
Which Morris twin is going to play Tristan Thompson in the LeBron bio pic?
Brain fart by Tristan Thompson   Westbrook was way off lol
Tristan Thompson looks like Winnie the Pooh
Bro I hate Tristan Thompson I want his citizenship revoked
Keeping Tristan Thompson and dumping Theis will always baffle me
How on Earth did Lebron get Tristan Thompson a championship. Dude could be so good but is soooo bad
Imagine getting pushed out of the way by Tristan Thompson
tristan thompson sucks
"I mean no first of all, Fournier and smart shoot like 2% from 3 every post season and seem to make alot of questionable decision on offense in general. Kemba is really good but it's a question of if he'll be at 100% or not, I know he looked really bad at the start of the season, although idk how he's been looking recently    Thats not even the issue though, the issue is they have nobody to guard what likely would have been the reigning MVP if he hadn't gotten injured, especially now that Theis is gone   If Tristan Thompson is your Embiid answer its not looking good   At least that my understanding of it, celtics fans feel free to correct me if I'm off 🤷‍♀️"
"So let me get this straight, Schroeder was literally a negative asset 2 years ago when he was making $15M a year with only 2 years left on his contract as the top option for the Hawks. Then he had a nice season as a SIXTH MAN for OKC and now gets to play alongside Lebron/AD on a team that won a championship.   Now all of a sudden he will be a positive asset making nearly $100M over 4 years for a team that lacks shooting and playmaking when he’s a below average shooter and playmaker and already has a good slashing guard in Rose (who makes $8M currently)?   Yeah...I call cap. Maybe Crabbe isn’t the ideal comparison, maybe it’s more like Tristan Thompson who got overpaid by the Cavs to keep Lebron happy. The leverage he has here is that the Lakers lose that cap space if they don’t retain him, not that he has some proven track record of being the lead floor general."
"Rudy also plays five minutes less a game, which kinda blows that pace argument out of the water. The per36 and per100 stats are both even more biased in Rudy's favor.  The counting stats are no comparison, the advanced stats are no comparison, the eye test is no comparison. What even is the point you're trying to make? Do you think Gobert would be a better player if he took a bunch more bad shots? Rudy is just plain better than Noah was. Noah was a much better passer and had a more rounded offensive game, but his offensive game just wasn't very good. His production was on par with Taj Gibson and Tristan Thompson even in his best year. His passing was good, but great and definitely not anywhere near good enough to make the difference on offense comparable to the difference on defense."
"People had to know that eventually this dude was going to come around and be a pretty damn good basketball player. Being so highly recruited and such a high pick and with so much pressure on him to play well may have gotten to him a little but being on a team where the pressure is off of him and steph and draymond handle it he seems to be playing more free and relaxed. This dude is a great ball player and I think now that he's come around and his confidence is up that he'll consistently produce numbers like he is for years to come.  On another note, this has nothing to do with this post, I would also like to say if Tristan Thompson can be playing Center for the Celtics why has no one really given Jahlil Okafor a true shot at Center. I know he's not a high flyer and he's not an exciting player but I think in his rookie season he averaged like 17ppg or something like that. Someone could've molded that guy to be a productive player and maybe even a really good center, he has great scoring ability around the basket and I know this bcuz I'm a die hard Pelicans fan and he impressed me with his play when he got a lot of mins. C'mon NBA GMs give that man a serious chance, he was great at Duke and I think the Celtics could even use a guy like that who can score around the rim and rebound and win 1 on 1 battles down low when they send double teams to tatum or brown. All I'm saying is there's got to be room for a guy with that kind of low post scoring talent to get 20+ mins a game somewhere. Just an example look at Fultz in Orlando, he's completely redefined himself and has really turned into more of the player that everyone expected to be a top pick."
Tristan Thompson punching air rn
"Yeah those three years in Cleveland with Dion Waiters,  Tristan Thompson, and Anthony Bennett really help his average…"
"Pretty obvious shit. ""Hey make Tristan Thompson shoot instead of Tatum"" is almost a comical level of insight"
"Are we talking the current roster, beginning of the season, or including LeBron’s effect on recruiting?  If the former, I think Jarrett Allen and Kevin Love is one of the weaker posts in the league and while SexLand is arguably a top 5 backcourt, I still think we are out in the semis  With Andre Drummond, Javale McGee, and a somewhat healthy Love, we can make some noise. We also have Okoro and Kevin Porter Jr leading the second unit. With locked-in, pissed off, shaved head LeBron we make a proper run at the chip and with LeBron no longer on the Lakers, whoever wins the East wins the league  The third one is real tricky because the butterfly flaps her wings, LeBron stays in Cleveland committing long-term to the team following Kyrie’s exit (or maybe sooner and we avoid that fiasco altogether but we will just take it back to 2019. The Cavs trade Love and maybe a couple other players for Paul George or Kawhi Leonard and LeBron’s people start working on AD. Meanwhile Chris Paul decides he wants out of LA’s other team and joins longtime friend LeBron to either run the Cavs offense or mentor Colin Sexton. LeBron, CP, Kawhi or PG, Jordan Clarkson, and Tristan Thompson beat the walking wounded warriors and have the same draft spot as we did when we drafted Kevin Porter Jr. Lets say a trade for AD doesn’t pan out, we still end up attracting someone in the Marc Gasol, Boogie Cousins, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond, Dwight Howard range. Now we enter the 2020 season with Chris Paul, Kawhi or PG, LeBron, Tristan and an unknown veteran C/PF with an absolute bench MOB of Colin Sexton, Jordan Clarkson, Kevin Porter Jr, Larry Nance Jr, Matthew Dellavedova, and Ante Zizic (who properly develops in this timeline and might actually start)"
"As a Celtics fan, I agree with this analysis of Tristan Thompson"
I don’t think anyone spends any time “preparing” for Tristan Thompson at this point in his career.
"Celtics are playing without Kemba, Jayson Tatum, Jalen Brown, Smart, Tristan Thompson, Robert Williams and Fournier. I'm not sure if those Celtics are going to be fun to watch."
Yes. The Cavs actually had a better offense than the warriors believe it or not. If they had ben wallace anchoring their defense instead of freakin tristan thompson they would win in 7 imo.
"Tristan Thompson played 54 games, Marcus smart played a few less at 48 and kemba played 43 and you guys acquired players like Evan Fournier who have been healthy for the most part since you’ve got him but won’t show up in that stat at all. Yes you guys missed a few good players for a dozen or two games but most teams can say the same this season. I don’t think it’s fair to say you had as bad or even worse talent, even with the injures than a team tied for the 12th seed in the west. I think it’s fair to say you guys just underperformed, but it’s not the talent."
"Brown is far better than Ingram. Kemba still played 43 games this year, only 12 less than lonzo so that’s not a fair argument, and even hurt he’s far better and than lonzo. Celtics also have Tristan Thompson, Marcus smart, and Evan Fournier. I would argue that each team has comparable first options but the Celtics have a better 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th options. Yeah the Celtics have been injured a decent amount which is unfortunate but they do not have comparable talents whatsoever"
"Who were his best teammates? KLove? Tristan Thompson? Kyle Korver and JR Smith?   It was so bad that the ESPN graphic that showed each teams 3 best players as a promo for game 1, included Steph, Klay, and KD on the warriors, and LeBron, George Hill, and Kyle Korver for the Cavs."
"Fournier was a good pick up. I still think they gotta invest in a borderline elite playmaker either through free agency or the draft. Tristan Thompson was a good pick up too, and Robert Williams could become something special. They need more bench depth behind smart and Fournier."
I honestly can't believe how many random stats I end up coming across with Tristan Thompson at the bottom. Although I'm not surprised on this one (besides the fact that he has this many possessions).
"Wouldn’t even be the first to change his shooting hand, pretty sure Tristan Thompson came up as a lefty.  I do everything right-handed but a few years back when I couldn’t get anymore progress as a righty jump shooter I switched to lefty and I’ve never looked back. It’s just more comfortable and feels natural for whatever reason."
"I'm not sure if there's any one common denominator. Maybe injury forced you to switch from your dominant hand and it just stuck, maybe you were just more comfortable with your off hand, maybe someone growing up made you play that way. Idk which one fits Simmons because I'm pretty sure he does everything besides actually shooting with his right hand. Some players can make their non dominant hand work like bron. Some can't and change it up like Tristan Thompson as somebody else mentioned. And some just suffer for whatever reason like Ben"
Players with a better DFG% at the rim than the 61.8% Adams had:   * Wiseman * Drummond * KAT * Mo Bamba * Montrezl * Sabonis * Tristan Thompson * DeAndre Jordan * Olynyk * Baynes * Markkanen * Boucher
I really think he should switch his shooting hand ala Tristan Thompson
"His losses with Atlanta, at least to the Cavs were a horrible match up not just because of LBJ but tristan Thompson too. Tristan absolutely Punnked them on the offensive glass one year in a ugly shooting series for both teams IIRC and then love and Tristan did more of the same the next year"
"May have been heresy or just folk joking but I was under the impression, ala Tristan Thompson, that he doesn't shoot with his dominant hand because he believes he's ambidextrous.   Almost certain early on, rookie year I believe, there was a pretty noticeable increase in fg% from his 3 ft ""floaters"" or layups when releasing with his right hand, yet he still shoots left.  I don't understand why the drummonds, dwights, or even the capelas of the world aren't forced to granny that shit, or why more don't just do it out of desire to improve.."
"Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Okafor, Hernangomez, simonovic"
"So you think Tristan Thompson is worth $9,720,900 for this year? And I'm the dumb one. LOL."
"Lol   Also I forgot to add that you’re wrong about Tristan Thompson too. We didn’t overpay him, we just took on the second year of the contract Boston gave him in exchange for Delon Wright.   Anyway, stay dumb."
"Except it is exactly the same just shifted from failing to build around Cousins to failing to build around Fox. 3-4 key young players that have no other talent around them and a terrible coaching staff and an incompetent front office that has done such an awful job that no one in the NBA wants to play for SAC.  Front office just continually either overpays for completely washed (Hassan Whiteside last year, Tristan Thompson this year) big men or takes huge risks on drafting injury prone (Harry Giles, Marvin Bagley III) big men, or pays average role players as if they're stars (Harrison Barnes).   The argument could be made that they aren't focused on big men and are trying to emulate the small ball movement but that doesn't hold either cuz the small ball movement is predicated on good 3pt shooting and players that can defend multiple positions and Buddy Hield is the only good 3pt shooter on the roster and they don't have anyone that can guard more than 2 positions.   Throw in a coaching staff that doesn't even understand what defense is and has to bank on an undersized rookie PG to bail them out with his 1 on 1 ability and it will be another long wait for relevancy."
"Tristan Thompson kept beating him up and specifically targeting his back area, kinda a dick move"
tristan thompson purposefully injured him on the play before by backing into this landing space. that dude is so obnoxious
"I believe it when I saw Curry struggling to shake Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson. He was still effective when his shot was on, but when he was missing threes, he could not beat players off the dribble. His agility and shiftiness is a major part in his game."
Kemba barely played the last two seasons Tristan Thompson was horrible and Fournier wasn't as good as they expected on the celtics
"Lol you and I have very different ideas of a good offseason  Kemba, Tristan Thompson, and Evan Fournier &gt; al horford, Kanter, and Schroder seems like a lateral move at best to me"
"Smart. And that's just objectively fucking false. Schroder and Richardson may be inconsistent, but who was our best player off the bench last year? Payton Pritchard, who's still on the squad and a year older? *Tristan Thompson?* We had damn near the worst bench in the league last year."
"&gt;Giannis needs ONE specific style of teammates around him because of his unique skillset. In comparison to Lebron, there is no one specific style of player or play that is required.  No, there is. He wants offball 3nD. This has been proven over and over. Giannis doesn't NEED spacing, like Lebron doesn't NEED non ball dominant players, but both REALLY want it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Maybe you want to check the usage rates of Wade, Kyrie, Davis, Westbrook if you think Lebron hasn't played with ball dominant players. 3&amp;D? That's what Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Chris Anderson, Javale Mcgee, Deandre Jordan, Anderson Varejao, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Daniel Gibson, Mo Williams, Drew Gooden, Dwight Howard, Russell Westbrook, and Anthony Davis are all about! /s  You wrote /s but this actually sounds like an argument, so I'm not sure whether to reply or not. Eh, whatever. Take care."
We gonna get Ben Simmons for a 3 week vacation in Ohio + a signed Iman Shumpert jersey and the rights to draft Tristan thompson son in 2036.
"Last year’s team had absolutely no one who could create their own shot off the bench. I cannot stress how much of an upgrade Schroder and even Richardson are (last game notwithstanding). Plus Rob and Horford have both been fantastic, whereas last year we played a bunch of games with *Tristan Thompson* starting at C. The main issue so far has been inconsistency on both ends, which isn’t *new* but also isn’t surprising from a team with a new head coach playing a new system— the individual talent has clearly improved up and down the roster. I’m not gonna panic over a 2-3 record, they’ll pick it up."
"I mean he made Tristan Thompson look like a finals level big and Kevin Love like a star. AD went from all star talent to consensus superstar after joining the Lakers. Kyrie went from a regular first round exit to champion co captain with Lebron to terrible locker room guy after. He got JR Smith multiple rings, you can only do so much for the backup at your own position."
Our ass game has been non-existent since the departure of Tristan Thompson.
Or Tristan Thompson. At least that guy can rebound.
Pining for Tristan Thompson.
"I think you're overrating how much 9 a season is... Even if you don't think Caruso is very good, he's still probably worth 9  Tristan Thompson, Jeremy Lamb, Maxi Kleber, Rodney Hood. I clicked through a bunch of teams rosters and excluding rookie deals these are the guys making 9-10 million. 9 million is not every day starter money"
Kings dumb af. Neemias Queta &gt; Alex Len and Tristan Thompson
"Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, Kyle Kuzma, Dennis Schoeder, and a Nets first round pick."
Cavs let Tristan Thompson and Javale Launch   i bet Allen shoots 85 3’s just next year
"This is a bunch of bullshit.  When bron left for Miami, cavs had 3 #1 picks in 4 years. This kind of luck is historical in literally all of sports.  So it’s not like they have up future assets for him. They just wasted them on bums like Anthony  Bennett. And while Kyrie was a great player him alone is not enough to get you to the playoffs so they did absolutely nothing to try.  In fact, the year Lebron left cavs had 2  picks in the top 5. They drafted Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson.  I’m the end, bron had to return to save them.  Don’t give me all that BS about bron making you lose your future to win rings now. They had plenty of chances to make a good team after bron left the first time."
"If you search ""hardwood houdini curry"" on google and click the link under Top Stories, you can still get it.  Here's the text   ``` Boston Celtics: How recent moves point to Cs signing Stephen Curry  After a quiet draft, the Boston Celtics had one of their most active offseason days in a long time, acquiring Josh Richardson, Kris Dunn, Bruno Fernando, and a second-round pick for Tristan Thompson and their remaining Gordon Hayward Traded Player Exception.  The two deals signaled two things — Brad intends to keep the Boston Celtics competitive with a good defense but is also looking towards next summer when the Cs can create a max slot if they move some money around.  Bradley Beal looks likely to be staying another year with the Washington Wizards despite them trading his co-star, Russell Westbrook, and the team headed towards a struggle to make the play-in.  One could logically assume Beal is out of his mind to waste another year of his career confined in Washington D.C., but some things on the outside are controlling his decision-making.  Jayson Tatum, a long-time friend of Beal’s, must have convinced him to stay during his days of contemplating putting in a trade request.  Boston was not going to trade Jaylen Brown for Bradley Beal, so the two St. Louis natives needed to work out a way to play together while not requiring the front office to give up its young star.  The 28-year-old scoring superstar has a player option in the summer of 2022, which he will likely opt-out of to enter free agency as the Wizards embrace a rebuild.  The market for Beal will be a competitive one, but the Boston Celtics have stacked the deck to their favor with just one card: Jayson Tatum.  The two’s friendship has been well-documented, and their dream of playing together has been well known. Next summer, they can make their dream come true, and all of Boston has to do is move some money around to create a $34.1 million max slot.  That’s why Brad Stevens is taking on many expiring deals to make creating that max slot even easier.  The other target the Boston Celtics should prioritize is Stephen Curry.  The all-time great point guard and best shooter in league history looks to be on track to forgo an extension with Golden State and find a new club to support his talents.  Although the Warriors have a fantastic track record of building highly efficient and talented teams, their management has struggled to put a team like that around Steph Curry since the departure of Kevin Durant.  Part of this struggle can be placed on bad luck, like Klay Thompson’s injury scaring away potential free agents, but for the most part, Golden State has failed to be aggressive and make moves to win now.  Their draft speaks to that, utilizing both of their lottery picks instead of trading them for some experienced help and using their highest pick on the biggest project in the draft, Jonathan Kaminga.  There’s still time for the Warriors to make moves in free agency and trade for some veteran support, but nothing Golden State has done in the past year indicates they’ll do that, which could lead to Curry leaving and the franchise having to embrace a rebuild.  The Boston Celtics are arguably the best suitor in the league for Steph Curry.  They have two young but postseason experienced stars with a solid defense in place and a front office that’s intent on winning soon.  Steph Curry’s fit next to the Jays should not have to be explained, but to give you a quick idea of what he’ll provide, the Boston Celtics will have the best spacing possibly in league history.  They’ll have the best offense in league with a top 10 defense, which will directly equate to high-level playoff success.  If the Boston Celtics have any chance at Stephen Curry next summer, they need to take a swing.  ```"
They should probably trade Draymond Green for Tristan Thompson too.
"I think you’ll re-sign him too, but it is probably going to be an overpay. It would be malpractice by Caruso’s agent to not push for as big of a contract as possible. He’s not a ring chasing vet that made a bunch of money before he came to LA. He’s a young guy that’s been paid comparatively little.   It’s basically the same situation that Tristan Thompson-esque deal. Right now he’s just got to scare the Lakers enough that they’ll give him an above market deal."
We traded Tristan Thompson for him
do you say Halliburton to Boston for Tristan Thompson and Romeo Langford?
"They caught Tristan Thompson, the stray version of an NBA player"
lmfao imagine a tristan thompson for kris dunn trade escalates into a fox for jaylen trade
"Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith, and a bought-out Kevin Love joining them, with Chris Bosh being hired as a player development consultant, and Channing Frye/Richard Jefferson taking over as exclusive commentators for every game they play."
"&gt;How this will change the terms of the deal is unknown. Boston can fit the 2021-22 salaries of both Kris Dunn and Bruno Fernando into the Kemba Walker TPE. That would create a $9.7M TPE for Tristan Thompson.  &gt;All three teams have engaged on expanding the deal too. Now, it's TBD!  [follow up](https://twitter.com/KeithSmithNBA/status/1422046080510930944)"
"Calling Durant's team a super-super team while Cavs had lebron Kyrie love Deron Korver smoy jr Smith and Tristan ""modern day rodman"" thompson. You got it twisted op the team KD smoked in the finals was the super-super team when it quite literally had 5 allstars and a smoy."
Hawks legend Tristan Thompson
"Yeah, people really like shitting on him, but he was a decent player - Just never should've been close to the second best player on a good team, but he was with LeBron in Cleveland at one point.   He was probably about the same level as Tristan Thompson."
"Yeah, as u/stealthanus said, I'm agreeing with you and contrasting it to Plumlee or Favors or Adams or Tristan Thompson (who somehow still retained value above that of the others...why? He blows.) who all were signed less than a year ago to new contracts, all of which I thought were stupid at the time, and now none of them are on the teams that signed them.  Unless they're really above average on one end or the other, centers are not worth investing in."
"Tatum bro the tall guy you are playing with is KD,not Tristan Thompson,you can pass it to him."
i dont thinks there is any chance of a 3way anymore. Both kuz and harrell posted about wizards on IG and kings traded for tristan thompson after not getting harrell
"Many centers nowadays aren't very skilled post players or even skilled scorers in general. Guys like Dwight Howard, Steven Adams, and Tristan Thompson aren't gonna back down OG or Siakam and score. Both of those guys are strong enough to hold their own if a bigger guy tries to back them down and many centers aren't skilled enough to finish over them.  Guys who would give Siakam and OG trouble at the 5 spot are big, skilled post players like Embiid, Jokic, Vucevic , and Valanciunas. So really, it depends on the matchup. If the 5 is just a rim runner and bad post player, Siakam and OG can defend them. If the 5 is someone who's bigger and stronger on top of being a skilled post player, Siakam and OG will have trouble."
TIL Tristan Thompson is still in the NBA
Tristan Thompson.. get out.
They already have a better Tristan Thompson in Clint capella already
Hawks Legend Tristan Thompson
tristan thompson
Goodbye Hawks legend Tristan Thompson. Truly an integral part of Atlanta’s history.
*closes Tristan Thompson highlight video*
Rip ATL Tristan Thompson 7/30/21- 7/30/21
lol if they trade Hield for Tristan Thompson
"""Everything I've learned about Tristan Thompson I've learned against my will."" - somebody on twitter"
"The Celtics are trading Tristan Thompson to Atlanta for Kris Dunn, and a 2023 second-round pick, sources tell ESPN."
Positive value for Tristan Thompson is weird.  But if Kris Dunn ends up starting at PG lmao
"So was JR Smith, yet he never gets an automatic ""good guy"" label. Nor does Tristan Thompson."
"Lol what revisionist history - the same kyrie who led the cavs to a piping hot 35 win season the year before? And who else was on that team? Because once kyrie and love went down werent Knicks legends JR Smith and Shumpart, along with delladova ans tristan thompson all starters/top rotation??? Big 3 yes-superTEAM (and emphasis onTEAM) absolutely not"

We have 3 starting caliber bigs tf?  Not only do we have who I believe when healthy is a top 10 big in Robert Williams but we have Al Horford and Tristan Thompson. If anything we need to trade a big for a PG.
"Haha so you're gonna use last year as hard evidence that the Jays need Bradley Beal? Most games missed due to injuries and covid, with 50% of Kemba Walker as our starting Point Guard? Maybe if we didn't have to play Grant Williams and Semi Ojeleye for 20 MPG, and start Tristan Thompson for 43 games, things would have been different. Our best 5 barely played together last year. If you think the Celtics were a Bradley Beal away from not being a .500 team then I don't know what you were watching."
"you mean you're not excited about expiring Marcus Smart who may or may not be plateauing/declining athletically and chubby Tristan Thompson as a return for the franchise's greatest player?  I am shocked, positively shocked to hear this."
"&gt;The Cavs actually go to the finals and even won one with the strategy of tanking——&gt;getting top lottery pick——&gt; builds a contender.  But during LeBron's first tenure there, did they accomplish anything the mediocre Pacers haven't done?  Then after drafting Kyrie, they were terrible despite having four picks in the top four over those three years prior to LeBron's return. So wouldn't it be fair to say the Cavs won the title because LeBron, the best player in the game, came back as a free agent rather than them doing it through the draft?  Without signing LeBron, the core group would be something like Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, and Wiggins. I wouldn't exactly classify that core as a team on the cusp of a championship."
Do you think the Celtics want to trade Tristan Thompson?
"I think the Celtics will end up dumping Tristan Thompson or Carsen Edwards, picking no one."
Also Tristan Thompson has been to multiple NBA finals while Giannis's bum ass has only been to 1.
I see no flaws in this logic. My guess is Tristan Thompson and our second this year for Luka Doncic and this years and next years first from the Mavericks.    Who says no?
"Gonna have to sweeten the pot, Tristan Thompson was the 4th overall pick and Giannis was only 15th"
The Celtics hope to trade Tristan Thompson tonight. The asking price seems to be Luka Doncic. Let's see how things work out for them.
"Well, yeah its just an observation on my part. But I'm talking beyond this particular story around Beal. KOC starts a lot of his podcasts with something along the lines of ""My sources say..."" or ""The rumor around the league is...""  And again, he's rarely right about any of it. It's landed him in some hot waters before too with front offices and players (Celtics, Tristan Thompson, etc).  The problem I have (not just with KOC but sports journalism in general) is that theres absolutely 0 repercussion to dragging false narratives. Literally theres no way of proving any of it is right or wrong. You can just shoot from the hip and if you get it right, great, if not, then whatever.  And I'm saying KOC is a smart guy and I really enjoy listening to him... I'm just not too fond of the fact that he's chosen this as a lane that he's obviously leaned very heavily into in recent months."
Tristan fucking Thompson outplayed Kevin Love in 2016 finals lmao
See the dude above you’s post on the last 10 number 4 picks. The median player is Tristan Thompson and Ben is better than all of them. Fans overvalue picks big time. The last 3 champs + the suns gave up all their assets and won a chip
"I don't think IT would've been maxed regardless bec of a horrendous 2018 season, but he would've definitely gotten a fairly large contract probably in the Tristan Thompson realm"
tristan thompson is actually a great dark horse candidate for one of the most handsome nba dudes
"Tristan Thompson is easily more handsome than Jaylen Brown, what is this nonsense."
Im sorry i never saw this post but i am extremely curious if you have the differing numbers between when Tatum ran PNR with Tristan Thompson V.S. Rob Williams. TT seems like a horrible PNR Big Man to me at this point in his career and i would assume Tatum's Numbers running it with Rob were probably way better.
parlayed lebron into a long career  really he's no different than tristan thompson. not a player but still made a lot of money despite being trash at his job
"I noticed this in the Summer League games at Chino, etc. When some guys are just allowed to play off their intuition I saw a big improvement.   I saw one game where Tristan Thompson was like Draymond making plays and anticipating everything. It was surprising.  JR Smith has so much of a game when he's not playing spotup, too."
"Are you serious? What's the point of having a player that is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league, can push the pace and get his teammates involved? The fit with Embiid isn't perfect but we've seen glimpses of Ben by himself that prove he is still a ridiculous talent.  This is a history of the number 4 pick in the draft. You want to roll the dice at this spot over getting a proven guy like Ben Simmons? Yes he has weaknesses in his game but to say he's worth less than the 4th pick is an insane take.  2020 Patrick Williams - Chicago Bulls  2019 De’Andre Hunter – Atlanta Hawks  2018 Jaren Jackson Jr., Michigan State – Memphis Grizzlies  2017 Josh Jackson, Kansas – Phoenix Suns  2016 Dragan Bender, Israel – Phoenix Suns  2015 Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesta Sevilla – New York Knicks  2014 Aaron Gordon, Arizona – Orlando Magic  2013 Cody Zeller, Indiana – Charlotte Bobcats  2012 Dion Waiters, Syracuse – Cleveland Cavaliers  2011 Tristan Thompson, Texas – Cleveland Cavaliers  2010 Wesley Johnson, Syracuse – Minnesota Timberwolves"
"Plus people are forgetting the LA/NY factor.  Players who play in these big markets or with LeBron have an inflated value when they are up for a trade or due for a new deal - look at the deals Mozgov, Tristan Thompson, Delladova received for example.  After a year playing next to LeBron in LA, Hield's trade value will be much greater."
Tristan Horton-Thompson
"Yeah, but the Lakers are also gonna take a shot because they can't bring in anyone else. They are already capped. It's Schröder or no one.   Schröder knows this and that's exactly the reason why he is demanding that amount of money. He won't come close to it on any other team. It's exactly how Tristan Thompson got paid by the Cavs and it will happen again."
"We don't have to give up either.  Time Lord, Langford, Nesmith and Tristan Thompson is enough salary (with of course a presti amount of picks)."
"I didn't imply they'd always be busts. I said they're likely to be little more than rotational players.   I don't think it's unreasonable to say development is a thing. I think it's unreasonable to assume he shits out all-starts after his morning cereal while the rest of the league doesn't know what they were doing.   Regarding the quote you gave from me, GMs wouldn't laugh at me because they'd look at the list and see that the last decade of number four picks is littered with duds, rotational players, and 1-2 players still holding on to some potential.   Simmons for a squad headlined by a washed Porzingis, Dragan Bender and Tristan Thompson. Right. Sounds about like something I'd read on this sub. Let me see if I can eat some of those turds Masai is pumping out. Have a good one."
2020 - Patrick Williams - Bulls   2019 De’Andre Hunter – Hawks   2018 Jaren Jackson Jr - Grizzlies   2017 Josh Jackson  – Suns   2016 Dragan Bender - Suns   2015 Kristaps Porzingis - Knicks   2014 Aaron Gordon  – Magic   2013 Cody Zeller - Bobcats   2012 Dion Waiters - Cavaliers   2011 Tristan Thompson - Cavaliers   2010 Wesley Johnson - Timberwolves   I wouldn’t trade Ben for a decade of number four picks now that the unicorn has vanished.
"From 2010-2019, the number 4 picks have been deandre hunter, jaren Jackson, josh Jackson, dragan bender, KP, Aaron Gordon, Cody zeller, dion waiters, Tristan Thompson, and Wesley Johnson. How many all star appearances do those guys have between them, 1 (KP in 2018)? The draft is a massive crapshoot, prob bigger than people think Edit: JJJ and hunter are obviously good young players, but the median player in that list is probably Tristan Thompson"
"Caruso was drafted by LA and he was big contributor  I think Cavs was somewhat organic. Kyrie was drafted, tristan thompson, lebrin etc."
Varejeo was an actual problem. Delly was just an annoying wombat. Prime Varejeo could have easily replaced Tristan Thompson on the 2016 team and won a title.
May I interest you in a lightly used Tristan Thompson? He can teach Simmons how to switch his shooting hand
"1. 2012 - AD and D-Lil almost do it alone. But just counting the guys listed there are 22 Allstar Appearances, 5 Rings, 1 DPOY award, amongst other thigns 2. 2018 - This is early but Luka and Trae are clearly two of the stars of the future, and to some degree the present. SGA and Ayton are also only scratching the surface.  3. 2014- Probably the two best centers in the league (And top the MVP finishers this year), a Breakout candidate in Randle and two solid if underrated guys in Gordan and Lavine. This was a deep draft that also had Marcus Smart, Capela, Boddanovic, Joe (And Gary!) Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic 4. 2011 - This class has accomplished a lot. Klay is one of the best shooters ever. Kawhi is the part-robot to dominate the league. This class is full of dudes who have aged out a little (it was 10 years ago), but Kanter, Tristan Thompson, Valanciunas and Iman Shumpert help teams. Tobias Harris still solid.  5. 1. 2019 - Another young but already great class. Zion and Ja bring the average up, but besides hunter and Herro already showing their value in the league, this class also has guys like RJ Barrett, Brandon Clarke, Darius Garland and Nikiel Alexander-Walker. This class may rise as years go on 6. 2016 - This one should probably be higher, but hey, im lazy and ive already moved thigns around. Simmons gets a lot of hate, but he is a good shooting coach away from being incredible. BI continues to improve each year. As does Jaylen Brown. Not to mention Jamal Murray, Malik Beasley and Caris Levert 7. 2017 - Tatum is elite. Mitchell is on his way there. people overlook Fox because he plays for the Kings, but he is still very good. And Bam is definitely in the top centers in the league. I still belive in Lonzo Ball. Is he Jason Kidd? No. Obviously. But he might be Rondo with a shot, and that is pretty special too (Cue my whole take being thrown out for Lonzo praise) Also John Collins 8. 2015 - This class is top heavy. But its a good top. Injuries and poor team management has hurt the careers of KAT, D-Russ, and Porzingas, but they are all incredibly talented and still dont reach the gym of this class in Devin Booker. The best guy in this class not named is probably Bobby Portis. So yea 9. 2013 - Giannis alone should probably raise this. But this class was rough. ANthony Bennett, Cody Zeller, and Alex Len in the top 5. Yuck. That said Rudy is also special. This class had plenty of guys good enough to be the 3rd best player on a contender. And plenty youve never heard of 10. 2020 - This class is hurt by small sample size. Lamelo and Ant def seem like they could be great. Few other guys are solid. This class will likely rise, but until I see more theyll need to earn it"
There were definitely some centers in this draft:  1.	Jonas Valanciunas 2.	Tristan Thompson 3.	Enes Kanter 4.	Nikola Vucevic
"Kyrie would be looked at differently for asking for a trade from a roster of Tristan Thompson, Anthony Bennett and Dion Waiters than Lebron and Klove."
"it's certainly much closer to a truly contending roster for the Blazers, but a tough fit for the Pacers if they're signing up for CJ &amp; LeVert together.  My other thought would be a CJ for Gordon Hayward swap, especially if the Blazers are bringing back Powell.  I think they also need to do something about their center rotation, they need a versatile/switchable big behind Nurkic for certain match-ups and to give them a different dimension.  Tristan Thompson is pretty washed, but maybe he'd be the kind of option they could use to pair with Nurkic &amp; give them a better option against smaller teams..."
Ayton and Jae Crowder compared to Richard Jefferson and banged up Tristan Thompson come on now lolol
"Lakers: Lonzo, Ingram, Hart, DLO, Randle, Clarkson, Zubac  Cavs: Lebron, Kyrie, Wiggins, Tristan Thompson, Sexton, KPJ, Garland"
"&gt; Tristan Thompson, Delly ~~Lebron~~ Richard Jefferson   LMAO"
"2016 cavs had Kevin love,Kyrie,Tristan Thompson, Delly Lebron Richard Jefferson bruh I can keep goin. Get some rest"
Jrue was terrible. JR was better. Tristan Thompson also averaged a double double that series.
"Cavs picked Kyrie and Tristan Thompson with #1 and #4 in 2011. Not sure how we're defining ""did well,"" but they were both contributors on the 2016 championship team."
"you could join Celtics Nation, we got 17 rings but that's the past and also people get mad when I bring that up since they were won back in the day but anyway  currently we have one of the best young duos in the NBA, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both 25+ PPG scorers with multiple playoff series wins under their belts. As well as these guys, you'll surely love rooting for   Marcus Smart, the heart &amp; Soul of the team who wears his heart on his sleeve and dives for every loose ball.   Al Horford, our steady veteran presence.   Payton Pritchard &amp; Aaron Nesmith, our two terrific sophomore players who can shoot the lights out and make tons of hustle plays    Rob ""Timelord"" Williams, he does cool dunks and blocks and it's awesome  Tacko Fall, he's 7'5 lol(or 228.6 cm)  as well as many other players such as Romeo Langford, Evan Fournier, Carsen Edwards, Grant Williams, Jesusemilore ""Semi"" Talibejesu Ojeleye, Tristan Thompson, Moses Brown, and so many more.   We also have fans who are super passionate about the game and even once cheered ""Let's Go Celtics!"" for 5 minutes even though we were down by 20 in a playoff game, because that is Celtic Pride.   I can fill you in more on the lore of the team if you want, there's a lot though, we're a very historic franchise"
"Gee I wonder who’s gonna be more successful the fella playing with:  Loul Deng, Dion Waters, Spencer Hawes, Tristan Thompson  Or the fella playing with:  Clint Capela, Deandre Hunter, John Collins, Bogdan, Huerter  Almost like the one with better players around them had more success 🤔🧐"
Kyrie was a child tho. We expect a 19-21 year old Kyrie to win with a 20 year old Dion Waiters and Tristan Thompson?
Korver=Klay  KD=Tristan Thompson because both went to Texas
"Not sure about the dating timelines, but both Lamar Odom and Tristan Thompson have at one point won championships and dated I think the same Kardashian."
"My mom probably only know Lebron, Durant, Curry, Tristan Thompson and of course Kawhi."
"If you look VERYYYYY closely, the players are in the image from Sekouuuuuuuuus poster on Tristan Thompson"
"Iggy injured. Bogut injured, which no one ever talks about. Gave Kyrie and Lebron room to penetrate at will. Curry also not himself. Struggled to beat Tristan Thompson and Love off the dribble."
"Maybe, but my girlfriend who knows nothing about bball knows who Tristan thompson is but theres 0 chance she knows who luka is"
Honestly might be tristan thompson
