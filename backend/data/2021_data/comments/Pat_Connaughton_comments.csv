"They have changed their offensive scheme and are trying to find the sweet spot:  &gt; With a different base scheme that puts a greater focus on offensive rebounding, Milwaukee is still excelling. And yet, Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA’s back-to-back most valuable player, is posting his worst numbers of the last three seasons. &gt;  &gt; Antetokounmpo is averaging 27 points, 10.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game with an effective field goal percentage of 58.4 percent this season, which are still quite good. But those statistics are all lower than in his first two seasons with Budenholzer. On top of that, Antetokounmpo isn’t feeling as comfortable as he did in the team’s previous offensive scheme. &gt;  &gt; “It’s weird, it’s weird, but as I said, I’m figuring it out,” Antetokounmpo said. “I’d love to come out and have 30, 35 and it be easy. Easy layups and dunks and all that. But having somebody in ‘the dunker’ might make it a little bit harder. &gt;  &gt; “But at the end of the day, you gotta do other things to impact the game. Find your teammates. Set better screens. Go for handoffs. Roll when you set screens. You just gotta find ways.” &gt;  &gt; As Pat Connaughton explained earlier this season, one of the Bucks’ priorities with their new offensive scheme was making it tougher for teams to build “the wall” at the free-throw line. By moving Antetokounmpo from the top of the key to the wing and placing a teammate in “the dunker” spot, the Bucks have been able to take away the wall.  &gt; But there’s just one problem. The wall hasn’t disappeared. It has just moved to a different spot on the floor, disrupting the moves Antetokounmpo makes off the dribble. &gt;  &gt; “Having somebody in ‘the dunker,’ it’s hard,” Antetokounmpo said. “You gotta now almost program yourself to know where your teammates are in the different positions. Things that worked in the past, you cannot do them as much now.”"
&gt; Pat Connaughton  [Video for anyone wondering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqREHiYh1Nk) but be warned the commentary is cringe.
My favorite is when people say Pat Connaughton has sneaky bounce. He had one of the highest verticals ever at the combine so it’s not really sneaky
"I think Middleton and Donte together offer more for the Bucks than Beal and Pat Connaughton as a starter (which would be the likely outcome if the Wizards took our bad trade package).  But Middleton is more efficient than Beal: 61.9% TS vs. 59.2%.  And you're likely rebuttal is that Beal's TS% will go up as a second option, but then his scoring would also go down.  So then he becomes marginally better than Middleton. (if at all).  So what's the benefit of trading for him at that point and making another starting position and depth significantly worse?"
Pat Connaughton
I saw “Per Cleaningtheglass” as “Pat Connaughton” at first glance
"The area where we draft well is hitting on second round picks.  Consistently nabbing guys in the second round that are at least of rotational value is definitely noteworthy.  GTJ, Will Barton, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton and Allen Crabbe were all second round picks that have had at least stints or more of decent rotational value.  These were all picks made under Neil Olshey.  Yes, you can definitely argue that our first round picks are not very successful.  Obviously Dame and CJ as first round picks were both A+, but as of recent, we've had some less than stellar picks.  The Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan first round picks both in 2017 probably being the worst.  Anfernee Simons as a late first in 2018 is still up for debate, but he's starting to look like a good player as of late.  Overall though, grading the Olshey era of drafting, I'd say the Blazers have been slightly above average."
"Giannis was too careless, Khris was too passive, but I don’t care. I refuse to watch another game where Pat fucking Connaughton guards the opposing teams center, gets burned 3 possessions in the 4th quarter of a close marquee game, AND THEN BUD SAYS MY BAD, HE SHOULD BE DEFENDING AD."
They changed up the scheme more this year tonight another ex more switching. Off ball rotations and help was just a mess still don’t know what to do yet perfectly in such situations on switches with a big away from the rim  I didn’t care for the Pat Connaughton at the 4 thing vs Harrell but otherwise don’t think it was really Bud they just got outplayed. Interesting he must have gotten fed up with Middleton on Durant the other night they just had Jrue on LeBron most of the night   Offensively honestly are where my bigger concerns with the bucks are playoff wise
They don’t switch a lot this year been doing it more don’t really have it down yet how to rotate off ball and what to do away from the play on switches  Also this Pat Connaughton at the 4 thing to guard Harrell or even AD a couple times isn’t gonna do many favors defensively. They didn’t make it worthwhile enough offensively todo it either
"Pat Connaughton, the anchor."
Hey Coach Bud why the fuck is PAT CONNAUGHTON closing the game? Thanks.
nah man Pat Connaughton can't be in this game right now. Bud needs to go
they seriously think Pat Connaughton can guard Trez in the post without any help
why the fuck is  Pat Connaughton even in the game
Pat 'Cognitive' Connaughton
Pat Connaughton is definitely better than MCW.
"Hey, put some respect on my boy Pat Connaughton."
Is Pat Connaughton a better player than MCW now?
"But the ones you think of all the time are in the 40s.  That's a pretty big gulf.  Jason Richardson, Zach LaVine, Spud Webb - 46 inches  Jordan, Wilt - 46/48 inches (conflicting reports for Jordan)  Oladipo, Donte DiVincenzo - 42 inches  Muggsy Bogues, Pat Connaughton - 44 inches"
Neither the Dunk contest nor the 3 point contest are limited to all stars. Or do you think Pat Connaughton and Derrick Jones Jr.were all stars?
why do people say “scrappy gym rat lunch pail high effort guy” when they can just say PAT CONNAUGHTON
Pat Connaughton is Jesse Pinkman...
"Bud's rotations are just painful. It's a MLK day game. Middleton and Jrue can handle more than 35 minutes.   Like fuck, man. He just doesn't get it. Big games. Playoffs. Same shit always.   You can't just watch two of the best offensive players in the game cheese on the likes of Forbes and Pat Connaughton for so long."
Why was Pat Connaughton (probably butchered his last name) guarding Kevin Durant lmao
Can someone tell me why Pat Connaughton is guarding Kevin fucking Durant?
Can I add Pat Connaughton jumping into the stands on a pump fake?
"Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton?"
"Donte is struggling a little as of late, but I’d still rather have him.  We were also able to use to BAE to sign Portis because the deal fell through.  Portis has been excellent for us.  He’s a bucket getter, great rebounder, and he’s been getting better on defense.  We were also able to re-sign Pat Connaughton using the MLE, whose been our second best bench player, and DJ Augustin.  I think we came out way ahead in the end since Giannis signed anyways, which was the main reason we were trying to get Bogdan."
Just a PSA. Pat Connaughton was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles not the Chicago Cubs
Just a PSA.  Pat Connaughton was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles not the Chicago Cubs
Just an PSA.  Pat Connaughton was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles not the Chicago Cubs
Jeff Van Gundy just called Pat Connaughton sneaky athletic.
"When I first heard about the recent Kyrie stuff, I thought for sure it was something Pat Connaughton would do."
The MVP race still goes through Milwaukee IMO...not sure this one amazing performance outweighs the incredible season  Pat Connaughton is putting together
He was busy on the bench for the first half of the 4th quarter while Bud had Pat Connaughton try to stop him
i don't do this often with sports but I genuinely think some of my friends could make better rotations than bud. a player gets hot? sometimes he takes them out for like pat connaughton.. put thanasis in early in the quarter? sure... fourth q in the playoffs? 4 bench players and brook lopez
Pat Connaughton has the 3rd highest 3PT% in the league.
What a scrub! Trade him to us for a legit shooters like Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton. This Steph guy needs a Giannis to create him open shots his bum ass can hit. /s
Pat Connaughton was drafted in MLB too I believe.
Iverson was an insane football player. Charlie ward won the Heisman. Anthony Edward's prefer football if I'm not mistaken. Pat connaughton got drafted into the minor leagues. I think the plumlee brothers were multi sport. Don't know about this one but i thought Donovan Mitchell was good at baseball. Steph is amazing at golf. Cp3 is really good at bowling. I'm sure I'm missing a ton
"I think you take Donte over the latter two right now (like, ignore the contracts, consider just this season), but I might just be irrationally high on him since he moves faster and more in control than other guys like his teammate Pat Connaughton."
Pat Connaughton
I can't wait for Pat Connaughton go off for 35 against the Spurs
&gt;Pat Connaughton   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fux6xLF8oyw&amp;ab\_channel=ESPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fux6xLF8oyw&amp;ab_channel=ESPN)
That Pat Connaughton has sneaky hops!
"&gt; Calling Pat Connaughton with a 40+ inch vertical in the dunk contest 'deceptively athletic' is whole different thing lol  I remember watching a Spurs-Bucks game a couple years ago, and the Spurs commentator said Connaughton and DiVincenzo were both ""surprising"" athletes lol."
Neither was Pat Connaughton who was literally bleeding from the face after getting smacked with zero calls. Refs were anus on both sides.
BI for Pat Connaughton who says no
"This. What made Milwaukee so good the last 2 years was that their 2nd unit was much better than other 2nd units. Last year, George hill, divencenzo, Marvin Williams, and Robin Lopez was a really really good 2nd unit. And that doesn’t include Pat Connaughton, Kyle Korver, or Ersan. But none of that matters in playoffs. Cause your depth guys aren’t playing against other team 2s anymore. And you shouldn’t be going 10 deep in playoffs (bucks did). Part of the bucks current “struggles” is that their 2nd unit now sucks at defense. DD is a starter, Williams retired and Lopez and hill both on new teams. DJ Augustine, Bobby Portis, and Forbes are just not good defenders. While Holiday And DD are only slightly better D combo than Bledsoe and Matthew’s (much stronger O combo though). I’m still optimistic for bucks being better in playoffs if Bud commits to playing Jrue-Khris-Giannis as much as possible while Augustine, portis, and Forbes just fill in for points off bench."
Pat Connaughton is one of the five most athletic players in the league
Pat Connaughton would generally be the 2nd or 3rd most athletic guy on *any* team  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Maybe even 1st depending on the team
"Right, I understand but one of the analytics guys was on a Knicks pod (Partnow IIRC) and said in the regular season its hard to scheme for particular shooters. I dont remember all the details but it seems like they dug into it so i kind of think there is something to it. If its a guy like Giannis Im sure everyone knows you can can sag right off but if its between like Pat Connaughton and Brook Lopez its probably harder for the defense to scheme for and really you dont want either shooting wide open.  I really dont know though. I dont think analytics can explain everything so while some of the shooting might be luck I also think there is something to just playing hard and getting guys off their spots. Teams shot the lights out against us every game last year and there was no ""luck adjustment."" When you suck you just suck because ""you let the team get in rhythm so of course they are going to shoot well."" No one this year is giving us credit for ""playing high effort and physical so teams cant get into rhythm."" Double standard in my opinion."
Pat Connaughton does
Pat Connaughton exists lol
Pat connaughton is another one
"This Warriors team is so fun to watch…   GOAT shooter in Steph.   Defensive genius in Draymond.   Complete sentiment-shift on Wiggins.   Pure athlete in Oubre.  Young rookie in Wiseman, a sponge who constantly improves.  Last but not least, a bunch of fucking dogs who hustle til the the clock hits 0:00.   You guys don’t even need Klay, clearly. You guys need hustlers like Pat Connaughton and DJ Wilson. Ignore the flair."
"I’m saying people are irrationally blaming Bud for issues outside of his control (or in the case of our offence inventing issues that don’t exist), because they already want him fired.  I want him gone because his performance against the Heat was unacceptable. The refusal to run any pick and roll with Giannis and Middleton, which we’ve done this year to great effect because it was obvious to anybody who’d ever seen a basketball that it was a good play. The refusal to get Giannis more directly involved in the defence despite his help being clearly ineffective all series. The refusal to go small despite Lopez having similar issues. The refusal to take the ball out of Giannis’ hands until game 4, at which point he immediately kicked the shit out of the Heat until he got injured. Playing Connaughton so much, especially in game one where he was getting absolutely cooked all game while Matthews was doing well resulting in Butler dropping 40. But somehow not playing Connaughton when the Heat were punishing Matthews by moving Robinson down and running him through a million screens, which is something Pat can actually handle.  So much basic stuff that we didn’t even bother trying. At least with the Raptors, that was a great team and basically everybody was playing like shit, what can you really do when you’ve got no options. The Heat weren’t that great and with the notable exceptions of Bledsoe and Hill at PG we were playing fine, he was just incapable of working it out.  That doesn’t apply to a lot of what’s happening this year though. People have no patience and will jump on every little thing that goes wrong to point the finger at him. Half surprised nobody’s blamed him for Jrue being placed in COVID protocols."
"I'd say Hezonja. It is the only reason he still lurks in NBA. Hell, he even dunked over Giannis and blocked LeBron.  As far as I know, Pat Connaughton has the highest vertical among whites in draft combines.  Also people doesn't know since he is mostly 3-pt shooter in NBA but in Europe, Furkan Korkmaz was known for his dunks and even won a slam dunk contest."
Pat Connaughton has a 44 inch vertical.   And a 98mph fastball.
pat connaughton
The problem is that he's much better than Pat Connaughton
Ya’ll sleeping on Pat Connaughton 😤
Yikes Pat Connaughton   Rhetorical question but why is Connaughton playing if the Bucks need points to pull back a lead against a contender
*Bucks getting killed on the perimeter*  Nobody:  Bud: plays 3 big-man lineup along with Middleton and Pat “jump on every pump-fake” Connaughton
PAT CONNAUGHTON
The Donte DiVincenzo disrespect! /s  And Alex Caruso.  And Luke Kennard.  And Pat Connaughton.
"For the Bucks, [I’d love this trade.](https://tradenba.com/trades/NOwOcZD90)   Bucks get: Draymond Green  Warriors get: Pat Connaughton, Donte Divencenzo, and PJ Washington  Hornets: get Brook Lopez, 1st round top 5 protected Milwaukee pick (the soonest one MIL can give up after the Jrue deal)  Why do the Bucks say yes?  Draymond Green is the perfect player for this Bucks team. With Draymond, we have a lineup of Jrue/Middleton/MLE Starter(PJ Tucker again maybe?)/Giannis/Draymond, and that’s guaranteed the number one defense even if Jabari Parker is the starter to be named later. Dray fits in perfect defensively, as Giannis can go back to the free safety role and terrorize while Draymond protects the rim and the paint and Jrue and Mids lock up the perimeter.   Offensively, Dray fits in as the main facilitator. Giannis and Jrue are okay to good as facilitators, but adding Draymond gives the offense a whole new dimension where Khris and Jrue play as off ball shooters while Giannis and Dray play a two man game.  Dray is an upgrade over Brook, and it sucks losing Donte and Patty Cakes, but the upgrade is worth it and I believe makes us top tier title contenders, which is something we are not with Brook Lopez starting.  Why do the Warriors do it?  Giving up the heart and soul of your dynasty isn’t ideal, but you’re getting 3 quality players back, 2 of whom still have great upside. We’ve heard all year how the bench is weak, and it’s their downfall, because, well, it is.  Now with Klay coming back you have Steph/Klay/Wigs/PJ/Wiseman with Donte as a perfect 6th man/Klay recovery fill-in, and another solid bench guy in Pat Connaughton. Also, they have MIN’s 1st and their own. It’s possible they have a Steph/Klay/Cade/Kuminga/Wiseman lineup if the lottery falls perfectly for them.   And even if it doesn’t, they’ll still in theory add 2 NBA caliber players in the draft. This year they have 3.5 competent players (Steph, Wigs, Dray, .5Looney), if they did this trade, next year they’d have (Steph, Klay, Wigs, PJ, Pat, Donte, GS pick, MN pick, .5Looney, .5Wiseman). So they go from 3 quality players to 9 (and 10 if Wiseman develops), restoring their depth from the title days. Replacing Dray with a young PJ Washington and adding two high quality bench guys that will mollywop other bench units. All of a sudden their bench goes from the steaming pile of dump it is this year, to a bench lineup of Poole/Donte/Pat/Paschall/Looney, a top bench lineup in the whole league to go along with world class starters.  Why do the Hornets do this?  Well, simple. You’re upgrading at a spot where you need to, and getting a 1st round pick. You’re the benefactor of having PJ Washington as a piece that GS wants over Brook Lopez, all the while Lopez helps you too.  Lopez is a clear upgrade over Zeller, and Melo/Rozier/Bridges/Hayward/Lopez is a playoff lineup for sure. Brook is tailor made to play with Melo, pick and pops would be deadly, and Lopez is great in the post which becomes an enhanced skill with Melo throwing entry passes to him.   PJ is a good young player, but Lopez helps you more now, and you get a 1st as well. No brainer."
"Pat Connaughton. Legend has it that if you go to your local YMCA gym and half-ass a pump fake, he will mystically appear to jump 12 feet in the air to allow you a wide open drive to the basket."
Bud is about to start Pat Connaughton at Power forward if you do this
Did you know that Giannis and Thanasis used to share a pair of shoes in Greece? Did you know that Pat Connaughton was a pitcher in college and had a great fastball?
"For anyone wondering:  RHJ (on draft night) for Mason Plumlee + Pat Connaughton from Brooklyn   Plumlee for Nurk + a 1st from Denver a year later.   That 1st + another 1st to Sacramento for the 10th pick, Zach Collins.  Interestingly that Nuggets -&gt; Blazers -&gt; Kings pick was used to select harry Giles. who is also currently a Blazer."

Pat Connaughton looking like Kyle Korver on that 3
"Right those guys you listed are helped tremendously, guys like Kuzma, Cody Martin, Pat Connaughton, Lonzo Ball, and etc would get less. Maxes help the players which is why PA votes for them, no maxes hurt them. I wasn’t arguing with OP just agreeing with him with more info"
"Pat Connaughton seems about right at $5M/year, not quite minimum but certainly less than 10"
I always get him confused with Pat Connaughton
"My guess:   Sam Merrill-Bryn Forbes-Pat Connaughton-Thanasis-Brook Lopez as the starters  Axel Toupane - Jordan Nwora -Mamadi Diakite as the bench.  Eight man rotation, Bucks have two open roster spots in addition to all these players being out, so lots of minutes for everyone there."
I mean you don’t get much more Irish than Pat Connaughton so maybe the Bucks
"Lopez might not have, but Pat Connaughton appears to foul the shit out of Len. He gets all sorts of arm and hand. Connaughton also shoves another player right before, haha"
"I know Forbes is technically the right answer, but it just *feels* like it should be Pat Connaughton"
"Part of the reason I wish we had kept Wes Matthews. I'd like Jrue on Kyrie and obviously Giannis on Durant, but Wes was such a great 1 on 1 defender. Khris is solid but he gets so gas that his offense suffers. I think him guarding Kawhi vs. the Raptors is part of why he shot so poorly.  Doesn't matter though I'm sure Bud will have someone dumb like Pat Connaughton on Harden, Brook on Durant, and Jrue on DAJ."
"I don't think Bryn has been that bad on that end for us. It's Pat Connaughton that's been a huge liability IMO. The scouting report must be out on him that he can't play post defense to save his life.  It has become a regular occurrence where teams try to get him on an island in the post, and it's just random guys who you would never think of as having a post-up game. It's definitely more than the standard ""white guy guarding me"" confidence boost that you see, too; this action is lot more deliberate."
Pat Connaughton averages 5 FFPFPG (Flights for pump fakes per game)
"The only passable Celtic was Jaylen Brown in that series. They got torched by George Hill, Pat Connaughton, and Ersan Ilyasova. Its a team game and most of the Celtics looked completely scared and shook. Horford, Tatum, Hayward were also very poor offensively. I assume anyone blaming Kyrie just looked at the box score and didn't watch any games."
We had so many opportunities to win this one. Not even gonna mention Pat Connaughton whacking Gafford on his putback attempt that would have tied the game
Pat Connaughton better keep the same energy for the playoffs
"Oh yeah good idea, let's put fucking Pat Connaughton on KD"
I'm so sick of pat Connaughton 4th quarter minutes. Bud should be fired for that alone
So the Pat Connaughton
"I think your missing a bunch of players and you're criteria is off a bit. Its usually 3&amp;D wings that people are after - guard defence is much less important than wing defence. I definitely would not have pat connaughton, lonzo ball or fred van vleet, or ddv on this list unless you'd be happy sticking one of them on paul george for a qtr (i would not). You missed Miles Bridges who I think is useful, also Trevor Ariza. Porzingis and JJJ would also be included in your criteria, but again they are centers so i wouldnt put them in."
" Sterling Brown, Pat Connaughton, Divincenzo and Brogdon...  ...The Bucks had 4 of these guys on their squad at one time!"
"I agree, a better search might be something like DBPM &gt; 0, 3PAr &gt; .5 so you can see people who have a positive impact on defense and take the majority of their shots from 3  I can't see the full results on Stathead, but of the 20 players the 10 who show up are Maxi Kleber, Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo, Lonzo Ball, Jae Crowder, Robert Covington, OG Anunoby, Pat Connaughton, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Kevin Huerter so it checks out with OP's list"
Pat Connaughton is hyped about the possibilities.
"This is just not true? There are inadvertent hits to the head in like every game; it’s the nature of a blocking motion from a taller player to carry through towards the upper torso. Watch any guard driving in the paint, you will eventually see some kind of contact  Like Half the time it’s the aggressive player initiating contact by leading with their upper body. Pat Connaughton got facepalmed last game because he was defending from behind and turned into a swinging arm and no foul was called (rightly)."
"At some point, Thanasis started blurring the lines between ""high motor + awful decision making"" and ""irrational confidence,"" and honestly I wish he got more minutes a lot of the time.  He's not the best shooter, but teams don't hunt him out on defense every posession (cough Pat Connaughton cough) and he's not afraid to try to create offense for himself or others (cough again Pat)"
so could pat connaughton

"Explain how Pat Connaughton hits Book on the head defending him for a layup, with no call? I’m fine with fouls being called as long as they’re consistent for both teams."
"Just as everyone predicted, Pat Connaughton and PJ Tucker tie the game for the bucks after being down 6 with a few minutes left in OT"
Pat Connaughton?
"Nationally, not sure anyone is overhated.  Maybe Giannis at times, but that is just due to greater scrutiny with greatness.  Among the fanbase, probably Pat Connaughton, who is entirely uninteresting as a player and has no Stans, but is a very solid player.  His biggest flaw is that he is best as a combo-forward skill wise, but is the size of a SG.  But he admirably plays bigger than his size."
"Donte D is one of the least important players to be out in terms of individual talent, but we had to watch Pat Connaughton try to defend like 5 high screens for KD in a row last night as a consequence. Of course a better coach could avoid that happening, but we are stuck with him until the end of our postseason at least"
"does conley start though? if were talking about how big of a blow it is to the team, i feel like losing a starter is worse. especailly if it mean Pat Connaughton is getting big minutes in the playoffs."
"Yeah, that was a best case scenario for his 1-legged defense, to use strength over mobility.  He was also doing decently in 1-on-1 against Jrue.    Of course, the play after this post-up, they forced Harden to move, Giannis screened him off and he couldn't keep up with Connaughton on a dribble hand-off, and Pat got an easy layup.  And then the Bucks never ever went back to any action that put actual pressure on Harden to move laterally and chase like that again."
"You very well may be right, I did a quick cruise over to the bucks page on epsn and it shows they have him and Connaughton listed as 2s and they pay Pat almost $2m more, but I'm honestly not that familiar with who the Bucks starters actually are on paper."
"You Have 3 All-NBA level defenders on the court--including a DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR, and not ONCE, not ONCE, did Holiday or Giannis guard KD in the 4th quarter. They let PAT CONNAUGHTON switch onto KD THREE TIMES. I'm not even a fan of the Bucks I just hate seeing bad basketball. Why? Why even sign defenders if they're just gonna stand there and defend corner 3s?? Fire Bud."
Not pat connaughton
"What is the fucking point of having Giannis, a DPOY, signing Holiday, a multiple time All-NBA defender, and signing PJ Tucker, the scrappiest player in the league, if you're going to let PAT CONNAUGHTON get switched onto KD."
Kd straight up shoved Connaughton coming down the court couple possessions ago and Pat ended up committing a foul ..
"Harden stuffs Giannis with half a hamstring, and Pat god damn Connaughton saves the day.  What pride had wrought."
"UPDATE: Looks like Bud finally, finally did. Pat Connaughton is a defensive weakness you don't want out there but it's better than the alternative rn"
Pat Connaughton
It’s really just a big Jeff Green Pat Connaughton 1v1
Pat Connaughton averages 6.8 pts and already has 8 in the first half. What kind of BS is that?
Pat Connaughton tonight with the eye bandage looks like every dude in South Boston on Monday morning
Pat Connaughton looks like Jesse Pinkman with less drugs
Pat Connaughton is better than your favorite player.
Bucks countering the Jeff Green game with the rare Pat Connaughton game
It's a Pat Connaughton takeover
Pat fucking connaughton
Why does Pat Connaughton remind me of Jesse Pinkman?
Let’s not forget Pat Connaughton blocked KD also.
Busy protecting him from the likes of Pat Connaughton
"Ah yes, they have stars like Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton coming off the bench"
Pat Connaughton entered the chat and wants a word with you.
"Bud will play him 20 minutes a game, make pat connaughton guard embiid"
"It also doesn't help when Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson make a big deal out of it. Those two are terrible commentators who love to get fans riled up over the dumbest shit.   Most of the time they get on their soap box they're just wrong, but fans eat that shit up.  The called the hit to Pat Connaughton incidental and dismissed it, but now somehow the NBA needs to do something about Giannis' foot being in the wrong place / wrong time?  Guys fall on each other all the time around the rim and if the NBA did try to do something about it, JVG would be the first to complain about the league getting soft. ""So now the NBA has said you can't be near anyone when they're going to the basket, give me a break!"""
"Pat Connaughton bleeds after getting elbowed in the eye by Joe Harris, no call.  Nikola Jokic goes for the ball and his bicep grazes Payne's face, tossed out the game.  Mainstream media narrative pouring over into sports."
"&gt; I’m just saying every fan base would think this ply was dirty.   What play?  He ran in for the rebound and Kyrie landed on his foot. It's unfortunate but there's nothing dirty there, Giannis wasn't looking to take away his landing space and it's not realistic to have landing space rules under the rim because of how crowded it always gets.   The dirty play this game was Joe Harris hitting Pat Connaughton in the face."
Pat Connaughton was hit much harder than Jokic hit Payne and they didn't even whistle it lol!
And sometimes blood isn't even enough for a foul. Just ask Pat Connaughton
"Pat Connaughton gets elbowed and starts bleeding out, no call no foul. Hard playoff ball.  This game, Jokic goes for a steal too aggressively and gets tossed. Not allowed to play hard and make a mistake.   I'm not saying it should have been a no-call but christ! It's the playoffs! Payne got clipped and got stunned, but he walked it off in a few seconds. Call it a foul, flagrant 1 fuck it whatever but EJECTION? wooooow that is insane"
Some interesting duos of the tonight's game between the Nets and the Bucks.     |Duo|Score (for the Bucks)| |:-|:-| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Khris Middleton|82-51| |Giannis Antetokounmpo + Pat Connaughton|53-26| |Khris Middleton + Pat Connaughton|56-31|  &amp;#x200B;  |Duo|Score (for the Nets)| |:-|:-| |Jeff Green + Landry Shamet|15-6| |Kyrie Irving + Jeff Green|8-0| |Jeff Green + Nicolas Claxton|27-21|

Pat Connaughton looks like buds son
"Pat ""Deadeye"" Connaughton"
Harris hit Pat Connaughton not Blake
"Nets can't even win with Pat Connaughton being out, smh how much help do they need"
It's even now.  Nets lost Kyrie  Bucks lost Pat Connaughton
Pat Connaughton out here lookin like Nate Diaz
Nate Diaz 🤝 Pat Connaughton
"""*Nothing.*"" - Pat Connaughton"
I agree but…what exactly are they gonna do about it? I don’t think the league gives a fuck what Pat Connaughton thinks about KD and it’s not going to make anybody quit the league
"There's no shame in losing to the Nets, even without Harden. But it's the way the Bucks are losing, the except same way as the EFC meltdown vs. the Raptors and the same way as vs. the Heat last season. Part of that is the (lack of) basketball IQ from the players but it's also on the coach for not putting the players in a position to succeed. Why does Brook Lopez rarely post up? It'd be especially usefull if Giannis is off the floor.  Why doesn't Jrue run the PnR with Giannis? Why is Pat Connaughton his favorite player?"
"Not such a bad play. Zubac shouldn't have jumped and it'd be fine, it would be a contested 3 even without wasting time on the pump fake. Reminds me of Pat Connaughton always flying there for the block, no clue why players do this shit."
"Durant takes the midcourt shot at the buzzer because it's the playoffs. In Game 1, Pat Connaughton decided to save his shooting percentage by shooting after the buzzer . That tells you everything about the basketball IQ of these teams."
Any other coach in the NBA would give Pat Connaughton 0 minutes yet bud plays him starter minutes. He adds absolutely nothing in the floor except missed threes
"Bro what. I'm sure they'd come in hot if it were Joe Harris and Pat Connaughton beefing too. The cop with Ujiri was a different story, this is security trying to rush out and break things up."
Pat Connaughton should be playing 0 min a game
Been a while since I’ve seen Connaughton be “Planet Pat”
did anyone else just see pat connaughton contest that three pointer by clapping in front of brett brown instead of putting his hand in his face  i can't close out in time so I will just try to distract him by clapping?
Let's shorten playoff games to like.. 2 20 minute halves and just play starters the whole time.  Or we can all keep pretending that it's totally ok to watch Mike James attack Pat Connaughton in the post for a few minutes each night.   Just spitballing here
"Its tricky because i bet that was the plan. Have Brook play and see how he does and as he starts getting exposed, sub him out for tucker in crucial minutes so the lineup would be:  Giannis-Tucker-Middleton-Holiday-DiVincenzo   but with Donte out we’re down to either Forbes or Connaughton and at that point you have to see whats better, Nets exposing the big guy on the perimeter but taking away two’s or have Forbes or Pat in and *maybe*reducing threes while giving up more in the paint.   Watching the games, you can see the paints guarded heavily at the beginning but as KD and Kyrie started torching it up, they get more and more attention leading to more 2s. I never liked Buds coaching style but I feel bad for him in this series. Imagine having to win to jeep your job but you’re playing against some of the best scorers doing 50/50/90 splits in the post season"
"Lol yes i'm serious but you're entitled to your own opinion.  Durant &gt;&gt; Giannis  Kyrie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Middleton  Sure, Jrue Holiday is &gt;&gt; Joe harris but the gap between the top two nets versus top two bucks is huge.  I'd also argue shammet, mike james, claxton are equal role players/bench to bryn forbes, bobby portis (LOL), and pat connaughton..."
"Bud is so gone, I cannot believe Pat fucking Connaughton is getting these minutes in playoff games. He knows this matters, right? Why is he running a 2-3 zone against one of the greatest outside shooting teams EVER? The Bucks don't stand a chance with Harden back unless they adjust somehow  Giannis is so bad at free throws at it makes me even more mad because he takes 10 years to shoot them  Kevin Durant might be the best player in the world it's really close at the top rn with no clear player pulling away"
"Nah I won't blame him for the minutes this time, the game was over in the third and there's no point in risking it  I will blame him for literally everything else. A 2-3 zone against the greatest outside shooting team maybe EVER???? Why the fuck is Pat Connaughton getting so many minutes? Why are their rotations like 10 men deep instead of 6-8 like every other playoff team? Jesus christ"
We just ran out a lineup of Jrue/Bryn Forbes/Pat Connaughton/Khris/Bobby Portis while both Kyrie and KD were still in the game
"Pat Connaughton being deceptively bouncy when talking about him dunking or blocking a shot is always hilarious to me. ""oh the guy with the highest vertical in his draft class is just so sneaky when jumping"""
A rested Pat Connaughton is worse than the corpse of Giannis
I was once up 40 in the 3rd quarter of a 2K game and I simmed. Lost the game and the chance at the best regular season record ever because Pat Connaughton dropped 50+ in 8 mins??
Jokes on you it'll be Pat Connaughton
Does anyone think Pat Connaughton shouldn’t be in the nba
Is Pat Connaughton any good? I recall he sucked ass last time we played the Bucks
The graphic for the Game 2 promos should feature Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes versus Mike James and Landry Shamet.
"I expect the Nets to target Forbes or Pat Connaughton as the weak link in defense, like harden did against fournier.  I also expect Giannis and Brook Lopez to kill the boards."
A lot of them were traded away  We picked Ronde Hollis Jefferson in 2015 who was traded for Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton who we developed into an NBA player  Didn’t have one in 16 I don’t think   2017. We picked Zach Collins at 10 and Caleb Swannigan in the late 20s which considering the talent available in our range in that draft is a franchise altering disaster   18 we picked Anfernee Simons at 24 or 26 which was a good pick  19 we picked Nas Little who has shown flashes of being good but needs time  20 we didn’t have a pick
"Pat Connaughton will take the Donte minutes whenever Kyrie is out there, and you sneak Forbes out there when it's Tyler Johnson."
"So what's the answer, more PJ Tucker at the 3 or Pat Connaughton getting heavy minutes? Or even Bryn Forbes"
"Well, I don't believe you there.  But if you actually are telling the truth, that's an absolutely absurd way to judge player/team performance.  Expectations and talent level matter when judging how a team/player did.  I'm not getting mad at Pat Connaughton for not putting up Giannis-like statlines every night, because he doesn't have the talent to do it or the expectation that he would come close to doing that.  Judging a supposedly talent-loaded team that chokes, the same as a team devoid of talent that everyone knew would be in a rebuilding year, just because the two teams had the same end to the season, is asinine."
"We’ve had good defences under Stotts so that’s not true at all  His offensive scheme fits the players we have. It’s been wildly different in the past  We’ve only gone to an 8 man rotation recently and it’s worked.   We’ve developed a ton of dudes. GTJ, Jake Layman, Pat Connaughton,Allen Crabbe, Simons. Basically everyone who comes to Portland has their best year(s) and fall off when they leave, Seth Curry is maybe the only player over the last 5+ years that has maintained or improved their production since leaving   Stop making shit up to fit your agenda"
"Khris on Harden is barbeque chicken lmao, you put Jrue on him (maybe even PJ) and live with Kyrie cooking Donte (or I guess now Pat Connaughton or Brynn Forbes)"
i am shocked Shaq knows who Pat Connaughton is
Shaq being a Pat Connaughton fan is pretty funny
Shaq being a Pat Connaughton fan is pretty funny
Pat Connaughton looks like he'll start for Donte
"I think ending games with PJ/Giannis at ""center"" is the right move against Brooklyn, and inserting even Pat Connaughton in place of Divincenzo.  Connaughton from what I've seen has played capable enough defense this year and has hit his threes."
Harden is jrue's job. Would always have been. Donte would almost certainly have been on kyrie. Giannis takes KD and work from there. Issue now is you've gotta probably match Kyrie up with Pat Connaughton
"I think it all depends on who is on the floor.  If Pat Connaughton is on, Giannis will guard KD.  If PJ is on the floor, he might guard KD or even Harden because of the Donte injury.  If Brook is off the floor, Giannis will likely guard the center.  Our whole defense is going to have to live by the flexibility they’ve practiced this year."
"Pat Connaughton, who’s been good this year."
"his defense is needed for the nets. you think a rotation of holiday, Bryn Forbes and pat connaughton are gonna stop Kyrie and harden?"
"Wes isn't a bad shooter, but is garbage compared to Forbes and Portis this year.  Hill was a big loss off the bench, but made it work.  Jrue's around .400 so this team's 3 shooting just seems better across the board.  Even Pat Connaughton took a huge leap in 3% and no one really knows exactly why.  Having better playmakers gives you better shots for sure."
I doubt this is bothering Pat Connaughton much
"Pat Connaughton looks like a 5'6"" guy on TV, but he's actually 6'5"".  Strange how that works."
Pat Connaughton &amp; Bobby Portis are inevitable.
Pat Connaughton&gt;Herro
We have Brooke Lopez and 2 of the best rebounding guards in Pat Connaughton and Donte Divicenzo. Khris Middleton is also a decent rebounder
Pat Connaughton jumping 5 feet in the air on pump fakes
Giannis again. He’s likely talking about last year’s Butler stopper (in Bud’s mind) Pat Connaughton.
"I mean yeah, but most relatively good coaches would have put Giannis, the DPOY last year, in the other team's best scorer. Also they would have given ball handling duties to other players instead of letting teams build a wall to stop Giannis, the primary ball handler last year. Also they would've given their stars more than 35 mpg in a tough series instead of giving fucking Pat Connaughton 20 minutes."
Pat “Mahomes” Connaughton
Robin Lopez - Whirling Dervish Spins  Pat Connaughton: Skying 10 feet past a 3 point shooter when biting on a pump fake.
Jimmy Butler has been outscored by Pat Connaughton.  I'm not even gonna compare him to a superstar like Bryn Forbes because that would be unfair.
Pat Connaughton played baseball should become the new Jimmy Graham played basketball
"Pat ""Perfect from Three"" Connaughton?"
I have reports that Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes will be NBA Co-MVPs this year
He botched a few names in Bucks vs. Heat. One of them being Pat Connaughton for Brook Lopez lol
Did anyone else notice in game 1 of Heat Bucks when he mixed up Pat Connaughton with Brook Lopez? They don't even look remotely similar lol
"You gonna get the NBA to grant them some extra roster spots? Lol. Then we can go get Dragic, Robinson, Dougy McBuckets, Lauri, Olynyk, McConnell, Prichard, the Bogdonvic Brothers &amp; maybe still have space for Pat Connaughton so he can teach everybody how to jump."
Hubie Brown randomly talking about Brook Lopez after Pat Connaughton scores 😂
"1. Giannis - duh 2. Holiday - best season of his career 3. Middleton - quintessential fit with Giannis 4. Portis - 6’10 and 47% on 3P’s 5. Divincenzo - Brook is 33 (sigh)  Toughest omissions: Brook Lopez, Brynn Forbes, Pat Connaughton"
"It's really hard to say if it's a net negative or not, but you do see the downside of it in games like the Bucks one where he left Pat Connaughton open two possessions in a row and dude splashed two threes to keep the Bucks in the game and eventually win.  You could argue if he doesn't get those rebounds he doesn't put in effort, which would definitely be a net negative."
"Ayton really needs to force the issue. Way too many times he has Pat Connaughton on him, but the only way he gets the ball is an offensive rebound off a CP3 and Booker miss.  Reminds me of the Kobe story where the only way his teammates got his ball was from his misses. Ayton in this case is the teammates"
dude. come on. or are you joking? just watch them play basketball jeez. sure Pat gets blown by here and there but just imagine curry trying to guard the guys Pat does 1 on 1. unless you're a legend like Jrue (and maybe gary payton since i think he's short too) you're not gonna be a better defender than a guy who's as bigger than you as connaughton is to curry.
"its more funny when you realize how easily the narrative can swing either way based on razor thin W or L, even when the players game remains the same.  Bucks eliminated and kris had a stinker in that game?  ship him out of here, bucks can't win w/ him!  (like at various times in these playoffs people were calling for jrue's head, kris' head, pat connaughton is worthless etc.  Memory of a goldfish"
"Damn you wouldn’t trade Khris for Lebron?  I kid, I know what you mean.  The gap between Khris and CJ isn’t that big, and adding two picks you can flip for a player makes tons of sense in a vacuum.  Especially when your lineup next year looks like Giannis, Khris, Jrue, Brook, Donte Divenchenzo, Pat Connaughton, and…:. That’s it"
If everyone on the Bucks get covid and Pat Connaughton has to ply 1v5 and wins is he FMVP?
"Marcus Smart, he takes a lot of flak for his playing style while other worse players that rely on a similar style get undeserved praises. I think it's because he plays in Boston, many people hate that team.   Also Pat Connaughton."
My favorite superstar is Pat Connaughton and his favorite player is Bobby Portis.

Why did Bud draw up that play for a Pat Connaughton open three? What a dumbass.
"Crazy how the Suns did the wrong thing before their critical two turnovers in game 4 and game 5.  In game 4, CP3 tried to make a play against Jrue instead of giving it to red hot Booker against PJ.  In game 5, they attack Pat Connaughton on defense during the 4th. And they instead just go with an Booker iso where the three Bucks can get into the paint."
"Jrue Holiday, Donte DiVincenzo, Khris Middleton, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez.   Jeff Teague, Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis."
I’ve never heard a single person call him Vinny lmao  Patty Fastball is an actual nickname for Connaughton but seems like everyone had defaulted to Planet Pat as we get further and further from his baseball days
Yes that’s right Pat Connaughton is why you’re losing y’all better double Pat
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again any time the subject comes up. Pat Connaughton and I are Eskimo brothers. That’s what we all need to remember.
Blazers legend Pat Connaughton
Not sure if it would have been fewer Tucker minutes or fewer Pat Connaughton minutes. I'm leaning towards the latter based on the playoffs games Donte played in this season.
&gt;Connaughton is a much better rebounder.  Not at all. Donte is an exceptional rebounder for a guard as well as Pat is. DiVincenzo has averaged more rebounds/game than Pat for the last 2 years.
Yeah I wanted CP3 to get a ring but Pat Connaughton is my favorite buck now. I love that Irish jobber.
"This and the Hawks series both would/would have been a lot easier with Donte. By advanced stats he's the best offensive rebounding shooting guard in the league (Connaughton is second), he's got a good three-pointer  (though unsure if he hits that like Pat has been doing) and he's an elite defender which, as much as I think Pat has been great, would be an upgrade over Pat's current minutes on Booker."
"As one of the few Pat Connaughton defenders when we re-signed him this offseason, I feel vindicated.  Dude just makes winning plays, and he’s cleaned up his dumb jumping on every close out.  Most important role player in this series."
They did the same thing to us with their rebounding. It was absolutely ridiculous how it felt like the most badly missed balls would just drop into their hands for an easy putback. It was extremely frustrating lmao. PJ Tucker and Pat Connaughton crash the boards so hard and it catches people off guard.
"i had a coworker a couple years back who’d use his name interchangeably when he wanted to talk about a nobody player who’s good but not really great at anything, “a Pat Connaughton or whoever”. defended Pat then and i’ll never stop. what he’s great at is hustle. he and Bobby are awesome sixth men."
I'm gonna need him to start chucking them in Game 6 - if Pat Connaughton hits the most 3's in a playoffs I'm gonna lose my mind.
Pat Connaughton at 5m a year is such a great pick up for the bucks
Pat Connaughton and Portis had some big boy rebounds. It's not like Brook and Giannis are out there getting them all.
I wonder how Jae and Ayton feel when Pat Motherfuckin' Connaughton is grabbing rebounds above their hands
Pat Connaughton is the xfactor this series
"With game high +14, he was great on offense but key on defense against D Booker... he kinda disappeared on the second half.  Btw... Pat Connaughton can't defend shit, great 3's but was Bbq Chicken in the 4th. Hope he can become better on that side."
Shoutout to Pat Connaughton. Guy makes clutch shots every game
Once again shout out to Pat Connaughton. Dudes been an unsung hero
"Fucking Pat Connaughton, once again....."
"Devin Booker could walk onto the court with a gun, shoot Pat Connaughton in the foot, and get away with it"
ayton losing boards to pat connaughton
Is Pat connaughton the best role player in a finals series since Iguodala?
"That's Pat ""Second highest ORB% shooting guard in the league"" Connaughton"
We've gotten the to the point that Pat fucking Connaughton is grabbing offensive rebounds over three Suns defenders
"There should be a “finals 6th man award”, and it should go to Pat Connaughton for this series"

Hey ! Pat Connaughton is sneaky athletic !
"I’m not saying Pat Connaughton should win Finals MVP or anything like that, but he’s been really key to the Bucks overall success. I’m not sure the Bucks could win this series without him and I don’t think that’s an exaggeration"
FMVP Pat Connaughton??
Lol imagine trying to stop pat connaughton 😂

The suns attacking pat connaughton is a smart move they’re all getting the switch on him
Pat Connaughton is just gonna get killed on defense. Stop playing him ffs
jvg has some incredibly bad takes sometimes. booker shoulder checked pat connaughton a few games ago and he thought that should have been a no call. and he thinks brook lopez should apparently be allowed to hold back cam johnson by the shoulder to chase the baseline cutter. lol
I haven’t seen it but I’m certain Pat Connaughton has an enormous dong
I assume that '24' flare you have is for Pat Connaughton?
"pat connaughton is really playing beyond anyones wildest expectations this series and even this whole playoffs  that man has so much energy, his hustle plays to grab offensive rebounds from guys who are 6 inches taller than him or more is really impressive"
Pat “the white Larry bird” connaughton
Pat Connaughton 2nd best player on the bucks and it’s not even close dont @me
Pat Connaughton been awesome from 3!
My theory is that Bud is going for style points so he can say he won the Finals playing a Jeff Teague / Pat Connaughton backcourt
Pat Connaughton looks like he works in an office
Pat Connaughton is the only thing standing between us and a 30 point finals blowout.    Let that sink in.
Pat Connaughton going to drag this team to the trophy
"At this rate, team USA could use a Pat Connaughton."
Pat connaughton mr reliable
mike breen loves pat connaughton
Pat Connaughton is probably the guy I trust most when I need a 3 (on Bucks)
"I want Olshey gone literally as much as anyone but I don't think it's fair to say that Dame is his only good draft pick. If you compare his drafting record around the league it's well above average, specifically with guards, and even well into the 2nd round.   You've got Dame and CJ of course (10th pick doesn't guarantee you a player of CJs caliber), Allen Crabbe (31st pick), Pat Connaughton (41st), Will Barton (40th), and Anfernee (24th). The Blazers seem to know how to draft guards, whether that's Olshey or the scouts is beyond me but that's an undeniable record."
"Ok NBA trade machine accepted this:  Portland Receives: Jrue Holiday, Donte Divencenzo, Pat Connaughton  Milwaukee receives: Dame Lillard, Anfernee Simons, CJ Elleby"
Pat Connaughton actually leads all Bucks with at least 1 3pt attempt per game in 3pt percentage these playoffs at .388.
Pat connaughton is a replaceable minimum level player who got wayyy too many minutes in that series. I took issue as much with bud who insists on playing regular season guys
Pat “Steve Kerr” Connaughton
"Pat Connaughton, IRS"
No? More Pat Connaughton slander!
Pat Connaughton
"Eh, no. That was a full on hip check, that came because he knew PJ was about to blow past him to the offensive glass. Crowder decided he was gonna flop so he ran towards pat c and ""stumbled."" There was barely any contact and Connaughton was stationary."
“It’s a make-or-airball league” - Pat Connaughton
"Then Middleton looked at Giannis in the eyes like he was the only other person in the room. He proceeded to pick Giannis up and carry him to the Bucks locker room and layed him down hot dog style on one of the benches. Giannis layed there with his limbs dangling. Middleton stood over him powerfully for what felt like a lifetime. Bobby Portis exlaimed, ""Omg not this again!"". Thelo na me nioseis  by Nikos Vertis began playing in the background. Coach bud posted up in a nearby corner smoking a jazz cigarette, never once looking away. Then and there something beautiful happened and I don't have the words to describe it. They should have sent a poet. Pat Connaughton watched as well, trapped inside his locker, frozen by a mixture of curiosity and fear. He wondered if this is what they meant when they said ""Fear the Deer""."
The Bucks rotation is actually starting 5 with Portis and Pat Connaughton. Then spot Teague minutes. So closer to 8. Really depends on how Brook is shooting. He gets cooked on defense and Pat is a much better play right now plus Giannis at Center. I think you keep starting Brook to see if he is hot from 3 in each half but keep a short leash for smaller ball.
"Ah, well, nevertheless...  Gutted is the only word. Absolutely gutted. Devin Booker is the man. The Bucks have a couple repeatable things in their recipe that will almost always end up on their way (OREBs and FTs), and the way for the Suns to counter it is for the backcourt to play well. They took turns dropping stinkers but man, this was RIGHT THERE for the taking. If Cam Payne hadn't lost two three steps playing through his ankle injury, or if Chris Paul hadn't tore his wrist ligaments, or if Booker wasn't in perpetual foul trouble while being the best player on the court (part of it self inflicted, part of it a bad whistle) or if Giannis didn't make one of the best defensive plays of all time, or if this randomly wasn't the Pat Connaughton series...  At the end of the day, the Bucks played with amazing intensity while the Suns with just ""good"", and that led to most Bucks outplaying most Suns. But, we are in a 3 game series with homecourt advantage. We just need to play Suns basketball.   In some ways this was game 2 in inverse, Giannis-Book had an incredible performance and the supporting cast did barely not enough to eek out the win.  Anyway, credit to the Bucks for responding in a way the Clippers couldn't (didn't have the bodies to?). They're an awesome team and as a Greek NBA fan it kills me to root against Giannis.   Having said that, fuck the Bucks, Suns in 6."
"When Booker got 4 fouls and still stayed in, I would’ve liked to see them attack him and try getting him into further foul trouble. Either Middleton or Giannis running a pick and pop with Pat Connaughton, and PHX would likely switch, putting Booker on Middleton or Giannis— a great 1 on 1 matchup."
Pat “pisses in the woods” Connaughton
"Yah, if I haven’t picked a side after 4 out of 7 games I really don’t care who wins I just want 7 games.  I think CP3, Booker and Ayton getting a ring is an extremely impactful story for the league.  CP3 getting one after so many people thought he had the worst contract in the league. After being traded over and over again. After all his injuries at the worst time.  Not gonna lie, if he does win, and 20 years pass and I have some youngins trying to say he was on the LeBron level…. I’m gonna remind them how his antics cost him games, how he would try to do too much stuff you lose looking at highlights and box scores.   But still, winning a title, in this era playing the way he does? It could reinvigorate the PG role and position. Maybe Trae spends the next 4 years trying to be a better game manager and defender rather than scoring more.  Booker and Ayton also have the storyline of being the rebirth of Shaq and Kobe. They are both so young and doing so much it’s crazy.   As much as CP3 is getting credit, I have Booker than Ayton, then CP3 in my FMVP for the Suns.  Then we have the Bucks…   Giannis getting MVP, DPOY, every award you can get besides ROY and then cementing that with his first ring at only 26? While not having the kind of help that every team since 2011 has had.  This transitional era when the older guard is potentially dropping off and the new is taking over starts with an incredible player something we haven’t really seen before in Giannis.   And then the rest of the Bucks… Lopez, Middleton, Holiday, Tucker, even Pat Connaughton all vets who know how rare a chance at a ring like this gets."
Pat Connaughton has gotten two BANG calls from Breen just wanted to point that out.
"Maybe you don’t know but, Pat is 6’5” and hit 44” vertical at his combine.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2465204-pat-connaughton-posts-44-inch-max-vertical-leap-at-2015-nba-combine.amp.html"
"My favourite cherry-picked statistic is that the shooting guard with the highest ORB% (% of offensive rebounds that happened while the player was on the floor, that were the result of the player) in the league is Donte DiVincenzo, and the shooting guard with the second highest ORB% in the league is Pat Connaughton."
"They are not trying to ref for the purpose of a fairly officiated game, they are reffing to protect the stars or swing momentum to the team trailing, ensure a certain number of points scored or whatever else.   If a call is a call then it’s easy to make. There will always be mistakes but it won’t ruin the game. What we have now is the call is a call for Chris Paul but not for pat connaughton. The call is a call for Middleton but not if they are down by 10. And then not only are they making bad calls, they have to think about what call the need to make to achieve the desired result. And then if they get it wrong they need to make the makeup call to cancel it out. Its been ruining the game for years but we still watch"
Orioles legend Pat Connaughton
"The one where he flew all the way up the court when he walked past Pat Connaughton, or the one where he took a jumper, didn't get touched and got 3 ft's off of it."
"As someone who’s followed his career since college, it’s crazy to me that Pat Connaughton of all people is a focal point in this series, both good and bad."
Devin Booker was outplayed by Pat Connaughton in game 3.   Therefore we can assume that he’s is the best player in the series
Chris Paul was outplayed by Pat Connaughton
Cp3 outplayed by Pat Connaughton. Wow
"His rebounding down the stretch was abysmal. Gave the bucks many second chances and let Pat Connaughton fly right by him to get a clutch put back. He needs to come down with those. Also missed way too many point blank looks. Booker, Payne, and Cam Johnson felt like the only ones that showed up aided by Crowder’s theatrics"
"Pat ""Yo Mr White"" Connaughton"
"I owe Pat Connaughton an apology, I hate on him a lot. Just goes to show even the worst player in the NBA, when forced into regular action due to injuries, can have a good game once every 20+ games."
World champion Pat Connaughton wants attention too!
" &gt;see him being guarded by a bunch of Pat Connaughton,  McDermott, JJ Reddick kinda dudes.  I really don’t associate those names with guys like Dominique wilkins, Dr J, James Worthy, Michael Cooper....not to mention other players who guarded Bird like Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, George Gervin, Bernard King and other assorted all-stars from that era"
"You only need to see any Larry Bird footage on YouTube to see him being guarded by a bunch of Pat Connaughton,  McDermott, JJ Reddick kinda dudes. Imagine what KD would do if 50% of dudes in the League were like that"
Giannis  Khris  Jrue  Brook Lopez   Donte Divincenzo  Bobby Portis  Pat Connaughton  And idk Grayson Allen
Really make up for the departure of Pat Connaughton and Jake Layman
"For being elite at defense in the NBA, I completely agree 100%. If effort was the biggest determinant for someone's ability as a defender, Thanasis and Pat Connaughton would be elite defenders, and as much as I love them both, that's not the case for either.   On the flipside, though, if someone isn't at least a tolerable defender, it's an effort problem more often than not. IQ, size, discipline, athleticism, etc. still totally play a part in getting you there, but for the average NBA-level player, putting in effort on that side is generally going to be enough to at least make you not a total liability on that side. You can see how much of a difference it made with Eric Bledsoe this past season, for instance. He went from 2nd all-defense to a net negative on defense over the span of a single offseason because he just...really didn't care, for lack of a better way to put it."
"I think the bucks will be fine without injury.  Jrue - Donte - Middleton - Bobby - Giannis is amazing lineup if the go small ball. Also they still have lopez, Grayson Allen, pat Connaughton."
That's basically Pat Connaughton. He looks and plays as average as they come. Which is a great player to have.  PS: Planetary Pat can also jump high.
"Yeah, it's more of a Pat Connaughton guy than a RoCo"
"That would be the high-upside risky #16 pick and the D-league throw in, yeah ? Milwaukee's anti-Process picks.  Jrue Holiday, Brooke Lopez, Pat Connaughton and Donte di Vincenzo plus two random old scorers and an offensively limited second round big get you 40 odd wins and into touching distance of #8 in the East."
Pat Connaughton
"I already posted this elsewhere, but it was very obviously the Jazz’s game plan to allow Terrance Mann to shoot all day in that game. Gobert didn’t get abused at all, because the scheme dictated that he stay in the paint, funneling the ball to the least likely individual to lead a 20+ point comeback, Terrance Mann. Nobody has ever had a higher discrepancy between their 35+ point playoff game and their regular season ppg total. That is 100% a fact. The Jazz were just extremely unlucky to be a victim of one of the luckiest and most unlikely performances in NBA history. As an FSU fan, Mann certainly never scored that highly in college and was at like a 21 point high before that. To do that in a playoff game? If you played that game 99 more times, Mann would probably never score that highly again.  He didn’t get abused. The gameplan actually worked as well. But it is comparable to the Bucks only making the ECF because Kevin Durant has clown feet. Just the luck of the draw. Again, go back and watch all those Terrance Mann highlights and watch how much Gobert actually guarded him, not because he can’t but because the Jazz like to have him protect the rim and figured Mann would never go off for 39. It’s less likely than Dellavedova or DiVincenzo or Connaughton or any of those guys scoring 39 in a series clinching playoff game. Think of Pat Connaughton scoring 39 points in a playoff game the Bucks needed to win. Now think of something less likely. Success! You’ve seen it, and it was Terrance Mann having the best game of his life at literally no more necessary a time."

What about Pat Connaughton taking the game-tying 3 with 6 seconds left?
"""Don't watch games"" Pritchard literally averaged 3 points per game on 13 minutes in the playoffs. What games are YOU watching?   Is Tyrese Maxey a scorer because he dropped 6 points per game in the playoffs in fewer minutes? Like is Pat Connaughton a scorer in your expert opinion?   Torrey Craig averaged 4 points on 12 minutes in the playoffs, let's consider him a scorer too.  ""People on this sub gotta learn to stop talking about players they don’t know about."" That's on me I'll keep quiet"
Zach Collins and Pat Connaughton
"He doesn't have to be capable of scoring over Kawhi if he wants to be 12th man on the roster. He only needs to learn how to shoot over, say, Pat Connaughton."
Unfortunately shooting fouls are per the refs choosing. I remember Khris Middleton and Pat Connaughton getting obviously fouled on 3s in several games and no whistle. Refs decide when to send someone to the line
They always say Pat Connaughton is a good baseball player.
Fits right in with the other stereotypical white guy hustle player Pat Connaughton
"You forgot Pat Connaughton. Personally, I don’t really get the Allen trade. Feels redundant."
"We develop players probably better than average. Dame and CJ are both homegrown. Gary Trent, Nic Batum, Pat Connaughton, Will Barton, Ed Davis, Moses Brown etc al. Lots of guys got their starts here."
&gt;for a guy who probably wont play many minutes for Milwaukee.  He's definitely playing a solid amount. At minimum he's better than Pat Connaughton and PJ Tucker from last yr. There are others I suspect he'll be better than this yr on that bench as well he was a starter on a 8 seed he's not some low end rotation player.  Frankly one of the reasons Memphis traded him is he's due an extension and if he really wasnt good enough to get a meaningful amount there's no reason to worry about that.
"To anyone thinking this is hyperbole on the ""so bad"" part, we literally had two players who shot at or above the league average 3P% this season (36.7%) on any significant volume - Pat Connaughton at 38.9% (who was a stud for us all playoffs long) and Bryn Forbes at 37.1% (who is heavily carried in that regard by the Miami series where he shot 48.5% on over 8 shots per game). Everyone else shot at least a couple percentage points below that, and as a team, we shot 32% from 3 during the playoffs.   I don't know how much shooting a couple percentage points better would have actually helped us during our run, but damn would it have made things a little less stressful than they were."
Is he better than Pat Connaughton? Who’s better between them? Cause it’s crazy to see Donte as a starting 5. I just started watching their team recently
Reports are that Guy Who Mows Lawns in the Summer Pat Connaughton stayed after practice for some extra work from deep
Morey is way better than Horst. He is probably the best gm in the league. Won all his trades and created one of the best teams of all-time in the 2018 Rockets with limited assets. He just wasn't lucky due to injuries.      I'll admit that Horst made good moves this season but he was just lucky to win due to major injuries on all contenders. I mean he doesn't even fully understand the cap and contracts that's why the Bucks FO made a mistake on Connaughton's contract (source below) and botched the Bogdonavic trade (confirmed even before the free agency starts lol).   https://nba.nbcsports.com/2020/11/21/bucks-paying-pat-connaughton-more-after-contract-issue/
"We picked him ahead of Norm Powell, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Larry Nance, Josh Richardson, and Pat Connaughton. And now we're trading him for a second rounder *and* uh...some crappy player whose name I already forgot!"
I’m hearing from my league sources that he’s being bought out and will look to sign the taxpayers MLE in Milwaukee to compete with Pat Connaughton for minutes off the bench as a spark plug option.
PER of 11.1 BPM of -0.2. Dude is basically Pat Connaughton in a Lakers jersey.  Every playoff team in the NBA has a player of his calibre on the bench.
"We have their Pat Connaughton, it's only fair"
Pat Connaughton adds shiba inu to complete the shitcoin trifecta
"Lol fr I remember when Crowder got hit in the eye, yeah he might have sold it a bit but getting hit in the eye by pat Connaughton would hurt like a bitch"
"Warriors fans told me how Giannis and Curry are friends. Now I gotta throw the shitty trade takes out too, you think Brook Lopez and Pat Connaughton is a good deal?"
"No, they really don't. People just assume that they do, if you actually watch games you see that people like Danny Green, Pat Connaughton, KCP, Jae Crowder, Joe Harris, etc. all get played off of if they aren't actively hitting their shots."
Like even if the Bucks are having a bad shooting night you still don’t want to leave Khris Middleton or Pat Connaughton wide open unlike guys like Russ
And Pat Connaughton.
Orlando got their Pat Connaughton 🔥
"They hit like six threes a game because they were scoring inside...because the court was so spaced. You don't stop guarding Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Pat Connaughton just because they're cold."
I think what you meant is Pat Connaughton should be on team USA.
"But their role players did step up. Cameron Payne and Cam Johnson played great, it’s a shame Cameron Payne didn’t get played more. Granted Jae crowder did go ice cold in some games, but pat connaughton was as well, so suns legitamelly had chances to put all 3 of those games to bed. DeAndre Ayton did have some poor games but he’s playing against a former all star and a back to back league mvp and a Greek demigod"
"Some underrated picks are Lowry, CP3, Kyrie, OG, and Pat Connaughton"
"Just stop dude, it’s got nothing to do with race.  Pat Connaughton has plenty of fast twitch ability.  Jared Dudley does not."
"Almond joy is the Pat Connaughton of candy, hella underrated. When you least expect it, almond joy ends up saving the day."
Pat Connaughton  Even though he hasn’t played for us in 3+ years.
"They already have the star power though, is Steph/Draymond/Klay not comparable to Giannis/Middleton/Jrue (assuming Klay is healthy)?  And depth absolutely matters a lot. Pat Connaughton was the Buck's 8th Man in terms of MPG in the regular season, but due to injuries and match ups, he ended up playing a key role and the Bucks probably don't win this year without him. Every championship has guys like that who step up and play important roles."
"Paul George easily could, not even a question. There’s role players like Pat Connaughton who were really good players during college, and are significantly better now that might be able to."
"I'm guessing that American Football Quarterbacks and fit baseball players would be about as good as the average NBA player because of throwing accuracy and strength, but the NBA players who used to be Quarterbacks or baseball players would probably be best of all.  In light of that, I would say Donovan Mitchell (elite baseball fielder), Pat Connaughton (elite baseball pitcher), and Jalen Suggs (elite high school quarterback) would be the best.  Jokic can definitely throw and catch from his water polo days, but he's too lumbering.  And gotta include LeBron because of the unusual combination of agility with his size, and we already know he can catch anything."
"Backup center, backup point guard and everyone always needs more shooting.  But we need to find who is available, and it might end up being a Pat Connaughton type who gets cut from their team.  Even assuming Forbes and Portis get paid somewhere else, the core of the team is still there if it's run back, and its easier to find decent backups than starters."
"Middleton got drafted by Detroit, played his rookie season there before getting traded to MIL.   Holiday was traded last year.   Pat Connaughton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis was a free agent signing."
"I know that was a ""ha ha"" type of comment, but...yeah, a lot of people recognize many of those things. Everyone realizes the Raptors won the Finals because of the massive injuries to GS. I don't know why people throw fits about the Suns having a fortunate road to the Finals. Since going down 1-2 vs the Lakers in the first round, they played like five seconds vs AD, zero minutes vs Kawhi and zero minutes vs Murray. Anyone who refuses to acknowledge that is an idiot. Point, blank, period.  Also, there's levels to the shit. Not a single fucking person would have blamed the Bucks losing the Finals if, say, Pat Connaughton was injured. KD AND Klay getting injured? Yeah, injuries that 100% impacted the outcome of the Finals.  And what's funny is that, in your attempt at being ""smart,"" you...actually helped point out why people bring up the Suns vs injured teams thing.  Though some of the statements you made were obviously stupid (the Bucks had a cakewalk vs the Nets? Lol. They were literally inches away from losing) to try to fail to make your point, everyone outside of Houston thinks the Rockets won those two titles because of MJ only playing a few games those two seasons combined. Everyone thinks the '04 Pistons won because of the Lakers imploding. Same for the Mavs title vs the Heat. And guess what? If Giannis wasn't an alien and didn't come back after the injury where a source close to Giannis - Giannis - said he thought he'd be out for a year, then both the Suns winning the Finals and the Hawks making the Finals would be remembered for Giannis getting injured."
"You are very wrong, they got a MVP Superstar in Giannis, Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday are All-Stars level players, Brook Lopez and PJ Tucker are excellent role players. Align with that Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton and Bryn Forbes who are decent role players.  It is very difficult to make a team as deep as that. Most of the teams that have 1 or more superstars, don\`t have a bench as good and tall as Milwaukee.  And they got lucky their biggest opponent is this playoff, who was Brooklyn, 2 of their 3 best players got injured..."
They had 8 legitimate contributors on that Mavs squad whereas this Bucks team was struggling to find a second bench wing after Pat Connaughton and crossing their fingers they could survive the 9 Jeff Teague minutes every game.  I'd put the Mavs in the same category (although far less to the extreme of) the '14 Spurs where the roles were so perfectly defined and each player fit the role so well. Obviously '11 Dirk was better than any individual Spur in '14 and those Spurs each passed the ball well in their own individual rights. But a lot of people trash the other Mavs to prop up Dirk just like theyre clowning Isiah for clowning Dirk to prop up Giannis
"Brook's good, but he ain't that good.    We didn't get George Hill until we were over 1/4 of the way into the season, and were already 16-7 with Delly as our backup PG for many of the those games.    And we replaced Jabari's minutes with Pat Connaughton/Ersan Ilyasova/Thon Maker/etc.  If you want to pretend those player changes come anywhere close to taking a team that was fighting to get into the playoffs, to the team with the best record in the league, you can go on right ahead and continue being delusional."
We got CJ! Outside shooter who can create his own shot. But he’s 6’3 and bad at defense.  Best we can do is Robin Lopez for 2 years.  Blazers legend Pat Connaughton   Rockets legend RoCo is the best comparison I can do here.  This whole list is *pain*.
" Because his team didn't start with Khris Middleton, an outside shooter who can also create his own shot.  Because his team didn't get Brook Lopez for free, and turn him into an elite stretch 5.  Because his team didn't get a solid contributor in Pat Connaughton for free.  And thats before they became a KD shoe size away from brutally overpaying for PJ Tucker and Jrue Holiday."
"It wasn't just Giannis.  It was paying Khris Middleton a max.  It was signing Brook Lopez when he was fired by Los Angeles, and then giving him a raise.  It was acquiring Pat Connaughton for nothing. It was acquiring Bobby Portis.   It was drafting Done Di Vincenzo, and it was getting rid of Thon Maker when he turned into what people thought Giannis would become.  It was backing up the truck for Eric Blesoe, and then backing it up again for Jrue Holliday.  Just Giannis doesn't win a chip."
"The opposite of this is teams like the Cavs when lebron was young, the pelicans with AD, etc who simply didn't want to spend the money or couldn't acquire good enough talent to give them chances to win. But in this situation, the bucks were 100% amazing in their ability to build a team from nothing to champion. Taking a chance on a raw athlete who didn't start playing basketball till he was 12, trade Brandon Jennings for a 2nd rounder who was in the g league and the pistons thought wasn't good enough, sit back and let them develop, make smart moves like signing Brook Lopez, drafting donte divencenzo, signing pat connaughton, trading for pj tucker, going all in and trading away 3 frp and Eric bledsoe for jrue holiday. They did it well and did it right, something alot of owners aren't willing to dig into to get that chip"
Pat Connaughton averaged more points in this series (as did 4 other Bucks) than “Super team member” Kevin Love did in 2016 in the finals. Last year Rondo/KCP were the 3rd/4th best players. Such a shit narrative lol
I’ve been watching Pat Connaughton since he was at ND and he’s always been so incredibly athletic.
"Pat Connaughton, now that's a haircut you could set a watch to"
"Was his team really built in a different way than other “super teams” though?  Signed Brook Lopez in FA  Traded 5 firsts for Jrue Holiday  Traded a first for PJ Tucker  Signed Bobby Portis in FA  Signed Pat Connaughton in FA   Particularly the Holiday trade, like that’s exactly what building a super team looks like, even if Holiday isn’t necessarily at the same level as other stars who normally get a haul like that"
"Pat Connaughton in the drive thru right behind Giannis: Can I have a 0 piece? Not 1, not 2, but 0 piece chicken minis."
Pat Connaughton really outplayed Joe Harris in the playoffs huh
Look at the jerseys the Bucks have retired bro. This org was so thirsty to celebrate anything for so long we put like half of our first championship roster up in  the rafters. One of the Bucks podcasts has been arguing for Pat Connaughton to get his jersey retired (mostly in jest) because that's the kinda players that get their number retired on the Bucks (if they win a ring).
\*7 Don't forget about Pat fucking Connaughton
"What’s funny is they really underperformed as a spacing team. They shot 4% below their regular season 3pt% average, with Khris seeing a drop down to 35.6% and Lopez all the way down at 23.8%. The guys who kept their shooting together ended up being Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton."
All I hear is shade towards Jeff Teague and Pat Connaughton and that big 3 right there.
"These last 3 years really saw a lot of growth to his game. Bud opening up the offense helped him a lot. Play random, Bench mob legend Pat Connaughton. He was clutch this whole playoff run too and our best 3pt shooting specialist. Sometimes he was the critical link between Giannis and Khris on the court. He was also effective cutting to the basket creating movement, staying random lol. Defense was actually a bit above average too, he played for more MPG than a lot of us were expecting mostly because he stopped jumping at pump fakes (he still did this series, but he ALSO stuffed Ayton at the rim at least once), he was also our best offensive rebounding guard and I recall him getting many tough rebounds where he was surrounded.   &amp;#x200B;  Crazy to imagine at the time, but the chemistry with Giannis he developed these past 3 years was a key component to our postseason run. Plus Pat's continued development. He earned this ring for sure."
What i really need are some Pat Connaughton lowlights. He played one of the worst games i've ever seen.
"Happy that the Bucks won, and also for Pat Connaughton. Where would they be without his 8 rebounds and 0 points in 22 minutes. Him drawing those FTs in the clutch brought a tear to my eye."
Or maybe he should have just joined the fucking Warriors after he lost in 2017 like KD did.  Or joined the Spurs when they beat him. Guaranteed championship. Or the Celtics when they beat him. Guaranteed championship. Or the Magic when they beat him. Guaranteed championship.  You replace Kevin Durant with Pat Connaughton on those Warriors teams and they still win both titles.

"Jrue Holiday: 3-16  Pat Connaughton:  0-3, +/- of -22  Jeff Teague: actually saw the floor, +/- of - 5 in under 2 minutes played  but talk to me about the refs some more."
"Pat Connaughton -22 in a tie game, ouch"
Pat Connaughton needs to sit for the 4th. He’s been fucking terrible
Pat Connaughton is -18 when his team is up 2... why is he still on the floor
"Joel Embiid is in the Giannis superstar class. He's a different sort of player, but if you took the gang of useless scrubs Joel has and put them around Giannis, then he also bounces out in the playoffs.  Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, PJ Tucker, Bobby Portis, Donte diVincenzo and  Pat Connaughton backing up Joel ? And Brook Lopez on the bench for when Joel needs to sit down ? Yeah, I can see them winning a championship."

"That Mavs roster was low key stacked with great veterans and future hall of famers lol from top to bottom they were a very talented team.   Other then Bobby Portis and I guess Pat Connaughton, the Bucks bench was pretty bad. They really didn't have much depth at all."
If he was actually smart he’d be pulling a Pat Connaughton and developing condos and shit for regularish people.   The money in real estate corresponds with the amount of real demand. The ultra high end market doesn’t have the same pool to draw from as standard luxury or high end housing.
PJ Tucker and Pat Connaughton also feel disrespected.
Pat Connaughton is the GOAT whether you like it or not
"&gt;I feel like more people should know he has a 44 inch vert  There's a story out there that that measurement was an error.  Vertical leap is measured as a difference between a player's performance on the Vertec device and his standing reach.    Pat Connaughton's standing reach was listed at the combine at 8'0"".  There is no way that Pat Connaughton's standing reach is actually 8'0"".  Pat Connaughton was listed at 6'4"" without shoes with a 6'8"" wingspan.  Players who have similar measurements have standing reach in the 8'4"" to 8'6"" range.  TJ Connell listed at 6'0.5"" without shoes with a 6'2"" wingspan had a 8'0.5"" standing reach.  There is no way that TJ Connell has a higher standing reach than Pat Connaughton.  There's a chance that Pat Connaughton's real vertical leap at the combine was closer to 38-40 inches which is still excellent but not as eye popping as 44 inches.  [2015 Draft Combine Anthrometric](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?SeasonYear=2015-16&amp;sort=PLAYER_NAME&amp;dir=-1)"
"Totally agree with ya. 2k should atleast give him a 93. He was the real difference maker in both the Nets and Suns series. Infact, NBA should change the logo to Pat Connaughton as a reminder to how good he was in the playoffs.  There you go, I did it. He is no longer underrated. You can post another thread tomorrow asking if he is overrated. Glad I helped!"
Looney already shown he is a rotation player on a championship squad. Pat Connaughton and Jeff Teague (lol) played meaningful minutes off the bench for the Bucks during last year’s championship run. Poole Oubre Batum are vastly superior players.
"That type of physical talent isn't as rare as you might think. The 2015 draft, for example, had at least 3 guys who were 6'5"" or taller in shoes who also had 43"" or better verticals according to the combine (Justin Anderson, Brandon Sampson, Pat Connaughton).   People like Vince who turn that talent into NBA All-Star production have a lot more ambition then people think, and deserve more respect."
Pat Connaughton has more rings than Harden
you realize there are teams out here winning rings with 23 minutes each of pat connaughton and donte divicenzo every night? cry me a river. Lakers
"I think it’s overrated as is tbh. One thing to coach it, another to have the personnel. When you get into playoff basketball you have the best players in the world that will work defenses around constantly to go at the weakest link. How many teams have 5 above average, switchable defenders? Not very many. In theory it’s a great idea but at a certain point you have Pat Connaughton on an island vs KD and you’re not having a very fun time."
"Starters   PG Jrue   SG Grayson Allen  SF Middleton  PF Giannis   C BroLo   6th Bobby Portis   7th Divincenzo   8th Pat Connaughton   9th George Hill   10th Semi/Rodney Hood/Nwora  Situational Thanasis   Benchwarmers Mamu, Giorgos K  My thinking on Allen over Donte is offensive consistency and availability at the start of the year."
"Dear Dumbass.  Have a think about the Bucks without Brook Lopez, PJ Tucker, Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis.  To quote some Daryl Morey or other, the scarce resource in the NBA is not the star player, it is the undervalued player.  And Ben Simmons is being paid a max."
Pat Connaughton
"Not as consistently but brook lopez, Jrue at times and guys like PJ tucker, pat connaughton weren't bad from three. So I don't its just middleton"
I just asked why he asked it because it came out of no where and said it so accusingly. Gtfo of here lol. And what does racism have to do with pat connaughton? You’re a walking Reddit moment and probably about 16 years old. Stop wasting my time.
"Bruh you get personally offended when some dude said “remember slavery exists” while rocking a Steve Novak flair, and then wanna change it to Pat Connaughton 💀. If you were a troll I’d be telling you that your shtick is too heavy handed."
Pat Connaughton. Lol.
Pat Connaughton knows what just happened
Pat “Jesse Pinkman” Connaughton.
Pat “Billy Hoyle” Connaughton
Pat Connaughton
"They've had comparable rosters, outside of khris Middleton on Jrue this year everyone has been a role players/journeymen   Eric bledsoe,Bryn Forbes,sterling brown, pat connaughton, brook lopez,bobby Portis,George hill and a bunch of other people who either aren't in the league or deep bench players"
Pat “White Flight” Connaughton
"Here is my quick attempt off the top of my head,  *Sabonis does not count even though he is American born. He represents Lithuania internationally and clearly has embraced that culture, his dad was just playing in the States when he was born.  1st Team  Tyler Herro- Joe Harris- Duncan Robinson- Gordon Hayward- Brook Lopez  2nd Team  Alex Caruso- Kevin Huerter- Pat Connaughton- Kevin Love- Cody Zeller  3rd Team  TJ McConnell- JJ Redick- Doug McDermott- Zach Collins- Mason Plumlee or Frank Kaminsky  The issue is that there are much better guards than forwards and especially centers. I feel like Donte is probably better than JJ at this point, but I gave Redick the legacy choice."
"Yeah you are tripping lol. Sure people have higher pure vertical jump/sprint time measures than Russ, but I don’t know how that would make him “overrated” as an athlete.  Just because you test high on a vertical test doesn’t mean it translates on the court. Unless you are on a wide open fastbreak you never get the same ideal jump conditions that you get on the vert test. Would you say Pat Connaughton is more athletic than Westbrook?  The way (younger) Westbrook was able to control/contort his body and jump explosively in traffic was what made him special. Also the way he was able to generate so much power in a short amount of time and/or while dribbling is what led to all the highlight plays where he can show off that speed and power.  In the early 2010s I’d say the only people that had an argument for the best athlete were LeBron, Rose, Wall, Westbrook and Blake. I’m probably forgetting someone tho."
Pat Connaughton played minor league ball before going back for basketball.
"It's not just Jrue out, Lopez missing is really big and especially when Bobby only *just* came back for limited minutes against the Timberwolves. Donte's still out, so the team is down 3 starters right now.  Pat Connaughton was being listed as our starting centre for multiple games."
"they have both Donte DiVincenzo and Pat Connaughton, it should be enough for them lol"
It's pretty funny how the box score lists Pat Connaughton as a center.
Pat Connaughton is the starting C??
3 All-NBA players just to lose to the Pat Connaughton Posse
"The depth of this Bucks team is *so* much better than it was last season, without giving up anything in the starting five. Yes, PJ is a loss - but Pat Connaughton appears to have taken a huge leap, Nwora has taken a huge leap, Thanasis has taken a leap, one of Grayson Allen/Donte will come off the bench, and - I cannot stress this enough - we have George Hill instead of Jeff Teague as a back-up PG."
Yeah Pat Connaughton is super valuable to this team
"I do, but it's not a given or something I'm necessarily expecting to happen. If Kyrie comes back it gets way more difficult and I'm worried about the Clippers and Jazz in the West.  I like the chances to repeat because it's the same team, but with better depth (George Hill &gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff Teague, and one of Grayson Allen/Donte will be coming off the bench). I'm being cautious and more games are needed to see, but Pat Connaughton genuinely looks like he's improved a lot. As in, he could pick up some 6MOY votes."
Pat Connaughton has really gone from “why did you give him that contract” to one of the biggest underpays in the league
Actually if you look at the boxscore I think you'll find that Pat Connaughton was our centre.
"Shout out for Doug McDermott for choosing to miss in the 4th so the Bucks could win, as well as the revolving door of Spurs players hitting ridiculous contested layups over starting centre Pat Connaughton.  Nonetheless, it feels good to be up 2-0 on the season."
"I would like a Centre, please. No, not Pat Connaughton, a real one."
"Good rim defence there by our new starting center, Pat Connaughton."
If Pat Connaughton is starting at center than yes
Pat Connaughton was listed as Center tonight for the Bucks.
Lmao the game thread has Pat Connaughton as the Bucks starting center
30 minutes of Pat Connaughton at the 5 please.
"The main thing in vogue right now is Jordan Nwora; how much has he improved, how many minutes will he be playing, when can he be extended, can he work with Giannis/Khris/Jrue?  You'd think we'd talk a bit more about Giannis but generally it's taboo to discuss Fr** Th****.  Edit: Forgot Pat Connaughton 6MOY odds."
Imagine rooting for an NBA team that doesn't employ Pat Connaughton
TIL pat connaughton is irish
Pat Connaughton was Caruso before Caruso was Caruso
"Nobody said he had to outplay Giannis and that's not even the conversation we're having here, do you want us to compare their number to see for yourself why?  He said he was the defensive anchor of a finals team but that was his job defensively in the finals, to contain Giannis - was he successful? I mean, Bam didn't outplay Giannis either but HE DID contain him.  \+24 per 100, 20 games sample size - so meaningful. Cam and Saric were +20 and +14, should the Suns also max them? Oh and Pat Connaughton had the best net rating for the Bucks, +20. Another max contact there, while that scrub Middleton had a net rating of +3 and Jrue +10."
"Bucks with Nwora averaging 19/6/2 repeat  Jrue, Khris, Nwora, Giannis, Lopez starting lineup  Divincenzo, Grayson Allen, Portis, and Nwora (if you don't have him starting) could all be 6MotY contenders, with the rest of the bench filled out by George Hill, Pat Connaughton, Thanasis, and whoever else. Really hoping Mamukelashvili can develop for them, he was a solid scorer in college as a 6'11"" stretch big, if he can carve out the backup center roll this team could beat anyone. Team would be deeper than deep. Hell even if Nwora was averaging like 14/4/1 they'd be solid."
"Bogdanovic trade fuck up, not matching Malcolm Brogdon, fucking up the Pat Connaughton contract, DJ Augustin contract even though that worked out,"
"The jury is still out on that, no one can say whether it hurts the team yet. He provided absolutely nothing on offense which put the Bucks in the position of relying on Pat Connaughton having a series-long outlier shooting performance. There's a very good chance that improving his minutes offensively will more than offset the loss of his defense which was, frankly, overrated although inspiring."
"Man if he could solidify himself as the third scoring option for the Bucks they would be wild. I know Per 36s are fucked but he put up 22.5/8/1/2/1 last year on 46/45(!)/76.  A starting lineup of Jrue, Donte, Khris, Giannis, and Lopez with a bench unit of George Hill, Grayson Allen, Nwora, Thanasis, Rodney Hood, Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton, and the rest of the guys could be pretty wild. Crazy strong secondary, not to mention a crazy *crazy* secondary."
"For some reason some people think being the best player somehow also means you're the most athletic, or that being athletic in and of itself can make you great without skills, like when people say Lebron is the best athlete in the history of the NBA. Lebron is a super-athlete, but there are a handful of super-athletes in the draft every year. If we just take vertical leap as one objective measure, the 2016 draft by itself had like 3 or 4 guys with 43"" verticals (one of them was Pat Connaughton IIRC). Ricky Davis had the highest vertical in the NBA for several years. A player's intelligence and work ethic to let them be able to develop and use that athletic ability is much more important."
Sign me up for a Bobby Portis / Pat Connaughton buddy movie franchise
"Dont forget Alex Caruso, Nikola vucevic, and pat connaughton"
Hes a real glue guy! He reminds me of matthew dellavedova and pat connaughton he's very scrappy and he works hard out there! Last to leave the gym first to arrive!
"Here’s a brief rundown of some of the current defending champions’ moves since they drafted their franchise player -   - Traded JJ Redick for two seconds because he was going to leave.   - Traded Ish Smith for Caron Butler. Ish has been a capable backup PG ever since, Butler played half a season off the bench and dipped.   - Drafted Jabari Parker over Embiid.   - Brought in Jason Kidd as coach. Even traded two 2nds for the privilege (fun fact: one of those 2nds later became Pat Connaughton).   - Traded for Caron Butler *again*, this time giving up capable backup Ersan Ilyasova. Immediately waived him.   - Drafted Rashad Vaughn in the first round.   - Same draft, traded a just-drafted Norman Powell and a future first that became OG Anunoby for Greivis Vasquez.   - Paid Greg Monroe $34m to be mediocre for two years.   - Shipped his ass to the Suns with a first rounder attached for HOF choke artist Eric Bledsoe.   - Drafted Thon Maker in the first round.   - Handed out terrible contracts to Delly, Tony Snell, John Henson *and* Miles Plumlee all in the space of two years.   - Got out of jail by managing to shift the Plumlee contract for scraps and sending Delly back to Cleveland along with Henson as salary filler but did have to give up a first to move Snell’s deal. That first became Kevin Porter Jr.   - Drafted DJ Wilson in the first round.   - Let Christian Wood leave for nothing.   - Traded four second rounders and Thon Maker for Nikola Mirotic, who proceeded to make playoff Bledsoe look like prime LeBron then dipped to Spain.   - Traded Malcolm Brogdon for a first and second because they didn’t want to pay him $80m.   - Traded every first round pick they could to the Pelicans to get a playable guard because the one they’d just given $50m to was awful and they traded the other one away.    You’d be surprised how much you can fuck things up and still contend. We only sucked for one year through all of that and we sure as hell weren’t gaining assets for it."
"Current Favorites: Kyle Lowry, KD, James Harden  All-Time Favorites: Dirk, Kobe  Current Least Favorite: Pat Bev, Pat Connaughton  All-Time Least Favorite: Paul Pierce"
"You have to bring up the other side of the coin because defense is half the game of basketball.   Trae and Luka aren’t great defenders either, that’s correct. Although, they are the leaders of their teams so they’ve had strong defensive players placed around them that DEN can’t do as naturally with offensive dynamos Jokic and Murray. And in Trae’s case specifically, he’s a PG so he isn’t typically matched up one-on-one with the opposing team’s best player as Luka and MPJ would be more often.  I also think we as fans have a tendency to overrate the defense of our own players. Bad defenders become okay “team defenders” that are making strides and just need a couple tweaks, when the reality is they’re just bad defenders. Even on the Bucks heading into the playoffs last year, I heard arguments for guys like Bryn Forbes, Pat Connaughton, and Bobby Portis being serviceable on that end, when frankly, they were major liabilities for stretches. If MPJ truly can become a neutral defender that would be huge for the Nuggets progression, I’m just not sure how likely it is."
PJ Tucker. Pat Connaughton. Brook Lopez.
"My pleasure. You did all the hard work, I'm just here for the up-toots.   Total attempts is a pretty big part of the picture, especially with the LA fans gushing about Howards 7 total attempts. Do we tell them that Mills hit 10 in a row to start the season?  OP u/johnhenryirons did a list for 100+ attempts,  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
issa joke and as a black man i want to see pat connaughton get his dunks off
"very impressive. posted in another comment, but the top 10 if you went to 100+ attempts as a minimum on the season, it weeds out a lot of people and the list looks like this instead:  Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
"KAT has attempted more than 100 as well. The list of players who have attempted 100 or more is WAY too small this early in the season. If you did 100 or more attempts though, these would be top 10:     Patty Mills   Lonzo Ball   Karl-Anthony Towns   Mike Conley   Stephen Curry   Carmelo Anthony   Grayson Allen   Seth Curry   Pat Connaughton   Devin Booker"
League moderately inconvienced.   But seriously we literally needed another big so badly. There were points in this season where we started Pat Connaughton at Center.
ESPN: Breaking News-- Pat Connaughton is not thankful for his family
You're right on. Portland let Pat go the summer they extended GTR and signed Seth Curry. The Blazers didn't have any minutes available for Connaughton unfortunately
"Pat Connaughton seems like one of the more underrated players. Just a solid two way guy, who was pretty big in the Finals run"
"Nah, it’s rather a frowned upon move because the general consensus is that you want to bring a guy like PJ Tucker back after how much you relied on him thru the championship run.  He was great for them against Heat and Nets. He was instrumental in that he unlocked Giannis at the 5 and let Bucks play a more switchable defense. That is crucial and they miss that this year. Bobby Portis won’t see the floor against certain match up and he def didn’t see the floor against the Nets. Same if you go down the line of Pat Connaughton, Jordan Nwora, Semi Ojeleye… those guys can’t provide what Tucker brought"
"Pat Connaughton ftw. Doubled his PPG and doing absolutely everything.   Unbiased take, probably Miles Bridges. Admittedly haven't been following the rest of the league super xlosely"
"Imagine getting to have Grayson Allen, Bobby Portis, *and* Pat Connaughton as players on your basketball team."
"Pat Connaughton has been amazing so far this season, and was big in the championship run so they'd definitely keep him - especially since his contract is currently team-friendly. I think I miscounted and they could keep their current starting five, Lopez, Connaughton and Donte - but Donte's still a question mark depending on how soon he'll be able to play again."
Pat Connaughton had to carry Giannis to a chip smh
Pat Connaughton? He’s the leading scorer
Pat Connaughton and Grayson Allen are both on such low contracts for what they contribute  &amp;#x200B;  Absolute steals by Horst
For those keeping track that was;  * Pat Connaughton clamps Okeke  * Pat Connaughton drives and gets a high off the glass layup  * Pat Connaughton gets a steal  * Pat Connaughton sinks a 3  All in consecutive possessions.
"Unbiased opinion Jokic, biased opinion Pat Connaughton"
"someone on the Rockets is bound to have a career game against us lmao, don't count yourselves out yet    If you wondering who went off on us during our losses, it was OG/GTJ against Toronto, Terrence Ross on fire TWICE against Orlando as basically Curry-lite, Myles Turner having a career night from 3 with the Pacers, Rubio scoring a career high 37 points on us on 8/9 shooting from 3 and Mobley scoring a career high 26 points, &amp; Pat Connaughton with a near career high of 23 points  Imma bet either Jalen Green or Sengun (if he gets a lot of minutes) will go off on us especially with KPJ out"
"The potential interesting thread here for neutrals/casuals is what happens when DiVincenzo gets back. Donte is the incumbent starter but Grayson has been balling his ass off and we couldn’t reasonably remove him from that starting spot, so Donte will probably be coming off the bench.   Given Grayson already signed a two year extension and Donte is heading to RFA in the off-season coupled with Pat Connaughton also playing really well since last year’s playoffs, we’ve got some interesting decisions to make."
Pat Connaughton needs to get a new haircut
"Shoutout to Pat Connaughton, man. Dude used to be trash but not anymore."
Pat Connaughton
"Giannis playing center and the whole team make up looks like the AD- Jrue Pelicans   We got 3 guards in the starting line up, couple of SF/ PF guy that really provides nothing, some undersize wing playing at the 3. A stretch 4 next to Giannis playing C  So Jrue playing Jrue role Giannis doing everything on both ends like AD did George Hill playing the Tim Frazier role Grayson Allen playing the Eric Gordon role Pat Connaughton playing Dante Cunningham  Bobby Portis playing Nikola Mirotic   It’s just not very good."
"Look the footwork of Mobley is amazing and everything, but I’m pretty sure I saw Tatum airball a 3 with Pat Connaughton defending him yesterday lmao"

"After Kawhi left I was telling everyone “it’s ok, if we sign Pat Connaughton we’re still gonna repeat.”  And then we didn’t sign him and we didn’t repeat. So the math checks out."
That’s a good point. Pat Connaughton would probably have multiple rings by now if it wasn’t for Giannis holding him back.
"You could say that about every role player ever. Pat Connaughton wouldn’t have a ring without Giannis, Mo Speights wouldn’t have a ring without Curry, Shane Battier wouldn’t have a ring without LeBron, etc etc. Obviously they’re right, I just don’t see the point in stating the obvious. Obviously Kuzma is a role player who cannot lead a team to a championship, what’s the point of telling him that?"
I said it in the gamethread but Pat Connaughton is the Bucks' version of Max Kellermans' idea of Iguodala.
"I'm convinced that Khris isn't out with covid, but instead his soul has been consumed by Pat Connaughton, and this is the result."
At least getting owned by Pat Connaughton is a funny way to lose.

I feel like Pat Connaughton is the Bucks version of Max Kellermans' Iguodala.
"&gt;Jaylen Brown can shoot and is willing to shoot, that alone makes him more valuable in the playoffs than Ben Simmons.   This is a little extreme, no? Or are you saying you'd rather have guys like Campazzo, Pat Connaughton, or Landry Shamet than Simmons?  &gt;I'm not sure how anyone who's watched Ben Simmons play in his past 3 playoff series can even say he's better than Brown.  This I'd agree with, there's really no argument at this point"
"Meh no Middleton, no Lopez. The one that hurts is a lack of Middleton. Once all the starters are back Milwaukee is going on a run. Grayson Allen is a clear upgrade from a guy like Brynn Forbes. Still have the serial killer duo in Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis Jr. When Allen is more of the 6th or 7th guy in the rotation because the team has Middleton back and George Hill is confined to stand in the corner like a PJ Tucker with no defense, that’s when Milwaukee is back"
All of them. Have had about 2 games with more than 2 starters. C duties are shared between Thanasis and Pat Connaughton (this is only either the 2nd or 3rd game where Portis has been back).
AD is a top 10 player in the same way Pat Connaughton is a top 10 player - he's not.
"We are really out here starting George Hill, Thanasis, Grayson Allen and Pat Connaughton. The only reason we are at all competitive is Giannis being the best player in the world."
We're actually moving closer to a lineup with:  Pat Connaughton  Thanasis Antetokounmpo  Georgios Kalaitzakis  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Sandro Mamukelashvili  And that doesn't even include Donte DiVincenzo. Has anyone seen this lineup play in its entirety? Have they gotten 4 out of 5 of these guys?
Pat Connaughton is my rock.
"I'm guessing George Hill/Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora/Thanasis Antetokounmpo/Bobby Portis. Portis is likely still on limited minutes, so yeah Sandro Mamukelashvili may see some bigger minutes."
"Giannis/Grayson/Hood are all on the injury list for this game, but only as probable.  In seriousness, if those 'probables' don't play, here my attempt at a possible depth chart;  PG: George Hill/Justin Robinson/Thanasis Antetokounmpo  SG: Pat Connaughton/Jordan Nwora  SF: Jordan Nwora/Pat Connaughton/Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Georgios Kalaitzakis  PF: Thanasis Antetokoumpo/Semi Ojeleye/Sandro Mamukelashvili  C: Bobby Portis/Sandro Mamukelashvili"
"There was a point in the game the other night where the Bucks local announcer said something like ""in this lineup they're gonna have to look to Pat Connaughton for scoring"" and I was just like ""damn"""
"Yeah no disrespect but that’s just too much of a narrow-minded view of athleticism. The draft combine data from MJ’s era isn’t even available, but that’s besides the point. Saying I can’t prove that MJ had better coordination, explosiveness/power or second jump ability than Pat Connaughton because it’s not measured doesn’t make sense to me. It’s not that it’s unmeasurable, there’s just no need to measure everything in basketball like they do in track and field.  When Zion was coming into the league, scouts &amp; analysts raved about his elite second jump ability. Were these claims baseless because Zion didn’t complete a test to measure it?  Derrick Rose never did any of the draft combine tests (sprint, lane agility, vert), so we can’t say he was faster or more explosive than Pat Connaughton? Because it wasn’t measured?"
"Your answer to the Pat Connaughton argument was actually really bad but I was being polite. You just tried to handwave it away and try to claim there were other things with no evidence of it. There are actually other measurables where you can find plenty of guys that had that talent too. And multiples together. You can only claim unmeasurables as a way to duck the question.  If not, then give me actual numbers like I gave you. I have an entire spreadsheet of hundreds of measurements from the NBA draft combine over years, so I can give you plenty more on my end."
"Yeah Nate’s definitely up there among best athletes to play in the league, which is a way better argument than the Pat Connaughton one the other user tried to make imo.  But still I’d have to say Nate isn’t the full package the MJ was. Like no one else had the coordination, balance and core strength to glide in the air like he did. And MJ being 3/4 of a foot taller than Nate is what makes his athleticism even more impressive imo. He moved like a gymnast in the air and a running back in the open court. All while being 6’6."
"There are a lot more insane athletes in the NBA than people realize. Pat Connaughton has a 44-inch vertical leap, and there were several other guys in that draft class who did at the same size. Just for one example."
"Pat Connaughton needed a break, to be fair."
"&gt;You truly genuinely think that had all your player been healthy they would have brought enough to make for the 43 point difference.   Yes. Dude Pat Connaughton was our starting center. We are missing 4 of our 6 best players.   Like what do you believe the score would be if the Heat were missing Lowry, Hero, Robinson and Bam while we had our full lineup?"
"I think the main problem is when Giannis plays the C, they need a competent PF to fill in. Portis is exactly that, and so was PJ. Semi Ojeleye/Pat Connaughton/Khris Middleton at the 4 however..."
&gt; Not having Jrue Holiday is certainly a big part of the slowish start  We have two of our starters! Pat Connaughton has been our starting Centre for three games and Thanasis for one! When Giannis isn't on the floor our tallest player was fucking 6'7! An undrafted two-way player has been playing 15 minutes a game! I *wish* it was just Jrue who was unavailable.
"Completely based on if Bud is out coached or not. If we get beat but he’s trying to adjust he’s safe, if he’s stubborn and tries to guard Harden with Pat Connaughton he’s gone."
pat connaughton
I think everyone in the Bucks threes are going in when they shoot except for Brook and Pat Connaughton.
"&gt; The team would have a future if he didn’t choke in 2019  Yeah, that would make Jrue, Brook and Middleton 5 years younger plus Donte look like a promising young player instead of a glorified Pat Connaughton, amirite?"
Hawks in 7. With how bad Jrue and Khris been the Bucks will need Brook Lopez or Pat Connaughton to score 15-20
And two games in a row now where he's mistaken Pat Connaughton for Brook fucking Lopez.
I feel like Pat Connaughton must have the most ariballed 3s
"I'm not saying the Hawks were definitely going to win, but I don't think it's fair to say the Bucks lost because Giannis got hurt. He wasn't hurt game 1 and the Hawks were in control game 4. When he got hurt the doors fell off. If Giannis is out they have no shot at winning but with him healthy it wasn't a for sure win either.   Serious question, why does Pat Connaughton get so many minutes? I feel like him and Pat Tucker play the same role."
Even the Hawks take isn't good.  Lou Williams is an awful individual defender just as Trae is.  Neither of them are making a difference guarding PJ Tucker and Pat Connaughton
"I wonder if Pat Connaughton has a GOAT mode, because the Bucks are gonna need it from here on out."
why put Pat Connaughton on the floor  his teammates aren't even confident to pass him the ball  is he the coach's son
In an alternate universe I would get to see the true stars of the league Ben Simmons vs Pat Connaughton.
Yet again I must remind everyone of how much I envy Pat Connaughton   Five million a year to play 20 minutes a game and hit a couple shots and grab a few rebounds   On the same team as Giannis   Fat cock
I've counted Pat Connaughton bite on at least 5 pump fakes so far. Dude loves selling out for 3 pointers
Pat Connaughton has been very important on both ends for the Bucks so far this series
"&gt; He is the definition of a winning role player.  I think that is very true, but he is not someone you can pay much more than what he is being paid. Especially with his health issues.  If he can stay healthy, I would give him a Pat Connaughton level deal."
And they have honorary Blazer Pat Connaughton
"I think they misspoke and said it was his last game rather than the last series.  In many ways, it was a fitting tribute to the man who called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez."
cool to see Pat Connaughton getting some of that insurance commercial money
That’s the average salary after adding Pat Connaughton to their roster
Pat connaughton
pat connaughton
The disrespect to superstar Pat Connaughton.
He called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez 😂😂😂
He called Pat Connaughton Brook Lopez at one point
Thats a foul on Lopez! - Marv.  It appears it was on Pat Connaughton - Marv  Like what?
Pat +25 Connaughton?  He's been giving good minutes
Pat (+25) Connaughton must have been on the court at the right times
"Pat Connaughton the +/- God.    5 pts, +25 lol"
Lmao Pat Connaughton doing everything out there
"Pat ""The Floor Dry"" Connaughton"
Pat connaughton does it all
Obligatory Pat Connaughton beat my team 80-13 in middle school
"Bad officiating aside, holy fuck Pat Connaughton just seems to get more athletic as he gets older"
One of the reasons I think this Hawks team can win it all despite lacking the star power of your typical champion. They legitimately have 8 guys that can hurt you. The Bucks #1 bench guy is Pat Connaughton
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2465204-pat-connaughton-posts-44-inch-max-vertical-leap-at-2015-nba-combine one of the greatest jumpers in the world lmao
"Coach Bud, Middleton, and Pat Connaughton for Dame. Who says no?"
"Imagine being Pat Connaughton  You’re expected to give the Bucks 20 minutes, hit a couple shots, grab a few rebounds  And you get five million a year  Must be nice"
Marv keeps topping himself somehow. He just called Pat Connaughton Lopez!
"Pat Connaughton should not be playing in the playoffs, that dude is garbage."
People act like you guys should be running your offense through Pat connaughton and PJ just because Trae guards them. That’s a horrible idea and your offense has been good enough there’s absolutely no reason to take the ball out of Giannis/Middleton/Holiday’s hands. Sure you can hunt for a switch onto Trae but Trae is actually pretty good at showing and then getting back to his man
Pat connaughton is the real playoff p
With Pat Connaughton winning the final MVP.
"Even better, ignoring the call right in front of them *while watching crystal clear, slow-mo replay of the play.*  For example, the ""illegal screen"" Coach Bud challenged while up by 40, just out of principle, because a Hawks player literally pushed Pat Connaughton into the ""victim"" of the foul.  And Scott Foster and his flunkies can stand there and watch the replay 10 times, and still not change the call."
this series should be decided by a pat connaughton tony snell game of 1 on 1. first to 11 wins
"*Ref calls foul on Bucks after Pat Connaughton is clubbed in the knee by Hawks assistant*  Reggie Miller: ""Good call there by the official"""
Pat Connaughton is the greatest retirement advisor to make it to the NBA
"Did you see the last play the bucks made in G1 vs the hawks? They’re down 1, Giannis is doing whatever he wants inside, and they draw a fucking 3 for Pat Connaughton. That’s dumb as shit."
"And every coach does those from the start of the game  Let's take this for example, Bucks last night had a play in the clutch when Pat Connaughton got subbed in and missed a wide open three, there's a comment with 1k+ upvotes shitting on Bud for it    A WIDE OPEN SHOT, WIDE OPEN    People are morons, they have no idea how good a coach is, 0 literally 0, there are so many things going on in an NBA game that there are entire staffs that teams need and you have an user that talks shit that knows nothing"
"I’m sorry I don’t care what his percentage is. If i’m down 1 with less than thirty seconds left and I have Giannis, Jrue, and Middleton on the floor the last thing i’m doing is let Pat Connaughton chuck a three."
"&gt; Rudy Gay infamous ""not this guy"" game winner against Toronto  Rudy Gay was quite literally the guy for that team, but whatever.  &gt; Lowry's inbound to OG last year in the bubble  Desperation play with 0.5 seconds on the shot clock, Lowry went for the only thing he had, totally different situation.  &gt; Lin's game winner vs Toronto (okok this was Linsanity)  You responded yourself.  &gt; Bird's steal still had ~2 seconds on the clock, and Bird was famously lethal and clutch - still passed to DJ for the layup  It's a layup, which i specifically mentioned that i'm fine with.   &gt; Literally yesterday, Ayton, a 10m/yr player, caught a lob for a game winner instead of Booker, who's being paid 27m.  Ayton is in a rookie contract and the Suns went for what they had, a lob was the ONLY option and again, it's a layup.  Pat Connaughton is a 35% 3-PT shooter, he is a mediocre shooter in general, drawing a play for him (even wide open) is and always will be a mistake, but whatever, people will keep defending passing to role players in the clutch moments, they will keep missing and everything will be fine.  I guess people don't ask themselves why said player is wide freaking open, the defense is literally begging Giannis/LeBron/KD or whomever it is to pass the ball to these guys and you are doing EXACTLY what they want, the moment Khris gave that ball away to Pat freaking Connaughton in the 3-PT line, Nate McMillan should've jumped in celebration."
"Why would you draw up a play to get Pat Connaughton an open 3, when you paid 5 first-round draft picks for Jrue and he was on fire?"
"I mean, there's moments where fans can see Bud and Doc making highly questionable decisions. While Connaughton and Middleton threes might be solid looks in a vacuum or in a regular season game, you have to make that in-game adjustment. Both of those guys were cold and Jrue was on fire. The Jrue/Giannis pick and roll murdered the Hawks down the stretch and got Giannis two or three easy dunks. Why did they go away from that? At the least I would have liked to see more of Giannis screening for Jrue on those final possessions that ended with Pat and Khris misses."
"When the game is on the line, you give it to someone who can live up to that moment, not Pat Connaughton."
"Because you are up 1 with almost no time left, in this case 2pts are a much better shot than 3s, there is absolutely no reason to shoot from that far. Sure getting an open shot is good but a Pat Connaughton open shot in that situation is not hard to get, they are obviously going to leave him open.    They had dominated the pain the whole game, the Hawks really could not stop Giannis, or even Jrue and Middleton, from going to the basket. But the Bucks kept settling for long shots and they kept shooting from outside until they lost.   Middleton was 0/9 from 3, why did he kept shooting 3?? He could get an easy midrange or drive for a layup at will. The Hawks are not a great defensive team, but the Bucks bailed them out the whole game. That last play was an example of that."
"I think my problem is that Pat Connaughton is a good 3pt shooter, but he has not performed well in the playoffs. Especially if he’s only 1/5 from three(iirc) before that. I’m not trusting someone who’s 1/5 to hit the biggest shot of the game smh"
"I was so livid. I literally screamed at the TV ""that's your grand plan?? Game 1 of the conference finals on the line, this is what you pull, a Pat fucking Connaughton 3??""   I've been defending Bud a lot. He's making all the adjustments he needs to - not quickly enough to be sure, but he's making them and showing he's adapting and learning. But that shit was inexcusable"
1. Because he’s Pat Connaughton. 2. Because he was already struggling from field that day. 3. Because he’s only out there because the coach forgot Bryn Forbes exists. 4. Because he’s Pat Connaughton!
"How many role players have to miss open three point shots in crucial moments in the playoffs for people to understand that these aren't the right plays, ESPECIALLY when it's a 3-PT shot.  There's a reason Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton get paid 86 million a year combined and Pat Connaughton gets paid 4 million, Connaughton isn't a great shooter and a 3 there is a mistake anyways.  Every time this situation comes up i always say this: If you are LeBron James or Giannis or whomever it is, you are giving the defense a favor when you pass to a role player in a crucial moment, that's EXACTLY what they want and that's why Kyle Korver or Danny Green or, in this case Pat Connaughton, is wide open. Part of what makes a great player a GREAT player is being reliable in clutch moments, that's not the same for a role player.  And before people ask ""But what about Jordan passing to Kerr?"", That was a two pointer right around the foul line, my opinion completely changes if its a layup or a WIDE OPEN 12 footer."
Mans writing so much in an internet argument about Pat Connaughton
"I can understand that Bud didn't call for a Pat Connaughton wing 3, I think any rational NBA fan can understand that."
"Super impressive, but I have some doubts about the measurement. His [standing reach](https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro/?sort=HEIGHT_W_SHOES&amp;dir=1) looks kinda suspect. Only 8'1"" despite being 6'4.75"" in shoes with a 6'7.25"" wingspan. Seems like some Pat Connaughton shenanigans to me."
They literally ran an in bound play that kept working every time to giannis at the rim and when they needed it most decided nope time for a Pat Connaughton 3.
&gt; the bucks gave up 3 offensive rebounds  Cause they were playing Pat Connaughton in crunch time instead of their center maybe
"“I was literally seeing three rims out there, so I just shot at the left one”  \- Pat Connaughton"
iirc this wasn't the first time Pat Connaughton airballed a shot in clutch time
I visibly laughed when I saw Pat Connaughton attempt a game winner three. Wtf is Bud on?
yep not letting portis play also who was on fire in the first half instead let pat connaughton play 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Masterclass by bud. Man drew up a play in the biggest moment where Giannis didn’t touch the ball and they relied on Pat fuckin connaughton
Bucks steps for improvement: * Quit bricking threes * Lob it to Giannis down the stretch * Fewer minutes for Pat Connaughton * Have to stop the Hawks from getting so many offensive boards
Drawing up a go-ahead three in crunch time for Pat connaughton  Me: what in the absolute fuck  Bucks fan: first time?
"you're telling me you have giannis, middleton, and holiday on your team and you draw up an ATO for pat connaughton to shoot a 3?"
Like of everyone on the team you give it to pat connaughton? I’d legit rather give it to Giannis
Pat Connaughton ain't smiling anymore. Escaped Durant only to have to face Trae Young lmao
"One on One Plays DON'T WIN GAMES..... Another thing is how stupid coach Mike Budenholzer not letting Portis play who was on fire on the first half, instead let pat connaughton play 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. As Chuck says, Bucks is a dumb team LOL"
what's pat connaughton doing on the court?
"Pat ""Airball clutch"" Connaughton"
That Pat Connaughton airball sounded like a Call of Duty airstrike
Bud maybe try drawing up a three pointer for Pat Connaughton
Turns out a Pat Connaughton 3 is not a crunch-time playoff play after all
So Bud draw a play for pat connaughton
Bud really drew up a play for Pat Connaughton
Pat Connaughton is pretty fucking bad
How is Pat Connaughton the guy taking a quick 3 after a timeout?  Bud just loves out-doing himself each game.
"The game is on the line, they need a 2, and they give it to pat connaughton for 3???"
"Down 1, let's have Pat Connaughton shoot a 3 after 6 seconds come off the shot clock"
A shot for Pat Fucking Connaughton??
Pat Connaughton is our centre now
straight laced jesse pinkman is pat connaughton
"This is why the 76ers would have been an easier matchup for Milwaukee, vs Philly all Bud has to do is bench Brook Lopez for Pat Connaughton and double team Curry cause other than Embiid he's the only offensive threat"
Imagine being pat connaughton
"THAT'S PAT ""SECOND HIGHEST EVER RECORDED VERTICAL IN THE DRAFT COMBINE"" CONNAUGHTON"
I already bet my life savings on a pat connaughton fmvp
lol healthy Celtics with Kyrie and Horford lost in 5 to Bledsoe and Pat Connaughton Bucks but they'd beat this team. Okay.
"Bucks go cold and brainless at times but they just have so many weapons. Giannis does his thing, khris can drop 40, jrue can hit timely shots and defends great. Brook Lopez hits his threes and gets blocks. Hell even Pat connaughton had timely shots in the first half last game. Meanwhile nets couldn't get a joe Harris basket."
Just a heads up you have Pat Connaughton drafted and also left out the first round. Also this draft is a rough one !
"And the Bucks sat everyone for the Denver game right before the shut down. They started Wes Mathews, Pat Connaughton, Sterling Brown, Thanasis, and Robin Lopez 🤮"
"Yea, Im still mad about this shit...had to struggle with Donte and fkin Pat Connaughton all year."
How dare you slander Pat Connaughton like that.
Baltimore Orioles legend/2015 2nd round pick Pat Connaughton lives to fight another day!
"Yes, it’s Pat Connaughton who’s the star /s"
Pat Connaughton is the only bench player in this game who has attempted a shot lol
So is Pat Connaughton a good player? Dude looks like he doesn't belong on the court.
"outside of a couple of three's, pat connaughton has been absolutely awful all series on defense"
"I mean imagine getting even looked at by that beautiful man Pat Connaughton, let alone touched.  I would blush and run away just like Jae."
And he had at least 5 more important rebounds either hit off his hands or refuse to box out Pat MF Connaughton
Pat Connaughton IS the Fiserv Fantom
Why does it seem like Pat Connaughton is the Buck's best 3 point shooter? Lol
My money's on Pat Connaughton
Pat Connaughton is the white Dorian Finney-Smith
Pat Connaughton really about to carry the Bucks in the finals
Time to live and die by the Pat Connaughton imo.
Jrue Holiday really getting outshined by Pat Connaughton
Pat Connaughton is THE pride of the Irish
PAT CONNAUGHTON JUST GOT A BANG LMAO WTF
PAT FUCKING CONNAUGHTON
Is Mike Breen the world’s number one Pat Connaughton fan? Loses his shit whenever the man touches the ball lol
middleton passed on a wide open 3 to a double teamed pat connaughton in the corner?? wtf
how is that a foul? curry never gets those call. pat connaughton doesn't get that call. the US is going to flop itself out of medal contention in the Olympics if they expect calls like that.
When the best player you have on your bench is Pat Connaughton then you know you fucked your roster construction.
Wtf is Pat Connaughton doing lol
Pat “Ben Simmons” Connaughton
"pat connaughton is the pride of the irish, expect riots in dublin if the bucks lose"
Lotta pat Connaughton.
Pat Connaughton is literally unplayable
Pat Connaughton is the glue that holds the bucks together
"Some say that if you perform a pump fake, sometimes Pat Connaughton will soar by with his hand in the air"
"Bucks fans help me out, what does Pat Connaughton contribute to this team? Is he supposed to be a 3/d guy? He fucking sucks every time I watch the Bucks."
Pat Connaughton is Joel Mchale’s evil twin
"Pat Connaughton had his arm under Booker's just like the foul that was called on him the other way, so maybe he was expecting consistency?"
"Pat Connaughton can jump, he got bounce."
What IN THE FUCK PAT CONNAUGHTON
Why would you exhaust your best offensive player guarding KD when you know KD is going to get his either way?  It's honestly crazy to me how upset people got with this.  it's not like we were putting Pat Connaughton on KD or something.
"Wouldn’t Jae Crowder also be the definition of such a player? I just don’t think that Connaughton is on as high a level of vintage PJ Tucker, but then again, he’s kind of building out the best part of his resume right now, so I admit I could very well be wrong. My own team has the  corpse of Trevor Ariza, who in his own day was a starter level 3 and D guy, so I catch your point.  I guess I never thought of Pat as a 3 and D wing as he is a little smaller than a prototypical wing, but I think that kind of categorization highlights his value."
Pat is a rotation level 3 and D wing. There are less of those in the league than people think. Almost every team plays a non starter level 3 and d guard/wing in their rotation because they can provide some value on both ends.  Phoenix - Torrey Craig/Nader  Milwaukee - Connaughton/Tucker  Atlanta - Hill/Reddish  76ers -Thybulle  Clippers - Mann/Batum  There’s just less wings in general than people think and they are harder to exploit than a talented undersized guard or an athletic center who can’t shoot
pat connaughton is like joe ingles. he’s white and doesn’t take huge pride in his appearance so everyone thinks he’s trash just by looking at him

(The Bucks got approximately an extra 12 points from non-heave 3's relative to the current postseason percentage.)  At best, the two transgressions even out in a series that is otherwise Suns 2-1 without Refball (aka neither team has been screwed out of a win)."
"Yes, I mean that Bogi's comparison should be Donte, not Pat Connaughton."
"""I just really think Pat Connaughton deserves more minutes."""
Pat Connaughton trick y'all man  Running around doing nothing
"I think Donte would've been great in the Hawks series as well. It's not just that he's good at a lot of *really* useful things (excellent at reading passes and turning them into steals, excellent rebounder, can hit a 3) but it also means Jeff Teague doesn't see the floor. Pat Connaughton has stepped way up, but he's still a 8th-9th guy off the bench who is getting heavy minutes because after Jrue/Donte/kind-of-PJ our guards are just not meant to be starters."

The Bucks put those guys in a lot of defensive actions to try and tilt the defense in a way that favored them, even if Trae was not directly defending the shot that Jrue was taking the space he got was often a direct result of the defense's inability to make up for the group deficiency caused by them.     The same way now the Bucks do not have Pat Connaughton or Brynn Forbes assigned to Devin Booker or Chris Paul, but by virtue of the offense tilting the floor towards those defensive assignments their inability to properly cover their portion of the floor hurts the cumulative defense. Despite Jrue doing an absolutely phenomenal job defensively this round, the guards for the Suns are going off because of these sorts of adjustments that are required."

He doesn’t have help mf look at the stat sheet. Pat connaughton is not help.
"We lost Donte and we've had split SG minutes between Pat Connaughton, Bryn Forbes and Jeff Teague. There really isn't any remaining depth to gut. Dame is also not going to be traded this off-season.   If you're an Eastern team right now planning on contending in the next two-three years you have to plan around the fact that Brooklyn will be injured. Because you cannot plan around beating them healthy."
Pat Connaughton looks like Matthew Dellavedova AND gives me the same irritating vibes
Pat Connaughton playing 33 minutes in an NBA finals game seems like Twilight Zone level shit
I feel so bad for Giannis dawg. He gave EVERYTHING and Middleton and Holiday couldn’t give him no type of help. Mf Pat Connaughton out there looking like Ray Allen.   I still believe in the bucks but it’s looking spooky fr.
Pat Connaughton was so inspirational tonight. Great hustle.
I feel so bad for Giannis dawg. He gave EVERYTHING and Middleton and Holiday couldn’t give him no type of help. Mf Pat Connaughton out there looking like Ray Allen.   I still believe in the bucks but it’s looking spooky fr.
Pat Connaughton is getting abused on defense.  Khris Middleton is doing his fan favorite houdini act  Jrue Holiday has become Eric Bledsoe.  Brook Lopez has reverted back into Brook Lopez after looking like prime Kareem in against the Hawks.  It's a damn shame.
pat Connaughton was their 2nd best player. thats just sad
When you're second best offensive player is Pat Connaughton...
"When you have to play Pat Connaughton 33 minutes, you have team issues."
"Giannis putting up an all time performance, while the rest of the team didn’t show up. Pat Connaughton was their 2nd best player tonight"
The bucks shouldn’t have Pat Connaughton as their second best player
Damn could you imagine if the bucks 2 team USA members could outscore pat connaughton
I feel so bad for Giannis dawg. He gave EVERYTHING and Middleton and Holiday couldn’t give him no type of help. Mf Pat Connaughton out there looking like Ray Allen.   I still believe in the bucks but it’s looking spooky fr.
Giannis is a fucking warrior who looked like prime Shaq and only Pat Connaughton decided to show up. I don't know if the Bucks can expect another performance like that with his knee and I wonder what excuses are going to start filling this subreddit now.
Bucks fans ready to blame   *Checks notes*  Pat Connaughton?
Pat Connaughton legitimately outplayed him this game
"Yeah, you’re not winning when Pat Connaughton is your second best player"
Pat Connaughton cannot play 30+ minutes on an NBA finals team.  Jeff Teague cannot play a full quarter in an NBA finals game.  This bucks team has 0 bench
They do but they’re just not showing up at all. Giannis is giving everything he has and the 2 team USA members are struggling to outscore pat connaughton
Relying on Pat connaughton for 3s is not good.
Someone other than Giannis should really help Pat Connaughton

The Suns can not continue to get away with leaving Pat “the most dangerous player on the Milwaukee Bucks” Connaughton open like that

"Jeff you spitting, but no one gonna care if Pat connaughton is the main leader. The best player will always he that guy weather its true ir not."
Never thought I’d hear “WIRED Finals Edition: Jae Crowder and Pat Connaughton”
Pat connaughton mic’d up for the NBA Finals. Who predicted that ?
"The Suns, despite being up, should still find a way to mitigate the presence of the dangerous man on the Bucks, Pat Connaughton"
"idk, I mean I know the FT gap in this one was big, and we like to complain widely about something after every game... but, as an impartial fan I've thought 1) the playoffs have been reffed well, and 2) this game was pretty fairly called, minus the normal one or two misses on each side  I've got nothing to say about the refs tbh, weird how obsessed reddit is about that instead of stuff that actually mattered more, like CP hitting an unsustainable number of mid rangers (even for him), or Giannis not being able to go side to side well, or way too many minutes for Pat Connaughton  I guess that would require actual nuanced conversation, but you know, we can just complain about the refs instead"
They still are not going to give up their shot at the bag.  Bobby Portis made 60% of his career earnings last year. Pat Connaughton almost doubled his career earnings this year. Every team has a few rookies to third year players who have short shelf lives.    LeBron's interests are not at all aligned with the common player.
&gt; That’s not the case for probably 90% of the league and cutting the season short would impact how much money the players would have made.   That number is probably 99%.   Every season matters a ton for the bottom half of the league. Bobby Portis made 60% of his career earnings last year. Pat Connaughton almost doubled his career earnings this year. Every team has a few rookies to third year players who have short shelf lives.
If Di Vincenzo wasn't hurt I could see it working but Connaughton is also a pretty big liability for the Bucks assuming that they go Jrue/Kris/Pat/P.J./Giannis. If only cash considerations could play!
"Has he? Guys are shooting about 1.5% worse against him than their averages this playoffs which is the same impact had by Clarkson and worse than guys like Pat Connaughton, Huerter, Powell, Dame, Kaminsky, Rivers, Mann, Payne, Beal, THT, George Hill, Lou Williams, Duncan Robinson, and Korkmaz.  He has a -0.6 dbpm. It’s the worst on the Suns besides for Galloway and Jevon Carter. The only guys besides those 3 who don’t have a positive dbpm are Torrey Craig and Abdel Nader. Of the 91 guys who played enough to qualify for the leaderboard, he’s 66th. He’s tied with Bryn Forbes. Some guys in the negative who are still above him include Trae, Mitchell and Shamet. Dame and Mann are at 0. Some guys with positive ones include Monte Morris, Reggie Jackson, Lou Williams, Huerter, Doncic, Batum, Campazzo, Seth Curry, and Schroeder. He also has fewer defensive win shares per 48 than guys like Duncan Robinson, Cam Payne, CP3, Saric, Kuzma, Shake, Korkmaz, Quickley, George Hill, and Drummond."
"Earlier in the playoffs, Pat Connaughton impressed me. He is...not impressing right now.  Crowder also having a nightmare of a game."
When the losing team plays Brynn Forbes Pat Connaughton and Bobby Portis extended minutes in the Finals the coach is rigged
Pat Connaughton coming in to singlehandedly fuck over the Bucks again. This guy is cursed lol
Pat Connaughton is -15 and not to forget his bitch ass  flops
Pat connaughton -15 damn lol
Pat Connaughton is -15 in 15 minutes. That's fucking crazy. The next worse is Jeff Teague at -5 in less than 2 minutes.
Pat Connaughton -15 🤢

U mean Pat Connaughton or Bobby Portis
has a dream Pat Connaughton went for 31 bring it home Pat
"The Bucks have the coolest team. Giannis is just the epitome of likability, its impossible not to like him with that babyface and accent. And just story in general. Middleton is calm and collected, doesn't get a lot of attention, but has always been underrated. Jrue, one of the best wing defenders in the game, has gone through a lot with his family and the scares earlier in his career. He worked so hard to get where he is. Brook Lopez, one of the biggest nerds in the league. PJ Tucker, the shoe junkie. Bobby ""punch Mirotic in the face"" Portis. Pat Connaughton, ""the most athletic white guy ever."" Yeah, I like this team."
We cannot let pat connaughton be out hustling us on the boards again
"Here is an attempt at putting the article here. There are videos with surrounding text so I cut those and the surrounding text. Sorry if some of it doesn't make sense.  One trend that has perhaps been underdiscussed in these always-evolving NBA Finals: The Milwaukee Bucks are one win from the title in large part because their offense has been really, really good.  The Bucks in the Finals have poured in 117.7 points per 100 possessions, a mark that would have edged the Brooklyn Nets for No. 1 in the regular season. The ugliness of some of Milwaukee's meandering half-court possessions obscures how lethal this team can be when it gets rolling.  The easiest path to that is to not play in the half court at all, and a big theme in this series has been Milwaukee's ability to get out in transition. The Bucks aren't running quite as often as they did in the regular season -- when they played in transition more than any team, per Cleaning The Glass -- but they are still doing so at an above-average rate, and that's a win considering the Phoenix Suns were among the very best at keeping teams out of transition.  And the Bucks are scoring just about every time they hit the open floor: 152.9 points per 100 transition chances, according to Cleaning The Glass. The No. 1 team in the regular season by that measure finished at 133.8. Yowza. This is one of the subtler ways Phoenix's lack of size hurts. Deandre Ayton is the only guy in the Suns' rotation even resembling a big man, and he plays near the rim on offense -- meaning he is rarely back early as a deterrent. No other Sun can make Giannis Antetokounmpo at full throttle pause to think for one second.  The Suns have been a little lax with their floor balance and ball control, but the Bucks are opportunistic; they hunt transition chances with constant urgency.  Behind some hot shooting and smart adjustments from Mike Budenholzer in Game 5, Milwaukee's half-court offense -- its weak spot in past playoffs -- is up to about league-average production for the series, per Cleaning The Glass. The Bucks doing that against one of the league's nastiest half-court defenses is almost cause for a parade.  Milwaukee brutalizing Phoenix on the offensive glass has boosted that half-court scoring figure by turning some initially listless possessions into points. Milwaukee has needed all this offense, because the Suns have scored 115.5 points per 100 possessions -- a hair below their sixth-ranked figure in the regular season. Their effective field goal percentage for the series would have ranked No. 2 behind the Nets; it bumped even higher over Games 3, 4, and 5 -- all Phoenix losses. Phoenix is shooting the bejesus out of it.  The Suns have had to, because, as I noted before Game 5, the Bucks have methodically turned this series into a math problem the Suns can't win. The possession battle is a rout for the Bucks. They are getting more offensive boards and free throws. And their defense is scrunching the Suns' offense toward the midrange to a dangerous extreme. Phoenix is getting to the rim at a league-worst rate, and it has attempted just 30 corner 3s -- six per game, down from its regular-season average of 10. Seventeen of those 30 came in Game 2. In the four other games, the Bucks have basically erased the corners from the court.  It's great and not super shocking that Phoenix is shooting so well; the Suns consciously built around two elite shot-makers in Devin Booker and Chris Paul. It's not great that the Suns have to shoot well -- and almost preposterously well -- to have any chance to win. The Bucks have a margin for so-so shooting; the Suns don't.   Starting in Game 3, the Bucks have found the right mix of defenses to make the Suns uncomfortable. When Brook Lopez is on the floor, the Bucks play a slightly more aggressive version of their base pick-and-roll defense: Lopez ventures out to deter an easy jumper, but not so high as to approximate any sort of trap. He has mostly been able to stay in front of Booker and Paul, and then pivot back to Ayton in time to meet Ayton outside the block-charge circle -- forcing tough hooks and floaters.  The Suns might be able to find traction getting even more creative with where Ayton sets his picks -- sometimes close to midcourt; sometimes at the foul line. (Ayton is also smart about flipping the direction of his pick at the last second.) Booker might benefit from more instant head-down driving, and less pulling back to map the floor. Regardless: Lopez has hung in since the Bucks ditched Game 1's switch-heavy gambit.  When Lopez is off the floor, the Bucks switch everything. They don't seem all that concerned with handing Booker or Paul the Pat Connaughton matchup both are seeking. An adjustment in how Milwaukee's other four defenders react when the Suns get Connaughton on an island is one reason the Bucks have flipped the momentum in these Finals.  One Milwaukee tweak was to stop switching with Lopez. Connaughton at least has a shot of sticking close enough to Paul and Booker as to not require emergency help -- or at least not inspire the fear in his teammates that such help might be required.  It's easy to say Phoenix should spice things up instead of getting bogged down in isolation basketball: keep moving, set more ball screens, run split actions off the ball (when two teammates screen for each other and veer off in random directions), and continue with its sets as if facing a normal defense and not a switch-everything vise grip. The Suns should do all those things!  But elite switching defenses have a way of squeezing that verve out of you -- of making all that motion seem pointless and exhausting.  Milwaukee's offense has had euphoric ups and troubling swoons in the Budenholzer era, including in these playoffs, but its defense has been constant. If the Bucks have a mediocre scoring night after a sizzling first five games, that defense might be good enough to carry them across the finish line."
Props to Pat connaughton for giving up his soul on that poster
Pat Connaughton minutes terrify me

Thats first ballot hall of famer Pat Connaughton to you son
Game 7. Where the greats show up and create their legacys. Bruce Brown vs Pat Connaughton
Ive probably seen pat Connaughton make 2 threes this whole series
Why is Pat Connaughton getting this many minutes in a game 7? Is Bryn Forbes that bad?
How does Pat Connaughton have the greenest light for a catch and shoot deep 3 from any wing on the court? Does he think he’s Eric Gordon
"Connaughton coming off the bench and immediately firing up an air ball. Hey, Pat!  Stop stealing my moves!"
I can’t find it but there’s a video somewhere of Pat Connaughton in a practice setting him up by asking if he can touch the rim without jumping. He goes “Yeah but I’ve gotta pull the rim down first” so he starts grabbing the net to pull the rim (FLAT FOOTED) and Connaughton yams on him. It was pretty funny but the main thing I took from it was that this motherfucker can grab a fair way up the net easily without even getting on his tiptoes.
Bud be like “why not Pat Connaughton?”
How's Pat Connaughton with a cardio game too!

Wait why did pat connaughton take that foul?
"I mean this in the nicest way possible, but who the fuck does Pat Connaughton think he is, pulling deep threes like that with time on the shot clock?"
Pat connaughton really doing nothing for the bucks on both ends
I've seen Booker hunt Brook all game and Pat Connaughton commit the most unnecessarily dumb fouls while people act like the FT discrepancy is some Lakers-Kings robbery   Bucks have missed a lot of point blank shots and have been flatout getting outclassed.  There's a couple of missed calls at worst but blaming a 15+ deficit on FT discrepancy when it's obviously not that is just lazy and stupid
Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton are not 1st and 2nd options off the bench on a championship team
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say if Pat Connaughton is your weak side rim protection it's not gonna go well
TIL Pat Connaughton sucks at soccer.
I used to play soccer with these twins who were fast as fuck - just incredible athletes.  But they sucked at actually playing soccer and really just joined the team because they love to run.  Pat Connaughton is the Bucks version of that.
"Pat ""I attack triple teams in the paint"" Connaughton"
what is pat connaughton doing
"I am impressed by Pat Connaughton every time I see him play. I should have focused more on being a basketball player. If he is, then I could be too."
Pat connaughton really saw 3 ppl in the paint and said yeah I can do this
Pat Connaughton stop driving my dude
Pat Connaughton must have nudes of Mike Budenholzer at this point. Why the fuck is he on the floor.
"Tyler Herro, Joe Harris, Kevin Huerter, Gordon Hayward, Kevin Love  TJ McConnell, Luke Kennard, Duncan Robinson, Dean Wade, Mason Plumlee  Alex Caruso, Grayson Allen, Garrison Matthews, Pat Connaughton, Cody Zeller"
"Yes.  Did you know that Bud adjusted this year after all the criticism and instituted more switching? Did you also know that CP3 and Booker are two of the best in the league -- CP3 literally one of the best ever -- from midrange, which is the exact weakness that killed the Bucks the past three years?  Bud got legit criticism because he's been slow to make adjustments. It's not just r/NBA, it's guys like Zach Lowe and John Hollinger who've written about it. Here's Hollinger from today:  *While Lopez is a master at this coverage and showed in the conference finals that he can play “drop” even against a player like Trae Young, who most teams wouldn’t chance it against, the Suns are an even steeper challenge. Paul is one of the best shooters ever from the free-throw-line area, while Booker has exceptional craft in either getting pull-ups or blasting off on the way to the rim. Against backup Payne, the Bucks are more likely to feel comfortable playing drop, especially since Payne has the speed to roast switches.      The Bucks can play switching lineups too, especially if they pull Lopez off the floor and opt to play Giannis as their center. That arrangement puts Pat Connaughton in at the wing and immediately forces Ayton into a tough spot at the other end, where he either must guard Giannis or stand in the corner with P.J. Tucker. Alas, the Bucks are going to try to roll with a 6.5-man rotation as much as possible, which means Lopez almost certainly must play at least half of each game regardless. I have a hard time seeing how Bryn Forbes stays on the court against the Suns’ guards, and Bobby Portis could have a tough time defensively as well.*"
To be fair if Pat Connaughton went to the Warriors that year he wouldn't have faced the same backlash
"Personally, the Giannis-Ayton matchup in the post is too much work. The best tactic would be to attack the guard pair and force the rest of the team to win without them. If Giannis makes an effort to attack CP3 and Booker he'll have no less than a 6 inch height advantage everytime, and paired with defense from Holiday and Middleton will take a toll on those 2. Giannis will also be able to guard Ayton appropriately, Ayton has been incredible but the only defensive big of this caliber was AD who was injured during the first round. I don't think Giannis will be able to hold him perfectly, but he has the size and speed to keep up with him in a way that Jokic and Batum were not able to. It's also worth saying that putting Giannis at the 4 would be effective looking at potential match-ups of Dario Saric and Jae Crowder. Crowder is an elite defender who was able to put a dent in Lebron's production, but he will be giving up 5 inches of height, and cannot match Giannis' athletic ability.   On another note, P.J. Tucker will play a massive role on defense, he'll be able to guard 1-4 against this Phoenix team. With his performance against Kevin Durant, we can say with some certainty that he would be able to effectively guard someone like Booker, who is likely still feeling pain from his broken nose and who is the same size as P.J.  Some problems I see for the Bucks lie in the bench unit. Players like Brook Lopez, Bryn Forbes and Pat Connaughton may find themselves attacked by CP3's prodding offense. Taking advantage of Lopez's slow feet and lack of ability to close the distance on the mid range shot. This also applies to Booker, who will have the added benefit of size against Pat and Forbes. The Suns will likely be match-up hunting against this Milwaukee team and working to rotate the star defenders away from star offensive players. Defensively, I'm not sure what the Suns will be able to do. Bridges, Paul and Crowder are defensively diverse starters that can be swapped and changed around nearly interchangeably, so they will have an incredible amount of options to work through on the defensive end.   Ultimately, some key match-ups for this series will probably be  - Ayton vs Antetokounmpo   - Paul vs Holiday  - Booker vs Middleton  - Payne vs Teague  Especially without Giannis, Phoenix has an excellent opportunity to win this championship looking at the depth and versatility of their lineup. Barring injury, I expect Phoenix will take this series in 6-7 games."
He also got Brook Lopez and Pat Connaughton mixed up numerous times lol
"Unless the guy you're talking to is someone like, say, the person responsible for something like the BP oil spill, it would be pretty hard for your comment to be true.  Marv Albert is supposed to be the play-by-play guy.  The guy responsible for telling you who is doing what during that game.  Except, even sitting courtside, he can manage to confuse Pat Connaughton with *Brook Lopez*, or PJ Tucker with Khris Middleton (repeatedly).  Or call the name of a player who isn't on either team.  Or make up a name of a player who doesn't exist in the league.  Or say that a player on one team is in fact on the other team.  Or can't tell if a call is out of bounds or a foul, despite the referee clearly signaling what it is (and with the other call not making sense given what's going on on the floor while Marv is confused and talking).  Or can't tell if a shot is a three pointer even if the shooter is 2 feet inside the line.  I mean, it's literally the job of the play-by-play guy, and he's been incapable of doing it for many years now.  That makes him just about as bad at his job as someone can be."
Even Pat Connaughton is much better than Bledsoe at this point
&gt; Pat Connaughton becomes the first NBA player to foul someone with his penis.  Yeah that was some bullshit lol his wood is so hard it hurt someone's knee :P
That Scott Williams suspension was terrible.  He wasn't some great player but he was that year Bucks Bobby Portis tough guy/Pat Connaughton hustle guy.  Losing him was a big blow on top of the shit reffing.
Pat connaughton huge penis confirmed
&gt; Pat Connaughton becomes the first NBA player to foul someone with his penis  wait what?
"I doubt there are many Bucks fans older than me on here. After I left Wisconsin I used to have to go to sports bars and convince the bartender that Milwaukee had a team if I wanted to watch them. Over forty years watching this team and we are going to fucking FINALS BABY WOOOHOOOO!!!!!! LOL Nephews saying they have suffered since the Ray Allen years.   These finals will be special because it was Phoenix that lost the Kareem coin flip, before I was born. Both these teams are due a Ship. Bucks won in 71 with maybe the best team ever, Phoenix has lost two finals since.   Game Notes- why do people act surprised Middleton goes super nova when Giannis is out.   Pat Connaughton becomes the first NBA player to foul someone with his penis.   STFU Bucks fans, Tucker should be on the floor even if he is not hitting, he does so much more."
how does Trae get the softest of calls? Pat Connaughton in shambles

Pat Connaughton gets mauled but never gets the call
"Am I crazy for thinking Hawks +115 is a really good bet?   Vegas always knows, but you can replace a bit of Trae between Bogdan &amp; Huerters playmaking &amp; shot creation + Lou Will might not play that well again but he can create and get some buckets too.  The Bucks are going from Giannis to Pat Connaughton &amp; Bobby Portis. You're losing a dpoy calibre player and their only great threat around the rim on offense."
The real ones know it's all about Lou Will vs Pat Connaughton
Giannis for 3!  Now they're saying it was a turnover by Pat Connaughton.
"Sure...of course they can play better. But no Giannis for the bucks is a bigger loss than no Trae for the Hawks... that was kinda my point. If reddish can hound Middleton and keep him in check like last game, I'm having trouble seeing where the offense comes from. Maybe this is a Bryn Forbes or Pat Connaughton game. We shall see."
"Bud's favorite son, after Giannis, Pat Connaughton time."
