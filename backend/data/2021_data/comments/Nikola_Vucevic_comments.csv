"Vooch is 30 years old, and signed for 3 more years. What’s the point of relinquishing future cap, and trading for an OLD veteran to put next to a team mainly composed of players 24 and younger that have no Guarantee of making the playoffs.   I never said you mentioned gay as the future. I talked about the timeline you’re alluding to.  The trade is clearly centered towards the idea of the spurs competing now with you saying “ spurs should do it because (insert roster) is pretty scary and might make some playoff noise, it would give pop his best team in years”   That’s the problem. Giving up assets for 30 year old Nikola Vucevic is a waste when we can throw the same amount of money towards Markkanen, Collins, Allen etc. keep our assets and trust our development staff.   I understand your idea behind this, but imo it just doesn’t make sense"
"Bruh can we wait till it's near the all-star selection date for dumb stuff like this? Like you said, the Heat's record is not reflective of how good they actually are, they're in a slump mired by covid restrictions, minor injuries, and some cold play. Let them ride to the trade deadline, and let's see how records look then.  That being said, I don't think you can just write off certain players because their team is underperforming. For instance, Bam Adebayo's an elite player, putting up a solid 20/9/5. Based on just those numbers, he should be in the all star discussion. I'd even argue that outside of the box score, Adebayo gives more to the Heat than guys like Julius Randle(who's having a career season for the Knicks) or Nikola Vucevic(who's got a single all-star selection, while playing at that level for the last 3-4 seasons now). You also need to take into account their position, like Bam Adebayo wouldn't take the spot of someone like Malcom Brogdan or Collin Sexton, outside of wildcards/reserves.  You give different arguments such as ""not enough games"" or just not playing ""nice enough,"" but you can't seem to give the Heat players the same excuses. What's the opposite of homerism? I'd say whatever that is, that's how you feel about the Heat players. Sure, they're not doing great, I'd for sure place guys like Sabonis, Christian Wood, or heck I'd even give Jerami Grant the spot over Jimmy Butler this season, but come on man. Cut them some slack. You and I both know 20 games isn't enough to judge a team's performances, regardless of how good one team or another has been. Do you REALLY think that the Hornets are a near .500 squad, with their current record of 10 wins and 11 losses, or do you think it has been a spell of weaker schedule, hot shooting, good synergist play, and overall luck? Do you REALLY think that Luka Doncic is going to average 29.4% from 3 for the season and miss the playoffs this season as the current 13th seed?"

"Expected 3P% is a rough projection of a player's shooting prowess based on their volume, as well as their efficiency thus far through the season. It's a way to adjust for hot and cold starts. For example, Joe Harris is shooting 48.4% so far, but in reality he's likely closer to a 40.6% three-point shooter. OP can explain it better than I can, here's a great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/l67c22/oc_what_to_make_of_early_season_hotcold_shooting/) of his on the subject.  &gt;The basic idea behind the padding method is to weigh down (or up) a player’s three-point percentage by the league average and then gradually ease up on that weight as the player increase their three-point attempts. In other words, the padding method assumes a player is more likely to be a league average shooter than not and gradually relaxes that assumption with each increasing shot attempt.    &gt;   &gt;Kelly Oubre Jr. has shot the ball so poorly and with so much volume that it’s clear he’s having a worse start to the season than anyone else from behind the three-point line. But even with his cold start, the padding method expects Oubre to shoot a not-great-but-also-not-too-terrible 32.6 percent on 3s the rest of the season. That’s also probably closer to how defenses will treat Oubre. If he really were a 21.8 percent shooter from 3, opposing teams could win games by literally paying Oubre to shoot — although they’re not far off from doing that. Less than three percent of Oubre’s three-point attempts this season have been contested (defense that is either “Tight” or “Very tight”). Only Nikola Vucevic has taken a higher percentage of uncontested looks among the top 50 players in three-point attempts."
No nikola vucevic?  Surely he gets an all star nod this year

As a side note, if we are to use SD or IQR as a measure of a player's consistency, I would argue that standard deviation is the more accurate measure. This is because it accounts for all games, whereas IQR really only uses the 25th percentile and 75th percentile data. It is still early into the season which would cause some skewing of the values. As an example, if you've only played 16 games, the IQR would be the difference between your 4th highest scoring game and your 12th highest scoring game."

James Harden   Bradley Beal   Trae Young   Zach Lavine  Kevin Durant   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jayson Tatum   Domantas Sabonis  Joel Embiid   Nikola Vucevic  Jaylen Brown   Bam Adebayo  My tiebreakers were based on winning and stuff like whether they actually show up to work.
"Clint Capela, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic  How would you rank those players"
The Dwight Howard trade to LA. Nikola Vucevic was just filler in a 4 team trade but probably ended up being the best player over that span
"Alex Len isn't good.  For real, if the Raptors are still trying to contend this year, I'd like to see the Raptors acquire Nikola Vucevic.  Not sure how though, since I imagine FVV and OG are untouchable.  The alternative could be Andre Drummond, but he doesn't fit the Raptors style-of-play at all."
Agreed. Here's who I'd have on the East team right now (no particular order):  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * Khris Middleton * Kevin Durant * Joel Embiid * Malcolm Brogdon * Jaylen Brown * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Julius Randle * Jrue Holiday * Bradley Beal

"This is the same with their first names. Like that reporter who was asking Jokic if his and Nikola Vucevic names were different. They say it right for him and for some reason call Jokic, KNEE COLA. How stupid is that?"
"He was an all star but had a huge drop off.   * 2018: 23/5/4 and 2.5 spg on 58% TS * 2019: 19/5/5 and 1.7 spg on 52% TS only 38 games played  East all stars were really weak that year. You had Nikola Vucevic, Victor Oladipo and D'angelo Russel all making it (not bad players by any means) and in the West you had Donovan Mitchell, Luka Dončić, Rudy Gobert, DeMar DeRozan, Draymond Green, Mike Conley and Marc Gasol all missing out. If he's in the West he's pretty solidly behind most of the aforementioned players and doesn't come close to a 2nd all star appearance."

"Shooting is the hardest imo - if you have the touch then you usually can already shoot by the time you get to the NBA. You can improve a non-shooter into an inconsistent shooter (low 30s % from 3) but it is exceedingly rare for a non or bad shooter to become a good shooter (high 30s to 40s% from 3).  By contrast I'd say the easiest is playmaking, which funnily enough is also often mentioned in this thread as a possible hardest. IMO there have been a ton of players that have *developed* decent to great playmaking skills:  * Paul George * Kawhi Leonard * Devin Booker * Bam Adebayo * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Russell Westbrook * James Harden * DeMar DeRozan * Nikola Vucevic * Kevin Love * Anthony Davis * Jimmy Butler * Kevin Durant * Karl-Anthony Towns * Blake Griffin  The list goes on and on, and what is common between these guys (with the exception of Bam) is that as their offensive responsibility increased scoring wise, they also had to develop playmaking as the next step of their evolution.   Stars in the NBA generally follow a similar path:  1. Good scorer 2. Better scorer because you learn how to get free throws 3. Better playmaker because that is the responsbility that comes with having the ball so much 4. Better defender"

"Maybe I'm a bit too high on Fox in the late 30s, but he's an exciting young talent. I like to give young, exciting players that improve on a year-to-year basis the benefit of the doubt that they can get even better.  Realistically he's probably ""only"" top 50. Gordon Hayward, Malcolm Brogdon, Fred VanVleet, Mike Conley, Marcus Smart, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic &amp; Co. would probably all be players you would rather have in a play-off series if it took place tomorrow."

"Plus there are TONS of other players who are good enough to be all stars like: Jason Tatum, Zion Williamson, ja morant, jaylen brown, devin booker, donavan Mitchell, Paul George, SGA, deaaron fox, jimmy butler, Kyle Lowry, khris middleton, Jamal Murray, KAT, bam adebayo, jrue holiday, Julius randle, domantas sabonis, Brandon Ingram, cj McCollum, klay thompson, demar derozan, Bradley Beal, Ben Simmons, Rudy gobert, Jerami Grant, Christian wood, Fred vanleet, kristaps porzingis, Zach Lavine,  nikola vucevic, d’anglo Russell, Andre Drummond, Gordon Hayward, Pascal Siakam, Collin sexton, mike Conley, this is not including the guys you said.

Same thing with Minnesota who KAT is their best player, but Anthony Edwards has played more.

Orlando Magic - 32 games played         Nikola Vucevic  - 32 games played  Indiana Pacers - 29 games played         Domantas Sabonis - 29 games played  Neither player has missed a game.
"Then going by your cherry picked stat, Nikola Vucevic (-11.8), Zach Lavine  (-6.7), Chris Paul (-.5), and Donovan Mitchell (-7.8), are all garbage and should not be included either since they make their teams worse. And this means that Michael Carter-Williams is the MVP of the league this year with an incredible +22.3. He improves his team more than anyone!  Sabonis is one of 3 players averaging 20/10/5  on 50% FG%. The others are Jokic and Giannis. He is the only player to ever average 20/10/5 and not make the All Star game. He is carrying the Pacers while they are down TJ Warren and Caris Levert. Saying he isn't very good is just not correct. And remains the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read."
"[Woj]: The East is lasering in on James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic for the all star reserves."
"[Charania] Sources: The East are tantalised by James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic. And the West are enamoured with Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis"
"West: Chris Paul, Paul George, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis   East: James Harden, Julius Randle, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Zach LaVine, Ben Simmons, Nikola Vucevic  Just a feeling I have"
"Well if we’re talking about European sport culture we might as well talk about soccer, and i don’t think it’s apples to oranges because they view teams and levels of play differently. In terms of European/foreign stars in the NBA, i haven’t seen a pattern of them demanding they leave when things don’t go well. Nikola jokic isn’t asking to leave, giannis isn’t ring chasing even tho his team has failed (by their standards) the last 3 years, Joel embiid screaming trust the process at every turn. Hell, nikola vucevic chilling down in Orlando and look at them. I don’t think it’s really a trend, no evidence for it."
Nikola Vucevic is pretty fair value but the Mavs may need to add a pick
"Trade for Nikola Vucevic.   trade would probably be steven adams, and JJ reddick and a butt ton of picks for Vucevic and Evan Fournier.  Both adams and JJ are expiring deals. magic who are currently 12th in the east would get a ton of cap space and a ton of picks to set up a rebuild. can build through fultz, isaac when he is healthy again, bacon, and get bamba more minutes. if the magic can find a bonifide star in the draft and pick up and sign a really good player (maybe like bringing back oladipo) while lowkey tanking this year.    Vucevic spaces the floor for Zion. plus Fournier can create his own shot and can be a guy who can get buckets off the bench."
"Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Domantas Sabonis, Bojan Bogdanovic, Nikola Vucevic, Goran Dragic"
"This is my prediction for the East All-Stars to provide some examples as to why the Raptors don't get in.      |PLAYER|TEAM|Conference|Position| :--|:--|:--|:--| |Joel Embiid|PHI|E|F| |Kevin Durant|BKN|E|F| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|MIL|E|F| |Bradley Beal|WAS|E|G| |Kyrie Irving|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Jayson Tatum|BOS|E|F| |Domantas Sabonis|IND|E|F| |Julius Randle|NYK|E|F| |Jaylen Brown|BOS|E|G| |James Harden|BKN|E|G| ||||| |Zach LaVine|CHI|E|G| |Trae Young|ATL|E|G| ||||| |Nikola Vucevic|ORL|*Unlucky Miss|F| |Bam Adebayo|MIA|*Unlucky Miss|F|       The Raptors two best chances for a spot are FVV, who I don't think is better than any of the 4 guards I listed in addition to the starters revealed. Then for Siakam I don't think he's better than Vuc or Bam who I think are going to be an unlucky miss among the forwards."
"I sat down and did this exercise before starters got announced:   I’d have:    EAST STARTERS G - James Harden G - Jaylen Brown F - Giannis Antetekounmpo F - Kevin Durant F - Joel Embiid  EAST RESERVES 1 - Kyrie Irving 2 - Jason Tatum 3 - Bam Adebayo 4 - Nikola Vucevic 5 - Ben Simmons 6 - Bradley Beal 7 - Domantas Sabonis ————— 1st OUT - Jimmy Butler 2nd OUT - Zach LaVine 3rd OUT - Trae Young 4th OUT - Julius Randle 5th OUT -  Khris Middleton 6th OUT - Fred Vanvleet 7th OUT - Jerami Grant 8th OUT - Gordon Hayward 9th OUT - Jrue Holiday 10th OUT - Tobias Harris 11th OUT - Malcom Brogdan  I could see reasonable arguments for all the guys listed there and the high scoring bad team guys are admittedly the toughest to deal with.  Hell, there are probably a few omissions there too -  but IMO all these guys are having the kind of seasons where a ton of players will get shafted.   Each has a great cases depending on your own personal criteria."
"Surely it's tempting to hope you stay in the lottery to somehow pick up Jalen Green?      **Starters:** Markelle Fultz, Jalen Green, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic.    **Bench:** Cole Anthony, Dwayne Bacon, Terrence Ross, Chuma Okeke, Mo Bamba."
Few would know that the answer is Nikola Vucevic
You know who would look fucking fantastic in a Raptors jersey? FG% leader Orlando Magic big Man Nikola Vucevic
"You looking at Nikola?  No, I'm looking at Vucevic."
"&gt; ""If most fans were asked to answer who currently leads the league in field goals made during the 2020-21 season thus far, few would know that the answer is Orlando Magic big man Nikola Vucevic.""  Dangerous for them to assume that many fans have even heard of Nikola Vucevic."

You’re talking out of your ass here because Nikola Vucevic doesn’t draw fouls at all lmao And he never been one to draw fouls after all these years with all his moves in the post. He would easily average 25ppg if he could just learn some uptake from Jonas Valunciunas
nikola vucevic barring a trade or miracle Magic renaissance.
"Nikola Vucevic better be an All-Star, goddamnit."
Luka is one of the worst offenders - players who don't get a whistle are Nikola Vucevic and probably a couple other dudes that I don't watch often

This is all true but doesn’t mean you have to play so inefficiently. I use this example because I’m a magic fan but Nikola Vucevic is shooting incredibly efficient right now and he plays for a bad team but doesn’t have a superstar to play with. That team is so injury riddled they did not even have an available PG last night (all four are injured) and all of the other 4 starters are injured.

That Nikola Vucevic is still first in FGA?
"It’s not that hard to pick out the MVP. Raw ppg does it like half the time. Here are some players that are top 20 in the league in PER-  Clint Capela Nikola Vucevic Montrezl Harrel  Jonas Valanciunas  It’s an awful stat that can’t measure defense and way overvalues rebounding. Even the guy who made the stat doesn’t think it’s relevant anymore. Stuff like RAPTOR, RPM, and LEBRON are able to use on/off and tracking data to give a clearer picture. There’s really no point in using PER, Win Shares or BPM anymore."
"The Hawks have been missing Cam Reddish, DeAndre Hunter, Okongwu for the first 20 games, now we are missing John Collins, before we had Capela go down, then Bogdanovic and then Gallo.  Heck, when we had Rondo, he barely played and we STILL haven't played a single minute with Dunn.  Every club has injuries.  Even the Lakers and even the Celtics.  The core of the team is Tatum first and then Brown.  When you have those two all-stars, most teams don't need more than that.  The problem with the Celtics is that they are top heavy.  After Tatum and Brown, you don't have any starter caliber players.   Fournier is not a star.  The Magic with him, Ross, Gordon and Nikola Vucevic still looked bad.  Then IMHO, they trade for Fournier but should have traded for Vucevic.  The problem is your GM, Danny Ainge.  Outside of Tatum and Brown, nothing.  Could have had James Harden."

The difference between Chris Paul and nikola vucevic is that Chris Paul is still one of the best point guards in the league and nikola Vucevic is a fringe eastern conference all star who only plays one on side of the floor.
&gt; How did Hayward not make the all star team?   Kevin Durant  Domatas Sabonis  Julius Randle  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  Jayson Tatum  Jaylen Brown  Ben Simmons  Joel Embiid  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Nikola Vucevic  Zach Lavine  Bradley Beal
"&gt; It's very clearly a flaw in the system that allows the rich to get richer at no cost.      I mean, technically by your logic the rich aren't getting richer because they are signing for the vet minimum.      You can create a new system all you want, teams will find out a way to get around it. In these instances, the teams are not being forced to keep the player for the remainder of the season, it makes them look better because players will see that the team takes their situations into consideration. And it's not like it's Nikola Vucevic forcing the Magic to buy him out and then him trotting over to LA or Brooklyn. These are over the hill vets who want a shot at the championship. Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge are the 4th or 5th option **at best** respectively as a scoring option on the floor with Durant/Harden/Irving. Then you need to take into account, arguably, the best 3 pt shooter in the league in Joe Harris, if he's on the floor, those guys are below him IMO.      Just admit you're upset because it's not *your* team like the memes above."

"&gt;If Evan Fournier Aaron Gordon Nikola Vucevic were so good why could they not win together?  Because only Vucevic was playing constantly in a high level.   Fournier is a good player, and would be excellent as a leader of the second unit, but only good as a starter.  Gordon, probably due to his injuries, never became the player that everyone expected.  And lastly, because the rest of the team (with some exceptions) was never very good."

"Nikola Vucevic, for he is all I have"
Its honestly incredible that we almost scored 100. Its also honestly incredible that 4 starters have been injured this long. Every magic game is just a Nikola vucevic show right now 😂
"Imagine giving the MVP to Nikola Vucevic because with him the magic would be in a play in game but without him they would be picking in the top 3 of the draft or to Bradley Beal besause without him the Wizards would only win 8 games vs 30.   When I grew up watching ball, it was about which player was the most important piece on a team that actually did something during the regular season. Somewhere along the line it changed to who has the best stats on X bottom seed that won't make it out the first round."

He's shooting 6-for-17 (35.3 percent) against Gasol and has more turnovers (5) than assists (4)."
"I agree. IMO You're in the perfect position to finally get a high-level teammate for Nikola vucevic. If you don't end up with a top 4 pick, you trade Vuc in the offseason."

"I'll go with current players.   1. Joe Ingles: Large part of Jazz's success. Great playmaker, defender, shooter.  2. Nikola Vucevic: Probably the 4th best Center behind Jokic, Embiid, Gobert.

"So the Lakers running pick and rolls with the ball in Lebron's hands is done to help him pad his stats? Why doesn't he just give it to AD in the post and get out of his way?   Of course it isn't, when you've got an all time great playmaker like lebron or Jokic you play to their strengths. You think if Jokic played more like Nikola Vucevic then the Nuggets without Murray, Barton, Morris and Dozier would be racking up wins?

Probably. Nikola Vucevic came over to the U.S. when he was in High School and his accent is nonexistent

I think he has an argument, but it isn’t easily."
"Haha, Vlatko has done a pretty solid job. But, more Serbians couldn't hurt.   Anyways a great little anectode depicting Joker and Vlatko's relationship -   Once Jokic was getting outplayed by Vucevic in the first half and at halftime Vlatko within earshot of Jokic, say's to his teammates ""“Damn! I didn’t know Nikola Vučević was that good!”. Jokic proceeded to absolutely tear Vucevic apart in the 2nd half."
Don’t forget about Nikola Vucevic
"Agreed, but they have only recently been good, Dragic, Doncic...    Lithuania has been for a long time, they have won 3 Eurobaskets and been a runner-up 2 times and have 3 Olympic bronze medals... that is quite impressive.  &amp;#x200B;  Another country that I find impressive these last couple years is Montenegro, only 600.000 inhabitants, yet have given us Nikola Vucevic, Nikola Mirotic and Nikola Pekovic."
"Jokic, Pekovic, Vucevic... Never pass up a Nikola in the draft."
His parents blended Nikola jokic and Nikola vucevic
"Are any of those guys top 30 though?   Semi ordered ranking:   1. LeBron James  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Nikola Jokic  5. Anthony Davis 6. James Harden  7. Steph Curry  8.

Khris Middleton   30. Jaylen Brown   Then you've got guys like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, Nikola Vucevic, Malcolm Brogdon, Domas Sabonis, Gordon Hayward, CJ McCollum, Kyle Lowry, Brandon Ingram, DeMar DeRozan, Mike Conley, Christian Wood that you could argue for the next 10 spots or maybe as high as 25-30th?"
"Are we comparing Nikola Vucevic vs Bam Adebayo? Or are we comparing Kelly Olynyk vs Nerlens Noel?  I think in most cases, you take the defensively versatile big because that's easier to build around. But in some cases (teams like the Bucks or Lakers), the stretch big might be the better option."

Nikola Vucevic is up there
"I mean there is something important to be taken from the fact that, say, Khris Middleton's teams consistently win a lot of games while Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic don't. Khris Middleton provides a bigger impact on winning games than guys like that, on/off based stats reveal it. Plus RAPTOR etc. all try to isolate teammate effect so not all good players on bad teams are rated as average, Towns is rated very well"

"He played in 76% of games last season and was healthy for 86% of the games last season.   He's played in around 66% of games this year and will most likely hit around 70+% by the season is over.

He was only 5 games less than Anthony Davis and Nikola Vucevic.   The same folks that hate on him in /r/mavericks are the same so-called therapists and body language experts who are analyizing his body language and claiming that because he didn't go make out with Luka after his game-winner that he was somehow upset that he didn't get the last second shot and is a cancer to the team."

"1. Stephen Curry: Literally the reason I got into basketball was Curry during the 2014-15 run. Then at the beginning of 2015-16 I became a massive fan of the Warriors solely cuz of Curry. I still watch almost every Warriors game cuz of Curry, and he is the reason I care about basketball tbh. Watching the 35 ft game winner live is one of my most cherished memories, I literally ran throughout my house screaming for a minute straight when it went in. 2. Kobe Bryant: My dad used to be a Laker fan back in the Magic era and until basically they sucked (not his fault he stopped watching, my mom refused to watch the Lakers get trashed often at some point lol). I could only watch him near the end of the his career, but he was my favorite player back when I didn't know much about basketball. 3. Klay Thompson: I will never forget Game 6 vs OKC, that was one of the greatest performances in NBA history imo. He is the quintissential 3 point shooter imo, his three point shot is the most perfect form I have ever seen. 4. Damian Lillard: Dame is very similar to Curry in play-style. I just love his ""Logo Lillard"" shots and overall clutch-ness. 5. Zach Lavine: Between his athleticism and his shooting, his game is so asthetically pleasing to me. I really hope he and Vuc have a fruitful career together in Chicago and maybe even win a ring, two of my fav players in the league rn. 6. Kyrie Irving: Off the court he is pretty stupid, but his game is super asthetically pleasing imo. His handles are literally insane, I love when he fakes defenders really badly. 7. Ja Morant: His athleticism is INSANE!!! I hope he develops a 3 point shot to improve. 8. Nikola Vučević: Overall as you can probably tell from this list, I'm not a big fan of most forwards/centers. I like Vucevic because he doesn't just play bully ball and flop around in the post like a lot of other players, his game is so smooth imo. 9. Lamelo Ball: The flashiness! His passing is so cool, I hope he blossoms into a superstar. 10. Kemba Walker: I always loved Kemba with the Hornets. I know he wasn't ever particularly efficient, but to me his game is pretty asthetically pleasing as well.  HM: De'Aaron Fox, CJ McCollum, Kevin Durant, Vince Carter, Damion Lee, Kent Bazemore, Donovan Mitchell, Tony Parker, Pau Gasol, Rajon Rondo, David West, Wilt Chamberlain (or the idea of him, I obv didn't watch him play but the mystery about him is so interesting to me. Also I think he would literally be a god-level player in today's league)  So overall, I love shooters and explosive guards more than any other types of players. I'd love to discuss this more to, if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"So, to be clear, you think the team would do better swapping out Giannis for, say, Nikola Vucevic? Domantis Sabonis? To be fair, you did say 'borderline allstar' so maybe that means not quite an allstar. Gordon Hayward? De'Aaron Fox?  The game came down to a free throw game - so you tell me what non all-star you plug in instead of Giannis to re-do the game that you think will win it."
"Nikola Vucevic, scores all his points in the first half and disappears as the game goes along. Yea he finished with 25 points but he had 3 in 4th quarter and couldn’t get a bucket when the team needed it most. Plus he’s a trash defender"
"Here's a good chunk of them hanging out during the bubble.   &gt;[Among the group was his Trail Blazers teammate Mario Hezonja, Goran Dragic of Miami Heat, Nikola Jokic and Vlatko Cancar of the Denver Nuggets, Luka Doncic and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks, Nikola Vucevic of the Orlando Magic and Ivica Zubac of the Los Angeles Clippers.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)  &gt;[Nurkic is from Bosnia, Zubac and Hezonja are from Croatia, Vucevic resides from Montenegro, Dragic, Doncic, Cancar all hail from Slovenia, and Marjanovic and Jokic grew up in Serbia.](https://sports.yahoo.com/jusuf-nurkic-mario-hezonja-break-163547634.html)"
Enes Kanter  Jarrett Allen  Nikola Vucevic  Taj Gibson
"Yes, you get Goran along with Boban and Nikola Vucevic coming off the bench."

"I think the max they each could have taken was either 16 or 17 and they took 14.5 or something. It wasn’t some massive pay cut you are trying to make it out to be, nor anything remotely close to Kawhi taking 10 a year, 20M less than he’s actually making. Stop it.   You people are so hyperbolic. Chris Bosh was the equivalent to Demarr Derozan on the Raptors or Kemba Walker on the hornets. He was far closer to a Nikola Vucevic than an NBA superstar."
"Bulls taking over the league next year with our big 3: Zach lavine, nikola vucevic, and Troy brown Jr."
It's about as rational as making an MVP case for Nikola Vucevic
"&gt;Couldnt tell you, saw it earlier in the year on this sub.  So, you once again can't provide evidence.  &gt;Just looking at some stats now, and devonte graham is 24th in defensive win shares. Rudy gobert is 9th in win shares for the whole league. Nikola vucevic is 14th in player impact estimate. Hmmm stats seem very telling, wouldn't you agree?     So when a stat disagrees with you, it's good. When a stat agrees with you, it's bad. Maybe, your eye test isn't accurate and with context, box score, advanced stats and unbiased eye tests all put together, we can piece together a more accurate image?  Nope, your eye test is above all."

"I'm pretty sure if Kevin Love or Nikola Vucevic did the same to Boston, they'd also throw a bottle at him."
"I’ll raise you one Lauri Markkanen and Nikola Vucevic. I love Vucevic but he’s so bad defensively, half the time he doesn’t even put his hand up to at least look like he’s trying."

"the Robin Lopez isos can be ugly but with a Scott Brooks' half court offense generally speaking it's been the best play for weeks now lol  &gt; Among NBA players with at least 100 post-ups this season, Lopez has been the most efficient, according to Synergy Sports. More than Vucevic. More than Joel Embiid. More than Nikola Jokic. Entering play Sunday, the Wizards were scoring 122.9 points per 100 possessions on plays that end in his shots, turnovers or passes out of the post, putting him well atop the league.  ^^ From 4/26 Athletic [article](https://theathletic.com/2542845/2021/04/26/the-hookman-mild-mannered-robin-lopez-has-become-a-wizards-low-post-superhero/)"
"Nikola Jokic   Joel Embiid   Rudy Gobert   KAT   Clint Capela   Nikola Vucevic   Bam Adebayo   Myles Turner    I think he’s around top 10, I guess depending on how you classify some guys like AD, Wood, etc.  Are there any obvious centers I’m missing who you rate over Nurk?"

"1. Washington Wizards: Karl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota Timberwolves  The Wizards already have a strong backcourt with Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook. Those two have powered Washington back into the playoffs, but they still need help. Robin Lopez has been a nice backup center and Alex Len is starting but Washington can still upgrade here. Putting Towns onto this team would make it even more dangerous offensively and make life easier on Beal and Westbrook. Plus, seeing Towns and Joel Embiid go at it in the first round would be very fun. — Mike Vorkunov  2. Boston Celtics: Zach LaVine, G, Chicago Bulls  The Celtics lost Jaylen Brown to injury and could use another dynamic player in the backcourt along with Jayson Tatum. A LaVine-Tatum duo would have enough juice to keep up with Brooklyn’s Big 3 in Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving. The Celtics are certainly going to miss Brown’s defense, but I also think the Nets have so much firepower on the floor that the Celtics need someone else who could also get buckets, and LaVine is one of the best scorers in the NBA. — Chris Kirschner   3. Golden State Warriors/Memphis Grizzlies: Brandon Ingram, W, New Orleans Pelicans  The Warriors could use another bucket-getter, and so could the Grizzlies, so why not the best one available: Brandon Ingram. A 6-foot-8 wing who can score at all three levels, create a shot and was an excellent spot-up shooter this season, Ingram next to Steph Curry or Ja Morant would be a lot of fun. The league needs to adopt this fantasy we’ve created. — James Edwards  4. Miami Heat: De’Aaron Fox, PG, Sacramento Kings  The Heat had a top-10 defense during the regular season but were the 18th-ranked offense in the NBA. Fox would add some explosiveness to the Heat and a solid option as a pick-and-roll creator. Fox’s ability to put pressure on the rim — as well as finish when he gets there — would open up more room for Miami’s shooters. — Edwards  5. Atlanta Hawks: LaMelo Ball, PG, Charlotte Hornets   The Hawks traded for Lou Williams to give them a better scorer off the bench than what Rajon Rondo was providing before the deadline. While Williams does have the ability to take over games with his experience, he’s inconsistent. Having Ball on the roster would give the Hawks an elite playmaker who could make life so much easier for the second unit shotmakers like Danilo Gallinari and Kevin Huerter. Plus, a Young and Ball backcourt, if they were to play together, would provide endless AND1-mixtape highlights and make the Hawks the most entertaining team in the league. — Kirschner  6. New York Knicks: Kyle Lowry, PG, Toronto Raptors  Extremely Chandler Bing voice: Can you be any more of a Tom Thibodeau player than Lowry? The Knicks need a point guard — it’s their greatest position of need — and Lowry is the best available. He’d slide right into the starting lineup, taking Elfrid Payton’s minutes, and give New York a fiery, playoff-proven guard who can defend and shoot well. Lowry would also splash some playmaking to a team that needs to give help to Julius Randle and experience to a roster that isn’t long on it. And he gets to hound Trae Young in round one. — Vorkunov  7. Los Angeles Lakers: Pascal Siakam, W, Toronto Raptors  I’m just going with the best wing available here. Siakam, like every Raptors player, didn’t have a smooth year but he still averaged 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, and he just made the All-NBA second team last season. He’ll add playmaking and scoring from the wing without diminishing the Lakers defense at all, which adding someone like Nikola Vucevic here might have. Imagine a LeBron James/Siakam/Anthony Davis frontcourt with Alex Caruso hounding ballhandlers in the frontcourt. That’s fierce. — Vorkunov  8. Portland Trail Blazers: Jerami Grant, W, Detroit Pistons  Grant had a breakout season with the Pistons and showed he has more to his game than meets the eye. The Blazers could very much use a solid-to-good wing defender, and Grant provides that. Additionally, he’d fit in nicely as a third scoring option next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Grant can create for himself and also netted a respectable 1.006 points per possession as a spot-up shooter this season. A Lillard/McCollum/Norman Powell/Grant lineup would be a blast to watch. — Kirschner  9. Dallas Mavericks: Nikola Vucevic, C, Chicago Bulls  Mark Cuban gets to add another tall European player? What a dream! Vucevic, Kristaps Porzingis and Luka Doncic would make for a high-scoring trio, but the defense would likely be their biggest concern. How would they stop Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the first round of the playoffs? — Kirschner  10. Milwaukee Bucks: Fred VanVleet, G, Toronto Raptors  VanVleet’s efficiency dipped a bit this season, but he’s still a bad man. He’d fit in nicely in the backcourt with Jrue Holiday (they’d be must-see television on the defensive end), and would provide another reliable spacing option for the Bucks. He has also played in big moments. The Bucks, trying to shake their postseason woes, could use someone with the moxie VanVleet carries. It also wouldn’t be a bad idea to limit the Donte DiVincenzo Experience. — Edwards  11. Los Angeles Clippers: DeMar DeRozan, F, San Antonio Spurs  One of the biggest question marks for the Clippers is who’s their third player to take the burden off of Kawhi and Paul George? DeRozan could be that guy for them. He has shown himself to be a team player and someone who has no problem relinquishing shots to other guys on the floor. — Kirschner  12. Denver Nuggets: Terry Rozier, G, Charlotte Hornets Obviously the Nuggets have to make up for Jamal Murray’s absence somehow and although Rozier isn’t the same on-ball playmaker and scorer as Murray, he can give Denver some high upside variance they need. Rozier averaged 20.4 points-per-game this season and hit 39 percent of his 3s; that’ll play alongside Nikola Jokic. — Vorkunov  13. Brooklyn Nets: Harrison Barnes, F, Sacramento Kings The Nets don’t really have weaknesses, so it’d be fun to add a player who could fit into their lineup and still possibly play in crunch time. Barnes is that guy with size and shooting (39 percent on 3s) that he can fit in well. He missed the last 11 games with a core injury, but it seems to be the kind that he would come back from if he were in the postseason. — Vorkunov  14. Philadelphia 76ers: D’Angelo Russell, G, Minnesota Timberwolves  The 76ers could use another scorer at the guard position, and that’s what Russell is. His weaknesses as a defender could be masked by the several other great defenders Philadelphia has, so all he would have to focus on is scoring the basketball and be a secondary playmaker.  — Kirschner  15. Phoenix Suns: Christian Wood, F/C, Houston Rockets  The Suns’ biggest weakness is their frontcourt, and, due to his ability to space the floor, Wood is someone you could play alongside Deandre Ayton or make a focal point of the second unit. Chris Paul-Wood pick-and-pops would be fun. Just thinking of the Suns-Lakers series alone, there’s no stopping Anthony Davis, but at least Wood would be able to reciprocate some of the scoring after getting the ball out of the net. — Edwards  16. Utah Jazz: Collin Sexton, G, Cleveland Cavaliers  What do you give someone who has everything? I’m not sure, which is why I’m bad at getting gifts. So, for the best regular-season team in the NBA, I’m going to go with the best bucket-getter available: Collin Sexton. You can never have too much scoring in the playoffs, especially with the Lakers, Suns and Clippers all having top-10 defenses."
"He left out Nikola Vucevic who is from Montenegro. OP only put players from Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia. North Macedonia and Montenegro (and Kosovo although some people don’t consider that an independent country) were also parts of Yugoslavja."
"Think of the team we could have had. nikola vucevic , Jrue Holiday, maybe iggy for a couple years longer. and mid tier picks"
"Not really. If Domantas Sabonis and Nikola Vucevic are making the team, it's not a crowded spot (Bam should have been ahead of both of them)"
Gasol shut down 3 All Star bigs during that title run:  - Nikola Vucevic (11.3 pts/g on .436 TS%)  - Joel Embiid (17.6 pts/g on .529 TS%)  - Giannis Antetokounmpo (22.7 pts/g on .518 TS%)
"Vucevic also went from averaging 20.8 points to averaging 8.5 points a game that playoffs too.   https://ca.nba.com/news/toronto-raptors-marc-gasol-defense-nikola-vucevic-2019-nba-playoffs/c6xvkhmojq4k17z84n3tlc250  &gt; According to NBA.com, Gasol has defended him for 88 of the 114 possessions he's been on the floor in Games 1 and 2. He's shooting 6-for-17 (35.3 percent) against Gasol and has more turnovers (5) than assists (4)."
"As a Bulls fan looking for a PG to fit alongside Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic I would go with:  1 Malcolm Brogdon  2 Spencer Dinwiddie  3 Fred VanVleet  Brogdon *slightly* edges out the others in some more advanced stats like TS% or PER but it's very slight.  Dinwiddie is the best facilitator of the group, but again it's only a slight edge.  For the Bulls it'd come down to the best on ball defender as that's currently a weakness on the roster in guarding other elite PGs in the NBA."
He played today just in a Nikola Vucevic costume
"I am optimistic since the decision makers for the Bulls are entirely new.  I expect Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic, Pat Williams and *maybe* Coby White to still be on the team next season, but outside of those four, it could easily be a brand new squad."
"""Yo lemme do you *juuuust* a little worse"" - Nikola Vucevic, 8th-9th seed 1st rd exit/miss playoffs"
"Although Nikola Mirotic doesn't play for Montenegro, but Spain. Which is a bummer, because Montenegro is actually already damn good with Vucevic and Tyrese Rice. They qualified for the Euros and even the worlds and have even qualified for the KO stages in the Euros... now put Mirotic on top of that. In their prime they could have had a team with Vucevic, Mirotic, Pekovic and Rice."
"My breakout list is...  Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton, Johnathan Isaac.  &amp;#x200B;  My fall off list is...  Russell Westbrook, Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic."

"I wouldn’t trust OG to guard Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Russell Westbrook, De’Aaron Fox, Ja Morant, Jamal Murray, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Zach LaVine, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns, DeAndre Ayton, or Nikola Vucevic for an entire game (not just a switch).  I’d trust Ben to do that for any of those players.  O.G. is a better asset but not the better defender.  Simmons is faster, stronger, and smarter."
"Bulls are up there...  This is their current guaranteed roster:  Nikola Vucevic ($24,000,000) Zach LaVine ($19,500,000) Al-Farouq Aminu ($10,183,800) Patrick Williams ($7,422,000) Thaddeus Young ($6,000,000) Coby White ($5,837,760) Troy Brown ($5,170,564) Tomas Satoransky ($5,000,000)  And then Lauri Markkanen ($9,026,852 qualifying offer / $20,194,524 cap hold)  That’s basically the cap and they went 12-17 after the Vuc trade. He’s 30 and they have him on the books for two more years. They traded what became the 8th pick for him, along with Wendell Carter Jr., and their 2023 pick.  What do they do to get better? How do they become a high caliber team? Maybe Lauri and Lavine make a leap. I sure hope so, I’m rooting for them."
"Not trying to be a homer but:  1. Jokic  2. Embiid  3. Gobert 4. Towns  Whose the fifth guy you’re putting above Ayton? I’m comfortable putting those first four ahead based on track record but is it really crazy to have Ayton above, like, Domantas Sabonis and Nikola Vucevic?"
"Any bottom half team like the Bulls needs to take notes from what the Hawks did. They need to build around a strong core; Zach Lavine and Nikola Vucevic, this doesn’t mean bringing in another scorer, but rather, bring in several veteran scorers who are accustomed to winning and are comfortable with coming off the bench. There’s no need to tank especially after so many years."
"So basically what your saying is that if a player doesn't become a star in two years then the team should look to off load them and start over. Not like Lavine didn't become a 20PPG scorer until his 4th year in the league to this last year having the best statistical season of his career entering his prime. Coby and Patrick are both young and have the potential to improve their game just like every other player. Even if the Bulls decide to trade Coby for an upgrade at PG, a trio of Lavine, Vucevic, and the potential of Patrick is a good core to have, even knowing Lauri will potentially walk this year. Let's let them go a full season with Nikola, and a 2nd year Patrick Williams, before we start making assumptions that this team cannot contend,"
"Philadelphia's win percentage the last four seasons:  63%, 62%, 59% and 68%.  Across those four seasons Embiid missed a combined 80 games in the regular season.  Are you seriously suggesting that Philadelphia would have won more games if we'd replaced Embiid with a very good centre?  That having full seasons of say Bam Adebayo, Clint Capela or Nikola Vucevic will make Philadelphia a consistent 58+ win team?  If so, let's trade him now!  But I think, instead, it's showing that ABILITY IS THE BEST ABILITY."
I’ll take what seems to be Evan Mobley and Scottie Barnes over Nikola Vucevic
"Bulls get:   * Andrew Wiggins  * James Wiseman   * 7, 14 picks this year   Warriors get:  * Nikola Vucevic   * Thad Young  The Warriors do it to go win now, swapping project players for established contributors. We re-sign Oubre in this scenario and run Steph/Klay/Oubre/Dray/Vucevic with Poole/Juan/Thad/Looney off the bench. Just need one more guard in free agency and we’re set to contend. Austin rivers with the MLE maybe?  The Bulls do it to rapidly build around Lavine. I think a team with Lavine/Vucevic as it’s core isn’t going to do anything, so they need to pivot to really take a step forward. The Warriors assets move them in that direction. Let’s say they sign and trade Markkanen for a PG, maybe Rubio. They can compete with Rubio/Zach/Wiggins/PatWil/Theis while developing Coby, Wiseman, and the 7th/14th picks"
"Hassan Whiteside? This is trolling. That dude had one season where he was good and then looked awful immediatiely.  Also, Roy Hibbert's one and half seasons being good was better than anything some of these dudes did... Nikola Vucevic spent a whole decade doing nothing."
"1 wiseman was a rookie last year who played 3 games as a freshman in Memphis before his season ended.  2 IMO, Bigs like wiseman don’t fit well in what GS likes to do offensively. So judging him off of those factors are premature to say he’s not going to end up as a good NBA player  3 What do Steph Curry, DeMar Derozan, Paul George, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Vucevic, Jimmy Butler, CJ McCollum, Giannis, Julius Randle, Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Damontas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Donovan Mitchell, Collin Sexton and MPJ all have in common?  Don’t act like later round lottery draft picks don’t turn into all-star caliber, even MVP caliber nba players"
&gt; And five more: Bam Adebayo (No. 14 in 2017); Domantas Sabonis (No. 11 in 2016); Pascal Siakam (No. 27 in 2016); Nikola Vucevic (No. 16 in 2011); Zach LaVine (No. 13 in 2014).  I feel like Brogdon was a bigger steal than Sabonis.
"Zach Lavine, Nikola Vucevic, and Coby White."
"Larry Hughes, Shaquille Harrisson, Stephen Jackson,  Charles Oakley, Moses Brown, Isaiah Thomas, Bill Walton, Nikola Vucevic, Bob Cousy, Scottie Barnes, Dennis Johnson, Reggie Jackson..."
1. Jayson Tatum 2. Jaylen Brown 3. Marcus Smart 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Kyrie Irving 7. Spencer Dinwiddie 8. Julius Randle 9. Derrick Rose 10. Joel Embiid 11. Tobias Harris 12.

2022: Nikola Vucevic   2023: Zach Lavine   2024: Lauri Markkanen   2025: Coby White   2026: Patrick Williams
"Jokic, Gasol, Kat, Sabonis, and Bam are the top 5 for play making centers. Embiid is not nearly as good as any of these 5 players as a passer.   Al Horford - 4.5 assists per game over the last 7 seasons. Better assist to turnover ratio than Embiid  Nikola Vucevic - Pretty self explanatory here. Could be in the top 5 honestly.   These two are also better so that’s 7 right there. There aren’t many good centers in the NBA. It’s easily the weakest position.  So back at 8th-10th he’s competing with players like Nurkic for play making.  Being 8th-10th among centers isn’t that good compared to being 8th-10th among PGs or Forwards.   He’s better than average for the current lineup of centers in the league but as a player compared to the rest of the league, he’s a mediocre play maker."
"The NBA markets big stars. Luka, Giannis, Jokic are marketed pretty heavily. Booker was plastered everywhere as the next Kobe after his 70 point game, the Suns prolonging their rebuild and losing out on that hype is solely on them. Trae is the league's favorite young villain right now, he's gonna be on national tv a lot more now that his team is winning. Hell, this sub has been fuming because the pelicans were being overadvertised despite being a bad team all year thanks to the league being in love with Zion.   The Pacers and the Jazz were marketed in the 90s because of Reggie Miller and Malone/Stockton, not to run some small market charity. Get a generational talent, your team will get air time. The league not exuberantly advertising Nikola Vucevic or Kemba Walker isn't a wild anti-small market conspiracy lol."
"You literally said yourself that his “perception improved” because of Vucevic which is simply fucking stupid. You were talking about perception and I responded on the same subject. Not sure how my reply is “knobhead” material for mentioning perception and yours isn’t. NBA GMs also don’t make trades based on Nikola Vucevic playing next to a guy for a handful of games, what an absurd point. No shit the main driving force in his value is his efficiency. But you’re being an absolute blockhead if you can’t acknowledge or grasp the logical parallels between Booker and Lavine and their perceptions. I didn’t even say shit about GMs or trade value, just “perception” which you mentioned first and now you act like it’s ridiculous to discuss. You’re just being condescending to feel smart."
"The Process needs to get more flak for the misses they had over the years.  Sure Simmons and Embiid are nice, but they swung and missed on a *lot* of lottery picks and/or solid veterans that are not on the team anymore.  Markelle Fultz (#1), Ben Simmons (#1), Evan Turner (#2), Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), Elfrid Payton (#10), Michale Carter Williams (#11), Nikola Vucevic (#16), Thad Young (#12), ~~Jrue Holiday (#17)~~ Nerlens Noel (#6)"
"The real question is what if every NBA player with the surname ending in “ic” just formed an Eastern European basketball squad go play against an iteration of Team USA.  You’d have Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Vucevic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Bojan Bogdanovic, Boban Marjanovich, Jusuf Nurkic, and Goran Dragic.  That in and of itself of NBA players is a ridiculously good team and would probably require the BEST American NBA players to commit to beat."
"&gt; It’s kinda crazy a guy scoring 26 PPG in the regular season isn’t considered a superstar nowadays  You realize Jerami Grant of the Pistons averaged 22.3 ppg which was 23rd best in the league.  Victor Oladipo averaged 21.2 ppg on the Rockets  Nikola Vucevic averaged 23.4 ppg on the Magic, 21st best in the league  EVERY team has to have someone scoring 20 something because someone has to score or else every game would be a 20+ point spread."
Nikola vucevic. Rim protection might be ass but on offense you got budget jokic and zion. Naisu
They took Nikola Vucevic who would been perfect fit for Boston but we decide get his teammate
"Somewhere right now Nikola Vucevic is smiling, proud of Khris"
"Perkins, Dwight, Laimbeer, Jayson Williams, and Nikola Vucevic seem easy to hate."
* Tobias Harris  * Malcolm Brogdon  * Nikola Vucevic  * Robert Covington
"Chicago still is able to bring in all star caliber players. That's more than most other teams can say. Even if they aren't the LeBron/Durant tier players, they consistently have brought in All Star level guys since Jordan retired, despite being a middling franchise.  Anyone of Pau Gasol, Carlos Boozer, Rajon Rondo, Dwyane Wade, DeMar DeRozan, Nikola Vucevic (trade) and Ben Wallace were all coming off of all star seasons and/or were still all stars in Chicago. They aren't the premier FAs but they are still star players and anyone of these FAs would be one of the biggest FA signings for probably 15 other franchises. These guys are all within a \~10 year span too. Chicago is definitely in the tier 2 of FA destinations, alongside the Knicks and maybe the Celtics &amp; Rockets. With tier 1 being Miami, LA, Brooklyn, Golden State.  IMO:  * Tier 1: Team location is a major driving force to signing there * Tier 2: Team location helps, but current team status is also important * Tier 3: Team location doesn't help or hurt FA signing (i.e. Atlanta, Denver, Dallas etc...) * Tier 4: Team location hurts, but team success can negate it (i.e. San Antonio, Milwaukee) * Tier 5: Team location is a big detractor for FAs (Utah, OKC)"

Kawhi Leonard and Nikola Vucevic  are up there for sure
"&gt;I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is pretentious.  If you are taking that from a pure text comment on the internet, then that says more about you than me.  But, I already said in my first message that I couldn't think of a comparative trade being close to the same value, so if you just put a response about what you think, without backing it up with anything, yeah, you should expect people to call you on it.  &gt;He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then.  His statline this past year was a rounding error off from the previous year, despite COVID and displacement craziness. The only stat that dropped considerably was his three point percentage, but his other shooting stats all improved, most importantly his midrange stats (he was up about 10% from 10-16 and about the same from 16-3p, on increased volume) and his free throw rate (a classic indicator of shooting ability, which jumped above 80% for the first time in his career).  He also improved his playmaking this past year, up a full assist over the previous year, with turnovers going down.  I used the ""has made an All-NBA team"" thing so I didn't have to deal with the ""but he's not an All-NBA player just because he made one"" argument. I'm sure there are plenty of players who made an All-NBA team that you disagree with, but the fact that none of them got traded for a package the size you are talking about is the point.  &gt;Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing  This is probably the closest comp out there for a deal the level you are talking. It was considered a steal of a deal at the time, but Cousins was a notoriously problematic personality (which had been a concern going right back to College, and the reason why he dropped to the Kings in the draft). He was a dominant player, but he was also suspended several times by both the team and league for unprofessional behaviour. He also was traded with a year and a half left on his deal, and Sacramento was going to lose him in free agency if they didn't deal him.  He never actually even led the Kings to the playoffs, either, but he did make All-NBA, so there is some similarity. Still, it does represent the bottom of the market on that type of player (before even considering the context), and I like to think of Masai as being better than Vlade Divac at his job.  &gt;Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  This one isn't comparable, though. Vucevic was 30 at the time of the trade and had never been anything more than a borderline all star player. He has never gotten a single All-NBA vote, let alone made a team. It's a package comparable to the one you are talking about, but for a much lesser and older player, with less team control."
"I just want to say that the way you discuss basketball is incredibly pretentious. You request information as if you’re talking to your secretary or you’re a teacher requesting homework from a student. It’s obnoxious and something you should work on.  For the record, Siakam’s value is not “all nba level player”. I personally don’t give a shit that he’s made a single all nba team. He had a couple of good months and has regressed pretty consistently since then. He’s a fringe all star and not a top 15/20 player in the league. He’s closer to top 30-40. Players as good as Siakam get traded every single year. I’ll give you some examples, but I guarantee you that your response is going to either be “this player isn’t as good as Siakam” or “that package is better than the one we’re discussing now”. There is no example that will cause you to actually change your opinion, but I’ll give it a try.  1. Demarcus Cousins (roughly as good as Siakam, probably better and getting paid half as much) got traded for Buddy Hield, Tyrese Evans, Langston Galloway, first and a second round pick, which is a worse package than the one we’re discussing   2. Nikola Vucevic, a player roughly on Siakam’s tier, got traded for Wendell Carter Jr, Otto Porter Jr, and two first round picks  Are two trades off the top of my head that roughly fit what you’re asking for"
"What i can think of right now...(this is just my opinion)  Overrated: Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Eric Bledsoe (I don't know why Clippers traded for him), Doc Rivers (I know it's about players but still...),  Underrated: CJ McCollum, TJ McConnell, Nikola Vucevic"
"FUCKING SHAMEFUL! YOU FUCKING DUMBASS HOLY SHIT HOW CAN SOMEONE BE SO IDIOTIC HOLY GOD WHAT THE SHIT YOU SINNER, OH MY GOD, THIS IS ACTUALLY UNBELIEVABLE, JESUS CHRIST HOW?!!!1?!/!? IS THIS A TROLL?

I'm a Bulls fan. If an announcer said Nikola Vucevic was a top 7-8 player in the league I would 100% think that announcer should be clowned for it because it's a ridiculous opinion. I wouldn't see it as a knock on Vucevic.
You know a trade is bad when turning prime Dwight into Nikola Vucevic makes you the winner
Nikola Vucevic!!

"He got a big contract from a team that has staked its future on empty-stats losers like Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic and DeMar DeRozan. Plus Lonzo Ball, who doesn't even have the empty stats.  Believe me, the sadness is real. I'm from Chicago and I care about the Bulls as much as the Pelicans. This offseason I was overjoyed at the thought of the Pels getting rid of Ball so their good young guards would get to play.  But then Ball went to the other team I care about. Major bummer."

"""Veteran Bigs like Nikola Vucevic, Al Horford, and Serge Ibaka may camp out on the perimeter, but defenses contest their outside shots less than 40 percent of the time.

"And more….  Biggest gambler: the wheelin', dealin' Chicago Bulls  I discussed the Bulls on last week's Lowe Post podcast, so I'll be brief. I am somewhere in the middle on their raucous offseason. I see a slightly higher ceiling than those cementing them in the play-in tournament in the beefed-up East. Their offense should be really good. Don't overthink the DeMar DeRozan fit just because he shoots long 2s and won't provide pitch-perfect spacing for Zach LaVine, Nikola Vucevic, and Lonzo Ball.  DeRozan has become a good passer; he'll get Vucevic and LaVine easy buckets. Redirecting about 10% of LaVine's game from on-ball creation to off-ball marauding is healthy. DeRozan can create for Chicago's shooters -- including Vucevic -- out of the post too.  DeRozan has more gravity away from the ball than a typical non-threat from deep; he's a cagey mover who can play second-side basketball, and defenses respect his long 2s.  But I wonder if the Bulls can grow into a strong top-four playoff seed over the rest of LaVine's prime, assuming the Bulls re-sign him next summer.  2021 NBA offseason  The NBA's 2021 free-agent signing period has begun, just days after the 2021 NBA draft.  • Latest free agency and trade news and buzz • Pelton: Analyzing every offseason move • Lowe: How the Heat keep doing this • NBA experts: Big surprises and what's next • Grades and details for every trade Building an average defense around LaVine, Vucevic, and DeRozan will be tough. Chicago's under-25 core now consists of Ball, Patrick Williams, and Coby White -- whose role going forward is a little murky. Chicago whiffed on a bunch of swings at young talent before the Jimmy Butler trade, and as part of that deal. (Lauri Markkanen, one of the key players in that trade, hangs in restricted free agency. He doesn't seem long for the Bulls, but maybe they can salvage something in a sign-and-trade.)  Chicago then traded away Wendell Carter Jr. and three future first-round picks for Vucevic and DeRozan -- two of the NBA's ultimate floor-raisers. (The Bulls are kinda Team Raised Floor.)  I like Ball, and I'm super-high long-term on Williams. You'd just like to have a little more in the young-player cupboard after one megatrade and years in purgatory.  That said, LaVine and Alex Caruso are just entering their primes; DeRozan and Vucevic are still in theirs. The Bulls have a nice age-range mix, which should give them at least some wiggle room to change direction if need be.  Winner: the prudent Charlotte Hornets  Charlotte is quietly building a solid team with future flexibility. The Hornets are probably one really good young player from a high-level long-term nucleus -- depending on the development of Miles Bridges and P.J. Washington -- but they are giving themselves avenues to get there.  Acquiring Mason Plumlee and the 37th pick -- JT Thor, signed to a richer version of the ol' Hinkie Special -- in a salary dump was a nice start. Plumlee is not the lob threat the Hornets dream of pairing with LaMelo Ball, but he's a ball mover who will be in the right place on defense (unless he's defending a buzzer-beater against the Lakers.) His $8.5 million deal for 2022-23 is only half guaranteed.  Plumlee is a stopgap, and that's fine. Snaring him prevented any irrationally aggressive trade. Charlotte has kicked the tires on basically every young center -- including Myles Turner of the Indiana Pacers, sources have said -- and they can continue sniffing around from a position of strength.  They jumped into the first round for Kai Jones, and were careful to protect the future pick they sent the Knicks to do so. They gobbled up another future first-round pick for Devonte' Graham, a player they didn't really need with Ball's emergence and Terry Rozier's central role.  (That move does create pressure to re-sign Rozier next summer, which could wipe out near-term cap space. Rozier had a really good season, redeeming Charlotte's decision -- pilloried at the time, including here -- to effectively swap Kemba Walker for him. He's only 27, and the cap space landscape next summer does not look player friendly.)  Kelly Oubre Jr. -- whose $12.6 million salary for 2022-23 is only 40% guaranteed -- should function better in Charlotte than he did in Golden State's motion offense. He provides insurance against another Gordon Hayward injury.  The next big decision is a potential extension for Bridges. He showed last season he is so much more than a dunker: a switchable forward blossoming as a playmaker and 3-point shooter (including off the dribble.) He has a lot to prove before you can pen him in as a high-level starter on a conference finals team, and pending Bridges' ask, the Hornets would be smart to let things play out in restricted free agency.  Washington's extension follows a year later. Ball looks like a future star. The Hornets have to remain nimble around him.   The Pelicans missed on free agent Kyle Lowry, who would've been perfect next to Zion Williamson. That happens. But it's hard to justify the moves made in the aftermath when New Orleans could've just ... kept Lonzo Ball. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert Loser: the New Orleans Pelicans  You can talk me into next season's Pelicans being better with Graham, Tomas Satoransky, Jonas Valanciunas, and Garrett Temple in place of Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, and Steven Adams. I'm not sure I'd really buy it, and if it ends up true, it'll likely be driven by improvement from holdovers -- including Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.  But I doubt New Orleans makes any short-term leap worth moving down 10 spots in the draft to open space for Lowry (whoops!); flinging away two other first-round picks; and losing Ball before his 24th birthday.  Lowry would have been a hand-in-glove fit, and it was not unreasonable for the Pelicans to believe they were one All-Star-level point guard from making a big leap up the standings -- and then one or two lucky breaks from a long playoff run. That was not the most likely outcome, but it was not outlandish. They didn't get Lowry. I'm not privy to their intel, but it clearly was not firm enough.  We know Ball's limitations as a half-court orchestrator. Graham corrects for some of them. He's a more willing off-the-bounce 3-point shooter on the pick-and-roll, though he hit just 29% on pull-up 3s last season and 34% in 2019-20. (Ball has been around 30% on lower volume.) The threat of that shot might open rim runs for Williamson, and steady New Orleans' horrid late-game offense.  Graham has hit 42.5% of his catch-and-shoot 3s over the past two seasons, a few ticks above Ball's mark. A knockdown catch-and-shoot guard is a boon for Point Zion, Post Zion, and every other Zion known to man.  ESPN Daily podcast  Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen Valanciunas is a nominal perimeter threat in a way Adams has never been. But let's not go wild. Valanciunas is not, like, Dirk Nowitzki. He attempted 0.9 3s per game last season. His defender can leave the court, order a beer, and chug half of it in the time it takes Valanciunas to hoist. Valanciunas at heart is a post-up fiend who will clog the lane a lot.  He is a slight step down on defense from Adams. The gap on that end between Ball and Graham -- a very small lead guard -- is pretty big. Graham is a sixth or seventh man on a good team. The Pelicans were bad last year because their defense was bad, without any consistent identity, and they've done little to repair that. (Satoransky and Temple are decent, but they are 15-minute reserves on good teams. The Pelicans did open a big trade exception for use later.)   Satoransky and Valanciunas are free agents after next season. Valanciunas will turn 30 then. Are the Pelicans excited to pay full freight? One potential benefit of these transactions is the Pelicans carrying a large chunk of cap room into next offseason -- the final summer before Williamson's salary balloons. Paying Valanciunas would jeopardize that.  The Pelicans had picks to play with; burning two isn't catastrophic. But it's two fewer to wield in trade talks -- or have leftover after some megadeal -- and it's hard to justify all this rigmarole when the alternative of just keeping Ball was sitting right there.  Winner: the Detroit Pistons  Ditching the 37th pick to dump Plumlee compounded the Pistons sending four (!) second-rounders to the LA Clippers in last season's Luke Kennard/Bruce Brown/Landry Shamet trade -- which netted Detroit Saddiq Bey.  But the rest of this offseason went well. Cade Cunningham might be a franchise player. Three years and $37 million for Kelly Olynyk -- with only $3 million guaranteed in Year 3 -- is fair and movable. Olynyk killed it in his half season in Houston, and was likely getting the midlevel exception from someone. Detroit outbidding that by a couple million is fine. A shooting center opens the floor for Cunningham, Killian Hayes, and the rest of Detroit's young attacking perimeter players -- making every decision easier as they adapt to the NBA."
"Their FO *was* so bad. This is an objectively wrong statement since they now have in trades and Free Agency gotten Lonzo Ball, Nikola Vucevic, &amp; Demar DeRozan plus others. People have clearly chosen to go there."

"The other adjustment Melo needs to make is to convert more of his long midgrange shots into 3PA.

"And you know what's funny? Haven't we seen a ton of good offensive bigs just suddenly extend their range to the 3 point line halfway through their career? Marc Gasol, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic, Joel Embiid, Al Horford, all these dudes started out shooting only last-second heaves but were solid in the midrange, then they stepped back one summer and naturally added a 35% J to their arsenal.  I'm certainly not saying Sengun is going to start making 3+ a game, but it seems like one of those things I'd be less worried about if I were a GM."

"I really thought last season, instead of trading for Powell, they should've traded Nurkic and assets for Nikola Vucevic. I feel like that move would have gave them the advantage over Denver.   A trade centered around Nurkic, Trent, 3 1st round picks plus others could've been a competitive offer."
"Higher on: Monte Morris (top 5 PG in the league potential), Matisse Thybulle (future DPOY if he gets minutes), Nikola Vucevic (literally a 25/10 guy), Melo (too many bad takes of people thinking he's trash due to efficiency)  Lower on: Deandre Ayton (he's good, but people were acting like he was in the Embiid/Jokic tier during the playoffs), Draymond (he's become Dennis Rodman tier offensively), and then for younger guys, Lonzo went from underrated to overrated again, and Siakam had one breakout season and has looked otherwise eh."
"I've done some research and I'm going to give it to Nikola Vucevic, at .377%. Shoutout to KAT at .417%"
"Zach Lavine, Shareef Abdul Rahim and Nikola Vucevic are probably all up there."
"Our current depth chart:   PG: Lonzo Ball / Alex Caruso / Ayo Dosunmu   SG: Zach Lavine / Coby White / Javonte Green(?)  SF: DeMar DeRozan / Troy Brown Jr.   PF: Patrick Williams / Lauri Markannen(?)   C: Nikola Vucevic / Tony Bradley / Marko Simonovic   I doubt Lauri is on the team, hopefully he’s traded for some defensive bigs because we’re in a bad position if we don’t get any rim protection. Javonte Green is a nice bench piece and should be coming back on the QO."
"Zach, Demar, Lonzo, Coby White, nikola vucevic, Lauri…they’re pretty solid. Need another big but I’m pulling for them"
The league ain't ready. The Bulls are about to make noise as a dangerous playoff team this year:  * Zach LaVine * Nikola Vucevic * DeMar DeRozan * Lonzo Ball * Coby White * Patrick Williams * Alex Caruso * Troy Brown * Marko Simonovic * Ayo Dosunmu
A team of -ics would be nasty tho  PG: Luka Doncic SG: Bogdan Bogdonovic SF: Bojan Bogdonovic PF: Nikola Vucevic  C: Nikola Jokic  6th man: Goran Dragic   A bit wonky in the frontcourt but great shooting from all 5 positions and great passing overall.
"I mean sometimes sure.  But if I say Nikola Vucevic has an adjusted TS of 96 how am I supposed to prove that with evidence lol, just like sharing every video clip of him making or missing a shot all season  The problem with the eye test on reddit is that it's infallible, I can post objective data that says Patty Mills is a bad defender and if the response is ""well I watch the games and he isn't"" then I can't respond to it lmao.  It's just circular logic, saying ""my opinion is true because it is true"""
"Nikola Vucevic yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Zach LaVine gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Alex Caruso yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before DeRozan hit the locker room door, former NBA great Joakim Noah hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"

Submitting a late entry in Nikola Vucevic too. Has to be an honorable mention at least.
"I think that’s a solid trade package. Nikola Vucevic is a 2x all star and got traded for slightly less than that (8, WCJ, a 2023 FRP). if your team is planning on rebuilding that would be a good base"
"&gt;11 - Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler  Bump Kemba Walker for Nikola Vucevic for your starting 5.  Not saying Kemba is not as good as Vuc, but I am saying Kyrie, Klay, and Jimmy are better than Kemba and this lineup needs a big man, Vuc is a 2x all star."

"Here's 32-45 and I'll send 46-50 in another comment cause theres a 10k character limit on comments.  **32. De’Aaron Fox (Sacramento Kings)**  De’Aaron Fox is not talked about enough. I get why, he’s on a team that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2006 and isn’t exactly a big market team despite being in California. But at the age of 23, Fox is averaging 25 points to go along with 7 assists. He’s not the most efficient player at just 56.5%TS, but that is to be expected when you’re the only capable player on your team.  Fox is an electric guard with incredible speed and agility and is a delight to watch. Personally, I believe he has to get out of Sacramento, the sooner the better. His career isn’t going anywhere with the Kings. They seemingly haven’t made any moves to acquire talent to make their young star happy. If he wants to start winning and really proving himself, he may have to look elsewhere.  **33. Ja Morant (Memphis Grizzlies)**  I completely expect Ja Morant to shoot up this list next season. He didn’t have quite the regular season we expected from him in his 2nd year, but his performance in the Play-In tournament and his first ever playoff series was incredible. He dropped 35 points to beat Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors in the Play-In, something no one expected at all. He continued to be great in the 1st round playoff series against the Jazz, averaging 30 points and 8 assists including a 47-point performance in Game 2. While the Grizzlies took Game 1, the Jazz ended up winning in 5 games. But it was as competitive as a 5-game series could get.   The Grizzlies are quietly putting together a good roster and if Morant can take his game up to a new level next year, they could see themselves winning some games.  **34. Domantas Sabonis (Indiana Pacers)**  It was another great but under the radar season for Domantas Sabonis. Averaging an efficient 20 points and 7 assists, he remains one of the best passing bigs in the game. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a great year for the Indiana Pacers as a whole. They finished as the 9th seed after losing in the Play-In.  I think Sabonis is a trade piece that isn’t being talked about enough. He is on a good contract and may seek out this summer. He would be a great addition for any contender or team looking to move the needle.  **35. Nikola Vucevic (Chicago Bulls)**  Nikola Vucevic had an interesting year. He played his first 44 games for the Orlando Magic where he was averaging 25 points a night and was an All-Star. But things didn’t go quite as well after he was traded to the Chicago Bulls at the deadline. The Bulls were expected to make a playoff push with their new All-Star duo, but they went just 11-15 in the beginning of the Vucevic era. Bringing in an All-Star mid-season can definitely be a big adjustment, which is why I believe the Bulls can make a playoff push next season. LaVine and Vucevic are a talented duo, the Bulls just need to work to surround them with the necessary talent.  Vucevic is one of the more skilled centers in the league with his great shooting ability and inside game. He is a dynamic scorer who can get you a bucket whenever you need. However, he is 30. How much longer can he play at this level for? That is a question the Bulls front office will need to answer.  **36. Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans)**  Brandon Ingram continued to shine in his 2nd season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Though this year he took a bit of a backseat to Zion Williamson, he still put up impressive numbers. He was an efficient 24 point per game scorer who can score from anywhere on the floor. His length is a mismatch nightmare for opposing defenders. The Pelicans have a special young duo with Ingram and Williamson, but if they want to make it work in the near future they have a lot of work to do this offseason to surround them with a winning cast.  **37. Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Many might consider this too high after a disappointing year for Ben Simmons. Don’t get me wrong, I am completely off the “Ben Simmons has superstar potential” bandwagon. That is not happening. But he is still a good NBA player. He finished 2nd in Defensive Player of the Year voting, he is a great passer and is good at scoring the ball off cuts and in transition.  But once again, he underperformed in the playoffs. He scored under 10 points in 4 out of 7 games in their 2nd round upset loss to Atlanta, the biggest low light coming when he passed off a wide open layup in the last minute of Game 6.  Ben Simmons isn’t going to be a superstar, but he is still a good asset and good player who any team would like to have. I wouldn’t expect him to be in Philadelphia next season.  **38. Gordon Hayward (Charlotte Hornets)**  It’s been a long road for Gordon Hayward after he destroyed his ankle in the first game of the 2017-18 with the Celtics. He showed flashes of the old Gordon Hayward last year in his final season with the Celtics, but this year he might be close to his old self. Or as close as he’s going to get it.   Michael Jordan was heavily criticised for the contract he gave Hayward, but it’s not looking so bad after all. He was an efficient 20 point scorer on a team that held a top 8 position for the majority of the season. Hopefully with LaMelo Ball back healthy next season they can get to the playoffs.  **39. Tobias Harris (Philadelphia 76ers)**  Tobias Harris absolutely has an argument for the 2nd best player on the Sixers. He’s their 2nd scoring option who averaged just shy of 20 points on just under 60%TS. He shoots the three well and plays great off ball. He’s a huge help to Embiid when their other star is extremely limited in the half court setting.   Harris is still yet to receive an All-Star selection, but he is definitely at that level and will be big in any success the Sixers have.   **40. Collin Sexton (Cleveland Cavaliers)**  Collin Sexton took a big step up this season. Many will be quick to label him “empty stats” as he is on one of the worst teams in the league, but 24 points on 57%TS is nothing to scoff at for a 22-year-old.  One of the big questions the Cleveland Cavaliers will have to address this summer is Sexton’s contract situation and future for the team. Do you really want to pay a 6’1” shooting guard with no defensive ability or playmaking a maximum contract? If the answer to that is no, a Sexton trade is a possibility. Any team would be lucky to get him.  **41. Jrue Holiday (Milwaukee Bucks)**  In his first year with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jrue Holiday is an NBA Champion. After trading a large haul for him last offseason, many questioned whether Holiday was the guy to move the needle and push them over the edge. Turns out he was. He was so much better than Eric Bledsoe it’s not even funny. His playmaking, his elite guard defense and his scoring were all massive factors in the Bucks’ title run.  **42. Mike Conley (Utah Jazz)**  After all these years, Mike Conley was finally selected as an All-Star. But I think it’s pretty clear that he wasn’t the most deserving candidate. He’s a great player don’t get me wrong but it’s a bit of a stretch to call him an All-Star.  Conley was a big contributor to the best regular season team in the league, but unfortunately he missed all but Game 6 of the Clippers series. You can’t help but wonder if that Jazz would’ve won that series had Conley been available. Not a whole lot more to say about Conley, he’s consistent and he plays winning basketball.   **43. DeMar DeRozan (San Antonio Spurs)**  DeMar DeRozan has still got it. While he continues to be an elite mid-range shooter, his development in the area of playmaking In recent years has been a welcome surprise for Spurs fans. He averages just under 7 assists with only 2 turnovers per game.  The Spurs are going through a period of mediocrity right now and I’d believe DeRozan’s role in the future of this franchise may be a little unclear, but he’s still a great playmaker. I think a contender will make a move for him this summer, maybe he’d be great in a 6th man role?  **44. CJ McCollum (Portland Trail Blazers)**  It was an injury riddled year for CJ McCollum who played just 47 games. While he did have a career year numbers wise, he wasn’t able to stay on the court and the Blazers had an underwhelming season.  McCollum is a fantastic scorer who can create his own shot behind the arc and in the mid-range. He’s going to have to have a big year next year to satisfy Damian Lillard, if he’s still around next year of course.  **45. Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors)**  It was a down year for Pascal Siakam and the Raptors. The Champions of the 2018-19 seson finished just 12th in the East and Siakam took a step back from the level of play that earnt him an All-NBA 2nd team selection last year. While the Raptors obviously didn’t play their best basketball all year, the COVID pandemic forcing them to play in Tampa Bay all season definitely did not help.   The Raptors are in an interesting spot here. They have Siakam, Fred VanVleet and an aging Kyle Lowry but they also have the 4th pick in this year’s draft. A pick that will most likely produce Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs if they choose to use it themselves. Do they bring Suggs in and let Lowry go? Do they attempt to win with all four of them? Or do they trade everyone and bring Suggs in as the main guy to lead the Raptors into a rebuild?  Early into the offseason we’re already hearing potential Siakam trade rumours, one of the more prominent ones being a Warriors deal. Maybe a change of scenery could get him back on track?"
"The 2011-12 team would have had an incredible future. Jrue, Lou, Young and Iggy, plus they had just drafted Vucevic. Looking back now we can say that would have been a very competitive team for years. They built a great team without tanking and ruined it all with the terrible Bynum trade.   Which of these two teams would you like to have?  *2012 Sixers*  Jrue Holiday (21)  Andre Iguodala (28)  Lou Williams (25)  Thad Young (23)  Nikola Vucevic (21)   *2021 Sixers*  Joel Embiid (26)  Ben Simmons (24)  Tobias Harris (28)  Seth Curry (30)  Danny Green (33)  Embiid is by far the best player out of both teams, but that 2012 team is super good and so young, and didn't cost 3 years of intentional tanking."
Overrated shooter I would say Devin Booker. He has a career 3pt% of 35.2% which is just meh.   Underrated shooter I would say Nikola Vucevic. Has been one of the best mid range shooters in the NBA for awhile and now he’s knocking down over 40% from 3.

"As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.   Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.   Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.   It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.   Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters:  |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393|   Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) Generated 9/21/2021."
"Marcus Smart as borderline all star in the same category as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Vucevic, Domantas Sabonis, Devin Booker, De’Aaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell, and Bradley Beal?  I’m sorry but yeah fucking right, okay buddy lmao  This is why you don’t just rely on analytics alone"
"I feel confident the Bulls will be a playoff team this year. My only concern is that they sacrificed draft picks and cap flexibility to win now with 32-year-old DeMar DeRozan and 30-year-old Nikola Vucevic, who are fine players but aren’t LeBron and AD or Durant and Harden.   They are gambling hard on major improvements from 26-year-old Zach LaVine, 23-year-old Lonzo Ball and 20-year-old Patrick Williams. It sounds to me like a playoff team, maybe even a second round playoff team, but not an Eastern Conference Finals team."
"PG - Penny Hardaway   SG - Tracy McGrady  SF - Hedo Turkolu  PF - Horace Grant?  C - Nikola Vucevic   Shaq and Dwight are obviously better centers, but Vucevic left on better terms."
Nikola Vucevic is more underrated imo
"I cannot find the original source of what I said about McDermott, sadly, but there was one, really. It's not casual that I remember the Number 9.  If you are talking about the last true young core the Lakers had, I guess tit turned out well: Ingram signed a Max Contract and was an All-Star and Lonzo Ball jsut signed a solid contract with the Bulls and is ready for a solid season with a nice team. Josh Hart is a solid rotational player, same for Kuzma.  I get that everyone overhype their talent, but I'm not talking crazy tbh.  For example Dejounte Murray and Jakob Poeltl are top defender in their position as Ball Index says. HERE is a comment where I talk about this. DJ is a Top 4 Defensive Guard and Jakob a Top 3 Defensive Center. About Keldon, he went to the Olympics and brought the energy and played really good during the exhibition games where he played. He also had a 20-20 game this season. Derrick White sadly missed this season, but if you saw the Bubble, he was exceptioanlly good and played even better than DeMar. Also that 36pts game in the Playoffs against Denver two year ago was fire.  **ABOUT DEJOUNTE MURRAY**  Let's bring to the table the mid-range shot then.  Dejounte Murray shot better from the midrange than KAWHI LEONARD while attempting more shots. I highly doubt Kawhi is criticized for his mid-range abilities, instead he's called as someone who never misses from there, considered as one of the best ones in the league. And rightly lemme say because Kawhi is an extremely good mid-range shooter, but have you ever seen someone saying that DJ is at his level.  Actually, only considering the ones that shot more than 210 mid-range shots, DJ is ranked 8th. Better than him, in order, we find: CP3 (382), Jokic (235), Embiid (285), Booker (346), Ingram (354), Beal (333), DeRozan (331). DJ shot an amazing 45.4% with 302 attempts!  Behind him you can find the rightly considered Mid-Range Master Khris Middleton (just 20 more attempts and 0.3% worse). Also Kawhi, Dame, Curry...  (Worth mentioning Nikola Vucevic: less than 1% worse than DJ but with like 70 more shots. Also Irving and KD are excluded because they didn't shoot much because they didn't play much)  And we gotta say that DJ came to the league as a complete terrible shooter, really, he couldn't shoot at all. So he slowly developed one and he is progressing with the range.  Also let's add the fact that he was injuried for a full season and also played his rookie year mainly in the G-League.  Ja Morant played a total of 4127 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 3rd Season. Dejounte Murray played a total of 5891 minutes in the NBA and he's going into his 5th Season. Their age difference is just 2 years too.  So I'm not saying DJ is the shooting maestro, but he's crazy underrated in everything and especially his shooting abilities!"
Nikola Vucevic
"I mean pick &amp; roll defense is not everything there is. His athletic limitations tend to show up especially in pick &amp; roll defense as well as close outs, which is why he is below average for a center. Essentially being somewhere in that Karl-Anthony Towns or Nikola Vucevic terratory.  What stops him from dipping to that bottom 10 in centers and to that clearly negative value are things like hands, size and positioning. All of this which makes him able to disturb finishing attempts occasionally despite lacking athletic tools for great rim protection. Added bonus is also that his post defense is quite good, which isn't the greatest tool to have, but it's a positive in any case.  I think cherry picking specific action or series and trying to evaluate defense based on that is quite dangerous. Best example of this that I can think of right now would be when KAT stretched Gobert to a breaking point in some of their match ups. And that's the guy with possibly 5 of the top 7 defensive seasons since 2013."
"Nikola Jokic, Vucevic are some of the names I feel like I butcher."

Nikola Vucevic
Nikola Vucevic too
What about the eviclutions: - Bogdan Bogdanavic - Bojan Bogdanavic - Nikola Vucevic
"They then added Nikola Vucevic in midseason, and signed DeMar DeRozan while trading away Thad Young (their best defensive player). Combined with Lavine and yeah, that's a recipe for a defensive disaster. Ball and Caruso are good but they can't overcome Vuc LaVine and DeRozan"
"That statistic is a little bit skewed by using a fairly accurate statistical estimation of the total number of people who are 7'+ but taking player's listed height at face value.     For example, while Nikola Vucevic is listed at 7'0"", he actually measure a touch over 6'10"". If you go by reasonably accurate draft combine measurements, the number of actual 7'+ NBA players plummets (Gobert, Porzingis, Poetl, Bol, Fall, and Moses Brown seem to be it) to 1.4% of American 7'+ males between the ages of 20-40 being NBA players (Moses Brown being the only American born player on the list)."
"Umm the East this year is deeper than the West was last year… Lonzo Ball, Eric Bledsoe, Josh Hart, Brandon Ingram, Zion Williamson and Steven Adams just missed the play-in tournament in the West last year… why do we think Lonzo Ball, Alex Caruso, Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and Nikola Vucevic are a sure thing for the playoffs? They SHOULD be a sure thing for the play-in tournament, but anything beyond that is absolutely no sure thing."
"No dude don’t you understand, we’re supposed to be a bad team, get the 7th pick and grab mediocre players. We missed out on Mo Wagner’s brother and all we have to show for it is All-Star center Nikola Vucevic."
Saving this comment to come back and shit on you when the Knicks finish ahead of them yet again lol. I’m old enough to remember when the Bulls were a playoff lock after they traded for “bonafide all-star” Nikola Vucevic. Next thing you know they’re a 10th seed but their fans will still talk shit about the Knicks losing in the playoffs when they didn’t even make it lmao
The answer has been Nikola Vucevic for the past 3 years
Nikola Vucevic
"So this trade is talked about (or at least was) a fair bit, but it hasn't been mentioned here and it might be one of the most disasterous trades of all time.  The Dwight Howard - Andrew Bynum trade.  Philly gets: Andrew Bynum - never plays a game for them and two years later is out of the league  Jason Richardson - is mostly hurt during his two years with the team only playing 52 Games  LA gets: Dwight Howard - spends one year with the team that is pretty much an unmitigated disaster, sustains a back injury and is never quite the same player.   Chris Duhon - plays one year with the lakers and then retires  Earl Clark - plays one year for the lakers, shows a little promise but never improves from there and is out of the league by 2015  Denver Gets: Andre Iguodala - While he was able to help the team to over 50 wins, he leaves after the season to go to the Warriors.    Orlando Gets: Nikola Vucevic - Solid all-star level player for many years on bad Magic teams.  Gets traded to the Bulls in 2021  Aaron Afflalo - A good stats on a bad team player for 2 Magic seasons before getting traded for Evan Fornier  Al Harrington - Plays only 10 games with the Magic during his only season before being waived  Moe Harkless - His time in Orlando was not great, even after a promising rookie season.  His playing time declined and he was traded to Portland in 2015  Josh McRoberts - Played one season for the Magic before being traded to the bobcats for Hakim Warrick  Christian Eyenga - Never played a game for the Magic  2013 2nd Rounder from Nuggets - Became Romero Osby who never played in the NBA  2014 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Became Dario Saric, traded back to the Sixers for Elfrid Payton  2017 1st Rounder from the Sixers - Traded back to Sixers in the Elfrid Payton deal.  Then traded to the Kings and became De'Aaron Fox  Protected 1st Rounder from the Lakers - Eventually transfers as two 2nd rounders in 2017.  Magic use the first on Wesley Iwundu, and the second is traded to the Nets and used on Rodions Kurucs in 2018  The Sixers and the Lakers get totally destroyed by this trade.  Both teams end up becoming two of the worst teams in the NBA for years directly following the trade.    The Nuggets were able to have a good year directly following the trade with Iguodala being a large contributor, but he still leaves the next year.  The Magic is a mixed bag,  Vucevic was probably the gem of this trade playing a high level for the Magic for several years.  Afflalo was also a good contributor to this Magic team.  but while the Magic likely expected to be bad right after the trade I don't think they expected to have not made any meaningful progress up the standings a decade later.  A lot of this is bad management (Getting Elfrid Payton when you could have had De'Aaron Fox and Dario Saric is particularly bad), but it is pretty clear they didn't get the pieces they needed to build for the future like they thought they were getting."
"As a brit, it seems like this is a bigger thing in the states? Anyone I've spoken to about basketball has no difficulty with the names but it seems really common in USA.  Even NBA journalists, ones who are spending a lot of their time with the players will pronounce Nikola (Jokic) in a different way from Nikola (Vucevic)... THEY'RE THE SAME NAME  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqZmK078WYI"

As of right now I would probably put Gobert ahead of Green, Thompson (injury), Sobonis, Vucevic, Butler, Middelton and maybe Kyrie (though this may be personal bias and also Kyrie is such a wild card it is hard to evaluate him).  I think there is an argument Gobert is currently a better player than Brown, Young, Beal, Westbrook, Mitchell, Booker and Bam.   That puts him somewhere around the 25 - 15 best player range which is close enough to top 20.   [This](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/powerrankings/) has Gobert at 24th best player in the league.  So I don't think it is crazy to say that Gobert has a case for top 20."

"No other team could have sent us what we got for Howard.  The trade ended up being very complicated, but the gist is:  Orlando sends Dwight Howard, Chris Duhon, Earl Clark to the Lakers, and Jason Richardson to the 76ers.  Orlando receives Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, Josh McRoberts, and Christian Eyenga and 1 contingent 2014 1st round pick from either the Nuggets or Knicks, 1 protected 1st round pick from the 76ers, 1 protected 1st round pick from the Lakers, 1 protected 2nd round pick from the Nuggets, 1 contigent 2nd round pick from the Lakers.  Yes, we managed to completely fuck up and are once again rebuilding, but it was a really solid trade on our end since Howard wasn't going to stay under any circumstances."

"Yes, [yes I do](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/psavhc/russell_westbrook_working_on_his_new_jumpshot/hdpzpla/?context=999).  &gt; As dumb as the annual ""Simmons is developing his jump shot"" videos are, they're still more hopeful than this video of Westbrook.  &gt;  &gt; Simmons is almost certainly a terrible shooter, but there's less evidence of it because he never shoots. There's a possible hope (though less than plausible) that he just needs to be more confident.  &gt;  &gt; Westbrook, on the other hand, is a terrible shooter--and there's a mountain of evidence that he's terrible. He's been a terrible jump shooter his entire career while shooting at high volume.  &gt;  &gt; It's not just his 3-point shot. Westbrook has been the worst high volume 2-point shooter in the league throughout his career (37.7% on 2-point shots more than 3 feet from the basket for his career). And while the rest of the league has become more efficient by converting long twos to threes, Westbrook's jump shot has become even more inefficient relative to the rest of the league.  &gt;  &gt; Over the past 4 seasons, 33 players have taken at least 3000 shots from outside the restricted area. Westbrook has been the least efficient, by far, of these high volume shooters: &gt;  &gt; |Rk|Player|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|eFG%| &gt; |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| &gt; |1|Stephen Curry|3594|.433|2591|.418|.584| &gt; |2|Kevin Durant|3402|.469|1290|.395|.544| &gt; |3|Kyrie Irving|3142|.445|1484|.398|.539| &gt; |4|Buddy Hield|3698|.400|2468|.408|.536| &gt; |5|Chris Paul|3705|.452|1566|.372|.530| &gt; |6|Khris Middleton|4509|.438|1972|.391|.524| &gt; |7|Damian Lillard|4371|.393|2948|.382|.522| &gt; |8|Nikola Jokic|3727|.456|1249|.360|.516| &gt; |9|CJ McCollum|4540|.428|2073|.387|.516| &gt; |10|Paul George|4295|.393|2524|.391|.508| &gt; |11|James Harden|4730|.375|3421|.358|.505| &gt; |12|Tobias Harris|3683|.424|1524|.388|.504| &gt; |13|Kawhi Leonard|3246|.434|1195|.377|.504| &gt; |14|Jamal Murray|3568|.412|1710|.379|.503| &gt; |15|Terry Rozier|3017|.380|1923|.377|.500| &gt; |16|Kemba Walker|3733|.386|2315|.365|.499| &gt; |17|Tim Hardaway|3114|.379|2040|.365|.499| &gt; |18|DAngelo Russell|3221|.399|1690|.363|.494| &gt; |19|Devin Booker|4142|.417|1703|.348|.488| &gt; |20|Jordan Clarkson|3525|.391|1967|.345|.487| &gt; |21|Nikola Vucevic|3576|.422|1222|.363|.484| &gt; |22|Bradley Beal|4440|.399|2070|.358|.482| &gt; |23|Jayson Tatum|3716|.388|1783|.390|.481| &gt; |24|Trae Young|3074|.393|1591|.341|.481| &gt; |25|Luka Doncic|3090|.385|1723|.335|.478| &gt; |26|Donovan Mitchell|4530|.384|2304|.367|.477| &gt; |27|Jrue Holiday|3096|.391|1541|.344|.476| &gt; |28|LeBron James|3376|.371|1728|.356|.462| &gt; |29|Lou Williams|3404|.386|1396|.360|.460| &gt; |30|DeMar DeRozan|3770|.425|477|.281|.442| &gt; |31|Joel Embiid|3057|.389|929|.323|.438| &gt; |32|Andrew Wiggins|3331|.360|1418|.346|.434| &gt; |33|Russell Westbrook|3885|.342|1357|.292|.393| &gt;  &gt;  &gt; Provided by [Stathead.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Stathead Tool Used](https://stathead.com/basketball/shot_finder.cgi?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool) &gt; Generated 9/21/2021."

"I remember watching him at USC and even back then he was so consistent and played like a ""grown man""   Same with Nikola Vucevic"
"I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I feel like the Bulls are the least likely of the unexpectedly good teams to be 'frauds'  They have Zach Lavine, DeMar DeRozen, and Nikola Vucevic. Three full blown stars. DeRozen was never a 2nd option before, and he's a 2nd/3rd option on this team. Nik was never not the best best player on his team... until he came to the Bulls. Not only that, but they have some insane hustlers in Lonzo and Caruso. Not to mention, they don't even have Coby White back yet, who would boost their bench  Again, I know that this is a controversial opinion thread, but I just cannot see the Bulls being frauds."
If you guys had Nikola Vucevic  instead of kp you would be set...There pick and roll/pop would be elite..
