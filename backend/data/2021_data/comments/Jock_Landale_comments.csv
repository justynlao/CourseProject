Give me Jock Landale over either of them
"You didn't with a full roster, and we beat the other team  that beat you by 39 points using only our bench players + jock landale. Good luck"
Some NBA team needs to pick up Jock Landale
"Jock Landale is slow and he looked fatigued when the US team was pushing, he doesn't have much of a vertical so he would have trouble playing C in the NBA where you are expected to block/alter shots."
"i was surprised when Goulding didn't make it 5/6 years ago. for 10 years now he's been a pretty consistent scorer with a solid 3 pt shot. Not sure if he could make it now (or if teams would want a 33 year old rookie).     Jock Landale has looked borderline NBA ready for a couple years, but has put on a little bit of muscle recently and now looks solid. Apparently he got a couple NBA offers a few months ago but wanted to finish the nbl season and was finals mvp, I'd be surprised if he's not on an NBA roster next season."
Someone get Jock Landale on an NBA Roster.
jock landale aint up for this level of ball
Can't wait to see Jock Landale on the Jazz
Jock Landale just won finals MVP with melbone united this year too
Jock Landale Olympics MVP.
Jock Landale &gt; Ben Simmons
"* **TRE JONES**  He barely played with the main team, but he had an impressive season in the G-League Bubble and also a crazy amazing Summer League. He fits all our needs for PG off the bench since he provides playmaking and defense, what is needed to let flourish go-to-guys scorers like Lonnie and Devin  * **LUKA SAMANIC**  He also had a really good season in the G-League Bubble. He played some games when Rudy Gay was out because of COVID and he was impressive. Defense was really good and shooting too. He definitely still needs to get comfortable out there, but once he clears his mental side of basketball, he has all the tools to succed and he is coming at the perfect time!   * **DOUG MCDERMOTT**  Really solid signing from us. Solid contract too. He provides us shooting, Top 9 active career shooters, easily our biggest need. He has size too. He was interviewed and the way he spoke seemed genuine and really happy to embrace a role of mentor of the team, the veteran guy to help everyone unlock themselves!  * **ZACH COLLINS**  Low Risk, High Rewards Signing. Just 1 Year Fully Guaranteed, then Partially, Then TO. He would fit really well if he stays healthy. Shooting, good defense, rebounding, and size. Literally what we need from out bigs!  * **JOCK LANDALE**  Just 1+TO Minimun Contract. Amazing deal! MVP in the NBL! Again, he provides everything we need from the bigs: shooting, size, rebounding, defense. He will get some minutes!  * **JOSHUA PRIMO**  I doubt he will see the floor this year, he will mainly play in the G-League! Nice since he really do not need him to play as of now. He showed really good flashes in the Summer League, that IT factor that can mean something!  Then there is **Thaddeus Young**! I already count him our since he doesn't fit us at all: he is already on the market. I think he will deal him before the beginning of the season since he has 17 Players.  Chandler Hutchinson will get cut, he have too many players. I think Al-Farouq Aminu will be too if Thaddeus Young is kept or dealt as we get another player back that is better than Aminu or if somehow the Forbes' deal falls, still unofficial signing..."
"Jock Landale is the name of the bad guy in a Disney movie, you can't convince me otherwise"
Jock Landale. MJ loves his big white Aussies.
Jock Landale. Do I say more
"yes. also Wright has done a great job getting us assets and putting our young guys in a position to succeed this season. we had no spacing last year. now we got some picks and moderately high end upside Collins. Jock Landale looks like an NBA player too for cheap. Just getting ANYTHING for DeMar is valuable, especially considering the likelihood that the Bulls pick conveys in the lottery by 2026."
"I'm think trade him to the Spurs for Bryn Forbes, Jock Landale, and 3 seconds. that'll do it for a guy I view as a potential all star I'm sure lol"
Jock Landale for Aus played his way into a contract with the Spurs while the comp was ongoing
"Had Josh Giddey fallen to us, maybe if Patty hadn't left us, and give or take whether or not Jock Landale signed with us, I was going to petition a green and gold statement jersey for the Spurs lol"
I know Aussie big man Jock Landale got a 2 year deal with the Spurs

What a great game we got Patty. He is absolutely crushing and on the other hand we get the Doncic vs Jock Landale matchup
Jock* Landale has more points than Luka
"Jock Landale, Nick Kay, Duop Reath ... NBA chances?"
"&gt;our big depth is not great  I mean, we have Doug at 4 followed by Luka. At the 5 we have Jakob and Drew. Than we have solid third string in Jock Landale and Zach Collins, if he ever becomes healthy. As a low average team that is not contending this is enough.  &gt;I don't think we'd get a 1st for him at the trade deadline  Yeah, completely agree here."
the disrespect for jock landale
Jock landale got his first NBA contract yesterday.  He was on the spurs radar before the Olympics though.
"The 2023 Draft has Victor Wembanyama and Emoni Bates.   2022 Draft has Paolo Banchero and Chet Holgrem.   I'd say best to just go full-on youth movement and try to get a Top 3 pick the next two seasons.   1994: Derrick White  1995: Poetl,. Jock Landale  1996: Dejounte  1997: Zach Collins, Eubanks  1998: Lonnie  1999: Keldon  2000: Vassell, Samanic, Tre Jones"
"‚ÄúThank you for getting Jock Landale to sign with us. You have my permission to leave the team now.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut, Pop, I already signed‚Äî‚Äú  ‚ÄúShhhhh. You have my permission.‚Äù"
What do you mean? Jock Landale played?
They did that to themselves tho. We just got a jock landale for free that‚Äôs like the same thing but better.
"Gotta wonder why Australia decided that we had to play through Jock Landale in the post there while the US went on there big run, just odd nothing like we've been playing the rest of the tournament big disappointment after starting out so well."
A team with an all NBA roster going down 15 to a team with jock landale starting kinda deserves it. The shit talking came from the US severely underperforming. Now it‚Äôs just punching down. It‚Äôs pathetic
jock landale getting locked up by booker LMFAO
"Jock Landale looking good out here, can't wait to watch him on the Spurs this season"
Spur legend Jock Landale
Jock Landale is definitely the name of a villain in a Teen Disney movie.
Quite a few of them are nba players and Spurs just signed Jock Landale
So Abedayo can't beat Jock Landale down low?
There are worse players in the NBA than Jock Landale.
hes tight but hes no jock landale
Future NBA finals MVP Jock Landale? ?
JOCK FUCKING LANDALE
SPURS LEGEND JOCK LANDALE
"Ingles, Delly, Thybulle, Mills, Baynes, Josh Green and Giddey just got drafted  Delly is going to play in Aus unless he's offered a deal in the NBA and a lot of people are ~~hoping Jock Landale gets some looks for a go at the league after playing really well these games.~~  Correction - Jock has landed a shot with the Spurs"
JOCK LANDALE LETS GO BABY
This is not Patty's game to win. Our eyes are on the great Jock Landale and first ballot hall of fame Doup Reath to see Australia through.
Get to watch Patty :( and our newest Spur Jock Landale.  Doubt Keldon plays though.
"Ayton has better post moves and touch, Gobert scored off the pick and roll.   If Gobert was able to work himself in the low block he would have been able to punish the clippers switch everything small ball lineup.   It's why I wanted us to pick up Jock Landale as a third option."
"&gt;\[Charania\] Australian center Jock Landale ‚Äî the 2021 NBL Grand Final MVP ‚Äî has agreed to a two-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs, his agent Sammy Wloszczowski of @SIGSports tells @TheAthletic  Wrong. Spurs are aiming for that 10th seed."
" He's actually had an alright off season imo. Still have some skepticism on some of the moves (Primo and bringing back Forbes mainly, but even then I can see the clear upside in Primo and am hoping they know something my stupid ass doesn't), but as some random on the Internet who knows shit all compared to actual talent scouts and GMs, the moves he's made seem pretty good.  Got an exceptional return on Demar who was leaving regardless, Mcdermott seems like a really good piece and fills a gap we don't have, Jock Landale seems like a great get, Wieskamps got really promising upside for a 2nd rounder, and as much as I don't see the Collins signing working out, I can see the upside and we're in a good spot to take a flyer on a player like him.  On top of all this he didn't overpay for Lauri, Theis or Oubre Jr. Would've loved to see Patty come back because I worry the team lacks a leader now he's gone but you win some you lose some."
"As a fellow Australian I would recommend not following the 76ers, at least not because of Simmons who‚Äôll probably be gone, you can still just follow Australian players like Simmons when he‚Äôs traded or Patty Mills and Joe Ingles pursuing championships, also Jock Landale just signed with the Spurs which will be fun although I doubt he‚Äôll play much. I‚Äôd recommended picking a team with a young star so your passion for the nba grows with that player, I think the Thunder would be a great choice for you personally, they have a great young star in Shai, just drafted an Australian (Josh Giddey) with the 6th pick, will likely suck for the next couple of years but will likely be pretty good for a while after that."
"Dejounte Murray, Devin Vassell, Doug McDermott, Keldon Johnson, Jakob Poeltl.   Derrick White, Josh Primo, Lonnie Walker, Thad Young, Zach Collins.  Tre Jones, Da'Quan Jeffries, Keita Bates-Diop, Luka Samanic, Jock Landale"
"Jock Landale is going to be a star, just wait"
I remember Sabonis routinely making Jock his bitch during WCC play vs. St. Mary‚Äôs. Landale seems to have gotten better since then. Good for him.
"Jock Landale played college basketball, not really a foreign guy in the traditional sense"
Jock Landale from Australia has just signed a two year deal with the Spurs. Good on him.
Sign Patty.  Trade for Joe  Trade for ben and  matisse  Minimum contracts to Jock Landale and Chiris Goulding.  Thats a gold medal winning team right there
Jock Landale play such an important part of the game he was sublime
"Jock Landale. Tall, great shot, tough as nails.  [Reminds me of this bloke](https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/22/b3/27/the-big-ned-kelly-statue.jpg?w=900&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1)"
Get Jock Landale on an NBA roster for fuck sake!!! He‚Äôs bloody good.  Kingys I‚Äôm looking at you
"Jock Landale should pick up an NBA contract based on his performance in the absence of Baynes, definitely feels like he's played at an NBA backup C level.  Exum had shown he's still got his athleticism, which should definitely get him another contract.  Wouldn't mind either on the Jazz"
Can't beat Spain and France with Jock Landale as your best big.
NBL FMVP Jock Landale
I‚Äôm convinced if Jock Landale was the tiniest bit quicker he would be a beast
"Ok we got the win, but it was not pretty.  Patty struggled, the defense has been hounding him the last 2 games.  Yeah Ingles hit a few threes, but honestly he wasn't great. He never is in FIBA tbh  Jock Landale was huge for us today, nice to see.  We gotta do a better job with our spacing and not getting so close to shot clock violations so often.  We need to be better if we want a medal."
Jock Landale needs to be in the NBA
KK Partizan legend Jock Landale!
"Boy out of everyone on this Aussie team, I definitely did not expect a guy named Jock Landale to be carrying"
Jock Landale! It's been his half!
"italy has a few guys   simone fontechio 25 years old 6'6 a good shooter with some iso scoring game kind of like a poor mans bogdonovic (the one on the jazz)   achile Polonara 29 years old 6'8 power forward- good, shooter, an average athlete, not that huge or athletic but competes on defense.  he was one of the best players in euroleague and the acb last year.     czech republic   ONdre Balvin- 28 years old 7 footer, plays hard defense, backup center.   Australia  Jock Landale- 25 years old, back up center  france  nando could of been a back up pg/6th man scorer. kind of like jordan clarkson esq. he is 34 now, so don't quite see the point of signing him.   &amp;#x200B;  thats about it for guys i have seen.  nick kay and agada on nigeria don't interest me much.   with argentina, vildoza and deck were just signed last year by the knicks and okc.  deck is pretty good, vildoza is pretty whatever to me."
"Would love for him to come to the US. He just re-upped for 3 years with his NBL team, though, so it's not likely.   I don't see why Jock Landale can't get a look as a backup center."
Would love to see Jock Landale from Australia get a run at the NBA (preferably on the Jazz)
Jock Landale as well
Jock Landale starting over Tisse is questionable
"It also metter how you play those guys!   Moreover take the last allNBL league (which I just checked):   - Bryce Cotton the x3 MVP and Finals MVP, went to Italy for a short period and been just a good role player in 2018. We are not talking about NBA level, we are talking that the MVP in a top European league is just good, not great.  - Tyler Harvey, a second round pick that never turned into something, also him was a good role player in Germany, not a great player in tier 3 of my list;  - Nathan Sobey, also him seems a good player but not really a great player;  - Jock Landale, which is imho the best Aussie watched in the Olympics outside from Patty Mills;  - John Mooney, not really remembering him in Notre Dame, i only know he is now in Japan, another weak competition league.  We could argue as much as you want, I think there are some evidence, even without considering how teams plays, that NBL isn't the best league out there. Nut if you like it you are free to consider it higher on your personal rank. I just gave my impression and motivated my choice."
I kinda wish you talked more about Jock Landale. Dude was the NBL Grand Final MVP last year. I really think he‚Äôs gonna surprise you.
He's basically lost Australia.  We're all about Matisse Thybulle now after that Olympic performance.  Plus we got Josh Giddey and Jock Landale coming into the league next season too.
"Jock Landale is now a Spur if that‚Äôs incentivizing. I‚Äôm a spurs fan but I‚Äôd probably recommend the Grizzlies. They‚Äôre a combination of a smart organization that builds teams right, a very fun to watch and exciting team that can compete right now, and they have one of the best futures in the league"
"Its interesting to me but I would also argue that you can be a star in the NBL (Bryce Cotton, Keifer Sykes, Scott Machado) but also be unplayable in the NBA. Those guys are all like Kemba sized but are really bottom of the barrell for NBA standard combo gaurds.   They play extremely physically, but their bigs are often not very (guard) skilled. Its like NBA 2002 style post bruising with stars like Jock Landale barely able to scrape backup big minutes on a Spurs team of young guys not really trying for anything"
Josh Giddey  Patty Mills  Matisse Thybulle   Josh Green  Jock Landale
In Australia‚Ä¶ Spurs game just finished‚Ä¶ Gotta be Jock Landale.
jock landale szn
Also Jock Landale played really really good in the pre season too. Luka had no spot on this roster
"They‚Äôd probably be the best college team more often than not, at least in the first scenario. Even the Americans that wash out into Australia were almost exclusively top-tier college players, and they‚Äôve had a few extra years to develop and really hit their peak. Then you‚Äôve got a few Australian/NZ guys that probably are pretty borderline NBA players that just aren‚Äôt worth a shot because they‚Äôre too old or don‚Äôt work as role players (or do get a shot, in the case of Jock Landale)."
agreed but fifth jock landale
"Can‚Äôt wait till he plays on the Australian team at the next Olympics.  Giddey, Thybulle and Josh Green will all be going into their prime. Patty will probably have one last run before he retires.  Still have Joe Ingles, Dante Exum, Jock Landale and Aron Baynes.  X-Factor is if Ben Simmons finally joins. Figure he has a shot at it if he wants to redeem his image."
"Man, spurs can we have Jock Landale for like Georgios and a 2nd? We need a backup center and you guys don't even use him."
Bruh I think we got a Keita bates diop and jock landale for free. I‚Äôd take both over bazemore.
"I mean, I guess it's a win win for the Blazers and Spurs if Jock Landale goes to the Northwest?  Never realised he was such a social butterfly. Couldn't be Giddey, because there's very little socialising on Arrakis."
"If you're Australian, these are the teams with Aussies playing on them.  Oklahoma City - Josh Giddey, in his first year. The team is terrible, but getting better. Giddey can pass like he's been in the league for ten years.   Philadelphia - Matisse Thybulle, a defensive specialist who is a bundle of energy. Ignore The Yank, who refuses to play for Australia and is getting shipped out of Philly to somewhere hopeless, as soon as anyone (cough Minny cough) is dumb enough to make an offer for the lazy, mentally weak overpaid coward who *refuses to play for Australia*.  Brooklyn - Patty Mills has joined this year, and is hitting long shots like he  has a laser sight. Olympic Patty is the absolute foundation of the Ollyroos, and he's as fine an Australian sportsman as you'll see.  Utah - Joe Ingles is coming to the end of his storied career, and he plays for the Jazz. Opposing teams still get Jingled. Repeatedly.  San Antonio - Jock Landale, another Autralian young gun, plays here. Jock is quietly building himself a quite decent NBA resume.  Dallas - Josh Green is coming off the bench for them.  Me, I'd be picking Oklahoma City - they are going to lose a lot, but you'll get to grow with the team.  And Giddey is an absolutely insane prospect. He is likely to be the youngest ever player to get 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the NBA - he has done all of these things, but not in the same game. And he wears a flanno to media interviews - what's not to love :)"
We really should‚Äôve brought Jock Landale in to combat Boban. Make Boban have to guard the 3 point line.
Nope. Drew Eubanks and Jock Landale get his minutes
Spurs  They fking suck. Jock Landale is surprised me for the better The Off-season was ok. The rookies besides Landale already got sent down to the G League (12th Pick Joshua Primo) Coach Popovich is old and not playing the right people.
That Forbes comment hit me hard!  Love the energy. We are a scrappy bunch!  Just hope we can learn to close out some games. Let‚Äôs give Jock Landale some love. He put up 10 points in 5 mins of garbage time the other night. He‚Äôs trying to get more minutes over Eubanks. GSG!
