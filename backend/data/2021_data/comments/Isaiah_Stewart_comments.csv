"Absolutely not lol. The Pistons are a team that competes very hard. They are just so young and untalented. After grant and Wright, they are heavily relying on DSJ, Josh Jackson, Saben Lee, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart. 2 of those guys were busts and the other 3 are rookies. And that’s after losing Blake to a buy out and Rose to a trade. No coach is winning with a roster like that.   Compare that with their neighbors in the standings like the Magic, Timberwolves, Kings, Pelicans, Wizards, Rockets, etc who in my opinion who have much more talented rosters but are performing worse based on their expectations."
"Damn Cole Anthony was supposed to be up next.  I think he was #1 high school recruit for a while before the final rankings.    Ended up 4th in the class behind Wiseman, Edwards and Isaiah Stewart.  He'll probably be decent.  He was just unfortunately thrown into the wolves too early."
"The “defensive raptor” rating is famously unreliable. Has poetl as its highest rated defensive player; with Conley, Isaiah Stewart, Christian wood, and Rudy Gay all in the top 10. Would really only use offensive raptor rating, if you’re going to use it at all."

"Yeah, dodging the top tier opponents like the Cavs,  Pacers, Pistons, and Grizz. Those are the cream of the crop teams with big men that Embiid is terrified of. Isaiah Stewart and Andre Drummond are just too scary!"
"Well Killian was eh, but he only played 7 games and got injured so I can't really make a fair assessment. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty good, and Saddiq Bey has been a top 10 rookie thus far."
"Pistons  Bey is as advertised. Shooters shoot. Can't believe he dropped to 19  Isaiah Stewart is also as advertised. Slow, prehistoric, and useless on both ends of the floor if he isn't under the rim.   Killian Hayes is out with a significant hip injury. When he did play we were talking about sending him to the G League. The Killian Hayes hype was a hoax."
"Isaiah Stewart has been dubbed Beef Stew by Pistons twitter and the fans are calling their selves the Stew Crew  Saddiq Bey has been called Big Diq Bey and I'm really hoping fans start calling theirselves Diqheads.  Killian has gotten more hate than anything because of his struggles followed by injury, but him and Sekou have been called the French Revolution which will be really cool if they actually end up being good players in the longrun."
Isaiah Stewart is Beef Stew... cause look at him.
Four defenders *or* the goat Isaiah Stewart  But to answer op’s question it’s easily Zion
Isaiah Stewart remember the name
That would be Isaiah Stewart with Detroit
I'll take it.   I went into this past year's draft hearing great things about Killian Hayes but not know much about Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. Now Bey and Stew might be my two favorite Pistons. They've been a lot of fun to watch this year.
"I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert on the Pistons, but I don't know how strong of an argument it is when someone questions you on proclaiming that Isaiah Stewart is a stud and you defend saying that by saying ""Stewart is a stud.""      That's it?"
“ROTY contender Saddiq Bey”   “Absolute stud Isaiah Stewart”  “Josh Jackson has been incredible”
Troy Weaver won’t get it because the pistons are bad but he’s been unbelievable given what he inherited:   - Drafted ROTY candidate Saddiq Bey  - Drafted absolute stud Isaiah Stewart   - Signed Jerami Grant to a moderate deal who’s now taken the leap to All Star level   - Signed Delon Wright who’s now viewed as an asset  - Signed Mason Plumlee who’s now viewed as an asset   - Signed Josh Jackson who has been incredible  - Traded an expiring Derrick Rose for a second and Dennis Smith Jr who continues to look better by the game   and none of this is including the drafting of Killian Hayes who we have no idea what he can become
Isaiah Stewart will end up a candidate.
Isaiah Stewart. Little bit undersized center who is a muthafuckin hustler. He doesn’t always switch on defense that well but works so hard he more than makes up for it. Idk if he’s better than Bey but definitely a solid player. Pistons sub draws comps to Ben Wallace but he’s gonna need to take a pretty big leap to live up to that praise.
Isaiah Stewart
Isaiah Stewart doesn't get a lotta love or recognition but he's prolly the most fun player on the squad and is a beast on the offensive boards  I would've said rose for worse bc he legit did not pass but now that's he's been traded idk maybe sekou

"How does Isaiah Stewart look this year? He played at my college and he looked good but really limited and basic, but I couldn’t tell if it was the coaching and role he was in. When he got picked 16th or whatever it was I was incredibly surprised, I was expecting him to go much later.   How is he doing? Jaden McDaniels is playing far better than he did in the year at UW so I’m wondering if Stewart is having a similar season."
"The Kings interior defense is absolutely horrible, it's a veritable layup line and Corey Joseph and Isaiah Stewart of all people were killing in the paint. They need an actual center, Rashaun Holmes, as much as I love him as a player, is not capable of being a defensive centerpiece but is playing the most important defensive position."
isaiah stewart is going to be a top 10 rebounder of all time
Nah Isaiah Stewart. He can guard 1-5 and is a blocking machine. McDaniels is a good defender though.
Isaiah Stewart
"Saddiq Bey has been a true pleasure to watch develop. At risk of being a pistons homer, Isaiah Stewart has shown a lot of flashes this year!"
"This says ""welcome to the nba motherf\*!cker"" to rookie Isaiah Stewart from Gordon and Jokic"
"Eh, it’s not rude to say that about a team that basically nobody other than devoted fans keeps track of. Well, for one Saddiq Bey is easily one of the top-5 rookies in this year’s draft class and is arguably the second best three point shooter in it after Haliburton, so that’s something pretty much every Pistons fan is excited about. Isaiah Stewart has been pretty exciting to watch for us as well because of his defensive-minded and aggressive style of play, which is pretty much the definition of Pistons basketball, he also shown flashes of outside shooting which would make him a really nice building block moving forward, oh and he’s 19 years old so he’ll have plenty of time to develop here. Hayes doesn’t look like much just yet, but he’s also nineteen, is already a decent playmaker, has good size and plenty of potential. We also have a bunch of young players who have a good chance to help the team in long term, like Diallo, Saben Lee and Josh Jackson(who is a Detroit native and has been playing his heart out for us) and a bunch of cheap guys that we took a flyer on who try their best to prove their worth as NBA players(DSJ, Cook, Okafor, also Josh Jackson is in this category as well), never mind Grant proving himself as an All-Star candidate level of player. Also for the first time since 2003 we have a good chance of getting a high pick in the next draft which already looks quite promising. Obviously it’s not the same as having Sexland and Allen as far as young cores and concerned, but Garland and Sexton weren’t exactly spectacular their first year either, were they? So yeah, for the first time in forever Pistons have a clear direction and a definitive young group of players to build with and it’s quite nice to watch for the franchise that’s been suffering through mediocrity for the last 13 years. We’re in a rebuild right now, but I’d argue watching this team has been the most fun I’ve had as a Pistons fan since what feels like forever."
"Saddiq bey, Isaiah Stewart, and saben lee. Killians been injured but he’s shown flashes of being a great defender and excellent passer. Not to mention whoever we take in the upcoming draft."
"I wouldn't say that he is underrated, but people need to start paying attention to rookie Isaiah Stewart.  At 19 years old he is:  Leading all rookies in Rebounds    Leading all rookies in Blocks   6th Among Rookies in FG%   Note, he is not a plodding big man who gets all his buckets in the paint. Stewart has an excellent mid-range game (he is shooting 50 percent on shots between 10 and 16 feet) and is shooting 41% from 3 on 24 attempts this year.  His impact on defense is also felt any time you watch a Pistons game. The guy is as relentless as they come and has displayed an ability to defend in a variety of ways (on the P&amp;R, in transition, etc).     When it is all said and done, I believe Stewart will be the best big-man drafted in 2020."

"Isaiah Stewart manhandled Wiseman when they were in HS when their teams faced each other at a Nike tournament a little bit before they were supposed to commit to college. Wiseman's team won, but Stewart clearly dominated the matchup."
"**Killian Hayes** - started off slow, has looked like he has a much better pulse on our offensive movement since returning two games ago but still isn't scoring much. Really wish his success hadn't been tied to everyone's opinion of Kevin O'Connor because he's an extremely talented rookie who's been fine for what he was advertised, but because he isn't running away with RotY he's already been labeled a bust by some  **Isaiah Stewart** - was a fan favorite from day 1 for his hustle, but now his skill is starting to shine through and it's really exciting. He has shot 42% from deep (on limited attempts) and is above 50% from 10-16ft. His defensive hustle is insane (I believe he's leading rookies in Blocks per game) and he's a great offensive rebounder. He'll be fun to watch for a long time.  **Saddiq Bey** - came in as an NBA ready shooter (as advertised) but has shown a bit more ability than even that. He's put together a few moves with his back to the basket, can create his own 3 in a way that looks suspiciously identical to Wayne Ellington, and has put the ball on the floor as well. If he becomes a playmaker as well as a shooter, he should be a future all star.  **Saben Lee** - Isn't a revelation or anything but he looks like he'll last in the league which is pretty cool for a 2nd rounder. You can tell he's not comfortable with his shot but his ability to get to the rim and get fouled (or make the extra pass) has allowed him to stay on the floor. He also came very close to posterizing Vucevic so that was fun.  .  All in all, a pretty solid but VERY productive draft for Weaver's first year as GM. The future is exciting in Detroit."
Isaiah Stewart manhandled us yesterday it was disgusting. I then bought his NFT.
"Wiseman just can’t play basketball, he was drafted because of his physicals and his potential but he’s gotta learn how to play the game. He plays like a 6’1 guard stuck in a monster 7 footer’s body. He also has really bad body language - if he has a bad miss he’s going to sulk all game, and continue to make bad plays, vs trying to get a good shot off n get in rhythm.   Isaiah Stewart is a much better center than Wiseman and could go on to have a better career imo."
"Lol are you blaming Steve Kerr for the FO constructing a second unit led by Jordan Poole lol. Lol, when you sub is saying that the team is loosing because JTA should be getting more min you know how bad your roster sucks and Ker is not the blame for that.  Should have drafted better, forget Edwards and Ball, Wiseman is literally getting outplayed by Isaiah Stewart."
"Out of his 3 games of college ball, Oregon was the only good comp he faced. And he showed similar problems in that game as he's been showing this season. He also got thoroughly outplayed by Isaiah Stewart (who was drafted by the Pistons) when they faced each other in HS at Nike games. A lack of BBIQ/feel for the game has been there, just ignored because of physical tools and upside.   He may turn out to be a good, great player down the road, but he just wasn't the right pick for what the Warriors are trying to do now."
Isaiah Stewart has been pretty competent for Detroit.
I'm not a Pistons fan but always root for the Pistons. I've probably watched more Pistons games this year than most people who aren't Pistons fans. I think the future looks bright. At PG rookie Killian Hayes is a question mark but a good PG is not hard to find in this league. At SG Hamidou Diallo seems like an exciting athletic player who is a good defender and explosive scorer. At SF rookie Saddiq Bey seems like a solid defender and very good 3pt shooter. At PF Jerami Grant has been playing great and looks like one of the most improved players in the NBA this year. At C rookie Isaiah Stewart provides a strong defensive presence and has a good ability to score down low
"How about KAT, Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, Richaun Holmes, Montrezl Harrell, Jarett Allen, Mitchell Robinson, Wendell Carter Jr, Isaiah Stewart, and Dwight Howard? I think this observation speaks more to the talent of American guards and forwards than it does the lack of talent of American Centers"
"Well people expected him to at least look like the best rookie center, and he hasn’t even. Isaiah Stewart for example has looked better in every department and is the same age."
"I have to say, I knew nothing about Isaiah Stewart when we drafted him aside from the fact he was supposedly undersized and not A+ athletic (or something along those lines). Didn't feel super great about the pick as a result.   Now though? I love that guy. He has a Ben Wallace motor &amp; demeanor and it's amazing. The exact type of player I'd want on my team."
We also took Isaiah Stewart with the 16th pick
Saddiq Bey	  Mason Plumlee	  Isaiah Stewart	  Jerami Grant	  Josh Jackson  Sekou Doumbouya  Wayne Ellington	  Saben Lee    Frank Jackson     Dennis Smith Jr.
"Pistons with Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Saben Lee, Killian Hayes, and one of Jalen Green/Jalen Suggs/Evan Mobley is a budding dynasty"
"Counterpoint, Isaiah Stewart is progressing amazingly and Christian Wood broke out last season."
Isaiah Stewart. You heard me correctly.
I’ll try for our team:  • Jerami Grant • Mason Plumlee • Saddiq Bey • Isaiah Stewart • Wayne Ellington • Dennis Smith Jr. • Saben Lee • Josh Jackson • Frank Jackson • Rodney Mcgruder
"I see everyone is sleeping on the Pistons.  Troy Weaver is assembling a gritty, hard-nosed team of Detroit-style youngsters who will all break out at the same time.  Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee, Hamadou Diallo, Sekou Doumboya, Jerami Grant, and a likely top 3 pick who could be Cade Cunningham, Jalen Suggs, Jalen Green, or Mobley."

"While I'm naturally in favor of any top 10 list that includes Isaiah Stewart, I don't think Saddiq Bey has been the Pistons 3rd best rookie this season."
"&gt; LEBRON thinks Isaiah Stewart is a pretty significant negative on defense, but a good offensive player.  That's not what I'm seeing. LEBRON has him at -2.4 on offense and +1.4 on defense.   All the different impact metrics you cite have him as bad on offense and good on defense."
"So this is interesting. LEBRON thinks Isaiah Stewart is a pretty significant negative on defense, but a good offensive player.   538's RAPTOR sees him as a darn good defender, and a below-average offensive player.   Both RPM and BPM see him as a terrible offensive player, while seeing him as a pretty damn good defender and a slightly above average defender, respectively."
Bro we have Plumlee and Isaiah Stewart
Isaiah Stewart.
"Seems like a win-win then. Our 3 uninjured rookies have all looked great. Bey has made the most noise, but we LOVE Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee has been really good now that he's in the rotation. He's going to have a good game tonight on NBATV against the Nets, and everyone's going to be like ""What's a Saben Lee, and why does he keep getting to the basket?!"""
Isaiah Stewart is completely jacked as a 19 year old.   https://images.app.goo.gl/Q6VgnviTwPFYYG2JA
"Our entire last draft has looked incredible so far. Haven’t seen enough of Killian Hayes yet but Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, and Saben Lee have been fantastic all year and will hopefully be key pieces as we go along. Josh Jackson and Mason Plumlee have been great too but I’m not sure how they factor into the future. Hopefully we can get one of the top guys in the draft like Cade, Suggs, or Green who can make a huge impact immediately. I trust Weaver in FA and the draft and we’ve played a lot better than our record so I’m optimistic for the first time in a long time."
**Airplane Mode**  (Derrick Jones Jr.)  Honorable mention to Isaiah “Beef Stew” Stewart.
"Mason Plumlee  Saddiq Bey  Josh Jackson  Saban Lee  Actually committing to a rebuild instead of perpetually drafting 12th  Delon Wright(grabbed them a few seconds)  Derrick Rose (grabbed them a young prospect and a second)  Isaiah Stewart   They have been shitty but competitive, one of the most enjoyble rebuilds in the league rn"
"You guys got a steal in Isaiah Stewart. He was very highly-rated in HS, great production in college and has been super solid in the league. I think he was one of those guys that got marked down for being an “old-school” big man despite his production"
"Historically : Rip Hamilton, he's the guy that's rarely mentionned about that 2004 team, Ben was the monster, Chauncey the leader and the finals MVP, Prince had the block and was guarding Kobe, Sheed was the bigger star before Detroit and was the guy that put us over the top.  But Rip moving off screens was often our only offense, he was the only guy able to score in that amazing Pacers/Pistons series, his off ball movement was creating all sorts of open looks for the screeners,he continually got better until 2008. And he never looked out of place as the go to scorer on a perenial title contender, he was the most consistent Piston of the go to work era by far, the guy you could always rely on. Chauncey only became reaaally consistent after 2005, Sheed was the definition of inconsistent, Ben and Tay were mainly one way players in the playoffs, Rip was our leading scorer, and also despite his small frame and mediocre defensive reputation was often our go to perimeter defender against Lebron when we wanted to use Prince as a help guy in the post 2006 series when it became obvious Lebron was too strong for Tay.  &amp;#x200B;  Currently : Isaiah Stewart, he's gonna be a well abover average starting center"
"I was born in New Jersey and was a Nets fan growing up. Moved to Detroit recently, and there's no way in hell I'm leaving the fanbase with Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kai Irving for one with Jerami Grant, Killian Hayes, and Isaiah Stewart. I'll watch Pistons games and hope they win, but they'll take the backseat."
Isaiah Stewart defensive highlights incoming
The amount of times I see Isaiah stewart being victimized by a nasty move on r/nba is ridiculous
"With the rumors about Hali telling teams not to draft him being proven fake, kind of. He would have been put in an awkward situation though where he wouldn't have been given a ton of minutes at point since we have CP3 and Cam Payne has been an excellent backup. Probably would have been out backup 2.  With hindsight, I more wish we had picked up an NBA-ready PF or Center like Isaiah Stewart. Hali would have been great for our future but it crowds up our present. Our biggest weakness and what could possibly hold us back in the playoffs is we don't have a deep big man rotation, which Stewart could have helped with."
"Killian Hayes gets a shot boost. Suddenly he is an excellent passer, shooter and defender with size at the PG position.   Saddiq Bey gets the athleticism boost. A lights out shooter with the ability to attack the basket and finish at the rim.   Isaiah Stewart has 3 inches added to his frame. He goes from being an undersized C to a top-level talent."
Struggle to see how Isaiah Stewart doesn’t deserve rookie 2nd team
"Man Motown y'all have something brewing there- top pick incoming, jerami grant, Isaiah Stewart, saddiq bey, hamidou, now killiann it's a team worth watching"
"He’s a “Pistons” fan that hates anything related to the Pistons, he also called Saddiq Bey &amp; Isaiah Stewart bad picks - both of which are currently in the top 6 rookie ladder &amp; werent even lottery picks. He’s not worth your time, idk if he’s trolling or braindead  No Pistons fans think the way this dumbass does, he’s too afraid to come to r/DetroitPistons anymore cause no one agrees with his shitty takes"
"No way is Isaiah Stewart 19 years old, that dude looks at least 35."
Correct me if I’m wrong but im pretty sure they did tho? I remember they clearly stated that Portland’s 16th pick in Isaiah Stewart was going to Detroit. And woj also explained the 3 team trade that gave the pistons the 19th pick in Bey from the nets
Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart 😤

Yeah still seeing people saying it about saddiq bey and Isaiah Stewart too
"It really is absurd.  Starting with the 2016 class, wroten, thybulle, Isaiah Stewart, jaden mcdaniels, jalen nowell, Markell fultz, marquese chriss..."
"it was also fairly deep too surprisingly. Isaiah Stewart has been good, Quickley looks like a solid player with a well-rounded skill set, maxey is intriguing, Pokusevski, Sadiiq Bey, Desmond Bane, Theo Maledon, Kenyon Martin Jr having made some impact already"
"Two of our rookies — Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart — have received all-rookie first team talk the whole season, while Killian Hayes is raising eyebrows all over the place with his playmaking (if you don’t believe me, consult Zach Lowe’s latest column and a recent video analysis by Kevin O’Connor).   Of all the tanking teams, we have been by far the most competitive game to game, and our rookies-only tank lineups end up winning games they aren’t supposed to, with fans from opposing teams regularly tipping their hats to the young guys’ spirit.    We’re also on track to get a top-five pick in the upcoming draft and our highest-paid player, Jerami Grant, is by far a net positive and totally bought in to playing in Detroit and seeing the rebuild through.   So take it back. Take it back!!!"
PA?  Isaiah Stewart is a stud
"Bey and Isaiah ""beef stew"" Stewart both ballin for DETROIT ya'll sleepin but it's cool. Y'all will know their names next year lol"
Isaiah Stewart! Don’t ask questions man those get downvoted lol
"Isaiah Stewart, Pistons rookie"
Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman at #2 and Saddiq is a stud
You mean [Beef Stew](https://pistonpowered.com/2021/04/22/detroit-pistons-isaiah-stewart-beef-stew/)?
"I love Isaiah Stewart. I have no idea what his ceiling is but anytime you have a guy with his heart and hustle... that’s what good teams are made of, especially in Detroit."
Do you like Isaiah Stewart on your team? Do you think he can be a starting caliber center in the future?
isaiah stewart
In that case he’s definitely good  Though for future reference get Isaiah Stewart 👀
"Patrick Williams, Theo Macedon, Kira Lewis, Isaiah Stewart... he is literally one of the worst players in the NBA and there are plenty of guys his age performing way better."

Plumlee not playing any more I thought? Isaiah Stewart looked decent. Swallowed up his minutes.
"Actually I remember a lot of draft analysts pointing out that Wiseman wasn't even that dominant in high school. In Nike EYBL he averaged 15ppg/8rpg on 52 TS% (even guys like Bol Bol put up more dominant numbers), and he got outplayed in head-to-head matchups against his peers like Isaiah Stewart and Evan Mobley . All of this happened in front of scouts and there have been concerns about his basketball development for a while.  People were willing to overlook his red flags because of his measurables but so far he hasn't done a good job of disproving them. Doesn't mean he can't still be good if he works hard on his flaws, but he's probably more raw and further away than people realized"
Ay agreed man. Isaiah “Beef Stew” Stewart is a rookie that plays with that hard nosed mentality. Sooooo awesome watching a rookie frustrate &amp; beefing with every opposing big man lol. Really hoping we recreate that energy here in Detroit.
"Like I said before, a lot of that has to do with the amount of opportunity he has had to play and grow. OO hasn’t had the same opportunity due to being on a team with completely different goals for the season and for not being able to even practice with the team more than a handful of times.   Also, that 3P% is on an extremely low sample size. He’s only made 13 threes all year, or 1 every 5 games. That’s not enough to force teams teams to cover him out there and stretch the floor for his teammates. He could definitely get there eventually, but that’s not the case in the moment. Isaiah is incredibly strong and has hustle on the offensive glass that reminds me of Capela, but OO isn’t far off in those regards, and those are the two distinct advantages I think Stewart has over OO. I think Okungwu’s elite defensive BBIQ for a prospect and his switchability is what makes him a clear-cut better prospect than Stewart in the long-term."
Isaiah Stewart at 6th seems high - who did they have ahead of him?
Beef Stew - Isaiah Stewart
"Isaiah Stewart is gonna end up on a lot of posters, but respect to him for contesting EVERYTHING.   Dirty slam by KJ tho"

"i mean you think isaiah stewart is worse than james wiseman so you've never watched basketball in your life. Edwards' numbers last few months have been around LeVert/Grant/Hayward level which is just about top 65 range.  Thank you for your consistently awful takes presented so confidently/rudely in the sub. Really makes it fun for ppl to have low hanging fruit to refute  ps: qualification-dropping isn't very sneaky, just silly. he's averaging 23.6 since the break. at no point did I argue anything about the first half of the season, where he wasn't playing good."
"We had such a great draft gah damn. Saddiq Bey at #3, Isaiah Stewart #7. Big things happening in Detroit soon"
I'm guessing Beef Stew is Isaiah Stewart?
"Harris, Blake, Rose, Knight pre-injury, Jerami Grant, Isaiah Stewart, Saddiq Bey. You don’t gotta tell me it was an ass decade, I know. Idk what you’re even trying to do right now. Dre was a losing player, he contributed to L’s, not W’s. He was never the best player on any team."

Makes me happy Isaiah Stewart is putting up Dre numbers in the last 2-3 starts but it’s actually meaningful and he’s playing within the game.  Dre tries doing too much
"Mobley is a weird fit on the Pistons for me, they already have Isaiah Stewart/Saddiq Bey/Sekou who can theoretically be their starting frontcourt; I'm relatively low on Sekou but I think the other two have great upside. Suggs would be a really good fit with Killian Hayes and they don't have great guards after Hayes."
"Here's a few more.   Isaiah Stewart is better than James Wiseman.   While Tyrese Haliburton is better currently, Killian Hayes will be better in his prime.   Duncan Robinson's season last year was a fluke. He's still an elite shooter, but hes never going to shoot 46% on 8 threes per game ever again. Probably more like 39-40% (which is still good).   Saddiq Bey is better than Blake Griffin.   If Kawhi Leonard wasn't an MVP candidate playing 78% of the games last season, Embiid shouldn't be an MVP candidate playing 68% of his games.   Donovan Mitchell is the Jazz's best player. It becomes obvious in the playoffs imo.  Curry is more valuable to the Warriors than Harden is to the Nets.   Not all players who put up good numbers on a bad team are empty stats players."
"As a husky fan I can add to this - the huskies were coming off a surprising NCAA tournament appearance the season prior and despite losing Matisse Thybulle among others from that team, they were bringing in arguably their greatest freshman class ever highlighted by Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels, and expectations were high.  They ended up having no chemistry whatsoever the whole season and while Isaiah Stewart put up numbers (he was first team freshman all Pac 12) the huskies finished 5-13 in the conference.  Despite averaging 17 and 8 as a freshman, I think there was a realization amongst scouts that he probably wasn’t gonna be the type of mercurial talent to carry a college let alone nba level team to success as the best player, which I would honestly agree with.  What he can be though is an extremely valuable part of an nba roster that could easily start on a playoff caliber team."
"Keep saying what Isaiah Stewart can't do...  What does Wiseman do better than Isaiah Stewart right now? Keep in mind Stewart is the younger player.  It's okay, you don't have to double-down. You can let it go and walk away."

"Well, he's ""only"" 6'8""-6'9"", so he's a little undersized, but he has a 7'4"" wingspan.  I think the biggest knock is that he isn't an explosive leaper. Also, he was described as a back-to-the-basket big who wouldn't be capable of switching on defense. Both of those 2 critiques are not only wrong but are actually strengths of his. His face up game is way above what he showed in college. He's shooting over 40% from 3, and it's legitimately surprising when he misses from mid-range. Also he's fantastic when switching onto guards. I think because he played the middle of a zone at Washington, people didn't understand his defensive ability.   So yeah, it's easy to look at Wiseman and dream about his potential, but there is zero doubt that Isaiah Stewart will reach his ceiling. The guy is relentless."
"Hopefully Isaiah Stewart can get more starts now that the seasons winding down  Been consistently solid and anytime he’s started/given good minutes he’s looked very good despite no one thinking he should’ve been taken at his position.  That and he just had 15pts/21reb last night.  Saying a lot of this cause I want two pistons to make the all rookie team, but I also think Stewart will be a very solid starter for years to come."

"When u think about it it makes sense cause of how many centers are in the league that kinda do the same thing as each other. Off the top of my head u have Noel, Robinson, Dwight Howard,  Isaiah Stewart, Jarret Allen, Jakob Poetl, etc. Obviously some of these players are way better on offense or defense than some of the other players but for the most part they have the same role and all are pretty good at it"
"Isaiah Stewart, he's a beast. Averages about 7 points 6 rebounds and 1 block on 58 42 65 shooting splits. He only takes 0.5 threes per game, but his pick and pop mid range game is really solid. He's also a physical presence with an incredibly high motor whenever he's on the court."
This year's Pistons rookie crop is super cool. Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart are my favorite rookies in *yearrrrrs*. Then there's Killian and Saben Lee to boot.
"For the Pistons: Killian Hayes, Josh Jackson, Saddiq Bey, Sekou Doumbouya and Isaiah Stewart"
Better: Isaiah Stewart   Worse: James Wisman
Idk if anyone will see this but when do rookie teams come out? I will be legit mad if saddiq bey or Isaiah Stewart aren’t on them
"Same! Isaiah Stewart is my favourite young center, he’s been the best C of his class, and his future is so bright in this league."
"I think you're spot on. After the Detroit Pistons draft 6'8 Cade Cunningham, and he goes on to 3 peat twice alongside 6'8 center Isaiah Stewart, the league will have no choice but to follow suit and go 5 out with 6'8 players"
"Jarrett Allen is a solid defender and rebounder. If it was my team I would only consider defense first big men. If Turner isn't available I would be looking at Jarrett Allen, Isaiah Stewart, Robert Williams, and Nerlens Noel."
"Isaiah Stewart, man is 18 and he could probably take most nba players in a fight."
"if the pistons traded our young core and/or assets for another +30 year old star, im killing myself. the ebst we have is jerami grant, killian hayes, Isaiah stewart, saddiq bey, and first round picks. both sides say no probably"
"I would love if we trade for Isaiah Stewart. No idea how much we would need to give up tho, but I think he would fit the Mavs really well. He has tremendous upside offensively, while he doesn't need the ball much and is already a stud on defense from what I've seen so far. Also, great on the boards which is much needed, given how many second chance points we usually allow."
"I’ve got some weird ones. Trae Young, Isaiah Stewart, Jae’Sean Tate, Kenyon Martin Jr."
"I’m buying Terrance Mann, Saddiq Bey, and Isaiah Stewart stock"
i wonder who'll be better in 2 years robert timelord williams or isaiah beef stewart
6’8 19 yr old Isaiah Stewart absolutely dominated him in their matchups I was so surprised
"Dominant.  Loose ball fouls per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight Howard, 1.39 2. Isaiah Stewart, 0.91 3. Nerlens Noel, 0.72  Non-charge offensive fouls per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight, 1.91 2. KAT, 0.99 3. R. Lopez, 0.77  Offensive goaltending per 100 possessions (minimum 1000 minutes)  1. Dwight, 0.21 2. Jordan, 0.16 3. Holmes, 0.08"
"There is absolutely no way I am taking RJ Hampton over Deni Avdija. Deni is the youngest player in the class and has been utilized in a really poor way by Brooks. Isaiah Stewart should also be above Hampton, he's been excellent this season.  Definitely would take Quickley over Okoro/Poku. He's shown way too much as a contributor on a playoff team already. Also probably a couple guys to take over Nwora including Jae'Sean Tate and Saben Lee"
"RJ Hampton would be higher in my list, also Isaiah Stewart"
"And Isaiah Stewart could've as well, but he had DNP's to start the season because no one knew he was this ready, then also two DNP's in the last two. Played 68 straight until we were forced to lose in order to save the 2nd to last lotto odds."
"&gt; Isaiah Stewart  I like him a lot, but he didn't come out totally dominating or anything. 7.9pts/7reb/solid defense on 60% TS.               Then you look at someone like Shaq, who as a 20 y/o rookie averaged 23/14 lmao."
Tell that to Isaiah Stewart.

"Nah Plumlee was a starter. They started resting him down the stretch to give more minutes to Isaiah Stewart, but Plumlee started every game in which he played last year."

Lakers fans even put Isaiah Stewart in their jersey like what the fuck…  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/ocmz4d/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_a_trade_for_isaiah/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
"Tyrese Halliburton, Isaiah Stewart, Romeo Langford"
isaiah stewart
"Seeing this a little late, but having watched him at Washington his defense was really standout, especially given his struggles at the other end. Isaiah Stewart seemed like the more mature prospect at the time, and while that might hold true in the NBA at the moment, McDaniels certainly has shown that he still has the tools to be successful at the higher level."
"Just to scrimmage and practice against the A team.  Composed of mostly younger guys that has some upside like Herro, Patrick Williams, Naz Reid, Isaiah Stewart"
"I didn’t know how good Isaiah Stewart is, ignore him"
Okay yea see I know literally nothing about Isaiah Stewart
Were you that guy posting “let’s trade Kuzma for Isaiah Stewart” on your sub lmao
"Saddiq Bey. No Homer either. He’s going to be a 20 ppg scorer easily at some point. Has one of the best three balls in the league. Also, has defensive potential.   Other two picks are Poku and Isaiah Stewart. Jaden McDaniels could interesting down the road too.   Last year’s draft was good man.  Don’t feel slighted if I didn’t list your rookie here. I like Quickley, Maxey, Hampton too. Just a deep all around class."
Big fan of Isaiah Stewart and Jaden McDaniels. McDaniels in particular has a lot of skills that could keep him in the league for a long time
Remember when the Hawks took Okongwu over Isaiah Stewart?
"This is a new front office with weaver and his squad. So far he’s made great moves. And weaver decided rather than paying Christian wood who would bring us more wins, to pay jerami grant and replace him with Isaiah Stewart, both of which who play much better defense than wood"
We already have a center from the same draft class as Wiseman who is already better in Isaiah Stewart.
"As a Pistons fan I finally have players that I want to keep around lol. As many suggested before, I would probably move the number down to 6 simply because so many teams don’t have 8 great players to keep around.  (2020-2021 roster) 1. Killian Hayes 2. Isaiah Stewart  3. Saddiq Bey 4. Mason Plumlee  5. Jerami Grant 6. Hamidou Diallo 7.  Sekou Doumbouya 8. Saben Lee  Obviously 1-6 isn’t in really any order, but keeping the starters and all one of the better bench players we’d be fine. Sekou would probably be taken due to potential, but it’d also depend on who else is taken. I don’t believe Saben Lee would be taken due to being a solid rookie but not great enough to warrant being picked."
He barely played for us at all between injuries and Isaiah Stewart quickly outplaying him and earning his minutes in the rotation.
No one talkin bout Isaiah Stewart and this boys been the best center and defender of his class
"I really doubt that happens, they would have won a lot more games without Grant getting injured and they still only had the 6th worst point differential without Cade. I don’t think Terry and half a season of Gordon Hayward is significantly better than Grant, Bey, and Isaiah Stewart"
"Not sure about Cade, who hasn't played an NBA game yet, or Hayes, who was injured for most of his rookie year.   However, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart have already established their roles and skillsets.   Bey was one of the best sharpshooters in that class, shooting 38% on 6 attempts per game. In fact, he made more 3s his rookie year than anyone else in his class period. With improvements on the defensive end, he will be a 3 and D wing ala Klay Thompson or Joe Harris. Even without D, Kyle Korver managed to have a fruitful 17 season career and was even an All Star.   Stewart was the best center in the class, full stop. He was easily the best rim protector in the entire class and he had a clean scoring touch around the rim and even the ability to pop the 3 every now and again. There is a reason Pistons fans are trying to get him to meet with Ben Wallace because he's Ben Wallace but with the ability to score."
You're absolutely right and they got Isaiah Stewart out of the sign and trade deal so I'd like to fully retract that sentiment. Thank you for setting me straight and doing it in a courteous way.
"I mean, Pistons potential roster in 2-3 years:  G/W Killian Hayes  G/W Cade Cunningham  W/F Jerami Grant  W/F Saddiq Bey  F/C Isaiah Stewart   Bench:  G/W Hamidou Diallo  G Saben Lee  W/F Deividas Sirvydis  W/F Sekou Doumbouya   Plus any other draft picks or FA signings. I like that roster, tbh"
"Wood was already gone, the Pistons signed Plumlee after it was already obvious that Wood was gone.   This Pistons management also got Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart with 16th and 19th pick (two all rookie guys), a breakout ""borderline"" all star in Jerami Grant, Hamidou Diallo by giving up Svi Mkhyaluak (idk how to spell it), Josh Jackson for only 5 million (averaged 14 and 4), and Saben Lee in the second round (averaged 6 and 4 in low minutes off the bench).   I'd say they've done fine."
"no, beef stew is isaiah stewart. plumlee is going to the bench next season and probably traded the moment we can get a decent backup C."
I'm guessing Beef Stew is Isaiah Stewart?  I really love that name.
"Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, Mason Plumlee  Corey Joseph, Josh Jackson, Hami Diallo, Sekou Doumbouya, Isaiah Stewart  Is this likely what you guys will look like? Or do you think a few players might be moved? Ala Plumlee and Joseph."
"I loved the Plumlee signing actually, but Isaiah Stewart outperformed expectations and now it’s muddy. But he he’s a positive asset as there was talk he could get a late first at the deadline."
"Yo, the Pistons actually have some solid pieces in place to build around a top pick, especially Cade. Killian Hayes is a high potential rookie guard, Jeremi Grant can provide a leadership role and keep games competitive, Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart were 1st and 2nd All-Rookie team this year."
"Detroit? Wut  I mean Saddiq Bey is nice, Isaiah Stewart looks like he could develop into a good big man but I see fairly little else for optimism. Killian Hayes was injured for a lot of the season, not gonna judge him yet.  Orlando is fucking cursed with injuries lmao. Rockets' future will depend a lot on how the Nets picks they received in the Harden trade pans out.  And you really wanna disrespect the Hawks after what they did this season with one of the youngest rosters in the league?"
a big i would love for them to get would be Isaiah Stewart   his energy would be perfect for this bench unit
"Assuming we're only including players form the last 5 years (So no Curry, Klay, Draymond):  PG: Malcolm Brogdon (2016)  SG: Jordan Poole (2019) (Might be KPJ)  SF: Terance Mann (2019)  PF: Isaiah Stewart (2020)  C: Mitchell Robinson (2018)"
Isaiah Stewart will be a more impactful/better player starting next year
"It's not. And I didn't say it's bad. As I said I like Moses.   However, YOUR point is that the 16th pick is essentially useless.   Yet the guy you use went undrafted in 2019.   In 2019 could've taken guys like Thybulle, keldon Johnson, KPJ, Moses, etc    In 2020 could've gotten you the likes of Precious, Saddiq, Isaiah Stewart, Maxey, McDaniels,     2021 mocks could have the 16 potentially land the likes of Kai Jones, Isaiah Jackson, Zaire Williams, Josh Giddey, Garuba    Hardly a pick with no value lol"
Who is Isaiah Stewart
Isaiah Stewart and Olynyk Klynyk
"Detroit rookies were playing great for their draft pick number. Saddiq Bey as the 19th pick had the same amount of triples per game as Luka and Lillard in their rookie years with better percentage and more attempts (crazy when the season was shorter). And Isaiah Stewart as the 16th pick was the rookie who had more rebounds and blocks and it's not even close - Stew had 86 blocks, while Jaden McDaniels had 60 as the second rookie with most blocks; and he had 453 rebounds while the second best rebounder Jae'Sean Tate had 374.  Not knowing these guys doesn't make you a casual, but you're definitely not invested on how the rookies are doing. It's not even your fault because regarding rookies the media only cared about Lamelo and don't give a shit about Detroit."
"Cade, Grant, Bey, Killian, Isaiah Stewart, Kelly Olynk, Josh Jackson, Hamidou Diallo, Jahlil Okafor, Saben Lee, Cory Joseph, Sekou Dombouya"

I might get downvoted for this but I think Anthony Edwards is the best player in his class over Isaiah Stewart
"Isaiah Stewart. I’m obviously biased but he has 1) great shooting touch from mid and showed he can hits 3’s at a decent volume 2) Plays hard nose defense, can defend some guards on switches and has a lot of promise as a rebounder and shot blocker. 3) Has so much heart and passion when he plays, he’s gonna make a big jump this year."
Isaiah Stewart on the Pistons been wearing em shorter
Isaiah Stewart. Dude is Ben Wallace incarnate in terms of willingness to give it his all.
Isaiah Stewart. I can see him being a very strong PF in the league for years. He has the tools and the toughness.
"Tate, Poole and Isaiah Stewart"
"Yeah, I just got done watching Isaiah Stewart average 8 points in 21 minutes a game this year by doing virtually nothing more than finishing point blank layups off the pick-and-roll and tipping misses, often off the pick and roll.   I love Stew for his effort and willingness to do what he does best, [but it's not too difficult to imagine Ben doing everything in this clip outside of Stew's little 10-foot jumper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_m1TY4TWw&amp;ab_channel=NBAMotion)."
"I always thought Andre Drummond had a Ben Wallace type of offensive skill set but played like he thought he was Hakeem. Andre has some of the worst hands and offensive arsenals I've ever seen but if you caught him sticking to only doing the simple things (dunking lobs thrown by Reggie in the spread pick-and-roll, tipping misses), he was liable to have a monstrous 20-20 night despite literally not doing a couple basic things beyond a rudimentary level.   (The Andre struggle, of course, was *always* the fact that he wanted to be more than that. Isolate on the wing, demand post touches, crossover into defender's chests for contested 13-foot floaters, spot-up for three, stand around and mope when you don't get that foul call, etc.)  Subsequently, it's not too difficult for me to imagine prime Ben Wallace in that rim-running role instead. In fact, it makes me salivate a little. If I could just excise all the garbage Andre brought along with him and swap it out for someone who never stopped working, lived for spoon-fed dunk opportunities, and was amazingly relentless all over the court, well, by golly, that's Ben Wallace and it'd be amazing.    Another way I look at it - 6-foot-8 Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart came in and averaged 7.8 points per game in 21 minutes a night with very little in the way of a get-buckets mentality. He's not a Ben clone because I've seen Stewart showcase a bit of a soft touch here or there, but he's limited enough offensively that I think it's worth noting that big dudes can come into the league and put points on the board these days if they know their roles and stick to them."
Give him a year under Isaiah Stewart  Got Killian and Saddiq way thicker from last season
"I mean our summer league team is pretty garbage just because we don’t have a lick of rim protection or a solid roll man for Cunningham or Hayes, if Isaiah Stewart was healthy I bet the people who only extrapolate from summer league would have a completely different outlook on the team."
No knock on Sengun...but keep in mind he was being guarded by Luka Garza (who can't guard a turtle) and Tyler Cook (who is undersized and not a capable NBA defender).  I would have loved to see Sengun guarded by Isaiah Stewart.
Where is Isaiah Stewart anyways? The team desperately needs him
I think Cade will do fine once his teammates are named Jerami Grant and Isaiah Stewart
Good thing we have Isaiah Stewart when the games matter.
Isaiah Stewart.
Reminder that Cade will have Jerami Grant and Isaiah Stewart rather than Tyler Cook.
"Cade Cunningham and Balsa Koprivica played in Montverde together. They were both drafted by the Pistons this year. In highschool, the one team that kept giving them trouble was La Lumiere, led by Isaiah Stewart. Stewart was taken in the first round by Detroit last season."
"Nope Detroit has 7   Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Killian Hayes, Jerami Grant, Sekou Doumbouya, Saben Lee, and Isaiah Stewart."
"""Cade Cunningham out for season after breaking hand in Pistons brawl which also ends seasons of Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey &amp; Isaiah Stewart."""
"Guys Im lower on than the general consensus: Jaren Jackson, Cam Reddish, Brandon Ingram(to a lesser extent than the other ones he's obviously still good), Myles Turner   Guys Im higher on than the general consensus: Jonas Valanciunas, Isaiah Stewart, Nickiel Alexander Walker, Derrick White,"
"Damn, you're right   2012 Pick 6 Damian Lillard - Home run pick  Pick 11 Meyers Leonard (career backup and heated gamer)  Pick 40 Will Barton (traded third year with others for 35 year old Marcus Camby)  Pick 41 Tyshawn Taylor (traded)  2013 Pick 10 CJ McCollum - another good one  Pick 39 Jeff Withey (traded)  Pick 40 Grant Jerrett (traded)  Pick 45 Marko Todorovic (traded)  2014 (Portlands 24th pick was given in 2011 to Charlotte as part of the trade that got them 65 games of Gerald Wallace  2015 Pick 23 Rondae Hollis Jefferson (traded to Brooklyn)  2016 (first round pick traded year before for Arron Afflalo who left at season’s end)  2017 Pick 15 Justin Jackson (traded)  Pick 20 Harry Giles (traded)  Pick 26 Caleb Swanigan (traded halfway through season)  2018 Pick 24 Anfernee Simons (honestly, doing fine for being the 24th pick)  2019 Pick 25 Nassir Little  2020 Pick 16 Isaiah Stewart (traded)  Pick 46 CJ Elleby"
Wait is that what you guys call Isaiah Stewart? If so that's an awesome nickname!
"Yeah, he's probably better than Plumlee. Just a confusing move to me because I thought the whole purpose of dumping Plumlee was to insert Isaiah Stewart full time into the starting lineup, not to sign Kelly Olynyk."
Markkannen and Isaiah Stewart could be an incredible 4/5 combo
"Nah man I just don't see the fit. They're gonna wanna give Cade and Hayes as much minutes as they can to help push along their development. And I'm pretty sure they view Cade as their point guard of the future. Plus they have Bey, Jerami Grant, and I think Isaiah Stewart. There's no reason for Detroit to sign Dinwiddie or for Dinwiddie to go there."
"Westbrook, Isaiah Stewart"
"Those are role players. How tf is Isaiah Stewart ever going to be a borderline all star, not hating but that dude’s game just does not scream all star. I think you’re overrating all of these guys based on just decent rookie seasons."
"Deni Avdija, Payton Pritchard, and Isaiah Stewart could also be borderline Allstars down the line"
Pistons are my 2nd favorite team after Lakers. Used to go to school with Isaiah Stewart.
"Don't worry... he won't. But he will potentially be the backup 5 out of the gate! Between him, Balsa, and Jah. Isaiah Stewart is starting."
"BOI, I LOVE THIS DRAFT, I'M GONNA NUT.   CADE IS OUR ATARTING GUARD.   ISIAH LIVERS IS OUR BACKUP WING; GREAT VISION AND UNDERRATED ATHLETICISM, JUST NEEDS TO HEAL.   LUKA GARZA IS THE PERFECT BACKUP FOR ISAIAH STEWART. AN ALL DEFENSE DUDE IN STEWART WITH AN ALL OFFENSE DUDE IN GARZA.   I'M FINNA NUT."
"With one pick to come, here's how Detroit's young roster now looks:  **PG:** Cade Cunningham, Killian Hayes, Saben Lee.   **SG:** Hami Diallo, Josh Jackson.  **SF:** Saddiq Bey.  **PF:** (Jerami Grant), Sekou Doumbouya.  **C:** Isaiah Stewart."
"Best day since the goin to work Pistons. Not just because of Cade either. Because of Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Killian Hayes last year. Our young core could be special together."
PG-Killian Hayes SG- Cade Cunningham SF- Saddiq Bey PF- Jerami Grant C- Isaiah Stewart  the future is bright in Detroit they just need a better coach
48 minutes of     ISAIAH STEWART
Isaiah Stewart 📈
Isaiah Stewart wasn't bad in college. Draft pundits just don't like big men if the can't shoot 3s
"Isaiah Stewart went from #3 high school player in the nation, to mocked at around #25 in his class, picked 16 and made all-rookie team"
"* Prestige of being a #1 pick.  * Solid young talent with no pressure to win immediately.  * #1 pick will make $4.5M more than the #2 pick over the course of the rookie contract.  I'd rather grow next to Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Sekou Doumbouya, Jerami Grant (and lots of cap flexibility) than wait out the John Wall/Eric Gordon cap-space-blackhole backcourt in Houston."
Trae Young / LaMelo Ball / Tyrese Haliburton  Luka Doncic / Lu Dort / Desmond Bane  Michael Porter Jr / DeAndre Hunter / Duncan Robinson  Jaren Jackson Jr / John Collins / PJ Tucker  DeAndre Ayton / Xavier Tillman / Isaiah Stewart
Could be both  He’s friends with Saddiq and Isaiah Stewart. We also probably have a better staff and environment to succeed over Houston.
Let’s not forget though that him and Saddiq got the same agent and him and isaiah Stewart been friends since High school at least.  He’s got a lot of reasons to actually like Detroit even past us having the #1 pick
Your Isaiah Jackson prediction reminds me of what happened with Isaiah Stewart
Isaiah Stewart really gonna be the best big man from that draft lol
Isaiah Stewart
"If your team has a young big like Isaiah Stewart or Mitchell Robinson, you're well acquainted with the rule. Even if you watch a bunch of Javale Mcgee games."
"Isaiah Stewart did too, love seeing young undersized players play like dogs"
 Definitely not Tatum.  Isaiah Stewart is gonna leap though
Isaiah Stewart &gt; Saddiq Bey
Lmao those late 2000’s early 2010’s pistons teams with Charlie V were so painful to watch. Watching washed up T-Mac with them was pretty fun but man they were so bad  Future is bright now though… Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey and Cade are gonna turn some heads this season

No... Lmao.   Top 15 players by ORAPTOR  Steph  Jokic  Lillard  Harden  Luka   Kawhi  Trae  LeBron  Kyrie  Mitchell  Beal  Durant  PG  CP3  Giannis  Top 15 players by DRAPTOR  Gobert  Capela  Poeltl  Thybulle  Turner  Embiid  Gibson  Caruso  Dort  Draymond  Gasol  Gay  Derrick White  Isaiah Stewart  Crowder  Which of those lists is a stronger list of players?  The only time people pretend to not realize how much more valuable offense is than defense is trolling about how good players are online.
"The slim chance is that Killian shows potential, Cade is on track for ROY, and Bey and Isaiah Stewart continue progressing. Even then, our bench is terrible so I'd say maybe 5-10% at most of the play-in game."
"Barrett, Tyler Herro, Sexton.  Desmond Bane will have an exceptional career.  Isaiah Stewart will help lead Detroit back to the playoffs.   Malcolm Brogdon will finish a season top-10 in mvp voting"
"Isaiah Stewart was our best rookie last year and it wasn't even close, but Bey was getting all of the attention."
"Nice high effort post!   I'd probably move Wiseman to 30th and Birch to 27th, but everything else I think is pretty much 100%. There are so many players, so who knows how the upcoming season will look.  Only things I would disagree with would be putting Wiseman that high, he was one of the biggest overall negatives for a starter in the league and he tore his meniscus. And put Khem Birch that low, he's a bit small and he's more of a bench player but Isaiah Stewart and Isaiah Roby are both pretty raw."
"Isaiah Stewart, the Pistons center"
"Cade, Cunningham, Cade Cunningham, Jerami Grant and Sadiq Bey  Seriously though Killian and Isaiah Stewart"
Jerami Grant  Cade Cunningham  Saddiq Bey  Isaiah Stewart  Killian Hayes
Did you mean Isaiah Stewart for the Pistons center?

I've said it before but Isaiah Stewart is fun and plays with heart but dude gets blocked a ton lmao
"He’s getting better on offense but that’s what was expected of him and he’s delivered in the defense. Also, look at those drafted after him. Is there really that many people we’d take over him if given the chance to redraft? Saddiq Bey? Isaiah Stewart? Tyrese Maxey? That’s about it, and they were all drafted way after our pick.  https://uproxx.com/dimemag/isaac-okoro-cleveland-cavaliers-rookie-offense-defense-analysis/"

"Yis I'm going for the Pistons slot.   We are finally in full rebuild mode! These are a brand new Pistons. Off the car lot new. Our longest tenured player on our roster is 2020 7th overall pick starting PG Killian Hayes. On opening night vs Chicago he attempted to be tank commander with 0 pts/5 rebs/2 ast/2 TO on 0/6 shooting in 20 mins. G leaguers normally don't start in the NBA. YEESH! New players of note: 1st overall draft pick 'Motor' Cade Cunningham and 2nd round C (NCAA POTY) Luka Garza along with FA signees Kelly Olynyk (can he sustain success from his time in Houston?) and former lottery pick backup F/C Trey Lyles ([Can he get over his distaste for Detroit?](https://www.deseret.com/2018/4/3/20627163/former-utah-jazz-player-trey-lyles-rips-on-utah-quin-snyder-s-practices)). Our 2nd year tank should be aided by Cade injuring his ankle in preseason - which will keep him out likely until after the team's first road trip of the season (at a minimum). Returning players of note include (Ben Wallace mentored) 6'9"" C Isaiah 'Beef Stew' Stewart and sharp shooting SF Saddiq Bey - both alternates for the U.S. Olympic team - as well as Olympian (and 2nd in Most Improved Player voting) F Jeremy Grant.

All I know is I have a good feeling about Brandon Knight moving forward."
He would overlap too much with Isaiah Stewart. I would rather continue our development of our young core than sign Ayton to a max deal.

I made the Pistons trade Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart to the Magic in 2K and they just left and re-signed back in Detroit the next offseason.

Isaiah Stewart. Just always doing something the whole game long. Pumped to see him in a bigger role this season.
"Anthony Edwards, Isaiah Stewart, Tyrese Haliburton, Killian Hayes, Tyrese Maxey, Xavier Tillman, Isaac Okoro  I’m not sure if what to expect from Poku this season, but I’m really rooting for him and hoping he makes a jump this season"
"Starters: PG: Kemba Walker SG: Donovan Mitchell SF: Tobias Harris PF: Jonathan Isaac C: Thomas Bryant  2nd Unit: PG: James Bouknight (Ik he’s technically a SG but I couldn’t find any other PG’s besides Kemba currently in the NBA) SG: Kevin Huerter SF: Danny Green PF: Carmelo Anthony C: Isaiah Stewart  Not an awful team you ask me. Probably gets a spot as a top 6 seed in the playoffs imo. Now, if you include the NYC metropolitan area than you could throw in Bam Adebayo, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving and Jaren Jackson Jr. (all from north Jersey) and now this team is by far the best team in the NBA, but I decided not to do it since technically speaking they aren’t from NY and since it’d be pretty much impossible to afford all those players too being that would be 5 max contracts and a bunch of players making over the vet minimum, but god damn is the NYC metropolitan area stacked with talent now that I look into it."
I don't think he's said anything but I'm glad he's back with the Pistons. Hopefully Isaiah Stewart learns a lot from him.
"Everyone sleeping on the pistons. Dude admitted he doesn’t know shit about them, Saddiq bey and Isaiah Stewart will be beasts next year"
2016: Henry Ellenson becomes Malik Beasley; Michael Gbinijie becomes  Georges Niang  2017: Luke Kennard becomes Donovan Mitchell  2018:  Bruce Brown becomes Justin Jackson; Khyri Thomas becomes Isaac Bonga  2019: Sekou Doumbouya becomes Chuma Okeke; Deividas Sirvydis becomes Daniel Gafford  2020: Killian Hayes becomes Obi Toppin; Isaiah Stewart becomes Aleksej Pokusevski; Saddiq Bey becomes Precious Achiuwa; Saben Lee  becomes Elijah Hughes.  \---  We won as soon as we got Donovan Mitchell.
"Damn, Isaiah Stewart really did come for him. Definitely not in the way we expected"
Good. Just retire. Probably got death threats from elbowing Isaiah Stewart
*Isaiah Stewart:* bro just chill
Good think they held Isaiah Stewart back to keep him from getting infected.
Isaiah Stewart of the Detroit Pistons is nicknamed Beef Stew cause of how beefy he is lol (6’8 250 lbs)
ah yes because isaiah stewart had something to do with originating the dish beef stew
Isaiah Stewart knockout first round
"We lead very different lives. I may not be a big Isaiah Stewart fan, but I am a big beef stew fan. Fucking lived off that high grade dog food that is Dinty Moore in college. I’d be proud to rep beef stew."
"and yet Kelly Olynyk and Isaiah Stewart would be instant starters for us. Olynyk can at least shoot a basketball and even pass! Stewart can rebound a basketball and plays with hustle. They're not the best, but they are NBA guys"
Isaiah Stewart is the most underserving athlete I've ever been asked to pay lip service to.
I think it'd mostly for fans of the Pistons. We have a lot popular branding rn.  Examples:  [Motor Cade](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpanetory.com%2Fcade-cunningham-detroit-motorcade-shirt&amp;psig=AOvVaw0mEZtIeEZi3SwCPJVQr4zn&amp;ust=1638385659516000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPjyg7DkwPQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)  [Beef Stew](https://www.maxxtees.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Detroit-Pistons-Isaiah-Stewart-Beef-Stew-T-Shirt-1.jpg)  [Alt Beef Stew](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkingteeshops.com%2Fproduct%2Fofficial-beef-stew-detroit-style-isalah-stewart-shirt%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw2XzD0l04XAyaLKcKkn_hNr&amp;ust=1638385692628000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCLDcj7_kwPQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAa)
Are we supposed to be scared of the Serbians again this week? I thought we were back to black Americans being the toughest after the isaiah stewart incident
Isaiah Stewart straight up took a lap around the entire court just so everyone on his team got a chance to hold him back
"It's weird that the guy who constantly swings wildly at people with no regard for what he hits when whining for fouls isn't know for being dirty...  I guess slapping Patrick Beverley, throwing am elbow at Meyers Leonard, slapping Cameron Payne, shoulder barging Enes Kanter when he had a separated shoulder, shoulder barging Markieff Morris doesn't count. Sure as shit makes for a longer video than Isaiah Stewart who's been branded dirty already by some."
Isaiah Stewart last week
Detroit runs through Isaiah Stewart 😤
"If this was on Isaiah Stewart, even accidentally, it would have been hilarious"
"“I played soccer, and I was into boxing before I started playing basketball serious in the fifth grade,” said Stewart, who won the Naismith High School Player of the Year award. “Ever since I picked up a basketball it intrigued me. I started working hard at it in middle school.  [https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-basketball/im-a-different-dude-isaiah-stewart-is-bringing-more-than-just-dynamic-talent-to-washington/](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-basketball/im-a-different-dude-isaiah-stewart-is-bringing-more-than-just-dynamic-talent-to-washington/)  I don't know, maybe he didn't actually boxed in high school."
If they were hypnotized into fighting all out I would take LeBron. But as it stands I’d take stew   LeBron has been rich and comfortable for basically as long as Isaiah has alive haha. He has too much to lose and nothing to prove as opposed to Stewart being the opposite
the lakers fans booing isaiah stewart literally makes no sense lmao
Watching AD pump fake eight times while Isaiah Stewart just stands there with a hand in the face is peak television
"steph jumped into the defender, it was a good no call.  steph should be checked for steroids use causing him to have these uncontrollable outbursts, the same that Isaiah Stewart is taking."
"&gt;[LeBron James] swung at Pistons center [Isaiah Stewart] and connected in the eye and things escalated from there.   You're arguing the semantics of a punch or a hit or a slap. It doesn't matter. Lebron struck him in the face and started the whole thing. He's a dirty player, but he constantly gets away with it because he's Lebron. Keep defending him. Stewart overreacted, but Lebron deserves the heat as well for constantly starting shit.   https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lebron-james-ejected-for-punch-to-isaiah-stewarts-eye-lakers-pistons-players-repeatedly-separated/"
Look up Isaiah Stewart on YouTube and you’ll see exactly what I mean. He’s a bush league ass player.   Add to the fact that he’s the worst offensive piece of the leagues worst offensive system and plays mediocre defense at best
"Not a great example bc he still has a lot to prove, but Isaiah Stewart was a top HS prospect but slid in the draft because of how Washington used him and now is looking like the best C in the 2020 draft"
No way they submitted Isaiah Stewart as the reason for him being questionable. Couldn't they go with a sprained ankle or something?

Isaiah Stewart will feast
"Okay since your hate boner for lebron is so strong let me spell it out for you.   Isaiah is young, 20 years old. Lebron is almost 37. There is wayyyy fucking larger sample size for Lebron than Isaiah. Lebron has been in the league for so long that something like this happening won’t affect him as much. Dude is about to retire in a few years. Stewart on the other hand needs to be more careful because he’s younger, and much more susceptible to build a reputation of being hot headed and out of control, so he needs to make sure this is a one off incident.   ***What Lebron did was fucked up, he deserved to be ejected, he deserved to be suspended, he deserved to be fined.***But at the end of the day his career is almost over, he’s built enough credibility at this point to where the league won’t be harsh because he doesn’t have a history of doing stuff like this.   Stewart on the other hand needs to make sure this is a one time thing because what he did was fucked up too. Not to lebron, but to all the staff members and members of the organization he trucked over just to try and fight lebron. Shit is unprofessional, period, as an adult he’s gotta be better. Guys have been hit harder and done a way better job of maintaining their composure. What happens when the next guy comes and cheap shots him? Who knows, he hasn’t been in the league long enough. But he needs to get it in his head he shouldn’t respond that way again. He’s got a bright future in the league."
Anyone who has followed Isaiah Stewart through his short career knows that has already defined who he is and that he does not belong in the NBA
If Isaiah Stewart is the cause of Lebron's downfall I'm totally here for it.
"Isaiah Stewart to everybody interested: We gon chill fa now, Cause I don't wanna get suspended again, traded, or cut. But when the time is right.... We gon see!"
"If Isaiah Stewart hadn’t done this crazy shit, maybe people would be talking about Lebron more. Lebron is lucky Stewart made such a fool of himself.   Also, a player “accidentally” hitting someone during game time is way more commonplace than bum-rushing a guy 3 times after the whistle. So obviously people are going to talk about Stewart’s behaviour more."
I would like to personally thank Isaiah Stewart for blessing us with a golden meme format 🙏🏽
&gt;  Isaiah Stewart doesn't know how to control his body   Didn't my man box growing up?
Yeah I’m afraid of Isaiah Stewart barreling through my door and beating me down. You are so weird.
Let me know if there’s something else Detroit Pistons Center Isaiah Stewart is known for
The only reason I know of Isaiah Stewart is the lebron incident and I watch/follow the nba a lot lol
Neither would get clapped. Isaiah Stewart doesn't know how to control his body and Bron wouldn't really try to hit him at all (nor do I think he can fight either).
"[Woj]: ""Isaiah Stewart has been traded to the Globo Gym Purple Corbas, sources tell ESPN."""
"I don’t really understand why people are so confident it wasn’t an accident lol. Like Lebron has literally never been considered a dirty player and no disrespect to him, but who is Isaiah Stewart to make him risk 20 years of being considered a clean player for a dirty shot on a guy half his age? It looks worse if you slow it down sure but it was like a split second in real time and I totally believe he was just trying to get his arm out from under him and swung his arm too far out and wacked him in the face on accident."
"Somebody mentioned Allen, I'd add Yuta and Isaiah Stewart as well. Isaiah has been postered a LOT"
"Cade Cunningham, for the game where he prevented Isaiah Stewart from vivisecting Lebron.  But seriously, I vote for Cade."
"You throw 250 pound Jalen Duren next to 250 pound Isaiah Stewart? Forget about Beef Stew, shit’s the 500 pound Beef Crew"
"I think Draymond is amazing and does a lot that doesn't show up in either the stat sheet or the advanced stat sheet. When he's motivated, he does such a great job covering for all his teammates, it's insane.  To supplement this, I looked at players with at least 100 DFGA. That comes out to approx. 5 shots defended per game in the 17-19 games so far this season.  https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defense-dash-overall/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=PCT_PLUSMINUS&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=D_FGA*GE*100  Rudy's also been amazing, if I may say so myself. He's defended the most shots so far this season, with 330 DFGA and holding opponents to 38.2%, with an expected FG% of 46.2%, an 8% difference. You have to go all the way down to Deni Avdija's 203 DFGA to find a player who has a bigger absolute margin (35.0% - 43.8% = 8.8%). Draymond's at 180 shots defended with (40.6% - 45.3% = -4.8%, rounding presumably).  (Bold: Outliers, Italics: OP mentioned)  Other effective players include:  * **Rudy Gobert: 330 shots defended, DFG% - FG% = -8%** * Mo Bamba: 300 DFGA, -5.4% * Myles Turner: 280 DFGA, -4.3% * John Collins: 279 DFGA, -5.2% * *Giannis Antetokounmpo: 249 DFGA, -2.2%* * Jaren Jackson Jr.: 222 DFGA, -6.0% * *Paul George: 220 DFGA, -0.4%* * Kevin Durant: 212 DFGA, -3.9% * Devin Booker: 208 DFGA, -3.4% * Isaiah Stewart: 204 DFGA, -5.5% * **Deni Avdija**: 203 DFGA, -8.8% * *Deandre Ayton: 198 DFGA, -0.5%* * Bobby Portis: 194 DFGA, -5.9% * Luguentz Dort: 192 DFGA, -4.4% * LaMelo Ball: 190 DFGA, -6.3% * Davion Mitchell: 188 DFGA, -6.4% * Isaiah Hartenstein: 184 DFGA, -6.5% * *Draymond Green: 180 DFGA, -4.8%* * Bam Adebayo: 176 DFGA, -8.6% * **Derrick Rose**: 146 DFGA, -12.8%, with a DFG% of 30.8%! * Joel Embiid: 146 DFGA, -6.8% * Luke Kennard: 138 DFGA, -7.6% * **Patrick Beverley**: 122 DFGA, -11.9% * **Matisse Thybulle**: 114 DFGA, -11.3% * **Eric Gordon**: 115 DFGA, -10.5% * Austin Reaves: 106 DFGA, -7.6%  More players if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75 include Mike Muscala (-14.8%!), Taj Gibson, DeAndre' Bembry, Tony Bradley, Jaxson Hayes, Landry Shamet(?), ...  Ineffective players include:  * **Kyle Lowry: 216 DFGA, +8.8%** (wtf) * **Dejounte Murray: 205 DFGA, +8.3%** (he was in the conversation of all-D) * Kemba Walker: 188 DFGA, +6.9% * Ja Morant: 179 DFGA, +7.1% * Luka Doncic: 178 DFGA, +6.1% * Darius Garland: 170 DFGA, +7.5% * Saddiq Bey: 159 DFGA, +7.4% * Cade Cunningham: 153 DFGA, +6.2% * **Bojan Bogdanovic**: 148 DFGA, +10.1% (ugh this lines up with the eye test) * Kyle Anderson: 135 DFGA, +11.2% * Donovan Mitchell: 129 DFGA, +8.7% (this one too) * Cody Zeller: 104 DFGA, +12.0% * Facundo Campazzo: 100 DFGA, +11.2%  A lot more players pop up if the DFGA threshold is lowered to 75, including Xavier Tillman, Gary Harris, Chuma Okeke, Kira Lewis Jr., Chimezie Metu, ...   Disclaimer: DFG% can be unfair, especially if you're a player who's always asked to defend the opposing team's best player. Royce O'Neale gets screwed by the difficulty of his defensive assignments, so I find it really impressive his DFG% difference is -0.6%, despite getting put on everyone from KD to DeRozan to Booker to Tatum to Ja."
I'm looking forward to Isaiah Stewart offending Lebron when they meet again on Sunday.
"Without DJ on the court conducting an ocular patdown, how is LeBron supposed to focus on basketball knowing that any time Isaiah Stewart might come rushing in to attack him?"
"Girl: ""Isaiah Stewart is in the building.""  Lebron:"
Someone give Isaiah Stewart the Oscar.
Mans tryna avoid playing Isaiah Stewart again.
Isaiah Stewart?
"""Isaiah Stewart gonna whoop your ass"" or something like that"
Revenge for Isaiah Stewart i guess
Isaiah Stewart has entered the chat
Yeh LeBron is a cunt that gets away with so much shit because he is the face of the NBA at the moment. The only reason he got in trouble this time was because Isaiah Stewart reacted so strongly it couldn't be ignored. All the others featured in those clips aren't the type to escalate things.
"With Kelly Olynyk out and Isaiah Stewart suspended, I thought maybe this was Detroit's chance to give Ben Wallace some spot minutes at the five."
No you're telling me Isaiah Stewart hasn't had a soft life. Why do you think so? Because he got really mad yesterday?
Isaiah Stewart might disagree
Didn't expect to see:  &gt;Adult Film Star Kendra Lust Calls Out Anthony Davis For Not Confronting Isaiah Stewart During Fight With LeBron James  when Googling Isaiah Stewart.
It doesn't make any sense that they're punishing Isaiah Stewart harsher than LeBron. They tried to spin it like he was wrong for going after LeBron. He knew that Isaiah was standing there and he did it intentionally. I'm sick of his flopping ass. He needs to flop his ass off the court permanently.
"How can they punish Isaiah Stewart harsher than LeBron? And they try to play it like he was wrong for going after LeBron. He is a flopping sucker who deserves to get suspended for several games. He knew that Isaiah was standing there, he did it intentionally."
"Anyone that has made any kind of comment about Isaiah Stewart being soft or fake tough after what we've seen already have brain damage and wouldn't need him to make it any worse. Proof: Blake Griffin talking shit, Stewart would tune him like a grand piano"
"I know he's been talked about recently for other reasons, but Isaiah Stewart.  He strikes me as a blue collar guy who does the rebounding and dirty work (setting screens, defense, being an enforcer, etc) and but won't get accolades for it.  Still only 20 and has shown flashes of 3 point shooting."
"Yep - [listed on his basketball reference page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stewais01.html)  &gt;For much of the season, Detroit Pistons rookie Isaiah Stewart has shown his physicality and high motor. It has earned him the nickname “Beef Stew” and on Tuesday he had the chance to cook up a batch off the court.  &gt;“I’m just embracing it,” Stewart said after practice on Tuesday. “That’s the name the fan base gave me and like I said that’s the name I’m going to roll with. Some people like it, some people don’t but I think it’s cool.” [Source](https://www.mlive.com/pistons/2021/04/pistons-isaiah-stewart-channels-beef-stew-off-the-court-in-new-cooking-video.html)"
"[Glasspiegel] LeBron James: ""A voice from behind me says, ‘Bоy that popcorn smells good.’ I turn around to say ‘Yeah it smells awesome.’ I turn around and it’s Isaiah Stewart… I absolutely choked, I am not joking, I turned around, said ‘Yeahhh,’ and then sprint through the gate and back to my room.”"
Isaiah Stewart: “😥”
"Xavier Tillman, Payton Pritchard, Isaiah Stewart"
"Isaiah Stewart obviously.  He isn't just a basketball player, he can also break tackles and do MMA."
Jokic will smack the shit outta Isaiah Stewart. Foh.
Y’all remember in madden when that one commentator would go “he’s got getting away from the cops speed!”? Whenever Lebron is running they gotta start saying “he’s got running away from Isaiah Stewart speed!”
Yeah no I definitely agree with you some of these guys get really bad beer balls and just need to see the dog shit kicked out of a drunk mf once every 5-7 years so they remember these are world class athletes and they can absolutely beat you down.  Going on twitter and seeing so many people calling Isaiah Stewart fake tough when he’s been in like 7 situations after like a year in the league is the dumbest thing to me. Like they’d never even think about saying shit to his face
Here in Detroit our teams might not be any good but hey at least Isaiah Stewart and Dan Campbell make for a decent spectating experience.
I want Isaiah Stewart to knock bron out cold on Sunday. Then he retires Monday out of embarrassment
"Need a skit years from now, in the vein of that Kobe/Jalen Rose one, where LeBron sits down to order at a restaurant and Isaiah Stewart walks by.   Waiter: “What can I get for you, sir?”  LeBron, staring at Stewart: “I’ll take the beef stew...extra beef.”"
"Isaiah Stewart has been suspended for two games for a flagrant 2 on Haldir, league sources tell @Aragorn_Wojnumenorski."
Isaiah Stewart will now play an NBA game before I am next able to sleep
Isaiah Stewart would BEAT LeBron
Isaiah Stewart keeps it Fifty-fiiiiifth Street
Are you playing dumb or are you ignorant of the unwritten rules and the difference between Lebron James being punched and Isaiah Stewart being punched?
The Spurs would've won if Isaiah Stewart didn't get suspended.
If it was me Lebron would be gone for the season and Isaiah Stewart a week to both recover and think about what he did back to lebron
"Honestly, the only fair result would be equal punishments.  What LeBron is terrible.  How Isaiah acted was terrible (but understandable).  LeBron started it, none of it would've happened if he hadn't intentionally assaulted Stewart."
"I think that fair would've been the same amount of games suspended, LeBron pretty clearly intentionally hit him.  Isaiah Stewart responded with too much anger, thus earning him a suspension too.   When you get punched in the face hard enough to bleed like that, many people will lose it, so Isaiah's anger is at least understandable.   LeBron's cheap shot was not understandable, it was despicable.  Not punishing him to the same degree that Isaiah was punished shows that it's okay give cheap shots, it's not okay to respond to them."
Isaiah Stewart almost died from a brush against Lebrons forearm. Imagine what a full fledge punch would do. He soft as baby shit
Ok but let’s be honest here… being bloodied by one of the goats is something your always going to remember. Like this young dude caused one of the best ever to be suspended for the first time. Isaiah Stewart immediately gets into my hall of fame lmao
“IT’S GUTCHECK TIME” - Isaiah “Daffy “Beef Stew” Duck” Stewart
Adebate has erupted on social media over LeBron James' conduct as a player after the NBA star was ejected from Sunday's Los Angeles Lakers-Detroit Pistons game over an incident with Isaiah Stewart.
Isaiah Stewart is a lucky man. I was thinking 5-10 games.
"I read it as, The Athletic Lebron James tried to track down Isaiah Stewart...... wtf does his athletic ability have to.....ohhhh"
Didn't Stewart actually box though? I know Lebron is an inch taller but Isaiah looks a lot bigger overall.
[Isaiah Stewart 7 minute fight compilation ](https://youtu.be/jAzN8QlpvaM)  This is only his second season
"Everyone's different. I don't blame Stewart for his aggression towards LeBron. He popped him in the face close to his eye with an elbow/forearm. I would be mad if someone did that to me. The problem here is a lack of basic respect on the court. The style of play today is overly aggressive, and totally unnecessary. On the other hand, The NBA is a fan driven sport, and I just don't see LeBron getting hit with any real punishment. Stewart is a different issue, as he had to be restrained multiple times, which could lead to a substantial fine and suspension. Gilbert Arenas assessment of  Isaiah Stewart, is a possibility. Hope it doesn't happen, but it is a possibility."
Isaiah “Sirius Black” Stewart
Isaiah Stewart was the maddest he's even been in his entire life.
"&gt;LeBron James returned from an eight-game absence on Friday and went back to being a jump-shooter, with only two free throw attempts in 53 total minutes and with 17 of his 23 weekend shots coming from outside the paint. Of course, that doesn’t include the shot that Isaiah Stewart took above the eye on Sunday. With that flagrant-2 foul from James, four different Lakers have been ejected from games this season — and none of the four are Dwight Howard.  That made chuckle lmao"

Isaiah Stewart gonna be a beast
Isaiah Stewart lol
"Pleasant: Isaiah Stewart  When we drafted him I didn’t know who he was since I don’t watch college ball. Seemed like he could be real solid for us and so far on the defensive end he’s done so much better than I thought he would. It also seems like he annoys the fuck out of whoever he’s guarding and I couldn’t ask more from a rookie. Even offensively he’s shown he may have some range in the future, form looks nice so far.  Unpleasant: Blake Griffin  It just hurts seeing him play now, his body has more or less given up on him. He locks himself up on offense and he can’t even really move on defense. End of that warriors game the other day you can see him limping off the court. Love what he did for us two years ago, and I absolutely love the attitude and professionalism he’s brought, but he’s definitely not the same player he was"

"In the past year the owner has stepped back from meddling and actually allowed the new GM (Troy Weaver who was an assistant GM with the Thunder) do an actual full rebuild. The Gores meddling is part of the reason the team had been so bad. He had a playoffs or bust mentality and forced a lot of the bad moves the team made without taking the blame.   Gores told Dumars he had to get stars when he first arrived which led to us signing Josh Smith (because realistically what legit star is coming to Detroit in free agency) and forced the Brandon Knight Kris Middleton for Brandon Jennings trade (Dumars was very high on Middleton and thought he had the chance to be good but playoffs and win now takes precedent right). After he fired Dumars instead of hiring a coach and GM that might develop a young core (Drummond, Dinwiddie, and KCP all looked promising at the time) he hired Stan Van Gundie to be the Coach/GM and told him we where a win now team.   Obviously a lot of stuff happened over the Van Gundy years but I think the most obvious ways Gores win now directive hurt us where the Stanley Johnson pick, Blake Griffin trade, and Luke Kennard pick. Long story short Johnson was picked over better players because he played NBA level defense and was considered the best option to help the team immediately (tbf he looked decent in that playoff series his 1st year). Kennard was picked over Donovan Mitchell because Kennard shot well and would help the team immediately. Where as Mitchell was seen by the franchise as someone that would take sometime to develop. While Blake Griffin was traded for because Gores told Van Gundy playoffs or bust and he was trying to save his job. Gores meddling has hurt the team for years and was a major reason we couldn't rebuild.  Recently though Gores has stepped back and has allowed to Troy Weaver to start a full rebuild which is refreshing to see. Also Weaver got Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart in his 1st draft who both look to be good. Hayes looks bad right now but he was supposed to be project so I'm not worried yet. Last year the Pistons got Doumbouya who has potential. Also n free agency Weaver signed Josh Jackson who was showing flashes of a breakout with us before his injury. As well as Jerami Grant who is showing that he can be a legitimately great player. This is honestly the most excited I've been about the Pistons in years.  Also the Pistons are managing to tank while being super competitive in the games they've played. They had 3 bad losses to Milwaukee but other than that everyone game has come down to the wire. I know Pistons fans keep saying this but they're not nearly as bad as their record indicates and looking at net ratings shows that [bbref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2021_ratings.html). They're 17th in the leauge in adjusted Net Rating and they're 22nd if you use [NBA.com's](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1) unadjusted Net rating. Basically we get to watch competitive basketball while the team is tanking and I'm really happy about that. I also like the moves Weaver has made and think he is a good GM. So I'm happy about the future."
Isaiah Stewart = a mixture of Dennis Rodman/Ben Wallace/Bill Laimbeer
"Hayes was starting prior to injury. Isaiah Stewart had been doing well and earned himself the backup 5 spot. Saddiq bey is getting good minutes on the bench and starts on nights that Blake is resting. Sekou is probably getting the least time as he is still raw, but coaches and best writers seem to see him progressing daily in practice. Also kinda unfortunate circumstance for him as he is behind Blake and grant for playing time at the 4"
"Team : Pistons  Rookies : Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart  &amp;#x200B;  Hayes looked really rough, his handles was bad, he looked pretty slow, he coukdn't make his step back 3's, some decent passes and played hard on defense, I still believe in the ceiling but the floor is super low  Bey : looks great as a shooter, pretty versatile and quick release, completly powerless from 2 for now, really solid defender one on one, moves his feet well, pretty sure he'll have a 10 years career as a 3&amp;D guy at worst  Stewart : plays crazy hard, not really skilled on offense, but hs shown flashes of good defensive potential, I dont like picking centers in the draft, but he's been as good as coud'vve been expected"
Isaiah Stewart and Saddiq Bey
I really enjoy watching Isaiah Stewart play. The guy just hustles all game long.

Isaiah Stewart is eerily similar to Ben Wallace/Dennis Rodman type. That was a home run pick.
"Thats completely irrelevant. RoCo is a much better asset than Ariza, Isaiah Stewart + a late FRP. Even if the Blazers get completely embarrassed in the playoffs, they can simply flip RoCo for a few more picks."
"The Pistons really bailed them out with that Wood trade. WTF were they thinking.   They GAVE AWAY a first to SEND Wood out? And took back a contract that they just sent out for nothing in Ariza.   And all they get is a 16th pick in  Isaiah Stewart? I hope that dude pans out, because that looks like a shit trade."
both Saddiq Bey and Isaiah Stewart. its been 9 games and i already love them. Sekou too I guess. He hasnt been playing well but id be pissed if we traded him before hes had a full season so play in the NBA
"Nope. They made Sign&amp;Trade to send Wood to the Rockets and got from them the 16th Pick (Isaiah Stewart) and Ariza  DETAILS The Rockets by trading Covington to Portland got Ariza+16th Pick+2021 Protected 1st.  Detroit then made a 3-team trade with Dallas and OKC. The Pistons got Delon Wright (Dallas), the Mavs got James Johnson (OKC), the Thunder got Ariza (Detroit) and Justin Jackson (Dallas)"
Isaiah Stewart plays like a bull in a china shop. Bodies are always falling to the floor when he's around
"He was hands down the best player in the PAC-12. Even with Isaiah Stewart, Oscar Da Silva, Okongwu, and Remy, it wasn’t really up for debate. Also that sweet 16 Oregon team with him, Bol Bol and Louis King was fucking sick. Got to catch one of their tourney games in person and he controlled everything. Knew he’d have a career in the NBA, he’s an absolute dog."
After watching the draft video about him. I knew Isaiah Stewart was going to ball out in the nba
You will rue the day you called Isaiah Stewart an obscure bench player.
"Isaiah Stewart, he’s a rookie."
Man Isaiah Stewart is a beast and he’s only a rookie. I can’t wait for a year or two when he gets a better grasp on the game
"that’s r/detroitpistons hero isaiah stewart to you   show some respect, he’s a beast already and only growing"
At least Isaiah Stewart &amp; Saddiq Bey are looking like pretty good picks.
Oh my god. They called a foul on Jaylen because Isaiah Stewart wasn’t even playing defense on him. He wasn’t on his hip chasing him like Rivers. He was literally walking down the court to get to the low post and Brown had to jump a few feet to the side to even touch him. Rivers is right on top of Trae here. It’s completely different
"Isaiah Stewart, PG, and Kyrie"
"Meh, Isaiah Stewart looks like one of the worst players in the league at the moment."
"He's averaging 2 more contested shots than Poeltl in 5 more minutes per game.  Al Horford is averaging the same 3 point contests and 3 less 2 point contests per game in 29 mins a game.  Isaiah Stewart is averaging 1 less 2 point contest in 12 less minute per game.  People need to stop using this stats as a some great, dominant defensive metric."
Isaiah Stewart and his nickname
Im like 99% sure the Nets would love to have Isaiah Stewart
"""Hello, police, beef stew is trying to beat me up""   ""Hello police, this is Blake griffin, Isaiah Stewart is trying to get in the locker room, get down here, save me"""
I like the tiny little mini-rivalry developing between Blake Griffin and Isaiah Stewart. I enjoyed Blake's time in Detroit and seeing him getting chippy with a former teammate makes his return more fun. The Pistons have a history of things like this ([Mahorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE2e86u3gBQ&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=RyanVanDusen) and [Rodman's](https://youtu.be/6-R9oEcKM-E?t=1) returns) so it's nice to see the next gen take their turn.
Blake plays the same way every game. I don’t understand why Pistons fans think he’s gonna play any differently against them. Isaiah Stewart plays the exact same way and you guys call it “Detroit mentality”. Kind of hypocritical.
Isaiah Stewart just bitched Blake Griffin🤣🤣
Isaiah Stewart making a big impact right now in the fourth

I'm kind of in awe of that Isaiah Stewart block.
That's an incredible block by Isaiah Stewart. Good lord do you not see that often.
"He was never advertised as an explosive player, we haven’t seen him run much PnR with an effective roll man aside from … Isaiah Stewart lol"
We've done solid defensively but our offense is just not working.  Weve been good at finding the open man with space but our shots arent falling at all. Even then there isnt enough off-ball movement either.  Ive liked that Saddiq Beys doing quite a bit more offensively compared to last year where he mostly was taking spot up 3s. He's actually doing a but more off the dribble while attacking the rim more. Didnt think he'd be doing this type of shit this early into his second year too be honest. Dude had a damn 20/16 game and it wasnt expected.  Jerami is in a slump right now and has been trying to force too much. He's gotta calm down offensively.  Isaiah Stewart has been in a mini slump but ive liked what ive seen so far. Think a lot has to do with an ankle injury over the offseason that left him in a boot.  Killians been doing better each game despite the box score. Our offense and defense looks much better with him on it and he looks to be getting more comfy driving to the rim. The scoring will come im not worried. Hes also got some active ass hands on defense that i love.  Josh Jacksons defense has been fun. Keeps getting dope ass blocks but his offense hasnt been great to start the season  Maple Dick has looked like the bedt player on the team for a backup C and is worth the contract.   Cade in his one game already made the offense look better and the man got all 7 of his rebounds in the first quarter and i appreciate the hustle he showed in his very limited minutes. Watching the young guys get better is the only reason im watching this year  Expectations are low this season. So i cant be too mad i guess.
And Saddiq Bey. And Isaiah Stewart.

"This seems quite fair.   However, I've mostly steered clear of the Pistons subreddit over the past 24 hours so I imagine there's plenty of folks in there who do not agree.   I'm still all about Isaiah Stewart—he's a workhorse and is 100 percent effort and I've missed having that in my frontcourt—but he went a little crazy yesterday. I understand it to some degree but that dude went about four degrees past what'd constitute a normal displeased reaction."
"That elbow to Isaiah Stewart was in no way a basketball move, that’s crossed the line into real violence. Any action that purposefully puts other athletes at heightened risk is super dirty. This includes pushing people in the air, tripping, slide tackling… on a lot of courts you’d get your ass kicked for less than what he did yesterday."
*”Lets talk outside the stadium big homie…  -Isaiah Stewart*
"If the backhand was all that happened, we'd probably not even be here discussing the matter beyond acknowledging LeBron being ejected for a flagrant 2.   The reason this incident is dominating the league is because our dude (Isaiah Stewart) went completely berserker. He took what would have been a mostly contained exchange and poured gasoline on top of kerosene on top of a downed power line draped along a puddle of motor oil.   Nobody would be suspended if it weren't for Stew. I'm still a fan of the big guy, but I can acknowledge he may have gone a bit overboard there and the punishments make sense as a result."
y'all acting like he andre johnson'ed Isaiah stewart lmao
"Meanwhile, Hare Krishnas are already giving Isaiah Stewart the Steven Segal treatment."
lol Reggie so lame. If Isaiah Stewart really want to do something he would have done it when they were face to face.
Yeah if Isaiah Stewart looks like he's about to act up Silver will force lightning him to death
Isaiah Stewart isn’t going to do anything. No one is
Isaiah Stewart is lucky it's only 2 games. NBA went easy on him.
This was 100% my first thought after seeing the Isaiah Stewart clip. Bron was mad he was losing against a team he *felt* like he should be better than.
I want to see Jake Paul call out Isaiah Stewart.
"Guys clearly it was when LeBron squared up, looked Isaiah Stewart dead in the eye, wound his fist back, and violently punched him the face."
Jesus people are already giving Isaiah Stewart the Chuck Norris treatment.
"Im imagining Bron having Stewart over for a Taco Tuesday, and everything is friendly, but everytime Bron would get up or leave the room, Isaiah would stare at him with cold intent as he leaves"
"Are you talking [this?](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/2020/06/18/isaiah-stewarts-family-helped-drive-his-rise-nba/3200097001/):   &gt;It might be a surprise to some, but both parents say Stewart grew up a quiet child that enjoyed soccer and boxing.       Or this from the Athletic?:      &gt;He then graduated to boxing, a sport that Isaiah deems as his first love. Due to Isaiah’s size for his age, the 10-year-old was often sparring against kids two or three years his senior. His long reach and active mind allowed him to excel relative to others at the local boxing gym.        Because characterizing childhood boxing as “fighting random people” is accurate but hilariously misleading."
No one gonna talk about Isaiah Stewart having  3 in 16 games?
"Half of analysts: Isaiah Stewart had his shot at LeBron, didn't take it, then faked it when he was being held back  Other half of analysts: Don't fuck with Isaiah Stewart, he is the new Bill Laimbeer"
"I doubt that many people are worried about Isaiah ""Ivan Johnson with anger issues"" Stewart"
Isaiah Niko style Stewart
"Isaiah Stewart has been boxing since he was 10 years old. Boxing is actually how he got into other sports. I know what you're saying because I'm a ufc and boxing fan. To an untrained fighter, a reach advantage isn't much of a factor but Isaiah is trained."
"at first I read this as “Lebron James tried to track down Isaiah Stewart after the game”, and thought it was a really bad idea"
"Gilbert Arenas just highlighted the reason nobody talks about him and why his career ended the way it did. This IG post was dumb and painful to read, especially coming from a former NBA player with a career that was littered with mistakes and bad decisions.  Its not cool, when you try to create relevance for yourself, from another person's error. Look what happened to Isaiah Stewart's face, whether LeBron did it intentionally or not is beside the point. This post from Gilbert, was selfish, insensitive and was his attempt towards resurfacing his relevance. Let us not forget, Gilbert Arenas had an argument with a teammate over a gambling game and he brought 4 guns to team practice 2 days later to shoot his teammate. Wow! He is now using another person's incident to publicly side with LeBron and Jordan to benefit from their media momentum.   This should be about Isaiah Stewart and/or LeBron James, not about telling the injured player why he shouldn't have reacted and how he should have reacted. This IG post is upsetting."
Isaiah Stewart?
How many people do you think LeBron had to message? I mean his teammate Wayne Ellington literally played with Isaiah Stewart last season lol it wouldn’t have needed to reach Shams when he coulda just asked Ellington in the dressing room for his number. Unless Ellington told Shams…
Should have been Isaiah Stewart
"Because the guy was completely unhinged on the court, not because people actually give a damn about Isaiah Stewart."
Isaiah Stewart is black too stfu
😂 Isaiah Stewart is a trained boxer and boxing is still his first love over basketball.  Lebron would be dropped inside of 30 seconds.
"you guys overestimate how much this sub matters, literally nobody cares about *Isaiah Stewart* and even this sub will forget in ~48 hours until it's time for the next LeBron hate-fest."
"""LeBron James accidentally hit Isaiah Stewart in the face""  OKAY AUTHOR."
Silver: Isaiah Stewart will appear in public in a few days he is feeling unwell right now.
"Isaiah Stewart trick ya'll man. But I agree. If he really wanted to get to LeBron, he could have. Altercation was wilder than we typically see, but I still saw some ""hold me back"" in there."
"More like [Isaiah Stewart ""running after"" Lebron.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1KEC_3vygc)"
Do we start the Isaiah Stewart all-star campaign now?   Does Team Lebron pick him to keep from playing against him?
"It you want to argue that Isaiah Stewart deserves to be punched for box out shenanigans, can I introduce you to Dwight Howard? Steven Adams? And every center ever? Jesus man, get your shit together."
"Yep, Isaiah Stewart considered the Piston’s roster situation and season aspirations carefully, mulled over how an aggressive act may affect his team and the organization, as well as his own personal prosperity. Ultimately, he found that it was in the best interest of all parties to rip a man limb from limb in front of 15,000 people and on live television."
Zion and Isaiah Stewart would make an NFL OLine shit their pants
"Or, say, Isaiah Stewart kicking Luka in the nuts."
"That's why I feel Isaiah Stewart should be penalized, he responded badly and could have genuinely hurt people who were looking out for him. The security and assistants can't basically use force on a player and he was out there for a blood. Imagine one misstep and he would have injured cade for a long time.  He might have been hurt intentionally  but he too was hurting people intentionally. If something wrong happens to you shouldn't justify you doing wrong to other people."
"Some context on why CoJo was over there:  &gt;	QUESTION: Why wasn’t Cory Joseph assessed a technical foul?  &gt;FOSTER: After Isaiah Stewart left the court, Cory was anticipating he may come around the back of house and enter the Laker bench from the opposite side. So, he was going to intercept him. I actually told Cory that would be good.  From the [NBA Pool Report](https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-ejection-of-lebron-james-and-isaiah-stewart-in-the-third-quarter-of-tonights-los-angeles-lakers-at-detroit-pistons-game/)"
"Cade wasn’t profecting Isaiah, he was protecting Lebron James. He loves Lebron! It’s his goat. I would protect Lebron too in the same position. I don’t give a F about Isaiah Stewart.."
I think LeBron will get 1 game (based on jokic’s precedent) and Stewart will get 2 for escalating. No denying that LeBron was reckless. Isaiah running through staff and throwing people around is very reckless as well. Happy it didn’t escalate further
"You made me bleed my own blood! - Isaiah ""Nelson"" Stewart"
Isaiah Stewart at plus odds is free money 🤑
"Do people really think LeBron was trying to commit anything other than a normal frustration foul?  It was dirty, but acting like LeBron was trying to punch Stewart in the face is absolutely ridiculous lmfao  Dude's been in the league for almost 2 decades and has never done anything like that. He's not snapping worse than he'd ever snapped before for Isaiah Stewart on the Detroit Pistons in a regular season game lmfao"
bout to get me an Isaiah Stewart jersey
"Steven Adams is the consensus pick, but Isaiah Stewart grew up boxing before he started playing basketball. That might explain Lebron’s deer-in-headlights look last night."
ngl as a normal sized human I want no part of trying to get in front of an enraged Isaiah Stewart and would not give myself very good odds if i had to try.
"I agree. It isn't some incidental transgression. He got his face split wide open, and ended up getting [eight stiches](https://sports.yahoo.com/detroit-pistons-isaiah-stewart-suspended-110402789.html). It's not like you got elbowed in the chest, and told to quit being a whine ass about it."
Isaiah Stewart probably has as many dirty plays after 2 years of playing
"Given history, the league is going to enforce a sizable suspension on Isaiah Stewart (double digit weeks). He really should be mandated to attend an anger management class."
"You do realise you are in a thread where people are defending Isaiah Stewart for trying to retaliate against Lebron? Like no one has an issue with that here. The only issues are he plowed through like 10 people for a chance to retaliate against Lebron.  You should really get your brain looked at if you can't figure this one out. This sub supports retaliation always. Just like Shaq, Barkley and everyone else who is not a racist like yourself."
"Karl Malone is in the Hall of Fame after raping children, Lebron’s legacy is not affected by Isaiah Stewart you dumb loser"
Did you... see Isaiah Stewart yesterday? I think he was ready to fight lol
"Am I the only one who thinks that Mr. Isaiah Stewart overreacted on this entire play, LeBron James did give him a hard foul, but seriously, this man over reacted."
Isaiah Stewart looking like a 7 yr old child with a bad temperament lol
trade for this guy isaiah stewart
Isaiah Stewart trying to beat me up would be terrifying
"After seeing LeBron very clearly cock his arm/hand back, look right at Stewart's face, and then throw a hammer fist...yeah I totally understand why Isaiah Stewart went off the way he did. I lowkey respect it too. LeBron knew exactly what he did and it was intentional. Clear as day in all the different videos and angles.  As for why Stewart went berserk like this? Dude is from Rochester, NY. There are three cities in New York state where dudes are known to be about that action at all times: Syracuse, Buffalo, and Rochester. It's something about bordering Canada that has folk so aggy up there."

I prefer wwe to that ish but even they couldn't do Isaiah Stewart justice
"LeBron messed up. Isaiah Stewart was competing hard and being physical. LeBron didn't like being pushed off his center of gravity -- sure it should have been a foul in this era (that's not a foul pre-2000's) but either way, no reason to back-hand closed fist bitch slap someone."
"LeBron should receive an elbow in the face from Isaiah Stewart, but then LeBron has five minutes to try and catch Isaiah with Cade Cunningham trying to stop him. If he successfully catches him then no suspension is issued, but if he doesn't then Stewart gets to have another go."
isaiah stewart would be the cause of a turtle fatality
The way Isaiah Stewart sprinted into the tunnel is what keeps Pennywise awake at night.
Pistons and lakers play again in 5 games. I'm guessing he is suspended long enough to not have to see Isaiah Stewart again. and lebron does not really look healthy to me anyway.
"Can't say for sure either way, and whether he went back in would also depend on his importance to his team, the game situation, and the importance of the game.  If Curry splits his brow in Game 7 of the WCF, tied in the third quarter, he's more likely to come back in than 7/7 sophomore Isaiah Stewart on the 4-11 Pistons in mid-November."
isaiah stewart a rookie and he's already getting in the faces of former mvps.
Today will be Isaiah Stewart day.
Of course that is the title.  It should read LeBron punches Isaiah Stewart in the face and then ref completely protects LeBron so LeBron doesn't get his ass beat
"Yeah, Lebron fucked up and should at minimum get fined and possibly suspended. But Isaiah Stewart went above and beyond in escalating. He tried several times to turn this into a real fight. Isaiah Stewart should be suspended multiple games."

They were yelling at each other until Isaiah Stewart saw blood running down his face then he lost it and rightfully so. Some of the adrenaline started pulling

Eh. Isaiah Stewart finna be outta the league quick.
Hot take: I like Isaiah Stewart. If he was on my team. I'd probably like him.
Lol who is isaiah Stewart. Do he have a face on 2k?

"Everyone's calling it an elbow but it looked to me like LeBron smacked Stewart's eyeball with his fingertips. The blood at the end I don't think was from the fight, but was from the initial contact. It wouldn't surprise me if he has a scratched cornea and needs to wear a patch for a couple weeks.  From [NYP](https://nypost.com/2021/11/21/lebron-james-ejected-after-bloodying-pistons-isaiah-stewart):  &gt;	I don’t think James is a dirty player, but Stew cut his eye,” Detroit coach Dwane Casey said. “He felt like he had been cheap-shotted across the brow. I’m not even sure he knew who hit him."
"Lebron was frustrated; I think he 100% meant to hit Isaiah just maybe not where he did or as hard as he did. Stewart doesn't immediately go to 100. It looks like they exchanged words after the hit and he didn't like what was said. *That's* when he saw red, pun kind of intended.  But it was the funniest shit I've seen all week. Started out like world star, ended up like looney tunes. I died laughing."
LeBron beating Isaiah Stewart like a Chinese dissident in a re-education camp.

All I know is that Isaiah Stewart is playing the wrong sport. Dude is built like a tank
"According to the [ref report](https://official.nba.com/pool-report-on-the-ejection-of-lebron-james-and-isaiah-stewart-in-the-third-quarter-of-tonights-los-angeles-lakers-at-detroit-pistons-game/), they thought he might"
"Sources close to the Lakers are saying Lebron overheard Isaiah Stewart telling teammates that the President of China, Xi Jinping, resembled Winnie the Pooh. Subsequently leading to Lebron throwing the punch."
Isaiah Stewart walking away with a concussion. Watching that whole sequence he got delirious.   Not trying to defend Jokic either. His play was totally uncalled for.
How quickly they forget.  &amp;#x200B;  [Isaiah Stewart is strong but he's not doing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we_GNtFgvo8)
Stephen A. Smith: LeBron isn't making it out of the West.  Isaiah Stewart: LeBron isn't making it out of Detroit.
&gt; if he’s lucky  they’re not gonna boot Isaiah Stewart out of the league for trying to fight someone. the only thing that gets you booted from the NBA is drugs or guns.
COJO with the All-Isaiah Stewart Defense!
LMAO Russ was going to [Mind Transfer Jutsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfejv18GxB0) with Isaiah Stewart
"weird way of wording ""Lebron elbowed Isaiah Stewart so hard in the face he started leaking blood like a faucet""."

Lebron angry that Isaiah Stewart said that Taiwan is a country
isaiah stewart never been as famous

Imagine Isaiah Stewart signing with the Shenzhen Aviators next month 💀
nobody makes me bleed my own blood- Isaiah Stewart
"&gt;QUESTION: Why wasn’t Cory Joseph assessed a technical foul?  &gt;FOSTER: After Isaiah Stewart left the court, Cory was anticipating he may come around the back of house and enter the Laker bench from the opposite side. So, he was going to intercept him.  I actually told Cory that would be good.  Damn Foster.. you being so reasonable is sus too"
"""Nobody makes me bleed my own blood!""  --Isaiah Stewart Zoolander"
Isaiah Stewart was right to be mad. That was a really bad cheap shot by Lebron. Fight or flight instincts take over at that point. Lebron really injured Stewart.
"Reshoot Alien, but it's Isaiah Stewart lurking around in the tunnels hunting the Lakers."
Whomever the fuck Isaiah Stewart is has no respect for his elders
This dude the Isaiah Stewart of Reddit comments
"Watched it again several times;   That wasn't just ""tangled"" up.   LeBron put a sharp elbow on him on purpose and it busted his eye open. There's a deep laceration there and if you watch it was already starting to pour blood  out in a steady stream when he approached LeBron.   Lebron was in the wrong but he held his palms up like he was innocent and he was going to get away with doing it intentionally. I think this is why Isaiah got so heated. Not the elbow. The blatant disrespect.   LeBron is a physical player but this particular elbow was not becoming of a pro.   I know people catch elbows and I know he flipped out but I feel for Stewart here."
Isaiah Stewart gonna be at the Lakers hotel fully dressed in the Joe Goldberg Stalker Fit from YOU 😂
I'm guessing this is the last time anyone fucks with Isaiah Stewart
Isaiah Stewart went full Dothraki rage after that
idk but if you want to see Isaiah Stewart almost catch a body i’d go front row
"He added that Lebron, as a man, should approach him directly “He saw me in the hallway tonight and he walked right past me”  -Isaiah Stewart probably"
"LeBron elbowed Isaiah Stewart in his eye, LeBron got tossed, Stewart wanted to kill LeBron."
Now I’m imagining Isaiah Stewart among the media with a fake mustache on like the Tattle Tale Strangler
"Isaiah Stewart hiding among the media: ""Fucking damn it"""
Hopefully Isaiah Stewart got to watch the rest of the game...chained up in the locker room like Samson.
I would fuck him up. I am Isaiah Stewart.

Breaking: Isaiah Stewart has still not cooled down. Sources say he's heading to LA

Should Isaiah Stewart pour cement on LeBron’s corvette tho?
Isaiah Stewart is Kanters new best friend
Everyone saying Isaiah Stewart shouldn’t get suspended clearly did not see that man transform into prime Marshawn Lynch trying to get back at Lebron. He deserves a suspension for shoving the staff like that.

"More accurate title would be ""Lebron elbows Isaiah Stewart at the free throw line... "". Double suspension feels right."
"“Your failures are your own old man, I’m mr meeseeks look at me, I say follow through! Who’s with me?” -Isaiah Stewart probably"
I’d want a military presence if Isaiah Stewart was looking for me

"Now in at running back, from Washington, Isaiah Stewart"
Isaiah Stewart is built different
"I just watched the replay. It's obvious LeBron did not mean to slap him in the face and was trying to aggressively push his arm away. Isaiah even went up to LeBron and they were trying to hash it out. Stewart actually went into a rage when LeBron said ""Westbrook is one of the greatest players of all-time."""

Isaiah Stewart will get himself ejected from the game so he can destroy LeBron in the locker room lol.

[bruh i called this man Rodman and Ben Wallace but I didn't wanna be this accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/qz8bpr/highlight_jerami_grant_goes_supernova_and/hlktj8j/)  and by that I mean I wish they woulda just let him beat Lebrons ass  the chad Isaiah Stewart vs the virgin Kanter
"Killian Hayes, Sadiq Bey, Isaiah Stewart, Pistons have 3 unathletic guys in their starting lineup."
"Grant wanted to go to Detroit though, even if you offered a contract he woulda declined. He wanted to go to a team in a black city with a black head coach &amp; black GM. C. Wood woulda been a great fit for yall, but again idk if he woulda gone there, cause he was traded to the Rockets for the #16 pick (Isaiah Stewart) and I doubt Miami was sending out their first to get him."
Biggest needs are an outside shooter or a legit pick and roll big to pair with Cade. Isaiah Stewart is a good heart and hustle guy but too small and not athletic enough for that role.
"To speak for Detroit, it seems like Hamidou is unhappy and might be on the move. Unless we get a good offer, I think Olynyk stays since we don't have a lot of 5s right now (Isaiah Stewart just got injured). He might be traded in the off-season, but I would bet a fiscally negligible amount of money that Olynyk stays the year.  There has been a lot of Bagley talk in our subreddit, and a bit of Simmons talk as well."
I bet +7.5 Pistons and after Isaiah Stewart went down Poole immediately throw up two straight 3 attempts from the logo and I just thought “yeah he knows Im fucked too”
