"[Here’s an article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/ostler/article/If-Kevin-Durant-leaves-Warriors-could-DeMarcus-13403898.php) that goes into some detail. The pertinent paragraph you’re looking for:  &gt; It’s not that simple. Due to NBA bargaining agreements, the Warriors can only offer Cousins 120 percent of his current salary, which is $5.3 million. If the talented center returns to form this year, he’ll likely get much bigger offers elsewhere.  Given that 100% would be equal to his current salary, it makes sense to say they can only offer 20% more of that number. So they can offer him around $6.3-$6.4 million. Boogie will have a ring and would look good to most teams. I could see him turning down deals if they’re in the 10-12 mil range. I don’t see the same thing if someone offers 20+. "
"There's no way the trade was actually completed in 2 hours, they probably discussed dealing Porzingis in the past and agreed to the deal they saw as the best for their plan. And this deal easily makes sense if they land Kevin Durant + another star. Why NBA Twitter and some people here can't just wait until July 15th before calling the trade stupid is beyond me.   DSJ is just a trade asset. Potentially so is the Knicks 2019 pick. These are the types of assets that can land them Anthony Davis. He's rumored to like the Lakers and Knicks, so it's just another piece that gives them a chance at AD."
"OAKLAND, Calif. — Yes, there was damage done to the relationship between LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.  Also yes, it was repaired by Irving’s call to James last month to apologize.  “Yeah, we’re in a good place right now,” James told The Athletic Saturday night. “Me and Kyrie are in a good place right now. I love the man that he’s becoming, I love the challenges he’s accepted and I always wish the best for him.”  These were James’ first public comments about the call he received to his cell last month from Irving, his former teammate on the Cleveland Cavaliers who buzzed to apologize for the hard time he gave James as a younger player.  In a twist of fate, Kevin Love, the third member of Cleveland’s Big 3, was with James at a Los Angeles pizza place the night Irving called.  James said of that call: “We talked and it was a great conversation,” but wouldn’t divulge what he said to Irving. “He told y’all what he said,” James said.  More to the point, Thursday is the NBA’s trade deadline. At first glimpse, it looked like James and Irving’s teams were fighting each other over the Pelicans’ Anthony Davis, who wants to be traded.  But on Friday Irving took a gas can and a match to the entire NBA when he backed way away from a previous, public commitment to sign a new long-term contract with the Celtics this summer.  Speaking to reporters in New York, where Irving, should he decline Boston’s five-year, $189 million offer in free agency, could wind up, maybe with Warriors star Kevin Durant, Irving said “ask me July 1” when asked about his past commitment to the Celtics.  Guess what? James approved of Irving’s comments Friday.  “He handled it great,” James said. “His post interview was great as well. Just a lot of things that’s going on in our league right now, and the one thing you want to focus on is getting that team to place where he wanted it to be, and that’s competing for a championship.”  After Irving said Friday morning — again, at Madison Square Garden — that “I spent the last eight years trying to do what everybody else wanted me to do in terms of making my decisions and trying to validate through the media, through other personnel, managers, anybody in this business … and I don’t owe anybody shit,” he was serenaded throughout the game that night by Knicks fans. He was also aware of the media buzz over his earlier remarks.  On Jan. 16, Irving said he called James to, in his words, apologize “for “being that young player that wanted everything at his fingertips, and I wanted everything at my threshold.” Irving, a proclaimed leader on the Celtics now, said he was dealing with the same things from Boston’s younger players that James saw from Irving and other youngsters in Cleveland. Sources said the pains Irving’s experienced with some teammates is a reason he’s considering leaving the Celtics.  James and Irving won a championship together, beating the Warriors in 2016 in seven games, but the following summer Irving demanded a trade out of Cleveland, for among other reasons reportedly no longer wanting to play on James’ team. In November, James told The Athletic that trading Irving to the Celtics was “the beginning of the end” of Cleveland’s Eastern dynasty.  The Celtics were picked by many to win the East (now that James is gone from the Cavs) and are currently tied for fourth in the conference with Indiana.  As for James and the Lakers, Irving and the Celtics, and the Davis sweepstakes in New Orleans, the Lakers are trying to put a package together now for the star center. The Celtics cannot trade for Davis this season because they have Irving, and both are on designated rookie extensions — which are limited to one per team.  Boston is believed to be able to put together the best package to acquire Davis, but it would have to wait until this summer. Davis, who is represented by James’ agent, Rich Paul, wants to be traded to the Lakers and not to the Celtics, in part because he is not confident Irving will stay beyond this season."

"I agree. It's not only Jackson who has compared Ingram to KD. Basically everybody has done that in the last 3 years. Obviously it's hard to replicate Kevin Durant, one of the best scorers the league has seen. The comparison still makes sense, even if Ingram never becomes KD."

KD for AD. Kevin Durant is not untouchable. We want AD. We want all the rebounding.
Where the *Anthony Davis is just smokescreen and I sign Kevin Durant* option?  &amp;#x200B;
if kevin durant stays with the warriors the nba will literally dissolve in the next two years and new leagues will form with the top talent split between them. it would be really sad to see
"if the Knicks win the lottery I could see it. he's good friends with DeAnde Jordan as well.  - Dennis Smith, Emmanuel Mudiay - Wesley Matthews - Kevin Durant, Kevin Knox - Zion Williamson - DeAndre Jordan, Mitchell Robinson  is making it to the ECF for sure."
"I also think it would be dope to play with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving on Knicks."
Kevin Durant and Al Horford are from the same draft class.
He's older than Kevin Durant lol
Id take Kevin Durant knowing that he did what he did last playoffs was almost of detriment in this years. 
"Quality of regular season games seems to be down. The last CBA inadvertently encouraged the formation of the warriors and that and the super max have led to the formation of other super teams. LeBron’s move to the west has also left the east without a signature star.   The nba needs to do a better job hyping regular season matchups and change rules to improve competitive balance. They also need to David Stern the Warriors. Kevin Durant needs to go elsewhere.   All in all, I think the NBA will be fine. It’s just the first time in a while that the league has been in danger of trending downward. "
"The article:  Get out those tea leaf readers, NBA fans: The free agency frenzy came early this season — sort of.  While some of the league’s biggest stars still can’t decide their hoops fates until July 1, the blockbuster trade that sent Kristaps Porzingis from the New York Knicks to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday came with all sorts of potential ramifications and one central question.  Can the Knicks turn this KP deal into a free agency KO by bringing Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to town?  It has never looked more possible.  All around the league, executives who are paid handsomely to track this sort of thing had the same takeaway: The Knicks, who have been widely known to be targeting Durant for so long now and whose general manager (Scott Perry) was part of the Seattle SuperSonics front office team that drafted him out of Texas in 2007, must be very confident that they’re going to get the Golden State star. Some rival executives even reported that Knicks officials themselves have been expressing a very high level of optimism on this front.  The Oklahoma City Thunder are on Line One, by the way, wanting to discuss the dangers of Durant and premature free agency speculation. But I digress.  Trading Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke to Dallas gives the Knicks the salary cap runway for the two max salary slots they would need, all while coming at the cost of a franchise centerpiece player in Porzingis who is the only one who might have yielded a superstar like, say, the disgruntled Anthony Davis via trade this season. Translation: This is the kind of gamble that leaves everyone saying, “What do they know that we don’t?” And, no, the two first-round picks coming New York’s way weren’t enough to quell the noise about what this move truly meant.  This KD-to-NYC storyline has been front and center for quite some time now, with Durant’s business manager, New York native and lifelong Knicks fan Rich Kleiman, pouring kerosene on this free agency fire last February when he tweeted, “Imma run the Knicks one day.” Durant’s early-season rift with the Warriors’ Draymond Green took it to yet another level, with video of that infamous Clippers game on Nov. 12 appearing to show Durant saying, “That’s why I’m out.”  Add in the growing concern from rival teams that the Knicks will offer Kleiman a job as part of their plan, and the fact that Durant and Perry are known to still have a good relationship, and you start to understand why New York had everyone’s attention even before this monumental move. But if this truly is in the works, if Durant is planning to bounce from the Bay and take on that yeoman’s challenge of bringing glory back to the Garden, it’s just the sort of thing that will keep the Boston Celtics brass up at night from now until this summer.  Let me explain.  For all the talk of Irving’s recent apology to LeBron James and the idea that Irving might renege on his October promise to re-sign in order to reunite with his former Cleveland Cavaliers co-star with the Lakers, a source with knowledge of the Celtics’ thinking said there is little to no concern about that prospect within their green walls. A source close to James said he would be open to the possibility of playing with Irving again, and even highlighted his well-chronicled history of reconciliation with Cavs owner Dan Gilbert as empirical evidence that he doesn’t hold grudges.  Nonetheless, the Lakers are not seen by Boston as a serious threat to steal Irving away.  What’s more, Davis might be the one filling that co-star role soon in Laker Land if Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka can strike a deal with Pelicans general manager Dell Demps before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. That is, of course, if the Celtics can’t convince New Orleans to wait until this summer to send Davis their way (as we discussed here, Boston can’t trade for Davis until Irving is a free agent because of the league’s Rose rule).  As I reported on Tuesday, a source close to Irving said there’s no reason to believe he has changed his view from that fateful fan event where he said he was there to stay. But in light of all these developments, and with Irving’s well-chronicled locker room dynamic with his Celtics teammates leaving so many to wonder if his view might have changed, maybe it’s time for him to speak up again.  And talk about timing: The Celtics just so happen to play in New York on Friday. Irving, the 26-year-old whose transparency in October set a tricky precedent, is expected to address the media for the first time since suffering a hip strain against Golden State on Saturday.  Yet even before the Porzingis deal cleared the way for the two max slots in New York, and with all these superstar puzzle pieces jumbled together in the kind of way that makes the overall picture so tricky to see, there was a belief in Celtics circles that the prospect of the Knicks getting Davis or Durant could spell trouble for Boston’s chances of holding onto Irving. Davis is unofficially off their blue and orange table now, but the prospect of landing Durant appears very much in play. And then maybe — just maybe — Irving too.  Never has such an awful team looked so dangerous."
Kevin Durant would be my pick
"uh this isn’t a rewrite, this is wel noted https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/09/20/whos-more-valuable-stephen-curry-or-kevin-durant/"
Are you arguing for the team or individual because it seems like you’re trying to play both sides.  Let’s take the warriors out of the equation.  Let’s say you’re the New York Knicks and at this current moment in time you have the chance to get either Steph Curry or Kevin Durant.  Would you really pick Curry over KD?!
Damn Rudy sonned that snake Draymond. Warriors should trade dude while they can. Not as nice of a mid range as KD  \-not Kevin Durant
Draymond Green was available for Game 6 &amp; Game 7 and they still lost against Cavs in NBA finals 2016.  Kevin Durant has been their best player during post-season and bailed them out when Klay/Curry had off games.  
Again Curry is amazing and taking nothing away from the greatest shooter of all time but Kevin Durant absolutely deserves those 2 MVPs w/o KD it’s probably a 7 game series going either way.  KD was clutch and he was the man who won it for them.  
"&gt;Yeah Durant's rings mean less   Eh, Kevin Durant won back-to-back FMVPS and has been GSW's best player in the post-season.  He has 100% earned his rings, it's not like KD was just playing garbage minutes while his teammates did the heavy lifting."
He’s the focal point of a team with Kevin Durant on it. 
"It is very difficult to key in on a player off ball and doing so would result in open opportunities for the rest of the team. Curry already receives that type of treatment. You saw Kevin Durant get 1on1 opportunities (and often 1on0) because the Cavs were more concerned about Curry. You'll almost never see it the opposite way around where a defense is more concerned about his teammate and it leads to an open look for himself.  He *creates* those easy shots for himself by constantly moving and giving the ball up immediately when he doesn't have an advantage (EXTREMELY rare for stars to do). You make it seem as though it's just the system, of which does not function without Curry - we've seen this in the games the Warriors have played without him, they look like a completely different team - and supporting cast when we've seen Curry perform better with less talent around him than he has now. "
"If a player rides on another player's shoulders and they pass the ball back and forth between them would that be a foul? Like if draymond were to carry kevin durrant on his shoulders, and they pass the ball up and down (draymond to durant and back to draymond and green again and they cycle continues), while draymond walks towards the rim and kevin score. Would that be a foul?"
"Tbf those ""2 reliable shooters"" are Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant. They command a lot more attention from the defense than any non-Harden player on the Rockets and have a gravitational pull of their own. That makes getting open off-ball a lot easier for Steph, since defenders will play his teammates harder.  I sort of agree with your main thesis in this thread but it's an unfair comparison."
"Kevin Durant:  &gt;""Kobe [Bryant], MJ [Michael Jordan] and Kyrie [Irving].  ""Just the way they move, I don't understand why people don't realize what they're seeing in these three, especially Jordan and Kobe. Kyrie is younger than me, and that's one of my best friends, so I watch his stuff.  KD is definitely more friendly with Kyrie than he is with Boogie, a person he almost fist fought during a game last season "
I mean... www.cbssports.com/nba/news/its-official-warriors-loss-in-nba-finals-gained-them-kevin-durant/amp/
True he has plenty of more years to lose to Kevin durant
Sigh... here we go  Dwyane Wade is top 20  Kevin Durant is higher than Steph already. Steph is not breaking into the top 10. He’s 15-20.  Kawhi is more than top 60 lol. This is laughable.  JAMES HARDEN IS NOT TOP 20!!!!!!!!
"&gt;yet people suck off KD more now  Yeah I’m sure this sub LOVES Kevin Durant...  Besides, I’m sure Steph’s legacy is fine. The 3-peat will make it all worth it. Being the most important player on the greatest team of all time is nothing to scoff at. "
"&gt; Ingram also has some experience running an offense and creating shots for his teammates, something Siakam has never even tried to do.  This is pretty false. Siakam starts a lot of our plays and the drive and kick is a huge part of his game this season.  &gt; Ingram dropped 32 points on Kevin Durant last year  Siakam has done similar things as well. He dropped 28 on Giannis last night, and 30 earlier in the season, and 26 against Golden State to name a few just off the top of my head.  &gt; If the Pels are trading for Siakam to be the primary offensive weapon for their team then they're doing it on pure speculation alone  I doubt front offices think like this. They look at potential when trading for young players and year-by-year improvement, which Siakam has had more of than anyone on the Lakers by a long shot. He's almost doubled his PPG this season while increasing his efficiency and rebounding.   &gt; Ingram and Kuzma both have far more experience doing that  They have more experience because they've had to do it, but they haven't exactly been great while doing it. Ingram hasn't improved this season and Kuzma is very inefficient and statistically a worse shooter than Siakam.   If your logic holds, then any promising young players on a good roster can never be primary offensive weapons for teams because they've  never had to do it. Players adapt, and Siakam literally has all the tools he needs to be a 1st/2nd option."
"The reason I know is because we haven't seen them in that position yet. If the Pels are trading for Siakam to be the primary offensive weapon for their team then they're doing it on pure speculation alone, rather than because they have evidence that he can do it. Ingram and Kuzma both have far more experience doing that, experience you can point to, rather than just speculating about. Ingram dropped 32 points on Kevin Durant last year (when he was only 20) and 36 points the other night on Ben Simmons, and both instances came with no other #1 option to create his shots for him. Ingram also has some experience running an offense and creating shots for his teammates, something Siakam has never even tried to do."
Demarcus Cousins: Knicks  Klay Thompson: Warriors  Kevin Durant: Warriors  Kemba Walker: Knicks  Kyrie Irving: Celtics  Kawhi Leonard: Raptors  Jimmy Butler: Philly  Anthony Davis: LAL
...No they don't?  Kevin Durant is a FA. Klay is a FA. They're not trading Curry. Cousins is a FA and has bad blood with NO.  Draymond is not worth it at all.
"Hmm, so we were perennial losers until the Lacob &amp; Guber ownership took over. That turnaround couldn't have been due to management doing their due diligence, but really was luck... I guess they found a garden of four-leaf clovers somewhere and never looked back.        6 teams passed on Curry, 10 teams passed on Klay, and 34 teams passed on Draymond (including us), so making the right choice and building the right way is attributed to luck? We could have easily passed on them as well. Where do you draw the line between a matter of chance and actually competent people running a franchise. I could be wrong, but the cap spike benefited all 30 teams and not just us. Why did Kevin Durant choose to sign here? Could it be that we created an organizational culture that aligned with his goals? Nah, it was because of luck that the other teams didn't build their organization to be attractive to free agents, right? We built it all without a top-4 pick which some other teams were able to acquire through *luck* and then squandered the opportunity. Your definition of luck in this case is like saying every time Stephen Curry makes a 3-point shot, it's because of luck. "
Durant seems the most likely. There's a ton of smoke there.  There's this bit from that Amick article that Knicks are going to offer Durant's agent Rich Kleiman a job in the organization: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyS04KwX4AAX4ZM.jpg:large  Then there's this tweet from Kleiman himself that he's going to run the Knicks one day: https://twitter.com/richkleiman/status/966364501292584960  Durant's best friend in the NBA Royal Ivey is a Knicks assistant coach.  Scott Perry is part of the group that drafted Durant in Seattle and they're still close.  Allonzo Trier is Durant's protege and they've been close for more than a decade now.  Kevin Knox idolizes Durant and has a great relationship with Durant's brother and mother.  Durant has made it known in the past that NYC is one of his favorite cities and he's had some fond memories such as his game at Rucker's.  I'm fully prepared to end up not getting him though.
If they get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in the offseason and have Kevin Knox I think we need to investigate the Knicks ties to the KKK.
Westbrook  Kevin knox  Stanley johnson  Durant  Drummond
The Warriors went 5-6 over the 11 games Curry missed to the groin injury. You wanna know what was their record when Durant missed the month plus change in the 2016-2017 season with a knee injury? 16-4. They're literally a .500 team without Curry but the Warriors continue to steamroll over the NBA without Kevin Durant. So who is the more important Warrior.  And LOL 1 tech a game Draymond Green.

Yeah I’m sure Kevin Durant and Klay and Draymond have nothing to do with it
So how do you feel about your boy Kevin Durant? Or was him crying about his mother in his MVP press conference before you became an NBA fan?
" Rudy Gobert is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year and leads the  NBA in win shares (8.9) and FG% while averaging 15 points and 12.8  rebounds. The Jazz have the best record in the league among teams with  no All-Stars.    The Jazz’s defensive rating (points per 100 possessions) is 101.8 with  Rudy Gobert on the floor, 7.7 points under the league average. The only  players in the NBA with an offensive rating that high above the league  average are Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.    There have  been 12 times in the history of the league where a player averaged &gt;14 pts, &gt;12 rebs, &gt;2 blks, and &gt;60 TS%. 10 of those were all stars and the other 2 are Gobert.   Since 1996, only MJ, Mailman, Shaq, Duncan, KG, Dirk, LeBron, CP3, KD,  Steph and Harden have led the league in Win Shares for a season, and all were All Stars.   Gobert leads the league this year .

Ya we suck now. We are clearly rebuilding and going thru “the process” which you should have intimate knowledge of. I’m happy that prior to this we went to the Finals 4 times in a row and won 1 title that prob would have been more if Kevin Durant didn’t join the Warriors.   I hope your team sniffs that sort of success as we all know winning is hard in the NBA. 
“I want to stay in OKC forever.” -Kevin Durant  KD to the Knicks confirmed
Kevin Durant is finally gone show us he can shine bright.

Why would sources to the lakers know anything about Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving going to the Knicks? Can someone please explain this?
"1) Covington guarded guys like Kyrie and Kemba Walker in the past over Ben Simmons, Covington doesn't have great foot speed but Ben Simmons and Jimmy Butler aren't really made at their size to move laterally with the best guards either. They do their best but none are ideal options for more than portions of games Philly just has to go with what they can.   2) With guarding Steph Curry it's different than with other guards in the reg season they aren't going to do a ton of ISO hunting. What you really have to worry about with him is off the ball with all their split cut actions, converging actions, misdirection, slip screens etc. You need guys who can recognize these actions, fight through screens,call them out, be fast enough to chase him around etc. That's where he kills teams in the reg season. This is where it requires all 5 guys(especially bigs to be able to get on te perimeter and switch when needed) which you were alluding to. When they do run pick and rolls teams like the Spurs and Rockets in the past have blatantly just given him the lane to drive and just stayed on his hip and prevented the 3 pt shot so moving laterally again isn't as crucial as it is with other guards.   3) The Warriors last night ran more KD/Steph pick and rolls than they usually do in the reg season. That was also part of why it became crucial down the stretch to not have Redick on Steph between the two guys you have guarding that play both have to be able to switch onto KD because switching the Steph/KD pick and roll is almost mandatory.   4) Wes Matthews at this stage Im not sure would be the best option. Even a few years ago he was at his best vs wings and bigger guards. He's done well in the past against guys like Kawhi Leonard, Giannis, Kevin Durant. The 2016 playoffs vs KD with Dallas would be an ex of the type of matchup he can do well with. But he's not really someone you put on 1's unless it's a guy like a Westbrook type  Realistically I was talking about this with someone the other day its hard to find too many realistic targets on the market that can guard 1's and also be viable starters. The best realistic option might be Garrett Temple. Few wks ago when Memp played Boston down the stretch the Celtics kept running plays to get Temple switched off Kyrie and put Conley on him instead which was interesting. I wouldn't give up a 1st for just Temple though. Maybe if it were JaMychal Green and Temple but still meh  "

"Is there some kind of bias against rookies and the allstar game?  Only 2 made in the last 20 years: Yao and Blake. Some names who didn't: Vince Carter, Amar'e Stoudamire, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving. And those are just the ROTY winners. "
"Players have more control and are incentivized to team up, players would have done this years ago of they could have.   I disagree that it's impossible for Portland or Milwalkee to contend this year. NBA playoffs more often than not award the most talented teams, however several times it has revealed the importance of chemistry. Klay Thompson is not as valuable a centerpiece as Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook but on the floor next to Steph Curry and the other GSW pieces they were the better team. (I can hear the argument that OKC that year was better despite losing but my point still is talent can have a diminished utility and how players compliment each other is important )"
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis is right below him, Klay Thompson. I can go on. The only thing that separates them are shot attempts and free throws. Harden is getting 12 FTs a game, a lot of it from BS calls. I've watched at least 40% of his games this season and I've seen the calls, some are fouls but there are definitely more than a few terrible calls. His double step back traveling 3 he shoots. Other superstars are noticing this crap and calling the refs out in game. Coaches are getting techs left and right arguing this crap. You want to bring up his 36ppg, then dont forget the foul calls and his ultra green light."
Give me a realistic scenario this offseason that will make it better for Kyrie's career to leave Boston.     Boston's the better basketball situation even if NY gets Kevin Durant. Especially if Kyrie wants to be the best player on his team.
Because Kyrie Andrew Irving and Kevin Wayne Durant are taking their talents to the Garden
"Okay it's good to see a nuanced take for once, but no.  For starters, just because you had to get rid of horrible contracts that you dished out doesn't mean that getting rid of them is a good trade.   The Raptors had to pay Brooklyn two picks to take Demarre Carroll or risk being capped out which is an awful hit to the team and objectively a bad sequence of events.  Secondly, even if the plan is to sign Durant and Irving, why the hell would you get rid of Porzingins? Ina league where Lebron is about to get AD, The Celtics and Raptors are loaded with talent, the Warriors are the justice league, giving up a young all star with as much potential as KP while you have his bird rights is lunacy.   Thirdly, If you have to shed salary, do it in the offseason once you have confirmation of a deal. Why are we acting like this hasn't happened before? If Durant agrees to sign, THEN do whatever the fuck you gotta do to free up the salary space. Send out all the firsts if that's what it takes, you just signed KD!!!  Finally, this is just piss poor asset management. If they were so high on Dennis Smith Jr. they should have drafted him instead of take another dude WHO PLAYS THE SAME POSITION. That 2022 unprotected is a good asset no doubt, but it's not a surefire money ball. This isn't Billy King and the corpses of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This is Mark Cuban and two future superstars on rookie deals. Oh and that dead money you were talking about? They will be useful expiring contracts and completely off the books by the time that 2022 pick conveys.  Sure, you can always wait and see how a trade shakes out to see the winners and losers, but this is objectively a horrible trade by the Knicks. The chances of the best case scenario playing out for them are slim to absolutely zero."

"&gt;The Knicks now have a chance to build an honest-to-god title contender this summer. That matters. Keeping Porzingis and playing things ""smart"" would have been a great way to impress NBA Twitter and then win 43 games next year. Purely from a process standpoint, this was the better play.  &gt;The Knicks began Thursday without enough cap space to sign Kevin Durant, and by Thursday afternoon they had $74.6 million to spend this summer—enough space to sign both Durant and an additional superstar on a max contract. They also have Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina, Dennis Smith, Jr., and seven first–round picks over the next five years—those are trade assets for a third star.  &gt;This team always needed Durant to win anything meaningful in the next few seasons. The only thing that changed Thursday was that the KD scenario became more plausible. The Knicks now have the space to recruit a superstar to help Durant, and they have the assets to trade for another star. They kept this year's first–round pick, too; if New Orleans holds onto Anthony Davis through the trade deadline and New York lands at No. 1 in May's lottery, Anthony Davis could be in New York before Durant or any other stars arrive in July. "
Especially when hes actually a very good playmaker nowadays and defences still have to guard him like hes Kevin Durant
"Did they tear an Achilles and have history of injury’s? Also by the time Kevin Durant got injured he’d already won an MVP and was a proven commodity. KP has done nothing, hasn’t even played in a playoff game and wanted to be trade"
Kevin Durant once played 27 games in a season. Is he not a franchise player? Jordan played 7 games his second season. Should the Bulls have traded him for cap space?? Are you a recess teacher or something?? Fuck outta here b
"&gt; Tank the season out in hopes of getting the 1st pick   14% but ok   &gt; Trade that pick alongside Dallas '21 unprotected 1st rounder and DSJ for Anthony Davis   Not sure how the fuck salaries work here or if either side would do this but ok.      &gt; Chase Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving (rumors about him not re-signing getting stronger, plus NY was a preferred destination for him before the trade to the Celtics) in FA.   KD hasn't been linked to NY very much, and they wouldn't be very enticing after trading their franchise player. Kyrie Irving also aren't getting stronger, there was a report that Kyrie has given no indication he won't re-sign. "
"After Knicks sending KP to Mavs, I believe Kyrie will leave for Knicks. Kevin Durant as well. They might even add a 3rd max contract. That's huge!!"
"That's a yikes from me dawg.  The Warriors broke the regular season record and lost the finals before signing Kevin Durant, a top five player in the league. And guess what they learned? They learned regular season record means shit if you're too burnt out come playoff time. So now they play on cruise control, easily securing first or (at absolute worst) second seed, while giving their superstars minimal minutes.   I love the Bucks. I'm also not a delusional homer. Last season we lost in the first round of the playoffs. Yeah we've improved a lot, but it would take a miracle for us to beat the GSW in a 7 game series."
"This is a sincere response:  I don't understand what restricting the number of players an agent or agency can represent has to do with that.  Giannis could fire his agent today and demand a trade tomorrow. Kevin Durant could sign with the Knicks this summer with any number of agents representing him.  I don't think this really affects the abilities of players to determine their own fate, it just restricts the ability of agents to leverage the scope of their representation in circumstances that concern one player"
sometimes he takes bad shots. but you live with it because it's kevin durant.
Damn imagine saying Fuck You to Kevin Durant
"If anyone can find Kevin Durant that’d be great, he seemed to be missing"
"I love that Kevin ""won't shoot end of quarter heaves to protect my %"" Durant misses a complete gimme bucket at the very end."
"Fuck Kevin Durant. Lost it for them in the fourth with his fucking awful shot selection.  Just fuck you, Durant."
"Nice response in the face of actual evidence. I forgot that most /r/nba users haven't followed the league for more than a couple of years.  GS tanked and drafted Barnes. And Barnes did play a key role for GS as they emerged as a WC power. The Warriors were also able to draft Draymond (BPA) instead of a SF with their 2nd round pick, seeing as they would have lost their first rounder (top 7 protected and picked 7th) if they hadn't tanked.   Finally, they were able to use the money carved out in the cap for Barnes to sign Kevin Durant. That money isn't necessarily there if they don't tank and have a first rounder in 2012. But, hey, keep pushing whatever narrative helps you, I guess."
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY NUMBERS  - Kevin Durant 2019
"This would be fucking hilarious. If the Knicks don't land 2 stars this offseason this might go down as one of the dumbest trades ever. DSJ is legit, but KP has the ability to be the next Kevin Durant."
It really doesn’t matter. Anybody on the face of the planet could’ve made this tweet and it’s relevance would be the same. It’s nothing but speculation based on Kevin Durant going to New York for whatever arbitrary reason the media decides to push

You're missing Kevin Durant. He's got rings but I dont think he won them. 
Kevin Durant turned around the struggling warriors and almost immediately made them a contender
"Nah dude lol, you can’t be in this line of work of critiquing athletes and then get mad when they say that your opinion means nothing. That’s just part of the game.  And yeah, look up when Stephen A broke news of LeBron wanting to “beat Kyrie’s ass” in 2017 and LeBron had to publicly come out and address it indirectly and SAS was arguing against Bron in every debate on First Take after that. He did the same when Kevin Durant called him out for something similar too lol.  Compare that to his relationship with Kobe and how Kobe always invites him to shit and inflated his ego. He stops being objective depending how athletes treat him personally."

"When I woke up on the day of the Western Conference Finals, I was more excited than a 6 year old on Christmas. Playoffs was going great, and my favorite team had the number one seed in the west! I was absolutely hot and bothered by at the thought of winning the championship. But with all the great teams that were playing only one team had my attention: Golden State. I mean, who wouldn't want to defeat the best team in recent years. For months I had been watching highlight videos on YouTube and reading articles. I was fully committed to the Rockets. I prayed every night that the Warriors would fall to the Rockets and that we would be the next face of the NBA. I was, in fact, in love with the Rockets. When it was time for the Conference Finals I was extremely nervous. I locked myself in my room and sat on the bed hiding everything but my eyes under a blanket. I was almost certain that the Warriors are not going to be defeated, but I heard rumors that Kevin Durant is ruining the Warriors with his iso ball. It was actually going to happen. The Warriors was going to lose to the Rockets! When we were about to go up 3-2, I was on the verge of tears. The strongest team in years was going to lose to my team. But as the Rockets were closing out the game my dreams turned into a nightmare. Chris fucking Paul came on to the floor and did something that to this day haunt me: he grabbed his hamstring and limped off the floor. I instantly fell into a deep state of depression. I cried for the first time since my cat Broccoli died. I was completely lost. Fast forward to the Finals and the Warriors is looking like they are blowing out the Cavs every game while the Rockets is recruiting Carmelo Anthony. Now don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the Rockets playoff run and hope we continue to succeed, but it could have been so much better. Everytime I see the picture of the Warriors holding the trophy, a tear comes to my eye. I have a picture of teary-eyed Chris Paul saying ""H-Town, we're coming home"" after Game 4 on my bedside table that I kiss every night. Anyway I won't rant any longer I'm sorry for wasting your time. Christmas is ruined. "
"That was a different Warriors team with a different composition. Now you have Kevin Durant, who's unguardable, and Cousins may pose a big problem."
"Kevin Durant, just to get a taste of the future"
Kevin Durant....because its Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant
No. They have Kevin Durant who people here call THE GREATEST SCORER EVER. So they should be fine.
Lol and they don't have kevin durant anymore. I expect DeMar to choke in the playoffs but don't act like those thunder teams are the same.
[Yes](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/LeBron+James+Kevin+Durant+2012+NBA+Finals+QTZaEDCQWill.jpg
Kevin Durant might be the greatest offensive player of all time. He has no weakness.   Uhm.. No. This is going overboard.
"&gt;Kevin Durant might be the greatest offensive player of all time.  He might be the greatest scorer of all time.  His passing is fine, but there are enough great scorers that are also way better passers (LBJ, Harden, and Bird are just a few examples) that I don't KD is really in the conversation for greatest offensive player."
"You're focusing more on him saying""when did we get to the point where all people care about is money"" and not the message overall  All he's saying is that if you're an aspiring NBA player then you should want to play because you love the game. Not because of the payday. the payday is the bonus. So telling Zion to sit out to secure his money next year is kinda crazy. You're telling him he needs to focus more on that payday than doing what he enjoys doing. You're also telling him to really say fuck education and his college years to guarantee he goes into the NBA to get that money because if he planned on playing more years at the college level then he definitely wouldn't sit out  So he's really talking about the one and done thing and how kids are rushing to make it into the NBA for the check. How kids are just dismissing college development, learning in college, adn the college life just for the millions. That's why he's like ""when did we get to this point?"" Of course everyone wants to make millions but people are so set on making that much money that they can't even enjoy themselves  You also only picked the part of the Kyrie quote that fit your agenda too. He's basically saying that he doesn't see how Kyrie is miserable when he literally has everything a superstar player should have. He's got the money, he's got the ring, and he even got a damn movie. This dude Kyrie, at age 26, was gifted more than even damn Kevin Durant. So Chuck is finding it hard to believe that a guy with his career so far, and with *many* years to go, is *truly* miserable. He may be upset for now but he's not miserable"
Kevin “The Mid-Ranger” Durant
With Kevin Durant
"You missed: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins"
"Imagine you and your friends got beat up by another group of kids but then you went back to the park the next day and one of your buddies is now with the bullies beating you up, thats Kevin Durant. The biggest snake in professional sports history, he is the reason nobodies watching games anymore."
KD has many investment in the silicon valley area that would last way over his career in the NBA. If he did take a pay cut to stay with the Warriors he'll make it up with his other ventures that gonna pay him way past his NBA career. Kevin Durant is a house hold name. 
"It's not hard to turn that around if you get two All NBA players though, especially when one of them is Kevin Durant. They wouldn't turn the Knicks into a league favorite overnight but they'd jump over a ton of teams building conventionally. That NBA star power"
"Overheard in Lakers locker room after losing toe Denver:   “The west got me,” LeBron said of Tatum's dunk over him. ""That f***ing western conference boomed me.""   LeBron added, “There are so many stacked teams,” repeating it four times.   LeBron then said he wanted to add Kevin Durant to the list of players he begs to join the Lakers this summer."
"If the argument is Jordan &gt; LeBron &gt; Kobe, what does LeBron do better than Kobe but not better than Jordan?  Nothing.  It is common basketball hoopla for people to jump LeBron over Kobe, and it's really not fair.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron is 3/9 in the Finals, with multiple Finals in which he choked/underperformed/did not play optimally and did not play defense. He has had more help through his career than Kobe has. In multiple Finals, he has been sagged off of and as a result struggled to make open jumpers, resulting in less aggression or less efficiency (see 2007 Finals, 2011 Finals, 2013 Finals, 2015 Finals) and hasn't played defense since the 2014 Finals even on the biggest stage.  Kobe dominated a tougher Western Conference holding the most wins against 50 + win teams than anyone else and is the only player with 3 straight postseasons scoring 600 points in each.   Give Kobe a single all Star in Pau Gasol, he will deliver you to 3 straight Finals and 2 titles. Give LeBron 2 All Stars (one being a superstar), and he can't even get the most out of both of them, and he's still not a guarantee to win the Finals.  In LeBron's 8 straight Finals, the toughest opponents he's ever had to face in the East were the aging Celtics and MVP Rose who was the lone star on his team. All the teams that have beaten LeBron, Kobe had beaten (Spurs, Magic, Celtics), and in the West (latter run) beat the likes of Carmelo + AI/Billups, Deron Williams + Boozer, Duncan + Parker + Ginobli, Nash + Stoudamire, and a young but deadly trio of Durant + Westbrook + Harden.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron plays, in what we know as, the LeBron system, where it is a literal iso/pick and roll system where LeBron dominates the ball and is surrounded by shooters to spread the floor for him. This kind of offensive attack is iso-heavy and easy to defend by elite teams, so when it comes to him facing off against elite teams in the Finals, it makes sense why he would struggle. Furthermore, only very few times in LeBron's career has a team led by him placed in the top 10 in assists. In this regard, he stands out compared to other championship teams who have an emphasis on ball movement and consistently elevating the play of role players.   LeBron's lack of ability to be an elite off-ball player feeds into the LeBron system as it is the best way to get the best use out of him. Both of these enable defensive gameplans to properly suppress him or his team, and this is seen in his Finals record.  Kobe does not have these flaws, he could play in any system, and would not relegate the likes of Kevin Love or Chris Bosh to be floor spreaders for him, but instead, would know how to get the most out of them and have them play at their best.  &amp;#x200B;  What about MVPs? The MVP is a HORRIBLE metric to gauge players. One, it is a narrative, subjective, award that is given out inconsistently.  Additionally, when we say ""Oh LeBron wins the MVP"", we subconciously throw out the body of work that every other great player achieved in that same year. LeBron wins the MVP in 2009, we ignore Kobe's 67-15 season. Steve Nash wins the MVP in 2006, we ignore Kobe being the first player since MJ to average 35 PPG in a season. If anything, it is much more accurate to look at the accumulation of MVP votes/points throughout their respective seasons and you will find that Kobe Bryant is neck-and-neck virtually tied with LeBron James. So instead of LeBron has 4 MVPs to Kobe's 1, its more of something along the lines of LeBron has 240 MVP points while Kobe has 200.  &amp;#x200B;  Oh but Kobbe played with Shaq, and he wasn't the best player on his team. But we don't penalize Kareem or Magic for playing with each other? Or what about Duncan? There were times in which Parker or Ginobli were the MVPs of their Finals. Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars? This talking point is clear bias and is only applied to Kobe, not to anyone else. And for further context, Shaq dominated the Finals because the East had inferior competition at the big man spots. It was the gameplan in which Kobe sacrificed his touches to feed Shaq. But in the West against better teams with better big men, Kobe outscored Shaq in those series matchups and was every bit as dominant. But again we only like to look at the Finals MVP, which ends up disregarding the body of work done in the previous 3 rounds which are every bit as important.  Oh but LeBron beat a 73-9 team, well guess what? Kobe + Shaq was the equivalent of a 73-9 team in the 2001 Playoffs with a record of 15-1, and Jordan WAS the 73-9 (72 - 10) team.  &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR Kobe is a more talented player on offense and defense, has achieved more with less, beaten teams LeBron could not beat, dominated a much tougher conference (7 Finals in 11 years), and is able to fit under any system and can be coached. There is no defensive gameplan that can actually keep Kobe down, but such a plan does exist for LeBron. Kobe's only ""flaw"" in his game is his shot selection and aggression while LeBron's flaws consist of being an inconsistent outside shooter, making him a poor off-ball player, which leads to him needing to dominate the ball in order to compete. The MVP talking point or ""he played with Shaq"" are talking point are based in biases that do not give proper context to reality. "
I think he confused Kevin Durant with Kyrie Irving. Durant is the one who sounds like a petulant child in every interview he gives. 
"It is *relatively* easy compared to the history of the NBA? Does that make you feel better? Dear Lord, we fucking get it, they still work hard. Are you that harped up on semantics and so far up your own stacked teams ass that you can’t submit that you’re team is the most talented and stacked non-all star or non-Olympic team in basketball history?  Christ you Warriors fans are fucking insufferable. Take your titles and enjoy them. We’re not gonna fucking pat you on the back and treat you like the Patriots and act like you guys just fight through all the odds and it’s so amazing that you’re here where you are today. You went 73-9 and added Kevin fucking Durant. Then you won two titles and signed Boogie Cousins on a vet deal. Get over yourselves, seriously, are you 12? As a 23 year old NBA fan I’m honestly seething reading your bullshit comments right now, clearly you have no idea of the history of basketball or how great your team is. And no, it’s not because they “work hard” it’s because they’re talented. They just happen to work hard to solidify they’re talent, AND THEY DONT EVEN DO THAT UNTIL THE PLAYOFFS ANYMORE ANYWAYS, BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE TO WORK SO HARD BECAUSE THEYRE SO TALENTED"
Kevin Durant? 
"If you're like Kevin Durant, someone who's team doesnt really need them in the regular season, then yeah sure it makes sense  But I respect players more when they have to go hard both in the regular season AND playoffs .  But yeah, its smart to coast if you have that luxury "
"Yep, people on my ""I hope you fail list.""  1) Kevin Durant: The dude just rubs me the wrong way, I really like his game and enjoyed him before the attitude change, but this whole I'm a secure but insecure badass is annoying as all holy hell. People are contradictory out of nature but couldnt you have tried to basically not do a 180 between ""fuck yall I dont care"" and ""I do care dont be so mean.""   2) James Harden: My issue with James has purely to do with his reinvention of the rip through move, which he got from former teammate KD, and the gaming of the system. He is sometimes one of the 5 most enjoyable players to watch and other times flat insufferable. No issue with personality though.   3) Hassan Whiteside: Imagine a player with half the skill of dwight Howard and nowhere near the same level of greatness but acts the same way. Enough said."
Because JR Smith is an idiot and Kevin Durant is a snake. 
“Taj Gibson is a big strong guy!”  He’s like Kevin Durant skinny.
So why can't they just focus on now and worry about that in late June?  So if they win a Title with Durant then they can worry after at the parade if Kevin is leaving.
"I mean, a dynasty  is kind of a team that will live forever. Like, my Dad grew up watching Bird and the Celtics. I grew up watching the Jordan and the Bulls. Then there was Kobe and the Lakers. You can't say you grew up watching Steph and the Warriors, because he's not even the best player on his team. And nobody likes Kevin Durant. Sooo?   Yall could have been a Dynasty. Win 2016 and win one more the next year and you would be for sure."
Steph Curry and Kevin Durant?
"There were a lot of facebook-type bulls fans up in arms about trading for an “overpaid nobody” even though he could not have fit in any better filling the biggest hole on our roster. Oh no, is Kevin Durant not gonna sign here now? 🙄"
Someone needs to make sure Kevin Durant is okay after he sees this 
"He should come to the Magic  We have Mo Bamba, Nikola Vucevic and Khem birch as our bigs.  Forwards are Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Isaac   Wings Evan Fournier, T Ross, Wesley Iwundu, Melvin Frazier   Guards DJ Augustin, Markelle Fultz and Isaiah Briscoe   Kevin Durant would be able to average 35 ppg and everyone else would lockdown.  Markelle Fultz, Kevin Durant, Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon and Mo Bamba would be fun to watch."
Tim Duncan? Stephen Curry? Kevin Durant?
"We don’t know 100% what happens behind closed doors, but I think LeBron is a terrible leader and could be a potential hazard for team morale.   He have footage of him throwing teammates and coaches under the bus or pointing fingers at them, both in Cleveland and now Los Angles. His “I have no help. I need help” comments are one of the reasons why Kyrie requested a trade.   His actions during game one in the finals last season was inexcusable. Yeah what JR did was dumb. Yeah, it sucked they had a timeout left that wasn’t used, but you’re in OVERTIME AT GOLDEN STATE AGAIST GOLDEN STATE. He completely deflated everyone. He filled the team up with negative energy, while Steph was hyping up his team. LeBron just sat there and pouted.   Then he goes and punches a wall or board like an angry kid, hurts his hand, and displays it after he got swept to use it as an excuse for getting swept?   This is your King? Is this really your King!? A man who publicly calls himself the GOAT while the likes of Bill Russell, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kobe Bryant, and Tim Duncan exist? A man who will soon be eclipsed by Steph Curry and Kevin Durant? A man who is 3-6 in the finals? He’s no King. A King who has to call himself King is no King. "
Warriors: Kevin Durant I will drink your bath water #random
"&gt; I was disappointed to get traded from one of the best teams of all time but I'm not an idiot. It was to get Kevin Durant.

"omfg how many times do I have to explain this. Kevin durant was drafted by the staff created for Oklahoma. The new owners where already in the process of moving the team, so they hired the new staff to run the soon to be thunder. Presti was the guy that drafted all three of them. They where basically the new thunder staff already and they new they where moving to Oklahoma. Its all one thing. Got anything else stupid to say?"
Kevin. Durant.
  &gt;Technically Steph Curry hasn't beated Kyrie Irving in an NBA Finals w/o the assistance of Kevin Durant.  It's funny you would bring this up as a point when Kyrie has never even won a playoff series without the assistance of the best player alive.
they only went head to head twice..Kyrie was hurt almost all of the '15 Finals lol. So call it 1-1. Technically Steph Curry hasn't beated Kyrie Irving in an NBA Finals w/o the assistance of Kevin Durant.

"Well, either way, they are much worse with Cousins on the floor. As [Deadspin put it](https://deadspin.com/hmm-maybe-the-warriors-with-demarcus-cousins-arent-inv-1833085218):  &gt; Cousins, who finished with just 10 points on 12 shots in 25 minutes of run Tuesday night, now has a minus-0.8 net rating with the Warriors. Since his return the Warriors are an eye-popping 9.8 points better by net rating with Cousins off the floor, and the monstrous-on-paper Steph Curry-Klay Thompson-Kevin Durant-Draymond Green-Boogie five-man lineup has a surprising minus-0.9 net rating in 152 minutes together so far this season. Delete Cousins and turn that into a four-man lineup, and it’s producing a pristine plus-11.7 net rating over 823 total minutes. Cousins has thus far made that combination of players pretty definitively worse."
But fuck Kevin Durant amiright

Kevin Knox has the worst RPM among small forwards in the league. Frank Ntilikina has the second worst RPM among point guards. Opinion based on these two facts: The Knicks have so badly blown their last two first round picks that it's cost them Porzingis this year and will cost them a real shot at signing Durant and Irving this summer.
Danny picked Kevin Durant for MVP?
"You're misreading the Lonzo and ""capable"" comment.  I put ""capable"" in quotation marks because that was the word you used to describe the team.  I didn't say Lonzo wasn't capable; rather, it was the opposite: I said that the Lakers team without LeBron and certainly without either LeBron or Lonzo are definitely NOT a capable team.     The disconnect is that you keep calling the Lakers a 4th place in the West and called it a ""monumental failure to not at least make the playoffs.""  But that ""4th place team"" was the 34-game stretch to start the season where the Lakers had LeBron (and Lonzo).  Then LeBron went out for 17 straight games (of which Lonzo played the first 13) and when LeBron returned to the team, the Lakers were in 9th place and out of the playoffs.  Regardless of anything else, what is an incontrovertible fact is that until LeBron got hurt, he helped the Lakers get to 4th in the West and when he then returned from his injury, the Lakers were already tied for 9th and therefore out of the playoffs at that point.  Whether other pieces were missing or not during that span does not matter because I'm not arguing that LeBron was the only reason for the success/failure.  What matters is that LeBron had zero ability to prevent that slide because he didn't play in any of those games while he was hurt.    So this ""monumental failure"" was largely in part due to the Lakers going from a 20-14 pace, to then going 6-12 in games LeBron couldn't help his team win.  He then returned to a team on the slide and to make matters worse, the team he re-joined was without their starter in Lonzo.  As far as the other thing, it's not about saving the Lakers.  Again, I never said anything close to that.  LeBron wanted to go to LA for a number of reasons that had nothing to do with basketball (business, lifestyle).  But it's also true that the Lakers had a lot of young pieces and cap flexibility that would enable them to make moves over a couple years that could restructure the roster to bring in other stars and build a contender.  That was undeniably part of the appeal of going there.  So one of the reasons that LeBron signed a four-year deal was because it signaled publicly that he was committed there-- that it wasn't just a one or two-year stint-- and that provided the Lakers with time to try and bring in other stars to construct a championship contender.  ""Much was made of the Lakers quest to acquire Kawhi Leonard from the Spurs or sign Paul George from the Thunder as a precursor to landing James. Johnson, already jilted by George, didn’t have either in hand. James explained that he was in no rush, even at 33, and did not have a problem being the first headliner through the door. He wants to build a contender that lasts and believes the Lakers possess the recruiters, the assets and the salary cap space to do it.""  (Lee Jenkins, SI, https://www.si.com/nba/2018/07/02/lebron-james-lakers-cavaliers-nba-free-agency-magic-johnson)  ""The Lakers have caught roughly everyone off guard with their after-LeBron moves. They did not sign another superstar free agent. Nor did they trade for Kawhi Leonard.  They re-signed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. They added Rajon Rondo. And JaVale McGee. And Lance Stephenson. And then, most recently, they scooped up Michael Beasley for good measure.  These moves are, apparently, all part of a larger plan. Though they are directionless in the interim, a series of one-year deals preserves the Lakers' long-term flexibility. Stretching Luol Deng's contract gives them a clear path to more than $35 million in space ahead of 2019 free agency, by which time James will have been putting down roots and recruiting fellow megahumans for an entire year."" (Bleacher REport, https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787007-how-lebron-to-la-will-impact-2019-nba-free-agency#slide1)  ""Back to LeBron: I have never quite bought all-in on the idea that he absolutely needs a superstar partner in the bag to go to the Lakers. It would probably help, but LeBron's decision Friday may be a tell that it was never essential. Leonard could also be on the move soon. We'll see.  Regardless, transactions don't stop in mid-July. A Lakers team with LeBron, enticing young players and cap flexibility would instantly become one of the league's most appealing trade and free-agency destinations over the next 12 months. A second star could come in August or anytime before next season's trade deadline. A third star could come next summer. Sources have denied reports that LeBron texted Kevin Durant about possibly joining him in L.A., but if Durant signs a one-year deal this summer (or a one-plus-one with player option in Year 2), you can bet your life savings that every desirable team will be circling him all season. Durant's motives remain a mystery to everyone in the league."" (Zach Lowe, http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23938913/zach-lowe-nba-free-agency-preview-lebron-james-paul-george-kawhi-leonard)   "

Kevin Durant hijacked your franchise and made everyone forget about Curry. Your entire fanbase silently resents him and the way that the two titles were won. Now this summer when he leaves after y'all lose in the 2nd round the Warriors will return to the same irrelevance they came from. 
He is 6'2 like Kevin Love is 6'10. Not like Kevin Durant is 6'9.
"I doubt he gets maxed out in Philly. More like the Lakers strike out on their pursuit of Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and ""settle"" for Jimmy Butler."
Imagine if they played on the same team. Or on the same team with Kevin Durant too. That would be something. 
you guys still made a career 16ppg guy the 5th highest paid player in the league  he makes more than kevin durant and slightly less than james harden
I want Kawhi to stay in Toronto but in the off chance he goes to the Clippers and KD joins the Kings this is what the Pacific division would look like:  * Golden State Warriors led by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson  * Sacramento Kings led by Kevin Durant   * Los Angeles Lakers led by LeBron James  * Los Angles Clippers led by Kawhi Leonard  * Phoenix Suns led by Zion Williamson  You would have 4 perennial MVP candidates in the same division on different teams + the 2020 ROY. If AD joins up with the Lakers that makes it even more stacked. The division battles would be intense.
Kevin Durant just ran off the court
We are signing Kevin Durant 
"Alternatively, none of those players are worth AD.  A couple of good games doesn't make Ingram suddenly Actually Kevin Durant.  Kuzma is offensively streaky and defensively limited.  (Lonzo Ball is offensively ass and injury-prone.)  Other teams don't have to overvalue your young players like you do."
[Cowherd] Kevin Durant is uncoachable!
"I mean, the Mavs literally just took on all the cap reasons for why the Knicks couldn't sign Durant so I imagine it'd be difficult to even free up the space for him.  But assuming they do, the answer is no, there is realistically no chance.  There is nothing Dallas has to offer Kevin Durant that isn't already covered under the umbrella of the Warriors.  The Knicks ~~may be~~ are a garbage fire organization, but they have attractive possibilities that EVEN the Warriors simply can't match as far as market, fan base, legacy building, and just KD preference.  KD joining the Mavericks sounds cool when you compare it to something like the Knicks, but the reality is that every KD free agency suitor has to have something more to offer KD than the Warriors have.   The Warriors team with KD is better than that hypothetical Mavs team with KD for at least a couple more years, if not forever because of the possibility that KP and Luka don't become what they could.   KD already has emotional equity built up with the Warriors fanbase (aside from the ones who hate him for stealing Steph's shine), and many connections within the business moguls from Silicon Valley. Not to mention the fanbase and the new stadium and all these other variables.  Like Dallas just doesn't compare to the Warriors in all these ways and doesn't have these extra properties of attraction that MSG does, so I don't really think it's an option.   Also, KD moved his company to NY, like as far as I am concerned that just about seals all this up. He gave the game away.  "
"Thnak you!! I have been SAYING this.   And in a thread about the  * Bucks @ Lakers * Blazers @ Raptors  I said that the Bulls @ Hawks would be THE game to watch because of the young core the Hawks have and their future potential while those 4 other teams had exactly 0.01% chance of meeting in the playoffs. 4 overtimes later and I'm about to claim myself a slick Hawks bandwagon flair  The front office has been INCREDIBLY competent with their draft picks between ""the Traed"", picking up Collins and Huerter at 19. If you want to see some REAL SHIT I just swiped this blurb off wikipedia about the new (as of 2017) GM Schlenk that should rustle your jimmies:  &gt;!Travis Schlenk (born 1976-77) is the general manager of the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA. Prior to joining the Hawks in May 2017, Schlenk was the assistant general manager of the Golden State Warriors, having joined that team prior to the 2004-05 season as a video scout.[1] He has also worked as a video coordinator for the Miami Heat from 1999 to 2003. During his tenure with the Warriors, Schlenk developed a reputation for evaluating talent. He has been credited for being primarily responsible for identifying Draymond Green, picked 35th in the second round of the 2012 NBA draft!&lt;  That same GM, a video scout for the Heat when they drafted Wade, an assistant GM during the rise of the Golden State Juggernauts, now has a healthy breadth of assets including:  * 1st round Hawks pick (#1-8) 2019 * 1st round Mavs pick (#12-6) 2019 * 2nd round Hawks, Wizards, Hornets, Lakers/Wolves 2019 * 1st round Cavs (top 5 prot.) 2020  * and all their future picks  Not to mention that they've been more than adept at developing the marketability of their low cost/expiring talent to either package in a trade or retain -   * T. Prince * Alex Len (splashing 3s lately) * Kent Bazemore ($20 mil p.o.) * Miles Plumlee ($12.5 mil expiring)  They clear up those 2 bigger expiring contracts and they are left with (7 roster spots)  #$85 Million in cap space  That's enough to swing for the fences and get not ONE but TWO Max contracts. [With reports coming out that they plan on pursuing](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/hawks-eyeing-free-agents-from-kevin-durant-on-down-this-offseason/1xfyph5bymugq1g81kmjq69hy7) this is becoming less of a hard-sell and more of a Cinderella story.  The chance to team up with one of your high-talent buddies making max money while leading a franchise from zero to hero and getting dishes from the rookie with the 3rd MOST ASSISTS IN THE NBA? Surrounded by the guys going 40.7% from 3 after the ASB? An up and coming GM whose knack for talent evaluation has been proven time after time with a bunch of assets? Sounds like a dream.  +1 for the Culture.  +1 on the best Young Core^TM in the league (Young, Collins, Huerter)  Now, Atlanta isnt as big-market as LA or NY. But it's absolutely NOT small-market and has good climate (social and otherwise). Ideal for stars that don't like the cold (Kawhi) or obnoxious media (Durant).  Now, this situation is infallible. The biggest hole in this HIGH upside foundation is a fundamental one - **Defense** This can be patched through the draft, look at 2nd round rookies like Mitchell Robinson or like Robert Williams (whom Celtic fans never shut up about). I'm not gonna pretend to know what to look for defensively, but I'm certain defensive effort can be found by the guy who picked Draymond frickin Green [(and was a video scout for the franchise that picked the guard with the most career blocks)](https://sports.yahoo.com/dwyane-wade-passes-michael-jordan-to-top-nba-defensive-list-015757865.html)  In totality, this shapes to to be THE primier FA spot even if it continues to go underrated by onlookers, the media, and fans.   It's got the hottest GM this side of the Mississippi, the hottest Young Core^TM this side of the ASB, the best asset/cap space combo in the NBA and a comfortable environment all around free from lofty expectations or toxic management.  To top it off, they're also in the EAST which... it isnt lookin so easy anymore but I believe there's still a sliver of playoff spots that are easier to achieve than in the west (subject to change if Knicks become a squad)"

"It's horrible -   One of the announcers just ""explained"" that Draymond's shooting has taken a hit ""this season"" because of the addition of Kevin Durant. He even emphasized the addition of Durant being ""in the last year"". KD has been here for two full seasons and this imbecile is attributing ""recent"" shooting slump of a player, who's had shoulder injuries for two straight years, of ""new"" offensive schemes."

"going from ""he's getting in whether you like it or not"" to ""he has a chance"" and ""he can build on is resume"" is changing your argument. I was never arguing against those last two claims.

You keep acting like it's a done deal and anyone who disagrees doesn't understand how the hall of fame works but its just not true.   &amp;#x200B;  Saying what you said is ridiculous. If he gets in, good for him, but you are misinformed about his chances. I'd be surprised if you could find a prominent national writer who feels as confident about his chances as you do.  "

This is silly.  Stockton played with Karl Malone for 17 seasons. I can point to series where he completely carried Stockton.  Paul has never in his career gotten carried.  Put CP3 with Karl Malone (or Kevin Durant or Dirk Nowitzki) for over 15 years and I guarantee he would get to the finals multiple times.  And I take it even further. Put those two together and they would win at least 1 ring.
Kevin Durant says hello.
So how does thinking hes the best player delusion? Does paul george having a better season than kevin durant make him a better player? 
"nice try, Kevin Durant"

"He's 29, Kevin Durant will be 31 when the season starts I think he's talking about him."
"And see that's the thing, u might outshoot the Warriors for a game or two...but ur not gonna outgun them 4 out of 7 games...the odds of even doing it 2 games aren't in ur favor because they literally have the best 2 shooters in the league and Kevin Durant. I don't see them hitting all those contested 3s in a competitive playoff series.  Last year it would've been over in no more than 6 and maybe 5 games without Igoudala's injury. This year the Rockets aren't quite as good because they lost defensive depth on the wing in Ariza and Luc...which they could've really used against GS of all times.   GS just has way too much to throw at them.. especially now with Cousins"
"Kodak Black is actually from Pompano Beach, Florida.    Pompano is a type of fish native to Florida but......    high amount of immigration of Pompano fish from Florida to Los Angles have been reported.   Kodak Black therefore is also moving to a new hometown, which would be L.A.   Kodak and Kevin Durant are likely linking up to move to L.A.   KD to The Clippers confirmed."
"If anything, Kevin Durant is an example of why non-destination teams should appreciate players who stay.  But pretty much everything about this response is outright ridiculous."
"Yeah, and I'm Kevin Durant."
Kevin  Durant is signed to Nike. That makes no sense
Doesnt ur team have kevin durant on it?
wait... isn't Kevin Durant with Nike as James is too?!
"Can somebody give us advice on how to guard Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay and Boogie? At the same time?"
"If you want to watch Kevin Durant in a movie, just got watch the instant classic, Thunderstruck. In which Kevin Durant loses his NBA skills and it’s Freaky Friday’d into a suburban white kid."

"Yeah in 2014 he was fined 25K for tampering with KD   &gt; ""You know, my brother [Oklahoma City Thunder star] Kevin Durant was kind enough to come to the show tonight and watch us,"" Drake said.

An article by Kevin Durant
Does Kevin Durant not exist?
In 15 years few will remember Damian Lillard but most people will know who Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant is
"I also feel like any team missing like 6 of their 7 best players would struggle. We were still actually winning games till JV went down.  No Mike Conley, Jonas Valanciunas, Jaren Jackson Jr, Avery Bradley, Dillon Brooks, Kyle Anderson, CJ Miles, or Joakim Noah.  Let that injury list sink in. That's literally an entire rotation of players just not there. Four or five starters and probably your sixth and seventh man, too.  I bet the Warriors would look pretty silly without Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, DeMarcus Cousins, or Shaun Livingston."
"I can see it already.   Golden State, Game 7 vs Rockets: the Flu Game  In an awe inspiring performance that even shadows Jordan's flu game, the Golden State Warriors have done it again--and may have outdid themselves in one of, if not, the greatest Game 7 in basketball history.  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Boogie Cousins, all suffering from a flu, brought their team to new heights in basketball history by winning with a 0.1 three pointer made by Curry in the second OT.  After sinking the three, Curry, clearly sick from the flu, could do nothing but lay his back in the floor and celebrate this victory. Cousins and Green clearly wanted to go to Curry, but they were all on their knees due to flu. Green, specifically, was seen trying to crawl his way to Curry. Cousins was crying. Durant was out and may have been unconscious. Klay was there in the sidelines, standing and staring in the air.  The Golden State have done it again."

"Jeanie​ Buss​ was ready​ to let the​ Magic happen –​ again.  The​ Lakers​ owner​ knew that Luke​ Walton’s​ fate​ was​ hanging in​​ the balance, how her front office that was led by Magic Johnson truly believed that much of what ailed them in this disastrous debut season with LeBron James fell at the young coach’s feet, and that was just fine by her. The final choice, as she had told Johnson and others in the days leading up to his stunning resignation on Tuesday, was theirs to make.  She wouldn’t intervene. She wouldn’t push back. If that’s what Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka wanted, then so be it. They had earned her trust by landing LeBron in the first place last summer, and maybe that chasm that existed between Walton and the men who controlled the roster was too big to bridge. She had total confidence in the people who held the most basketball power.  End-of-season meetings would be had. Important decisions would be made. That was the plan.  And then, before that hammer actually fell, Earvin headed for the exits.  What an embarrassment.  There’s no other way to describe Johnson’s choice here, this move that will cost the Lakers so dearly after these past two years of brand rebuilding. He didn’t have the heart to tell Jeanie before going to the media.  “Somebody is going to have to tell my boss, because I know she’s going to be sick,” Johnson admitted to reporters. “But I know I couldn’t face her face to face and tell her, even though I was just with her yesterday and we had a three-hour meeting about the direction of this great organization. So today, Rachel, I’m free my love.”  He was talking to ESPN’s Rachel Nichols, who later followed up with Johnson during a one-on-one near the Staples Center loading dock.  “So you told us first because you didn’t want her to talk you out of it?” Nichols asked Johnson.  “Exactly,” he replied.  He didn’t have the professionalism to tell LeBron, a source close to James confirmed, forcing one of the greatest players of all time to learn about Johnson’s decision through the media. Never mind, as the source also confirmed, that LeBron had met with Johnson, Pelinka, and his agent, Rich Paul, on Saturday to discuss the future of the franchise without even a hint that this was coming. Three days later, Johnson was engaging in a 40-minute public therapy session with reporters that only sparked more questions about what he had done.  So let’s get this straight. You wanted to congratulate Russell Westbrook on his recent 20-20-20 night, and to retain the freedom to say things like that to non-Lakers players without fear of tampering charges from the NBA, so badly that you decided to dive off the runway that was cleared for you in Feb. 2017 when Jeanie fired her brother, Jim Buss, and longtime GM Mitch Kupchak? That’s about as believable as the idea that Walton was the one who inspired all the curious roster moves last summer which led to this mess.  In the days leading up to Johnson’s departure, this was a real story that was floating around Laker Land. Despite Johnson having told the world otherwise at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas last July, where he sat for nearly 20 minutes on ESPN describing why and how players like Lance Stephenson, Michael Beasley and Rajon Rondo became Lakers, history was being re-written in some circles.  Walton, some people of Lakers prominence had suggested, had wanted to play LeBron off the ball and thus sparked all those moves that didn’t pan out. Sources with knowledge of Walton’s thinking pushed back vehemently on this suggestion – as if the public record wasn’t enough to quell the notion on its own. Walton, quite clearly, was being made out to be the fall guy.  The re-framing of it all was as big a red flag for Walton as he had endured all season long, which is saying something considering the context. After all, this is the same coach who was read the riot act by his bosses seven games in.  “Shut the fuck up,” Johnson had told Walton when he tried to interject during their infamous Oct. 30 meeting that also included Pelinka, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.  Five months later, Johnson tried to downplay the severity of his early message.  “I think everybody blew that up,” he told reporters. “They over-blew it. Sometimes as a president, you have to have a tough meeting with a coach. We had a tough meeting. And after that, it was fine. And it’s been fine. I haven’t had any problems with Luke. People think we’ve had problems, but we haven’t had any problems. Just because I want us to be better and I want him to be better? If I had come back, we all had to be better, right? I’ve made mistakes myself. But also too, everybody had to be better. And that’s what it’s all about. But that’s my job, to demand that.”  While Johnson didn’t claim to know what Jeanie might ultimately decide about Walton, it’s safe to say his exit improves the odds of him continuing as Lakers coach. He signed a five-year, $25 million deal in late April of 2016 that is guaranteed through next season.  “It’s the right thing to do, the right move to make,” Johnson said of his decision. “And then that way, (Walton) can stay in place, hopefully build the team, coach the team the right way, and also, all the – what I didn’t like was the backstabbing and the whispering. I don’t like that. You know, I don’t like a lot of things that went on that didn’t have to go on. And so I hope that after tomorrow, the Lakers can head in the right direction – which we are.”  And then, of course, there was the ESPN elephant in the room. For months, there had been rumblings that the Worldwide Leader was working on a story which would be extremely unflattering for Johnson and that focused on his mistreatment of employees. When asked by The Los Angeles Times if that entered his personal calculus, he denied that it played a part.  “An article would never make Magic Johnson do something he don’t want to do,” he said, according to our Lakers beat writer, Bill Oram, who was there during the interaction. “I know me. Ask people who deal with me – ask them. They’ve been around me for 40 years. … Same dude I was when I first got off the bus. Never disrespected nobody, never did anything bad. Now, am I tough? Hell yeah I am. You work for me, I’m demanding. That’s who I am.  “But at the same time, I’m fair. (Is) an article going to stop – make me do something? No. I’m good. They’ve been talking about that article for how many months? (Laughs) Everybody run up, ‘Oh they writing an article.’ OK. Great. I’m going (to) say ‘Why didn’t you interview everybody at ESPN? You know how many times ESPN hired me? Twice. If I was doing something wrong to employees, disrespecting, you think they would have hired me twice? No. I know that article is not an accurate article. I can tell you that now. …Now it’s some disgruntled, former Laker employees (talking to reporters). Yeah, they gonna say (what) they gonna say, ‘cause they wasn’t doing their jobs. So what is a person going to do? Point the finger bad about the person who fired them. I’m good. I’m a big boy.”  It wasn’t the first time the media had become part of the internal conversation.  As The Athletic reported on Tuesday morning, the report from ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith in early February that Magic had been overruled by Jeanie on the June 2017 decision to draft Lonzo Ball second overall out of UCLA instead of Kentucky’s De’Aaron Fox was enough to cause consternation between the owner and the team’s top executive. Magic had made it clear to Jeanie that he wasn’t the one spreading that message, but the mere fact that they were expending energy on these sorts of situations was not a good thing when it came to the interpersonal dynamics that are always so crucial.  As for the Lakers’ (still) uncertain future, here’s what we know for sure. First and foremost, a decision must be made on both Walton and Pelinka.  “That’s a decision that Jeanie has to make,” Johnson told reporters about Pelinka, who is the former agent of retired Lakers great Kobe Bryant who had no previous front office experience before his March 2017 hiring. “I worked well with him. I had no problems with him. …Jeanie has to make all the calls.”  If you’re Jeanie, it’s time to make lemonade out of lemons. Leverage the Lakers brand – battered though it might be – to recruit the best in the front office business heading into this crucial summer. There is still time to send the right sort of message to this latest free agency crop, with stars like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and all the rest watching closely here like all the rest of us.  Elite players want to be in Los Angeles, and to wear the glorious purple and gold. What they don’t want, and what they have every reason to fear after seeing the latest Lakers saga, is to join a storied franchise that has lost its way again."
"Thanks for answering, what a crazy world we're living in where it's down to the Knicks and the Warriors for Kevin fucking Durant lmfao"
"Yep, I know some people will get on him for not winning one as we know Harden has plenty of haters.   However I don't think you can blame anyone for losing to this Warriors team. This is the most talented roster ever assembled. Even Harden and the Rockets being the only team to take them to a 6th game much less a 7 since Kevin Durant joined is a feat. I'm not sure if they win the title last year with CP3 healthy, the Warriors could have easily still won game 6 and 7 but being up 3-2 with home court is insanely impressive against that monstrosity."
Where do you think Kevin Durant ends up next season? I’d be surprised if he left the warriors after winning every season he got there.
Doubt it. I'm Kevin Durant.
"All of this is just pandering at this point. wow, you are so loyal, Dame, you get so much street cred unlike that evil snake Kevin Durant. Can you imagine Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan ever uttering some dumb shit like this? shut the fuck up and try to win. you don't have to sell your soul to do it, but quit telling everyone how pure you are. shit is lame."
In 2011 NBA finals a heavily favored Miami team with three all stars loses to the Mavericks in 6 games. The series statistics leaders are all Heat players except for Dirk leading in rebounds. Dallas is also the first team to win a finals despite being down in the series two times or more. Kevin Durant joins a star studded Warriors team that is being debated against the 95 bulls as the best team ever.  It’s only 2 vs 1 right now. Which is more impressive?And by real plus minus you can argue Steph curry has more of an impact on that team than KD does
"I never understood where the media narrative that Lebron is a basketball genius comes from.   IMO, Kevin Durant and Curry are actually much smarter players. Look at the way they move off ball, how they screen, how they position themself to get open."
"I think an important difference to note is that a significant number of an on Lakers fans easily knew the Lakers would not make the finals let alone possibly make the playoffs. However Warriors fans knew instantly when Kevin Durant was going to come that they were going to make the finals cuz they were already going to have made the finals.  You're right in that it was KD and LeBrons choices to go to their respective organizations, but to say that the Lakers are a mid-tier company out of nowhere is blatantly false, not to mention comparing NBA teams to help companies are run is really not a good comparison. If you want to make that comparison you should be comparing high-profile figures in the company like a CEO.       If you can find me CEOs who have switched from their company to their company's major competitor within the industry and then attempted to claim that they themselves deserve credit for innovations that their new company is responsible for then you would have a good comparison.       People don't hate on KD specifically because he went to the Warriors they hate on him because he acts like the fact that he's on the Warriors means he deserves credit."
"We hold rings in the highest regard because it is the single most difficult thing for a great player to achieve, more difficult than an MVP or getting gaudy stats or scoring a lot of points.  Kevin Durant joining an established championship team degrades that achievement.  Dirk's one ring is worth more than any/total of Kevin Durant's rings while KD plays on a full and healthy Warriors squad."

"Kevin ""Gollum"" Durant"
"That playoff run as a whole was absolutely crazy. The number of superstars he had to defeat on his way.  LaMarcus Aldridge, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Bosh, Dwayne Wade and LeBron James. That’s a crazy list of hall of famers and two of the teams he played had THREE each."
"Yeah but Kevin Durant is a controversial player and the popular opinion on here is that his ring is worth infinitely more than KD’s, especially since half the time dirk is even brought up on here is for that conversation. You already know the answer you’re going to get."
"Also, I hope you guys get a team soon Rashard Lewis and Kevin Durant are my All Time favorite players and it was the Supersonics that got me into basketball.  But I agree they are young and have a lot of time to learn and in Isaacs case bulk up even more."
"Well Love's career for sure has been dominated by injuries but careerwise they do both have 1 finals trophy.   Overall i don't like the player comparison and feel like its lazy because they're both white. Kevin Love's prime was much more ground and pound rebounding.    A better comparison for prime Love is probably Charles Barkley. Overall Barkley was more tenacious and Love could actually hit his 3's, but both guys made their bread and butter moving guys around the paint with their girth and getting putbacks. They're both a bit undersized too, with Barkley only being 6'6"" (here comes Zion), and Love at a highly disputed 6'10"".   Dirk on the other hand had a great array of offensive skills. Dirk could beat his man off the dribble and attack the rim, he could spot up from 3 which most 7 footers couldn't do with consistency at the time, and he had the unstoppable fadeaway. A better comp for Dirk is Kevin Durant who has roughly the same body. Durant's offensive versatility at his size is almost unheard of. Durant's the better career defender (when he wants to be), but that's a much more accurate comparison."

"Warriors won 73 games and then added Kevin Durant. It really isn't a ""disappointment"" losing to them. We even did better than Lebron against the KD Warriors. If KD leaves I think our chemistry and playoff battles would make us the front runners in terms of making the Finals."

"Let's look at this objectively. Take all the playground emotion of pick-up basketball out of the equation. We'll start with Kevin Durant: 1. Spent 9 years with a small market team, bringing them National recognition and basketball success(along with RW) 2. Fulfilled his contract to the Thunder that he CHOSE to sign. 3. As a free agent, chose his destination based off of his own motivations.  On the surface, Kevin Durant did nothing wrong. Technically speaking, he did the exact right thing for his career and I would say he benefitted from it.  Now let's look at Anthony Davis: 1. Spent 7 years with a small market team, bringing them average to above average success. 2. Hadn't yet fulfilled the contract he CHOSE to sign (2 years remaining at time of trade demand) 3. Publicly demanded a trade (against the CBA) from his team, to only one team.(LA Lakers) 4. The deal doesn't get made, in an attempt to protect the most valuable asset in the NBA, the Pelicans try to bench AD. 5. AD complains to the NBA, NBA steps in and forces the Pelicans to play AD.  On the surface, AD handled the situation poorly. He attempted, with the help of Rich Paul and LBJ, to strong arm a small market team into trading him to one team for return assets that the Pels may not want.  I'm all for player freedom and them choosing what they want to do in the League. But don't you CHOOSE to sign that 5yr/$127mil contract? I understand things not working out and asking for a trade. But with 2 years left on the contract, you have no leverage, the team with your contract has so much time to shop for offers. So in a way, you're correct. AD and KD situations are nothing alike. In the way that one player did nothing wrong other than not win a championship with one team. Whereas the other player handled their situation with zero professionalism and isn't responding well to being held accountable for their actions."
"Oden was a great college player yes but he was nowhere near as good in college as other big prospects like Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Deandre Ayton, Karl Anthony Towns, and now Zion Williamson.   There was a large vocal minority of people who were completely baffled that Durant wasn't going first overall. Read [this mock draft](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=nbamockdraft/070627) by Bill Simmons. It was absolutely not crazy to consider Kevin Durant. Granted I am nowhere close to as scathing as Simmons is in his criticism of Oden, but my point is that it's not revisionist for me to say I'd take KD over Oden. Oden was absolutely not a perfect prospect. Durant was.  Odens counting stats were definitely not bad, he averaged 16/10/1/1/3, on 59% TS and his shot blocking was definitely solid. His 63% from the line wasn't great but for a big it was solid. He played 29 mpg. All of this was great, his rim protection was excellent and he was easily the best player on the Ohio State team that made it to the championship game. He lost to an incredible Florida team that had 3 top 10 picks (Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Joakim Noah). He won the defensive player of the year award. He was a 2nd team all American.  There is no doubt I would have taken Oden second. He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.  Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.  We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college.  Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."
"Yep. I was in OKC during said time, I remember the articles before his Oakland trip that he was ""95% staying in OKC"".   I couldn't really blame him for leaving to any other team other than the Warriors/Cavs. Hell, even going to the Spurs to play for Pop would have been fine with me. But leaving for a 73 win team that you had down 3 - 1 but lost your marbles in the 4th....nah...fuck Kevin Durant.   Games 5 and 6 of that series still give me nightmares."
There’s a difference between training with people like Al Horford and Kevin Love than Lebron and Durant.
"Sounds like KD has a strain of endofseasonitis.  [\[Medina\] For whatever illness the Warriors say Kevin Durant has, he still did his pre-game workout. I’m sure he’ll be fine](https://twitter.com/MarkG_Medina/status/1115750360919040001)  (Do teams start to make imaginary ailments up to avoid too many DNP - Rest)?"
I didn’t see the Eiffel Tower for Rudy Golbert and the sniper for Kevin Durant
"Who is going to be ""Michael Jordan"" in space jam 2? It should be the best player in the world i.e. Kevin Durant"
"&gt;2. The warriors built this team from scratch, just like any other team they had some luck involved  Jordan, Pippen, Horace Grant, Kukoc were all drafted by the Bulls. Built from scratch.  The Warriors got Andre Iguodala, their finals MVP through trade and Kevin Durant through free agency.  The Bulls got Luc Longley and Dennis Rodman through trades.   &gt;but it wasn’t players being shipped off to new teams as part of an expansion like in the 90s.   Those expansion teams including the  1. Orlando Magic Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway.   2. Miami Heat Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning  3. Glen Rice and Anthony Mason Hornets.  All contenders.   &gt;The warriors are a combination of great office, lucky with drafted players and lucky with those drafted players having such small contracts that they could go get the second best player on earth and be able to afford him.   So just like the Bulls?   Who drafted most of their players during their title runs and got lucky enough to get Rodman and Longley through trades?    &gt;3. Go learn a little about basketball before posting stupid shit on here. Thanks  Talk about irony lmfao"
"Really sad when people were comparing Porzingis to Dirk and saying he could overtake him. Most this people do not understand how dynamic Dirk was as an offensive player. The best 6'11 and up player on offense in NBA history. The only other player that is above him is Kevin Durant. Even a guy like Luka would have to prove he can take a team to the playoffs for over a decade, while winning 55+ games in the regular season in a very tough Western Conference before he can even be compared to Dirk."
"**Who’s the best player of all time? (117 votes)**  Michael Jordan (73%)  LeBron James (11.9%)  Antawn Jamison (10.6%)  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1.7%)  Magic Johnson, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant (1%)"
100% Durant.  If Lebron didn't exist KD would become a champion and Best player in the world in 2012 at age 23.  With a Ring no way do they trade away Harden.  KD wins a bunch of rings and the Warriors probably trade for Kevin Love.
Kevin Durant or Curry
"Why do people pick out single quarters over a stretch of 90+ games. No Harden carried them, and like any human needed some help time to time.   Harden had Josh Smith and Corey Brewer playing one half of way above average basketball for them while relying on Harden to carry them the other 90+ games.   Great players like LeBron and Curry can really on players like Wade, Kyrie or Kevin Durant to carry them for stretches when they are cold. Harden relied on Josh Smith for one stretch and for some reason that is a hit on Harden."
&gt; The Servant (Kevin Durant)  God that nickname is so fucking dumb.
"It's just an example to illustrate how quickly things change, Giannis doesn't have to wait 6 years for the comparison to hold.  Also, KD said he wanted to play his entire career in OKC and have his jersey retired there are recently as 2015: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career"
"\&gt; The Athletic’s Bill Oram reports that a league source believes the trio of Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson [are not targeting the Lakers](https://theathletic.com/912303/) as the top team in their upcoming explorations of free agency. Instead, the Lakers will receive “second or third” billing on the three NBA stars’ respective wish lists."
The Kevin Durant/Charles Barkley crossover I’ve always wanted!
"But they do often win.   Michael Jordan*   Karl Malone   Shaquille O'Neal*   Allen Iverson*   Tim Duncan x2   Kevin Garnett   Steve Nash* x2   Dirk Nowitzki*   Kobe Bryant*   LeBron James* x4   Derrick Rose*   Kevin Durant*   Stephen Curry* x2   Russell Westbrook*   James Harden*    Those are the winners of MVP in the last 20 years. Out of all of those, only 3 (karl malone, kevin garnett, and tim duncan) defense was a significant contribution to their argument. The idea that MVP is not about offensive production is just wrong, when you look at the asterisked seasons."
Kevin Durant has a massive pp. Find a new slant.
"I think the fact that he wasn't able to live up to expectations does make the Oden pick a bust. Context is important. I would consider Oden and Bargnani busts, but for very different reasons. At the end of the day, Oden was picked over Kevin Durant and did not have the career he was supposed to have."
Kevin Durant probably voted for himself.
"This survey is pure gold. There are so many subjects where I have an opinion on or just went Whoah!  &gt; Who’s the most overrated? (47 votes) &gt; * Draymond Green, Russell Westbrook (17%) &gt; * Jimmy Butler, Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns (6.3%)  I love to see that his peers see Draymond as the same overrated prick as I do. Also nice that the Twolves Triumvirate is in second place.  &gt; Who’s the most underrated? (116 votes) &gt; * Jrue Holiday (16.3%) &gt; * Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton (6.8%)  I really like Dame but isn't he overrated at this point, when everybody says he is underrated.  &gt; Who’s the best defender? (114 votes) &gt; ... &gt; * Klay Thompson, **Torrey Craig**, Mikal Bridges, Marcus Smart (1.7%)  First I thought that the players a trolling once again but then I checked Torrey Craig. Wow he is a nice rotation player for the Nuggets and I never heard of him before. Also he earned multiple defensive awards in his pre-NBA career. I really have to step my NBA watch game up this season. Really did the Wiggins this season and floated in and out of it.  &gt; Who don’t you want to fight? (Or just ‘Who’s the toughest?’) (105 votes) &gt; * James Johnson (43.8%)  The question isn't exact, right? I don't WANT to fight James Johnson if I didn't lose my mind.  &gt; Where will Kevin Durant be playing next season? (109 votes) &gt; * New York (63.3%)  As a Knicks fan....Y-E-S!"
73-9. Kevin Durant.

*Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
Yeah and Kevin Durant is meeting with the Hawks in free agency but that doesn't mean he's going to sign
Kevin Durant was also going to LA. That's when he said SAS was making stuff up and SAS threatened his career over it.
"\&gt; Where will Kevin Durant be playing next season? (109 votes)  * Oklahoma City, \*\*“NBA,”\*\* “Eastern Conference,” (1.8%)  You're not wrong there."
Demar derozan is going to LA!  Paul George is going to LA!  Kevin Durant is going to Washington!  None of these three even gave a meeting despite Stephen A saying they are absolutely going there.
Kevin Durant and tall grass
The vote for Kevin Durant was Kevin Durant.
"I agree. Ben Simmons, Luka Doncic, Malcolm Brogdon, Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Durant."
"'me' is used as an object of the sentence, meaning it is the passive recipient of the action: Kevin Durant pisses me off. 'I' is used as the subject, meaning the person enacting the verb: I hate Kevin Durant. In the instance above, the easy rule is that if you drop out the other person from the equation, and the sentence still makes sense, use that word. For example, 'me and my mom hate Kevin Durant' translates to 'me hate Kevin Durant'. That's bad English, so you know you need to use 'I'. Then you put the 'I' after your mom out of respect. She raised you after all and taught you to hate Kevin Durant."
"Google ""Kevin Durant re-sign"" and find that you're wrong."
2017 Finals MVP: Kevin Durant (35.2 / 8.2 / 5.4)  2018 Finals MVP: Kevin Durant (28.8 / 10.8 / 7.5)
Only 1.8% of players believe Kevin Durant will be in the NBA next season.
"No, you simply don't understand what you are actually asking for. You are thinking ""ah, this side is physically larger than the other one, so it isn't fair"", but there is a sneaky problem with that:   Lets say you are making a map of a square state. The map should be square as well to make it 1:1, right?  e.g. 0-100 miles on the x, 0-100 miles on the y axis.   It's simple to see what the correct ratios for producing those plots are because we are comparing distance with distance, but that goes away once we use other units.  Well now lets say you make a physically square chart with ""TS%"" and ""points scored"". What should the range be here for it to be ""accurate"" 50-70 TS% to 20-40 points? 0-70 TS% to 30-40 points? 40-55 TS% to 10-150 points?   All of those can be fit into a physically square chart, but none are more correct than the other because there is no 1:1 conversion between TS% and points. They aren't the same units. So that means I can stretch and pull the chart in any way to make Harden or Curry look more like an outlier and still make the chart physically square. Physically making the chart square as we see it on the monitor is just covering up the real issue that 1 TS% != 1 point.    You see what I mean?  There are some potential solutions however. One fairish and simple way to do it is to rescale each value by the mean and standard deviation of the data. I did that here if you want. Then since each axis is ""Standard deviations away from the norm"" we can compare them 1:1 like people want to:  if you absolutely must compare Harden and Curry we can make up some metric that at least makes some semblance of sense by normalizing the values to the mean and std of the distributions:  Points per 70 possessions has a mean of 14.3 and a standard deviation of 4.1.   Adjusted TS% has a mean of 53.28% and a standard deviation of 4.86%  ---  Harden in 2019 has a pp70 of 34.1 and an adjTS% of 62.4%. So that means Hardens ppg is 4.83 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 1.88 stddev above the mean.     Curry in 2019 has a pp70 of 29.2 and a adjTS% of 67.6%. So that means Curry's ppg is 3.63 standard deviations above the mean and his adjustedTS% is 2.95 stddev above the mean.    Doing that for every player we get this plot which can be considered ""square"".

"&gt; So then why does this result in an over-representative amount, in this sample population, voting for Russ and Dray?  Because they're known to have beefs with many others and are also two of the more cocky players in the league. They're also having ""average"" seasons so it fits the narrative.     &gt; Why is there no vote for Embiid? ... Why isn't there a single vote for Kevin Durant   What's the error rate of this sample? It's going to be relatively large. Not to mention that unlike Russ and Dray, they're having a pretty good season.      &gt; Frankly, if you were to ask me who would top a poll of ""most overrated"" voting by NBA players, Russ and Dray would be in my top 5 of probable candidates to ""win.""      Do you really believe that is the case though? Objectively it seems quite unlikely it is true. The reason he's there is the same reason Harden or Lebron got votes. By any measure, they're not the most over-rated players in the league. People vote them for other reasons.    At the end of it all, personally I wouldn't use results from a survey like this for any quantitative analysis of performance. There is in all likelihood bias and the question too subjective."
"Just read the rest of this thread, holy shit this thread gets touchy. To people just clicking on this thread:  1. Don't bother with it lmao.  2. Multiple players can be outliers in different ways.   3.

"&gt; You end up with people voting for those they don't like personally and people who may be more objective in voting, not voting at all.  So then why does this result in an over-representative amount, in this sample population, voting for Russ and Dray?  &gt; This results in a situation where you're likely to have people who vote, vote for players who they have beefed with the most.  Why is there no vote for Embiid? How many other players have openly beefed with other players, than Embiid?  Why isn't there a single vote for Kevin Durant, who supposedly has many players thinking he's soft and screwed up the competitive balance of the league?  Why isn't there a vote for Chris Paul, who is known for being a sneaky cheap-shot artist, an inveterate whiner to refs?  Why isn't there a vote for a few of the guys who are role players, but who would be at the peak of arousing personal dislike on the part of multiple players? I.e. Patrick Beverley and Marcus Smart."
"I don’t think having Curry or not having him would have any bearing on that whatsoever. First,....Where a guy is “ranked” is completely arbitrary. You can go into South Boston now and guys will still say Larry Bird is the greatest player they ever saw. Second....Durant has 2 titles with Curry, but Durant has won 2 Finals MVP’s. So, maybe the question should be more reflective on Durant’s value to Curry and not the other way around. Third.....”Passing” Larry Bird in imaginary rankings will have no effect on how Kevin Durant’s playing career is judged after he retires. And playing with Curry shouldn’t change how it’s viewed either."
"MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo  ROY: Luka Doncic  1st Team All-NBA: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid"
If I'm being 100% honest it would be hard for anyone to beat this team from a pure efficiency standpoint.  PG - Stephen Curry  SG - Klay Thompson  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Giannis Antetokounmpo   C - Dirk Nowitzki

"Um, excuse me but DC likes Kevin Durant very, very much."
Kevin Durant at shooting guard was pretty hilarious.
I think you're forgetting who tf Kevin Durant is
"I am interested in the ""it just makes sense"" bit. How does it make sense to leave one of the best run organizations where he is appreciated and the media caters to him to go to one of the worst run franchises who throw their players under the bus and media who is without a doubt unbelievably harsh? I also don't understand the Kyrie Irving pairing. Two isolation heavy players who need a lot of volume. Just doesn't make sense to me when looking at how Golden State is constructed which allows him to get open looks at-will. He has done the isolation volume thing with another PG in Russ and look how that turned out.  He has plenty to prove in Golden State. He could literally be the anchor for the greatest run of all time. No matter what people say about him being a snake now that narrative will change in 5-10 years.  People will look back and be like holy shit, Kevin Durant was the best player on the best team of all time.  To me, this all feels like pure speculation and media hype by people not in the know. Has there been any reliable source, ON RECORD, saying that KD will leave? Genuinely curious because all I have seen is Stephen A and Cowherd both of which are not reliable sources AT ALL.  Woj tweeted that they were ""prepared for a big change"" but they should because KD is not loyal and they know that....he left OKC to sign with them."
What?  Dwight Howard...arguably Greg Oden and Kevin Durant too.
"&gt;According to NBA.com, Lowry has defended a total of 65 post-up possessions this season. Opponents have scored 48 points against him for an average of 0.74 points per post-up possession.  &gt;That ranks Lowry in the 82nd percentile in terms of how efficiently he defends those plays, putting him ahead of Kevin Durant, Ben Simmons and LeBron James to name a few.    Technique and leverage matters a lot in post defense, and for whatever reason there are shorter guys like Lowry who do surprisingly well in the post.    For comparison Kawhi allowed 1 point per possession on postups, which is not good."
"Oh, you think LeBron’s Heat was just like Kevin Durant heading to GSW? Boy oh boy"
"&gt; He spent a quarter of the season averaging as many 1st quarter points (9+) as Kevin Durant  He also shot 50% at the rim (and something like 34% on driving layups) despite being 6'9 and athletic, and showed absolutely no aptitude for defense or playmaking."
"Yeah, even if AD leaves after one year and you missed out on Zion, who gives a fuck.  You just signed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for probably 4 years."
"He spent a quarter of the season averaging as many 1st quarter points (9+) as Kevin Durant. Right around 3rd in the league. Scouts aren't dumb, they know the difference between what a young player does when well-rested and when fatigued."
"Kevin Durant could be saying that now. Suppose GS wins now and 3 peats. At the pitch meeting Golden State sells him on reupping for at least 1 more year and chasing a 4-peat. Durant seems like an emotional guy, even Marcus Thomposon has said that. His word now may not be the same after he's had all his free agency meetings."
"Because Kevin Durant is telling you ""trade the pick and I'll sign with New York"""
"That's kind of the NBA's fault for not taking into consideration off-court income for superstar players.  Ex: Kevin Durant can afford to take a pay cut to play with a team because the endorsement bonuses he gets for playing for a champion far exceed the minor reduction in pay.  This gives GSW, or other teams that are seen as being 1 player away from competing for championships, a huge advantage over up and coming teams.       So fuck it, tank away and collect those high draft picks, particularly if you're a small market team that can't lure big free agents."
"Name 3 players in his position who have averaged 20 and 10 over the last 2 decades   Since it’s a reasonable stat line for his position   I can’t even think of one   Kevin Durant, who’s basically a 7 foot small forward, has never had a fucking 20 and 10 season   You’ve got to be shit posting, at least I hope that’s what this is for your own sake"
I’m a hopeless Knicks fan... but I believe this is true. When they traded KP they unofficially announces that they signed Kevin Durant.
"But Kevin Durant was in 2016 and is in 2019 absolutely good enough to lead a team to a championship. If he was not hampered by Billy Donovan in 2016, injuries to Westbrook in 2013 and Ibaka in 2014 he likely would have.   Fair play that he chose to go to the Warriors to have fun and win rings. But you can't say he's automatically Ned Stark in any other situation"
"The Kevin Durant and the overall better play by key players may have done the trick as well.  I don't think LeBron gave a transcendent performance that won the finals in 2016 because Klay said it's a man's game, I think he played like he did in 2016 because he's goddamn LeBron and was driven towards his biggest accomplishment of his career."
"EDIT: Wow, gold. Full disclosure, I spat this out at 2AM on drugs so don't take it seriously.  Just to demonstrate how easily you can spin one of these ""RIGGED"" narratives with circumstantial evidence and a nice-sounding story...   #Why the NBA will rig the lottery for the...   **New York Knicks**  New York is *the* market, and has the most iconic arena. But they're lacking one key ingredient: success. With Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Zion Williamson, the Knicks will be on top. The NBA will ensure their biggest market gets some much-needed love.    **Cleveland Cavaliers**  They [already rigged the 2014 lottery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgZ5Uz8UfB0&amp;ab_channel=JordanHightower) for Cleveland, so they're going to do it again because they love Cleveland want it to be successful post-LeBron! (Less clear is *why* the NBA loves Cleveland. Maybe they really like swing states?)   **Phoenix Suns**  The lottery was rigged two years in a row for Cleveland, so they're pulling the same trick with Phoenix. They also want Zion Williamson to get the best medical staff available.   **Chicago Bulls**  The NBA wants Chicago to be a huge market again so they can mark up old Michael Jordan merchandise from clearance price to premium. They also believe the Bulls are overdue for another pick, as it has been 11 years since the last rigging.   **Atlanta Hawks**  Because dammit, they've got to get good at *some* point and the NBA is getting impatient.   **Washington Wizards**  The NBA wants to increase its political influence among both D.C. politicians and the largely African-American population of the federal capital. Additionally, the Wizards make for a nice narrative due to their recent mix of success and struggle.   **New Orleans Pelicans**  The NBA dislikes the relative lack of enthusiasm the Pelicans get compared to other teams, especially after they finally sorted out the Bobcats mess and gave New Orleans their own logo and new history. They even got a bird and everything! Zion Williamson will be used to test the Pelicans: if there isn't a surge of interest than the NBA concludes the franchise might be in serious trouble.   **Memphis Grizzlies**  Pity and/or preparation for the move back to Vancouver! (NOT REALLY, I love the Grizzlies, the Grizzlies are the best, nobody loves the Grizzlies more than me honest)  **Dallas Mavericks**  A parting gift for Dirk Nowitzki, and a nice way to bring interest back to Dallas after his retirement.   **Minnesota Timberwolves**  The NBA wants to bring some serious attention to Minnesota and the northern US in general in preparation for the eventual expansion team in Canada (which will be in Winnipeg, because reasons).   **Los Angeles Lakers**  The NBA reads /r/nba and wants to annoy all of you in the biggest way it possibly can. (No seriously it's because they're the Lakers, duh)  **Charlotte Hornets**  At the annual conference where all 30 owners agree on which way the lottery will be rigged this year, Michael Jordan threatens to come back out of retirement as another publicity stunt unless his team is given the #1. Frightened at the prospect of Jordan's legacy being tarnished by a second rise from the grave, the NBA agrees.   **Miami Heat**  The NBA wants to expand its reach in the Spanish-speaking market, and so decides to revitalize the Heat with Zion Williamson. As part of this strategy, the NBA will also televise all Heat games with Spanish play-by-play.   **Philadelphia 76ers [via Boston]**  The NBA wants to demonstrate that their new lottery system is prone to highly to random outcomes, and that good teams will be rewarded for not tanking.  ---  And there you have it. It's all rigged, obviously"
"It wasn't, Zion has legit guard skills already, Davis did not  Working backward, if the best player in college basketball is a former guard who shot up overnight, one might now expect Davis to be a hybrid monster like Kevin Durant. Having learned the guard's game, this hypothetical Anthony Davis -- Davis ex post facto -- would be a highly skilled big man with the ability to handle the ball, stick acrobatic jumpers and set up his teammates for each basket.  In truth, Davis has surprisingly little to show for his former life as a guard. His regular-season high for assists at Kentucky was three, reached just twice. His assist rate, the percentage of team baskets he assists while he's on the floor, would place him only 120th among NBA bigs, behind noted ball hog Michael Beasley.     As of now, the fact remains: Davis is first and foremost a shot blocker. For the time being, teams have to consider the worst-case scenario: Can a one-way force be worth that much to a team and, indeed, to the league as a whole?"
lol @ kevin durant calling anyone else in the nba a snake
Kevin Durant already scored before the screen is set
"Harrell, Williams and Beverley, with the assistance of a couple of rookies, took the Warriors to exactly as many games as the Rockets did, and the Warriors had Kevin Durant for *all* of them."
"Come on man, I watch the games very closely. I have since 2003, been a big NBA fan all my life. Kevin Durant on his own has elevated his game on both sides to a level that is unfair. Steph helps him in terms of spacing, as does Klay. Its not that Durant himself is on another level compared to Steph. It's that Durant has taken advantage of his talents(7 feet tall with a game like a shooting guard) and perfected in ways that are just unmatched. Steph is a beast and HOF worthy, but he doesn't have the ceiling KD does because of the physical gifts. And KD has mastered his talents to perfection, and even if Steph has done that, KD is still at an advantage,"
Kevin Wayne Durant
"Kevin Durant. He's fun to watch, was a Sonic, and still shows Seattle love."
"First off, I think your post is just fine. There's a fair bit of reasoning, better than 90% of the stuff you see on the sub, so just ignore people who wish to put you down without giving any thoughtful explanation.     Point 1 about Kevin Durant is obviously the biggest thing here. Him being out for the first 2 games, and potentially not being at 100% for the rest of the series, is the sole reason why Portland has a good chance this year.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; the Blazers have gotten more quality minutes from their non all star caliber guards than the Warriors have.      I actually agree with this. Hood and Seth will be the 2 best bench guards in this series. Livingston might have the advantage of experience, but he is clearly not on the same level as the past couple of years due to his advanced age and niggling health issues. On the defensive end, it's hard to see him containing any of the Blazers 4 guards.      On a bigger level, I think that the output from the Blazers backcourt in this series might match of even surpass that of the Warriors. Reason being that Klay (outside of his game 6 heroics) hasn't exactly been playing well offensively throughout the playoffs so far, whereas his counterpart CJ has been a revelation of late. Steph is struggling to find consistent form, and people really aren't paying enough attention to his dislocated finger and how that affects his ability to drive left and finish with his off hand. Though it must be said Dame was a little hot and cold in the Nuggets series as well.     You also make other points that are worth considering, but perhaps 3 things in the Warriors favor that you might have overlooked are:  &amp;#x200B;  1. **Experience:** Guys like Iguodala are big game players who have a wealth of experience in dealing with high pressure scenarios and executing down the stretch. The Blazers don't have a single player who has experienced championship success, let alone a deep playoff run. 2. **Contributions of Aminu and Harkless:** Aminu and Harkless were poor in the Nuggets series after a great showing against OKC. Looking at the Rockets blueprint of stifling the Warriors on D, you need wings who can adeptly defend multiple positions and also contribute on the offensive end. Especially when KD is about to return. 3. **Draymond Green:** Always has a big showing against the Blazers. His defense and newfound ability to score at a decent rate remains a problem that Blazers will need to solve. And they have never really done that before. 4. **Kanter's Health:** As mentioned in your post, Kanter has been balling out so far. But that remains to be seen if he can sustain his level of play for another punishing series. Adrenaline and will to win only goes so far in sidestepping pain. Outside of Kanter, the Blazers have a dearth of options at the 5. I do expect Zach Collins to step up, but he is still young and inexperienced. Someone like Meyers Leonard is unplayable against the Warriors. Nurkic is obviously the biggest miss here.  That being said, I do expect this series to be a lot tighter than people think, and certainly more competitive than their past playoffs matchups. I'll call it 65%-35% in favor of the Warriors for now, though that can easily shift.   The intrigue of this series is the factor of uncertainty (widespread health issues for the Warriors, Kanter's health, hot and cold form of several players on both sides). Looking very much forward to it."
"Good for you man. You looked at both the teams, went through their players and came away thinking Blazers will win. Not ""can"" win but will win. Amazing.  None of the points you mention are correct. You looked at things askew and decided to stretch the ounce of data you have.   &gt; The Warriors are without Kevin Durant   You just barely saw the Warriors beat Houston without KD and still chose to use the KD argument as th first point in your list. That itself shows me there is no merit to anything else you are saying.  And in fact there isn't."
"He has the 5th most win shares in the playoffs this year behind only Nikola Jokic, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antekoumpo.  He almost dragged his team to the conference finals when Harris and Embiid were choking on offense for the entire series.  He's not a Tier 1 superstar, but he was easily one of the most impressive few players for this year's playoffs."
"Imagine calling a teammate to **Kevin Durant** a front runner.  Good joke, OP.  Kevin Durant is *literally* the biggest front runner in NBA history."
Okay even better   Westbrook put up a nearly identical stat line as the second option to Kevin Durant. Curry was the number one scoring option.
"too bad Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant, notorious NBA killers, play for Golden State."
\*cries in kevin durant\*
"Man i can remember it like it was yesterday game 6 of the 2011 NBA finals..... Kevin durant vs Dirk, a 7 foot one man offense got out played by jason terry."
"""The one with the crazy beard""  ""On the Clippers?""  ""Kevin Durant?""  Yeah wasn't exactly Zach Lowe in there"
I'm not sure how you got far enough in the video. I had to give up after about 15 seconds of him trying to name James Harden and instead saying Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant and Lebron James. They had to form super teams in their primes to save their legacy, otherwise they'd be useless like Harden.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar is similar. Magic Johnson saved his career.  Stockton and Malone were dirty players and I am glad they never won a ring.  How the hell did Steve Nash win 2 MVPs?"
"They both lost in 6.  The clippers weren't given a chance and won two. Including the single biggest post season comeback. On the road. Versus the defending champs.  The rockets , however, managed to lose at home, in game 6, with a full lineup, in a game sans Kevin Durant (number one scorer in the 2019 postseason) and curry with 0 points and three fouls at half.  The clippers walked off the court to a standing ovation with a lot to be proud of, and a future and clear things to build upon and get better next year.  The rockets walked off to stunned silence, disappointment, and just knowing they're not as good, despite the talent depth and a dream situation.   Ultimately the rockets lost as 7 point favorites, the clippers got the same result as the rockets as double digit dogs nightly    The clippers had a better series than the rockets."
Zaza/ Draymond/Kyle Lowry/ Joel Embiid/ Kevin Durant (He joins with draymond after they sweep the warriors in the finals)
PG-Ben Simmons SG-Jimmy Butler  SF-Kevin Durant  PF-draymond green C-Demarcus cousins
"the raptors replaced a pretty good shooting guard with an all time great, and then also added one of the best veteran centers in the game.  The Blazers... well, i just think Lillard is top tier and he's in his prime now and it was inevidable, but it helps that he only had to get through the thunder, who are not good, and denver, who are brand new to this.  &amp;#x200B;  By the way, i really dislike the player Russ Westbrook. he just sucks to have, your team will always just be decent enough to make the playoffs but never good enough to progress. Because he brings you to that level by default, but at the same time also hamstrings you preventing you from ever progressing past it, unless you have kevin durant who literally is like a top 10 player of all time, and even then it's the westbrook show. He really just sucks. 30 shots per game a 40% shooting every playoffs, who the F wants that?"
"It's exactly like that scene in Billy Madison when the kid pissed himself!  **Rudy ""Billy Madison"" Gobert**: Of course I cried! Everyone my age cries after losing; it's the coolest!  **Joel Embiid**: Really?  **Rudy Gobert**: YES! You ain't cool...unless you cry after losing.  **Joel Embiid**: Hey, look! Charles Barkley cried after losing, too! Alright!  **Old Farm Lady**: If crying after losing is cool, consider me Kevin Durant.  **Rudy Golbert**: OOH! That is the sssssaddest thing I've ever heard in my life! Let's go."
"I already mentioned that the 2017 had the best offense in NBA history. It's literally better than all those unreal teams, 86 Celtics, 96 Bulls, even the 2017 Warriors couldn't handle their offensive output and the only reason this series was over so quickly because that team is the greatest team ever assembled. The Cavs were a little too offense oriented so they couldn't defend those Warriors. No other team you mentioned has the insane offensive highs that Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant at their peak bring.   And I don't really have to mention how fantastic the 2016 Cavs were.   You're saying CP3 + DeAndre is a dangerous combo when Kyrie and LeBron is so very obviously far better. Plus all the role players were on point in 2016. Great defensive and offensive contributions from pretty much every rotation player.  Also claiming LeBrons defense would be exposed when it was a huge reason why the Cavs dominated the Warriors in 16 shows you how much you live in your own reality."
"All about the meteoric rise to winning championships, and having Kevin Durant do what he did.  Sure, Portland's been making the playoffs on average for the last 20 years, but this is our first WCF since 2000.  But hey, winning championships is what it's all about. I know people in the past got tired of the Celtics, Lakers, Bulls and LeBron's Heat."
"&gt;  His main concern will be bulking up and proving his durability on defense.  Even that is less of a concern when teams are starting P. J. Tucker, Kevin Durant, Josh Jackson and other obvious small forwards at the 4.  If the opposing 4 can't guard him at the 3 point line and he can hit it, any decent defensive rotation will keep the opposing 4 from popping off scoring.  How many true 4s can drop an efficient 20+ anyway?"
"Damian Lillard is coming for him, Kevin Durant talked smack on CJ's podcast, this shit is gonna be good"
"Yeah, but he made those connections back in the day.   Now he’s away from the courts, and in a studio.   It’s why when Kevin Durant called him a liar, SAS threatened to start going to locker rooms again.  His sources are very questionable nowadays if it’s not one of his old connections (Kobe, Floyd, Melo, etc)."
Draymond spent hours in his car after losing to LeBron James. He called Kevin Durant during that time period. Who knows if he cried
Perk is a well respected veteran who is[ friends with](https://www.thebirdwrites.com/2016/2/13/10983230/anthony-davis-mentor-kendrick-perkins-pelicans-bad-season) [both](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-refused-tell-kendrick-perkins-about-free-agency-plans).
"Glad to see he recovered. It’s so sad that people have been sleeping on him. He was the Kevin Durant of his age group - a tall, athletic scorer that can get points any way he wants (37 ppg in high school). He gets plagued with injuries and everyone forgets he exists, but he really has every chance to be great."
"I know Donovan had this Kevin Durant guy, a mere top 15 all time player but Billy did go to the WCF in his first year."
Kevin Durant? Draymond Green? Andre Iguodala?
1. Kevin Durant  2. Giannis  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Paul George  5. LaMarcus Aldridge  6. Blake Griffin  If lebron played the whole season I might put him ahead of some of these guys but these guys all got their teams to the postseason and they didnt cause locker room issues the way lebron did. I say that believing hes the greatest basketball player in history. This just wasnt a good look for him this year but I'm betting hell be back next year.
"Why would you just make up the name ""Edwin"" when Kevin Durant actually has a real brother (Tony Durant)?"
"Yup, Kevin Durant definitely wasn't doing this in OKC while playing with Russ ""PASSBACK"" Westbrook..."
Fuck Kevin Durant tho
"Nothing says ""I have a small penis"" like adding Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins to a 73 win team. Seriously fuck that organization, can't wait till they go back to being mediocre as they always were."
"Isnt crazy Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka were all on the same squad?"
"KD, Kevin, Durant, Slim Reaper, Durantula, and the servant?"
"The warriors didnt break any rules, but you cant deny that the marked cap increase didnt help sign an already (organically grown) amazing team. The warriors were already insane after Steph and Klay developed the way they did, and then add the 2nd best player in the league. So yea, its hard to win against a team that already has the one best player development programs, and who then added Kevin Durant."
"Also fuck the Warriors, I respect them less each year they continue to have Kevin Durant."
It was favorable for Houston because Kevin Durant is Kevin freaking Durant and to act like the Warriors are the same without him is foolish. Being at home with the other team down a 35 ppg scorer is favorable at the very least.
"It's a matter of situation. A mid range shot is always gonna go in at a higher percentage than a 3, but it won't be more efficient because it counts for one less point. You wanna shoot more threes throughout the course of the game, but when it comes down to one important shot you want the highest percentage shot.   This is why Curry helps the warriors more throughout the game than Kevin Durant. He helps them play better on the average possession. However, when it comes down to one possession, you want Kevin Durant shooting the ball, because he's more likely to get you a bucket on any given possession, even if he's not more efficient throughout the game.   Some number examples: Durant May score on 5 of 10 possessions, and score 11 points on those possessions.  Curry may score on 4 of 10 possessions, but account for 12 points. You wanna roll with curry throughout the game, but you want Durant to close and take the big shot."
"This is what makes Kevin Durant such a great player: he can cut to the basket, he can hit the 3-ball, and he has a mid-range jumper.   It makes it difficult to guard him, and that makes it easier for him to score.   When the defender knows you won't take a mid-range shot, he guards the three and makes the shot you are going to take more difficult.    It's like a guy who only drive left or right; you place your body on that side to cut the drive off and force him to go the way he doesn't want.   There is a pendulum in the NBA right now, and it's swung to the 3-ball, and in all likelihood, the 3-ball will forever be a critical element of the game going forward; however, it will be the teams with a diverse array of offensive weapons who will come out on top with all things being equal."
"Exactly. A 40% 3-point shooter (1.2 points per shot) is called an elite floor spacer, but there's more than a handful of them floating around the league. A 60% midrange 2 shooter (1.2 points per shot) is called Kevin Durant."
"News is so weird now. One person writes an article, then every sentence from that article gets aggregated to other sites, who write their own article about that.  Someone should write another article based on this one, called ""Kevin Durant uses FaceTime"" and link to all the aggregators, and so on."
apparently the Blazers just signed Kevin Durants brother Edwin Durant too
"&gt; Kevin Durant body, handles the ball like a point forward, he’s got a great feel for the game  &gt; handles the ball well, a willing passer  Both quotes from Fran Fraschilla during his analysis of Giannis for ESPN on draft night. PG skills in a 6’9 super athlete are what he was drafted for."
"Damian back in Oakland.  Zach Collins vs. Klay and Draymond.  Seth vs. Steph.  CJ vs Kevin ""Don't worry about what goes on at the top"" Durant  I'm excited. Hope it somehow goes 7."
Kevin Durant is such a bitch. Just jumping to the top instead of working to get there.
&gt; name a more iconic duo?  Kevin Durant and taking the easy way out.  Boom. Roasted.
He's like Kevin Durant but good
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  EVAN TURNER is so fucking bad.  He's worse than Sean Kemp's Blazer tenure.  Misses a 5 foot jumper and causes an and-1 on the other end.  He is the worst Blazer of all time.  I would rather have Greg Oden on the bench.  I would rather have Raymond Felton.    I hate Evan Turner like Kevin Durant hates hard work and actually competing for championships.
And the thunder losing Kevin Durant and harden isn’t?
"Well, how many unguardable scorers have we seen, though? Kevin Durant is *one of* the most unguarable scorers. There have been others, some of whom were better, like MJ. If that's his claim to fame, he has to be the best. Curry is *the best* shooter of all time. Not one of the best.  I'm not sure Giannis is going to change the league the way Steph has, but based on how they've already performed and where their trajectories end, I'd say Steph ends up higher all-time than Giannis. Maybe Giannis will have a 50-40-90 season while simultaneously exponentially increasing the league's popularity in Europe. but so far, Steph is the better player."
"im saying you cant say giannis will definitively end up below steph considering how good he already is  kevin durant is one of the most unguardable scorers this game has ever seen. curry’s inability to win finals MVP will be a stain on his career, while KD’s accolades will boost his legacy. kd has also consistently been an all-time great playoff performer, far greater than steph in that regard"
He’s Kevin Durant
"&gt; If KD wasn’t efficient or less efficient people would be singing a whole different tune.  Lmao what? You're basically saying ""If Kevin Durant was a lot worse then people would think less of him as a player""  No shit."
Friends was set in New York and his best friend is Kevin Durant.
Negotiation tactic? He doesnt need to negotiate. He is  Kevin Durant. Every team will start with a max offer and then see what else they can add to it.
"You are right he choked that series in 2016. But steph didn’t even win finals MVP the year before. How can the argument even be made? Most clutch playoff performances by year in the “last half decade” which btw is a weird time designation but still:  2015: Lebron (people argued he should’ve won MVP despite being on the losing side) 2016: Lebron 2017: Kevin Durant without question 2018: Kevin Durant without question 2019: Damian Lillard and Giannis have outplayed Steph so far this year, jury is still out it could be steph.  I just don’t understand how that argument could be made, I get this is a steph love thread but still"
What was more insulting was Chuck implying the warriors were a one shot wonder without Kevin durant. It's not a an uncommon thought around here either.   But anybody who doesnt see that the pre-KD warriors were capable of multiple championships have got some serious blinders on
Kevin Durant?!
Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins will never come close to the legacy of these guys.
"I wish he would just take the money and buy Madagascar and save the lemurs. And then make a Kevin Durant Disney movie loosely based on him as the lemur king.  Please Kevin Durant, your legacy as the Lemur King is bigger than basketball can ever be."
Kevin Durant has done and said many conflicting things so who knows what his real desires are.
"Nah we’re the New York Knicks, not the New York Bricks. I’ll take 1 Kevin Durant and 1 Klay Thompson instead thank you"
"You can try and apply all the logic you want to the situation, fact of the matter is, these are not robots, these are people. Kevin Durant (more so than any modern superstar) could make his decision in a fashion totally contrary to who we see him as now (he already did that 3 years ago). The Warriors can sweep the Finals, KD can average 45 a game, the Warriors can lose to the freaking Blazers, with KD averaging 13 a game, IT DOESN'T MATTER.  I know that idea as a fan of the team he is on is hard to accept, but I fully believe in that fact. KD will make his decision on what he feels. Does he love living in San Fran? Would he like it better in New York? How does KD feel about how the fans treat him in Golden State? Does he think Draymond and Steph are declining? How is the relationship with Kerr or Draymond? Is Klay thinking about leaving? What is Kyrie doing, is he staying in Boston? Most importantly, is Kevin happy and would he be happier elsewhere? Who the hell knows.  So where is KD going to sign this summer? I don't know. How about you ask KD on July 1st, because that's the only way you are going to have any idea."
No one knows what Kevin’s gonna do. Even Kevin Durant doesn’t know.   Does he care more about money? Legacy? New challenges? Playing with his friends? We’ll find out!
"His legacy will be fully repaired?? It’s never been broken. It doesn’t need to be fixed. As of now he’s a MVP, 2x FMVP and 2x NBA Champion with a long list of other accolades. He’s the best player in the game. He really said it best. “I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am”."
"This is what he said in December 2018 :  ""I just want to make sure I get as much money as I can on my next deal so I can stack up my money and figure it out. That's just the plan. Play basketball and stack money.""   &amp;#x200B;  Also some more from the article:  ""Ain't nobody can recruit me no more,"" Durant [**said on Haynes' podcast**](https://twitter.com/ChrisBHaynes/status/1077257583264595968). ""I want to dictate the environment that I want to be in. You can't give me the bells and whistles. I would rather see what you do on a day-to-day basis. That stuff really doesn't impress me.   ""Arenas and doing extra s--- just for me? Like nah. I just want to see if you're a real person, if you are going to hold people accountable every day. Are we all coming to work and enjoying basketball every day? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm getting here (with the Warriors).""  &amp;#x200B;  Source: [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-wants-much-money-i-can-next-free-agency-contract](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-wants-much-money-i-can-next-free-agency-contract)"
"again, he joined a team that won 73 games then added Kevin Durant, then they won 2 titles easily. fuck Boogie hes a pussy and his ring is worthless."
&gt; Kevin Durant does not give a flying fuck about parity.   Yeah but he might give a fuck about legacy.
"Kevin Durant will not retire at the end of this season. He may re-sign with many teams, but he will resign with none."
Yeah until they got kevin durant. This is when warriors turned evil
"If the Miami Heat retired Chris Bosh's jersey, I think Kevin Durant is a very safe bet to get his up in the rafters in San Francisco."
&gt;kevin durant will always be known as the little bitch who ruined parity and took away 2 rightful rings from lebron  &gt;he and melo will never make the hof
Kevin Wayne Durant will not be signing as a free agent with the Washington Wizards.   He’s already said many times that he isn’t interested in playing home because he wants to explore and find new ways of life and etc. This is why he went to college in Texas instead of staying in DC with Georgetown. This is why he will never play with us.
"Teams also play whoever offense on him on the other side of the ball. Yes he draws a crazy amount of attention, but Kevin Durant is clearly better than he is. Like I said, Giannis, Kawhi, and Harden all have good arguments for being ahead of him. Personally, of those names I'd put Kawhi over him."
Kevin Durant : Knicks Kyrie Irving : Nets Kawhi: Clippers
Kevin Durant this seasons is 52.  Though I am noticing it seems to trend lower for guards.

America is a baron landscape. The flying demon Stephen A Smiths have been at it for days. The California landscape has been decimated. Canada’s once great forests are also now gone and burning in repetition. Hints of Kwahi being signed by the Lakers begin to static everyone’s minds.   Elenor goes to Publix and starts scanning groceries. She looks up to see a skeleton shopping for today and says: “Do I know you?”  The skeleton begins to chatter it’s jaws when Elenor realized “Kwahi has been signed by the Lakers”. Suddenly her screen is taken over by Stephen A Smith as he just keeps laughing. Elenor’s head morphs into the screen as she is overcome with hells laughter and her entire body is absorbed by the checkout screen. The skeleton packs her groceries and walks out without paying a dime.  Kevin Durant is still at home in his safest place. His closet. He’s repeatedly trying on sneakers but none of them seem to fit. He’s decided to start drinking that Cognac sitting in his fridge. He looks out his Bay View and sees the world burning.  “God help me”  The hillside erupts into flames and chases him. He jumps into his workout pool as the flames of hell burn his house down. He goes for air only to see a team of Lebrons organized by Stephen A Smith staring down on him.   A Harley roars. So fucking loud his neighbors jump into their bathtubs believing they are under another tornado watch. Rik Smits enters the playing field.
The reason it was idiotic wasnt just that. If they make the same trade for Kevin Durant in 2013 and win a title who cares if they're depth suffers at a certain point in the future. The problem absolutely was because of such low ROI and that was predicted
anything specific as to why yo think the raptors wouldnt be able to defend the warriors with kevin durant? what specifically will we struggle with?
"LeBron wins a championship in Cleveland, Kevin Durant joined the Warriors after Draymond cried in the parking lot, Raptors won a championship"
"Much of this is true, but none of it is nearly as impactful as Kevin Durant not playing. I'm honestly not salty. Like, if a bitch don't wanna fuck, let her go. I'm just here to remind   you guys that.  To be honest, my initial post was supposed to be funny but people giving me this crazy-ass blowback about the East being legit got ridiculous. Toronto rented West starters kinda like Boston did with KG. 40% of Toronto's starting line-up had plenty of experience and scouting info on GS. And they would not have had a chance in hell if Durant played. This is the biggest absence in a pro sports championship in recent history, and those 11 points in 10 minutes showed it."
"[Read this article](https://www.complex.com/sports/2019/06/jay-williams-says-warriors-doctors-misdiagnosed-kevin-durant-before-game-5)   &gt; Jay Williams, stated his belief that Golden State ""misdiagnosed"" Durant's injury.   &gt; he professed that the reason the organization did this was so that they could get the most out of their star just in case he decided to bolt from the Bay Area as a free agent.  &gt; Williams went on to say that he knew for a fact that Durant was told he couldn't ""injure the Achilles at all."" As mentioned above, the pair has a relationship and they reportedly ate dinner together on Sunday night.   Like I said, he’s close with KD and it’s not hard at all to see a connection. Think if your friend who you tell everything came out talking like that publicly, everyone will think it’s also how you feel."
Kevin Durant
LeBron James Kevin Durant Stephen Curry Russell Westbrook James Harden Kawhi Leonard Blake Griffin Chris Paul Dwayne Wade Anthony Davis  This is tough..cuz some guys are more significant than they are good
1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. James Harden  5. Kawhi Leonard  6. Chris Paul  7. Blake Griffin  8. Russell Westbrook  9. Anthony Davis  10. Jimmy Butler
Equivalent to the Kevin Durant warriors? No they weren’t lol
"&gt;He knew the move wouldn’t be well received, but he did it anyway.  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y   He didn't know. take the L nephew lmao"
"At least she was the real 2014 MVP, unlike the false MVP Kevin Durant, whom the NBA even says won that year smh..."
"The Stephens embrace each other’s presence. Their lips touch.    Suddenly both Stephens become pregnant. Their bellies swelling. Both fall into labor.  Back on the floor again they begin screaming. It’s a devils auto tune scream coming from the depths of hell.  Their heads snap back as if breaking. Spider like arms rip out of their abdomens.  Spilling out their buttholes is an army of Stephen A Smiths. Growing and being brought into this world at the same time.   Hellish screams over take the studio as the spider baby Stephen A Smiths begin slaughtering the studio.  Blood, carnage and death every where.  A body is thrown into the factors.  It’s torso ripped in half. The cameras are still rolling.   All the spider Stephen A Smiths begin tirades of unimaginable proportions. It’s like a thousand talking heads screaming. Viewers at home can feel Stephen A Smiths in their heads. They also begin to scream. Their heads start exploding.  “Lebron has asked to be traded.  Mike Tuna is headed to the Dodgers. Did Isiah Thomas take his clothes off in front of another women?  The Yankees payroll has reached 3 billion. The Boston Bruins are a hockey tram!”  The White House begins burning.  Lincoln’s statue rises from its slumber and walks through the water and climbs the Washington monument. I have a dream no more as the heavens rip open and demon Stephen A Smiths fly down from the skies setting ablaze to America.   Skip Bayless has a belt around his neck in a gimp suit. Surrounded by pictures of Stephen A Smith. He reaches ecstasy and collapses dead. A single tear falls down his face to reveal a smile.   Every tv in the world is showing one picture. The spider queen Stephen A Smith smiling into the camera.  “I’ve created a team of Lebrons in Seattle. Kevin Durant!!!!!!  RUN!!”"
That and Kevin Durant lol
1. Kevin Durant 2. Michael Beasley 3. Quinn Cook 4. Kyrie Irving 5. Steph Curry
Steph Curry  Michael Jordan  Kevin Durant  Lebron James  Hakeem Olajuwon
"That Rockets team arguably could have won the chip if they got past GSW. The narrative until they got knocked out/the warriors lost has always been that the Rockets are the Warriors biggest challenge. Dropping 2 to that team is not an awful thing.   I know what team I’m imagining. Kevin Durant was averaging 32 points with a block and a steal on 59%eFG. He was absolutely dominating. As incredible as Kawhi was, Durant was playing just as well (if not better) until he was injured.   They dropped 2 to the Clippers, but they were in control all series. No one really questioned the outcome of that series. They had an average net rating of like +9.5 over 6 games.   And I really doubt “free agency drama” had anything to do with the teams injuries/demise"
"You guys are comparing a team of LeBron and AD to Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Demarcus Cousins. A 35 year old LeBron at that."
"Just imagine having a team with a prime Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant and LaMarcus Aldridge."
"Stephen Curry is currently 31, and he'll turn 32 towards the end of this upcoming regular season.   He's only 3 years younger than LeBron James, and he's 6 months older than Kevin Durant even though those two had been superstar MVP level players for years and years before Steph broke out into one himself.   I still find all of that pretty surprising.   Another classic one is Amir Johnson, who just turned 32. He played on the Pistons with Chauncey, Rip, Prince, Sheed, and Ben during the season when they won 64 games and lost to the eventual champion Miami Heat in the Conference Finals."
Victor Oladipo is 3 years younger than Kevin Durant
"they dont really have an excuse to be honest, there is something called preventative medicine, which is why having a team with depth will allow you to manage and keep players fresher and less at risk, kind of like what we did with load management for kawhi. the warriors had their least amount of depth in their entire 5 year warrior teams, look at their numbers on basketball reference, the team was too top heavy, kevin durant has had 4 foot surgeries in his whole career before the achilles surgery, and steph has had injuries over his career too which is why he was able to be signed for a cheap 4 years 40 mil contract years ago, the warriors needed to surround themselves with more depth like they did in all their other years. what did they do instead? they signed demarcus cousins while he was recovering from an achilleles injury instead of improving their starters/bench. Just having zaza and javale alone along with nick young would've improved this team much much more. Cousins was a liability on defense every time he was on the court, we would help off him and it wold be harder to do so with a guy like javale and zaza in the pick and roll and pop."
"And how about Kevin Durant in 2017?  Game 1: 38 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists, 64.4 TS%  Game 2: 33 points, 13 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 steals, 5 blocks, 70.8% TS  Game 3: 31 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steal, 1 block, 72.0% TS  Game 4: 35 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks, 60.3% TS  Game 5: 39 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal, 86.1% TS"
Kevin Durant won two rings with the Warriors
He is without a doubt #2 and has an argument for #1 depending on how Kevin Durant returns from injury
"im not diminishing lebron's team, Im a lebron fanboy, im just speaking my opinion, the raptors teaam was not as good offensively as the warriors team prior to the matchup but had the top defense of all the playoff teams, by the end of the matchup, raptors had averaged 111.5 pts when they averaged 104 pts prior in their other 3 playoff series and limited a warriors team averaging 114 ppg down to 105.6 for the series. Remember the rockets failed to beat the wariors team without kevin durant and boogie cousins, and just the previous year that same rockets team lost to the warriors with kevin durant in 7. I dont see how ppl can think the 2016 cavs team was better than the raptors, no one is providing a tangible argument, it's just ' X is better than Y"""
"&gt; then a 73 win team had to add Kevin Durant to beat him  Good lord, what a crock. LeBron had 4 Finals losses before 2017, the Warriors didn't HAVE to add KD. Adding him just made it nearly two sweeps in a row, if not for a game the Cavs hit 24 threes."
[Wojnarowski] The Los Angeles Lakers have traded Lebron James to the Golden State Warriors for Kevin Durant. More details coming.
The real difference between LeBron and Jordan:  Jordan played with the second best wing of his generation for the entirety of his prime in a watered down era where other superstars' 2nd options were role players like Kevin Johnson and Terry Porter  LeBron had to play against a 73 win team that added Kevin Durant during the latter half of his prime
Tell me again how Kevin Durant is somehow lame for joining a super team just to win a championship and somehow ruined the league....
inb4 Kevin Durant magically heals and Klay comes back just in time to save the warriors in game 6.
*cough* kevin durant *cough*
"Ah yes, Jason Terry was a sidekick in the same sense Kevin Durant/Steph Curry is. This makes sense to me. Very good take."
How's Kevin Durant and Kyrie doing on the Knicks?
Kevin Durant.  We are very close.  Im prepared to offer him the full max
"[Woj] After meeting with specialists in New York, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson opted to perform a new, technologically advanced surgery which will repair KD's Achilles and Klay's ACL in 5 days. The Warriors are back.  &amp;nbsp;  ^^^pls"
"It’s Kevin Durant. He’s the biggest reason the Dubs have had a stranglehold on the league the last few years. He’s the biggest cheat code in the league and can score from anywhere. If you’ve got the chance, you get him"
*My Kevin Durant-like frame*
"Kevin Durant: Even if they sign him they're going to need to wait a year for him to play.  Kawhi Leonard: Very little noise about him going to New York. It's either stay in Toronto or go to LA.  Kyrie Irving: Woj makes it seem like he's a lock to go to the Nets, as if the deal is already in place.   Kemba Walker: Has publicly stated that he's loyal to Charlotte. If he doesn't go there then the Lakers have been reported to have a lot of interest if they can get the cap stuff to work out.  Klay Thompson: He's not leaving Golden State.   Jimmy Butler: Haven't really heard much at all about him. I'm sure that Philadelphia is going to offer him the max. The Nets might also if they sign Kyrie.  D'Angelo Russell: If the Nets let him go, he's been linked to Indiana, Phoenix, and other places. Not the Knicks though.  Tobias Harris: This is a possibility.   Kristaps Porzingis: Obviously not.  Khris Middleton: I think the Bucks offer him the max and he stays.  Nikola Vucevic: I think that the Magic pay their guy, but if not maybe this is another possibility?  DeMarcus Cousins: I think he's going to whoever gives him the most guaranteed money, even one of those 1-year deals for like $20+ million. The Knicks could do that.  Those are all the All-Star caliber free agents."
Kyrie also wanted to play with Kevin Durant
"Before I freak out, you do at least know that Russel Westbrook Kevin Durant and James Harden were teammates, right?"
Kevin Durant has accepted a max contract from the Los Angeles Lakers.
"Kevin Durant didn’t play that well in the 2018 Finals, LeBron outplayed him"
"&gt; That 2025 swap could be really interesting if the Pelicans are good at the time.  5 years. 5 years from drafting Kevin Durant was all the Sonics/Thunder young core needed to be a championship caliber team.  Obviously that’s the best case scenario where you draft two other all-stars with your picks. But with 1+4 this year and depending on how the Lakers picks go, they’ve got quite a few chances."
"Golden State was only missing Kevin Durant during the finals, they ran out Curry, Thompson, Green, Iguodala, and Cousins for the majority of the games. If you don't think having a bunch of G-League players put up no points in the finals then you must not have been watching."
Woj: BREAKING: Kevin Durant has intentions to sign a one year deal for 10 million with the Lakers
Nah fam... we still cookin for the foreseeable future https://www.skysports.com/nba/news/36244/11742182/golden-state-warriors-plan-to-offer-max-contracts-to-kevin-durant-and-klay-thompson-reports
Kevin Johnson  Kevin Durant  Kevin Love  Kevin McHale  Kevin Garnett
- Kevin Garnett  - Kevin McHale  - Kevin Love  - Kevin Durant  - Kevin Johnson  /thread
Very unfortunate. The fact that it’s likely that we’d only see flashes of the old Kevin Durant when he returns is pretty depressing
"I mean, the after a tightly contested 7 game series, the man’s immediate reaction is to call Kevin Durant to join his team, knowing that would guarantee they win the next year. I don’t think he had that much confidence in his original 73-9 squad winning on their own against Lebron again."
"We are in the running for every major FA according to shit tier media that needs clicks.  Meanwhile this summer will be the first time since 2010 where we actually pursue the superstar names. Before that we were never in on Dwight Howard, Iguodala, LaMarcus Aldridge, Gordon Hayward, Lebron in 2014 and 2018, Kevin Durant in 2016, Al Horford etc."
He's Kevin Durant
"Bruh I hate feeling like a Lakers fan rn.  As much LeBron is transcendent and the second greatest player of all time, I wished we pursued a superstar who works beautifully offball and isn't so ball dominant. I hate our development team; I saw the potential of greatness in Ball, Hart, and Ingram, especially Ball and Ingram, but we can't develop shit. From what I've picked up, our team actually lacks in the analytical and coaching departments (not sure how accurate this is, but it does explain our system this past year), and I feel robbed that as a Lakers fan, I never got to see those two live up to their potential with us and they might do it for a different team.  Say what you want about our acquisition of star talent, we've always had at least one star/superstar that's homegrown when we won our rings, and we don't have that anymore.   I always will support the Lakers, but there's an empty feeling with LeBron, Davis, and potentially another star free agent that joined our team.   None of this feels organic, and our front office certainly doesn't deserve this success after the failure of the last season. It almost feels lucky we acquired all this talent while other teams with cap space are going to strike out just because they're small market or not appealing enough.  Am I excited about a potential ring? Yeah. Did I want it like this? No.  It's like the whole r/soccer thing with teams like PSG and Manchester City. Those teams also have no real home-grown academy talent anymore, they just buy their players that they need, but their players don't have an identity or DNA of the team if that makes any sense.  When I grew up, I was overjoyed to watch the way Kobe bled purple and gold for us (even if I discovered later he wanted a trade at one point until we got Pau, lol). There's way something nice about being able to call a star our own.  When I wanted a free agent originally for our young core, I was hoping that we would hold out for Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant, two players who can grab a bucket if they need to but work exceptionally offball due to their cutting and spot up abilities.   Idk it just doesn't feel right, and I probably repeated a bunch of points and this rant will never be seen, but these are just my thoughts."
"Yup, it was more akin to trading for Kevin Durant right now, but with his work ethics and his groups being questioned."
"My theory is when golden state choked the 3-1 lead and Cleveland won, a portal was opened that lead to the bizzaro universe timeline. Think about it, Cleveland won a championship and came back 3-1 in the nba finals to a 73-9 team, Cleveland choked a 3-1 lead and the Cubs ended their championship drought, Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors, Donald trump became president of the United fucking states, Elon musk sent a a car into space,  Patriots came back from 28-3, Hulk fucking dabbed in the avengers and Fortnite was in the avengers, Keanu Reeves appeared in cyberpunk and the Toronto raptors won an nba championship! 2016 was a great year up until the end, I say it was golden states fault and Lebrons fault for this portal. Gsw because they choked and Lebron because he came back."
He was being hidden on Draymond Green the last two finals bc he would get torched by Kevin Durant. He's been declining since he left Miami.
"i'm sorry, but if you don't take kevin durant in free agency you've got to be the worst gm in the entire history of sports. durant joining golden state is a knock on him, not on the warriors as far as i'm concerned. i've rooted against golden state for as long as they've had durant, but all it takes is not being a salty sportsfan to recognize that the golden state front office is one of the smartest in the league. meanwhile lakers fucking up every step possible and still emerging as winners"
Retarded. Lebron didn't play with all those players at once. By your logic Kevin Durant has played with  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green  Demarcus Cousins  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams
"The Blazers missed out on Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant, shit happens :/"
"If Dominique Wilkins can come back from the same injury to be an all star nearly 30 years ago I'd bet literally anything that Kevin Durant can as well. Like do yall who think KD might be done realize KD might be one of the 10 best players ever? Most guys don't come back from this, but KD isn't most guys. And like I said if Dominique can come back and be great, along with other positive cases like Rudy Gay, I'm convinced that KD will be top 10 in the league when he's back."
Steph Curry (15-16) Kobe Bryant (12-13) Kevin Durant (13-14) LeBron James (12-13) Anthony Davis (17-18)
"Kevin Durant and James Harden. Both single, played for the Thunder together, have beards."
Apparently Kevin Durant is the kind of player Golden State should be paying other teams to take off our hands. /s
How is it a favour for GSW if they have to *expend* assets to do it?  Durant leaving already drops the team under the salary cap.  &gt; Why would the Knicks offer to help them without compensation  Because they get Kevin Fucking Durant out of it.
"Gurantee   Is that like a guarantee, but made by Kevin Durant  I srsly don't know what you're trying to say  I also didn't realize there was such a thing as an LMFAO god"

So do you guys have [selective memory ](https://youtu.be/X_aIsR4GEYY) are you [guys really ](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/how-the-lakers-hit-reset-to-begin-life-without-kobe-082433847.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma) just [this young ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/lasportshub.com/2016/05/31/lakers-rumors-kevin-durant-an-option-for-los-angeles/amp/)  I’m not making this up. Unlike you I’ve been here for a while. This happens every year.
If he isn't going to be Kevin Durant again who will he be?...🤔
"Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler (twice). Lamarcus Aldridge. Kevin Durant. Russel Westbrook (yes that was a thing). That’s just the last few years. Man these Lakers fans are young."
Basically this. 73-9 and pick up Kevin mother flippin Durant...
"Kawhi faced Giannis and Curry this year those were the only 1st team all-nba players he faced.  Since 2011 Lebron has Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant (twice), Steph Curry (twice).  Your information is wrong u/Ducks718  Further, Lebron's run last year better than Kawhi's. And Kawhi's team this year was infinitely better than Lebron's last year Kawhi's team is a 50 win team without him."
"Why are you trying to bait a LeBron vs. Jordan argument weirdo, no one even brought him up. lol judging by your sad post history it seems you are way too obsessed with him, seek help  Hollinger intentionally manipulated the numbers so that it created a ranking that would match peoples' biases at the time. That way it could gain credence and that's why there are still people who trust it today. If people saw this brand new stat at the time and Jordan wasn't at the top, no one would've used it.   Or do you agree that Boban is the 2nd greatest player ever and that Rudy Gobert was better than Kevin Durant this season?"
"Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo...  Just to be clear, you think Zion Williamson is a better prospect than all of these guys?"
"Kevin Durant will be an elite offensive player well into his 30s strictly because of his size and length. Even if the he doesn't come back as the same Kevin Durant, he can catch and shoot over just about anyone and get easy 20+ points."
I don't think you're reading this right. Are you implying GS is offering a pick to sign and trade Kevin fucking Durant? Because that's what I'm referencing in my comment.
"?? I'm talking about the teams he went and formed. In heat and when he returned to cavs with Kevin love. Durant in his okc team had to go through Spurs, Lakers, Dallas, grizzlies, clippers and in 2016 warriors. What team has LeBron had to go through the east?  The aging super team Celtics lmao?"
&gt;Post-Achilles Kevin Durant might not be Kevin Durant again  Wait he's going to change his name to one of his alts?
"If kevin durant has an identical twin brother than why would nobody know about him, does he live in the basement 🤔🤔"
"Fun fact if it wasn't for Klay Thompson, Draymond green, and Kevin Durant, Stephen curry would be 0-5 in the finals."
 He is on the same level is Kevin Durant
No not like that if he could have taken over for him as being a twin brother could he have done that with each want to kill these that Kevin Durant had if you had a twin brother playing for him for the last game against the raptors
 Hypothetically if Kevin Durant had a twin brother could he have played one he had the Achilles torn torn or ripped up for whatever you guys wanna call it
Kevin Durant having a twin brother for spare parts is the hottest of takes I've ever seen.
"You have successfully subscribed to Seattle 2020 NBA Champions!  After winning the 2020 champions, the Seattle Rockets sign Kevin Durant as a FA, signing a 4 year minimum contract. They couldn’t offer him a max, or anything really, but he didn’t care."
 If you had a twin brother could he have played when Kevin Durant have a torn Achilles
 If Kevin Durant had a twin brother could he play as a back up per has his replacement I mean
"I mean, any other team in the world has Kevin fucking Durant go down and have no hope at all in the NBA finals, they still had a shot until Klay went down."
"And Klay Thompson. And Kevin Durant. And defensive monster, Draymond Green.   Silly narrative"
"People don’t hate them for that, they hate them because in order to continue winning chips, they needed Harrison Barnes to not be absolute shit and instead they added Kevin Durant. That’s why people hate the Warriors"
Might have forced Kevin Durant to sign elsewhere and opened up a big lawsuit but I don't think he would have done anything with this trade
"You know what also makes him Kevin Durant? His ability to finish to the rim, and his athleticism. Without that he's just an elite spot-up shooter."
He’s still going to be a near 7-footer that can shoot from anywhere over anyone. That’s what makes him Kevin Durant. That’s not changing.
"&gt; Idk if they can afford for both KD’s to take the years off  They'll be fine even with both KD and Durant resting, Kevin would still dominate for the Warriors."
"Hayward is also not even close to the player Kevin Durant is, I could see Kyrie and KD getting along together too because of how fragile their egos are lol"
"Here's the article I was talking about  &gt; The funny thing is, despite the obvious body transformations, Cousins' weight never wavered in his team's official media guides over the years. His weight was listed at exactly 270 pounds for every season -- in Sacramento, in New Orleans and now, in Golden State. Hardly anyone around the league believes that to be an accurate figure. Just like his teammate Kevin Durant's height of 6-foot-9.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/weight-see-boogie-cousins-conundrum-182920509.html  You can find other similar ones by searching for something like ""Kevin Durant height 7 foot"".  I don't think there are any rules that say that the data teams publish has to be correct. Add to that a combination of vanity, laziness, and gamesmanship."
"\&gt; But he was the most important player in a series that decided a championship victory.      Extremely arbitrary award decided by 11 voters...and he was no where near the best player on his team lol. Your claim is that he was the most important player in the series, but that's also false. He was the third most important player in the series, behind Steph and Lebron. Iggy had one all-star in that historically weak conference, and did nothing in those playoffs on the sixers. His finals MVP was also against a Cavs team whose second best player was Delly - they were historically hobbled. He got a finals MVP for guarding Lebron, which really isn't all that impressive considering he was pretty much alone on offense. The East also hasn't always been weak, this year in particular it wasn't as deep, but 3/4 of the best teams in the league were in the East. As well, in 2016 the East wasn't all that bad. Lowry was also an all-nba player and the best player on multiple playoff teams, one that got to the conference finals.  &amp;#x200B;  Iguodala's entire argument for the hall of fame relies on the fact that he got to play with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant. In a vaccum, he's a worse player than Lowry, and it shows in his individual career."
Is this really newsworthy?  &gt; **Post-Achilles Kevin Durant** ***might*** **not be Kevin Durant again**   No shit?
"The NBA has a soft cap, which means that there are certain exceptions that allow teams to exceed the salary cap. That's opposed to a hard cap, which means a team cannot go a penny over, full stop, no exceptions.   The exception that the Warriors would use to re-sign Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is called Bird rights, named after Larry Bird. Having a player's Bird rights means that you can exceed the cap to re-sign him. You get Bird rights if a player is under contract with you for three seasons, or if you trade for a player who has been on the same contract for three seasons (2 with the first team, 1 with you for example)."
"Reggie Jackson, game 3 VS Memphis.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2043152-reggie-jackson-bails-out-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-in-okcs-game-3-win"
"It's just hilarious that the only thing Knicks fans can say right now is ""the Nets aren't popular!!1!"". Guess what, dude? They have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. That's changing quickly, and you've gotta just live with it."
"No it's not, nobody cares about the Nets. Maybe it'll be posted because it's Kevin Durant and a good portion the stuff he says is just bad PR but in general, nobody will care if the Nets don't deliver a championship. That's the difference between the two franchises in New York."
"&gt; SF- Kevin Wayne Durant (If KD changed his number to 40 his new nickname could be WD40)   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;I'm dead. Come on, do it KD."

"&gt; Lmao Knicks fans are so insecure.  I think you're the insecure one here. I've been calm the whole time and you've been kind of a dick calling me insecure, and telling me all I have is baseless opinions and conjecture. Even though we're talking about basketball and there's literally only opinions to discuss. I don't hate the nets and I actually wish them well. They're the little brother franchise. I just wanna make sure you know they're like the Mets, but without the die hard fan base.   &gt;  I said they're going to sell out next season and grow in popularity thanks to winning basketball &amp; two superstars. I'm responding to the idea that the Nets are some dead franchise who are going to sell no tickets next year.  Proof you're the little brother. You could've said all this without mentioning the Knicks and no one wouldve disagreed with you. Like I said, they were last in attendance last year. It would be hard for them NOT to grow in popularity. Rememeber, NYC is the largest market in the world's biggest economy. The fact they weren't selling out games before, despite being the only playoff team, is kind of embarrassing. They should be selling out games.   Look at Dinwiddies Twitter. You guys can't do anything without mentioning that you're better than us. Even your players are insecure.   &gt; KD is not out for next season. You cannot give me a source because the Nets don't provide timelines for injuries and Marks has said they're not ruling him out for the season. Average recovery for an Achilles is 8-9 months so it's possible he's back after the all star break  Okay so here's an article, because I don't usually pull shit out my ass:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/06/14/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-going-miss-next-season/%3foutputType=amp  The article says it's 12 months he will be out. Kerr announced he was gonna be out for next season. We also have Boogie who went down in January with the Pelicans, and played his first game next January with the Warriors.   Even if KD can somehow recover 3-4 months quicker. Why would you do that? It honestly pisses me off that the warriors just did this. This is a hall of fame talent. Let the man heal. Stop rushing him. If you actually let him heal, he will miss next season. If you rush him back, there's a chance he tweaks something and you end up being stuck with 50% of prime Kevin for 4 years on a max."
"&gt; And you’re not contending with two superstars yet, that’s next season.   &gt; This coming season you replaced an all star on a .500 team with a slightly better all star.   &gt; Any casual fan you got in the last couple months is hopping right back off the bandwagon when they realize they are still a sub 50 win team with a very very slim chance of making it out the first round.  &gt; Also, and I hate to say this because I think the “head case” stuff is mostly bullshit, but you underestimate how much people dislike Kyrie.  &gt; This is obviously gonna change. But that doesn’t mean people are converting to nets fans.  These are all opinions, conjecture. Nonsense. And your one fact about last year (attendance) is dead.

"Well, we've seen what happened to Kevin Durant."
"This is only true if your proportions were off, so like thats why kevin durant is so shit at benching, his shoulders are extremely narrow with long arms. Wilt at least had broad shoulders"
Kevin Durant pretty much
You do know that Curry won 2 MVPs and a title without Kevin Durant
"By the amount of KD burner accounts and how he can multi task by being secret agent Durant dropping free basketball shoes to worthy kids while playing professional basketball, we should never doubt the intellegence of Mr. Kevin Durant."
"Lakers, Clippers, Mavericks, Pelicans, and The Warriors. The east shouldn't even be aloud in the Finals. They should be considered their own NIT tournament and serve a post season bann until Kevin Durant is 100% in 2020/2021."
&gt;Kevin Durant is out because of injury?  Yes  &gt;Paul George?  He's up there but not top 10
Kevin Durant is out because of injury? Paul George?
"Why would you think this is Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets, aka the best team in New York. He’s probably busy somewhere drinking Scarlet Johansson’s bath water. Lucky guy. Handsome too"
"  Who were LeBrons amazing teammates from 2016-2018? They were all over the hill shooters with a Kevin love who was a bad fit in the small ball era. Him and Kyrie were the only co-stars.   Durant averaged more points than curry in 5 out of the last 6 postseasons with a slightly worse EFG% due to playing on the worse spacing team in the NBA. Durant is top 3 most unstoppable offensive player in NBA history and he’s the best midrange shooter of all time. Curry isn’t on his level in terms of dynamic scoring. LeBrons a superior scorer as well posting a similar TS% to curry the last 5 post seasons but averaging more points.  Curry more often than not sees the first pass out of the PnR than players Like LBJ and harden who swing the bullet pass to the corner.   Warriors are statistically the best passing and screening team in NBA history. Stephen Curry will absolutely not have the same effect on any other team. I literally just illustrated to you How point guards of other teams Get trapped but don’t have an elite playmaking big to influence their ‘advanced’ metrics.  Just think about this logically, Steph gets trapped from 30 feet off a screen and he gives up the ball to frank kaminsky instead of Draymond green, what will Frank do?  Fumble the ball? Or insert curry into the 2009 Cavs, What’s his use on that roster after getting trapped?   LeBrons offensive versatility, ability, size and playmaking translate to any team in the NBA because he’s the best floor raiser in League history.   In reference to Net rating tweet I linked, there’s a direct correlation between Draymond’s increasing production and warriors historic rise in 2015/2016 and 2017 before they decline in 2018.   I’m not arguing Steph vs Draymond, I’m arguing how Draymond is the guy in the passenger seat in regards to spearheading the warriors historic offense along with curry.  I don’t put much stock in PIPM as I’ve already argued or OBPM without context but if you want to use advanced stats, Curry has the steepest drop in NBA history in augmented Plus/Minus, OBPM (-.7) and  PIPM while Draymond has the highest increase in AUPM and PIPM.   https://youtu.be/BtL_zCF6qgQ  Starts at 2:55.   Draymond is just as vital to the warriors Offensive system due to unique traits, just as curry is.  Without him, the team doesn’t hit historic heights and it’s no coincidence that his increase in production in 2016 (top 7 in MVP voting coincided with Steph’s best year).   LeBron‘s offensive production and playmaking  isn’t predicated on a complimentary player of draymond greens caliber"
"Knicks havent made the playoffs in 6 years Nets made it this past year, HOUSE MONEY theyre already so far ahead with Kyrie this season and I hear in the 2020 season theyre picking up this former MVP Kevin Durant. The results are basically replacing Russell with Kyrie and Adding durant to a playoff Calibre team its easily the better option."
"I went to a private HS in the DC area. While I was there I saw them play Dematha with Joe Forte and Keith Bogans, then a few years after I graduated I went and saw them play the Montrose Christian team with Kevin Durant and Greivis Vasquez. It just wasn't fair."
"Kevin Durant was a big reason they were so dominant. Now you don’t have him, Iggy, or Boogie. And you’re depending on Klay to get back to 100% after an ACL tear. Let’s be honest, the Warriors got worse and they’re older now in age. They’re no longer the West favorites."
"MJ was never skinny. Skinny is Tayshaun Prince or Kevin Durant. MJ was lean, but still very strong.   Young MJ only weighed like 195-200 pounds his rookie season.   He never liked weight training cause he felt it could have a negative effect on his game.   Up until the physical punishment he took from the bad boy pistons made him change his mind.   He gradually put on mass and was pretty bulky by like 95/96.   It didn't work for him to be so big, so he leaned out a little bit for the 96/97 season and showed more quickness than the previous season."
"&gt;Politicians almost certainly take money under the table from lobbyists and corporations but that can’t be proven with certainty. Would you demand evidence of that too?  That's not a valid comparison because that's actually legal (a stupid law, but legal). Ever since the Citizens United ruling especially. They don't need to take money under the table, they just take money straight up and nobody can do anything about it.   Technically PEDs and steroids are illegal substances, and plenty of sports leagues have cracked down on players for using PEDs (notably the MLB and Olympics).   &gt;We aren’t talking about what can be definitively proven, we’re talking about what is the most likely.  No we are not. You just accused Kevin ""can't bench 185 lbs"" Durant of juicing, based on the loose premise of motive.   You have also acted like a condascending douche, even though you have completely misunderstood everything I've said and made false equivalencies."
"Lol man your reading comprehension skills are seriously lacking.   I asked for evidence specifically that Kevin Durant and Steph Curry use PEDs.  Somehow you equated that to saying there is no incentive to do PEDs.   Your literacy is weak lol. Seriously, who taught you how to read  ?"
This is an idiotic take. Rj gonna make people forget about Kevin Durant? In what universe?  The Nets have barely been in BK for 7 years. KD and Kyrie will easily bump the market up dramatically
"Pretty sure when you’re Kevin Durant, shoe company gives zero fucks where you play."
As opposed to no Kevin Durant in a best of 3. Let’s not act like rockets weren’t favorites after kd went down
4.5 games of Kevin Durant and 1 game of Klay Thompson
"lol Kevin Durant used to wax poetically about retiring in OKC.   We're not even a year removed from Kyrie Irving saying he'd love to be back in Boston if they'd have him.  It looks unlikely that Giannis would leave, but it wouldn't be unfathomable."
"From The Athletic:  &gt; The Knicks have not addressed any of their free-agent signings, but a person with knowledge of the situation said Knicks president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry, desperate after losing out to the Nets on Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, saw the acquisition of Morris as a small victory.  &gt; That it was the Spurs who lost made it extra special for the Knicks, who privately suspected San Antonio, with deep ties in Europe, may have made illegal contact with Kristaps Porzingis while he was still with the Knicks.  &gt; Tampering is as difficult to prove as poaching a player who reportedly has a verbal agreement with another organization. What we do know is that the two games between the Knicks and Spurs next season should be rather interesting."
"a lot of podcast and analysts on TV and Radio say Giannis has a different personality than Lebron, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Shaq....etc.."
&gt; And I'd imagine Steph shot a shit load more catch and shoot 3's than Harden  Yes because he played with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.   Nothing you're citing to prove steph is better accounts for the benefits he receives by playing with those two.
"Well, it's a very specific kind of injury where the opposing team ends up having Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green."
"At the NFL combine they have the guys do burnouts on bench at 225lbs.  I'm a pretty average guy and can fairly easily do 225.  At the NBA combine, they do the same but with 185lbs instead.  At ~6'9"", 240, Kevin Durant couldn't lift the bar a single time.   Yet dude can back down any defender in the world.  Yeah, I know he's lanky, but my point is bench press doesn't necessarily translate well to basketball."
"Not saying you’re wrong, but do you have a statistic to back this up? I will concede that Klays usage goes down with KD, but that’s because it’s Kevin Freaking Durant. He should get shots lol"
Lakers had arguably the worst spacing in the league last year. Bron still averaged 27.5 in just 35 minutes a game. That is not struggling. Kevin Durant posts about the same numbers in his prime now as LeBron did last year at age 34.
"The late 2010s are fairly recent but from a historical perspective the Warriors were a jump shooting team lead by point guard Stephen Curry and won a title in 2015. After capping off a historic 73 win season by losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a historic 3-1 comeback in 2016, they added former MVP Kevin Durant and proceeded to win titles in 2017 and 2018. This past year they were the favorites to win, but unfortunately suffered major injuries to their starting lineup and lost in 6 to the Toronto Raptors."
"Yeah, but DJ is best friends with Kevin Durant."
"Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi, Ray Allen"
Poor Kevin durant. He had to face double teams.     You realize kobe was getting doubled and tripled while he had teams with good.shooters???    It's just what stars have to deal with.
Westbrook got Paul George as a replacement for Kevin Durant...  Portland Trail Blazers didn't had Nurkic and were forced to replace him with Enes Kanter who played through a shoulder injury while fasting. And they still gentleman swept OKC who were the favorites. Utah Jazz took full advantage of how bad Westbrook &amp; Paul George were.
Kevin Durant way outside...DELIVERS!  I thought it wasn't as big of a shot in the grand scheme but man that call is great.
^and ^klay ^^and ^^kevin ^^durant
Type in Kevin Durant height and it says 6’9 and it’s his listed height. I’m not saying random shit. Calm down bro. Getting hype over bullshit for no reason lol
Lol well glad my hatred for Kevin Durant could be useful
Then I will say “fuck Kevin Durant until the end of time”

Okay fine.    I predict Kevin Durant will be a top 5 player next year even though he misses a bunch of games.
Logic named Kevin Durant in 44 more at the end. The song has big numbers.

"I don't believe this is entirely true. We hold Horford's rights and don't have to have him re-sign until after a deal is done to get Kemba (e.g. the s&amp;t we already executed to get him). So long as he committed to re-sign then we could have pursued other options and figured out a way to make it work.  We'd clearly moved on from Kyrie some time ago if what Danny's said is to be believed, so Kemba's name certainly had to be on a proverbial board somewhere in the office.   The bottom line is this: The tampering with Al Horford and the lack of reprisal for doing so is quite clearly what instigated the tampering with Kemba Walker. In the past few years the free agents the celtics have signed have always been after having taken meetings with us *after* Free Agency had started. Al Horford, Kevin Durant &amp; Gordon Hayward all took meetings here on or after July 1. Clearly their playbook changed because the rules weren't being enforced. I'm not sure how that's so hard to wrap your head around."

"People are going to say Shaq as the obvious answer but I’m going to say Kevin Durant.   KD can score from anywhere, literally whenever and is a solid 7’0” and has a high release point."
Definitely Kevin Durant
Serious question for OP; Is Kevin Durant a better player than Prime Shaquille O’Neal ever was?  Please explain.
Because Curry was the leading scorer of the finals not Kawhi.  Klay is not better than Kawhi Klay outplayed Kawhi in the finals.  Kevin Durant in the 11 minutes he played also OUTPLAYED Kawhi.
"I think it wasn’t even the “bitch” as much as “we don’t need you, we won without you”.  Kevin Durant was without a doubt the biggest reason why the Warriors won in 2017.  Not only that, Draymond was the guy who called KD in the parking lot after the 2016 finals to recruit him.  Like....how does one do a complete 180 the way Dray did and expect the other person to be okay with what you said? He’s a hypocritical cunt."
"Idk if maybe you're a new fan or if you just don't have great memory, but he was definitely in top 10 at certain points I'd say top 5. As for superstar. You said    [Proof 1](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/05/mvp-ladder-2017-18-week-12-bradley-beal-development-kevin-durant-rises)   [Proof 2](https://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/26/mvp-ladder-2017-18-week-15-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-city-thunder-reemerges)   [Proof 3](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/12/22/mvp-ladder-week-10-christmas-day-mvp-candidates)   [Proof 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfEeSTdQXWc)   &gt; So if that’s true, how can you say boogie is definitively a superstar when he’s never done so.   I don't have a history of helping 3rd graders win postseason games to know I would impact winning against 3rd graders in the postseason lmfao. If you're a great at this game of basketball, you're great at basketball."
"I don’t think Kawhi is close, or will ever be close. Kevin Durant is MILES better in every aspect of the game. Including winning championships."
"Harden decided to trade Harden  “As Wojnarowski reported, Oklahoma City offered Harden a four-year extension ""that would have paid him a base salary of $53 million to $54 million,"" making it at least $6 million shy of the $60 million max.  But that wasn't good enough for Harden. He's a budding young superstar and undoubtedly believed it was time he got paid like one, even after teammates and self-proclaimed ""family"" members Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka and Russell Westbrook made some sort of sacrifice to stay in Oklahoma City.”  -Bleacher Report  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1389202-why-kendrick-perkins-contract-forced-okc-thunder-to-trade-james-harden"
"I mean you guys had Russell Westbrook Kevin Durant *and* James Harden along with Ibaka and other solid bench players. You made 3 conference finals and one finals in which you won 1 game. All of this in the 8 or so seasons since you drafted KD.  Don't respond with the ""but injuries"" argument. Every team suffers injuries over more than 1 or 2 seasons. The Heat *could* have been champs in '05 but for Wades injuries. We *could* have competed in '07 but for Wade and Shaq's injuries.  You guys had several great drafted players and failed to do win even 1 championship with them. Don't you dare criticize a franchise that has won 3."
"**Tier One:**  Michael Jordan  LeBron James  **Tier Two:**  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  **Tier Three:**  Shaquille O’Neal  Bill Russell  Wilt Chamberlain  Tim Duncan   Hakeem Olajuwon  Kobe Bryant  **Tier Four:**  Dirk Nowitzki   Moses Malone  Julius Erving   Kevin Durant  Steph Curry, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone in some order next  Charles Barkley, Dwyane Wade, Isiah Thomas, David Robinson, James Harden in some order after that  Most controversial is probably the Sixers guys. Moses is a bit forgotten I think because he moved around quite a bit so he doesn’t really have that one dedicated fan base that will argue for him. Dr J. probably shouldn’t be on this list anymore (as time has moved on and more guys would knock him down) if it is strictly top 15 NBA and while I’m not completely counting the ABA career, it’s not nothing to me either."
"First of all, LeBron isn't as good as a culture settler as them because LeBron's name has more magnitude than the team. When you have LeBron, its no longer the Cavs or the Lakers, its all about LeBron, not the team.  Kevin Durant said it best when he said he doesn't want to play with LeBron because he's the face of the NBA and that entails high expectations. When LeBron's team doesn't reach the expectations, the media, as well as LeBron fans (which is quite a large fanbase) is quick to blame his teammates. Its not a very safe environment around LeBron because if you don't fit, LeGM can come and trade your ass.   Unlike Curry or Duncan, expectations are there but its not that high, plus they're blessed with better management and coaching making their image much more pleasing because frankly, they win at a more efficient rate then LeBron ever did. When you win more championships, the more immune you are to criticism."
"This would make slightly more sense if OKC hadn't offered Westbrook a supermax, and if he hadn't signed it. Just like the offered one to Durant. Unless you mean Kevin Love, who signed one in Cleveland.   Nothing like a Lakers fan being a dick to small markets."
You smokin crack if it's anybody but Kevin Fuckin Durant
I think it's Kevin Durant
"I think the thing is, being a complete scorer isn’t as useful as people think it is. Sometimes people say that melo is the better scorer than lebron because he has larger repertoire of moves, but in reality lebron scores the ball more. Lebron will just barrel down to the basket and score, and it works so well, he doesn’t need the breadth of techniques to score. Like think about Kareem, just shoot a sky hook score two points, boom done. Kevin Durant, shoot over the smaller player, boom, done. Steph, get literally any separation, and shoot the ball from literally any place on court.  Now all these guys are extremely skilled, technical, and versatile, but they’re main scoring comes from having one or two moves that they can abuse over and over again. Melo is a great scorer and great player for that matter, but I don’t feel like he was ever able to completely bend defenses in the way that some other players could, and he just never reached the same efficiency as the great scorers of the generation because of it."
"Hakeem, Kobe, Lebron, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson, etc...."
Kevin Durant is a better playoff performer than Kawhi
"Uhhh... what about Kevin Durant, shit head lol? You know, one of the best scorers of all time.   You're sitting here comparing Russell Westbrook to KG, when Westbrook had Durant who has already surpassed both of them on the GOAT list."

Kevin Knox would put up Durant rookie numbers
Kevin Durant was consistently putting up great numbers through the playoffs and playing great defense as well. If you think they were on the same level this playoffs youre insaneeeeeeeee

Kevin Durant is gonna fall off a cliff
"I watched all of the games.  Harden was putting up basically the same numbers as Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant was and everyone was fawning over how well he was playing before he got hurt."
"So does Kevin Durant, but that doesn't put him in the conversation."

"No but it does sound like Katie... and the only sports name that comes to mind loosely is Katie Nolan.  Is Kevin Durant Katie Nolan?  Guys, what are we doing?"
"Everything after the top 4 is always rearranged at some point for me, the general players stay the same.  Jordan  Bron  Kareem  Magic  Shaq  Duncan  Kobe  Bill Russell  Bird  Wilt  Hakeem  Jerry West  Moses Malone  Kevin Durant  Dr J  The most controversial thing in here would be Hakeem not being top ten. Like I said, it changes nearly every time I make another ranking, and he’s absolutely a top 10 level guy, there’s just a lot of names there. If you’re someone who believes that KD’s championships don’t carry any worth then he will also be a controversial inclusion."
Kevin durant would have 8 finals in a row too in the weak ass east. Both tier 1. Kawhi too.  Not sure if Curry is tier 1 sometimes.. he doesnt impact defense enough even though he tries. Offensively he can fizzle out a bit in the clutch too.
"&gt; You are missing the point, I'm saying they are low dexterity players. Also post moves don't require much dexterity when you are that big and strong  I demonstrated their high dexterity by way of video clips. You say post-moves don't require much dexterity yet the best players in the game are the only ones that can master post-moves to elevate their e.g. Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant who are very dexterious players. Can you name a player with post-moves who isn't dexterious and only big and strong?  &gt; Lmao no he wouldn't, he would be a below average college guard at 5'11"" with the same agility and shooting  He can dribble, shoot, pass, and play defense. How many guards in the NBA can do all of those?"
"So in other words,  The Grizzlies were expected to be a losing team, and the Grizzlies had a reputation as the worst NBA team in history at that point in time, and they go from an expected 30 wins to 50 wins; coached by the oldest coach in NBA history who had been doing color commentary a year and a half earlier.   But Sloan took a crapola roster to 42 wins. A roster that no longer had older Karl Malone &amp; John Stockton who has the worst numbers of their career since their early seasons. But they had AK. And good players who could run Sloan’s system. They won 5 fewer games. A healthy Matt Harpering, Raja Bell, and Arroyo were good NBA quality players. They didn’t have stars but they had NBA players.  So I just don’t get why this is even a debate. Especially when Jazz fans (and a raptors fan) want to crap on what Hubie Brown did as if it was expected. I remember the shock and excitement in Memphis that season.   I think Lionel Hollins was cheated out of the COY in the 2009-10 season. The Grizz were expected to be crap. They won 24 games the season before and Hollins was seen as a joke by much of the local media. They added “black hole” and “cancer” Zach Randolph and an old, grumpy Allen Iverson to the team. It was supposed to be a shit show. But they competed for a playoff spot until almost the end of the season. Won 40 games. But Scott Brooks took an OKC team that had Kevin Durant (in season 3), Russell Westbrook, and James Harden to 50 wins when they had won 23 games the prior year."
"Danuel ""Kevin Durant"" House is going to have to step up at SF"
“How do you get 12 assists after you leave the team with Kevin Durant?”   “Russell Westbrook”
"so let’s make this clear, you know more about guarding Carmelo Anthony than Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Paul Pierce And Kobe Bryant? That literally what you are saying. Delusional."
Kobe Bryant: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Paul Pierce: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Kevin Durant: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  Lebron James: “Melo was the hardest player to guard” u/samueladams6: “but look at the stats!!!!”  &gt; I don’t care about the subjective opinions of players   hahahaha yeah what would they know? you going through bref must mean you know so much more than *the players who actually had to guard him*
"If you were trying to pitch a free agent with a new front office and owner like that would you make an absurd joke like that mixed in with the jersey retirement ceremony and all that and hope he gets the humor of it all, and doesn't think that either they're making fun of him or not taking the whole thing seriously? Remember that prior to this Blake was threatening to sign with Phoenix for the max, and that Ballmer reportedly broke down crying in the free agency pitch to Kevin Durant. I'm not sure if we should give them the benefit of the doubt on that."
"You said the past 3 seasons whys that the cuffoff date. Oh i know why Steph Curry. Who had to take the backseat to kevin durant. And riddle me this stat person. No KD , a healthy rockets team down 3-2 on their own homecourt and harden cant close the deal. All those fancy stats you listed get thrown out the window.  And kawhi owns harden  https://youtu.be/AECuWJBq2CU"
1) Kevin Durant  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) LeBron James 4) Stephen Curry  5) James Harden  6) Giannis Antetokounmpo 7) Anthony Davis  8) Paul George 9) Joel Embiid 10) Damian Lillard 11) Kyrie Irving 12) Nikola Jokiv 13) Russel Westbrook 14) Jimmy Butler  15) Klay Thompson
&gt; Hardens play style doesn’t work in the playoffs.  This is just so ignorant lmfao. The Rockets have made the WCF twice with Harden leading them and have been the only team to really threaten the Warriors since Kevin Durant joined them.
And the Clippers have a great front office.  That still doesn't put them on the level of a 73-9 team who added prime Kevin Durant and went to 5 straight Finals.
I’ll add that to the list right next to Go Your “Own Way/Kevin Durant” and “Immigrant Song/Giannis”
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul."
"Kevin Durant, but mostly because of opportunity. Steph could have easily been the best if the ball was in his hands more, but KD has more exploitable match ups than Steph."
"I don't really get the point you're trying to make here my guy, yeah they had Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook and James Harden, but what do they have to show for it? Some good times? They were a fun team for the whole decade but they're about to have a real bad time for a few seasons while we slide back into the same spot we were before, and we're doing it with a championship and a magical playoff run"
Klay faced *with the help of Steph Curry Draymond green and Kevin Durant* lol you’re making it seem like he took them on on his own
"Lets take a real good look at Kobe in the Playoffs.  5 time champion, 2x MVP, went to 7 Finals in 11 years. Has an absurd amount of playoff wins against 50 win teams, Jordan and LeBron don't even come close. In 08-10 when Kobe went to 3 straight Finals, the total SRS of all the teams those 3 years was greater than the combined SRS of all the teams LeBron faced in his 8 straight Finals.  Kobe is the only player in NBA history to have scored 600 points in 3 straight postseasons.  Kobe is one of FEW players whose numbers do not dip in the postseason. Sure there are some series where he doesn't play well and there are other series where he plays great, but for entire postseasons, Kobe's efficiency and proficiency numbers are remarkably consistent from regular season to postseason. The only full postseason, starting from 1999-2013, where he was considerably worse in the playoffs was 2011, coming off 3 straight Finals and dealing with many injuries.  Kevin Durant, pre-GSW years had magnificent efficiency drops, James Harden, Westbrook, even LeBron had a few years where there were noticeable declines in efficiency/proficiency.  No, Kobe hasn't had the greatest Finals series, but the Finals aren't the only playoff series, and guess what, he's won 5 out of fucking 7 so that's pretty damn good. He hasn't had the best game 7's, and he's still won every single one of them except the one in 2006.  Every superstar has some bad moments in clutch moments, every superstar has had great moments in the playoffs. But when you beat strong team after strong team in the postseason, when your peers look to you as the clutch option, don't fucking tell me that his clutch reputation isn't purely off marketing.  A superstar who isn't clutch doesn't go to 7 Finals in 11 years, win 5 titles, and routinely dominates other great playoff teams. Imagine being the person thinking you can go ahead and bet against Kobe having a good playoff game just because some numbers look bad."
"Every team that has ever played in the finals has dealt with nagging injuries. It is undisputedly different from when an all-star, HoF caliber player misses the entire series due to injury. Warriors had massive problems with niggling injuries in 2016, most notably Curry. That is night and day different from the Cavs not having Kyrie (after game 1) or Love at all during the 2015 finals. Kawhi was very clearly carrying an injury all year and was limping during the playoffs, as were other raptors. This is night and day different from Kevin Durant missing the whole series except for 12 minutes and Klay missing game 3 and going down for good in game 6."
Never...  2015: LeBron James  2016: LeBron James  2017: Kevin Durant  2018: LeBron James  2019: Kawhi Leonard
"It's not *hate*, it's the ""I had to work harder to end up in the same place"" belief, which is undoubtedly *true*.  Kevin Love, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Andrew Wiggins - they had professional basketball players guiding their careers from the time they were young kids.  Wade's mom did heroin in front of him.  LeBron's mom de facto gave custody of him to another family bc she couldn't take care of them.  Durant, you know his story from his MVP speech.  But his mom struggled to put food on the table for them.  They all obviously deserve to be in the NBA (even Wiggins).  You get there on skill and talent and ability.  But guys like LeBron/Wade/KD aren't wrong to believe that they had a tougher time.  And of *course* they don't want their kids to go through the worst experiences of their lives. Of course they want their kids to have it easy.  Every parent does.  But that doesn't mean they don't believe they have an extra level of emotional strength bc they survived a really tough childhood."
"Those three still missed 33 combined games last year, and our bench was a mess.  Maybe it is slightly above average, I’m not gonna do the exact calculations, but it’s absolutely not unusual at all. The Celtics missed 81 games of Hayward alone a couple years ago. Kevin Love’s missed 105 games for the Cavs in the last three years. Everybody knows about the Pelicans’ issues. The Pacers missed 46 games of Oladipo last year and are due to miss more of him this year. The entire Lob City Clippers era was marred by injuries to Griffin and CP3, and Griffin ended this season injured with Detroit as well while CP3 missed 48 games and the end of a conference finals series in his two years with the Rockets. OKC lost Westbrook and Durant for a ton of time during their 2012-2016 run. Kawhi’s missed 90+ games over the last two years. Even the garbage Nets teams of a few years ago lost Jeremy Lin for 120+ games over his last two years there. And on and on it goes.  The Hornets aren’t special."
"Jesus. Who's talking about that? The claim is that Kevin Durant, several weeks removed from major reconstructive surgery on his leg, probably isn't good on his feet right now. Are you trying to miss the point?"
"The Kevin Durant podcast with him was awesome, honestly, and everyone should peep it.  Definitely a really interesting look into how great basketball players think, and how they talk amongst themselves."
"I feel like today’s nba you need a great wing player that plays both sides, like a jimmy butler or a Kevin Durant to be successful, someone who can carry the load"
"Again, i mentioned that paul provides spacing and defense, so while theyre both ball dominant they function much better than harden and westbrook.  Westbrook doesnt bring defense or spacing. Isolation heavy offense isnt worse than motion based offense if you have the pieces in place which the rockets and cavs in 2016 did have. but you need 2 elite iso scorers (paul, harden and lebron, kyrie), and the rest of your team has to be great 3 + d players which houston and cavs both had. At the same time those teams were relative rarities in the modern nba, and one of them had lebron playing out of his mind as well as kyrie, and the other had harden playing like one of the best scorers ever and cp3 still with juice in his legs. Also that houston series against golden state ultimately came down to defense, houston almost pulled it off because their defense was successfully slowing down GS. Their offense was relatively pedestrian that series.   You mention westbrook and durant, but durant is an extremely scalable player. His time on golden state proved that he can elevate an already great team with his defense, decent passing, and elite spacing. Hes not an extremely ball dominant player, tho he was at times in okc's iso oriented offense. So durant and westbrook isnt a great example because durant provides the relief to westbrook.    I'm not sure if you're mistaking me saying that iso play is inherently unscalable, rather im saying spacing is scalable and ball dominance is typically less scalable. Also that defense is scalable skill. I think its a mistake to not look at scalability at all, any championship winning team needs to have multiple elite players to win. A player like giannis and to an extent lebron needs to be with other stars who can still provide value next to their ball dominance and relative weaknesses.   Most championship teams have synergies amongst their best players that make them work. The boston big 3 fit pretty well together in terms of their skillset, kobe and pau worked very well together and the triangle offense for the lakers allowed others to provide value. Golden state is an obvious example, 2014 spurs and their other chips, 2011 mavs, 2004 pistons, the bulls championship teams. The heat is probably the best example of a team that did not fit that great together but managed to still get by on sheer talent and their stars being nimble enough to make it work.   I think the 2015-2017 cavs are a good example of a team that adding a bunch of talent together without considering scalability can not be great. Cavs were always plagued by their defense, because Kevin love unlike chris bosh could not provide value there. Kyrie irving similarly did not provide value there. Unlike wade and bosh, these two could not adapt their games to fit next to lebron, and the team ultimately underperformed the sum of their parts."
"I'm talking about the versions of players that existed on the team while Lebron was there. After that first year, Wade was a top 10 player. What is so difficult to understand about that? So they had a top 10 in Wade, a top 15-20 in Bosh, and a Ray Allen that was 37 years old (he didnt even join until 2012-13)  You keep going on and on about Lebron. Half your post is just opinionated crap about Lebron wanting Melo/being an opportunist, etc. It sounds like you have a lot of deeply rooted hate for the guy. Lebron joined up with Wade and Bosh to form a superteam. I don't deny that. Nobody does. The difference is Kevin Durant JOINED a superteam that had already existed, had the best regular season record OF ALL TIME, and had already won a chip. Imagine MJ leaving the Bulls and joining the Pistons. Or Magic Johnson leaving LA and joining Boston. He joined up for free wins in an attempt to get the recognition he thought he deserved, and to show that he could ""beat"" Lebron. Not surprisingly, he still doesn't get that recognition and will forever have an asterisk next to his titles. Hell, even HE has admitted to knowing this is how people view him.   We are absolutely not talking about the players before they joined together to form a superteam. How does that even make sense? We are talking about the players skill levels while they played together on said superteams.   Klay in undoubtedly more valuable to a team than Jimmy has ever been in his career. The wins speak for themsevles, even pre KD.   Derozen averaged like 24 points shooting 45% from 2 and piss poor defense. The guy was not a winner then and has never been a winner. Again, Klay was more valuable back then and infinitely more valuable today.   News Flash: Teams are designed and built around key players. Stating that a player wouldn't be as good on another team is just anecdotal bullshit. Yeah, maybe Mike wouldn't have been as great on another team. Maybe Ben Wallace wouldn't have been as great on another team. Maybe Tim Duncan and the spurs core wouldnt have been as great on another team. Maybe Magic and Bird wouldn't have been as great on other teams. All players have weaknesses. That's why teams are designed to cover their weaknesses.   So basically you only want to consider Miami in 2010-2011, while ignoring the majority of the time those players spent together in order to fit your narrative. You should obviously be considering the entire time the superteams remained intact. So basically we have:  Best player Lebron, one year of prime wade then top 10, and a top 15-20 player in Bosh plus 37 year old Ray Allen (that didnt join until 2013, so there goes your 2011 window). Then you have 2016-2019 second best player KD, top 3 player in Curry, top 15 and best SG in the league (and one of the greatest of all time in that position) in Klay, and a multi time all-defensive team and a DPOY in all-star Draymond Green.   I see you've finally figured out your ""greater than"" and ""less than"" signs. I find it funny how you have to specify the exact years for every player to fit your narrative, as if it makes any sense at all to do that haha. We aren't talking about the years each team was formed, we are talking about their relative skill levels throughout the existence of each superteam. Again, you're trying to twist the facts to fit your narrative. We are considering miami 2010/11-2014, and GS from 2016/2017 - 2018/2019.  Seems fairly even, aside from the fact that Lebron FORMED a superteam and KD JOINED a superteam (again, best regular season team of all time, and already won a chip) that existed before he came along.

Bryan Oringer / Kevin Durant Twitter feud. Sure to produce high quality conversation
a lotta people in that twitter thread thinking they know how to practice better than kevin fucking durant
One is a dear dear friend of Kevin Durant and the other is Stephen A Smith
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Steph Curry, Giannis A., Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, Bradley Beal &amp; Kemba Walker"
"The Seattle SuperSonics have exactly zero playoff wins with Kevin Durant.  However, if you're just using this post as an excuse to rub in the fact that the Knicks went all in on getting KD this summer and whiffed, then carry on."
What about the kids who tell the teacher that there is homework? D'Angelo Russel and Kevin Durant should absolutely be in that category.
Kevin Durant would be Randall from Recess overhearing everyone and ready to snitch on his burner account
"Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis: 3 Elite Two Way Players But Don't Elevate a Team Quite Like LeBron and Steph Due to Their Playmaking/Leadership Deficiencies."
"To be fair, part of the reason it’s difficult to discuss the Harden trade is because most trade supporters are extremely passionate Thunder fans who will defend their franchise to the bitter end. And that’s okay - nothing wrong about supporting the hometown team. But from the outside looking in, I think the trade was clearly an absolute disaster.   Sure, you’re right that Harden didn’t guarantee a championship. But he guaranteed a whole hell of a lot more than Jeremy Lamb and one year of Kevin Martin. He guaranteed a floor that most teams in the league could not match. He guaranteed that if one all-star goes down, you will still have two all-stars to play. He guaranteed a ceiling of a potential decade long dynasty. He guaranteed a connection with two other all-stars which might have been enough to keep those 3 all-stars on the same team for a significant duration of their careers, despite that team being located in a small, rural market that will always have difficulty attracting any free agents.   One of the issues I’ve always had with the trade is Kevin Martins contract. Imo, OKC’s failure to keep Martin despite trading James Harden for him is clear evidence that the franchise was pinching pennies. I feel bad for the fans that the owner and/or front office was so short sighted as to trade away James Harden to save a few million bucks up-front.   Also, I’m going to try to guess as many players as possible from that 2012/2013 team just for the hell of it. Double pinky promise that I haven’t looked lol - Westbrook, Perkins, Durant, Martin, Ibaka, Collision, Lamb, Adams, Jackson, Thabo, my man Perry Jones (legitimately thought he would be an all-star), Thabeet, and I think Derick Fisher and Caron Butler at the end of the season."
The Warriors are(were) better without kevin Durant
"Damn this makes me think: the Warriors really came out of nowhere. From 2012-2014 the Thunder ran the east. Kevin Durant was undisputed king of the west, Russ was a top 3 point guard. Warriors in this time period are seen as a gimmicky three-point shooting team, and curry is just this up and coming ""kid."" Okc and clippers both got the better of the warriors. Then just 2 years later, the warriors start destroying the west and convince kd to sign with him."
"Should have injured lebron for a year, gotten a lottery pick, and drafted Kevin Durant or Derrick Rose."
"""Im just a good Christian husband here at the game with family joking around with Kevin Durant and all of a sudden he's swearing at me..."""
"But they have Kevin Durant, and that is the ultimate prize."
What the fuck does that even mean? Kevin Durant shot a lower % than Rajon Rondo from 3 last year. That literally means nothing. Dlo is just as inconsistent and hasn’t proved himself in the playoffs( 19 ppg on 44 TS% in this years playoffs).
Westbrook was 2nd team all-nba. Wade was 3rd team. Harden was the 6th man of the year. Bosh didn't make any all-nba teams.  Ibaka was 1st team all-defense and led the league in rebounding. Scott Brooks COTY Kevin Durant NBA's leading scorer. They were stacked just like the Heat.
"Awww shucks we only get Kevin Durant, Jeff Green, and other assets."
Looking at the old footages of the NBA it looks the players are lean. It looks like a bunch of Kevin Durant out there.
Chick would be the best star in the social media age.  Much better than Kevin “but they’re mean to me!” Durant
"* Joe Ingles and the ""look-off"" lay-up. * Kevin Durant and the shoulder shimmy  * Eric Gordon is best at staying square and balanced while shooting * Karl Anthony-Towns at making shots where you say, ""Pshh, that's a miss...oh shit!"" * Jokic at shrugging with his entire body when called for a foul. He could be a really good mime. * JJ Redick at shooting from distance against his body's momentum going the opposite direction"
So Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant didn’t win 4 straight scoring titles, he won 3 straight and then another one 2 years later."
"Kevin Durant for leaving. He was the one who made OKC a top team. Westbrook ""Revenge Tour"", when he played the best ball of his career, only got them to a 6 seed."
Can someone please show this video to Kevin Durant?
"He was against one of the best teams ever assembled with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green on it in his first playoff series."

[Ok bro.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/warriors-andre-iguodala-explains-why-kevin-durant-most-talented-scorer-all-time)   [If you say so.](https://www.skysports.com/nba/news/36226/11704746/kevin-durant-is-the-ultimate-weapon-says-golden-state-warriors-head-coach-steve-kerr)   [Because I imagine they just recruiting right](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/25/klay-thompson-on-kevin-durant-hes-the-best-scorer-in-the-world/)  &gt;And Curry dominates his opponents so badly that he often doesn't need to play the fourth quarter. That's why you have to look at points per minute or possession. Efficiency is also important.  The year he started blowing out opponents is 2016. That's it. And where his only scoring title came from, and he still played 33 minutes per game that season.   &gt;BAHAHAHA!! This is a joke! Curry is legendary for his gravity and the defensive attention he gets! It's like trying to argue that he isn't a good shooter!!!!!  Dude are you fucking retarded? Do you have a syndrome? I just explained this pattern to you. LAC's best defender is Pat Bev. He guarded Durant. HOU's best defender is PJ. He guarded Durant. TOR's best defender is Kawhi. He guarded Durant. See where this goes or do I have to explain it *one* more time?  &gt;BAHAHAHA!! This is a joke! Curry is legendary for his gravity and the defensive attention he gets! It's like trying to argue that he isn't a good shooter!!!!!  Ah, here comes the good ol' gravity argument, I knew this one was coming, shoulda pulled it out the bag sooner. Curry's gravity is OP dude idk what to say maybe he the best player to ever live, shame he ain't win a FMVP that way.  &gt;BAHAHAHA!! This is a joke! Curry is legendary for his gravity and the defensive attention he gets! It's like trying to argue that he isn't a good shooter!!!!!  Nobody plays defence in the ASG so no, I can tell they weren't tryharding. Curry didn't even get doubled once KD was playing this playoffs, KD was the one getting doubled and tripled by Pat Bev, J Green, Montrezl, then in Houston with PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon. So no.   A question. Do you actually think Curry is a better player than KD and where do you have both in the top spots in the league?"
"He deserves a spot in the Warriors' hall of fame alongside Steph Curry, Wilt Chamberlain, Nate Thurmond, Chris Mullin, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Baron Davis, Jason Richardson, Andre Iguodala, Steve Kerr, Al Attles, Tom Meschery, Don Nelson, Jamaal Wilkes, Sleepy Floyd, Zaza Pachulia's foot, the Toaster that Klay signed, JR Smith, the Trash Can that Dirk Nowitzki threw at Oracle, and the Whiteboard that LeBron punched."
He would be the best player in the NBA today.     He would be essentially a better rebounding passing and defending Kevin Durant minus the iso ability.

"Because he knows how to let his best players shoot the ball? Time and time again Russ has shown that he can't play winning basketball in the playoffs. In the 2012 Finals KD was killing the Heat and Russ was shooting like garbage yet he attempted more shots over the series than Kevin fucking Durant. If Jason Kidd had been playing for the Thunder instead of Russ there's a good chance they win that series.  Hero ball when you're a terribly inefficient scorer is the opposite of what you want, and the fact that Kidd knew that makes him better."
Kevin Durant and Shaq are the most unstoppable scorers ever
Steph had KEVIN DURANT also

"I'm not even refuting that, can we stay on track here and not let our biases derail the conversation?  The initial comment in this chain is about *playoff success*. That is *heavily* dependent on the competency of the organization, coaching staff, supporting cast, etc. For 2017-2019 especially, Steph had a *huge* advantage when it comes to playiff success; Kevin Durant. You can't deny that. That's all I'm saying."
"Really it just varies and people are reading too deep into it. Here's last years for reference  &gt; 1. LeBron James, L.A. Lakers -- 29%  &gt; 2.

There's also one offs like Nick Young, ""Jrue &amp; Justin Holiday"" lmao...  So yea it's surprising but looks like these Rooks are just a bunch of bandwagoning nephews."
"Yeah, KD is Kevin Durant. If the Warriors call a time out, the ball gets moved up to the opposite hash mark on the court by the scorers table."
ESPN isn't credible.  The average American citizen wouldnt even recognize Kevin Durant on the street.
"Here's one that's not brought up *nearly* enough. Kevin Durant has made over 700 Free Throws in a single season, twice. (756 on 90% and 703 on 87%). Only 12 players have ever made 700+ and only 3 since '87 (Durant, Harden, Westbrook).  No other person has ever made 700+ on 90%. The next highest is Dolph Schayes back in '57 when he made 629 on 90%. The only other modern era players to make 500+ on 90% are Isaiah Thomas (590 on 90%), Reggie Miller (551 on 91%), Dirk Nowitzki (539 on 90% and 536 on 91%), and Magic Johnson (519 on 90% and 513 on 91%)."
"Agreed, Larry  ... Kevin isn't done yet  Will agree though that Durant is more a match up problem to do his size and skill though any era"
I flip a coin and would be elated with both players. Couldn't go wrong either way.   Gun to my head? Kevin Durant.
"If he starts hitting this shit in the NBA I’ll get a Kevin Durant jersey, and write 2 paragraphs not only describing the best recipe for a cupcakes, but the process of KD shoving 2 dozen of them into his mouth before every game without swallowing until right before he enters the court and the effect it has on his game."
"Big men are just as talented today, it's just that post play has been de-emphasized in favor of bigs who can shoot threes, pass at an elite level, and sometimes handle the ball.    In the 80's there were no players that were 7 feet tall who could handle the ball like Kevin Durant, much less shoot like him.  There were very few 6'10""+ guys who could consistently knock down threes.  Now many of the league's big men can do that and more.  A guy like Jokic would've been a beast in the 80's or 90's.  Peak Marc Gasol would've been just as successful in the 90's, if not more.  Other current guys like Jahlil Okafor would've done waayyy better in the 90's than he is doing now."
"&gt;Kevin Durant coming off the bench.  No, kd never comes off bench"
"Does this nonsense just get upvoted because there are a lot of words or are people actually this dumb?  Giannis played 34 minutes a game in the playoffs this year. His usage rate was 32%. In the regular season, he was playing 32 minutes with 28% usage. He was 7th in usage in the playoffs behind Lou Will, Donovan Mitchell, *Kevin Durant*, Harden, Griffin and D’lo. 0.2 usage points ahead of Kawhi. We weren’t relying on him heavily at all."
"Yup, as far as the top 100 goes, only 2 players would have a 70%+ TS%, Rudy Gobert and Kevin Durant"
"I think this year's Warriors team was the greatest of all time when healthy. But Kevin Durant, the 2nd or 1st best player in the world got hurt, and Cousins, a top 3 center in the NBA, got hurt. Cousins averaged nearly 18 10 and 3 in 25 minutes per game this year. The per 48 on those numbers is insane for a team that loaded.... I think they would have destroyed the Raptors if healthy. A clean 4-0 sweep."
Kevin Durant
I miss the Black Falcon too. I still think it’s batshit crazy that he was replaced by Kevin fucking Durant. lmao
"&gt;I’ve seen multiple posts about us “dumping” him for Danilo Gallinari when Kelly has a 58.3 career TS% and Danilo has 58.8 career TS% and Danilo is made of glass and expiring.  This is some information on Danilo Gallinari that would be relevant to that assertion. Take a look, and tell me how Kelly Olynyk provides even 50% of that overall value. If you need even more context or additional deatil (frequency, sample size, etc, plus other numbers) here's the entire compendium: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/143viGobcP9Puj-26sP20OrJPOeRP_0TMW6-moWqYfTs/edit)    -In 2018/19, 46.3 FG%/43.3 3P%/90.4 FT% shooting splits on 5.5 3PA per game and 6.0 FTA per game (usage rate of 23.8, good for the 89.5th percentile in the league)  -1st in the NBA in PointsPerPossession last season (among players with at least 1,000 posessions). In 2016/17, he ranked 2nd among the 73 NBA players who used 1,000+ possessions, behind only Kevin Durant  -13th in NBA history (5th among active players) in ORTG (118)  -29th in NBA history with a FT% of 87.1% (a career FTr of .450, compared to Olynyk's FTr of .264, and a FT% of 76.5%)  -.142 career WS/48 (.191 last season) compared to Olynyk's .128 (.126 last year)  -21st all-time in TO% (8.9%, to Olynyk's 14.7%)  -In 18/19, 1st out of 87 players (to play in at least 50 games and average at least 0.5 possessions per game) in PPP in post-up possessions (1.15)  -Also that season, 1st of all those same 87 guys in Free Throw Frequency in the post (26.9%, and his 90.4% from the line was also 1st of those 87 players)  - Other PPP possession types as follows:  -**91.3rd percentile on Spot-Ups**   -**69.2nd percentile on Iso** PPP  -**92nd percentile as PnR ball handler**   -**91.6th percentile as the PnR Roll Man**  -**82.4th percentile in Transition**   -**78.3rd percentile on Cuts**   -**91.8th percentile Off Screens**    -**97.7th percentile on “Misc”**   -**85th percentile (1.01 PPP) Off The Dribble** (as of 2/28/19)   -**90th percentile (1.28 PPP) on Catch-And-Shoot opportunities** (as of 2/28/19  -Only 1 of 2 players (Stephen Curry was the other) that ranked in the top 5 in both 3-point percentage (43.3 percent -5th) and free throw percentage (90.4 percent – 4th)  -shot 44-for-45 (98 percent) on clutch free throws, the best mark among players who attempted at least 25  -23rd in the NBA in charges drawn last year (12)  -The only NBA player 2016/17 to provide positive value in all 14 (7 offensive and 7 defensive) play types. In addition that season, opponents didn’t shoot better than 39 percent in any action that Gallinari was part of defending.   Gallo has always been a starter (and finisher) who has always been matched up with the other team's best forward defender for his entire career (save sometimes in the first 2/3rds of last season, and he played even better actually after the Tobias trade). He's averaged nearly 10 minutes more per game throughout his entire career, has been asked by his team to do much more for himself and others than Olynyk, has been much more the focus of the other teams' game plans than Kelly. Not to mention Olynyk has spent the majority of his career surrounded by more talent, and playing in the Eastern Conference.  If you want to argue that his injury history kills his value, you'll get no argument from me. But to quote the true shooting percentages without context to act like Olynyk is just as or almost as good is blatantly dishonest."

Its so rare to hear people say that.  If Kevin Durant went to pretty much any other team wed have rings rn
"&gt;The USA Basketball roster from the 2010 World Championship in Turkey boasted Derrick Rose, Eric Gordon, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and Kevin Love.  I don't think Eric Gordon helps the argument"
"Most teams sf is not Lebron james , Kevin Durant, Kawhi, or Giannis. The rockets had Pj Tucker at sf and almost beat a team with kd  at sf one year ago."
"Not only that, but both Kevin Durant and LeBron James have quit the league. Rose says Durant “got upset and he left the league.” Rose adds that James left the league after finishing in last place one year.  Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors and Maverick Carter are among the big names still in the league, according to Rose."

&gt; If you could design from scratch the ideal pure scorer you would get Kevin Durant with ~~better ankles~~ more shots
"No he isnt.   Kevin Durant is on the wrong side of  30 years old and coming off a major injury. He will not play next season. That puts him at 31 before he even gets back on the court. He will be 32 before rounds back into form.  He is currently at 22910 points scored. That means he needs 16,000 points to get #1 at least. 15300 for #2 (I'm assuming Lebron will be #1, with over 3900). So at 32 coming off his 2nd major injury, he needs to average 2000 points a season for 8 years. No player has ever done that.   He will almost certainly get top 10.  #1 or 2? Probably not.  Currently the Top 5 points leaders:  1.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html)  38387  2. [Karl Malone](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html)\* 36928  3.[Kobe Bryant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html) 33643  4.[**LeBron James**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) 32543  5.[Michael Jordan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html)\* 32292"
Also not his fault that Kevin Durant was drafted right after him...
"Over the last three years, even counting him sitting out for non-injury reasons, he's played more regular season games than Lowry, Steph, Butler, or Kyrie.   He's played 1 fewer game than Al Horford or Kevin Durant in that stretch.  And again - he could have played more if he hadn't done the whole That's All Folks routine last year."
Kevin durant. I know his name before I started watching basketball
And then he comes back and dominates because he’s kevin fucking Durant.
"&gt; Usage rating is more based on shooting attempts.   Yeah Jordan shoots the ball more often than Lebron.  &gt;LeBron can only guard the 1-3. Sometimes the 4.  Lebron has played the 4 for years. He just played the 4 last year he is considered a power forward now.  &gt;Relative to defensive dominance and impact, Jordan is the better defender. You can't even debate that.  Why not? Lebron in his prime could be put on anyone to plug a defensive hole. Everyone from Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook, Tony Parker to Kevin Durant and Paul Pierce to Kendrick Perkins and Al Horford. He guarded 1-5 not only in switching/help situations but also as a primary defender."
Kevin Durant is the time of time to get this done bro I’ll be back there in a few minutes.
"Imagine a team of shawn Bradley, manute bol, Kevin Durant, Corey brewer, and Brandon ingram..."
I like that somebody tried to throw a corner fade over Kevin Durant. You can't teach that sort of confidence!
"I’m really worried about Kevin Durant, guys."
"Ask your ""friend"" how Kevin Durant can be Top 10 all-time when he is mainly known for his scoring yet is 36th all time in points scored."
"Unfortunately, the thread was deleted where the article was summarized and broken down to be able to be understood without a masters degree in statistics but this article is what it was referencing to.  https://squared2020.com/2018/12/24/regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-part-iii-what-had-really-happened-was/comment-page-1/  It goes pretty in-depth into the mathematical side of RAPM models. The gist of it is that there are way too many variables that influence the models that the fluctuations vary even by changing minor definitions. Here in regards to possessions:  &gt;For our results, we compute stints as consecutive possessions played by a group of ten players. The way that I compute possessions is quite different than many other RAPM creators. For instance, the definition of possession is not uniform across the league. While my method of counting possessions matches the end of game results; distributing such possessions raise eyebrows. For instance, if a substitution is made during a free-throw and an offensive rebound occurs with a putback score; instead of double counting the possession, I say the second unit has given up 2 points over zero possessions as they had an empty possession that they yielded a score. Other folks will double count possessions. Others will count half-possessions. Either way you slice that possession, you induce an implicit bias in the direction of either unit. My implicit bias is that you should be penalized for not securing an offensive rebound despite being placed in best position, given the rules of the league.  &gt;In a similar manner, I tack on technical fouls onto current possessions. Many folks treat technical fouls as new possessions. Therefore the games where three technical fouls occur on one possession, I count it as one possession; while another person will count it as four possessions; three possessions with at most one point. And if we look at the computation of XtY above, you wee this will have grave effects on the resulting distributions. In fact, the biggest discrepancy year after year is Kevin Durant benefits from technical fouls like no other. It happens again this year as the technical foul discrepancy I impose drops his defensive RAPM upwards of a point per 100 possessions. It’s crazy to see how minor possession definitions dramatically affect RAPM. But if you’ve been following along, we see exactly why.  And that the standard deviations of RAPM calculations over small and even semi large samples is so big that you can't even distinguish effectively between players that are 50 spots apart:  &gt;In our given profession of NBA analytics, if someone doesn’t report the associated standard deviation with their analytic result they are either lazy or being malicious. As a statistician, no one cares about the expected value; they care about the error associated with an expected value. It’s typically coined as bias and variation. We do the same in GPS… we don’t report the error estimate, but rather the center of the error ellipse. Which is not guaranteed to be the same.  &gt;And there we have it… the standard deviations are approximately 2 to 2.5 points per 100 possessions for each player. So let’s see what this means for Fred VanVleet with respect to Gary Clark.  &gt;Since we are working with a Gaussian distribution, we can compute the test for comparison… we obtain a test-statistic of approximately 0.05; which has a ridiculously high p-value. This indicates the difference between first and fiftieth is not discernible. That’s right… being the top in RAPM is effectively meaningless from a statistical stand-point. And that’s the rub; RAPM is not an effective tool to significantly measure the impact of a player. It’s just a tool to rank guys and hope no one notices all the pitfalls along the way.  &gt;And it’s this primary reason that three-year RAPM becomes popular. In this case, the error variation drives down a bit, but the same problems exist. In fact, the tails will start to separate, but the middle of the pack still looks the same. For one team (over the years), I showed them that players between 100 and 300 were nearly identical.    So unless one wants to look at 5 or even 10 year RAPM calculations (which are still far from perfect) there is really no point in using it to definitively argue one point or another."
Kevin durant is the best scorer the NBA has ever seen
If you could design from scratch the ideal pure scorer you would get Kevin Durant with better ankles
"Kevin Durant couldn't bench 180 Lbs at the combine and he is a top 5 player, the NBA definitely doesn't require strength."
"Kevin Durant doesn't respect the game, people chose not to respect him. meh."
Russ is really a weird guy. He's one of those people that once you're in you're in though. Here is an in depth article on him that talks about this specific story and also a lot of his other quirks.   https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant
People shits on Westbrook because he failed to get out from the 1st round for 3 straight years since Kevin Durant left. He got outplayed by a rookie Donovan Mitchell &amp; Damian Lillard even when OKC were the favorites in those matchups.
"I agree with this. Lack of playmaking is what caused a lot of teams to underperform at the highest levels, even with rosters that make sense on paper. Like OKC before the blow-up. Or Kyrie-lead Celtics. Or every Harden Rockets team. That iso-through best 2 players only thing falls apart.     Someone like GSW can withstand one ball-stopper if he's Kevin Durant and the playmaking goes on around him, but you can't just ignore it."
"READ IF INTERESTED IN OUTPUT: Graph 4 in the Visualizations tab shows the clusters plotted in 2 out of the 3 components used. The Cluster Means tab shows the mean shooting stats for each player type I found. Now looks at the groups specifically:  Group 4 jumps out right away as big men with no outside prowess whatsoever, like don't even dabble in the mid-range, however they have the highest % of PTS from FT's surprisingly, unsurprisingly have the highest % of PTS in the paint, mostly assisted (probably on lobs or post-ups), notables include Clint Capela, DeAndre Jordan, and interestingly Ben Simmons.  Group 6 jumps out next as the group with the highest % of 3PT attempts and % of PTS from 3PTA, they have the least amount of PTS from FT's and in the paint on average and the highest % of assisted FGM, which tells me these are shooting guards who sit around the perimeter for 3's or cuts, notables include Danny Green, JJ Redick, Kyle Korver, and interestingly Dirk.  After these, the clusters start to look a bit more alike, but we'll take Group 2, who take as many 2PT FGA as 3PT FGA and have a very balanced source of scoring, basically sitting in the middle of the pack for everything, the differentiating characteristic I think is that 84% of their 3PT shots are assisted, but 58% of their 2PT FGA's are unassisted, so I'm thinking driving wings that can shoot, probably high volume scorers too, notables include Steph Curry, Paul George, Jamal Murray, and Buddy Hield.  Group 3 strikes me off the bat as stretch 4's or centers trained to start shooting 3's (bigs like Derrick Favors or Kevon Looney), 88.5% of their shots are 2PT FGA and 66.5% of their PTS come in the paint, but 8% of their PTS come from 3's and 97.8% of those PTS are assisted, notables include Anthony Davis, Derrick Favors, Kevon Looney, Pascal Siakam, and interestingly 1 season of Andre Drummond.  Group 1 has the highest % of points from MR and the highest % of unassisted FGM (and the highest % of both unassisted 2's and 3's), so they've got to be ballhandling PG's who are pass-first and create their own shot only when the possession doesn't work out, maybe like Chris Paul or Mike Conley, notables include James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Aaron Brooks, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, and Lebron James.  Group 7 is difficult to place by the numbers, 73% of their shots are 2PT attempts, a healthy amount of PTS come from MR as well as fast breaks/TO's and FT's, 59% of their 2PT FGM are unassisted and they run in transition so they've got to be wings, I'm thinking someone like DeMar DeRozan or Evan Turner, notables include Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Brandon Ingram (only 1 season of DeMar).  Finally, Group 5 has the highest % of fast break PTS/PTS off TO's out of any cluster and is assisted on the 2nd highest % of FGM. They have a healthy balance of 3PT shots and 2PT shots but not strong FT or MR numbers. These are players I'm assuming have little desire to play offense and take shots as needed, notables include Al Horford, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Otto Porter Jr.  Looking at the cluster means tab and then trying to guess which players are in each group is a fun game for those who want to try! Would love to see people you were surprised to see in each. Remember, this is based only off shot selection, not necessarily play style. Hope you all enjoy."

"""If I were you I'd go join the select team.""  -Kevin Durant, probably"
Kevin Durant?
"Dude it’s prime Lebron.  Prime Lebron Also attempted to Play defense and was an excellent 2 way beast.  Dwadw Wade is a great player and so was Bosh but can you Imagine the spacing with Curry, Klay, Dlo spotting up and moving off ball. Think ablut the passing and playmaking on that team in the front court and back court.  Imagine a Death Lineup of Dray at center, Lebbron, Klay, Curry, and DLO.  I mean this is Kind of like asking how good would the warriors be With Giannis this year.  I’m sorry but they would absolutely beat the shit out of clippers.  It would take 2-3 people to stop lebron and you still have to be guarding curry and Klay 30 feet from the basket and they are way better shooters than what Lebron has ever had or the bucks.  I think people are underestimating how much gravity both curry and Lebron have even NOw and Bron is what 35? Come on this is like asking how good would the Rockets be with Kevin Durant instead of Russel Westbrook."
That is just plain unfair Kevin Durant shit right there.  That’s like if The bucks had curry to go along with Giannis instead of Bledsoe.  Lebron would never have had such great shooting around him assuming Klay returns this Year and Prime Lebron was beastly.
"That was the ""I could shoot over him and hit what 43% of the time? I'm Kevin Durant. Yall know who I am."" ... one of my favorite interviews of KDs."
"No, you could have replaced demar with Kevin Durant and lebronto still would have lost."
"Let's see....I hate these players:   Zion Williamson-&gt; Went to Duke, considerably overrated   Anthony Davis -&gt; I see him and all I can see is Hubris.   Kevin Durant -&gt; no loyalty, snake   Grayson Allen -&gt; Fuck Duke. Fuck Grayson Allen   Luke Kennard -&gt; Fuck Duke. Fuck Luke Kennard.      Sooooooo yea, I've got a small bias..."
You don't have Kevin Durant... you don't get to cry about his injury
Well Kevin Durant has a established a legacy where he'll be selling shoes well past retirement. Also Kd's game didn't rely all that much on his athleticism. His height and shooting isn't going anywhere.
"2012-13:   F: LeBron James  F: Kevin Durant C: Tim Duncan G: Kobe Bryant G: Chris Paul  Everyone plays defense, shot creation and playmaking for days, and a lot more spacing than older first teams."
ESPN Alert: Kevin Durant hates being bothered by fans.
~~-Love and Irving both injured for the 2015 Finals. That’s almost unbelievable luck.-~~    Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson injured for the 2019 finals. That's almost unbelievable luck.   FTFY
"Your fan base is just as bad. You won one ring that literally hinged on Klay and Durant’s injuries. You won’t be winning a championship again for the next decade at the least. If Klay didn’t get injured the series looked like it was headed to 7. What’s even more hilarious is trash raptors fans cheering when Durant got hurt.  I don’t see how “they ran to Kevin Durant” . Their core was all drafted and Durant was a free agent, there is not one team in the league who would have turned down signing Durant.   “No thanks Durant, I know you want to sign with us but we are going to turn you down for parity” It warms my heart that Lebron ran a train on your organization and that once Durant is healed up, he will dick down your team into obscurity again."
"I find them arrogant af for a team full of players who had to run to Kevin Durant the second they faced adversity. I think it was the first time in nba history where a team’s entire starting line up was in the free agency meeting with the front office.  Also Klay is a sore ass loser and Draymond is a dirty player, but nobody wants to talk about that because Klay smokes weed and drinks chocolate milk and Draymond screams a lot."
KD didn't thinks so:  [http://www.knbr.com/2017/05/16/kevin-durant-defends-lamarcus-aldridge-after-stepping-under-his-jumper/](http://www.knbr.com/2017/05/16/kevin-durant-defends-lamarcus-aldridge-after-stepping-under-his-jumper/)
"Gibson played 23 games for us lmao, Oladipo 67, Kanter 72. Grant was playing behind a rookie at PF lmao, he was a raw athletic prospect from the Process Sixers. We were still in the running for the 4th seed early on (until injuries hit us) because Russ was playing mad and Presti knew he had to compete so he traded for Taj.  Funny you mentioned SF because we had Roberson, McDermott, and Singler replacing Kevin Durant."

"Did you just start watching basketball kiddo? Let me remind you of Kevin Durant and OKC, Lebron James and Cleveland before the return, and Vince Carter w Toronto until recently."
"Didn’t realize Harden and Steph went one on one all these years. Oh right, I forgot that Eric Gordon and Chris Paul cancels outs Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Fucking Durant as teammates."
"""and company"" oh you mean the greatest spot up shooter of all time, Kevin Durant, Iguodala, and one of the best bench units in the league?"
Teams that's missing Kevin Durant isn't as good as expected. Shocking
"Now imagine, Kelly olynk didn’t rip Kevin loves shoulder out on purpose, 2015 finals Kyrie and love both played instead of a solo lebron and mosgov taking them to 6 games, and then if Kevin Durant didn’t join a 73 win team the “dynasty warriors” would have zero rings."
"Yes, the best season of Carmelo Anthony’s career was still much worse than a random Kevin Durant season, congrats on the self own."
\*\*Laughs in Kevin Durant\*\*
"Trust me, reddit forgets fast. Nephews next season would post about this random nets player named Kevin Durant about how he is so good * rolls eyes*"
The ghost of Kevin Durant.

"I like Kevin Durant at 12, that’s all I’m gonna say"
..how much is kevin durant loving this? Lol
Kevin Durant
"Trouble for the warriors, and..  Kevin Durant ain’t walking through that door!!"
I’m saying that harden relies on tick tacky foul calls for his efficiency and Kevin Durant does not.
"In nutshell:  Kawhi is an all time level defender. However, being an offensive focal point AND a defensive stud is too taxing. It’s not advisable especially regular season. Going all the way back to Jordan. Last year Paul George tried. He ended the season all tore up.   So the higher Kawhi’s offensive demands and offensive game have gone, the lower his defense has. He’s still at like 85% of what he was( which is still good enough to be DPOY) , but he’s not 100% of that.   Ironically enough, people ‘get’ all that, but when it comes to Lebron, they don’t let it slide. Even tho he’s had to carry even more of an offensive load, and he’s about to be 35, people still expect him to strap up like he’s 25. Bc...he’s Lebron  Some of it is on him bc he actually falls alsep on help D. They’ll rest him on say PJ Tucker who is a cake defensive matchup but he’ll still give up a easy shot.   However,  the dirty little secret is, unless you are literally Kevin Durant or a guard like Steph Curry, **you are not making a living scoring on Lebron**.  People think it’s sweet now, but purely off physical makeup and smarts, good luck trying to exploit Lebron defensively 1 on 1. It ain’t happening. That includes Kawhi. Come playoffs when Kuzma and Rondo come back and lightem Lebron’s load, you will see Bron guard Kawhi or PG in the 4th."
"Then you would be out of your mind to pick Kevin Durant. From a measurable standpoint, it's like asking would you rather fight Jon Jones or Demetrious Johnson."
"It’s probably more in the NBA due to stress, look at Kevin Durant too"

And here's a case sample of why Kevin Durant chose to join the Nets instead of the Knicks.
I strongly believe that Flip Off 🖕 was intended for kevin durant 🧁

Nah bruh. Kevin durant averaged more points on higher https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2018-nba-western-conference-finals-warriors-vs-rockets.html
"There is no such story of the best history. It is foolish to compare players from different eras, Kawhi has to be compared to players today, and right now he is the second best player in the world (only below Kevin Durant)."
"Kevin Durant shoots at a very high volume and is incredibly efficient, dumbass"
Kevin Durant&gt;
"Kevin fucking Durant, Ibaka, Kevin Martin, James Harden, D.J Augustin, Sefolosha, Derek Fisher and Kyle Singler.  OKC didn’t have great spacing, but consistently had enough. Russ just didn’t deliver in the playoffs."
ya that's going to make your team play better. Probably a pretty good recruiting tactic for a superstar like kevin durant too
"Kevin Durant is 3 in combined minutes played, Chris Paul is 2, Lebron is 1.  LeBron has been an iron man starting every game of his career (minus that one game he gave up his spot to Varejao) going in to his 17th season.  Here are the top eleven active players.  |Rk|Player|MP|Starter|Minutes diff| --:|:--|--:|:--|--:| |1|LeBron James|56353|x|-| |2|Vince Carter|48555||7798| |3|Pau Gasol|45805||10548| |4|Andre Iguodala|41753||14600| |5|Dwight Howard|39544||16809| |6|Chris Paul|37210|x|19143| |7|Kevin Durant|36901|(x)|19452| |8|LaMarcus Aldridge|35467|x|20886| |9|Tyson Chandler|33611||22742| |10|Trevor Ariza|33491||22862| |11|Kyle Korver|33468||22885|  http://bkref.com/tiny/nB5Ux"
"LeBron with over 46,000 minutes played has booked 13,000 more minutes than any currently active starter in the NBA.  That is regular season minutes only and is equal to 4 1/2 seasons of 82 games with 35 minutes a games more than Chris Paul who is in second place career active minutes as an active starter.  He has played enough playoff game minutes to equal another 3 1/2 82 game seasons with 35 minutes. Almost twice as many playoff minutes as Kevin Durant who is number two active player in total playoff minutes."
"Kevin Durant really hates true shooting percentage. (This is literal, he hates it)"
"... and then they do it in game time.  But sure, you obviously know waaaaay more about shooting a basketball than Steph Curry or Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant...
"it started off as amir johnson, then draymond green, then giannis, then kevin durant, and then kawhi leonard.   the expectations kept rising as he expanded his game"
Recent memory:  Kevin Durant doesn’t come back in game 5 of the 2019 finals.   Raps win in 5.   Kevin and Klay are both spared season-long injuries.
Why does AD think he's Kevin Durant?
"Just because I was curious, Wiggins is 12th  11977 - James Harden  10048 - Russell Westbrook  9684 - Damian Lillard  9524 - Stephen Curry  9391 - LeBron James  8823 - Anthony Davis  8542 - DeMar DeRozan  8478 - Kemba Walker  8322 - Klay Thompson  8250 - Giannis Antetokounmpo   8089 - Kevin Durant  7789 - Andrew Wiggins"
Cameroonian Kevin Durant
All of the below players are better than Kawhi. The list isn't in order and I've probably forgotten a couple people. He needs a lot more longevity at this level before he can get into the top 15.  Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Lebron James  Magic Johnson  Kobe Bryant  Time Duncan  Larry Bird  Hakeem Olajuwon  Wilt Chamberlain  Shaquille O'Neal  Bill Russell  Kevin Durant  Karl Malone  Kevin Garnett  David Robinson  Dirk Nowitzki  Charles Barkley   Steph Curry  John Stockton  Isiah Thomas
"Chris is going to be fine. Better than McKinnie. I think you're misunderstanding what Warriors fans feel positively for Chris. He's great for our offense it's simply an issue of not having an extra weapon out there with Klay where his ability to pass and screen will work really well for us. Anyway we're collecting big men noone wants in Zaza, Javale, Bogut, Chris, Spellman, WCS. We had no money to spend, we only offered a ham sandwich. Anytime you trade Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant for D'lo and you keep basically the worst bench in the NBA you're going to feel it."
"Honestly, isn't being a fan of a player generally kind of arbitrary? And to play devil's advocate, didn't a lot of the folks you mentioned get a lot of arbitrary distaste from fans for their actions? I'm a Pistons fan and LeBron's Heat decision still ruffled my personal feathers (it was his right, of course, but also mine to disprove). And Kevin Durant seemed to struggle to escape the hate for his move to Oakland.   Just the same, reasons for liking players can be just as arbitrary. I'm a huge Vince Carter fan because I think his dunks are the best dunks of all the dunks. Loved Ben Wallace for the fro, playing his butt off every night, and being true to the game. Not exactly super deep reasons, but they work for me.   It's only sensible that some folks would not be fond of James Harden's style of play."
"Unlike the warriors you say?  https://www.google.com/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/strength-in-numbers-convinced-kevin-durant-to-join-warriors/amp/  Also, neither PG nor Kawhi joined a 73 win team  I think you’re salty because Kawhi didn’t choose you in FA"
Kevin Durant
"I love Kevin Durant. I know this sub used to hate him, but I loved him since 2013 and never stopped gawking at his play style."
"Kevin Durant, but im biased"
"Clippers didn't  even make the conference finals last year.  Warriors added KD to a team that had just had the best regular season ever, had a back I'll o back unanimous MVP and were still the team to beat even after the upset by the Cavs.  Look I'm  not even rooting for them (cuz Kawhi dumped us) but this comparison is apples and oranges.   Also the Clippers were eliminated by the warriors when KD famously said  ""You know who I am, I'm Kevin Durant"" in response to questions about Beverly's defence on him."
BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU HAD KEVIN DURANT AVERAGING 35PPG AND 8 REBOUNDS IN THE FINALS PRIOR TO THAT AS WELL AS LEBRON AVERAGING A 30 POINT TRIPPLE DOUBLE AND BOTH WERE OUT THAT YEAR?
Kevin Durant had an argument last year. Especially the way he started the playoffs off. Y'all know who he \[was\]...
"My favorite player is Kevin Durant.  but i have a sweet spot for my boy Zach Lavine, i know he doesnt play D and his shot selection is bad, but he has the tools to be an all star in the east in the future if he continue to develop his game and get a lot better Bball IQ.  for a brief period he was the best player in 2k15 by far, you just needed to go to the hole at all times."
Kevin Wayne Durant
no. that is why it is considerably worse than making fun of the Warriors losing Kevin Durant.
"He's just a clown, i don´t think the Warriors cheated, they drafted very well and then signed Kevin Durant, that's not cheating"
That and the fact that you traded away James Harden and then lost Kevin Durant a couple of years later.   I mean the Thunder fucked up their own chances without his help.
"Shaq averaged 12 points, dude was old and slow. Same with Big Ben. Ray averaged like 7 points, lol. Kevin Durant for one has had way more help than LeBron has had in his career."
"But this makes too sense , this can't be it.   We're also gonna ignore Kevin Durant who has also been dominant and would most likely be the best player right now without his injury."
"Kevin Durant had  Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka, Curry, Klay, Green, and next season Kyrie  Nobody's had more help in todays NBA than Durant  Edit: didn't realize is he said past 30 years. I was looking at the 2010 decade"
"Better at defense, better scorer, better on the drive and stronger, and has done more with less. Steph has had Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, David West, LeAndro Barbosa, David Lee, Andrew Bogut. It’s been easier for him to look good compared to Harden. Harden took a team of Pat Beverly, Jeremy Lin, Chandler Parsons, Domontas Motiejunas, Omer Asik, and Francisco Garcia to the playoffs in his first season as the main guy."
"If you’re being serious, I would suggest watching more basketball. In game 1 of the 16-17 season, the warriors had a healthy Klay, Draymond, Steph and someone else... oh yeah, freaking Kevin Durant."
https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/9/18/16327672/kevin-durant-private-instagram-account-arguments-nba-warriors
"Lol imagine comparing kevin ""2 points in the finals"" love and kyrie to fucking kevin Durant and Klay.  In fact I would argue that the loss of Kevin alone outweighs the other 2."
"Kd is one of the biggest trash talkers In the league. You didn’t watch him in okc if u don’t think this. Kd backs up all of his trash talk by being the greatest scorer on the planet. “You know who I am, I’m Kevin Durant”"
"They lost Klay to injury. They also lost Kevin Durant,Iggy and Livingston. Quinn Cook would be there 4th best player this year but they also lost him.  This isn't the warriors of last year, the roster is terrible now."
"Yup, they did. And I criticized the fuck out of Lebron and AD, so you're just beating a dead horse at this point.    You took the comment the wrong way. I actually wanted to see you guys do moderately well for Steph's sake, but I don't really see how that can happen when it's Steph, Draymond, and D'Lo (neither of them had a great game), Looney and a bunch of rookies+G-leaguers.  That's not a very good team at all.  Remove Kevin Durant from the equation. There's no Iggy (I know he's old now). No Barbosa. No Livingston.  It doesn't look good at all, right now."
"You could also make it 1947- present either Harry Gallatin, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Willis, Or Kevin Durant  were playing in the NBA"
"But you had kevin durant and Klay Thompson lol. Also guys like Boogie, Livingston, Nick Young, Jordan Bell, McCaw, Javale going back these past two years were legit NBA players who provided good minutes in the playoffs. Your fourth best player this season is Kevon Looney, who I love, but shouldn’t be the fourth best player on a potential playoff team. There’s gonna be a ton of pressure on Steph and DLo to put up numbers every night and it still might not be enough if someone else doesn’t step up on a given night. DLo as the number two option this year would be the number 4 the past two years. The warriors past two years didn’t need depth to win. This team does and I’m not sure they have it."
Should the Warriors look at recruiting some good support players like Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant? I think it would help them out.
"Lol they lost Iggy, Klay and Kevin Durant tho"
"Renowned basketball player Kevin Durant smiled, the ends of his mouth curving upwards in a physical expression of pleasure. The 240lb adult male human being nodded his head to indicate satisfaction and returned to his bedroom by walking there. Still asleep in the luxurious four-poster bed of the expensive $10 million house was the beautiful wife of Mr. Thompson. Renowned basketball player Kevin Durant gazed admiringly at the pulchritudinous brunette’s blonde tresses, flowing from her head like a stream but made from hair instead of water and without any fish in. She was as majestic as the finest sculpture by Caravaggio or the most coveted portrait by Rodin. I like the attractive woman, thought the successful man."
Kevin Durant is on the Brooklyn Nets and Klay is out for the season. It’s over. Enjoy mediocrity for the next 15 years
Steph Curry the last few years was just Kyle Korver with Kevin Durant
"with fucking kevin durant, healthy chris paul rockets are still better than the potential peak of the westbrook rockets"
Scored more points than 99% of this sub.  That 1% is obviously the handsome and cool dude Kevin Durant.
"Please! It's about time they got a taste of their own medicine, in 2015, Kevin Love was injured against the Celtics, Kyrie ""the world is flat, why don't people seek out my opinion on serious topics?"" Irving was injured during game one of the NBA finals. In 2016 Zsa Zsa injured Leonard and finally the basketball gods decided it was time for the Warriors to experience injuries, Kevin ""I choke away 3-1 series leads then join the team I choked to"" Durant blows an Achilles and Thompson tears his ACL."
You know Kevin Durant
"&gt;KD was better than LeBron since 2012.  ""Kevin Durant has been better than LeBron since LeBron beat him in the finals and went on to win 2 MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, and 3 Rings before Durant (1 MVP) ever made the finals again.""  Odd take, but respect your opinion."
Look back at that 2016 series. The Cavs came back and won that series. What did the Warriors do in the offseason? They didn’t sit on their hands and treat the result as meaningless. They brought in Kevin Durant. They made sure the result of 2016 didn’t repeat in 2017.
"Well, we turned over like 2/3rds of our roster, and when we get rid of basically everyone on the bench but keep the starters, its easy to form that narrative. If guys like Joe Harris and Jarret Allen were bench players, they would have a positive RPM too.  If you look at per 100 +/-, you can see [**Harris, Allen, Dinwiddie, Kurucs**](https://imgur.com/syOOCPt) were really the only ""negative"" RPM players we retained (LeVert was slight positive.)  Kurucs and Allen were rookies and are still growing their game.  So really, we're just going from 1 positive RPM to 4 Negative RPM starters to........1 positive RPM to 4 Negative RPM. **So where is the roster dropoff coming from?**  Additionally, the majority of the ""positive RPM"" players barely logged a 1000 minutes for the team - **Ed Davis, Carroll, RHJ, and Dudley** were the only ones that logged significant minutes for the team. For the others you are running into credibility/sample size concerns (plus you aren't controlling for opposition - 3rd stringers playing against 3rd stringers and not opposing starters.)  Furthermore, we replaced those guys that with **Taurean Prince, Garrett Temple, DeAndre Jordan, David Nwaba**. Prince and DAJ (DAJ was a requirement to get KD anyway) had a negative RPM, but Temple and Nwaba had positive RPMs with their last team, and Prince is a starter who realistically should have a lower RPM starting than guys like Dudley or RHJ off the bench.  So I would I agree that our bench is probably *slightly* worse than last year to start the season but that was the price to leave 38m in cap space open to sign Kevin Durant. And that's not taking into account Kenny Atkinson's ability as a developmental coach to turn guys like Prince into a positive RPM player or guys like Musa getting more time this year.  I think the only real bench piece we'll miss is Ed Davis, and that was only because we were forced into signing DAJ."
"Alright guys, I hope this isn't a rule breaker...….I was hoping you could help settle a work disagreement. Which one of these teams would win the most titles in a 5 year window. I know this may not be a normal type post but I imagine a thread like this won’t fly on the NBA board. (We simple snake drafted a starting 5 with the only stipulation of which team wins the most championships in a 5 year window) (The number next to their name is where they were drafted) Team 1: Kyrie Irving (12) James Harden (7) Lebron James (6) Anthony Davis (1) Kristaps Porzingis (13) Team 2: Damian Lillard (8) Klay Thompson (11) Kawhi Leonard (2) Kevin Durant (5) Karl Anthony Towns (14) Team 3: Steph Curry (4) Luka Doncic (15) Paul George (10) Giannis Antetokounmpo (3) Joel Embiid (9) Any thoughts on our disagreements would be great. If there is a better place to post this please let me know!"
"It's not that simple. Some kids who have grown up knowing nothing but the Lakers being a crappy team.  As Kevin Durant said about the Knicks, people growing up have grown up watching them suck.  Thing is, even then, Lakers are more popular.  Clippers have been headed the right direction for a good while now. Lakers are still more popular. And they will continue to be.  This is LA."
"See what Horford did compared to Kyrie and think about why maybe Celtics fans would be upset at Kyrie.  It takes 10 seconds of critical thinking. No one is mad that he got an opportunity to play with Kevin Fucking Durant, everyone is mad with how he went about how he did it."
Why is Kevin Durant on the court???
Lol. He had to play with scrub shooters like Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.
He faced a 73 win team that added Kevin durant and took them to 7 games. Fucking lol he was the only superstar in the league who was actually competing with the most stacked team in league history
"This might be dumb, but I think they would work out well :  Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Shaquille O'Neal."
Steph Curry  Micheal Jordan  Kevin Durant  Lebron James  Shaq O'Neal  Purely for offense
Kevin Durant

"Ratings are down because the Knicks suck, the face of the league is in the Pacific time zone, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant are out for the season, Chicago isn’t good, and the best healthy player (Giannis in my opinion) plays in a small Market with few televised games.    Injuries, locations of the best players/teams, and bad teams in big TV markets are whats causing the ratings drop."
"To play devil's advocate, 29 points compared to 31.6 is actually fairly significant. It's the difference in offensive calibre of someone like Paul George compared to Kevin Durant. When you get into the 30s in scoring average, you're in the company of generational greats and the difference of 3 points at that level really does separate good seasons from great seasons."
"People just remember the Rockets and Cavaliers targeting him on defense whenever they could, and assume it was because he was a bad defender.  They forget that when you're on the court with Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green - 4 all-NBA level defenders - that's gonna happen with any point guard under 6'6."
"It’s like getting mad that you got Hakeem when Jordan was still available. MJ is better than Hakeem but the gap isn’t that huge, and Hakeem filled a specific role that was championship caliber. Trae isn’t as good as Luka, but he’s a lot closer than people think.   As for analysts takes, take them with a grain of salt. They need to sensationalize and exaggerate things for numbers. I’ve heard LeBron was washed going back to 2017, Luka’s game wouldn’t translate to the NBA, Kevin Durant is a better playmaker than LeBron, Westbrook only gets assists because he forces teammates to shoot, etc;"
No? Kevin Durant was better than Bron in both series...
"Which is refreshing to see. Not compromising even one play in a game or the integrity of teamwork for a stat.  I LOVE(d) Russ. During the second year of this triple double history run it was very obvious he cared more about the triple double vs the team's success (in the regular season. Playoffs were different) whereas what he did was iconic and a massive feat for professional sports, it also had a negative side effect. Everyone cared so much and ESPN so highly hyped the triple double stats, that it gave a false sense of role, talent, and elite treatment. The side effect is when you're *good* at everything, there's not a strong enough outcry or sense of urgency to fix your shortcomings.  In early dream team Russ/Durant/Harden years, I distinctly remember Russ driving hard to the hole, making the basket, eating fouls and taking a FT with swag. Looking for the finish before the foul. He also hit a lot of clutch long range shots, and frequently got hot from deep late in games.   The triple doubles defined him and as a result, the pressure to practice the shot and fundamentals have disappeared. Some of his 3s are comical. He misses easy short range shots, and gets overly aggressive in approach and even misses layups.  He's different than some other stars who have fallen from Grace. Melo's talents degraded very publically and he basically embraced them, routinely laughing and having an ""idgaf"" attitude on the side line (i.e, a Steph Marbury, Dwight Howard, JR Smith) he's trying . He's not making light of the obvious problem,  He's trying.  Luka could have gotten one of those late rebounds but it'd of required players on the team purposely passing on getting it themself. Even though it likely wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, the team prioritized the win and collective effort over getting their star the stat.  This is an exciting time. If he can stay *relatively* professional, keep a level head and stay healthy...this dude can be a generational talent we should all be VERY excited about, to the tune of Dirk Nowitzski, or dare I say it a Larry Bird.   Clearly massively talented, sharpshooter with the fundamentals locked. A multifaceted team player who does whatever it takes to win a game at the cost of his own stats. Not overly tall or big or strong , not a physical phenom, not an overhyped college talent with top of the mountain expectations....just a fundamentally strong and safe ball player with elite shooting capabilities, unphased by the big stage and able to be trusted with the last shot with the game on the line, in just his second year.  Though his stature and across the board statistics scream ""Kevin Love"" type, make no mistake. This is the face of this organization, and as he grows as a player, he can be the best player in the league within 3 years if he literally stays the same on offense and builds a more reliable defensive presence (which is harder than it looks)  One thing we should all be able.to agree on is he's damn good for the sport."
"Back in 2009 being drafted by the Warriors was the same as being drafted by the Hornets. They made the Playoffs ONCE for 17 years. Kyrie could never provide what Steph provides because he is an ISO star - he delivers with his own stat sheet but he couldnt involve other players like Steph does. Kevin Love had a chance to beat the record for points in a Quarter and what Kyrie did in the last two possesions .. went Iso. Now observe what Steph does when Klay goes hot.   Dame is better than Kyrie and he is like light Curry but he isnt that good being off ball, in this scenario Draymond doesnt become that good, Warriors arent as good as they become, they likely dont overcome OKC and Durant likely dont join them."
"I like Melo, but he was never near 2x better than Kevin Durant"
"**USA TEAM**: Steph Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis  **World TEAM:** Luka Dončić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Pascal Siakam, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid  Team world loses in 5, maybe 6. Team USA has 5 top 10 players, meanwhile team World has 3-4 top 10 players. It's closer than most think."
"Players with a legitimate argument over Derrick Rose in 2011. For the record I think Rose or Dwight deserved it.  * Dwight Howard: 23 ppg, 14 rpg 2+ bpg. Orlando had 52 wins, Dwight was the DPOY.  * LeBron James: 27 ppg, 8 rpg and 7 apg, Miami had 57 wins but he also had 2 all star teammates. I think as good or better than Rose but the all star teammate narrative hurts.  * Dirk Nowitzki: 23 ppg, 7 rpg 3 apg on 52/39/89. Dallas had 57 wins, but was 2-7 in the 9 games he missed with injury. If he doesn't go down, Dallas likely wins 64 games and is the 1st seed in the West.  * Kevin Durant: 28 ppg, 7 rpg 3 apg, OKC was 55-27."
"People knew Kevin Durant was a one of a kind talent and Oden was still almost the consensus top pick, i would say he had finals mvp potential"
"Better than believing in the ""Brazilian Kevin Durant"" draft day comparison of a former raptor"
Jonathan Bender.....He was a Kevin Durant but bad knees killed his career.
Kevin Durant. Dude is unstoppable on the offensive end
Why do you need a reason for me to dislike the Nets with Kyrie and Kevin Durant?
I’m not saying what your insinuating at all. You’re bringing other people into this because you don’t have an argument for lebron. Lebron is a elite slasher with elite playmaking . Kevin Durant is a SCORER the difference being that primarily he can shoot jumpers of varying degrees of difficulty because he’s a skilled shooter AND can slash.  You’re talking about AD and kareem like I wouldn’t agree they’re scorers because they’re bigs and in reality they are because they have a variety of consistent offensive moves outside of just lay ups and dunking. Lay ups and dunks are the easiest thing any a n nba player can do. Being able to do a multitude of different offensive moves at an efficient level puts you in a different conversation
"This is the same person who left LeBron (top 2 player of this generation) because he wanted to be seen as “the guy” on a championship team, then left Boston when he realized he couldn’t live up to that/things didn’t go his way to then go team up with Kevin Durant (top 2 player of this generation). He has been hypocritical/contradictory in more ways than one and his stance on an issue seems to be that he will support whatever side is optimal for him until it is no longer benefits him. Kyrie is fine with media/entertainment if it makes him money/benefits him just like he doesn’t want to be “the guy” if it means people are constantly criticizing him instead of praising him for his handles and scoring as the number 2 option."
Who's Kevin Durant?
All-Sensitive first team  Ben Simmons  Kyrie  Kevin Durant  KAT  Embiid
Zion is going to take the torch from bron and longboi will evolve into Kevin Durant. I’m bout to become a pelicans fan in a few years.
"I hope not.  I don't understand why people think he deserves it.  Yes he was a talented player but he completely spat in the face of all thunder fans, not just by his serpentine decision but also the shit he talked on the organization after.  I don't think many Thunder fans have a lot of love for Kevin Durant, and ultimately, retiring his number is up to the fans and the organization.  A retirement ceremony for KD would seem so unauthentic after all the drama after his leaving"
Kevin Durant

"Not from me. I'm too tired. I'll just let kyrie live. Honestly, does anyone really give a fuck? Seriously. I don't care if he has mood swings or that he didn't work out with other teams. Still fun to watch. He's not the leader of the nets. Kevin Durant is, so I don't get the whole moody angle as if its matters. If KD is able to curtail his mood like lebron james did, then who cares."
Has nothing to do with what was said here. But I sure enjoy not hearing about Kevin Durant now that he's injured. Guy makes my blood boil.
"Shooting=/=Scoring  Klay Thompson is a better shooter than Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant is one of the greatest scorers ever.  You could make an argument Kobe was a better shooter than Lebron, but I would say Lebron was a better scorer."
"Ehh... I think you’re off on that one.  People who love the game still admit it’s just a dumb game when you really get down to it.  Kevin Durant has been well documented loving Basketball more than any other non essential thing in his life. It’s always talked about how he lives and breathes it, no matter what or when, he’s playing. Even he just last year said really it’s just a game and even winning championships isn’t that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.  Some people take it super seriously and think of it as the center of the u inverse, but just because some don’t, doesn’t meant they don’t love the game."
"Transition scoring is a much, much smaller piece of the game than fucking shooting 3s, getting to the line, and shooting in general.  If you really can't see the difference in scoring ability between Kevin Durant and Steph vs. LeBron, then all I gotta say is take off your homer glasses dude.  One guy is an unprecedented 7 foot tall shooter who can drive and shoot from anywhere on the court, and the other is the greatest shooter of all time.  LeBron is great for all that he does, but he's not on *that* level when it comes to pure scoring."

He called Kevin Durant first.
https://youtu.be/aWgISv8C9is this guy wrote a song about Kevin Durant being a bitch.
Kevin Durant. Nothing beats seeing him pull up in the mid-range covered like a mofo and just knowing that it is going to go in the hoop anyway. He is probably the most fun to watch cause he is just *that good*  Dude was what got me really into nba basketball.
"I'm sorry man but you're out of your mind if you think Russell Westbrook is or ever has been a better player than Kevin Durant. If you're talking about greatness and importance to the team, yes, you could say someone like Russ is the greatest Thunder to ever play. But Kevin Durant is absolutely the best player to ever play for the Sonics/Thunder. Russ did not carry them to ""a decade of playoffs"" lol. He had a amazing statistical season after KD left and met a first round exit. Then Paul George came along to help carry the load, and they still met first round exits.  Russ is not my favorite player by any means, but I can acknowledge that he is an all time great and will revered by OKC for a long time to come. That being said, he is not and has never been better than Kevin Durant."
"Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Boogie Cousins getting injured helps too."
Who do you think is having a better season so far?  Giannis or Kevin Durant
"Correct in comparison. LeBron played better players hands down.  Who did Jordan face that was at the time better than Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, etc?   Big wow he beat up on Byron Scott.  Gtfoh"
Kevin Durant actually had this same scheme run for him in OKC.
ah the kevin durant school of defense
"I think you can draw a line between mid-range and long-twos.  The mid-range can be a superpower, especially in the hands of Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard.  But notice how both of those guys are closer to the paint than the arc when they take them.    Long-twos, by contrast, are as aesthetically unpleasing as jacking threes, but also less satisfying when they drop.  I love it when DeMar fakes a drive before pulling up at 15'.  I hate it when he dribbles once to cross the arc before accepting a lazy 20'.  Players should absolutely play to their strengths, but if your bread-and-butter shot yields less points than a boiler-plate offensive action, then there's serious concerns about your value overall."

"So according to your logic, Kevin Durant is the greatest Warrior since he won 2 and got 2 FMVPs? Did all that in just 3 years.   &gt; seeing as you're 16 tops.   good to know your age nephew."
The Warriors signed Kevin Durant in Free Agency.  They won titles with Durant.  The Warriors broke your Warriors Rule.

Kevin Durant next season
"With or without Nurk, Blazers only go as far as CJ &amp; Lillard take them.  The Rockets have a point when they say they would’ve beaten GSW with CP3 given his contributions to the team and the fact that it was a 7 game series. With Nurkic, Blazers MAYBE stretch the series out but no way they beat the Warriors.  Also if you want to play the injury game, GS didn’t have Kevin-Fucking- Durant."
"Jordan, LeBron, Bird, Magic, Kareem, Shaq, Hakeem, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry"
I'm really looking forward to the incredible chemistry that two well adjusted guys like Kyrie and Kevin Durant will show together.

I think in a 7 game series Luka, Giannis and Jokic could will team Europe to 2 wins. This isn't even conidering Steph Curry or Kevin Durant who would clearly be starters for team USA.   Now if you combine Europe and Africa then I think it gets a little interesting."
You have a Kevin Durant GSW flair lmao
"Michael Jordan, James Harden, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant
Noting about kevin Durant proves hell leave
"What? If OKC beat the greatest team ever, and win it all against Lebron and co., that would automatically make Kevin Durant a top 15 player right there. Mavs had the one of the greatest individual performance, but OKC could've achieved something huge, by alternating BOTH Curry and Lebron's legacy in a big way."
Did Kevin Durant die?
"Hello! this comment has 69 words in it so i alphabetized this comment: ~~~~  ""isoball"" + Durant GSW KD KP Kevin Luka Steph/Klay/Dray Their WCF Warriors and and appreciation. are be best blamed carried could court, endeared even fanbase fans for full got he his how in irk it knowing love matter may more never no not on player players playing see sensitive showed some star team that that the the the them. they though.. to towards was way what, when would yet  ~~~~"
"Their fanbase may not see it that way though.. they would be endeared towards Luka + KP no matter what, and knowing how sensitive some star players are that could irk them.   Look at Kevin Durant who was GSW best player on the court, yet never got his full appreciation. Warriors fans showed more love to Steph/Klay/Dray and blamed KD for playing ""isoball"" even when he carried the team in the WCF"
6’3 Jrue HOliday had to spend an entire series guarding 6’11 Kevin Durant. Not just some stretches here and there an entire series 250+ poss. It was either him or Anthony Davis those were the two options. Solomon Hill basically being unplayable at 4 years $48 mil was a big L they couldn’t afford
"oh okay so because you like him it’s heart but because you don’t like melo he’s a ball hog? they were both black holes at times.   melo was a black hole with cole aldrich, jason smith, pablo prigioni and Alexi Sved.   russ was a black hole with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Serge Ibaka and Paul George"
Kevin Durant
Pretty good they got some guy named Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant, because of the time he admitted that growing up he wanted to play for Toronto because he was a fan of Vince Carter. Ever since then, I always wished he would play for Toronto."
"The Knicks aren't cared about in any regards. They are a perennial punchline and possibly the least competitive team in the league. The only sliver of publicity the Knicks have is that Stephen A shits on them twice a week. Imagine if he didn't even do that, there'd be no Knicks coverage at all.  The Nets at least go through cycles of being good and just signed two 1st ballot hall-of-famers *in their primes* in one offseason. Wait until Kevin Durant comes back, ESPN won't stop talking about the Irving-Durant Nets as Brooklyn goes for deep playoff runs.   Honestly it's sad that such a popular, historic franchise cant figure its shit out, hopefully you guys get a new owner and front office in the next decade or two"

"Why are you asking the same question every day? Even Luka himself said that he learned from harden how to draw fouls. Everyone is doing it, chris paul, kevin durant, steph curry, lebron, you need at least 8-10 ft attempts if you want to be an elite scorer."
Bad picks happen all the time in hindsight. Remember when Greg Oden was picked before Kevin Durant. That was a big LMFAO
"He *won* an MVP with a team that was built around Kevin Durant, not himself."
"1984: Rockets select Olajuwon and miss Michael Jordan  2007: Blazers select Oden and miss Kevin Durant  2018: Phoenix, SAC, ATL, all miss out on Doncic.   Joins the ranks of the biggest what-ifs we’ll look back on some day. Err. Guess we’re looking back on them already.  Edit: You think Rockets wouldn’t rather have MJ?? What are you smoking. I’d say missing out on the GOAT is a big what if. Doesn’t matter who the fuck you draft over them. They’re the GOAT."
"&gt; don't try to claim that the Raptors win that series against a full health Warriors team.  You're right, Warriors were looking lost without KD and a shell of their greatness despite going undefeated without KD in the Western playoffs vs. the Blazers and the Rockets. Everyone knew they were doomed vs. the Raptors despite reverse sweeping the ""will beat the Warriors with KD"" Bucks.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26840350/nba-finals-experts-predictions-warriors-raptors-finals-mvp  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2838059-nba-finals-2019-odds-and-bold-predictions-for-raptors-vs-warriors-series  https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesgoldberg/2019/05/21/can-golden-state-warriors-win-the-nba-finals-without-kevin-durant/  &gt;While there are no guarantees that Durant will come back in top form when he is able to return to this series, the combination of Curry, Thompson and Green will be good enough for the Warriors to earn their fourth championship in five years and their third straight title.  &gt;Championship experience pays off as Golden State wins the series in six games.  Meanwhile literally 90% of ESPN analysts had GSW winning, even taking KD's injury into account. I'm not saying Toronto beats GSW with 100% healthy KD, I'm saying people still had the Warriors as favorites to win even without KD. Where the fuck did I say Toronto beats GSW with healthy KD?"
And let’s remember they didn’t win the finals. Just cuz you dominate in the regular season doesn’t mean it’ll be an easy road to the finals.   Unless you get Kevin Durant the next year
Ok team whose fan base booed Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson as they got injured. That was just so hilarious coming from you! Lmao
"Don't sleep on Kendrick ""Kevin Durant"" Nunn and Carson ""Steph Curry"" Edwards /s"
he went to the Kevin Durant school of drawing fouls. thank god he didn't go to the Steph Curry school.
"They are a very different team this year. They used to have Russell Westbrook (he’s on the rockets now) and Now they are in a rebuild. They have Chris Paul who is one of the best point guards ever but he’s getting old and declining a bit now. I don’t know how much you know about the players but they drafted Keving Durant, Russel Westbrook, and James Harden. All three are phenomenal players. They chose to trade Harden (which turned out to be a terrible idea) and Kevin Durant left to join the warriors (which is why a lot of people hate him on here).  If you have any specific questions about the team or any other teams/player or just about basketball in general I’d be happy to answer you."
This is what Westbrick did to Kevin Durant for nearly a decade.
"Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"It's amazing that most superstars that have rings today have stretches where their superstar teammates like Wade or Kevin Durant can pull them out to save them from poor play from them for an entire half and sometimes a entire game, and Harden gets dinged for his teammates one time stepping up to save him for a quarter when he is carrying them team day in and day out."
"If we're including injured players like that:  1) LeBron James  2) Stephen Curry  3) Giannis Antetokounmo  4) James Harden  5) Kevin Durant  6) Anthony Davis  7) Kawhi Leonard  8) Nikola Jokic  9) Joel Embiid  10) Paul George  11-13) Doncic, Gobert, and Lillard in some order"
For a second i thought Durant Kevin.
"There is 0 chance they stay together even if they could afford them. Kevin Durant is searching to be the exclusive solo franchise player. Harden always wanted to be leader, and Westbrook always wanted to prove he was special. You can argue 1 or 2 of them may have stayed, but they are not keeping all 3 with those personalities"
Steph Curry is Kyle Korver with Kevin Durant and moving screens
"And if you down with the nets, fuck you too!  Kevin Durant, fuck you too!  Kenyon Martin, fuck you too! All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!"
No shit cause that's fucking Kevin Durant
"&gt;He’s a top 5 iso player in the league   I'm not sure how much that matters if he isn't closing out games thanks to his ISO ability. I don't really care a player is good at ISO in the 2nd quarter, ISO creation matters when defenses get tight and your team struggles to run their actions. and I don't like clutch stats since it's inherently a small sample size but Middleton doesn't really rank well there - shot 35.1% in the regular season and 22% in the playoffs.  &gt;an elite midrange shooter  lol no. 43.5% from midrange isn't elite. Kevin Durant is elite (55.1), Rudy Gay is elite (52.2), CJ McCollum (50.2), Kyrie (49.6) is elite.   Middleton is a pretty good from midrange but elite is stretching it.   &gt;Meanwhile Horford’s 33 and very clearly showing his age.  it's pretty funny to me that the ""showing his age"" thing keeps being brought up when statistically he had maybe the best season of his career. career best in BPM, RPM, TS%, 2nd best in WS/48.  it's fine to project Horford down and Middleton up because of age, don't think it closes the gap between them.  &gt;basketball isn’t played on stat sheets.  apex boomer take."
"Probably now, just think about the players that were on that Golden State team that year. Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, a great defensive year Klay Thompson, Andre Iguadala before he got old, Draymond Green, Clyde Drexler, rookie Michael Jordan, James Naismith's ghost, 2 clones of LeBron, dream team Christian Laettner, and the football player from The Last Boy Scout that pulls out a gun on the field. I just don't see PG making a huge difference that series."
"Kevin Durant was out since round 2, everyone was still predicting you guys would crush us.  And Klay missed 1.25/6 finals games.   This is the exact crying that I’m talking about. Just take your L and try to learn from it."
I mean no Kevin Durant or klay thompson kind of changes things
"Kevin Durant is an obvious one, but he’s way bigger and more developed at the same stage. I can see Bates transitioning into more of a power forward whereas Durant was primarily a small forward."
1980-85: Larry Bird and Moses Malone  1985-1990: Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan  1990-1995: Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon  1995-2000: Michael Jordan and Shaq  2000-2005: Shaq and Tim Duncan  2005-2010: Kobe Bryant and LeBron James  2010-2015: LeBron James and Kevin Durant  2015-2020: LeBron James and Steph Curry
"Curry's defense is tough to evaluate. He's not terrible, he tries, his physical tools are not the best. But he's also on a team that was trotting out a lineup where the second-worst defender was Kevin Durant. Curry could be an above-average defensive player (I'm not sure he is), and he'd still be the logical point of attack when your other options are going at Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, or Draymond Green."
Really failing to see the parallels here. They're different teams that had different issues in relation to their competition.  The Warriors still won 2 games with a grand total of 11 minutes of Kevin Durant in those finals. The Warriors were the more talented team overall but the Raptors were able to put a better team on the court because the Warriors limped to those finals.
"Dray is saying tdurant - not Kevin Durant, was talking shit imo.   I agree he’s saying it’s not the American dream, it’s a more specific undefined dream - probably the black American dream? I dunno mate."
We already have Kevin Durant tho
"He literally said nothing but good things about them back in [August](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-on-if-the-warriors-mishandled-his-calf-injury-hell-no-211347829.html)  ""It was a life-changing experience,” *he told Yahoo Sports.* “I grew up as a young adult in OKC and then entering my 30s in Golden State was an enlightening experience, getting to play the game and reaching that level with the players of different backgrounds. It was just so much that went into that experience that elevated me mentally, physically and elevated my game. It was a fun time and I appreciate all that we accomplished together.”"
2018-19 Kawhi Leonard  2018-19 Stephen Curry  2018-19 Kevin Durant  2018-19 Klay Thompson  2005-2006 Shaquille O'Neal  2015-17 Kyle Lowry  2002-2003 Karl Malone  2004-2005 Chris Bosh
"Kevin Durant sounds like such a whiny bitch  You won two championships and two FMVP who cares if some fans talked shit about you, you make like 30m a year lol."
"By your calculations, Kevin Durant has two championships. Falsehoods."
"&gt; *that’s why guys like michael jordan, kevin durant, and kobe bryant are who they are, they can transcend any defense*  i’m glad kerr said this; this is exactly what this sub needs to get through into their thick skulls.  TS% &amp; PER be damned; being able to hit a tough shot in the face of great defense is invaluable. especially when set plays break down  this is exactly how kawhi made a living this entire postseason as well, add him to the list."
"For the lazy:   “I wasn’t at all offended by what Kevin said because it’s basically the truth,” Kerr told Anthony Slater of The Athletic. “You look at any system, I mean, I played the triangle with Michael Jordan. The offense ran a lot smoother all regular season and the first couple rounds of the playoffs than it did in the conference finals and Finals. It just did.  ""That’s why guys like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant are who they are. They can transcend any defense. But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over.  ""No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact.”"
My point is that giving someone a position based on who their primary assignment is doesn't really work logically.   For example lets say Kevin Durant is guarding Lebron James. Perhaps you would say Kevin Durant is a SF then. But if Lebron James is guarding Draymond Green then suddenly Lebron James would be a center and Kevin Durant would be as well since he's guarding Lebron James.   Or even more simply you could just look at two players playing different positions guarding each other. Would Stephen Curry guarding James Harden make Stephen Curry a SG or does it make James Harden a PG?
"This just in: ""Kevin Durant might play this season"" - Rachel Nichols"
"best part of the story:  &gt;So, I’m texting my wife, telling her I’ll probably get traded because I think it’s 100 percent sure, even though everyone else is saying, it’s only a chance.   &gt;Then, once KD (Kevin Durant) left, I’m like, ‘Yeah, I’ll probably get traded. They’re probably going to do a sign-and-trade, so they can get something back, to at least get assets for him.’   &gt;No one was thinking that. But I was thinking they’ll want to get assets back because they can’t just let him go. And they’ll probably move me as well. So, she asked me where I thought I would go.   #I said, ‘I don’t know, I’ll probably end up in Memphis or some s--t.’  &gt;“She says, ‘For real?’ I was like, ‘Maybe. But probably not. I don’t know.’  &gt;“The next day, I got the message. It was Memphis. I fell out laughing.” A massive grin crosses Iguodala’s face. **He likes this story and still has the text exchange with his wife, Christina, on his phone.**"
"I would like to trade Julius Randle for Kevin Durant, please reply at your own convenience."
"Lmao, if we look at KD's real height which is probably about 6'11 245 lbs would be overweight for 6'11....  Kevin Durant is definitely going to be leaning underweight bud"

"All the Kevin Durant haters were so eager to rag on him. If the warrior system always worked, they would have beat the Cavs and the Raptors. Kevin was right and nothing he said was particularly out of line. Stephen respectfully disagreed but r/nba thirst for drama must be fulfilled"
"&gt; And it amuses me how you downplay his competition. KD won against LBJ who’s considered the GOAT or second best all time. Kyrie irving someone who can average 27 in his sleep, kevin love, RJ.  &gt; Congrats bird won mvps over magic who averaged 17 and 12 and a young MJ.  I find it hilarious that you included 35 year old Richard Jefferson in the list of all time greats that Durant played against, while at the same time trying to disregard the importance of winning MVP's over Magic and Jordan, two of the best 5 players of all time."
There is no combination of words in any language that you can say to me that will make me think Kevin Durant was not being a bitch when he signed with the Warriors.  You have to ignore SO MUCH of the context
No it was really bad it wasnt like a lbj-kevin durant convo where you can make arguments for either side
"My younger brother's freshman basketball coach only played the football players because they were stronger.  Sat 3 guys that ended up being their best varsity players the next year or two.  His reasoning was that basketball is all about strength, and that guys like Kevin Durant would never be successful in the NBA.  One of the few times I've called a guy an idiot to his face."
He IS a power forward though right? I feel like he's too small to be a center. Kevin Durant played SF for most of his career and no one gives him shit for it when hes like 7 feet tall.
So are you saying Kevin Durant has the argument to be as good if not a better player than MJ?
I guess Kevin Durant isn’t a decent 3-point shooter then. He shot below league average last season
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2218531-kevin-durant-says-he-cant-palm-a-basketball
"I see Kevin Durant has chosen to create a pseudo reddit account while he recovers from his achilles. Good on you, mate."
"""What if"" it is an endless wormhole where everything is possible and people choose only the good and never the bad.   Durant could have won the MVP in 2010 and died on his way home due or could have had a devastating injury in 2012 like Rose.  Life doesnt work like that, there is no Kevin Durant without Lebron James"
Kevin Durant has entered the chat
Kevin Durant played 4.75 games against the Rockets averaging 35 ppg in the series. Kawhi faced KD for a a god damn quarter.   Don't pretend they are the same. KD was the main culprit in the Warriors three wins out of four.
"I'll throw out a guy who isn't gonna be top 5, but was an amazing scorer no one knows: Adrian Dantley.  He had a eFG% that is similar to Kevin Durant for his career, averaged a ridiclous 8.7 FTA per game (higher than MJ, KD, and Harden - although Harden will surpass that with more seasons) while having multiple 30 PPG+ seasons.  He just couldn't shoot the 3, but if you are just talking about scoring, he could score (and do nothing else)."
Kyrie used his wokeness to hypnotize the refs in Brooklyn's favor. Whilst Kevin Durant was angered by 13 year olds on Twitter and balled out to prove those 13 year olds wrong.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: grammar/wokeness
"&gt; Michael Jordan on virtually any team in the league would win rings  This is an absolutely ridiculous statement. Just like how lebron on any team would instantly win rings? Yet, he's got one in the last 6 years and totally flopped with the lakers last year. No one is arguing MJ isn't one of the greatest players of all time but you're being an absolutely massive MJ fanboy. The whole ""MJ is the goat thus he's flawless"" shtick gets stupid old stupid quick.  &gt;The Bulls never had a decent center if you remember anything about that era.  The bulls also had a better team that ran an entirely different system. If you remember the blazers lost game 6 in the finals by choking away the game to pippen *and the bulls bench,* not jordan.   &gt;Sorry to say, but the Blazers easily win three and possibly more championships with MJ.  lol, yea okay. Saying any thing like this makes you sound like an idiot. It's not even ""they could have"" you're just straight up saying ""they would have because mj's the goat.""  &gt;I know that’s a hard pill to swallow, and if my team had chosen Sam Bowie over Jordan and then pass on Kevin Durant  No I really don't give a shit about these things. What I'm still sour about are things like the 2000 WCFs, not getting sabonis, and our entire injury history, especially Roy.   &gt;The Blazers have made so many bad decisions over the years but those two are some of the worst in history in any league.  &gt;You literally have no idea what you’re talking about.  It's hilarious how stupidly hypocritical you are. You know fuck all about the NBA and even less about the blazers. First off, as it's been discussed time and time again, nearly every team was going to take Oden over Durant. When Oden played, he was a top center. That's poor injury luck, not a bad decision. (It's especially pointless since Durant left okc any way) Secondly, the blazers have consistently been one of the best run teams in the league. We have some of the best season averages in the league and some of the most playoff appearances. Do your research and stop regurgitating the ""mj's goat"" bs."
"Haha ok dude, sure. Michael Jordan on virtually any team in the league would win rings, much less one with the talent that the Blazers had at the time. “You could argue there were greater” is a really, really difficult argument to make and he was by far the best player for a 10 year span before his retirement. The Bulls never had a decent center if you remember anything about that era.   Sorry to say, but the Blazers easily win three and possibly more championships with MJ.   I know that’s a hard pill to swallow, and if my team had chosen Sam Bowie over Jordan and then pass on Kevin Durant I’d bury my head in the sand and never utter a word. You literally have no idea what you’re talking about. The Blazers have made so many bad decisions over the years but those two are some of the worst in history in any league."
"If you want to do the whole like ""team has 5 lower level all stars who gel well together"" thing then sure you could open it up to like 20 dudes, if you mean like as a legitimate #1 clear cut lead alpha dog, then it's probably like 6 dudes.   Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo"
"It's not about being 'clutch' but rather it's about being a shot maker in pressure situations. The first part of that is being a shot maker which stars like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are. But, doing it in pressure situations is different. That's why Kd is not very clutch he has terrible clutch stats just like Steph even though his body type allows him a clean look at the basket at all times.  It's really just about performing the same way you would at the beginning of the game at the end of it despite the added pressure and defensive attention. Overcoming the extra stress and defensive attention is part of being a legendary basketball player."
Kevin Durant agrees with you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePKdbM7j0wI
Kevin Durant barely makes it in the top 20
Kevin Durant doesn't belong there
Yup. When Kevin Durant got injured in the NBA Finals against the Raptors. I knew then that the Raps would win because Curry and Clay are not enough.
"It also wasn't Hakeem's second year. I don't get where this second year as a first option thing came from either. Dream was first option pretty much his entire career. And first option doesn't even make sense.  Hell if we're going to go that route, Kevin Durant or Steph Curry won it their very first year as a first option. I mean sure, why not."
"&gt;There were only 2 nba all teams.  yes and i literally specified first-team. keep up pls  &gt;Likewise James Worthy had to contend with Bird, Barkley, and Wilkins.  are u seriously trying to argue that james worthy just couldnt make the teams because of the competition? and not because he just wasnt a first-team all-nba level player for any timeperiod? stop it lmfao. once again, just cuz ur ignorant doesn't mean everybody else is.  james worthy and willis reed were simply not on the level of kevin durant and you should feel bad for trying to imply that they were"
That's disingenuous. If he got the help he wanted he would get James Harden and Kevin Durant. He was trashed in 2017 for asking for a playmaker and receiving a washed up Deron Williams. 'How much help does he need'. Meanwhile the Warriors had just added Kd and people were mad at Lebron for trying to even it up.
Hakeem Olajuwon Kevin Garnett Kevin Durant Kawhi Leonard Kobe Bryant
"james worthy: 0x all-nba first-team  willis reed: 1x all-nba first-team  kevin durant: 6x all-nba first-team  again, just cuz ur ignorant doesn't mean everybody else is lol."
I legit don’t know enough about him to dispute it but I hope you’re wrong :(. Everybody in okc acts like he’s the next big thing but I just hope fans here aren’t expecting another Russell Westbrook or Kevin Durant to just pop right up again

"So your argument for Stockton being better than KD is that he's a much better playmaker, more durable and a better defender.  Stockton is a great defender relative to his own position. He was never a m2m stopper and his versatility was very limited. Defense isn't a reason to take him over KD.  Stockton is a much better playmaker. But he wasn't a Magic, Nash level playmaker who leveraged the threat of their scoring to force a defense to choose between two untenable options (and in doing so, led several of the greatest offenses in lg history). He prefered patience over aggression, scanning the floor over making reads on the fly and making something out of nothing. Not the type of playmaker who can provide offensive value that surpasses that of a thoroughly dominant half court scorer like Kevin Durant who btw, is still a solid playmaker.   Stockton's prime lasted about ten years. KD was about at that level before his achilles tear. So longevity isn't a strong argument."
Just as long as you're consistent and don't fault Kevin Durant as well.
"Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Steph Curry or LeBron James, they're kinda tied"
"And then he left them and criticized their system on the way out. Literally the best offense in the league and he's complaining.  Dude, Michael Jordan is way better than Kevin Durant. Like is Kevin Durant even better than Steph/James Harden? That's Kd's class.  &gt;Also that description of KD is very off... He dropped 40 every game after game 1  I'm talking about his defense though."
"ok i understand the narrative of lebron calling for a strong crew to back him up- he did it in miami, and then when he returned, and now in LA.  But unpopular opinion- Kawhi did the same damn thing and everyone calls him amazing for it  [there were reports of him trying to talk to KD](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/07/06/kawhi-leonard-recruit-kevin-durant-clippers)  [there were reports of him trying to talk to jimmy butler and kyrie](https://www.cleveland.com/sports/2019/07/kawhi-leonard-also-tried-to-recruit-kyrie-irving-to-play-with-him.html)  dude was literally just going down the all-star list of players that had a chance of coming to LA  unpopular opinion but if Presti decided not to budge on the PG contract, Kawhi would be a Laker right now - he wanted a superstar teammate as much as anyone else in the league while playing in LA.  but everyone goes ""wow Kawhi GM really pulled it off"" when the credit should really just go to the Clippers Org and Kawhi gets plaudits for failing multiple times at recruiting the guys he wanted initially because ""ooooh he made people wait though"""
Kevin Durant: DNP - Detention
"Klay missed 1 game and the 4th quarter of the most important game, when you Kevin Durant didn't play and Klay Thompson didn't play important parts of a game Golden state was barely at 50% of what they could do. That was by far the weakest version of a finals team in a long time"
He was asked a question about Kevin Durant.  He says he hopes durant finds happiness and compares him to mj and Kobe.
"People on here (online in general) have so little self awareness it's wild. How so many young white men can unironically tell Kevin Durant that he's a bitch is beyond me. The dude came from a place you could never understand, and accomplished things you couldn't dream of..."
Did big markets really dominated this decade? Knicks 295-427 (.409)  Lakers 306-416 (.423) and Bulls 387-335 (.549) this decade. The Lakers/Knicks the biggest basketball markets got looked over by Paul George/LMA/Kevin Durant/Kyrie Irving/Kawhi Leonard. The biggest dynasty was from a perennial loser in the Warriors. The next biggest dynasty with the Heat formed more because of player relationships and not market size. Three teams won their first titles in franchise history Dallas/Toronto/Cleveland. Two small market teams won with Spurs/Cleveland.
Rose isn't even relevant anymore though. Kevin Durant is a superstar and top 5 player who keeps saying controversial things over and over and over again. Rose hasn't.  Read up on Kobe's case. She changed her story multiple times and was caught lying. She was showing up to parties bragging about them money she was going to get from Kobe and how big his dick was. Her testimony was completely unreliable.
"I wouldn't say the level of performance necessarily correlates consistently. An elite NCAA player will *probably* be a contributor in the NBA, but not much more can be said.  The [Naismith College Player of the Year Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_College_Player_of_the_Year) recognizes the very best player in all NCAA basketball, essentially the MVP.   Here are the winners since 2000:  Kenyon Martin  Shane Battier  Jason Williams  TJ Ford  Jameer Nelson  Andrew Bogut  JJ Redick  Kevin Durant  Tyler Hansbrough  Blake Griffin  Evan Turner  Jimmer Fredette  Anthony Davis   Trey Burke  Doug McDermott  Frank Kaminsky  Buddy Hield  Frank Mason III  Jalen Brunson  So not exactly proportional"
and it was without kevin fucking Durant and with Klay missing a bunch of games too
"Blake Griffin is a .345 three point shooter, Kevin Durant is at .381"
Yea but that’s not really what beta means and all that matter is Kevin Durant saying “we’re all betas” so
Is Kevin Durant the most insecure dude on the planet?
Just another day of Kevin Durant on the internet lol
"&gt;Kevin Durant grew up in a single parent household don't care &gt;wears #35 for his murdered AAU coach nice thing to do, but irrelevant &gt;It takes an absurd amount of work to be a an NBA player at all agreed &gt;I think it's definitely unfair to call him mentally weak given the level he's reached and what he went though growing up still a snek"
We've been saying it for years when will people learn.    It's because Kevin Durant is a bitch.
"Naw bro that's not you.  I'm Kevin Durant and I was just at the Hawks practice scoping it out, didn't see you there."
Starting Harrison Barnes as Kevin Durant.
"They were the exact same in the grand scheme of things.   The most “stacked” team at the time were aging. No shit Lebron wouldn’t join them. But he literally tried to compile the most amount talent possible in one given team. He WAITED until Bosh moved to Heat to make his announcement. What more do you want?    I don’t hate either situations at all, but to say they are vastly different is hilarious.   Kevin Durant left to join Klay, Curry, and Green to go against Love, Irving, and Bron.   Lebron left to join Bosh and Wade to go against the Celtics and Lakers."
Kevin Durant is the easiest one here. The various hardest road shirt memes.
"I dont know but the best is ""Fuck Kevin Durant fuck Kevin Durannnnttt"""
"The problem with this post is that it's just ""Leave Kevin Durant alone!"". He doesn't need defenders. He's not being unfairly treated. He's an NBA superstar who keeps starting these conversations about his character with his own statements and actions."
"He worked with the office, Bosh, and Wade to make sure contracts allowed all three of them to play together, a situation that wouldn't normally work out, let's not act like ""there was no proof this would be a good team"", it was two of the NBA's most elite players paired up with it's best.  You're right, it's dumb to compare this to Kevin Durant joining the already dominant Warriors, but let's also not dumb down the narrative.    KD and Kyrie in Brooklyn really isn't that different than Lebron and Kyrie in Cleveland.  Brooklyn has a much better overall team, but there's no one filling that third star role (Jordan is no Kevin Love) and while I'd give Brooklyn the advantage, it's not substantial."
"Calling NBA players “mentally weak” is a bad take. I think people who’ve never played sports seriously underestimate how much mental adversity it takes to make it to an elite level of any sport. It doesn’t matter how tall and strong you were born, it’s still tough as shit to even make a college team, let alone make it all the way to the NBA.   I dropped out of division 2 wrestling because I couldn’t take it mentally, it was by far the hardest thing I had ever done and I just wasn’t tough enough. Kevin Durant has been performing and training at the most elite level for years and years, and I find it rich that all the regular Joes genuinely think he’s mentally weak. Then they console themselves by believing he’s just a athletically gifted pussy, not wanting to recognize that he has surely been through adversity that they will never know."
Oh yeah? Well make me 7 foot tall and incredibly talented at basketball and then I'd do even more charity work than this kevin durant guy
"NBA listed heights are a polite [fiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/sports/basketball/22score.html).  Some try to credit it to ""in shoes"", even though the reality is that it is driven more by what the player or the agent or team wants. Shoes don't always make up the discrepancy in height or make you shorter. Draft combine measurements are now often available, sit's common to add an inch or two.  But then again, you don't play basketball with the top of your head.  Jerry west was listed at 6' 2"" . He, KD, KG etc are among those taller than listed  [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley)  &gt; His height, officially listed as 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m), is stated as 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) in his book, I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It.   [MJ](https://www.celebheights.com/s/Michael-Jordan-1482.html) &gt; Pat Riley was once quoted saying ""Did you know that when Jordan was measured he was only 6-4 and a half, not 6-6 the way he's listed"".  [Kobe ](https://fansided.com/2017/03/27/kobe-bryant-height-6-foot-4-lakers/)  &gt; You know how it took Kevin Durant an eternity to admit he is 7-foot and not 6-foot-9? It turns out that Kobe Bryant has been doing something similar.  &gt; According to Bryant’s wife Vanessa, he is actually 6-foot-4 and 3/4 as opposed to the 6-foot-6 everyone believes he is, which she found out by measuring him herself a few years ago. It might sound trivial on the surface — who really gives a damn about how tall Bryant is at this stage of his career? — but it becomes more interesting when you consider NBA players constantly lie about their height"
There is a post saying Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are miserable. Like lmao I think they are doing just fine.
Ding ding ding.  Kevin Durant has done a ton of good deeds and seems in general to be a good person. He's also got some big time flaws in how he handles himself with relationships with his past at times.  Both can be true.
Draymond had to take a backseat on offense because 3 years ago they got a little FA called Kevin Durant
"Which is fine...but apply it across the board.  Don't let the Lakers sign a similar contract in 2016, but freak out when Houston does it in 2019.  Or shit like this  &gt; Because there was not a sign-and-trade agreement in place for [**D’Angelo Russell**](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136776/d'angelo-russell) when Brooklyn’s new stars committed on July 30, both [**Irving**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/296953/kyrie-irving) and [**Durant**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/297049/kevin-durant) at first were set to have $4-5 million in unlikely bonuses in their contracts. That extra $10 million -- generated because unlikely bonuses don’t count toward the salary cap -- would have allowed the team to sign [**Irving**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/300015/kyrie-irving) and [**Durant**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299020/kevin-durant) outright and use the remaining room on free agent [**DeAndre Jordan**](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3442/deandre-jordan) and second-round pick [**Nicolas Claxton**](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4278067/nicolas-claxton).     &gt;   &gt;However, both players caught a financial break when Golden State approached Brooklyn later that night about the possibility of acquiring [**Russell**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/294270/d-angelo-russell) in a sign-and-trade for [**Durant**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/299374/kevin-durant).

In total, Durant and Irving could have opened the door to lose a combined $16 million had the [**Warriors**](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors) not stepped in at the last minute.   &gt;   &gt;The $1 million in unlikely incentives for Irving are broken into eight $125,000 bonuses, ranging from games played, statistical benchmarks and offensive/defensive rating. All eight are deemed unlikely for cap purposes since they weren’t achieved in 2018-19.  Looks like circumventing he spirit of the CBA to me.  Structuring ""unlikely"" bonuses around a down year and then using them to get just enough wiggle room to get around having no cap space.  Shit like Durant getting 1 million if the Nets make he playoffs, even if he never appears in one game is blatant circumvention"
Because I think Kevin Durant is the best player in the world
"Please go ahead and downvote this before reading to save yourself some time.  Ready? Last chance to save yourself 2 seconds. Just downvote and move on.  Okay you asked for it pal.  Kawhi Leonard used to be one of my favorite players in the league but I'm still a believer that he spurned the spurs and quit on his team. There's something really fishy about him and his family that we'll learn years after retiring. Now I think he's kind of a self-serving piece of shit who doesn't care a lot about winning basketball as a team, he only cares about his status and his paychecks.  In case you haven't already downvoted, I used to not care a lot about Kevin Durant but I've gained respect for his perseverance through his injury in Golden State and admire all the personal struggles he's overcome to become a 2x NBA champion. I think the hate is way overblown and am so bored of it."
"Yeah, but does Kevin Durant like Wendy's?"
"In that offseason, where a bunch of crappy FAs got max deals, Kevin Durant was the only clear SF upgrade from Harrison Barnes."
No it wasn't a bad move for Kevin Durant. As long as people aren't saying legitimately fucked up things I do not care if they hate him for the sole fact that it made the Thunder worse entertainment wise. You cherry picked the absolute extremes to make your point without taking account all possibilities and I feel like you needed called out.
"I interpreted it like this, Porzingis isn't a setup and protect the rim kind of player by reputation at least. Yes he blocks shots but more in the manner of Kevin Durant blocking shots than Rudy Gobert. He's a good defender that gets into good position but he doesn't have a long history to go back on as a consistent shot blocker"
"How fucking dare anyone out there make fun of KD after all he has been through!  He lost his brother, he tore his Achilles.  He had two fuckin kids.  All you people care about is karma and making memes off of him.  HE'S A HUMAN! (ah! ooh!) What you don't realize is that KD is making you all this money and all you do is write a bunch of crap about him.  He hasn't performed on court in months. His warmup song is called ""Give Me More"" for a reason because all you people want is MORE! MORE-MORE, MORE: MORE!  LEAVE HIM ALONE! You are lucky he even performed for you BASTARDS! LEAVE KD ALONE! Please.  Steve Kerr talked about professionalism and said if KD was a professional he would've pulled it off no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional to publicly bash someone who is going through a hard time?  Leave KD alone please! Leave Kevin Durant alone right now! I mean it!  Anyone that has a problem with him you deal with me, because he is not well right now.  LEAVE HIM ALONE!"
"To those that need to hear it:  Just because something is normalized, doesn't make it acceptable. Just because someone is a public figure, doesn't give you a free pass to shit all over their character. Yes, Kevin Durant has said and done some questionable things. But you can still make the choice to treat him with respect. Just like you should treat random people you know nothing about with respect-- this is common courtesy, folks.  Lots of people making a snapshot judgement about the man's entire character based on a few quotes and incidents-- sure, you have the RIGHT to do so. But is that choice going to make the world any better? Did you ever think how it might feel to, as an individual, be overwhelmed by the negative talk surrounding you despite working so hard in life?   It's not surprising that he comes off as ""insecure""-- just look at the amount of hate he gets daily, and he's already shown that he DOES read the stuff and it DOES affect him. At the end of the day, he's a lot like most of us, just a mid-20s guy trying to figure out this thing called life in the internet age.   You can hate KD for shit he's said or done, but at the end of the day, you can still treat him with a shred of respect. Some of the shit I've read about him is straight up ridiculous and way beyond the scope of basketball."
"A quick summary: This article basically explores how the Warriors will do this season, and why their playoff hopes are so variable, through the lens of a couple interviews with Steve Kerr and Ron Adams. A few excerpts below:  &gt;On rookies Jordan Poole, Eric Paschall and Alen Smailagic: “I like all of them. We have a really good crop of gym rats.""  -Ron Adams  &gt;“Nobody knows what we have right now,” Kerr said earlier this summer on the Warriors Insider podcast. “We know what we’ve lost. We’ve lost Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and Klay Thompson. So, from that perspective it doesn’t sound that great.”       &gt;The Warriors have gone from sure thing to mystery team. Adams and Kerr know what’s ahead, and they understand it will be their most challenging season."
"Kevin Durant is a great person.  Is off the court decisions, as they relate to playing basketball, are ripe for criticism."
"What? So you think Kevin Durant ""the man"" is the basketball player and not the personality?"
"No one worth a damn attacks Kevin Durant, the man.   Kevin Durant, the basketball player is top 20 all time. Not much to criticize there.  Kevin Durant, the behind the scenes basketball personality? Trash."
"The thought of Kevin Durant on the Warriors was  too much for Billy Donovan. He talked Sam Presti when their deal was dead. ""We cannot allow that to happen. I told Sam jokingly, 'If you can’t get another MVP and two All-NBA players and a great bench, he’s moving to Golden State.’ I really believed that.”"
"Now the year is 2007. The Spurs are fresh off their 16-2 championship run, Kobe's first FMVP, and juxtaposed to the floundering Lakers who--although the recipients of a Finley, Manu, and Beno Udrih package--managed to finish in the bottom 3 during the regular season following Manu's dreadful testicle injury.    The basketball god's, as we would be reminded of years later, are stubbornly adamant about giving these Lakers the 2nd pick in the draft. Portland is head over heels for the generationally talented Buckeye / can't miss prospect Greg Oden. This lands the Lakers the consolation prize, a 6'11"" can't bench 135 lbs Kevin Durant. The talking heads are sharks smelling blood in the water. Yes, he can score from anywhere on the floor but that's against college kids. He's a twig, the league will break him in half.    With their 2nd rd pick, the Lakers take a chance on the Gasol pedigree and select Marc, Memphis Grizzlies Pau Gasol's doughy kid brother.    KD then blossoms into a mega superstar living large, young, black, rich, and famous in LA and one serendipitous afternoon runs into a certain someone at the Westwood Sprinkles. They exchange numbers. She invites him to her bungalow. Asks if he wants anything to drink while simultaneously opening the fridge anticipating the beer request. He declines with the wave of his massive hand and instead mouths:    B A T H W A T E R"

Why didn't Kevin Durant maximize Westbrook? Westbrook and Harden also are better without Durant.
I was a GSW fan and a Kevin Durant fan up until KD joined the Warriors. Now I'm just waiting for KD to become a free agent and leave. This team makes the playoffs boring.

Steph Curry and isnt close. Thats why Kevin Durant joined him to win a championship or two
"Yes, they also tried to trade Curry to the Bucks. instead, it fell through, then some shit happened, and now they have 5 allstars including kevin fucking durant"

"Look at the top 10 Free Throw shooters in the NBA this season:  |Rk|Player|FT|FTA|FT%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|9.8|11.3|.863| |2|Joel Embiid|8.0|10.0|.801| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|6.5|9.3|.701| |4|Anthony Davis|7.4|9.1|.813| |5|Kevin Love|6.8|8.3|.818| |6|LeBron James|5.3|7.8|.682| |7|Kevin Durant|6.9|7.6|.911| |8|Kawhi Leonard|6.5|7.6|.846| |9|Blake Griffin|5.8|7.6|.759| |10|Damian Lillard|6.0|6.7|.904|  Should none of these guys be getting calls?  Surely Embiid and Giannis shouldn't be going to the line this much either right?  Do you feel the same way about them?  I think they have a lower usage rate too, so they might have more FTa/g than Harden if they took the same number of shots.  Compared to someone at his own position (kind of), Hardens FTr is slightly above Ben Simmons... (.489 vs. .475) I don't think its anything too crazy. His play style just draws a lot of fouls."
"Big like Klay (Steph Curry) Thompson, shoots like Kevin ""Ray (Reggie Miller) Allen"" Durant"
"Well they're gonna win this year. Why would he miss the opportunity to win another, if possible? Just to have to start over again on another team. Plus..pretty sure the warriors can give him the most money. Also, not like the warriors would trade Kevin Durant for a scrub. "
&gt;The Golden State Warriors arguably played the best half of basketball that they've ever played since acquiring Kevin Durant and are only up 19 to a injury plagued Denver Nuggets.
Kevin Durant is set to star in MeanGirls 2
"Kevin ""Klay (Steph Curry) Thompson"" Durant"
"Kevin ""Klay Thompson"" Durant."
Kevin Durant 
Yes because kevin durant was a scholar
"Not sure if you all have heard this, but Kevin Durant used anonymous accounts to respond to hate online... pretty well kept Bay secret but you could get some great content out of that "

Thoughts on DSJ for Kevin Durant and LeBron James?
He beat an injured Cavs team for his first ring and then Kevin Durant joined his 73-9 team. He's arguably the luckiest superstar of all time. 
Kevin Durant has a pretty cool video series on YouTube   (https://i.imgur.com/2z3b3kE.gif) 
I can’t lie I feel the same towards certain players (Kevin Durant for one)but sometimes when they are hot you just gotta appreciate greatness
"The less Kevin Durant opens his mouth, or tweets, the better. Incredibly ignorant statement. "
Kevin Durant.
"I'm convinced Kevin Durant either gives zero fucks or a twenty ton truck load of fucks, with no room for anything in between. This has clearly fallen under the former. "
Kevin Durant saying dumb shit again. 
He would have a ring or two by now if Golden State didn't sign Kevin Durant. 
Dare I add Kevin Durant to that list? Right before going to the warriors the guy was #2 in the league and blew a 3-1 lead but ever since he’s won two chips and FMVPs it’s like it’s forgotten. 
I'd like to know how much Kevin Durant has learned while he was in College and not playing ball. It sure looks like not much.
Draymond Green and Kevin Durant 
[shut up fag boi i only went to college for a year and didnt pay attention in class at oak hill lol](https://www.viralhoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kevin-Durant-tweet.png)
Kareem  Jordan  James  Shaq  Russell  Chamberlain  Magic  Bird  Hakeem  Moses Malone  Karl Malone  Kevin Garnett  Tim Duncan  Charles Barkley  Dirk Nowitzki  Kobe  Oscar Robertson  Kevin Durant  Stephen Curry  Julius Erving  David Robinson  John Havlicek  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  In no particular order I just listed 22 people I would rank above Wade pretty easily and there are probably a couple more I am forgetting.  &amp;#x200B;
He did go back to school while in the NBA: https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/nba/little-by-little-kevin-durant-working-toward-his-degree/
Probably will get downvoted but Kevin Durant belongs in the conversations at the very least. 
"Actual quote:  &gt;Kevin Durant on Luka Doncic's progression this season. Thought this was a very smart and interesting answer: ""He's playing great ball,"" Durant said. ""Definitely for a 19 year-old to average 20 [points], six [rebounds] and five [assists] is definitely numbers you can look at and consider him for an All-Star selection, but there's so many great players out there at his position so you never know but just his poise for the game, his stepback three -- that's what he wants to get to most of the time. He's big and strong, can pass, can play in the pick and roll. ***He played in Europe last season. The rest of the rookie class played in college. So he's in the second best league in the world learning how to play the game. He didn't have to go to class, study hall, none of that extra stuff the rest of the guys had to go through***, he was just focusing on his game probably since he was 14 years old. So that's an advantage for him and you could tell that he's not shy, he's not afraid of the moment. And he's going to be a force."""
Durant is talking about being 1 year removed from HS to play in the NBA (AKA serving in the NCAA plantation )  One and dones would be better off if they didn't need to have a year of either being coached with NCAA style bball or having to attend classes they know are useless(Swahili?) Just to fit the academic needs.   Some players actually are smart and are just passing classes they could pass in the summer or on their free time. Others would rather play for G-League money and NBA assistants than risk a Kevin Ware incident.
“I don’t go to school. I only school fools like you on the basketball court.”  -Kevin “Klay Thompson” Durant
Just to be clear you are saying that kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook aren't in the same caliber as Pau Gasol? You realize he wasnt drafted a rocket right? like how long have you been watching basketball?
Not Kevin Durant 
How is his whole game based on refs blowing the whistle?  He's averaging 25ppg if you don't count ANY free throws as well as 8.3 asts.  But why should he be punished for drawing contact?  Look at the top 10 Free Throw shooters in the NBA this season:  |Rk|Player|FT|FTA|FT%| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|9.8|11.3|.863| |2|Joel Embiid|8.0|10.0|.801| |3|Giannis Antetokounmpo|6.5|9.3|.701| |4|Anthony Davis|7.4|9.1|.813| |5|Kevin Love|6.8|8.3|.818| |6|LeBron James|5.3|7.8|.682| |7|Kevin Durant|6.9|7.6|.911| |8|Kawhi Leonard|6.5|7.6|.846| |9|Blake Griffin|5.8|7.6|.759| |10|Damian Lillard|6.0|6.7|.904|  Should none of these guys be getting calls?  Surely Embiid and Giannis shouldn't be going to the line this much either right?  Do you think their entire game is based on refs blowing the whistle?
What can Curry do that Kevin Durant can’t?  What can Curry do that James Harden can’t?
"Kevin ""Seth ""Dean Ambrose"" Rollins"" Durant"
"That’s your opinion. It’s a bad opinion, but it’s yours. PG, Harden, injured CP, Capela and scrubs won’t beat the five all stars in GS in seven, no matter how difficult your mental gymnastics are. We’re not talking Kyle Korver all stat, we’re talking Kevin Durant and Steph Curry all star."
unless your name is LeBron James or maybe Kevin Durant.
Has Kevin Durant been mentioned yet?
Strange how that different era didnt stop Kevin durant from being insanely efficient
"Did you even read what the fuck I wrote? And also, Kobe is great, but he was not always efficient. Career 44% FG and 32% 3pt. Kevin Durant on the other hand: 49% and 38% as of now. LeBron: 50% and 34% as of now.   Fuck outta here. "
"Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook."
"That was an amazing read. The sheer number of quotable sentences...  &gt; Well, That Was One Hell of a Ride  &gt;  the gear you have to hit to win an NBA title is not human.  &gt; No, I don’t think you understand. He’s like really good.”  &gt; It’s easy to be an idiot now. ... Back in 1999, it was hard work to be an idiot. You had to be really creative.  &gt; Luke Walton. Great guy. Great, great guy. Back then? Idiot!  &gt; we were kids, man. We weren’t ready for the league. We weren’t prepared for the money and the lifestyle and the pressure. We were a bunch of damn idiots.   &gt;  Winning teams fight. ... it’s definitely somebody. Every winning team I’ve ever been on has had one or two brawls just to clear the air  &gt; That’s all this league is. Win or f***ing die.  &gt; It’s an inhuman competitiveness that you have to channel to get to the Finals. And to win it? It’s honestly sick. It takes you past the breaking point of what’s healthy — mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually.  &gt; Dudes now don’t really wanna fight  &gt; Lebron broke the laws of physics.  &gt; Kevin Love, one-on-one in space with Steph Curry, with the NBA Finals on the line. With the weight of history on his shoulders. &gt; What he did will never get enough credit. Kevin stops Steph not just once, but twice, and forces an impossible shot.... &gt; All that matters is that 10 seconds. &gt; Steph was trying to get open like his life was on the line. &gt; And Kevin was playing defense like his life was on the line. &gt; I asked Kevin about that moment afterward, and he says he blacked out.  &gt; Any idiot can get married. Any idiot can be a father. An NBA title? That’s work. That’s worth crying over.  &gt;  F***ing Kevin Durant, man!!!  &gt; Just thank you. And I know exactly where they’re from, and I know exactly what they mean  &gt; So, yeah, maybe we only got one. But we got THE one."
100% Kevin Durant. The dude is so hot. This isn’t me btw. I’m just a fan of him.
I'm saying that people are allowed to not enjoy that. Some people enjoy fundamentals. Some people enjoy flash. Some people hate penalties/flags/fouls/free throws. So it's ridiculous to say someone is a dork for not enjoying something basic.  Would you rather watch prime Kobe or current Harden? I'd take Kobe. Would you rather watch Steph Curry or Harden? I'd pick Curry. Kevin Durant MVP year or Harden? I'd pick KD. Russell The Muscle MVP year or Harden this year? I'd pick Russell. They were more entertaining. You're allowed to enjoy fundamental basketball and free throws and people are allowed to prefer other things and dislike the basics/free throws.
Here's a list of players to average 25PPG and 60% TS:  Kevin Durant
[His words not mine](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-calls-environment-playing-with-lebron-james-toxic-says-it-ventures-beyond-the-basketball-court/)
Your team is bullshit specifically because it has those players but also KEVIN DURANT. If Cousins is even 70% the player he was...it's fucking hopeless for the rest of the league.
"If Toronto were to get to the finals, I like their chances a HELL of a love more if GSW only had Curry, Thompson, and Green as opposed to having those three PLUS KEVIN DURANT AND BOOGIE COUSINS."
[Who know that these players would be so revolutionary.](http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/65/4/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-james-harden-getty-ftr-110316_640lqph5exsk12vhr09kf9iaf.jpg?t=688696832&amp;w=960&amp;quality=70)(
"Wow, those are some [great stats.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Fuck+kevin+durant)"
"&gt;Fucking Kevin  Durant, man!!!  Wait so he has a fetish for KD?"
Curry. 100 percent. The real question should be Harden vs Kevin Durant  Yes i know what Durant did on the most stacked team known to man. Harden never got the chance
"""The Toronto Raptors have gone 98-0 to be the first completely undefeated team in NBA history, winning the 2019 NBA championship. Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, and Zion Williamson have pledged to join Kawhi Leonard next year... BUT IN MORE IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS, AUSTON MATTHEWS HAS A HANGNAIL. SOURCES SAY IT IS 'SOMEWHAT PAINFUL' AND 'A SLIGHT BOTHER'. IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE YOUNG LEAFS DYNASTY?"""
"And if harden had Kevin fucking Durant, a DPOY, and another allstar shooter it would help immensely. But he doesn’t."
Just checked and Luca is the only 1 of the 4 to have a TS% higher than league average:  |Player|Rookie Season|League Average TS%|Player TS%|TS% Difference| :--|:--|--:|--:|--:| |LeBron James|2003-04|0.516|0.488|-0.028| |Carmelo Anthony|2003-04|0.516|0.509|-0.007| |Kevin Durant|2007-08|0.54|0.519|-0.021| |Luca Doncic|2018-19|0.558|0.564|0.006| 
"why don’t they call kevin durant for carrying? why don’t they call lebron for pushing off on every drive and layup he makes?  superstars get leeway. harden frequently travels while he’s doing his step back, but who cares"
"This decade of basketball was so fun until Kevin Durant ruined everything.  2010 Lakers    2011 Mavs   2012 Heat   2013 Heat   2014 Spurs   2015 Warriors   2016 Cavaliers      Seven years, and six different teams won the championship. Then we got 2017 Warriors 2018 Warriors and now 2019 Warriors is a foregone conclusion. Such a buzzkill "
Kevin Durant a snake ass bitch. He set the play up for Curry so he could fail.   Am I doing this right?
Kevin Durant would be like the face of democracy lol 
"[NBC Sports] Kevin Durant, Steve Kerr prove communism can work in NBA in Warriors' contract discussions"
Harden isn't averaging a triple-double tho. Westbrook won on the triple-double and fuck Kevin Durant narrative. 
Idk why warrior fans are still trying to fight this fight. Just enjoy your rings. This is what you have to deal with because you added Kevin Durant to a 73 win team. Can't have both
This make me love even more Kevin Durant. 
So only 4 #2 picks since 2000 have made an all-star team and only 2 have made multiple Allstar teams. Most #2 picks end up like Marvin Williams instead of Kevin Durant or even Lamarcus Aldridge
"I agree. Title should've been ""F**king Kevin Durant man"" "
But there’s plenty of video showing him slowing a guy like Kevin Durant down in the postseason when he’s been switched on to him. So where is this “size advantage that limits his potential impact” coming up?
"The main point you're trying your damnest to skirt by is that the core of Steph (2 time MVP, greatest offensive season in 16) Klay (2nd best shooter in the game to his teammate) and Draymond (DPOY, all star)  was gaining Kevin Durant while losing role players. "
Kevin Durant and Draymond Green  for AD
"You’ll absolutely go down as the best team I. The league, and the 2015-2016 model is what every team should aim to do. Draft well and develop the young guys together and into all stars. It was the perfect NBA story and your center piece was changing the dynamic of the nba and bringing in all kinds of new fans. You had the best record and the headlines called you the best nba team ever assembled. Shit was real. But then since you lost, KD decided it was okay to join your team. Cap space was increased so it made some sense. Wasn’t impossible. But you just took the greatest team ever assembled and added Kevin Durant. This 3-peat you’ll have to have is like seeing the globetrotters get nba rings. It just feels like such a forgone conclusion. It’s like how Dirk’s ring is bigger than either of the Heatles’ rings. "
"IF IT WAS SUCH A RISKY FUCKING MOVE WHY WOULD THE WARRIORS WILLINGLY LET THEIR TWO TOP BENCH SCORERS, PLUS BARNES AND BOGUT GO?   BECAUSE KEVIN DURANT WAS THE 2ND OR 3RD BEST FUCKING PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE.   Sorry for the all caps, but I think people must need to be yelled at to understand easy concepts "
"Chris Paul, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Dame Lillard add them to the list as well. Luka is having a good year but look at these names and try to convince a life long fan of the game that he’s doing something that’s NEVER been done? You guys downvote and logical comparisons outside of riding his balls. Sure he’s good, but so were the great stars now, the elite stars, they were rookies before as well putting numbers on the board  Lot of kids here screaming “he’s only 19” because they’re only 16-19 and haven’t been exposed to other players of the past... this game ain’t a new sport. "
"You can check my top 20 list. It's a bit inconsistent though.   1. Michael Jordan   2. Bill Russell   3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   4. LeBron James   5. Shaquille O'Neal   6. Tim Duncan   7. Larry Bird   8. Wilt Chamberlain   9. Magic Johnson   10. Hakeem Olajuwon   11. Moses Malone   12. Kobe Bryant   13. Oscar Robertson   14. Julius Erving   15. Charles Barkley   16. Jerry West   17. Dirk Nowitzki   18. Stephen Curry   19. Kevin Durant   20. Elgin Baylor   It's easy to rank top 10-12 due to the names are pretty set and done and you can shift your criterias to match your opinion. But when you extend the list to 20 or 25, things start to get complicated.   BTW, the reason why I rank Bird and Magic a bit low is their longevity. This is purely about being the better basketball player. If you think like what he's done for the game, Jordan-Bird-Magic, these 3 would be the top 3.   Another side note, Kareem's college record makes me think about the list because this is mostly about NBA play. Entire career? Kareem dominated the all levels. "
"All you need to know is on the key possession to seal the game Kevin Durant passed off the ball with 6' 3"" rookie Jalen Brunson on him and gave it to Steph who was being covered by arguably our best on ball defender (Finney-Smith). Like, Durant didn't even look at Brunson when he got the ball. He immediately tossed it back to Curry.   We got punked my dude. "
Brandon “literally Kevin Durant” Ingram is too good
ESPN: Kevin Durant over rules Coach Kerr's drawn plays on multiple occasions. Suggested he should have Curry's role sources say.  
"1st ring you didn’t face the opposing teams real starting Point guard all playoffs, 2nd ring you guys choked and the rest you got because you needed Kevin Durant to join a 73-9 team. Everyone will have a asterisk beside these chips. "
"Kevin Durant is receiving the most unfair criticism in the history of sports. Players sign with the New York Yankees, Real Madrid etc. all the time because they want to play for the best organizations and Durant is the only one vilified for it even though LeBron created the “superteam/easy rings” route and LeBron and CP3 were the ones who rejected cap smoothing and made the Warriors signing Durant possible to begin with. "
"KD could've literally teamed up with his rival/comparison in today's era, Lebron, who share the exact same position as KD, and no one would've cared. The issue with with KD joining Golden State was because Golden State was already a hated team before he got there.  People hate change and having to adapt to new power players in sports, especially basketball. Before Kobe &amp; Lebron became loved, they were hated. GS became a powerhouse &amp; won a championship in a matter of a couple of seasons. Everyone went from yelling Kobe to Curry, and riding Lebron's sack to riding Golden State's sack. Kevin Durant joining them just made the hatred for Golden State worse, and because he added to it, he gets a good portion of that hate."
Carmelo also has surprisingly few.   Games with 35-39 points (active players):  |Rk|Player|Count| |-:|:-|-:| |1|LeBron James|134| |2|Carmelo Anthony|74| |3|Kevin Durant|66| |4|Dirk Nowitzki|58| |5|James Harden|56|

James Harden is not better than Steph Curry or Kevin Durant
I think Kevin Durant
"Great to hear him break down the plays from the Finals!  And lol..  &gt;You know what’s sick? Even after all that, it genuinely pisses me off that we didn’t repeat as champions. I should have two rings.  &gt;*Fucking Kevin Durant, man!!!*"
"Imagine looking your already really good team's 5 starters, and then replacing the worst of them with a top 5 player in the league.  So for the Raptors it might look like:   Kyle Lowry   D̶a̶n̶n̶y̶ ̶G̶r̶e̶e̶n -&gt; James Harden   Kawhi Leonard   Pascal Siakim   Serge Ibaka  or maybe S̶e̶r̶g̶e̶ ̶I̶b̶a̶k̶a -&gt; Anthony Davis.  The 2016 Warriors did that exercise irl when they replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant."
Oh yeah? Name me an all star no.2 pick not named Kevin Durant
"ESPN: Kevin Durant sneezes at the same time as LeBron. Factoring in heated disputes with coach Kerr, KD to LA confirmed."
ESPN: Kevin Durant dissatisfied with how he's being played; attempts to change plays himself.
&gt;8	Patrick Beverley	  &gt;9	Dirk Nowitzki	  Hm  &gt;86	Chris Mills	  &gt;87	Kevin Durant  Hmm  &gt;47	Nick Collison	  &gt;48	Stephen Curry  Hmmm  I'm starting to think it's saying more about RAPM than Collison   
"Yeh, why didn’t harden make sure there was a salary cap explosion last year so he could sign kevin durant to his 65 win team.  He isn’t serious about winning apparently."
Imagine living in a world where TJ McConnell matches up defensively against Kevin Durant.
it turns out that TJ is not the optimal defender for Kevin Durant.
"🚨🚨🚨THEN YOU ADD ~~KURT ANGLE~~ KEVIN DURANT TO THE MIX, YOUR CHANCES OF ~~WINNING~~ KEEPING KYRIE DRASTIC GO DOWN 🚨🚨🚨"
All the have to do is get Kevin Durant? Well that's the trick isnt it?
"Shaq, Kobe (although strange circumstance), KG, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Tracy McGrady, George Gervin, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Reggie Miller, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and Chris Webber were all drafted by smaller market teams and never won rings with those teams.  Detroit is seen to be special mostly because they’re the only team that’s ever won a championship to not have an MVP on the roster.   It takes a lot more than just generational talents, but without one it’s almost impossible. "

"Ah, I see we've put in Kevin Durant-stopper, Corey Brewer."
In order:   Lebron James  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo
would you call demarcus cousins or kevin durant pussies to their faces
"Alfonso ""Klay ""Stephen ""Kevin ""Boogie Cousins"" Durant"" Curry"" Thompson"" McKinnie"""
"He is a good rim protector, sure that is more impactful from a team standpoint but Klay literally broke two three point records this season and had a 52 point game. 22/4/2 with all time shooting vs 15/12/2 with DPOY defense is not a landslide either way, you can choose either player and be fine.    I can't say Gobert is better because he is good at blocking shots and getting rebounds.   And lol at Rudy Gobert being top 12. Here are 12 better players, not necessarily in order  1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Wardell Stephen Curry 4. James Harden 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis A. 7. Anthony Davis  8. Paul George 9. Russell Westbrook 10. Joel Embiid  11. Nikola Jokic 12. Kyrie Irving  And I can keep going "
"Depends, is KD good enough to revolutionize the game and convince Kevin Durant to join his team?  If yeah then I’ll take KD. "
"After Kevin Durant joined the Warriors after losing to them, is this really hard to imagine?"
"The first pick is in 2 years IF the Hawks picks conveys this year - which isn't necessarily a sure thing.   And unfortunately, our situation isn't much different than it's been in years past. Which is, we're seen as a fucking laughing stock league wide and thinking that guys like Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are going to be anxious to play for a franchise who hasn't gotten anything right in 30 years is delusional. If we want to sign guys like that, we need to develop an infrastructure here that isn't us farting in bathtubs, and trades like KP for a bag of nothing only reinforce that to players around the league."
"Not in any particular order, but I’d say: Paul George Lebron James Kevin Durant Stephen Curry  Giannis Antetenkounmpo"
Javale McGee  Lonzo Ball  Kemba Walker  Kevin Durant  JR Smith  
"I could only imagine the ripple effect of a kevin durant announcement in july saying he's staying with golden state. 3 years ago he changed the course of nba history by joining the warriors. this coming july, even with the free agency of kawhi and ad, he's still going to decide the future of the nba for the next couple of years."
"A star? Can they def can’t get an All Star starter  LeBron James (captain)  Kevin Durant (UFA)  Paul George  Stephen Curry  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Kawhi Leonard (UFA)  Joel Embiid  Kyrie Irving (UFA)  Kemba Walker (UFA)  Reserves?   They could get Aldridge, Beal (maybe), Lowry, or an expiring Vucci mane.   Davis isn’t getting equal value at fucking all especially from someone actually playing right now. Their best shot is whatever picks and players Danny decides to acquiesce to. "
"Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan are pretty good friends, after all...  Jokes aside, I doubt it. Wes seems much more likely. Warriors reporters have been reporting for a while that we'd look to add a wing around the buyout period."
What if it’s The second time Harrison Barnes gets shipped out for Kevin Durant Lmao 
Lmfao imagine trading Tim Hardaway Jr and Courtney Lee for Kevin Durant.    Nobody wants that Hardaway contract and the Mavs are fresh outta 1sts. 
cant be worse than what kevin Durant lol
"I'm wondering that myself but to be honest steve mills and scott perry are too fucking stupid blowing smoke up each other's asses to sign a kevin durant or kyrie irving.  honestly. i want anyone who sees this to @ me, the knicks will not sign kevin durant or kyrie fucking irving at all this summer, and while we're at it, the knicks will get the 5th pick even though they're a shithouse without kp.  this franchise is a joke."
someone tell me why the FUCK would kevin fucking durant would fucking sign with the new york fucking knicks after this fucking shitshow. what kind of fucking idiots do we have in our fucking front office that would bank on two max free agents to come to this perennial asshole fucking shitshow. 
"My fellow fans, has a 20-year fan , it is with this day we all share a deep sadness and pain we have been struck down by me basketball gods. But I am here to tell you it is not all lost oh, there is still hope! you see this was not a deal made because porzingis was frustrated and wanted to leave or because they weren't playing him this was a deal fabricated and orchestrated with the help of the NBA.there are a lot of moving pieces going on behind the scenes that will probably never hear about for a long time if ever about what's getting ready to happen to the league. The Knicks will become a super team of sorts next year . This deal was put together with help by the NBA begin the process of spreading the league's talent around more to create a somewhat more balanced. This deal was put together to free up the draft space for the New York Knicks to allow what has already been guaranteed behind closed doors 2 Max free agents to be signed by the New York Knicks.it's also creates a international super team of sorts and the Dallas Mavericks which is a huge marketing piece for the NBA. somewhere behind the scenes the Knicks have already received guarantees from two players that they are coming to New York whether that combination b Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving or Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving or throw kemba Walker in with any of those players I'm not sure but the Knicks already have been guaranteed to top-tier talents this offseason. And for all I know it's certainly looking like the Knicks where was he the number one pick in the NBA draft which will be rigged for the Knicks. I feel you suspect Anthony Davis to go to the Lakers so that will create a strong Laker team Golden State would say the same but they will lose Kevin Durant to the Knicks I'm not sure what Kyrie Irving will do but the Boston Celtics will probably still be good no matter what the 76ers will be good the Houston rockets will be good the Dallas Mavericks will be good the Milwaukee bucks Golden State warriors the Los Angeles Lakers probably the LA clippers when choir goes there the New York Knicks and I might have missed one or two.all of these teams will have a spread of superstars amongst their rosters and that will create a much greater NBA next year. it's a little city of mine don't give me wrong I can't prove any of this but I can see it playing out as clear as day it's right in front of you all of the news that has been going on all of the moving pieces that have been happening over the last two years it's all showing a giant change coming and I'm here to let you Knicks fans know that this may be one of the saddest days of our lives ,  lift your head probably for the days ahead are dark but the sun will rise over the hill and we will have our two Max free agents and possibly Zion Williamson and we will be where we've always been dreamt of being. This deal was fake and planned for a long time now."
now they’ll have the cap space to sign two max deal players next summer and all but guarantee them best odds in the lottery.   it also says (to me at least) that they’re quite confident they’re getting kevin durant this summer
"I’m not saying that a certain amount of second places are equal to a first place, I’m just pointing out that winning at least three playoff series doesn’t get counted as a championship, but it is still a testament to an extremely high level of success on the year.  LeBron had a far more impressive playoffs last year then Kevin Durant did, but the records will show that KD won the championship and the Finals MVP.  Winning a championship is not really that great of a determinant of which player is superior."

"""By now, Kevin Durant has proved the haters wrong""  TIL the haters think he's bad at basketball. "
"Counter point. Portland is a pretty good team that’s drafted well and made a few good trades (Nurkic Mainly). We have a glaring weakness at the 3, a superstar there would make us contenders. Yet did Kevin Durant or Lebron ever once consider us? No. Small markets have a clear disadvantage in free agency."
"Not the best value for NY, but they're now set up to be able to afford 2 max players in free agency.  I have my doubts about whether or not the Knicks are still seen as an attractive franchise to free agents, but if they can somehow pair Dennis Smith JR, Kevin Knox, a top-3 pick, and 2 max players (dream scenario is 2 of Durant/Leonard/Irving/ Butler/Thompson/Cousins) , they'd actually be in great shape, and this is the trade that would have made it possible.      DAL is the obvious winner though.  "
"""fuckin Phoenix""?  &amp;#x200B;  The same Phoenix that Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin rank as top 3 NBA city?  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"Kevin Durant? The guy who gets offended by teenagers criticizing him on social media going to face the NYC media? On the worst run team in the league?  Not in a million years. And if he did come here, it would be another disaster."
Klay is has made it known that he [wants to be a Warrior for life](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/klay-thompson-like-warrior-life/). KD will NEVER sign with the Lakers as long as Lebron is on the team. That much is [made abundantly clear](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25460460/kevin-durant-not-sure-lakers-find-star-pair-lebron). He also doesn't think Kawhi would want to sign with the Lakers either.
Kevin mf Durant.
"If you were a top-tier free agent, why would you commit to the knicks now?  Even if, say, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant had both indicated to the Knicks that they were coming, could you really have a lot of confidence in that?   Do KD and Kyrie really want to come to a team where the cupboard is that bare? "
Kevin Durant.
"Yea, Kevin Durant taking leadership. Lmfao. What coolaid are yall drinking?   Best case scenario for NYK is they offer fat stacks to Demarcus or Butler and maybe trade for one of the mega-contract players like Wall/Blake. Maybe tack on Butler. Maybe they get lucky draw over an idiot like Kyrie.  0 chance for KD. 0. You guys are pulling it out of your asses that he's leaving "
You have to assume they believe they will  A) Secure the 1st overall pick  B) Sign Kevin Durant  C) Acquire another star 
"Yes, I want to diminish the freedom in the market in order to get a better product in return.  I honestly do not care in the slightest if Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis make $50m a year playing basketball in a city they don't like or on a team that doesn't have multiple All-Stars."
I don't think the Knicks will be signing Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant Sweepstakes - **X**   Gordon Hayward Sweepstakes - **X**   Jimmy Butler Sweepstakes - **X**    Honestly it's a good thing we missed out on 2 of those in hindsight. Nonetheless, glad to see our name is still mentioned(tho Winslow+J-Rich+Bam isn't the best package for a guy like KP)"
"I don't want to create a thread so I'd like to ask here...  Can anyone explain me, the Bird's rights mean that a player can sign only the maximum deal? For example, GWS can sign Kevin Durant and then, by Bird's rules that can sign Klay, right? But only for maximum contract or it doesn't matter and Klay can sign even 5 year contract 100 million?"
"1 defense? Tatum wins 2 Age? Tatum wins again by a total of 6 months a day. Whew lad he has SO much more upside with that additional half year to change a franchise.  3 BI hasn’t gone to the playoffs so not really sure how you can compare and contrast on that one? 4 Physical traits? Long boi is similar to Kevin Durant and an inch taller than Tatum.. I want him to be getting boards. 5 Again, not completely sure... Tatum has a better 3% but BI makes more driving buckets?   1 “great” isn’t even beating this 1 “good” player   Did you read my last post? I’m not a Lakers fan lmfao CLEVELAND YOU DENSE MOFO. THE TEAM THAT GOES BY THE CAVALIERS IS THE TEAM THAT I PERSONALLY ROOT FOR. Dear god"
"&gt;Russell Westbrook. Oh yeah, and that Kevin Durant guy should have some good potential.  And that one guy with the beard, I think he'll be alright.  Oof"
"What’s with Laker fans and overestimating their players? Zubac has raised his stock but that’s because they needed him to step up. Even if what you say is on par with the Pelican’s opinion of Ingram and Kuz i doubt they’d be enough anyway. As of now AD is top 3 in the league you really think someone like Ingram who people think is Kevin Durant because he’s lanky will pan out for Davis? Hell no, but i’d sure as hell discuss matters for Tatum who the future of the franchise might just need. Tatum who contributes and is the second best player to a superstar in a stacked top teamed east."
"Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Larry Bird."
Instead of the current pick and roll with some guy named Boogie Cousins while okay shooters Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson wait for a kickout just in case.
"&gt; There's no way in hell we'd have beaten the Rockets without Steph, the Cavs would have been a real struggle as well.  I never said the warriors would beat the Rockets without Steph.  &gt; but Steph is still far and away the most important component on the team  I disagree, I think Kevin Durant is."
"The Warriors are “possibly the strongest” at centre? Did Steph Curry and Kevin Durant die?  Boogie is a bad defender and prone to fouls, Embiid is an elite flopper/foul-drawer. It’s not a contest, Embiid will shit on him. Philly would still lose because of everybody else on the court, but that matchup is absolutely horrible for the Warriors.  Draymond doesn’t help that much either, it’s been repeatedly shown that he struggles against length and strength, and Embiid is a 7’1 monster. Steven Adams consistently dicks down the Warriors, you think Embiid can’t do it?"
Not a big baller. Fucking cowards. At least we have the next Jason Kidd and Kevin Durant 2.0
**Cough Cough**  Kevin Durant  🤔
Ohhhh... I didn’t bother finding out and I always thought it was a “Kevin Durant gets up at 8:30”-esque quote of some sort 
"The luck factor was the cap spike. (It's hilarious to me that the net result of that bit of selfishness may be to deny Chris Paul ever getting a ring. MOST NBA players would have been better off with cap smoothing.)  But other than that - yup, cultural victory.  Imagine being KD, slogging your way through a long and tiring season, watching your team blow game after game because your coach sucks. Get to the playoffs, and your coach still sucks, and you wind up with the whole team relying on you at the end of every game, and people blaming you for the loss, even though it's a team sport and *your coach sucks*.  Meanwhile, you're looking across the court at the Warriors, and even when they're down 3-1 they're still just so clearly having *so much fun*.  It's game six and you're playing as hard as you can but you can't pull free, and it's not even Curry that's doing this to you - it's Klay Thompson, because the Warriors don't rely on that one guy to pull their asses out of the fire.  And you go back to your miserable locker room with your shitty coach in fucking Oklahoma, and then you have to pack your shit and go take them on in the Bay, and it's so nice there, and they're *still having more fun than you are*.  But you're Kevin Fucking Durant and you can choose which team you go to because you're that good that you KNOW every single one of them wants you.  So fuck it. You're going to Golden State. You're going to have *fun*."

Kevin Durant and Westbrook were up 3-1 on the warriors when the Warriors had a significantly better team so there’s your start. 
"...which allowed us to sign Kevin fucking Durant to the team. It was bad luck at the time, but KD is on record saying that he wouldn't have signed if the Warriors won in 2016."
"No problem, Lakers getting Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant in free agency too"
I'm not saying I'm Kevin Durant  But yea

We come together pretty well in our mutual hatred for the Boston Celtics tho? and GSW/Kevin Durant.
"First: Paul George, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, James Harden, Steph Curry  Second: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook  Third: LeBron James, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal"
"Yeah I agree with this.   Ive looked this up in the past: how does Steph Curry do vs some of the better defenders in the league the past 4 years. Matchup data is flawed but still it is what I used and can give us a rough proxy.   Here are the defenders I included in the following stat to see how Steph did in poss vs them: CP3, Trevor ariza, Avery Bradley, Marcus smart, Patrick Beverley, Ricky Rubio, 2016 Kevin Durant, Andre Roberson, Mike Conley, Lonzo Ball, Kris Dunn, Kyle Lowry, eric Bledsoe, Dejounte Murray, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Dante Exum, George Hill   Here is the cumulative output of his stats vs those guys on total:   3830 poss faced vs them: 31.1 pts/100 poss 68.2% TS 21.1 FGA/100 10.2 3 pt attempts/100 poss 48% from 3 51.7% FG. GSW has a 112 off rating these poss   Note on average the past 4 years Steph has averaged 39 pts/100, 68% TS, 26 FGA/100, and 14 3PA/100   The efficiency is the same. And this goes in line with your usage theory as opposed to why his scoring output and FGAs are down. It is also worth noting his free throw's get cut from about 5.3 makes to 3.3 makes/100 poss. Also note GSW still has a 112 off rating these poss which is top notch.   Overall this drop off in pt total is worth noting to an extent. Ive done this for Kawhi, Harden, CP3, Kyrie Irving, Westbrook and Jimmy Butler also and only Butler had a bigger drop off in pts scored/100. But Butler's TS% also fell. A number of Steph looks come off the ball and against lazy or unprepared reg season defenses there is an excess that well prepared and scouted defenses can partially mitigate. Still overall I don't think this is a big deal and the fact Steph stays at a 68% TS is pretty wild.  "
"*”The league said nothing when Draymond Green admitted on the record to calling Kevin Durant from the parking lot after losing in the NBA Finals.”*.    When the seasons over &amp; the players a free agent, hows it tampering?"
"Thats because good teams will double or even triple Curry. Teams would rather double Curry and let Kevin Durant, The 2nd best player in the league go off for 40+ and thats considered a job well done in the opposing teams eyes. "
It’s almost like he also has the luxury to go 3-16 in a close finals game and still win because he has Kevin Durant on his team
Kevin Durant isn’t going to leave the Thunder.
Now everyone want to join the Hea and Lakers? What happened to being competive and going at these people?  ~Kevin Durant before joining a 73 win team
"who knew, adding kevin durant to his team led to more wins"
Or you get Kevin Durant
"Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Giannis (idk how to spell his last name), Kawhi Leonard   I’d put those 6 above him"
"Love was also incapable of posting up any players on the warriors other than curry and iguodala. I watched the games of how kevin love tried to score, he couldn’t post up Durant, green, or even klay Thompson.  Klay’s job against the cavs is to guard Kyrie and curry is to guard jr smith. Whenever Kyrie wanted a pick and roll with love and they switched on defense love was not even dominant on the post against klay.   You can forget about him posting up lengthy or strong players like javale mcgee or David west. "
“Harden doesn’t put up better numbers” uh yes he does. No one is arguing who is a better shooter. That’s not even debatable. But Harden is forced to take more shots because he has less options. The debate of Curry or Kevin Durant taking the shot is not equivalent to the debate of Harden or PJ Tucker taking the shot 
Kevin Durant and playing a team in 2015 where the 2nd best player was Mozgov. Put Doncic in any of these teams and they still win rings. 
*Kevin Durant has left the chat*
Curry plays with Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins   Harden plays with Eric Gordon PJ Tucker Chris Paul and Kenneth Faried   It’s almost like Curry is getting easier shots because their spacing is better and the defense can’t double team anyone meanwhile Harden plays with Chris Paul one minute restrictions. BUH BUH BUT USAGE RATE. THE SCHEME. THE SCHEME!!!!! 
http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career
"When Curry goes down and Kevin Durant can’t lead the warriors “OMG THE OFFENSE RUNS THROUGH CURRY, CURRY IS THE WARRIORS”   When Harden puts up better numbers than Curry “OMG ITS CUZ STEPH IS JUST A ROLE PLAYER. GREATEST SHOOTER EVER!!!! HARDEN FREE THROWS REEEEEEEE!!!!!”  Never change r/nba "
"Curry: Kevin Durant, Kalyan’s Thompson Harden: Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker Harden: 3 more assists. "
"Yeah efficiency requires context, it's not easy but certainly much less of a headache to make only one less three on 57 less attempts than Harden when the entire defense has to worry about Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and now Demarcus Cousins on the perimeter as well."
It happens. Look at the OKC duo in 2008-2009:   Russell Westbrook  Kevin Durant  Jeff Green   Nick Collison  Earl Watson      Finished 23-59.

When it's the Kevin Durant warriors things are different. Beating one of the most unbeatable teams of all time is a good trick.
"Raw +/- is very dependent on team success. If you play a lot of minutes on a winning team, you'll almost certainly have a positive +/-.  For example:  * Kevon Looney has a +/- of 4.5 this season.  * Kevin Durant had a +/- of -6.8 his sophomore year. * [Last year, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, and Trevor Ariza were all top 10 (among players that played at least 15 games and 15 mpg)](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PLUS_MINUS&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*15:GP*GE*15&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) because the Rockets won 65 games."
"Lol:  * 73 wins in 2015-2016, miraculously lost NBA finals  * Swap Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant  * Swap Bogut (5 PPG) for Zaza (6 PPG)  * Swap Ezeli (7 PPG, 46 total games) for JaVale (6 PPG)  * Swap Barbosa/Rush/Speights (42 MPG combined) for Barnes/McCaw/West  * Constant: Curry, Thompson, Draymond, Iguodala, Livingston, Clark, McAdoo, Looney (64% of team’s minutes)  * Never literally anywhere did I mention LBJ so not sure why you got all worked up about him. Why are so many people in this sub incapable of acknowledging that two things can be true at the same time?"
"First question is what is Zion worth? Is a sign and trade with Zubac, additional salary, Zion, and a pick or two alone a fair trade package for AD? I don’t think you need to include any part of the young core if you’re offering Zion. Zion is that valuable. Zion is probably better than any of the lakers young core as a college player.   It would all depend on what Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant are going to do. If lakers sign Durant in free agency, then they can perform some interesting moves to sign Davis over the cap and keep the majority or all of the young core. If we have a REAL chance at a title for multiple years (Lonzo-Kuzma-KD-Lebron-AD with Rondo-Hart/Svi-BI-Beas-McGee as your bench is a legitimate multi year contender)"

This doesn’t talk about the dinner but touches on the Thunder players being mad that Draymond and Kevin were hanging out during the series:   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/thebiglead.com/2016/07/06/kevin-durant-draymond-green-oklahoma-city-golden-state-warriors/amp/
"ESPN: Source /u/TheDanSandwich confirms Kevin Durant would like to play for the Lakers alongside LeBron James.  I almost put inb4 bathwater jokes, but I love lobbin' alley oops to r/NBA lol."
I don't know why he stopped shooting 3s. Feels like he could be a superstar eventually if he gains some more muscle and a reliable 3 pointer with his length and handles making it really hard to prevent him from getting off a shot (like a poor man's Kevin Durant)
Kevin Durant was the player. Tre Maddox was the bird box
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant when he was thunderstruck
"No, he's more Rudy Gay or Derozan than Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant beats Greg Oden in every major advanced stat by a mile.
You think playing with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson makes the game *harder?*
"It's not gatekeeping. I'm not saying someone's not a real fan if they do that, I'm just saying it's creepy and weird. Because it's creepy and weird.  Re: your list of names, though:  - There are two Currys  - No-one calls Kevin Durant ""Kevin"", it's Durant or KD  - There's multiple Thompsons and Greens in the league  - Nobody calls Cousins ""DeMarcus"" either, it's Cousins or Boogie"
Lebron James  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Anthony Davis  Paul George  Joel Embiid  Damian Lillard  with Russel Westbrook at 11
"I mean it’s tough considering he hasn’t had any playoff success although neither has Giannis yet. I’d personally say the consensus superstars in the league are LeBron, Kevin Durant and Curry. After that it can vary based on people’s definition of a superstar. "
"Kevin Durant opened his box of cupcakes and hissed. It was another disappointment, not even 24 hours after one of the most frustrating nights in his career. There was no validation for joining a 73 win team in the bag. He would have to take the hardest road."
"I didn’t watch in the 80s or 90s because I wasn’t alive. I read the book of basketball though and I know a lot about the games history. Still, the players that immediately stand out are Bird, Magic, Kareem, Hakeem, MJ, maybe Stockton or Malone but not really. From the 00’s I think of Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, and LeBron for sure. With that in mind, I think generational talents are really only 1 or 2 players per 5 year stretch.   The next gen of generational talents, to me, are Kevin Durant (being a 7 foot shooting guard makes him obviously one of the best scorers of all time), Steph Curry (best shooter of all time and it’s  not close), and James Harden (completely adapted ISO offense to compete with some of the best offenses of all time, similar to what Kobe was doing in the 00s but without championship fortune). Westbrook is on the edge but held back by his shooting, AD is on the edge but unfortunately unproven (like KG), Giannis is IMO the best bet to earn his way into this list."
Curry is literally thicker than Kevin Durant
"as SI writes, ""As with Durant’s pursuit of Bird mentioned above, “Magic or Steph?” will become a regularly-discussed and hotly-debated topic by 2020.""  https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/07/nba-hall-of-fame-lakers-warriors-rockets-thunder-lebron-james-kevin-durant"

Kevin Durant. I see him as an Alex English type (he just happens to be on a really good team). I just don't think people are going to care about him in the future. Steph and Klay will get more attention.
There’s not a single scenario in which I’d pick Larry Bird over Kevin Durant except in the case picking a drinking buddy.
"With the exception of Kevin Durant, most of the 5+ million are kinda bad besides Al Horford and Etwaun Moore."
"What how tomorrow’s stories in the mainstream sports media make this about Kevin Durant/Kyrie. I can just imagine a stupid, reaching headline like, “KD/Kyrie more interested in Knicks without Dolan.” or some false tweet like “My *sources* tell me a condition for KD/Kyrie to come to NYK is Dolan giving up ownership.”  Smh"
This year’s all star is Kevin Durant! 
"Real talk the tragedy of Kevin Durant is that he's a roleplayer trapped in the body of a superstar. He likes being a team guy, he *hates* the media attention that comes with being a superstar, but he can't get away with it.  He just wants to ball. Jonas Jerebko hustles his heart out and does his very, very best, and he's a free agent this summer too, but people aren't asking *Jonas* about that every goddamn day. I think KD wants that life, but he doesn't get to have it, because he's much, much better at basketball than Jonas. It actually sucks for him.  And people will say that that's why he gets paid more than Jerebko, and on the one hand, yes it is... but on the other hand, when KD took a paycut? Dropped his money to ""very good roleplayer"" salary instead of superstar salary?  People hated him for it even more. He can't actually win. He doesn't get to *just ball*. He doesn't get to be *just* a team guy, even if he's taking just-a-team-guy money and making a point of playing on someone else's team.  If he were slightly less good at the thing he loves he might actually be a happier man, and that's sad."
How fucking funny is it 😂they passed on two generational talents because they “needed “ a centre.  I get Micheal Jordan because he worked on his game but Kevin Durant was 7ft monster scorer who can pull up from three.
"Yeah no doubt there is a difference between the current LeBron and LeBron in 13’. Current LeBron is still the best player in the league in my personal opinion and due to his extremely high iq I don’t see him having a drastic decline anytime soon. I think Lonzo is already a quality player and a vital piece of our team, his defense and intangibles are superb. We was the ninth best defensive team in December with a 106.7 defensive rating. Since Lonzo has been sidelined our defense is the third worst in the league with a 119.6 defensive rating- this data is from the 11th so hasn’t been updated for the Hawks game.   I also believe Ingram can be a stud in this league, I just don’t think he is being utilised correctly. I don’t agree with the Durant comparisons as that isn’t his game, he can’t shoot from anywhere on the court and takeover games the way Durant can. Alternatively, he’s only 21 years old and has shown huge potential on the defensive side of the ball and I could see him being a Swiss Army knife on offense, id say his ceiling is more comparable to Scottie Pippen rather than Kevin Durant. If you compare Ingram’s production to Jayson Tatum there really isn’t a significant difference and we all know how much everyone adores Tatum. You also aren’t taking into consideration the offensive system Ingram plays in, the one we currently have is virtually non existent and looks like a high school coach designed it.   I don’t see Kuzma becoming an all nba calibre player, however I do think he can be a starter for a championship team. He has a great work ethic and has made strides as a defender and passer this year. He’s also had multiple 30 point games this season and isn’t as one dimensional as many think.   I think the main issue is our development and coaching staff not putting the players in a position to succeed."
 Dont forget Portland passed on both Kevin Durant and Micheal Jordan in the draft 😂😂😂😂
I am. Series has a huge asterisk next to it. Perhaps I should’ve said Steph cannot Beat a healthy lebron team without Kevin Durant. Imagine if draymond and klay were out for the series. Lebron still made the series go to 6 games lol. When Steph realized after the 2016 finals he couldn’t do it he went and asked a player better than him to join his team.

"“And your 2019 NBA All-Star is Kevin Durant” The rest of you go home, we were just kidding these were tryouts and Durant is the only one who made the cut goodbye."
Damian Lillard is my favorite player. I do not like Kevin Durant. I don't see what the problem is here.
Yeah so much that he keeps calling it the “all star” award.. “There can only be one all star... and the 2019 all star is Kevin Durant” 
Kevin Durant/Paul George
Kevin Durant is good but he was sooooo boring in this game! I liked the asg better when everyone was trying to dunk on each other.  This shooting a million 3s is boring.
"“And the 2019 NBA Kia all star is Kevin Durant” . That’s the NBA’s commissioner, ladies and gentlemen"

Kevin Durant! Well deserved
Kevin Durant is a fucking cheat code and it's not even fair
"You can't say he's a generational talent in his Rookie year, you have no clue how he'll continue to develop athletically. I'm sure you're new to basketball like 90% of this sub but here's a spoiler alert for you, players who win ROTY have a 50/50 chance of even becoming all stars and even lower odds of being the best player in their draft class.  In case you think I'm lying check out the ROTY's over a 10 year stretch starting 3 years back(since 3 years isn't enough time to really tell for sure how player's developments will pan out.  2014-2015: Andrew Wiggins(ROTY), Best player of the class? Arguably yes.  2013-2014: Michael Carter-Williams(ROTY), Best player of the class? Giannis, Steven Adams, and CJ McCollum all say no.  2012-2013: Damian Lillard(ROTY), Best player of the class? Anthony Davis says no.  2011-2012: Kyrie Irving(ROTY), Best player of the class? Kawhi Leonard says no, Klay Thompson takes a fat hit and says maybe, Jimmer Fredette says 大概  2010-2011: Blake Griffin(ROTY), Best player of the class? Paul George says nah  2009-2010: Tyreke Evan(ROTY), Best player of the class? Steph Curry, James Harden, Jrue Holiday, Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, DeMar DeRozan, and the entire city of Sacramento say no.  2008-2009: Derrick Rose(ROTY), Best player of the class? Yes but Westbrook's non-ceramic knees argue no.  2007-2008: Kevin Durant(ROTY), Best player of the class? Yes, and a generational talent, we're now 1 for 8.  2006-2007: Brandon Roy(ROTY), Best player of the class? Aldridge, Lowry, Rondo, and Roy's 5 year career say no.  2005-2006: Chris Paul(ROTY), Best player of the class? Definitely, a generational talent? Hard to say yes to somebody who's never managed an injury free playoff run in their entire career.  2004-2005: Emeka Okafor(ROTY), Best player of the class? Iggy and Dwight say no.  Bonus Round 2003-2004: LeBron James, (ROTY), Best player of the class and generational talent? No shit, still only 3 out of 11 Rookie of the Years."
Kevin Durant should've just accepted the Slim Reaper nickname. Dude just kills you when you're giving everything you got.

The biggest nba rivalry is Kevin Durant and anyone who has the nerve to ask him a question.
*[WOJ]: Kevin Durant has announced he's switching teams for the 2nd half of the All Star game*
I'd say a lot more people know of Kevin Durant through all the memes on Twitter and insta tbh
"Where he beat Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge; then proceeded to beat Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol; then went on to beat Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden; and finished it off by winning a championship against Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and LeBron James. "
"There has been some reports about the Bobby Portis' trade that I think reflects, to a certain degree, what happened in the DeRozan trade. What is useful is seeing the player's view and then his agent's comments.  This is what Portis said after the trade:  *""They told me how much they loved my energy, my heart, how hard I worked, how much I loved playing for the Bulls. Them telling me that I’m going to be there [through the deadline] and telling me that they want to work things out this summer [in restricted free agency]. We weren’t able to agree to a contract extension [before the October deadline], but they said they wanted to agree to something this summer before free agency hits.  “I think back on everything they told me. All this stuff was said and then I don’t even get notified when I’m getting traded? (pause) It’s just a crazy feeling. I guess I’m getting my first taste of the business. Business is business, I guess. I just don’t think it was done the right way.”*  Sounds similar to DeMar right? They said they weren't going to trade me, then they traded me but didn't even give me a heads up, etc...  Here is what Portis' agent said after the trade:  *""(General manager) Gar (Forman) made it very clear to me they had no interest in trading Bobby and wanted him there long term,” Bartelstein said. “However, like with anyone else, they had to listen to offers coming in. A day before the deadline, he didn’t think anything was going to happen. There’s no doubt in my mind that Gar and (executive vice president John Paxson) were sincere about their desire to re-sign him.*  *I told Bobby: ‘They love you. They want to get a deal done this summer and have no interest in trading you. But if the right offer comes about, absolutely you can get traded.’ The analogy I said to Bobby — these weren’t Gar’s words, they were mine — was, ‘If the Warriors offer Kevin Durant and the Lakers offer LeBron James, you’re getting traded.’ Basically, if somebody offers something the Bulls can’t refuse.”*  It's not hard to imagine something similar happening with DeMar. The Raptors would have been idiots not to ask the Spurs what they wanted for Kawhi when everyone knew he was on the trade block.  Imagine if Toronto asked what the price was and the Spurs said: ""We want DeRozan, Poeltl, Siakam, and an unprotected first"". Masai Ujiri/Bobby Webster would have responded with with: ""No, we aren't giving up all that for what could be a rental"".  Time passes, DeRozan is told he isn't being traded, yada yada.  Then RC Buford calls Masai/Bobby and says ""What about Kawhi and Danny for DeRozan, Poeltl, and a top 20 protected first"". That's a done deal for the Raptors. They agree and get the league on the phone for a trade call."
Kevin Durant played for the Sonics.  That's what always makes me feel old.
"Vince Carter was the biggest star in the 1990's / early 2000's, yes they do.  Kyrie released a movie, has commercials, and has the best selling shoe.   KD would have to be called Kevin Durant, but he's been a top tier star for a decade, they surely do.   Dirk, also been a star for 20 years, they surely do. "
"He has a point, there's probably less than 10 household names in the NBA.  Vince Carter, Dirk, LeBron, Wade, Steph Curry, Kyrie, Kevin Durant, James Harden and possibly Giannis are probably the only players that actually fit the true definition. "
Remember when Kevin Durant told the fan to shut the fuck up and watch the game?
Cue Kevin Durant and Montrez Harrell: “Shut up and be a fan!”
Kevin Durant is a ~~snake~~ man of the people. My favorite Durant clips that I feel showcase his love of his fans:    [Durant catches fire at Rucker Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBsLxqH-0bQ)  [Durant plays flag football at Oklahoma State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBsLxqH-0bQ)  [Article about clip #2](https://deadspin.com/when-you-invite-kevin-durant-to-play-intramural-flag-fo-5855180) 
"&gt;Kevin Durant will be 30 years young in 2019. He'll be the best player in the world. Westbrook will leave in free agency to get his shot at being a number-one scoring option, and we'll all get to watch KD go for 34 a night.  Interesting that he predicted the split, just not the right split"
And they’ll have Kevin Durant by the 4th of July. 
"watch 05 dirk, he was a better version of kevin durant."
"I can’t wait for 2022 all star game, I’ll finally be in kindergarten.

"HORSE was terrible when they did it, Kevin Durant won both just shooting corner threes"
Kevin Durant is Michael Jackson.
"“Since the beginning of the 21st century (or the year 2000 for the less verbose), Seattle was, on average, ranked 22nd in association attendance. In the ‘08 season alone, SuperSonics fans ranked an abysmal 28th despite the regular hardwood heroics of soon-to-be Rookie of the Year Kevin Durant.”"

*Kevin Durant has agreed in terms to a 5 year contract with the Dallas Mavericks*  Cream
I learned a long time ago not to try to figure out Kevin Durant 
"So despite being a 31 year old Male in the not particularly good shape, Kevin Durant isnt better than me at basketball. Not a bad day at all."
TIL I'm exactly as good as Kevin Durant.
"No, dude. There isn't.   Embiid isn't just better, he is way way way better on both ends of the floor.  Maybe Siakam would get in, but he objectively did not make it. And even if he did, all that really means is that he'd be replacing Middleton or Lowry as the worst guy there.   I don't know what to tell you. You might as well say there's a comparison to be had between Kyrie and Kevin Durant. The two are in completely seperate stratospheres right now. "
"14-15: 1st team all NBA, MVP  15-16: 1st team all NBA, MVP  16-17: truly the only time in these 5 years that he missed 1st team on his own merit. It was the first year of Kevin Durant and the adjustment process took a while. He’s TS% temporarily dropped down to an elite 62.5 instead of his normal out of this world 66+ and he only averaged about 25 ppg. WB averaged a triple dub and won MVP, so this is the only year you could truly argue that he was not the best pg in the league, when in reality he still was, it just doesn’t come out on paper that way all the time. (Hence Lebron being the best player in the world but not winning MVP every year)  17-18: Was clear choice for 1st team all NBA , his TS% was even better than his unanimous MVP season. Missing 30 games due to injury knocked him down to 3rd team.   18-19: Clearly on track for 1st team all NBA, only thing that can derail him is missing another 10+ games due to injury.    So you saying you’re going by all NBAs is standing behind semantics. Curry has been the unquestioned best pg in the NBA for 5 years now. "
"Well according to the coach who’s he’s played under his entire NBA career, he’s a point guard. If he goes somewhere else, where he would theoretically play a different position, then we can call him that.  Like right now, if someone called Kevin Durant a guard, they would be wrong. Could he play guard? Sure. But that doesn’t mean I should call him one"
lol false the only reason people hate them is cause of kd.. that last finals could have been the greatest of all time with it being tied up 1-1.. but no you need to add kevin durant to the factor. dumb. did a complete 180 on them as soon as that signing went through

I mean, Curry has one ring without Durant and it was a 6 game series against LeBron and the local YMCA. Harden has none. CP3 has none.   Actually nobody else in contention for TOP 3 players or whatever has done anything close to what Durant did on the Thunder (WCF 7 games, Finals appearance, MVP year)  so ya I give this take a 9/10 dumb"
"&gt; My wish at the moment, all things considered, is for Westbrook and PG to win a ring after beating Durant in the WCF.    I second that.   As for *my* personal NBA dream, is for Kevin Durant to leave the Warriors."

Forcing your team to fellate Kevin Durant is taking over.
"Let me offer up another hypothetical.  You are offered Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Giannis for DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry.  Your GM declines the trade due to his desire to reward loyalty with loyalty.  The team falls behind other eastern conference contenders, languishes in mediocrity and fails to gain home court advantage in the playoffs.  This goes on for a few more years until both Lowry and DeRozan’s contracts expire.  The team proceeds to reward both players with big contracts to finish up their careers in Toronto and further reward their loyalty.  How do you feel about your team then?"
"Dude, that Cavs team barely scraped by in 7 games against the 73-win Warriors. That Warriors team then went on to add Kevin ****ing Durant. There was approximately a 0% chance for them to win those years, and everyone knew it July 4th, 2016. KD is an absolute monster, but he had not half the responsibility and pressure LeBron had, lbh. It's just weird to be that blown away by his performances when he was basically playing on easy mode. We know he can get buckets. He should just do it in the service of winning with anything less than the most talented supporting cast ever behind him. Maybe he will show us if he leaves. "
This was honestly the craziest one I ever saw [Chris Paul being put on Kevin Durant in the 4th quarter of a playoff game](https://on.nba.com/2C7pCov). Dude who's real height is 5'10-5'11 being put on a 7 footer like that. He definitely got a fair bit of help with doubles but the key thing was he kept KD from ever getting any kind of real post position kept him far away from the basket time and time again. Also the first play in the clip [here was one of the most important plays of that entire quarter in LAC's comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opdFzn3teSA). CP3 stripping KD when he tried facing him up and running a pick and roll clearly spooked Durant and the rest of the game he just tried posting up CP3 with his back to the basket which takes away alot of what he can do and what makes him who he is.   
"Only think I remember similar is Tony Allen at 6' 4"" guarding Kevin Durant at 7'.  Credit the individual but also credit the team, it takes team defense to shut down a great scorer."
"Draymond Green kicking people in the balls really helped move the process along, then Kevin Durant completed the process"
"1. Paul George 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Kevin Durant 4. Steph Curry 5. James Harden 6. Joel Embiid 7. Nikola Jokić 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. LeBron James 10. Damian Lillard  There, now you don't have to see/listen to Colin Cowherd."
"The difference is marginal, and besides, that's not what RPM says. RPM says Vucevic has added more value to his team per possession this year than Kevin Durant. More accurately, when Vucevic is on the floor this year, the Magic will outscore opponents by 5.5, when Durant is on the floor, the Warriors will outscore opponents by 5.4."
OP is bad at formatting. Here's what he attempted:  10) Damian Lillard  9) LeBron James  8) Kawhi Leonard  7) Nikola Jokic  6) Joel Embiid  5) James Harden  4) Steph Curry  3) Kevin Durant  2)  Giannis Antetokounmpo  1) Paul George
&gt; got rings and MVP's that he deserved.  he didn't deserve the ring he got when Kevin Love and Kyrie didn't play in the Finals and a lot of people outside of Golden State don't respect the rings he's got with Durant.
Ok fine lets take one Kevin Durant
My picks: MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo  DPOY: Paul George  COTY: Mike Malone  ROTY: Luka Doncic  MIP: Pascal Siakam  1st Team All-NBA  G: Stephen Curry  G: James Harden  F: Paul George  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  C: Nikola Jokic  2nd Team All-NBA  G: Damian Lillard  G: Russell Westbrook  F: Kevin Durant  F: Kawhi Leonard  C: Joel Embiid  3rd Team All-NBA  G: Kyrie Irving  G: Kemba Walker  F: Blake Griffin  F: Lebron James  C: Anthony Davis  1st Team All-Defensive  G: Marcus Smart  G: Patrick Beverly  F: Giannis Antetokounmpo  F: Paul George  C: Myles Turner  2nd Team All-Defensive  G: Jrue Holiday  G: Jimmy Butler  F: Pascal Siakam  F: Robert Covington  C: Joel Embiid
"The main reason is people want LeBron to fail in LA. for fans of teams other than The lakers it’s so annoying to see any player that might remotely be on the move is an automatic lock in going to LA since 2016 we’ve heard Paul George, Damian lillard, russel Westbrook, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and basically any other superstar that exist is on the move. The lakers have been the second best team in LA for so long it’s hard to understand why people want to go there other than reasons outside of basketball. So when their plans fail and they get the best player in the world on possibly the most hated team in the world and doesn’t make the playoffs and doesn’t get any of the players that they allegedly tampered for it is incredibly satisfying to those who dislike the situation. "

"Portland dodged a few bullets in their history, Michael Jordan, Hakeem, Kevin Durant I mean they’re so lucky."
"There is an honest to god argument to be made that the Warriors wouldn't even have won in 2017 without Kevin Durant. Barnes would not have made that shot in game 3, Barnes would not have averaged 35 on 55/47 splits, Barnes would not have been as hungry as Kevin Durant was in that series and nobody was going to stop him from eating. Say all you want about his decision but he earned those rings. "
"Durant probably saw this, called up his momma and be like,  Durant: why D-Wade don’t wanna trade jerseys with me, momma? Mom: cause legends respect the hard choice. Durant: But momma.... Mom: ssss ... Kevin."
"Tony Allen is 6’ 4” and played Kevin Durant as well as anyone.  Defending someone like Durant requires the whole team, anyway.  Allen could rely on help from Marc Gasol inside, and that allowed him to be aggressive at all times, denying Durant the ball, fighting through screens, sticking to him like glue."
So you're saying if you swap Steph Curry with Kevin Durant the Warriors don't beat a heavily injured Cavs team in 2015?
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA.

"Yes I have. Its just for me its hard to value smaller guards when compared to wing players. Kerr also mentioned this when he said players like kd lebron and kawhi are more impactful.  Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins.""  Kerr was then asked by Lowe if Curry would take offense to being ranked below Durant even though the former's long been the foundation of the Warriors' success, but the crafty head coach had a clever answer.  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr said. ""That's the beauty of Steph, that he doesn't take that stuff personally. Steph is one of the great players in the world, two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of how he impacts the game.""  The argument for Durant over Curry largely comes down to size. Curry is a good defender for his position, but Durant is a 7-footer capable of checking anybody on the court. Durant took turns guarding James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving in the NBA Finals, while Curry was hidden on less dangerous assignments whenever possible.  ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
Kevin Durant beat him twice in a row does that count toward “taking it”?

"
"The only playoff series' he ever lost as a coach were against the Kevin Durant Warriors, he had flaws as a coach but he was good at the things that matter the most on a LeBron team - constructing an elite offense that maximizes LeBron's strengths and his synergy with shooters and making solid in-game adjustments and rotations in close and high pressure playoff games. People shit on him mainly because he looks like a fish and due to the Cavs constant struggles in the regular season, but it's hard to get your team to care about the regular season when they know they have a free ticket to the finals every year."

True. All will be forgotten if Kevin Durant joins the team though lol
Kevin durant literally said hes not a leader
kevin durant is on the knicks
"Because he's a leader, he cares about winning over personal accolades, he's hunted by defenses and he has Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to take shots. He's a smart passer and makes the right basketball play. I do miss the days when more games called for him going crazy and taking more transition threes. Maybe if the Knicks rumors are real, we will see that again next year. But you don't get to that insane efficiency by taking a bunch of the wrong shots. "
"So we know Kevin Durant can't win with those cats, but the bigger question remains: can Kevin Love tank with these dogs??"
"3-point shooters can absolutely massacre anyone if they're shooting hot.  Picture Shaq vs Curry. Even assuming Shaq shoots 100% against Curry and starts with the ball, Curry still gets 9 shot attempts against him and only needs to shoot 5/9 or better from 3 to win. That isn't even an especially great shooting performance by Curry's standards. If it's single elimination, there's no way Shaq can get through the tournament without somebody putting that kind of shooting performance against him.  IMO it has to be someone who can consistently hit 60% or more from 3 when guarded by bigs, defend 3 point shooters from deep, and who shoot 3s off isolations on the perimeter.  That probably looks something like a Kevin Durant or a Kawhi Leonard."
"How did this nonsense get upvoted?  &gt;That's part of the business. I think the deal was done long before the summer. I think it was done -- obviously, K.D. didn't make his concrete decision, but I think our organization knew for a while what was going to happen. That's just a part of it. Andre [Iguodala] and I knew it was one of us that was going to go, and it was me. That's part of the business. I have no gripes about it. You get a Hall of Famer -- he's going to be a Hall of Famer -- in K.D. If I'm the GM, I do the same deal.

Kevin Durant way outside... DELIVERS!!   that call gets me so hype
Kevin Durant had THIS to say about LeBron and it will SHOCK you. LeBron HATES him!
And I'm Kevin Durant.
"I think it's more to do with just cycles of talent. Might be entering a golden age of international talent, but it's impossible to predict how things shake out. Curry at 24 in the 2011-12 player rankings was 14 [link] (http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/7532399/nba-top-25-players-25-kevin-durant-edges-derrick-rose-nba) behind Ty Lawson. Turns out KD Curry and Harden are generational talents, with two MVPs on that list (Russ and DRose) - and all those MVPs came during LeBrons reign. Giannis absolutely there with the above, but it's impossible to project if this wave if Euro talent will reach the heights if our current crop. NA doesn't seem to he even close. "
Kevin Durant and Invertebrate Reptiles. 
He said Kevin Durant is his idol and the player he looks up to the most and wants to model his game after. If he isn’t traded in a hypothetical trade for AD. We are gonna keep him.
2018-19 NBA leaders in Points Per 100 Possessions:  1. James Harden - 47.9  2. Steph Curry - 39.3 3. Joel Embiid - 38.1 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo - 37.9 5. Kawhi Leonard - 37.4 6. Anthony Davis - 36.8 7. Kevin Durant - 36.8 8. Paul George - 36.2  
My sources say that Kevin Durant will also talk to his agent after the season. 
I don't care about your rules. I would build around Steph Curry. The supporting class looks like this  PG - Steph Curry SG - Klay Thompson SF - Kevin Durant PF - Draymond Green C- - Demarcus Cousins
"&gt; He averaged 23 points against the Embiid/Simmons lead Sixers as a god damn rookie to close them out in 5; how is that an indication that he's gonna be a mere ""solid role player""?  It's like that's the only line that Tatum (superstar) believers hold on to, he hasn't impressed this season. Tatum gets talked about more than Kevin Durant was in his first few years in the league. Tatum is good, but has not shown enough to be considered face of a franchise good. "
"They have Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green my guy lmao"
"Nah bro we getting Kevin ""Never Fulfilled"" Durant."
"im not kevin durant either, but im from a trashy family and that was our trick to get rid of hiccups "
"Adding Kevin Durant obviously. He’s an all time great player. Adding a player of his caliber to a team that has already won a championship and 73 games is going to make them unfairly good, as literally everyone predicted. I’m not sure what your point is..."
"Is Kevin Durant a GOAT candidate? We’re talking about Lebron James vs Michael Jordan here, where the latter has 6 rings that count as 6 and the former has 3 rings that are somehow not counted as 3. "
"Yall upvote Stephen A Smith hating on Kevin Durant and call it gospel, but call the sub trash for upvoting when Skip hates on Lebron?"
"The tallest possible lineup:  Giannis (6'11"") running point  KD (7'0"") playing guard  Dirk (7'0"") as small forward  Sampson (7'4"") as power forward  Yao (7'6"") as center  That adds up to **429 inches**. Five 7 footers is 420 inches.  I used KD's real height rather than his listed height [(6'10 and 3/4 barefoot, 7 feet in shoes)](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/). If you just used listed heights, then the team height drops to 426 inches.  You can make a taller lineup if you completely ignore position (eg just the 5 tallest centers of all time), or if you allow mediocre players (eg 7'7 Muresan or Manute instead of Yao).  If you want to strictly adhere to positions, then switch Magic for Giannis at point guard, move KD to small forward, and replace Dirk with T-Mac as shooting guard.  Magic (6'9"")  T-Mac (6'8"")  KD (6'9"")  Sampson (7'4"")  Yao (7'6"")  That's still exactly **420 inches**. Still totals what five 7 footers would."
"Yea but you passed on Tatum and Jamal Murray/jaylen brown. Two all-star level players now for some bbb shoes and a skinny Kevin Durant with no game. Zubac is also gone, for MIKE MUSCALA."
"i am Kevin Durant, and there is a small hole in the towel which i drink through."
Ok I know kevin durant is a snake and everyone hates him here. But this is lowkey the best cure for hiccups. 
Thanks for telling us because I'd have thought that you were Kevin Durant. 
"I mean the Raptors are a solid team and imo will outplay the Bucks since they're basically filled with skilled playoffs veterans. But GSW is another animal entirely. Kevin Durant, Curry, DeMarcus, Klay and Draymond.  Sadly I don't think any matchup is a good matchup with that team."
is Kevin Durant
Funny I swear it said Kevin Durant but all I saw was a snake drinking Gatorade through a towel ?
"this only makes lebron look better considering kevin durant is in his prime right now while lebron is 34 years old, and we’re just now making this argument"
LeBron is the most overrated player of all time I think Kevin Durant is 12th on the all time list and have LeBron 11th currently. If Lakers miss playoffs I will be forced to swap them around.
Kevin Durant after his 3rd championship and 3rd straight FMVP will be the best in the game today.  He than goes to the Knicks with Kyrie and wins a ring his 1st year making 4 rings and 4 FMVP.

"What's up y'all, it's your boy Mr Krabs the Based Robot coming at you live with them fiery takes, and today I want to share a little bit about myself with you all. Some of you might know who I am, most of you probably don't, but for those who do and to those who don't, around this community people know me for two things: a.) I'm a Dallas Mavericks fan who believes the name in the front stands above the name in the back and b.) I can, at times, be a bit of a Wade hater. Now, I know a lot of you have wondered, or are probably wondering, how can a Dallas Mavericks fan also be a self-declared Wade hater? While it was easy to get to this point, explaining how I got here can be quite complex. So let me begin by taking y'all back to where it all first started.  In the summer of 2006, our Dallas Mavericks faced a devastating loss to a Miami Heat team that played with a truly never-before-seen level of efficiency. Didn't they fucking shoot like 90 free throws for three quarters, or something like that, in one of the games? Anyways, yes we got beaten, yes we underperformed, yes we were tired and probably dehydrated for like at least a game, but nevertheless, we remained resilient. Avery Johnson said it best in his post-game conference soon after our finals' loss: our team doesn't balk, our team doesn't walk out the door, our team doesn't quit on the game and leave to the locker room while there are still 15 seconds remaining in the game — even if we're ten points down, twenty points down, our team does not quit when faced against adversity. So all in all, you can say I (and probably the majority of Mavs fans) were feeling pretty confident as we moved into the offseason and closer to free agency. I mean, I know I was quite confident, I talked a lot of shit here back then about how we were going to keep Dirk, after all, he did say earlier in the season that he couldn't see himself playing anywhere else but Dallas. May 9, 2007, was the first moment of uncertainty for many of us Mavs fans, that was the day that trucks were spotted for Dirk's trip to Australia. On July 8, 2010, ""The Decision"" special dropped on ESPN. Throughout that night, I kept basketball out of my life, if you needed me, you could call me but I stayed busy making money — you know what was on my mind, all I thought about were hundreds, I stayed busy (bzz) working on myself.  Now, I gathered myself and picked myself up, and I was ready to support Wade in Miami, I was all up in r/mavericks talking about how I didn't want to hear it, how time had passed and we should move on. That was up until the rumors started coming out that he talked shit to Mark Cuban, that he didn't even communicate without fake coughing to Dirk and/or Kidd, that he called a rumored verbally-committed Pau Gasol and warned him not to sign with us. Those were the seeds that planted in me a deep hatred for Wade the player (because, to be honest, I'm cool with Wade the person). This sent me on a five-year journey of hating Wade, I said to myself, the self-titled ""Flash"" will rue the day he left Miami. Now, I know some of y'all will say ""but Wade is a Hall of Famer"", and to those of you who say that, I say to you this: have you ever had your heart broken by another man? I know there are people here who can relate to me, who've had their rival celebrate in a less than unsavory way, didn't even tell any of his teammates, trashed their front office, etc... And I'm not going to name any names here, but at least OKC got a fucking ""thank you"" from Kevin Durant — we got a fucking ""team I formerly shot free throws against"" and ghosted for like four months.   By the way, I'm at that part in ""Blackhat"" where that Asian chick saves Chris Hemsworth — BAGAWD CHRIS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. This lady just pulled out that fucking med kit and got to work. I mean that's real efficiency right there.   Anyways, the next five years had a lot of ups and downs. 2010 was a really rough time for anybody here that knows LeBron James joining Wade in Miami is probably the clearest example we've had in modern NBA history of the league fixing things up for a star player. I thought about quitting the game. I thought about all the work I had done in this subreddit in past years, the countless hours I had put here, making counter-arguments, consistently shutting down Wade fans — but I told myself, this shit is chess, it ain't checkers. I remained persistent, I worked on my game, I studied Michael Jordan, his three more rings, his five more MVPs, his five more Finals MVPs, nine more scoring titles, and DPOY award — learned that he basically has an entire hall of fame career above Dwyane Wade. On April 11, 2019, all of my hard work will finally pay off. Wade is no longer consensus ""NBA Player in the World"". I feel like the Bucks' win is a signal that it's ok for me to move on now. I look back at 2016, seeing how close I came to leaving it all behind... I see myself reflected in Dwyane Wade last night, I was about to quit on the game while there were still 15 seconds left in it, but I didn't walk away into the locker room — I stayed on the court.  "
Kevin Durant would like a word with you.
"Kevin ""best player in the world"" Durant 25 points on 25 shots, -26, Loss    He has zero argument over lebron, Curry or Harden "
"Threads like these are why I laugh when people say this place is better than IG and Youtube lol. 10x All-Star, 8x All-NBA, 2x Finals MVP, 1x MVP, 50-40-90 member, Kevin Durant will definitely only be known as ""a good player that joined a 73 win team and that's it"". Fuck outta here"
"I know they don't give two shits about the regular season, but a team with Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond and Demarcus Cousins on crutches should never play this badly, even if they were missing 3 Steph Currys"

"&gt;James Harden - 0 rings.  &gt; &gt;Kevin Durant - 2 rings.  &gt; &gt;Steph Curry - 3 rings.  &gt; &gt;LeBron James - 3 rings.  &gt; &gt;Russell Westbrook - 0 rings.  &gt; &gt; &gt;Different circumstances, skewed and otherwise.  &gt;  My man"
"Uhhhh good one.   You missed the point: in order to make a super star like Kevin Durant better, only 2 people in the world can do that: Curry and Lebron. It’s not hard to make someone like Gerald green better.   Holy shit you are dense"
I remember Kevin Durant getting flak for his frame and inability to bench press. So basically: don't sweat it.
Yes. They have similar talent by real impact metrics. But what’s funny is that curry makes kevin Durant so much better than how Harden can make someone like Gerald Green better.   But I mean..... let’s be real for a moment: what has harden done in the post season? What has Curry done? Later man ✌🏼
More of a contender than Kevin Durant. That's saying something. We all know GSW will sweep Bucks but we still call them a finals contender. Haha

"I'm not, but Bosh wasn't in the team the year prior. Spoelstra still had to make it work, difficult considering none of them could shoot threes.  Kerr could have sat Kevin Durant for all 82 games and playoffs and still won the finals. No WAY spoelstra could've done something comparable."
"&gt;Kevin Durant was every bit as dominant in the college game as he is now  Durant was quite bad his rookie NBA season; 52% TS, terrible defense, and composite stats (BPM, WS, etc.) well below league average. And he likely improved from that college season to his rookie year.  I agree with your overall point though. In order to be the favorites, the team has to be better than Duke. Duke is about 28 point favorites over North Dakota in betting markets, and that undersells the difference because teams play a lot worse with big leads and that's factored in. A few NBA players might get close but I don't think anyone is making that big of a difference."
"Not possible.  Kevin Durant was every bit as dominant in the college game as he is now, and his teammates at UT were light-years better than any 16 seed, but they didn't even make the Sweet 16.  To be clear, it isn't an issue of NCAA talent being too good for NBA players to dominate.  The worst NBA team would stomp the best college team by 50.  The trouble is you're underestimating just how bad a 16 seed is.  They're not the #68 team in the league -- they're usually more like #200."

"They're both absolutely better scorers. I don't believe they're better all around basketball players. Kevin Durant being on Golden State diminishes any claim he has to being ""best in the world"". Put any other All Star in his position and they'll look like 10x better than they do now. "

Beas was crazy good in college.  He averaged more points on fewer shots in less points than Kevin Durant did in his year at Texas.
"Aside from the disastrous Harden trade, Sam Presti dropped the ball by drafting busts in McGary/Huestis/Perry Jones (bad scouting), and trading away multiple first round picks for marginal upgrades in Kanter/Waiters/Schroder/Grant (also one of the reasons why the Pelicans are so bad despite having immense top end talent). Not to mention he hired Scott Brooks (awful coach) and Billy Donovan (utterly mediocre coach). The Thunder might be headed for a first round exit if they're unfortunate enough to fall to 8th seed, and Presti is partly to blame for that.  Kevin Durant wasn't wrong when he publicly admitted on Twitter that Russell Westbrook was the only redeeming thing left about OKC when he left for GS in 2016."
I was just confused they said “adopted brother“. I know now apparently Kevin Durant even says that but that’s incorrect. Adopted isn’t the same as a very close friend but I’m sure he was just saying it in a non serious way.
"""Kevin Durant meets random dad in elevator"" sounds like the name of a Tim and Eric skit."
"The Rockets might make the WCF and the Warriors will probably win the championship. What exactly does that prove? Are we learning anything new?

That’s like saying “we’ll see if Batman beats the Joker”"

"Kevin Durant is one of the best players in one of the most popular leagues in the world and is compensated accordingly. He makes 65 million dollars this year between salary and endorsements and will almost certainly make more next year. He is not hard pressed for money. If he can’t handle being in the spotlight and the criticisms that may come with it, he is welcome to retire. Lebron was scrutinized much worse when he went to the Heat. I believe the saying goes, “if you can’t take the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen.”"
"He's awesome. He's just a really low-key personality and a little sensitive, *none of which actually makes him a bad person in any way*.  If he were slightly less good at basketball he would be utterly beloved. A quiet, low-key team ""glue guy"", a utility player who can play multiple positions, the guy every team wants to have. Your favourite basketball player's favourite basketball player.  But because he's as good as he is, people judge him by the standard of LeBron/Kobe types. He's a superstar, he's one of the best players ever, he's supposed to have an ego, he's supposed to want to be a leader, he's supposed to be the face of the team.  That's not who he is and not who he wants to be. He wants to be one of the guys. He wants to play basketball and be part of the team.  For Jonas Jerebko? ""He's such a professional. Hustle guy. He's great!""  For Kevin Durant? ""He's a bitch, he's not a leader, he's weak.""  He's fucking not. He's just *not that guy*, and the thing that makes criticism for it so incredibly unreasonable is that you know who else thinks he's not that guy?  *Kevin Durant*. He knows who he is and he's okay with it but people give him non-stop shit for it because *they* suck."

I'm starting to rethink my Kevin Durant bashing from the past. He's just too easy to relate to as a person and doesn't pretend to be some hero/machine. And he genuinely seems to just want to like and be liked.

"&gt;Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko, and Damion Lee are all shooting 3s at a higher percentage than Kevin Durant this season.   ""Herp derp what is volume?"""
"lmfao gotta love when someone asks for proof of something then disregards the proof because it doesn't support what they say so it's bullshit. that's a bit pathetic, bud.  you're only proof of kevin durant being a ""good"" defender is that he was top 5 in blocks one year or that he had the most block in a finals series lmao which was mainly a result of him being a 7 footer that's good at help side defense.  kevin durant has never made all-nba defensive team, but i know i know that's all ""narrative driven voting"" blah blah blah. kevin durant is not this great defender that you think he is."
"&gt; With the Lebron instead of KD the Warriors would only have 2 shooters on the entire team.  Well this isn't fucking true.  Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko, and Damion Lee are all shooting 3s at a higher percentage than Kevin Durant this season. Marcus Derrickson, Andre Iguodala, and Alfonzo McKinnie are also better than *most of the Lakers roster*."
"The Lakers are probably about the same. Maybe a bit better because Durant doesn't need to have shooters around him to reach full effectiveness, but they'd be very iso-heavy.  Warriors are probably worse, but it's not *guaranteed*. Steph Curry is team chemistry magic, and he *might* be able to mitigate the disruptive effect of LeBron's arrival.  The thing is that LeBron has a tendency to warp team culture around him, and the Warriors need players who can just *fit in*. Kevin Durant is great that way. He's okay with it being Steph Curry's team.  LeBron doesn't play on other people's teams, he plays on *LeBron's team*. The Warriors becoming LeBron's Team makes them worse. If LeBron can fit with Curry and fit himself into the Warriors as just *part of the team*, offensively he's probably a better fit, although the Warriors become worse defensively."
G - James Harden G - Steph Curry F - Giannis Antetokounpo F - Paul George C - Nikola Jokic   2nd G - Damian Lillard G - Kyrie Irving F - Kevin Durant F - Kawhi Leonard C - Joel Embiid  3rd G - Kemba Walker G - Russell Westbrook F - LeBron James F - Blake Griffin C - Rudy Gobert  I really thought about D'Angelo Russell for 3rd team be he had a rough start to the year.
Kevin Durant his on another level during the playoffs 
"Do you seriously think Kobe is even better at basketball than Kevin Durant?  Why do we put so much emphasis on ""resume"" instead of basketball ability when it comes to basketball players?  There's no argument for Kobe as one of the best 5 basketball players ever."
"If that's true, what was Kevin Durant doing there?"
"Game 7 in Oracle. Thunder beat the Warriors behind 53 from George and a 30 points triple double from russ. durant leaves the court instantly like a crybaby. while the thunder players are still celebrating, kevin walks back out the tunnel straight up to russ with a smile. everyone including russ expects a sign of greatness in form of a handshake. instead durant straight up knocks out westbrook with a punch to the face"
Kevin Durant was that franchise
"I guess missed games might matter more than I think, but the whole ""better roster, better record"" argument actually helps players. It doesn't hurt them in the voting. Kevin Durant still got 1st team All-NBA even on a stacked GSW team. DeAndre Jordan got 1st team All-NBA on a Clippers team that won a lot.   There's a lot of competition for the second forward spot. Even KD could get it again if Kawhi/George don't. Even if George has been as good as them, it's possible the record could hold him back."
Kevin “American Bruno Caboclo” Durant 
"Giannis can't win MVP. He's in a similar situation with Steph curry and Kevin Durant, where DJ Wilson is stealing some of his votes "
"The Meyers Leonard contract is much worse IMO.   Also, it’s not clear to me how far back we’re allowed to go, but we passed on Kevin Durant. And Michael Jordan. "
I'd say holding   Devin Booker to 5/24 2/6 for 3s 3 turnovers 36/33 splits on 51 possessions is good  Paul Georfe 6/14 2/7 from 3 43/29 splits on 52 possessions  James Harden 4/10 3/8 from 3 40/38 splits on 25 possessions  Kevin Durant 4/10 0/3 from 3 40/0 splits on 27 possessions  Bradley Beal 1/3 0/2 from 3 2 turnovers 33/0 splits on 22 possessions   Blake Griffin 4/9 0/2 from 3 2 turnovers 44/0 splits on 60 possessions   Donovan Mitchell 4/11 2/7 from 3 2 turnovers 36/29 splits on 35 possessions   And Jimmy Butler 0/2 0/1 from 3 0/0 splits on 21 possessions   Is pretty good defense no?
"https://theathletic.com/802440/2019/02/05/silent-star-on-the-presumed-warriors-exit-of-kevin-durant/  Here's the article you are looking for. It wasn't that hard to find. Literally the 3rd google search under keywords ""KD Strauss Free Agency"".  &gt;Obviously Strauss would have to be making shit up or why in the world else would KD be so upset?  That makes zero sense. A player being upset doesn't mean the reporter is lying. He could be upset for a gazillion different reasons. Maybe he's mad his mom yelled at him. Who the fuck knows. That doesn't objectively discredit a report. Only that KD doesn't like it.  &gt;Apparently this isn't the 1st time Strauss has done something like this either so he can't be too good of a reporter.  Apparently? Apparently he did something bad before but you don't know what it is so he's a bad reporter? what? how is that reasoning make sense."
https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/02/06/kevin-durant-thought-hed-been-seen-as-nbas-best-after-beating-lebron-in-2017/  This is the closest I could get to finding the article that made KD upset. Obviously Strauss would have to be making shit up or why in the world else would KD be so upset? Apparently this isn't the 1st time Strauss has done something like this either so he can't be too good of a reporter.
"Shooting percentage isn't as useful of an efficiency metric as TS%. 45% tells you very little. A player who shoots 45% and gets no calls could either be an absolutely awful inside scorer, or an elite perimeter threat. This same player only gets better if they get calls and have a half-decent free throw percentage.  The 5 TOV and 7 APG is a result of him shouldering his entire team offense for stretches. Assist to turnover ratio means different things for different playstyles. If the player is primarily a distributor, then yeah, 7:5 is pretty bad. But if the player is a 35 ppg score-first guy, it becomes much more acceptable, especially if those 35 ppg are efficient. At the end of the day, assists are just other ways of getting points. It doesn't really matter whether the team gets those through an assist or an efficient iso play.  Also, consider that Kevin Durant is shooting roughly league average from 3, has a 6:3 assist to turnover ratio, and is scoring 27 ppg. Unless my team is giving up bucketloads of 4-point plays and free technicals, I'd take 9 extra PPG for another 2 turnovers any day."
"&gt;Are you slow?   Are you?  &gt;Are you slow? KD literally called Strauss out because Strauss was making shit up.  Which part? Prove it  &gt;Strauss didn't talk to KD or anyone in the locker room but yet he wrote a article spouting nonsense about how KD feels &amp; thinks.  You didn't read the article. He gave quotes and asked sources what he thinks will happen. More importantly he never outright said anything about KD leaving. He simply said KD refusing to address the media during those 2 weeks would raise a ton of questions. Negative coverage is not lying. Sports journalists should shit on players and organizations more to be honest but unfortunately they need mouths to feed.  Hell even Steve Kerr admonished KD and asked people to understand his behavior   http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25953908/steve-kerr-golden-state-warriors-says-players-coaches-feel-actors-soap-opera  &gt;He believes Durant should be given a ""pass"" for what he said Wednesday.  ""He was blowing off some steam,"" Kerr said. ""We know Kevin very well. He's been here three years. I think you guys would agree he's been really good with media, with you guys. He's been a great teammate. We all have moments of frustration, times in our life when we maybe don't feel like talking, maybe we're frustrated about something.  Acknowledges his behavior was wrong because he deserve a ""pass"".  &gt;If that's not being a bad Reporter then I don't know what is.  Well it's not because he did none of that.     "
"""If he were a true competitor he wouldn't have joined a team that had just set the NBA record for regular season wins. He wouldn't have taken literally the easiest road to a championship. You're just a biased, ignorant Warriors fan like the rest of them. Bye nephew.""  True competitor. First words.  I'm genuinely not salty anymore but I think the opinion is trash and I see it every day. As if Kevin Durant just accidentally became so fucking good. As if he joined the warriors to be lazy.   He joined a superior basketball team, which is something most basketball players would aim to do if they're trying to be the absolute best and accomplish the highest goal (NBA championship). Plenty of good players on shit teams who accomplish nothing for their loyalty. Plenty of players who get shafted for their loyalty. "
"If only the rockets didn’t have a game today Harden could probably come to Nicks Jersey retirement, and we would have the OG thunder squad back together for a night (Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, Nick Collison)"
"Well considering Lonzo has never been the one to say he wouldn't play for NO, I don't think he's a diva.   Ingram's injury had nothing to do with his size, it was a blood clotting issue. Kevin Durant is skinny as fuck and he doesn't have health concerns. Also Ingram is still only 21 so he still has some time. People are usually in their peak physical condition around 24-27. "
"Kevin ""7-foot Isaiah Thomas"" Durant"
"I am very active, I have plenty of time to spend on reddit because I am not one of the greatest and hardest working basketball players of all time, Kevin Durant."
"I'd like to think Westbrook is jealous of Curry because he misses his best friend Kevin Durant and just wants to spend more time with him, getting to know him and learning about his past"
Hahaha kevin durant is such a bitch
The dunk on by Karl Anthony Towns over the coward Kevin Durant 
"They'll still be the most stacked team in the league, and that's all that matters. That's still 3-4 all nba players. That's still an all time great back-court, just a worse version.   &gt; s Kevin Durant free dunks in the finals   and he'd still get that with lillard, just to a lesser extent. Lillard is one of the best 3 pt shooters in the league too. The talent level on the team would still be overwhelming with dame and KD for anybody else to compete with. It's 4 all-nba players man. "
"Nah, its just Kevin Durant gets called a snake for going to GS."
Kevin Durant is the least self aware famous person alive
"I think that the difference between Antonio Brown and Kevin Durant is the obvious rationale for why they left teams with which they had become identified. With Antonio Brown, it seems like he's too proud to say he wanted more money; Durant at least admitted he was chasing a championship to fill a void."
"While I agree with you if the conversation is being held between reasonable people, if Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson are in the conversation, then Larry Bird should be."
"It's not 'stars', it's just Kevin Durant. Nobody knows why KD wants to go to the Knicks or if he even does but his camp has been saying he will. his best friends works for the Knicks  and the scuttlebutt has been heavy enough that 80% of the league thinks so."
"Curry is a better finisher, shooter, passer. He makes his team better by simply running around the court, getting most of the attention. Teams choose to have KEVIN DURANT and KLAY shoot rather than Curry. Stats show how he leqds GS to wins without KD and even Klay and Dray(his +- with and without them on court supports this). Lillard is great, but he isn’t comparable to Curry. Though yes, Lillard did not have the best teammates these previous years(this year it seems to be better)."
Udonis voted for Shaquille and Shaquile voted for Udonis has to be it   Other ones in the poll  Semi Ojyele got a vote for most overrated player.....who the hell amongst players is overrating Semi Ojyele lmao   The best part was by far Kevin Durant clearly voting himself as GOAT...he really didn't think people wouldn't figure that one out huh   
"Kevin Durant is fuckin bum, if he wasn’t 7 feet tall he’d be playing at the local YMCA. I don’t think at any point in his career has he ever been a top 10 player. "
"Karl Malone left the Jazz and didn't get a ring when he came to the Lakers. He's the second highest scorer of all time behind only Kareem. He tried to jump to the Lakers and did not win.   Gary Payton also joined that team, but would get his ring when he jumped onto the Heat team.   Kevin Durant is going to end up being one of the greats, and he left a solid OKC team to basically get a couple guaranteed rings.   Charles Barkley tried to get a ring by joining the Rockets. He failed to get them after suffering some really terrible injuries.   Clyde Drexler asked to be traded to a contender. He left Portland and joined Hakeem in Houston. They eventually won two.   Steve Nash desperately wanted a ring, and was planning on leaving the Suns in 2012. He thought about signing with either Toronto or the Knicks, but asked the Suns to help facilitate a trade to the Lakers. The Lakers were one of the Suns' biggest rivals, yet the wish was granted. That team collapsed quickly, but Nash went there with the intent to ring-chase.e "

“Richard Jefferson schools entitled millennial snowflake Kevin Durant with FACTS and LOGIC”
MJ is an asshole like Kobe.  Nobody views them as weak.  Kevin Durant is the complete opposite type of asshole.  He's like Trump.

i love richard jefferson but that was a pretty garbage take. Any team is gonna take kevin durant over harrison barnes every day of the week
"""And your 2019 NBA Finals MVP is Kevin Durant!"""
" I wasn’t watching the game when RJ said this, So I don’t know if he brought it up or not, but how are people really going to STILL be so salty about this. Also, it’s the nba not pick up ball, the comparison is ridiculous. “rUn iT bAcK sAmE tEaMs”. Ok RJ. You also don’t have to be from the streets to have played pick up ball- it just came off as a cringey street cred defense to his argument, calling the warriors organization soft for persuading Kevin Durant to join. Didn’t help that the Cavs announcer who sounds like what can only be described as a studio ghibli large toad that’s being english dubbed is the one backing him up. I wish RJ would grow an incredible, luscious head of hair only to go lose it all again and return to baldness. "
"Talent wise, no it wasn’t, they have Kevin Durant and a significantly better Steph Curry on the same team along with Draymond, Klay, and Cousins. If they played with playoff intensity, there’s 0 chance teams like the Mavs, Lakers, Suns, or Magic ever beat them "
"Does that *necessarily* mean he is better though? Kevin Durant is certainly the more plug and play player, and for a 4 year contract you’d probably rather have him.  However, if it’s draft day and you have the choice between the two and have a guaranteed 15 years, I think you pick Curry"
Oh my god Kevin Durant is going to the Clippers 
"According to Steve Kerr, Lebron James is the best player in the world, and Kevin Durant -- not Steph Curry -- is the second best.   On Wednesday, Kerr was a guest on The Lowe Post Podcast and was asked the following question:  ""Do you think Steph cares about that? Steph is the two-time reigning MVP and I feel like everyone has sort of collectively forgotten how good he is. He was amazing in the Finals, he was really good in the Finals two years ago for which he gets no credit. When you say something like that publicly, are you worried that Steph is gonna be, 'Hey, what about me?' Or just doesn't matter to him?""  ""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr told Lowe. ""That's the beauty of Steph -- he doesn't take that stuff personally. He understands it. Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game.  ""But you're talking about Kevin Durant at 6'11"" protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do.""  ""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD,"" Kerr explained. ""Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  ""In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league.  ""And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi (Leonard) is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force."""
"Never forget sam presti turned a team with kevin durant, russell westbrook, and james harden into Russell Westbrook and a bag of fritos because he didnt want to keep james harden for an extra year for already commited money"
"That’s where the investors and tech industry is, not the media/marketing industry. Kevin Durant didn’t go to MIT and certainly can’t program a Tesla’s autopilot for shit, but he can eat a box of wheaties and say they’re the cereal that gives him his shot. "
"Yeah, I’m gonna go ahead and say the same thing I said a few years ago... “fuck Kevin Durant”"
Kevin Durant gonna disable Instagram responses after this 😥
But he is https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/
Literally fuck Kevin Durant. I never post here any more but I hate the fucker. Lil B had it right the first time.
"Nobody would care about his percentages if he wasn’t shooting more 3s than Kevin Durant, it’s facts. Only problem is volume, efficiency isn’t that big of a deal when you’re as good at everything else like he is "
"""Kevin Durant gets roasted by Richard Jefferson! THIS GUY'S A BOZO!"" - Madge"
As long as I live there will be at least one person that hates the player known as Kevin Durant.
Super max contracts can only be made if you’re on the team that drafted you or are traded on your rookie deal. Kevin Durant still makes more money with Golden State but it’s not a super max.

He's stated on numerous occasions he's only in it for the money at this point. The Knicks are the largest market team in the NBA that are coming into (or already have?) cap space to sign him.   Side note: fuck Kevin Durant.
I never thought I'd ever see Kevin Durant wearing those threads in my lifetime.
"As a professional Kevin Durant hater, I simply can not hate Durant in that jersey. Too many good memories came from the Warriors that season.   I can still hate Draymond. "
Curry's injury is a blessing in disguise. It probably secured the warriors 2 extra rings because they were able to sign Durant. Not because they cant win it on their own but know they dont have to deal with Kevin Durant in a series.
/thread  “LET ME SAY THIS. WE HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES BUT KEVIN DURANT IS A LETHAL LETHAL BROTHA.”
Then you better just turn off the internet because a time will never come when Kevin Durant is not criticized for this
I don't understand how people can excuse Kevin Durant for what he did by saying LeBron did it when LeBron's move was a bitch move too. The differences LeBron was on a trash team and going to a team that was capable of winning. KD was already on a team capable of winning and he went to a different team to make winning easier because hes a pussy. 
"So we're just gonna ingore that [Cavs tried to move money around to make a push for KD](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/cavs-tried-pairing-lebron-james-with-kevin-durant-after-the-2016-nba-finals/), because fuck the Warriors. "
"For players with at least 5000 DRB, Kevin Durant is the only one with a lower ORB:DRB ratio haha."
"But it's a bad analogy.. he's blaming the Warriors for recruiting KD if you listened to the full thing   NBA teams should do whatever they can to win a championship, you don't run it back with Harrison Barnes if you can replace him with Kevin Durant"
Do you think Kevin Durant is known for his slashing ability? 
"No need for name calling. That being said, that team is unstoppable because Curry is on it. His gravity and range create all the opportunities. The hail of backdoor cuts and screens? All for the Curry system. The new emphasis on 3pt shooting in the league to win championships? Curry. Kevin Durant wanting to come? Because Curry was there. Don't be naive."
&gt;He would have gone the way of Kevin “the hardest road” Durant joining a stacked team that could guarantee him a good shot at Titles.  Aka what he did when he went to Miami. Then Wades knees and the team fell apart so he went back to Cleveland to firm a new big 3. It's exactly why he went to Cleveland. 
"Klay stays in the Bay. Makes sense, too. No discussion here.  Kevin Durant wanted rings and he got 2 with one likely on the way. He will have checked that box for sure. Now, it is time to get paid big and turn an organization around. With the Knicks likely to obtain Zion, and as others mentioned Kyrie lingering, it further makes sense he goes to New York......... the writing is on the wall.  Lastly, these assuming articles are getting old. So much speculations it’s hardly journalism and some of them a trash grammar and puking guesses... I must have fallen asleep when we made this crap our form of journalism."
curry's competition is only the pretty weak fucking LeBron James and also the pretty weak Kevin Durant

Knicks  - easier confrence - might get kevin durant
"That's somewhat true but that wasn't really controllable and you can't blame the Warrior fans to really sympathize too much about that, they were a great team that year and yes it would have been completely different if the Cavs were healthy but it was still a hell of a series. The next year the series got tied up 1-1 and we were all prepared for the legendary third year. Tie breaker of champions. But no, Kevin Durant had to ruin everything so many basketball fans were looking forward to. At least if your team sucked there was something to be excited for. That all went to shit when KD decided ""oh i want to win ezpz let me go to one of the greatest teams ever assembled"" "
"I don’t think people will ever put you guys in that category without an asterisk next to it... besides other warrior fans. The team you guys have isn’t organic and isn’t exciting to anyone, it’s obvious you guys are going to win it and there’s no suspense to see if they’ll actually be a legendary team because it’s so fucking obvious. You guys were 73-9 and then added the second best basketball player in the world who could arguably be a top 10 talent of all time.. it just isn’t exciting at all as a basketball fan and as a competitor. It’s not even a jealousy thing like a lot of people try to claim.. if you guys never added Kevin Durant I’d be all about seeing a legacy born, but this legacy felt crafted and not enjoyable to see from a historical standpoint and I think a lot of people will feel that way in the future. "
which is a pretty meaningless way to determine this.   Is Kevin Durant the Center when he is on the court with Draymond and 3 guards? 
"I'm sure.. but don't you kind of wish the organic big 3 of steph, green, and klay just continued to write their own legacy without the addition of kevin durant which obviously tipped the scale in your favor? "
"They're also just pretty stacked, tbh. You can say for guys like Klay or Draymond who have holes in their game but play their roles well are elevated for sure but Kevin Durant is the alleged second best player since 2010 and people had been calling Boogie Cousins the best offensive center in the NBA until he got hurt. Not to mention having guys like Shaun Livingston and Angre Iguodala come off the bench at times when they were starting caliber players beforehand.   They're stacked, doesn't mean Curry isn't an amazing player."
"Steph has a slightly higher TS%, KD has a slightly higher PPG. WS/48 is basically a wash. They're both very good in the playoffs, but I wouldn't say KD has definitively been better than Curry. [Head to head playoff stats] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players)"
"He’s not saying Kawhi will be too 10 all time lmao. He’s saying if this guy who’s already a perennial top player with a championship and FMVP over one of the best teams ever manages to not only beat THIS warriors team but *shut down* Kevin Durant *and* Giannis in a different series while adding another FMVP and Championship to his belt as well as likely the greatest playoff run and performance ever, he’d be seen as top 10.   If that sounds ludicrous it’s because it is, lol. It’s not gonna happen"
Who the hell is comparing lebron to durant? Take out the warriors and the 2015 cavs and miami team were the most stacked team in the nba. Lebron went to the cavs because they had kyrie and he knew they we’re going to get another all star in kevin love ala another new and improved big three. FOH.
'Slytherin' Kevin Durant
He wouldn’t have gone to Cleveland if his goal was to win as many rings as possible.   He would have gone the way of Kevin “the hardest road” Durant joining a stacked team that could guarantee him a good shot at Titles.
"Top 10 last 20 years (excluding MJ):  LeBron   Shaq   Tim Duncan   Kobe   Stephen Curry   Kevin Durant   Dirk   Steve Nash   Kevin Garnett   Dwyane Wade  Did not make the cute: Paul Pierce, Chris Paul, Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, Dwight Howard.  TBD: Giannis, Harden, Kawhi, AD, Kyrie, Westbrook.  Ask again in 10 years who the best 10 of the past 30 years, some of these^ dudes are gonna be on that list."
not gonna use past players because they're all old as fuck and I'm assuming they're gonna want to play this game right away so chemistry probably matters.  - Steph Curry - Klay Thompson - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Kevin Durant - Draymond Green  basically the best lineup in the NBA the death lineup with Giannis subbed in for Iggy. I'm sure he will fit in fine without ruining the chemistry. 
Ok but also Kevin Durant is a top 5 scorer all time one of the biggest threats ever from anywhere on court and he’s in his prime

"I didnt reply to you, I replied to the guy who said Kevin Durant going to the Knicks was obvious "
Why do you sound so confident Kevin Durant would want to join the worst team in the NBA 
"Are you serious? Steph won one championship without Kevin Durant, and it happened when we were without Kevin Love and Kyrie. It's far from guaranteed that he would just roll through the playoffs without KD"
"Nah, it has everything to do with Kevin Durant making literally the softest move in NBA history "
"We're posting on west coast time, I kind of expected it. I stand by what I said though, I'm sick of the Warriors, Kevin Durant, and the whole juggernaut. I want an open Western Conference, And that means Steph being the guy and getting beat in the playoffs. "
"Because he played in a league with Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry"
Funny how people like you forget that the warriors didnt start out as an all star team. Steph helped klay and draymond become all stars. his willingness to be part of the team rather than the star of the team led them to a championship before they got one free agent named kevin durant. They are not stacked to begin with. They worked their asses off to become a stacked team.
"Well....we want Kevin Durant lmao. We got Ewing, you got Curry. KD will be the deciding factor of our argument.   !RemindMe 3 months"
"Steph curry, klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant. 3 people you can put on any team with any system and make them better. So obviously that means this team is adapted to Draymond."
"Rondo is a better passer, rebounder and defender than Kevin Durant. Is he better than Kevin Durant? "
"Yeah, you're so off it's disgusting. They had no business being on the flagship program of the biggest sports channel ever.  Imagine working 10 hours at a manual labor job to come home and watch sports center before having some supper, and rather than the highlights of the 6 baseball games already played in the day, you get Jemele interviewing Kevin Durant about his opinion on today's hip hop scene.  Imagine the prime time spot going to two idiots that spend more time talking about the president than sports.....on the **entertainment and sports programming network**  It was a joke, bullshit, trying to stay relevant and hip with the younger crowd. We want ESPN, if I wanted trash news I'd head over to Vice.   We'll never get back to Craig Kilborn, Stuart Scott, Chris Berman, those elite days, but SVP is what old school ESPN represented and is doing an amazing job right now.  If you don't see a difference between the quality of work that Scott Van Pelt puts out vs the shit that Michael and Jemele spewed, I refuse to humor your banter."
"They lost Kevin Durant 2 years ago for nothing....  When Cleveland lost Lebron for nothing, they went from 61 wins to 19. OKC went from 55 to 47 wins losing Durant. How is that disappointing???"
"Meh, what happened to Durant in 2013 was far worse IMO  |Player||Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|MP|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Durant|2012-13|24|OKC|NBA|SF|38.5|.510|.416|.905|7.9|4.6|1.4|1.3|3.5|28.1|.647|    |Player|Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|PER|WS|WSp48|VORP|BPM| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Durant|2012-13|24|OKC|NBA|SF|28.3|18.9|.291|7.6|7.7|         Statistically, he averaged 28/8/5 on 50/40/90. He had the most efficient high volume scoring season in league history while playing in a dysfunctional offensive system with a head-coach who literally became a meme for his inability to coach offense, a point guard that took the name of his position literally, and a lineup starting the scattered remains from the corpse of Kendrick Perkins at center. Oh they also traded away their 2nd best scorer and a future MVP that offseason.     Yet OKC somehow actually improved and ended up with the best offense in the league and a top 30 offensive rating all time thanks in large part to Durant, who's +11.2% relative TS ranked as the highest ever for a high-volume scorer(league average 53.5, KD 64.7).  His WSp48 was top 20 all time. His Win Share total was 12th best all time. He became the 7th player in history to join the 50/40/90 club and only the 2nd to do it averaging 25+ ppg(Bird)          Defensively they were also elite(ranked 4th), particularly in the paint as KD developed into a legitimate rim protector and combined with Ibaka to form the best shot blocking duo in the league. OKC ended up blocking the 2nd most shots in regular season history and KD became just the 4th player to ever block 100 shots, have 100 steals, and make 100 3's in a season.   OKC ended the season with the 7th best MOV in NBA History behind only the 92, 96, 97 Bulls, 86, 08 Celtics and 87 Lakers, all 6 of which are widely considered among the best ever. Their SRS, 9.21, ranked 5th highest only behind those Bulls teams and the 08 Celtics.       Durant had an all time great regular season, his team won 60 games, and were ranked by most advanced metrics as one of the top 10-15 regular season teams of all time, which is pretty remarkable when looking at their roster as it was mostly a bunch of specialists and/or role players with major deficiencies in their game.     |Rk||Age|G|MP|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS/G|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Russell Westbrook|24|82|34.9|.438|.323|.800|5.2|7.4|1.8|0.3|3.3|23.2|.532|   |5|Thabo Sefolosha|28|81|27.5|.481|.419|.826|3.9|1.5|1.3|0.5|0.8|7.6|.617| |4|Serge Ibaka|23|80|31.1|.573|.351|.749|7.7|0.5|0.4|3.0|1.6|13.2|.612|   |5|Kendrick Perkins|28|78|25.1|.457|.000|.611|6.0|1.4|0.6|1.1|1.4|4.2|.479|   |9|Reggie Jackson|22|70|14.2|.458|.231|.839|2.4|1.7|0.4|0.2|0.8|5.3|.531| |4|Kevin Martin|29|77|27.7|.450|.426|.890|2.3|1.4|0.9|0.1|1.3|14.0|.608| |7|Nick Collison|32|81|19.5|.595|.000|.769|4.1|1.5|0.6|0.4|0.9|5.1|.624| |8|Derek Fisher|38|24|14.4|.333|.351|.933|0.9|0.7|0.6|0.0|0.5|4.1|.478|      Durant's season would have won MVP in the vast majority of other NBA seasons, with a handful of exceptions being some peak years by Jordan, LeBron, Shaq, Wilt, Kareem, and maybe a couple by Bird/Magic. It was right on the verge of being an all time great regular season, yet not only did he not win MVP, he didn't get a single 1st place vote.        Note: Keep in mind that raw stats even from the early 2010's aren't easily comparable to today as scoring was far more difficult and the league was far more defensive minded. Pace of play was much slower, which mean reduced scoring/rebounding/assist opportunities and shooting efficiency was substantially lower in comparison with these last 3 years as today's 8 second offense has replaced defensive effort in the regular season.      "
Your 73 win team had to cry in a parking lot for Kevin Durant after the immense bottle job that was 2016. Don't be talking shit when you can't win one more finals game as the best team in history.
"I never said he wasn't a competitor, or that his main focus in TDs. But that IS a focus of his and he DOES chase them EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, playing the exact same way.    And the fact is every player you listed would be rated higher if their team actually won. Many people dont consider Lebron the best player in the league, where he was consensus last year. And he had a proven track record of greatness without Kevin Durant.   All the accolades you mentioned are true, and imo he was a top 5 player in 2016. But he hasn't been near that level since then."
Kevin durant with 7 freaking shots?!?!
And Paul George stopped being Kevin Durant post All-Star break
"Kevin Durant knows he's the best in the league, so I'm fine with that"
You have the self-awareness of Kevin Durant
"Anyone care to explain to me how Paul George deserves 1st team over Durant?   |Rk|Player|Season|MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|2P|2PA|2P%|eFG%|FT|FTA|FT%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Kevin Durant|2018-19|34.9|9.3|18.0|.518|1.8|5.1|.354|7.5|12.9|.583|.568|5.8|6.6|.885|6.5|5.8|0.7|1.1|3.0|26.3|.629| |2|Paul George|2018-19|36.8|9.2|20.9|.440|3.8|9.8|.387|5.4|11.1|.487|.531|5.9|7.1|.836|8.2|4.1|2.2|0.5|2.7|28.0|.588|    So KD clearly has the best numbers between the 2. Additionally he's the 2 time FMVP and the best player on the best team in NBA history. Meanwhile George is playing for a team that's going to end up the 7th or 8 seed and will likely fail to reach 50 wins for the 2nd year in a row, which is relevant because that same Thunder team was a perennial 60 game winner and title contender with Durant in place of George. So you're telling me that PG13 deserves all nba over the 2X reigning FMVP who's the best player on the league's premier team and is putting up better stats despite coasting? In addition to this, George would be seemingly rewarded for his inability to elevate said players old team to anywhere close to the same level as it was with said player before Seriously?    "
MVP &gt; Finals MVP. Unanimous MVP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finals MVP. 73 wins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin Durant.
Kevin Wayne Durant 
Depends. I think Kevin Durant is destined to prove himself on his new team as the BITW
"Yes, he is the better 2 way player. Size really matters in the nba. To quote Steve kerr.Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
"""I had no idea that the other 120 voters voted for LeBron James.  I thought Kevin Durant would get votes, I thought Kobe Bryant would get votes, I thought Chris Paul would get a few votes.""  This is what he said to defend himself.  The fact that he thought other people would be voting for KD, Kobe, CP3, and Melo just shows how stupid he is.  Literally nobody voted for anyone but LeBron and this guy thought it was a 5 man race."
"Meh, this isn't that bad.   &gt; How the fuck can anybody with a brain put DeRozan on the all nba tea and not Aldridge... like what?  they play different positions, and positions matter for all-nba. There's way less competition at guard this year than forward.   Gallo &gt; Lebron is fine, if you think there's a games played threshold you have to hit. Gallo &gt; Aldridge is defensible, too, given Gallo's versatility.    Demar &gt; Kemba/Klay/Fox/Beal/Holiday is head scratching, but it's not totally out of the blue. I understand if voters break ties by looking at team performance, which seems like what happened in this case.   &gt; left Myles Turner off the all defense team.  positions matter for the all-defense team as well. Embiid &gt; Turner and Gobert &gt; Turner are totally defensible.   &gt; Put Kevin Durant on the all defense team despite him not trying whatsoever this season.  That's not really fair. KD is generally pretty engaged on defense -- the real slackers on the warriors are Draymond and Iguodala. It's a little puzzling for him to be here, but also there are very few elite defensive 3s in the game right now. I don't think there's an obvious candidate for that spot in lieu of KD.   &gt; Put Joe Ingles in the honorable mentions of his all defensive teams  Yeah he's a good defender. He's not elite, but again, there are very few elite wing defenders.  "
Kevin “the hardest road” Durant:  “Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Warriors? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!”— the day OKC went up 3-1 over GS.
"Warriors trying to get the best team possible is what every single team wants to do. Kevin Durant wanting to join the best team possible is,well more hated by fans and players"
The Warriors have the right to improve. Kevin Durant also has the right to make a decision. But joining up with the team that beat you to go to the Finals in a seven game series isn't exactly the cleanest decision to make. It was a snake move. 
.. yeah most people could make a primetime highlight crazy bounce pass OVER Kevin Durant while Gianni grabs it without having to break stride or adjust much. So EASY!    /s

Popular players at the moment (there’s a lot of them so here’s just a few of them):  LeBron James  Stephen Curry  James Harden Kevin Durant Russell Westbrook (my favorite player) Joel Embiid (my second favorite player) Giannis Antetocoumpo (front runner for             MVP) Paul George Anthony Davis   And of course some players from history: Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Shaquille O’Neal Magic Johnson   I know I listed a lot of players, but they’re all pretty big "

"&gt; Draymond is a post-dimer which mean he can lead the offense and even runs the ball up court sometimes, while Perkins and Ibaka can only block or spot-up shoot.   That's why they're the bizzaro versions. The fix the flaws of Kevin Durant playing with guys like Westbrook, Harden and Ibaka. I added the comparisons to explain my point further."
I think they need to reboot after this season.  Re-sign Durant obviously and then try to trade Draymond for a Kevin Love.
Sad no ring :(  Freakin Kevin (Durant) amirite?
Yeah I don't think trading one on one baskets with Kevin Durant is ever a good idea. It's not a sustainable way to win
"r/nba is not a representative sample of basketball viewers. You have a ton of casual fans who would never step foot in here, who aren't watching because Lebron isn't in the playoffs. Then there are the casual casual fans who can only name Lebron, and can't even identify Steph Curry or Kevin Durant by name but know about ""the Warriors."" I know a ton of people like the latter group.  Also, I wonder if ratings are down because of time zone issues. Having the usually big-draw Warriors play against another California team really makes it hard for the Eastern seaboard to catch those games. I imagine that if the Warriors move on to the next round against Houston, things will pick up.   The real wild card is what would happen if Golden State dropped off. The Bucks are really good and Giannis has been really marketed for the first season of his career, but their Q rating is still nowhere near that of the Lebron Cavs.   To get a sense of ratings, you have to get out of the core NBA fans, who will watch no matter what, which is probably 97% of this sub. The general public is much more fickle and would probably not watch a Houston-Toronto or Houston-Milwaukee or Portland-Philly final even though they would be pretty interesting. I think a Golden State-Boston or Golden State-Philadelphia final would probably have the best draws. You get that sweet Pacific and Eastern time zone split."
"There is no coach in the league that can make Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Kyle Korver, old JR Smith, old Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye play good enough defense against an offense led by Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson. It simply ain't happening.   The Cavaliers roster acquisitions were made with a 100% offense-first mentality and it resulted in the best NBA offense in the history of the league in the 2017 playoffs. Without KD's signing, they'd have had at least 3 if not 4 uber competitive finals series."

"we're gonna witness the most incredible thing and see James Dolan somehow get Kevin Durant, Kyrie irving, and Zion Williamson in the same damn offseason. lmao."
so cj is on par with kevin durant and paul george now huh?  pretty sure we're done here.
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/paul-george-says-kevin-durant-sold-him-on-okc-that-place-will-blow-you-away/  Yeah but that could have been him saving face after the burner account incident. I think it's more likely that KD was more truthful on his burner account than he was as actually KD.
"&gt;How is he insecure?  I have a story for you:   I was visiting my friends in San Fran in July and we were having a beer on a patio when I got into an argument with them about how KD took the easiest path to a championship. I said KD was just trying to manage his legacy, blah blah blah.  Next thing I know there's this skinny shadow over our table. And this voice says, ""Imagine having Russell Westbrook on your team and you are the real MVP and he never let you have the ball at the end of the game. How would that make you feel?""  But when I looked up there was no one there.  Couple days later we were at Harlot in SoMa and I was talking to this girl who was a Dubs fan. I asked her who KD played for before Golden State and she didn't know, so I started teasing her and calling her a bandwagoner just like KD. Then I felt a chill in the air. From just over my shoulder I heard the same voice: ""Champions cannot be bandwagoners. They drive the world forward. They are the leaders and iconoclasts who history will remember.""  But when I turned around I only glimpsed a tall man in a trenchcoat running for the door. He threw a cupcake at my head and disappeared.  It gets weirder. Back in Toronto my uncle was talking to my dad about the upcoming season. My dad said KD just needed the right situation to shine. My uncle said coaching wasn't that important.  The phone rang. My uncle picked up and heard a voice say ""Billy Donovan was not a playoff coach and he was lucky to have Kevin Durant even for a brief period of time. Kevin Durant transcends coaching like the Sistine Chapel transcends time, but coaching can be a valid reason to dislike a situation. Go look on reddit and see how they make fun of Scott Brooks's secret plays. You will see that coaching is a vital reason to leave but also not important when considering Kevin Durant's legacy.""  My dad said he looked outside and a tall skinny man was talking into a banana. Then the man jumped into the bushes.  My buddy in Denver said he made a joke on the /r/nuggets sub about KD, and some guy named doodoojump started giving him a hard time and wouldn't leave him alone. He said he started getting phone calls in the middle of the night. First there was heavy breathing, then someone would say ""That's messed up"" before hanging up.  Hell, go check out Charles Barkley's interview on the Today Show last week. He said KD's ring wasn't as impressive as other ones. Someone starts heckling him from the audience. ""At least KD has a ring! Kevin Durant is a champion which you will never be! He was the Finals MVP and he scored 35 points per game on 70% true shooting and analytics are very important and you don't understand them because there is no championship for eating churros!"" The camera pans and you see security trying to take out this seven-foot-tall woman in a pink wig.  People started saying it's just an urban legend, KD can't possibly be everywhere at once, listening and waiting for people to criticize him. But the next time you need to reach something off a high shelf, and you don't have a chair nearby, just turn off the lights and whisper ""KD's soft"" three times. He'll show up right away."
"f there is a player petty enough to renegade on a below the table handshake deal just to spite the ""national media""...its fuckin Kevin Durant"
"If there is a player petty enough to renegade on a below the table handshake deal just to spite the ""national media""...its fuckin Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant needs everything the Knicks have to offer.
"Then a KD sign-and-trade to Boston makes more sense no? Why is the NYK rumour so heavily bought into when it's just been Begley pushing a narrative for the season?  [“It’s not impossible for the Celtics to get their hands on Kevin Durant this offseason,” Windhorst said.](https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2019/03/07/windhorst-proposes-st-deal-that-would-bring-kevin-durant-to-boston/)    But going back to the original point. We've been told for years now by ESPN that KD and Kyrie's moves were motivated by their legacies.      Are we supposed to just now accept everything in the past ESPN told us was wrong but *this time* they're definitely right?"
"So NYK is banking on Kevin Durant making a dumb decision?  That's kind of my point. In order for this NYK scenario to play out both guys have to go against any sort of logic to sign.   If they want to compete and a cement a legacy then NYK really isn't the place to go because the team won't have any cap space after signing them and the ring-chasing pool is nowhere near as good as Reddit seems to think.    Their rotations would be:  Guard| Forward | Centre ---|---|---- Irving| Durant| Robinson Smith | Knox|  Nktilikina  |Ellenson |  Trier | |  +1 rookie who may or may not pan out.   That team isn't a finals competitor, and no amount of ring chasers will make change that.  KD might be a weirdo, but he's still an NBA player. He's seen them play, he's played against them. He knows the Knicks suck ass.  * KD could go to Brooklyn, live in the same city, play for a team that is objectively better than the one I listed above.  * Alternatively, he could go to the Clippers, start up an LA-based rivalry with Lebron and be the reason LAC edge out GSW next playoffs rather after their impressive performance this year. * Hell, if Utah waived Rubio and Favors they could offer him a max deal.  * Shit, he and Kawhi could be dealt in a sign and trade if he wanted to go hang out with Drake.  * Or he could just join LAbron and prove he's better than Bron by playing alongside him, like you said he ""went to the bay and thought he could usurp steph"".  If KD signing with NYK is really just about him being an unpredictable dumbass who wants out of GSW then there's still a whole bunch of better options he could take besides NYK.  This isn't like Lebron and Wade joining up in Miami, because Lebron was joining a fully formed team with depth and a supporting cast.  Everyone talks about KD wanting to play with Kyrie, but does he really want to play with Frank Nktilikina, Allonzo Trier and Henry Ellenson? On that note, Kyrie has been frustrated with Tatum, Rozier and Brown at times this season. Is pairing up with a worse young core really the answer to those frustrations?"
"Wait, so:  1. Kevin ""I can't win with these cats"" Durant is going to go to NYK to play for a team that really only has Kyrie and nothing else set in stone?  2. Kyrie ""I don't want to be in Lebron's shadow"" Irving now wants to go and be in KD's shadow?  Call me crazy, but don't these rumours completely fly in the face of the rumours we've heard coming from ESPN over the years?  Either they're wrong now or they have been wrong for years."
didn't KD move his company to NY? And sold his Malibu home?  yeah here's a link:  https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-company-moving-office-180003549.html
"Kevin Durant was on the same FRANCHISE though.  Even through the Seattle Sonics moved to become the Oklahoma City Thunder, that was still the same team that drafted him.   So I think you are really reaching with that one."
&gt;dont see anyone better mid range shooter than him  Let me introduce you to a man called Kevin Durant.  Durant:  5-9 ft: 52%  10-14 ft: 50%  15L19 ft: 57%  DeMar:  5-9 ft: 45%  10-14 ft: 42%  15:19 ft: 39%
"&gt; When you have 7-foot Kevin Durant trying to guard Lou Williams down the stretch because he's your best option, that speaks to a poor back-end of the roster. Why do they not have a good defensive guard who could occasionally play in closing lineups alongside the 4 All-Stars, guard the opposing PG  Iguodala was mainly guarding Lou, KD got the matchup on switches and Klay is a good PG defender."
"&gt;It's just stupid that Kevin Durant basically makes the same amount of money as Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, Paul Millsap, Kyle Lowry and Wiggins  How so? I think the top and bottom contracts should only be separated by 40-50% imagine your coworker making 30 million while you make 2.5? That's going to breed resentment every time"
"&gt; When you have 7-foot Kevin Durant trying to guard Lou Williams down the stretch because he's your best option, that speaks to a poor back-end of the roster. Why do they not have a good defensive guard who could occasionally play in closing lineups alongside the 4 All-Stars, guard the opposing PG and knock down wide-open standstill 3's if the situation calls for it? Jalen Brunson and Jevon Carter were both picked after Evans this year.  This is literally iguadola. Durant was only on lou bc of switches"
"You are preventing super teams though... Kevin Durant wouldn't have left the thunder if he was getting 30 mil more per year and they could use that money to bring in role playing guys. The max contract as it is provides surplus values on players, now you are giving it to them without taking cap flexibility away."
"Every single account on Reddit is Kevin Durant. He’s fostered a community entirely of two people. Himself and his complex mind, and you, the reader of this comment. I know who you are, and I’d like to thank you for making this worth it."
"That’s not stupid.   That is literally Kevin Durant’s decision and his own fault. He wants to play with another MVP Supermax player, perennial all star and a DPOY - well he can’t get more money than that and keep everyone.   Ain’t nobody feeling sorry for Durant if he goes crying about not making enough money.   The Paul millsap, mike Conley, Gordon Hayward’s, Kyle Lowrys of the world earned their contract and are getting paid appropriately."
"Hi it’s me John Havlicek.  I’m posting from the afterlife. It’s beautiful here. everything is green and there are parquet floors.  I was pretty old when I shed this mortal coil  I just wanted to say that Kevin Durant is a huge pussy. OK gotta go now, Red is making beer brats tonight   xoxo"
Actually Kevin Durant just passed him yesterday which makes the news even weirder for me cuz his name was just on the TV.
Russ saw the finals because he played with Kevin Durant you know the guy who took you to 4 wcf and a game against lebrons heatles in the finals. What was Russ’ stats for that finals series and what was KD’s?
"""When we get a nice lead, we just tend to relax a little bit,"" Durant said.  Um, I don't think they had a big lead in this game, can someone confirm?  I think they just got beat, fair and square. Just accept it, Kevin."
"They still have Paul George, who was playing at the level of Kevin Durant in his prime at OKC, BEFORE his shoulder injury."
&gt;It's just more rampant on Reddit cause we're all anonymous   It's just more rampant on Reddit cause we're all Kevin Durant
"No. I heard this and I thought it was crazy. the 6ers were not exactly a stable organization if I remember right. His other role players were often injured or just very talented.   Russ was on a team with James Harden and Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant. AI never had that much talent around him. He is in a media market that adores him, AI was in a large East Coast media market where the press was not cutting a lot of breaks on his behavior. AI was a man of the people if another player put up big numbers against him, he gave them props. Russ does not role that way unless he's been humiliated.   I do not think this is a fair comparison to AI and sounds like revisionist history or just people trying to prop up Russ."
How about:  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins
"Kevin Durant on the day Patrick Beverley and the Clippers upset Golden State: ""He grabbed my booty in front of Steve Kerr, and he's never done that before. And I remember thinking I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life and it was the best goodbye. He just grabbed my booty and went on his way."""
"If you don’t think teams have different levels of motivation for different games, I don’t think you can be reasoned with. Ask Kevin Durant and Steve Kerr themselves. I think we both know what the result of game 6 will be with the dubs motivated coming off a loss"
Crazy thing is I understand this logic. Behind Westbrook and especially durant I don’t think he’d turn into the player he is today. Kevin Martin DID give what they needed. Problem was always injuries. When healthy Kevin Martin was darn good.
"It's just stupid that Kevin Durant basically makes the same amount of money as Mike Conley, Gordon Hayward, Paul Millsap, Kyle Lowry and Wiggins. I like the supermax, but I also think the normal max contract value should be increased or eliminated all together. This way great players that don't qualify for the supermax or want to leave to another team will get paid more."
KD claimed he took the hardest road in a statement to the media. I’ve gone on record saying KD didn’t take the hardest road.                                                          Hmmmm who should you believe r/basketbaIIa or Kevin Durant?
The issue has always been since 2011 and maybe even before that about bad shot choices. They called you a ball hog because when you shoot a contested 3-point shot with 19 seconds on the shot clock and three minutes left in the game and you're down by four and and all star like Kevin Durant is on your team and wide open and you're shooting 30% for the night and he's shooting 60% and you still decide to take that shot. That is not so much ball-hogging as it is making a poor in-game decision. Bad in game decisions and Shaw choices has always been the critique on Westbrook's game.
&gt;Kevin Durant (SEA) = 1-0 (100%)  Its crazy that a rookie KD dropped 40
"This includes both regular season and playoffs. Interesting ones to note are...  Paul George being 1-4 with Indiana, but 9-1 with OKC. Kevin Durant being 37-16 with Seattle/OKC, but 5-6 with GSW. Klay Thompson being undefeated when he scores 40+. James Harden scoring a whopping 63 games of 40+ points in his career, and still boasting a 75% win percentage."
He was BBQ'ing Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant last night man. There is no defense for a scorching hot Lou Williams.
"This is the best proof I could find:  [Oct 26, 2018 NY Post article](https://nypost.com/2018/10/26/knicks-can-take-revenge-on-warriors-by-stealing-kevin-durant/):  &gt; *""Durant and Kleiman own a business out of New York and San Francisco entitled “Thirty Five Ventures,” which handles their projects under one umbrella.""*  That shows that Thirty Five Ventures already had an office in NY at least before Oct 26, 2018.  Also, here is the original article [Feb 11, 2019 by Ramona Shelburne](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25951825/golden-state-warriors-star-kevin-durant-focused-building-future-basketball), which is the source for Feldman's (and everyone else's) articles. It just says they are moving into a new office **building**. If they were moving their office from SF to NY, it would say ""moving their offices to NYC"".  &gt; In this sense, Durant knows exactly who he is. He's not a hustler or a hype man. He's a hooper who needs people like Kleiman and Thirty Five Ventures marketing whiz Sarah Flynn to build his business and brand for him. The company has 10 employees at the moment, but it is **moving into a new office building** in New York City as it continues what Durant insists is a careful expansion. ""I just feel like you can do it more of a strategic way,"" he says. ""If you put yourself out there too much and then underdeliver ... that's not good."""
Serious question; would you rather have Tim Duncan or Kevin Durant on your team?
"[Kevin Durant - 书包杜 ""Schoolbag Du""  Because he used to often wear a backpack to press conferences (""Du"" is short for ""Durant"")](https://twitter.com/nick_kapur/status/993539638529839104?s=21)"

"You also don’t see an overwhelming majority of NBA or NFL players doing this either. By the way, the NHL would love to have a player get a tenth of the attention “soft” players like Kevin Durant or Antonio Brown get on social media."

Curry built the vehicle and is in cruise control. Kevin Durant is just coming for the ride.
"Warriors win the next game by 20.   “They didn’t win by 25. I’m scared for Golden State, Kevin Durant doesn’t have it this is embarrassing.”"
Yikes  Kevin Durant is arguably the best scorer in NBA history. I just provided a video full of instances where he was regularly left open in scoring position due to extra attention Curry receives( I.E. GRAVITY) .  You over here hype because a team is ignoring Chris Paul when he isnt even in scoring position.   If you need me to go into more detail because you dont understand Curry’s gravity I’d be more than happy to.
Kevin Durant is not clutch
My votes for 1st round MVP:  - Jared Dudley (pure Lulz)  - Damian Lillard  - Nikola Jokic  - Joel Embiid   - Kawhi Leonard  - Kevin Durant
"&gt; The only important question for the Thunder after their third straight post-Kevin Durant flameout is whether this season signals the beginning of a long-term decline for Westbrook  What you mean question and beginning?  He's on the wrong side of thirty, has had multiple knee surgeries, and is coming off two progressively worse seasons in which he has failed to find his shot."
"I hate a replay of a single call like this. It just paints a easy narrative for people adamant about NBA rigging for the Clippers for ratings purposes. Don’t get me wrong, I think this was a bad call.   But how about Jamychal Green’s questionable 6th foul on Kevin Durant right after Lou’s 4point play on Durant? I don’t see nobody complaining about that call when Green barely graze/bump KD.   Thing is, people only post replays of questionable calls to convey that their team was fucked by the refs when there were also a fair share of calls in favor of the Warriors throughout the game.  The refs didn’t beat the warriors. The Clippers simply made more baskets on Warriors’ piss poor defense. I didn’t know the refs help the Clippers shoot 54% from the field and hold the Warriors to 44%. That’s the reason why GSW lost, not because of a single, picked-out possession like this."
Kevin Durant is the MVP of the first round
"In 2016, Kyrie Irving made a shot that brought Kevin Durant to the Warriors. I think it’ll be so poetic if Kyrie hits another shot to make KD leave the Warriors."
Umm excuse me it’s fucking Kevin Durant a career 26PPG scorer you can’t pass on a player this special
"While we still would have gotten him, JaMychal Green is averaging 11 and 5 on absurdly efficient numbers, while playing some of the best defense on Kevin Durant I have ever seen.  He obviously loses a ton of those meaningful minutes if Tobias is still.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't get me wrong, KD is still getting buckets, but J is making it harder.  I also think the stretching of the floor that Shamet gives is understated by his stats.  He's shooting poorly because the Warriors understand how deadly of a shooter he is.  Same thing happened when we played the Spurs a while back--they put Kawhi/Green on Redick because he was instrumental in opening up our offense.  I'm not saying we would necessarily do better, but I personally don't think with Tobias we would have stolen 2 games from the Warriors."
I remember a few Warrior fans said the same thing ab Durant lol.    I think everyone realizes Kevin Durant would be a massive addition deep down. It's just the chemistry of this current group is incredible.
Kevin Durant - 1x MVP Stephen Curry - 2x MVP  You right OP shouldve said 3 MVPs smh.
Kevin “the reason I won’t win DPoY is because of hate” Durant showing his greatness on that end.

**Great**  * Kevin Durant * Kawhi Leonard  **Good**  * Kyrie Irving * Klay Thompson * Jimmy Butler  **Okay**  * Tobias Harris  **Disappointing**  * Kemba Walker * Khris Middleton  **Franchise Ruining**  * Kristaps Porzingis * Nikola Vucevic * D'Angelo Russell
"No. The Warriors will beat whoever comes out of the east in Max 6 games. Kevin Durant takes it to another level in the finals (seriously, he plays better as the playoffs go on, check the stats). And nobody in the East has an answer for that and the Warriors in finals mode"

Kevin Durant is way better than Curry which is sad because everyone loves Curry so much more
"The killer mentality exists at the top. You can't look at the Lakers young players to try to find killer mentality just like you couldn't look at the Clippers young players back when Jordan was winning championships.  If you want to see killer mentality you have to first look at the high level players, and then look at veterans. Young guys generally need to develop it. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are examples of guys that you sometimes see them with a killer mentality, and then other times they don't have it, just because they're not focused in yet because they lack maturity.  Guys I would say I've seen with the killer mentality: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, James Harden, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, and probably a few more."

It’s Mark Cuban. He’s going to try. I don’t know if we’ll ever know about or hear about it, but is he going to lob in a call to the Durant camp just to make sure? Of course they are. They’re the Mavs. They swing for the fences. They don’t care if they strike out.""  Swinging for the fences helps. No one thought the warriors were a destination for Durant until July 2nd 2016"
"So who would you replace him with? I'll give you Steph, but Westbrook was not an MVP player until KD left. Also, please don't ever insinuate Westbrook is an all-time great player. Want to know how many playoff series Westbrook has won since KD left? \*\*0\*\*. Westbrook is also one of the least efficient scorers in playoff history:   &amp;#x200B;  PPG: 25.4 (oh wow, he's def an all-time great!)

Not his fault Serge Ibaka and Kevin Martin were the 2nd/3rd best offensive players on his team that series. Plus that Grizzlies team had a prime Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph, and Tony Allen (literally one of the GOAT defenders).  &amp;#x200B;  He has incredible teammates, yet has been the best player in the finals the past two years.   &amp;#x200B;  2017 Finals:  ||PPG|FG%|3P%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Durant|**35.2**|**55.6%**|**47.4%**|**8.2**|5.4|1.0|**1.6**| |Curry|26.8|44.0%|38.8%|8.0|9.4|2.2|0.0| |Klay|16.4|42.9%|42.5%|3.8|2.2|0.4|0.2|  &amp;#x200B;  2018 Finals:  ||PPG|FG%|3P%|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Durant|**28.8**|**52.6%**|40.9%|**10.8**|**7.5**|0.8|**2.3**| |Curry|27.5|40.2%|41.5%|6.0|6.8|1.5|0.8| |Klay|16.0|48.0%|42.9%|3.8|1.0|0.5|0.3|"

"So all he'd have to do is get the express written consent of the NBA. Shouldn't be too hard,he's Kevin Durant. Y'all know who he is"
Ask Kevin Durant and his burner accounts
That's the benefit of having a Kevin Durant to carry you for most of the playoffs.
"Anyone who says that is just bad at interpreting data. Every shot will have an expected value based on it's success value (3 vs 2) and it's likelihood to go in (which is affected by distance, coverage, shooter, lots of things). It's not that you should never shoot midrangers, it's that usually midrangers are less likely to go in than paint shots and less valuable than threes. But there's a lot of times that isn't true. If you're Kevin Durant or kawhi  you can take the shot from anywhere because they're excellent midrange shooters. If the defense is conceding easy midrange looks you should take them, as long as you're decent at it. Imo it's smart for a team to try to create shots exclusively at the basket or from three, but if open shots appear elsewhere in that process you should take them. Massive preference against midrangers is fine, it's a downright refusal to take them that becomes a problem."
"For real. I got interested in GSW when they won their first championship but of course they lived long enough to become to villians. Lately after all these expectations of them falling apart and this is the year they drop off talks, im pretty stoked they are showing the world they are all stars and kevin durant didnt make them worse."
Steph curry. Kevin durant
"In the KD era, the Warriors have swept 4 teams, gone to 5 against 3, took the series in 6 against 2, and won in 7 against 1. The Warriors spent 2 of these series with KD out for any significant amount of time: 2017 first round against the Blazers, who got swept, and 2019 second round against the Rockets, who took it to 6. The problem is, the Rockets are the one and only team in the KD era to take the Warriors to 7, and the only one up to that point to take the Warriors past 5. Not only that, the Rockets lost Chris Paul to injury in the 7-game series. With Kevin Durant out and Chris Paul healthy, the Rockets were expected to win at least once. However, they failed to capitalize on that not only once, but twice. At the end of game 5, with Curry shooting poorly, the Rockets lost. And the entire game 6, without Kevin Durant even in Texas, with Steph Curry apparently not there either until the second half, the Rockets lost. They're getting clowned upon because they were the best against the KD era Warriors, and we expected them to be better. To add insult to injury, they lost in as many game as the 8th seed Clippers, who were playing against a Warriors squad that had KD healthy for the entire series."
"No....Kevin Durant went chasing rings and joined a championship team. Although Kyrie and Bron are a crazy duo, they would still need to be proven. Bron is aging by the day and Kyrie has clearly struggled on his own.   Durant was basically guaranteed another ring or two when he joined, Kyrie is guaranteed nothing. While we’d still all roast him for his choice, in essence it’s not the same as KD."
"HOUSTON — Draymond Green stood outside the visiting locker room at the Toyota Center, greeting teammates as they came in. When Stephen Curry made his way through the crowd, he looked straight at Green — before they slapped hands and bumped chests — and screamed, “Kick me off the court again, boy!”  There is a story behind that.  On the eve of Friday’s Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Curry wanted to get some shots up at the Toyota Center. The Warriors’ do-it-all manager, Eric Housen, booked the court from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. so Curry could work on his shot. Somehow, Rockets guard Chris Paul got wind. He decided to go to the Toyota Center to get shots up, nixing Curry’s reservations. The Warriors’ point guard offered to stick to half a court, but Paul wasn’t having it. Curry was kicked off the Toyota Center court.  Hence: “Kick me off the court again, boy!” And Green replied to Curry’s taunt by screaming, “Kick him off! Kick him off!”  The lesson from the Warriors’ 118-113 win to eliminate the Rockets and advance to the Western Conference finals was loud and clear. It’s going to take more than gamesmanship to beat the Warriors. Talent alone isn’t even enough.  Game 6 of this second-round series was a flex by the Warriors. It was a performance that illustrated the gulf between good teams and great ones, and another gulf between great teams and champions. On the road, with Kevin Durant back in the Bay Area watching on television, and with starting center DeMarcus Cousins on the bench in street clothes, they leaned on their championship mettle and revealed Houston to be unworthy of their crown.  And that isn’t necessarily a slight to the Rockets, one of the few teams that dared to dethrone the super team. Houston was indeed a valiant foe that pushed the Warriors unlike any other team without LeBron James.  The present day will take a chunk from the Rockets, from James Harden and Paul, especially. But history should remember them as great. When the final story is written about this era of the Warriors, they might only be looking up to Michael Jordan’s Bulls. And the Rockets, they are this era’s Utah Jazz: incredibly dynamic, led by Hall of Fame players, but just fashioned at the wrong time, in the same space-time continuum as a transcendent team.  “That team was one of the best teams we played during this five-year run,” coach Steve Kerr said of the Rockets. “They put so much pressure on you at both ends of the floor. It’s a tremendous two-way basketball team. We had to scrap and fight for everything the last two years against them. … Obviously, it speaks to our group and their toughness and talent. But I can’t speak any more highly of Houston and their grit and their competitiveness and their talent. That was an absolute grind.”  But there are levels to this. The Warriors are just a class above.  This was the Rockets’ best chance to show they belonged in the same ilk. The Warriors didn’t have more talent in Game 6. They didn’t have a loaded bench. They were down two starters, and their best players had logged heavy minutes. But in the end, the Warriors had too much of something else — championship swag. And they used it to come up with one of their biggest wins of this era, against a team most thought could end their reign.  “It’s all-time greats in here,” Quinn Cook screamed. “We got champions in this, motherfucka.”  This is what Green knew before the game when he predicted the Warriors were going to handle business. He knew it when they walked through shootaround and everyone was quiet. When they huddled, he tried to clap it up, get the energy up, and no one clapped with him.  He surveyed his teammates, looked into their eyes, examined their body language, searching for nervousness. Instead, he found focus.  “Oh, everybody’s ready to go,” Green said. “And I could feel it. Everybody was locked in. Even I got quiet. I knew I didn’t really feel like talking. And I know we’re locked in like that — I know what we’re made of, so I just knew guys were going to come out and bring it. When you talk about heart, you’re talking about just the willingness to do whatever. The willingness to do what it takes. The willingness to step up in a big moment. You can’t buy it. You can’t give it to someone. Either you got it or you don’t. I think we showed that in a major way.”  Klay Thompson was a prime example. He came into Game 6 averaging 17.6 points on 42.7 percent shooting. He’d made just over a third of his 3-pointers, 13-of-36, which is good but beneath his standards. But he came out shooting like he had the hottest stroke in Houston. He made 5 of his 9 3-point attempts and scored a game-high 21 points in the first half. The Warriors needed every basket. But he gave them more than the points. He gave them confidence. He fired the first shots in the mental war that games of this magnitude become.  Thompson famously destroyed Oklahoma City in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2016. In 2018, he burned these same Rockets in Game 6. He came out reminding them what kind of night they were in for, what it was going to take to beat them. Thompson signaled how the Warriors were bringing it.  “His personality, his perspective on life, really makes him different in these moments,” Curry said. “I don’t even know if he really even feels pressure. He’s just out there hooping. The shots he was taking in the first half — understanding the situation, the confidence to knock them down — that was huge for us. We don’t win this game tonight without everybody on the court, but especially Klay that first half to give us life and to give us a reason to be in it in the second half.”  At the 9:57 mark of the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala checked out of the game. At that point, he had logged 29 minutes, 45 seconds after closing the third quarter and starting the fourth. But at the 8:15 mark, Kerr put him right back in.  Iguodala was stunned. He was spent. He needed a longer breather. He said one moment he was so tired, he felt lightheaded and a little dizzy. He said it was probably the most mentally exhausted he’s ever been.  But experience has taught him some things that come into play in the most intense moments of playoff basketball. He’s learned how to override the fatigue and conquer the thoughts that lead to defeat. Friday, he leaned on meditation principles. He embraces those moments, those thoughts. He lives in those moments — feels them, examines them and then discards them with a breath. It’s his championship pedigree serving as an antivirus for exhaustion, doubt, frustration, weakness.  It was a lesson he learned in the Warriors’ first championship back in 2015, when he first felt what it took to be a champion. It was late in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, and a couple of calls went Cleveland’s way. He remembers complaining to himself about how hard it was, about how the referees weren’t giving them calls, how the mountain seemed so steep.  “The referees were (officiating) like, ‘You have to win.’ That’s the thought I had,” Iguodala said. “We have to win. You’re not just going to win the championship. You have to go get it.  “If I’m ever in a game,” he continued, “and I’m like, ‘Yo, this is hard,’ then I tell myself, ‘That means you’re doing something right.’ … When you know something is hard and you’re doing it the right way — that’s really a championship moment, when you overcome the mind, overcome the body being tired, the mind being dead.”  Iguodala overcame in a big way. His 17 points and five steals, his calming presence on the court. When he checked back in after 102 seconds of rest, his defense helped hold Harden to 1-of-4 shooting with a turnover in the defining stretch of the game that saw the Warriors go from a four-point deficit to a five-point lead.  Behind Iguodala was Green, holding down the back line. He filled the stats as usual — eight points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, a steal, a block, four turnovers, four fouls — but he anchored a defense that held the Rockets scoreless on eight shots over a span of 3:56 that saw the Warriors take control of the game.  “Draymond,” Shaun Livingston said, “we wouldn’t have championships without him. Heart of steel. Steph playing through what he’s playing through — all the expectations, people talking. The character behind those guys. Them two. Klay. Andre. The character behind those guys is unmatched. We stay in the trenches. You’ve got to put us down. We’re like that dog that’s going to keep biting if he’s got one tooth left, but you know he’s going to bite you with it. We all have that mentality. I’ve seen it. That mentality of staying locked in. ‘We can’t give this game up. We can’t celebrate early. We can’t think we got it in the bag.’ That’s what champs do. We’ve just got guys.”  So when it was winning time and the Rockets had to dig deeper to beat the champions and stave off elimination, they couldn’t do it. The Warriors came alive in that moment and the Rockets couldn’t.  Curry seized the moment and carried the Warriors home. He hit the shot of the night, hitting the Rockets’ best defender in P.J. Tucker with a series of crossovers and drilling a fadeaway 3. That’s when they knew, the Warriors and the Rockets, that the gulf between these teams would not be conquered.  Of course, Thompson hit the dagger 3-pointer, the one that punctuated the reality of this most riveting rivalry: The Rockets are great. But the Warriors are champions.  “I can’t remember a situation where we’ve had must-win games and my guys folded,” Green said. “I can’t remember. I’ve seen guys have bad games. But I’ve never seen us in any situation where there was a big-pressure moment and they fold. But yet they’re light-skinned and they’re soft. Fuck outta here. They ain’t never folded in a big moment. But they don’t get credit for that because their jump shots are pretty. Fuck them jump shots. They show up in big moments. They got heart.”  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / Getty Images)"
" Obvious plan from the tip-off: stop the ball from reaching the splash bros. [They switch everything, try to make sure they have no easy passing lanes and if that means help out and ignore any other player in the perimeter, so be it](https://i.imgur.com/3b2ITjN.gifv). Outstanding execution by Houston early: [The Warriors can't reach the only two players they're trying to create for ](https://i.imgur.com/t4JWZYP.gifv). Tucker both steps in and stops Bogut finding Curry and then switches to stop the cut by Thompson. Either they were completely stifled or they were trying very early jumpshots, that were not going down. If the only available pass is Bogut throwing it to Iguodala in the corner(https://i.imgur.com/iRoEpYt.gifv), then the defense won.  Curry got the second foul before the halfway point of the quarter. Kerr brings in Cook to maintain the shooting and [immediately CP hunts the matchup but the rest of the team did a good job covering for him](https://i.imgur.com/ojgSUQ8.gifv). In this play he gets help from Bogut, Dray and Iggy.  The first play where the Dubs busted through the wall [was this one](https://i.imgur.com/Dp0EUEF.gifv). They mistimed the switch but Harden should have dropped when Capela went up. Houston was happy just for having kept away from Thompson and had Harden been in position this would still be exactly what their gameplan was.  The moment Looney came in he already is affecting the game. [A strong vertical contest on Harden followed by an offensive board and a putback](https://i.imgur.com/Lri4I4M.gifv). He would also have a layup where he drives from halfcourt to the rim in full point guard mode. I think he was directly responsible for almost all of GSW's points in this first stretch of his. _____________________________________________________________________________________________  The Warriors were trapping Curry every time [but the weak side was too open for players that can hit midrangers at a solid clip](https://i.imgur.com/W8AXfHv.gifv). Looney can make those simple passes and Houston needs to react quicker after the call leaves Curry's hands. I don't consider this the same type of gamble from when they left Green open in the previous quarter.  The Rockets had their turnovers reach double digits but most of them were offensive fouls or product of good defense. There weren't a lot of unforced turnovers.  Despite this, the pace of the game was starting to increase heavily. The first real run of the game to create some distance was on [the back of Klay Thompson. Houston fell asleep twice to allow him a good look coming off screens](https://i.imgur.com/i5qRiyn.gifv). (Harden in the first and Rivers misreads a switch in the second). [The Rockets would respond by going red hot from deep](https://i.imgur.com/PA0a0U5.gifv) but those easy 3s for Klay might be what cost them the game, not taking advantage of the Warriors at their weakest moment in the game and in the series.  At this point Steph was abysmal: 0-5, [including some misses from layup/floater range reminiscent of game 3](https://i.imgur.com/zPVPCoz.gifv) and with 3 fouls. The Warriors relied on going deep to their bench and it payed off - 20 points in the half. A combination of no Durant, a scoreless Curry and a tied game is an outrageous idea. Klay Thompson was absolutely fantastic considering how much he was doing on both ends. Harden also had an strong half, with a few good threes ([Looney can't drop so much here](https://i.imgur.com/YsD9C4r.gifv)), but his jumpshots weren't hitting at a particularly efficient level and [I thought the defense in his floaters was pretty good from the start](https://i.imgur.com/0KOUZ2V.gifv). Still, The Beard would get 14 points in the first quarter alone, constantly finding his way to the line.  __________________________________________________________________________________________________  Regarding Curry, Houston was incredible at making sure he got no looks coming from screens or in a handoff. But whenever Steph got going in the midst of all these struggles he was playing on ball, with his dribble, and attacking the rim. [And this won't cut it because when Bogut isn't connecting with Gordon and the pick needs to be set a lot higher up on the floor](https://i.imgur.com/iK7J027.gifv). All that's happening here is they're making it easier for them to trap the ball handler and collapse the defense. The entire offense of the Warriors to begin the third seemed to be Iguodala shooting from the wing/corner... [This is also bad offense btw](https://i.imgur.com/JA4dqLj.gifv). Chris Paul's early flurry kinda masked it but not much was going on in this side of the court as well.   But to focus on something good, the most important thing I saw in this quarter was how Harden was spectacular in getting deflections out these many Warrior passes(https://imgur.com/a/LflarO4). This isn't exactly a new skill, since he's always been great deflecting entry passes when teams try to post him up but here he was much more aggressive anticipating in space. This was not only multiple possessions that go the other way but killed any rhythm the Dubs were trying to play with more movement.  I liked Kerr going with Cook and Jerebko alongside Curry to spread out the floor, while Harden and Klay rested. The Rockets would have the stronger final minutes though, but it for a collection of things that aren't related to this idea: [Curry did get the space he wanted but missed, Kerr gave up way too quickly on Cook for Iguodala even though he wasn't being attacked during this stretch, Chris Paul was incredible and Jerebko decided to get hiccups](https://i.imgur.com/Z2WcQ5F.gifv).  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________  [You can see how much Klay has a hard time creating with his dribble](https://i.imgur.com/llYNbLq.gifv). He simply doesn't have the quickness and the skill to blow past Capela [and PJ Tucker would eat him alive if he tried it on him](https://imgur.com/a/i0H65gh). Paul now was indeed looking to go at Cook every trip and he goes back to the bench for Livingston, [that answers in kind](https://i.imgur.com/ICxwgzO.gifv). Steph-Klay-Shaun-Iggy-Dray is a good response for the Rockets guard heavy lineups.  After 3 minutes without points in a completely frozen game, we officially enter crunch time. The Curry/Green Pick and Roll was spammed like the series depended on it. [The first ""unlocking play"" is a huge shot by Curry, which Harden responds to in his second try](https://i.imgur.com/Zvhaf30.gifv). Curry was visibly bothered in his left hand after that fall. His dislocated finger scares the hell out of me... And i highly doubt that hasn't been affecting his jumpshot. But I have to say, [he again found himself after an awful first half](https://i.imgur.com/tWhW4j3.gifv). For how awesome Tucker is on KD and Klay, Curry is too quick for him to defend in isolation. The game would be sealed by a Klay Thompson 3 [in a play where Houston defended everything correctly but the shot just went in](https://i.imgur.com/UqSEfKH.gifv).   In the Rockets last effort PJ passed the ball too early before Looney committed to helping, [having the ability to close in and block the ball](https://i.imgur.com/H0lC6Y5.gifv). Prior to this, Gerald Green had already missed in crucial moments where the Rockets could have taken momentum in the game.  It's hard for me to not be a fan here, this is a fantastic win. No Kevin Durant, Klay's scoring and the bench was able to keep us in it despite CP3 being great and Harden, despite missing some free throws and some mistakes, had some really nice stretches. Strength in Numbers indeed. Curry scored all of his 33 points in the second half, 6-8 shooting in the 4th. This to me is a game to remember. And i'm incredibly happy that there isn't a game 7 to further exhaust the players. I know no Houston fan wants to hear this, but these two years the Rockets have been incredible at making me shit myself.  I talked very little about how amazing defensively Green, Iguodala and Klay were, and i mean the whole series. That's mostly because i have written a lot about it in regards to other games and don't want to repeat all that. But I am constantly amazed at what level they can reach on that side of the court. The Rockets had a few possessions where they made mistakes or a miscommunications while the Warriors had very very few. Their defense won this. Harden was 3-12 with Klay as the defender, and the team had 0.9 PPP when Andre was on him.  Other Notes:  -&gt; The Warriors held the Green at center minutes to the minimum but more shocking was the lack of PJ at the 5, which Mike never really tried that much this game. I have no idea why because Capela gave them very little.  -&gt; I can't believe Iguodala shot so well from deep this series.  -&gt; [I really appreciate how much the Warriors hunted for offensive rebounds, crashing the glass with intent](https://i.imgur.com/bZWU5x7.gifv). Previously, you would only see some players like Looney shine in their limited minutes but now everyone with any length to speak of is trying to exploit a system that switches the bigs away from the rim.  -&gt; Bogut held up surprising well, although he was never called upon to face Harden in a switch. And despite [his mandatory silly moment](https://i.imgur.com/lJbmjpw.gifv), Bell rewarded his playing time with the second unit with two blocks and a dunk taking advantage of numbers in transition. This is the type of game that will buy him more minutes."
"2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws (3rd worst game of this season by FT%) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus   35 points on 59 TS = CHOKE!111"
He hasn’t missed that many. I saw 24-1. (Which looks better anyways) But those are all regular season games besides last night. And they hardly lose regardless in the regular season. But I’m not sure if you forgot they blew a 3-1 lead without him then beat that same exact team in 5 the next year. They are better with Kevin Durant.
"What? When did Kevin Durant get into this conversation? Also, you’re spouting similar shit about either KD or KG, whoever you decide on, so move on."
No team is better without Kevin Durant.
Golden State after Kevin Durant. I'd say they'd still be pretty good though their margins get thinner
It's almost like we had Kevin Durant in game 3.
Despite? I feel like the Warriors are a better overall team without Kevin Durant on the floor. Kevin Durant is more isolated when he is on the floor opposed to them functioning completely as a team without him on the floor
"~*There was a NBA team who made the 2014-15 NBA playoffs that was frustrated in their postseason run by the Golden State Warriors, and who then rebuilt themselves around attracting aging superstars to try and win the title by only shooting from behind the line.

"Yup and that’s the most disappointing part. Cavs did it with a liability like Kevin Love for a while and the rockets had far better personnel, just play TJ at the 5 worst case. They had the template for how to Play Curry pre Durant and they fucked up.  Cavs made Curry work for his shot and it’s not like he was lighting them up. He did his part and was fairly efficient but that was it. Draymond wasn’t getting 4 on 3s every now and then."
"Fuck Bill Simmons. His voice is annoying and his takes are garbage. He  said fuck sports and literally did an entire podcast episode on Game of Thrones when he was with ESPN.   Grantland hasn’t done that much either. What stories do they break? What compelling content to they put out? They suck.   He’s an unfunny, smug fuck who dickrides Kevin Durant and Boston sports. It’s clear he doesn’t watch games anymore."
I really think this just shows how much the warriors never needed Kevin Durant...
"“I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am” - Words of someone who isnt secure"
&gt; People somehow forgot that this Warriors team was one of the best teams ever before KD.  No. Because that is the whole point of people being pissed at KD joining them. He joined the team that can win a title without Kevin Durant playing.
"I think D'antoni's coaching team only decided to switch everything because the Curry/Durant PnR on top of the Warrior's offball movement is unguardable otherwise. Since Kevin went down, they figured trapping Curry would keep the ball out of his hands and force the other guys (non-ball handlers) to dribble. And it kind of worked in the first half, I know the story is that Steph had 0 points, but to me the more astonishing fact is that he only attempted 5 shots. The Rockets were forcing the ball out of Steph's hands and trying to get Looney or Klay to dribble."
"HOUSTON — Draymond Green stood outside the visiting locker room at the Toyota Center, greeting teammates as they came in. When Stephen Curry made his way through the crowd, he looked straight at Green — before they slapped hands and bumped chests — and screamed, “Kick me off the court again, boy!”  There is a story behind that.  On the eve of Friday’s Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Curry wanted to get some shots up at the Toyota Center. The Warriors’ do-it-all manager, Eric Housen, booked the court from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. so Curry could work on his shot. Somehow, Rockets guard Chris Paul got wind. He decided to go to the Toyota Center to get shots up, nixing Curry’s reservations. The Warriors’ point guard offered to stick to half a court, but Paul wasn’t having it. Curry was kicked off the Toyota Center court.  Hence: “Kick me off the court again, boy!” And Green replied to Curry’s taunt by screaming, “Kick him off! Kick him off!”  The lesson from the Warriors’ 118-113 win to eliminate the Rockets and advance to the Western Conference finals was loud and clear. It’s going to take more than gamesmanship to beat the Warriors. Talent alone isn’t even enough.  Game 6 of this second-round series was a flex by the Warriors. It was a performance that illustrated the gulf between good teams and great ones, and another gulf between great teams and champions. On the road, with Kevin Durant back in the Bay Area watching on television, and with starting center DeMarcus Cousins on the bench in street clothes, they leaned on their championship mettle and revealed Houston to be unworthy of their crown.  And that isn’t necessarily a slight to the Rockets, one of the few teams that dared to dethrone the super team. Houston was indeed a valiant foe that pushed the Warriors unlike any other team without LeBron James.  The present day will take a chunk from the Rockets, from James Harden and Paul, especially. But history should remember them as great. When the final story is written about this era of the Warriors, they might only be looking up to Michael Jordan’s Bulls. And the Rockets, they are this era’s Utah Jazz: incredibly dynamic, led by Hall of Fame players, but just fashioned at the wrong time, in the same space-time continuum as a transcendent team.  “That team was one of the best teams we played during this five-year run,” coach Steve Kerr said of the Rockets. “They put so much pressure on you at both ends of the floor. It’s a tremendous two-way basketball team. We had to scrap and fight for everything the last two years against them. … Obviously, it speaks to our group and their toughness and talent. But I can’t speak any more highly of Houston and their grit and their competitiveness and their talent. That was an absolute grind.”  But there are levels to this. The Warriors are just a class above.  This was the Rockets’ best chance to show they belonged in the same ilk. The Warriors didn’t have more talent in Game 6. They didn’t have a loaded bench. They were down two starters, and their best players had logged heavy minutes. But in the end, the Warriors had too much of something else — championship swag. And they used it to come up with one of their biggest wins of this era, against a team most thought could end their reign.  “It’s all-time greats in here,” Quinn Cook screamed. “We got champions in this, motherfucka.”  This is what Green knew before the game when he predicted the Warriors were going to handle business. He knew it when they walked through shootaround and everyone was quiet. When they huddled, he tried to clap it up, get the energy up, and no one clapped with him.  He surveyed his teammates, looked into their eyes, examined their body language, searching for nervousness. Instead, he found focus.  “Oh, everybody’s ready to go,” Green said. “And I could feel it. Everybody was locked in. Even I got quiet. I knew I didn’t really feel like talking. And I know we’re locked in like that — I know what we’re made of, so I just knew guys were going to come out and bring it. When you talk about heart, you’re talking about just the willingness to do whatever. The willingness to do what it takes. The willingness to step up in a big moment. You can’t buy it. You can’t give it to someone. Either you got it or you don’t. I think we showed that in a major way.”  Klay Thompson was a prime example. He came into Game 6 averaging 17.6 points on 42.7 percent shooting. He’d made just over a third of his 3-pointers, 13-of-36, which is good but beneath his standards. But he came out shooting like he had the hottest stroke in Houston. He made 5 of his 9 3-point attempts and scored a game-high 21 points in the first half. The Warriors needed every basket. But he gave them more than the points. He gave them confidence. He fired the first shots in the mental war that games of this magnitude become.  Thompson famously destroyed Oklahoma City in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals in 2016. In 2018, he burned these same Rockets in Game 6. He came out reminding them what kind of night they were in for, what it was going to take to beat them. Thompson signaled how the Warriors were bringing it.  “His personality, his perspective on life, really makes him different in these moments,” Curry said. “I don’t even know if he really even feels pressure. He’s just out there hooping. The shots he was taking in the first half — understanding the situation, the confidence to knock them down — that was huge for us. We don’t win this game tonight without everybody on the court, but especially Klay that first half to give us life and to give us a reason to be in it in the second half.”  At the 9:57 mark of the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala checked out of the game. At that point, he had logged 29 minutes, 45 seconds after closing the third quarter and starting the fourth. But at the 8:15 mark, Kerr put him right back in.  Iguodala was stunned. He was spent. He needed a longer breather. He said one moment he was so tired, he felt lightheaded and a little dizzy. He said it was probably the most mentally exhausted he’s ever been.  But experience has taught him some things that come into play in the most intense moments of playoff basketball. He’s learned how to override the fatigue and conquer the thoughts that lead to defeat. Friday, he leaned on meditation principles. He embraces those moments, those thoughts. He lives in those moments — feels them, examines them and then discards them with a breath. It’s his championship pedigree serving as an antivirus for exhaustion, doubt, frustration, weakness.  It was a lesson he learned in the Warriors’ first championship back in 2015, when he first felt what it took to be a champion. It was late in Game 6 of those NBA Finals, and a couple of calls went Cleveland’s way. He remembers complaining to himself about how hard it was, about how the referees weren’t giving them calls, how the mountain seemed so steep.  “The referees were (officiating) like, ‘You have to win.’ That’s the thought I had,” Iguodala said. “We have to win. You’re not just going to win the championship. You have to go get it.  “If I’m ever in a game,” he continued, “and I’m like, ‘Yo, this is hard,’ then I tell myself, ‘That means you’re doing something right.’ … When you know something is hard and you’re doing it the right way — that’s really a championship moment, when you overcome the mind, overcome the body being tired, the mind being dead.”  Iguodala overcame in a big way. His 17 points and five steals, his calming presence on the court. When he checked back in after 102 seconds of rest, his defense helped hold Harden to 1-of-4 shooting with a turnover in the defining stretch of the game that saw the Warriors go from a four-point deficit to a five-point lead.  Behind Iguodala was Green, holding down the back line. He filled the stats as usual — eight points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, a steal, a block, four turnovers, four fouls — but he anchored a defense that held the Rockets scoreless on eight shots over a span of 3:56 that saw the Warriors take control of the game.  “Draymond,” Shaun Livingston said, “we wouldn’t have championships without him. Heart of steel. Steph playing through what he’s playing through — all the expectations, people talking. The character behind those guys. Them two. Klay. Andre. The character behind those guys is unmatched. We stay in the trenches. You’ve got to put us down. We’re like that dog that’s going to keep biting if he’s got one tooth left, but you know he’s going to bite you with it. We all have that mentality. I’ve seen it. That mentality of staying locked in. ‘We can’t give this game up. We can’t celebrate early. We can’t think we got it in the bag.’ That’s what champs do. We’ve just got guys.”  So when it was winning time and the Rockets had to dig deeper to beat the champions and stave off elimination, they couldn’t do it. The Warriors came alive in that moment and the Rockets couldn’t.  Curry seized the moment and carried the Warriors home. He hit the shot of the night, hitting the Rockets’ best defender in P.J. Tucker with a series of crossovers and drilling a fadeaway 3. That’s when they knew, the Warriors and the Rockets, that the gulf between these teams would not be conquered.  Of course, Thompson hit the dagger 3-pointer, the one that punctuated the reality of this most riveting rivalry: The Rockets are great. But the Warriors are champions.  “I can’t remember a situation where we’ve had must-win games and my guys folded,” Green said. “I can’t remember. I’ve seen guys have bad games. But I’ve never seen us in any situation where there was a big-pressure moment and they fold. But yet they’re light-skinned and they’re soft. Fuck outta here. They ain’t never folded in a big moment. But they don’t get credit for that because their jump shots are pretty. Fuck them jump shots. They show up in big moments. They got heart.”  (Photo: Andrew D. Bernstein / Getty Images)"
Isn't Kevin Durant a stand up comedian
"Not denying that they're home-grown — I'm denying that their teams are particularly special *because* they're home grown, or that they're somehow superior to others who assemble teams by other means.    The bulk of their success came as a result of the signing of Kevin Durant, the same formula other teams use for success. Without him, they're 1-1, and it isn't far fetched to speculate how things might have played out differently in 2015 if not for their extraordinary luck with injuries to the Cavs' squad.  Regardless, this convo is ultimately meaningless, and they're the greatest basketball spectacle in decades, perhaps ever."
"Lol, this playoff has been great:  Clippers force a game 6 against kd warriors Dame waves bye bye to Russ and Paul Refereeing drama Celtics meltdown Paul Pierce assinine predictions Barkley assinine predictions KD injury ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Rise of the Bucks Sixers drama Kawiet Raptors  Wtf are you even watching I wonder."
He absolutely got lucky. Steph is in the conversation of best shooter of all time and best point guard of all Time. Klay is right up there with Steph as one of the best shooters of all time. They scored a combined total of the greatest number of 3s in multiple seasons before Kerr ever got there.   Then you have Kevin Durant who was a scoring champ and one of the most potent offensive threats in the game added to this mix.   Do I still think he is very talented coach despite all this? Absolutely. It’s very difficult to manage a team with such strong talent and have them buy into a culture. He is able to fully tap into their potential and it’s a great testament that the warriors have not fatigued from winning so much. Going to 4 straight finals is incredibly taxing on a team.
"Steph ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Curry"
allen iverson 2000-01  Kobe 2005-06  kevin durant 2013-14  kevin garnett 2003-04  Shaquille oneal 2000-01
"They won once in 2015 with their home-grown team, which Kevin Love *and* Kyrie Irving were out for. They lost in 2016 when the Cavs were healthy. The result of that loss was the signing of Kevin Durant.  The Warriors are a dynasty, arguably the greatest in NBA history, but this ""home-grown"" stuff is getting old."
"Melo signing burned a MLE how did that ruin the team haha. He had no options, their cap space is limited they don't have the luxury on having players like Kevin Durant and Klay on less than max contracts lmao"
KEVIN DURANT COULD CATCH THESE HANDS ANY DAY (he’d win but I’d fight back)
"""Is Kevin Durant secretly a white supremacist with the hand symbol"""
Engaging in sexual relations with Kevin Durant is presumed to be an atypical experience.
Warriors now 5-0 in their last 5 games against the Rockets without Kevin Durant
"2015 Finals Curry: 26/6.3/5.2 on 44.3/38.5/88.5 (58.5 TS%)  2016 Finals Curry:  22.6/3.7/4.9 on 40.3/40/92.9 (58 TS%)  2017 Finals Curry: 26.8/9.4/8.0 on 44/38.8/89.7 (61.9 TS%)  2018 Finals Curry: 27.5/6.8/6.0 on 40.6/41.5/100 (56 TS%)  &amp;#x200B;  He has legitimately played bad in ONE series in his career. Steph Curry in 2015 is easy FMVP its' actually mind boggling how Iguodala somehow won over him. In 2017 and 2018, he averaged all time great stats which would would have won him FMVP if Kevin Durant didn't average even more insane stats which is a testament to KD and not a knock on Steph (In fact, if you compare Steph's stats those years to recent Finals MVPS, this point becomes even more obvious).  This isn't even including his other clutch performances and what do you mean, 'meaningless elimination games?'.   He legit had 31/6/7, 29/9/10 and 36/8/5 against OKC in game 5, 6 and 7 during 2016 where a single loss meant elimination.  &amp;#x200B;  He had 29/6/5 and 27/10/9 against Houston in game 6 and 7 during 2018, where, again, a single loss meant elimination.  Tonight he scored 33 points in the second half to close out against Houston on the road."
It's mostly Kevin Durant stans trolling.
Rockets had 1 good game of CP3. The Warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant for... 5 quarters?  They should’ve won today though no doubt. Sloppy play.
The Warriors didn’t have Kevin Durant.   The Rockets didn’t have...Trevor Ariza?
Kevin Durant a bitch I’ll fight him any day
"""First off, we need Kevin Durant to *fucking leave.*"""
"Here are three takeaways from the Warriors' big victory.  **The Warriors' bench is more capable than we thought** Golden State obviously had the most talented starting lineup in basketball this season. But many knocked it for its lack of depth.  The Warriors have had elite talent for a while, but the quality contributions they got from their bench were critical Friday night.  In the absence of Kevin Durant, who was ruled out for the series with a calf injury, Golden State posted 33 bench points. Both Kevon Looney (14 points) and Shaun Livingston (11) tallied double-digits in scoring.  The Warriors' rotation had shrunk in recent weeks, but 11 players were featured in Friday's close-out game.  **Stephen Curry is still … well, Stephen Curry** The two-time MVP's shooting has been inconsistent in the second round, and Game 6 was no exception.  Curry had been dealing with a dislocated finger for several games and was held scoreless in the first half. But he heated up to finish with a team-high 33 points and sank clutch free throws to seal the deal for his team.  Golden State's leader has continued to pull through for his team in the postseason, and now the Warriors will go to their fifth consecutive Western Conference finals.  **The charity stripe helped do the Rockets in** Houston and Golden State had almost identical stats.  Both teams made exactly 42 field goals on the night. The Warriors made one more 3-pointer but lost the rebounding battle by five.  The Rockets only lost by five points. James Harden finished with a game-high 35 points, but accounted for all five of Houston's missed free throws. Houston didn't have much room for mistakes, and one of its failures to capitalize on one of its strengths might have caused it to fall short.  The Warriors will get to rest for now and prepare to face Portland or Denver in the Western Conference finals."
"You’re right, beating the lower seed in six games with only Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant (minus one game) has just as much adversity, if not more I mean let’s be honest, then winning a chip down 3-1 to the best team of all time"
"Portland. We get to see Damian Lillard in Oakland, Steph vs. Seth (and which child is Dell and Sonya's favorite), Enes Kanter vs Kevin Durant, the GOAT shooting backcourt against another incredibly good shooting backcourt, Rip City, and all the games in the same timezone."
"Ok but context matters? The first matchup you played lebron without his 2 all star teammates the majority of that series, the second one you lost, and then the next 2 you added Kevin freaking Durant and had no major losses while the Cavs(who were outmatched even with him) lost kyrie the year after"
"My favorite part about that game was the end, where the Warriors didn't win. Quite the contrary, the Warriors lost that game and didn't win it. Specifically, Steph Curry, the unanimous MVP did not win the game. Nor did Draymond Green. Nor did Klay Thompson. Nor did Kevin Durant, who wasn't on the team yet, but fuck him anyway.  In fact, none of the Warriors won that game, because the Warriors lost. At the end of the game, it was not the Warriors who won, but rather the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Lebron James, who won the game due in no small part to the fact that he was not a member of the Warriors, but rather the leader of the victorious Cleveland Cavaliers.  Who did the Cavs beat to win that game, you might ask? The Golden State Warriors, who blew a 3-1 series lead and ended their season without winning the title."
That's exactly why I liked the warriors right when they started getting good and going to the finals and taking over the league because they did it the right way and they were a good group of guys and then they went and signed Kevin Durant and ruined it. they were already like the perfect team built the right way and pretty much an unstoppable Juggernaut. And then added Kevin f****** Durant.
"When KD signed with GS, the warriors got 3 advantages. 1. They never have to face Kevin Durant 2. Injury insurance.  (They can win even if one of their MVPs goes down) 3. Kevin Durant"
"That isn't the point? What about the 2 and a half games where he carried that team? The point is, when your best player goes down, you should have the ability to have 2 other super stars be able to step up. That's why there are salary caps. So, when Kevin Durant takes less than his worth in salary, it causes an imbalance in team structure. If Harden got injured, the rockets would have lost by 30. The GSW loose their best player and win 2 games straight... That's not a feat, that is cheating."
"*calls Kevin Durant in the parking lot*  Yup, into *their* own hands."
KD: im Kevin durant
They added Kevin Durant just ignore that though
Definitely better with Kevin Durant haha. He adds a lot on defense as well.
Kevin of Durant
TIL Mitchell Robinson is more valuable than Kevin Durant
"Relatively minor injuries, like MVP and only reliable player this post season Kevin Durant. You're pathetic."
Kevin Durant is a luxury to these Warriors. Crazy...
"We all lost when Kevin ""Gamora"" Durant joined them"
Never forget sackless Kevin Durant joined a 73-9. Ice up son
"The answer is obvious, heal Kevin Durant"
"This comment makes me smile. It’s because every generation or so you get to witness truly clutch players that transcend what you think is possible. Kevin Durant is the most skilled player in basketball, but don’t forget that Steph curry and klaytheism Thompson have got winning engrained in their dna. They are molded by their dominance when it matters. People are quick to forget just how excellent the warriors were even before they got Durant.   All I know as a fan that suffered through the Sprewell era, I have goosebumps from that performance. Curry is simply unbelievable"
Morey to the NBA: Kevin Durant getting hurt cost us a trip to the finals
"Kerr convinced everyone that Kevin Durant was the best player in the world, meanwhile Curry was napping in the back ready to take back his throne lol"
"Kevin Durant leaving is what’s best for business. The gap in terms of skill between the teams decrease, Durant gets his shot at solidifying a championship that is not seen by many as “tainted, and Warriors basketball during the 14-16 seasons returns."
"He fucking blew it, he should have said ""They won because they have *the* best player in the world on their team, and we couldn't stop him for a full game. We've doubled him all series, we decided we'd rather anyone else shoot it even if that meant Kevin Fucking Durant. But it wasn't enough. I don't know what else we could do"""
"I need to save this because it will get deleted  Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  **2012:** Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  **2013:** Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  **2014:** Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  **2015:** Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  **2016:** Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  **2017:** Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  **2018:** Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  **2019** Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
Kevin Durant is STAYING you fuckers! Get used to it!
"They took em to game 6, had an elimination game on their own court when the other team was down not just an all-star, but Kevin fucking Durant. They held Curry scoreless for half the game, and they *still* couldn't find a way to win. That's about as silver of a platter it can get. Anything more and it's pure gold"
"Last year, Rockets up 3-2, lost Chris Paul, and lost the series.  This year, the roles reversed.  Warriors up 3-2, lost Kevin Durant, and win series next game on the road.  Sorry Rockets, the Warriors are just better.  I wouldn't say you choke.  You put up a good fight.  Your opponent is just better."
Chris harden sat in the parking lot after the game 6 loss and called Kevin Durant but all he could hear on the other end was some sort of white noise or hissing sound.
Steve Kerr: This is KD. He's Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant is the greatest backup plan of all time. But Durant isn’t the engine. It’s not even just curry or Klay, it’s the two of them. Ever since Durant went down, the warriors have gone back to the game plan that won them 3 straight titles and they’ve just been the better team since the injury."
"A few things that I no longer want to read on Reddit:  OKC would've won a championship by now, if it had been James Harden and Kevin Durant that remained.  OKC should've traded Russell Westbrook instead of James Harden.  Russell shouldn't have won his MVP as proved by his playoff performances.  Houston has routinely built better teams around James than OKC has in general, and in particular as of late around Russell, and James still can't even get to the WCF against teams that are missing their best player.  I don't even care about the Rockets downvote brigade that I am about to endure."
We wouldve won if kevin durant didnt get injured
"Can someone capture the moment right after the final whistle where Draymond and Steph are celebrating together?  It sounded like something about Kevin Durant was said and it kinda sounded like ""Hell yeah, fuck Kevin Durant!"""
"when the owner brags about the team being designed to beat the Warriors, they deserve criticism everytime they lose. when they get the 1st seed and say they’re better than the Warriors, and lose, they get a break because of CP3’s injury. One year later, Kevin Durant is injured and the Rockets have their best opportunity to win. And they lose. They absolutely deserve every bit of shit they get."
Not like they won 73 games with Kevin fucking Durant fuck warriors
Team that won 73 games Without Kevin Durant is still all time great team. What a shocker
Kevin Durant joined this team.
Was Kevin Durant in attendance? Seems like he should be there.
*Kevin Durant has left the chat.*     *Klay Thompson has entered the chat.*  &amp;#x200B;  *The Houston Rockets have left the chat.*
The Warriors are one of the best teams in the league without Kevin Durant? Wow!
Daryl morey is furiously typing up a report on how the Rockets were cost a trip to the WCF because...Kevin Durant got injured.
"#Rich Kleiman: *Hey Kevin, just wanted to check in on you.. ya know, see how the calf is doing?*  #KD: *Who is this?*  #Kleiman: *Oh it's me buddy... your agent... your right hand man... you remember me right?*  #KD: *Oh yeah, hey.*  #Kleiman: *Well I just wanted to make sure the NYC move was still on?*  #KD: *Uhhhh yeah, about that...*  #Kleiman: *Oh come on, don't bail out on me now!*  #KD: *You know who I am right?*  #Kleiman: *Of course I do! You're the Slim Reaper!*  #KD: *Nah nigga, I'm Kevin Durant.*  #Kleiman: *You're a god damn Snake! I knew I should've never trusted you!*  #KD: *laughs and ends the call while grinning and rubbing his calf*"
They didn't even need Kevin Durant.  LOL
"Should’ve won in 2015. And he’s put up good numbers in the last two, it’s just Kevin Durant has been amazing"
"Wojnarowski's full report:  ""The last straw for him, I was told, was when Cousins made those comments about 'my quad injury was 100 times worse.' And if you remember, shortly after, Kevin Durant left Oakland and didn't want to be a part of that media glare there, and did not come back until the season was over with."""
Probably Kevin Durant
"Well, injured. Not just tired.  Iggy is arguing against the narrative that the Warriors are better without Kevin Durant. If he didn't sign it'd be much more difficult for them to coast in the RS and then turn it up for the playoffs, shortening their championship window."
Yes this is why having Kevin Durant on your team is a good thing
"Maybe sign Kevin Durant, trade for Ibaka and WB. Team would be dope."
"Cupcake thinks he gets a statue.   """"I know for a fact that we'll all get our jerseys retired, we'll probably all get statues here in front of the Chase Center,"" Durant said.

no lol    that's lamarcus Aldridge  kevin Durant and kawhi Leonard on the same team. and that's a lot scarier then we think
You're right. With some script.  https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/drake-tattoos-steph-curry-kevin-durant-13899109.php#photo-17557355
"I have played sports....and I still do now...but there are circumstances where players secretly hope the team loses. And anybody who tells u otherwise is being dishonest.   Players who barely get time and feel they are deserving of more definitely tend to hope the team loses for the vindication of making the coach re-think things, maybe even in pertains to their pt  There are other scenarios too, and I feel this one with KD is likely one...where the player is going to seem almost obsolete if the team proves they can win without them.  I just don't see how u can pretend it's not a genuine possibility that Kevin Durant of ALL players wouldn't want this team to win the chip without him..which would damage his legacy further."
"I don’t know how many times I have to repeat myself in this thread. Yea it’s Steph fucking curry, it’s Kevin Durant, it’s klay Thompson you can only try to stop those guys. If they are hot for an entire series then no one can beat them. Am I blaspheming for suggesting the raptors have the best set of tools of the playoff teams to slow that down? Like if you watch GS games, those guys sometimes miss! Sometimes multiple times in a row!   I think I’ll just put a disclaimer on every comment that says duuh warriors are still heavy favourites"
"It's not wrong at all...I find it crazy how u can pretend like KD isn't insecure about people saying the Warriors don't need him  Did u literally not see him arguing with Broussard last week about that? Why even waste the energy if it doesn't bother u?   It's not just that either...KD has a history now the past couple years of ultra sensitive and defensive behavior...and he himself has even admitted that he's insecure on multiple occasions.   We're talking about a dude that created other accounts to argue with and defend himself to 12 year olds online...and u really think this man would want his team to win the whole title without him...which would show that he's pretty much just a luxury and not in any way a necessity? Of all players that would bother Kevin Durant is probably number 1 on the list.   U can claim and pretend it's made up all u want, even though it's an educated claim based off consistent behavior from KD...but it is what it is...u haven't even explained why what I'm saying is so dumb or countered it. Not that this discussion genuinely matters anyways, we're not talking about anything that important..but u could at least provide some sort of reasoning considering I'm just going off common sense"
Not like I do. I’ve already filled out the paperwork to legally change my 3 year old sons name to “Kevin Durant”
"People are taking notice... hopefully my favorite human on Earth, Kevin Durant, also visits r/nba"
KEVIN DURANT
I love Kevin Durant.
"**FUCK KEVIN DURANT HE WAS UP 3-1, GOT DADDY’D BY THE WARRIORS AND THEN JOINED THEM LIKE THE PUSSY HIS MOTHER RAISED HIM TO BE, THEY DONT NEED HIM**"
"Ok, so are u saying they really needed Kevin Durant to beat the LA Clippers in a series? I mean what's ur point here?.."
"It’s very rare that you get to witness this level of greatness, especially this level of greatness on a team with such likeable personalities.  Watching the warriors win is simply fun, nobody goes on as explosive runs as they do, few teams show the outward emotion they do, few teams show the teamwork that they do.   This isn’t like watching the villain come down and ruin your day (looking at you lebron). These are the leagues good guys, mostly all team drafted guys and “washed up vets” (oh yeah and Kevin Durant), so it’s nice to see them go down in history.   That being said either of the final 3 teams winning would have made me pretty happy, I wanted the Bucks to get one, but if the raptors win that’s still dope."
No team in the NBA is better without Kevin Durant
Yeah I mean I notice that every time it looked like they might get better they took a back step and they tried harder in the 2010's let's hope the 2020's is a nice one for the Knicks rumors are they are getting Kevin Durant.
"I think this series is going to be the best NBA Finals since 2016. As fans I don’t believe we are going to be shortchanged.  I’m going with Toronto in 6.   From Golden State’s point of view, I think there’s a few reasons I’m betting against them.  Number One - the big elephant in the room - all of the injuries and constant shuffling of lineups. They were able to get away with it easily against the Rockets and Blazers but this Toronto team is a different animal, especially on the defensive side of the ball. It’s like playing the Clippers except they got Kawhi Leonard - one of the best ballers on planet Earth. The OG Warriors have adapted back to their old style without Kevin Durant - crazy ball movement which is the foundation of their success that got them their first chip in 2015 and not to mention the 73 win historic season. If this series begins heated, (1-1 or 2-0 Toronto without KD), they could rush him back in a panic to try and get the series back in Golden State’s momentum, this could heal them, or hurt them in regards to another chemistry fluctuation. Gonna be interesting.  Number 2 - Defense. The Warriors have been unanimously one of the best defensive teams in the league from 2015-2018, which was a huge reason for their championship success. This year is the first year since 2015 that the warriors have finished outside of the Top 10 in defensive rating. This is a concern because the Raptors are one of the best defensive teams in the league. They can switch everything 1 through 5 (not saying GSW can’t) but they’re just much more effective than the Warriors at it this year, major factor.  Extra little side note - Toronto already faced the best defense they’ll ever face in the playoffs and overcame it - Milwaukee. Will be interesting to see how sharp their sword is when attacking the Warriors now vulnerable defense (at times).  Number 3 - Home Court. This is the first time in the entire Warriors championship run since 2015 that they have not had home court advantage. I think this is quite a big deal. If they can lose to the Cavaliers in 7 (2016) with home court - what’s not to say the Raptors don’t have a chance?  I could go on a lot more but I think Vegas and fans alike are really underrating the Raptors chances in this series. They’re well coached, have players that play their roles beautifully and are content with them, have one of the best and most toughest defenses in the league (Defense wins championships), have an amazing home fanbase and have arguably the best 2 way player in the entire league (debatable with durant on the floor).  But we’ll see how it goes. So many variables that could change this series. Cousins still to come back and KD is a mystery."
"&gt;It completely changes,"" Green told ESPN's Rachel Nichols in an interview that will run Thursday on The Jump. ""I have to be more of a scoring threat when Kevin's not out there. I have to -- I really try to push the pace more when he's not out there. When Kevin's out there, we all have the luxury of just saying, 'OK, that set didn't work, we still got this guy to just throw a ball into it and get out of the way.' That luxury isn't there anymore, and also I think with Kevin being out, we're trying to make up 37 points again.""  Before Durant injured his right calf against the Houston Rockets in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals on May 8, he averaged 34 points a game in the postseason. Durant's availability for The Finals remains in question as he continues rehabbing the injury.  ""We're not going to make those 37 points again up just by walking the ball up the floor and thinking we're going to have the same trust running the set as if Kevin is on the floor,"" Green said. ""So how do you make up those points? Get extra possessions, get the pace to where you want it to be, get some easy buckets. That's how you make it up.""   &gt;Green also doesn't believe the Warriors should be concerned about the notion of whether they are including Durant enough in their day-to-day activities as he continues the rehab process.  ""I personally don't really put too much thought into making Kevin feel included because this is his team,"" Green said. ""He's a part of this ... everything we've done here, he's a part of. So I think there's so much noise that comes about, like, 'Oh, are they better or worse without Kevin?' Can we stop the conversation? Because it's idiotic. Do we play a different brand of basketball when Kevin's not out there? Absolutely. But you'd be idiotic to think that we shouldn't. We have to play a different brand of basketball, but the whole notion of, 'Are they better or worse with or without,' that's where all the noise comes from.  &gt;To that point, Green reiterated that he and Durant have moved on from their verbal altercation in November at the end of an overtime loss to the LA Clippers at Staples Center.  ""I think I just have looked at it from a different perspective,"" Green said. ""It wasn't necessarily that him being a free agent bothered [me]. We all go through that in this profession. It was more so the fact of, 'Are you with us or not?' That bothered me. But what I'll say is, after I had that moment, one thing Kevin told me is, 'Dude, you have to block out all of that. You see me coming here and work every day. You see me give my all to this team. You see everything, every second of every day. The media is gonna say what they want, but you see everything, you know I'm here, you know I'm with you.'  ""And it allowed me to focus on that. It allowed me to focus on what I see, what I can control and not what I can't see per se and what I can't control. And so I think that was just the point for me of where I had to look at it from a different standpoint. I had to stop listening to all the noise.""

"Dude I’m a fan of all the Warriors now, I just hated on them because they always win and Kevin Durant went to the team that beat them and Draymond was always flopping, but after listening to Klay, Curry and Draymond get interviewed they all seem real cool and like-able"
Kevin Durant?
Yeah so these last 3 finals you’d be able to interchange those names with Kevin Durant am I right?
Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant. Still can't believe they never even made the finals.
No Capela + Kevin Love on the floor = Kevin Durant destroying them in the paint
Kevin Durant switches sports and is buying a house in New York to be the face of the Buffalo Bills to prove how great he really is

"Only reason he hasn't DOMINATED the biggest stage, is because he's shared the court in the finals with Lebron James and sometimes Kevin Durant. Of course you're not just going to dominate everyone when you're going up against a consensus Top 5 player of all time."
Yeah I think they could. Kevin Durant is the best player in the world. Agreed it would be tough without Durant OR Curry though.
"Kevin ""Rock Lee"" Durant"
"You can be competitive when watching a game but still understand that its okay to like the raptors AND be friends with Kevin Durant and Steph Curry.   Drake talking shit when its the Eastern Conference Finals is fine, I was talking about people who literally live through their teams and talk shit about every other team online. Drake isn’t one of those people so he’s able to be a fan of multiple NBA teams.  There is nothing wrong with being a fan of multiple NBA teams lol, people who have a problem with that are dick heads."
KD: “I’m Kevin Durant”   Dray: “I’m Draymond”   Klay: “I’m high as shit”
They didn't hate on him that bad I just see people hating on Kevin Durant and Toronto bitter over fans about Vince Carter recently.
You missed GOLD DIGGER- Kevin Durant dude literally went to the warriors to get a few easy rings
"Lil B might be a Warriors fan, but he can never take away this gem. \  [Fuck Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBQ2mjkvYY8)"
And another PF named Kevin Durant?
"I just love the “James Harden is easily a top 5 player in the league” comments. So where does that leave LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo? Not saying he isn’t special, but easily...not really. I have him 6 or 7th in my book."
I am interested in the 2020's NBA how will it differ from the 2010's ? Imo the 2010's NBA was all about Lebron James Steph Curry Kevin Durant Kawhi Leonard and it is fitting it ends with the same players who made the finals in the decade. Just to point facts LA Bos Mia Dallas OKC SA GS Cle Tor were the only teams to make the Finals in the 2010's. It wasn't an open door decade for most teams since Miami GSW and Cleveland dominated most of the appearances. And the decade was the decline of the Lakers. I think competition will be spread out in the 2020's and we might get different diverse Finals matchups more like the 2000's. I think the 2020's will be the re emergence of the Big man too.
"&gt;  In other situations, we saw Kobe make it a point to go directly at Lebron, and for Lebron to avoid that competition and confrontation.  They went at each other. They both bought into the hype. And Lebron dominated the Lakers. Lebron went 16-6 against Kobe in their careers. Kobe dropped 35 or more against James 3 times and James dropped 35 or more on Kobe 5 times. They definitely enjoyed the competition. Even in the all-star game James took the challenge of guarding Kobe in their crazy hyped matchup.  James Harden plays point guard. He handles the ball the most Chris Paul actually plays the 2. But if you consider him a point guard then yes he's better than Klay. But that's really it.  McCollum is not as good defensively as Klay. Neither is Mitchell because of his size. Butler and Derozan are not close to the shooter Klay is as one of the best shooters all time. Their dribbling skills vs his shooting skills are a trade off that evens things out. Derozan also isn't the defender Klay is.  Lebron plays a smart game. But he is a highlight machine regardless especially because of his athletic play. Watching Lebron you can learn a lot about professional basketball that's what I did. Especially when he is going up against a smart defender like Draymond. For example, this is a play that the Cavs liked to run to get Kevin Love open shots: https://streamable.com/gxrbd  The Cavs try to force a point guard (in this case Vanvleet) to switch onto Love and the Love's defender to switch onto a guard (in this case George Hill). Both the big and the guard hesitate to switch because they know it will be a mismatch, and Love takes advantage of the confusion by sprinting to the rim. If the guard does switch onto Love, then Love can shoot over him, or back him down into a postup. During the switch Hill would also be open at the 3 point line as the big slowly moves to switch on him.  This play doesn't work against great defenders like Draymond: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond Green has memorized the play and know what the Cavs want to do. So this becomes a chess match between James and Draymond everyone else is just a pawn. Draymond recognizes the action and goes to stand in Kevin Love's way breaking up the pass and open shot. James immediately recognizes this and calls Draymond's man Tristan Thompson to set a screen for him. He rubs off Durant, and knows he will get an open mid-range shot because Draymond is committed to Love on the baseline. Lebron gets the open shot and Draymond is late contesting. Lebron wins the possession.   Also, I think you're forgetting about prime Lebron who even more of a highlight machine than anyone: https://streamable.com/cjriw. You're comparing old Lebron to prime Kobe. Old Kobe just took a lot of contested 2s. There's nothing especially exciting about that. Prime Kobe was a much more varied scorer like prime Lebron."
"Yea honestly I can't believe this sub values Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green more than Delledova, JR Smith, and Tristin Thompson. It's honestly sickening. They're not even on the same level, Lebron got waaaaay more help."
"""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am."""
"""The Klaw"" is sorta like ""The Glove"", except it sounds more sinister and you can match more letters. Instead of just the G in Gary Payton, you can get KL from Kawhi Leonard. It's one of the better nicknames around.  I think most of Shaq's nicknames were pretty bad, aside from odd gems like The Big Shaqtus. The volume, average quality, and the fact that Shaq came up with all of them for himself really doesn't help. The nicknames have mostly been carried by Shaq's incredible charisma.  On the flipside, Kevin Durant has a lot of really good nicknames that he doesn't want to use."
" &gt;But enjoy life calling anyone who disagrees with you dumb  I enjoy calling people with dumb opinions dumb. The Warriors don't have to be the same as 2017 to completely and utterly outclass the 2018 Cavs. That is one of the worst overall teams that LeBron has ever had, and the 2018 Warriors, despite you saying they are ""not at all the same"", guess what? They still had Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson. It is so glaringly obvious that the Cavs(who got swept) had no chance that I'm going to call you dumb for believing any different.  I don't care how ""tired"" they were after that grueling 7 game series. The Cavs were garbage. A sweep is a sweep. One game isn't going to change everything like you think it would. Why can't people wrap their mind around how amazing the Warriors are?"
"Kawhi’s playoff stats this year are considered historically great, though he’s a different type of player than LeBron, I think his contributions can be considered comparable.  Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakim don’t have the offensive firepower of prime Kyrie and Kevin Love, but they are much better on defence and can contribute fairly well on offence (if inconsistently). Also, this year’s Warriors are not as deep and are arguably not as good sans Durant as their previous Durant-less incarnations.   That said, if I’m being as objective as possible I would still pick the Warriors given the above because they are so good even a few dents in their armour don’t make them beatable. Once Durant comes back it’s over for the Raps, until then, I think we’ll have a competitive series."
"Draymond Green on Kevin Durant getting dropped from the Finals due to injury rehab: “I’m kind of like a kid who grew up in the hood and then took my homie out the hood, then one day just dropping him back in the hood and going on without him.”"
"C'mon, this notion is absurd. It's ridiculous and selfish for a Warriors fan to expect Looney to take a substantial paycut this summer if a better deal is available, and equally absurd to suggest they'd do it if they were in his shoes.  First, in regards to players taking paycuts: Durant took paycuts in 2017 and 2018 bc he's worth +$300M with endorsements and his previous deals...also, he had his 10+ year 35% veteran max on the horizon. Klay and Draymond took 'only' a couple million less per year on their sophomore contracts ($15M-$16M per year instead of $17M-$18M, knowing a full payday was likely coming for their third deals. Kevon Looney does not have this luxury at all.  After getting a rather generous sophomore contract at the time, just a couple million per year short of the maximum contract possible, Steph opted to take every penny of his 'Supermax' DVPE two summers ago. Iguodala is going to be making +$17M next season at age 36, inflating his value via free agency rumors that turns out were likely created by his agent. I'll go out on a limb and say if Klay and/or Durant re-sign, they're both going for every penny this time around. Kevin has already made it abundantly clear that he wants a max deal, and after publicly realizing he's out $30M because of All-NBA Team voters, Thompson will be looking for a significant payday this summer to understandably lessen that burn.  As for Kevon: What's the average career span for a big in today's league? What's the average career span for a role-playing big? What's the career span for a role-playing big w/ two major hip operations before his career even really started? If he's truly lucky, Looney will play in this league for 10-12 years. That's it.  12 years to earn what he and his family will likely live off of for the rest of their lives. His sophomore contract reflected how valuable the league considered him just last summer...no one was really interested in paying him more than somewhere around the qualifying minimum, if not just a million or two more. Now, that's an understandable paycut at that time, but expecting him to leave anything above $5M per year to stay here for somewhere around $2M as someone else suggested...wow. I'd love to have him stay with us, as he's proved incredibly valuable, but if a team like the Suns wants to offer him substantially more than the Warriors are prepared to, then I will be at the airport wishing him well if the opportunity presented itself. It's the right move."
He [confirmed](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/its-official-warriors-loss-in-nba-finals-gained-them-kevin-durant/) it.
"""waste time"" it isnt a novel concept, kevin durant on the warriors has existed for 2 years. The raptors have faced the warriors in that time, as well as the assistant coach and defensive specialist adrian griffin was on OKC for 2 years in the western conference and had game planned for kevin durant before. I think theyll be just fine. Being more prepared allows greater confidence and control, the raptors did themselves a favour and didnt waste a moment."
No shit.  Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team lol.
"It sure is, and that's a good argument that the guy who mainly guarded Kevin Durant during the 2017 Finals shouldn't (and didn't) win FMVP."
Does he have an offer from a team he wants to play for for 4 years?  Does he want to play in his hometown?  Do they have any other way to acquire him?  Did the same thing happen not 2 years ago with Chris Paul?   Once again -- Vegas has Houston as the 2nd most likely team to land him.   This just seems like a weird thing to be so stubbornly dismissive about. It's not like I'm saying Milwaukee is going to cut Giannis or Kevin Durant is going to retire. Plenty of weirder stuff than Jimmy Butler to Houston has happened in the past few summers.
"SI, ESPN and Bleacher Report ranked him top 10 in 2017. The Washington Post didn't, but had him at...12. Which, for the sake of my argument lol, is close enough.  https://www.si.com/nba/2017/09/14/nba-top-100-players-2018-lebron-james-stephen-curry-kevin-durant  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarank110/nbarank-players-1-10  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2737803-nba-player-rankings-top-100-players-before-2017-18-season-tips-off#slide52  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/nba-top-100-players-2017/?utm_term=.4922a6764acb"
Yeah they should probably sign Kevin Durant for $2 this off-season.
why is kevin durant waluigi
"Not a fan of his game tbh  He seem to have played better when he's the one controlling the ball, but I think Lebron being there would halt his development a lot.   He's also not that great of a shooter, and doesnt really contribute to much outside of scoring.  Ive also heard comparisons to Kevin Durant before cause he's ""LaNkY"" but he's nowhere near as skilled Durant was at that age."

"new TV deals kicked in and the NBA salary cap rose by a huge amount suddenly and almost every team has cap space. It was a good summer to be a free agent since a lot of crappy players got near max deals their teams and canvases regret to this day.  Even where, because of the cap jump, even the warriors were able to do singe trades and clear cap room, resulting in then sighing Kevin the snake Durant that year.       All in all a very eventful off season."
Kevin Durant is a bitch
"I don't think this series is going to be as close as people are predicting.   1. Even without Kevin Durant, the Warriors have proven they can win. **Steph and Klay have the ability to go off on any given night, and Kawhi can only guard one of them.** This gets amplified when KD comes back. 2. The Warriors have already **proven they can beat elite opposition without KD** this offseason (Houston is a better team than Toronto). Their role players stepped up when called upon that series.  3. **I don't think KD's injury is a serious as it is being made out to be.** I think he should be back by game 2. If the Raptors don't get at least a split at home, I see the Warriors sweeping.  4. **Underestimating Draymond Green** vs. Gasol or Ibaka: Draymond has proven time and again he can handle bigger opposition when matched up against them.  5. **Bench Play:** While we haven't seen much of them during the regular season, the Warriors bench really stepped up when called upon this post-season. We saw it after KD went down in the Houston series, and the Portland series, but the Warriors still have one the best benches in the league. They know their roles, and guys like Livingston and Iguodala, and even Looney and Bell can give quality minutes. Furthermore, even if DeMarcus Cousins can give just 10-12 minutes per game, that would be huge.  6. **Kawhi can't do it all:** The Raptors have been able to get away with Kawhi bailing them out against the Bucks and Sixers, but against a team defense like the Warriors, it won't work. Additionally, the Warriors have Iguodala who can still hold his own against elite offensive players 7. **Coaching/Experience:** Steve Kerr (along with Pop) is the best coach in the game today. He surely has tricks up his sleeve, and this is Nurse's first time to the finals. Same can be said about the Warriors team, the experience the bring at this stage will be huge.   **Prediction**: 4-1 Warriors."
Kevin Durant is a snek

I prefer Kevin Durant.
The game will be a lot easier if Kevin Durant isn’t running so I have to say it favours the raptors
"I get the sarcasm but if they'd won the championship I really doubt KD joins them, basically they traded 1 championship and an overpaid Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant in his prime."
Article I read was from today:   [https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2019-05-28-report-kevin-durant-selling-house-in-bay-area-buying-place-in-new-york/](https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2019-05-28-report-kevin-durant-selling-house-in-bay-area-buying-place-in-new-york/)
Ah yes the 2010 lakers championship team of Kobe pau and metta is LOADED and TOTALLY EQUIVALENT to a 73 Win team +  kevin Durant
"I agree, I don’t think it was truly a net negative either (he still had to go and play and perform at a high level after all) but it’s a pyrrhic victory. He’s added to his legacy, but at what cost? He wants to be great and he wants to be respected, and it’s clear that he cares a great deal what people think of him. Everybody does. So when he goes into this situation likely thinking that him winning a ring as a first option would absolve a good deal of the criticism from the move, and he finds that in many ways it’s only worsened (what other two time reigning finals mvp has ever had their team be called better or just as capable without them?) that’s GOT to bother him. And again, by his behavior on social media, it’s not hard to presume that it indeed does bother him. He’s a human being with millions of people judging his every move almost every day of his life. How they interpret him is inevitably a sizeable part of his day to day thinking. So when they see his obvious greatness night after night year after year and they leave thinking, “Man this dude is phenomenal. Soft as fuck tho. He has no heart, you gotta put an asterisk next to those championships” that’s gotta really fuck with him. Talent only gets you so far. Greatness only gets you so far. People will never forget how you made them feel, and Kevin Durant made a lot of people feel disgusted when he went to Golden State.  So was it worth it? Was the two rings worth the debate about him devolving into whether or not winning them with GSW was a net negative for his legacy? For a lot of people it probably wouldn’t be worth it. I gotta imagine there would be a great deal of buyer’s remorse."
"Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Rudy Gobert... or maybe Anthony Davis and KAT instead of Durant and Gobert."
What if Kevin Durant was 8 feet tall?
Well they are better when they are asking not to ask that question without asking them if they are better without Kevin Durant asking Kevin Durant if they are better without him
I really feel like there is high possibility that Kevin Durant reads r/nba and maybe comments on r/nba.
"&gt; I'm not sure if that is any indication that Lebron was intentionally taking a more difficult path to the championship.  This is why Kevin Durant's move is ridiculous - it's actually even changing the narrative around Lebron's move.  Lebron's move in no way claimed it was the most difficult decision. He did leave to form a superteam in Miami. But leaving to form a superteam is very different from leaving to *join* **the** superteam that beat you. If I'm unclear, I'm going to write that again.  Leaving to *form* a superteam is very different from leaving to *join* **the** superteam that beat **you**.  Both routes are taking an easier path to win - but Lebron never denied that fact. Kevin Durant on the other hand, went a step above and beyond what Lebron did **and** claimed that it was the ***hardest road***."
"Again - you're trying to bridge the two and equate them, but beyond each being a superstar leaving his original team in free agency, the two are not very similar at all.  Sports are very much about narrative. Lebron having no help. Lebron vs the Big Three. Lebron wanting to win a ring. LBJ's decision to leave definitely shook up how the NBA viewed superstars and their agency in picking their supporting cast, but if you refer back to the three narratives, Lebron was still against his adversaries. He was recruiting allies in his quest to beat the eternal enemy (dramatic for dramatic's sake).  Was he wrong to leave his teammates and give up on winning with that roster? I could definitely see an argument for it. I mean, my goodness, he got to the Finals with stalwarts like *Drew Gooden* and *Zydrunas Ilgauskas* defending the Cavalier paint whilst **clear** HOF shooters like *Daniel Gibson* and *Donyell Marshall* anchored his wings.  Honestly, the more I see it, Kevin Durant was the **real** victim here. Dude got to the Finals in 2012 carrying scrubs like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Derek Fisher, and Kendrick Perkins. With that cast? No way he could win against Lebron, absolutely zero chance of winning with those cats. Don't even get me started with 2016, he may have had the GOAT Kyle Singler on his team, but the rest of that cast? Russell ""Noah's dad"" Westbrook, Steven ""ball'less"" Adams, Enes Kanter, Andre Roberson, Serge ""just a chef"" *fuckin'* Ibaka - talk about *LUDICROUS* to imagine Kevin Durant winning anything with that team. They probably struggled to break .500 and were bounced early by the Spurs or something...  Oh wait, they crushed Dallas in Round 1, defeated the 67-15 Spurs in 6, and were 3-1 up against the Warriors before losing 3 straight, with KD going 12-31, 10-31, and an admittedly respectable 10-19 in Games 5, 6, and 7 respectively (Russ did have a stinker going 7-21 in Game 7).   I'm going to take off the mask and say definitively - no, KD's situation was not like Lebron's. KD's situation cannot be classified as no help. KD's situation cannot be classified as repeatedly failing against a bigger, better, and stronger team - OKC had faced the Warriors **once**, and had a 3-1 series lead. KD bailed at the first sign of adversity, which explains his insecurity. There could be a serious argument for OKC having enough pieces to win the chip (and good management to bring better pieces if need be), KD's decision was very soft and nobody can or should respect it.   The closest situation to Kevin Durant's case is Lebron James' decision, but that does not mean they are indeed close, just that Kevin Durant's is so absolutely outlandish that nothing else comes close. I'm not a Thunder fan and I thoroughly enjoy roasting Russell Westbrook's selfish play, and I still get extremely riled up thinking of Kevin Durant's move. It was a straight up bitch-ass move and he deserves every bit of calling out for it."
It really isn’t when you consider the fact that that “one free agent” was fucking Kevin Durant. You’re acting like you added Jeremey Lamb to your team lmao. I dare you to make this a post and watch people laugh at you.
"&gt;We cant say Toronto put anything special around that man. No other superstars are there.  Too many people disrespect the rest of the Raptors. This isn't LeBron carrying some team of scrubs. Yes, Kawhi is the team's best player, but the rest of the cast around him is damn good. They were a 59 win team the year before Kawhi got there, and the supporting cast has gotten better since then (both with Pascal Siakam being the odds on favourite to win Most Improved Player and with them adding Marc Gasol). They were 17-5 in the games without Kawhi this year. They aren't a bunch of the flashy players, but they are 6-deep on all-NBA defenders, and have spent the whole playoffs so far holding quality offences well below their season averages. As for superstars, I guess everyone has their own definition, but Kyle Lowry has been an all-star the last 5 seasons...just sayin'.  Personally, my call is that he stays in Toronto. Generally, people don't leave good situations, they leave bad situations. Sure, when Kawhi wanted out of a bad situation, the first instinct he had was to request a trade to somewhere near home. But, that's not the situation he is in now. The situation now is that he has teammates he gels with. He likes the coaching staff. He is playing the best basketball of his career in a Raptor uniform. He likes the training staff, and has to appreciate the team resting him 22 games for load management, after his experience in San Antonio. He is on a quality team full of winners, but one where he still gets to be the unquestioned top dog. The team features a young emerging star in Siakam, and other young talent like Anunoby, VanVleet, Powell, etc. The team is one of the best run in the league, with the likely executive of the year (who would be winning the honour for the second time) running it. He is in the largest unshared market in the NBA (Toronto is the league's third largest city, and both LA and NY have two teams each), and has been embraced by one of the most passionate fan bases in the league.  Will Kawhi get all that with the Clippers? Maybe. But, he won't know most of that until well after making his decision. He doesn't know how he will gel with the other guys on the Clippers, on or off the court. He doesn't know how he will get along with the coaching staff or management. He doesn't know whether he will end up trusting the training staff. The Clippers would be an excellent team on paper if he joined, but the Celtics can tell you how much that means. He might be the number one basketball star in LA, but would have to compete with LeBron to do so, and might even end up playing second string to Kevin Durant on his own team. He might find a drama-free environment where he can enjoy playing basketball, but he could also end up in a dysfunctional mess like LeBron did when he left Cleveland to go to the Lakers last year.  No one really knows what is going through Kawhi's mind, but Kawhi himself. That having been said, unless he really values playing near home super highly, I expect he will take the bird in the hand. He is in a great situation with the Raptors. He has clearly enjoyed himself this year, and has the chance to be the premier basketball icon in the history of Canada. I would be surprised to see him turn that down for a question mark."
"I'm with you. I don't feel as if he impacts the game as much as a LeBron, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, a Giannis or a Kawhi. I've never felt this way but the media has parroted the top 5 or even best player in the league narrative for a while now."
"Dude if you can’t understand what’s uncompetitive about:  A. Joining the team that’s fresh off embarrassing you the previous playoffs  B. The second/third best player in the world (Steph) begging for help from the other second/third best player in the world (KD) after the then-best player in the world embarrassed them. If Steph was competitive he’d take that as a slight, improve his game, add a few roster tweaks and come back harder to prove himself. Instead he begged for help.  C. A team’s entire starting line up attending a free agency pitch (literally unheard of. I’ve checked and this shit does not happen in the slightest)  D. Doing all of the above in order to guarantee yourself a championship before the season even starts.  Then idk what to tell you. I guess you’ve just never played competitive sports.  &gt; Your little fantasy of players seeking the harder road and being competitive by intentionally keeping themselves in inferior environments is a fucking joke.  Except that’s not what I’m suggesting in the slightest. I’m suggesting that when a player loses and gets embarrassed on the biggest stage, they take that loss personally and attempt to get better at the sport, as opposed to running and begging for help.  &gt; Players have been teaming up and forming super teams since the 60s. This is nothing new.  MVP’s don’t usually team up like this. Historically MVP caliber players view each other as the main competition. Sure, they’ll have a couple of regular all star players on their team. But in terms of top 5 players joining up (let alone after losing to each other in the playoffs) is extremely rare.  Players have also never showed up to the actual free agency meeting with ownership. If you can show me just one other instance of this happening I will delete my account.  There’s a reason the KD move is still talked about to this day. There’s a reason even *KD himself* still spends time trying to defend it. A move as soft as that is literally unheard of. There’s a reason KD’s peers don’t respect him. Look at what Kobe (one of the most competitive players in nba history) said about him fucking *today*  [**If you’re doing something that’s so easy, you might want to reconsider what you’re doing**](https://fadeawayworld.net/2019/05/28/kobe-bryant-says-he-would-have-stayed-in-okc-if-he-were-kevin-durant/)   I think that logic applies both to Steph and KD. Don’t you?  And I’m sure there’s plenty of players who feel the same way. They just can’t say anything because they come off as “salty”, when in reality what they’re feeling is totally valid. Why would anyone respect players who don’t have to overcome any sort of adversity? What’s impressive about knowing a team is going to win it all before the season even starts? That’s not competitive to me.  You’re entitled to your opinion and you support your team. That’s cool. But if you actually look at the players on the Warriors and think “damn those are some real competitors who strive through adversity” you are delusional."
*Kevin Durant has decided on the 2003 Draft class to sign with in the summer.*
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Ray Allen  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Dirk Nowitzki  C: Shaquille O’Neal  The spacing on this team is insane.
"Here’s a direct quote from KD that he lives in San Francisco.  &gt;In fact, KD is the only player on the current roster living in San Francisco.  &gt;“I wanted to be in the big city and mix it up a little bit,” Durant told The Undefeated. “It’s close to the [Bay] Bridge and the practice facility and arena [in Oakland]. I wanted to try it out. I’ve never lived in a big city before by myself. I wanted to learn more about the flow of the city.”  [Source](https://theundefeated.com/features/warriors-kevin-durant-is-enjoying-big-city-life-in-san-francisco/amp/)"
"Due to how bad most cavs team were in defense the Warriors had mostly a smooth sailing in finals. Apart for that incredible 2016 Lebron run , GSW had more trouble in WCF than in the actual finals. For the first time they face an actual team , instead one that defends on the highest of levels and when something doesn't work adjusts. Lebron was great, certainly the best player of his generation but he also made his teams too reliant in his individual performance (not due to a fault of his own most possibly, in a weird way he/his teams was/were victims of how far greater he was from anybody else on the court).  IMO this one would be the most competitive finals we had in years. Not only is this Toronto arguably a better team than any Cavs team (even the one that won it all), not so in personel but mostly in team spirit, coaching defensive schemes, but also GSW has the most notable absence of big men in all of their years plus a doubtful Kevin Durant.   GSW are at their most vulnerable, IMO still the favourites (A the Raptors must be dead tired by now), but they won't get it without a serious fight."
Kevin Durant   Kyrie Irving   RJ Barrett   Welcome to Knicks era.
Devin Durrant. He was like Kevin Durant but with more D.
Kevin Durant seems to be a pretty good quality.
"You are really big on context until it doesn't exactly support your narrative. The Spurs got swept in 2017 because Kawhi got injured game 1. They were up 20 before he went down.   The Spurs did have good role players when going against the Heat, but the Heat had the better top end talent and still had solid role players of their own.  The result? The biggest point differential in NBA finals history. Just because Chris Bosh was only an all star and not all-NBA and had to sacrifice his stats to play with Lebron doesn't mean he wasn't a great player.  You just named Kyrie with 29 and Kevin Love with 16/11 and acted as if that was not an excellent supporting cast... Also they had JR Smith, Kyle Korver, Tristan Thompson, and Richard Jefferson. That's a MUCH better supporting cast then what Harden had. Also, Jordan has never had a teammate average over 25 in any of his finals, and never had 2 all stars.  So the Rockets were better because of their defense? That's actually true! Because the supposedly best player in the NBA was such an incapable defender that he had to be hidden on Draymond Green, oftentimes leaving Richard Jefferson to guard Kevin Durant. While the other teams best player (Kevin Durant) took on the challenge of guarding Lebron on one end and on the other end dropped 35/8/5.5 on 70% TS. But the lack of defensive impact doesn't show up on the stat sheet, so to Lebron and his fans it doesn't even matter right? (Incoming cherry picked advanced defensive stats?)  Now let's take a look at 2007, since that horrid performance is often given a pass, fans (especially the stans) never even revisit it. In a pivotal Game 3 in Cleveland, down 2-0 and with a chance to make this a series, the Cavs lost by just 3 points. Lebron dropped 25 on a whopping 47% TS with 5 turnovers. In Game 4, with a chance to save yourself from embarrassment, the Cavs lost by only 1 point. Lebron dropped 24 on an incredible 37% TS and 6 turnovers. If Lebron played even slightly below his expectations, that series goes 2-2 and who knows what happens from there. His teammates weren't the reason they got swept, he was.  Yes, he was young at the time so maybe he deserves a pass, but he absolutely deserves the blame for being swept in that series.  But wait, Jordan never even got past the 1st round when he was that young!!! That's true, but let's check his numbers from the first round series when he was 22.  Against one of the best Celtics teams of all time, Jordan (at 22 years old) averaged 44/6/6 on 58% TS with 2.3 steals, 1.3 blocks and 4.6 turnovers. This was also right after coming back from a broken foot that caused him to miss 64 games. Compare that to Lebron (at 22 years old) against one of the best Spurs teams of all time, where he averaged 22/7/7 on 43% TS with 1 steal, 0.5 block, and 5.8 turnovers. You know who could've made that Spurs series interesting and potentially won it? The GOAT."
"Formatted as PPG:  2018: Lebron James, 34.0  2017: Kevin Durant, 35.2  2016: Lebron James, 29.7  2015: Lebron James, 35.8  2014: Lebron James, 28.2  2013: Lebron James, 25.3  2012: Kevin Durant, 30.6"

Exactly. I've been watching ball for 15 years now. And before Kevin Durant 2016. There was ALWAYS speculation on who could win. Nowadays its not even a topic...
&gt;4 Steph Curry  &gt;2 Kevin Durant   &gt;1 LeBron James  You dont need to read this
That's the decoy Kevin Durant. The real Kevin Durant is.... stealing the ball and going up for the layup! Two points!!
"Yes, we should compare it to Leonard’s non-heaves.  Why should someone be penalized for being a good team player?    Players like LeBron and Kevin Durant are *known* for caring about their shooting percentages so much that they no longer throw up heaves."
"Those measurements are notoriously inaccurate. For example, it's an open secret that Kevin Durant is a 7+-footer but he's always listed at 6' 10. There was an article on this quite recently."
"ah shit, he's going to manage to trade a resurgent john wall for kevin durant, only for durant to come back better than before isn't he?"
"Championship is a championship except for the warriors last 3 championships because of one injury to a player, and KLove and Irving I’m 2015.  Demarcus cousins torn quad. Kevin Durant ruptured Achilles. Klay Torn ACL. Curry dislocated finger and twisted ankle. Looney fractures collar bone. Igoudala bad calf. And you’re saying no one should say Injuries aren’t a big reason raptors won? Fuck outta here"
Yes if the universe also didn't have LeBron and Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard.
"""I'm Post-Achilles Kevin Durant."""
Good to know! This is the article for reference.   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2841232-nba-rumors-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-met-in-new-york-to-talk-2019-free-agency?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app  You guys are brutal. Downvotes for just being a messenger. Wasn’t even my take.
"All Decade 1st Team has to be, I'm pretty certain: Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Lebron James."
"I feel like if this happened to Lebron or even Kevin Durant, we would literally never hear the end of it, and it wouldn't be referred to as ""really not that bad""  I'm embarrassing for a player of his caliber to make a mistake like that"
"So no more Kevin ""The Minion"" Durant?"
I can't believe Kevin Durant is fucking dead
"It’s Kevin fucking Durant, I’m sure they could’ve gotten any second second tier star and a good player or two."
"Kevin Durant might have changed the series, but Chris Paul might have changed game 7 last year, and Kyrie and Kevin Love might have changed the 2015 Finals.  As for the rest, Boogie was injured when he signed (which is why they could afford him). Klay played most of the series and the Raps were consistently the better team. And, Kevon Looney is still just Kevon Looney, and still played most of the series. Teams are banged up this time of year. Kawhi was playing on a gimpy knee, and Kyle has been playing with a thumb injury that will require offseason surgery for two rounds. FVV lost a tooth to Livingston's elbow and OG Anunoby missed the whole playoffs with appendicitis.   I don't know what juggernaut-bowl you are talking about, but as for that torch, consider it passed. Whatever juggernaut you are waiting for is welcome to try to take it from us next year."
"Was a difficult personality to deal with from the get-go, starting with skipping his exit meeting after his rookie season. And about KD and Irving, Zach Lowe reported that KP wasn't happy with the KD rumors because he didn't want to share the spotlight. That's absurd to me, KP was a rising star but Kevin Durant is one of the greatest ever.   Also his brother Janis was threatening to leave for a while. They just weren't a cooperative duo and made things very difficult. Super talented player, but very difficult personality."
"[He’s huge, can move, shoot, basically do everything. Projected as another Anthony Davis/ Kevin Durant](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/03/28/whos-next-after-zion-7-foot-1-james-wiseman-could-be-no-1-nba-draft-pick-in-2020/amp/)"
But then how would you have gotten Kevin durant?
"&gt;I'll still say Masai trading DeRozan is a snake move. I don't like how Masai did it, but I won't say it's the wrong move.   I really don't like this ""snake"" narrative that gets pushed when GMs or players do something certain fans don't like. Masai traded a basketball asset under fair terms, there is nothing snakelike about it. I hate that KEVIN Durant joined GSW after losing to them in playoffs, but that is also not a snake move, he was a free agent and free to join whoever he wanted.  Dont hate the playa, hate the game."
"as you're asking for what's quantifiable - from ages 22 to 28 (the reggie/klay age overlap, klay entered at 21 but reggie entered at 22), reggie averaged 27.8 points per 100 possessions (equalising for the era) on 62.7 TS%, while leading the pacers to being a playoff team, with largely no-one else (besides chuck person for a year or two) spacing the floor for him. in the same age range, klay averaged an admittedly higher 29.1 points per 100 possessions on much lower 57.7 TS%, despite having steph curry and (later) kevin durant on the floor with him. klay doesn't carry the primary scoring load - reggie did, he was the top scorer on his team from for 5 of those 7 years, while klay never was. yet, klay's usage is 3.1% higher because reggie was a more efficient player  although klay has played on a better team which has notched up more wins, throughout those years from 22 to 28, reggie outperforms him in WS and WS/48, as well as BPM and VORP  https://imgur.com/a/0kwXNJr stats  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millere01.html"
"&gt; KD is absolutely an elite defender and shot blocker  Fucking laughable statement. Kevin “elite defender” Durant who has never made an all defensive team in his life. You think he’ll win DPOY this year?  &gt; He could absolutely contain Kawhi.   You have to be trolling. This cannot be a serious statement.  &gt; The Rockets had Nene to back up Capela   Lmao  &gt; Guard play is much more important against the Warriors than having a star forward.   Whether it’s a guard of a forward it doesn’t matter. You’re claiming having a star forward is less impactful because GS have good defenders at the forward position. Meanwhile it’s Klay Thompson who usually picks up the opposing team’s best guard.  &gt; The Rockets had 3 guards in that series average 20+ ppg a game one being James Harden.  Okay? Good for them. That just means they weren’t very deep and rely on a small number of players for their scoring. Raptors are more spread out. That’s an advantage. Not sure how you’re trying to turn that into a negative.  &gt; Also, Chris Paul is a much more impactful player than fucking Kyle Lowry. Ask anybody especially last season. He’s a better defender almost always and he’s a better game manager as a point guard.   In his prime? Absolutely. Last season? Definitely not. I’ve brought the stats up for you. Better game manager? **He averaged less assists per game than Lowry on a higher amount of turnovers!!**. You can’t argue numbers bro. He’s also not a better defender in the slightest at this point in his career. Learn basketball.  &gt; Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet played a whole game and a half this series being guarded by either Steph Curry, Quinn Cook, or Shaun Livingston with Klay out and hurt. If Klay is in those numbers change. Same thing with Gasol’s TS%  Lowry and Fred played well whether Klay was playing or not. Look at the first 3 quarters of the last game. Klay was getting torched by Lowry. The fact is Lowry is just a really fucking good player. You can’t throw away an entire series worth of data just because Klay missed one game. That’s ridiculous.  At the end of the day you still haven’t given specific attributes the Houston team has that the raptors team doesn’t. Your only argument is “the Rockets were built to beat the Warriors”, and “Houston has James Harden, who is a guard, both of which are laughable   Houston had a chance to beat them without KD fucking *this season*. **This literally just happened and they’re really not that much worse than last season**. AND THEY STILL LOST IN 6!!! They had a golden opportunity and they fucking choked it. Is Houston slightly worse than last year? Sure. But KD was out and that offsets the difference by a mile.   You may not agree with me, but the fact that you’re grasping at the tiniest straws to support your argument shows you it’s not as clear cut as you believe it to be. The fact that you think it would be a sweep or 5 games is insane."
"Just curious to see what people think about this, but does anyone feel that the warriors lack of depth on the bench and the fact that their starting 5 were playing a tonne of minutes resulted in the injuries to in particular Kevin Durant and in a way klay(although with klay it was just a horrific landing). Just curious to see what people thinks because I couldn’t help but feel that was the case!"
"Imagine being a sophomore or junior in college that landed a wonderful opportunity to intern for the summer at Kleiner Perkins. You walk in your first day, maybe you're asked to make some extra copies of something...and then you see Kevin fuckin' Durant next to you hobbling on crutches trying not to drop the 4-cup carrier from the Starbucks in the lobby."
"OG Anunoby, who started every game in last year's playoffs and played 20 mpg in this year's regular season, missed every game.  In 2015, Kevin Love played 0 games (0 minutes) and Kyrie Irving played 1 game (44 minutes).  This year, Kevin Durant played 1 game (12 minutes) and Klay Thompson played 5 games (188 minutes). Klay isn't comparable.  Do you seriously not see the difference? Steph had to deal with no Durant, but Klay was available and really good for most of the series. Klay was still 3rd in total scoring behind Steph and Kawhi while Kyrie was in the same range as James Jones and Festus Ezeli.  Steph and Klay (plus Draymond) nearly took the series to 7 with no KD, but Klay got hurt when they were nearly there, not Steph nearly took a team with no Klay or KD into a game 7. You don't get to count the games Klay played and helped win as Steph carrying a team without Klay."
"I think if Kevin Durant had not been injured and he played in this series, the viewership would be even higher. No matter what the media and the people say, that dude just rakes in the viewers, whether he's in Golden State or wherever. I'll be back next year"
not at all. i'm saying they're bad relative to other people in the top 500 out of millions.  no shit anybody in the nba is fucking amazing at basketball. that doesnt mean jonas jerebko and kevin durant are equally skilled.
He is friends with Kevin Durant. Had dinner with him during the finals.
"The funny thing is, a former NFL doctor said the exact opposite thing. Pro athletes actually test their Achilles because their calves are too strong.   Regular non athletes tear their Achilles because it's too weak becauee they havent exercised it in years   https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/nba/story/2019-06-11/nba-finals-kevin-durant-achilles-injury-warriors-free-agency"
Eh you still have the most embarrassing loss in nba history. That title was worth it. Also you had to cry to Kevin Durant to beat us at full strength.
"If Jared Dudley can still play in the NBA, Kevin Durant will be just fine."
"Kevin ""LeBron James"" Durant  Klay ""Jr Smith"" Thompson  Stephen ""Kyle Korver"" Curry"
"Here's Steph and Klay  Year|Points  :--|:-- 2015|985 2016|1034 2017 | 732  2018 | 795 2019 | 1055  A lot of injuries, sharing the ball, and Kevin Durant. Oddly enough, the year they scored the least points, neither missed a postseason game it doesn't look like. 2016 they were close but Curry missed like 6 games."
"Warriors have already said that they will:  https://twitter.com/TheHoopCentral/status/1139558779077316609  &gt;The Warriors plan on offering both Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson 5 year max contracts this off-season, per @WindhorstESPN.  https://twitter.com/Con_Chron/status/1139597647856037888  &gt;Just spoke with Klay Thompson's father, Mychal, who said there's ""no question"" Klay will re-sign with the Warriors. Golden State is expected to still offer him a full five-year maximum deal."
Dude it's the Knicks. Achilles gone or not if you have a chance to get Kevin Durant you get Kevin Durant. No one can fault them for taking that risk lol.
"That doesn't compare to Klay, Draymond, Iggy, and Kevin fucking Durant.   LeBron teammates were voted to all-NBA teams 4x, including zero 1st team appearances and 1x 2nd team (2011 Wade).  Curry teammates were voted to all-NBA teams 7x, including 1x all-NBA first team (2018 KD) and 3x 3nd team.  You can additionally argue that KD has gotten multiple 1st team snubs, and Klay has been getting snubbed from all-NBA teams for the past 3 years (since KD came).  It's not even close, and that should come as no surprise. LeBron has 3 rings with 3 Finals MVP, meanwhile Curry has a 5 year finals streak, including 3 rings, but zero finals MVP. There shouldn't even be a question of who has had more help lmao"
Ok but where does Kevin Durant and Dion Waiters rank on that list
Yeah a 73-9 team that added Kevin Durant. 2017 was the most talented team of all time. They would beat anyone in history.
"Low key Curry is a stereotypical guy that would be labeled as not having the ""it factor"" but injuries to the Cavs in 2015 and getting Kevin Durant have saved him from that label."
"You are vastly underrating Kevin Durant's athleticism prior to injury, or understating why it made him so effective.  Look at Boogie, I know he was never a great athlete, but Jesus I saw shades of Al Jefferson. I forgot that Boogie is only late 20s.  Kevin Durant was so effective because he was a 7 footer with handle that could get to his spot, and easily rise over basically any defender. He will still be a very effective player. His post game is going to have to improve to combat his decreased mobility."
"WAIT....BREAKING NEWS EVERYONE...It's being reported that Kevin Durant should take the player option because reddit user 0strider0 ""wouldn't offer him a max deal this off season with that injury.""  Very interesting development...Regardless of 0strider0's own personal opinion, it appears that several other NBA teams, including the Warriors and Knicks, are still planning on offering Kevin Durant a max deal this offseason. Those teams still see Durant as a smart longterm investment regardless of the injury.   I doubt this latest report will change much for Durant and his agent Rich Kleiman, but we will have to see what they do over the next few weeks.  With 0strider0's opinion now out there, Durant may just think twice about opting out."
You sign Kevin Durant 10/10 times.
Did this dude really just call Steph Curry and Kevin “you know who I am” Durant trash?
"harden was playing very good defense on kevin durant, literally in the fourth quarter the warriors were trying to get harden switched off of KD. this is a tired narrative, not to mention kawhi didn’t exactly play extremely elite defense against the warriors this series either."
It be like that when you spent a huge part of your cap on Kevin Durant
Kawhi played against Kevin Durant for 11 minutes
Klay tho. I feel like we already saw this team and they’re capable of winning again in the west. I think Kevin Durant isn’t interested in staying
Kawhi Leonard Lebron James Kevin Durant Giannis antetokoumpo Steph Curry
"I'm not talking about the finals. The only player not named Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, or Klay Thompson who can shoot the ball well is Quinn Cook, who shot 40% from 3 on the season, but you can't seriously think a team with Steph and Quinn Cook as your only shooters is going to be very successful."
"I might be going on a limb here saying this but this Warriors team is the most stacked team in recent history. They are without a doubt the most favoured team to win a championship in any year of the NBA. This also may come off as sour but as an NBA fan, this team has not been healthy for the league to watch.   Individually, I love every player. But together, they made the league easily predictable. That's why I tip my hat to the Raptors who played an amazing despite the tribulations.  The Raptors had to face 3 different Golden State teams this Finals:  2017-2019 Warriors with Kevin Durant  2016 Warriors with Steph, Klay, Iggy, Draymond  And then a Steph led Warriors with Cousins &amp; Co.  That is no easy feat. To adjust to the team lineups, adjust the gameplan, the objectives.. All of that goes unnoticed. It's easy to say it was a sizzled out Finals due to the injury, which is true, but the road to get there hasn't been easy."
... Kevin Durant is ineligible for a super max contract.
"&gt; Warriors lost to Cavaliers, then came back to win the following year.  Because you added Kevin fucking Durant, who is going to be out next season. You're also going to be missing Klay for the good part of the season.  It's safe to say that it's the end of a dynasty for next season, at least."
"&gt; Russell Westbrook drew a foul on Chris Paul while shooting a three in the final seconds of Tuesday's Game 5 matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Clippers. &gt;  &gt; The Thunder trailed, 104-102, with six seconds left, and Westbrook needed to make all three free throws to give Oklahoma City the lead. Kevin Durant couldn't watch. &gt;  &gt; Westbrook hit all of them. &gt;  &gt; This was 2014 playoffs"

"I know it was a small sample size but like it didn't even feel real the way he was playing. He was just right back to being Kevin Durant, a top-3 NBA player, and the same monster we'd seen in the early playoffs."
And Kevin Durant
&gt; No wtf are you saying dude literally no other fanbase would've cheered for KD getting injured because he's a beloved player everywhere else  Huh? I'm surprised to read this. Everyone I know outside of people who live in San Fran fucking _hates_ Kevin Durant.
"Jesus Christ man I’m just stating a fact. You’re not beating a team with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond playing. It’s just not happening. I don’t care how you try and justify that. It’s just not happening"
Kevin Durant. It’s not even close.
"The body isn't even cold and people are already in here doing damage control on the Warriors legacy. Nevermind all the bitching golden state did about officiating over the postseasons and how abrasive draymond green and kevin durant are regarding officials and fans, the true evil in the NBA is James Harden and old ass Chris Paul."
It's not even about the sample size and more about the fact that hes Kevin Durant
Its chris paul ... you cant possibly think he’s comparable to losing kevin durant or Klay Thompson two of the most lethal shooters in all of history come on
"Kevin Durant is out for the entire season, you fucking moron lmao."
"Lets be real tho. Steph hasnt really lived up to his status in the finals. He played very well in 2017 and 2018, but how hard is it to play well when you never even sniff double coverage because you have klay thompson playing at an allstar level AND kevin fucking durant playing at a finals mvp level?   2016, his unanimous mvp year, he did not play well at all during the finals, and 2015 he played better than most give him credit for, but still not STEPH level and iguodala was the real difference maker in the series.   Now in 2019, the only GREAT game steph had was the 47 points game which ended up in a loss anyway. Every other game steph played mediocre, or klay thompson was THE man. Klay wouldve won mvp had gsw beaten the raps.  Id still have to bet on lebron since the only time weve seen gsw warriors beat lebron is when the deck is completely stacked in their favor"
Hardens never been carried by Kevin Durant tho.
"They have film sessions where they watch the Warriors offense and defense to determine how each player plays. As we’ve heard it sounds like Loyd often plays as Curry in these types of situations, I’d bet money that Boucher likely was acting as Kevin Durant on offense if the Warriors prepped to go against him."
"I mean the rest of the comment was bad also. The owner's profit to date is not relevant to making future spending decisions.  It's a terrible idea to say ""well, we've already made a ton of money, so who cares if we lose money signing huge risk contracts this offseason"" The owner could also elect to just keep that ""8x"" profit, and move forward with Steph, re-sign Green and retool. The stadium is still being built whether KD and/or Klay are on the team or not. And none of that money he's made to date evaporates if he doesn't resign these guys.  If they signed KD and Klay to max deals, their 2020 tax bill will be [$175M](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/02/20/golden-state-warriors-salary-klay-thompson-kevin-durant). I have a hard time believing any owner would pay a $175M tax bill, on top of $168M in salaries, for a team that will have a drop in attendance, ticket prices, and could very easily miss the playoffs with 40% of its payroll already set to miss the whole season. And that's before we even consider the fact that there's a non-zero chance one of those guys never plays at an all-NBA caliber again. I'm less worried about Klay because ACLs are fairly straightforward recovery, but an achilles tear for a 31 year old is an enormous risk"
Kevin Durant
"Finally!  Obviously a wonderful season for the boys this year. 17 game improvements from the season before do not come by chance though. Last season, as NBA champion Champagne Papi would say, was a SURGICAL SUMMER. Adding Steve Clifford to this team did wonders for us. Absolutely phase shifted the way we handle ourselves on defense, sporting the title of best defense in the NBA for a good minute there.  **Did the team perform to expectations?**  No. They fucking blew them out of the water lol. I thought we were gonna get a cool 30 games, develop our talent, and make some extreme offseason moves going to continue the rebuild process. These boys had other plans.   **Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?**  The coaching change from Vogel to Clifford obviously did wonders (COTY? Not a ridiculous prospect at all, though he won't get it), but there were a bunch of other factors.  Our defensive prowess led us to success in the east. Guys like Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Nikola Vucevic (who's been denounced for his defense), Wes Iwundu, Isaiah Briscoe/MCW, and Bamba led to a top 5 year in defense for the magic, allowing 106.6 points per game. The wingspan epidemic has stricken the magic, and it's manifesting itself on the defensive end of the floor.   In particular, though we didn't have the best offensive year, there is a noticeable difference between the intent with which the ball moves this year vs. last.  **What were the highlights of the season?**  Obviously, DJ Augustin's shot. I couldn't count how many times I've watched that. Though we ended up getting muscled out of the playoffs, that win really gave us a taste of playoff success for the first time in 9 years.   Other than that, the entire last month of the regular season were essentially all playoff games for the magic, vying for those last couple of spots in the east. Beating the heat down in Miami was a wonderful moment.   Nikola Vucevic making his first allstar game was nice; watching him face a fellow Nikola in Jokic was fun to watch.   **What were the lowlights of the season?**  We had a little stretch in the middle of the season where things were not looking good at ALL. We were losing winnable games, looked disheveled the entire time, and overall seemed to be reverting to the magic ways of starting hot and falling off in the middle of the season.   Basically any game where Jerian Grant played more than 5 minutes was a lowlight.   Losing to the Knicks in that run we had at the end of the season... we had just beaten the warriors; I didn't even consider losing to New York as a possibility, but lo and behold. It was just deflating because we were so close to getting bounced out that it seemed like we were going to miss out on the playoffs because of a silly loss like that.   **Which players impressed you?**  A lot.   1. *Nikola Vucevic* stepped up this season, notching his first all-star season in his 8 years on the Magic. Averaging 20.8/12.0/3.8 and a block, he went nuclear in his contract year, making it hard for us to decide the move for him in free agency.   2. *JONATHAN ISAAC.* What a wonderful season and a bright future he has. You know that if you're being shouted out by Kevin Durant in a positive light, you're doing something right. In this case, JI improved in every category possible in what was essentially his rookie year after losing most of last season to a nagging ankle injury.  His offensive game is still a work in progress, but he's clearly making improvements. He had a big shot in that game 1 against the raptors that really showcased all the work he's put into his game.   Defensively, he's shown me DPOY level potential and talent. He's long enough to make people think twice before trying to drive on him. He's quick enough to switch onto 2s and even 1s. If he can put on a little more weight, he can undoubtedly guard 1-5 by next season.   3. *Terrence Ross*, QUIETLY, had a 6MOY level year. I'm allowed to say quietly here, I don't give a shit. With 15.1 points per game off the bench, The Human Torch was an absolute jolt to life at times for the sometimes stagnant Orlando Magic offense. Curling off screens to hit 3s, acrobatic finishes, and the literal [dunk of the year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJM8mYeMBGs); TRoss was nothing but buckets all year.   4. *DJ Augustin!* People amongst the Magic fanbase were (justifiably) clamoring for a new PG all offseason, and when no major moves were made, a lot of questions about how this season would go were thrown around. I'm telling you, there was lottery talk BEFORE THE SEASON STARTED.   DJ was having none of that.   Having his most efficient season ever (56.6% eFG), DJ Augustin proved to be the crafty scorer he's always been. He also took care of the ball very well, averaging only 1.6 turnovers per game to his 5.3 assists per game. He had a few interviews explaining how he maintains his quickness so late (as a guard) into his career, citing that his body is the most important part of his offseason; keeping it in tune and ready for another season.   *Khem Birch* didn't have a very big role on the team, but he was wonderful when he got a chance. When big Mo Bamba went down for the year, Khem became our designated backup center, and boy did he hold down the fort. At 6'9"", Khem Birch [emerged as one of the NBA's best rim protectors](https://www.nba.com/magic/news/birch-has-evolved-one-nbas-best-interior-defenders-20190401). That's no coincidence either; Khem is also among the strongest people in the NBA, and his overseas play has fine-tuned his defensive instincts and fundamental skills like weak-side help defense and post defense.   *Aaron Gordon* showed great improvement after signing his big deal with the Magic as well. Though his numbers saw a slight decline, in part due to how well his teammates did, the one number he did see go up was his assists per game. from 2.3 to 3.7. Aaron Gordon is ready to be considered as a point forward. He's shown that he can handle the ball and make the right decision, and has put the work in his game to make that a weapon for the team.  Otherwise, his lockdown caliber defense was a sight to see, and in our 4-1 decimation by the raptors, his defense was still on the main stage. Much to the dismay of most Magic supporters, he didn't receive a SINGLE vote for all-defense, but that's clearly a result of reviewers not watching our games. No surprise there. Nonetheless, the record shows where the improvements were made.   *Michael Carter-Williams.* Not a typo, and I don't speak with twisted tongue when I say that we probably would not have made the playoffs if not for signing him late into the season. In part because his replacement would have been Jerian Grant, but also in part due to how well he played and the energy and defensive havoc he wreaked off the bench. Another one of the long guys, MCW was able to stick the 1 on the other team as well as distribute well and occasionally hit a 3 to keep the Magic offense moving.   **Which players disappointed you?**  Not that he had any expectations in the first place, but Jerian Grant was an absolute travesty to watch 100% of the time. I'm sure he's a great guy really. He was always happy and cheering on the bench. But good lord. Genuinely terrible.   Unfortunately, Evan Fournier didn't have the season he wanted this year. He hit a couple buzzer beaters, and at time served as our only point of offense, but he knows and everyone knows he can do so much better. He's really a great player. He just saw drops in his efficiency and scoring, really. I'm not worried that next season will be much better for him.  **What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?**  Man. This situation is really complicated; we have two big decisions in free agency to make with Terrence Ross and Nikola Vucevic hitting the open market this offseason. There are arguments for keeping both, arguments for keeping just Ross, arguments for canning both and developing new talent. The reality is that I have no idea what will and won't work. I just don't know. I'm glad I'm not the one that has to make the decision, but I do know that I trust the people that do. We got Markelle Fultz from Philly for almost nothing. I trust the FO to make the right decision, and I'll rock with them no matter what the decision is.  **Who is set to break out next season?**  The two obvious ones are JI and Mo Bamba. JI has already kind of broken out, but he has so much more room to improve as well. Ironing out his offensive game even more will do so many wonders for him. I truly believe he has all-star POTENTIAL, whether or not he lives up to him is up to JI himself, his trainers, staff, and fortune.   Bamba is someone who we haven't seen enough of to be certain about how he'll develop, but we can be certain at least that he'll be something of a force on defense. Hopefully he bulks up and comes back stronger next season.  Who is set to regress next season?  I don't know. No one hopefully.   **What are the main concerns for next season?**  Really, the question is whether or not we can build off of this success for next season. The two guys currently not signed to a contract with the Magic were a huge reason we were able to get as far as we did. It's hard to say whether or not we're going to bring them back for another go at it, or go to developing the next up. I'm not sure how we'd fare without Ross or Vuc, though. We'll see what happens.  **What expectations are there for next season?**  There really are none until the rosters settle.. I'll hit you back right before the season starts. Till then... GO MAGIC."
"Right on. Had the Warriors not signed Kevin Durant, I imagine different forms of help would have been added to keep the team competitive. But if you go the All-Star heavy route, and one or more of those All-Stars go down, the trade-off is often a severe lack of depth.   This Warriors team isn't constructed to operate with Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, and Quinn Cook as the primary options along the perimeter and elsewhere when Stephen Curry is doubled the moment he crosses half-court or resting on the bench. But again, that's what happens when two of your options return from injury only to suffer a catastrophic injury and another never fully recovers from his own catastrophic injury (Cousins).   Also, the Raptors played really doggone well. Circumstances are circumstances, but the Raptors went out and won this championship."
"Stephen Curry is great player, but he can be slow down with length, athleticism, and good team defense. The Raptors defense goals don't let Curry shoot, hound him off ball, if curry comes offscreen switch, and they were willing to let other players shoot the ball. Stephen Curry not tall, long length, or crazy athleticism. Curry maximize the level of athleticism he has combined, shooting, ballhandling, screening, and body movements which makes him a great player just not on the level of individual talent of Kevin Durant, Lebron James, or Kawhi Leonard."
Kevin Durant.
I'll delete my account if Kevin Durant plays for the Warriors next season.
Are you really comparing these guys being banged up to Kevin Durant rupturing his achilles and Klay Thompson tearing his ACL?   Lmao.
"Dwayne Wade stopping Kevin Durant is laughable.. that's not even a match up, what the fuck does that mean.. no one would have Wade guard Durant"
This is just trolling. They were missing Kevin Durant. Jerebko and bogut barely played.
Warriors in 9. Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant listed as day to day. Will be game time decision.
"so he can just sign the supermax this season and not bother with a 5 mil season. that makes no sense for him to sign regardless. in no fucking universe does it make sense for him to sign a fucking one year deal for 5 million. i do not undrestand why so many of you think this is a good idea for him. also this is almost certainly not kosher and isn't that far off from the joe smith debacle. kevin durant will not be signing a fucking 1 year deal for 5 mil, regardless of how many of you think this is a good idea."
"True, but of these people is Kevin fucking Durant though."
&gt; Likely scenario includes KD opting in to his 31.5M player option to remain with the Warriors next year.   Why would he opt in when the [Knicks and Nets still have interest to offer him a max](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/254194/Knicks-Nets-Still-Interesting-In-Signing-Kevin-Durant-Kyrie-Irving-Together)?  31.5 million vs a max contract coming off an achilles tear.  Obviously you haven’t thought this through.
"&gt; he’s signed until 2021  Front office contracts are not like player contracts. This was from [an article in April](https://theathletic.com/917565/2019/04/10/thompson-if-the-lakers-go-after-bob-myers-itll-be-up-to-the-warriors-to-prove-they-know-how-much-hes-worth/) discussing how the Lakers might be able to pursue Bob Myers, even though he too is under contract:  &gt; Myers is under contract with the Warriors as team president and general manager. Myers has at least a couple years left on his deal, but even that is unknown because the Warriors are tight-lipped about it. So the Lakers would need official permission from the Warriors to even talk to him. &gt;  &gt; But things could get interesting if the Lakers do seek that permission. &gt;  &gt; **Things work differently in front-office discussions. The Warriors wouldn’t be able to just straight up deny Myers the opportunity to talk to the Lakers. It wouldn’t be good practice and it could hamper their front-office chemistry.** Warriors owner Joe Lacob has never been one to stifle the opportunities of his people. &gt;  &gt; So if the Lakers talk to Myers and he becomes interested, the ball would be in the Warriors’ court for what happens next. And their response could change the dynamic of the Warriors front office — which means Magic suddenly throwing up the deuces to the Lakers could have a ripple effect in the Bay. &gt;  &gt; Do they just pay Myers more money to make the Lakers option go away? And what would the message be to Myers if they don’t do that? Money isn’t an issue. The Warriors are willing to pay major luxury-tax penalties to keep the core of their roster together because money isn’t an issue. Plus, front-office salaries don’t count against the salary cap. So nothing is stopping them from paying Myers more money other than their own value system. They could give Myers a raise out of the spare change from the billions they are already are set to make on the new arena. &gt;  &gt; And they should. On top of his basketball operations work, Myers does the kind of work many head honchos won’t do and he does it well. He develops bonds with stars and becomes their front-office confidant. That currency ends up mattering in times of distress. Better believe, if Kevin Durant stays with the Warriors, Myers will be a major part of that. He certainly has put in the work to that end. &gt;  &gt; **The Warriors merely giving the Lakers permission to talk to Myers, instead of sweetening his deal to make sure he doesn’t leave, could be insight into how much the franchise values Myers.** Certainly, he could take their response as such insight. Remember, the Warriors did let Jerry West walk when he wanted more money. &gt;  &gt; If this somehow ends with Myers feeling underappreciated, who fixes that? He is the one who spends his days smoothing out rough edges in the franchise. It will be a unique position for the Warriors if, out of all this, he becomes the rough edge.  Now none of this applies to the Lakers and Warriors anymore because the Lakers are idiots and didn't even bother pursuing Myers, but this would all apply to Masai Ujiri and the Wizards."
"I truly believe that if Klay went down instead of KD in game 5, people wouldn't have cheered.  I think a big part of people cheering for KD going down is the, ""Fuck Kevin Durant"" state of mind. People hate the guy from a basketball perspective, so seeing him go down is cause for celebration.   I doubt  any of those people who cheered would truly wish for another person to be seriously hurt, but people are passionate and emotional; we can get caught up in sports and dissociate the human being from the professional athlete.  Yeah it looked bad, but I think people need to be reminded of how easy it is to get caught up in the moment and forget that we're all human beings."
"I’m so happy for the raptors team, they definitely deserved the championship. I will not, however, ever forgive the fans who cheered when Kevin Durant got injured in game 5. That sadly painted raptors fans in a very bad light for me."
tl;dw  1. &gt;!Stephen Curry!&lt; 2. &gt;!Giannis Antetokounmpo!&lt; 3. &gt;!Kevin Durant!&lt; 4. &gt;!Anthony Davis!&lt; 5. &gt;!Kawhi Leonard!&lt; 6. &gt;!LeBron James!&lt; 7. &gt;!James Harden!&lt; 8. &gt;!Joel Embiid!&lt; 9. &gt;!Paul George!&lt; 10. &gt;!Nikola Jokic!&lt;
"Lol, teams will offer him a full max, including the Warriors. We have already have executives saying they would offer him that much right now.            He is Kevin Durant, not your average player."
LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Stephen Curry  Giannis Antetokounmpo  James Harden  Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic  Joel Embiid  Paul George  Damian Lillard  Rudy Gobert  Blake Griffin  Russell Westbrook  Karl-Anthony Towns
Yikes.  I’m just going to list everything wrong with this list. Harden over Kawhi? Harden/Giannis over Durant? Jolie/Giannis over Steph?   LeBron James James Harden Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetokounmpo Kevin Durant Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Anthony Davis Paul George Joel Embiid Rudy Gobert Damian Lillard Karl Anthony-Towns Blake Griffin Draymond Green
I think the cheers were mostly because it was Kevin Durant. Lots of raptors fans don't respect him
"&gt;Heat 2012: Have dominating playoff run, defeat team that would be a champion most years with an all time great offense. Kevin Durant's first finals with current team. Win 4-1.  Heat legend Kevin Durant"
"&gt;Heat 2012: Have dominating playoff run, defeat team that would be a champion most years with an all time great offense. Kevin Durant's first finals with current team. Win 4-1.  Heat legend Kevin Durant"
Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant died for this
"I mean I couldn’t predict an injury to Kevin Durant and to a lesser extent Klay, could I? But we’re champions I’ll take shit for being wrong. I’m glad I am."
Boobie Miles = Kevin Durant in this scenario
"lol you are way, way off. It’s already been reported that he still has suitors lines up to give him a max deal despite his injury. He’s Kevin fucking Durant. They’ll tell him to rest up and then hope he finishes his career with them. Kevin will be offered a max by multiple teams."
"I mean he tried to recruit the best available free agent at the time, it just turned out to be KD. Who in their right mind would not try to recruit Kevin fucking Durant if they had a chance of getting him."
"I'm not even sure what you're arguing. So, you're saying, after watching Kevin Durant (the second best player in the league - one of the greatest shooters of all time) make one of the bitchiest moves to the best regular season team of all time, then after watching that team make the finals the most sorry-ass lopsided event in sports for two years, after having to deal with Draymond Green getting special treatment from the refs and acting like an ass without reprimand (personally, I think he's an entitled fuck too), after watching LeBron put up 50-point triple doubles in the finals only to be beaten because his team, go figure, can't defend the best regular season team in history plus Kevin Durant, and then Demarcus Cousins, the best center in the league other than Anthony Davis decides to take a pay cut, making it a starting crew of 4 All Stars and (in your opinion) ""a star at best."" You're saying that move shouldn't piss me off? Believe what you want my man, but that move instantly pissed off everyone except your circle of fandom. Hindsight is 20/20, and you can try to rationalize all you want, but we all know, on paper, an injured Demarcus Cousins is an upgrade from Zaza Pechulia or Javale McGhee. And I absolutely would've been pissed if he was able to piggyback his entitled ass to a championship. Rightfully so."
Coming up in the 2019-20 season:   [2016 Warriors - Crippled edition]   Starring:   - Steph Curry as David going up against the World     - Draymond Green as Donkey   - Shaun Livingston as man considering retirement   - Andre Iguodala also as man considering retirement   - Kevon Looney as bandage man   - DeMarcus Cousins as an emotional lesbian   - Quinn Cook as Jester   - Alfonzo McKinnie as human sieve     - Jordan Bell as cash considerations     - Andrew Bogut as man who likes kayaking    - Kevin Durant as spectator    - Klay Thompson as Rocco's biggest fan   - Jacob Evans as Jacob Evans
"Other sports like soccer take injuries very seriously and you almost never see injured players continue. One example was Cristiano Ronaldo in the last Euro cups. You know what happened to him? His tendonitis got worse and he has never been as explosive since. Sure he can bang them in but his pace and quickness took a massive it. It was a big deal but  you really don't see injured players being fast tracked into playing. You don't see it in football.   &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant is a superstar yes but the issue here is how the fan base will view players not rushing back to play from their injury. Kawhi got mixed reactions for his load-management, going forward players will be given the benefit of the doubt. Sure you will always view a player doing what KD did as valiant but there also going to be a level of stupidity. I fear KD will develop severe tendonitis, he will need anti inflammatories just to play, and he will have to slow his game down."
"With the injuries to Looney and Klay? Durant would be lucky to get 2 games.   The Raptors are a good team....there is no way Kevin Durant is beating the Raptors with Curry playing only 12 minutes in the series, Klay missing a game and 2 quarters essentially and Looney playing with a fractured collarbone.   That's just too many health issues to contend with."
Look...I like Steph but the only chip he's won without Durant has been the one where Kyrie and Kevin Love were injured. Durant&gt;Curry
"Honestly, I would rather not have that. I dont want to have to root for Kevin Durant again."
"when you keep on winning people want to see you lose.  They are seen as a super team because some players took pay cuts just so the team can pay everyone. From superstar players to role players, they could've gotten payed a lot more than they are if they signed with other teams. Another reason is that their best player Kevin Durant is arguably a top 10 player in NBA history and signed with the warriors after losing to them while he was with the okc thunder up 3-1 eventually losing 4-3."
"Kevin Durant being injured in the peak of his prime is devestating. Him being out this year cost the Warriors a championship, and his injury will most likely affect the championship odds of whatever team he chooses to go to next. Im not sure about other sports, but it would be like if peak Tom Brady got injured in the superbowl, then missed all of the next season. Worst part is no one really knows how much this injury will affect his future game when he comes back, almost surely on the downhill of his prime."
Dame dolla and Jonas Valanciunas... OH that’s KEVIN DURANT
Dame dolla and Jonas Valanciunas... OH that’s KEVIN DURANT
Not true at all. You think Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are on PEDs?
Did we finally perfect the technology to erase Kevin Durant from the timeline?
The way and tone this dude is responding to all these comments make me feel like he is either Kyrie or Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Jeremy Lin
"Kevin Durant.  He's injured and going to miss the year. Should be grateful to get paid any money at all. The only question is whether the room exception is too much money and the vet minimum should be used instead.  On a different note,  boogie cousins on the Lakers makes sense given the AD connection, ring hunt, and chance to prove himself for a bigger payday next year.  But I'm surprised by how much the market for him collapsed. You'd think he would be on ainge's call list. Even if enes was plan A"
Curry/Draymond DUO have never won a ring. You forgot Klay Thompson? Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant. 2 of him would be unstoppable.
"Not only that, they couldn't believe that they squandered that incredible windfall of draft picks they got from the Nets because a huge part of the success of that trade was getting Kyrie Irving and keeping him.  Not only did they lose Irving, but they lost him to *the Nets*.  Oh and they also got Kevin Durant.   Celtics signed Kemba Walker though"
"with a broken kevin durant and woke kyrie, i give it s 50/50"
Karl Malone is arguably the best PF of all time and he’s not even included on the 1st or 2nd team. I would have him 1st team but I wouldn’t be upset if someone placed Duncan 1st and him 2nd. But he’s no lower than 2nd.  Larry Bird shouldn’t be 2nd team of SFs. No disrespect it’s just that Kevin Durant is a newer version of him and should be 2nd team.   Dirk shouldn’t be included in any of these 3 teams. Charles Barkley easily over Dirk. and id put KG over Dirk. People forget KG not only put up better overall offensive numbers he also won DPOY. Dirk was a great scorer and shooter but a liability on defense and wasn’t a good rebounder for his size (7 feet)  Curry that high. I wouldn’t do right now but it’s not crazy.
"OP probably bought that gamer girl's bathwater, slapped a label saying ""Scarjo's bath water"" then duped Kevin Durant into spending $100,000 on it."
If theee years ago someone said that Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant would both sign with the Brooklyn Nets in 2019 offseason people would call you crazy
"Lol. We have no bad contracts, we are fully cap flexible. Plenty of young talent.  Nets just blew up a promising roster to sign Kyrie ""the earf is flat and I'm a genius"" Irving and Kevin ""won't ever perform at max contract level again"" Durant.   4 years. Ones already wasted.   Good. Fucking. Luck."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant ... one would hope lol
New York might not be fun until Kevin Durant is 33 years old
I mentioned injuries since Jordan doesnt even make it to the finals if he played with that Cavs team in 2018 and Love goes down for the last 2. Regardless if you actually think he beats a team that won 73 games before they added Kevin Durant on top 3 times with THAT cavs team... an MRI is more useful than this conversation for you.
Kevin Durant retires from the NBA
Bull shit KD has a much more consistent jumper then Durant.   Kevin is better then both of them combined
"""It's interesting, not only because of the new LA-based NBA team, but also because they have Kevin Durant to back you up. He'll go against the best basketball team in the history of the league, the Lakers, in an old school stomp.""       the perfect bandwagon comment"
"I get the point, but the 2 aren't mutually exclusive. See: Durant, Kevin."
Kevin Durant: hold my beer
That might literally kill Kevin Durant.
That’s tough. I think it’s still Kevin but Russ was there during the Durant era and the post Durant era
"But two inches seems a lot. Players lie about their height all the time (see Kevin Durant claiming to be shorter than he is). Or maybe I just buy thin ass shoes because without shoes I am 6'1"" flat and with shoes I am just shy of 6'2""."
Then why was Al horford committed to the Thunder if Kevin Durant stayed in 2016?
"when he was drafted he was 7 flat and is listed as such. A year later or so before he played he grew to 7'2. He's announced as 7'2 now at home games as well and is taller than players like Kevin Durant, who is 7 feet."
"The only reason they've lost in the past is the existence of the Warriors + Kevin Durant, which is not a team anyone should fairly have been expected to beat, imo. It ruined parity in the NBA, and now it's gone. Rockets could have won it all in any of those years."
"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/history-not-kind-for-ruptured-achilles-recovery/  https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/  Do more research.   Its not pretty. There are no positive examples outside of Dominique wilkins.   &gt;In explaining why Durant won’t be the same sniper in 2020-21, Kadakia said it’s jumping and speed. The surgically repaired leg regains just 95 percent of the power of the healthy leg.  &gt;“When you shoot, you jump,” he said. “You’re jump is off because you don’t have as much power in one leg than the other. You play your whole career based on how much height and quick reaction you get when you want to shoot. Some can’t do that anymore, no longer able to push off like you were before.  &gt;“And speed is heavily affected, making the quick cut. You lose a little of that power, when you want to push off as hard as you want. An elite athlete losing 5 percent power makes big difference.’’   So the consensus best case medically would be KD can play 2 seasons once he returns at below his best, and then its up to his age and ability if he can reach his peak again.   Thats a 34-35 year old durant.   The peak is well and truly gone. And defensively he will more than likely be a negative"
Wish: DLO is traded  C U R S E:  for Kevin Durant
lil b with a kevin durant track
"Steph Curry has 21 points on 6/17 shooting in game 6 of the finals. How can he be considered better than Kawhi? Using your logic, shouldn’t this eliminate him automatically?  Kevin Durant?? The guy who played a total of 12 minutes? Had a better series than the finals mvp? Surely you’re joking  I don’t even want to know how you’ve deluded yourself into thinking Klay is better than Kawhi.   Sounds like you’re just another salty spurs fan mad that Kawhi left you in the dust 🤷‍♂️"
"How is the 4th quarter of a championship clinching game oddly specific? It's not just some random game.   And it's not just that game it was the whole series and not just the 4th quarter but every quarter. Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry played better than Kawhi at different points in this series so how can Kawhi be the argued as the best?"
a major thing is a lot less dunks for Dominique after the injury. I guess the same thing would apply to Kevin Durant.
I’m as sure as I can be golden state was bringing home chips with or without KD. You can feel differently but they’re incredibly dominant at their core. And I’m a Houston and Portland fan so I have no personal stake in this. And he didn’t have to hold anyone hostage the very next year after they blew their lead he switched teams. It’s not like he sat on a losing OkC for years or something. He immediately jumped ship to his competitor who given how westbrook and harden have turned out would likely have been able to beat. I don’t think KD went there because he didn’t think they could beat GSW. I think he went there because he didn’t think they could beat Lebron and GSW had already demonstrated that they could. The fact GSW came back from that deficit was just the final straw in my opinion. I have no respect for Kevin Durant as a competitor. He’s a great ball player but I just feel he lacks heart.
you know we just lost kevin durant he took a lot of shots
Kevin Durant punching the air while doing rehab right now.
"warning: wall of text.  posting it since ya said the Nets *gave away* DLo. they did it for DAJ.  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146560882178056192  &gt; The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561014424621064  &gt; The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561112772685825  &gt; The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561386228719618  &gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561874684760069  &gt; Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561986936889344  &gt; The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562326730092544  &gt; The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562923239759872  &gt; And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146563484961910784  &gt; For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!"
"Take away the rings, the articles, burner accounts, narratives etc. and he's still Kevin Durant. His legacy's cemented."
[Fitzgerald is a moron always has been.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/12/17454050/kevin-durant-warriors-parade-contract-bob-myers)
Stephen Curry(4) Klay Thompson(3) Paul George(2) Kevin Durant(4) Mike Scott(2)
"&gt; I watched him brick open shot after open shot the last 2 years  Hmmm, so now the goal posts are ""is he a good shooter""   He hasnt been peak melo, obviously. But 35% from 3 is good. Deal with it.   35% is kevin durant, chris paul territory."
“Stephen Curry can’t shoot”  “Kevin Durant isn’t tall”  “Chris Paul can’t pass”
"This is what happens when you cherry pick one stat to try to make a point. RHJ and Graham were good defenders but black holes on offense. Napier was the opposite, he was streaky offensively and a whole lot of nothing on defense. Also, literally all of these players have been replaced by someone better at the same position.  Ed Davis &gt; DeAndre Jordan Treveon Graham &gt; David Nwaba DeMarre Caroll &gt; Taurean Prince Shabazz Napier &gt; Theo Pinson Jared Dudley &gt; Kevin Durant Rondae Hollis-Jefferson &gt; Wilson Chandler Allen Crabbe &gt; Garret Temple D’Angelo Russell &gt; Kyrie Irving  Hmmm....looks like a better team to me."
Curry would start creeping into the conversation as the best player since MJ. He would also be referred to as the best player in the world instead of Kawhi.  Curry and Klay would gain respect as the modern day Jordan/Pippen combo.  Kevin Durant's rings would be completely devalued.   Kevin Durant would have blocked Brooklyn from including D'Lo in a sign and trade.
I think he made a dumb comment in 2011 about OKC saying something along the lines of “Kevin Durant is the only star on the Thunder” and it wasn’t received well. It might’ve been something else but that’s the first thing I remember.
FUCK KEVIN I WANT TO PLAY FOR EVERY TEAM DURANT! I’m a GSW fan and he’s a bitch that we’ll move on from and be better without!
Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of all time.   **BYE**
Yes  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-picked-nets-he-spoke-team-sean-marks-says
Kevin Durant has no idea what he wants or why he wants it.   I honestly feel bad for him. I think he’s a good guy and an insanely talented player who is trying so hard to fill some sort of hole and find happiness and he can’t find it.
I personally think of this one  https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8
"&gt;Kevin Durant only ever picks fights with point guards   He doesn't pick fights with anyone. But if some little dude is trying to fuck with someone like him, he has the right to show them how small they are, and just stare them down. I mean, it's an advantage for being that big.   &gt;  and for someone like Durant, he can also just switch himself on to that dude, use him like a chair and shoot over him.. get the bucket. That's also another effective way to kill someone's morale.   &gt;  But don't be a fool and say some ignorant shit like that. Durant destroyed a lot of twin towers, and stared them down as well. That OKC team was must watch TV, along with the Heatles. So damn good  &gt;  **[7'2 Roy Hibbert. RIP] (https://streamable.com/335k9)**  &gt;  **[7'1 Haywood.. RIP] (https://streamable.com/ssz2r)**"
So this is obviously before KD went down but -   1. Kevin Durant 2. LeBron James 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Stephen Curry 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokuonmpo 7. Anthony Davis 8. Damian Lillard 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Joel Embiid 11. Paul George 12. Blake Griffin 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Jimmy Butler 15. Jrue Holiday 16. Kyrie Irving 17. LaMarcus Aldridge 18. Bradley Beal 19. Kemba Walker 20. Karl-Anthony Towns 21. Draymond Green 22. Rudy Gobert 23. Klay Thompson 24. Mike Conley 25. Pascal Siakam 26. Luka Doncic 27. Kyle Lowry 28. Donovan Mitchell 29. Chris Paul 30. Al Horford 31. D'Angelo Russell 32. Myles Turner 33. Jusuf Nurkic 34. Marc Gasol 35. Tobias Harris 36. Devin Booker 37. CJ McCollum 38. De'Aaron Fox 39. Ben Simmons 40. Zach LaVine 41. Khris Middleton 42. Nikola Vucevic 43. Lou Williams 44. DeMar DeRozan 45. Julius Randle 46. Andre Drummond 47. Lauri Markkanen 48. Steven Adams 49. Brook Lopez 50. Josh Richardson
"Kevin Durant only ever picks fights with point guards, how funny is that?"
"Obviously i know rookies of great players are gonna sell fine, im talking about the others like, a plain lebron card or kevin durant. Those carda have essentially lost all value of what little value they already had"
Yep and the knicks “coincidentally” put Kevin Durant on the season ticket front part.
"I want to like the Nuggets so much I just think Jamal Murray is such a little bitch. I love Garry Harris, I love Jokic, just can't get past Murray. I've always wondered if they assembled an all-bitch squad how that would fare:  PG: DeAngelo Russell, Derek Fisher SG: OJ Mayo SF: Kevin Durant PF: Blake Griffin C: Dwight Howard  Plz help me outfit the rest of this squad"
"There's a drop-off after West, but Oscar is still in that 13-16 range all time.  KD is arguably there already too - After the ""Top 12"", the potential picks you can choose from 13-25 are players like Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, David Robinson, Stephen Curry, Isiah Thomas, Moses Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, John Stockton, Elgin Baylor, Dwayne Wade, Scottie Pippen.  I think KD is likely already in the 14-18 range in that list all-time - but to crack above Jerry West is possible, but to be above players like Hakeem / Shaq / Kobe / Duncan / Bird (The next players who are in the 7-11 range) there is CONSIDERABLE difference."
"Steph is the target because the alternatives are Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant/Harrison Barnes."
"This is a bad question because players aren’t really their listed heights. But off of a rough estimation of guys who are about the same height I’d go with  - Ben Simmons - Kevin Durant - Danilo Gallinari - Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Mirotic - Al Horford, Anthony Davis  I think in the end the size would just be too much for another team to over come."
Kevin Durant is getting too old for this shit
"KD literally mentioned Kobe, Dirk, and Duncan the summer before he left OKC. Words are just words, ppl change their mind all the time.   [Durant: Wants jersey retired in OKC](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career)  He's 24 years old I doubt he's 100% sure he wants to stay with the Bucks his whole career. Sure, today he says this but it could all change on July 1st 2026. It's why nobody should but any stock into this article."
Solved Kevin Durant is better than Steph Curry.  Thanks 2k
"All I'm saying is that players have literally said this exact same thing and left.  KD LITERALLY mentioned ""Kobe, Tim Duncan, Dirk"" in a quote to ESPN in 2015 in an article titled [Durant: Want jersey retired in OKC](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career) and then left the summer."
"Kevin Durant was saying the same things for 8 years and even assured his teammates he was staying in OKC the night before he left.  Paul George signed a 3 year deal in OKC just a year ago saying ""I'm here to stay"" only to request a trade the next summer.  Kyrie was till Boston he was planning on resigning last October.   Things change fast in the NBA. Players say shit like this and can still change their mind."
[When](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2416840-kevin-durant-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-thunder-for-entire-career) has anyone ever said something like [that?](https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2017/09/lebron_james_cavaliers_6.html)
"[“I love it here man. I love my teammates, I love the city, I don’t really think about anywhere else,” Durant said in an interview with Revolt TV this week (via Michael Scotto of The Associated Press). “I hear it all the time, don’t get me wrong, and once you hear it you’re kind of like...But for me, I love staying in the moment, and I’m one of those guys that would love to stick it out with one team my whole career.”](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2416840-kevin-durant-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-thunder-for-entire-career)"
“Kevin Durant- I don’t really like him that much”   Your wife would fit in with 95% of r/nba
"This probably didn't help [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/12/17454050/kevin-durant-warriors-parade-contract-bob-myers](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/12/17454050/kevin-durant-warriors-parade-contract-bob-myers)  ""The first fissure"" indeed, Bob lmao."
"&gt;He never jokes, never smiles, and seems always angry at someone or something.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpKHnam44Ek  Skip has a lot of fun on set.   Stephen A Smith got VERY personal with MCW and Kevin Durant....in a way that you never see Bayless do because he doesn't have any relationships with players nor does he respond to them in matters that go beyond the sport. Stephen A regularly brings up racial issues and uses the NBA as a platform to express his own political beliefs whereas you never see Skip do such a thing.   I agree that SAS is more of a cartoon character. But he does take things much more personally than Skip does."
"This skips over so many events that happened and reads as someone who wasn’t really paying attention to basketball at those times.  Steph Curry at the time was going from potential all star to a sad story of an injury plagued career. Coming off ankle surgery the Warriors with West signed him to a 4 year $44 million contract. Sounds stupid now right? Some people were confused by this due to his injuries but that was Jerry taking advantage of the situation.  The Monta Ellis trade was a huge deal at the time as well. That move also had Jerry written all over it, he was still a great player and fans were unhappy. They received back a defensive center in Bogut, risky as his injuries seemed endless. But the most important part was it freed up minutes for a young Klay Thompson drafted while Jerry was there. Splash Bros is now born. Draymond, a young defensive minded player is also drafted during West’s tenure. Jerry stopped a Klay Thompson trade for Kevin Love at a critical point during their run. Jerry also was a centerpiece in the pitch to Durant during his free agency. The list goes on and on.  Quickly skipping everything he did for the Lakers is ridiculous if you’re going to try to analyze Jerry’s front office success. That was just as impressive as his Warriors run.  What you said about Memphis sounds completely wrong as well. Your post is lazy and written like a casual who doesn’t want to admit the Lakers fucked up saying no to him."
"I think it's more, ""We signed him because he was a positive asset we could get for losing Kevin Durant. We didn't care about his fit. If he ends up fitting on the team then great, but otherwise we'll trade him."""
"Top 5 Offensive (No order, ""complete"", skilled, offensive game):  Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, James Harden, Damian Lillard  Top 5 Defensive (No Order):  Rudy Gobert, Giannis Antetekoumpo, Paul George, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard  Top 5 2-Way Players (Great Defense + Offense)  Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetekoumpo"
"Offense in order; KD, Lebron, Steph, Harden, Kawhi This is playoffs and reg season combined.   Defense in order; Rudy gobert, Draymond green, Joel embiid, Kawhi leonard, Paul george  All around in Order; Kawhi leonard, Kevin durant, Joel embiid, Paul george, Jimmy butler"
Kevin Durant?
1. Russ isn’t seen as any sort of villain.   2. Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
With Billy Donovan they played the 73 win Warriors evenly in a war and looked like the better team for most of the series with the Warriors not even looking like they belonged in the middle of it  &amp;#x200B;  the difference is Kevin Durant
tell that to kevin durant. The Ws didn't help lol.
So Kevin Durant who’s 31 in 2 months get rounded down but Lebron whos 34 magically gets a year added?
Lol even if you don’t hoop that’s an insane opinion  Please explain to me how Kevin Durant averaging over 30/game and being great in the finals means he didn’t earn his ring
"I don't know, Shaq played in the Finals for three teams in his prime and wasn't too bad with the Suns, but we still see posts like this about his time with the Celtics and Cavs. There are always going to be former stars signing with random teams before they retire, which everyone will mostly forgot about in a few years and then someone will post a picture of a 41 year old Kevin Durant with a Timberwolves jersey on and people will react to it."
- LeBron: 97 - Kawhi Leonard: 97 - Giannis: 96 - Kevin Durant: 96 - James Harden: 96 - Steph Curry: 95 - Anthony Davis: 94 - Paul George: 93 - Damian Lillard: 92 - Joel Embiid: 91
"Everyone could see that coming, except for Kevin Durant."
"Same head size, same torso size, just super long arms and legs. Basic Kevin Durant."
 There's nothing wrong with OKC.    The biggest issue is they stole some else's team right when they drafted Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.   And then all the Oklahoma City fans claimed them like they were their own instead of accepting that they were the bandwagon fans that they were.   And then OKC Thunder never won anything and now the team is blown up and they're in the tank.   This is what happens when you steal someone else's team.
"wait, kevin durant was injured before hand though  are you saying that the warriors beat the sixers if the KD injury didnt happen, or is your excuse just the klay injury"
"Raptors officials have noticed a Clippers employee at roughly 75 percent of the team's games thus far this season. Clippers officials say they've been at less than 50 percent of Leonard's games. There have been games they attended where Leonard rested. That has included president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank, which is rare.

"[OC] Which team has the most outdated version of ADBlocker?  Got inspired by [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cd3qqw/manu_ginobili_installs_adblocker/) (This is also the last block of a Spur against AD :) ) and checked the players and teams that blocked Anthony Davis' shots all throughout his career. Davis has already missed 3887 field goal attempts, 367 of those were rejected by 175 different players, since 2012.

"Somehow Danny Ainge gets fleeced here. Cant believe he traded Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving.... etc etc.. and CP3 to Brooklyn"
*Kevin Durant has entered the chat *
"Dear lord, what an irresponsible post title.   1. BS has repeatedly listed Alibabi, as well as Roc nation, as examples of the many business opportunities available in NY and through the nets ownership group, and discussed those connections as ONE reason why KD was attracted to the Nets.   2. BS has done like 7 podcasts with Kevin Durant and actually knows him.   Almost every anti-bill Simmons circle jerk thread in this sub is based on either a misleading title, or a serious interpretation of something bill said whole joking around on a podcast, which is most of BS’s content."
"Absolutely not. Reality is it was always about duos. Kevin Durant just broke the rules for a few years, and the result was an insane arms race for a handful of contending teams, along with essentially half the league just giving up and tanking. Things are just back to normal now."
"I understand that Iggy has continuity and is an elite defender when needed, and steps his play up when it matters, but losing a man who averaged 6/3/3 is in no way a bigger deal than losing Kevin F’ing Durant"
idk if u noticed but kevin durant is injured
Anyone else remember these days?  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1953355-is-kevin-durant-or-carmelo-anthony-the-better-pure-scorer
"Klay isn't realistically expected to return before allstar break, and more realistically is out for the season recovering, especially after what went down with KD.  And it's stating the obvious here, but the team that swept the finals and took the champs to 6, got to the finals on the strength of prime Kevin Durant.   Notwithstanding the Rockets collapse in the WCF, I don't see the team we saw in the finals without KD being any kind of title favorite. You take Klay off as well, and I'm hardpressed to see them being a top 4 seed in the west unless you really believe in Dlo and aren't concerned with what their perimeter defense is going to look like with a russell/curry backcourt.  As far as lottery goes, that's in the event they end up just dnp'ing curry halfway through the season and intentionally tank if they know Klay isn't coming back til 2021. Does D'Angelo Russell + Draymond and the rest of that roster make the playoffs in the East, let alone the West this year?"
"Paul George - Kevin Durant, Draymond - Pascal Siakam, Klay - Jimmy Butler, Steph - James Harden, Andre Igoudala - PJ Tucker"
Wikipedia page for Rucker Parker doesn't even mention Kevin Durant LOL
Steph Curry - Jeff Teague  Klay Thompson - Andrew Wiggins  Andrew Iguodala - Jarrett Culver  Draymond Green - Robert Covington  Kevin Durant - Karl Anthony Towns   There you go. I've done it. I'm a genius.
Kevin Durant for joining the Warriors after blowing a 3-1 lead to them in the WCF.  Anthony Davis  Joel Embiid  Draymond Green
Uh they also had fucking kevin durant man lmfao and Iggy.
"This year, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James and Kevin Durant were not on the first team.  Why are they considered top 5 players smh"
PG's words himself that KD was the one who sold him on OKC  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/paul-george-says-kevin-durant-sold-him-on-okc-that-place-will-blow-you-away/
“I’m Kevin Durant” KD
Warriors had to get Kevin Durant he definitely bitched them. Spurs have Lebron's number though.
That's why the Warriors had to go get Kevin Durant.
This is a nonsense argument. One uses incredible length to do his athletic feats while the other used explosive leaping. Giannis is more like Scottie Pippen and Kevin Durant than he is like LeBron and Jordan. A different class of athlete entirely.
Imagine playing at Rucker and being the local hotshot and you look at the other team and they got Kevin fucking Durant lmao
Kevin Durant scheduled to return for Game 1 in the NBA Finals
Is Kevin Durant a 'Big Man'? Cause he crushes your Ibaka claim based solely on this one weird graph
Kevin Durant hasn’t publicly thanked the warriors and Bay Area for giving him the opportunity to win 2 titles.
[Woj] Breaking News: Kevin Durant bit Shaq's mom in the boob!
"Too bad LeBron didn't get to play against Gary Payton on a torn calf, Magic with AIDS and no Scott/Worthy, and Clyde Drexler instead of Kevin Durant + Steph Curry + Draymond Green + Klay Thompson"
"Both players are highly sought after talents. Both were on small market teams. Funny enough both were on the Thunder. Both players wanted to leave. Both players left.   Paul George and Russ just lost to the Portland Trailblazers. Paul George requested a trade, by going straight to his GM, and nothing more - all of which are in his rights while under contract. He talked to Russ and they both were fine with the idea of breaking it up. Paul George ended up on the 48-34 Clippers.   Kevin Durant and Russ had lost to the Golden State Warriors. Durant entered free agency. Durant did not tell his GM, nor did he talk to Russ about leaving for the team that just beat them - all of which are in his rights while in free agency. Durant ended up on the 73-9 Warriors.   Lol the problem isn’t that George was under contract. Davis and Kawhi were under contract? Carmelo was under contract? Hell, Russ was under contract. You think he didn’t want out? If Kerr wants to talk about imbalance and unfairness within the league, it’s signing a max-level player that wants to join them rather than beat them, right when the cap space for teams soars because of a new CBA deal.   If the cap doesn’t skyrocket like it did, KD can’t go to the Warriors. Free agency and the rules around cap space and contracts need to be worked on. Not whether players have too much influence on GMs. It’s nothing new."
"It's definitely not over, but it will probably never be what it was with Kevin Durant, which was utterly ridiculous."
"&gt;“Because I prefer a former MVP (Kevin Durant) to leave his team for nothing, and go to the Warriors, especially after we just beat their team in the WCF. What George did, giving his team SGA and 4 first rounders, it’s awful for the league. Only okay if he left the Thunder for nothing, and went to the Warriors”   I too see no difference between free agency and players under contract"
"this is false equivalency at its finest, KD is a free agent, the NOTHING in your point is actually the remaining 4 years of his contract that he played out with OKC, 4 years of prime Kevin Durant is worth a hell of a lot more than SGA and 4 mid to late first rounders that PG's trade got.  If rent a place for a year and they kick you out after a month but give you some macdonald coupons to compensate, you don't say ""oh i'm so lucky this is better than the last house I rented where they didn't give me anything after the lease is up"" You are still homeless."
I think it's still Kevin Durant.
Take pre-Achilles Kevin Durant - if he was 3 inches shorter and 75 pounds heavier and as muscular as LeBron while still retaining all of his current shooting and driving - do you think he'd be better or worse than LeBron?
Bruno Mars and Lebron James?  Justin Bieber and Giannis?  Arianna Grande and Kawhi Leonard    Nah the Goats would actually be   Kevin Durant and Taylor Swift ft. Rhianna 😍
"They lost Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and Jordan Bell  The only real impactful player they got back is D-Lo..  They lost their best player, bench got worse and the West is now tougher."
"This year yes coming yes, last 10 years no.  The lebron show vs some superteam some where for the past 10 years has gotten old asf. Just my personal opinion.   Kevin Durant moving to GSW ruined the nba for a few years. Just wasn’t enjoyable to watch, no one I know talks basketball anymore because of the fact it just wasn’t entertaining for the competitiveness."
"&gt;These quotes prolly explain why guys like kyrie, pg, kawhi, jimmy butler, kd, kyrie again, all said no to bron bron.  You can literally say the same thing about Kawhi Leonard or any other star/superstar this offseason when it comes to recruiting players lol  Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Jimmy Butler all didn't want to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers, so the Clippers had to trade for Paul George lol  I'm using Kawhi Leonard as an example since there were reports of Kawhi Leonard trying to recruit other stars/superstars to see if they wanted to join him in signing with the Clippers lol"
"“Because I prefer a former MVP (Kevin Durant) to leave his team for nothing, and go to the Warriors, especially after we just beat their team in the WCF. What George did, giving his team SGA and 4 first rounders, it’s awful for the league. Only okay if he left the Thunder for nothing, and went to the Warriors”"
"Eh, LeBron-haters are being outnumbered by his stans/fanboys. LeBron was never the guy who got the biggest criticism (well, except NBA Finals 2011), it has always been Bosh or Kevin Love getting most of the hate. And I'm not really sure why you're saying Durant's move to Warriors isn't anywhere close to the level o hate LeBron got to join Miami Heat. Durant is still the most hated NBA player by a landslide while LeBron has got nothing but love &amp; respect after his legendary Game 6 performance against Boston Celtics in 2012."
How dare Kevin Durant be a Free Agent
"I mean his team benefitted from a rare cap spike allowing them to get Kevin Durant for free, that was a lot worse for the league than Pelicans/Thunder getting massive hauls for their superstars. I may be in the minority but I think small market teams being able to get assets for their stars is a lot better for the league than them losing players for free and having to completely start from scratch."
meanwhile kevin durant has been singing 1+1s with the warriors
"any of the Kevins? Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Mchale"
"Most greats are defined by their first names. But I think I've heared guys like Westbrook or Tim Duncan refered to their last name way more than their first name. Same with Durant and Harden too. It's because their first names are too generic. Even Jordan was more referenced as Jordan than Michael during commentary.    It's just that a name like Kobe or Lebron, or Dirk (in context of NBA players' names) are uncommon and unique compared to Tim or Kevin or James."
"I’ve never seen anyone call KD of Kevin, it’s always Durant, KD, Cupcake and snake."
"I was thinking this or Kevin Durant. You know each by his last name, but not the first, just since the name is so popular among other great players."
The idea is to get a discount Kevin durant if we put him on the 3
"[Wojnarowski] According to my sources the New York Knicks are offering Kevin Durant a ten day, 800K max contract."
"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/08/01/david-griffin-pelicans-rebuild-zion-williamson-anthony-davis-trade-lebron-james-cavaliers  Noise around a superteam is deafening. It can cause combustible conditions. “The reason is LeBron is getting all the credit and none of the blame. And that’s not fun for people,” Griffin says. “They don’t like being part of that world.”  James’ string of one-year contracts held the franchise captive. Anything short of a championship was unsatisfactory.   ...  Maneuvering the league’s most expensive cap sheet was nothing short of daunting. Gilbert loomed. Griffin’s misery creeped on top of the stress. “We won despite our culture to a huge degree. And I knew it. I knew what we weren’t doing,” he says. “There were so many things during that period of time that I wanted to do differently. If you make everything about, ‘It’s a destination. Damn the torpedos, I gotta get there,’ that might be the only time you get there.” Even still, James accepted the GM’s feedback along the way. “He knew I could help him win,” Griffin says. And so James approved of Griffin as a basketball decision–maker, allowing a steady dialogue. “You’ve got to be willing to have very difficult conversations with LeBron,” Griffin says. “I always was, which is why we had a great relationship, because I would tell him what he needed to hear and he respected that I was telling him that for the right reasons.”   ...  Across the aisle, Golden State repeatedly regrouped. Draymond Green recruited none other than Kevin Durant. Head coach Steve Kerr, Griffin’s former mentor in Phoenix, prohibited lethargy in his system. The front office gambled on high-upside draft prospects and cultivated a winning G-League affiliate in Santa Cruz. Stephen Curry’s selfless leadership threaded throughout the organization in direct contrast to the environment brewing in Cleveland’s kingdom."
"Yes I’m strictly talking about iso defense. Go ahead and watch the Miami heat vs Brooklyn nets 2012 I believe. Joe Johnson scores 3 straight points on Lebron, no screens no thing.  Kevin Durant game 1 had scored on Lebron 3+ times. When Lebron slipped, a blow pass And then a dunk to finish it off, then I believe in game 3 he hit a dagger. I couldn’t remember if there was a screen but I know he didn’t use it.  And Paul George scores on Lebron plenty of times watch the playoff games."
A reminder that KD apologized for what he said about OKC: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/sports/basketball/kevin-durant-twitter.html
How about “Gordon Hayward is earning more than James Harden and Kevin Durant next season”
"He didn't clapback though. As I said, the post was not directed at KD: https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2018/07/11/kevin-durant-argues-high-school-kid-instagram"
Wrong because Kevin Durant exists.  Also OP how come u don’t even deliver the fucking %.
Are you all Kevin Durant
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, Elgin Baylor, Scottie Pippen, Rick Barry, John Havlicek, Paul Pierce (not a fan of him but I'd pick him over Melo), Dominique Wilkins, James Worthy, Alex English.  Also players like Grant Hill and Vince Carter, I'd take over Melo"
Yes. He/his camp [came out](https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/kevin-durants-close-friend-porzingis-trade-cost-the-knicks/) and said I'm right. Only Durant can definitively say if he would or wouldn't have been willing to play with Porzingis.
He shot better from 3 than Kevin Durant last year.
Kevin Durant getting injured was terrible. He’s at the peak of his prime and it would have been great for the East to have a Kyrie and KD duo. I think their games actually gel really well together.
"Maryland, actually  [Says Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=where+was+kevin+durant+born&amp;rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS832US832&amp;oq=where+was+kevin+d&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2623j1j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)"
As one of the 4 Kevin Durant Stans I love this message.
Fuck Kevin Durant - Lil B
"Gotta have balance, don't be like Harden and refuse the opportunity when give it. Don't be like Melo or Tatum and use it too much. Unless your name is Kevin Durant, then I would advise to use it liberally."
* Kevin Durant signed with the 73-9 Warriors as a free agent after blowing a 3-1 lead over them in the playoffs. * Rod Strickland used to eat hot dogs on the bench/before a game and would puke during games. So often that it became a story but he couldn't break the habit.
"1. Russell Wilson would be comparable to Kyrie Irving to me. A little undersized, but had incredible talent. Won a championship but hasn't been able to capture lightning in a bottle again. 2. Patrick Mahomes would be comparable to Nikola Jokic to me. Somewhat slept on, not expected to develop quickly, and quickly made his team a relevant contender. 3. LeBron James is probably more comparable to Tom Brady. Constantly defies father time to make it to plaoffs every year. 4. Aaron Rodgers is Chris Paul to me. Came out the gates strong, should have more rings than he has. Has shown to be prone to injury late in his career. 5. Drew Brees is Kevin Durant to me. In many cases should be considered the best at his position if it weren't for another generational talent (LeBron). 6. James Harden is Phillip Rivers to me. Consistently produces ridiculous numbers but can snag a ring.  Just some takes"
"&gt;You’re completely glossing over that Kevin Durant joined the greatest team of all time. Lebron went to Cleveland, who had a young Kyrie, and traded for Love.    &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;It’s just different magnitudes.  You're mixing up two different situations. You aren't comparing apples to apples. We aren't comparing KD joining Golden State to LeBron joining Cleveland. We are comparing KD joining Golden State and then Brooklyn to LeBron joining Miami and then Cleveland.  LeBron didn't get hate for joining Cleveland. He got hate for joining Miami while taking Bosh with him to form a super team with Wade. That hate eventually went away when he rejoined Cleveland and won the title. People were burning LeBron's jersey in Cleveland after he left for Miami. Other fans seen them as the villain after the whole decision fiasco. The hate was real.  LeBron got hate for Miami while KD got hate for Golden State.  LeBron's hate settled when he went back to Cleveland and won. Time will tell if the KD hate settles now that he's on Brooklyn."
"You’re completely glossing over that Kevin Durant joined the greatest team of all time. Lebron went to Cleveland, who had a young Kyrie, and traded for Love. That’s not a superteam like the Warriors. Cleveland is Lebron’s hometown, is pretty much considered a joke, and Lebron had to Super Saiyan the best team ever after being down 3-1. Theres so much fucking shit that had to go perfectly.   Durant’s move to Golden State was way more cowardly, which I dont think you get, and is why everyone thinks he’s a bitch, coward, snake, etc. Winning in Brooklyn won’t mean as much because he has no ties to the Nets. Maybe if he beats a 70 win team but there’s not going to be one.   It’s just different magnitudes."
"Let me elaborate more on that first situation since you don't seem to want to. All-Star Kevin Durant (HOF) joined forces with a team led by the first unanimous MVP in history, Stephen Curry (HOF), who along with Klay Thompson (HOF) make up the best backcourt we've ever seen. All-Star Draymond Green (Debatable HOF) is also here. He tucked his tail between his legs and ran to the very team that he and Russ choked away a 3-1 lead to in the conference finals. LeBron and Bosh made a playoff team into a contending team. KD made a contending team unstoppable."
Lebron James has the same usage rate as Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. They are all career 30% USG rate guys.  MJ is a career 33% USG rate guy and has 2 seasons with a 38% USG rate and another year with a 36% USG rate. This sub's obsession with Lebron's ball dominance in particular is weird.
"So is there something to the fact that stars don't want to play with Joel Embid? Lebron didn't go there when he had the chance and Jimmy Butler left.   Is there something to the fact that stars don't want to play with Kawhi Leonard? Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler, and Mike Conley rejected him."
Kevin Durant will be the best player to never enter the GOAT discussion
"By coming up against a team with Seth curry money, *and* Kevin Durant money.... *and* Klay Thompson money? Aaaand I'm done, oops, *and* Draymond Green money"
Different person here. Make your case for Pippen over:  -Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -Larry Bird -Kobe Bryant -Wilt Chamberlain -Tim Duncan -Kevin Durant -Julius Erving -Kevin Garnett -LeBron James -Magic Johnson -Michael Jordan -Karl Malone -Moses Malone -Dirk Nowitzki -Hakeem Olajuwon -Shaquille O'Neal -Oscar Robertson -David Robinson -Bill Russell -Jerry West
"I think it's super-close. Kobe may be the inarguably better 2-way player, but for one thing, Durant's no slouch on D, &amp; another, those all-team selections are sometimes not worth a damn. (Klay Thompson)  Part of me wants to give the nod to Durant because the ease at which he can get a good shot, but this past postseason against the clippers, he had a crazy timid game, only getting up a dozen or so attempts. It was right before the 'Im kevin durant' game, I think. His team was like---""Ur one of the best scorers this league has ever seen, &amp; these games matter---so SHOW UP.""   I don't think Kobe would've given a team that problem. Lol. I know MJ wouldn't.   At any rate, I guess you could answer it by asking what the team in question needs more, wing defense or rim protection. Offensively they're both top tier, period."

kevin durant is a better on defense than lebron
"I don't understand the downvotes. Lebron is clearly a better player and has had a better career than KD at this point. One is in the GOAT conversation and the other likely never would have been. Just not a complete enough game most of his career. Although if he stayed healthy and could win a ring somewhere else he certainly rises significantly.   So no disrespect to Lebron. But it is fair to say beating Stephen Curry (22 PPG 2016 finals) is just not the same as beating Kevin Durant. What team won a championship who's best player was not 6'6+ and athletic. In 2012 Heat were a better more experienced team. Hence a ""competitive"" 4-1. In 2017 &amp; 2018 Warriors were super stacked and Cavs had no chance. Hence a truly uncompetitive 8-1.   We never saw these guys with evenly matched All-Star teams. There are no 'equals' to Lebron at his peak similar to how there weren't equals to Jordan in his time. But KD is probably the only person in the NBA talented enough over the last 7 year to challenge that assumption without having more help than Lebron. Lebron knew KD was likely going to remain his primary challenger from 2012 on, but they didn't meet again until the odds were stacked for KD. So we never got to see a peak Kobe vs peak Lebron. We did get a peak KD vs peak Lebron but it wasn't the competitive series everyone would've liked to have seen."
Kevin Durant would join the Kkk
"Who was a better perimeter defender in their peak, Harrison Barnes or Kevin Durant?"
Pre-Achilles injured Kevin Durant: Definitely.  Post-Achilles injured  Kevin Durant: Highly doubt it.
" https://nypost.com/2019/06/22/nets-man-behind-the-scenes-who-could-seal-kevin-durants-fate/  This was posted June 22nd. Its not that outlandish that Kyrie (which you conveniently ignore me mentioning for leaving GSW) and this doctor played roles in getting him to Brooklyn   &gt;The Nets can’t offer Kevin Durant more money or more rings than he can earn with the Warriors.  &gt;What they can promise is among the best training and performance staffs in the NBA. And they can provide proximity to their orthopedic specialist, Dr. Martin O’Malley, who not only operated on Durant’s ruptured Achilles tendon earlier this month, but also performed surgery on his broken foot four years ago.  &gt;That could be vital. Durant reportedly is angry over the medical care he got from Golden State and upset the Warriors compelled him into returning from his right calf injury to play in Game 5 of the NBA Finals — in which he suffered the ruptured Achilles."
"Inflated is not the right word for it. Some similarities to the 87 finals in terms of high scoring.   Not even playoff career highs for Lebron (2017 vs raptors). Typical numbers for him ie. 2012 vs celtics similar FGA. 2018 Lebrons finals numbers were similar despite getting swept and having a broken hand, neither series as high scoring as 2017 finals.  Perhaps Lebron's numbers from 2015 were either 'inflated' or 'deflated' (efficiency) due to the additional scoring burden being on him but 2017 finals seems right in line. Lebron in the 2018 'carry job' put up similar numbers to 2017 finals throughout the postseason in 2018.    Kyrie's numbers were inflated because he took a couple more shots than 2016 on similar efficiency, same with Loves. Curry took fewer shots in 2017 than he did in 2018 which was a lower scoring series. In fact Curry just put up career highs in 2019 on fewer attempts than the previous year. Overall not much of a case for inflated stats all around.   Which leads me to suspect your whole idea of inflated numbers is we should search for some reason to discredit Kevin Durant's career highs from the 2017 finals. He took about one more shot per game than he did in 2012 or later in 2018, so I would say most of the reason for the better performance from KD was due not in fact to it being a high scoring affair and more to do with spacing due to playing with superior teammates namely, one Stephen Curry. Yes, there were several highlight open dunks for KD, I saw them. At the time people were critical, mainly being upset that KD had joined and ruined the NBA. But to be fair if KD had stayed healthy this year I think it would've been a totally different pace in this year's finals but I think in fact he would've put up similar numbers to 2017, maybe even better. So yeah, I think it's clear that either super team from 2017 would've easily dispatched this year's champs and the Warriors almost swept in 2017 .... which is ridiculous to think about.   TLDR: Warriors team was too OP. Cavs took and made a fuck ton of 3s. A lot of offensive talent  = harder to defend &amp; naturally easier for both stars and role players. This, in turn, led to higher-scoring game.  But stars don't depend on 'easier' shots to get theirs in the postseason and often put up career numbers when they have less help (Curry 2019, Lebron 2015). Finally, Durant was amazing in 2017. It would've been great to see Durant truly chuck, efficiency be damned. Then I would've believed his numbers were ""inflated"", while nonetheless awesome."
Kevin Durant and Lebron are both bashed way more than Russ.
"""hold my beer""  \-Kevin Durant"
"Kevin Durant is a far more efficient scorer, an underrated playmaker, and can be a rim protector on defense."
"It's interesting that the players seemed aware of this too. Here's an excerpt from Iggy's book:  &gt; We all get frustrated with each other the way all families get frustrated. We get on Klay for taking fifty-foot jumpers when we're up by three with ten seconds on the clock. We get on Steph for making lackadaisical passes. **After we got Kevin Durant we would get frustrated with him for caring too much what people think.** They get frustrated with me when I'm not aggressive or in attack mode. But at the end of the day, this is our family. And we will stay with it, no matter what.  Here's a tweet with more of the quote, but it's mostly about Draymond: https://twitter.com/juliephayer/status/1155627796435099648?s=20"
It came down to Lebron wasn't really open to joining a system led team where he had to play a role vs Kevin Durant who was entirely open to learning new ways to play the game. He leveled up like crazy with GS. LeBron still hasn't learned to play off the ball and he's 34yo... I can't see a 34yo leading an offense for 82 games then leading them to the playoffs. I just can't. He'd be on another level of athlete that I've never seen before.
"inb4 predictable ""Found Kevin Durant"" comment"
"I would say Kevin Durant, Kyrie, and Harden are all more polarizing tham Lebron."
Kevin Durant
The Heat had to completely rebuild their roster to accommodate for James/Bosh. The Warriors basically just replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant and got to keep players like Iguodala and Livingston.

"Why would you compare KD to Kobe's injury which he suffered at 34 years old? That makes no sense at all. It's much more realistic to compare him to Wilkins or Gay, who both bounced back very well after suffering the injury at a similar age to KD.. Wilkins put up a career year after his Achilles injury.  Dirk wasn't coming off an Achilles at 33, but he also wasn't Kevin Durant. He was an absolute bad ass, but KD is one of the greatest players of all time and he's just turning 31. Everyone is acting like he's 37 years old or something, his body is still in its prime otherwise. He'll be slower and with probably less vertical but he'll still be 7 feet tall with elite BBIQ and efficiency."
There is literally no actual basis for that and no timeline has been given. He could be back in 8 months and put up 30ppg next season. Google Dominique Wilkins' and Rudy Gary's recoveries.  I'm not saying it's a sure thing but it's ridiculous the amount of people who think he's going to come back and play like 35 year old Kobe or something. This is Kevin Durant.

"Good morning. In less than an hour, NBA Super Star Kevin Durant will join other NBA Super Stars from around the world. And they will be launching the largest NBA Super Team in the history of mankind -- The Golden State Warriors.  Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.  We can't be consumed by our petty fandom anymore.  We will be united in our common hatred.  Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be shit-posting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from NBA parity.  We're fighting for our right to celebrate, to hate the Warriors.  And should The East win the championship, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:  ""We will not go quietly into the night!  We will not vanish without a fight!  We're going to live on!  We're going to survive!""  Today, we celebrate The Warriors Losing the Championship Day!"
"To add to this, Jay Williams (who is a friend of Durant and his agent) said on Lowe's podcast that Kevin was unfulfilled because he could never develop the relationships he wanted with other members of the team and that's something he was rwllyooking forward to at Golden State, and that's why he went to Brooklyn, because they agreed to accommodate him and his friends Kyrie Irving and Deandre Jordan.  Say why you want about Durant but it's kind of fucked to complain about his choices when he's clearly very emotionally invested in basketball. Just because you're a top athlete doesn't mean you have to be motivated by just money or being competitive.  There's a lot of other good stuff about Kevin in the podcast and it's just the first 30-45 minutes or so, I'd suggest checking it out"

"Having DJ only stunts Allen's growth, and it's a gross overpay. Everyone is shitting on the Knicks for sticking to a long term vision beyond the next three seasons. I don't see any scenario where this goes well for Brooklyn. If KD were healthy, I'd be a lot less skeptical obviously because he's Kevin fucking Durant lol but a 32 year old off a torn Achilles is no joke."
"Rod Thorn was an assistant coach in 1976 when the Nets, as they moved from the American Basketball Association to the N.B.A., made the oft-lamented decision to sell Julius Erving’s contract to the Philadelphia 76ers. Twenty-five years later, Thorn was the architect of the best trade in Nets history as the general manager who brought in Jason Kidd, who then led the woebegone franchise to back-to-back trips to the N.B.A. finals.  All of those memories, from the worst and best of a past life, came rushing back to Thorn on Sunday night. He was watching from his home in Rye, N.Y., as the Nets won their most meaningful duel yet with New York’s purportedly more glamorous basketball team — handily.  The Nets achieved, in less than four years, what the Knicks have been chasing for nearly 20: They signed two of the league’s most coveted free agents. They lured the fantasy partnership of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to Brooklyn because Durant and Irving concluded that no other team in the N.B.A. was better positioned to handle their star power.  The Nets era of Jason Kidd, right, and Kenyon Martin was the team’s most successful, but a championship remained just out of reach.Getty Images  The Nets era of Jason Kidd, right, and Kenyon Martin was the team’s most successful, but a championship remained just out of reach. The Nets era of Jason Kidd, right, and Kenyon Martin was the team’s most successful, but a championship remained just out of reach.Getty Images “The Nets have always been second in this area, because of the history, because of Madison Square Garden, because of everything the Knicks stand for,” Thorn said in a phone interview. Recalling a stretch in which the Nets won 24 of 31 meetings between the teams, including a playoff sweep in 2004, Thorn added, “We had a much better team with Jason, but they were the Knicks.”  They still are. Only now those Knicks have to contend with a geographical rival that emerged in record time from what appeared to be the bleakest of N.B.A. futures. Only three seasons removed from a 21-61 finish in 2015-16, and under a new general manager who began the climb without the usual draft and trade assets to improve, the Nets were seen as the far more desirable destination.  The best place to merge their talents, above all, is what Durant and Irving were looking for, according to a person familiar with their plans who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Their determination to play together proved even stronger, in the end, than many league observers expected.  The Knicks and the Nets were the two teams that could most easily accommodate the players’ salary demands, along with their shared desire to live in New York. Irving’s enthusiasm for everything else the Nets could provide the star tandem, starting with General Manager Sean Marks’s playoff-ready roster, increasingly appealed to Durant as the 2018-19 season wore on and the start of free agency grew near, according to the person.  Irving’s fondness for the Nets, which grew throughout a season of tension and disappointment with the Boston Celtics, is not merely an offshoot of his New Jersey childhood. It stems in part from a hard sell of the franchise to Irving by Spencer Dinwiddie, the Nets reserve guard, after they shared a course at Harvard in September. Dinwiddie was Irving’s classmate in a Harvard Business School program for athletes, “Crossover Into Business,” that commenced last fall and continued remotely for a semester.  It was there that the two players from disparate talent tiers began building the bond that led to a regular dialogue and, by Sunday, brought Dinwiddie to the Nets’ practice facility. Dinwiddie, who did not respond to a request for comment, was among the invitees summoned to join top team officials on the night Irving and Durant committed the next four seasons of their careers to the team that has spent virtually all of its 52-year existence in the Knicks’ shadow.  Julius Erving, known as Dr. J, was a star for the Nets in the American Basketball Association but became a bigger star in the N.B.A. after the team sold his contract to the Philadelphia 76ers.Associated Press  Julius Erving, known as Dr. J, was a star for the Nets in the American Basketball Association but became a bigger star in the N.B.A. after the team sold his contract to the Philadelphia 76ers.Associated Press Many rival teams had believed for months that Durant and Irving would team up next season — but that they would do so with the Knicks. In the halls of Oracle Arena, especially, fears that Durant was unfulfilled as a Warrior and talk of losing him to the Knicks were frequent topics among edgy Golden State Warriors team officials, coaches and, occasionally, players.  Across the country, Dinwiddie was “at the forefront” of the monthslong push to persuade Irving to prioritize the Nets over the Knicks and to nudge Durant in the same direction, according to one person familiar with the Nets’ pursuit of Irving who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.  The New York Times first reported last week that the Nets had also begun to heavily recruit the veteran center DeAndre Jordan, one of Durant’s closest friends, to form an incoming trio with Durant and Irving. Jordan spent the last two months of the 2018-19 season as a Knick, but two people briefed on the negotiations said Jordan also was convinced in recent days that Barclays Center would be a more hospitable backdrop for Durant and Irving than Madison Square Garden and joined the chorus promoting the Nets.  Some around the league believe Durant’s recent Achilles’ tendon tear, more than any James L. Dolan-related ineptitude, is what doomed the Knicks. Such thinking holds that if he wasn’t forced to sit out most or all of next season, Durant might have lobbied harder for Irving to follow him to the Garden. But one former N.B.A. All-Star, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss his colleagues’ plans, said Durant and Irving were already mentioning the Nets’ attractiveness as a free-agent alternative to the Knicks before the end of the regular season.  It’s a handy reminder that in the modern N.B.A. top players and their representatives take a more active role in team building than ever before. It’s an environment in which communicators flourish.  Credit should go to Marks for gradually pulling the Nets out of the muck through a string of savvy moves. Durant and Irving could reach only one conclusion upon assessing the city’s two franchises: The Knicks lag behind the Nets on the structure, roster and ready-to-contend curves — even after the Nets’ previous regime essentially surrendered control of the team’s first-round draft pick to the Celtics from 2013 to 2018 in an infamously ill-conceived trade.  Yet it’s also true that the Nets needed to secure Irving’s keen buy-in to then get Durant’s. That was the only sure way to persuade Durant, a two-time N.B.A. finals most valuable player, to spurn the security of a five-year, $221 million offer to return to the Warriors, and reject strong interest from the Los Angeles Clippers and the now-crestfallen Knicks.  Kevin Durant, right, has proved to be a transformational player, first alongside James Harden, left, with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and then with the Golden State Warriors, where he won two championships.Jeff Chiu/Associated Press  Kevin Durant, right, has proved to be a transformational player, first alongside James Harden, left, with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and then with the Golden State Warriors, where he won two championships.Jeff Chiu/Associated Press It was Dinwiddie’s job to lead the recruiting of Irving. Amid a breakout season in which he averaged 16.9 points and 4.6 assists in 28.1 minutes per game and earned a three-year, $34 million contract extension in December, Dinwiddie took advantage of the league’s policy not to deem player-to-player discussions as potential tampering violations as long as a player is not acting on directives from the front office.  Of course, even in the Nets’ triumph, there is no shortage of skepticism about their future.  Durant faces a daunting road back to health to hush the naysayers who question whether he can return to peak level. Irving was widely pegged as the foremost source of the toxicity in Boston’s locker room last season and will be under a microscope in his interactions with teammates and Coach Kenny Atkinson to see how he affects the Nets’ vaunted chemistry — especially in Year 1 while Durant is healing. At the same time, the Nets’ new team owner, Joe Tsai, will start his reign in earnest — and all of these unknowns precede the Nets’ seeing how the two outsize personalities will click when Durant returns.  Not that a sage like Thorn, who, at 78, still serves as a special consultant to the Milwaukee Bucks, can comprehend such fretting after the highs, lows and never-ending challenges he endured as a Net.  “The irony of it to me was that both the Knicks and the Nets were after these players,” Thorn said. “And the Nets got them.  “Wow.”"
No it seems he was already planning on joining Kyrie during the summer. https://957thegame.radio.com/articles/howard-beck-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-planned-team-2018-19-season-even-began
"Me. A little. I loved them up until two days ago. They were my third team behind Lakers and Raptors. Then Kevin Durant joined, and now I feel slightly annoyed every time they are mentioned. I’m still trying to tell myself that this is a good thing for the Nets."
"People expect him to be Kevin Durant quality because he was paid so much.  He was paid a lot true, but that doesn’t mean he’s a bad player.  He’s easily a top 100 player, maybe top 75-50, but he’s made as much or more money than Kyrie/Klay/Kawhi, so people look at him through that lens.  Imagine he was making 12-15 mil, people would call him a steal.  I love him but damn that’s a lot of money."
"Knowing that everyone deals with it SHOULD engender some empathy that we’re all closer to each other than we realize.  That money doesn’t bring happiness and we’re all searching for meaning within the relationships we create and the shit we go through   Kevin Durant was raised in a single parent household in DC. I’m positive he knows what it’s like to struggle. And life is showing him the things he thought would make it easier don’t. And your response to that is “tough titties”. If someone said that shit to you, you wouldn’t like it. Why put that energy out in the world if you wouldn’t take it from anyone else.   It’s some holier-than-thou “I’m struggling and broke so I deserve more sympathy than you, sight unseen, and you can fuck yourself for thinking otherwise”. It’s short-sighted and if someone came at you that way, you’d be just as pissy as this comment indicates."
Depends on you perspective I suppose.  Kevin Durant finished his contract before changing teams and we still called him a snek.  Kawhi Leonard forced his way out and we call him the least selfish player in the entire league.
It's a joke holy shit.   You are more sensitive than Kevin Durant
How can they offer something to him after the injury if he said Kevin Durant is gonna be a Laker months before the injury
He also said Kevin Durant is coming to the Lakers lol
The same people who shit on Kevin Durant a few years ago are praising Lebron for doing the same thing.
This isn’t a reality tv show or a freaking soap opera. These dumb narratives that you bring up are mostly created by the media and fans and the fact that you think you know what Kevin Durant wants more than he does is asinine. How old are you?
"Woah! Way to overreact there  I can agree that it probably wasn't the right time or place to say something like that but it was pretty clear from the start that the Warriors and Kevin Durant were just using each other. Everybody knew KD wouldn't have stayed there. He just wanted his rings to shut the media up.  Also there might be a chance there was some backstory between him and Durant that we don't even know about that prompted him saying this. Or maybe he just wanted to hype Curry up, since he is the face of the franchise, and did mean no offence to Kevin"
"I like the general plan.  A mix of vets and young players that can fit our timeline, all easy to divest from if they don't pan out or an opportunity shows up.  Not 100% on all the signings themselves, but with the amount of team control we have over the entire roster, it's hard to be too upset.  We have all of our draft assets and then some.  After the KD injury, the only FA I really wanted to land was Kawhi, and I never though we had a real shot with him to begin with so whatever.  I'm genuinely fine with not landing KD; I don't think his injury is something you can simply gloss over with ""bUt 80% kEvIn DuRaNt"", as though that's how any of it works.  Trading for AD made little sense given the team's situation.  So yeah, given the situation (much of which was completely out of our control), I'm mostly fine with our offseason.  If KD was healthy, it would be a completely different story.  But he's not."
No it didn’t. That’s a narrative created after the fact. The truth simply is that he didn’t want to go there. Say it with me now. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving did not want to go to the New York Knicks. The same way Lebron didn’t. The same way Kawhi doesn’t. The same way countless other stars haven’t wanted to in the last two decades.   Once you accept that things will get better.
Dolan literally made a statement about it and put Kevin Durant in his season ticket materials. What alternate reality were you living in?
Not Kevin Durant
"I think we all should tamper our expectations--He's (Durant) not Cousins, but he's still a 7 ft with being, that, unlike cousins, depends on his legs to get by defenders. Kevin likes to hard plant to create space. While he may be able to shoot over most defenders, if he loses mobility and or loses the ability to consistently get by his dude; he becomes guard'able.   We also know, that in many instances, you suffer additional setbacks simply because you've gone from 10 to 100, and have managed to injure some other part of your body be-it overcompensation or whatever have you.   He should probably sit the entire year, but he'll probably feel the pressure to make out there by the post-season."
"I don’t understand a why people seem to think the Achilles is so much worse for a big man. I know nothing about it medically speaking but I would assume that a 7 foot mans Achilles is different and stronger than a 6 foot mans Achilles. I also think someone like boogie would adjust better than a perimeter player because his game is less predicated on athleticism.   I also don’t know why everyone just assumes this injury won’t be a big deal for Kd. This injury wrecks just about everyone, Kevin Durant is better pure shooter than Kobe Bryant no doubt and 6 inches taller. That said Kobe had an entire book of skills, and ways to score and the injury took him for elite to well below average. I don’t understand why no one is worried about this injury"
"Yes, for each other. The Warriors signed Kevin Durant and sent him to the Nets, the Nets signed D'Angelo Russell and sent him to the Warriors. They swapped, and the Warriors got a couple other small fries to make the totals work."
The Colts drafting Andrew Luck and releasing Peyton Manning. In the NBA...maybe Seattle losing Ray Allen and drafting Kevin Durant.

"[Thompson] Stephen Curry flew straight to the New York area from Shanghai, China. But he wasn’t going to pitch Kevin Durant on why he should stay with the Warriors. It was already too late. And Curry didn’t turn the jet around or cancel the trip.It was about respect. It was about butt fingering."
"&gt;Kevin Durant not feeling appreciated  Imo this is such BS. For most of the season they all talked highly of him and even more so during the playoffs after he got injured. Steve Kerr was basically kissing KDs ass. KD genuinely may have not felt appreciated but you really can't put the blame on the Warriors.   &gt;Andre Iguodala saying they lied about his injury last year and then traded him  This may be true but there were reports that Iguodala knew he was gonna get traded the week before. Him leaking this stuff was not the reason why they traded him   &gt;D’Angelo Russell agreeing to sign &amp; trade with them to be traded away the same year  Again this is all based off of assumptions of ""D-Lo not being a good fit"".. Let them play some games first at least."
"When I was a young warthog, it was always my dream to shower alongside kevin durant and james harden. That ball hog russel westbrook STOLE them from me and i havent recovered since."

"&gt;Most analysts do not put durant over bird, so there’s that.  Durant averaged 35/8/7 in the 2017 nba finals, bird has never had an nba finals better than that, so no, Bird wouldnt win FMVP over KD... you're talking out of your ass  &gt;There’s something called deductive reasoning. If he attempts less 3s and scores the same points on similar FG pcts, what does that tell u about inside to mid range scoring.  no its called faulty logic. Bird shoots has a 37% 3PT% and Curry has a 43% 3PT%, so no, that does not mean that Bird has a higher FG% from midrange or attempts more shots in the paint... esp considering he attempted more FTs than Steph  &gt;U know what breaks down a double team?(box and 1) great playmaking. Double teams would not work on a top tier facillitator, duh. Lebron and bird would feast on a box and one lol.   lmao first of all, go watch the 2011 nba finals and report back to me about how Bron would destroy a zone defense... JJ BArea locked his ass up dude, meanwhile Steph averaged 30/5/5 and still gets killed for it  second of all, what does ""playmaking"" have anything to do with it when none of Steph's teammates can make wide open 3s? Thats the only reason the box and one worked, bc the raptors were letting Iguodala, Green, and Cook take wide open 3s and they couldnt make them pay. Its not like if you replaced steph with bird, Iguodala and Green would magically start making wide open 3s... again, faulty logic  &gt;If u actually watched the games, you would see that curry is not as clutch as ppl like kobe and bird. But then again u wanna talk pcts. Haha.  lol again, random baseless accusations that don't have any substance... like i said, ""YoU juSt bRiNg Up StAts"" is a dumb response that doesn't disprove anything  &gt;Being the best guy on a team who won numerous championships is a very weird and arbitrary thing to rate someone on? Ok then. I guess it does not speak to ones legacy at all.  no, “strength of teammates” seems like a very weird and arbitrary thing. bc if Bird had KD, Dray, and Klay on his team, he wouldn't have been the clear cut best player... and if Steph had Bird’s team he would have been the clear cut best player... so its a dumb argument  and ""again, you're basically just repeating all the dumb stuff talking heads like kellerman or cowherd have been saying, and you don't sound like someone who actually watches the games. again, Steph’s previous 3 finals wins he averaged 26/6/6... all other players with that stat line won FMVP... you saying Steph has a history of being “significantly worse” kinda juss shows me that you don’t watch the games. And steph getting killed for having a 30/5/5 finals where he got box and one'd is absolutely hilarious  prime example where you sound like someone who doesn't watch the games. Steph was getting blitzed and doubled on every PnR from the cavs, meanwhile KD got George Hill on the block whenever he wanted. That doesn't happen without steph's gravity and the defensive pressure he forces, yet you think Curry suddenly becomes ""significantly less"" valuable during finals. The Cavs purposely do whatever they can to take curry out of the game and just let KD get his, and the raptors fucking box and one'd Steph... a defense NBA teams haven't even used on MJ, Kobe, or Lebron. That defensive attention he forces IS Steph's value, and you'd know that if you watched the games and not just watch First Take"" was a response to you saying ""KD is more valuable than steph in the finals, and steph has no finals map's"", not necessarily a comparison to bird  &gt;They beat a broken down cavs, lost to a cavs team they should have beaten. If the warriors are a better team than the cavs, and curry is the leader of the warriors, isn’t the responsibility on him when they lose? Does that not mean he didn’t play as well as he should have if the better team lost? What about Curry’s 3pt pcts in numerous games against the raps? On one half I remember he was like 1/8 or some shit.  lol bc Bird never had a bad finals. he got outplayed by kevin mchale in 1985 and was pretty subpar in the 1987 finals  god, this conversation is going no where, you just keep throwing baseless claims or faulty logic at me, and most of this shit I've said is just me repeating myself... unless you have any new points that aren't based in faulty logic or just straight up you talking out of your ass, I'm done here"
kevin durant keeps dming me on instagram asking for my credit card number? should i give it to him?
"theres a difference between telling me why I'm wrong and just straight up ignoring things I've already said  &gt;Larry bird has been the clear cut best player in 3 chips. Curry has been the best player on 1 chip.  like i said, If Bird had KD on his team, he wouldn't have been the clear cut best... and if Steph had Bird’s team he would have been the clear cut best... “strength of teammates” seems like a very weird and arbitrary thing to rate a player on. How good a particular teammate is/was doesn’t really have anything to do with comparing players  &gt;Larry bird is the leader of his team, and is better in clutch situations, and unequivocally the best player on his team. You don’t hear about the fact that durant is better than curry, or about how curry is the producer but draymond is the heart or any of that shit. Larry is all that.  again,  If Bird had KD, Dray, and Klay on his team, he wouldn't have been the clear cut best... and if Steph had Bird’s team he would have been the clear cut best... “strength of teammates” seems like a very weird and arbitrary thing to rate a player on. How good a particular teammate is/was doesn’t really have anything to do with comparing players  And you're also wrong, Kevin McHale outscored and outrebonded Bird in the 1985 NBA finals and his 1987 finals was worse than any of Steph's finals performances. Bro, you're just talking out of your ass  &gt;Larry birds career totals as a whole are better than Curry’s. 24, 10 and 6 &gt; 24, 4, 7.  lol you can't compare career totals when one player is still in his prime... obv Steph's numbers are gonna go up  &gt;“But curry has a higher FG pct inside.” Ya cause he’s there much less.   &gt;   &gt;He also has a better midrange.  show me these percentages your citing. Show where it says that Bird has a better midrange FG% and took more shots in the paint, or are you just talking out of your ass again ?  &gt;If u need a bucket u have a better chance w bird. Why? Because bird has way more tools in his arsenal. Same w kobe. Compare pcts all u want but in clutch moments, curry is running around a pick to shoot a 3 no matter what and u can exploit that which is why he missed key 3s in the 2016 playoffs and the 2019 playoffs. W someone like Kobe or bird, they can literally get a bucket wayyy easier and u never know what their gonna do.  but Steph has a higher TS% and eFG% than both of those players... again show where Steph has a lower efficiency in the clutch, or are you AGAIN just talking out of your ass ?  there are no need for advanced stats: Steph was more efficient, scored more in their primes, attracted way more defensive attention (Bird doesn't get doubled and blitzed nearly as much as steph and certainly never got box and one'd... you're just wrong bud  &amp;#x200B;  You also have just completely ignored my point that: ""again, you're basically just repeating all the dumb stuff talking heads like kellerman or cowherd have been saying, and you don't sound like someone who actually watches the games. again, Steph’s previous 3 finals wins he averaged 26/6/6... all other players with that stat line won FMVP... you saying Steph has a history of being “significantly worse” kinda juss shows me that you don’t watch the games.

And Kawhi literally called Kevin Durant to see if he wanted to play together. That's how this shit works now.
In an attempt to try and see it from *his* perspective:  LeBron has never been on a team that would be legitimate contenders without him.  Maybe he thinks a super team is a team like the Warriors where they're still a finals contender even without Kevin Durant

That tweet was satire. https://uproxx.com/dimemag/steve-ballmer-crying-kevin-durant-clippers-free-agency/  Scroll to the bottom
&gt; Kevin Durant (the servant)  Don't you mean the serpent?
"They've never managed ""this nonsense"". They've always gone for the big name free agent, or made bonehead trades for big name players. Steve Francis, Antonio Mcdyess, Stephon Marbury, Eddy Curry, Melo, the list goes on. In the last 20 years the Knicks haven't drafted good talent, and then allowed them to develop with strong team culture.   You can lack faith in the other guys, I don't expect anyone to think they're good. I've always hated the feeling NBA fans have towards players that enter the league extremely young but don't play like superstars from the get go. Guys like Pascal Siakam were playing well in tier 2 schools, sent off to the G-League, and didn't score double digits until this year. People look at him and don't bat an eye, even though it took him until age 25 to get his shit together. Steph Curry played 3 years at Davidson, and while he was productive in his first 2 years he was still the guy behind Monta. He was injured in his 3rd year, signed an extension that many fans were upset with at the time, and became a star the year after at age 24. Even if Steph was amazing at Davidson, if he was as good as people like to say with the power of hindsight, he would have been drafted #1. Knox comes into the league as the second youngest rookie, and while he wasn't efficient, he was rookie of the month in December and finished the season strong as a 19 year old. Apparently he's trash with no potential. Now of course not every player is given the opportunity to grind and pan out, but this idea that if you're not producing as a 19 year old you're hopeless is stupid. The front office is happy with his development, and he only took like a week or two off after the season ended and has been with Fizdale in the gym a ton since.     The thing about the next free agency is that the young players the Knicks have now will likely still be on the tea, but with 2 years of experience under their belt. We'll have a better idea as to whether they're suitable NBA products by then, which should hopefully draw free agents. How did the Warriors end 30 years of mediocrity? Did Steph/Klay/Draymond/Barnes/Ezeli join the team in Free Agency? The FO drafted those guys and made smart trades/FA signings for contributors that could build a winning culture. This made them an attractive spot for S tier free agents like Kevin Durant. This is what the Knicks are trying to emulate. With the power of hindsight you can say of course this Knicks roster is nowhere near as good as the Warriors, but considering no one expected the Warriors to win in 2015 the way they did, I think it's likely that the fans are far too concerned with the present output of players and don't like looking into the future if it's not a sure thing. The chance of this working out for the Knicks like it did for the Warriors is obviously low, but what is the alternative strategy? With the lottery odds flattening out the way they did, the players won't learn anything playing another consecutive year of losing basketball. You could be like the Suns who straight tanked while letting their players develop but dropped a ton of spots in the lottery. With the adjusted odds, you get more bang for your buck letting your young guys develop with productive players around them.    The only other alternative for the FO this offseason was to take in bad contracts for picks. Everyone acts like you can go to the bad contract tree, get a bunch of short term expiring players for a lot of money and expect some stupid FO to give you free picks. The only salary dump+pick we've seen this offseason yielded Memphis a heavily protected pick for Igoudala. Are we really going to pretend that waiting in Free Agency for some team to maybe give you a pick in the 20's is better than signing productive players to extremely team friendly deals to help your young players develop?"

"I'd rather face the 2018 Celtics with no Kyrie or Hayward than the 2018 Rockets with James Harden, Chris Paul and a great supporting cast.  I'd rather face the 2017 Celtics with Isaiah Thomas  than the 2017 Spurs with Kawhi Leonard and Gregg Popovich.  I'd rather face the 2016 Celtics with Isaiah Thomas than the 2016 OKC Thunder with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.  Like I said, he's always been a great player but he most likely loses when he faces a great team with higher team IQ."
KD as in kevin durant? The guy who's calf isn't attached to his heel?
Your dad gives you $5 to sign Kevin Durant and only Kevin Durant. But Kevin Durant wants to go somewhere else for $4. So instead you pay Kevin Durant $4 and trade him to the other team so you get back Russell. You technically didn't break any rules because you signed Kevin Durant using your dad's money.

I think guys should do whatever they want. As long as they aren’t hurting anyone.  I don’t like the lack of parity in the league. But honestly, I dunno what you do about that. It’s a problem in every sports league."
"Sure.  Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden."
"Lmfaooo   What did Kevin Durant do, then? Jumped onto the other ship"
"&gt;Lakers have the two best players in the league  kevin durant is a brooklyn net  &gt;the fourth best player in AD  giannis, harden, steph, lebron, kawhi, kd &gt; ad  you could maybe argue one or two of those above him. but 4th? na"
&gt;Kevin Durant (GSW)
"The Cavs right before LeBron left were good and well built around his skillset, but they were overpowered against teams that had more than one star and those guys got exposed in the Playoffs, and Mo Williams was a very borderline All Star to begin with.  The Cavs after LeBron came back and Kyrie left were constructed horribly with a lot of really bad contracts on the team anchoring them. Their second All Star Kevin Love was also pretty injured and no longer as effective as he once was. The Warriors were also a tough opponent with Durant and Curry."
Kevin Durant fucked over the fans of 28 American teams on America day 3 years ago.
Sign and trade. He signed a max and was technically traded for Kevin Durant.
The Warriors are a family  Kevin Durant just ended up being the bitter step child
Yes because Joe Lacob pressured him and Kevin Durant into playing even though they were injured. And then he got rid of Chelsea Lane for trying  o protect the players. So Brickuodala has reason to seek revenge against the Warriors.
Kobe Bryant was older when he got hurt and was not nearly as efficient as Kevin Durant is.
"Nah, you're wrong:  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/6/28/12050498/kevin-durant-contract-salary-money-nba-free-agent-rumors  ""Durant's maximum salary in 2016-17 will be $26.6 million no matter what, but the numbers start changing the following years depending on the contract he signs. If Durant were to sign a full maximum contract in Oklahoma City, he's locked in to 7.5 percent raises each year for the duration of a five-year contract. That works out to $153 million total over five years. If he signed a long-term deal elsewhere this summer, he stands to make a maximum of about $114 million over four years. Per NBA rules, other teams cannot give out five-year deals and the annual raises between years can only be for a maximum of 4.5 percent.""   https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html#all_salaries::none  He took $26.6mil with the Warriors in 2016, which is the max he could get. So nope, KD did not take less than the potential max in order to join the Warriors. If you were paying attention in 2016, the news was all about how the Warriors had cap space for a max salary, and if they didn't get KD they'd have to max Harrison Barnes.   Curry getting $12mil a year in 2016 is correct but that's not anyone's fault, lol."
"""Fuck the Knicks"" -Kevin Durant"
"There is a book called the Alchemist that I am sure Kevin Durant has read. I would bet money on it.  Here is the main quote from the book.   And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”"

is the source kevin durant?
Steph Curry - 6x all star Klay Thompson - 5x all star Kevin Durant - 10x all star Draymond Green - 3x all star DeMarcus Cousins - 4x all star  That clear everything up or?
"No one is getting this simple point. The 2016 warriors are one of the greatest teams of all time, added Kevin Durant on top of that and cruised to three more finals appearances. But sure this hypothetical team with a big 3 who have never played together and have no supporting cast is worse."
"If I’m not mistaken, KD and his camp agreed to make it a trade instead of [just signing with the Nets](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2019/07/01/dangelo-russell-warriors-nets-trade-kevin-durant-nba-free-agency)."
Say what you want I’m sure the warriors ARE thankful but this is a legacy move. One day a long time from now ppl will look up and all they’ll know is Kevin Durant was once a warrior...
Kevin Durant joined an already fully formed 73 win team. It was the equivalent of if Barkley joined the 96 Bulls. Nothing will ever be worse.

I doubt they land another player like Kevin Durant again
"it will surely be talked about for generations.   a controversial move that created possibly the greatest team of all time, during what was already a crazy rivalry between lebron james and the warriors.   future generations will be amazed at this team, and we can say we were there. fuck you kevin durant, but thanks for the basketball"
The source: Kevin Durant
"Yeah, the wording is too strange. No one will never wear that number why I’m here is different than the Warriors are retiring 35 for Kevin Durant and putting the number in the rafters. I don’t take this owners off-hand comment to mean the organization is legit renting the number forever."
The Warriors dynasty is the weakest dynasty of all time. Built on crying to Kevin Durant in the parking lot and lucking out with other team’s star players getting injured in the playoffs
"Bruh... You added Kevin Durant to your team, and you want to be the one here who says ""fuck  so and so for going to that team""?  &amp;#x200B;  Not a good look lol."
Was it the media putting Kevin Durant photos in your season ticket promo materials too?
"Kevin Durant and Charmin, charminpartner would've made perfect business sense, I don't know why he doesn't have an endorsement with them."
"According to [this article](https://nypost.com/2019/07/01/the-bad-joke-that-helped-push-kevin-durant-away-from-warriors/), the abuse was a joke the GM said:  &gt;During the Warriors’ championship parade ceremony last season, general manager Bob Myers tried a joke about Durant’s contract situation that didn’t land. Myers and Steve Kerr were standing alongside television play-by-play man Bob Fitzgerald.  &gt;“I heard you tell Kevin Durant he could have whatever contract he wants next year,” Fitzgerald said to Myers.  &gt;“That was just for the media. He can’t have anything like that at all,” Myers said. Kerr interjected: “Mid-level.”  &gt;“I think last year you told Steph (Curry) he could have any contract he wants, too,” Fitzgerald said.  &gt;“Yeah, that was different. He’s been here from the way-before days. He’s earned it,” Myers replied. Awkwardness ensued. Curry looked at Durant, who tried to laugh it off but clearly wasn’t amused by what was happening."
"you guys are delusional as fuck man. Kevin Durant is gonna come back and this nets team is gonna run the east. this is the 2nd best player of this generation, behind only Lebron fucking James man. this team is stacked from top to bottom. Kyrie, KD, DJ, Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, LaVert, Jarrett Allen? that's honestly the most well rounded team in the league with another couple signings."
"Well they did pass up on Michael Jordan, and then Kevin Durant, both times to draft players who had zero success. I live in Portland, and I'm not ready to stop shaming them. However, I'm pretty excited about this season."
"Yeah, it's on Bob Myers, but also on Joe Lacob for having the stomach to go into the lux tax line in a repeater year for a player that isn't Kevin Durant on the shot that it might work.  I don't think Presti had that flexibility nor did the Warriors have any allstars to part with."
Every account is Kevin Durant except for you
Kevin Durant world be that weird shark fucker
"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D-aiTtSUcAAl74i.jpg:large  Golden State Warriors Co-Chairman and CEO Joe Lacob released the following statement on Monday:  “Three years ago, we were thrilled with the arrival of Kevin Durant, a transformative NBA player and one of the best to ever play the game. He provided our fans and franchise with numerous highlights during his stay here—two NBA championships, two NBA Finals MVPs, three trips to the Finals, unparalleled efficiency—and carried himself with class and dignity both on and off the court.  ""His commitment to our community was evident each day, including last season when his philanthropic efforts earned him the NBA’s annual Community Assist Award. Today, as he starts a new chapter in his incredible career, we thank KD for all of his contributions, for being an integral part to one of the most prolific runs in NBA history and wish him well as he continues his Hall of Fame journey. As long as I am Co-Chairman of this team, no player will ever wear #35 for the Warriors again.”"
The Michael Jordan hanging jumper truly was something. To me only Kevin Durant today has a similarly deadly turnaround.
"Kind of puts the new Kevin Durant max deal in perspective, doesn't it? The Nets technically gave away any chances of winning a chip for the next few years."
If I'm Kevin Durant I'm taking my time (obviously working hard to rehab) but nonetheless I'm taking my time.   No need to reinjure or overcompensate.  Klay as well.
I'll have you know I've been a basketball fan since Kevin Durant was drafted by the warriors
"Why? At least, Jimmy Butler is an great 2-way player with both Achilles tendon intact. Kevin Durant will be 32 years old when he returns, an age where most players are in decline. And he'll be a net-negative on defense and won't blow away people on isos like he once could."
"If you’re gonna be petty, it is *literally exactly* what happened to Kevin Durant. That’s what my comment said."
"2010 actually was really similar. The 2008 Olympic team won gold and [basically everyone from that team dropped out from the 2010 World Cup](https://www.espn.com/olympics/olybb/news/story?id=5372600):  &gt; As recently as four months ago, Colangelo was expecting at least seven of his eight core players from Beijing to return, and for Kevin Durant to slip into whichever spot was vacant.  &gt; But Deron Williams declined his invitation Saturday night, joining LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony in withdrawing. Also, Tayshaun Prince and Carlos Boozer, the 11th and 12th players on the depth chart in Beijing, have withdrawn, too. All of those players either cited injuries, family commitments or the effects of their hectic free-agency recruiting period.  That 2010 team ended up going 9-0 and the roster was pretty much entirely comprised of super young guys -- Russ, Rose, Steph, Durant, Love and Eric Gordon were all on the team and had played 3 or fewer years in the NBA by that point.  So it's absolutely not unprecedented. It's just not ideal to have 10-15 really, really good players simply choose not to play."
"No team would ever say no to Kevin Durant if he was like, ""Yo, can I come play with you guys?""  If they did they deserve to lose their team and relocate."

All things are possible thru Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant: “Under 7 feet” like Kevin Garnett with the right Achilles of Dominique Wilkins
"Lol you Warriors fans are in such denial.  D’Lo is still somewhat of a project—yes he was an injury replacement for the All-Star team but he has played average to above average for one season in his pro career and then stunk up the playoffs.  Guys can put up good regular season numbers because defenses aren’t as intense.  He’s 2 years away from being a good playoff player.  Put it this way; **GS traded Kevin Durant, Andre Igouldala, and 2 first round picks for D’Angelo Russell** ya’ll need 2 solid players and then GS is back up there with the Clippers.  I’m not looking forward to D’Lo vs PG/Kawhi/Beverly if I were a GS fan he would get annihilated on defense and it would be the Philly series all over again."
"I’m not about to go to Kevin Durant &amp; say “Hey Kevin, can I take a shit?”"
He just needs to not get approval from Kevin Durant
"Kelvin Benjamin tells me he’s totally fine KD didn’t talk to him about going to the Nets; “I'm not about to go to Kevin Durant &amp; say, ‘Hey, Kevin, can I make it to TWO all you can eat buffets this afternoon?’” “It’s my life. Am I supposed to come to you and, A, let you know, Or B, ask you for permission? No.”"
"In hindsight was this really *that* bad?  We were out of the playoffs for only three years, and now we have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the team.  I honestly think we'd be in a worse position right now if the trade didn't happen, mainly because Billy King probably wouldn't have been fired so quickly."
ESPN: *Kevin Durant reportedly 'furious' that Draymond got his fiancé pregnant*
"Draymond: Yo Kevin, can I get my fiance pregnant?  Durant: Nah, gotta wait til marriage Dray"
ESPN: Kevin Durant reportedly “gave permission” for Draymond Green to impregnate his own fiancée.
"Yeah. In my opinion ball movement and off ball screen action has become a bit overrated.   At the end of the day a Kevin Durant iso or pnr is the best play you can run against a strong half court defense and if you can consistently beat your man posting up, that shit is gold when everybody's chasing shooters a little bit faster and moving a little more intellegently.  Duncan posting up would still be unstoppable today."
"They had steph curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  True story"
"&gt;As it turns out, though, there is one person who disagrees. His name is Kevin Durant."
"Jesus fucking Christ we had *Kevin Durant*. HAHAHA that shit was so unfair and we were all over here acting like ""hey it's a free country nbd"" but secretly trying to hide our tiny erections for three full season."
His skill set already looks like Kevin Durant. But 2022 is an mighty long time. Let’s see the kids development.
When i’m talking to women i’m Kevin Durant. Still works.
It's Kevin fucking Durant. He can just get his assistant to PM Instathots.
"PG - Steph Curry  - 75"" or 6'3  SG - Michael Jordan - 78"" or 6'6  SF - LeBron James - 80"" or 6'8  PF - Kevin Durant - 81” or 6’9  C - Karl Malone - 81” or 6’9"
Probably easier if you're also named Kevin Durant.
"He would be weak compared to most modern guards. The 3 ball is an era thing and you coukd argue he might learn that, but there is no way around height and size.   Kevin Durant destroyed Jrue Holiday due to his size. He would easily back him down and shoot over him. It was easy. And KD isn't known for his strength.   Muggsy could be strong for his size but get wrecked by 6 foot tall ""small guards"".   His only advantage is speed and that only gets you so far."
"Lebron James , Magic Johnson, James Jones , Steve Kerr , Kevin Durant"
"I wanted to believe but theres also a dude who responded to that tweet with an equally realistic looking screenshot of adam silver's number texting him back with ""fuck Kevin Durant"" so now I dont trust anyone lol"
Isaiah Thomas - 6’1” or 73” Kobe Bryant - 6’6” or 78” Kawhi Leonard - 6’7” or 79” Kevin Durant - 6’9 or 81” Hakeem - 7’0 or 84”  Yeah we all know KD ain’t 6’9

"Skinny enough to make Kevin Durant look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, to be exact."
LOL. Glenn Robinson and Sam Cassell versus Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (and Kevin Durant for 3 years). Yeah.      Idiot.
Beta answer.  Proper response is “I’m KEVIN DURANT”.
"KD was torching everyone after his “I’m Kevin Durant” quote lol, he was the best player in the playoffs by miles"
"yes, i am aware. but once again: it's pretty obvious that he's saying that kevin durant has the scoring ability of a shooting guard while being a 7 footer -- a bit of a rarity. not that kevin durant is a LITERAL shooting guard. pls try to use ur brain"
it's pretty obvious that he's saying that kevin durant has the scoring ability of a shooting guard while being a 7 footer -- a bit of a rarity
"i haven’t watched many men love in person, but I always knew after the whole Scarlett Johansson’s bathwater thing that Kevin Durant was a unique player."
Kevin Durant would literally not be able to dribble
KD deleted his account for a period of time and he doesn’t have his account under the name “Kevin Durant” he only has the username “easymoneysniper”
I posted this thread before but just as a fyi he's one of the two players that I can found who outscore Lebron in H2H match ups.  The other player is Kevin Durant.
"FG% in the playoffs, 4th Q or OT, 2:00 or less, score within 5 points:    Player | FG/FGA | FG% ---|---|---- Kevin Durant | 11/29 | 37.9% LeBron James | 34/98 | 34.7% Kyrie Irving | 4/13 | 30.8% Damian Lillard | 3/15 | 20.0%"
"""he's a idiot""-Kevin Durant."
I am a fan of Kevin Durant
"&gt;thought out and inspired  &gt;outline of aesthetically unpleasing state with marker for city  Pick one  The pistons throwback is a throwback to when they were bad and between title teams- don’t know why they’d want to evoke that  The hawks have one of the few unique color schemes, and you’ve changed that to red white and blue, which is way too common and was barely used by them. The jerseys also look like versions of the pistons jerseys. Even if it was an old design, no one thinks of the hawks like that.  The Celtics have had practically the same design for 75 years but you’ve changed that and given them a black for blacks sake alternate and a tacky all gold alternate  The red pinstripes on the bulls jersey is just adding something for the sake of change, but the white flag jersey looks fine, not sure what the blue one is though  The warriors city jersey is the color of a babies bedroom, not a basketball jersey  Not sure how trees pay homage to Kevin Garnett when the wolves had that tree logo for another decade after he left the team (not terrible jerseys though)  The knicks jerseys look like Tetris blocks  The Magic’s orange jerseys look like Phoenix suns jerseys  The Sixers play in Philadelphia, they’re one of the teams that should be using red, white, and blue, not black and cream  The raptors having their alternates be based on one person that has to cover up his kevin Durant tattoos during the finals seems questionable   The wizards flag jersey would look fine on a national soccer team, where you don’t need a logo to know they’re Americans, but dumping that logo right over the stripes looks terrible. The other two are fine, because they’re just updated designs. The black Jordan one reminds me more of losing to the cavs in the first round, Javaris Crittenton, and general pre-Ted Leonsis incompetence than it does the 2 years Michael Jordan played for the wizards where they missed the playoffs.  The Kings should stick to the purple and black  Portland uniforms shouldn’t have the under armour logo on them, when they’re Nike uniforms and Nike is based in Portland  The thunder uni’s I like, but the word Thunder is hard to read when not moving, and would look even worse when the players are moving around  I like the Grizzlies ones with Memphis written out, but I assume the ones with collar markings are Native American inspired, which doesn’t make much sense for Memphis   I like all of the Nets, hornets, nuggets, heat, and Mavs minus the state outlines. The rest you either only slightly updated or I’m indifferent towards"
"&gt; he actually plays in a system now and not just iso ball each time   Kevin Durant actually iso'd [more frequently](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/?SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;sort=POSS&amp;dir=1) the last two playoffs in GS than he did in OKC. The difference is that these iso plays are against worse defenders because he can switch without drawing double teams as frequently, because the defensive attention is focused on stopping Curry and Klay. I highly recommend rewatching the 2017 and (especially) 2018 Finals for a look at this - notice how many times KD gets a switch onto Hill, Smith, Clarkson, etc. and is able to take an easy mid range jumper or shot out of the post. The defense basically concedes these shots in hopes that they can stop the rest of the GS offense."
"In a years time:  “The last time Kevin Durant played, Kawhi was on the Raptors, Paul George &amp; Westbrook we’re both on the Thunder and Kevin Durant was at Golden State”"
Obviously his scoring would go down if he’s playing with Kevin fucking Durant. Coaches adapt to players playing styles not the other way around
"i could look you in the eye and say he's average. Can he check Paul George or Kevin Durant? No, but most players can't. I'm not out here saying he's a DPOY snub he's just not bad. His defense actually looked a lot better under Pop. Also he's only been under Pop for one season so the 2 seasons prior is an entirely different offensive and defensive situation. All I'm trying to say is he's a decent defender and a good offensive player. He carried us through more than a few cold stretches against the Nuggets where we desperately needed a bucket and he's the only real reason we were close in game 7."
His next take is gonna be about how Kevin Durant is black.
"Anyways where did this narrative come from that Kevin Durant ""couldn't handle"" anything on OKC?  2010 - wins 50 games with Infants, scoring title  2011 - makes WCF with Babies, scoring title  2012 - makes NBA Finals with Toddlers, scoring title  2013 - Harden traded, 9.15 SRS team, 50-40-90 season, Westbrook tears his knee, wins a round anyways and loses in WCSF  2014 - Westbrook misses half the year, Durant wins MVP and scoring title, Westbrook comes back, Western Conference Finals,   2015 - Durant goes down, Thunder miss Playoffs  2016 - Western Conference Finals Game 7 against a team that won 73 games."
"I did some research on the three-point shooting percentages of OKC Thunder minus Westbrook and Durant/George, and the collective shooting percentages of the OKC Thunder supporting cast has usually been really poor.  The only year the OKC Thunder supporting cast had good shooting percentages was in 2012-13 when they had Kevin Martin."
"&gt; Kevin Durant, as good as he is, couldn't handle the bad spacing OKC.  Four scoring titles and a League MVP suggests otherwise"
"Did you know...the last time Christiano Felicio played in an NBA game, Russell Westbrook was on the Thunder, Kevin Durant was on the Warriors, and Kyrie Irving was on the Celtics."
"they have to see if they can both activate though, the only person that i seen actually activating was kevin durant"
"Kevin Durant still iso-ed plenty on the Warriors. The difference between OKC and the Warriors is that the Warriors have better spacing.  When KD iso's, tries to get to the rim, he doesn't see a fat wall stopping him from scoring. When he iso's, its literally a 1-on-1 situation when he was on the Warriors, as opposed to 1-on-2 or 1-on-3 on OKC."
Kevin Durant started in the nba at age 19. Same age as Lebron.   KD at age 24 was 6 seasons in  Lebron at age 24 was 6 seasons in

"DAE Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook"
"I’d rather build around 1 player, so how about, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, and Brook Lopez. This team surrounds Lebron with a ridiculous amount of spacing while having another put the ball in his hands to get a bucket, in KD, obviously Steph and Klay are 2 top 3 shooters of all time, and Lopez is the best real center that can guard 5’s and splash 3’s at an elite clip"
Ask Kevin Durant if Having a bachelors degree guarantees a person won’t rip you off.
"i genuinely can’t take this seriously if you’re honest to god putting Toronto in front of Brooklyn. Brooklyn retained a foundation that got it 6th seed @ 42 wins and upgraded key spots to Kyrie and DeJ, with Kevin fucking Durant coming back the next season. and don’t ever get it twisted, even a hobbled KD is better than **anyone** in this conference that’s not named Giannis. that team is good now, and could kill the conference in a year and some if they managed to retain their core outside of LeVert. meanwhile, you know Kawhis out, right? Kyle/VV/MG are barely enough to grab a bottom 4 seeding, they shouldn’t be mentioned in this lmao. but speaking of Toronto... not many, shit if any, said they’d make it past a far more stacked than now MIL and Philly last season. remind me how that turned out again?   you can have your opinion on who you think will compete or who will fill the top 4 in the east, but you’d be a straight fool if you didn’t believe for a second that a team with a playoff-capable core who upgraded DLo/Joe Harris/Jarrett Allen with Kyrie/KD/DeJ (while STILL RETAINING Harris and Allen) could keep up with the rest. hell, you’d genuinely be an idiot.   but the r/NBA circlejerk must go on, i guess. 🤦🏽‍♂️"
Mate have you even watched any other players like Kevin Durant and Lebron James?
"What...he punched Steve Kerr in the face. Imagine the reaction if Kevin Durant punched Quin Cook in the face. He ruined Kwame Brown's career with homophobic insults that would turn progressives against him. He publicly admitted to statpadding like Westbrook for MVP. He publicly criticized his teammates, blamed them for his turnovers, said ownership needs to do a better job getting better players and trading away the bad ones etc."
"I wasn't sure what to do at first, but I decided to combine the two because the NBA combines the history of the two franchises. If I had to do them separately, this is what I would do and I understand why you would do that  **All-Time Sonics:**  |Position|1|2|3|4| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |PG|Gary Payton|Gus Williams|Lenny Wilkens|| |SG|Ray Allen|Dennis Johnson|Fred Brown|| |SF|Detlef Schrempf|Dale Ellis|Xavier McDaniel|| |PF|Shawn Kemp|Spencer Haywood|Rashard Lewis|Tom Chambers| |C|Jack Sikma|Bob Rule|||  **All-Time Thunder:**  |Position|1|2|3| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |PG|Russell Westbrook|James Harden|Reggie Jackson| |SG|Paul George|Andre Roberson|Kevin Martin| |SF|Kevin Durant|Thabo Sefalosha|Anthony Morrow| |PF|Serge Ibaka|Jeff Green|Jerami Grant| |C|Steven Adams|Nick Collison|Enes Kanter|"
"I am high on this guy. He is Japanese after all, so probably a bit more mature and disciplined than most American counter parts. It may sound racist and all but there is a lot of immaturity in the NBA and even with MVPs. Just look at James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook who have all shown immaturity. I think Lebron, Septh, Giannis are the mature ones but then, even they act up once in while. Of all the superstars I can think of Kawhi, is the most mature and he and Rui share a lot of Similarities."

"A +5% to relative league TS% seems to designate entirely elite scoring efficiency. If take the current league of  .560 you'd get .610 which only 20 players accomplished.  Of those twenty players 13 are bigs. Which makes sense, rim running and lob catching are high efficiency plays. If you can hit your big for an easy shot in the post it's going to be easier points than probably any shot that's not an open 3, which is likely harder to generate.   What's interesting is the 7 players who are not bigs. You get Joe Harris, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Danilo Gallinari, James Harden, DJ Augustin and Kawhi Leonard. Everyone knows these guys are good shooters, and the stat confirms that. It also recontextualizes scorers such as Steph, Harden, Kawhi, and Durant. These guys don't only score *a lot* of points, they do it on great efficieny. Notice how these four players, including Giannis who isn't a shooter but is an efficient volume scorer, all have arguments to be in the Top 5.  If we allow ourselves to round up to .610 we can also add Malcolm Brogdon, Jeff Green, DeAndre Ayton, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Danny Green. At .603 you get Pascal Siakam and JJ Reddick.  All these players are guys that the eye test finds striking, the stat merely confirms it. For cross era analysis adjust TS% to the league average and find the differential, you won't be surprised who you find."
"My grandfather said Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard would’ve dominated the 1970’s if they played in that era. He said that small forwards weren’t nearly as athletic as they are now (except for Dr J) and none of them would be able to guard any shots off the dribble or 3s by them."
Kevin Durant and Joey Badass
Ratings are such a dumb thing to cite.  The nba has grown a ton since the Warriors came into power mostly because of social media.  No one was excited to watch the 2017 and 2018 finals except Warriors fans and this last finals would have been a snoozefest if Kevin Durant didn't go down in the rockets series.  No one actually wanted to see a team go 16-1 on the way to the finals with a bunch of blowouts except for that team's fanbase.  I know it's hard to remove yourself from the situation since you are a warriors fan but there was a ton of burnout after 2018.
I guarantee Dr. J affected basketball way more than Kevin Durant ever has or will
"http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/  There's a good breakdown of his defense here. It's definitely vastly overrated by people now whk just look at his length and imagine he's very effective (or worse, always has been)."

"I watched him in his final season on television. This was back when you couldn't see every game. My Trail Blazers were in their third year of contention, destined to get back to the Finals. He was in the midst of his back pain saga, and Clyde Drexler was lighting it up, but Larry was unstoppable. He was hitting ridiculous shots like Kobe, and he put the game into overtime. He ended up scoring almost 50 points and getting a triple double.  The last memory I have of him playing was on the Dream Team, and they were annihilating some poor opponent. It might have been the first game of the Tournament of the Americas before they went off to play in the Olympics. They were clearly winning, but he still chased down a ball going out of bounds and he grabbed it with his right hand and scooped a no look pass around his back from half court to Michael who was waiting in along the sideline in scoring position. Michael was the best player I ever saw, but Larry to me was clearly scarier than Kevin Durant."

"I think the best example of that hypocrisy is this   &gt; Kerr added: “Unarmed black people are being killed indiscriminately around the country. And that’s what happened two days ago. That’s the message. That’s what matters. The other stuff you can talk about all day. Nobody is right. Nobody is wrong.  &gt;“But that matters. **Everyone should be trying to do something, whatever is in their power, to help in that regard.”**  &gt;Forward Kevin Durant told reporters last week in Austin, Texas, that he was **“behind anyone who stands up for what they believe in.”**  &gt; Kerr plans to support his team’s players in their views as long as their message on injustice is “clear.”  &gt;“Our guys have been asked a lot about it and they’ve done a great job responding,” Kerr said. “**It’s a tricky topic. Not the Kaepernick situation, but social activism in general. It has to come from the heart. There are a lot of fans out there that say, ‘Stick to sports. We’re trying to get away from this by watching your team play.’ “I understand that. On the other hand, these guys have a voice. In my mind, as long as the message is clear, I’m all for people speaking out against injustice no matter what form that takes.** If it’s nonviolent and leads to conversation, then I think that’s beautiful.”"

"Karl-Anthony Towns, the gasol brothers, Yao ming and maybe Derrick rose, Brandon Roy, Demarcus Cousins (assuming we are talking players at their peaks), Howard, wade, LeBron, maybe igoudala, Durant, Kevin Love, Harden, Curry, John wall, Paul George, Kay Thompson Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic.

It's definitely a silly talking point by now. KD has said Kawhi is not a system player   https://youtu.be/LYfND45juV4?t=20    He didn't take previous comments back from 2014 because they made reasonable sense in the context of the time.   https://www.espn.com/blog/okc-thunder/post/_/id/1349/kevin-durant-isnt-taking-back-what-he-said-about-kawhi-leonard-three-years-ago

Bullshit. You sound like a hater. Kevin Durant never relied on athleticism. He’s 7 foot with a shot like butter. If it was someone like Westbrook then I’d understand. KD will come back and basically be like Dirk. People watch basketball to see talented players ball out. And that’s what Kyrie and KD do. I love Adams but ppl are not watching for him if they did he’d be just as popular to the casual fan as KD/kyrie but he’s not
"Here is where we disagree, I think this is a human rights issue. Granted it is caused by politicians, so people will justify censorship based on ""no politics"" but than where do we stop?

Or in modern times people like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Enes Kaner, when they spoke out against human rights violations and oppressive regimes of Trump and Erdogan?"

"Yeah i mean, complete means complete, not elite.  He can be mega elite without being able to shoot the ball well.

Even greats like Kobe were not complete, he couldnt or at least didnt rebound.  Shaq couldnt shoot free throws,"
"Rose definitely doesn’t need to play significant minutes. These aren’t just normal players, these are the best of the best and they consistently play 35+ minutes a night in the playoffs.  There are 48*5 (240) minutes in a game. In the 2018-19 playoffs these were their mpg averages: Russell Westbrook 39.4 Steph Curry 38.5 James Harden 38.5 Kevin Durant 36.8 Giannis Antetokounmpo 34.3  That’s a total of 187.5 minutes. That leaves 52.5 minutes for Lebron and Rose to split. In the 2017-18 playoffs Lebron averaged 41.9 minutes a game. Take that away and all you need from Rose is 10.6 minutes a game"

"If.   It can be one of the reasons. I name a whole other plenthora of reason why people wouldn't like KD. You singled out that one in that paragraph I just gave you. KD wants to wax his whole narrative on the truth, even his clapbacks are not the truth and only to come back admit, the initial criticism is correct. See Shannon Sharpe/KD debacle.  or the time where a writer said the same thing shannon sharpe said and he went up to the reporter and told him he doesn't know him like that to even mention a statement like that.   It was the writers opinion.  https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/02/you-dont-know-me-like-that-kevin-durant-the-warriors-and-a-toxic-locker-room/  later on, Kevin durant fully admits he didn't feel beloved as steph or the people taht was drafted there."

"Is this Kevin ""the hardest road"" Durant talking. The chump that left a great playoff team to join a 73 win team to get his first chip? The same KD that's had a million burner accounts to talk smack cause of his thin skin?   I'd argue the contrary...a real star would wanna join the Knicks to make them good. Then that player would definitely be a legend. KD isn't up to the task. He's soft."
Maybe this is why Kevin Durant has no friends
"&gt;They get endorsements from other companies to put their name and face with their shit and the number of companies and the size of those contracts definitely change with the market  For most players yeah, I just don't think that's true for Kevin Durant. It doesn't matter what market he is in, companies will throw money at him in a bidding war to get him as brand ambassador/for ads/whatever. Once you get to a certain level, companies just pay anything to have you.   &gt;IIRC even the shoe deals have bonuses in their contracts for playing in certain markets (LA, NYK and CHI)  Completely dependent on case by case basis for each contract. I've no idea what KDs would have in it, those aren't public knowledge.  But basically, I think KD I'd so famous/successful that he transcends market. Just look at LeBron, he signed a $1billion Nike shoe deal while playing for Cleveland. Once you're famous enough, the market doesn't matter."
"Another exhibit as to why Kevin Durant is a bitch. He'd rather follow the preconceptions about what teams are cool than make a team cool by himself. A team in New York city, at that."
"Kevin Durant doesn't need that though. He's already situated in New York regardless, and playing for the Knicks isn't going to change anything about his name recognition because he's Kevin Durant.  He'll get whatever deals he wants regardless of the team, he's already massive. Especially considering he just spent 3 years in the Bay with all those tech contacts."
Kevin Durant better hope the Brooklyn Nets are actually good.  Or this is all going to look ridiculous on him.  I also must have missed all the winning the Nets have been doing for the past 25 years.
You act as if there was a better alternative. They can’t just go to the MVP caliber player store to get non-injured Kevin Durant.
There was also that part where we signed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"Kevin Durant and the Toronto fans. Game 5, as he exited the court and we chanted his name.  One of the best sportsmanship moments ever."

"As a Nets fan, I found his letter to be outrageous and horrifying at the same time.   I personally feel this letter was about practicing and showing the world the extent of China’s power and influence. China is not shy to using sporting and other multi-cultural events to flex on other countries (see olympics.) Two things are very apparent from what happened:  1.) China was completely successful in using its economic prowess to silence big organizations and companies in other countries. Which, if you’re in the group of people who strongly believe that big companies are on the verge (or already there) of pretty much controlling whole governments — this is completely terrifying. (If companies control governments, and China has a firm influence on companies -&gt; what does this lead to?)  2.) This event also highlighted one of America’s biggest issues, it’s people. We live in a time where the American people are too poor, too exhausted, and just downright too self-involved to really pay attention to the political world — both nationally and internationally. I’m honestly under the impression that at this rate, tragedy could strike us and we wouldn’t even attempt to do anything about it until it’s too late.   But I get to watch Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, so I guess at least I have that going for me?"
Lol the irony is that Kevin Durant is one of the few people in the world who can literally make New York City care about the Nets. See how well this comment ages in a year or two.
"Yeah, but fan expectations are not the reason a player joins a team or not. The reason he gave for not joining are equally as applicable to the Nets. So he's basically saying the reason free agents don't join the Knicks is the same reason they don't join the Nets, he was asked why the Knicks can't attract free agents, he wasn't asked anything about fan expectations, he decided to interject that on his own. He also says at the end that he considers the Nets to be in similar ""coolness company"" as teams like the Warriors and Lakers. Kevin Durant is obviously up in the night if he believes that is true, lol. Not trying to shit on your franchise or anything, I think the Nets are a good franchise, but Durant is disillusioned as usual."
Kevin Durant being honest about the Knicks.  I like Durant.
6 feet kevin Durant
*Kevin Durant has been banned from Madison Square Garden*
I would like for Kevin Durant to support Hong Kong freedom so I can have superiority as his fan
"The Ultimate Kevin Durant nightmare:  Kyrie leads the Nets to a championship in year 1. Then KD is forced to join in with a team that won a championship without him, to win a ring the next season."
"Brandon Ingram and Buddy Hield  You get a player with good size being 6'10 with good length, defense, decent handles, good playmaking, can create his own shot, good footwork, and is one of the best shooters in the league so pretty much a better passing Kevin Durant"
See Kevin Wayne Durant (aka. cupcake).
"lol..  the okc is really gonna make me believe what kevin durant was saying about the organizations ""two-face"" is true.."

With Kevin Durant...
Bol bol needs to bulk up to Kevin Durant weight tf
Can’t believe lakers traded young Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is gone.  They arena no whats they used to be. Period.
"Yes because you have an all time great positionless player like Kevin Durant on your team.  Of course that can work because Dray is excellent in transition, but what about when the game slows down?  Without KD do you really want Draymond out on the wing? Teams were daring Draymond to take open threes last season. That's not ideal"
"This percentage is only misleading because Kevin Durant also attempts a lot more 3’s than Rondo does. Kevin Durant probably takes more 3’s in a quarter than Rondo takes in a game. Therefore, the comparison isn’t really fair.   Very misleading stat."
"KD being injured didn't really affect my fantasy football team, but that might be because I drafted Kevin Durant to my FF team and tried to run a fantasy tournament in the football offseason."
Lmao you’re one something if you’re really gonna say Curry is better than Kevin Durant. KD has a shit personality but in terms of pure skill Steph isn’t even close.
How to beetlejuice kevin durant 101
"well, since he himself said he wasn't 7 feet tall you knowing isn't anything special you dork. you make it sound like you're some sort of genius and that he lied. he's said multiple times the only times he says he is 7 feet is to the ladies. the truth is, most of us have one leg shorter than the other because of our backs and it's quite possible he is actually almost 6'11"" at times. he's literally never once said he's 7 feet tall in a serious manner tho u dork. the funniest part about your comment is you are probably like 5'6"" and extremely concerned about his height for no reason at all.  &amp;#x200B;  [his response to the question in the past](https://www.google.com/cameos/DHVq0lGp/exjwHa?hl=en)  &amp;#x200B;  [guess you fell for his jokes.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/)"
I AM KEVIN DURANT!
You gotta look at starters vs starters. The lakers are good. Dont forget the kevin durant warriors isnt the bar anymore. Nobody in the league has a better 1 and 2 than lebron and davis
"Kevin Durant and Bruno Caboclo, in about four years"
"I think it's pretty normal. Nobody's wishing ill will towards Kevin Durant, the person, they're just happy that a player who has the ability to kill them can't play anymore, consequently making the Raptors the favorites once again. It's a perfectly normal reaction."
"It doesnt roll off the tongue like   ""KEVIN DURANT IS 7 FEET CAN PULL UP FROM 30""   Noone cares about a 6 foot 10 that can pull up from 29"

Where are all the people who got mad at me for saying Kevin Durant is 6’9-6’10 and not 7foot?
"Yeah, I'm not sure why the NBA suddenly cares. Everyone's just waiting for Kevin Durant anyway."
Kevin Durant on the Sonics   Edit - Patrick Ewing on the Sonics
"Are you out of your mind? Do you not realize Kevin Durant is very likely 230-240?  A guy like Anthony Davis is a solid 250+ and he is visibly smaller than Gobert in terms of muscle tone, AND overall body length."
Kevin durant
I'm dead at kd being scared of playing center. As if Atkinson finds out his real height and makes Kevin fucking Durant just block shots and catch lobs lol
"I think the point in favor of Jarrett Allen is that he's much more important in the future of the franchise, the Nets won't be in full gear until a year from now when Kevin Durant comes back, and DJ's complete lack of any kind of lateral movement makes him a liability in a lot of matchups. It's never a good look when the best way to attack the opposing team's center is a 1-5 pick and roll; Boston's going to struggle with that after replacing Horford with Kanter."
"&gt; Can't wait to see Lebron announced at 6'7"".     Lol nah. I don't know where that dumb misconception even started.. He was 6'8 coming straight out of high school. Durant was also 6'9, when he entered the NBA at age 19. They both grew in between  &gt;   LeBron is a a legit 6'9 with shoes on. for Everyone who has been with him up close, have said the exact same thing. Every host in shows that mentions LeBron and has also knows him personally... all refers to him as the 6'9 bullet train.   &gt;  LeBron is taller than Kevin Love who's listed at 6'10, and LeBron also looks the same height as Anthony Davis.. when they are standing next to each other. Bron actually looks ""bigger"", because of his muscular frame and all that Thanos shit"
3-point % 2018-19  - James Harden	36.8	 - Damian Lillard	36.9 - Kevin Durant 35.3  So yes.
"What the fuck? Kevin Durant was never a 3 and D wing.  But leaving that aside, what you're arguing is ""3 and D role players are more valuable than shoot off the dribble ball handlers"" to which I say ""no shit"".  But that doesn't make them valuable. If you have a great one, they're the most valuable player you can have. 3 and D players are valued as low usage, high efficiency pieces you fit around the more valuable ball handler. You want PJ Tucker because he takes nothing away from James Harden and only adds to the plate. But James Harden is obviously more valuable. You like Ingles because he defends and spaces. Who is he spacing for? The substantially more valuable Middleton.   So yeah,  players who don't need the ball and score efficiently are nice to have around the much more valuable ball handler. But just look at who gets paid and who doesn't. Joe Ingles makes $12 million so you can fit 2 or 3 of them around that $32 million dollar ball handler."
"Warriors had their worse offense in years precisely due to the high volume of midrange shots from Klay and KD. In fact I talked about this multiple times throughout the year and you see articles like this:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.goldenstateofmind.com/platform/amp/2018/10/24/18010476/nba-2018-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-three-point-attempts-kevin-durant-klay-thompson  popping up throughout the year.  You make a fool of yourself by citing the Spurs 3 pt %. They also had the *lowest* attempt rate in the league at 25.3 attempts a game. Most teams in the NBA shoot at similar % while 1.5x the volume. The reason they had the 6th best offense rating is precisely because they didn't waste many possessions like I mentioned and transition efficiency, not due to some magical midrange dominance. In fact, your statement would be countered by every trend observed by analysts for years. The Rockets had top 10 offense for years simply due to cutting off the midrange to take drives or 3 pt shots, and resorting to other tactics than a midrange if possible."

"It would be so scripted and poetic for the OKC former Big Three to have all won a ring - Harden and Russ to have stayed loyal to their teams and trusted their front offices to do their part and finally win, whereas Kevin Durant joined the 73-9 Warriors who came back from a 3-1 deficit in the WCF (defeating him in the process), truly taking the ""hardest road"" to a championship.  They would have all won, and all it would say on bball reference was that they won a ring, but some would be much sweeter, and others would have asterisks."
" James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic  Cause Stephanie cant guard any of them"
Most NBA players claim to be taller they really are but with several notable exceptions.  Bill Walton actually was at least 7 ft tall but was always listed as 6 ft 11 inches. I think he did this cause was a hippie.  Kevin Durant is listed at 6 ft 9 inches tall but is at least 7 ft tall. He did this because he was afraid of being force to play power forward if his true height was revealed.
"I can't wait for Kevin Durant to be officially listed at 7'12"""
Looks like Durant admitted himself a few years ago he's 7' with shoes on and 6'11 without shoes on.   source: https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-forward-kevin-durant-finally-reveals-his-true-height
"Yea, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that’s n out one of the most notable entries   ‘Kevin Durant is 7’1’ has my vote"
I can't blame the Warriors for taking Durant. No team other than the Knicks would not accept him coming lol. What would they say? Nah you were in OKC?  My issue in this situation is with Kevin.
Kevin Durant.

"Kevin ""Kyle Lowry"" Durant."
"Definitely have not seen the best from Kyrie Irving yet.  Coming back to home area (grew up in West Orange. Not far from NYC). Gets to play with a young core in LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Joe Harris, etc. (we know how poorly that went with Rozier, Jaylen Brown, and Tatum though 😬). And after this year, he'll get to play with the best player in the world pre-injury in Kevin Durant.  I don't expect a huge jump from Kyrie, but there is some greatness left in him. Also perhaps a change in mindset will allow him to evolve as a player."
"Can't forget John Stockton.  The next guy is *nearly 4,000* assists behind him, my goodness:  	Player	Assists 1.	John Stockton	15,806 2.	Jason Kidd	12,091 3.	Steve Nash	10,335  And even has MJ behind by about *800 steals*:  	Player	Steals John Stockton 3,265 . Michael Jordan 2,515  I don't think we'll see something like MJs ppg playoff average, his almost *4 points ppg* above the next player:  Rank	Player	PPG 1.	Michael Jordan*	33.45 2.

"I think you meant “rarely just dip out”, but we can name just a few since 2017:  * Gordon Hayward leaving UTA for BOS  * Paul George requesting trades from small markets IND and OKC for LAL and LAC, respectively  * Kevin Durant leaving OKC for GSW  * Jimmy Butler pushing for a trade from MIN to PHI (LAC and BKN were included as other options)  * Bojan Bogdanovich leaving IND for UTA  * Giannis Antetokounmpo threatening (I dunno what to call it) to leave MIL if things don’t go right  * LeBron James leaving CLE for LAL  * Kyrie Irving requesting a trade from CLE to BOS  * Anthony Davis requesting a trade from NOP to LAL  * Kawhi Leonard requesting a trade from SAS to LAC, eventually leaving TOR to get there.  I think that’s a pretty fair amount.   Also /s about the Bojan one"
"Kyrie publically came out and said he was going to re-sign and then became a malcontent, proceeded to further not buy into Brad's system and then walked.   A fan of every single other team would feel the same way and to say otherwise is hilarious. You really think that your fanbase wouldn't be up in arms about the situation if it happened to them?   Why arent Celtics fans up in arms about Horford? If were just salty huge homers wouldn't we hate Horford too? We certainly wouldn't be telling him his beautiful eyes as he shoots free throws.  Sweet. Kyrie got an opportunity to play at home with Kevin fucking Durant. That's not what Celtics fans are mad about, but apparently this sub has the critical thinking skills of a middle schooler."
"Depends if you count Larry Bird, Kevin Durant and Meyers Leonard as bigs"
70% Kevin Durant is still prime Dirk-esque at worse. Even without being able to take people off the dribble like he did before he can still shoot over basically anyone in the league and his game doesnt require a ton of athleticism in the way Westbrook or Lebron does
Nets have also have this guy named Kevin Durant by the way
"Its utterly ridiculous.   Lebron James shooting percentage =  .368  Kobe bryant shooting percentage= .447  Jordan percentage = .49  steph curry = .477  kevin durant = .49  I swear I hate when the commentators call him that. You literally dont even see it in his ability on the court, his numbers are padded with all the shots he takes. He's not the best dribbler, shooter, defensive player,  scorer, closer, or free throw shooter. Its literally dumb as fuck to call a person who's physical abilities are pretty much average the best in the world."
Kevin Durant...
"Here's your guide to being on the Thunder bandwagon:  We like: Shai Gilgeous Alexander, first round picks  We don't like: Kevin Durant, Patrick Beverly"
"No he won't, he's home and has Kevin Durant."
"That’s rich coming from the sub that routinely shits all over Kevin Durant, lebron etc. burning their jerseys, cheering their injuries etc. r/nba isn’t some golden sub. Not to mention  following their personal lives like the Kardashians."
That's crazy talk.  Kevin Durant is obviously the most overrated player.
Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant.
"Fuck me right, Kevin Durant just got announced for MY team!!!"
He is Kevin Durant
His name is still kevin durant
"Yeah it was weird something changed. I always say something changed specifically with Durant around the beginning of the 2018 calendar year.   In 2017 he was engaged on defense had the best season of his career on that end and was worthy of All NBA defense consideration. 2017-18 started out the same way. [People were writing columns like this](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy). But then something just happened around January 2018........he just stopped giving a shit at all on defense. The entire Warriors team played bad defense in January but that was largely just a blip. They recovered and turned it up when it mattered. KD didnt though. Even in those elimination games vs Houston he was doing stupid ass shit on defense like not picking up Eric Gordon in transition. 2019 was the same thing if not worse actually.  Im bringing up the defense because it just is a microcosm of how his focus, effort and engagement just took a turn suddenly. Something had to have happened. I remember Zach Lowe saying in summer 2018 the Warriors had concerns internally that KD might leave even that summer. I know KD has said he didnt get the satisfaction he expected from winning a ring. Maybe once that happened after 2017 that was the turning pt."
"Iirc in the 2016 USA team, KD was a little envious of how close DeMar and Kyle were and wanted something like that.  Edit: Here's Kalaimian, a former OKC and Raptors coach in 2016 about a text that Durant sent him.  &gt;""Your two guys are the best. I'm jealous of their relationship, the way they get along with each other and the way they play together. The way they enjoy each other, it's great,"" Kalamian said of that text on Monday, as the Raptors finished up their practice. Durant, all the way from the Olympics in Rio, was in awe of the friendship that Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan had on display with the U.S. men's basketball team.  &gt;""I think it's kind of what he wants,"" Kalamian continued. ""He wants that bond with someone . . . and I think he's going to find that.  &gt;""Early on in OKC, we had that.""  &gt;...  &gt;""We had that (bond) really with James Harden. He was a connector of everyone. He brought Westbrook, Durant and (Serge) Ibaka and they all kind of connected, they all came together,"" Kalamian said.  &gt;""James is a big reason and when he left I think Kevin said . . . that trade was the beginning of the end for him and now there wasn't that connection as much.  &gt;""Kevin and Russell, they respect the heck out of each other, no question about it. They played well together, they work well together, they communicate, but I think the connection was lost a little bit for whatever reason."""
"&gt;	Kevin Durant, the small forward who wore number 35 on his jersey for the Golden State Warriors during the 2018-2019 season of the National Basketball Association, spoke with Serge Ibaka..."
"What if Draymond was crying *as* a cold and calculated Machiavellian move?   A study of KD would show that he's an emotional guy. Not just the famous MVP speech, but throughout his career all the way back to his rookie season.   From 2008:   &gt; If this really was the last time the SuperSonics played in this city, nobody convinced the more than 15,000 fans who showed up to watch their beloved team rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 99-95 on Sunday night.  &gt; They chanted ""Save our Sonics!"" and had a far less gracious chant for Sonics owner Clay Bennett. They roared ""GP!"" when Gary Payton, the star point guard during Seattle's last heyday in the mid-1990s, took a seat near the Dallas Mavericks' bench early in the second quarter.  &gt; They carried signs. One read, ""E-mail Clay: C.U. in court!"" Another called Bennett, who intends to move the team to Oklahoma City, ""a liar"" and ""a thief.""  &gt; And they just kept roaring.  &gt; **""I almost cried, to be honest with you,"" Sonics rookie star Kevin Durant said.** ""It was phenomenal.""  https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2008/4/14/20082211/seattle-shows-its-love-to-sonics  So Draymond would know that KD is an emotional guy, and thus might respond more to an emotional angle than a purely rational/basketball one. That's the gap in KD's psychological armor, and so that's what Draymond exploits."

"You don’t know shit about shit lol.   &gt; I just liked the organization as far as just the direction they were going in. A bunch of young guys **that played in the playoffs before**. I think the Knicks players are good young players, but they still need a little bit more experience to match where I was in my career. I just think Brooklyn was farther along in the process of being a contender. - Kevin Durant."
In a rough best to worst order  Kawhi Leonard (LAC)  LeBron James (LAL)  Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL)  James Harden (HOU)  Steph Curry (GSW)  Anthony Davis (LAL)  Nikola Jokic (DEN)  Joel Embiid (PHI)  Damian Lillard (POR)  Paul George (LAC)  Kevin Durant (BKN) is the 1-3 best player in the world but he is out for the whole season because of a torn Achilles he suffered in June
"That’s a bunch of unlikely hypotheticals right there. If Giannis went to GSW, he’s piggybacking off of what Kevin Durant did, and doing it with an older/worn-down team. That’s a no for me.   If he’s leaving Milwaukee, I think he’s doing it for Toronto. They’ll restructure Lowry’s deal, let go of Gasol/Ibaka to clear up some room, and team him with Siakam. That and the Masai connection can’t be ignored.   Dark horse could be a Clippers sign and trade for Paul George if he doesn’t pan out for the Clips."
"Downvote the thread and then accept that what you’re wanting to happen just isn’t going to happen. This is a sub about the nba, kevin Durant is an nba player (a very polarizing one at that), therefore topics involving kd are going to show up"

Kawhi did exactly the opposite of what Kevin Durant did. He took an actual legitimately harder road.
Except d'antoni lol .   (Kidding btw)  The guy is so effective at the mid-range only second to Kevin Durant
Caruso and KCP for Kevin Durant
"Takeaways:  \- Patrick Beverly already made the all-defense first team  \- The Clippers are likely to have at least 3 guys make the all-defense team  \- This was the best defensive performance LeBron has put on in a long time. Expect him to contend for a spot on all-defense like he perennially used to  \- LeBron was sloppy offensively, but contrary to the knee-jerk reactions across the sub, he has not lost a step. The defense was just too good at reading him.  \- Lakers role players need to learn to cut when the defense shows hard on playing the pass to the 3. There were numerous plays throughout that game where LeBron was caught without a pass option when he went up because someone didnt cut like they should have.  \- The Clippers can mask their interior size shortcomings vs. Anthony Davis with aggressive help and trapping  \- Did I mention Patrick Beverly already made the all-defense first team?  \- The Lakers lack secondary play-making  \- Kawhi Leonard is the best mid-range scorer in the league not named Kevin Durant, and he honestly might have an argument he's better.  \- Dwight Howard sets the most weak sauce screens of all-time for a player with his physical gifts  \- The Lakers desperately need Kuzma's scoring presence to alleviate the pressure off LeBron, AD, and APPARENTLY DANNY GREEN  \- The Clippers compensate for their lack of any true primary playmakers with out-standing individual scoring talent and decent ball movement.  \- It's criminal that Alex Caruso saw no minutes while KCP, troy daniels, quinn cook, and jared dudley ate up bench minutes  \- I have a good feeling Patrick Beverly is gonna make the all-defense first team  \- Avery Bradley gave the Lakers some good minutes and could be one of the Summer's sneakiest good signings  &amp;#x200B;  This has been game takeaways by ya boi,  MangOH"
"Y'all literally added Kevin Durant to a 73-9 team after choking in the Finals. FOH talking about ""how much help do they need?"""
Let's just say thanks to Kevin Durant for leaving golden state and giving us the nba we wanted to watch for years now
You believe Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson aren't that game/series changing?
Ask Kevin Durant.
"Since 2000, no #2 pick besides Kevin Durant has had as productive of a season at 21 years old. Bagley will probably surpass him, but Ingram has been FAR from below average compared to most #2 picks."
Ingram tried the Kevin Durant special
"okay guess i gotta educate you on your own team. the comment i was replying to was referring to iggy being out for some of the games in the rockets series in 2018. in 2018 steph curry, kevin durant, draymond green and klay thompson were all named all stars. last time i checked that amount of people equals 4"
He probably does. [He also thinks Kyrie is better than Iverson.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2017/06/14/kevin-durant-says-kyrie-irving-better-allen-iverson)
"Kevin love was not above D Wade in the 2011 season. Judging by VORP (unless you have a better all around metric) from the past 3 seasons including 2011:  D Wade avgd 7.8  Kobe avgd 4.3  Love avgd 2 (pretty laughable to even think K Love was on D wades level in 2011)  Durant 4.1  CP3 6.4  Russ 3.1 (also laughable to think at that point he was better than Wade)  Even if you only look at the 2011 season instead of the previous 3, Wade had a better VORP than all of them in 2011"
Its always worrying when you go from Kevin Durant as your starting small forward to Glen Robinson 3rd
"Massively disagree. The average NFL player is more injured, has a shorter career, is paid way less, and is far more prone to losing their job because of said injury. Kevin Durant had what would have been a career ending injury, and immediately afterward got a max contract offer from several suitors. There’s zero chance of that ever happening in a league where most contracts aren’t even fully guaranteed."
"I believe it also had something to do with Kevin Durant retroactively receiving the ""rose rule"" bonus despite not asking for it or being part of his contract."
I mean yeah the nets have Kevin Durant which is a big step towards being a contender
"&gt; Where do people rank Kevin Durant all time? From what I see as of right now around the 25ish range. Ben Taylor has him 23 in his extensive all time rankings.   2 Championships, 2 Finals MVP's, 4 finals appearances, 3 straight scoring titles. He is in that Scottie Pippen area."
"I don't know how I'm being downvoted, but in all seriousness I can get to 17 players definitively better that those guys.  In no particular order  West  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Karl Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Russell Westbrook.  East  Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, and Kyrie Irving.  I am willing to concede Kemba Walker, which makes 18.   So, that's 2 spots.  Any 2 of Blake, Butler, Beal, and Oladipo are not definitively better than Devin Booker, Donovan Mitchell, Lamarcus Aldridge, Demar Derozan, or Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis, or even Luka Doncic.  I would personally fill it out with DeRozan and Draymond because advanced stats are meaningless when you only manage to win 25 games.  OPs attempts to shoehorn in Al Horford and John Wall are peak EC stupidity."
Lmao that Thon Maker take.   &gt; He is 7 foot but handles like a point guard. If Kevin Durant and Kevin Garnett had a baby it would be him
We'd have to spend time digging through it more than either of us have. But the key thing to consider again is longevity. Guys like Dwight Howard were at one time considered top 3 players in the NBA by many and they arent close to any top 30 convos.   Here's one way Ill put it for you maybe itll help contextualize and frame it. Where do people rank Kevin Durant all time? From what I see as of right now around the 25ish range. [Ben Taylor has him 23 in his extensive all time rankings](http://www.backpicks.com/2017/12/11/the-backpicks-goat-the-40-best-careers-in-nba-history/). Now lets look at KD's resume   a) Been a top 10 player since 2010(with many top 5 seasons). Throw out 2015 due to injury so that's 9 seasons.   b) Two Finals MVPs and in both he was way better than 2014 Kawhi   c) Regular season MVP.   And that's a guy considered around the 23rd best player in NBA history. Again 9 seasons of top 10 player status(and maybe like 7 as top 5) with the Finals MVPs and a reg season MVP. So let's say to crack the top 30 instead of being top 25 maybe Kawhi off the top of our heads needs 7 seasons of top 10 play not 9? Something like that. Point is it's alot more than 3 and if KD had only existed from 2016-2018 nobody would consider him a top 30 player of all time.
"Kawhi Leonard left a championship winning team. Kevin Durant left a dynasty. LeBron James left a team that had been to the finals 4 years in a row. Kyrie Irving left a team that had been to the finals 3 years in a row. Jimmy Butler left a team that is considered to be one of the favourites to come on top from the east.  If anything, the trend is going back to how it used to be. Players aren't looking to form a superteam with three or four all stars, they're clearly doing their own thing right now. You're a bit late with this."
BREAKING: KEVIN DURANT NOT EXPECTED TO PLAY SEASON OPENER.
"&gt;The 2020 first-round pick the Warriors sent to the Nets in the D’Angelo Russell and Kevin Durant sign-and-trade is protected 1-20. If the pick lands in that range, Golden State will send its 2025 second-round pick to Brooklyn."
"In 30 years, absolutely. But for now, I hate him and he sucks.   My all time rankings have Curry at #16 and Durant at #18. Other players in that tier are: 15. Karl Malone 17. Moses Malone 19. Dirk Nowitzki 20. Kevin Garnett"

Read this as Kevin Durant eats Serge Ibakas snake
Kevin Durant *was* unlikely to play in the finals too
"&gt;	Kevin Durant is very tall and good at basketball, he wants to win a championship so he chose the Nets.   Weirdest conclusion to a post I think I’ve seen on here"
[How is Cousins 6’11” if KD is 6’10”](https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/omnisport/99/78/kevin-durant-63016-usnews-ftr_1vn2owry7ud31j185pcc24t39.jpg?t=-1590445563&amp;quality=100)
So Kevin Durant ate himself? I didn't know that was physically possible
"Kevin ""Subzero"" Durant"
wow kevin durant hates brooklyn nets fans. kinda fucked up :/
Gotta have:  Michael Jordan   Portland Trailblazers Kevin Durant   Portland Trailblazers
Kevin Durant is the Pierre Delecto of the NBA.
Kevin Durant is one of the most disliked players in the league and happened to be on the most stacked team ever that everyone was rooting against.
"Its utterly ridiculous to suggest he hasn't done enough. An MVP is already enough, let alone two.  List of MVPs who aren't in the HOF: Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo  List of MVPs who have qualified for the hall of fame but haven't been inducted yet:"
"Pre Kevin Durant, the Warriors had 7-8 guys who you could count on and play consistently, often times on both ends.  They were able to bring Livingston, Iggy, and Ezeli out to protect the lead, and often times raise it.  You can also stagger lineups and have a damn good lineup.  The Raptors won largely due to injuries, but also because they had guys like Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka, Green, and Vanvleet all show up.  The Heat literally won because Ray Allen stepped, as well as guys like Shane Battier.  Don't get me wrong, if there is a guy who can do it with minimal depth, it's LeBron James.  He's done more with less probably more than anyone in history.  At the same time, ""overrating depth"" is a just nonsense.  It's a star driven league for sure, but what puts a lot of these teams over the top and nets them their ring is the depth they have as multiple guys step up.  Maybe guys like Dwight, Rondo, and Kuz really step up, but that is a huge question mark.    The Clippers have the star power *and* proven depth--guys like JMG, Trez, Lou, Shamet, etc. all have a much higher chance of stepping up in addition to their stars.    For you to feel so strongly about the Lakers chances shows that you are in fact bias.  We haven't seen a single actual game played, and teams are sure to evolve over the season.  I'm betting the Clippers realize their lack of bigs hurts and swing a deal for even a Baynes level guy.    Either way, depth is incredibly important, and those teams you are pointing to are actually examples of depth getting you that last 5 yards.  I think the Lakers have a phenomenal shot at the ring, higher than the Clippers as it currently sits, but the stuff you are refuting has nothing to do with a lack of respect for the Lakers, and much more you having homer goggles on."
"Here's a video of a snake eating a snake, therefore it is plausible that Kevin Durant may still be a snekk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpUUgOUReoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpUUgOUReoU)"
"Kevin durant in his 3rd season: 30.1 PPG, league scoring leader, 60% TS.  Making 6 million in his 4th year.  Brown in his 3rd season: 13 ppg, 54% TS.  Making \~28 mil in his 4th year.  Very, very similar players and a totally fair comparison  edit: wrong about the when the deal kicks in but the point still stands"
"Dude are you okay?   Do you know what the word “looks” means in this context?  He *looks* like Kevin Durant, and thus, people like to say he has potential because he *looks* like one of the greatest scorers of all time   It’s really not that hard"
"&gt;looks   Actually I think I do, and as I said, people look at him and falsely equate him to Kevin Durant. I hope that’s clear enough for you"
Kevin Durant didn't have more assists than turnovers in a season until his sixth year. Guys that aren't used to make plays for others often have ratios like this.
"Sixers starting 5 isn’t going to click as well as everyone seems to think. Horford is getting old, Harris at the wing full-time is a big if, Ben’s not magically going to become any sort of decent shooter over one summer, and he and Joel have always fit awkwardly in the first place.  Kyrie and Kevin Durant together have some seriously high potential to ruin the chemistry of the Nets locker room before KD ever hits the court.  Denver makes the Finals out west."
And then he will be fired right before Kevin Durant is traded there
Draymond Green called Kevin Durant while sitting in his car right after the Warriors lost Game 7 to the LA Clippers in Round 1
Then kevin durant has way less than 0 good opinions.
Kevin Durant has 0 good opinions on anything.
"They have played on the same team for the last 3 years where kd had to change his game to the warriors system. Kevin durant has never averaged less then 25 points other then his rookie year, steph averaged over 25 for the first time in 2016. When you talk about the best scorers you think about all the ways they can score the ball. FT's, Mid Range, driving, posting up, shot creation, 3pt's Etc. Steph is not on kd's level."
"The Warriors have been running out 5 once-or-eventually-an-All Star lineups for a while now. If you're willing to dive beyond just the starters, they've had possible 5 All-Star lineups for the entire dynasty. They've had Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Iguodala for the whole championship run thing. During that time, they've also had David Lee, David West, DeMarcus Cousins, and Kevin Durant. If we want to get technical about it, 2018-2019 is the only all-starters All Star lineup, but they've been able to field former stars off the bench for a while. And let's not forget about almost All-Star Zaza Pachulia."
The questions Serge asks are awesome. Best Kevin Durant interview ever -- for him to talk about Russell and James like that? Awesome!
when lebron james hit the game winner in the 2016 finals and three-way made out with stephen curry and kevin durant after
Not even close. He was average last year and was passing the ball to the two best shooters of all time and Kevin Durant. I could’ve put up better numbers. He looked slower as well. The eyeball test wasn’t good. And don’t call me a warriors hater cause I love Steph and Klay.
i've been waiting three years for this  **FUCK KEVIN DURANT**
"&gt;There's confidence and then there's delusion.    All y'all incels lack common sense or what? Do you even know who the fuck is Kevin Durant? I'm not talking about the person.. i'm talking about the player. It has been LeBron and him, at the very top, for almost a decade now.   &gt;  Every NBA team will always be more afraid of Durant.. as a shooter, than Steph. It's not about being the ""better shooter"".. Durant is almost a 7 footer with 7'6 wingspan. Curry is a light 6'2 dude.  That's the difference between players like LeBron, Durant, Giannis, Kawhi, AD etc.. compared to the likes of Curry, Kyrie, Lillard, and even Harden.   &gt;  Durant doesn't have to be the better shooter, because he literally can get a shot off on any defender in the league, from anywhere on the court lol It's like shooting over a chair. When Durant pulls up, anyone who's on him just has to hope for him to miss. That's about it. You could stay GLUED to Durant, and he'd still make you look like a chair.    It's not just his height.. but also that massive wingspan.    &gt;  Durant also can go in and dunk on someone.. and he also can shoot/score literally fro anywhere on the court. It's very easy to stop someone like Curry, especially in the playoffs.. that even contain someone like Durant. You can't even be physical with someone that big and quick. Nada"
**IMAGINE WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THE PLAYERS CALLED KEVIN DURANT AND KLAY THOMPSON OUT ON THE OPPOSING TEAM. THAT'S LIKE WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP WITH LEBRON JAMES AND KYRIE IRVING OUT. (ANYONE WHO SAYS DURANT AND THOMPSON = LOVE AND IRVING CAN FK OFF.)**
"Man, Kevin Durant is gonna hate him lol."
"If it works itd be pretty sick :  Not initially, and Dinwiddie's offering can't be traded for one year. But Dinwiddie sees a future where, once there's a critical mass of athletes who have their own tokens, you could log onto the platform and trade NBA players the way you would trade other securities.  ""We envision a world where you're gonna be able to trade a Spencer for a Kyrie [Irving] for a [Kevin Durant],"" Dinwiddie said. ""In a lot of ways, it kind of does represent this paradigm of real fantasy sports. It's an extremely interesting model. It's a non-correlated asset in relation to the legacy market, and we're gonna have a lot of fun with it"
"&gt;LeBron James and Kevin Durant scored at a gargantuan rate, with both players combining for 38,995 points (That's more than the career point total of James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard combined).  The difference between Harden and LeBron (1 and 3) is about the same as the difference between Harden and Westbrook (3 and 4), so saying this doesn't mean that much.  It's also about 25 games at last season's average.  LeBron and Harden combined for about the same amount of points as Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, and Dwyane Wade."
"Oh gee, the core from the 73 win warriors team plus Kevin Durant who was playing historically well in the playoffs. How could anyone ever lose to that trash-tier roster?"
AND THEY'RE BOTH KEVIN DURANT
"&gt; Nobody knows what Kevin Durant will do when he becomes a free agent at the conclusion of the 2018-19 season, but one thing is certain:  &gt; He is looking to get paid.  &gt; ""I'm not thinking about none of that s--t,"" Durant said on Wednesday, per The Athletic's Marcus Thompson II. ""I am thinking about the money I'm going to get. I never got the (massive) deal. I've just seen a bunch of dudes around the league making so much money—and I'm happy for them. But I know I deserve that, too. That's the only thing I'm probably thinking about, to be honest.""  (End of 2018)  Yeaaahhh I don’t think KD agrees."
"Kevin Durant was the best player on that collection of talent. He was the two time finals mvp for them. My point is that without him they were just a great team. 1-1 in chips, and not the oppressive force they were with Durant. And no, other members of the team did not contribute just as much. Steph you could argue. Klay is a good 2nd option, and absurd 3rd one. Dray is a glue guy, yes, but It’s Kevin Durant. They might not have won another championship if he didn’t sign there."
Kevin Durant*
Cooked by Kevin Durant? What a fucking loser!
I was gonna say whatever vaginitis Kevin Durant had in 2016 maybe? We were up 3-1.

I always said he'd be our Draymond Green as a starting defensive PF that could run an offense. Never knew we were a getting Kevin fucking Durant clone.
"James Harden is one of the greatest players of our generation but not as good as Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, or LeBron James."
Try again. KD dropped 10 mil on the Dirrant Center which already had 69 kids enrolled before it opened.   https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2817292-kevin-durant-opens-the-durant-center-to-help-low-income-students-with-college.amp.html
"Better chance than multiple-time MVP and three-time title winner Steph Curry, two time Finals MVPs Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, and the current MVP who’s still only 24?  Bold take."
He’s evolved into a legitimate Small Forward.   Kevin Durant?
"&gt; James Harden had a young Kevin Durant, young Russell Westbrook, and a solid supporting cast.   All three of these guys were way too young. Harden wasn't at his prime at this point.  &gt; outside of Golden state, the most dangerous shooting team in the NBA.   You answered your own question about Harden not winning a championship in the last couple years. Kawhi never beat a healthy Warriors or came close to what Harden did against them."
"Ok so Kawhi played on a spurs team that had a nearly retired Tim Duncan, old Manu Ginobili, and Declining Tony Parker. Then on the Raptors he had Kyle Lowry, an up and coming Pascal Siakam, and a solid bench lead by Fred VanVleet.   James Harden had a young Kevin Durant, young Russell Westbrook,  and a solid supporting cast. Then on the rockets he had Chris Paul and outside of Golden state, the most dangerous shooting team in the NBA.   Maybe Kawhi hasn't been on sub par teams, but Harden hasn't been on scrub teams that cannot go all the way. What he has is good coaches. Ever since they both became all stars one thing remains true when they are relatively healthy till the end of the season, and that is that Kawhi's team's do better than they are projected while Harden's team's are seen as failures compared to their projections."
"&gt; They are paid for playing not winning.  So in your opinion, Kevin Durant (or any other injured player) should not be getting paid right now?"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie
"Thought you might enjoy this [Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant coercing the Nets into signing Jordan to a four-year, $40 million deal was an underrated free-agency side plot.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28021786/ten-nba-things-like-including-luka-doncic-trickery)  enjoy the next 4 years of that haha"
&gt; Kevin Durant Played because the fans wanted him to  Source?
"Rodney Hood says:  &gt; Guys were looking forward to getting at them without that 7-foot monster [Durant], so now everybody feels it's an even playing field.  I scoured the Western Conference Finals box scores where the Warriors swept the Blazers for ""Kevin Durant"" but couldn't seem to find him. I'll keep looking.  As a follow up, I looked into the most recent Warriors victory over Hood's Blazers and saw no signs of Curry/KD/Draymond/Klay/Iguodala/Livingston/anyone from the last 5 years playing for the Warriors. Not sure what that's about."
"&gt;Kevin Durant said his argument with Draymond Green last season contributed to him leaving the Warriors last summer. &gt; &gt;Golden State coach Steve Kerr on the “Book of Basketball 2.0"" podcast with Bill Simmons: &gt; &gt;This was two guys who were about ready to fight. &gt; &gt;In this particular case with Kevin, it was too much, and it’s something that happened on national TV. And now, you open up the whole world – you’ve invited the whole world to scrutinize your team. And so now, there’s so many distractions that it becomes really difficult to deal with. If this had happened at a practice, you can cover it up. Actually, we had several things over the past few years that have happened that never made it out, and we’re very proud of that. &gt; &gt;This echoes David West, who flaunted the Warriors’ ability to keep secrets. &gt; &gt;But this wasn’t just bad luck that Green and Durant were on national television. Of course, Green knew cameras were on him. It was the middle of the game. &gt; &gt;Green was so upset with Durant, Green berated Durant in front of everyone. Usually, players wait to confront teammates until they’re in private. That Green didn’t wait speaks to intensity of the discord. &gt; &gt;And probably says something about why Durant left."
"No kidding! I mean seriously, Kevin Durant, of all people. You think he’d just blindly say yes if the team asked him to play if he had any hesitation he might not be ready? No fucking chance!"
I think a fairly strong argument could be made that statistics like WS/48 are beyond irrelevant when getting to small decimals like the .054 Kevin Durant had in 2017 over the Actual winner in Westbrook.
Kevin Durant has left the chat.
Kevin Durant had every opportunity to say no. He didn’t. It was his decision. He wanted to play. The Warriors and the Doctors didn’t force him to play.
“Where is Kevin Durant and Steven curry”
Kevin Durant for the 2019-2020 season.
Jerry Stackhouse missing a game is very different than Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant is a blow hard. If he doesn’t get hurt he’s a Knick this year. Had nothing to do with Dolan
"&gt; Also by now players like Kevin Durant publicly are saying they refuse to come to the Knicks because Dolan fosters a losing environment.  That's not what he said.  What he said was “I thought about it, yeah, just a thought. But I didn’t really do any deep, full analysis on the Knicks — no,” Durant said.  In a later interview he elaborated that he signed with the Nets becasue they were closer to contention.  Not once did he ever mention management as a consideration for him not signing.   You've totally made that up, but you picked the right one to try that nonsense on."
"If you believe that I got a fucking bridge to sell you.  Also by now players like Kevin Durant publicly are saying they refuse to come to the Knicks because Dolan fosters a losing environment.  At this point it no longer matters if he meddles, he has a reputation. And his reputation is harmful to the team."
2019 Rockets &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2018 Rockets while 2019 Warriors were about as good as the 2018 Warriors. Also KD still played 4.75 games in that series. Having *Kevin Durant* for the majority of the series is monumental.    Also the Raptors dropped 2 games to the KD-less Warriors and still won. The KD-less Warriors were still contenders. But that didn’t “disprove” anything about the Raptors.
"They werent dumb comparisons and you can clearly see the similarities beyond just their frame.  It's just that people play dumb and act like just cuz you're comparing a guys projected play style to a superstar, you think that guy will be as good as the one you're comparing him too.  Kevin Durant is one of the 20 best players ever to play the game, those making that comparison generally speaking are not saying Ingram would do anything close to that   It's like I can say Terry Rozier has a jumper similar to Michael jordan, doeant mean I'm saying hes an all time great mid range shooter.  Just that the look of it is similar and the style Rozier uses is similar to MJ"
"I'd put Durant on the team as a starter hands down.  PG. Steph Curry   SG. James Harden   SF. Kevin Durant   PF. Lebron James    C. Anthony Davis   Duncan was a 3x All Star, 2x All NBA, 2x All Defense, NBA Champ and  averaged 14/9/2.7 with 1.9 blocks and 15/9/2.2/.6/1.6 in the playoffs in the 2010s but you can' make the all decade team if you didn't play but half the decade"
"Agreed, and that seems to be the plan.  But it's good to see him doing this, and apparently its good for the rest of the team to see him, too:  [https://www.netsdaily.com/2019/11/6/20952478/when-kevin-durant-shoots-around-his-teammates-pay-attention-a-lot-of-attention](https://www.netsdaily.com/2019/11/6/20952478/when-kevin-durant-shoots-around-his-teammates-pay-attention-a-lot-of-attention)"
"Kevin Durant, Westbrook, Dwight, CP3   Shaq, lebron, Bosh, chalmers    Idkkk I think it’s closer than you imply"
"Nice try, Kevin Durant"
I think my best example is that Aaron Gordon wants to play like a poor man's Kevin Durant when he should play like a billionaires Draymond green
"LOL, oh yea James Harden and Steve Nash&lt; Curr, Klay,Dray, and Kevin Fucking Durant in terms of talent, dont give that me garabage. Steve Kerr has had more talent than most of nba roster for 5 years now. Those rockets teams ALWAYS had less talent and were still competing with the Warriors. Dont give me that stupid crap.  LOL you cant even tell me what everything is, you're just making a dumb generalized statement. Or are you telling me if they switched teams, the Rockets would beat the Warriors which is even stupider."
"Less stressed.  No expectations this season, just player development rn, and I love him always and he's obviously brilliant but I get the sense coaching a team with Kevin Durant in it is not headache-free"
/r/nba did the same thing hating on Kevin Durant for joining the warriors. They’re jealous

Kevin “Saul Goodman” Durant
A player can sit out any time.  What happened to Kevin Durant? in the finals when they pushed and brought him back early?  Blew a knee or something and costed himself tens of millions.
"&gt; “A lot of times, key defence is overlooked in the pressurized ending of the great games,” said Brown. “Could you stop their best guy who had to do it for them at that time because no (Kevin) Durant and no (Klay) Thompson? This young man stepped up and did it, and laid it out there physically before you. So I thought that he should be mentioned.”  A lot of times, but for whatever reason, not in 2015 lol"
"Curry won a ring without kevin Durant and made 2 finals lmao, but he “didn’t prove anything” according to that dude  That in itself would make him the third most accomplished star in the top 10, maybe even second"
"it worked last year, mainly because of injuries to kevin durant and klay thompson. players need to play. I cant call kawhi the best sitting out all these games."
"I disagree, but you're also leaving out Kevin Durant..."
the nets roster is full of holes and deandre jordan cannot be your starting center in 2019  and the plan was to have kevin durant on the court? did you forget this?  y’all try too hard to rag on kyrie.. man. imagine if he beats boston with these rag tag nets.  keep that same energy
"Are you really this dense? Of course they both had serious injuries, I'm saying the argument I'm personally making in this thread has nothing to do with Kevin Durant."
Steph is not better on offense than LeBron James or Kevin Durant bro
"If they retire right now, KD would be seen as better. But I think that, 20-30 years down the road, people are gonna look back at what steph curry did and put him over kd. Kevin Durant is the most well rounded scorer of all time in my opinion. But Steph Curry is going to go down as the forefather of the next era of basketball. As great as kd is, as great as lebron is, even as great as Jordan is, none of those dudes are going to have a bigger footprint on the way basketball is played than Steph IMO."
"Players with at least 1x MVP, 3x All-NBA, 8x All-Star, and 2x championships:  * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Michael Jordan * Bill Russell * Wilt Chamberlain * LeBron James * Larry Bird * Magic Johnson * Tim Duncan * Kobe Bryant * Bob Cousy * Kevin Durant * Shaquille O'Neal * Hakeem Olajuwon * David Robinson  That's 14 players as (or more) accomplished than Dave Cowens. If you include at least 3x All-Defensive as a criteria, Magic and KD fall off (not including the older guys who played before All-Defensive teams existed)."
Eric Paschall &gt; Kevin Durant &gt; Draymond Green
Kevin Durant looks like if frank ocean got put in that contraption they put mel gibson in at the end of braveheart except he lived!
"Of this list of 41, who is he more impactful than? (most names borrowed from Backpicks)  James Harden Ray Allen Clyde Drexler Kevin McHale Elgin Baylor Artis Gilmore Paul Pierce Jason Kidd Walt Frazier John Havlicek Bob Pettit Reggie Miller Rick Barry Patrick Ewing John Stockton Moses Malone Scottie Pippen Dwyane Wade Kevin Durant Charles Barkley Chris Paul Stephen Curry Steve Nash Dirk Nowitzki Jerry West Julius Erving David Robinson Karl Malone Kobe Bryant Oscar Robertson Larry Bird Magic Johnson Wilt Chamberlain Kevin Garnett Tim Duncan Hakeem Olajuwon Shaquille O’Neal Bill Russell Michael Jordan LeBron James Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"
"On the flip side, Kevin Durant signed a short term contract with the Warriors, and despite the Achilles injury, every team still wanted to offer him the max in free agency."
"I agree with you.  This man is acting like with load management , any superstar can come on a good team and avg 30.  As much fellating people do over kawhi, the people who diminshed what he's been able to do is equally if not more annoying.  I can see why people rate him a certain way, regency bias, looking for the next superstar  But I don't see why people would underrate what's he's been able to accomplish.  Paul George with rest isn't leading Toronto to a championship.   Demar DeRozan with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.   Russell Westbrook with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.  James harden with rest wasn't leading Toronto to a championship.   The facts are the facts. What made the run impressive because not only of his stats but the team followed his leadership. He was never rattled.   The only people you can put on the raptors with rest/load management that would have won is LeBron James and Kevin Durant. They are the only ones."
There are a lot of statistical articles about how Westbrook was better than KD their last season together in OKC. One was posted on here just the other day.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/
Of current players here’s where I have them in the Top 50: LeBron James #3 Stephen Curry #16 Kevin Durant #18 Kawhi Leonard #31 Chris Paul #32 James Harden #37 Russell Westbrook #43 Giannis Antetokounmpo #48
"I think you looking at PED from the wrong angle. Most of the PED aim is not at directly increasing the strength and attributes of an athlete but to shorten the recovery period. Simply put you get less tired and when you do you recover far quicker which allows you to train harder and perform at a higher level. That in turn translates into increased stamina and strength. It is not a magic juice people shoot up and it turns them into Captain America. One of my temmates used to use PEDs and he still sucked, just slightly less. The improvements from using PEDs are relatively miniscule in real world but enough to give you a competitive advantage when you are among best of the best and every little thing counts.  So with your example Steph Curry wouldn't be able to keep the same training regime as the rest of the PED league. His elite shot wouldn't do anything if his defender (of similar level) doesn't tire at the same rate while keeping the same intensity throughout the game. He would simply wear Steph out while being able to stay in front of him due to increased speed and agility from intense training regime a normal Steph wouldn't be able to whitstand. Players in the NBA have up and down games too due to fatigue travel time etc. PEDs would eliminate that.  It would be a massive advantage to any player but like I mentioned it wouldn't turn Brian Scalabrine into LeBron and make him win MVP just like bottom cycler in Tour de France wouldn't win it just because of PEDs. However if Kevin Durant does PEDs but LeBron doesn't it would be very unlikely for LeBron to win MVP. Just like the players you mentioned. A regular Luka Doncic wouldn't be able to win one over a never tiring, stronger and faster LeBron James. Which would be similar to the top of the cream competition in MLB or Cycling. That's what PED do. Give you advantage at the highest level of competition."
Who you taking right now over Kawhi?  LeBron and Kevin Durant would be the only people on that list for me. You got 5?
I used to confuse Kevin Durant for Dwight Howard all the time
"as great as the rockets were offensively l always admired how great they played defensively.. that switching defense with cp3, ariza, tucker, capela, harden, gordon was amazing to watch.. they look awful defensively since.   and like l said, it’s not winning basketball, it only works for so long.. what happens in the postseason when teams KNOW harden is coming up the floor to step back or lob to capela?   he’s prone to sellout performances..  &amp; l understand he ran into golden state, before all of houston gets on me.. he had bad games against utah &amp; minnesota.   but there will never be an excuse for losing on your home floor to them without kevin durant.. curry had **zero** at half."
I think Brandon Ingram is poor mans kevin Durant.
"everyone doesn’t have the luxury of playing with the likes of bogut, draymond, iguodala, klay &amp; kevin durant   to either draw attention away from, set (illegal) screens for, or pass the ball to curry"
Vertically challenged Kevin Durant  Kevin Dur**Ant**
Kevin “Thanos” Durant
"Kevin ""the balance maker"" Durant"
"I'm from Oakland. I've been going to games since the 80's. I think he's a good coach and I was happy they got mjax out of there because his offense was pure unadulterated ass.    He still came into the season with the absolute worst gameplay possible, and when it didn't work he said ""there will be a lot of bad games"". Instead of calling out himself and his own prep.    A good coach adapts to the talent in the team, they don't insert Marquese Chriss into the old sets and pretend his mind range is on part with Kevin Durant  Here's hoping the simplified sets and pnr to get thier best player open continues when Steph comes back, and this doesn't turn into curry setting back screens for Paschal in a few months because he ""likes the looks curry gets for other players"""

"&gt; LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are the only people that fit this criteria currently.  Really? Lebron has always been and will continue to be in another league of elite than Steph or KD. Lebron was literally one of the best players in the league *the day after high school*. Not even Jordan can say that."
Is Furkan Korkmaz a top 10 player?  He finally legitimately looks like Kevin Durant our there. My jaw is dropping at some of his shots he's making
Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant should definitely be on this list.
Depends on situation...     Regular season: Curry  Playoffs &amp; NBA Finals: Kevin Durant
"Andrea bargnani was drafted that high cause of dirk. A lot of european dudes were drafted because they said they were the next dirk. Even dragan bender a recent draft pick and porzingis was considered the next dirk. Never have i heard scouts or analysts call them the next durant, why? Cause dirk REVOLUTIONIZED the shooting big men. Playing against PFs like Tim duncan, Kevin garnett, Chris bosh, Chris webber, Pau Gasol, LA."
"&gt;***Damian Lillard on Warriors' rash of injuries: 'Never seen it'*** &gt;-- &gt; &gt;Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard said he has never seen anything like the rash of injuries the Golden State Warriors have endured dating back to the 2019 NBA Finals. &gt; &gt;""I've never seen it,"" Lillard said in advance of Monday's game against the Warriors. ""I think they might be the first to do a lot of things. At one point they had a starting five of five All-Stars, won 73 games, they've done a lot of great things, made a lot of history. &gt; &gt;""It just seems like adversity has hit hard at this point for them. Those guys aren't old. They'll bounce back from it, but you just hate to see it."" &gt; &gt;Since Game 5 of last year's Finals, during which the Warriors lost All-Star Kevin Durant to an Achilles injury, the rest of their core pieces have gone down with various injuries that have shaken up the NBA. &gt; &gt;Klay Thompson tore his left ACL in Game 6 of the Finals and may miss the entire season. Stephen Curry broke his left hand last week in a loss to the Phoenix Suns and will miss at least three months. Draymond Green tore a ligament in his left index finger and is expected to miss at least a week as he recovers. &gt; &gt;Lillard understands that injuries are part of the game, but like many NBA players, he can't believe how many setbacks the Warriors have dealt with in succession. &gt; &gt;""It's just unexpected,"" Lillard said. ""You don't expect to see them go from being such a huge deal, big super team, to one guy [Durant] leaves and injuries. It's just an unfortunate situation that you hate to see. In that way, it's just different. It's kind of weird to see them not as the Warriors. &gt; &gt;""I feel for the players. You never want to see any of your peers go down with injuries. Klay's a great dude, so it sucks to see him go down that way. Same thing with Steph. ... They'll recover and they'll be back hopefully at 100 percent. That's what we all want to see."" &gt; &gt;Aside from the differences on the floor, Monday's game also marks the first time Lillard, a proud Oakland native, will play inside Chase Center, the Warriors' new billion-dollar arena in San Francisco. As he spoke to reporters following Monday's shootaround, he noted several times just how much different the new arena felt compared to Oracle Arena, the Warriors' home in Oakland for the past 47 years. &gt; &gt;""It's very weird,"" Lillard said. ""It's very weird ... this is extra weird. Because I'm looking around like -- this place has no history. So it's definitely different."" &gt; &gt;Lillard acknowledged that while it was tough not being able to play closer to his home, he was frustrated by the fact that several professional teams are moving out of the Oakland area. The Raiders are expected to move to a brand-new stadium in Las Vegas next season. &gt; &gt;""It just rubs me wrong,"" Lillard said. ""Like I've watched games here [at Chase Center] on TV and the crowd's just not the same. ...The Black Hole is still there. You still see the Nation in support, why would you leave that behind? It's a real sense of pride in Oakland about everything that represents us. &gt; &gt;""It's like the Warriors going across the [Bay] Bridge, the Raiders going to Vegas, it's almost like a money grab. The money moves is kind of pushing the real love and what's really behind these organizations to the side -- which is understandable, and also not understandable because I'm from Oakland. I know both sides [of the situation]. You hate to see it."" &gt; &gt;Lillard noted that he would still remain loyal to the Raiders after they relocate next year, but he didn't hide his feelings about teams leaving Oakland. &gt; &gt;""I don't like it,"" Lillard said. ""If that's what ya'll want to know, I don't like it."""
found Kevin Durant
"I don't think the list has a limit, depending on your definition of ""generational"" talent.   To me, AI and Barkley fit into the category because of how well they've played and how much they punched above their ""weight"" so to say. Isiah Thomas was the closest to AI (many would argue that Thomas was better) but since AI, the closest player to him is Russ, who has his unique place in history. Though Russ never commanded that much attention from opposing teams like AI did. Barely anyone, ever did. Barkley has been one of a kind so far and I hope that Zion can approach that greatness one day.  Both Barkley and AI had forced the NBA to adjust rules because of them. They might not have found the same success as those you mention but I'd add both of them along with Steve Nash. Unique and in some way revolutionary.  Steph, no doubt. He's right now the first of his kind.  Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki are variables of the same. Their individual strengths were spread out in different areas. It's just surprising that they all became all time greats during the same era or generation, if you will. KG was anatural evolution of the late 80's and early 90's big men. Nowitzki was the first modern game ""Unicorn"". Durant is like a mix of both (to an extent).   Kobe is the closest player to MJ there was in pretty much every aspect of their games. That alone is incredible.  Timmy and Hakeem were the embodiment of the perfect big man in their eras. They were generational because they just did everything better than all their peers. Supreme skill and BBIQ."
"[Spears] Omari Spellman yelled “there you go!” Ky Bowman gave a look of pleasant surprise. Damien Lee belted “We got a fucking squad now” and before Jordan Poole hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Durant said “Y’all look so different”"
"By that logic Kevin Durant doesn't make the cut either though, cause he was always a contemporary with Lebron. And I wouldn't feel good about leaving him off the list, and that's kinda the rub, isn't it? It's a *feel* thing. The minute you try and fit it in an objective box, there will be results that feel clearly wrong.  For my money, you can quibble with some of the other names being shot around here, but to me, KG just has to be in."
"I watched his peak, I loved his game. I still think it's pretty wild to put him on a list that ahead of Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, and heck, even guys we don't exactly consider generational like Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade."
"Bro bro I’m a Suns guy, have mercy  [That still doesn’t change that this was written](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/the-best-basketball-player-youve-never-heard-of/)  &gt; About that tag line on this post proclaiming Ricky’s greatness: Is Ricky really better than Greg Oden or Kevin Durant? Good question, and there’s no easy answer because it’s like comparing an apple to an orange to a peach. They’re three completely different players who each have completely different games. Right now the college guys are more developed scoring the ball and have bodies that are more NBA-ready. But Ricky’s getting there. If Ricky was in this summer’s Draft I’d take either Oden or Durant ahead of them. Four years from now when Ricky’s 20? It’s going to be a much harder decision to make"
"I feel like people are underselling what “generational” is supposed to mean.     It means players that you will look back on in 50 years and easily be able to see the mark they left on the NBA.     LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are the only people that fit this criteria currently.     Players such as Harden, Giannis, Kawhi, Davis, Westbrook, those guys are just superstars.      Even in the past you had Kobe and Duncan as generational, but guys like Wade, Dirk, CP3 were just superstars.      There’s a whole lot of MVP’s, championships, and FVMP’s in the non-generational group.     I think Doncic would be very lucky to join the ranks of the superstars above, but the people expecting him to be sitting alongside LeBron and Kobe are taking it too far."
"Yeah... Luka is my dude but come on. Do people know that guys like Kevin Durant, Kawhi, AD etc. were drafted after Lebron?"
&gt; faster and stronger is what separates some average players and some future HOF  Lol what? Using that logic Larry nance jr &gt; Kevin Durant &amp; Kevin Garnett    Skillz errrneah!
Kevin Durant will come to the Lakers because Kyrie can't convince him the earth is flat

7’0 Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant must be sleeping like a baby
can't believe Kevin Durant really was 4'11 this whole time
Kevin Durant out of bounds last year
"Yeah you showed us one game of him, did you saw game 7 of the 2016 finals? Draymond looked like Kevin Durant in that game."
"I remember a podcast Bill Simmons did with Kevin Durant a while back when he asked KD ""Who's on your radar in the coming years to become a superstar in the league?"" and KD replied, ""Booker. He's next up."""
Spencer Dinwiddie and/or Kenny Atkinson won’t be on the team by the time Kevin Durant returns next year.
"Slow down. Which top 6-7 player would he even replace? In no order Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Antepokoumpo, James Harden, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. I've been following him since his Real Madrid days and knew he was a surefire thing but cracking the top 5 is an insane leap so soon even for a player of his caliber."
"Man you really went cherry picking on those stats didn't you. Draymonds best season is the only time he broke 12 ppgs in a season. Ron was putting up 15+ ppg flirting with 19-20 ppgs for like 7 seasons.  Ron Artest through his age 29 season, 562 games played.  16.1/5.1/3.2/2.1/0.6 .422/.342/.723  Draymond Green through his age 29 season, 543 games played.  9/7/4.9/1.4/1.1 .438/.322/.707  Yeah must be hard to lead Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry. I'll give you that Ron is a headcase. But like I said there is a lot of great defense players you could plug into Draymond role and they would have flourished but won't make the hall."
kevin durant was performing better in the playoffs. only reason he stopped was injury  harden dropped 35 ppg against the warriors
Kevin Durant is still a top 3 player imo...
he good  Kevin Durant 2.0 is real
Kevin Durant Venmo-ed his powers to Brandon Ingram for the season
"Best contract in the league: Kenrich Williams. If Ingram is our Kevin Durant, Williams is our Iguodala. And he's so cheap for the Pelicans, it's borderline wage theft.  Worst contract in the league: Probably the ones where the team is still shelling out money despite them not playing for several years. But in terms of active players, I'm going to say Lonzo Ball. Nothing against Ball himself, but he makes 9 M this year, 12 M next year, and then the rookie extension kicks in. For a point guard that doesn't fit perfectly alongside Jrue Holiday, Ball is far too expensive."
I live in Oklahoma City and have been to plenty of restaurants down town where I was told “Yeah James Harden/Kevin Durant/Serge Ibaka/Russell Westbrook just came in/left” and had no idea they came and went.  I saw Russell get food at a deli once and he had sunglasses and a hoodie on and I only knew it was him cuz he paid for everybody’s food in life after him and got into a brand new Range Rover when he left.  Russell Westbrook’s brother is fucking cancer though. I went to UCO with him and he used tell girls “I’m Westbrook’s brother” as the reason they should sleep with him. Lmaoooo
Bill Simmons used to be right a lot.  Here's 3 takes he was early and adamant about:  Kevin Durant would be a generation talent (hardly a popular opinion before the draft and even thru his rookie season)  Russell Wilson had special leadership qualities and was destined for greatness  Trading Harden was a colossal mistake   *I miss good Simmons* lol
"This trade is rightfully ridiculed, especially for the reasons behind the trade, but I always thought the return OKC was a bit underrated. For starters. Harden looked to have all-star potential, not many pegged him to be as good as he turned out. OKC certainly keeps him if they know that. But they have Westbrook and Durant, a guard putting up 17/3.7/4 on good efficiency is expendable with those two.   They received Kevin Martin, who put up 17 the previous and 23 the year before, Jeremy Lamb who was a lottery pick that year who looked to be the player he is now, a future lottery pick (used to pick Adams), another first round pick (used on McGary), and a second round pick. Martin left the following year and Lamb didn't figure things out until a couple years so those two factors really make these deal one sided. But OKC lands a replacement 6th man, a lottery pick, a future guaranteed lottery pick, and another first rounder.   The main issue is they didn't have to make the trade. While not many thought Harden would be this good, he still looked like a future all-star who wanted to be there. If Harden wanted out and that was the return, then you can't fault OKC. But they didn't have to make the trade and aside from Adams, they don't have much to show for it."
"I haven’t listened to the podcast yet, but isn’t the real issue that they decided to pay Ibaka big? It almost became that you had to choose between paying Ibaka or paying Harden, and when they already had their ball dominant star guard to pair with Durant, they decided to put their eggs in the Ibaka potential basket.  There’s also that they got multiple draft picks, Jeremy Lamb who many people thought would develop into an elite shooter in the league, and Kevin Martin who’d been a 20 ppg scorer in the league for like 5-6 prior to that. And I think Martin’s age was also a factor as I’ve read that Presti was looking that all those guys would be on their next contracts before they really hit their prime (age 26-28 seasons), and Martin would be a nice veteran compliment to the Russ/KD duo.  All of that is also on top of that Harden doesn’t develop into the Harden of today if he’s third banana behind Russ and KD. He’d still be great, of course, but he wouldn’t necessarily be historic. He’s not scoring 35+ with the Thunder. He’s not dribbling out the clock until he shoots a 3 or gets fouled if he’s on the Thunder.  It wasn’t a good trade, but it’s only a historically bad one when looked at in hindsight eyes. At the time it wasn’t right but Presti got a great haul back."
OG Kevin Durant comparisons starting to seem less wild now
"Kevin Durant was arguably the primarily factor of Golden State Warriors going though a historically dominant playoff-runs as they ended up a 16-1 winning record. And like I previously mentioned, KD was putting up unreal numbers on much better efficiency while playing better defense against Prime LeBron on a head-to-head matchup during NBA Finals 2017. The Cavaliers were a dominant super team who were steamrolling through Eastern Conference. If KD never joined GSW, the Cavs would've been the favorites to be back-to-back Champs.  I'll give you LeBron as NBA's best player itw during 2018. He outplayed KD in the Finals.  Kawhi Leonard had a better playoff-run than KD in 2019."

Dude getting a contract for at least double what he would've gotten otherwise because he's friends with Kevin Durant.
"&gt; And it's only with hindsight that we can see it as such a horrible decision.  Uhhh, no. That's not true. The majority of people around the league thought it was insane.  [Here's what ESPN said](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-121028/nba-james-harden-trade-thoughts). Obviously they were more measured, but clearly they thought it was a disaster. Some notable highlights from that story:  &gt; Verrier: Bad move. If the mandate was to avoid the new CBA's more draconian luxury tax at all costs, kudos to Sam Presti for his guts and for positioning his club to be in the title picture long-term. But I don't know how OKC can rip a piece away from a young core that was three wins away from a title  &gt; Haberstroh: There's just no two ways about it: The Thunder just lost an Olympian and got very little in return for this season. Kevin Martin is a brittle, one-dimensional player who might be the worst defender at his position. This is about a small-market team seeking future flexibility.  &gt; Verrier: Great move. Daryl Morey had done everything except strap sandwich boards to his ever-growing hoard of assets announcing the Rockets' willingness to deal. Now he has a 23-year-old budding superstar and the flexibility to make more moves down the road.  &gt; Stein: The Lakers and Spurs are unreservedly thrilled right now. They will surely presume that OKC, as presently constituted, is out of the title mix at least for this season. They'll be toasting the Thunder -- instead of doing what we suggested in Question No. 2 about riding out this drama until July if extension terms couldn't be struck -- for deciding to break up the reigning Western Conference champs now in hopes of a better long-term outlook.  &gt; Verrier: Giving up a guy who in the past year became a gold medal-winning member of Team USA, the Sixth Man of the Year, insanely popular and (it appears) a max player doesn't exactly sound like a move made by a team looking to go all-in for this season's title.  [Bill Simmons crushed the move](https://grantland.com/features/the-harden-disaster/) immediately, too. Some highlights from that:  &gt; Forget about worrying whether Harden is a max player (and by the way, he is — 15 teams would have given it to him), or why Harden didn’t play better in the 2012 Finals (um, James Worthy sucked in the 1984 Finals and turned out fine), or if it meant something that Harden didn’t just blindly take less than what he’s worth (when he had already sacrificed minutes, numbers, and shots to succeed on that team). Oklahoma City significantly hindered their chances of winning a title — not just this year, but every year.  &gt; And now, they’ve tossed away their 2013 title chances unless Durant jumps an entire level like LeBron did last spring (unlikely, since LeBron reached a level that we haven’t seen in 20 years) or Ibaka miraculously matures into a game-changing two-way force (a puncher’s chance of a possibility that Zach Lowe broke down on Grantland today). After that, who knows what could happen? Title windows have a tendency of slamming shut when you least expect it.  &gt; In the Thunder’s case, we only knew that they had three of the 20 best guys in the league, all under 25, all of whom loved playing together. There are no sure things in the NBA, but that previous sentence was about as sure as it gets. Less than 100 hours ago, I thought the Thunder were headed for another Finals and another chance at toppling LeBron and Wade. That’s not happening with Jeremy Lamb and Kevin Martin. Instead, they made a different kind of history: becoming the first NBA contender that ever jeopardized multiple titles for financial reasons and financial reasons only. It’s never happened before.  It was almost universally seen as a horrible decision in the moment."
"Even with the benefit of hindsight, I'm not sure it killed a ""potential monster dynasty"".      Kevin Durant shed some light on this topic on ""How Hungry Are You?"" with Ibaka that as young emerging superstar talents, they weren't at a place mentally just to focus on sacrificing to win a championship.   &gt;""All that talent under one roof, you know what I'm saying? We had so many dudes who could do a lot out there, and it's hard to put a 22, 23-year old in a box, and be like, 'you need to do just this, Serge, you only need to rebound and block shots'. Like nah, you can shoot, post-up, you want to do it all. **So it's like you wanna still expand your game, and when you're winning a championship, you gotta minimize yourself just a little bit"".**    So I think you can be a victim of your own success to a point with drafting elite like the Thunder did. These are real people with real egos and personal goals and objectives. We can't just assume that the whole would perpetually be equal to or greater than the sum of its parts."
Good for him. He still didn’t deserve to be getting paid as much as Russell Westbrook and Kevin freaking Durant in 2012 after putting together one of the worst Finals performances I’ve ever seen.
So is james harden and kevin durant and steph curry and lebron and every other star with the ball always in there hand.
The years not over bro. Luka right now is putting up stats close to 09 lebron but he did it over the full season. Luka isn't gonna maintain this pace. He's scoring 30 on 630 ts with 9 assists. That's like prime Kevin Durant scoring with lebron level passing. And he's doing it on low minutes
"10 game sample size, but compared to KD through 4 seasons it’s crazy close  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Brandon+Ingram&amp;player_id1_select=Brandon+Ingram&amp;y1=2020&amp;player_id1=ingrabr01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2011&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players"
He looked unbelievable in the 4th tonight. Serious Kevin Durant vibes.
"Brandon ""Kevin Durant"" Ingram looking like a max player tonight  At this point it's a no-brainer for NOLA to lock him up"

"Harden is volume and doesn't elevate his play in the plays. He's consistent . Plays the regular season like the playoffs. If harden is avg 38 in the season, he's going to need to avg 45 in the PO season lol  Kevin Durant was so efficient, probably the best pure scorer in the league. He could get 17 shots and get like 40 points. Harden in the playoffs has to work a little harder."
"Fair enough   I don't think harden chokes. I just think he isn't as impactful as a LeBron James, kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph curry.   His level of play doesn't elevate in the playoffs. Last yr he avged 36 in the regular season. In the playoffs, it was 31. Usually your stars elevate in the playoffs.   I don't know I can't describe it. When LeBron asserts his will, you feel it. It's like aw shit, a surge is coming. The team feeds off that. In the playoffs, don't get that with harden."
"Yeah it's called playing in the playoffs. The majority of people's numbers go down unless your name is Lebron James or Kevin Durant. He averaged 31/6/6 last year in the playoffs, 28/6/5 the year before and 28/8/5 the year before that but you're talking about him as if he's averaging less than 20 PPG because he doesn't get his bullshit calls. How blind with hate do you have to be to make shit like that up?"

"If he's wide open he has to take it, Westbrook isn't as bad a someone like Andre Roberson.  He just needs to cut the crap with that contested pull-up midrange he likes so much. Like bitch you ain't Kevin Durant, if you gonna drive step on the gas and get to the rack or pass it out."
Bro and honestly Kevin Durant. Those long ass arms make the shooting motion look dummy smooth
He has the body and frame of a Kevin Durant and is also incredibly skilled offensively
"Everyone on this subreddit can bash Kyrie all they want, I really don't give a shit.  I've been a Nets fan since I started following basketball.  I stuck with the Nets after they went 12-70 (14 games back of the 14th seed btw), moved to a different state, traded away all of their future draft picks for old ass KG and Pierce, etc.  This roster is the closest I've ever seen to a championship roster.  To freak the fuck out and hate on Kyrie when we're about 1/6th of the way done with this season and have 3 more seasons of Kyrie and fucking Kevin Durant coming back next season is over-reactionary."
Kevin Durant was basically a one dimensional scorer in the beginning. It took him a while to develop the ball handling and passing and defense. Luka is way more impressive to watch than I remember young KD being.
"Blowing it with all that talent?  How much talent? Was it more than having steph curry, kevin durant, klay thompson, and draymond green? Lmfao"
"1. Kevin Durant    2. Kawhi Leonard   3. James Harden  4. Chris Paul   This was really tough to rank, for the most part they’re interchangeable.  Personally, since KD &amp; Kawhi’s have Finals MVPs/Championships, I have them as my top 2."
Kevin Durant was a huge raptors fan
Shit I forgot to put the list here it is for reference    https://ca.nba.com/news/who-are-the-best-players-in-the-nba-lebron-james-kevin-durant-stephen-curry-giannis-antetokounmpo-james-harden/4qo6gz5ideybzwoq1eacynj0
Kevin Durant.
"We started last season 8-18.  Also, we replaced D'Lo with Kyrie and also replaced several other players.  Last season LeVert was hurt, this season it's LeVert *and* Kevin Durant.  We are missing Kevin Durant.  We are better on paper because we also got Kevin Durant.  But he's not playing.  Neither is Wilson Chandler, not that he's our savior but it hurts us at the 4.  Last year's team had a wholly shitty forgettable season prior to gel together before we became popular on /r/nba before overachieving, but have of this team's personnel changed and they've played 13 games.  They are certainly underperforming so far, but anyone who assumed we were guaranteed a better record this season because of these changes assumed too much too quick, and those assuming our poor start means a guaranteed poor season need only look at last year's 8-18 start.  Maybe this was a huge mistake that Brooklyn will regret, but the only people who are certain of that right now are certain because they have a bias against Kyrie or KD or both, I think."
Some of it is the small market. Some of it probably LeBron.  The same exact thing was said about Kevin Durant and OKC.
I believe they traded him for Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant for the Warriors
Here is Jackie writing about KD in 2017 https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/presents-19619121/where-nba-finals-mvp-kevin-durant-overlooked
"IMO in his prime (more or less from 2006 to 2013) Pau Gasol was indeed a top-10 player, together with LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and Paul Pierce. We are talking about a great player, with 18 seasons in the nba, played more than 1200 games in the regular season, scored almost 21000 points, grabbed more than 11000 rebounds, almost 4000 assists, almost 2000 blocks... He played 3 Finals and won 2 Rings, 4x All-NBA teams selections, 6x All-Star games... With the Spanish National Team he has won 3 medals at the Olympics, won many other medals... Pau Gasol is arguably a top-50 player in the history of the game."

thread so busy no one will see that I’m Kevin Durant
cough cough  Kevin Durant cough
LMA was getting roasted after 2017 he was Reddit’s favorite whipping boy how people forget so soon. Yeah the spurs won but he wasn’t playing up to expectations. There was a big thread on here 2 summers ago of “if you had to pick only 2 players on your roster to keep long term and everybody else has to get dropped who would you keep” and most Spurs fans on their said DeJounte Murray and Kawhi that’s how bad it has gotten   And it was mutual LMA Pop admitted asked for a trade he didn’t like how things were either. Pop literally told him “if I could trade you for Kevin Durant id fly you out on the next flight out of town myself but as long as it’s going to be difficult for us to trade you we might as well try to work things out”. So yes the spurs woulda given up LMA easily. How he was looked at 2 years ago is slot different than he is now
The Kevin Durant top bandwagoner award.
He lost in 2007 with a horrible team. He lost in 2015 with no Kyrie or Kevin love. He lost in 2017 and 2018 to probably the greatest team ever after he beat them in 2016 before they added KEVIN DURANT. Don't act like there isn't context behind some of those losses and stop treating them all like the mavs series
You can't really judge the Nets off this season. They have Kevin Durant coming next year.
"Kevin Durant , John Wall , Klay Thompson and Steph Curry."
"Lol nice changing of the goalposts. and TIL that kevin durant and PG aren't shooters.  &gt;Also I don't care Lmaooooo  ""I was proven so wrong on every account that I'm going to change the argument and pretend like I don't care even though I made this thread and commented on it dozens of times"""
No. Look at their past 10 years. This is like the first time they shouldn’t be worried. And they’re getting Kevin fucking Durant.
they dont have Kevin Durant yet   No
"""revisionism""  From 2010:  ""In terms of what Carmelo brings to the party, the answer is simple: scoring. It's what he does, he does it pretty well, but it's all he does.  Yes, I said just ""pretty well.""  Carmelo Anthony had one of the best seasons of his career in 2009-10, finishing third in the league in scoring with 28.2.  Sounds good, no?  No.  Carmelo is a volume scorer. He can get hot, but he's not terribly efficient.  Among just NBA small forwards, Anthony ranked 13th in field goal percentage. You read that correctly, 13th. He finished behind not just LeBron and Kevin Durant, but also Luol Deng, Rudy Gay, Gerald Wallace, and more.  Each of those players named scored over 17 points per game. Make Luol or Gerald the featured player in an up-tempo offense, and you would have to think that they could score around 28 as well.  Anthony is also just plain bad behind the arc. His 31 percent mark put him at 48th among small forwards. Wouldn't you ban him from taking three-point shots at that point?  Okay, Anthony scores pretty well. He can put on the occasional amazing scoring display, but overall, he's not terribly efficient. Are we sure that's all he brings to the party?  You betcha.  His rebounding numbers (right around 6 per game for his career) are in the ""incidental contact"" range. An NBA player who stands 6'8"" can pick up six boards a game by accident. Especially on a free-shooting team like the Nuggets where rebounding opportunities abound. Gerald Wallace, LeBron, and Luol Deng all outperform 'Melo in this area.  How about assists? Again, just fifth among small forwards. His three per game do not stand out as a strength.  Double-doubles? Nope. Again just fifth, again behind Gerald Wallace, Durant, LeBron, and Luol Deng.  How about defense? Carmelo Anthony does not have, nor he has ever had, the reputation as a ""lock-down"" defender. He is just starting to look like he's working on improving his body (dropping the baby fat), but he does not have elite strength or speed. Anthony has also not shown the simple desire to shut down the opposing team's best perimeter player."""
We are all Kevin Durant.
"No the trade was bad at the time. People respect Pop and (to a much lesser extent) hate the Lakers so they didn't pan the trade. DeMar flaws were widely known then.  Saying DeMar is a perrenial all-star sounds nice but isn't great. It's possible that if DeMar had played in the west instead of the east he would have never made an all-star team -- I mean Mike Conley has never been an all-star and is probably as good as DeMar.  It's correct that Pop traded for established talent instead of potential, but when you're trading a superstar away you're always losing the trade so that only way to make up for it is to gamble a bit and instead he played it safe. He wasn't going to contend with DeMar and Poetl so he should have 100% went for potential.  He's getting criticized harder now because with the way things are panning out now the trade looks horrendous. One could even argue that if they let Kwahi walk for NOTHING. They could have been better because they could have made a play at free agents who are better than DeMar like Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant or other free agents that might be comparable but have higher upsides like D'Angelo Russell and Tobias Harris. DeMar being under contract for years isn't necessary an asset at ALL."
"Kevin Durant played against Kevin Willis  Kevin Willis played against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played against Richie Guerin  Richie Guerin played against Red Rocha  Red Rocha debuted in the second season of the BAA, a year earlier than Wanzer"
Chris paul was great a couple years ago against the kevin durant warriors in the playoffs. If he didn't get hurt before that game seven who knows what could have happened.
TIL I'm Kevin Durant.
It is widely known that all of Reddit's users are just alts of the same lonely person: Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant also couldn’t beat the Grizzlies in 2013 by himself. Turns out basketball is a team game

Yep. my friends and i always discussed what the league would have been like if the blazers took Kevin Durant instead of Oden. Him and Roy would have terrorized the league
"That’s crazy. The one that really gets me is Kevin Willis. He played from 1984-2007, which means he played against Durant and LeBron but also Dr. J, Kareem, Bird, Magic, etc.   So he played before the globalization of the NBA began, all through the Lakers era, the Jordan era, the Shaq and Kobe era and into the modern NBA.   Absolutely blows my mind."
"For the same reasons the Timberwolves didn't want Steph Curry and the Blazers didn't want Kevin Durant. Sometimes you just don't know how good a guy truly is until it's too late.   I think they'll be okay though, they got a pretty good PG instead"
What a mess. Bad turnovers. Both teams playing volleyball at the rim. Bricks.....a whole lotta bricks. Was honestly fun to watch though.   Montrezl Harrell and Chris Paul were the only two guys who could generate offense. Chris did it baiting defenders into dumb fouls. Harrell just did it as the GOAT garbagemen around the rim. Type of game it was.   Typical OKC game when they play a good team. Come out play well in the first half. Other team goes on a run in the 3rd takes the lead. Keep it close find a way to come up just short in the end. Paul George showed how he’s the closest thing to Kevin Durant with that play at the end(Doc calls it’s the “Paul George” play) always being able to get a shot off at the end. Chris Paul has 49 points on 21 shots the past 2 games. Don’t waste his last years on a non contender
Ay P I said I’m the next Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant is probably the most unguardable scorer in basketball history. He's a 7 footer who is super athletic with a jump shot that can't be blocked. And the difference between their play styles is that Harden has to rely on bailout foul calls in most games while Durant plays a much more exciting flow of the offense style approach. You expect every Durant shot to go in, while that is not the case with Harden"
"I honestly don’t know exactly what Luka would have to do to surpass Dirk as GOAT in my book. Cuz Dirk didn’t just lead us to a ring, he fucking destroyed Kobe and the Lakers, then bested Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook (on the same fucking team!), then just went Disney Sports Movie on LeBron, Wade, and Bosh. Add his fucking fever game in that series and you got a hell of a mountain to climb if you wanna beat that. I’d say if Luka gets 2 rings for Dallas, he’d definitely be on par with Dirk imo."
Kevin Durant hooks arms. So does Kyle Lowry. Harden is far from the only player in the league to do this.
This year was always going to be a wash year for the Nets. When Kevin Durant comes back next season the Nets are going to look completely different.   You also get the benefit of a better draft pick too.
"LeBron left Cleveland twice, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Paul George (once from Indy and once from OKC), Kevin Garnett, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Deron Williams   I could think of more probably"
He missed 5 free throws in game 6. The Rockets lost by 5 points.  He has 6 turnovers and 5 assists.  This happened without Kevin Durant on the floor.
"Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
Kevin Durant in a Supersonics jersey would be dope.
Kris “Kevin Durant” Dunn
Fucking everytime I see people on here trying to psychoanalyze Kevin Durant based off of random snippets they hear about him
Kevin Durant has initials
Kevin Durant?
They should send one to Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.
"If all primes, almost unbeatable.  If prime, the only thing I think that can match up against this is Penny Hardaway, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Arvydas Sabonis... all in their primes. Yes I think Hakeem can play PF against Davis."
Google isn’t hard to use [bud](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kevin-durant-height-tall-6-foot-10-nba-crackdown/517490)
for a big super team i'd want   - PG - LeBron James - SG - Paul George - SF - Kevin Durant - PF - Giannis Antetokounmpo - C - Anthony Davis  this team is huge and they can do it all. they'd be unstoppable. passing windows would be so damn small lol.
Just ask Kevin Durant.
Ill add injured players (KD and Curry would both be top 3 from when I last saw them)  1: Steph Curry  2: James Harden  3: Kevin Durant  4: LeBron James  5: Kawhi Leonard  6: Giannis Antetokounmpo  7: Anthony Davis  8: Joel Embiid  9: Luka Doncic  10: Paul George (Lillard an unlucky 11th)
"**TLDR: Here are some players that I think are comparable when accounting for defense, but perhaps I am weighing in defense more than others might.**  Harden has had these numbers (roughly 30/6/7) for about 5 years now on subpar to average defense.  So, last 30 years?  LeBron James 2004 - 2010 had excellent offensive seasons with excellent defense for 6 years (roughly 28.5/7/7)  Hakeem 1988-1995 (roughly 24/12/2.5 plus much more blocks and steals) did it for 7 years.  Kobe Bryant 2000-2008 (roughly 28/5.5/5.5) did it for 8 years.  Shaq from 1993-2003 (roughly 28/11/3 plus much better defense) did it for 9 years.  Kevin Durant from 2009-2014 (roughly 29/7/3.5) did it for 5 years with arguably slightly lower offensive prowess but slightly higher defensive prowess.  Tim Duncan from 1999-2009 (roughly 20/11.5/3 on Hall of Fame defense) did it for 10 years.  You get the point.  I think that Harden had better offensive seasons than all the players I listed above, but when you factor in the defense I think these players are in the discussion.  But perhaps I am weighing defense more than others might, so there's that."
Kevin Durant signing with the Warriors in 2016 was a meme/joke for months online until he actually did it.
Kevin Durant. Done nothing to help his team and that cap hit is yikes
"Just cause you’re in the NBA doesn’t mean you’ve maximized your vertical leaping ability. Kevin Durant couldn’t bench 185 coming into the league, which most average high school varsity football kids could clear. I really doubt Jeremy Lin is deadlifting and squatting heavy, I really doubt he’s absolutely maximized his vertical leap."
"&gt;CHOKE TO CLOSE series after KD got injured lmao  I think you are certainly understating how good the Warriors could be without Kevin Durant. Should the Rockets probably have won that series after KD went out looking at it on paper? Sure. But the core starters without KD have already proven themselves to be top notch NBA players. Curry, Klay, Draymond, and Iggy.  Not to mention Looney always plays absurdly great against the Rockets. That is still an insanely talented roster with a core that has won a championship, even without Durant.  The playoff exit to the Warriors isn't Hardens fault in the least bit, you're just a simple minded hater that parrots r/nba's narrative. The reason the Rockets lost was because their defense was absolute garbage in the last couple of games. The biggest point of emphasis on the losses were that the Rockets were incapable of getting defensive stops that let the Warriors keep rolling. To put sole blame on him is pretty ignorant, the only playoff appearance you could ever blame him on was when he gave up against the Spurs and that was years ago with a completely different team."
Kevin Durant. He came out of college having lost in the NCAA tournament his freshman year so there wasnt a lot of championship expectations but everyone knew he was going to be a problem on the court that nobody has ever seen before and he lived up to that.
Imagine thinking Kevin fucking Durant was made by Curry...lol people give Curry credit for KD dropping 35 a game on 70 TS%
their numbers feel underwhelming considering they’re kevin durant and james harden. not average in terms of regular players
"If it’s 20 year old michael jordan you get 2 more years onto his career assuming he doesn’t retire early. This could add even more rings and he could have #1 all time scoring which further cements his status as goat.   Plus in this scenario you still get a first round pick for the next 10 years anyways where you have a chance to draft anyone good that hasn’t been a first overall pick like Michael Jordan, James Harden, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant etc."
How are they supposed to replicate any of Kevin Durant?
"Who cares about making it to the playoffs if your best result is a low seed and early exit? Literally the worst place to be, it's NBA purgatory.  Are you seriously trying to use the warriors as an example of a team that hadn't adopted a 3pt shooting philosophy? And fwiw, their best mid-range player was Kevin freaking Durant. Go ahead and replicate that, good luck."
"Lol probably cause he was injured, his team was injured, and the 2nd best player on that team was Brandon Ingram lmao. And remind me of the players he beat in the West in his final runs. Here, I got you: Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson. Let’s not forget he also beat KG, Paul Pierce, and Allen in the East when he was with miami."
Kevin Durant names Sombra the best hacker in the league
How about the cocksuckers in the anti doping federation fucking drug test physical monsters like Lebron or a recovering Kevin Durant? Fucking pussies are afraid of catching the stars with illegal substances so they go after journeymen.
In my head anybody who isn't a fan of Kevin Durant has never played a competitive sport in their life.
shhhh it's ok  bad man can't get you anymore  also it's wild how many Cavs fans now parade Bron's achievements in Miami after he left you the first time. I guess winning really does cure everything. I guess winning really does cure everything  And Kevin Durant has won a lot. Especially against Cleveland.
In my head anybody who is a fan of Kevin Durant has never played competitive sports in their life
2010 was a good example of this as well:  Kevin Durant  Derrick Rose  Russell Westbrook  Andre Iguadala  Steph Curry  Kevin Love  Those guys were all decidedly better in the next season
That’s what happens when you get on your knees and beg Kevin Durant to join your team because you aren’t confident in your own abilities
"Off the top of my head Barkley would be removed to make room for Iverson, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Dwayne Wade, Nowitski, Pau Gasol, Paul Pierce, Dwight Howard, Kobe, Ray Allen, Durant, Steph, Klay, Duncan, Leonard, Ginobili, Tony Parker and others if I felt like taking a closer look into it."
"What the fuck?  First of all, the Warriors beat the Thunder in 2016 because Steph clapped KD’s cheeks to the tune of 30+ in each of the final three games.  Curry is actually not that bad at defense, you would know this if you watched a game once in a while.  But like I said, dumbasses will bring up defense and act like it matters if a guy’s impact is 50/50 defense/offense or 90/10 defense/offense or 10/90 defense/offense.  Are you not understanding what I’m saying or can you just not read??  Let me spell it out for you: Stephen Curry is more impactful on a basketball court than Kevin Durant.  At this point in LeBron’s career, with his defensive impact at an all-time low, I would say that Steph is likely the most impactful player in the game.  Giannis is up there, KD is up there, probably higher than Giannis, Jokic is up there...but I digress.  Kevin Durant is probably the most gifted scorer of all time.  He’s an incredible scorer, he has the total package.  He’s a very unique player, it’s just that Steph is...well, more unique.  Steph’s shooting ability simply breaks the game—it makes everyone on the court much better and no one else in the league is in the same realm (that’s a fact btw, Steph raised his teammates TS% by 8.0 in 2017 for example).  I don’t know what you think when you think offense, but that speaks for itself.  I mean, this is a man who can playmake without the ball in his hands.  Kyrie and Lillard are not even close to the same level that Steph is at, I think we both know that.  Also, please don’t bring Harden into a discussion about two great players, that’s just a joke."
"Because listed heights and weights aren't updated 24/7 if you would pay any attention at all. Most of the time they don't even change them after their rookie year. They still got KD at 6'9""... Embiid still at 250. Like you seriously gonna tell me that Embiid and Jokic only weight 10 pounds more than Kevin Durant?"
"I absolutely think that trading Paul George was the right thing to do.  This generation of people are stuck in ""Now"" that you cannot even see that the Thunder are in the best position in the NBA, I wouldn't trade places with any other team!  You lack long term vision.  KD was the easy target to call lucky, but what about Russ#4 pick, Harden#3, and Oladipo #2 pick.  They were not the obvious choice.  You need to stop your sloppy bitching and putting off negative energy about this rebuild.  Go cry into a pillow or something.  I couldn't be happier with the things worked out and short sighted people won't be able to see it until it happens.  If you want to talk about Kevin Durant, why not talk about Emoni Bates?  Do you even know who this kid is?  Do players have to make the All-Star team before you know who they are???"
"100% agree on the efficiency.  Dantley had a higher TS% than Kevin Durant and he took no 3 pointers (midrange and iso drives, kinda like Melo).  So that makes him more one-dimensional right? Haha, I actually wasn't sure what the OP was asking (or was he just trying to bash Melo)?  I actually looked more into the stats, and it's amazing how close their counting stats are  Melo (per game): 24.0 PPG / 6.5 RPG / 3.0 APG / 1.0 SPG / 0.5 BPG Dantley (per game): 24.3 PPG / 5.7 RPG / 3.0 APG / 1.0 SPG / 0.2 BPG  Both also had a reputation around the league as ball-stoppers/iso scorers/terrible defenders.  Ironically, Dantley played his last game at age 34.  If Melo doesn't come back, his last game will also be at age 34.  Both also dropped off a ton near the end of their careers.  Dantley was in the Finals as the leading scorer with the Pistons, then Isaiah kicked him out for Aguire/Rodman, Pistons go on to win 2 Finals, and Dantley is out of the league soon after."
"Harden, LeBron, and maybe a healthy and motivated Kevin Durant."
"So, a few things: 38 games is actually a majority of the season for him, he only played 72, and it’s not like I cherry picked, he basically had a first half and second half like you mentioned.  I know players don’t always improve volume and efficiency, but as I said originally, rookies, especially rookies of the year often improve both.   Kevin Durant went from 29 points per 100 possessions on 52% true shooting to 33 points per 100 possessions and 58% true shooting his 2nd season.   Lebron: 28 points/100 possessions to 34, and 49% true shooting to 55.4%  KAT: 28.8 to 34.5 and 59% to 61.8%  Damian Lillard: 25.9 to 29.2 and 54.6% to 56.8%  Anthony Davis: 25.5 to 30.8 and 55.9% to 58.2%  I think a 23/8/7 stat line on 58% true shooting is certainly in the realm of possibility for Luka next year. If anything, rebounding might go down with KP and Delon Wright playing."
" I miss the old Kyrie    The straight up cold Kyrie    I miss the cross you up and watch your ankle roll Kyrie    I hate the new Kyrie    Just good for shoes Kyrie    Like LeBron, Kevin Durant about to use Kyrie"
"&gt;Honestly, I do think your defense will be fine, but guards will absolute feast on the P+R, especially considering that Stevens drops back on all P+R's already.  It won’t be as bad as you think, like I said Brad Stevens has had top 10 defenses with IT and Jared Sullinger in the starting lineup.   Outside of Kemba, pretty much the rest of the team is extremely switchable.   &gt;You keep on saying I'm parrotting Reddit opinions, but believe it or not there are other knowledgable r/nba users who actually watch the game. And Kanter doesn't pass the eye test or put up good defensive stats, he will probably improve your rebounding though.  You commented this as if I’m arguing is a great or even good defensive player, he just isn’t as bad as his reputation is. Yes, he’s bad in the pick and roll and doesn’t really block shots but he can easily body up down low which is something the Celtics haven’t had in a while. If the other team is killing us with the pick and roll Stevens can throw out Theis, Robert Williams, Vincent Poirer, or even go small with Grant Williams or Semi and stop that bleeding immediately.   &gt;You also said the offense might improve next season if Hayward comes back to form, but without Horford's passing and general BBIQ I find that hard to see.   Hayward’s IQ is just as good if not better than Horfords offensively. Their offensive efficiency was 111.3, and that was with a heavy ISO system compared to what Brad Stevens usually runs with at least. I’d bet the offense improves pretty significantly, with a dip in defense.   &gt;You didn't explicitly state that the Net's young players wont improve, but you did say we're close to our ceiling, saying that perennial 2nd round exits is the best the Nets will muster.   Right, I didn’t say the Nets players won’t improve, so you arguing against that is foolish. You saying “you didn’t explicitly state that” as if I didn’t outright say it but implied it is also dumb.   &gt;Those were your words in your hypothetical Nets future. However, I believe if LeVert and Allen do become the players I hope they become then ceiling isn't even close to what we see now.  There’s really no base to that sentence though. You can say that about any team.   &gt;And yes the Nets were supposed to be tanking for the foreseeable future. Last year we were projected to be around the Knicks level. If you think that's hyperbole just look it up. Hell, even halfway through last season when we had a 10 game losing streak half the Nets fanbase were clamoring for the front office to start tanking.   I was criticizing your claim that people said the Nets would be tanking for the foreseeable future **with no good players** hence why I bolded it. I know nobody projected the Nets to be as good as they were last year, and I wasn’t arguing that.    &gt;There was no stand out player on the Nets roster, other than LeVert and Russell and literally nobody was expecting them to make the playoffs.   You just went from **no good players** to two stand out players, that’s my point, the Nets had young talent from drafting and trading smart.   &gt;Before the season, Bill Simmons jokingly said LeVert wouldn't crack the 10 man rotation on the Celtics and he was our best player and it wasn't even that crazy of a notion.  Bill Simmons is notorious for having abysmal takes at times, the fact you’re even including this shows that you’re grasping at straws.   &gt;And I don't fully believe this, but the Celtics could potentially get worse.   I believe it, if you mean from what they were last year. They’re objectively a worse team. But they still haven’t reached their ceiling, that hangs on the potential of mainly Tatum, and Brown, but also Robert Williams, Semi, and the loaded rookie class we seem to have.  But you could argue this for literally any team in the league so this comment was pretty redundant.    &gt;Hayward might never become his best self, so that's a waste of max money.   That wouldn’t make us worse though, he’s already not his best self so him returning as the same player doesn’t make us worse, that makes no sense.   &gt;You guys have 5 players who are their best with the ball in their hands Kemba-Brown-Tatum-Hayward-Kanter.   You need to stop over exaggerating to prove your points, if you’ve ever watched a single Celtics game last year, you wouldn’t say Brown or Hayward are necessarily at their best when the ball is in their hands, and even if you say that for Hayward it’s because he can create for others.   You could make the exact same argument for the Nets as well btw.   Kyrie-LaVert-Kurocs-Durant-Allen and even Dinwiddie, I could apply your same logic here. It just isn’t correct.  &gt;It's Brown's contract year so he'll definitely want to start and get his stats.   If you paid attention even a little bit last year you’d know Jaylen Brown did nothing but accept a bench role last year, I can assure you that won’t happen. There’s no base to that claim, not to mention as far as to say it’s a “definite”.  &gt;Tatum might still have that iritating knack of taking contested long step back twos.   Which he did last year, so how does that make the Celtics worse? You see how that doesn’t make sense right?   &gt;Kemba's never truly elevated his teammates.   Sure he has, he was on the least winningest team in NBA history and brought them to the playoffs two years later.   &gt;This is a purely negative outlook,   Most of which didn’t even apply to be fair, do we really want me to write up a negative outlook on how the Nets season and future could go bad with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant."
Ah yes. The Brazilian Kevin Durant
Westbrook has Kevin Durant all those years.  Paul George went to the ECF in 13 &amp; 14 and put up a fight against LeBron
"No. Game was meaningless, I mean no elimination or anything. 22 years old Kevin Durant had broken our hearts pretty hard tho."
"I disagree with all of those.  Sure he can jump higher, it it an appreciable advantage in a halfcourt 3 on 3? I don't think so.  One of these players has been All Defense 3 times. The other one is Kevin Durant."
"I have Draymond Green, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Kevin Durant ahead of him last year. [Source]( http://bkref.com/tiny/FIq8j).  This search was for players not designated as guards for 2018-19 season qualifying for MPG leaderboard."
"I really do think Larry Bird is one of the 5 greatest players of all time, but he’s not better at getting a shot than Kevin Durant, sorry. Everything else? Yeah for sure, but just getting a bucket? It’s KD and CP3 guards him at an average to above average level. 08 CP3 was leading the league in steals as well, if there’s one chink in the armor for Bird, it’s that his handle wasn’t that tight. CP3 would be feasting"
Dont forget about lebron winning it a posession earlier by drawing the charge on kevin durant and then the refs inexplicably challenging the play based on his feet position (his feet were clearly 2 feet outside the restricted area).  There was so much wrong with the last minute of the 4th quarter.  I hate that JR smiths brainfart is all people remember
"I've heard Kevin Durant comes in here sometimes. Real stand up guy, great guy. Great player too"
"What if I told you that if you have kevin durant on your team, you need to learn to play well off the ball?"
"What if I told you that if you have kevin durant on your team, you need to learn to play well off the ball?"
"Steph isn’t a top 10 passer of all time. I’m not even sure he’s a top 10 passer in today’s game. His passer rating last year is actually equal to Kevin Durant at 6.8.  Durant is a great wing creator, he’s an excellent passer, and he can defend 4 positions when locked in. He’s a premier shot blocker at either forward spot too.   Durant has been the engine of 4 historic OKC offenses in the last decade. When Westbrook went down, he kept the thunder at a 65 win pace in a facilitator role as the ONLY ball handler on the team.  Durant is a superior 5v5 player than curry.  If curry + 4 all stars has the same net rating as Curry + 4 bench players, then next year I expect curry to win 60 games. You’re not using net rating correctly, matchups, roles, replacements, etc, need to be contextualized."
[Curry actually beats Durant in RPM](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm)  [Curry](https://www.bball-index.com/player/stephen-curry/) also beats [Durant](https://www.bball-index.com/player/kevin-durant/) in almost every impact stat/grade according to Basketball Index
Kevin durant and offset
[Lebron James' Defense vs Kevin Durant in the 2012 NBA Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQHTwWUyCXo)
"well let's put it this way.... the guy can shoot 3s with the best of them think of the kyle korvers, ray allens, steph currys etc  but he also had unreal athleticism to go along with that long range shooting which is actually very rare to see in guys that can shoot that well.  but then he also had a pretty decent ball handling skills to get to the basket.  This sounds a lot like a guy named Kevin Durant to me.   The difference is that a guy like Durant had the motivation to be among the greats. JR on the other hand probably was just happy he made it to the league with more money to burn some green trees and nothing else."
What if he changed his name to TheNext Kevin Durant though?
"Bro he had James Harden, Serge Ibaka and Kevin Durant as his teammates at one point and still took the same shots"
Kevin Durant has a better shot and Garnett is better down low and with the post.
"Let's be honest...a core of D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Claris LeVert, and Jarrett Allen was never winning a title.  The Nets, like every other team in the league who wants to win a title, had to try and piece together a team led by superstar talent such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. If signing DeAndre Jordan to a slightly inflated contract is the price for getting two superstars, then that's a price you pay.  Carmelo on a minimum deal is fine.  If he or his attitude sucks you move on.  I have my doubts as to whether he would be willing to take on a much smaller role, but if he were to understand he'd be used as a little used scorer off the bench, I could see him providing a little value.  If the Nets never become a contender it will be because Durant is never the same player again.  It has nothing to do with Jordan getting $10 million a year.  In fact, he's going to have the 119th highest salary in the NBA next year.  The players just above him in salary are Tomas Satoransky, Norman Powell, Josh Richardson, George Hill, Dwight Powell, Jermey Lamb, and Dante Exum.  Jordan, who is an upgrade over Ed Davis, will have as big of an impact as most of those guys.  He might fall off in the last year of the deal, but I think $10 million is a fair price for at least the next two seasons."
Than he literally is Kevin Durant.
Obvious hometown bias by you. Steph's average in the finals is inflated by that 40+ point game where he scored many of his points in garbage time. He wasn't even the 3rd best player in that series.   &gt; but what does Kawhi do better than Kevin Durant?  He averaged a higher ppg in the season and he was actually available in the playoffs when his team needed him? KD loses points for missing 50% of his team's playoffs games.
"i never said anything about solving the NBA, for one. the warriors solved the NBA by recruiting kevin durant to create the most stacked roster in league history.  it's very basic thinking here. use your head. they went to game 7 of the WCF against the most loaded team ever after a 65-win regular season. but you seriously think that it's reasonable to say ""oh their style can't win championships."" i'm not sure why it's taking so long for you to understand how incredibly stupid that logic is."
"Steph averaged 31 in the finals on a depleted team after being top 2 in PIPM in the regular season for the 5th consecutive year. He also averaged the most point per game (37.5) in a 4 game sweep in the WCF.   Giannis was a monster on the best team in the league.   Harden had the best scoring rate in a long time on elite efficiency.   Kawhi missed 20 games and even so was slowing down. He was helped by his team getting hot at the right time. If Klay doesn’t get hurt I’m not sure the Raptors  win. He’s an elite iso scorer, but he doesn’t make his teammates better on offense, and his defense has fallen off from what the public still perceives as elite defense. I know Kawhi is the flavor of the weak, but what does Kawhi do better than Kevin Durant?"
Yeah if only Kevin Durant got injured they could have beaten the Warriors \s
"Bruh , if Kevin Durant wants to come to your team u unquestionably make room. Presti would definitely find a way."
What if brandon ingram changed his name to kevin durant though
"There are pictures of Ben Wallace presenting Draymond with the DPOY award, he's the exact same height as Draymond at 6'7  The man is as 6'9 as Kevin Durant, there is barely any difference between Big Ben and Rip Hamilton height wise"
When an nba team finally fucking uses bjellica properly he's going to be very good. They treat him like he's steve Novak when he's much more like  an unathletic poor man's kevin Durant
How in the world is that exactly what happened to the Knicks? The nets kept all their talent but basically added Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in place of D'Angelo Russell.
"Lmao bruh none of those guys you listed really moves the needle for the Nets except Kemba who might get them a couple seeds higher but doesn't solve their issue of lacking a starting SF  Kevin Durant (however much of a thin-skinned cupcake he is) is one of the best volume scorers to ever play, I don't see any of those other guys reaching his level  The Nets would be insane to turn down a chance to sign a future first ballot Hall of Famer still in his prime.  The Achilles injury obviously is bad, but KD isn't overly reliant on his explosiveness, the jump shot will still be there and he is still 7ft tall."
"Delly has 38.1% career three point percentage, better than Kevin Durant, LeBron James AND Trenton Hassell   And he has reinvented his shot, NEVER SETTLE, allowing him to shoot a mind boggling 60% from 3 over his last 1 games"
"His play style lead to those injuries. He contorted his body to hesitate the defender and get off funky floaters, layups, and  passes so many times going against bigger guys then being asked to guard the other teams best player even if its Kevin Durant."
&gt;If Kevin Durant had Steve Nash as his point guard for 19 seasons  That team wins 6 titles at minimum.

"I agree with a lot of this, I don't think Kawhi's playmaker is quite as good as you. Also I don't think Lebron was the best player this last year. Now is Kawhi better than Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Giannis Antetokounmpo? Depends on the day. ""The best player in the world"" is something Nike invented to sell shoes because they were only paying one athlete at the time. There are so many different skills that can affect the game in so many different ways I making tiers out of groups"
"A very very long career.  The combination of how good Malone was plus the INSANE rarity of their length of time spent together is the main factor.  If Kevin Durant had Steve Nash as his point guard for 19 seasons  Nash would be in this same argument where Stockton is, but the reality is that all-time scorers and perennial all star point guards do not play on the same team for 19 years ever."
"Durant’s career at the top is over. No one comes back from achillies tears, especially a player with chronic foot problems like him.   You’re not going to discuss passing/facilitating because you got caught in a lie. SRS is a non box score stats that measures the offensive engine of a player relative to league wide offensive rating. Durant kept thunder at a 65 win pace as the sole ball handler on the team. No draymond green, no Curry, no Westbrook.....  Defensive metrics don’t take into account anything. It’s basically luck adjusted on/off.   RAPM has multi-Colinearity issues ( it has Steph top 3 in D-RAPM 4 years)  Here’s an article On NBA.com/advanced stats that Contextualizes Durant’s defense.  https://stats.nba.com/articles/the-importance-of-kevin-durants-defense/"
"Are you 6’6-6’8? Are your arms long? You’re the next Kawhi Leonard.   Are you 6’9+, have long arms and can shoot at an okay level? You’re the next Kevin Durant.   Are you a wing player who has a crafty playstyle? You’re the next James Harden."
"I’m a huge kd fan, I literally only open threads where his name is mentioned.   I don’t browse nba new, I browse nba new Kevin Durant/KD"
Kevin Durant
"With all due respect, you just made a lot of stuff up. Kevin Durant is a Great defender. He’s a high a end shot blocker from either forward spot and can cover 4 positions while holding his own. He’s also pseudo rim protector that covers everyone’s weakness.  You say that Durant hasn’t been the pioneer of some elite offenses in the past decade but that is also factually incorrect. Durant + Westbrook led 6 top 5 offenses since 2009.  When Westbrook was injured in 2013, Durant took a facilitator role and kept the thunder at a 66 win pace (with a SRS of 9.9)  Here’s an excerpt from backpacks Top 40-  “Durant ramped up his playmaking, spearheading the offense as OKC rolled to a 65-win pace (9.2 SRS) “  Durant is a better passer than curry as well, he had a high passer rating last year. So you literally just lied about the mountain of data.    All I’m saying is that Impact metrics measure relative value. Durant had a higher RPM than curry every year until Steve Kerr/draymond came along.  Curry and draymond aren’t better players because their PIPM says so, they’re just in a system that accentuates their value more so then another system would. Durant probably doesn’t hold the same value curry does on golden state, but on any other roster he’d have higher impact metrics (as we’ve seen since 2013).  You’re not using the impact metrics the correct way, and you literally just lied about Durant not being the engine of elite offenses (was the engine of 4 historic offenses in OKC).   If yo"
Delly has a career 3 point percentage of 38.1% which is higher than the following players:.     - Kevin Durant.  - Paul George.  - Dirk Nowitzki
Because Kevin Durant is better than Harrison Barnes.
Yeah let’s ignore that they also had Kevin Durant in 2 of those
"PG: Kevin Johnson  SG: Kevin Martin  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Kevin Love  C: Kevin Garnett  Some of these guys are playing out of position but for some reason Kevins like playing the PF (KG, KLove) instead of the C spot."
"[Shea Serrano did this a couple of years back](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/7/7/16077712/nba-first-name-game-e1a2249dcab0)  &gt;The Winners: The Kevins   &gt;   &gt;They’re the only team where every player is (a) a multiple-times All-Star, while also (b) possessing the type of game that would do perfectly fine in today’s NBA. You’ve got Kevin Johnson (three-time All-Star, five-time All-NBA second- or third-team pick). You’ve got Kevin McHale (seven-time All-Star, All-NBA first team in 1986–87, six-time All-Defensive first- or second-team pick, two-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner, three-time NBA champion). You’ve got Kevin Garnett (15-time NBA All-Star; MVP in 2003–04; nine-time All-NBA first-, second- or third-team pick; Defensive Player of the Year in 2007–08; 12-time All-Defensive first- or second-team pick; four-time league leader in rebounds, NBA champion). You’ve got Kevin Durant (MVP in 2013–14, eight-time NBA All-Star, seven-time All-NBA first- or second-team pick, four-time NBA scoring champion, NBA champion, Finals MVP). And you’ve got Kevin Love (a four-time NBA All-Star, two-time All-NBA second-team pick, the league leader in rebounds and Most Improved Player in 2010–11, and an NBA champion who is somehow the weakest link of the group). The Kevins are dusting everyone."
\#14 fucked up with the reach instead of moving his feet but what a shot by Iranian Kevin Durant
The Warriors didn't have Kevin Durant for an elimination game and Andre Iguodala (in '18) before Paul's injury.
Don't compare Harden to Durant; Kevin Durant doesn't rely on refs and he's incredibly efficient unlike Harden who just shot chucks 3s.
"I agree that the Rockets have been more dependent on Harden, especially to have the ball in his hands. That’s what happens when one team adds Kevin Durant. I’m not saying Curry would put up the same stats Harden has because what he did last season was insane, but it’s a pretty obvious concept that with less scoring power around him he’s going to have to shoot and handle the ball more leading to a higher volume of stats."
Kevin Durant is pretty strong for how slim he is. He backs dudes down in the post a lot
You can get a whole Kevin Durant in a trade for d’lo
Nobody picks on Chris Paul defensively. He was the Clippers best defender on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the 2014 playoffs. Chris Paul was a better post defender then Magic as well. You clearly haven’t watched Chris Paul play and you’re judging defensively ability on height.
When the warriors got kevin durant
“Kevin Durant dunks on nba all defense Pat Beverly!”
"I bet they have one huge statue and Curry, Klay, and Draymond side by side, and two separate smaller statues for Kevin Durant and Andre."
Kevin Durant is one of the best players in the league.  -Right after the 2008 draft
"I think it would go like this:  PG: Stephen Curry  Bench: Tim Hardaway  SG: Klay Thompson  Bench: Chris Mullins (SF but can play SG)  SF: Kevin Durant (no duh) Bench: Rick Barry  PF: Nate Thurmond  Bench: Draymond Green  C: Wilt Chamberlain  Bench: Andrew Bogut  Head coach: Steve Kerr  Assistants: Al Attles - Luke Walton  This all team I have to imagine would be one of the best all time teams out there with a great mix of playmaking, scoring, and defense. Imagine going up against a starting lineup of Curry, Klay, KD, Nate and Wilt. Imagine trying to score against that lineup! Imagine trying to *stop* that lineup from scoring.   If I had a magic genie I'd wish to watch this team, all in their primes, go through an NBA season and playoffs."
Kevin Durant built that.
"...lol? Are you serious?  Kevin Durant has toothpick arms and doesn't have any problems keeping the ball when going to the rim. Just stop, curls are for looking jacked and that's it."
"Well I guess if I should clarify, the 81 point game isn’t the only thing Kobe ever did... his whole career and achievements plus the moments like 81 and mamba out 60, add to his legendary story..   And I’d argue Booker *is* legendary.. Elgin Baylor, David Thompson, David Robinson, and Wilt (like 5 times) are the only players to score 70 or more in a game.   Let’s be clear I am in no way saying Booker is already a HOFer like the other guys, but his 70 will be remembered forever as one of NBA greatest single game performances. Similar to how David Thompson’s name’s brought up just now, Booker’s name will come up in the discussion of greatest scoring performances.   I think it’s similar to Westbrook and his triple double seasons. It didn’t catapult him to top 10 all time, but it definitely added a legendary story to his career. I’d argue Russ is similarly “legendary” in this way. Oscar’s triple doubles made him legendary as well.   If Booker retired today his 70 will still be talked about. If Booker continues scoring at this rate for the terrible suns he’ll be a HOFer. If Booker turns around the suns and wins a championship or wins elsewhere while scoring at this rate he’ll be one of the best scoring 2 guards in history... if he finishes his career as a HOFer some kid is gonna argue he was better than idk a Kevin Durant same way some say Kobe over Shaq.. because those moments like 81 and 70 they can’t let go"
Spencer hawes is Kevin Durant
"Steph's first MVP season was 23.8/7.7/4.3 on .638 TS%. KD, from 2012-2019, averaged 27.7/4.9/7.5 on .635 TS%. Kevin Durant has unequivocally been better than Steph Curry his entire career"
"they're kind of like background noises to me really, but the one that came to mind right away was when david kahn was comparing Darko to C-Webb as Webber was sitting right there   or when Reggie Miller said Serge could be the thunders best shooter.. like they didn't have kevin fucking durant   or when tommy talked about sneaking up on Aron Baynes in the shower and catching a peak of that Baynes Hammer and saying he's well put together"
I believe is was the game right after that LMA did that step on KD.  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/05/lamarcus-aldridge-kevin-durant-kawhi-leonard-zaza-pachulia-closeout-video-game-2-warriors-spurs-nba
"From an olllllllld Simmons mail bag,  &gt;Q: Thought you would enjoy this 10-minute stretch on Twitter today:  &gt; 3:50 p.m.: Hasheem Thabeet says: ""Late LUNCH before i go for a NAP!!! Mhmmmm Yummy.""     &gt;4:00 p.m.: Kevin Durant says: ""Good workout..worked on ballhandling, finishing thru contact, pull up jumpers, pick n rolls, and making tough shots with a man on me!!!""    Can you tell which one of those No. 2 overall draft picks just spent time in the D League?"
* Tall white guy who can shoot - Dirk  * Tall black guy who can shoot - Kevin Durant  * Literally anybody Asian - Yao Ming
"\&gt; No way he is slumming with ordinary juice - his is designer HGH of some sort. Just look at his Barry Bonds hairline and skull.     The fact that we think the body builder physique we see the average NBA player has, let alone the goddamn Superhero appearance of LeBron is ""natural"" means the average viewer is blissfully unaware of what it takes to look like that. And LeBron did at least somewhat naturally look like he does now when he was younger. But realistically, his ungodly durability is the single most obvious pointer to HGH. His body is **ALWAYS** recovered.     Kevin Durant is even more obviously on something IMO, same with Giannis. It takes a lot to but that much meat on them long bones. Also, guys who had injury problems and miraculously don't any more (Curry) are generally also candidates for HGH specifically. But realistically, the ""worst"" offenders are the average-below average NBA player trying to gain an edge."
1. 2013 LeBron James  2. 2016 Steph Curry 3. 2010 LeBron James 4. 2014 Kevin Durant 5. 2018 James Harden 6. 2015 Steph Curry 7. 2012 LeBron James 8. 2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo 9. 2011 Derrick Rose 10. 2017 Russell Westbrook  Curry/Harden at 5/6 is really close.
lol that's easy  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Carmelo Anthony  Jeremy Lin  Stephen Curry  Donald Sterling  Demarcus Cousins  Uhhh uhhhh shit you're right
"I could see the case with Russ considering James Harden put up similarly fantastic numbers in the same season, but averaging a 30+ point triple double to keep your team afloat is not easy considering OKC lost Kevin Durant to the Warriors"
"Danny green is 6’6”? Damn, I thought he was like 6’4”, max 6’5”.  Okay then.  Weight wise he’s listed at 215, jaylen is definitely closer to 230 nowadays so I’d say about a 10 pound difference there   And Jaylen is better than a “decent decent defender”   He completely shut bojan out of the pacers series, and got DPOY votes in his second year.  He also regularly holds Kevin Durant to a low roar every time we played the warriors"
"And then Kevin Durant happened, and the Finals haven't been satisfying since."

&gt; Kevin Durant is in denial about how hard his road is  Facts. People that think he'll win a ring with Kyrie + scrubs are kidding themselves.   &gt;The only truly dislikable player on the team is Draymond.  Dude i'm a neutral and he's my favorite player. Nothing but fight in that dog.
Would this be the softest team of all time? https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2851569-carmelo-anthony-rumors-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-pushing-for-nets-deal
"Brief bit that's publically available on the athletic:   &gt;The Brooklyn Nets remain interested in potentially signing Anthony, who recently trained with a group of their players in Los Angeles, including Kyrie Irving. In fact, one source told The Athletic that Irving and Kevin Durant, who both joined the Nets in July, are “pushing” the club to sign Anthony.  &gt;Nets General Manager Sean Marks will have the final say, and it’s unclear if Marks is willing to take a chance on Anthony, who was born in Brooklyn and remains a popular player among New York basketball fans. Anthony has not played in an NBA game since being banished by the Houston Rockets last November.  &gt;Marks, according to a source, did watch Anthony train recently in what was described as an informal workout. Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson has also watched Anthony play..."
"You know they'll be trying. Could you even imagine how unstoppable the Warriors would be with Giannis? He would an even better fit than Kevin Durant. The driving threat they haven't had this whole run. Double Curry, easy dunk for Giannis. Double Giannis, wide open three for either Steph or Klay. They might never lose a game."
"In the past year alone, you have Darius Miller, Kevin Durant and John Wall. Going a little further back you have Demarcus Cousins. So that is 3 or 4 depending on how you want to group them.   If my memory is correct Rudy Gay had one in 2017, Wes Mathews in 2015 &amp; Kobe Bryant in 2012. That's 3 over a 5 year period. There weren't any others that I can recall, but I could be wrong"
"Klay is every bit of 6’7” and can play the modern 3. Positions on offense are pretty irrelevant these days...wing vs interior and that’s about it. Contingent upon his knee being solid, it’ll be Curry/Russell/Thompson/Green/Stein.   My theory on rotations: Kerr will sit D’Lo earlier in the first, and sub him in for Steph who plays the entire 1st quarter and most of the 3rd quarter. That way, the team will have a legit pg for most of the game, with 2nd year player Jacob Evans sprinkled in at the 1 like Shaun Livingston was. I see our staff also brining in Kevon Looney for WCS a bit early in the first, so he and D’Angelo can play PnR with the second unit in the beginnings of the 2nd and 4th quarters. I’m really curious to see where Spellman will fit in. Finger’s crossed he was going to slim down but based on social media it doesn’t look like it, and he could be a stronger more hard nosed version of Mo Speights for us.   With Klay out, rookie Jordan Poole will get a big chance to earn minutes...I think more than any other rookie on a playoff team from last year in the West that is still primed to make it this year. He’s 6’5” and light, so based on most defensive matchups, JP will exclusively be looking to grab the backup 2 spot. It’s definitely up for grabs.  Our wing defense is going to be bad, barring some out of nowhere improvement on that end from guys like Alfonzo McKinnie/Glenn Robinson, or a rookie like Eric Paschall actually looking like Draymond Jr in small doses. If the Warriors sit anywhere middle of the pack on defense, Green should get a lot of DPOY shouts imo. I don’t think Russell is an awful defender, but he’s shown limitations, and even if he was All-NBA level defense, Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant are gone for good, and Klay is out for a while...the drop-off in perimeter D is going to be drastic."
Spencer hawes is pretty much Kevin Durant
"I actually think KGs defense is overrated. I don’t have any empirical data to back it up, it’s just purely anecdotal based on my eye test.  Garnett did a good job switching on pick and rolls and was one of the best at doing that. But in terms of interior defense, he didn’t block or alter shots the way someone like Hakeem and Duncan did and Anthony Davis does currently. People didn’t really seem to fear challenging kg at the basket, and he wasn’t always a willing rim protector either.  KGs defense was virtually a non factor against dirk, and that was highlighted in their head to head matchup in the 2002 playoffs. KG also was not entirely effective guarding pau Gasol during the finals against the lakers. The Celtics actually switched and used a 36 year old Rasheed Wallace, who did a better job guarding Gasol.  Kg was a good perimeter defender for his size and era, but it was only effective against less potent perimeter players like the tayshaun prince types. He was not able to guard the elite perimeter forwards of the time like Carmelo or Kevin durant.  Good defender, sure. All time great defender? It’s a stretch"
Kevin Durant was 2nd in MVP voting in 2010 when he was only 21 years old. He's been elite for the entire decade where as Curry has only been at an elite level since 2014.
"Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Demarcus Cousins"
Russell Westbrook  Thabo Sefelosha  Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Kendrick Perkins    Jesus I’m old :/
I think if he was 6'3 his handles would be about even. You dont see many guys outside of lets say kevin durant with better handles than lebron. its just tough to have good handles at that size. For his size lebron has some of the best handles. He'd likely have a westbrook type handle at 6'3. Nothing super sexy but effective and quick.
"The 2017 Warriors are a different beast than any of those teams. They are by far the best team to ever exist. Anyone who says otherwise just has too much nostalgia for the 90's Bulls. Steph, Klay, KD, and Dray are the PERFECT core for basketball. KD can score in iso whenever he wants, and is a good defender, Steph can playmake really well, and is an elite off ball scorer, not to mention how well he can score off the dribble. Klay is the best 3&amp;D player ever, and Dray is a DPOY with elite playmaking skills and in 2017 at least had a respectable jumper that u had to guard. Not only are the the most talented team ever, they fit together perfectly. This is a team that went 73-9 then upgraded Harrison Barnes to Kevin fucking Durant. They could've won 75 games if they gave a fuck about the regular season. Taking a game off them in the finals is a huge accomplishment IMO"
I'm not memeing here: I 100% believe you are Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant right now is 5 years removed from winning MVP. He's not an MVP caliber player anymore?
I said they are MVP players to describe them and they are. Just because they didn't win MVP that year doesn't mean they aren't MVP type players. Is Kevin Durant on the 2017 Warriors not an MVP player because he didn't win MVP that year? Imo he is.
"Maybe he really wanted to be part of a motion offense. The problem is he’s Kevin Durant, and sometimes the best play is just to give him the ball, especially  against a team playing crazy defense in the playoffs."
"I assumed we weren't talking all-time. But for shits and giggles:  Thomas, Isiah  Jordan, Michael  Durant, Kevin  Duncan, Tim  Jabbar Kareem-Abdul"
"He did, that's how Kevin Durant happened."
"I put this in another comment but i don't think it's contradictory. He thought all he wanted was a ring. Or to play in a motion offense. Maybe both. He got those things and realized that wasn't what he wanted.   I do think if he wins in Brooklyn, all will be forgiven more or less. Provided he shuts his mouth. But he's Kevin Durant. You know who he is."
"Curry really came out of no where in the middle of this decade, before that Kevin Durant was the far and away #2 to LeBron"
I think everyone is taking this the wrong way. Kevin Durant has said before that the motion offense can become very exhausting and sometimes he would have preferred that the Warriors would have ran set plays like the Clippers or Spurs do.
[No he wasn't.](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/10/2/9440925/kevin-durant-los-angeles-lakers-free-agency-2016-stephen-a-smith)

"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's the only one who's ever had the opposing team run two guys at him on a fast-break while Kevin Durant is barreling unimpeded towards the basket just to prevent him from getting a chance at a 3."
Kevin Durant is a dumbass dude. There is no explaining it.
How did two time finals MVP Kevin Durant disappoint the warriors?
I guess Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are hopefully going to be your Sergio Aguero and David Silva?
"I’m saying Steph doesn’t have the same ability that a 7 footer with possibly the best scoring arsenal of all time, but stop acting like he’s a deficient in creating his own shot.  He’s always been in the top decile in ISO PPP.  There are more dimensions to basketball other than scoring, the best scorer is often not the best player.    AD was top 10 in PIPM last season, one spot ahead of Harden, despite playing for the lousy Pelicans...  Steve Kerr d riding so that KD wouldn’t leave or throw a fit is not of my concern, I can form my own opinion...not to mention he made those comments when KD was playing better than anyone in the league.  ESPN’s playoff run rankings according to WARP put Steph within the top 25 so I’m not sure what you’re referring to.  His runs in which he was injured for multiple rounds are obviously not there, big shocker.    The list of current players with postseasons ranked above Steph’s best according to WARP is: LeBron James.    And there clearly is a contest between LeBron and Steph, if you consider a 3/4 for Steph contested.  Harden had a good series vs the Warriors, and Steph was off all series with the finger injury and the constant mugging by Austin “Daddy’s Little Boy” Rivers that the refs (no surprise) allowed, but he showed up when it mattered and sent your boy home.  Awkward.    Warriors second unit often played with Kevin Durant, and Quinn Cook is terrible but did not play that much as Curry’s backup save for the pst season.  Steph’s best season in terms of teammate true shooting was in 2017 when the Warriors had their best bench with David West (the bench GOAT lol)."
"Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. - Kevin ""Michael Scott"" Durant"
"he was specifically referring to the houston rockets.  remember kd just lost 2 straight games vs the rockets in that semifinals and then the warriors were getting smacked in the 3rd quarter of game 5 before he went down.  the warriors were struggling.  the rockets were switching on 98% of plays in both 2018 and 2019 vs golden state, and switching completely kills the motion offense.  you're eliminating the cutting action, the split post action, the pick and roll, the off-ball shooters coming off screens etc, all of it gets nullified when you switch.  but what you're left with is mismatches as a result of those switches, so houston playing that style of defense all the time eventually led to stagnant warriors offense and iso hero ball to try and abuse those switches (this is fine when you have kevin durant &amp; steph curry on your team!)  from that perspective kd is literally just stating a fact about motion offense.  it gets destroyed by switching when executed properly.  but now the media can spin this and make 100 different stories about how durant is trashing kerr &amp; golden state.  idk why durant brought this up but i don't think he was trying to be that dramatic in doing so."
"Right? Like positions even matter, we deadass had Kevin Durant runnin at 5 vs the Cavs last time we played in the finals he ain’t seem to mind it too much"
I think it was Richard Jefferson who said that all The Warriors needed to beat them was a consistent wing who could knock down all the open threes they were getting. They really didn't have to go out and get Kevin Durant just a slight upgrade over Harrison Barnes.
Kevin Durant and Westbrook* did it in 2012
" “Of course Steph cannot simply shoot over defenders, he’s only 6’3 and not an explosive player”  That’s precisely why he’s not the best player in the world. If you can’t create 15-20 quality looks for yourself and you rely on open shots and a very heavy screening scheme to get open, then you aren’t the best player in the world. No superstar in the league shoots more open shots than Steph with no defender within 4-6 feet.   “So it is by definition  an individual statistic”  PM stats don’t specify what the individual is doing on the court. For example, What Plus/Minus  data actually tells us is “Philadelphia is 3 points per 48 minutes better than the opposing lineups in stints that included Tobias Harris.” Unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited parentheses unfortunately, we do not have an unlimited amount of Trials to test out every possible lineup featuring Harris. This means that we cannot know how much of the three point differential is attributable to Harris. We also will not be able to tell us how those lineups would perform without harass against the same opponent lineups.   “Steph has been the best player in the league since he overtook LeBron in 2016”  Even Steve Kerr disagrees with you, This is simply not true and not corroborated on every level. Per Kevin Pelton’s WARP (championship over replacement rating) LeBron James has had 4 postseasons in the top 25 all time playoff runs ever (his last 4 postseasons). Steph doesn’t even have one in the top 45 the past 5 years.   There is simply no contest between LeBron and Steph.   “Harden is just not as effective as Steph”  Harden is a one man offense whose team was 1st in offensive efficiency the past 5 years. This is with no draymond green, klay thomspin (or later Kevin Durant).   Harden averaged 35 on 61 TS% against the warriors while Steph averaged 24 on 55 TS%.  The only difference was one team had draymond green.  Harden has been better than Curry the last 3 years and so has Durant. LeBron is on an island alone.  Your teammates TS improving doesn’t mean you’re the best player in the world. It has more to do with having the worst backup in the league by a large margin."
"The reason they got Durant is that they could, and Durant wanted to go there to everyone's surprise. I don't think you need a deep basketball reason to make a move on Kevin Durant in free agency."
Nephews. You all think harden is the problem? Think about it. Westbrook started every possession when he had KEVIN DURANT. How is this any different. Westbrook needs to change not harden.
"Iverson propelled teams with shitty offenses, He never had a Paul George and despite that made it to the finals. What has Russ done after Durant left? Even with Paul George? Heavily favored in both series’ and the Thunder lost both in embarrassing fashion.   Russ was the second best player on a contender because he had one of the greatest- if not the greatest scorer of all time next to him, an absolutely transcendent talent in Kevin Durant, and despite that the Thunder only had the #1 offense in the league once, why? Russ would shoot them out of games, turn the ball over in crucial moments and generally wasn’t the player they needed.   That’s how Iverson is a winning player and Russ isn’t."
"Of course Steph cannot simply shoot over defenders, he’s only 6’3” and not the most explosive player.  However, he’s still highly effective in isolation.  And can create his own shot quite well.  Just imagine if the refs let him travel and/or push off on every play!   RAPM uses priors to correct for anomalies, but PIPM uses a combination of luck adjusted PM and box score to estimate a player’s impact.  I’m not sure what you’re on about with the “best five man unit” thing but raw PM is a measurement of whenever the player is on the court, no matter if he’s playing with all stars or scrubs.  So it is, by definition an individual statistic, albeit one that is highly volatile and problematic, which is why derivative statistics have tried to correct it using box score.  That is why the league leaders in PM includes some obvious scrubs and the league leaders in PIPM passes the logic test.    Curry has been the best player in the league since he overtook LeBron in 2016, and he’s been better than Durant.  Kevin did play like a man possessed before his injuries in these past playoffs though.  Tell me why KD joined Steph to win a ring?  Yes, KD is a walking bucket and can shoot over anyone, I would probably pass it to him if I needed 2 points in 5 seconds, wouldn’t you?  However, it’s quite evident that Steph has a greater impact on the game thanks to his ability to make everyone else better, rather than just pure scoring ability.  It’s the same thing with Harden, who is a great ISO scorer, but he’s simply not as effective as Steph."
"1. (i did an actual top) Lebron James. Goat, awesome at everything, weakness is probably he become a lazy defender with time, and he will do everything for the win like trading half of his team lol. 2. i'll go with Kevin Durant. Phenomenal Scorer, A not bad playmaker, and became a really great defender with time, no real weakness in game, except than he actually injured, and we can say he's not loyal too lol. 3. Kawhi Leonard, Definition of an Elite defender, and he probably as good defender as he is in scoring. weakness is probably his playmaking, if he was an as good playmaker as Lebron he would without any doubt be the number 1 today.  4. Stephen Curry i guess, Best shooter of all-time, bring so much spacing on the floor because of this, a really good finisher and playmaker, weakness is probably  his lack of seriousness sometime and even if he's good he's not the best defender so is often target in defense. 5.  i won't put Harden here like everyone would probably do but Anthony Davis, i think he's one of the most unstoppable player,  never really saw him got lockdown by someone, and can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is probably he didn't won anything. 6. still not Harden sorry.. Giannis Antetokoumnpo, he's unstoppable inside the paint, Same he can be MVP like he can be DPOY, weakness is he still don't have a good shoot but he keep improving. 7. James Harden, best Scorer in the NBA statistically (just 36ppg..) also an incredible playmaker, weakness is even if he made some effort , he's not a good defender and also not a really nice teammate. 8. I think Joel Embiid,definition of a beast, so powerful and skilled at the same time, also a DPOY/MVP caliber, Weakness is probably the regularity and shot selections,he take a lot of 3 for someone who average 30% at 3. 9. it may be shocking people but i believe Paul George is 9th, also an Elite Defender, amazing scorer and shooter, and an not bad playmaker, weakness is without any doubt his regularity. 10. its tough i really don't know, i think Nicolas Jokic is 10th , Great player at everything, he's known for the fact than he a really good passer for a center, averaging 7 assist per games, i don't really watch him so i think the weakness point is his athleticism lol, pretty slow and almost never dunk."
It is when the PG is Westbrook though. Ask Paul George and Kevin Durant.
"Strengths and Weaknesses becomes an essay quick, so here’s my very brief list. I can’t order the players well, so I tiered them instead.  1. The Best of the Best Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, James Harden, Kevin Durant (injured for season). These guys singlehandedly change the fortunes for any team they’re on. All except Giannis and Harden have won multiple championships, and those two came close to playing in the Finals before falling to historic teams.   2. Like A Hair Below Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic.  These guys do the same as the others with incredible two way dominance (yes, Jokic is a very good, if flawed, defensive player), with the caveat that they’ve had very little success so far and need to prove more before moving up. None of these three have advanced beyond the 2nd round of the playoffs.   After those 9 guys, it becomes hard to pick a single guy to round it out, because while there a lot of good options, nobody solidly takes that spot. Here are who I would put  3. The Jumble Damien Lillard, Karl Anthony-Towns, Paul George.  None of them have come particularly close to winning much, and Towns has barely been in the playoffs. But all it takes is a perfect storm and a change of fate for these guys to change that narrative."
Basicslly Kevin Durant.
Cleared a jumping Kevin Durant...
kevin durant shot wide open shots from at least 10 feet away from the hoop at 86.7%
"according to kevin durant and I'm sure other players as well, all of them"
"They were moved there with Kevin Durant, how good they were doesn’t matter since they had their money maker in KD."

Kevin Durant is a pussy don't compare them lol
Kevin Durant.
The only two players who have willingly walked away from playing with Curry are Kevin Durant and Patrick McCaw.
LeBron has a higher career scoring average than Kevin Durant. Let that sink in. It's not even the most celebrated part of his game.
Kevin “I’m Kevin Durant” Durant
"&gt;Golden State never feared him.  I even got proof for you  &gt;**Green was already working on that as he left Oracle Arena after that gutting Game 7 loss.** Green sat in his car in the parking lot and called Myers (the Warriors GM), telling him he had to sign Durant. “It’s on you,” Green told Myers.  &gt;**Green hung up, stayed in the parking lot, and made another call — to Durant. “That was my very next call,” Green said. Two weeks later, Durant signed a maximum contract that put him in a Golden State uniform for at least one season, with several more seasons likely to come.**  &gt;“If we win the championship, I’m like 99 percent sure we don’t get him,” Green said. “There are silver linings to everything.”  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/kevin-durant-draymond-green-game-7-phone-call-recruit-nba-finals-warriors-thunder"
Ignoring accolades  Prime Kobe Bryant vs Kevin Durant
Hes Kevin Durant. You know who he is
"That's irrelevant to a salary cap increase, though, because it'd be true no matter what the cap was at. The cap increase is more relevant for teams that already have one or two max players since their contracts were signed based on a percentage of a previous salary cap. It's basically how Kevin Durant ended up on the Warriors.  For example, a team with 25% and 30% max players right now would be paying those players roughly $59 mil next season, 54% of the cap. At 5% increases, in two years those two players will be paid $66 mil, at 53% of the new cap.  Not a substantial difference, but notable for teams without much cap space. Every dollar counts."
"Kd Vs Kobe: KD Kd is a much harder to defend and also a more consistent shooter. Kobe has too much ball usage while Kd can play in a team setting better.   Magic Vs Curry: Curry Curry is a much better shooter/scorer and more efficient scorer. Magic beats curry in assisting the ball and rebounding but curry is no slouch when it comes to playmaking.  He can play a very good team game,  2019 vs rockets prove that if you need him to he can stack points up.   Lebron vs MJ: Lebron Put Lebron on any team and he takes them to the finals. The way he plays in a team setting is incredible, his basketball iq matched with his high passing accuracy is unmatched. His power to the basket can’t be stopped. 2017 and 2018 he developed a fade and a very reliable jumper that he used against raptors pacers and Celtics religiously. Defending is his down point against MJ. Lebron only plays strong Defense and tries very hard to go for blocks near the crunch time. Lebron recently has proven to be a very clutch shooter (better than Jordan idk). Mj is a much better iso player because of his foot work and has a much better mid game but lebron is more well rounded.   Kawhi vs Kd: Kevin Durant Kawhi is a better defender but durant is more intimidating because of his height and span. Kevin durant is a better perimeter shooter and better scorer. Kevin durant is a lot harder to guard and the team needs to focus on him.   Curry vs Harden: Harden disappeared in the playoffs(not preform as well). Curry plays at a high level consistently.   Kyrie vs Westbrook: Kyrie is not a good leader and this year proved it. Westbrook can play a great team game and he is a very good teammate. He has a good relation ship with his teammates etc."
"Because he is still Kevin Durant and the thought is that while yes nobody besides Dominique Wilkins has come back from an Achilles and still did superstar stuff, KD is still 6’11ish with one of the purest jump shots in the NBA. Maybe he loses some quickness in his off the dribble game game but a less mobile KD basically becomes championship Dirk which still makes him worth the money."
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard"
"\&gt; He had Dwight, CP3, Capela and ""rejuvenated"" Eric Gordon which is far more than some of his contemporaries had during their careers and they caught far more flame for their shortcomings then he did.      Nice disingenuous tactic you are using Name dropping without context hoping a third party viewer relies on memories of CP3 and Dwight being MVP caliber players to 'prove' a point that Harden had elite level help. Both CP3 and Dwight were significantly past their prime by the time they got to the Rockets. Both were injury riddled. CP3 was the only one who even though he was injury riddled in 2018, was playing on par to what amounts to a genuine ""second option on a championship level contender"" and coincidentally the Rockets won 65 games and had one of the top 15 seasons all time n net rating and took the ""greatest team ever assembled"" in their peak to 7 with CP3, their second best player missing the last two.  The following season, CP3 declined significantly. Even when on the court, the man couldn't even create separation against 7ft big men. It was a tragic sight to see. Eric Gordon was the Rockets second best player in the playoffs. Eric Gordon is damn good NBA player, but no way is he a ""second best player on a championship level team"" good. He ain't Dwayne Wade, Kyrie Irving, Kobe Bryant, Scottie Pippen, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson etc. And you need a second player at that level of caliber to beat a healthy KD-Curry-Klay-Draymond level NBA team in a 7 game series.   And besides CP3 in 2018, name a player who deserved to take touches away from Harden so they could have a chance making a all nba first, second or third team? Stop moving goal posts. That was your claim? Jeremy Lin? Chandler Parsons? Patrick Beverly? Old man Jason Terry?      At the end of the day Harden's ""ball hogging"" has created an offense that consistently is in the top 5 in offensive efficiency. There was only one season where a player other than Harden deserved to have touches taken away from him to playmaker and that was 2017-2018 CP3 and there is a reason that year Rockets is considered one of the greatest teams to not win a ring."

"I didn’t get to really watch Dr. J.  Do you think he was better than KD though?  Kevin Durant is unreal how good he is, maybe the best offensive player ever outside of Jordan."
....then they would lose  I can’t think of anything more anticlimactic than watching a 1 on 1 game between Cheick Diallo and Kevin Durant

Larry Bird is better than Kevin Durant
Jamal seems like a genuine dude and a sweetheart.   Just finished reading Boomtown by Sam Anderson and he describes when he talks to Kevin Durant that there’s an attentiveness and empathy that he always gave to the people he was talking to.   Jamal seems to have that too.
"Lol if you say so chief.  If you want to count players who turned 26 in 2015, I'll just add Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, and DeMar DeRozan.  4 MVPs in that list, but yeah Bradley Beal and Andre Drummond really invalidate my whole point."
"Yeah if I was the Nets, I would take a second round exit knowing we have Kevin freaking Durant coming back next year. Even if he never is what he once was."
"If it’s exactly 10 years ago from today, then my list is the following:   • Derrick Rose wins MVP in 2010 at the age of 22   • The Golden State Warriors won 73 games and proceeded to not win the title that year   • Lebron James wins a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers during his second stint with the team   • Russell Westbrook and James Harden won MVP’s and are teammates but not in Oklahoma City   • The Nets managed to sign Kevin Durant   • Kevin Durant joins a 73-win Golden State Warriors team after he losses to them in the WCF  • Steph Curry dropped 400 three-pointers in a single season and won unanimous MVP that year   • Lebron James signs with the Los Angeles Lakers and proceeds to miss the playoffs in his first season there   • Andre Igoudala wins a Finals MVP coming off the bench for the Golden State Warriors   • Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks and won a title against a Miami Heat superteam consisting of Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh  • Dwight Howard was traded to the Kobe Bryant-led Los Angeles Lakers in 2012  • Dwight Howard’s career falls off after being traded and proceeds to play for 5 different teams over a span of 7 years   • Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett are both traded to the Brooklyn Nets   • Ray Allen wins a title with Lebron James"
You won’t be just as excited to watch Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving? Lol
Kawhi.   Kevin Durant or DeMarcus Cousins?
"I disagree. Think of boxing weight classes. Some of the greatest boxers of all time would be defeated in heavyweight. And some heavyweight champions do not really strike me as the greatest boxers of their time. They are great and big. Similarly, KD isn’t the greatest shooter. It’s a marvel that he’s a very good shooter, and at 7 feet he can shoot it over people. So if I want to see the greatest shooters go toe to toe, I can’t if Kevin Durant is competing. He is a great shooter who is really tall and well coordinated. Not the best at any of those things, but the best,tallest. However, Kyrie actually gets to compete against taller dudes, which would be to his advnatage. Seeing him do that against super quick dudes all his height would be cool. The shorter guys in the NBA are the rare ones who can fight above their class.  A height restricted league would include a lot of the guys that are amazing shooters and dribblers, but cant get around or guard taller dudes. Kyrie and shorter guys like him might still dominate that league, but there would be a far different play style that I personally would find fun. And like watching a great like Floyd mayweather, guys like Kyrie could dominate that league like a Shaq or Wilt dominated the NBA, but more skillfully in my opionion. Floyd is peak performance even though a lot of less skilled bigger dudes could beat him."
"no it doesnt. thats not even close to a good enough stat line. and its hard to win without being a top seed. The worst statistical mvps were steph in 2015 with 24/7/4, but he won 67 games. Rose won 62, Nash won 62 and 58. timmy won 60 and 58.   A 5 seed would prolly have like 45 wins, similar to what russ's okc team did, but he averaged 32/10/10 on 43/35/85 which is better than what luka will do next year. and beyond that, he also had the great ""FUCK KEVIN DURANT"" storyline giving him points as well as the triple double. if kd stayed in okc just got hurt and missed the year, harden wins it easy cause he had damn near the same stats but on a much better team with similar talent."
"But he's tall and lanky like Kevin Durant, so they must play exactly like each other! Right?"
When has Jokic played with Kevin Durant? Ight then. Westbrook been a first round exits since KD left and will be a Second Round Exit next year
This would hold up if the nets didn’t have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Fucking Durant lmao. What kind of take is this
Kevin Durant is younger than Stephen Curry...
kevin durant
Easy Money Sniper Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is a consensus top 3 small foward and seeing him the past few years it's not especially controversial to say that he's better than Larry Bird
"Assuming the Bucks are still a Finals contender, they will probably play out the string and see if winning can convince him to stay.  That's like saying the Thunder should have traded Kevin Durant because they weren't sure if he was going to re-sign. If that player gives you the potential to win a championship for that season, you have to go for it."
"He battled against Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala without any help just over a year ago."
The pair of Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had 50-8-8 dropped on them. That should tell you everything.
Is there a reason why the 2011-12 season had a cleared dip in 3 pointers and points per game?   Just googled the season and it was   a Miami heat/lebron James MVP and FMVP championship year and Kevin Durant top scorer. Also there was something called the nba lockout to do with contracts. Not sure if any of this has an effect on play style.
"1. Prestis philosophy (love it or hate it) is to have long, defensive wings. Long, defensive wings usually can’t shoot   2. It’s really easy to just say “why doesn’t Presti get more shooters” and really hard to actually do, especially when you’re in a small market   3. We tried to develop shooters but sometimes it just doesn’t work out. Ferguson still needs work. Singler apparently went into a coma when he signed with us and forgot how to shoot, Melo ended up being trash, and Abrines just up and quit  4. For all the shooters we couldn’t get in FA, he still had Kevin Durant and Paul George to work with lol"
"There is no reason to assume anything otherwise.  After 15 years of dominance and 58 straight wins we suddenly don't know who is better?  We're not allowed to assume anything based on that?  No, LeBron James and Kevin Durant are better than everyone at this tournament.  We know that."
it’s a must win game 6 at home without kevin durant; chris paul puts up 27/11/8  win the game &amp; stop throwing the ball around the gym.   it’s really not unreasonable to ask houston to win the game..  l wonder if there any reasonable houston fan who can see where harden needs to play better?
A Team:  Lebron James  Steph Curry  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Paul George  Anthony Davis  **B+ Team:**  Kyrie Irving  Damian Lillard  Klay Thompson  Jimmy Butler  Andre Drummond  Draymond Green  **B Team**  Russell Westbrook  Kemba Walker  Bradley Beal  CJ McCollum  Kevin Love  **B- Team**  Paul Millsap  Eric Gordon  Tobias Harris  **C Team**  Basically the current roster -Kemba
"Kevin Durant, not LeBron James, has been Team USA's best player whenever he's showed up over the last 10 years."
Lmao we comparing bogut getting hurt to kevin fucking durant? Cmon man
"[One of the “milkmen” Wilt played against.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Tom_Meschery%2C_Bob_Rule_and_Wilt_Chamberlain.jpeg) He also held the rookie record for PPG for 40 years until Kevin Durant. His career was cut short by a torn Achilles, so not many people remember him but he could seriously ball.  RIP to one of the pioneers"
Kevin Durant has the largest penis. Find a new slant.

ok this is a top tier shitpost but i can’t get over seeing “Kevin Durant (BKN)” it’s really real
"Kevin Durant: ""One year they say I'm a humble superstar (2015-2016). The next season I'm a snake.  So I’m like this doesn’t add up. There’s no way someone can be a humble superstar and still be a snake."
"Don’t worry, gonna be [BKN] Kevin Durant soon... when the mods get around to adding it.  You’ll be happy to hear I live in NYC so I won’t be a “bandwagon” OKC or GSW fan anymore lmao"
"Read all of it, and it just confirmed my beliefs. Harden cares more about stats/awards than winning championships. Why didn’t he talk about his team losing 2 straight to a team without Kevin Durant?"
"Alright two things. First, you're not even this Boston moron I'm talking to, and second, nice flare. GSW Kevin Durant. Take your bandwagon ass tf out of my replies."

The best team the 2016 Cavs faced in route to beat that 70 win team was a DeRozan and Lowry led Raptors.  The best team the 70 win Warriors faced in route to the finals was a Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook led OKC.
"Need one where we have to pose as aliens in order to infiltrate an Earth-excluded basketball tourney.   PG: Nate Robinson  SG: Sam Cassell  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Kevin McHale  C: Manute Bol  We can pose as the classic Grey-type of alien with our front court in grey paint and/or skin tight grey bodysuits. Size, skill, defense win the day. While the two guards can probably be passed off as their pets. Robinson makes the distraction, Cassell infiltrates and gets the info we need to survive as a species."
"Congrats to your country bro. I wish them luck against Spain. Continuity beats talent indeed when the talent doesn't compose of LeBron James, Kevin Durant, etc."
"&gt; Kevin Durant is going to take significant viewersship away from U of Texas  for durant and basketball fans? Sure. people who are strictly Texas fans won't give a flying fuck.  &gt; If the quality product moves, the fans will wane.  correct, viewership from other schools will simply decrease. california collegiate sports will become a novelty and make significantly less money overall, devaluing collegiate athletics as a whole in terms of revenue, due to the fact that california and the surrounding states are not very interested in sports compared to the rest of the country."
"He is 38 % between 16 feet and the three point line. He's not that good of a mid range shooter. The deadeye mid range shooters are guys like Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge and CJ McCollum.  DeRozan is a clear step below all of those guys."
"(Currently playing):   LeBron, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant, Channing Frye, Steven Adams"
"&gt; Example: Ingram will be the next Kevin Durant  The problem is that scouts and draftniks would say something like ""Ingram has potential to be a tall, slick shooting matcup problem like Durant"" and then people would drop all the nuance and report that everyone thinks Ingram is the next Durant. "
Well it’s overrated because it allows the imagination to run wild.  People get to project these fake careers for players and it’s just based on their imagination.  Example:  Ingram will be the next Kevin Durant.  Anyone who saw KD play at 19 would never think Ingram had a sniff of being him.  Their games were just that different.  Their only resemblance was that the both looked like daddy long legged spiders.  Note: I get KD said Ingram reminded him of himself. But KD and the warriors says a lot of things.  
"It’s the end of 2021-2022 season...  LeBron is the first player ever to win FMVP and MVP with 3 three different teams. Wins back to back titles with the Lakers. However, Anthony Davis is the FMVP in 2022.   Steph Curry is left all alone as the only Warriors star in San Francisco. KD and Klay left in free agency and the Dubs didn’t see a point in paying 30 year old Green the max.  Kevin Durant leads the Knicks to their first playoff series win in 20+ years and becomes the Final piece in Adam Silver’s plan to restore historic NBA teams and make them contenders: Knicks, Lakers, Celtics and 76ers.   "
"Kind of crazy that GSW, who have arguably the 2 best 3 point shooters of all time, and Kevin Durant, are only just above average for attempts per game. "
IDK of you recall this or not but you have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant on your team rn... In what world should you not be favored.
Wow I guess since Dirk was one of the best players ever he should be in over Kevin Durant.  
Kevin Durant 
"How...how is this comment upvoted? The article title is misleading, they didn't ""forget"" how to use Curry, the whole situation is actually raising his game if anything, it just happens to make him somewhat uncomfortable because it's different from what he's used to.  In a nutshell, the Warriors have discovered he's the best player to pair with the bench, better than Klay and KD. They're playing him in the 4th quarter more than any point during the run.   The whole issue is that Steph doesn't like breaking his rhythm exiting mid 4th quarter, and that's the crux of the disconnect. And it's an issue that will likely fix itself when Demarcus is back and he plays with the bench instead.   What this has to do with Kevin Durant...I just...I guess people just hate KD and fuck logic right"
https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/  It was 6’10 3/4 not 6’11 3/4 so that’s my fault for sure but he still said he’s 7
"Kevin Durant leaves this year, Cousins will most likely not be with the team next year (per Steve Kerr), and the team breaks apart without Steph holding it together. Wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t win finals this year. I loved the warriors dynasty as they were fun to watch but their time has passed."
They should sign Kevin Durant
"In other news, Kevin Durant was in bounds."
"Kevin Durant has literally been on the all NBA first team with LeBron James multiple times.   Gobert won DOPY last year, so he was voted a better defensive player than Joel embiid, so it's pretty safe to say that he was better than Embiid.  "
"/u/swagdaddy912 : &gt; Kevin Durant for first team All NBA. That means he's better than Lebron or Giannis.  &gt;Gobert first team All Defense. That means he's better defensively than Embiid.  &gt;See how dumb that sounds?  OF COURSE if player X makes 1st team over another player that plays the same poisition (KD over Lebron) it means that for that season he was BETTER DEFENSIVELY.  That's like, the whole point of All-Defense..."
Kevin Durant for first team All NBA. That means he's better than Lebron or Giannis.  Gobert first team All Defense. That means he's better defensively than Embiid.  See how dumb that sounds? Lonzo Is an elite defender. Smart is an elite defender. So is Jrue. 
Isolation scoring stats last year:  1. James Harden. 12.2 isolation points per game.  2. Lebron James. 6.1 isolation points per game.  3. Chris Paul – 5.6 isolation points per game.  4.

&gt; Durant was on the Bucks in place of Giannis they’d be just as good  breaking news: kevin durant is better than giannis
"Curry on the Thunder? That would be just as ridiculous as Westbrook, Harden and Kevin Durant on the same team"

I provided this as evidence: https://theathletic.com/749673/2019/01/04/can-the-warriors-win-and-keep-kevin-durant-happy-at-the-same-time/  And if your problem is the consistency of calls, it can't be draymonds fault because he's not calling the games. The problem, in the end, lies with the refs. The refs call fouls, the refs call techs."

[literally a video of Kevin Durant saying Tatum has MVP talent] (https://youtu.be/VvQjt7JYW3Q)
"1. Giannis Alphabetsoup  2. James Harden  3. Kevin Durant  4. Lebron James  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Anthony Davis  7. Steph Curry   8. Paul George  9. Kawhi Leonard  10. Joel Embiid   If you don't have the Greek Freak top 2 then you aren't watching.   I fucking hate Harden but if you look at that supporting cast and look at the standings you can't deny he's amazingly effective.  I'm weighing health a little more heavily than most. Kawhi has gotten a lot of scheduled rest and Curry has missed a bunch of games. Now Lebron is missing this stretch he may drop a few places if Jokic and AD continue on like this.   I'm still on the AD bandwagon and the Pelicans essentially play without even a backup level SF.   It's just my opinion but I feel like Joel Embiid still has some attitude issues that takes his team out of games, he's overall a huge net positive and the true driving force behind their success, I just feel like they could be even MORE successful."
**KEVIN DURANT HAS SPOKEN**
"The Cavaliers and Lakers being atrocious without him proves that he is the most valuable player in this league. Maybe he doesn’t match the numbers and hype of James Harden or Giannis, but those players have much left to prove before they can be compared to him. Kevin Durant has eliminated himself from this conversation in 2016. "

"I mean we deserved to lose that game... as Kevin Durant said about the refs “you can easily fool them,” it just shows how often the refs miss obvious calls"
Pretty sure it was confirmed that it was only Kevin Durant
"Quick being whack. Nobody moved any goal posts. I said his game isnt nice to look at and fluidity is part of that for me. His step back is ugly as hell and the dude was essential to that 0-27 run in the playoffs. Quit riding him so hard.  He’s got one (prob 2) scoring titles. Allen iverson had 4, Kevin Durant has 4. There have been better scorers. Dude is having an insane hot streak but you’re acting like he’s the second coming of Jordan. Getting salty bc you’re a harden fan and he’s one of the most disliked players in the league."

Steph is way better than Kevin Durant on O it’s true
"Of course not, but I wasn’t going to miss that cheap shot at KD. Also, this reminds me that Jon Daly and Kevin Durant might be the two most opposite pro athletes I can think of. "
If you’re gullible enough to believe someone like Kevin Durant projects a legitimate image of self confidence then your opinion isn’t worth anything either.  
If Kevin Durant didn’t end the “always take the center” narrative then idk what will
"Dude Kevin Durant only won a ring after joining a 73-9 win team, so are you telling me that he ain’t satisfied with NBA career?"
"*make the finals, but not win, which is why they needed Kevin Durant. I'm not even sure make the finals, people seem very convinced the Spurs would have beat them if Kawhi were healthy."
"KD is only 6'10.5"" without shoes. Charles Barkley was 6'4.5"". So, saying that Charles Barkley was 6'6 is like saying that Durant is 7'.  Not as outrageous as Kevin Love that he is 6'10 when he has been measured 6'7.75 without shoes and he was playing with Lebron who is exactly the same height and listed 6'8, even if he doesn't have a recent reliable. But, we saw them standing near each other many times.  NOTE: I love that KD is listed 6'9."

"I don't disagree with you in the general sense. However on this particular play, I'm not even sure you can consider that a missed call.  Durant didn't have any part of his body in bounds the entire time he was pursuing that loose ball. It's not like he was tip-toeing the line and had was barely out. His entire body was over the baseline.  The ref was in position and looking right at the play. That's not a missed call. That was an intentional ""I'm not calling Kevin Durant out of bounds at a deciding moment in this game."" The ref just clearly did not want to make that call. That is a problem.  I get that the NBA can be exceedingly difficult to officiate. The players are big, strong, and fast. In real-time it can be nearly impossible to determine whether a player traveled or if one of those steps was a gather step. With limbs flailing all over the place, it can be hard to determine who initiated contact (or even if there was any contact at all).  This wasn't one of those situations though. That was an easy call that the ref clearly intentionally did not make. That needs to be addressed.  As a side note...  In all the discussion about the Durant missed out of bounds call, everyone is forgetting the call that went to replay and didn't get overturned. Maybe they have different camera angles than what we see on the broadcast, but it pretty clearly looked like the ball just slipped out of Draymond's hands and went out of bounds. They looked at it on replay and somehow still said it was Golden State's ball. I never heard any explanation on that call either."

"&gt; First of all, you need to match salaries to trade players.  You're the one that brought up that hypothetical trade, not me.     &gt; Second, dsj isn’t good this year   He's been okay this year.  Much better than last year.  Maybe you should watch the Mavs play sometime.     &gt; Third, as much as i hate to say it, Utah doesn’t get good free agents so that is useless money.  Don't be ridiculous.  Utah can sign B-tier free agents comparable to Rubio &amp; Favors easily.  We're not exactly talking Kevin Durant here.   &gt; And finally, they are both expiring so you’re money argument is meaningless  What are you talking about?  That argument doesn't even make sense.  The fact that they're expiring is precisely the reason why they're not worth much in the trade market.     DSJ is locked into a cheap rookie contract.  You can fit him into the cap and still have $28M to sign players equivalent to Rubio &amp; Favors in free agency.  You can even sign Rubio himself... because y'know, he's a free agent 7 months from now.  Sheesh.     "
Kevin Durant can do all the moves they can
"The Philadelphia 76ers have never won a game in OKC and have lost the 18 games they've played against us.  &amp;#x200B;  Since the trio came together in 2009 one of Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant or James Harden has lead the league in total points scored every single year except for last year. They also have 7/9 scoring titles with an 8th one likely to come this season."
&gt;Kevin Durant can do all the moves they can   What 
Kevin Durant is
No. Kevin Durant is scoring more points and dishing out more assists on better efficiency. 
Watching Brandon Ingram run your offense is like watching Kevin Durant if he grew his hair out and stopped caring about basketball after they moved the team from Seattle to OKC.

"&gt; The Thunder Lost Harden because they were cheap as fuck, not because it used to be hard to retain multiple stars.  Not entirely, or effectively true.  If the salary cap is 50M, there's a significant different in the affordability of a team with the salary cap is say, 80M.  That extra 30M allows you 1) include another max slot player (if you choose) or multiple other players, and 2) avoids the line for the luxury tax, repeater tax, and even the hard cap under certain circumstances.  Were they cheap as fuck?  Maybe.  Or it could be they didn't think they could/should pay the max to Harden when all of Russ, KD, and Ibaka took haircuts on their 2nd deals.  As well as his performance during the 2012 Finals being fresh in their minds.  With the luxury tax trigger, that extra 4-5M in salary paid to James would have meant more like 2x or 2.5x with the luxury tax penalty.  With the huge jump in the salary cap in the coming years, James's salary differential would have cost them just that.  And OKC isn't a market that could have (then) predicted their future success would allow them to be able to afford so much more.  Here's a great ""what if"" article from BBallBreakdown:  [What if the Thunder never traded James Harden](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/09/21/okc-thunder-hadnt-traded-james-harden/)  The most salient point from that is:  ""While new deals for Harden and Ibaka **would have sent the team into luxury-tax territory**, both players’ new contracts wouldn’t have counted toward the luxury tax until the final day of the 2013-14 season, as Danny Leroux noted at [Sporting News](http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-thunder-vs-warriors-russell-westbrook-james-harden-trade-okc/1tt026yq1lmjj1vh97biyotfwf) last November. **Had the Thunder slashed salary elsewhere between the fall of 2012 and the spring of 2014, they could have potentially dodged luxury-tax payments** while retaining all four members of their young core. Given the drastic salary-cap increases in recent years, their mistake is retroactively even more glaring.""  1) the luxury tax was coming - 2) the Thunder would have had to slash and burn the bench for 2 straight years to stay under - 3) the drastic spike in the salary cap was *retroactively* more important, meaning it probably a foreseeable mistake.  I say that because if the Thunder knew about it, they wouldn't have traded James Harden.  Period."

It's not a playoff vs regular season debate it's an overall scoring debate. Harden over Kd at least has some merit. Harden has more 40 point games than Durant in his career (67 vs 63). Lebron James though has 91.   James Harden has 11 50 points games in his career. Kevin Durant has 6. Lebron James has 13.  James Harden's career high is 60 points. Kevin Durant's career high is 54. Lebron James career high is 61.  Harden is shooting 30 times a game to average 40 points. He ends up averaging a big flashy number but he is shooting it a shit ton he is shooting 40% FG the last 6 games while averaging 42ppg.   Harden's regular season career average is 23.5ppg. His playoff career average is 22ppg.   Lebron's regular season career average is 27.2ppg. His playoff career average is 28.9ppg.  Last year Harden averaged 28.6ppg in the playoffs. Lebron averaged 34ppg in the playoffs.   Last year against the Warriors in the playoffs Harden averaged 28.7ppg on 53% TS. Last year against the Warriors Lebron James averaged 34ppg on 62% TS.  Like it is not even close Lebron James is in the fact the best scorer in the nba since Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain.
"Or cheered much, much louder for prospective free agent Kevin Durant than prospective free agent Gordon Hayward but that didn't fit the ""Boston is racist! Only cheers for white players!"" narrative. "
Kevin Durant is not the greatest scorer ever. By what measure is he the greatest scorer ever lmao.
"This is great news for all skinny African American men 6'9"" and over with plus wingspans. All of you are now apparently are one of the most talented scorers in NBA history due to your vague resemblance to Kevin Durant. Just be careful and make sure not to end up playing with this pesky LeBron James guy who is going to suck all of your talent out apparently. "
"Brandon Ingram looks exactly like, moves exactly like, shoots exactly like, plays exactly like, acts and talks exactly like Kevin Durant. They're practically twins and almost the exact same person except Ingram is like maybe less than 5% worse than KD and is suffering in year 3 because of LeBron. You can't teach that type of excessively long length. He effortlessly shoots over people, blocks shots and grabs rebounds. Maybe he needs to add about 20 lbs so that he can bang with people in the post and he'd be a perfect player. It's just that LeBron ball has completely killed any type of confidence building momentum that Ingram had heading into the season. He was going to break way way out this year. Make no mistake... Ingram would already be heading to the All-Star game and probably averaging close to 35 ppg this year if he had his own team. Instead, all he ever does is just stand out there and watch LeBron dribble for 40 minutes a night which has killed any sort of rhythm he had coming into the season. It has killed all of his development momentum and deprived us of a guy that has the potential to go down as the GOAT player. LeBron is an MVP caliber player but I mean, clearly him and Ingram don't mesh very well. The Lakers need to get rid of LeBron or Ingram so that Ingram can flourish and take his spot amongst the MVP candidates that he so clearly deserves."

"But nothing about Kevin Durant, LMAO"
"&gt;If he’s going out of his way to make a more difficult shot and finishing through contact, why not get rewarded.  The finishing through contact is not the problem, it's the not trying to finish once you've initiated contact that is pretty lame.   Harden trying to fish for a foul by kicking his leg out on the last shot of this game I couldn't care less about cause A) the ref didn't call that BS anyway and B) he actually tried and did make the shot. Tell me this game wouldn't be wack if you replaced all the mind blowing shots he made with a flail, no attempt at making the shot, and free throws?  Or if the Rockets won off of a BS foul, or if the Warriors won off a BS non call? Should Kevin Durant be praised because he found a way to outsmart the system and get away with an out of bounds save?  This game was awesome BECAUSE Harden (and others) made huge shots and either wasn't fishing or wasn't getting the calls for it in the second half. That's what I want to see, but people would rather watch him be ""rewarded"" for playing ""smart"" than watch him do incredible things. That just doesn't make sense to me other than to say we watch the game for very different reasons I suppose."
"I made this comment in the other thread and I'd add I usually side with Jimmy at a founding member of the Jimmy Butler Fan Club's Denver Chapter but Jimmy's role on this team should be somewhat diminished from what he is used to due to the talent he is surrounded by.  You want Embiid (in scoring position) to be your #1 option and Simmons should have the ball in his hands the vast majority of the rest of the time due to his ability to facilitate as well as create for himself.  This leaves Jimmy to anchor the 2nd unit, bail out late shot clock possessions and close out games. I could see him arguing for more of an opportunity to anchor the 2nd unit and get more touches then, but he needs to understand he's more of the Klay Thompson role on this Philly team than Kevin Durant or Steph Curry."
"I dunno man, if you're seriously going to act like a dude that was out the last 2 games in CP3, and a good but not elite center, and a guy that missed every shot and then barely did anything the next year so much so he got shipped off by the worst team in the conference are somehow equivalent to Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green, I don't really know what to say.   If GSW lost last year to the Rockets, it would be an all time choke job. LBJ became the GOAT for beating that same GSW team WITHOUT KD, and that's with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love next to him. But now we're going to pretend the GSW All Stars are really not All Stars and aren't all that good? That Ariza, Capela, Ryan Anderson and the like are equivalent? Yeah....I just don't know where any discussion would start from or where it could go. "
Y'all see Kevin durant stepped out of bounds and took three steps but the refs still had they blind folds on and didn't see that
If you told me 3-4 years ago that Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant will one day be the villains of the NBA i’d be like “nah”

"The fine is for ""Criticizing referees publicly"" so I wonder how far they can take it. If Kevin Durant goes, ""I love the referees, they're so easy to fool, I think it's awesome that they miss so much"" does that get a fine?"
"I think this is a prime example of the ""star"" effect.  The ref was probably so caught up in watching **Kevin Durant** making some miraculous play, that he didn't notice that his entire body was out of bounds."
Kevin Durant should be thinking about joining the rockets. This is exactly what curry did to him before he joined the warriors lmao
Lol but did Jordan score a game winner after Kevin durant was running out of bonds
"Or it's the facts that:  * The team is underperforming even though there is talent, they're 2-3 since Christmas.  * Curry has missed a shit ton of games and will probably miss even more as he's injury prone  * He's playing with Kevin Durant so teams don't have to key on him more"
"We have the greatest scorer ever (Kevin Durant) still playing right now, but Stephen A is going to say something like this. Wow."
"I can see an argument for moving him for assets whether its picks or players with some control, but there is zero reason to trade him for a rental right now.  If Kevin Durant wants to come to Phily we can offload Fultz in the offseason if we need cap space, but Trevor Ariza (or any one rental wing) is not the difference between winning a title this year and not, that is for certain."
"So at what point did Kevin Durant think he was going to re-establish one foot in bounds here, let alone attempt to?  As bad as the no call was (one of the worst we've seen), I still don't know what Durant was trying to accomplish."
"Not much is public here, but we know that they both keep a scoring system for referees which means that the ""best"" games will go to the overall best referees, and in egregious cases, they're financially punished as well (i.e. salary deduction).  &gt;If there are consequences, I wish they were ones that mattered  So what do you actually want? Getting rid of every referee? Humans fail. You fail at your job. I fail at my job.. Tony Brown fails at his job. That's what we do.  The NBA referees are, without question, the best basketball referees in the world. But they're not infallible. Sometimes Kevin Durant goes 2-25, and sometimes Tre Maddox fucks up an out-of-bounds call.  Sports fans can be some of the most toxic people around, and there's nothing they love more than finding something to blame a ref for. "
"I mean statistically you're not wrong but it's like, which one of the two top 5 shooters of all time should I pass it to? Both are pretty good options and Kevin Durant also happens to be 7 feet tall lol"
"""Kevin Durant never left the court, so by our rules, he's still able to grab the ball."""
"Luke's been bad all three years. He's a good guy who most players respect, but that can only get you so far. This season our offense is dependent on LeBron (which it should be). With him going out, however,  it has exposed the lack of an offensive scheme on the Lakers' end that Luke has never been able to fix (most Laker fans have had to go through this for two years). He wanted to run an offense similar to the Warriors because it found him success during the time Kerr was out. The problem was that we don't have a Kevin Durant or a Steph Curry that can shoot the way they need to shoot.     The only play I've ever seen us run is the one where a player sets a back screen and someone runs to the paint for an easy alley oop.  &amp;#x200B;  His substitutions are also very bad. Sexton was demoralizing our offense in the paint and Luke refused to even think bout' bringing a center into the game."
"&gt; 4) Joining a super team is not the most competitive thing to do, but given points 1-3, joining a team like GS makes sense from the player's own personal standpoint. You and I can be as salty as we want, but it made sense for KD.   You keep making this statement ""It makes sense"". But that's a conclusion without a premise. Why does it ""Make sense"" for the Croatian national soccer team to go put on France jerseys to make themselves win the game? It doesn't make sense at all to turn the cheats on in a video game just because you can. And Kevin Durant knew when he made the decision to join the Golden State Warriors that he was making a cheap ass move to win himself some cheap ass rings. He knew that from the day he did everyone who know that those rings aren't as valuable because the move he made to get them was unfair and uncompetive.   So I don't know what ""makes sense"" about that. You've place winning at all costs above everything else. And that's not how it works. You don't take a cout sized tennis racked into a tennis match. You don't a gun that fires baseballs at 500 mph onto a baseball field. You don't strap a rocket to your back to break the record in the 100m. Why not? It ""makes sense"" according to you to do whatever you can do to win.   For the last time  THATS NOW WHAT SPORTS ARE ABOUT.   Sports are about competion and fair play. And when you game the rules of NBA basketball to amass a team with 5 allstars on you didn't win NBA. You gamed the system. You may have your rings but everyone knows just how much they mean.   &gt;Compare a free agent signing with GS to OJ killing his wife, that is insanity.  Don't confuse your inability to follow the points of analogy with insanity. That's like saying that because someone said ""that's apples and oranges"" that it's a bad analogy because it's not actual fruit. I'm not comparing murder to cheating in basketball. I'm pointing out to you that just because someone is a great player doesn't mean they deserve respect.   If they make immoral decisons it effects the way you should view them as a person. KD's decisons were unethical because they broke the spirit of fairplay and competition. You don't have to murder your wife or steal from a grandma to be unethical. The same arguments your using have been made to excuse every unethical sports move of the past. From Pete Rose to Lance Armstrong. But it doesn't change what they are.   Excuses that you're making to justify jumpinng on a bandwagon.   &gt;But the Lebron comparison works. Lebron joined an organization that already had won a ring with the Finals MVP still playing, and had an All Star on it. Sure, he brought in another all star, but the reality is that although the Heat were struggling, they had lots in place to make a run with two new all stars. He didn't go to a team like the Wolves who had zero championship experience. Sure, they weren't the Warriors, but let's not pretend he joined a crap franchise.  What the fuck are you even talking about. You just pointed out that they were entirely different scenarios but then try to make it seem like it's the same thing. It's not the fucking same thing. You just acknowledged they're not the same thing. But because Lebron didn't join the fucking Timberwolves then they're the same thing? That's your argument? Lebron didn't jump on a back to back finalists and championship team that just had the back to back MVP and the winningest record in NBA history.   THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. |   It's okay to make a team with 3 allstars because it's still comptitve it's not okay to make a team with 5 allstars who's already stacked above the entire league. How can you not understand that?  If you can't see the difference then your head is shoved to far up Kevin Durants ass to see the light of day. "

ESPN: Kevin Durant disagrees with Kerr's coaching ability
He got to game 7 of the WCF against the best team of all time while having a lower FT rate than Kevin Durant throughout the playoffs. He’s pretty good either way.
Is Luka that much of a liability on defense? During the 4th Jalen Brunson was assigned to guard Kevin Durant while Luka played safety in the lane on Draymond
"Honestly, what a dumbass way to end this game.   Barnes tried to go fucking hero ball against Kevin Durant. "
"Yeah I would get NBA league pass and watch some Nuggets games. Jokic is a C but passes like a (very gifted) PG. Denver also has a great young core aside from him and they are #1 in the West right now. Most people doubt they can actually beat the Warriors in 7 games; but if Kevin Durant leaves Golden State, the West is wide open for them next year."
The Warriors are the most stacked team in the league and it's not close  The top players are   LeBron James (top 3 player ever)  Kevin Durant and Steph Curry (both on the warriors)  James Harden (reigning MVP)  Kawhi Leonard  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Anthony Davis  The Warriors have won 3 of the last 4 championships. 
If I was a rookie and saw Kevin Durant creeping up on me to take me on alone I think I would shit my pants. Luka is incredible
"It's not based on your flair at all. You said that there wasn't any player in the ASG that Hayward wasn't clearly better than; I provided the example of Kobe, because 17-3-3 on bad percentages isn't an All-Star.  From 2016:  *Four players are averaging at least 20 points, five rebounds and three assists per 36 minutes in addition to shooting 37 percent or better from three-point range.*  *Gordon Hayward is one of them.*  *Curry, Kevin Durant and Paul George are the other three—and each is an All-Star starter.*  *Playing for an injury-riddled, potentially lottery-bound Utah Jazz team may have hurt Hayward's chances. The (rightful) inclusion of Green also didn't do him any favors. After all, how many point forwards can you have on one All-Star roster?*  *In this versatility-obsessed NBA? As many as possible. Hayward fits the All-Star bill, and the prospect of a Curry-Harden-Durant-Hayward-Green lineup should have been enough to get him a reserve nod.*"
Kevin “catch and shoot” durant
"Kevin Durant is an ass, I met him in Vegas when the Warriors had training camp there. We were playing poker at Mandalay bay at the same table and he was winning and talking shit to everyone. Someone asked him if he used to play for the Sonics and I called him Gary Payton on purpose and he got really pissed and shut up. When he was leaving he turned to me and said, ""I""m not Gary Payton."""
"For Kevin Durant, I think a case can be made for the last game of his Supersonics rookie season where he scored 42 points against Golden State.  While he had as stellar rookie season, it had ups &amp; downs like any rookie season. His 42-point performance was the cherry on top his Rookie of the Year cake, and by the time he did this everyone knew we were dealing with a very special player."
"""If we get RJ Barrett, Kevin Durant and a healthy Kristaps, we could be decent."""
"No clue why so many people are disagreeing with you here, you're completely right.   The issue with raw plus/minus is basically no matter how you slice it, there's a ton of contextualizing you need to do, essentially to the point where the stat alone means almost nothing.  For the 2019 Warriors for example, Kevon Looney is currently third in plus minus per 100 possesions, ahead of Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. The Warriors' net rating with Klay on the court is also 7.8 points worse than when he's not on the court. Is Klay's play overall a detriment to the team? Of course not, so then you have to look at reasons *why* the Warriors play so much better without him on the court, and there's a number of possible reasons you'd have to look at: Who's he generally on the court with? What lineups is he generally playing against? Who's rotating in for him when he's on the bench? The fact that you kind of have to consider these questions when looking at any individual plus minus makes it pretty useless to me."
Wanted Kevin Durant to become an NBA champion for the longest time; didn't realize he would take the easiest road to do it and be the most disputed NBA champion ever.

"&gt; They're always less efficient than taking another step in or step back to the three.   But they’re not inefficient, and those two pointers open up his driving game. It was only when he started shouting those long twos that Kawhi’s offensive game exploded; that’s not coincidental. There’s also massive value in being able to always create a decent shot at any moment in time, a la Kevin Durant.   Not everyone can be Harden, and I feel like people don’t understand that. Some (though few) guys probably should take more two pointers instead of constantly looking for the 3 or layup. Eric Gordon, for instance, would probably be a much more efficient player if there was a threat of his pull-up two.   Most players should take less. For most superstars and elite scorers, though, the mid range still has great value. A lot of this is because in the playoffs/close games, defense tightens up. [In these scenarios, a midrange shot in general is actually statistically better than 3 pointers](https://twitter.com/knarsu3/status/493143394248851456?s=21).   The midrange isn’t a shot that every role player out there needs to (or even should) master. They should be working on their 3s and driving and finishing and passing. But the midrange shot is still often what separates pretty good players/all stars from superstars. "
"Haha, I usually do this on articles because I understand where you're coming from, but this time I decided not to because I started to feel like people didn't actually cared about reading articles that much to want them on reddit (when they can't access the font). Thank you for showing I was wrong!  So, I'll do it in two parts because of the length of it, hope you don't mind.    ----- &amp;nbsp;  #How Cedi Osman earned LeBron James' respect and built a special bond that goes beyond basketball  &amp;nbsp;  The relationship between Cedi Osman and LeBron James got off on the wrong foot. Literally.  ""The thing I remember clearly is how quiet that gym got,"" Cavs head coach Larry Drew recalls about Sept. 27, 2017. ""Practice is going. There's all the talk, all the chatter and then that happened and it was just total silence.""  There was Osman, a rookie taking part in his first official NBA training camp. He had left Turkey and was in a new country, trying to prove that he belonged, trying to earn the respect of his new teammates that had only known him from grainy YouTube clips and a Head and Shoulders commercial.  Then in his opening scrimmage, he stepped on James' foot, sending the franchise player hobbling off the court with a nasty ankle sprain.  ""Man, Cedi saw his life -- and his career -- flash before his eyes,"" Channing Frye told cleveland.com while laughing. ""He was about to be on the first flight back to Istanbul.""  In a strange twist, that was James' first glimpse of the qualities he has come to appreciate. That terrifying moment actually sparked what has become a tight bond between James and Osman.  ""That was the time when I felt I started earning that respect,"" Osman said. ""That's what he liked to see, that I'm fighting hard, that I'm working hard.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Beyond basketball  On Feb. 7, 2018, following weeks of tension and questions about the season slipping away, James rescued the Cavaliers once again. He punctuated his triple-double with a game-winning fade-away jumper at the buzzer that gave Cleveland renewed hope. While the Minnesota Timberwolves were left in shock, James went sprinting toward his teammates. Well, one in particular. Osman.  The two jumped for joy and chest-bumped. It was the kind of celebration that made it seem like they had known each other for years.  It took time to get to that point.  Most of the early conversations weren't even about basketball. The intention was for James to learn about Osman the person. The two discussed their love of soccer. James would ask Osman about European culture. Osman would inquire about James' younger days growing up as a basketball prodigy while also facing plenty of hardships along the way.  Eventually, road trips led to lunches and dinners. It was small group of four. James, Osman, Jeff Green and Jose Calderon.  Osman and Calderon favor classical music. James and Green love rap.  ""Every moment we had together was amazing because every day we were on the road we were talking about something different,"" Osman said.  As the season progressed, James started singling out Osman in postgame interviews, praising the rookie for his basketball IQ, work ethic, hustle and professional approach.  ""For me, every practice with him, dinner, lunch, being together was special. It was my favorite,"" Osman said. ""I will say I was really proud when he was talking about me to the media. What he was saying about me, all that good stuff, that was really special to me.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Exclusive summer workout  It was Game 5 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals. As the clock ticked down, James launched a 3-pointer at the buzzer that dropped through the net and gave the Cavaliers a 3-2 series lead over the feisty Indiana Pacers.  Just like his heroics a few months earlier against the Timberwolves, James rushed toward his teammates to celebrate.  Once again, Osman was there to catch him mid-flight.  That photo was the same one Osman used for his heartfelt Instagram post on July 2, the day after James announced his decision to join the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BkvoE7InqB-  ""Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best,"" Osman wrote. ""And there are remarkably rare ones, who just bring out the most of everything that even you don't know that you have. They build you up. They make you feel alive. They make you feel strong. They make you feel indisputable. From the first moment we met, you've always been that rare one for me, King.  ""I don't believe in coincidences. I choose to believe my path crossed with you for a reason. And that reason will be uncovered as I continue to walk through. Please accept my highest gratitude for your support and appreciation for your inspiration. I'm truly blessed to have been surrounded by your charm.""  Even though James was headed for LA, Osman believed the two would still stay close. During Las Vegas Summer League, they got together for dinner.  That's when James extended an invitation to Osman, asking his former teammate if he was interested in an exclusive workout with some of the league's best small forwards.  James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Osman.  ""What do you expect me to say? I said, 'Of course, you know, that would be perfect,'"" Osman said. ""First day we worked out together and then the next day he said we were going to work out with KD and Kawhi. I was like so excited and said, 'Wow, three best small forwards in the world and I'm going to have opportunity to learn from them and work out with them.'  ""That's something I will not forget ever. Because always watching them on the TV when I was a kid or playing the games with them and then one time practicing with them so it was an amazing feeling.""  https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmwqhy7H2L7  Osman remembers being a nervous wreck taking jumpers alongside those perennial MVP candidates. He can still picture himself clanking outside jumpers off the front of the rim before Durant gave him a pointer to help his form.  In a way, it was like those early days inside Cleveland Clinic Courts, when James welcomed Osman into his post-shootaround group.  ""Cedi is an awesome human being and I think the way he plays lends itself to, like most people who are around him want him to be really, really good,"" Frye said. ""I think Bron just took that and saw that Cedi has a fire so Bron is like, well I'm going to continue to stoke it. I think Bron and Cedi, their relationship is more like big brother, little brother. It's a great relationship for Cedi. I think it's good for Bron to have somebody that looks up to him.""  &amp;nbsp;  #Checking in  Osman has James' number but he doesn't want to be a bother. He usually attempts to text James once or twice every two weeks just to catch up and see how the season is going. It's their way of keeping the relationship strong despite being thousands of miles away.   In November, when Osman was forced to miss a pair of games with back spasms, James reached out.  ""He was asking how I was feeling and stuff like that,"" Osman said. ""He's my favorite player in the world but having him ask how my back is and caring about me, that's something that's really special.""  When James returned to Cleveland on Nov. 21, he embraced his former teammates prior to tipoff. Then Osman got a few chances to guard James during the game, something Osman had been thinking about since James' departure in free agency.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BqfWZknl_9O  The Lakers got the best of the Cavs, 109-105, as James delivered yet another reminder of what Cleveland no longer has.  After the LA win, James sipped down a banana milkshake from Swenson's and reflected on his 11 years in Cleveland. He also heaped more praise on Osman.  ""My relationship has grown even stronger with Cedi even though I've been on another coast,"" James said. ""I've been keeping up with him throughout this season and the best thing I told him tonight, I told him, 'You finally took my advice and started wearing Nikes.'""  So what was it about Osman -- a wide-eyed, over-eager, unpolished rookie when they first met -- that made James take him under his wing?  ""By showing up on time, every single day. Putting in the work every single day. And being a professional every single day,"" James said. ""Cedi is one of my favorite guys that I've played with and it was only a year, but he's a sponge and you can see that he has a love of the game.""  "
Remember how everyone decided to ignore the implications of the Kevin Durant call because Houston won the game?  The league will probably shrug their shoulder over this too.  The refs aren't held accountable for awful mistakes and they'll continue to fuck up.
"I don't understand why you want to make an argument out of this, I agree with you on most levels. Here are the facts:  1) Golden State was a better team than OKC  2) The Bay Area is a great place to live if you are super wealthy.  3) Kevin Durant is a great player.  4) Joining a super team is not the most competitive thing to do, but given points 1-3, joining a team like GS makes sense from the player's own personal standpoint. You and I can be as salty as we want, but it made sense for KD.   I didn't want KD to join GS. But his decision wasn't immoral. He didn't steal from an old lady or something to sign with GS. He didn't murder his wife, what the hell is wrong with you? Compare a free agent signing with GS to OJ killing his wife, that is insanity.  But the Lebron comparison works. Lebron joined an organization the already had won a ring with the Finals MVP still playing, and had an All Star on it. Sure, he brought in another all star, but the reality is that although the Heat were struggling, they had lots in place to make a sun with two new all stars. He didn't go to a team like the Wolves who had zero championship experience. Sure, they weren't the Warriors, but let's not pretend he joined a crap franchise.  I'll let you have the last word though, so please respond to this with the saltiest most Hater-ade comment you can muster. Tell me how much you hate KD and think he is akin to a murderer. "
Kevin Durant
"&gt;James invited Osman to an exclusive summer workout: LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant  Wtf are they plotting?"
"I'm sorry but this just reads like someone who has absolutley no context on sports period if you're making this kind of read on the situation. According to your logic every player in the NBA every year should just go get in line with the team who won the last champsionship and do tryouts to try to get on the team. There are rules in the NBA to prevent this EXACT THING from happening. Because it's uncompetitive. It's unsportsmanlike. It's against every concept of fair play. It's like if Croatia was going up against France in the World Cup and half the Croatian team just went and put on France jerseys because they knew would be more likely to win that way.   If that's the way you view sports I feel bad for you. Because it seems to me like you're just looking to confirm your bias in this particular instance.   Durants move was unsportsmanlike, uncompetitive and he should have known when he mad that decision that people would point that out to him. It's like turning on the cheats in a video game. Can you do it? Absolutley. So why not? Why not beat the game faster and easier just so that you can say you won? Because you and me both know that's not the point of the game. The point of the game is to win the game fairly. When you make moves that undermine the fairneess of the game and stack a team with 2 mvps, 5 allstars, the winningest record in NBA history, back to back finals and 2 championships. You and me and everyone else knows that's not fair. And Kevin Durant sold that spirit of fair play to win a ring. There's nobody who respects sports who respects winning that way.   No one is going to deny Kevin Durant is a great player. But if being a great player made you deserve respect we'd all still respect OJ Simpson. Being a moral person is more important than being a great player and KD proved that he is lacking in morals and ethics when he sold out and sullied the fairplay of NBA basketball. That's something you can never win back with however millions of dollars or NBA championships you have.   And i'm sick and tired of people bringing Lebron into it. Lebron joined 2 all stars on a lottery team the year after KD, Pierce, and Allen destroyed the league and he couldn't even win a championship it's first year. If Lebron had done what KD had done he would have gone and signed with the Celtics. But he didn't. He's never done anything close to what KD did. He's always tried to make competitive teams that can compete against the best in the league. KD jumped on the winningest team of all time coming off back to back finals and a championship. "
"1. You just linked me to a FOOTBALL video to prove why Kevin Durants move in the NBA wasn't dirty. Next thing you're going to link me to a video of a guy punting the ball in the NFL to tell me Draymond Green is dirty kicking dudes in the crotch.   2. At no point in the video did Kevin Durant do the ""swim move"" as demonstrated in the video. Can you please time stamp me to the video where he says ""Punch the guy in the chest then try to get around him."""
"""I'm against Kevin Durant. And I'm not ashamed to admit it."""
"This goes well with my current favorite best lineup.   Big Sharpshooters: Kevin Durant (SG), Larry Bird (SF), Dirk Nowitzki (PF)   \+  Big Dunkers: Giannis Antetokounmpo (PG). Shaquille O'Neal (C)   &amp;#x200B;"
"Yup, he was the “Brazilian Kevin Durant” it was suppose to be."
"Nah I'm agreeing with the comment above mine which says Tatum is overrated. Although it's kinda petty to say I'm mocking people for not agreeing with the popular opinion, I'm mocking a clear homerism considering the massive difference between Embiid and Tatum. I mean, is Victor Oladipo better than Kevin Durant? No"
"As Kevin Durant finished drinking Scarlet Johansson’s bathwater, Portis was on the sideline watching and waiting. When Portis saw Durant finish, he started walking towards him. Durant saw Portis and sped up, running away to his Twitter Burner as Portis yelled “That wasn’t inadvertent! That wasn’t inadvertent!” with his fist out."
I'd rather never have a ring until the heat death of the universe than win a ring with Kevin Durant. It'd be like ending your virginity with a prostitute. He's a sacred bitch who hated this city and we hate him even more. 
Like I said before Ernie is a retarded genius. You want a solid role player just get one of the guys that sucks ass on our team and he’ll play great for you. Otto Porter will prolly turn into fucking Kevin Durant after we trade him 
Top ten MVP candidates according to Basketball Reference (based on past voting patterns):  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden  3. Anthony Davis  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Kevin Durant  6. Nikola Jokic  7. Stephen Curry  8. Joel Embiid  9. LeBron James  10. Paul George  Many would put Harden ahead of Giannis because Harden has been historically hot in the last month.  Keep in mind that team record is a big component of this formula.
"LeBron James and Kevin Durant deserve more than the Max. But even if we ignore that, Hayward, pre-injury, was also made an impact on the defensive end, and had ball handling skills. He was skilled at almost all aspects of the game. Jack of all trades, master of none. That also isn't to say he is only okay at any one of these traits. He is legitimately skilled. It's more than 20ppg. It's defensive impact, it's spacing, it's ball handling, it's most aspects of the game. He was at the start of his Prime, 26-27 years old is a normal start to a prime, and it's not everyday someone STARTING their prime are available. He is absolutely worth the Max based off ALL these factors coming together."
Guy who average 20ppg once on his contract year is not worth the same amount as Kevin Durant and Lebron James.
"Love the ""you're not allowed to go out of bounds unless you are Kevin Durant"" comment. "
"""You aren't allowed to walk out of bounds in these league unless you're Kevin Durant""   Never change Marlowe"
Never forget that Kevin Durant and Terrance Ross have the same career high's
unfortunately for exposure Los Angeles is just the bigger market so you can really build your brand. Smaller midwest markets don't have that kind of clout. But the NBA is going to face a crisis in the coming years where big markets are going to attract the free agents with lower payouts (like Kevin Durant) simply because of the increased exposure for their brand.
“Last of The SuperSonics” Produced by Kevin Durant
I know this is based off of official measurements but kevin Durant looks like he's much taller than 6'9
"I think what he is saying is that it'd be a bit ridiculous for Curry to tell his FO he doesnt want to bring in KD. Maybe they respect that request, but not many players are making that request to begin with. Sure, it might start to bug him down the road if he wasnt totally cool with it, but Curry doesn't really need to be praised for being willing to share the court with Kevin Durant."
"Then use per 100 possessions.    LeBron James: 28.0p, 7.9a, 7.3r Luka Dončić: 29.8p, 7.3a, 10.0r Kevin Durant: 29.2p, 3.5a, 6.3r"
"Mommy, Kevin Durant was mean to me on the internet!   Like I said, they should. But they won’t. "

So here's the deal about Bradley. Ill give you what the people who think he's killing the Clippers think and the perspective Doc is alluding to regarding players/coaches in the NBA.   1) There are few teams who upgrade more going to their bench than when LAC does going from Bradley to Lou Williams. He's been a worthless offensive player. [Atrocius finishing at the rim](https://stats.nba.com/player/202340/shooting/) and almost as many mid ranger shots as 3s. Doesn't accept his skill set for what it is.    2) This is where the Bradley disconnect comes on defense. The other night vs Denver was an another ex of it.   a) There is no player in the NBA harder to try and drive on and get to the rim in ISO. That's not an exaggeration. Nobody is better with lateral foot speed and balance than Bradley. And he will hound your dribble. Watch Jamal Murray vs him the other night or any guard nobody could do it and they repeatedly got hounded when they tried. This is what coaches and players see and why they love him.    b) His size issues are overblown. Per matchup data heading into this year as an ex here is how he did when defending Jimmy Butler    324 poss: Butler had 68 pts(20.9 pts/100 poss well below his average) on 49% TS.   It's easy to find [examples of games like this where he just shut down 6'10 Paul George](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021600440/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=202340). Brad Stevens even once asked him to guard Kevin Durant and he [held KD to 10 pts on 6 shot attempts in 38 poss](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021600179/matchups/?OFF_PLAYER_ID=&amp;DEF_PLAYER_ID=202340) which is totally fine.   c) So why does his on/off defensive data suck?  Problem is in today's NBA watch star players drive to the rim and the majority of their drives will involve a screen. In the context of NBA defnense moving your feet and preventing ISOs looks super cool but it's not that important. You have to be able to fight over screens [and Celtics Blog did a great job on this 2 years ago but Bradley ever since getting shoulder surgery often avoids contact on this](https://www.celticsblog.com/2016/12/19/13994518/state-of-the-boston-celtics-is-avery-bradley-an-elite-defender). Hence guys can still drive or get pull up 3s on him. Guys also do a ton of catch and shoot plays off screens and the same issue exists. You don't need to hold the ball for a while to score in the NBA and that's why Bradley's value suffers.    d) He's also not a great help defender at all doenst understand NBA rotations and is too focused on his own man. Here is an interesting stat from 2015-17 when the Celtics had to face DeRozan/Lowry/Wall/Beal/Kemba/Lillard/CJ McCollum/Steph Curry/Klay THompson/Kyrie/Dragic guess when the Celtics def rating was higher. Was it higher when Isaiah Thomas guarded these guys or was it higher when AB guarded them? It was 8 pts higher when IT4 did.   Which again shows the limitations of being great moving your feet on the ball like AB. 
"As Russell Westbrook finished his warmup for the Warriors game, GS Small Forward Kevin Durant was on the sideline watching and waiting. When Durant saw Westbrook finish, he started walking towards him. Russ saw Durant and sped up, running away to the Thunder locker room as Durant yelled “Hardest road! This has been tough!” with his rings out."

James Harden and Kevin Durant  Luka and LeBron are definitely both top 5
At least we didn't mess up too bad. Imagine if we did something really boneheaded like taking Greg Oden ahead of Kevin Durant. Now that would be an enormous oopsie
"Harden averaged 17 PPG on 66 TS% his final year with the Thunder. He had a +20 net rating, an On-Off of +8.0, an OBPM of +5.6, WS/48 of .230.  I know Thunder fans are trying to play revisionist history that this wasn't one of the dumbest trades in NBA history when it was done, and you couldn't foresee it coming, but he had the highest net rating, On-Off, OBPM, and WS/48 on his team.  Kevin Durant finished 2nd in MVP voting that season, and James Harden, on the same team, had the same WS/48, which is one of the best predictors for MVP.  That last season, Harden was 2nd in the NBA in TS%, behind only Tyson Chandler. Harden was also 2nd in eFG%, again behind Tyson, so people can shove their ""unsustainable free throws"" theory out the ass. 3rd highest offensive rating, again, behind Tyson Chandler, and Chris Paul.   Only Lebron and CP3 had higher WS/48 than Harden. He was 4th in OBPM.  It would take a special kind of moron to trade Harden after that type of season at 22 years old."
"Ahh yes, the Greg Oden over Kevin Durant argument. "
"It shouldn't have been a hindsight thing, though.  I've posted about this before but I always get downvoted.  That last season together, despite their shit coach not using him that well, in the regular season Harden tied Kevin Durant for win shares. TIED. DURANT.  In the postseason that year, he was second to Durant, but still a strong second, and also had better advanced defensive stats than you might expect. He was *really fucking important* to that team, but OKC's management are often extremely bad at their jobs."
"There's nothing critical about that thinking. You're just trying to use semantics to belittle the point I'm making, which is that Kevin Durant would add significantly more than 6.5 wins to the Nets, meaning that the Nets would be higher than a 4th seed.  Also, if you want to nitpick the numbers, seeds 1-4 are winning often against the Nets right now, but they would have worse records if they started losing games to Durant's Nets. Therefore 6.5 wins added would most likely grant you a 3rd seed or above, and you would need LESS than 6.5 wins added to land you in the 4th seed, as I said."
"Except he probably wouldn't.   People love to circlejerk about the NCAA, and how their favorite Heroballer would do in it, and it's almost never what happens.  Steph, Durant, Harden all lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.  Russ actually went to two final fours [with an absolutely packed UCLA Team featuring Kevin Love, Darren Collison, Mbah a Moute, and tons of Eurostars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007–08_UCLA_Bruins_men%27s_basketball_team) and they still never won a Championship.  Rose was the last NBA MVP to really dominate at the NCAA level, and even he lost in the National Championship.  But yeah surely this time it would have been different."
"4th seed Philly is 6.5 games ahead of Brooklyn right now. You think that Kevin motherfucking Durant is adding less wins than that, are you crazy?"
"Wilt 126, Wilt 92, Oscar Robinson 79, Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant 72 (tied). he is fourth."
&gt; Kevin Durant is pretty good but let me tell ya this kevin durant guy is something else  I know Kevin Durant but who the heck is kevin durant???
Kevin durant has 3 streaks of 50+ games in this department

http://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=401071305  play by play. 7:32 in the 3rd.  &gt; Double technical foul: Bobby Portis and Kevin Durant
kevin durant was the first athlete who wanted to win
"By fans. I'm just not sure how he makes it when the coaches and players vote.   &amp;#x200B;  I love the guy. As someone who watches the Thunder more than I'd like, I really enjoy watching that guy play. The problem is the bigs in the West.   Anthony Davis  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Paul George  KAT  Jokic   Gobert  Donicic  Adams  Nurkic  Ayton  This list isn't in order other than the top 6. I think all of those guys get there. He's one hell of a basketball player and seems to be one hell of a guy to top it off. The west is just ridiculous though.   &amp;#x200B;"
"Exactly. The eye ball test, exclusive only to the highest of iqs, would not show Kevin Durant dropping 50 in Kawhi's face."
"Yes I would Kawhi over PG13, and that not me saying PG13 is not elite.       You want to bring up Kevin Durant, one of the greatest scorers in NBA history, scoring 50pts against Kawhi's team, but you seem to be forgetting that Andrew fucking Wiggins dropped 40pts on PG13 just 2 days ago...yea ok 😂😂  You are just a Kawhi haters dude, just say so and move on. Every time Kawhi plays against PG, Kawhi outplays him every time. Most people know this.  Bit you keep on hating tho 😂     "
Kevin Durant averages 50ppg against Kawhi
"**DEFENSE**  Kawhi Leonard's defense has slipped as his offensive load has increased. He is not the same defender he was a couple years ago when he was the DPOY.

"His free throw shooting is inconsistent the same as Lebron. If you watch him shoot them you'll notice as well. At the end of the last Bucks-Raps game he missed 2 straight free throws after being intentionally fouled. He has the same flaw as Lebron which is looking down at the ground right before shooting them which decreases his aiming time.  His defense has also slipped as his offensive load has increased.

He's an excellent player and is definitely well-rounded which is one of the components of being a superstar player. If you have weaknesses that can be exploited then you will be exposed and have less team success."
Kevin Durant &gt; Kawhi. Please stop the disrespect 
"I think in like 15 years the main thing people will remember is how lucky they were. Kevin Love and Kyrie injury, lost a Finals after being up 3-1, got Kevin Durant, only made it to the finals because of a CP3 injury and a fluke historically bad game from the rockets."
He should be blamed when they fail and credited when they succeed that's how it works. Even Kevin Durant took more flak when the Warriors were losing without Curry and Kd is very protected.
Brazilian Kevin Durant 
I used to like Zach Lowe but now  it's apparent his ego is out of control.   He clearly hates Russ as a player and a person. He's always taking shots at D Rose and Russ. Then gets emotional when their fanbase defends them   It's hilarious how he's  exactly the blog boy type that Kevin Durant was talking about 
"I’d disagree because I think the ability to control your movements with precision is every bit about athleticism. Imo harden isn’t near that tier of athlete though since he’s 6’5. Elite players at 6’5 should have good body control. Kevin Durant is a 7 footer who moves like a guard. That’s just insanity. He’s got peed, quickness, agility, and explosiveness. Maybe not on the same level as a guy like Westbrook, but again, he’s 9 inches taller. "
"Anthony Davis: Top 5 player the league  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson: Top backcourt in NBA  Westbrook, Durant, Ibaka: Westbrook is the only one Still in OKC, Durant went to join Steph and Klay, Ibaka now in Toronto  Demarcus Cousins: Went to join Steph, Klay, and KD, Played with AD the season before  Paul George: Plays with Russ  LeBron, Kevin Love, Kyrie irving: K-Love was abandoned in Cleveland  Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker: None of them play for the Spurs anymore  Dirk: Still truckin along in possibly his last season  James Harden: Top 3 player in the League  Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler: Neither of them on the Bulls  Camerlo Anthony: Washed AF  Chris Paul, Blake Griffin: Both on new teams, CP3 with Harden, Blake on the Pistons  Dwight Howard: A bootygoon  John Wall: Injured  DeMar Derozan: On the Spurs now  Damian Lillard, LaMarcus Aldridge: LMA now in San Antonio, Lillard still a Blazer  Dwyane Wade: Retires at season end"
"Kevin Durant is now the best player in the league  * Bill Simmons, the year before last"
"top player tiers  1: lebron  2: steph curry, kevin durant  3: james harden, kawhi leonard, anthony davis, giannis antetokounmpo   4: nikola jokic, joel embiid, paul george, kyrie irving, russell westbrook"
James Harden and Kevin Durant. 
"I love Simmons, but he's more like top 20 than top 10 right now.  I'd go: Giannis Antetokounmpo James Harden LeBron James Steph Curry Paul George Kevin Durant Anthony Davis Nikola Jokic Joel Embiid Kawhi Leonard  I think that's in order based only on this season, although from Davis downwards you can pretty much change the order since they're all so close together."
"That's a fair critique, the top teams do stay pretty good. It's the teams like Real Madrid or Scuderia Ferrari that have the money, history and heritage to just stay at the top forever. But what the European system does better is getting some change in the league or series team-wise. I mean, how long have the same teams been in the NBA? Last expansion was the Grizzlies? SuperSonics sort of went but they're basically just the Thunder now. The thing is, NBA is owned by the teams and the teams are the league. So in its current state it's impossible to relegate anybody. Imagine getting kicked out of something that's yours. So there will never be movement this way, there will never be upcoming teams from the lower ranks or stuff like that. American system makes the leagues as stale as the European system, just in a different way.  In Europe, organisations like FIFA or FIA are their own entity and the teams just compete within the series. What I like the most is this allows for much more politics between teams and the league, something that would be impossible in the NBA. For example, Ferrari could just leave F1 tomorrow if they wanted to, but obviously they want to stay for the exposure so they can sell cars to NBA players. If the FIA wants to change a rule and Ferrari opposes it, there is nothing they can do but threaten to exit F1. For the FIA and F1 this would be bad, because Ferrari is historically the most popular team and its departure would be a huge blow for the sport. Imagine Lakers leaving the NBA because they don't want the shotclock being reset to just 14 seconds after an offensive rebound.   This type of politics is super interesting a fan, as it creates a lot more storylines, you have everything that's going on on the pitch or the track to what's going on in Zürich or Paris or whatever.  I sort of got off topic there, but this all means that there is more change in the league. Some of the teams will always remain there, but there is always something new. More people get chances to compete on the top since more people who blow their chance get kicked out. Nothing says they can't get back, they just have to work for it. Not tank and wish for the highest odds.  Though, it's all about the money in the NBA as well. I mean, LeBron James went to Los Angeles, not Memphis. Kevin Durant went to the Bay, not Portland. Carmelo Anthony demanded a trade to New York, not Charlotte. Even with the draft it's the big markets that dominate most of the time.  Also, should be said, I don't think the NBA should change that much, just because it would be so impractical and after all the way NBA works has been moulded in American culture during many decades, it's how it should be. I'm just pointing out that it's not the best system in a vacuum. "
"Must really suck to have a team consisting of Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson but still need a fourth All-Star to win."
Kevin Durant???
" I think these are the locks:   James Harden  Damien Lillard  Paul George  Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  LeBron James  Nikola Jokic  &amp;#x200B;  That leaves 3 spots. A FC spot and two Wild Cards. I think it's going to come down to him, KAT, Booker, Doncic (who might make it as a starter), which would remove one of the WC spots from these locks), Conley, Klay, Marc Gasol, Devin Booker, Jrue Holiday, his teammate DeMar, and Tobias Harris.   Just looking at that list, I think he probably has a good shot to make it, especially with how he's been playing as of late. I think KAT, Booker and Klay are his biggest competition, and he has a good case against them. I'd give him \~55% chance of making the team in the West. "
"and look at the drop since the episode with kevin durant this season, dude does not do well with modest public humiliation "
Who is that fan wearing a kevin durant thunder t-shirt? What a goober. 
"Bro I think you underestimate the type of body control and coordination that Kevin Durant has. Athleticism is more than vertical. 7 footers should not be able to handle the ball and shoot the way Durant does, let alone even move that fluidly. It’s absurd to think about."
"Kevin Durant should never be a 1a/1b to any player in the world other than Steph, LeBron, and maybe the current James Harden. "
"Yup it’s true Kevin Durant averaged 110 points, 23 assists and 35 rebounds a game he literally did all of the work nobody else "
Kevin Durant definitely looks a lot like Jamie Fox.
"&gt;...there have only been 15 times a player's averaged over 2 and 1 across a season.

"I think a FMVP and Championship over Jordan puts him in the Top 10 to 15 range. He could possibly be ranked higher than say Bill Russell, Oscar, Kobe, Hakeem etc depending on who you ask, but I think his drop off in production the playoffs would keep him from anything higher than 8th or 9th.   He routinely didn't step up in the playoffs like most of the top 10 players. It's not that he was bad in the playoffs, but he definitely didn't elevate his play like MJ, Bird, Duncan, Dirk etc...   My current top 20 is: MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Magic, Bird, Wilt, Hakeem, Duncan, Shaq, Russell, Kobe, Oscar, Jerry West, Julius Erving, Karl Malone, Dirk, Moses Malone, KG, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant. With a FMVP and Championship over MJ I'd put him at 10th. "
For just 38 cents a day you can feed a Kevin Durant 
Kevin Durant
"If you prevent Kelly Olynyk from breaking Kevin Love, the Cavs could quite possibly have won the championship that year.  If the Cavs win in 2015, the Warriors still come out hungry, probably still go 73-9, but the Cavs and the league have less incentive for the level of fuckery that happened in those Finals. Warriors win in 2016.  Therefore:  - the greatest regular season in history is capped with a championship  - Warriors and Cavs each end up with 1 ring, still  - Warriors can't really make the pitch that they need Kevin Durant, and he has to go somewhere else.  - The Curry-Durant Warriors don't happen.  - Balance remains with the league  Everything a lot of people hate about the NBA right now changes if you just stop Kelly Olynyk. "
"Starters  James Harden Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant Anthony Davis Paul George  Reserves  Nikola Jokic LeBron James Damian Lillard Rudy Gobert Karl-Anthony Towns   ( Same as Zach Lowe’s, but Davis, Jokic for me was 6’s)   Westbrook is averaging a triple double right now, but his numbers for me aren’t as impressive in terms of effectiveness this year. That said he would be in.  The last spot is hard because in terms of impact and how they play I really want to give the last spot to Steven Adams. But L. Aldridge has been a beast for the Spurs, especially as of late. I watched his career night a couple weeks ago and he looked like a spry chicken playing out of his mind. I’d give the nod to Aldridge. "
"No you're right. Kevin Durant is the ultimate competitor. He's so brave. He's not a quitter like the rest of the league. He wouldn't quit on his team and take the easiest route possible. Kd said ""screw how talented they are"", and went to join them anyways lmao. Kd is flexing on em and we're all so impressed."
Bookers shorts is a KDrama I can get behind. Also a Kevin Durant themed KDrama. Anyohaseyo!
"You’re trying to tell me lebron “I’m Injured” james stands a chance against Steph, Klay, and Dray? Or Kevin “Basalisk” Durant?  This teams only hope is if Jaylen “the next Kawhi” Brown fucks around and goes for 17 pts on 39% FG"
Giving up is never the right answer. The right answer is players wanting to compete and pushing themselves to the limit to win. But players like Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins don't want to do that THEY are the ones who gave up not everyone else.
"Lebron is clearly behind Jordan as a scorer. I'm just saying he is not so far away that it gives Jordan a big advantage.  Scoring titles are meaningless because there is no consistent criteria. One year a player can win the 'title' averaging 29.1ppg the next year he can lose it averaged 29.9ppg. It's all relative to the other great scorers in the league at the same time as you.   The only great scorer that was competing with Jordan for the scoring title in 1990, 1992, and 1997 was Karl Malone. In 91 Karl Malone and Bernard King were the elite scorers competing with Jordan. In 93 it was Malone and Dominique. In 1997 it was just Malone. In 1998 it was Malone and Shaq.  Lebron was competing with Tracy McGrady, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, and James Harden. Not to mention guys like Gilbert Arenas and Anthony Davis popping up here and there.  Lebron is 2nd to Jordan in scoring in so many ways. MJ has the most 30 point games of all time. Wilt is 2nd. [*And Lebron is 3rd.*] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=E&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is well ahead of guys like Kobe and Kareem and they played 20 years to Lebron's 15.  By playoffs alone [Lebron is 1st all time in 30 point games nobody else is close to these two](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=30&amp;order_by=pts). Lebron is also first all time in playoff points.  He's [2nd all-time to Jordan in playoff 40 point games](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=career&amp;year_min=1947&amp;year_max=2019&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=40&amp;order_by=pts)  And if you factor in efficiency one could easily argue Lebron is as good of a scorer as Jordan--but that's not my belief or my argument. My point is, Lebron is 2nd or 3rd all-time as a scorer to Jordan and Wilt."
"We're still in the phase of being excited by the flashes he has where he'll take over the game and get hot.  Like during the OKC game, he was dominating them in the 4th/Overtime.  Now he's hurt and that fucking sucks.  Unlike Ingram, who we kinda are accepting isn't going to be anything near Kevin Durant (lol).    "
"I don't know what you're talking about, Kevin Durant is so old he played for the Seattle SuperSonics"
Kevin Durant because he can't do it without help from other superpowers.  
"Kevin ""Usopp"" Durant."
The opportunity to sign Kevin Durant is worth more 
"&gt;I don't see what the foul has to do with this discussion. Of course the rules won't penalize you for something out of your control like getting fouled, and a fouled attempt shouldn't count against you because you have no fair chance to make it.  The point is you can make rules to describe what counts as an attempt.   &gt;I have no idea what point this makes. A player can heave a 3pt shot outside of their natural shooting motion if they have very little time left on the clock. Are you saying that shouldn't count? That's what it sounds like.  It means when we discuss players, we want to discuss their actual shooting numbers. If one player chucks it twice a game, they are going to have a worse percentage than someone who doesn't, even if the first player is a better shooter. That's why teams have requested the NBA change the rules.  &gt;And why is it so obvious? Do you have any evidence of these players admitting or data to support that players would rather not take that shot?  Sure, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/sports/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html). It's pretty extensively discussed.   &gt;Because logically any player in the world will take that shot if it's going to matter. Down 10 going into the first? Yeah probably not going to heave just yet. Down 2 going into the 4th? Maybe. Tied with 1.2 left on the clock? Not a player in the world except JR smith is going to hold the ball in that scenario.  Right. So the idea is you change the rules so players always take them. "

How do you known the scheme was the same in those years? Billy Donovan wasn’t even the coach then and they had this guy called Kevin Durant.

"I honestly do not understand the Warriors hate.  They literally only have **2** All Stars on the team, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.  All this talk about 5 All Stars is overblown.  Klay is not going to make the All-Star team.  Draymond Green is not going to make the All-Star team.  DeMarcus Cousins is not going to make the All-Star team. "
"there was a point where the Thunder had Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka and Reggie Jackson. that's 3 MVP level players, a fringe all-star and a PG with the talent to contended for 6MOY if that was his role, all on one team. so yeah i'm sure we will see 4 all-stars on a team again in the future. but the Warriors are better than 4 all-stars, Steph and KD will at the very least be recognized as top 15 players of all-time when they hang it up, Klay Thompson will be recognized as one of the greatest shoooters ever and Draymond Green will be recognized as one of the greatest swiss army knife type of guys..   you can have a team with 4 all-stars quite easily but that's not saying much.   I doubt we see a team with the Warriors level of talent ever again. it seems like it was in our destiny to see a dominant team but the Thunder fucked that up when they stole the Sonics from Seattle and gave themselves all that bad karma.."
"Obvious bias but I'm drafting Giannis in front of anybody. After him I would think Steph Curry, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, maybe in some order of those players."
"Yes, actually, but I don't see what that has to do with it.  A player I really liked on my team fucked around with *restricted* free agency because he wanted ""more minutes"" for a shot at more money, got out of free agency via slightly dubious process and is now getting *fewer* minutes on a *different* team where the fans are acting shocked he doesn't suck.  What part of that am I supposed to be happy about?  Why would it be ""okay"" for me to be bitter about Kevin Durant leaving? If he leaves he's leaving as an unrestricted free agent, which means he has *every* right to go, with NO contractual obligation to Golden State.  I've spent two and a half years rolling my eyes at OKC fans for being bitter that he left them as an unrestricted FA, I'd be a massive hypocrite for having a problem with him leaving Golden State the same way.  I have only love for any past Warrior who left the team as unrestricted free agents, or for that matter as RFAs to teams where they actually played out the contract they left us on.  I fucking hate Chris Webber. I am unhappy about Patrick McCaw because I *really liked him* and this has played out *very badly* for him, AND been less than optimal for the Warriors. I don't hate him, at all, I sincerely want him to be happy, but he's not getting minutes, I doubt the Raptors are putting any real effort into developing him, and his new team's fans don't even appreciate him. Every part of this sucks."
The Raptors have both Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet. And used to have Jared Sullinger.   If anything it's gonna be DNP - not thicc enough....guess this also means Raps are never signing Kevin Durant.
  I'm getting downvoted but if these are the locks:  * James Harden * Steph Curry * Kevin Durant * Anthony Davis * Paul George * Nikola Jokic * LeBron James * Damian Lillard  You need to pick 4 of these guys to fill out the all star roster  * Rudy Gobert * Karl-Anthony Towns * Russell Westbrook * LaMarcus Aldridge * Mike Conley * Jrue Holiday * Luka Doncic * Danilo Gallinari * Tobias Harris * DeMar DeRozan * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Klay Thompson

Yeah but they would need to hire Kevin Durant as the team’s social media person to keep things interesting 
1. Coming from a Lakers fan.  2. Did you see what Kevin Durant said about LeBron and do you agree with it?
"What? It gives teams a competitive advantage. If Kevin Durant and Steph Curry both had asked to be maxed at the same time, Golden State would have had a tough decision to make but they didn't and now the West (and potentially the league) are a wash for Golden State again."
The Warriors dominance was aided by a weak minded player in Kevin Durant who took the easy way out. I can’t support that.  I liked the Warriors pre Durant. A home grown team who were incredible. Durant’s legacy should always hold an asterisk.   
So essentially Kevin Durant...
Warriors’ Kevin Durant on his roster switch: “I was like a snake writhing in my basket with the whole world at my fingertips. I was going to try something really weak I’ve never tried before. The league let me do it.”
tfw you have to double Klay and you leave Kevin fucking Durant open. Smh
&gt;I have a bigger problem with guys like Kevin Durant and Tom Brady (and potentially Klay Thompson if he does so) taking pay cuts to make competitive teams more competitive so that other free agents can't possibly be on a competitive team without also taking pay cuts.  ...fucking why? How the hell does that inconvenience you? 
Or Kevin Durant/ Stephen Curry/ Klay Thompson or Dray but his ego is bigger than all those guys combined for some strange reason.
my Dad thinks Kevin Durant has a “Russian” look   WHAT

"I don't hate Lebron. I'm just consistent. You leapfrogged him over all these other great players without any real reasons. Why do I have to hate Lebron if I think other players have accomplished more and won more without anywhere near the same amount of drama and trying to build their own super team? All I'm saying if you're going to say Lebron is that great, you have to be willing to say that Kevin Durant is basically around that level for exactly the same reason.   Steph influenced the current NBA. Better shooter across the board. Never ""built"" his own team. Developed with other players that were mostly drafted by the organization. Was enough of a leader to not cause others to want to leave and got KD to play with him because he was a low-drama guy. Same amount of championships, will probably win at least 1 or 2 more. Best shooter of all time. Doesn't revert to bad plays at the end of games because he has a 50% FT% at the end of games (which is a metric that has been with Lebron his whole career). Lebron handles the ball the whole game, but decreases his team's overall assists numbers. Usually never moves off ball, so makes his teammates play 4-5 while he rests.   The dude is not a bad player. Carmelo Anthony is still a HoF. Lebron is just overrated, and he gets in the way of his own success. He could have been the GOAT if he just played team basketball and let himself actually play in a system. Lebron is easily top 5 in talent (Wilt and Shaq are the only ones that might have had more talent).  The amount of mental hurdles to make Lebron better than all these all-time greats is just disrespectful. He's easily top 20. Top 10? You gotta really stretch to put him comfortably within 7."
"Fine. Take out Oscar. That would still make Lebron 11.  Kawhi was up 20 points against the Warriors in the last WCF before his injury. Elite defensive player also, multiple-time MVP finalist. Durant has destroyed Lebron in the Finals in 1 v 1 matchups. Durant's on a superteam? Well, so was Lebron. Boo hoo. Nobody took away his accomplishments from when he was in Miami. Again, the Spurs swept Lebron when he was on the Heat. He choked against Dallas. You can say the Rockets (that you seem to love so much) had a very competitive series against GSW. Is Harden way better than Lebron?  Can you ignore all of these things and say Lebron was the best ""post-season player"" for 7 years? You mean when he beat the Celtics with a sub-6 foot point guard? Or when he barely beat the Celtics without Hayward or Kyrie? Or when he barely beat the Pacers last year? Or when he made it to the ECF by destroying his competition by taking the franchise players from the Heat and the Raptors? Or when he destroyed the Heat by leaving and teaming up with a team that had multiple number 1 picks that turned into Kyrie and Kevin Love?  Steph Curry has a better legacy than Lebron. "
The brazilian kevin durant is back
I don't have a problem with Melo/Wiggins/Chandler Parsons taking the money and running with it then not living up to expectations (though Wiggins is not a closed book).   I have a bigger problem with guys like Kevin Durant and Tom Brady (and potentially Klay Thompson if he does so) taking pay cuts to make competitive teams more competitive so that other free agents can't possibly be on a competitive team without also taking pay cuts.
"Most of the NBA? No. It’d basically just be Harden and Giannis.  He’s currently averaging 26.4/12.6/6.0. Round that down to 26/12/5 and you get two Wilt seasons, a Kareem season, a Big O season and an Elgin Baylor season. Kareem’s was the most recent, in 1976, every other season was from 1961-1966. Giannis is currently at 63.1% TS, the most efficient of those seasons is Kareem’s 56.7%. He’s also shooting 64.5% from two while the next best season in that regard was Wilt’s 54%. Kareem also has the least minutes per game of any of those seasons, at 41.9. Giannis is doing it in 33 minutes.  If you take his per 100 numbers and round them down to 37/17/8, you get nothing (note: per possession stats weren’t available before 1973 so this only applies to seasons since then). Take out the assists and add a minimum of 1000 minutes played, you get one Shaq season and Joel Embiid this season. Again, he’s comfortably the most efficient of those three seasons. *Fun side fact, 2015 DeAndre Liggins actually meets this criteria with no minutes played restriction, which I find hilarious.*   Take out the rebounds and just go with 37/8 with 1000 minutes played, you get 25 other seasons. LeBron (7 fucking times) and Kevin Durant are the only two other non-guards to have achieved this. 2017 was prime time for this stat line apparently, with Westbrook, IT, Lillard and Harden all doing it that year. Giannis is fifth in TS% among these seasons, behind last year’s Steph Curry, unanimous MVP Steph Curry, 2013 MVP LeBron, and 2014 LeBron.  Basically, nobody has ever been as good at scoring, rebounding and passing all at the same time as LeBron is now."
"They saw an 18 year-old with the body of Kevin Durant. It's also been well publicized that Masai Ujiri had tried to trade into the draft the year before to get Giannis, but wasn't able to.   I think they knew that there was a high chance that Bruno wouldn't figure it out. The potential payoff on the chance that he did figure it out was just too high and too evident to ignore. "
lol give CP Karl Malone and he has multiple rings.  Imagine if he played with Kevin Durant for 17 years. Not only would they win mutiple championships but he would get EVEN more assists.
Kevin Durant  Draymond Green  Demarcus Cousins  Steph Curry

"THE GRIZZLIES JUST SIGNED KEVIN DURANT (well, in 2 years.)"
"Giannis yes, no question. But it's simply not true that Kawhi, KD, or PG have all been better. Kawhi, KD, and LeBron are all still on a level above Paul George and LeBron, like it or not, has the name power to beat out Kahi and KD with their stats as similar as they are   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=leonaka01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id3_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Paul+George&amp;player_id4_select=Paul+George&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=georgpa01&amp;idx=players"

Hancock's sisters - Kevin Durant
"&gt; Yeah they always give FMVP to the guy guarding him. Because besides Lebron, Lebron's defender is the most valuable person.  That would be credible if he actually always guarded the best player. But he doesnt. He didnt guard Dirk Nowitzki, he chose to guard Jason Terry and got raped. IF the series would have been longer he may have even won the FMVP lol.  Someone like Iguodala shouldnt have never been in the position of winning a FMVP. But thanks to Lebron, that was possible. Same with Kawhi in his 3rd year in the league averaging like 14 point per game in the RS.  In 2017 he tried to guard Kevin Durant. KD went for 35ppg. In 2018 he just told someone else to guard him and tried to make everyone believe that he played almost the entire series with a broken hand.  &gt; No, consistently defending whoever is causing your team trouble on defense makes Lebron a great defender.   Barely has done it.  &gt; Having the ability to defend all positions makes him a great defender.   He cant defend all positions. Noone can.  &gt; Being 1st team All-Defense shows he was a great defender. Being 2nd in DPOY voting TWICE show he was a great defender.  He was a good defender in his Miami years (when he defended people from his position). He stop caring about defence when he left Miami, and actually he has been a complete liability of defense in the last couple of seasons.  His prime as a defender was really really short. Thats is why is absurd comparing him with players like Kobe or Tim Duncan, let alone MJ. "
Well respect for that then but you are crazy to think Lacob isn’t going to pay Kevin Durant whatever the hell he wants. Especially as they move into a new arena that will bring in even more money.
"Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Kemba Walker, Kemba Walker, Damian Lillard and depending on who you ask even post injury D-Rose or Lebron.   Harden has fantastic feints but people that think he has 'great dribbles n' handles' are basically coming into the world of basketball with soccermom/ESPN commentary understanding of what a fucking dribble is."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Demarcus Cousins played 1 game together. "

Kevin Durant is a human being.
By Azura! By Azura! By Azura! It's Kevin Durant!
It's because smaller players are generally more agile.  It's loosely size related.  It's like you didn't read anything but the first paragraph.  Kevin Durant is 7 feet tall and he plays in small ball lineups.  Small ball is not only height.  It's about speed and agility of the players to create favorable offensive matchups with traditional bigs.  One way this is accomplished is by shifting forwards up one.  Another way this is accomplished is by playing stretch fours and fives.  Both of these are examples of small ball.
James Harden played like trash in the NBA Finals as well Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the real players.
"I think the plethora of incredible centers pushes him to 25ish. 60% of players in the top 10 are centers or players who played center for the majority of their career: Shaq, Wilt, Russel, Hakeem, Duncan and Kareem are all top 10.  IMO Stockton is the #3 PG of all time behind Magic and Oscar, I think Steph may have passed Stockton already though, so he's 3rd or 4th. Then Isiah Thomas is debatable. Top 14 is pretty unanimous (MJ, LBJ, KAJ, Wilt, Magic, Bird, Duncan, Shaq, Hakeem, Russel, Kobe, Oscar and Jerry West). Then 14-20 Is debatable but I think most would agree Karl Malone, Dirk, Kevin Garnett, Dr. J, Charles Barkley, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Moses Malone were better than Stockton"

Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram
Like what Kevin Durant is gonna do this year? 
triple doubles are a stupid gimmick facilitated by an increased pace. kevin durant is already top 5 at his position all time. the only thing russ is better at is running down the court.
"ESPN: DeMarcus Cousins despises ""fake love"" of Warriors teammates, does not know who Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are, plans to join LeBron on Lakers with Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving"
"Definitely overblown. Refs always miss calls no matter what, no one is perfect, it is just this sub and media are doing extra work as of late to highlight literally every bad/missed call.  Was the Kevin Durant call where he was out of bounds, completely awful? Absolutely. I kinda want them to institute a rule where someone (like in NY or wherever the replay center is) can overrule a floor call so long as it is within 5 seconds, or within 10 seconds of a time out or something if it is really obvious and they can determine it very quickly."
Kevin Durant on another team  Or  DeMar Derozan
"So Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and JJ Reddick are the mist consistent scorers in the NBA? "

"And then Greg Oden will come back with his knees rebuilt and his legs made the same length, having in his recovery reached his potential, and Josh Smith will look like his 2008 self but having learned shot selection, with Roberson shooting 40% from 3.  The lineup of Fultz-IT-Roberson-JSmoove-Oden shock the NBA, coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals, sparked by a game 5 20 point comeback as Kevin Durant writes ""My Next Chapter 2: The Backdown"" before the Diamond Dogs beat the Celtics - who LeBron traded himself to mid-season for shits and giggles (and a second round pick) - in 5 games thanks to lockdown defense played by Roberson, creating a new debate as to whether the Cavs should have taken Darko at this rate.  And as Coach Bill Walton and Assistant Sam Bowie hold up the Larry O'Brien trophy, the entire NBA looks on with bewilderment as Reggie Miller mumbles seven words that will ring throughout time:  ""They played us like a damn fiddle"""
"Everybody knows that Lebron, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis are all better than him that's 5 right there."
Picking Sam Bowie instead of Michael fucking Jordan. Close second would be picking Greg Oden instead of Kevin Durant.
"What are you even trying to say here??  People automatically assume the 2016 Warriors are a superteam that's why they say ""Kevin Durant joined a superteam"". Are you arguing that the 2016 Warriors aren't a superteam? So LeBron and Durant both created superteams instead.  I don't think you're very smart."
Kevin Durant. Hated when he was on OKC. Loved that he moved to the Warriors.
"IM NOT ARGUING FOR KEVIN DURANT. How many times do I have to say this? I'm talking about LeBron, specifically said don't bring up Durant, yet people STILL bring him up. "
&gt; I am so scared that people in the future may think that Kevin Durant was a great basketball player  you people astound me 😂
Kevin Durant would end his career with 6 rings
"&gt;George is the Thunder's go-to stopper against most of the best scorers in the West. Per Second Spectrum, George has been matched up against Kevin Durant, James Harden and LeBron James more than three times as much as any of his teammates since joining the franchise last season. Any team hoping to emerge from the West better have a means to slow down those guys. George is the means for OKC.  &gt;Despite handling many of the toughest defensive assignments in the league, George's individual numbers remain impressive. Of the 45 players who have defended at least 500 shots this season, George ranks eighth in the league by holding shooters to 0.98 points per shot. The seven dudes in front of him are all big men, meaning George is arguably the most effective shot-defending wing in the NBA."
Here's the source for that  http://www.knbr.com/2016/12/13/kevin-durant-reveals-true-height-on-knbr-interview-with-fitz/
"Golden state were 4th in the league in payroll and were 24M over the cap.  Kevin Durant wanted 27M  Guess what they did? They made it work.  GSW didn’t have the money of offer him 27M but they *REALLY* wanted him so they managed to pay him.  If they really wanted to pay him the max they could’ve, they just would’ve paid a shit ton in luxury"
"The point of the commercial, is that you don't need kevin durant to clean your cieling, if you have a swiffer. Not having KD use the swiffer."
You think Clyde Drexler is better than Kevin Durant?
That was 6’9 Kevin Durant with the high five 
"Well, you're not Kevin Durant."
"They needed him. Good strategic addition to the club, and on the heels of adding Kevin Durant to a 73-win team? Thee guys might be in decent enough shape now. Totally not a collection of cowards. "
"He was also like.... ""What... Kevin Durant plays for the warriors"""
They should just give teams like 2 reviews a game or something some of these calls are so wAck. That Kevin Durant one against Rockets was a joke
"It’s not just AD it applies too.  It applies to Lebron both times he left Cleveland, Dwight Howard with Orlando, Kevin Durant, Paul George, and Chris Paul with NO.  As for Kawhi we still have no idea why he left.  It could have been because SA is a small market or it could be because he feels like the Spurs betrayed them, or it could be because he thinks the Spurs are trending downward and Pop is about to retire."
"I hope Brooklyn someone gets Ingram Lonzo and Kuzma from us.  They'd turn into Chris Paul, Kevin Durant and Rasheed Wallace"
https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2017/09/26/kevin-durant-on-steph-curry-hes-our-leader/
Most ironic part is it’s called the Kevin Durant rule. 
"No one cares that Kevin Durant left OKC, they care because he went to a team that beat him the year before and had 73 wins. Believe it or not there’s some nuance to it.  It’s possible to respect and even encourage players’ right to move around and still be annoyed that a player went to a team that seriously disrupted competitive balance in the NBA. It’s not complicated."
"why do people act like only teams are unloyal?  LeBron ditched Cleveland without even letting them know, Kevin Durant ditched OKC and didn't even let his teammates know, Deandre Jordan gave the Mavs a verbal agreement then went back on his word, Derek Fisher used his daughter's illness to get out from the Jazz and sign with LA, Boozer snaked the Cavs, etc"
"If you are so attached to that stat, you best believe Andre Drummond is the best defensive player in the league the past 2 years.  Andrew Bogut was robbed of a couple all defense votes.  Should not be clowning Kevin Durant when he said the only reason people didn't vote him DPOY is because of ""pure hate""  Hassan Whiteside is practically Rudy Gobert."
"A source close to the Warriors confirmed that Kevin Durant is genuinely interested in reuniting with his former Thunder teammate. “That is for real,” the source said.   It would be something else to see KD and Kanter playing together."
What does Kevin Durant have to do with this?
"Yeah, I talked to a guy the other day who seriously thought Adam Silver should have vetoed Kevin Durant and Boogie's contracts with the warriors cus ""muh parity.""  There are definitely salty fucks here that want the league to have the power to fuck with free-agent contracts and stuff."
*Kevin Durant has left the chat*
"I feel like KD was the Anakin Skywalker.  He was the chosen one, the one who was supposed to (on the Thunder) bring balance to the West by overthrowing GSW. Instead he joined them, creating the evil empire.  This would make any potential Lakers super team challenger more like the rebels. With LeBron being Obi Wan, who defied Chancellor palpatine as long as he could (Cleveland time), AD would be like Princess Leia, the key piece to the rebel alliance, immensely talented &amp; widely regarded as such.   Which would make Kyrie Luke Skywalker, raised in a desolate place (pre-LeBron 2.0 Cleveland) and always has his eyes on greatness.  Mentored by an old Obi Wan (LeBron 2.0), he is now recruited to join the rebel alliance, and fulfill his destiny to defeat the evil empire.   All this means is that this saga only ends one way.  Kevin Durant joins the Lakers this offseason too and helps the rebels defeat Chancellor Palpatine (Kerr). "
Kevin Durant won it with other all stars with ease. 
Kevin Durant is the best player it’s an indictment on him he couldn’t win with Westbrook and Harden 
the super-max was not a thing until after KD joined the Warriors.  &amp;#x200B;  the super-max is refered to as the Kevin Durant rule.
"Writer who writes for a newspaper != all fans.    That being said, it's Durant's fault for basically throwing gasoline on a fire after he left.  From burner accounts, to trashing Russ, to trashing the organization to trashing Billy Donovan etc...    OKC fans want no part of Kevin Durant.  He's a great basketball player who was a great figure for OKC when he was here, but he's an immature douche.   "
Kevin Durant loves this. 
Y'all were close because you had this guy named Kevin Durant
"**Kevin Durant:** KD's Journal. October 12th, 2020. Dog carcass in locker room this morning. Tire tread on burst stomach. This league's afraid of me. I've seen its true face. The internets are extended gutters, and social media is full of blood, and when the drains finally scab over all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their shitposting and memeing will foam up about their waists and all the media personalities and fans will look up and shout ""Save us!"" and I'll whisper ""No."""
"~~Paul George~~, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler...."
"Reminder: If the Lakers don't get Anthony Davis then they still have a shot at Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, and Jimmy Butler. This is after getting LeBron to commit to a 3+1 year deal. Market bias totally sucks for any fan that doesn't live in California. "
"Russell is a great player, but his acheivements are masked by the fact he has 0 rings.   Someone who has Kevin Durant, James Harden two of the top 5 players in the league and not getting a chip. Disappointing.  https://youtu.be/XU23Fz1T7JY  This video really explains it well"
"Russell is a great player, but his acheivements are masked by the fact he has 0 rings.   Someone who has Kevin Durant, James Harden two of the top 5 players in the league and not getting a chip. Disappointing."
"This is the problem with looking at flat numbers. Kevin Durant has the ball in his hands way longer in half court offense - big reason for his assist numbers being greater - and uses extra possessions to draw fouls, which obviously don't count as field goal attempts. "
"Why the fuck would trade away Harden for anyone not named Lebron James, Kevin Durant, or Stephen Curry?"
While this idea makes sense.. I think it'll ruin the flow and pace of the game.   Imagine Kevin Durant and GS in this rule. Imagine him on a fastbreak pull up 3 but stopping because they had already 5 3pointers in the first quarter and they are still down vs some top tier teams. KD (or some other player) will probably be instructed by the coach or think by themselves to not shoot that many 3s that early in case they are still down later in the game.  
i.e. Kevin Durant. 
"That’s one player. Russ, PG, Adams? KD even told PG13 that he would love OKC. Really stretching there  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/paul-george-kevin-durant-call-oklahoma-city-thunder-trade-2017-7"
Harrison Barnes had a better fit/chemistry with the rest of the core? No. HB was good in his time here but he didn't fit better than Kevin Durant. 
"and just another guy taking the hardest road, Kevin Durant. "
"If I’m the Warriors, I’m offering Draymond Green and Kevin Durant for shits and giggles."
"Yes, it was already reported (by Marc Stein I think) that the Warriors would be willing to sign and trade Kevin Durant if he wants out. "
And that’s literally what happened in the 3rd lmao. Fuck Kevin Durant.
Kyle Lowry &gt; Kevin Durant  yea baby
Or maybe because he's fucking Kevin Durant and he should keep shooting? Lol 
"Yes, it's worth it to trade anyone for AD, but trading for AD wouldn't be enough to beat the Golden State Warriors this year. They lack one weak spot and they addressed it in a tough inside offensive presence with DeMarcus Cousins. All five of them can play any style and be very successful at it, unlike some players needing volume touches and shots.  People will talk about the era and make excuses they can't compare the teams, but this Golden State Warriors can beat any team in any era when all healthy. The only way to beat these guys is addition by subtraction.   The one unintended consequence of all these superstar movements from the last collective bargaining agreement is Kevin Durant went to GS and DC followed. LeBron spearheaded the player union and the media wanted him in big market like LA. The league is not competitive at all. No one can beat GS and Durant isn't going anywhere with all the cash coming in from the new building in SF. "
Patty Mills &gt; Kevin Durant
"It’s not punishing. I never said punishing. It’s called blocking it from happening. Players should have set values of their worth and shouldn’t be allowed to sign for certain amounts less. This would have blocked KD and DMC from joining them which would have been fair. They won 73 games without those two.   By your logic and the NBAs logic, if I buy a team and convince james harden, Kevin Durant, Westbrook, Paul George and Joel Embiid to come play for me and all take less than they’re worth, that’s fine right? Well according to the nba it is, and it’s wrong. It shouldn’t be fine. It should be blocked. "
Because Kevin Durant mentioned Trump shutting down the government.
"I mean having 2 star players die on you is pretty unlucky (Bias and Lewis).   Having one of the only big free agents your team has ever signed break his ankle 5 minutes into his contract and look like he might not ever be the same in the half season he has been back yet is pretty unlucky   Having the best odds to get both Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant but not get either is pretty unlucky.   Never selecting first overall (and the one time you get it, the #1 prospect forgot how to shoot so you trade down) over the period of 30 years without being super successful is pretty unlucky."
Slim Reaper shuts down the government. https://deadspin.com/kevin-durant-as-the-slim-reaper-is-terrifying-1507548433
Kevin Durant is a shithead. 
"He said Tatum could be Kevin Durant.......so, yeah."
"Yeah , man, I work at the restaurant around the corner from LeBrons house, and all of the Lakers staff visit his home at least once a month. I always hear conversations about them wanting Kevin Durant, James Harden, Gianis, and all these great players. They even mentions wishing they had Michael Jordan on their team. Such pricks. "
"&gt; Also, the Supersonics with KEVIN DURANT and RUSSELL WESTBROOK couldn't sell enough tickets to sustain a market in Seattle; how do you think that would go now that the team they'd be getting has no player or prospect on the level of either??  There are so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.  First off, Westbrook never played in Seattle and Durant only played his rookie season.  The move from Seattle to OKC had nothing to do with ticket sales.  An Oklahoma City businessman bought the team with the intention of moving the team to his hometown even though he agreed to a ""good faith"" effort to keep the team in Seattle as part of the sale.  His ""effort"" consisted of demanding a fully taxpayer-funded stadium in a suburb nowhere near downtown, and then illegally demanding that the city let him out of his current lease with the downtown arena to move the team.  "
"&gt; Also, the SuperSonics with KEVIN DURANT and RUSSELL WESTBROOK  🤔"
"Yeah I mean, I don't really agree with the point the guy is trying to make. Theres no reason a team should inherently owe the 15th man a roster spot. And nobody is expecting loyalty from the 15th man, theyre there to get their money and get better as a player. If a team gives them a better oppurtunity, they should take it.  That being said, it is really silly to expect loyalty from stars, because the reality is that unless you're better than everyone else you can be traded for, the team would trade you. Just because the Thunder don't get rid of Kevin fucking Durant, doesn't mean they're expressing their loyalty for him. They *need* him, and so does everybody else.  "
"Something I have noticed after having the chance to be ""involved"" in tech and the investment side of things is that a lot of reputable investment firms rather not have celebs on their funds. Too much risk if they screw up(because they live public lives). Rich people don't care how famous you are for the most part.   But living in silicon valley and playing for the Bay's team does actually help him because he's now ""one of us"". There are some doors that wouldn't open even for Kevin Durant which is crazy. "
This is what I don’t understand. Yes there is slave trade in Libya... yes Trump is president... do we not watch sports to forget about these things? Kevin Durant is pretty much saying why would you care about basketball with everything going on in the world? Maybe because basketball is one of the few bright spots. Lebron understands this... Kd and Kyrie not so much 
Well he is going to GSW and be the 3rd banana  to Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  Can any team do better than Klay **and** Dray?  
“It would be a pathetic move if he joined Lebron.  Talk about an unstoppable superteam.”  -Kevin Durant

"Westbrook had Kevin Durant on his team, and you want to bring up CP3 lol, you're kidding right?  Russ wasn't even the best player on those teams.  KD was.  He has never been anywhere beyond the 1st round as the best player on his team."
"Totally agree.  He is doing New Orleans a solid, PG gave the Pacers a life raft when he informed them he wanted to be traded.  Kevin Durant? AKA the snake? Naw, he led OKC along bolted for the team that just beat him in the WCF and left OKC with nothing for a future hall of famer."

Kevin Durant gave up $10m to help the Warriors. These short 1+1 deals also make things work. Take a $3m discount for a year and resign.
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Popovich Durant
The most Kevin Durant quote ever. 
Found Kevin Durant
-Kevin Durant
I mean Kevin Durant joined a team that blew a 3-1 Finals lead and immediately had one of the most dominant postseason runs we have seen since Shaq and Kobe called it quits. The following year KD and the Warriors did the exact same thing that is impressive I don't care who you are. 
And Durant too. 'You can't sign Kevin Durant in free agency after you win 70 games.' 
That's not the point. The point I was making was AD will recieve backlash for his decision to leave New Orleans instead of sticking it out and two best people he could talk to about what to expect and dealing with that negativity are Lebron James and Kevin Durant. 
"Well... first there was The Decision and the formation of the Heatles. Then he came back to Cleveland and got Kevin Love to be traded for Wiggins instantly. It's mostly the free-agency influence they've had on the league. He and LeBron have been moving around from team to team, running the show, and influencing other big FA guys to do the same. See Kevin Durant signing with GS, Paul George demanding a trade, Kawhi demanding a trade, now AD. Superstars are trying to determine their own destiny the way LeBron and Rich have shown. They created the blueprint."
"Kevin Durant once told me my circumcision ring is an eternal symbol of our love for each other and I said that it may as well be because I have like 10% sensitivity down there now and then Kevin smiled and said 'I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer. Christmas is coming a few days early this year ya little jackass, and handed me a little box wrapped up in a beautiful silver paper with a velvety red bow and I opened and sitting right there waiting for me was my foreskin. christmas is magical  "
I'd trade my Kevin Durant reddit account for AD.
"You're right. It's a business, on both sides theirs no loyalty. Look at blake griffin.  I always thought players have the right to not be loyal, but I would lose most of my respect for them if they hopped on a championship team like kevin Durant.   Boogie cousins is an exception, because apparently nobody wanted him. "
[Remember what Jarrett Jack said in November](https://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2018/11/16/18098134/nba-free-agency-rumors-jarrett-jack-anthony-davis-kevin-durant-lebron-james-lakers-twitter-tweet): he's going to LAL. With KD. Hmm.
"I think it's a complete 180. Anthony Davis is at least trying to give something back to the pelicans before he leaves Whether that's draft picks or rising talent.    I'm sure new Orleans fans would be salty, but they wouldnt go to the Same level of kevin Durant/lebron James hate."
"Not in front of the trade machine, but Knox/Mitch Robinson/1st plus some cap filler might be interesting to New Orleans  Then you roll out AD, Kristaps, and hopefully free agent superstar x (Kevin Durant 🤞) and someone's really cooking pasta then"
This is why you have to respect the Warriors. Draymond at least waited until they lost game 7 to start crying in the parking lot and begging Kevin Durant to come to the Warriors. 
"Lmao Kevin Durant was on a competitive team. He was up 3-1 against the Warriors, he shoulda been in the finals. But nope he decided to join a 73-9 team that beat him. Completely fucking different than Anthony Davis’ situation but nice try."
"Because your opinion of these events and why people hate him is not universal. For some people, it IS about leaving OKC and/or it IS about joining superstars.  Meanwhile, some people are of the opinion that Kevin Durant was, in fact, and *unrestricted free agent* and having played out his contract with Oklahoma, he was in fact entirely at liberty to do *whatever the fuck he wanted*.  I didn't want him to join Golden State. I thought we'd get less of Superstar Skyfucker Curry (and we did), that people would hate endlessly and talk shit about the Warriors (and they do) and it would be less exciting than 2014-16 was (and it has, although last season would probably have been more fun if the Warriors weren't fucked non-stop by injuries).  However: It was his right to go to any team he wanted that would have him, and he did, and while I've always liked him he is now a Warrior and I love all Warriors past and present not named Chris Webber so yay KD.  What I really, truly don't get is the hate from fans of teams who didn't have a shot at a title whether the Warriors got KD or not. If you're a Cavs or Rockets fan? Yeah, KD joining the Warriors may well have cost your team a ring.  Anyone else?  Nah.  Including OKC, because: he played his heart out for you for years and in all that time the Thunder couldn't fix the most *glaringly obvious* problems like maybe hiring a coach that *didn't suck*. They kept Brooks way too long then hired a feeble weeble who can't control the players, at all.  KD did his best for Oklahoma, but he really truly couldn't win with those cats. He didn't demand a trade or do anything else to fuck them over - he played out his contract, he did his absolute best, and then he left as an unrestricted free agent, which he had **every right to do**."
"I think people forget how hated that heat team was , the GSW and Kevin Durant hate is nothing compared to the hate that team got. But most of it stemmed from that stupid conference the heat team did with the “not 1, not 2 , not 3.....” ."
"I hope one day we get a realistic enough simulation that allows us to set up a season any way we want with any players from history and watch an 82 game season in graphics indiscernible from real life. I'd cream my pants to the highlights from a...  - LeBron James - Dwyane Wade - Michael Jordan - Blake Griffin - DeAndre Jordan   line up.. the highlights, especially transition would be ridiculous.   i'd also make this a team  - Ben Simmons - Kevin Durant  - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Anthony Davis - Rudy Gobert  just for the crazy height and wingspan.  then this lineup for the shooting  - Steve Nash - Stephen Curry - Klay Thompson - Larry Bird - Dirk Nowitzki  the defense would be shit but they'd be shooting the shit out of the ball."
"That’s a fair statement. Players who are able to play multiple positions automatically get a leg up on the competition. But then we’d have to ask, how much better is lebron than Magic? Lebron is more athletic sure; Does Magic have more court vision and IQ? Probably.   That being said, I’d still argue that if someone took Lebron off the board, you’d still be pretty happy to choose between Scottie, Dr J, Elgin Baylor, Dominique, KEVIN DURANT at the SF position.   Lmao I should mention this idea stems from economics. Comparative advantage and opportunity cost. These are better measures of value IMO than raw stats. However, a 30 team draft would make this analysis incredibly complicated. Easily, the top 5 players at every position would be scooped by pick 25"

"Hey, the last team Harrison Barnes screwed over signed Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant for sure. Dude just made the best move for himself, basketball wise. The Warriors had the cap room because of the increasing salary cap. If you want to blame anyone for that move, blame the player's union for saying the cap increase should come all at once instead of over a few years."
"A poor 7 footer vs a rich NBA kid who has a higher chance of making it to the NBA?  A poor generational athlete vs a rich NBA kid who has a higher chance of making it to the NBA?  Compared to guys like LeBron or Kevin Durant, Curry is absolutely an underdog."

&gt; Kevin Durant is planning return to OKC  That’s called the ol’ Lebron-a-roo.
"[Royce Young - The changes that led to Kevin Durant's OKC departure](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/16791990/nba-changes-led-kevin-durant-departure-oklahoma-city-thunder)   The funny thing is that Nick Collison, along with Russ actually tried to convince KD to stay with OKC over dinner. Here's an excerpt from an article:      ""Fellow ""founding fathers"" Russell Westbrook and Nick Collison had met with Durant prior to that, having dinner with him. They tried to reinforce how important staying together is, how they are on the verge of something truly special. Westbrook largely led the charge.  The Thunder had hoped they could sway Durant to drop his planned meetings in the Hamptons and agree long term on the spot. They came armed with the idea of chasing big man Al Horford, believing if Durant would commit, they could be on the phone with Horford and his agent at midnight to start lining up a deal. Presti knew the Thunder weren't landing Horford without Durant standing by his side; and he feared the opposite. Durant was unwilling."""
"&gt;""It's about time for us to let go of all that extra stuff, and just come together""  That's awfully easy to say when you're Kevin Durant."
"Exactly. I think once the Heatles showed signs of mortality by losing to Dallas that first year, people cooled off quite a bit. The Big 3 in Miami were overwhelming favorites sure, but there was a sense they were beatable no matter how good they were playing. Durant going to GSW really ruined parity in a lot of people’s eyes, both fans and players. Also, the way Kevin Durant has acted since leaving doesn’t help, dude is sensitive and petty as hell, LeBron has always been above that to an extent."
7 is completely reasonable   LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Steph Curry  James Harden  Kawhi Leonard   Giannis Antetokounmpo   They’re all able to lead a team to victory better than AD
"Were I to seriously try and analyze that lineup, the talent level is greater than the Warriors starting 5 but the fit isn't great. Every single one of the guys in that lineup works best ball-dominant. Kyrie and Kawhi are really the only + shooters there. You don't want Simmons or Giannis shooting at all.  As opposed to the Warriors with the 2 greatest shooters of all time, Kevin Durant, a shooting 5 who can also post-up, and one of the best defensive players ever who can playmake. Again, the sheer talent level doesn't match up, but the Warriors fit is just insanely good."
"He can join the Kevin Durant recruitment squad of Royal Ivey, Lance Thomas, Allonzo Trier, DeAndre Jordan.."
"[Oh, cmon! At least when he wins titles he has some inspirational quotes](https://pics.me.me/hissss-hiss-hisssssss-ghettogronk-kevin-durant-on-winning-his-first-22775973.png) "
Kevin Durant on the Thunder? Although he did make it to a finals
I disagree the addition of Kevin Durant changed everything. Even with Cousins the Warriors probably dispatch New Orleans within 6 games.
"Again, most pro athletes do not have a 7'5 wingspan.

Ford, Luke Ridnour."
Davis isnt leaving because the Pelicans could never bring in a second or third banana. Hes leaving because their 4th-9th best guys on their roster were amongst the worst of any team in the entire nba. They struggled dearly to build even a serviceable bench. Just look at some of the small forwards the pels have had their in Davis’ time in nola. Who is the best small forward who’s ever played with Anthony Davis on the Pelicans? Solomon Hill? Tyreke Evans? Luke Babbit? Darius Miller? None of those guys are starter level guys in their time with New Orleans. You’re going against Kevin Durant (in OKC and GS) and Kawhi Leonard (when he was a spur) in the Western conference and that’s who you’ve got? Not even Harrison Barnes. Not Chandler Parsons. But motherfucking Luke Babbit. That’s why Davis is leaving
This is why I refer to the 70% on $10MM idea as the “Fuck Kevin Durant bill”
Wait wait wait there's a Kevin Durant board game?
"My god. 74m is only needed for durant and Kyrie.   Lance Thomas, frank, DSJ, and Knox trier would be enough salary matching for Davis. Still leaves you enough for the other 2.  Kevin Knox was just named rookie of the month lol   They have a top 5 pick incoming.   Rj Barrett is a consensus #1 any other year.  They just need a top 2. Honestly I'd take 5 years of rj over 3 of Tatum "
"Their priority is still to trade him. They either wait for him to leave in free agency, which he will inevitably do, or they trade him at the end of the season and get back something for him. Regardless if they make the playoffs or not, they are probably not going to get a chip anytime soon and every franchise wants to avoid a Kevin Durant scenario where their star walks for nothing"
Brandon ingram has a way higher ceiling than jayson tatum and will be the next kevin durant
"When you have a Kevin Durant, isos work. KD can pretty much get a bucket against anyone in the NBA.  Problem is what happens when you don't have a Kevin Durant or even a Russell Westbrook"

Next headline on ESPN ‘Trouble brewing in warriors locker room after Kevin Durant insults Curry’s legacy’
Is this a joke... Did he really had to made an apology video to Kevin Durant HaHaHa   &amp;#x200B;
"yeah i wonder why that is. not because curry plays with kevin durant, klay thompson and demarcus cousins."
Vince Carter and the Raptors  Kevin Durant and OKC  LeBron James and the Cavs 
"For 'who's having the ball in his hands the longest' only, Fansided or their stat guys actually have that collected. The most recent one is for the 2015-16 season. Westbrook was 4th league wide with 23.4%. LeBron James had 14.2%. Kevin Durant 9.5%. Obviously, no stat for Michael Jordan.  https://fansided.com/stats/true-usage/"
"Yeah they had issues for a bit, I honestly don't think KD forgave him. KD don't forgive that type of thing.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-suspended-draymond-green-for-daring-kevin-durant-to-leave-in-free-agency-report-says/amp/"
The main thing Kevin Durant did wrong with joining the warriors is take a pay cut. That’s the weakest part of it. He is a top playing he knows he should get a top contract.
Kevin Durant is extremely overrated. He's not even a top 10 all-time small forward. Maybe on par with (or slightly better than) Alex English.
He was like a Kevin Durant.
ESPN: Kevin Durant“I just... do ... the Knicks”
KEVIN DURANT TO MILWAUKEEE u heard it here first 
"ESPN: Kevin Durant: ""Knicks"""
"Kevin ""Donald Trump"" Durant"
"I would know, we have had sexual relations. And I'll let you guess who the bottom is, or should I say power bottom.  Source: I'm Kevin Durant, like duh, look at my username."
"&gt; ESPN: Kevin Durant: ""I.. Do.. the Knicks"".  Ftfy"
ESPN: Kevin Durant: “I have...the Knicks”
Kevin Durant is better then Larry Bird
&gt; Kevin Durant did nothing wrong in going to GSW. A good player wanting to play for a good team what a shock /s.  Agreed. He also got upgrade from living in OKC to living in San Francisco. Makes it even more of an obvious decision to go there.
"Kevin Durant never has been, and never will be, the best player on a championship team. Without Curry he wouldn't have ever won, even if his stats for his Finals MVP show better numbers it's largely because Curry is commanding so much gravity."
🤦‍♂️ The bidding? The highest the bidding can go is still less than what the Warriors can offer and they will 100% offer KD the 5 year supermax. You're an idiot if you think Kevin fucking Durant won't be offered that contract.
Was this article on NBC Sports written by a guy named Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant did nothing wrong in going to GSW. A good player wanting to play for a good team what a shock /s. ""Hurr durr they beat him and then he joined them"" shut up.   When the lot of you say 2011 Dallas Mavericks was the most meaningful title to you. You might was well just outright ask for upvotes.   New Orleans is going to get fleeced by either Boston, LAL,or LAC and I will enjoy the hell out of it.   My personal hope is that Kyrie leaves the Celtics and have to swallow his pride to join the Lakers and be Lebron's number 2 again.   I don't give a damn about the Knicks make Orlando Magic basketball Great Again. "

Kevin Durant is not currently a top 3 player
"Never once said anyone stopped Lebron buddy. You are putting words in my mouth. The point still remains despite your efforts. Lebron was scared of Kevin Durant and refused to guard him.   And we circle back to this lmao. I'm telling you, you Lebron fans have a mental illness. KD did exactly what Lebron did. But it's not Lebron and it hurts Lebron so therefore None of KDs rings count. If that's what you think then lebrons rings in Miami don't count. The fact that you idiots crucify KD so much when your father has done the same exact thing multiple times is just unreal to me and always has been unreal to me.   KD is already validated. Nobody has said that. Just blind   ass Lebron dick suckers who can't view anything without Lebron glasses on. I'm telling you something is wrong with you people.   Sit back and watch everything unfold and Kevin Durant will have more rings than Lebron James when it is all said and done. Can't wait to hear the excuses when that happens. "
"Because of the ability for an individual to impact the game greatly, usually teams with superstars are the top of the league. For example, Lebron James went from the Cavs to the Heat back to the Cavs, and each team he was on was one of the best in the east. It wasn't the Cavs or Heat that really did anything to change their position, it was mostly because talent moved around.   The Warriors happened to build and retain talent so they've been dominate for a while, but kevin Durant choosing to join them made them basically untouchable.   So I'd say it's much more dependent on the superstars and where they decide to go"
Yeah but if he ignored it Strauss would just keep posting articles about  “DaY 10 AnD KeViN dUrAnT sTiLl HaSn’T tAlKeD tO tHe MeDiA!!!”
They do look alike and I remember Kevin Durant in an interview said Jcole was one of the only celebrities that could seriously play ball
"Yeah but Tom Brady wouldn't say some dumb shit like this. LeBron thinks he is the GOAT, so does Brady. The difference is, Brady doesn't need to say it out loud for validation lol  Didn't Shaq just say last week ""if you gotta say you're the GOAT, you ain't the GOAT."" Case in point. LeBron is way too full of himself. Of course the east is loading up now, but you don't need to go and say it out loud  for self-validation.  This level of need for validation is so fucking lame for a multi-millionaire athlete imo. Kevin Durant suffers from the same narcissistic BS"
"Hey it's okay man. Your king got bitched by KD on the national stage. No need to bring age into like it has any affect on being able to determine who is very good at basketball. Have you ever watched Kevin Durant play basketball? There is no way there is 10 guys who have been better than Kevin Durant. And if you are one of those people who need to wait til his career is over to determine it, then so be it. If that's the case he will undoubtedly be a top 10 player ever when he's done. I just happen to have him there now because I have never seen 10 better. And neither have you. You are just a hater and a Lebron slurper and for whatever reason that makes you delusional. Maybe one day you'll grow up and see the light. Until then I pity you. "
"I don't agree that they did a poor job.  They're a small market club and they tried their best.   They brought in Jrue, and then gave him a max.  They took a swing on Cousins.  They tried bringing in younger complimentary guys like Mirotic and Randle.  What more do you want them to do?  Kevin Durant or Lebron James aren't signing with New Orleans.  And the team is never going to be bad enough to tank with Davis and Holiday - so they're not finding another superstar in the draft unless they get really lucky."
"&gt; The Warriors have to agree to take on Horfords contract which would be a hell of a lot of salary tax just for an added random first round pick or two which wouldn’t make sense.   Boston has much better assets they can add if they need to to get this done. We're talking about Kevin Durant here, they'd do it without thinking.  &gt; and the Celtics have showed their interest is for AD this offseason.   You think they lost interest in Kevin Durant since 2016? Lol, they're interested in AD because he's available. If KD is an option then he's going to be their priority.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"VORP thinks Rudy is the 5th most valuable player in the NBA this year. Do you agree?  It also thinks Russell Westbrook has been more valuable than Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, which almost no one would agree with. VORP is calculated using BPM. DBPM looooooooves rebounds, hence Westbrook having the 4th highest DBPM in the league this year. Russell Westbrook is not the 4th best defender in the league."
"Yeah, your right, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry play in the East. Sorry, I forgot. "
"Kevin Durant announces that he would have gone to New York if the media hadn't kept hassling him about it, but instead just to screw them over he's re-signing with the Warriors instead. "
"Kevin Durant would get maxed the year after even if he got injured. And, again, he guy has already made over $200 million in his career."
Kevin Durant. 
"Rudy ""not an all-star"" Gobert with a higher VORP than:  Joel Embiid  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Kyrie Irving  Lebron James  Paul George  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  Karl Anthony-Towns  Blake Griffin  Damian Lillard  Kemba Walker  Ben Simmons  Nikola Vucevic  Kyle Lowry  D'Angelo Russell  Blake Griffin  Dirk Nowitzki  Dwayne Wade  Khris Middleton  LaMarcus Aldridge   ""tHe NbA vALuEs DeFEnSE""  "
Kevin Durant makes 32 million next year if he opts in... let’s not act like it’s a huge difference to a guy that has made like 200 million+ in his career.  And Boston is the perfect spot for him to both improve his legacy and kill the narrative that he only wins because he joined a super team. Boston probably won’t even be in the finals this year.

"Lmao. Always the excuse for Lebron. It's like clockwork. He can do know wrong. He was blatantly scared of guarding Kevin Durant. Don't guard him for 3 quarters whatever. But if you are gonna back down in the fourth, then ur a bitch/scared. But yeah keep making excuses for your king. He can do no wrong. First time Lebron was ever bitched by another man on the basketball court. And yes KD Is his equal. He's 8-1 against Lebron the past two finals with two MVPs. I swear Lebron dick riders live in a different reality. "
Simmons talking out of his ass again. Since when is LeBron and Kevin Durant unhappy? 
God kevin durant is a beautiful player. Something is just so nice about a consistent midrange jumper thats wet.
I’d say it’s Kevin Durant at this point tbh  gotta add a fuck KD tho 
Kevin Loveand Kevin Durant
"Because it generates clicks, which generate revenue.  Sports writers will write anything that makes them money. Ask Kevin Durant."
Yeah no amount of effort is gonna make DLo better than Kevin Durant 
Does Lebron have burner accounts? If so I have twice as many  - Kevin Durant
Kevin durant doesn't have burner accounts.  \- Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is the best player in the world.  \- Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant
"I can not believe that someone would break up a core of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. smh"
"Team LeBron:      LeBron James (LAL), Kevin Durant (GSW), Kyrie Irving (BOS), Kawhi Leonard (TOR) and James Harden (HOU) as starters.   Anthony Davis (NOLA), Klay Thompson (GSW), Damian Lillard (POR), Ben Simmons (PHI), LaMarcus Aldridge (SAS), Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN), Bradley Beal (WAS) and Dwyane Wade (MIA) as reserves.      Team Giannis:      Giannis Antetokounmpo (MIL), Stephen Curry (GSW), Joel Embiid (PHI), Paul George (OKC) and Kemba Walker (CHA) as starters.   Khris Middleton (MIL), Nikola Jokic (DEN), Blake Griffin (DET), Russell Westbrook (OKC), D'Angelo Russell (BKN), Nikola Vucevic (ORL), Kyle Lowry (TOR) and Dirk Nowitzki (DAL).     "
"Kevin Durant, mmm"
1. Kevin Durant 2. James Harden 3. Steph Curry 4. Lebron James 5. Kyrie Irving 
"They are numbered 1-5, you do hear at the 1, 2, 3, all the numbers represent are positions starting from Point Guard to Center. So it goes  1 - Point Guard (PG) 2 - Shooting Guard (SG) 3 - Small Forward (SF) 4 - Power Forward (PF) 5 - Center (C)  Typically, as you go from 1 to 5 you get from shorter and faster to taller and slower players. The value of defense usually goes Center highest and PG lowest since the Center is the guy clogging the paint protecting the basket itself and rising to block shots. Next most involved in the paint is the PF, and so on  The Point Guard is usually the orchestrator of the offense and does the most ball-handling (every one of these roles comes with exceptions - for example, Jokic is the primary ballhandler on the Nuggets, and Simmons is tall but plays PG)  Point guards are your quick guards and shooters, Curry, Lillard, Walker, Kyrie, etc  Shooting guards are usually tasked with less ball-handling and more pure shooting, but a lot of players can play both 1 and 2, and they're often called Combo Guards. Typical examples of shooting guards are guys like CJ McCollum, Klay Thompson, Buddy Hield, Demar DeRozan  Small Forward is kind of the middle position and has recently become very valuable in the league. Guys that usually play SF are Kevin Durant, Lebron James (although he's played many different positions in his career), Rudy Gay  Power Forward is kind of like center but not quite there; you do expect some sort of lateral quickness at this position to be able to cover the opposing PF and switch on defense. Think guys like Chris Bosh, Paul Millsap, Draymond Green  Center is arguably the most important defensive position as they often cover for other defenders when they get beaten on the dribble. Centers are most easily recognizable since they're usually the tallest guy on the field - Gobert, Embiid, Gasol, Jokic, etc  There I hope the writeup was easy enough to understand, had some time to kill so why not, have fun"
"Hey Luka, do you also think Kevin Durant is a snake?"
"&gt; ""By the way, you’d think team play would be the natural focus of everyone right now...And yet, in a 39-point victory, Kevin Durant has amplified the story he theoretically wants smothered. ""  that's a good point. imagine if they got blown out."
"The University of Texas lacks depth in the backcourt, but could put together a pretty dominant frontcourt:   PG: Avery Bradley  SG: Cory Joseph  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Lemarcus Aldridge  C: Jarret Allen   Bench: Tristan Thompson, Mo Bamba, Myles Turner, PJ Tucker"
Lawrence Frank is the Kevin Durant of GMs. 
The dude signed a 1 year deal. What the fuck else did he expect? It comes with being a 1 year deal type of guy. It's crazy how Kevin Durant is the softest player in the league by far. Grow some balls handle your emotions and be a professional. Honestly KD should take Lebrons message to the kids... Stay off social media.

"Unless there's a cap spike in the summer of 2019 or 2020 I don't see how we could construct a championship caliber team. Capela, Harden, and Paul constitute 85% of next year's cap space. Eric and PJ are another 20%, so Free Agency is pretty much out the window. We need a ""Guy who can guard Kevin Durant"". Maybe we can do a sign and trade with Gordon + assets for a wing who wants to come to Houston, and pray the bench holds together for 20 games IDK. Maybe Morey drafts the next Parsons this year and we Rocket to the WCF after Durant goes to the Nets."
KEVIN DURANT DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS. Can we...just talk about practice?
"Very good for Toronto and Philaephia to make win now moves when Golden State has Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Demarcus Cousins!"
the Knicks traded our best player just to be mentioned in a Kevin Durant press conference.. so I guess that was worth it
Please do my favorite basketball player not named Kevin Durant 
Ah the luxury of having two of the best shooters in the history of the game. *And* kevin durant. *And* demarcus cousins. How this team isn't blowing out everyone by 30 points every night is the bigger question. 
"Because they have Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, DrYmonf Green and DeMarcus Cousins on their team. "
"October 3, 2018:  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24872197/kevin-durant-plans-honest-pending-free-agency"
"I didn't realize ""Maybe it doesn't make sense to harass kevin durant every time he speaks"" was reaching an extreme that demonstrated my lack of life experience.  Damn, thanks for the insight."
"So they were just talking about KD on the Jump, the funniest thing to me is that he literally said he was gonna [be transparent and talk about it during the pre-season.](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24872197/kevin-durant-plans-honest-pending-free-agency)  He brought this on himself."
"&gt; the guy literally beat the greatest NBA team of all time.  Imagine thinking that a team that didn't win the title is the greatest team of all time, especially when that team just subsequently added Kevin Durant.  Are you telling me you think they were better without Durant?"
"Kevin ""Do Rant"" Durant"
"&gt;""Let us be frank, with the caveat that the choice lives inside the head of one guy who can and does change his mind,"" Strauss wrote. ""Insiders around the league think Kevin Durant is leaving the Warriors for the Knicks.""   I mean, that's not a scorching hot take by Strauss. "
&gt;I won’t be taking my marching orders from Kevin Durant.  Wtf?  When did KD order this guy to do anything? 
"&gt; I’m not hiding who I am or pretending to be someone else on a secondary account just so I can make fun of Kevin Durant.   Thats exactly what youre doing though, you're just trying to justify it now by saying ""Everyone is anonymous so it doesn't matter!"" which also isn't true lol."
"Kevin Durant, asked how he's doing this morning: ""I WILL SKULL FUCK THE NEXT REPORTER TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ME!!!"""
I mean in one breath he's telling Durant how he should have answered a question and then saying he 'doesn't take his marching orders from Kevin Durant'
"Kevin Durant makes an obscene percentage of his shots, given their difficulty."
If Demps could have only gone back in time and stopped Kevin Durant from leaving OKC maybe he would still have a job.
"Their situation is completely different. Basketball is one of the most individualistic sports, but it's a team sport. So if we talk about individuals and wins, you can't ignore that each player has a team and they're only one player on that team. The Rockets have had many players basically die throughout the season, but the Warriors on the other hand have been a very strong team for years, even before Kevin Durant became a Warrior. The Warriors had the better season, because they won many more games, but who had the better performance between any two players is what we get to debate about, even if it isn't that important"
Yea but I'm thinking more like this (including all top free agents)  Demarcus Cousins - Clippers  Kevin Durant - Lakers  Kawhi Leonard - Clippers  Jimmy Butler - Knicks  Klay Thompson - Warriors  Kemba Walker - Pacers  Kyrie Irving- Knicks  Middleton- Bucks  Tobias Harris - 76ers  Terry Rozier - Suns  Kristaps Porzingis - Mavericks  DeAndre Jordan - Knicks
"They should trade the 3rd pick, DSJ, Knox, Trier and Robinson to the Pelicans for Anthony Davis.  That will clear enough cap space to sign Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant, if they're willing to accept 5% less than max.  Anthony Davis + Kawhi Leonard + Kevin Durant = Title contenders for the next 4 years.     Alternatively, they can replace Durant with Kyrie Irving, that would allow the Knicks to keep Mitchell Robinson and still pay everyone their full max.   There is no scenario where the Knicks should use the draft pick themselves.  Anthony Davis will only be 26 yrs old next season.  He is worth more than the #1 overall pick.  Especially since he is basically bait that will lure 2 other superstars to NYC."
"If the Kings get cap space for two stars then then maybe. The thing is, I’d think that FA’s would rather play in Dallas and they also get no tax at home games. So if KP comes back healthy and Dallas signs maybe a Jimmy Butler or hell Kevin Durant because he’s a wild card. "
"i'd rather have Kevin Durant, Embiid and Kyrie over Harden."
Kevin Durant

2k13 Yi Jianlian would object! Asian Kevin Durant!
You grew up to root for Kevin Durant. 
The answer is still the same. Kevin Durant.
kevin durant :sunglases:
More than 20 players in no particular order who are easily better than Luka Doncic:  1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry   3. Kevin Durant  4. James Harden  5. Anthony Davis  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo   7. Russel Westbrook  8. Paul George  9. Kawhi Leonard   10. Damian Lillard.  11. Kyrie Irving  12. Joel embiid  13. Ben Simmons  14. Kemba Walker   15. Nikola Jokic  16. Karl Anthony Towns  17. Jimmy Butler   18. Blake Griffin   19. Klay thompson  20. Donovan Mitchell   21. DeMar DeRozan  22. Kyle Lowry  23. Jrue Holliday   24 Demarcus Cousins 
Yea no we don't. Kevin Durant ruining the league for the last 3 years has been pretty wack honestly
IKR. Then they can make room for another star. Kevin Durant perhaps
Wow I think you just discovered a way to make davis more hated than kevin durant 
"According to you, it’d be fine if Kevin Durant, kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson all went to New York and took less than the max to make it work. Greg could all take 20 mil. Then they’d have plenty left for a good bench. That’s fair right. According to you it is. Nice. "
"Kevin of Durant, first of his name, forward of the Bay"
"Humble: Kevin Love   Arrogant: a toss-up between LeBron, Klay, Durant, Jimmy and Embiid. "
"A max contract is actually more like $33 million, or about $38 million if it's going to Kevin Durant. Also, Zubac's cap hold this summer is going to be $4 million, not $2 million. All that money makes a difference.   In any event I think you're overrating Zubac. He's a decent prospect, but he's an around the basket player only, on both ends of the floor. That kind of player is kind of a relic in today's NBA. I simply do not think the Lakers were going to bring him back this summer, not at what is going to be a market price for him, even if they could have exceeded the cap to do it. "
"Don't worry about what goes on at the top, unless you're Kevin Durant."
To be fair I’d rather have Steph curry and Kevin Durant take the last shot then Paul Pierce or Klay. 
"The first 3 draft grades I came across from 2008 praised the move, and the fourth was more skeptical but still kind of liked it.  I just don't remember many people questioning it as a reach, and my initial search at least backs that up.  Positive  &gt;Another brilliant draft from Sam Presti and Rich Cho. Westbrook was thought to be in play all over the top-10 leading up to the draft; picking him at No. 4 was considered no small risk. As it turns out, he's clearly one of the three best players from the draft, and many would take him No. 2. To land Ibaka at No. 24 is pure frosting. And hey, who remembered that there was a Hardin on this team before there was a Harden?  Positive  &gt;The Sonics GM Sam Presti is surrounding Kevin Durant with some great defenders. Russell Westbrook is one of the most athletic players in the draft, just ask Cal or Oregon. He won Pac-10 defensive player of the year and it should translate into good defense in the league. It will take him a year or two to learn the point guard position but he will be solid. Has a chance to be a Gilbert Arenas type with less scoring. Ibaka from the Congo is only 18 years old and when he finally makes it to Oklahoma City he will be a beast. I wouldn't be surprised if he blocks 3 shots a game soon. D.J. White is a horse with a decent jump shot and should bring a spark off the bench. Hardin is a project but will bring a defensive presence right away.  Positive  &gt;The team without a home had a solid draft adding one potential star in the backcourt (Westbrook) and some solid frontcourt potential. Gm Sam Presti did a solid job to resist the temptation to add Brook Lopez and take a player with considerably more upside at the fourth pick in Russell Westbrook. It's decisions like this that define a GM, and Presti made an excellent one. Ibaka is a solid gamble for the future who likely won't see NBA action for 3-4 years. DJ White, while on the small side (reportedly measuered 6'6.25 without shoes) has an enormous wingspan 7'3 and great leaping ability making him a Jason Maxiell type of player. Hardin is a tremendous athlete at his size with limited drive and skill.  Skeptical  &gt;I love Westbrook (5) and believe he has the skill set to eventually be a great point guard, but I know Jerryd Bayless does have the offensive skills to be a great point guard.  Bayless works extremely well without the ball and would have been the perfect point guard for a system built around Kevin Durant.  While not a defender like Westbrook, Bayless has enough athleticism and desire to be well above average.  Westbrook will be a great player, regardless, because of his skills defensively, but if he doesn't become a great point guard, for the sake of argument, then they will be stuck with an energy 6th man.  There is a slight chance that Westbrook ends up being a better player than Bayless, but I don't like that risk/reward equation.  "
"If you tell him he’s a primary reason why it was the best team, yeah, I see that being effective in the recruitment of a Kevin Durant"
Tony Allen for Kevin Durant 
"There are 2 ways to look at it in my opinion.    1) If you are looking at it purely as ""all-time greatest"" basketball player, the argument probably leans towards Wade as points and championships are the two-factors most people look to first when comparing players.   * Wade's 08-09 Year he had career highs in Games Played, Assists, Steals, Blocks and Points scored and lead the league in scoring (30.2 ppg).  * Wade has more championships. Additionally, his first championship in the 2005-2006 season, he beat Dallas and Dirk at arguably Dirk's career apex. (Statistically Dirk's best string of years are from 02-03 through 09-10)   * Wade has 4 seasons averaging at least 26.6 points or more. Dirk's highest average points in a season, 26.6.    * We obviously don't know, but when basketball historians look back, the story may go that LeBron left Cleveland to go play with Wade in Miami, rather than Wade going somewhere else. I think this in a weird way will help his legacy.     2) If you are looking ""All-Time Most Influential/Impactful"" basketball players, the argument leans towards Dirk.     * Not counting this season, Dirk averaged playing 73.55 games a season over 20 seasons. In relation to other notable 7'0""+ players, this is extraordinarily high.   For reference:    **Kareem** = 78.21 Avg Games Played (AGP), 19 Seasons   **Marc Gasol** = 71.6 AGP, 10 Seasons   **David Robinson** = 71 AGP, 13 Seasons   **Ewing** = 69.87, 16 Seasons   **Dikembe** = 69.8, 17 seasons   **Wilt** = 68.78, 14 Seasons (69.67, 15 Seasons)   **Hakeem** = 69.23, 17 Seasons   **Pau Gasol** = 66.44, 18 Seasons   **Shaq** = 65, 18 seasons   (Note: All stats for above players are EXCLUDING the final season [or in M. Gasol's case, current] played. This is to align with not counting Dirk's current season in his stats. Players with obvious injury history were also left off the list such as Yao Ming &amp; Bill Walton [though officially only 6'11"")    * Dirk is the only 7-Footer to have ever won the 3-Point Shooting Contest (2006). His win basically was the coronation of the idea that not all big men have to play in the paint. [Here is a blog post/article from 2-years ago detailing the win and Dirk's history in the competition](https://www.mavsmoneyball.com/2017/2/16/14629156/remembering-dirk-nowitzki-three-point-contest-winner-nba-all-star).    * He has a signature shot that has been emulated and used by multiple players in the modern game. Unlike Hakeem's Dream Shake, Kareem's Sky Hook, and others, Dirk's signature move was something that almost any player can emulate and incorporate successfully into their game. [Here is an article by Tim MacMahon on ESPN last year titled, ""Why Dirk Nowitzki's Legacy Will Never Fade Away""](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22188892/how-lebron-james-kevin-durant-other-stars-carrying-dirk-nowitzki-fadeaway-legacy-nba)    * When it's all said and done, we may look at Dirk as the player that signifies the change and acceptance of foreign players into the NBA. He differentiates himself from Hakeem before him because he did not go to a US College. He stands apart from Yao Ming because of his longevity and career accomplishments. He will be more memorable (due to no part of their own) than Tony Parker, Manu Ginobli, Pau Gasol and others of the same era that won championships, because he did it as THE focal point of his team. He was THE guy that carried the torch for his franchise.  "
"Kevin Durant - 27.6 PPG - 6.3 FTM/G - 23% of points from free throws  LeBron James - 26.8 PPG - 5.1 FTM/G - 19% of points from free throws  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 27.2 PPG - 6.6 FTM/G - 24% of points from free throws  Rank wise Giannis - 10, KD - 14, LeBron - 33"
"For sure, Giannis was the only bright spot during that terrible season. You could see his potential his rookie year. I still remember when he blocked Kevin Durant his rookie year, I was going nuts. "
"Michael Porter jr was one of the top high school recruits in the nation 2 years ago. Most services had him somewhere in the top 3, if not top overall.  For example, rivals ranking for the class of 2017 were as follows:  1.	MPJ 2.	Marvin Bagley 3.	Deandre Ayton 4.	Mo Bamba 5.	Trevon Duval 6.	Jaren Jackson 7.	Wendell Carter Jr 8.	Collin Sexton 9.	Mitchell Robinson 10. Kevin Knox   Trae young was 16, Lonnie Walker 19, SGA 34 etc.  Typically basketball recruiting at the top level is a lot more accurate than it is for football. The top end guys almost always tend to be at least NBA contributors if not legit stars. Notice how basically the entire top 10 are highly drafted guys from last years NBA draft, many of whom are already ballin out.  MPJ was rated the highest. And he was projected to be a top 3 lottery pick as well. And then when he got to Missouri for his single year of college, he had a back injury. He had some fluid leaking from the little sacs that go in between your vertebrae discs which was causing pain and leg weakness. He played only like 8 minutes of his first game, then rushed back to play in the NCAA tournament but wasn’t very effective.  He was still expected to be a high lottery pick - though probably not top 5 anymore - until just a few days before the draft news got out that he needed a second surgery to clean up some stuff with his discs. This scared a lot of teams away. From what I can tell (not an expert), none of this should be anything long-lasting that affects his playing career, but we are likely going to redshirt him this entire season.  In terms of his game, he’s a 6’11” Forward who has a silky smooth shot. He is lethal from outside as well as from midrange. He’s drawn comparisons to Kevin Durant - which is pretty lofty, but in terms of absolute ceiling, it’s not the worst comp. Our GM did an interview in which he said “any concern with Michael is all medical - no one has any concern about his ability on the basketball court. And in talking to our people, we felt comfortable with his medicals.” "
"&gt; Harden burns out  almost as if the team surrounding him matters.  &gt; He’s not a post season leader at all.  he has been pretty successful in the brutal western conference. In the last 7 years only the Warriors, Spurs and OKC made it out of the WCF. So not making out of a conference in which two historic teams have is nothing to hold your head down about.   &gt; I also though that “post season success” would include winning the WCF and the Finals?  he lost to the Warriors twice. and the last time he lost the second best player on the team was injured for the last two games. This was the 73 win team that ADDED Kevin Durant while our second best player was 33 years old. You are a Spurs fans so your idea of normal isn't based on reality. After maybe a decade of not even making the conference Finals let's see if you change your tune."

That’s funny because Steph didn’t even get 60 wins or the 1st seed last year with Kevin Durant as his teammate
"See, it's a flagrant because Kevin Durant was CLEARLY out of bounds that one time. "

"This is pretty cheat code-y level stats: &gt;[Through the past six games, Kevin Durant has made 50 out of his last 66 2-point attempts. H/T @DoubleR_PR](https://twitter.com/MarkG_Medina/status/1095897974306009088)"
"I mean, I assume you're going from '78 through '12 with that 35 year misery stretch, which is ignoring 9 winning seasons and a couple 50 win years.  Now don't get me wrong: that's overall a REALLY horrible stretch.  But given the topic was getting high draft picks, that certainly wasn't a 35 year *straight* stretch of *nothing but* misery.  Hell, as bad as you were for the most part, I don't think you guys ever had the worst record in the league, did you?  And one of your worst years also saw you not even have your first round pick, giving one less good shot at a #1.  Look, I don't know what you're really trying to get at here.  The Warriors had a long as stretch where they were mostly terrible.  Okay.  You've also won 3 out of the last 4 titles, in no small part because luck gave you guys the opportunity to sign Kevin Durant.  Luck that Curry started his career with injuries and was on a lower than max contract.  Luck that the cap raised astronomically for one season.  Luck that KD was a free agent and was willing to go there!    Most teams with major success, which you guys have, get lucky in a multitude of ways.  The Spurs dynasty was VERY lucky.  The Cavs have been incredibly lucky to get the picks we did and to have the best player of our generation born in Akron, Ohio.  The Heat were lucky that Darko Milicic was a thing.  Talking about luck doesn't take away from any of those teams accomplishments, but to imply that getting high picks in the draft is *the* deciding factor into which teams ""lucked out"" is ignorant *at best*."
It’s ok we are signing Kevin Durant

"One of my favourite Russ stories:  &gt;He pays his own bills, a rarity in the NBA, hauling stacks of them into the Thunder lunch room. “This isn’t $32,” a staffer heard him grouse at a miscalculated invoice.  The whole article is pretty good. [Source.](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant) "
Kevin Durant is 7'0
KD and Rich are confirmed to have an equity partnership with Master &amp; Dynamic (source: http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25951825/golden-state-warriors-star-kevin-durant-focused-building-future-basketball). It could just be that KD wanted to hook his buddy up with some swag but it does seem odd that Trier would tag Rich Kleiman as well. 
"Right. So Kevin Durant will go down as one of the greatest players ever. What going to gsw cost him is the possibility of being in the conversation of greatest of all time. Though, long term if he goes somewhere else and has a lot of success the addition of the Warrior years could help.    As far as watching basketball goes, he hasn't been pushed to his limit since joining the Warriors.   He gave up the possibility of being in the conversation for best ever for being on the best team ever. I guess it just come down to what he wants out of things. I'm of the opinion that he wanted to better than LeBron, but he can't have both of those things.    A three Pete with OKC, imo would have put him in that conversation but it would have been way more unlikely. "
"I disagree. If the current standings remain the same, they will receive a top five pick which they can package for another star or they could possibly keep them. The current top five prospects in the 2019 draft are Zion Williamson, Cameron Reddish, Rj Barrett, Ja Morant and Nassir Little according to the most recent Sports Illustrated Big Board; they could also keep one of these young prospects if they decide.   The only guaranteed contracts the Knicks have on the board for the 2019-2020 season are Lance Thomas for $7,600,000, Frank Ntilikina for $4,900,000, Dennis Smith for $4,500,000, Kevin Knox for $4,400,000, Mitchell Robinson for $1,600,000, Damyean Dotson for $1,600,000 and Allonzo Trier on a team option for $3,600,000. In a hypothetical situation, they could trade a package of their young prospects, Lance Thomas and three first round picks for Anthony Davis.   A potential starting five of:  PG: Frank Ntilikina  SG: Kyrie Irving SF: Kevin Durant PF: Anthony Davis  C: Mitchell Robinson  Or if they don’t pull of an Anthony Davis trade and luck into a number 1 pick they could start:  PG: Dennis Smith Jr SG: Kyrie Irving SF: Kevin Durant PF: Zion Williamson C: Mitchell Robinson  Bench: Frank Ntilikina, Kevin Knox, Damyean Dotson and some veterans.  You are also not taking into consideration that if they attract two big name free agents in Kyrie and Durant there will be a significant amount of veterans who would sign for cheap to contend and play in a high profile city like New York."
&gt;can we talk about basketball  &gt;here ESPN write an article about me being a business mogul  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25951825/golden-state-warriors-star-kevin-durant-focused-building-future-basketball
"This is true. However, that falls apart after a certain point. When the other team is as good as yours, or in the same league as yours, a transcendent player can will their way to win.  But when the other team has 4 all stars and you have 1.. there's not much you can do.  Kevin Durant is cold? Pass it to Steph Curry? Woah, crazy night, they're both cold. Oh yeah, just pass it over to Klay, and have him hit 10 threes.  The only way for one player to turn the tide of that series is to average 60 points in the series, which no player ever could do."
"Why would guys like Michael Jordan, from North Carolina, want to win championships for Chicago? Do we think that Kevin Durant feels differently about trying to win championships while representing the states of Oakland and California?  It's about winning the title itself, not the city where your home arena is."
^ Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant.  KD has outplayed Lebron the last 3 regular seasons. KD outplayed Lebron in the 2017 Finals.  KD/Lebron were close in the 2018 Finals but I give the tie breaker to the guy who made the biggest shot of the series and who won FMVP.  KD and Lebron's offensive impact is virtually the same. Lebron is the better passer. But KD is the better shooter, scorer, and provides more spacing and is much much better off the ball. This allows other Stars like Curry/Klay to not lose anything playing with KD. And KD isn't a slouch in playmaking. He is averaging 7 assists per game.   On defense KD absolutely blows Lebron out of the water. KD lead both teams in block in the last 2 Finals, is a legit rim protector, and can guard 1-5 at a high level. And most importantly KD can SUSTAIN THIS DEFENSIVE EFFORT FOR 40 MINUTES."
kevin durant is the best player in he NBA right now 
"Yeah man I’m sure Warriors fans of the future will appreciate B Diddy more than Kevin Durant, good take.  "
Kevin Durant
"Absolute best case scenario is if the Knicks manage to bring in Kevin Durant and any combination of Klay/Middleton/Kyrie.  At THAT point, would be the only time the front office considers trading Zion, Dennis Smith Jr, Kevin Knox and a future 1st for Anthony Davis.    That being said, I think 2 superstars surrounded by half a decade's worth of lottery talent on rookie contracts, some on 2nd rounder contracts, is a better team than an empty roster with AD, KD &amp; Kyrie.  Especially when one of the players is Zion Williamson.  "
Kevin Durant proved how useless a bench press is for NBA players.
Maybe Kevin Durant will come play backup for Kawhi and we can add him to the list.
"I agree he forces the team to have bad future. But I think if you ask the Cavs fans generally now, they much rather have that 1 sweet championship than never got the taste of winning it. They could also win a second if not for Kevin Durant going to GSW. Yeah in the next 5-6 years they will be in mediocrity, but they got that championship to look at."
Maybe if you tried comparing Kevin “not an elite 3pt shooter” Durant to his peers like you said it would be pretty obvious but you are too emotional to do that apparently 
Imagine you’re in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and a zombified Kevin Durant (or Brandon Ingram) starts sprinting towards you
"&gt; under any circumstances.  You're James Harden, you have 5 fouls, you're up 2 points with a 10 seconds left, and you have the option to foul Kevin Durant as he drives down for an otherwise uncontested dunk.  It's pretty obviously best to concede the bucket in that case."
"""Let me put it to you this way, Lebron was the cool step dad who brought you gifts and cool stuff. Truly one of a kind, once a generation.  Russel Westbrook is the dad who instead of taking time to take care of you and your family, is instead trying to put up BIG numbers at work. Never caring about anything else except those big numbers  Kevin Durant is the mom, that does everything right, but you understood why she divorced your stat padding father""  "
Jazz played really well for 31 minutes. That first quarter and 5 min stretch late made for a hard game. Kevin Durant is unbelievable. Cousins isn't. 
Lebron is not Kevin Durant. He chooses his words carefully and used the media to his advantage for like 13 years straight now 
You just watch Kevin Durant and laugh. That guy is freakishly coordinated for his size 
TIL Kevin Durant is a gifted athlete 
Kevin “Shaun Livingston” Durant with the mid range.
Kevin Durant and Thunder

"[Levick] Kevin Durant walked into the OKC locker room, sat down and said ""That's the last time I try winning with these cats."" After losing a 3-1 lead in the WCF he clarified that he was, of course, signing with Golden State "
"No. I was pretty happy for Cleveland fans to experience a championship in their lifetime. While I was rooting for the Warriors in the 2016 Finals, I definitely felt happy for LeBron, as I saw a level of joy in his celebration that exceeded those in his previous championships. We got to see a spectacular performance from Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love got to vindicate himself after being a scapegoat for so long, and numerous Cavalier role players who were subjected to unfair criticism (which often happens given the intense media scrutiny on a LeBron team) got to relish in the glory for a bit. Plus we got some great J.R. Smith moments.  More importantly, given how much I hate Clay Bennett, I was very happy to see Kevin Durant leave, and I think he would have been much more likely to leave the Thunder if the Warriors left, as I don't think he was likely to have left for another free agency destination. (As a side note, I now live in Seattle, but the Sonics had already left before I decided to move there, and my distaste of Bennett and all similar owners would have been independent of my residence.) I also think that the Durant/Westbrook pairing was not particularly well-suited for championship success and relied on their individual talents. By leaving, Durant optimized his chances for championships (perhaps too easily) and Westbrook got the opportunity to exhibit his individual brilliance. While I am not fond of his style of play (it is reckless, ball-dominant, and inefficient), but certainly has its merits (stat-stuffing non-stop hustle from one of the most athletic and relentless competitors the game has ever seen). Fans who enjoy that playstyle get to see Russell Westbrook fully unleashed."
"  He does get superstar calls, like every other superstar.  He also punishes people who hand check by doing the rip through - a move that Kevin Durant popularized and is used by several other stars today.   I think there's just a little more nuance to it than many people realize.  People that don't watch his  games just see the egregious calls that are cherry picked and posted here to stir the pot.     Anyone that watches the Rockets enough can tell you that the majority of the fouls on him are getting hacked on the arm during a drive or getting legitimately fouled on his stepback.   "
Kevin Durant
"So here's the thing. If Pau Gasol was practically any other kind of celebrity aside from being an athlete and claimed something said or written about him was untrue, any publication with a hint of journalistic integrity would fact check that shit. Someone claiming your reporter is lying is serious business in practically any other area other than sports.  [Remember this?](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/kevin-durant-stephen-a-smith-lakers-lies)  Remember how ESPN addressed one of their top personalities being accused of lying by the subject of his report? Anything about ESPN investigating the source and standing by the report? Anything that they showed any diligence in fact-checking SAS? Anything about standing by his report?  [Instead, this happened.](http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=13815312) Smith overtly threatened Durant (with what, nobody knows) and the network put up the video so everyone could watch it.  You can argue the particulars of how seriously we should take SAS or how sports aren't a serious business, but the coverage has become an absolute joke. There is no accountability in reporting, there is no rigor, and there's no reason for a reader to implicitly trust what they're reading."
I predict Kevin Durant will score more than 20 points in one of the 4 finals games
Kevin Durant is 4-1 in playoff series versus the Spurs. Stop.

"Ok, lets see them do it with NBA calibre defence on them.  That's what makes it impressive. I can shoot great from the 3 point line at my gym, probably like 8/10. I will shoot 0/10 when someone like Kevin Durant is defending me."
"GSW: has 2-time MVP Stephen Curry, MVP Kevin Durant, 5-time All-Star 2-time All-NBA Klay Thompson, DPOY Draymond Green  also GSW: Andre Iguodala is a more valuable player than Hall of Fame top 10 point guard of all time Chris Paul"
"What's more shameful?  A team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Boogie Cousins and Draymond Green losing a game to he Rockets without James Harden...  Or Team USA losing a game to Puerto Rico in the 2004 Olympics?  Close call, but I'm gonna have to say that the stacked Warriors losing a game brings more shame to their families.  "
"Wow.  A team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Boogie Cousins and Draymond Green lost a game. That's straight-up shameful. Reminds me of when Team USA lost to Puerto Rico."
"They should absolutely steamroll everyone in the playoffs, but let's be honest... I'm disgusted that a team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Boogie Cousins and Draymond Green lost a game. That's straight-up shameful. Reminds me of when Team USA lost to Puerto Rico."
"Cousins is from another era when he was one of the ONLY big men to shoot 3's and be able to dribble. He came from an era when doing post up work was still ""fashionable"" and people actually watched the idiocy happen on the low block while other players just stared and watched it happen (david robinson, shaq, ya ming, kareem, ).

- Steph Curry with Russell Westbrook athleticism.   - Klay Thompson with Kyrie Irving's handle.  - Kevin Durant with Draymond Green's defensive IQ.  - Draymond Green with Kyle Korver's jumper.  - Demarcus Cousins with DeAndre Jordan's hops.  - Andre Iguodala with LeBron's finishing ability.  you pick just one of those and the Warriors are going 82-0
AKA Kevin Durant.
"Looks like Kevin durant is busy on his burner accounts, this ring isn't as free as the last 2"
Kings will sign Kevin Durant in the offseason.
"So this was interesting. I was talking to some GSW staffers I know as the Warriors’ team bus is pulling off. Suddenly, Kevin Durant comes around the corner. Bus gone. Draymond forced to turn back for the guy. Damn snake."
"So this was interesting. I was talking to some New York Post staffers I know as the Knicks’ team bus is pulling off. Suddenly, Kevin Durant comes around the corner. Bus gone. It had to come back for the superstar. Damn miracle."

Kevin Durant Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Demarcus cousins Draymond green  Just in case you forgot.  You said someone would be a tough out for that team?
Fell apart in the postseason? They took the Warriors to 7 games (without HOF point guard CP3). They've given the Warriors the most competition since the snake Durant slithered to a 73-9 win team.    The Rockets did even better than LeBron with Kyrie Irving (the best point guard in the East) and Kevin Love (who was a perennial All-Star and got 32/12 in 25 minutes today). This isn't a knock on LeBron or the Cavs but to say they fell apart in the postseason is a blatant lie and proof you don't watch or even follow NBA basketball. 
Superstar free agents:  **Tier 1** (bonafide superstars)  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  **Tier 2**  Kyrie Irving   Kemba Walker  Jimmy Butler   **Tier 3**  Tobias Harris  Khris Middleton  Demarcus Cousins (?)  Klay 
Is Kevin Durant even playing?
"Sorry Klay, you aren’t Kevin Durant "
Kevin Durant might be the best player in the world. Please come to the Knicks
Kevin Durant is the most unstoppable player in the NBA. 
Kevin Durant gets away with stupid basketball and I hate it.
Faried is a rich man's Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant made him look okay 
"He was a 5x all star in Toronto and made the All NBA 2nd team in 2007. He only missed the ASG his rookie season (11 ppg 7 rpg) and his sophomore year (17 ppg 9 rpg). The forwards he was going up against for All NBA in 2006-2010 were prime Dirk, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, Amare Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant etc... I think he was appropriately recognized. "
"No he isn't. And the reason is that Lebron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antenokunmpoty are better"
I can tolerate Kevin Durant as long as he stays in Stephs shadow where he belongs. 
"Cmon big fella, say it. Say you love your 2x finals mvp Kevin Durant. "
"There's also the fact that while the idea of 3s and layups being efficient might be correct during a long regular season, when it's a short playoff series with consecutive games and opponents being able to gameplan and get used to you, they'll just give you the mid-range and run players off the 3 pt line and pack the paint. Why wouldn't a defense do that?   The mid-range has historically brought championships to players that mastered it. Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and even Kevin Durant live off the mid-range. The Warriors recognized the flaw in their own offense and it's KD that really set them over the top. I honestly believe LBJ if he had a healthy Cavs team probably would have won that first series. And at that point it's 2-0 Cavs, maybe Kyrie wants to stay and maybe KD doesn't go to GSW, wouldn't surprise me if LBJ has 3 in a row even at that point. But whatever, that's a digression.  Point is, mid-range creates an additional threat and then makes those 3s and layups possible. That's something Morey and MDA don't seem to want to admit, but most competitors would tell you that you always want to increase your own options while shutting down an opponent's options. In this case MDA philosophy is essentially like getting completely shut down on the mid-range, they just concede it entirely, and let teams focus on the other two areas. Also yeah the FTs do drop a bit in playoff games or rather it's they can drop, especially in big games. You just can't be that dependent on the calls at all times.   Whatever though, Rockets are still my team and I'm of course going to root for them and hope things work out anyway. "
and he's leading by 350 without it. why is citing that offensive to you. he takes more FG and FT attempts than Paul George or Kevin Durant. 
yes and James Harden is heavily reliant upon FTs compared to guys like Paul George and Kevin Durant. The numbers you cited show that. 
"Sucks this is downvoted as it's 100% accurate. No one saw Harden was going to be one of the greats, he was avg 17pts a game and disappeared in the finals and Kevin Martin who replaced him the Thunder won like 62 games the next year. So I don't hold it against Presti, but the truth is the truth, OKC would've been better off keeping Harden no matter the tax burden.  Durant plays so much better defense on the Warriors but he also covers the 4 a lot more than he did at OKC."
"Isolation gets criticized sometimes, but I think it's important to note that this style of play has beaten the Kevin Durant Warriors in the playoffs more than every other team combined. "
"Terrible play? He was the 7th youngest player to ever reach 7,000 points. The other six were Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady."
Kevin Durant exposed himself for taking the easy way out the moment he signed with Golden State. And it’s idiotic saying George is better at basketball than Durant.
And? Kevin Durant was 21 years old when he started his streak of 4 years leading the NBA in PPG. That's the minimum age required to drink and he was destroying grown men in their primes. 
Here it is IMO 10. Anthony Davis 9. Joel Embiid 8. Paul George 7. Kawhi Leonard 6. Steph Curry 5. James Harden  4. Kevin Durant 3. Giannis 2. Lebron 1. BRAIN SCALIBRINE AKA WHITE MAMBA AKA GOAT  
"Paul George- My MVP  Giannis Antetokounmpo- Second for MVP imo, but Paul is the clear favorite  Kevin Durant- even though I hate his guts, he’s been pretty good this year  James Harden- dudes been lighting it up offensively, while it’s impressive there’s more to basketball than the PPG stat  Stephen Curry- same old Steph  LeBron James- would be higher if he didn’t get hurt for a month or so, and the Lakers were in a better position to make playoffs (even though they’re just a few games out)  Kawhi Leonard- even though him and the Raptors seem to be on the same page, and letting him sit every few games, he’s had an incredible impact on the court, and even with the possibility of him leaving in the offseason it doesn’t seem to effect the Raptors. (I’m also a Raptors fan so might be a little biased)  Nikola Jokic- the man is winning games and has (shockingly imo) led them to the 2nd SEED in the WEST. That’s impressive  Joel Embiid- even though this year he’s been a little banged up, and has missed some time this year, averaging 27 PPG and 13 RPG is pretty good.  Damian Lillard- even with CJ McCollum seemingly regressing this year, Lillard has somehow managed to get them to the 4th SEED in the WEST. Pretty much all my himself. That’s pretty good, imo he is top 5 in MVP, but won’t get it.  What y’all think?"
"Lebron James, first man to go to 10 straight finals with future hall of famers Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Coach Steve Kerr, Klay Thompson, and future NBA retired player Quin Cook, after going to eight straight himself.  Finally he is the greatest."
OP so touchy I'm starting to think we have Kevin Durant here.

"He had more exposure in the playoffs for sure, especially when you go up against LeBron fucking James like 3 times. He was a young upcoming player going against the best and doing well enough, he was hyped a lot. He only has more exposure in the regular season now because he plays with Russell Westbrook. If it wasn't for him and previously Kevin Durant, OKC would never be on national TV."
Kevin Durant being a warrior probably cost Steph at least one more MVP. Unleashed MVP russ tho so worth it.
That's like comparing Pascal Siakim to Kevin Durant lmao
"i said i would take him over kevin durant and this sub laughed at me. Guy is the best player i don't care how many ""westbrook has no help"" posts are made."
"Curry plays more with rougher lineups than KD does.  RPM is the stat to check for this, since it takes into account the quality of the other players on the floor.  Kevin Durant is 6th at +5.46 and Curry is 7th at +5.39. They're so close, they could flip positions depending on a single game result. As you can see, they've been pretty much even in impact this season.  "

"Yeah but if he had an opportunity to trade him for a  uber superstar, say a Kevin Durant, he would do it!"
"The other ovation being Kevin Durant in 06/07. Dude balled the fuck out in the first half, but got injured and didn't play as much in the second half. Still scored 37 in regulation.  Thought he was going to drop 80."
"&gt;They know how it’ll go.  They have a phenomenal debut regular season, during the end of which Kyrie breaks his knees and retires early to live out the rest of his days in a Scientologist monastary to work on his model of the universe, KD takes his team to the Second round putting up great numbers, but are stopped by Kawhi Leonard's Magic in an entertaining but utterly uncompetitive 5 game series.   The Knicks hover between 40 and 50 games for a few seasons, with KD becoming less efficient over the years as he has to take over increasingly more of the offense, and in the midst of a particularly bad losing streak he receives a minor hamstring injury and has to sit out a few weeks. While he's recovering, the Knicks turn it around, largely as a result of Quinn Cook's sudden emergence as an All-Star caliber player who takes over games singlehandedly. KD is excited at the start of ""Quinnsanity,"" but as the media turns from the narrative of the Knicks finally having a potential contender behind an All-NBA Kevin Durant towards the idea that KD's ball dominance is both the cause of the Knick's losing streak and suppressing the talent of young phenoms like Quinn Cook. These fears are compounded when KD returns, as Cook recedes to the status of a mere mortal as the lofty win streak fades and the Knicks return to their plodding .500 tradition in the KD era. As the excited and hopeful cheers of MSG are replaced more and more with boos, jeers, and the ever present chant of ""Cupcake!"" KD starts to lose the modicum of faith left in his franchise, his teammates, and even his own abilities.   The Knicks fail to retain Quinn in the offseason, being unwilling to offer him either the max contract, or the team success promised by the Portland Blazers, and they whiff on any true All-Star Free Agents, however they manage to secure Blake Griffin at a five year deal at only 80% of a max contract. The much remarked upon Rudy Gay and Ish Smith signings (also on long term deals), there's finally some hope for the floundering Knicks. When they manage to trade some young assets and a few (surely late!) first round picks to the Hawks in exchange for Tristan Thompson, the Knicks have a starting five that surely will be able to keep up with the best of them, and when newly minted president of Basketball Operations Carmelo Anthony brings in a coach capable of running Anthony's famous ""Rhombus"" offense, and expectations are sky high in MSG for the first time since that fateful summer of '19.    The season is a disaster. After a promising 20-6 start to the season, a crushing fifty point loss to the Charlotte Hornets utterly demoralized the team, and they proceed to lose the next 20 consecutive games. Fighting breaks out between players and coaching staff, between players and players, between Melo and everyone. A series of injuries cripples the Knicks, more and more the long term contracts signed with once-capable veterans starts to look like an Albatross weighing down on the franchise. The team rallies near the end of the season, with KD playing with effort the fans haven't seen in years, and they go on to clinch the 8th seed. As game one of the playoffs approaches, the few non-jaded fans start to stoke hope in their team being able to take on the 74 win Hornets- the acquisition of Avery Bradley at the deadline and the way the team finally looks like it's clicking in those last few weeks overcomes the horrible record and lackluster play from the middle of the season. They may be the 8 seed, but they can play with the best of them when they're clicking, and with Blake back they can take on anyone! With an appalling average margin of victory of 38 points, the Hornets sweep the Knicks in the first round.   That off-season, KD requests a trade, reportedly to the 74 win champion Hornets themselves. Instead, with 2 years left on his contract he is traded back to the Thunder for salary filler and protected second rounders, where he falls out of the starting lineup halfway through the season. As the Knicks death spiral continues, rumors of ownership wanting to cut losses with the franchise start ramping up. After an aborted attempt to move the franchise to Seattle fails, ownership sells the team, for a paltry 500 million dollars, to James Dolan. "
" Perkins has an interesting case:  12 Man Squad:  PG: Russell Westbrook/Rajon Rondo,  SG: James Harden/Ray Allen/Dwayne Wade.  SF: Lebron James/Kevin Durant/Paul Pierce.

"Ah, I get what you mean.  But it's easier to justify a higher starting offer to negotiate with if the team is already good, especially if you have Kevin Durant on your team."
"Yeah, Dwight played in an era of really no dominant big men.  Carmelo lost out to LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Dirk, Tim Duncan.  Dwight only had one serious contender, Yao Ming, and his peak was limited.  "
Probably the one player that would scare off Kevin Durant so almost a certainty.  
Kevin Popovich Durant over here
Imagine being made that the team is losing a lot of games but you're not jazzed about playing with Kevin Durant lmfao
"oh no not harrison barnes, and all they get back is Kevin Durant?"

KEVIN DURANT LMFAO HE TRIED TO PASS IT AT FIRST
I want to hear Kevin Durant heap more praise on us!
That wasn't even his final form.  https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/serial-crotch-puncher-chris-paul-kevin-durant-article-1.2559486
HOLY FUCK KEVIN DURANT DPOY
More like Kyrie and Kevin Durant
"Brandon ""Kevin 'I Hate Media' Durant"" Ingram"
I dont like Kevin Durant 
"I'm still pissed at how they handled it. Assuring him he wasn't going to be traded and then trading him and then letting him find out *on camera* was bullshit.  I am torn in my feelings about the Kings, because I like Kings fans and want nice things for them, but fuck their front office I want *them* never to see success of any kind.  I want the Warriors to win the championship more this year than I have since Kevin Durant joined. I want Boogie to get a ring."
"Right because Kevin Durant didn't become a perennial all star after  not being able to bench a single rep at the combine. If you're using chest in a jumpshot, then your form is wrong. It's all legs. "
Cleveland's 2016 championship changed the landscape of the NBA. Kevin Durant said he wouldn't have joined the Warriors if they won the championship that year.
"He was drafted 2nd behind a guy who was literally compared to Bill Russell and Kareem  Kevin Durant at Texas was widely considered the greatest NCAA freshman of all time, people knew he was good"
"To add to #1, Kevin Durant made it clear he wouldn't have gone to the Warriors if they had won in 2016."

"Okay, so why not bring those up? Acting like rings are all that matters is useless  Someone can say something like ""Kevin Durant is better than Tim Hardaway Jr because he's 4 or 5 inches taller"", and the fact that KD *is* better than Hardaway Jr doesn't make the comment any less stupid"
"Damn, I could have sworn he was four weeks older than Kevin Durant"
"Honestly, in theory most of those work.  The biggest problem with the thing is that the only players left in the NBA who could fill that loophole would be Lebron James and Dwight Howard, since they're the only players who'd have NCAA eligibility in this case (maybe European players as well). In other things, it'd be likely that if, say, Kevin Durant wanted to play for Kentucky, then Texas could rightfully say ""Hey wait a minute, Durant played for US when he was in college. Either he comes back to us for three years if he comes to the SEAAoGYAA, or collegiate rules should consider him a transfer- so he has to sit out a year, and Kentucky only gets him for two years.""  As far as employment competition, the big question on the salary cap would also be eliminated (since if there IS competition, there's only a limited number of years you could play), as well as the competition on the other side (if you're a SEAAoGYAA school, why recruit unproven high schoolers when you can recruit NBA players?   As far as partnering with pro teams in their respective sports- not only do I think it should happen, but I'd even dare say a move back to territorial rights and expansion should also happen. Between how small an NBA roster is at 15 people and how large the talent pool in basketball is, it's not unreasonable to say The NBA can support more than 30 teams...and you could make a strong argument it can go up to ""any city with a good-sized arena could support a pro basketball team."" This would need to work with SEAAoGYAA teams there- for example, on a territorial claim right now (and presumably who they'd partner with), the Celtics could claim territorial rights on any Boston College or UMass player...but also any UConn player, any Providence College or URI player, if there's a standout at UVM, UNH, or Maine, they can claim them...and that's way out of wack for it. But if suddenly they found ""Nope. The NBA expanded to Hartford, Providence, and Manchester as well..."", suddenly the Celtics' territorial rights (and amount of colleges they could partner with) is much more reasonable."
Kevin Durant plays on a team with 2 other 20 ppg scorers of course his efficiency will he higher. Who did AI have ?
Tbh a part of me will miss this era of 18 year old pros destroying college kids who have no business being on the same court as them.   NCAA made it possible for me to watch a full season of 5’11 Econ majors attempting to guard Kevin Durant . 
&gt;  AI would definitely be the best scorer in the league right now  ...  Have you heard of a guy named Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Steph would be the favorites for MVP if they split up.
MVP - Kevin Durant ROTY - RJ Barrett MIP - Nerlens Noel DPOY - Rudy Gobert
"A 73 win team replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. Think of that.   The 2017 Cavaliers have the highest playoff offensive rating  (including the finals loss) in NBA history. The 2017 Cavs are a historic NBA team that will be forgotten because of the Golden State talent roflstomp.   Everyone in July of 2016 can tell you the Warriors will win the next couple of championships due due to the talent that team had.   If you think LeBron was more concerned with his own stats than winning, then you're simply questioning the man who has proven he knows what it takes to win a basketball game. "
"&gt; Free throw rate is FTA/FGA. Harden takes so many shots per game of course his rate is lower than centers or a Ben Simmons who doesn’t shoot nearly as much as Harden.  Exactly?   &gt;To put it into perspective, Harden has 620 FTA. The next guard is Kevin Durant at 400.   Wait, the player with ~50% more usage gets ~50% more free throws? What's your point?   &gt;You’re absolute right about his usage leading to more FTA.  Then what was the point about going on about FTA above lmao?   You want me to name a guard that has the same stats as Harden, but I want you to name a guard that isos as much as Harden, than drives as much as Harden, that plays anything close to Harden's style in the modern NBA.   It's disingenuous to attribute Harden's FTs to the refs somehow just liking him more or something. It's 95% due to how hard his ISO game is to guard. "
Kevin Durant easily
"Free throw rate is FTA/FGA. Harden takes so many shots per game of course his rate is lower than centers or a Ben Simmons who doesn’t shoot nearly as much as Harden.  To put it into perspective, Harden has 620 FTA. The next guard is Kevin Durant at 400.   Show me the stats with Jordan.  Jordan, with Chicago, averaged 8.7 FTA per game. Harden, with Houston, averages 10.3.   Jordan has 5 seasons with 700+ FTA or more in a season. Harden is about to have his 6th.   Jordan had 2 seasons with 800+ FTA. Harden has had 3, had another at 792, and this season will probably be his fourth.  LeBron has had 5 700+ seasons, only 1 800+.   Which GUARD has had greater FTAs than Harden in 7 consecutive years? Harden’s 7 years of FTAs are historically greater than anything in Jordan’s or LeBron’s 15 year careers.   We have tons of evidence of Harden forcing calls on defenders by hooking, grabbing, flailing, flopping, etc. Not that other players don’t do it, but the rate we see Harden do it is excessive. There’s a reason he has the reputation he has.  You’re absolute right about his usage leading to more FTA. But it’s more than that. Harden’s usage, until the last two years, has been in-line with LeBron’s and typically below Jordan’s.   I’m not saying Harden doesn’t have ability, he clearly does. Or that he only scored on FTs, which would be an absurd statement. I’m just saying he creates FTA at a way above normal rate for a guard, partially due to play style, partially due to manipulation. And the result of so many FTA is players can’t defend him the same as other stars, which gives Harden even more scoring opportunities.  "
"So Zion is approached by a man, who says he comes from lands far west, wanting to build the best basketball team in the universe. He continues his serum treatment and eventually becomes 7'1 and beefy. His company also takes other young stars and infects them, namely: Brandon Ingram (who, surprisingly only grows to 200 pounds), A disposed Terry Rozier who is in shambles after being traded for Anthony Davis to New Orleans, a broken Jabari Parker who wants to return to form, and surprisingly LiAngelo Ball who is jealous of his older brother and wants a spot on a team. These serums change players into absolute units, and make them unguard-able.  Soon, these players cannot be ignored and are outright banned from the league for using unauthorized substances.   They gather together in a gym and meet with a coach and GM who can take them to the ultimate goal: being the best team ever. Enter Sam Hinkie, looking to get revenge on the NBA for ousting him and Tyronn Lue(for similar reasons).  Soon, this team challenges NBA teams in pre-season and exhibition games, winning by large margins. The NBA and Silver, under pressure by fans to add parity to the league add the new team to the league. They go by the name Monstars, and are based in San Diego.  Eventually fans realize this was a mistake and the team goes 82-0 for two seasons and sweeps the playoffs. In a desperate attempt, Silver approaches an aging LeBron James- asking to form one last superteam to save the league.  He obliges.    He gather the best of the best he can find. First, his loyal compadre and son: Kyrie Irving. Next, he'll need a pure scorer, someone who can fight the Monstars with his absolute skill and height. Kevin Durant. He also recruits Giannis Antetounkumpo, who is much like the Monstars and who LeBron loves everything about. Lastly, LeBron needs a big-man. He opts to choose Nikola Jokic, but the Nuggets organization doesn't want their star playing in an exhibition game so he chooses Joel Embiid. Another unit. They are called the Mango Boat Squad. A play on the Banana Boat squad LeBron wanted to form all those years ago.  They play in the Staples center. Every basketball fan from Bow-Wow to Bill Simmons is watching, on edge- wondering if the sport they love will be eliminated forever. The game starts and the Monstars take an early lead, but LeBron hits a LeFuckYouThree^TM at the end of the half to make it 90-85.   In the locker room, LeBron preaches to his teammates about the importance of this game, and why they are here. He recalls to Kyrie about their 3-0 comeback against Steph and the Warriors. He tells KD about their battles in the NBA finals. He tells Giannis about his 2019 MVP campaign and tells Embiid that there are shirley temples in it for him if he wins.   At the end of the third, the game is tied 130-130. The Monstars are tiring, as the serum has increased their weight but not their mental fortitude. The Mango squad surges and manages to bring the game to one bucket with 10 seconds left.   LeBron inbounds the ball to Kyrie who puts Rozier in a spin cycle and passes the ball through LiAngelos legs to Embiid. Embiid pump fakes and finds LeBron on the lob. As if almost in slow motion, LeBron grabs the lob and sends it to KD who is wide open in the corner. KD hits the shot as time expires, and the sport of basketball is saved.   "
"There is *a lot* to unpack here, so I'm gonna take it point by point.  &gt;Trae Young and John Collins are infinitely more solid than anyone below Hutchison and Dunn  Young and Collins are both good players. But Young hasn't proved anything beyond potential yet, and Collins is very good but still basically just a bouncy finisher and 3 point shooter. He's not a playmaker, nor is he a good defender. And beyond those 2 guys everybody on the team is basically banking on potential. Spellman, Huerter, and future picks are all just hypotheticals at this point.  Hypotheticals and future potential are good to have, but saying the Hawks, Cavs etc are in better positions just because they have more future draft picks is ignoring the fact the the Bulls have already done the bulk of their core acquisitions. They have Markkanen, LaVine, Porter, Carter, who are all at or above the level of basically every player on the Hawks and Cavs right now, AND they still have plenty of room to grow.  &gt; but they basically have to become all-NBA and have Garpax win this draft to have this core as a championship contender  Not true at all. Drafting is not about finding every single player for your championship team, it's about building a core around which you can add talent. For example, you've ignored that the Bulls just added Otto Porter via trade. Porter is probably better than any player on the Hawks right now, and is still only 25 years old. If the Bulls young players keep getting better then they make themselves a target destination for future free agent talent as well.  It's much more realistic to build a solid foundation and top it off with a star player as the focal point, than it is to have your rebuild strategy rely on finding a Zion Williamson in the draft. Those guys just don't come along often. That's why Durant, LeBron, Steph, Davis etc are so sought after - those players are hard to find, you're better off tempting them to join you than banking on drafting the next one.  &gt; You basically have 3 guys + this years draft pick all of whom haven’t played a full season in a while. Look at how Philly just got 4 all-stars and is still questionable to make the finals with that roster.  You're listing 2 different concerns. The Bulls have had injury issues, the 76ers problems are about fit. Nothing indicates that Lauri, LaVine, WCJ, Porter or Dunn should miss significant future time due to any of their previous injuries, so that's a non-issue.  And while the Bulls players aren't as talented as the 76ers starting 5, they do at least fit together better. And Philly is several years further along in their rebuild, and they benefited from a combination of injuries and draft odds that combined to drop 4 consecutive top 3 draft picks into their lap. The Bulls didn't have the luxury of being the only tanking team in the league. Turning Jimmy Butler and Niko into Lauri, LaVine, Dunn, Hutchison, Carter and an upcoming top 5 pick is pretty decent.  &gt; Remember too that your FO is openly admitting they’re not a FA destination meaning they have to execute their rebuild perfectly because they can’t rely on a hero like Rose to come save the day.  Your time frame here is all messed up. The FO is realistic that they are not a free agent destination *in the next 1-2 years*, so they spent that cap space on a 2 year rental of Porter instead. Beyond that time frame the goal is absolutely to add a top free agent, but to do that, you have to have a good team. You think Kevin Durant is signing with Atlanta because they have Young, Collins and some future draft picks? No, you've got to build something first.  &gt; Also how can you guys always be saying Garpax is good at drafting then say mid-first picks have little value.  Why are you making an argument with me based on things you've heard *other* Chicago fans say? Mid-range picks absolutely have value, they can be *developed* into strong players, like the Bulls have done with Butler, Taj Gibson, Mirotic, Portis etc. But those guys were developed within a system surrounded by other talented players, they weren't just plucked from the draft and winning rookie of the year right away. Not every draft class has a Donovan Mitchell.  I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make here. You're clearly trying to take a dig at the Bulls FO, but you're actually making the point that mid-first picks have value *because of player development*, which was my entire point in the first place. You're not getting anybody with those picks that are plug and play stars right away.   &gt; If this were any other team tell me you’d believe in that rebuilding plan.  Actually, I have no problem with Atlanta's rebuilding plan. I think they're doing a fine job. What I have a problem with is you making broad, nonsense assumptions that the pieces the Bulls have assembled so far are somehow worse than what the Hawks or Cavs *MIGHT* have in the future, as if there is any kind of certainty with future picks. Player development is the key to a good rebuild. If Young and Collins don't get significantly better than they are now, the Hawks are going nowhere. Likewise, the expectation for Chicago is that Lauri, LaVine, Porter, WCJ and whoever they draft this year will not be at their peaks in 2019, but instead grow into a strong team over the next 2-3 years."

Kevin Durant and especially Anthony Davis were way more exciting prospects than this fat guy!
"Lebron James pushes the ball up the floor and Kevin Durant steps up to face him as  the clock winds down. The crowd is going wild with excitement. Lebron hesitates, then pulls up from 30 feet for the three. As the game clock expires, the ball hits nothing but net and the stadium explodes. Ball game. Warriors 132 - Lakers 114"
"Disclaimer, I was watching ""Blackhat"" with Chris Hemsworth and listening to Drake's ""Scorpion"" whilst writing the first half of this op-ed. I'm watching ""Training Day"" as I begin to write in the second half. What's up y'all, it's your boy Smoky the Based Frog coming at you live with them fiery takes, and today I want to share a little bit about myself with you all. Some of you might know who I am, most of you probably don't, but for those who do and to those who don't, around this community people know me for two things: a.) I'm a Miami Heat fan who believes the name in the front stands above the name in the back and b.) I can, at times, be a bit of a LeBron hater. Now, I know a lot of you have wondered, or are probably wondering, how can a Miami Heat fan also be a self-declared LeBron hater? While it was easy to get to this point, explaining how I got here can be quite complex. So let me begin by taking y'all back to where it all first started. In the summer of 2014, our Miami Heat faced a devastating loss to a San Antonio Spurs team that played with a truly never-before-seen level of efficiency. Didn't they fucking shoot like 90% for three quarters, or something like that, in one of the games? Anyways, yes we got beaten, yes we underperformed, yes we were tired and probably dehydrated for like at least a game, but nevertheless, we remained resilient. Pat Riley said it best in his post-game conference soon after our finals' loss: our team doesn't balk, our team doesn't walk out the door, our team doesn't quit on the game and leave to the locker room while there are still 15 seconds remaining in the game — even if we're ten points down, twenty points down, our team does not quit when faced against adversity. So all in all, you can say I (and probably the majority of Heat fans) were feeling pretty confident as we moved into the offseason and closer to free agency. I mean, I know I was quite confident, I talked a lot of shit here back then about how we were going to keep LeBron, after all, he did say earlier in the season that he couldn't see himself playing anywhere else but Miami. July 9, 2014, was the first moment of uncertainty for many of us Heat fans, that was the day that trucks were spotted outside of LeBron's home in Miami. On July 11, 2014, the ""I'm coming back to Cleveland"" article dropped in Sports Illustrated. Throughout that day, I kept basketball out of my life, if you needed me, you could call me but I stayed busy making money — you know what was on my mind, all I thought about were hundreds, I stayed busy (bzz) working on myself. Now, I gathered myself and picked myself up, and I was ready to support LeBron going back to Cleveland, I was all up in r/heat talking about how I didn't want to hear it, how we should support the man that brought us two rings. That was up until the rumors started coming out that he refused to talk to Pat Riley, that he didn't even communicate with Wade and/or Bosh, that he called a rumored verbally-committed Pau Gasol and warned him not to sign with us. Those were the seeds that planted in me a deep hatred for LeBron the player (because, to be honest, I'm cool with LeBron the person). This sent me on a five-year journey of hating LeBron, I said to myself, the self-titled ""King"" will rue the day he left Miami. Now, I know some of y'all will say ""but LeBron won you two rings"", and to those of you who say that, I say to you this: have you ever had your heart broken by another man? I know there are people here who can relate to me, who've had their star player leave in a less than unsavory way, didn't even tell any of his teammates, trashed their front office, etc... And I'm not going to name any names here, but at least OKC got a fucking ""thank you"" from Kevin Durant — we got a fucking ""team I formerly played with"" and ghosted for like four months. By the way, I'm at that part in ""Blackhat"" where that Asian chick saves Chris Hemsworth — BAGAWD CHRIS YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. This lady just pulled out that fucking med kit and got to work. I mean that's real efficiency right there. Anyways, the next five years had a lot of ups and downs. 2016 was a really rough time for anybody here that knows Draymond Green being suspended is probably the clearest example we've had in modern NBA history of the league fixing things up for a star player. I thought about quitting the game. I thought about all the work I had done in this subreddit in past years, the countless hours I had put here, making counter-arguments, consistently shutting down LeBron fans — but I told myself, this shit is chess, it ain't checkers. I remained persistent, I worked on my game, I studied Michael Jordan, his three more rings, his one more MVP, his three more Finals MVPs, nine more scoring titles, and DPOY award — learned that he basically has an entire hall of fame career above LeBron James. On February 26, 2019, all of my hard work finally paid off. LeBron is no longer consensus ""Best Player in the World"". I feel like the Bucks' win is a signal that it's ok for me to move on now. I look back at 2016, seeing how close I came to leaving it all behind... I see myself reflected in LeBron James last night, I was about to quit on the game while there were still 15 seconds left in it, but I didn't walk away into the locker room — I stayed on the court."
Kevin Durant shot under 30% on like 2 attempts in his rookie year. Players absolutely can develop a nice jumper.
Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard
"The headphones thing strikes me as the biggest barrier with NBA players.  They listen to these melodramatic depressing Drake songs about being lonely aggrieved celebrities who can't trust anybody. They interact with trolls, observe the fawning fans desperate for their attention, and take on this annoying weary attitude about the world like its all as circus-y and ""fake"" as the NBA bubble.   When I think of Kevin Durant, Kyrie, KAT, Kawhi, all these inscrutable players being standoffish or disconnected or prickish, I literally think of them in pregame camera shots walking from the bus to the locker rooms  wearing Beats By Dre and listening to Drake"
"I mean I think it’s absolutely bonkers how people have stretched basketball hate for Durant into the personal. I mean the fake twitter accounts were funny, but that’s about it. Really I feel bad for KD, he obviously has some issues with insecurity, and people just ignore his struggles as if they’re bullshit cause he’s “young, black and gifted (also rich)”. Kevin Durant is an admirable person. I think obviously Draymond does some dumb shit, but he’s a complex person. Or Chris Paul lol, this dude might be one of the nicest players off the court (charity work, character, and my personal experience). But people constantly paint him as rude, arrogant and “a shitty person”. I think people are unable to separate their personal feelings from the actual game. Like you don’t know these players as people! Giannis is a great guy, but soon enough the sub will turn on him. "

“How to Overcome Adversity” - #Kevin Durant
"I hear that and believe that other players experience it to a lesser degree. Much lesser. (I said much lesser, so deep breath before saying ""it's not the same"", bc I'm not saying it's the same.) It's really frustrating to see a player--on any team--but especially one on your team get unfairly treated by the mainstream. I felt that Zaza's close-out was not as malicious as it's been made out to be. I feel that Draymond gets pinned with the negative take on any action he could perform--whether it be talking or playing defense. And of course, Kevin Durant. I don't think he's been denied any awards or accolades, so again, I'm not saying it's the same level. However, this guy can't even donate to charity, open up schools, make a NEUTRAL statement to the media without being flooded with ""snek"", ""Fuck KD"", and ""every time he opens his mouth or does anything it's just worse and worse."" And it has stuck around for so long. You can't say his name without a consensus negative opinion before even seeing what he did/said.  Does that sound familiar? I've seen plenty of threads drowned in ""Freethrows!"", ""talented but for fucks sake stop flopping"", ""Go Giannis!"" (automatic reply to posts with Harden as title). Tell me that shit isn't infuriating.  It's contributed to the deterioration of dialogue. We can't even convince each other anymore. We just attack/defend, defend/attack. We're so bitter.  I'll be forthright and honest, I've made some crappy comments about Harden and am guilty of having fanned the flames. It was never out of logic or reason. It was spiteful and born of emotion. I don't speak for everyone--I'm exceptionally immature, lol. But, I'd wager similar feelings guide some comments on the other end. What is it you want? Recognition for Harden? Or fair dialogue for ALL players?  "
Lebron James and Kevin Durant 
"I don't know who will, but I know who could: Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant. These are all possibilities, and nothing is set in stone."
"lmao, says the Warriors fan  the game is absolutely fine when Kevin Durant can take two large steps way out of bounds right in front of the refs. "
"First and foremost, winning is a team accomplishment. Draymond Green is an all star with multiple rings, but in no ones book is he better than Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and the countless greats who never won on the NBA level.  Secondly, Lebrons 3 rings all came against his equals. Kevin Durant, Kawhi, and Greatest record Warriors. Jordan got two of 6 rings while being guarded by Jeff Hornacek, literally the ‘96 version of Kyle Korver. One against Dan Majerle the ‘93 version of Kyle Korver. Not once did Jordan face off 1v1 against a guy like Durant, Kawhi, or go into a series as the underdog against a team as dominant as the Warriors.   Jordan was in the league when wings were not dominant therefore all of his competition was either too small to guard him or too slow. 90’s NBA was focused more on PG - C combos. The best part for Jordan is the second best wing in the league was his teammate, Pippen. I love Jordan and his legacy, but the fact is, he was more ahead of his time than anything. He played in a league that didnt value his position until he played it pretty much. Without Jordan there would be no Lebron, but also because of Jordan, Lebron has way more competition in his era."
"Offense. Harden, Steph, Lebron are all miles ahead as play makers and passers, and better scorers as well. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant might be similar as a passer, but he's a far better scorer and no slouch defensively. "
"It’s gonna be so weird to see names like Larry Bird, Steve Nash, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and then Malcolm Brogdon."
Kevin Durant has been better for at least this season and last.
"West: Stephen Curry James Harden Kevin Durant LeBron James Anthony Davis  East: Kyrie Irving Kemba Walker Kawhi Leonard Giannis Antetokounmpo Joel Embiid  I dunno about you, but that does not sound fun at all."
"he ain't gotta pressure anybody, if he wants the full max, he'll ask for it and they'll give it to him  they not lowballing kevin durant come on"
"Yes, steph and LBJ are very similar in terms of leadership, presence, and a host of other factors. I see why you made that comparison. And since going to the GSW there has been no coverage debating who the most important piece on that team is. Especially not amount fans, who are very level headed and non emotional or biased. /s  We all joke about GMSteph, and how passive aggressive he can be, and how he needs to be the center of the offense and needs the ball in his hands. /s  Stephs team culture and LBJ team culture are very different things. To even compare the two is comical. On LBJ's team you are not going to be the #1 person as far as the media is concerned. That isn't true in GS. Hell, even Durant called the current Lakers culture toxic (https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2018/12/05/kevin-durant-thinks-a-toxic-media-environment-keeps-players-from-joining-lebron/38676583/). Hell, even DWade had to go from the Batman to a Robin roll when Lebron came to town. On a team that will would have retired his jersey had those 4 years never happened. I think Bosh explained it best, when you play with LBJ you dont get the full option of running your game the way a super star is used to.   Oh and FYI KD is 31 at the start of the 2019 season. so its not like he has a ton of roadway as lebron ages. And being 7 foot tall I would not be surprised if he starts breaking down in a few years (hopefully not).   "

"Yeah I'm not sure that's the problem so much as you may want an additional ""superstar"" category. Because there's a big difference between Kevin Durant and Clint Capela, but there's also a big difference between Capela and say...Al-Farouq Aminu (a solid starter). But then I suppose using MPG as your parameter does become a problem because the difference between a superstar and a star in that respect is not cut-and-dry and depends on a lot of other factors (team success, health, etc.)"
"Except KD is a slightly different context. If he does settle down, he’ll have experienced both: 1.) achieving life accomplishments and 2.) the love of a family. Whereas the male coworkers i talked about will only experience 2.) and not 1.)   The dissatisfaction of something you had high hopes not turning out to be all you thought it would be is different than the dissatisfaction of having to give up something that you really wanted.  And dont get me wrong, i didnt mean to imply that men as a group **have absolutely no desire to start a family**. Of course there are men who want to open their hearts to a bigger family. But its just different for like a LeBron James/Kevin Durant/etc *who already has an extremely rich life experience* and starting a family is *the only thing he doesnt have* versus a normal guy who starting a family is the only meaningful life experience he does have. Like if a guy who wanted to travel the world, party, bang a lot of women, start a small business, make a lot of money to enjoy a nice quality of life, become extremely good at some side hobby/passion like guitar or dancing or woodcarving, etc didnt get to do any of that, and then he started a family, you wouldnt feel like that all that life experience that he wanted but never got wouldnt weigh down heavily on his overall happiness?"

Do you need that for yourself?** &gt;  &gt; I don’t need anything in this basketball world to fulfill anything in me. The NBA is never going to fulfill me. It’s going to make me feel good about all of the work that I’ve put in, but I think those days of me wanting to prove something to anybody or walk around with a huge chip on my shoulder is not my thing. &gt;  &gt; It wasn't before, and I felt like I had to program myself to play with a chip on my shoulder, but I’m never good in that situation. I’m more relaxed and letting these days flow. I’m the best version of me. &gt;  &gt; I don’t feel like I need anything like that to prove who I am. I’ve been in it for too long. &gt;  &gt; **I like that you said, ‘The NBA will never fulfill me.’ That’s really powerful. What are the things that fulfill you?** &gt;  &gt; Being around family. Being around friends. The people who actually love you deep down to your core, who won’t judge you, who will let you grow mentally, physically, you know? Just let you be who you are. I like those environments. &gt;  &gt; I love to continue to push the limits on who I am as a person. Just the flow of life and the type of people I want to be around, the environment I want to live in. &gt;  &gt; All that stuff will fulfill me more so than anything … just building toward something that’s sustained when I’m not even here on this earth. My family could be straight when I die. That’s the type of stuff I tend to think about. &gt;  &gt; I know the NBA helped me get there, but I’m not going to be forever indebted to the NBA because this is a 50-50 exchange. I’ve worked hard to get here, to be at this level, and they gave me a platform to showcase what I can do. We both helped each other out. That’s how I look at it."

"He’s Kevin Durant. It’s not a fringe max player. All the leverage he has shows in his game tape. He’s getting max money if he wants it regardless. If the team fucks it up by not offering it, he can go elsewhere. Him saying he wants to stay wouldn’t affect that. If he truly wanted to stay he’s say it, and he hasn’t. "

"I don’t oarticulaely care about the Doncic/gobert debate, that’s not really what I’m arguing.  I’m arguing that gobert isn’t that great of a player. Most of his weight is his defense, and some consider him to be the best defensive player in the league. His defense suffers in the playoffs massively. And this statement does not apply to anyone. Just go back to the WCF last, Capella is one of the best perimeter defending bigs in the league and while he still gets scored on he was doing as good a job as you can ask on kd/Klay/Steph.  Embiid is also a better perimeter defender then gobert, also Anthony Davis is a very good one. There’s many players besides Giannis who can guard multiple positions. Kevin Durant is another example "

"Way back in 2013, a ""beef"" began between Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade and then-Oklahoma City star, and current Golden State Warrior, Kevin Durant.     It was due to a Kevin Durant comment in which he said that Wade, who was ranked No. 8 in ESPN's top 10 NBA players, should have been replaced by his teammate James Harden in that spot.     Wade fired back on Instagram, which caught the attention of sports media."
steph curry is better than kevin durant  bron is the best player in the league. 
Lebron scoring 30 against the Warriors isn't a shock. That is what the best scorers in the game do.  Kevin Durant averages 30 against the Spurs in the playoffs which is one of the greatest defensive teams of all time.  
"These aren't my predictions just what I would want to happen that aren't completely unreasonable.  Knicks: Kevin Durant  Lakers: DeMarcus Cousins  Suns: Kemba Walker and Jimmy Butler  Celtics: Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis  Clippers: Kawhi Leonard and Nikola Vucevic  Raptors: Keep Marc Gasol  Kings: Klay Thompson  Mavericks: Keep Porzingis"
Isiah Thomas  Jerry West  Kevin Durant  Karl Malone   Moses Malone
Surprised more people don't agree with you. Kevin Durant could absolutely average 36 if he shot 15-18 3s a game. Probably some other players too.
"You have god given athleticism and you’re on reddit? What’re you, Kevin Durant?"
Kevin Wayne Durant 
How do you leave Kevin Durant off of this lmao
"Assuming NBA players are allowed to play, lets take a look at the team. Im not sure how many players are on an olympic squad so we will just take the top 15 vs how ever many anyone wants.   In no specific order: Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday (homer pick), Damien Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Al Horford....you know what, 3 more players might be overkill. "
"Because Giannis has been as good as he is this season for exactly one season.  Kevin Durant has been this good for the vast majority of his career thus far.  Need to do it for longer than that to hop over someone as established as Durant.  For what it's worth no one is suggesting that Durant is playing better than Giannis THIS SEASON, but overall it is still reasonable to say he's better because of the consistency."
"The addition of Kevin Durant and Kyrie alone would produce an additional 25-30 wins for the Knicks. With the addition of Zion and some vets looking to play for a contender, the Knicks would probably win around 45-50 wins and stand 2nd/3rd in the East. "
It was a poorly written and pointless article.  The gist of it was 'Kevin Durant is probably going to leave to New York and he's passively aggressive or quiet when asked about it.  He should stop being a bitch.'  KD's feelings were hurt; he reacted poorly.  No one wins in this scenario.
Kevin Durant beat Kyrie Irivng Kevin Love and LeBron James
"??  Kevin Durant in 2016 per 100:   39 points, 11.3 rebounds, 7 assists on 50/38.7/89.8  Paul George in 2019 per 100:  36.2 points, 10 rebounds, 5.4 assists on 44.8/39.8/84.4  And this is comparing Paul George's best season with just the last season KD played in OKC which was just a run of the mill season for him.  "
Oroboro: The Life and Legacy of Kevin Durant
KD too. If you wouldn’t welcome Kevin Durant to your team you’re crazy.
The Kevin Durant dream. 
"This is kind of cherrypicked though... like someone else said LeBron is a 1 foot jumper, as well as Kevin Durant, Giannis, Harden... also D rose used to go off two just as much as he went up off one. "
So he would kinda be like Kevin Durant in a sense
no bc then he's kevin durant 
"Give Kyrie Dame's teammates facing that defense, he would've 100 percent gotten shut down. If your teammates aren't making themselves threats, the type of doubling/trapping a guard defense like that can do is not something you can just dribble through consistently.  That's why Kevin Durant called it ""gimmicky"", there's not really an answer to a defense like that if your team can't get their own shots off. "
"Giannis was nowhere near a star in his first season. He was a project that developed nicely over three seasons. So, yeah, Giannis is a monster now, but it took him a few years to get there (and he still can't shoot!). On the other hand, Luka is already recognized as one of the best players in the league. He has the potential to achieve what Giannis has accomplished in a shorter time. Obviously they have different body types and skills, but Luka is looking impressive.  I sort of think of Luka the way I think of Kevin Durant. When he came into the league, everybody thought he would be great. Obviously his first season he didn't have a good enough team so that Seattle team went nowhere. But once the Thunder put nice pieces to go along Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Ibaka, etc., that team went to Conference Finals. So, if the Mavs put good players to go along Luka, like Porzingis, I can imagine the Mavs making noise within two years."
"Kevin Durant. I think his jumper so nice to watch, mainly cause I can't shoot for shit"
Kevin Durant when he is in a roll is incredible to watch. Obviously liked it better when he was on OKC but can’t deny how great his offensive game is
&gt;Kevin Durant -  &gt;Heave: None made  No fucking surprise there
By selfish you mean not playing next to Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson 
"Ray Allen, Rashard Lewis, Kevin Durant, Marshawn Lynch and Bloodbourne"
Dwade 5/8 from 3.  Steph Curry 4/14 from 3.  Kevin Durant 3/17 from 3.
Kevin Durant is the best player in the world.
"Objectively speaking, Kevin Durant is the best overall player in the NBA. Shoot, defend, rebound, pass, clutch, dribble, drive, you name it.  LeBron is just dubbed better because of his current legacy.  I'd put Giannis and Kawhi into the conversation as well. They're both monsters defensively, Kawhi has a better jumper and probably a tad bit better defensively but Giannis even with his limited shooting is almost unguardable and a better rebounder, higher engine as well.  "
"There's no nightlife in Utah,"" Matt Barnes explained, per Chris Haynes of ESPN.com. ""Obviously as players, you want to be able to have a little bit of a nightlife, but the main focus is winning games. Me personally, I want to get out there because I want to beat the Clippers. That's my former team, and my kids are out there. But as far as nightlife, there's no comparison to nightlife in Utah and L.A.""  ""The problem with Utah is that you're just sitting there and your mind is like dead, because in L.A., you still got energy for the game,"" Andre Iguodala said. ""Because you're in L.A., you're like, 'Man, this is just the vibe in L.A.' but in Utah, it can kind of lull you to sleep.""  Kevin Durant added that he has never been to a club in Utah."
I actually hated him lol. For many reasons. I think he’s pretty overrated - maybe he would have been better in the 90s or something when no one cares about efficiency or shooting threes.   I just don’t understand how anyone could say that Melo was the best scorer in the league when Kevin Durant was already in the league and has like 4 scoring titles ? Melo’s only won the scoring title once and he barely won. I’m honestly convinced Durant let him win it because he felt bad getting a 5th one while Melo wouldn’t even have one. 
"Well now this is awkward:  https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/04/here-are-top-jersey-sales-nba-season  &gt; Curry led the NBA in jersey sales the previous two seasons. And he's done it again this year, topping jersey sales among all players in the league.  &gt; He beat out LeBron James (No. 2), teammate **Kevin Durant (3)**, Giannis Antetokounmpo (4), and Kyrie Irving (5)."
kevin durant was suspiciously present for both of these
Fuck Kevin Durant
kevin durant and clutch 3's ... doesn't matter how badly he's shooting he delivers
"Look, this thread should be for Bucks fans, Kings fans and basketball fans.  I like shit-talk as much as the next guy, so I'll just say it.  Whether or not you sign Kevin Durant, your team is still owned by Dolan."
I like Kevin Durant
I bet guarding Kevin Durant is difficult.   I know i couldn't do it. 
"Modric won the Balon D’Or and was the player of the tournament at the World Cup as well as winning the Champions league. His nomination was because of his accolades. You’re correct that Lebron had a standout post season, but James Harden and Kevin Durant had more accomplishments throughout the year. Being the #1 player in the world didn’t make the difference, championships did. Djokovic was ranked low due to his injury and clawed back to the top by winning championships. Had Nadal or Federer won over Djokovic, they would have won this award, even if Djokovic made the Grand Slam finals. To your 3rd point, yes Steph had one of the best seasons ever, but his team also went 73-9. Lebron’s poor supporting cast on the Cavs only took the 4th seed and had a miracle run to the finals. I’d still take KD or Hardens seasons over Lebron’s last season even though it was incredible in its own right. "
We are going to sign Kevin Durant next year and eliminate you guys from the playoffs 
Wow Kevin Durant really sucks at defense...
"He played good defense. Not great but good. Also, he averaged 11 assists per game. People forget that he was in contention for an all-defense team that year.

Those are some pretty great defenders on this list.  The only players that got more votes than him and that didn't make the list were Rudy Gobert, Utah, 64 (17); Klay Thompson, Golden State, 49 (16); Jae Crowder, Boston, 47 (3); LeBron James, Cleveland, 43 (5); Kyle Lowry, Toronto, 43 (9); Danny Green, San Antonio, 39 (9).  I'm comparing Lonzo and Westbrook. I'm merely saying that you'd switch sides the second we're talking about Lonzo. Your stance on the topic would immediately fall in line with mine."

Then Kevin Durant makes one the most bitch made moves in the history of the league and joins that very team that came back 3-1 to beat him only 1 month later. 
"Here you go. I'd really recommend subscribing though, it was less than $50 for the year and they have good articles almost everday.  HOUSTON​ —​ Trae Young’s​ perspective​ on basketball changed in one night​ in​ November 2016. As with​ almost every Oklahoma City​ Thunder home​​ game since the team’s relocation from Seattle, Young and his father, Ray, were sitting in Section 121, Row X, Seats 3-4. Chris Paul and the Los Angeles Clippers had come to town, which meant another opportunity for Trae to meet one of his favorite players in the league.  Young was a senior at Norman North High School and one of the top recruits in the country. He had first met Paul when he was 7 years old during Paul’s rookie year, 2005-06, when the New Orleans Hornets had temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City because of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation.  But it was that night during Young’s senior year of high school, as the two talked inside the tunnel of Chesapeake Energy Arena, that Paul made his biggest impression on the young player.  Paul challenged Young to discover his intrinsic motivation for playing the game. Was it because he wanted fame or fortune? Was it because he wanted to provide for his family? Paul told Young that once he found the reason, his sense of motivation would transform.  For Young, the answer rested with his grandfather, to whom he was close before the older man passed away. His grandfather always told Trae that he was going to make it to the NBA one day. Shortly after that conversation with Paul, Trae went to his grandfather’s grave and placed a bracelet on the tombstone. Engraved on the bracelet was this phrase: “What is your why?”  “Ever since then, I started carrying myself differently and started thinking about the game differently,” Young said. “I realized that night that I don’t play for myself. I play for others.”  The relationship between Young and Paul has grown so strong over the years that the Hawks rookie point guard still turns to the Rockets superstar for advice. In high school, he would text and call Paul for tips on how he should handle his recruitment. During his year at Oklahoma, he would ask Paul how he should handle the overwhelming fame brought his way and the constant dissection of every play by fans and media around the country. Now that Young is in the NBA, it’s Paul who has told him that the fandom he held for Paul, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had to stop. It’s fine to recognize and respect their games, but it shouldn’t go further than that, Paul told him.   Chris Paul, left, has shared lessons learned with Trae Young. (Courtesy of Ray Young) That hasn’t been an issue for Young during his rookie season. He’s always had that mindset, and it’s something he’s picked up from Paul and Westbrook when he was growing up in Oklahoma and going to Hornets and Thunder games.  “Whenever I play against you, we’re not friends anymore. We’re enemies,” Young said. “We’re competing against each other, and that’s how I look at it. We could be friends and talk afterwards, but once we’re on the court, none of that matters to me. I only care about winning and taking care of business.”  Young dropped a career-high 36 points and eight 3-pointers Monday night against Paul and the Rockets. A few hours before the game, his father reminded him not to get caught up in the moment of playing against one of his mentors, that Paul is the type of player who might throw an elbow in your chest and try to get into your head. The only time Young lets the realization of going up against his idols get to him is during warm-ups. Young said he looks across the court before games and soaks up the moment. After introductions, however, the feelings of awe are over.  After the Rockets beat the Hawks on Monday night, Houston head coach Mike D’Antoni went up to Paul and said, “Man, he can play.” Paul laughed and said, “Yeah, I already knew that.” Young has been to several of Paul’s camps through the years, and the Houston guard knew Young was going to be a problem when he got to the league.  “I knew that right away because he’s ultra-competitive,” Paul told The Athletic. “He’s fun to watch because he’s so skilled. I think that’s what people may miss when watching him. His handles, man. He can come off a ball screen, and he can stop and whip it to the other side of the court with his left hand.  “It ain’t maybe four or five guys in the entire NBA that can do that, and he does it efficiently. He’s only going to get better and better.”   Embedded video  Jackson Frank @jackfrank_jjf  This left-handed bullet from Trae Young is nutty  517 1:29 AM - Feb 26, 2019 86 people are talking about this Twitter Ads info and privacy Paul watches games around the league every night. He has watched several Hawks games because of his relationship with Young, as well as with John Collins, who shares a bond because both went to Wake Forest, and head coach Lloyd Pierce. Before the game, Paul went over to the Hawks’ bench and dapped Pierce up. After the game, Paul hugged Young and told him to keep going and stay patient.  Paul said the reason he takes pride in mentoring Young is because of the rookie’s desire to continually get better and because Young makes it a point to stay in touch. Paul said some players ask for advice, and that’s it. Even now, when Young sees Paul have a good night on the floor, he’ll send quick “good game, bro” texts. Even for someone of Paul’s stature, that means something.  “Even now, when I’m watching games, I keep in touch with him,” Paul said. “If someone keeps in touch with you, you’re going to want to keep in touch with them. I’m always willing to help someone who wants the help.”  Paul has heard the criticism about Young’s game since the rookie was in high school and playing AAU basketball, which Paul is heavily involved in. Young has always felt like he had something to prove because of his height. Watching Paul in person during his rookie year gave Young the confidence that a small point guard could make it in the NBA. Paul still counsels Young to use those doubts as fuel.  “You hear some of the visiting commentators talk about the deep threes he takes when they don’t go in, and they’ll be like, ‘Oh, who does he think he is? Why is he pulling up from that deep?'” Paul said. “He’s been doing that since he’s been playing AAU. He’s more than capable of making those shots. When he was in college, I told him that the NBA is going to be easier than college because the court is so open. When he can handle the ball like that, he’s a handful.  “I couldn’t shoot it like that when I came into the league — hell, I still can’t shoot like that right now. I used to talk to him all of the time about defense because when you’re a young guy in this league, one of the biggest things you have to do is learn how to defend. Once he keeps working on that, he’s going to be fine.”   Trae Young, second from right, worked out with Chris Paul, right, and James Harden, left, this past summer. (Courtesy of Ray Young) Seven hours before Young’s stellar night against Paul and the Rockets, he sat on one of the courtside chairs inside the Toyota Center and talked about his bond with Paul and what he has learned from the Houston guard through the years. He talked about the alpha mentality the two share, the belief that he is better than the point guard he’s going up against that night.  He also talked about the Rookie of the Year race with Luka Doncic, the player he’ll forever be linked to because of the draft-night trade between Atlanta and Dallas. Young smiled when asked about the consensus from the media that the race is already over and the award is essentially waiting for Doncic. Young proceeded to have his best game of the season on the same night Doncic finished with a triple-double against Paul’s former team, the Clippers.  “I don’t think the race is over,” Young said. “At the same time, that’s not really my main focus. But I don’t think the Rookie of the Year race is over just yet. You see guys come out all of the time super hot and get all of the hype and deservedly so. Luka has had a terrific year so far. But there’s been multiple times where there’s been co-winners, or it’s been flipped at the end just like last year with Donovan (Mitchell) and Ben (Simmons).”  Even if Young doesn’t win the award, Paul believes he is going to have a long career in the league because of his work ethic and his success in the pick-and-roll game. Paul said the pick-and-roll is “what the NBA is about, for the most part,” and Young’s court vision and the ability to make something happen every time he’s on the offensive end of the floor separate him from many players around the league. The court is just more open for guards who can handle the ball the way Young does.  As for Young, he’s going to continue to ask Paul for advice whenever he can because he’s reminded every time they talk that an undersized point guard can excel in the league.  “He saw this short point guard from Wake Forest out on the floor doing work,” said Young’s father, Ray. “You have to be able to believe that you can do it, too. I can preach to him until I’m blue in the face that he’s good enough and can make it, but until you see it like Trae saw it with Chris, that’s when he really believed it could happen for him, too.”  Said Young: “The way Chris carries himself, the way he gives back and the way he is with younger players is the same way I want to be when I get older.”"

"The frolicsome and energetic young Giannis advanced on to the NBA Finals, where he prepared to go into battle with the iniquitous, monstrous, and downright execrable Golden State Warriors. The gallant Greek Hero gave his people much hope, but David only fought one Goliath, not a quintet of Titans. The warrior King Leonidas had greater odds in the Battle of Thermopylae. Yet still, with but a smattering of seconds remaining in the final quarter, the indomitable Giannis advanced onward, pushing the ball up court, like his Spartan ancestors charging into a wall of Persian Immortals. David plunged into the abyss of Titans at midcourt, dissipating into a parapet of limbs. The fans of Firserv looked on, dismayed at the sight of their tragic warrior seemingly succumbing at last to the insurmountable odds placed before him. Dejected, the began to file out of the arena, one by one. Alas, a glimmer of hope, a lone interminable limb, outstretched through the bastion of bodies that had swallowed it whole moments ago. The fans hearts swelled with hope as they looked on in awe. The Greek Hero reached and stretched, and as the seconds on the clock neared none, the Brobdingnagian palm of Giannis reached onwards and upwards, towering above the rim before it thundered back down with the strength of Achilles. The buzzer sounded and the arena exploded with raucous celebration from the Fiserv faithful. Giannis had done it, seemingly stomping on the titans before him. Draymond Green looked back in awe and disbelief at the truth that had just befell him. Kevin Durant furiously pulled out his phone to check to see what his enemies were now saying about him on social media. Steph Curry face flushed in envy, the boyish smirk it usually wore gone, as he imagined what it would feel like to do that in a game. Demarcus Cousins huffed and puffed, exhausted and out of breath. And Klay Thompson celebrated with a simple smile and small fist pump as he ran off the court. The Warriors had done it again, defeating the Bucks in Game Four of the NBA Finals 134-102, winning their third straight NBA Championship. "

The Warriors had done it again, defeating the Bucks in Game Four of the NBA Finals 134-102, winning their third straight NBA Championship."
That's Space Jam 3 with Kevin Durant
"Is he 7ft Monster who can shoot threes from 30 , post up and defend like Kevin Durant ?"
 THE BLAZERS TOOK GREG ODEN INSTEAD OF KEVIN DURANT 😂
Bucks fans going crazy this year. Saying your star who couldn't beat the Kyrie-less Celtics will equalize 2 time Finals MVP Kevin Durant in the playoffs.
"Show me a team that won a title with a superstar that was attracted to a young core.  If we look at the last 20 years the only players you can possibly be referring to are Lebron James and Kevin Durant.  So in order to bring in a superstar player that can lead you to a title, all you have to do is have the player be born near your city and hope that player has an unnatural desire to bring said city a championship OR have a team that's already the best team in history, and hope that the superstar you don't really need, will help you beat teams by 20 instead of 15.  You have no examples of this.  Because it doesn't exist. Older teams win rings, not young one.  The irony is, you asked me to look back, when it's obvious that you haven't."
"Steph Curry or Kevin Durant would be even better, simply because of shooting. "
No it's okay. Like I said it's okay to have one...there's nothing wrong with that.   Kevin Durant is the greatest shooter of all time because of the shots he hit in 2017 and 2018. Steve Kerr is maybe second and Michael Jordan is 3rd. 
I mean Kevin Durant is better than Lebron purely because Lebron doesnt play defense... sooo....
"Not joking i was in Houston last night at the Harold’s right by Wicker Park. Suddenly this expensive car shows up and parks out front, the driver gets out opens up the passenger door and out comes Kevin Durant. He comes in, greets all the staff and i assume he’s coming to pick up his food.  To me and my friends surprise he puts on a greasy white T and goes to the back. It appears he’s about to start frying food but at that point we had to leave. I wanted to ask what he was doing there so bad but didnt know how to do it without sounding demeaning as fuck, so now ill forever be left with this doubt"
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook

The crazy thing is he does this every night. Our last game Kevin Durant posted up on him and then face up on him and Mikal just striped him clean on the turn.
they just beat the rockets without kevin durant.   ...
ask Kevin Durant
"Did you know that Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden used to be on the same team?"
"Nothing the warriors do is impressive. It was when it was just Steph, Klay, and Draymond. Kevin Durant made it a joke. Even though he didn't play last night, they have another all star who picked up his scoring slack.   That team could literally win with me playing for 10 minutes every night..I'm 5'9 and can't shoot or jump."
"Ohhhhhh... I think I get what you're saying.    The Warriors can OFFER him a max yes, but he CAN NOT be traded and sign a max.    A sign and trade is when a player Opt-In to their player option (Kevin Durant has a $31,500,000 player option for next season.) under the condition that they will be traded. So Kevin would be taking a pay cut from what he could be making in 19-20 ($37,800,000) to be traded to a team without cap space for him. He would also have to wait until 2020 to sign a max contract, which risks him getting injured and losing that max.   Hopefully that makes sense.  "
people are acting like giannis' supporting cast is good enough to the point where it should cancel out his MVP voting like we're in a steph curry and kevin durant situation yet most people doubt we can reach the ECF because they can't trust middleton or bledsoe as the second options lol
Yeah the warriors sure overcame a lot of adversity when they lost their starting small forward and only managed to replace him with Kevin Durant 
Correct. Kevin Durant has yet again become the mostly highly sought after free agent and the quote unquote savior to the The King's legacy during his twilight years. 
"Aw man, hate to break it to you again but Harden leads the league in drives  and has more shot attempts in the paint per game than BG. For every attempt that ends in a ""flop"" as you say, he has five attempts where he drives hard and is legitimately fouled. I know it's hard to know that since you just get your basketball takes from watching twitter and reddit clips but try watching a game every once in a while.   Btw, he picked up his foul drawing techniques on the perimeter from Steph Curry (falling when someone gets in your landing zone) and Kevin Durant (the rip-through) so if anything you should blame them. Good night nephew :) "
1.James Harden • HOU 709  2.Giannis Antetokounmpo • MIL 579 3.Joel Embiid • PHI 565 4.Blake Griffin • DET 477 5.Kevin Durant • GSW 464  Top 5 players who attempted free throw this year. Who are talking about btw ??? 
"IMO it's such a strange argument to say that the Rockets are the toughest because they came within a rebound and 3-pointer of winning this game.  You could very well say that the Warriors came within two wide open missed 3's of blowing this game completely out of reach.  Or, you know, that GSW was missing KEVIN DURANT.  "
also imagine how good you'd be if you had James Harden and Kevin Durant!
"[Spears] Steph Curry yelled, “There you go!” Draymond Green gave a neigh of surprise. Klay Thompson mumbled, “Let's smoke a fucking blunt now” And before DeMarcus Cousins could hit the locker room door, rare python snake Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Warriors don't need Kevin Durant!
Kevin Durant was playing 
Kevin Durant came and took away about half of Greens opportunities 
Is Kevin Durant holding the Warriors back?????
"I don't necessarily mean the constant access type things, ya that stuff can be weird.   More when players don't get why fans care if they are going to stay or go from their team type of thing. Kevin Durant seemed legitimately shocked that OKC fans were upset that he left them."
"Kevin Durant making four (virtually uncontested) shots against scrubs is probably something he, any many other elite shooters, can do consistently.  It's important to remember how good these guys are at shooting a basketball when there's no NBA defender in front of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A2-IczVWS8"
Like Kevin Durant 
*Kyrie and Kevin Durant have exited the chat*
"&gt;, then there are people who upvoted both  Not necessarily.  It just means a certain segment is upvoting a certain comment and another segment is upvoting a certain comment.  If you're in a thread about a Warriors player having a good night, you can be certain that there will be more warriors fans in that particular thread.  (Same is true for any team.) So you'll probably see comments upvoted in a different way than if the thread was about Kevin Durant harassing 9 year olds on twitter, in which case a lot of people who hate the warriors are going to be upvoting and posting, while a warriros fans may not even click on the thread in the first place.  The idea that people are changing their opinion 180 degrees based on the day, may happen sometimes, but ti's far more likely that the topic of the thread is drawing in a different demographic and they're up/down voting accordingly."
Believe it or not Kevin Durant wanted to play for the Raptors growing up. Not saying it’s gonna happen but the idea isn’t totally out of left field  [Durant: I wanted to play for the Raptors](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/)
"""I need a Kevin Durant presence"" - Draymond Green"
kevin durant isn’t playing  this less than even a semi statement game
"Let's not be revisionist with them in 2015. They weren't invincible until the Cavs were without Kyrie and Kevin Love. And there was still talk that the Clippers were going to be better than them in a series until they lost to the Rockets.  The only time this team looked truly invincible was all of 2016 until the Thunder series, and then like game 2 or 3 of the finals. And then again for all of 2017 because of Kevin Durant. This season is only different in that you're seeing actual slumps with Klay, disinterest in playing defense in KD, whatever happened to Draymond, and this is like the first time it looks like Iggy can't play as many hard minutes which I expect will be different in the playoffs."
Until it leads to your team losing Kevin Durant.
It really depends what Kevin Durant does . He’s going be the major FA who shifts everything  I hope we land Kemba or Kyrie Those are most likely 40% . Kawhi will stay. He’s on stable team in easy conference . 
"&gt; KD does not need to be surrounded by a ton of great shooters to make the playoffs.  ...James Harden? Steph Curry? Klay Thompson? These guys aren't great shooters?  &gt; Harden does not need to be surrounded by a ton of great shooters to make the playoffs.  Kevin Durant? Chris Paul? Eric Gordon? PJ Tucker? These guys aren't good shooters? The entire Rockets roster is literally built around 3s and layups and you are trying to say they don't have great shooters? Like what?  And let's not forget that KD had two hall of Fame players with him on the Thunder in Harder and Westbrook. Both of who will easily go down among the top 10 at their respective positions when all is said and done.   Harden had Chris Paul, who is arguably a top 5 PG all time, with him on thew Rockets. On the Thunder he was playing with one of the best pure scorers in the history of the NBA and Westbrook.   Please tell me what teammates does LeBron have on the Lakers that even come close to the likes of those? "
Yeah but at least half of those are Kevin Durant
"&gt;Either way, it’s an odd situation especially when you consider superstar players like Kevin Durant, Boogie, Russell Westbrook and others literally scream bad words at refs with no consequence.   There is definitely a different standard for star players. It makes sense since people come to see those player play, but it's still unfair to average players. If this was Lebron or Durant there would be a much bigger outrage.  I recall reading somewhere (don't remember the source) that Iverson once literary screamed ""Fuck you!"" at a ref AFTER receiving a tech and stared him down, like he was darning the ref ti throw him out. And the ref didn't."
"Americans have to be the most retarded human beings on Earth and that's why ESPN creates these lists promoting their athletes.  So let's see.  Kevin Durant is number 11  Search Score: 9  Endorsements: $32 million  Social Following: 37.9 million  Paul Pogba is number 12  Search Score: 15 (more than Durant)  Endorsements: $32 million (the same as Durant)  Social Following: 44.1 million (more than Durant)  This is just a list to make Americans believe that their sports and athletes are relevant when in fact no one gives a fuck about them.  Of course, Lebron ahead of Neymar and Messi is absurd."
"The 50/40/90 club is almost the Steve Club. Nash, Kerr, and Steph gets waived in under the ""close enough"" rule.  Plus Kevin ""Honorary Steve"" Durant."
[I think it's more about expanding] (http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25951825/golden-state-warriors-star-kevin-durant-focused-building-future-basketball) than just moving.
"Well, I was actually in attendance at this game tonight! Crazy stuff.   I can tell you, without a doubt, 100%, I have absolutely no idea what happened here. Every single person in the stadium was confused and literally had no idea what was going on.   It only makes sense that the ref either made a mistake, or there were words exchanged that we can’t see on video. Either way, it’s an odd situation especially when you consider superstar players like Kevin Durant, Boogie, Russell Westbrook and others literally scream bad words at refs with no consequence.   Anyways, that’s my 2 cents. Go Lakers "
"People talk about LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and others but they forget about Moussa Marega."
"New york, KD wants fans. We’ve seen him be “soft” in terms of hate he takes from teammates/fans, going to new york gives him literally millions of fans salivating for an all star, max money, and a great city for some of his companies to root in.  Overall is it the best move for his career? That could be determined by how many big names he attracts, I personally cannot see kyrie/kemba going to new york but could realistically see a jimmy butler or a donnavan mitchell a few years down the line. Its the best move for Kevin Durant the man."
"If I were Kevin Durant, I would sign with the Dallas Mavericks. As I am not Kevin Durant, I think a move to the New York Knicks would potentially help his legacy the most."
How is it not racist when kevin Durant says (blog)boi ??
Where is Kevin Durant? He's their best max candidate tbh. Surprised that's left off. Otherwise great piece
"How, Kd, we’re talking about the same person right? Kevin Durant? Like the star player that everybody gives a lot of credit to for contributing to the warriors being good?"
"Kevin Durant complained about reporters asking questions where no matter the answer they could twist it, or asking irrelevant questions that don't have any benefit other than getting readers for those reporters   I'd hate being asked questions too"
Kevin Durant..?
Kevin Durant 
"Changed it to how it should be:  ## [Lowe]  In late June 2016, just days after winning one of the luckiest NBA Finals in history, which was more about the Warriors giving it up than LeWhine winning, David Griffin, then  the Cleveland Cavaliers' GM, gathered his staff and gave them a  directive: Explore ways to get Kevin Durant."
"[After Green and Taylor exchanged words, security had to calm both down. Green said Taylor called Durant the “p-word” as well a “little boy.”](https://theundefeated.com/features/oklahoma-city-thunder-kevin-durant/)"
Isn't Kevin Durant a free agent as well?
Stop it. Dr J won two titles for the Nets in the ABA. He's a top 10 all time basketball great. If Kevin Durant came here and won a ring that doesn't put him above Erving or even necessarily Kidd. 
You mean the same Kevin Durant who characterizes the environment playing with LeBron as being toxic?
&gt;  Kevin Durant is shooting 103% of his shots from the left side of the court inside the 3pt line?  C'mon man you know that made no sense. 
Do people care about Kevin Durant as a person? I can't see this doing too well 
Am I interpreting this right? Kevin Durant is shooting 103% of his shots from the left side of the court inside the 3pt line?
"Doesn't matter, that's Kevin Durant"
"IIRC a lot of old school journalists and main TV stations are in LA and New York.   Thier huge market and their history also make it so a lot of fans will want both the wins and perfect play.   So this results with unreal expectations from the media and their last game + comments/ beat reporting tweet following them everywhere they will go in days they lose and being expected to carry the team no mater how bad everything else is working.  And since Kyrie is too lose with in his interviews and Kevin is too stuck up. This would make for Lakers-like drama.   Also, so far, none of these 2 have shown their Leadership which is crucial to survive this pressure.  Durant never asked for Brooks to be fired or put pressure on Presti, he just left when he there was no strings attached.   Kyrie would have never been in a position to challenge LeBron and he forced CLE to trade him by going to get a surgery he was going to get anyway..  The only thing that goes in their favor is their will to have their own legacy out of James and Curry's popularity."
This is Kevin Durant we're talking about. The guy who cared enough to make burner accounts on twitter.
"What's the worst NBA take you've seen from a specific website/app? These are what I've seen:  - Facebook: Walt Frazier and Kevin Garnett &gt; LeBron James in the GOAT rankings.  - Twitter: James Harden is ""far better"" than Dwayne Wade ever was.  - r/NBA discord: Kevin Durant&gt;LeBron James in the GOAT rankings.  - YouTube: ""Kobe is far greater than Kareem."""

What's the worst NBA take you've seen from a specific website/app? These are what I've got.  - Facebook: Walt Frazier and Kevin Garnett &gt; LeBron James  - Twitter: James Harden was far better than Dwayne Wade ever was.  - r/NBA discord: Kevin Durant&gt;LeBron James GOAT rank wise.
Just Steph Curry Or Kevin Durant might have been enough for a championship team once upon a time but it really seems like the level of competition has increased significantly in recent years.  Last year besides the 3 initial games which were blowouts(for both warriors and rockets) the games to end the series were really close.  Iggy and Paul would both have been able to slightly influence the game and make the result potentially different.
You have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Just one of those two is enough for a championship team and you blame the loss to Iggy's injury?
"The West keeps winning the lottery in loaded draft classes  Kevin Durant  Westbrook, Love   Blake, Harden, Curry  AD, Dame   Ayton, Bagley, Doncic, JJJ  It’s ridiculous the amount of talent the West teams keep drafting. "
"He thinks he is slick, he wants people to think he is the difference maker, he didn't want the Durant look. He went to a decent heat team but took Bosh to make them a powerhouse. He went to a up and coming Cavs team but knew they were in place to bring in a all star Kevin love. He came here to LA with his agency knowing AD was going to make a play for LA and LA had the prices to get AD and still have cap space for a stud free agent. Legler and one of the LA times radio were just talking about it on the morning show on our local station the other day and both said LeBron was confident that AD was going to be on the Lakers this year"
so in 8 years kevin durant will officially be the goat scorer
"Let me start with the obvious: Kobe Bryant is a better defender than Kevin Durant.  But yes, a shit ton of those all defense selections were unearned."
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Bradley Beal   Small Forward: Kevin Durant   Power Forward: Giannis  C: Jokic
"Dolan is making the best sales pitch to Kevin Durant. Who hates fans talking shit and the media more than KD? Probably Dolan. I bet Durant sees this and says “Hell yeah Dolan!” Same with Kyrie, if they have problems with anyone Dolan will handle it. Dolan may look soft to fans but I bet the players respect what he does since they probably have the same attitude towards rude fans and media.   "
"I did, his name was Kevin Durant."
"The important part from the article that I doubt people here read:  &gt;Are there Celtics fans who’d prefer a white star? Yes.  Has that thinking trickled into the team’s actual decision-making? I don’t know.  Are Celtics players sensitive to all of this? Apparently so, according to Smith.  Boston has earned a reputation for its racism. That doesn’t make everyone in Boston racist. That doesn’t make anyone in the Celtics racist. That doesn’t make Boston the only city with racism. But there is a perception, and sometimes perception itself matters.  Discussion of race and the Celtics intensified two years ago, when Boston fans cheered Hayward, who was then visiting with the Jazz. Jae Crowder, who’s black and was the Celtics’ starting small forward at the time, took exception. Did Boston fans support Hayward over Crowder because of race?  Celtics fans also also cheered visiting black players, Kevin Durant the year before and Anthony Davis this season. Durant and Davis are significantly better than Hayward. On the other hand, Durant (2016), Hayward (2017) and Davis (2019) each looked like the best player Boston could realistically acquire each of those summers.  There are no clear motives here. Not every fan cheering for Hayward did so because he’s white. Even the fans who prefer their team has a white star rarely admit it, including to themselves."
"This Dan Feldman comes off as a real idiot...  &gt;Yet, they started Gordon Hayward – whose play clearly didn’t merit it – his first 15 games this season.  &gt;Boston went just 8-7 during those games. Its main starting lineup – Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford – scored only 91.1 points and got outscored by 3.9 points per 100 possessions during that span.  &gt;Why were the Celtics so invested in Hayward?  Yeah no shit... He was a returning all-star, we also started Kyrie. Once it became apparent Hayward wasn't ready to play at a starting level he was benched.        Then he tries to make a case but then immediately invalidates his own argument:  &gt;Discussion of race and the Celtics intensified two years ago, when Boston fans cheered Hayward, who was then visiting with the Jazz. Jae Crowder, who’s black and was the Celtics’ starting small forward at the time, took exception. Did Boston fans support Hayward over Crowder because of race?  &gt;Celtics fans also also cheered visiting black players, Kevin Durant the year before and Anthony Davis this season. Durant and Davis are significantly better than Hayward. On the other hand, Durant (2016), Hayward (2017) and Davis (2019) each looked like the best player Boston could realistically acquire each of those summers.  And then he finishes it off by giving a closing statement that conflicts with his opening one:  &gt;There are plenty of good reasons to lean on Hayward – his contract, his upside as he gets healthier. More than with any other player, the Celtics have played best when Hayward is playing well. It’ll be difficult for Boston to reach its goals without Hayward clicking.  His whole article boils down to:  *The Celtics treat white players better than they treat black players except for the times where they don't treat white players better than black players. There's no reason for Boston to invest so heavily into Hayward, but also here's a bunch of reasons Boston should invest in Hayward.*  Does this guy really get paid to have an opinion?"
"Pre trade deadline:  *Trade Steph Curry to Washington for John Wall and Ian Mahinmi *Trade Kevin Durant to the Suns for Tyler Johnson and TJ Warren  *Trade Klay Thompson and Demarcus Cousins to the Grizzles for Chandler Parsons  *Extend Draymond Green and make him the highest paid player in the NBA  Post Trade Deadline: *Publicly call Kevin Durant a snake and force him into a Melo like exile *Tell Klay we won't be resigning him and that he should start to seek out a new team for next year because it ""just isn't working out"" *Tell Steph Curry his family is permanently banned from Oracle Arena. Let him know that we will be trading him for Seth and some fillers in the coming year *Make Draymond Green play point guard and tell him he can only shoot, pass or driblle if he's at least 40 feat away from the basket.  "
"In my opinion, Kevin Durant was the clear no brainer number one pick and giving up whatever to get him would have been a smart move (you screwed up Portland). Maybe because I watched him play college ball but the eye-test was just too much - he could score so smoothly in college and was incredibly agile for a 6'11 player. That Kansas game where he scored 30 in the 1st half was what did it for me.   Shaq was another one. "
"&gt;the Knicks just might fall backasswards into getting Kevin Durant.  And Kyrie, we just might fall ass backwards into getting Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving "
"&gt;shoved a trainer's face in his crotch. Shitty stuff, but not irredeemable like kevin durant  Isn't it crazy that so many people see KD going to GSW as a way worse thing than what Blake did to the trainer. "
"Started off as the prodigy who had everything with lob city and was beloved by all fans. Then started losing playoff series, fought a guy outside of jack astor's, and shoved a trainer's face in his crotch. Shitty stuff, but not irredeemable like kevin durant. The lowest point of the character's story was staying loyal to the clippers but getting traded anyway. Now he is having his best season in Detroit and gaining respect from the media, which in some ways is better than the early career infatuation. Now to cap it all off I think the writer's will have him win a 1st round playoff upset (please not against my Raptors though)"
Suck it KD. Kevin Durant doesn't deserve any rings.  
Not like many people can block Kevin Durant when he shoots pull ups.
"How has he gotten better, the Knicks are still a fucking dumpster fire, who traded away their only good draft pick in 20 years *on the hope* that Kevin Durant is going to move to New York?  If KD comes, then yeah you can argue that the team is heading somewhere. If he doesn't, they've just fucked up in the most Knicks way imaginable.   &gt;If its the former he’s learned from the rangers  Dolan has never been involved in the Rangers, he's publicly stated he doesn't really give any fucks about hockey at all."

"Doesn't need it.  Kevin Durant is at least one of two things:  - taller than you  - faster than you  Anyone he can't shoot over, he can blow straight past if they get close enough to guard him."
Kevin Durant to the Suns confirmed?
"Imagine rolling out a team of Demarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant, and loosing to the fucking suns. "
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, &amp; Demarcus Cousins lost to the Suns...."
"Somehow he managed to overtake Kevin Durant in net rating to lead the team in that over this tough stretch.  He extended his offensive lead, and brought his defensive rating to equal Durant’s for the season.  Just something interesting I saw in their stats. I would assume it’s because Curry tried harder on defense and tried to play make more to compensate for his poor shooting. "
Kevin Durant to the Blazers
If Harden doesn't travel it can be blocked by a defender taller than him that goes for the block while he is gathering.   Kevin Durant should learn it. It would unblockable.
"“Average” Americans don’t know who Kevin Durant or Steph Curry is, ask my fiancée....average NBA fans definitely do. "
"Kevin Durant, he was a Sonic and he's like the type of player you'd make if you created a guy in 2k. He's an amazing player and he has always shown Seattle love."
"He only seems that way to the media and tbh I don’t always like the way he treats them. But at the same time, he’s gotten a ton of shit from them over the years so I can understand why he’s wary of them as well. Pretty much everyone who has actually known him off the court thinks he’s a stand up guy though. [If you don’t like him after reading this piece by Lee Jenkins, then you probably never will.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant)"
I had to look it but and it's actually higher than KD in his entire career.  [Blake Griffin](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/griffbl01.html)  [Kevin Durant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/griffbl01.html)  KD's highest was 6.1 kast year for 2017-18 and 2013-2014 in OKC when he was the MVP.
Kevin Durant
I am actually Kevin Durant so none 
"1st Team  Guards: James Harden &amp; Steph Curry  Forwards: Paul George &amp; Giannis Antetokounmpo  Center: Nikola Jokic  2nd Team  Guards: Bradley Beal and Damian Lillard  Forwards: Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard  Center: Joel Embiid  3rd Team  Guards: Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook  Forwards: LeBron James and Blake Griffin  Center: Andre Drummond  Snubs: KAT, Gobert, Kemba, AD(?)"
"I know this isn't the point of the article, which I think makes a number of great points, but I don't understand how Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would ever be happy playing in New York, which historically had some of the most vicious sports media and toughest fanbase in the world (maybe outside of London). Maybe NY has toned down somewhat in the past decade because the Knicks have been so atrocious, but the arrival of megastars like Durant and/or Irving will 100% reawaken that beast and these guys will face the same scrutiny amped up to one million if that franchise becomes a viable contender. "
It isn't the most stacked team ever without Curry. It is literally worse than OKC if Kevin stayed there... which he would be because without Curry they would have won in 2016.  Steph gets a players as OP as Kevin Durant free dunks in the finals because the Cavs would rather Kevin take a free dunk than Steph get a look at 3. They closed down with 2+ players. Often.  Do you think that any team is letting Kevin Durant get the ball at 5 feet from the rim to double team Damian Lillard?  Ok then
"&gt; future of contracts, rest time, and value.  By most estimates, contracts for elite superstars are already unfairly depressed. If you're paying Kevin Durant $40 million dollars when you should be paying him $80 million, it seems silly to haggle about him taking games off for the long-term benefit **of the team's success.**  That's another component -- it implies that teams should punish players for missing games by paying them less, when players are often missing games with the full support and encouragement of coaches, trainers and ownership. I mean, how did everyone seem to forget that Pop invented this?  Tim Duncan never played more than 75 games after he turned 32. Missing games *because your team wants you to* is not some indictment on leadership or work ethic.  Not to mention that there are still major incentives, especially for younger players, to qualify for the Rose Rule and the Supermax, and games missed factor in there too.  People seem to want to act like Kawhi is going to be the new norm, while ignoring thing like LeBron leading the league in minutes last season, or Harden taking on a crazy work load this season. Elite guys are generally elite because they have an insane level of competitiveness and drive.   "

Kevin Durant is a very good player on a very good team
Kevin Durant is a very good player on a very good team.
"The rockets deal was good. Harden really didnt have a spot on that team, as Durant and Westbrook had struggles sharing the ball as it was. It gave them an elite 3 point shooter (Kevin Martin), and an average one (Jeremy Lamb).  It also included 2 first rounders, one of which was in the lottery. That is a very good package for a contending team close to the salary cap"
"Because Cousins needs reps. Until he got injured (hopefully mildly) Cousins had to play whether the matchups were good or not, because they need him to get reps to be ready for the playoffs. Someone had to lose minutes, and one of those people is Jerebko.  Kerr said he and Jerebko discussed it before the season even started, which is good.  Part of what makes Jerebko such a great player for the bench is that he's taken that so professionally and is just so ready to step in when called.  (Also, Jerebko is a great example of how the margins in the NBA are *so* small. If he was just *fractionally* better at everything, he'd be Kevin Durant levels of good. He's not THAT much worse, but the effect those little differences have is HUGE.)"
"Idk LeBron isn't a shooting guard like Jordan was. LeBron is a playmaker first then scorer. He was elite defensively in his Miami years and made game changing defensive plays in his 2015+ Cavs years. Regardless he has put up ridiculous scoring numbers in his postseason career to go along with insane rebounding and assist numbers. Bron is basically a perfect all around basketball player. Context matters in all of his finals appearances. In 07 he was really young (I believe Jordan was losing in the first/second rounds around that age) and had a questionable team playing against a well oiled San Antonio machine.   I think the biggest L of Bron's career was the 2011 finals. That horrible loss molded him into the player he became after that. He was the best player on back to back championship teams. Another bad L was 2014, although Wade wasn't the same anymore and the Spurs were still thriving on their last legs off of a young Kawhi Leonard. 2015 in Cleveland he had lost Kyrie + Love his 2 best teammates and had Delly starting at point guard. With that 2015 finals loss, bron was still the best player in that series regardless.   Then you have 2016 where LeBron and Kyrie pulled off the biggest upset in finals history. Defeating a 73 win team from a 1-3 deficit.   Summer of '16 the 73 win Warriors replace Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant, the best scorer in the league. 3 years later the Warriors have lost a total of 6 post season games. "
Reeks of insecurity honestly. Comments like this result in Kevin Durant. 
Half of em are Kevin Durant
Yeah and some point you're just built a certain size. Kevin Durant couldn't get big if he wanted to. Giannis is a thin guy who has the body to get big. Ingram is closer KD than Giannis. 
"Like you’re one to talk, Kevin Durant Account #73"
"You know what's crazy? Dirk was never that big of a volume three-point shooter. He never averaged more than 5 attempts, or 2 made threes a game. In fact, a decade ago, he averaged .8/2.1 from behind the arc. For comparison, a second-year Kevin Durant shot 1.3/3.1 that same year."

"I think this interest/report is being used very loosely   Lakers have a interest in signing any great coach, besides Luke, which includes doc. I don’t know why they didn’t also add Popovich and Carlisle in the report.  This seems like when a team calls another team about a player and the result is a quick “no” and it gets reported as trade discussion. Stupid example of the report: lakers in trade with GSW discussion involving 3 g-leaguer for Kevin Durant   "
*checks notes*  wow kevin durant went to college in the south
"I'm old enough that I started watching the NBA in the '80s.   Broadly speaking, I think the talent was more spread out in the '80s-'90s, and more guys were at their peaks at the same time.  For the first example -- you had the Knicks, Bulls, Jazz, Rockets, Spurs with 10+ year runs as contenders with Ewing, Hakeem, Jordan, Malone/Stocton and Robinson (then Duncan). The Suns, Sonics, Lakers and Portland all had shorter runs as contenders, and then Orlando when they added Shaq and Penny.   The other thing is that those drafts from like '83-'87 were so loaded, most of those guys were peaking at the same time: Jordan, Hakeem, Malone, Stockton, Robinson, Ewing, Charles, Mullin, Drexler, Reggie Miller, Kevin Johnson, etc. You didn't have this thing where Giannis and Jokic are 24, LeBron is 34, Steph/Durant/Harden/Westbrook are 30. Everyone was much more on the same timeline.   The end result was that a random Houston/Utah game gave you Hakeem and Malone slugging it out in a potential conference finals preview, where as today there's an 8-year age difference between the two stars and it doesn't really tell you much. "
"*article for those interested *  The thing about the bogeyman is that you aren’t sure if he’s actually there.  It feels like there’s some dark spirit under your bed, but you don’t really know. The uncertainty fuels the fear, racking your nerves and making it impossible to sleep.  For the vast majority of the past five years, the Golden State Warriors — both before and after Kevin Durant arrived — have been the bogeyman of the NBA. They cast a pall over the prospect of parity, often making the playoffs seem like a necessary evil en route to another Warriors trophy hoisting.  Which brings us to this latest mysterious stretch.  Before the Warriors spent these past two games downing premier Western Conference contenders even without Durant — at Houston on Wednesday (106-104) and at Oklahoma City on Saturday (110-88) — it looked like the lights in this basketball bedroom might finally be coming on for the rest of the league. They lost six out of 10 games, had another public display of emotion to explain after Warriors coach Steve Kerr could be seen saying “I’m so fucking tired of Draymond’s shit” in that March 10 loss to Phoenix, looked inconsistent while launching their five-All-Star plan with DeMarcus Cousins, and left rivals wondering if maybe, just maybe, they weren’t light years behind anymore.  “They definitely had that air of invincibility (before); I can say that,” the Thunder’s Markieff Morris told me just two nights before that one-sided, Warriors whopping. “I can honestly say they did. (But) you look around the league, and guys are getting better, guys are adjusting to their game. The style of play they play, they basically changed the NBA, so sooner than later guys are going to start to catch up with the way they’re going and they’re going to have to change.  “I think that’s what’s happening. Teams are figuring out how to play them different, and they definitely are. Even with Cousins, I think they’re a lot more beatable than they were in the past.”  But this is what nightmares can do to the mind. It’s hard to figure out what’s real and what’s imagined, and next thing you know the Warriors are waking up in the kind of way that makes you yank those sheets up over your head again.  “People want to make themselves believe that we’re beatable, and I don’t blame anyone for that,” Green told me while sitting at his locker after the Warriors’ beatdown of the Thunder on Saturday. “You should believe that we’re beatable and that you can beat us. But at the end of the day, in a seven-game series, you’ve got to go out four times and prove that. And until someone proves that, they can think what they want.”  Translation: Even after all these sensitive subplots, from Durant’s looming free agency to his back-and-forth with Green in that Nov. 12 Clippers game to several others in between, keep dreaming.  “Like said in the beginning of the season, when the shit happened with me and Kevin, everybody hopes that something like that would tear us apart,” Green continued. “But the fact of the matter is it’s not. And until somebody can come and beat us, it don’t matter. If I was on the other team, I’d hope some shit like that would tear us apart too.  “At the end of the day, we’ve had, what, five great years? Like long seasons doing great things. Eventually, most of the time, that shit takes a toll on its own. I don’t knock anyone for hoping that (it breaks them), because it’s been proven that no one can really stop it, so you’ve got to hope that it self-implodes.  “Nonetheless, the most important thing about it all is that everybody in this locker room has one common goal, and don’t shit else matter. And that’s the problem that the other 29 teams got. Things happen. Shit does happen, but we’ve still got one common goal. Through all the bullshit, that goal will remain the same.”  When analyzing the perceived vulnerabilities of these Warriors, it’s only natural to point out how they dropped 10 of their final 17 regular season games in 2017-18 and — lo and behold — still managed to win their second consecutive title and third in four years. But let’s not ever forget how Houston came so close to ending that run during last year’s Western Conference Finals, or that those same Rockets have recently looked so capable of doing it again this time around. And while the outcome might very well be the same by the time mid-June arrives, the circumstances surrounding this team are indisputably different. To name a few…  The familiar fatigue factor: It’s another 82 games with the same core, another year where we wonder if they can flip that proverbial switch, and another two-month playoff run that will be so emotionally and physically exhausting. This element goes well beyond the players, too, from the coaches all the way up to ownership. Imagine an elaborate summer vacation that — at times — just feels like it has gone on too long. The Cousins component: Nearly a month since the 28-year-old returned from his Achilles tendon tear, he is trending in the right direction. But the process of learning how he can best function in the context of their embarrassment-of-riches group, while finding the best rotations and lineups, continues still. Cousins has been on point against some of the best bigs in the West of late, from Denver’s Nikola Jokic in that impressive March 8 Warriors win (13 points, six assists, six rebounds in 28 minutes and a plus-5 rating that was far better than Jokic’s minus-29) to the Rockets’ Clint Capela (27 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists in that win) and the Thunder’s Steven Adams (12 points, eight rebounds, and six assists; a plus-19 compared to Adams’ minus-19). His health going forward is somewhat in question, as Cousins suffered a right foot injury late against Oklahoma City and is having an MRI on Monday. The KD quandary: We’ll never know how Kevin’s looming free agency might have been handled if that Clippers game situation never happened, but Draymond’s blow-up all but guaranteed that the questions about their togetherness would be there until season’s end. Remember, Klay Thompson is also a free agent yet there is almost no talk about the dynamic surrounding his future. Durant’s play has been stellar almost all the way through, but that says nothing of the way his uncertain future might impact his teammates. And now that free agency is drawing closer, it’s fair to wonder if that changes the interpersonal landscape. Yet to hear Draymond tell it, these Warriors have mastered the art of compartmentalizing when it comes to the Durant situation.  “It’s not important,” he said of the Durant dynamic. “We’re not about to sit around and walk around, or carry something around, that happened in November.”  Free agency questions be damned.  “He’s part of it right now,” Green said about Durant. “Whatever happens this summer happens. Whatever the hell he do, he does. If he go, he go. If he stay, he stay. But while he’s here, we’re going to win another championship. It’s just that simple. Nothing else matters.”  But it’s not just a championship on the line, of course. This is a chance at a three-peat, the kind of thing that has only been done five times in the 72-year history of the league and that — as I wrote back on Nov. 15 — has had everything to do with Durant’s desire to keep this dynasty from derailing.  “We’ve got a three-peat upon us,” the source close to Durant said back then.  Still, to highlight the fact that Draymond Green is confident is like being surprised that Giannis Antetokounmpo can cover half the court in two absurd strides. We knew this was part of the resumé a long time ago. But in the interest of reading this room, and figuring out if these Warriors are truly beatable this time around, it’s only fair to get the perspective from the other side as well.  In late October, I wrote the opposite version of this story: Who do the Warriors fear? And now, seen through the prism of the Thunder team that couldn’t figure them out on Saturday night, the question is reversed: Should these Warriors still be feared?  "
Well yeah but lebron doesn’t have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson to pick up the slack when he plays terrible 
"Here's their points per 100, just for additional info:  1. 42.5 - Curry (2015-2016)  2. 38.8 - Giannis Antetokounmpo (2018-2019)*  3. 37.9 - LeBron James (2013-2014)  4. 37.5 - LeBron James (2012-2013)  5. 37.1 - Kevin Durant (2017-2018) "
" Breaking it down into several sub categories isn’t going to get you anywhere because you’re not going to find a consensus pick. Wilt scored 30 a game on 54% shooting, but was one dimensional. Same as Kareem. Jordan scored 30 a game, but had the ability to score driving the ball, from the post, from the line but wasn’t a great 3 point shooter. Larry Bird only scored 24.3 points a game, but shot the ball better from a percentage standpoint across the board than Jordan. He could score shooting from the perimeter, off of screens, from the post, from the line. He and Jordan were also 2 of the best clutch scorers ever. Steph Curry is probably the best perimeter scorer in NBA history. Allen Iverson might be the best pound for pound scorer in NBA history. LeBron James can score from all 3 levels at 6’8” and 250....same with Kevin Durant....who’s nearly 7 feet tall....he may be the most versatile scorer in NBA history as a 7 footer. Shaq was cut from Wilts cloth. He dominated low post scoring, but not much else. There have been lots of great scorers through league history who did it in a lot of different ways. I don’t think you can figure out which way is “best” because a lot of guys have been great at it in a lot of different ways. These are subjective in nature. Which is why I boil it down to the most objective way of measuring it....points per game. If you ask most people “Who are the greatest scorers of All Time....people are going to list the guys above. Why? Because they scored more than anyone else. I’m not sure there’s a better way of measuring the ability of a scorer besides that. "
Hi guys I'v just got out of a Thai prison that I have been in for a few years  Has anyone else noticed that Harrison Barns looks alot like Kevin Durant?   And the way Bogut is currently playing it's almost like he could be the MVP of a smaller league like the NBL  if he left the NBA

"I will disagree on KD.  KD is a highly efficient shooter and scorer, but nothing more.  But part of being a great scorer, in my opinion, is the ability to impose your game at will and dominate, and the ability to perform in the midst of great defenses.  Kevin Durant doesn't have nearly as many explosive or high-scoring performances like MJ or Kobe, and come Playoff time, the MAJORITY of his postseasons he has seen a precipitous decline in efficiency compared to the regular season. Kobe has never had such a decline in efficiency come postseason.  KD will struggle against great defenses and from what I have seen in OKC, didn't have the mental willpower to dominate."
"You aren't getting down voted for your opinion, you're getting down voted for ""Durant earns no respect from me.""  No matter what you think about his competitive drive and emotional maturity, Kevin Durant is at worst the fifth best player in the NBA and has been for several years now."

Loved that one, one of my all time favorites"
"&gt; I don't know, maybe when the 73-9 Warriors signed former NBA MVP Kevin Durant, the commissioner should have stepped in?  Right, because the team violated some league rule that says the team with the best record record the previous season is not allowed to improve the next season?   Or because the CBA does not allow an unrestricted free agent to sign with any team he chooses to?  &gt; or better yet, creating a salary system and lottery that gives the players enough incentive to make decisions that create parity.  aka the CBA.

"A) there's more than 2 stats. I didn't realize Kevin Durant died last night, if that happened then now giannis is top 2.    b)""The guys who had both ALWAYS won the MVP"" that's not true.

D)betting sites are not fans, and their job isn't to pick who should win something, its who they think will. and they see how simpletons like you fall for Giannis so they pick him.

You asked for one example, I gave you one. it just so happened to be the very first one on the list. Youre welcome to look it up for once to see how many it is, but making shit up and lying does not help you. Just because YOU set the bar low, doesn't mean it didn't happen more. "" w similar advanced stats"" they didn't have advanced stats back then einstein. Just because people today are able to calculate SOME advanced stats for older players, doesn't mean they existed back then.    E)""His are pathetic if you compare them to other MVP losers"" today i learned the best TS%, eFG%, 3pt%, while taking the fewest free throw attempts, fg attempts, minutes, while also having the most assists and setting the record for points per 100 is pathetic. So because Wilt ""only"" won 4 mvps, harden wont win again? that's idiotic. "
"If 2x Finals MVP, 10x All Star, MVP Kevin Durant in his prime says he will take a max with the Warriors they are going to give it to him. End of discussion. You do not cheap out on that kind of talent."
"No. He's burned too many bridges. No matter what moves the Pelicans make this off season, AD is gone. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie Irving could all be knocking on the door and AD would be gone. Landing Zion just means that the other teams actually have to put together a package the Pelicans are interested in, not just dangle Zion. "
"I don't know, maybe when the 73-9 Warriors signed former NBA MVP Kevin Durant?   Although I'm not saying that teams shouldn't be able to sign players... but obviously the salary system and lottery are not giving the players enough incentive to make decisions that create parity."
You mean Kevin “future sun” Durant 
"It's almost as if Paul George is a serious candidate for MVP, while Kevin Durant has not been. "
&gt; I don't know that KD was dumb enough to believe he would be more beloved that Curry. &gt;  &gt;   There were [reports](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819624-report-kevin-durant-thought-hed-be-seen-as-better-than-lebron-after-17-finals) that KD thought people would consider him better than LeBron after beating him in the finals? I honestly think KD is just really bad at analyzing how his actions will be perceived. 
"Kevin Durant on whether Klay Thompson is an All-Defensive Team player: “Yeah, but the people on reddit don’t really know the game.”"
"That ""abysmal"" team was properly constructed around him to help him succeed, and if Kyrie was still there, they would have been excellent.  The team the year before that, with mostly the same roster, had the best offense in NBA history. But Motherfucking Kevin Durant, so everyone just thinks the Cavs were trash now, I guess, because they couldn't overcome a 73-9 team PLUS the snek.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everyones-a-role-player-when-they-play-with-lebron/"
"Lets look at he DRPM of the best players in the league:  |Player|DRPM| :--|--:| |Paul George, SF|3.06| |James Harden, PG|-0.15| |Nikola Jokic, C|1.66| |Anthony Davis, PF|2.89| |Giannis Antetokounmpo, PF|2.67| |LeBron James, SF|1.83| |Nikola Vucevic, C|3.48| |Kevin Durant, SF|0.94| |Kyrie Irving, PG|0.83| |Stephen Curry, PG|-0.48| |Jrue Holiday, PG|1.03| |Kyle Lowry, PG|1.36| |Rudy Gobert, C|4.23| |Damian Lillard, PG|-0.86| |Jusuf Nurkic, C|3.63| |Joel Embiid, C|2.34| |Karl-Anthony Towns, C|1.12| |Paul Millsap, PF|3.29| |Mike Conley, PG|0.06| |Jimmy Butler, SG|1.6|  He is really no worse than any of the top players. Again expecting a prime lebron is unrealistic. "
Poor Kevin Durant.   He left Westbrook's shadow to go end up in Curry's shadow and his offseason prospects are Lebron's shadow or Kyrie's (Which would be NBA journalists trolling him)   &amp;#x200B;  NBA - A game of Shadows. 
There was reports that Durant was surprised when he wasn’t the consensus best player in the [NBA after the 2017 finals.](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/02/06/kevin-durant-thought-hed-be-seen-as-the-nbas-best-player-after-17-finals/)
Nah it’s hard when Kevin Durant arrives and averages 33-35 ppg in his sleep. 
The Brooklyn nets will sign Kevin Durant in free agency

That’s the Kevin Durant protocol.
"It’s not his fault all his teammates suck. If he had AD, Kevin Durant, Klay, Prime Melo, and Michael Jordan he could would easily be able to sneak in as an 8 seed. "
Wait surely you don’t mean Kevin ‘my team is better without me’ Durant?
"The biggest issues that plagued Trae pre-draft was:  1. He wasn't supposed to be a top draft pick headed into the college season.  2. He doesn't have the ideal NBA body. Look at how many people don't consider Curry to be a truly elite player because he couldn't beat Kevin Durant in some hypothetical 1-on-1 game. Curry is bigger than Trae, so the problem hurts Trae's perceived value even harder.  3. There was a notion that he got worse as the college season went on. In reality, his team sucked so the other team just threw tons of defensive attention at him making him have pretty much the most difficult job in the NCAA, making him look worse than he actually was.  4. Bad teams pick at the top of the draft usually and tend to favor size and athleticism over skill, even though they often get burned for doing that year after year.  4. The draft was loaded too, so going 5th isn't actually bad. It's like Wade going 5th, but being taken after Lebron, Melo, and Bosh. Can't really blame any of those teams for taking those guys over Wade."
"Kevin Durant doesn't fit, he takes a lot of mid-range.  Replace with LeBron for his drive and kick."
Kevin Durant and Paul George are being so incredibly disrespected here it’s not even funny.     Both of them will be top 3 SF’s for most of the next 5 years. Their games age incredibly well. 
"Translation of the other dozen calls: ""Kevin Durant just took their souls!""  JVG: ""They should get a 2-for-1, here."""
"The Boardroom produced by Kevin Durant on **Social Media and Player Development**  I'm sorry, _What?_"
Don't look too much into the results of this game guys. It's just a regular season game without key players like Kevin Durant
Very interesting but can we talk about Kevin “my team is better without me” Durant
"[Woj]: Kevin Durant leaving Golden State, will sign minimum contract with Oklahoma Halftime Felines"
Well this confirms what we all knew: Kevin Durant is Mr. Superfluous
I mean a little Kevin Durant here and there will never hurt
8 3s in the first quarter and 41 points in the first quarter WITHOUT Kevin Durant.  Fuck me....
"Lance, Rondo (already looks like a monstar), Durant, Lonzo (already looks like a monstar), kevin knox"
Lol I'm watching the game and it's a bad matchup for OKC that gets worse when Kevin fucking Durant checks into the game.
Kevin Durant  Paul George  Stephen Curry  Anthony Davis  DeMar DeRozan  Russell Westbrook  Klay Thompson  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  James Harden  Andre Drummond  Kawhi Leonard 
Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors)
My guess:  * Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) * Kyrie Irving (Boston Celtics) * Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) * Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers)  * James Harden (Houston Rockets) * Klay Thompson (Golden State Warriors)  * LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) * Kevin Durant (Golden State Warriors) * Paul George (Oklahoma City Thunder) * Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio Spurs)  * Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans) * DeMarcus Cousins (New Orleans Pelicans)
Impossible. Given that I'm a Kevin Durant burner account
"That's a bold statement tbh, there's a 50/50 chance I'm a Kevin Durant burner acct if you do the math.   An account can either belong to KD or not belong to KD, so it's a toss up. "
"Kevin Durant. The guy is unstoppable as an offensive force. I think with GSW he doesn't get to show it as much, but oh lord"
&gt;go on /r/NBA &gt;look for a Kevin Durant thread &gt;copy/paste exact same fucking comment for 3 years straight &gt;*upvotes*
Kevin Durant
"And then add the possibility of Kevin Durant leaving GSW, if there isn’t a contender so far away from the competition, you have to take that chance. "
I shouldn't have to explain to you that I  wasn't advocating picking a mid level 1st round pick over Kevin Durant. Like use your brain before you write things out lol
Back at you. A middle level first round pick over Kevin Durant. Lmao 
Yeah I mean Kevin Durant probably sucks 
Well it’s mostly because Steph has missed time and let’s Kevin Durant be the center of the team.
Injury report:  Kevin Durant out with a case of bitchivitis.
"Kevin Durant. Best defensive talent ever, if he didn’t have to shoulder such an offensive scoring load he could’ve easily been a greater wing defender than Pippen. He’d also stop Shaq in the post with his length blocking everything "
"Trade Paul George for Kevin Durant. It worked before, it can work again. Also, if KD wants to leave GS and is okay with going home, then PG is a hell of an incentive to get them to do a sign and trade."
"I lost in 07 against USC. Kevin Durant is not a selfish person, I should know...  Wait just to be clear I'm not KD"

"""We either get the best player, or Kevin Durant"".   "
Credit to @AndrewLeezus on Twitter for being this to my attention. The Kevin Durant line is particularly painful 
"&gt;Carrying, also colloquially referred to as palming, is a violation in the game of basketball. It occurs when the dribbling player continues to dribble after allowing the ball to come to rest in one or both hands.  Most definitely a rest in the palm there, it's definitely a close call but either way refs don't call it anymore nowadays unless it's super blatant.  Steph Curry among other shooters have had some moments where they fake a shot mid dribble and then drive to the basket, almost all of those are carries.  Just now-a-days they don't call carrying like at all.  Kevin Durant is another infamous for it."
"&gt; *Kevin Durant finally reveals why he had a burner social media account*  Decluttered version of this SFGate's article archived on March 15, 2019 can be viewed on https://outline.com/uDraft"
If you can't beat them join them.   - Kevin Durant
And Steph let him take it to 7 games when he has Kevin Durant on his team.  Pretty pathetic.
"I still hate Kevin Durant. Yes I’m from OKC, yes I’m petty. He has been a total ass about the situation this whole time though. That being said I believe he is the best player in the world right now. I love watching his face in this vid. /watchpeopledieinside"
*copies Kevin Durant to get same attention*
"I agree and this was a foul.  Iggy dropped KAT off to Durant, but Kevin was in bad position.  If he doesn't grab him, KAT gets an easy catch and flush."
"Lol, salty Warriors complaining about the refs when these guys let Durant run into the stands to get a ball.  These were the correct calls tbh.  Sure it sucks to see it play out that way but then it's on the players to execute within the rules....the rules are not supposed to bend to the players whims.    [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b767rh/kevin\_durant\_dead\_ball\_fouls\_kat\_with\_5\_left\_in\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b767rh/kevin_durant_dead_ball_fouls_kat_with_5_left_in_a/)    [https://imgur.com/gallery/j8pBk94](https://imgur.com/gallery/j8pBk94)   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Tbh, though, it feels good to see KD get shafted by the rules after he got the silly out of bounds play.....he's owed like 3 more of these (one for every step out of bounds he took while the ref swallowed his whistle)"
"Kevin ""Durant"" Tony"
"I hate Kevin Durant, but that was a shooting foul. Call the game right, ref. "
"Durant doesn't stay still, don't let slow-mo dictate the reality of motion and time. Kevin was going up no matter what. "
L2M: Kevin Durant charged the Uber to Mike Browns personal card. 
Kevin Durant has been fined for agreeing on a call.   “Naw that was someone pretending to be me” -Kevin
"Kevin Durant was fouled prior to the shot and Durant absolutely shoved Towns, don't judge calls by reactions."
KEVIN. DURANT. 
"That's basically asking a gut to act like a bitch. I do agree with your premise though, but Kevin Durant is probably the only guy I don't see flop that's top 10."
&gt; Richard Jefferson and Tmac told us he’s just a role player on a stacked team that doesn’t have any pressure and hasn’t really taken a leap though...  Kevin Durant in 2014: Kawhi Leonard is a system player
Is that Draymond or Kevin Durant with the made jumper? I can't tell the difference.
"Any team with Kevin Durant will have a magnifying glass on them because everybody wants to see if he can win without Golden State, it doesn't matter where he goes.  He spent 9 years in one of the smallest markets in the league and was still always talked about."
"oh fuck off. for starters Harden was a top 5 pick. and the only reason why he was a ""role player"" was because of 2 bums named Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. "
"It’s me, Kevin Durant!"
"No. There is NOT a statistical argument. The only statistical argument you have is using bullshit accumulative advanced statistics that result in trash rankings. Rpm has Rudy Gobert as the 10th best player, Kevin Durant as the 11th. Vucevic as the 7th, Lebron as the 8th. Siakim as the 18th, Blake Griffin as the 30th. That’s the one stat you’re using to say there’s a statistical argument DBook isn’t a top 50 player? That’s a joke.   Bro if you replace ANYONE other than the 10 best players in the NBA with DBook, the Suns get worse. Lebron couldn’t make the playoffs with a 35 win team last year. The 25th best player in the NBA couldn’t lead this team to 25 wins. "
The Lakers would like 1 (one) Kevin Durant for 1 (one) Ivica Zubac
*looks at shooting percentages*  Kevin Durant...  Harden’s free throws carry his eFG and TS%  I don’t mean it as hate but people keep saying “omg Harden’s so efficient” but concentration camps are not a good means to an end
"The Hawks and T wolves role players are vastly superior to the Suns. Wolves have Jeff Teague, Rose, Taj Gibson and others who are reliable vets. Hell the Wolves 3rd string PG Tyus Jones is better than any PG on the suns current roster. Everyone loves Trae Young and loves to forget about John Collins who is averaging 20-10 on awesome efficiency, Taurean Prince Huerter Dedmon and others, all of whom are better than anyone currently healthy on the Suns roster outside of Ayton and Booker. Suns are demolished by injuries and start 3 rookies some nights, you don't win games. Which, speaking of Ayton people love to shit on Booker's defense, how about we talk about Ayton? He's 7'1"" with long arms and extremely athletic and yet averages less than 1 block a game and his biggest criticism coming into the league was his defense. Where's his defense? Booker gets held to some seriously ridiculous standards on here. Replace Booker with Kevin Durant and that team still doesn't make the playoffs. End rant"

"Don't kid yourself, Kevin Durant is a much much better scorer than Harden"
"[Dave McMenamin] Kevin Durant when asked how he felt about Draymond Green's ""comment"", calling him a bitch: ""THBPBPTHPT"" "
"Can they ban players?  If the Rockets' Stadium decided to ban Kevin Durant and Steph Curry from their stadium, can they enforce that and prevent the Warriors from using them?"
"He doesn't ruin teams, but he does take all the players on his team and utilizes them to glorify his own game (the Lebron system) whereas a guy like Kevin Durant is able to plug himself into any team system and elevate that system at the price of his own stats and individual accolades. Bron isn't a team player like that "
"Steph curry and Kevin Durant are certainly on Tim Duncan’s level I wouldn’t put him above them no question like that.  Along with Klay Thompson, those are 3 of the best shooters of all time... on one team.  LMA and especially demar derozan do not compare to that level of scoring.  Not even close and it’s laughable to suggest so."
Kevin durant
Fucking Kevin Durant.
"If Kevin Durant leaves Golden State, I kinda want him to go to Dallas.  Make the cap issues work, Cuban."
Kevin Durant
"He's the most dominant college player since Kevin Durant. If he wins the title, the most dominant since Carmelo.  He's as sure as it gets.  "
"Kevin Durant is pretty well-respected.   People usually call him “snake” to illustrate his lethal moves.    A lot of the time, people will call him “soft” which I think refers to his soft touch around the rim   And people can’t stop talking about his “burner accounts”. I think they’re referring to all the accounts of him scorching the opposinf defense? "
And I can probably find people who think that Kevin Durant is the greatest player of all time. Doesn't mean it's the viewpoint of /r/nba as a whole let alone even a portion with noting.
Kevin Durant - catch the ball in the post or 10 feet in way more often.
Kevin Durant 
We have the non-taxpayer MLE.  That's like 9M.  Didn't Durant just say he [didn't care about money](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-wants-much-money-i-can-next-free-agency-contract)?
Kevin Durant is going to sign with OKC this summer. You heard it here first. In a totally unrelated thread. Facts.
"Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant"
"They both need eachother.. Do you think that the warriors w/o KD would be the 16-17 Cavs? They would not. The same thing can be said with the 17-18 Rockets.. Of course, both of those takes can’t be proven. What can be proven is that Kevin Durant is the certified closer in any Warriors game. They need him"
"It is a hot take , I would argue Steph is better then KD more important then KD and KD needs Steph more then Steph needs KD.  If KD leaves this summer GSW still favourites to win championship as long as they add few more players, while KD if he goes to the Knicks will not be.  The best player in the world right now is either harden or giannis they are both leading their franchises , they are both the most important players on that team and fucking unstoppable.  I feel like there was a stupid understanding that if Lebron isn’t the best it KD , it’s the same thing with MVP we come into seasons with a person in mind and it’s that persons to lose.  Kevin Durant might be the greatest scorer in NBA history but he hasn’t done what Steph has done.  People need to understand he joined a team that he had 3-1 lead in the WCF and lost too because I don’t think he can be the best player on a team.  We all love to blame Westbrook but KD was missed so many shots that could have got him passed the warriors.  "
"Kevin Durant and I really don't think it's that close.   Honorable mention to Steph, Melo, Kobe, Wade, Shaq, McGrady though "
"There have been 20 total 50+ point games this season, 2 of which were back-to-back by Booker.  Back-to-Back 50+ point performances have only been done by 9 other players in the history of the NBA.  This year's list of players (and top individual accolades) with 50+ Point Games sorted by high scoring game is comprised of... * James Harden (MVP) - 8 50+ Point Games this season * Kemba Walker (Multiple Allstar Apperances) * Devin Booker (No accolades) 2 50+ Point Games this season * Lamarcus Aldridge (5x All-NBA) * Giannis (2x All-NBA) * Klay Thompson (2x All-NBA) * Kevin Durant (MVP) * Damian Lillard (3x All-NBA) * Lebron James (4x MVPs) * Stephen Curry (2x MVPs) * Blake Griffin (4x All-NBA) * Derrick Rose (MVP)  By contrast, there have been over 100 40+ point games this season, I can't even see the full list on nba.com because it doesn't go that far.  40 points is a fucking good game, but 50+ and each 10 after that are on their own level due to rarity.  Also to compare to the earlier, James Harden has had 40+ ppg in a game after he scored 40+ppg a whopping 11 times including a 5-game streak of 40+ppg.  There are too many players with 40+ ppg games for me to review stats to see who all has had back-to-backs this year.  * Sauce on Top Scorers this Season: http://www.espn.com/nba/gameleaders/_/sort/points  * Sauce on James Harden Stats: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01/gamelog/2019/"

"I feel like a lot of people are off the ""fuck kevin durant"" train. Not me tho. Fuck kevin durant. "
Espn: there was a dispute between one of the warriors players and a coach. Guys is this the end of the dynasty   SAS: Max you know me   Max: *nods*  SAS: you know the love I have for my very dear friend Kevin durant   Molly: *laugh*  SAS: I think it’s finally time to say DURANT WANTS OUT AND HE WANTS TO BE ON THE KNICKS  
"It was the Durantest game of his career.  ""Why, yes, I am going to score with ridiculous efficiency while making solid and genuine contributions to my team across the board. It will also be entirely possible for the casual observer to fail to notice that I did anything, particularly. The mark of the truly great servant is that you do not notice they are there. I am Kevin Durant. I am The Servant.""  dude knew what he was about"
"I have trouble naming 50 players who definitely have superior career accolades.  20-30 pretty easily, but 50? Melo is a 25k point scorer in the league (could increase if he gets back in as a role player), surpassing Hall of Famers like Wade, Barkley, AI, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen, Logo, Bird, Pippen, Glide, and Patrick Ewing just to name a few.  He was a 10x All-Star and 3x Olympic Gold medalist, an NCAA All-American and National Champion. He also won 6 All-NBA selections coming from the same draft class and competing in an era with the greatest of all time player at his position in Lebron James, and first-ballot HoF forwards in Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, (occasionally depending on the season) KG and Duncan, McGrady, Paul Pierce.    Rings are obviously important, but would you leave Karl Malone, Barkley, Stockton, Ewing, Iverson, McGrady, VC, CP3 etc out of the top 50 despite that they haven't won one? "
"Next post on here will be, ""Kevin Durant should smile more and why his demeanor means he is leaving in free agency"""
"Kevin Durant is unstoppable. Got height, arms length, strong core to finish strong, hit mid range &amp; 3pts consistent threat, handle the ball, and make plays. People complain he has 4 all stars, but those all stars skill set, and mentality are about getting the W anyway possible as a team. Look at the Celtics where they had allstars &amp; rising stars in every position, but something they can't play together well consistently. So what if you have bunch of Allstars if they can't play as a team."

"Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant"
*Kevin Durant has left the chat*
1) Kevin Durant at 6'5 could still get by plenty of people and score just fine   2) Kristaps Porzingis at 6'8 or 6'9 could still play   3) If Khris Middleton put more focus into playing off the ball he coud still make it at 6'2 
"Yeah help defense your right that's the big thing with him that's changed he just didn't really understand how to look at defense at a 5 v 5 level he was so consumed with his own guy in the past.   Youre right also once they tried turning AG into Paul George on offense it was like he basically thought ""We I can be the man now on offense and run the show so fuck trying on defense I don't have to bother anymore"".   Man to man [his defense has been real nice this year](https://on.nba.com/2U0US3y). Amongst main offensive option type guys the only ones who he has defended for 25+ poss who have scored at above their usual clip per poss are Paul George Lauri Markkanen and Kevin Durant. But AD, LeBron, Westbrook, Jimmy Butler, Middleton, Gallinari, Tobias Harris, Kawhi, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin and Luka those guys have all been at least 7 pts below their usual per poss average when guarded by him. Giannis, Ben Simmons, Siakam all are below their average. His stuff vs LeBron isn't a fluke either I remember looking it up but in his career on 365 poss vs him he's held him to 50% TS and a little over half his usual pts/poss average(I think it was 21.3 pts/100 poss where as LeBron has averaged 36 pts/100 poss the past 5 years) "
Those shooters? Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
James Harden 2nd??? Kevin Durant 10th???? I am astounded at this list
"&gt; sure but no team has ever come back down 3-1 which is what cavs did against the winningest team in history  The ""winningest team in history"" that almost loses in the WCF and lost games in every single round against every single opponent.  GSW were 73-9 in the regular season, and then lost 9 games just in the POs.  They pushed way too hard in the RS to get the Bulls record and paid the price in the playoffs.  Dont get me wrong, it was one hell of an impressive win. But the Cavs had Lebron James and 2 perennial all-stars with him vs a team in 2016 that was Curry, Klay, Harrison Barnes, Iguodala and Green with Livingston, Bogut and Barbosa on the bench.  The difference of talent between the players of both teams wasnt big at all.  Just saying that people talk about that 2016 GSW team like it was the Kevin Durant GSW.  Just saying, that I think the Pistons victory in 04 was more impressive. Just 1 fringe All-Star that season (Big Ben Wallace), no superstars and winning playing through defence as a team vs absolute monsters like Shaq and Kobe."

“Lakers interested in signing Kevin Durant”
Kevin Durant has already said he's looking for The Max this off-season. 
"It wasn’t 4 million, it was the repeater tax. Also the new contract rules with Kevin Durant would have absolutely destroyed their cap space. They just sped up the inevitable and actually made a smart move to acquire depth. If not for pat bev being a dirty shit stain they would have won the ring that year.  Also there’s no guarantee harden becomes the star he is today if he doesn’t move to his own team. He’s likely limited by role and the fact the thunder already had two other stars who need the ball. This isn’t a bosh or love situation, none of those three would have just been a spot up shooter during those years. "

"Basketball is an awesome sport. The best all around player right now I would say is either Kevin Durant who plays for the Warriors, or giannis antetokounmpo who plays for the bucks.  The most hated/controversial team is the Warriors. They’re stacked with a bunch of good players (including Kevin Durant) "
"It's more the unbelievable frustration that the ref stepping into a star player's butchered folded-in-half leg isn't even the cherry on top of the hot garbage that was the culmination of events in this game, the sum total of which perfectly captures the team's plight going back to that time Kevin Durant got drafted by Seattle Supersonics.

THE BRAZILIAN KEVIN DURANT
"What? How the hell are teams supposed to get good players? All we do is praise teams that build through the draft. The Celtics have 2 major contributors drafted top 5. The thunder have freaking Russel Westbrook who was the 4th pick, and before he left, Kevin Durant who was the 2nd pick.   Look at basically any dynasty sans the Warriors and they have a top pick. The 80s lakers/Celtics, the 90s Bulls.   Like dude, are you memeing? Because the only option other than building through the draft is by trading and acquiring through free agency, which people *already bitch about* because it looks like large market teams are stealing small market teams’ players. "
"Stephen A is a straight fool. A caller called into his show and asked if Avery Johnson had a chance and Smith said no chance but Mark Jackson is one of the options. The caller asked why and Stephen A was so rude to caller and talked down to him like he was superior. Fuck Stephen A, why would Mark Jackson who hasn’t coached in years be a top candidate but not Johnson? Oh I know, one works for ESPN and the other doesn’t.   Whatever Stephen A Smith says either is fake or he just hops on the bandwagon. He has no credible sources, his so called A1 sources told him Demar Derozan and Kevin Durant were gonna be Lakers. He doesn’t have the juice anymore, he needs to stick to doing hot take TV shows and leave the other stuff to the people who will take it seriously and not just want to create a headline. "
"well, you guys have a competent GM and kept on trying to get better  we have ernie grunfeld and after kevin durant wouldn’t even tell us we’re a nice guy we rolled over and died"
It is when you're in the NBA.  You can't even imagine the level of coaching you are getting. Every single superstar turned into one at the pro level.  Kevin Durant couldn't even get his team out of the first round when he was in college...
Why isn't Kevin Durant on GSW?
"Yes, stats are part of what's called **context**, that is used by literally everyone when comparing players. You seem to believe that it's impossible to include context in comparing players, which really says more than I possibly could about the quality of your basketball analysis.   But sure, you go on ahead thinking that people ONLY use context when discussing your boy Durant, and nobody else.  Because I'm sure I've never seen anyone ever talk about ""weak Eastern Conference,"" or ""eight teams, lack of competition"" when players are discussed here.   I love when brand new Warrior fans are too afraid to actually use their team flair, while making it so damn obvious that they are a GSW bandwagon fan. ""Poor little Kevin is the only person in NBA history who has negative context applied to him, it's so unfair!!"""
https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kevin-durant-slim-reaper.jpg
Almost as ironic as you crying someone made a Westbrook joke right in between your “kevin Durant is a snake” posts that were funny 2 years ago.   
So do you think 2007 Kevin Durant was close to the caliber of a decent nba player or no 
"I don’t see how injuries is “screwing up”. 2012: finals appearance, super young. 2013: Best team in the league, Russ injured by Patrick Beverly first round. 2014: WCF, serge Ibaka injured most of the series. 2015: both Kevin Durant and Russ miss most of the season, miss playoffs. 2016: Choked, lost KD. 2017: Russ MVP, bad team. 2018: Roberson goes down, defense never recovers. "
"I think the Warriors without Curry are still title favorites. Kevin Durant one of the most unstoppable players ever. He has just had 2 of the best finals ever imo, scoring completely at will and making clutch shots. The Warriors always end up adjusting to playing without Curry, they’re 10-3 in the playoffs without him."
"What the hell are you even talking about? Literally everyone looks at the context of players winning when ranking players, otherwise Bill Russell would be the undisputed GOAT. You have to be absolutely delusional if you honestly believe that people ONLY use context to discount Kevin Durant, and not anybody else.  What exactly do you think people look at when ranking all time great players, if they refuse to look at the context of their accomplishments? If not, why isn't Bill Russell #1 on every single list?"
"Jerry West got runner up 4 times, and he never even got to win one. Larry Bird was runner up 4 times. LeBron, 3 times. Kevin Durant has one MVP to 3 runner ups, just like Harden will if he loses this year. Was there some vast conspiracy against those guys as well or is being runner up a lot just something that happens when you play at a high level for a long time?  I don’t find myself saying “any other year”, because he wouldn’t win it any other year. Off the top of my head I think both guys would lose putting up the same stat line in 2012, 2013 and 2016, and that’s just this decade. Possibly 2017 too, because it can’t possibly be overstated how much media frothed over Westbrook that year."
Does anyone remember when the Warriors were the best team in the league and then they signed Kevin Durant and then the signed Demarcus Cousins?
2% of this sub can dunk over javale mcgee while being guarded by Kevin Durant during a game in the staples center?  Please tell me you’re joking
Kevin Durant can’t believe it 
"This is what you left Cleveland for?  Lebron is the opposite of Kevin Durant, he went from the finals to the worst team in the league. In fact he made them trade their pieces before he got there got more scrubs then traded the last of the good pieces again. Hardest road"
"(Friedel): ""So it turns out that Curry, in fact, did not need contacts after all and that his contacts were merely a placebo. Kevin Durant has informed me that the real reason Curry's shooting has gotten better was because he decided that farting on Steph's pillow had grown old. He will now exclusively be farting only on the pillow of Draymond Green."""
"Winning 73 games, losing to Lebron and then adding HOF Durant to the team didn’t help Curry. They basically created a PSG (super team in French soccer league) and no one even comes close. Imagine La Liga with Barcelona only and no Real Madrid. Basically they are supposed to win. Curry won his title with Kevin Love and Curry out. When healthy they lost and added a player from a team that put them on the brink in the West. His peers don’t view his rings with Durant as an accomplishment. Wade won a ring before Lebron. Even Lebron said the Cleveland ring meant more than any others. Sorry, but Curry can’t win 4 rings with this team but his individual legacy will always be the greatest shooter who had to add Durant and end all completion because he couldn’t lead the team on his own and struggle"
ITT: Kevin Durant needs to come to my favorite team or at least leave the Warriors so my team can at least have a chance because Golden State is making things really hard right now
For me the fact that Kevin Durant had 6 turnover but a +37 is just the strangest thing.
"Kevin Durant = insecure Hall of famer, so he can take Shaq’s role  I don’t think there is someone similar to Charles "
"Tobi is in his prime and has only gotten better every year in the league, he's a high character guy, low usage player, fits a positional need for the Sixers, and perhaps most importantly is probably the best player Philly can utilize within the cap rules.    Unless someone like Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard decides they want to play for The Sixers. The Sixers, given their poor leverage position, will max Butler and Harris. "
Do you know how hard it is to coordinate the pass so you achieve just the right amount of verticality and depth over a jumping Kevin Durant to get it to Giannis? 
"how much of prime kevin durant and steph have we all missed out on. their 13/14 and 15/16 seasons were respectively just insane to watch. its all been a bit statisticians wank since then. flashes of brilliance but not consistent, 100% exhibition of their talents. the biggest shame about the juggernaut warriors imo"
"MyLeague is fantastic enough as is, but this is the one thing I wish 2k would tweak a little. It kinda ruins the vibe when you see PG or Kevin Durant sign with the Pacers :/"
"NO! I’m not giving them the favorites! And despite everything I just said about James Harden they are not the favorites and I’m not going to give it to them! You know whyYYY? Because I’m d- I’m, I’m- I’m- I’m- I’m deferring to my man the great one Max Kellerman “The Nature Boy Ric Flair WOOO!” To be da man you’ve gotta beat da man AND LAST TIME I CHECKED the HOUSTON ROCKETS d- are not the reigning defending NBA champions that would happen to be the GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS YOU HAVENT BEATEN DEM YET and UNTIL YOU BEAT EM, IT DON’T COUNT. WOOOO! That’s what Ric Flair says DA NATURE BOY I stand by dat! I APPRECIATE, the fact th- that James Harden is great I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CHRIS PAUL IS GREAT! YOU KNOW I BELIEVE JAMES HARDEN SHOULD BE MVP. CLINT CAPELA HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE ERIC GORDON HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE Trevor ARIZA HAS BEEN IMPRESSIVE! Not just ON the basketball court, but in those STAE FARM commercials. I THINK HES DONE A GOOD JOB - RYAN ANDERSON has seve- certainly stepped up I GOT NO PROBLEMS WIT DAT whatSOEVer BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED THEY ARE NOT THE MAN! IT IS THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS! With KEVIN DURANT, one of the top 3 players ON THE PLANET WITH STEPH CURRY, THE GREATEST SHOOTER WE have eva seen, WITH KLAY THOMPSON, one of the top 5 shooters IN NBA HISTORY AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED! And I didn’t even bring up DRAYMOND and DAVID WEST and SHAUN LIVINGTON and IGOUDALA AND EVEN SWAGGY P HIMSELF! THE WaRRIORS ARE the team to BEAT because theyre STANDING HERE as the reigning defending NBA CHAMPIONS. TO BE DA MAN- WOOO!! - YOU GOTTA BEAT DA MAN it is JUST DAT simple they are NOT the favorites, it is the GOLDEN State WARRIORS until you knock them OFF!"
"Charles Barkley? Shaq? Elvin gentry? Allen iverson? Reggie Miller? Kenny Smith? Kevin Durant? You know, credible people who, maybe play basketball"
"correct. but if rudy gay was kevin durant, he would be a better player than harden. "
"Let’s see.  Adding KD to the roster gives a starting lineup of... &gt;PG — Ben Simmons &gt;SG — Jimmy Butler &gt;SF — Kevin Durant &gt;PF — Tobias Harris &gt;C — Joel Embiid  Adding James Harden... &gt;PG — Ben Simmons &gt;SG — James Harden &gt;SF — Jimmy Butler &gt;PF — Tobias Harris &gt;C — Joel Embiid  Both of these lineups would be absolutely killer, so it’s tougher than it seems. KD has the finals experience and is arguable the ~2 best player in the world, but with James you get an extra 2 years and maybe a month of 40 ppg if you’re lucky. You can’t go wrong with either.   Personally, I think I would take Harden. With both of these lineups Philly would have an amazing shot at a championship each year, so I would rather that window be 4 years opposed to 2. "
Wouldn't they re-sign Durant's closest friend DeAndre Jordan?   DSJr RJ Barrett (*assuming they don't win the lottery*) Kevin Knox Durant Jordan  All they really need is a serviceable wing player (Trevor Ariza?) and they aren't that bad 
"People are downvoting you but lets remember we are discussing why he isn't one of the GREATEST offensive players ever.  This career best TS% is worse than Kevin Durant and Steph Curry's career average TS%.  Dude is efficient for an NBA first option, but historically his efficiency isn't mind blowing, nor is his volume (25.2 career high ppg).  If you don't excel at either of those you are going to be hard pressed to one of the greatest offensive players in the history of the NBA."
"How about this (""Small ball"" line-up): PG - Magic Johnson, SG - Michael Jordan, SF - Lebron James, PF - either Giannis or probably Larry Bird (take your pick), and at C - Kevin Durant"
"I'm trying to figure out my ""all-time starting 5"" - with an emphasis on VERSATILITY (while still being all-time great players.  How about this:  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  PG: Magic (DID play all 5 positions)  SG: MJ (could also play PG and SF)  SF: Lebron (could play all 5 positions)   PF: Giannis/Larry Bird (sounds like I'm learning heavily towards Bird, as they could both probably play all 5 positions)  C: Wilt (also has been described as playing a  ""Point Foward"" position?)  (or if I want a ""Small Ball"" lineup: Kevin Durant? also, plays/could play SG/SF/PF )  &amp;#x200B;  thoughts? (I know I'm probably going to get ""torn a new asshole"" for even mentioning this, lol).  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;"
"The disrespect.  &gt; ""Late game, Giannis doesn't have the ball in his hands to win,"" Magic guard Evan Fournier said. ""For an MVP, that's kind of hard."" &gt;  &gt; That ability to score with the game on the line is why Fournier believes Curry and teammate Kevin Durant should be in the running every year. He also considers the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors to be the best team in the league, not the Bucks, despite their league-leading record. &gt;  &gt; ""If we're talking best player on best team, I'd go with Steph,"" Fournier said. ""It should really be between Steph and KD, but they're never going to get the credit they deserve because they're on the same team. If it's between [Antetokounmpo and Harden], you have to go with James."""
Especially Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is the Kylo Ren to LeBron's Darth Vader.
"LeBron was a perfect villain on the Heat. Kevin Durant has been pretty mediocre as far as baddies go imo, I really hope AD can really be the next big villain in the league. The NBA is just so much better when you have a supervillain playing. My personal favorite was Kobe, who lived long enough to see himself become the hero"
"&gt;  This might be why KD is looking at the Knicks, as they have a promising young core  There's no actual evidence I'm aware of that KD is looking at the Knicks, and their ""young core"" is not that promising.. They also have the worst ownership and most toxic media environment.  If he wants ""promising young core"" he'd be better off looking at Dallas or Sacramento.  In the incredibly unlikely event that he were to see this and be interested in the opinion of a random redditor:  Of the options, I think he should go for Dallas. Carlisle seems to have learned to keep a looser grip on the reins, and a core of Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic, Kristaps Porzingis and *insert name here* could go far."
"YOU THOUGHT IT WAS KEVIN DURANT, BUT IT WAS I, DIO, THE WHOLE TIME"
Danny leroux suggested a Kevin Durant sign and trade for gallinari + change in case KD wants to go to LA (Please stay KD!!!!).
[Shams] Kevin Durant has signed a 4 year 200 million dollar deal with the westchester Knicks 
"it kills me that NO ONE thought having uneven legs would be a problem at the professional level. these people want us to believe he was a more sure thing than kevin durant. at any rate, i remember reading about how both of paus parents are doctors and he was looking at medical schools in spain before ultimately picking the nba."
"On ball, off ball. It's becoming way more muddled with guys like Donovan Mitchell, Oladipo, Harden, Bradley Beal, and other 2 guards that are taking on a more ball dominant role.  But basically the idea is that the point guard is the play initiator, and the 2 guard is a guy that you would run plays for. But the league has become wing and iso heavy. So a point guard can do iso stuff without initiating a play (see: Kyrie), and a 2 guard can be a guy that can play 2-4 (see: Paul George)  In the new way the league kind of defines this role and this stuff, I wouldn't worry about the exact position, but their role within the offense and their role within the defense. Like I watched LeBron run plays as a point guard, and I've also watched him post up as a typical power forward and hit post fadeaways. Or if you look at Steph, he's really fucking good off ball as well as on ball, so he can be technically slotted in at the 1, but Kevin Durant may be the guy initiating the play and Steph is running off screens to get open looks. So it really doesn't matter what the distinction is anymore."
Kevin Durant quietly nods in respect at the sheer efficiency.
Kevin Durant: “I’ll find you on Twitter later”
"""Kevin Durant is a walking cheat code who is 7 foot tall and can pull up from THIRTY!"""
Somebody show this to Kevin Durant
"Stephen Curry, Shaun Livingston  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant, Andre Iquadala  Draymond Green, Jonas Jerebko  DeMarcus Cousins, Andrew Bogut  That is an insane 9 man rotation  2 MVP's, 5 All Stars, GOAT shooter one of the GOAT scorers and another top 5 shooter."
at this point they might just be so committed to not admitting they're wrong that they're just gonna act like kevin durant doesn't exist  bunch of comments in our game threads next year asking why we only have 4 players on the court 
"Idk if that's really the case to be honest.   It's kind of sad that 3x champion LeBron James and soon to be 3x champion Kevin Durant in successive summers will have joined 2 of the worst teams in the league by record over the last 6 years, whose front offices have shown no signs of being good at their jobs. It kinda hints that they are at a different stage in their basketball careers and contending isn't as much of a priority at this point, which is perfectly fair for them to do if they want, but, like, LeBron missed the playoffs this year with the Lakers, and it wouldn't be crazy at all if KD ends up going solo to the Knicks that they miss the playoffs as well, and that's just bad for the league, even if they are in the 2 biggest markets in the league with the 2 biggest brands.      "
"Last year, he was quite honestly the least capable offensive guard I have ever seen in my life. Literally no redeeming qualities except for his slightly above average defense. Guy straight up couldn't make a layup or dribble or shoot a jumper or pass.   He was coming off offseason surgery but it was clearly more than that. Think about Fultz's yips, and apply that to every shot. That was MCW last year. I wasn't expecting much but it was seriously shocking and sad to watch.   There was a point several weeks into the season where Dwight was shooting better on 16+ foot jumpshots than MCW FROM ANY RANGE, INCLUDING LAYUPS. It really can't be overstated how bad a scorer he was. The entire offense collapses with a link that weak at PG.  I'm happy for him if he turns it around. The guy played hard no matter what but making Tony Allen look like Kevin Durant is why he's having a tough time landing contracts now. "
"ESPN:  Kevin Durant reportedly unhappy with life, may look to team up with the Dalai Lama in India this off-season to put together an all self-actualization squad"
"Really? Show me where it gets “personal”:  &gt; MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Joey Crawford came sprinting at Kevin Durant, blowing a whistle and waving arms and the bright lights of Chesapeake Arena shining off Crawford’s bald head, and Durant surely must have thought only one thing.  &gt; No sanctuary even at the foul line. Even with the clock stopped, Tony Allen sends a demon to bedevil the NBA’s presumptive most valuable player.  &gt; Allen is inside Durant’s head. Durant is dazed and confused. Hesitant and docile. The Memphis Doberman has turned Durant into mere mortal this Western Conference playoff series. The Thunder is on the brink of elimination, and if Durant doesn’t return to something approaching the Slim Reaper in Game 6 Thursday night, Grim Sleeper is going to be more like it.  &gt; Durant has made just 40 percent of his shots against the Grizzlies. Allen’s been in Durant’s sneakers. Meets him at the bus and tucks him in at night. Then haunts Durant’s dreams.  &gt; Don’t believe it? Durant is so out of sorts, he’s not making hay even when Allen is on the bench charming teammates with his mercurial ways. The last two games, Durant has made just eight of 20 shots with Allen not in the game. Durant is so out of sorts, his foul shooting is mediocre — 28 of 39, a .718 percentage that is below NBA journeyman standards, much less Durant’s own .882 career percentage.  &gt; Durant went to the foul line three times – and made just one of two on all three trips, including a miss after Crawford’s interruption, when the Thunder trailed 100-99 with 27.5 seconds left in overtime, a score that held up at the end. For six years, Durant has shot foul shots on a string. Mister Automatic. Now he’s unreliable.  &gt; All because the mighty Memphis defense, led by Allen, has knocked Durant from his moorings.  &gt; “Obviously we’re trying to make his catches tough, and if we could make it so he never got to touch the ball, I certainly would,” Memphis coach Dave Joerger said. “Our guys did a good job, not just the guys who were guarding him, but the guys who were supporting the guys who were guarding him.”  &gt; Durant was not available for interviews Wednesday but said after the game Tuesday, “I just gotta stay disciplined in my shots and knock them down. Stay aggressive and stay positive.”  &gt; Trouble is, Durant’s aggression and positive attitude come and go. His shoulders have dipped repeatedly during rough stretches of this streetfight. His effort is spotty. His confidence is shaken.  &gt; That’s not appropriate for a 25-year-old superstar. A 21-year-old star? Sure. When Durant made just 35 percent of his shots in that six-game Laker series in 2010, we knew it was growing pains. Knew that Durant was being hounded by Ron Artest, the Tony Allen of yesteryear, a guy who sold out to defense and could stage Les’ Miserables for even the sharpest of shooters.  &gt; But that was four years ago. Allen is a beast, but the Thunder has to get better production from Durant. This is not a team built to take up the slack elsewhere. Sure, a Reggie Jackson 32-point game can fall out of the sky. But count on that too many times, and it’s happy trails for the Thunder.  &gt; “I’ve seen great players have poor playoff games,” said Super Vet Derek Fisher. “That happens, in terms of shot percentages. But what can’t dip down is that undying sense of urgency, every play, every situation is the most important one.”  &gt; Fisher says the Thunder can’t lay this series all on Durant or even Russell Westbrook. But Fisher is wrong. This Thunder team was not built to sustain off days from its stars. This Thunder team is fueled by Durant and Westbrook. One or the other, preferably both, have to play at a high level.  &gt; If both struggle, nothing else matters. The Thunder is cooked.  &gt; This is a historic series in more ways than just the four straight overtimes, which might never be equaled. This series is becoming an historically bad series for the presumptive MVP. And it doesn’t speak well for the Thunder future.  &gt; The Durant and Michael Jordan career ascensions often are compared. For good reason. Not that Durant is or will be the player that Jordan was, but that Durant is progressing, growing, learning and hopefully developing into the champion that Jordan became.  &gt; Except at age 26, his fifth season in the NBA, Jordan led his Bulls to the 1989 Eastern Conference Finals. Durant, at 25, is in his seventh pro season. Chicago ran into the Detroit Pistons, the Bad Boys of recent 30-for-30 fame. Those Pistons were one of the great defensive teams of all time and one of the toughest. They dispatched the Bulls and went on to the NBA title. In 1990, same script. Detroit beat Chicago for the East crown and also won the NBA. In 1991, it was Jordan’s time. The Bulls swept the Pistons, then Chicago won the first of its six NBA titles.  &gt; Three straight Eastern Conference showdowns for Jordan against Joe Dumars and Friends.  &gt; In ’89, Jordan shot 46 percent from the field and averaged 29.7 points. In ’90, 46.7 percent and 32.1 points a game. In ’91, 53.5 percent from the field and 29.8 points a game.  &gt; Jordan, even while paying his championship dues, was the bedeviler. So far in this Memphis series, Durant is the bedeviled.   This is totally fair IMO. That was his mvp season and they were struggling in a series they needed to win. "
Kevin Durant attempts 1 less Free throw per game than James Harden.   GSW literally needed a colossal fuck up by the refs to almost beat Houston in a game this year. So nice try?

"So would I but that's kinda the thing we're never gonna get it.   Maybe it's because Berry has done enough legitimately shitty things to him he's just completely done with him.   Maybe it's because RW just thinks ""It's the media their a bunch of nobodies Im not actually going to waste time thinking about or talking about some guy I don't like. Im above that dude anyway"".   Best guess is its somewhere in the middle. Thing Ill say in Berry's credit is he's always been above putting the blame directly on RW with this [many quotes like this in the past: ""could have been from Syracuse for the way he acted,” Tramel said. “[But] that’s not really Russ’s fault, I don’t think. I think the culture created that.” By “culture,” he meant the invisible handcheck that pushes reporters away from athletes.

"Yeah, poor Westbrook only having Kevin Durant, James Harden, and fucking Paul George as teammates over the years.  Woe is him."
Or Shaq lol. How can you be so thinskinned when you are Kevin fucking Durant man? Like you can walk into any NBA team they would throw all the money they have to keep you.
I get ALL four of those guys or just Kevin Durant?       I'll take Jokic and Doncic for the next 10 years
I just wish Kevin Durant was on literally any other team so I could cheer for his success.  Bitch ass motherfucker
"LeBron is kinda TBD because he got injured halfway through the season but I’d 100% take Harden or Durant over Giannis as floor raisers.  Kidd showed very well how amazingly mediocre a Giannis team can be if everything’s working against him, and that was *with* some talent around him. Put him on an actual trash team with Kidd as coach and we probably wouldn’t have even made the playoffs last year.  Giannis can do a lot by himself but he works best within a system, which makes him more of a ceiling raiser type. You put a good system and a well-fitting team around him and the sky is the limit, but he can’t really *be* the system like a James Harden or Kevin Durant."
That Kevin Durant is such a badass
Is... is Kevin Durant taller than DeMarcus Cousins?
"You would think the team that gets the friendliest whistle in the league would shoot more free throws than they do, that's my point. And yes, an extreme example since everyone, even Kevin Durant, said the refs we're garbage that game. Fans are hostile against refs because they routinely let Steph get fucked but calls small stuff against him"
Lol of course I'm salty. The Kevin Durant Warriors added an All-NBA Center. It hardly seems like a crime to be salty about that. 
"Problem with the Bucks is that their defensive scheme allows opposing teams to shoot a lot of 3's. I know they mostly dare bad shooters to shoot, but I still don't see it working too well on a team with Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant. "
Kevin Durant is the best player in the world 
The Denver Nuggets have no answer for Kevin Durant

‘I gave him ample time to stop’ -Zack Zarba   Before anyone starts saying it had anything to do with *what* he said. It wasn’t. That short interaction was long enough to warrant two techs and an ejection of Kevin Durant.   Nice play refs
Kevin Durant is so tough. 
"&gt; That's not only a two technical ejection for Kevin Durant, but also his 15th and 16th technicals of the season. He'll be suspended vs the Lakers on Thursday if none get rescinded.  Fuck"
&gt; You got 0-27  I like how people think this is some sort of insult. A team that won 73 games adds Kevin Durant and still got taken to 7 games and needed a historic shooting slump and our second best player to get injured to win against us.

"He is a great defender but he only got 8 total points; one more point than Kevin Durant, who nobody would call DPOTY candidate.  He also got no first place votes.  He is one of the best wing defenders in the league but DPOTY is a stretch, I don't see him ever finishing top 5 in votes or anything like that"

"&gt;Durant was willing to guard Lebron was content to just let the narrative ride that he has to carry so much on offense that he can't play defense.  &gt;And on defense Lebron was just hiding on the other side of the floor content to watch Rodney hood and Jeff Green get cooked. it wasn't that he wasn't contesting a shot, he just wasn't guarding anyone of impact.  1) You can argue KD&gt;LeBron that series but these are just false statements. [LeBron spent 129 poss guarding Durant](https://on.nba.com/2VbfZwp) KD [126 poss guarding LeBron](https://on.nba.com/2VeWjrI) one guy didnt guard the other more at all.   Frankly neither guy really did much to shut down the other. KD after game 1 probably played better D than LeBron did overall but it was more decent than anything speical.   2) The best case honestly for KD is that his playmaking was really really good that series on top of his usual scoring and 65% TS. He also had the signature moment with the clutch shot in game 3 to basically ice the series.   3) This also comes down to burden of responsibility and difficulty of task. KD is playing with all stars. LeBron was playing with Kevin Love and trade deadline acquisitions.   The Cavs scored 404 pts in the NBA Finals but at a solid 109 offensive efficiency. LeBron scored 136 of those while [creating 100 points out of his assists](https://on.nba.com/2VcwzMw).That's almost 60% of all the Cavs points he was responsible for on what was again an efficient offensive performance both by the team and him individually. And honestly it should have been more [his teammates only shot 35% on his passes that series](https://on.nba.com/2VdGWQn) after it being way higher all year. Only 25% on 3s from his passes.   That season [his teammates capitalized on 52.5% of his potential assists to make htem assists by hitting shots](https://on.nba.com/2VeACIj). If they had simply capitalized at that rate instead of 40% like they did that series LeBron would have averaged 13-14 assists per game that series. "

"So basically it's like this. There are 30 teams and each plays 82 games in the regular season. 15 of those teams are in the western conference, 15 are in the eastern conference. Teams play the teams in their conference 4 times a year, and the teams in the other conference 2 times a year.   At the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference are seeded into a playoff bracket based on their w/l record. Playoff series are best of 7 games. Whoever wins the playoffs wins the NBA championship. Right now, we're right at the end of the regular season. Playoffs start soon.  Now for the game itself. The most basic rules are simple, and you probably know them already. Putting the ball through the basket gives your team 2 points, except if you shoot it from behind the 3-point line (also called the arc, the perimeter, and a couple other names) which gets you 3 points instead. You need to dribble to run with the ball. Each possession has a 24 second shot clock, which means that once a team gets possession of the ball, they have 24 seconds to make a shot or they lose possession. If you get fouled, you get to shoot undisturbed from the free throw line, and each made shot from there gets you one point (some fouls though just turn over possession to the other team but you'll figure out details like that as you go). There are a lot of other rules but that's what you need to know for now.  There are five positions in basketball (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center), but *generally speaking* this can be simplified to three types of players: guards, wings, and bigs. Below I'll describe in broad strokes what each kind of player does, but there are dozens of exceptions, so don't be surprised when you notice a player that's not conforming to the positions and playstyles I describe.   Guards are the smallest (and often quickest) players, and they have the ball in their hands the most. Their best skills are often (but not always) playmaking, passing, and shooting. They most often operate around the perimeter (3-point line), setting up plays for their teammates and either passing the ball to a wing or big for a 2-point shot or getting open for a 3-point shot. Guards are usually 6""0-6""6. Examples include Steph Curry, Devin Booker, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  Wings are bigger players usually with longer wingspans. They set themselves up to receive the ball from guards closer to the basket, but are usually also good at shooting from beyond the three-point line if need be. They're typically stronger players that work to position themselves in such a way where they can get easy shots. Wings are usually 6""5-6""10. Examples include Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.  Bigs are, as the name implies, the biggest and strongest (but usually the slowest) players. They traditionally play close to the basket, receiving entry passes and brute forcing close shots. Their size also makes them the most important players on defense (again, broadly speaking), since they're hard to shoot over and harder to overpower. They're also very good at getting rebounds, which is when a missed shot bounces off the rim and is collected by either team to gain or regain posession. Examples include Joel Embiid, Karl Anthony-Towns, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.  I think that's all the info you need to get started. I recommend just watching whatever games are on and finding a couple teams you find fun to watch. Then you just go from there. "
"&gt;Can you summarize what's happening  Western Conference:  Basically the Warriors have won the championship the last two years since Kevin Durant joined them, and are considered the heavy heavy favorite to win it again this season, especially with the addition of Demarcus Cousins. The Rockets came very close to beating them last year before injury hit them hard, but they in theory do have the fire power and capability of beating them. The Nuggets are a surprise team this year who no one expected to be as good as they are, but it remains to be seen how they do against the other Western Conference favorites. The Clippers are also a huge surprise, as very few people had them making the playoffs especially after they traded away their best player, but it will be difficult for them to progress far into the playoffs. The Blazers, Thunder, Jazz, and Spurs are all capable of winning a few series but aren't quite at the level of the Warriors or Rockets  Eastern Conference:  The Bucks are the big surprise of the year, but they currently look like the Eastern Conference favorites. The Raptors have also been stellar this year. The Celtics have been extremely disappointing but are still a solid team at least on paper. The Pacers lost their best player but have still been good, unfortunately it doesn't look they'll make it that far in the playoffs without Oladipo. The Sixers have one of the best starting lineups in the league but were pretty much embarrassed by the Celtics who were missing their two best players in the playoffs last year and have a weak bench, so it remains to be seen what their ceiling is. The Nets are a huge surprise story and have been playing quite well recently, as have the Pistons and Heat/Magic (whichever of the two teams make the playoffs), but I would consider an upset of any team rather unlikely in the first round, with the Bucks, Raptors, Celtics, and Sixers all having various degrees of likelihood of making it out of the East"

Kevin “I’m Married to a Basketball” Durant
"Tell that to Reggie Miller. Ron Artest. Dennis Rodman. Patrick Beverly.   I’m really not about to explain to you why I think the warriors are a plastic piece of shit. I’m allowed to not like the warriors, including Kevin Durant 😂"
This comment didnt age well.[^^^^fuck ^^^^the ^^^^refs ^^^^my ^^^^guys ^^^^did ^^^^nothing ^^^^wrong](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/04/02/stephen-curry-kevin-durant-draymond-green-fined-criticism-officiating)
"&gt; KD had the better 16/17 regular season and outplayed Lebron in the 2017 Finals.  33/12/10/  vs  35/8/5  One player was surrounded by 3 all stars, including the 2 best shooters of all time, a 2x MVP, and a DPOY.  The other had Kyrie Irving and a broken Kevin Love.  Hmmmm wonder who I'd take.  Durant probably wasn't even the best player on his own team lol.  &gt; outplayed Lebron in the 2018 Finals.  35/8.5/10  vs  29/11/7.5  This time LeBron didn't even have Kyrie. He had JR Smith lol.  Your hate is blinding you. LeBron haters are wild lol."
"Quote addressing r/NBA:  &gt;No player has been the subject of more on-court scrutiny over the past few years than Russell Westbrook. Other guys have been maligned for off-court choices (most notably his ex-teammate Kevin Durant), but Westbrook’s wildly variable style of play combined with his penchant for chasing statistical milestones has earned him quite a bit of criticism. His detractors will point to his “empty” triple doubles as proof that we’re all too focused on round numbers and that Westbrook’s third straight season doing something that had previously only been done once in NBA history is somehow a bad thing."
"We have considered LeBron to the best player for a long time now because of what he's done in the postseason.  Kevin Durant hasn't proven anything as a great player. He never made it to the Finals after 2012 before joining GSW despite having a great team around him. He then joined a 73 win team he had a 3-1 lead on that didn't need him to compete for a title, the biggest bitch move in NBA history, even worse than LeBron's ""the Decision"". Kevin Durant's work on the Warriors is COMPLETELY negligible, it means NOTHING. All he's done is win on a team that didn't need him. That's it. Doesn't matter what numbers he puts up, his defense offense whatever, he is an unproven as a great player.  &amp;#x200B;  But I can not consider Giannis nor Harden to be the best player in the world, since they too, are unproven in the postseason, and LeBron is now out of that discussion after missing the postseason. It would seem that out of no one else being able to occupy that spot, that spot would belong to either KD or Steph, maybe Kawhi."
"The blazers would wipe the floor with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins. That's funny."
do u realize how ridiculous you sound saying that a lineup with kevin durant klay thompson draymond green and demarcus cousins isn't enough to win a championship?
Kevin Durant will receive endless bashing
"In the playoffs, we all see that Kevin Durant is the most valuable player on the Warriors. They’re both amazing players though."
Blazer’s picked Greg Oden first over Kevin Durant
"I'll play devil's advocate and say Kevin Durant has been the Finals MVP two years running and the Warriors are strongly favored, even against the field, to win a third straight championship.  He's not the regular season champion, but until someone knocks him off his throne he's the post season champion."
2017 FMVP: Kevin Durant  2018 FMVP: Kevin Durant  
2017 FMVP: Kevin Durant  2018 FMVP: Kevin Durant  2019 FMVP: Probably Kevin Durant
"Lack of a superstar, I think. If Kevin Durant showed up next season and suddenly the Cavs were making long playoff runs again, people would probably come back."
"The question was: which rookies have caught your attention this year?  *""None,"" Simmons told ESPN. ""I want to be where the greats are. So, for me, I watch the guys like (Kevin Durant), (LeBron James), (Stephen) Curry, Russell (Westbrook). Guys like that. That's where I want to be. I think for me, that's what I love to watch.""*"
Steph curry is not good at all he’s a. System player Kevin Durant carries them -easymoneysnjper 
Kevin Durant quote by Zhou Qi was unexpected 
"Mind you Steph had prime Kevin Durant, prime Klay Thompson, Prime Draymond (when he could shoot), and finals MVP Iggy.  "
"I don't think the original article wasn't that bad of an idea. This article throws out a blend of 4 advanced metrics in favor of a single one. Their single metric has some dubious picks, and I get that - all in one metrics are different and noisy, but usually fairly decent. Blending 4 for a consensus is better than taking just 1. This article just goes for one, and a metric that has Demarcus Cousins in 2019 as being worth Kevin Durant.  Also, keeping the same distribution as the original article mean shifting the cutoffs bizarrely higher, even though the talent distribution isn't the same. The first article established bands based on average ratings across many seasons. This article assumed the bands not based on the previous dozens-of-seasons data, but just distributed them  to the same number of players as 2017, instead of the criteria. Because of course 2019 would have the exact same number of '3rd best player on a championship team' candidates. That's inane from a real stats perspective.  I did some brief comparison to the original methodology.  Warriors: Unaltered with the old bands, although 2017 considered Klay a +2.1 '3rd best player on a championship team' player, and now he's a net negative. (lol?)  Raptors: With the old cutoffs, Kawhi is now a Beta (good enough to be a secondary championship star!) and the Raptors now have 7 points.  Bucks: Khris Middleton isn't even a Gamma still, but Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe are, giving the Bucks the 5 star minimum.  Rockets: Capela's 2.0 qualify's him as a Gamma, giving the Rockets 6 points.   Jazz: Favors and Ingles qualify, but still leave them at only 4 stars. Not a contender.  Nuggets: Unchanged at 4.  Thunder: Steven Adams would be a Gamma under the old cutoffs, giving them 5 points with the dual betas of Paul George and Westbrook."
"He hasn't made one since February 18th, 2018. He has attempted 4 'ankle breaker stand and delivers' since then and missed all of them.   He needs to ball instead of look nice.   Love Harden but don't like what he has turned in to regarding his ""MVP"" attitude. Play ball, don't act like you the greatest baller on the planet cuz you ain't. Not even top 5 for real.  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry...  Paul George? Russell Westbrook? Joel Embiid? Karl Anthony Towns? Devin Booker? Kyrie Irving?  Who would we truly take James Harden over...?"
How is he a top 3 of all time? He’s not even top 10-15 offensive talent.   1. Kobe  2. Kareem  3. Harden  4. Larry Bird  5. Pistol Pete  6. Kevin Durant   7. Michael Jordan  8. Allen Iverson  9. Dr J  10. Wilt  11. Shaq  12. Magic  13. Stephen Curry  Maybe LeBron fits in down here but I find it hard to believe people think he’s a top offensive talent??
"&gt; A 2nd (or 3rd, whatever) year player absolutely should not be as good as he is. Simmons is absolutely the best prospect we’ve had in the league since LeBron IMO.  Can I interest you in Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving, or Anthony Davis??"
Dis nigga is Kevin Durant
I loved this clip and hate Durant. I like how he ended the first question. IM KEVIN DURANT and looks at everyone haha
"Kevin ""Celery"" Durant"
"now he just developed next level shit.  I'm Kevin Durant.  man that was smooth. he talks ball, very well, and he's himself. no animosity with media. he's ready."
"The dramatic aspect to coverage has definitely been extremely prominent in the past couple decades. But I feel like overall in sports there's a big counterculture bubbling up of people who truly want to hear about game mechanics from the very best. Interviews like this are really fun to listen to, and can still have those great sounds bites like ""I'm Kevin Durant, you know who I am""."
Who gives a shit? Nothing he said was wrong.   - Pat Beverly makes his money by being a pest and we all know that.  - Their defense is gimmicky in the sense that they’re absolutely gambling a lot of the time and hoping it leads to turnovers or missed shots.  - The David and Goliath analogy was him using an analogy that people are familiar with and he was exactly right when he said that the little guy is able to get away with more than the big guy.  - He is Kevin Durant
"To Shaq:  * Kawhi Leonard is the second-best player in the NBA; Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best player in the East; one of LeBron James, Kevin Durant, or Antetokounmpo is the best player in the entire league.   * Joe Ingles is not a shooter  * Spending $20 4x is not the same as spending $80"
Their model has Lowry equal in terms of star power to Kevin Durant lmao... doesn’t have Klay Thompson at all.
"""I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am?"""
"My comment was an add on to the parent comment. It wasn't supposed to be taken as an individual comment. That's why I put ""They also"" because I was piggy backing off his comment.   You literally just commented because you thought I took a dig at Kevin Durant or LeBron and you wanted to argue."
Friendly reminder that James Harden and Kevin Durant used to play on the same basketball team and that Russell Westbrook was also in fact on that team.
"I’m Kevin Durant, bitch"
"Every nba player is able to break down an opposing teams defense like this. I understand there’s some sort of amazement with this, but this isn’t only a Kevin Durant or lebron James thing"
"Sounds to me like Beverly got to him. ""I'm Kevin Durant""."
"Wow I don't watch a lot of KD interviews but I thought that was very well spoken, insightful and intelligent. Sure, there were cocky jabs at Pat Bev, but like he said, he's Kevin Durant."
Yeah it was basically he’s small and people like David and Goliath so the ref favors him. I’m Kevin Durant so I can take advantage of my height
I like this Kevin Durant
This thread is moving so fast that nobody will know that I'm Kevin Durant
"They also had the incredible fortune that Curry was hurt early and had to sign a sweetheart deal which kept their cap space more flexible than others.   Other than that though, absolutely right. It's not their fault that the players opted for a single season jump in the cap rather than the smooth increase which allowed them to even sign Kevin Durant in the first place."
If I didn’t already start to change my mind about KD because I want him to be a Knick so bad then this would have changed my mind about him. This is a great answer and I love the “I’m Kevin Durant” line.
Kevin Durant knows alot about basketball. Hot-take.
"if the offseason goes perfectly then he's spending the next 4+ years with Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Zion Williamson in the starting lineup with him, so yeah you can pencil in DeAndre Jordan in LA type numbers offensively"
"I rock with KD for the “I’m Kevin Durant, you know I am” line"
Does this dude reek of insecurity to anyone else? The way he says “oh I can score over the top of him every time” and “I’m Kevin Durant” made me think he’s getting worried. Beverlys in his head bad
I’m Kevin Durant!
"Has anyone ever seen Kevin Durant and Bill Belichick in the same room?   That's what he was implying when he said ""You know who I am""  Leave enough breadcrumbs and we'll find you out, Bevin Delichick."
"I mean, he's Kevin Durant. You know him. Check the stat sheet, he's one of the best players I've ever seen. He knows what he's talking about. Would you expect Jordan or Kobe to not know what they're talking about? Do you play basketball?"
"Yeah it was in-depth and super informative but it was very clearly a ""fuck the Clippers and Patrick Beverley in particular"" breakdown. In these two minutes he:  * Said the Clippers had a gimmick defense * Said that he was Goliath and the Clippers/P. Bev was David * Said that Beverly makes his money by grabbing people and acting like a pit bull * Said ""I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am"" implying he was too good to have a back and forth with Bev  I mean it was a good breakdown, and I actually like this type of attitude and honesty, but I guess I was hoping ""in depth"" would be more than ""he's getting underneath me and the defense is helping and oh yeah Patrick Beverley is a pest"" spread out over 2 minutes lol"
Kevin Durant knows basketball. I need more of this type of talk from great players like KD
"Dude, Harden's only Finals appearance thus far was as a bench player. You might want to change your criteria.

"Damn, am I the only one that smiled when he said “I’m Kevin Durant, y’all know who I am.”  That there coming from him especially was dope"
I love Kevin Durant. This dude truly loves playing basketball.
"""I am Kevin Durant"""
Say my name. SAY IT.  Kevin Durant...  You're GOD damn right
“I’m Kevin Durant!”
"Haha I like feisty KD ""I'm Kevin Durant. Ya'll know who I am."""
"It was good stuff until ""I am Kevin Durant, you know who i am"""
“Im Kevin Durant.”   Wow. I hope to have that type of confidence in my eventual career
Say my name..  You're Kevin Durant..  You're god damn right
"Well I disagree with that, but my point in the comment you replied to was more so what r/NBA users\Fans think.    Most fans though Paul George was leaving (This was largely because The Lakers appeared to be the better team in better position to compete for a championship, and because the Lakers have a bigger fan base who control the narrative more)   Most fans don't think The Knicks will get Kevin Durant (This is because once again fans control their narrative).   Most fans don't think Kawhi will leave for The Clippers (Again fans control narrative = fans think he's staying in Toronto)"
"But they're not actually moving the ball anymore than they always have. I mean, like he said, he's Kevin Durant. No coach or system is going to willingly move toward a direction that causes him to shoot less."
"“I’m Kevin Durant. *looks around intensely* y’all know who I am,”  Ooohhhhh wee"
I want a shirt that says “Im Kevin Durant” and on the back “you know who i am”.
So what hes kevin durant you know who he is. He can shoot every shot over beverly at 43% but that ruins the flow of the game.
No if he put 20 contested shots and shot better 43% thats playing the way you play. YOU ARE KEVIN DURANT. Being passive is why yall blew 31 point lead at home to the 8th seed. Unacceptable. And him breaking down the damn defense is not that fucking impressive.  This is same damn defense the rockets played on him last yr. I can see if he was doing photo-graphic memory shit lebron was doing last yr but this some we all can see thus shit.
Kevin Durant in a nutshell
" ""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.""  *Looks around to make sure everybody knows who he is*"
"Evidently, r/nba collectively forgot who Kevin Durant was because he refused to chuck up 30 shots to prove a point against fringe starter Patrick Manlet king Beverley"
You realize we're talking about Kevin Durant right? Of course he cares that much.
"He was still acting pissy. Talmbout he’s kevin durant. Nigga we know u are. If you KD, then u should be sweeping them niggas then."
&gt;I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.  lol I fuckin love it.   Steph and KD are two of my favorite players so this is a weird series for me. I just hope the Clips keep fighting as best they can.
"""Sometimes I like to treat myself and my family to life's little pleasures. Why not, we all deserve a little pampering! Take watching basketball for example: we all do it every day, so I like to add little touches to make it more enjoyable. Soft fluffy towels, a little scented candle, and of course, cushiony soft players like ~~Charmin Ultra Soft~~ Kevin Durant."""
"Literally none of you listened to the full quote.  For one, he ends that ""1 on 1 over beverly every time"" comment by qualifying ""IF there weren't multiple guys helping.  And then goes on much longer saying some pretty interesting stuff.  Does sound a little cocky, but he's Kevin Durant lol.    Here's the video  https://streamable.com/6jco9"
“I’m Kevin Durant”  You’re also the guy who disappeared when your team was in the process of blowing a 31 point lead. If you can score every time on Beverly.... where was it the other day?
Kevin Durant is a snake. Confirmed.
"damn ""I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am"" I mean he's not wrong, guy's fucking incredible at those pull-ups"
"Which is a testement to how absurdly overrated KD is that he joined a 73 win team and still was in that situation    Also Curry and Klay sparked that comeback in game 6 vs hosuton, not KD    Kevin Durant is a front runner"
Look at what happened when Kevin Durant wasn't surrounded by the two best shooters in history including one that's a two time MVP and all time great. Couldn't come close to winning a time. A true fraud that KD.
"Oakland fans will still love them but it will be tainted, like seeing an ex you admittedly still care about with a new boyfriend who is better than you. It will be great to see the Warriors thrive when they leave, but the game experience will be altered forever. Never forget the owners plans were always to high-tail it out of Oakland as fast as they could, thinking they could placate Oakland fans with an awful looking jersey and a bunch of fake love. The future of this franchise is going to be strictly about the cash, it's clear with their massive plans for an adjacent business park, these ridiculous suites and their desire to have Chase Center be the focal entertainment venue for the city. This is why they have to win this year----it will never be like this again and its sad. Kevin Durant, no matter his opinion on his future with the team should stop being such a whiny child and just enjoy this because it will all be over soon. I'm rambling but that video made me upset. The clippers need a new stadium so they can finally forge an identity but the Warriors already have one and decided to shun it for the bright lights of San Francisco. it hurts on a deep level"
Rob Schneider as.... Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant would be the least fun to play with because when you lose he would join the other team
"It's not like they were chanting the whole game. Anyway, part of Wade's legacy is beating the Celtics and that mini rivalry. It would have been weird if they started chanting Kevin Durant sucks."
"You need a better hobby. If you're looking for something, you'll find it whether it is there or it's not. We could pull ""dirty plays"" of every single NBA player out there if we wanted to.  Yes. I can blame fans for reactionary bullshit. I expect people to not react like emotional little children and look at things critically. We're supposed to be taught critical thinking in college, this obviously isn't happening (that or people aren't applying this skill to real life).  These guys are playing a sport, a sport in which body contact happens, not every frigging blow to the nads is purposeful, some guy literally posted a play of Nicolas Batum in this thread stating ""wasn't as intentional as this play,"" the clip is of Batum taking a swing at a BASKETBALL, his hand deflecting off the basketball, and his follow through landing on dudes groin. There was nothing intentional about it. Either people are don't understand what ""intentional"" means or they lack critical thinking skills.  I guarantee you LaMarcus Aldridge isn't thinking ""let me punch Gary Harris in the balls for setting a screen on me."" Anyone with critical thinking skills can see the dude is trying to fight through a screen in which Garry Harris hasn't planted his feet and is moving, (ie, he isn't set), the only intentional think LMA did was try to work through that screen, everything that happened after that was just a combination of players being in close proximity, and LMA fighting through a moving screen.  It's like watching a baseball play of a guy getting whacked in the nuts, and saying ""it was intentional."" People are straight up morons who don't want to take time to think, instead, they react, and post stupid irrelevant shit (like LMA closing out on Kevin Durant) to be like, haha, see, he is dirty.  Dude. If you're looking for something, you'll find it."
That team had Kevin Durant and James Harden.
"I agree it's too late to trade OKC but it's incredible how OKC has not been competitive in these past 7 years with all the talent they had. James Harden, Kevin Durant, Oladipo , Paul George, Carmelo , etc. People will look back at this OKC franchise from 2012-2019 with shock."
"Kevin Durant had one of the best supporting casts a young star has ever seen, probably only under Magic in the 80s and Dwight in 2009"
"Harden was Sixth Man of the Year and he disappeared in the finals, Durant and Westbrook got outplayed by prime LeBron Wade and Bosh. Durant said that one of the reasons he left was because [the team didn’t put enough pieces around Durant and Russ. ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-kevin-durant-appears-to-blast-ex-coach-teammates-in-since-deleted-tweets/). Durant even said he didn’t like playing for Billy Donovan."
Uh.... so here's an example....2016 here are the teams so you tell me if it matters:  West: - Anthony Davis - James Harden - Steph Curry - Kevin Durant - Kawhi Leonard - Marc Gasol - Russell Westbrook - Klay Thompson - Gordon Hayward - Draymond Green - DeAndre Jordan - DeMarcus Cousins  East: - DeMar DeRozan - Giannis Aafdsfasfasdfaf - Kyrie Irving - LeBron - Jimmy Butler - Paul George - John Wall - Kemba Walker - Carmelo Anthony - Isaiah Thomas - Kyle Lowry - Paul Millsap  See anything vastly different about these teams?????
Like Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka?
"He literally said Russ wasn't part of the ""cats"" in his tweet on the burner. So many people have got this wrong recently. Just astounding how people can spew so much fake news. www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets"
"WS/48 is an almost perfect predictor of MVP. The leader in this stat usually wins MVP. Not surprisingly when they deviate from the player leading this, these are the most controversial.  For this decade for example:  * 2010 - MVP Lebron James WS/48 - Lebron James * 2011 - MVP Derrick Rose WS/48 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James / Lebron James * 2013 -  Lebron James / Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant / Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry / Stephen Curry * 2017 - Russell Westbrook / Kevin Durant * 2018 - James Harden / James Harden  * 2019 - ???? / Giannis Antekoumpo  James Harden and company do too much whining. He’s a 1x MVP caliber player and they gave it to him the year he earned it.  In 2017, Durant was the best player. It was his first year with the Warriors and he played elite defense in addition to elite offense. Kawhi Leonard was 2nd, and since there was no way they were giving Durant the mvp that year, he would be more deserving than Harden.   Golden State won 67 games that year and Sam Antonio won 61.   This year he didn’t even finish 2nd, Gobert finished 2nd behind his beastly 68 TS%.  Harden is nice and has been Top 5 for most of the last 5 years outside of that one down year, but their constant whining about not getting MVP’s they don’t deserve is getting old. Want to win the MVP? Have an MVP season with excellent stats and team success."
"&gt; get a clue  Spoken like someone who’s insecure about the fact they don’t know what in the fuck they are talking about   Scoring titles are one of the most concrete examples of individual contributions to the sport and have been used frequently in every player debate ever and saying that they mean nothing as an individual accolade is not only laughable but is such an irrational take it almost falls into a state of absurdity unable to be argued.   I don’t have to explain myself here, anyone who’s ever watched Kobe, Jordan, LeBron, Kevin Durant, or any other scoring champion knows how full of shit you are"
"""The fuck?!"" -Kevin Durant"
We had James Harden and Kevin Durant on our team one time
This is why Kevin Durant left OKC
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kyrie."
“Green grabbed Kevin Durant and said ‘You’re treating every game like it’s the end of your time here.’ He told Durant they don’t need him and don’t trust him.
Patrick Beverley wrote the book on how to guard Kevin Durant.
"Signing Kevin Durant and winning back to back NBA championships definitely eased the pain a little, but not completely gone."
Kevin Durant
"because he makes more than james harden, paul george and kevin durant yet his output is comparable to danny green"
Wait *squints eyes* that’s not Kevin Durant
I don’t get why we ask all these people not named Kevin Durant.  We should ask Kevin Durant directly.^/s
"Who is the more potent offensive scorer, Lowry or Kevin Durant ?"
I don't think Bev is scared of Kevin 'zero reps at the combine' Durant
"Stats would really favor Curry tbh, and great as Lillard has been, Curry is the player who ended up with a dynasty. A lot has gone into it, including of course the Kevin Durant situation, but Curry has consistently elevated those around him and continues to do so.   Lillard has a lot of the same traits, he’s a level headed leader, he ices the game when he needs to; he too, like Steph can shoot right from the parking lot, but when all is said and done, Curry is the one who led a 73 win team, and as great a shooter as Lillard is, Curry is the one who brought us into the era of the limitless range 3 ball. Those things factor into greatness, and also add substantial credence to his slight, but obvious edge over Dame.    No bias ofc."
“I’m going to evolve into Kevin Durant”- Dwight Howard has he scrambles for excuses on why he needs touches.
"Kevin Durant is looking past this series to the next possible opponents and resting, PatBev ain’t letting him do that. In fact he’s in his head, some would say rent free."
Kevin Durant is top 5 in playoff ppg.
"They were the greatest team in basketball because they had beaten the regular season record, so statistically, yeah.  And THEN they added Kevin Durant, pretty much the consensus 2nd best player in the world.  So obviously they turn into an entirely different beast the likes of which we've never seen before.  Context, man."
Die hard. Whole team walking over broken glass to throw Kevin Durant out a skyscraper window.
I know nothing about the Bucks cap situation but I’m sure plenty of free agents would want to play with a 24 year old Giannis. Not a Kevin Durant tier guy but definitely a Middleton tier guy
"He's more like the B- version of Kevin Durant,"
Only Kevin Durant to go and the rest of the league has a chance boys!
No but Dirk in his prime was not the Talent Kevin Durant in his prime currently is so that's sort of a bad comparison.

is kevin durant a pussy if he turns down a 200 million dollar contract?
hey guys here is a kevin durant thread pls love me
I get your point but I (and millions of people) do give a fuck about where Kevin Durant plays basketball.
You know who Kevin Durant is? He might bes a Warriors 7 foot guy. Can't be sure though
Kevin Durant such a cool name
Who is this Kevin Durant fellow I continue to be told I know? Is he a good Spalding round all in the peach basket fellow?
Kevin Durant is just...refusing to fuck around right now.
KEVIN DURANT
Kevin Durant is a cheat code
Kevin Durant and Russ probably would have changed that. The era from the late 90s till 2008 was pretty brutal
I became a fan. The guy got punked by Kevin Durant on his podcast. The whole season has been grinding. No media drama... just ballin.  That performance was straight cold blooded.   I'm all in. I would live to see Damien knock out GS and KD.
"&gt; Last year Dame was swept from the playoffs and was filled with loathing and faced incredible adversity. He could have rolled over and died but instead he humbly worked on his game. He refined it and molded it into him becoming easily the second best point guard in the league with a solid case for being number one. Russell Westbrook has also faced adversity. Once Kevin Durant stabbed him in the back and the heart simultaneously, he had all of the good will in the world. All he did was squander it by refusing to become a true leader and setting up a culture toxicity. It's no surprise he has such ardent defenders in this day and age since he reflects many of the things that's wrong with this society. The selfishness, the rudeness, the lack of emotional control, the big talk without backing it up (does this sound like someone you know? A certain politician perhaps?) etc.- it's all there. When people see him, they see themselves and revel in his loser mentality because losers love company. Winners that play the right way that actually deserve this kind of over the top reverence, like Tim Duncan, are relegated to afterthoughts. I hope this series helps move the NBA (and maybe, just maybe society) into a better place. In a world of Westbrooks, be a Lillard."
"Kevin Durant would be perfect on the Jazz, shame he'd never consider it...they just need that scorer and they'd be a top 3 finals favourite."
"People are so soft.  I'm not even an old man, I'm not even 30, so it's not like I'm going to pull a ""back in my day!"" spiel.    Sports is just infinitely cooler and more fun when this shit is happening.  I want Westbrook to be beefing with other stars.  I want Schroeder tapping his wrist because it makes Dame's shot last night THAT MUCH SICKER.  If this were a series where they are all friendly and respectful 100% of the time, that shot loses a lot of its luster, easily.    I wanna see Klay and Draymond and Curry talk shit and clown on LeBron, because then the 2016 finals when he comes back 3-1 is THAT much more epic.    I wanna see Pat Beverly talk shit on KD, because when KD goes off (even though we KNOW he's infinitely better than Beverly), it's more of a resounding ""I AM KEVIN DURANT"".    I wanna see the Celtics last year talk like they can upset 'Bron in the ECF, because then when he beats them in 7 as a one man team, and he's beating his chest after that And-1 to seal the game?  Hype city.    God damn, some people just get so soft.  I LOVE this kind of shit.  Give me it all day."
Kevin Durant signs with the Knicks
Kevin Durant signs a 5 year deal with the suns
So imagine that plus the weight of Kevin Durant being my favorite player from 2010 and being a OKC fan. If god exists he can fuck off
Followed by “Kevin Durant has agreed to sign a four year contract with the *insert team here*”
Kevin Durant to the Knicks.
"I was going to say Kevin Durant, but that All-Rookie First Team really changed my mind."
Well they feared LeBron enough to call Kevin Durant right after he beat them lol
no but they have a Kevin Durant switch
"Not saying these are better, but here are some to consider in the past 15 years or so that I think just deserve a shoutout:  &amp;#x200B;  Lebron James vs. Celtics Game 6 2018: 46/11/9 while down 3-2 in series  Lebron James vs. Warriors Game 1 2018: 51/8/8 in JR Smith game  Lebron James vs. Raptors Game 2 2018: 43/8/14 on 19/28 shooting  Lebron James vs. Celtics Game 6 2012: 45/15/5 on 19/26 shooting, down 3-2  Stephen Curry vs. Blazers Game 4 2016: 40/9/8 with 17 points in Overtime  Kevin Durant vs. Cavs Game 3 2018: 43/13/7 on 15/23 shooting  Kawhi vs Memphis Game 2 2017: 37/11/2 on 9/14 shooting with 6 steals (Grizz held to 82 pts)  Derrick Rose vs. Hawks Game 3 2011: 44/5/7 on 16/27 shooting   Dirk Nowitzki vs. Thunder Game 1 2011: 48/6/4 on 12/15 shooting, 24/24 from the line  Dirk Nowitzki vs. Suns Game 5 2006 50/12/3 on 14/26 shooting  Chris Paul vs. Utah Game 5 2018 41/7/10 with 0 turnovers  Kobe Bryant vs. Denver Game 2 2008: 49/4/10 on 16/27 shooting"
A guy named Kevin Raymone Durant left the franchise
"No, I think Steph is actually better than KD. I’m just saying, if you add Kevin Durant to a top 4 seed in either conference, they’d be likely the favorites."
"Depends on how you look at it, imo.  Kevin Durant is probably a better basketball player.  But Dame is a team leader, a guy who's easy to root for, a guy with drive.  This team doesn't exist without Dame.  There's something to that."
“Liked by easymoneysniper...” aka Kevin Durant damn
Wow what a douche-y comment. Westbrook is an MVP and guaranteed Hall of Famer. He’s been to the Finals and can fill up a stat sheet like no ever has. And this random redditor says it “not in his genes to win”. With a world view like that you must absolutely consider yourself a total loser if Westbrook isn’t a winner.   By the grace of God (and somehow not from the collective bargaining agreement) Kevin Durant left to the Warriors but he still said good things about Russ on his burner account.   Your comment blows my mind with its combination of pompousness and ignorance

"&gt; Iverson was better and smarter on the court.   No, he wasn't.  I bet you haven't watched him.  In fact that 2001 team was the best possible **type** of supporting cast for Iverson. Sure, you could probably upgrade some of those players. There were better versions of Eric Snow and Aaron McKey.   But he did get Mutombo, and the Sixers won because of their defense.   Iverson made the finals against the following opponents in the Leastern Conference:  * Celtics led by Paul ""Paul Pierce sucks"" Pierce and Toine ""cause there are no 4s"" Walker  * Vince Carter led Raptors   * Ray Allen led Bucks, featuring Glenn ""Big Dog"" Robinson  The East was a joke. The WCF was the real final, and it wasn't even close.   &gt; If you paired prime AI up with Kevin Durant or Paul George, he'd have won a ring.  Not against these Warriors. Not against Lebron-Wade-Bosh Heat. Not against Lebron-Love-Kyrie Cavs. Not even against the CP3-Harden Rockets. Not against the 2013 or 2014 Spurs."
Kevin Durant once he wins with the Knicks
"Iverson was better and smarter on the court. If you paired prime AI up with Kevin Durant or Paul George, he'd have won a ring. Dude consistently had the worst supporting cast in the league but he still managed to steal a game from the 2001 Lakers in the Finals, whereas Russ has won four playoff games since KD left. Russ has no excuse to be as selfish as he is, Iverson had no choice."
"Yeah, people forget. I like to compare him to a 6'5"" Kevin Durant."
"Biggest difference between Dame/Kobe and Russ is that Dame/Kobe want to win no matter what. I'm not sure I can say that about Russ.... or at least the guy just. doesn't. get. it.   I can guarantee that if Kevin Durant was on the Blazers, Dame would 100% make sure that KD was the big dog. Dame wants to win. He doesn't give a shit. If Kobe was on a team with KD, I'm sure that Kobe would have done whatever to win. Russ never got it. He was on a team with one of the best players of all time and you could just tell he kept thinking he was better. Now he's on a team with PG and rather than make sure that PG is getting the ball, he's out there chucking shots. He doesn't get it. I thought they traded the wrong player out of Russ and Harden when that trade went down, and we have continue to see that year after year. Harden is by far the better player."
1. Steph Curry  2. Kevin Durant  3. Klay Thompson  4. Draymond Green
"He has thrived in the Western Conference playoffs before. This was on a team with Kevin Durant though, but he was instrumental in helping OKC beat a very, very good Spurs team and if I'm remembering correctly, beat up Golden State on the glass/"
The thunder could use to bolster their roster with some star power. Maybe James Harden or Kevin Durant. Could you imagine?
Kevin Durant
"Yeah we were always here, just now our opinion gets upvoted instead of downvoted. The Russel has a low BBIQ takes exist [ever since he took shots away from the best scorer in the game](https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)."
"He was fringe top 10 before the season started (8-11 range imo), but is now clearly out of the top 12. Players I have clearly above him (roughly in order of who I would take right now):  &amp;#x200B;  1. James Harden 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. Kevin Durant 4. Stephen Curry 5. LeBron James 6. Joel Embiid 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Anthony Davis 9. Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic 11. Kyrie Irving 12. Paul George  &amp;#x200B;  I think there are a few other players that I'd take over Russ next year too like Bradley Beal or Luka Doncic and maybe even Trae Young if his improvement in the second half of the season is permanent."
"I'm too lazy to format:  * https://twitter.com/molly_knight/status/1120779576320221185  * http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/   The actions he took was playing like trash and then being rude reporters. When they can't write about of his performance and he doesn't give them anything about his personality, what else is there to write about?   Russ has a history of giving non answers, unfortunately for him ""Next Question"" is an amazing catchphrase that ESPN and TNT can take advantage of. And if a player talks and can't back it up, he's going to get clowned, that's how this works. Now that it has made national news there is also more serious discussion on how answers like ""next question"" can be damaging for the league (I prefer the athletic story but it's behind a paywall): https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/04/22/steve-kerr-calls-russell-westbrooks-treatment-media-dangerous-nba/?utm_term=.f92b0fca85d5  Also, call me crazy, but I think it's not hard for players to be respectful to the media. Russ doesn't act like that just towards Tramel, he acts like that to people like Molly Knight who wanted to write something that would benefit his brand."
Another fun fact: Kevin Durant hasn't lost a first round playoff series since 2010 when he was 20 years old in his first playoff appearance ever against the eventual champion Lakers.
"He gives basic answers to the vast majority of reporters the vast majority of times. Yeah, Tramel is a special case, but does anyone ask themselves why that is?   To borrow from another one of my posts, Tramel showed up to Thunder media day without even bothering to do any research on who the new players were. He is the hometown reporter responsible for covering them and he literally didn't 10 minutes looking up these new guys before showing up to fucking *media day* to ask them questions.  Just to be clear about how bad this was, he literally thought that Tyler Davis was Hamidou Diallo. Just so we are on the same page, [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MGXqGGlCgGs/maxresdefault.jpg) is Tyler Davis, a 6'10 260 pound center, and [this](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/06/15/hamidou_diallo_kentucky_.jpg) is Hamidou Diallo, a 6'5 200 pound shooting guard.  Also, it wasn't just an issue of him saying the wrong name on accident. He literally didn't know which one was which until other reporters stepped in to set him straight. [Here](https://youtu.be/Qw5Lcy1ChnY?t=7310) is the actual link to media day to see what I'm talking about.  The players are there to answer the media's questions and he can't even be bothered to look at a fucking picture of these guys or figure out what position they play ahead of time. That's the level of respect he has for the players, but we think Russ out of line for saying ""next question""?   As another example, look at when KD was coming back for the Collison jersey retirement. Collison said he thought it was cool that KD was coming and has gone on the record saying he thinks OKC should retire KD's jersey too. So what does Tramel tweet?  &gt; If Kevin Durant really cared about Nick Collison, he wouldn't crash Collison's jersey-retirement celebration.  Got that? Unless KD doesn't listen to Tramel over Collison, then it means that KD doesn't ""really"" care about him. What kind of bullshit accusation is that? Then Tramel will write articles about how Dude is a fucking clown, period. Shit is even worse when you read the accompanying [article.](https://newsok.com/article/5621425/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-wants-to-attend-nick-collison-night-but-is-only-trying-to-boost-his-own-image?earlyAccess=true) Just look at this fucking insanity:  &gt; Wouldn't surprise me if Durant's handlers never had any intention of him attending Collison's night but merely wanted to launch a public relations salvo in trying to rebuild Durant's image. Ask the Thunder for permission to attend, maybe the Thunder says you've got to be kidding, Durant leaks it to the press and claims the moral high ground. *See, I'm trying to be nice. It's those guys that harbor a grudge.*   We mad because Russ isn't interested in engaging with *this* fucking guy? Dude is a straight up clown and the fact that people in here (not you) that are stanning for Tramel is pretty clear proof that folks will do anything to hop on the ""Time to shit on Westbrook"" train."
"&gt; and most are largely unfazed by the changes around them.  Once again, that's my point -- most of the guys at the top of the list didn't have changes around them for the majority of their primes. To say the research shows that their numbers would have been unaffected if they played with another star in his prime flies so in the face of logic that there's either a problem with the research or how it's being applied.   At a basic level -- if you have a model that says Karl Malone is a top 5 all-time player, my takeaway is going to be there's a problem with the model, not that Karl Malone is a top 5 all-time player.   It's like looking at RPM and saying that Golden State should trade Kevin Durant for Nikola Vucevic or that Kyle Lowry is much more valuable than Kawhi Leonard."
"John wall. He’s just never had that Paul George or Kevin Durant next to him but he’s been taking his team to the playoffs for a while. Also, don’t forget John wall was making a conversation for the second  best point guard in the nba after Stephen curry in the 16-17 season."

"It think this perfectly shows the type of player he is. I don't know about you but as someone who has been playing team sports since childhood, I appreciate winners. Russell Westbrook is not a winner. It's not in his genes to win. Things like intangibles and leadership are lost on him. He tried to ruin Kevin Durant's career at every turn and by the grace of God Durant was able to expect to a team that plays *the right way*. The answer is simple, he's a trainwreck and needs to be abandoned just like a 2000 Honda that's been in an accident. Trade him for whatever you can get."
"Yes because teams stand a chance against kevin durant and steph curry. Oh theyre having a bad game? Lets just pass it to the 2nd greatest 3 point shooter of all time so he can go for 60.  If you dont think their overwhelming talent is 80% of the reason theyre as sucessful as they are nowadays, you're delusional."
I don't know much about Turkish politics but if you annoy Kevin Durant on Twitter then you automatically become one of my favorite people
We are all Kevin Durant today.  Luv u snek bby come home
"We can only offer love, respect and support to Kevin Durant for not only being a champion but burying Chokelahoma at the same time.  Luv u snek"
"Honestly you didn't even need advanced stats or some complicated kind of metric to see that. I mean Russ was shooting just as much (and sometimes even more) than Kevin ""NBA scoring champion"" Durant. They F'd up big time trading Harden (even though they probably did that because they didn't want to trade KD best buddy away)"
"Im gonna be really fucking tight when KD doesnt come to NY and every mook on here is shitting on Knicks ""HaHA whY the FUck wOUld yoU IdIOTS thinK KD wUd go to The KNICKS LOL KNICKS haha boys"".                         Cause every fucking media member from Bill Simmons to Rich Bucer to SAS say Kevin Durant wants to go the Knicks, so where only repeating information where told 50 times a day.             We know we suck, we dont know why he would want to go to the team or what parameters allow that. So stop shitting on the fucking fanbase, we heared about Lebron to LA from the same people months before it happened and it did."
Kevin Durant is more of a legend in okc but he decided to leave that’s why he’s hated. I think they liked KD more than Westbrook too when he was there.
I’m sure Kevin Durant would’ve liked to know as well
"Bro most of those are at the buzzer where they were forced to shoot from that deep.   Also, not often doesn't mean never man.   Dame and Steph legit shoot a 30 footer every single game. Dame made 7 this series alone. That's more than **Kyrie and Kevin Durant made combined this entire season**  But tell.me again that they reguarly pull up from 30 when Dame makes more in 5 games than 150 from them two."
Kevin Durant the better player but Dame is a player with more heart
"That was a shit shot.... like if I shat off a balcony, and it hit Kevin Durant in the face, the shit wouldn’t magically become a bar of gold, it’d still be shit, just accurate shit... bloody hell Dame, gotta give it to him though, beast of a player"
"The Anti-Westbrook train is leaving Oklahoma at breakneck speed, even faster than the coward Kevin Durant left in the summer of 2016. Russell Westbrook’s reputation amongst, and treatment of, members of the media has reached a zenith just as his team sits on the brink of an early postseason exit, no doubt the fault of several hatchet-faced referees, a pinheaded fanbase, and an old sack of oatmeal named Raymond Felton.  Russell Westbrook has been accused of refusing to answer questions from the media, sometimes refusing to even make eye contact. On behalf of all writers, we can barely look at ourselves in a mirror, so why should Russ have to?  Russell Westbrook is having historically bad post season stats, but it’s hard to be efficient at basketball when your hands are busy carrying Paul George, who injured himself at his second job as the inflatable man at a used car dealership, and with both of his eyes trained on Berry Tramel, who looks like if doing Whippits in the back of a 94 Dodge Ram was a person.  Even Steve Kerr has piled on, calling Westbrook’s actions “dangerous to the league.” But the only danger Steve Kerr is an expert in is getting punched in the face by Michael Jordan.  Does Russell Westbrook have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the media? Maybe, but my cousin had a contractual obligation to stay away from the local high school, and now he’s serving 3 to 5 in county. Free Hambone  Does Russell Westbrook have a moral obligation to cooperate with the media? I’m reminded of the old saying “it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown.” But only at first! Have you seen what 25 years of sadness does to the human body? My grandma is the unhappiest person I’ve ever met and her face looks like a haunted mask from an Indian burial ground. Anyway. MY POINT IS that Russell Westbrook is a smart, handsome and good player, and I say this not just because I’m a fan, but because I am financially invested in gaining access to Russel Westbrook.  If you’re reading this, Russ, I promise to write fawningly about you (triple doubles are underrated! Stat chasing is good!) unflinchingly about your enemies (Why does Pat Beverley look like he should be selling bean pies on the subway?) and most of all, I promise to never subject you to the Ramsey Bolton-esque torture of ever making direct eye contact. I love you Russ."
"Kevin Durant might get the last laugh, lmao imagine that"
“Since Kevin Durant left...” basically.
Kevin Durant punching air happily rn
Kevin Durant atm “👌🏼👌🏼”
This is why Durant left  Russell Westbrook: 29 points 11/31 shooting Paul George: 36 points 14/20 shooting  Replace George with Kevin Durants name and you have a similar statline from years back. And of course Westbrook takes the potential game winning shot instead of feeding PG

"I would like to create a petition to postpone the season of Spring over the dates April 14-April 28 and create a fifth season, called “Shit on Russell Westbrook because he can’t get out of the first round without Kevin Durant” in its place."
PSA: Still hasn't won a playoff series without Kevin Durant
Look at the shit Kevin Durant went through.  Maybe he wasn’t called over rated.  But look what Durant has gone through from fans and media.   Lebron too.   Look how they handled themselves and look at Westbrook.  No excuse
"Monty is very close with Kevin Durant, lakers want him to attract Durant   Suns on the other hand probably just throwing shit at the wall without any plan"
It seems like this is kind of how the OKC organization is though. Good read from 2014: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/
"&gt;You really think he was more criticized than Kevin Durant? I don’t think that is true at all.   Are you fucking serious right now? Yes Russ got way more criticism than Durant. What? He got all the blame for every playoff loss. KD was the golden child. The Mr Unreliable thing was literally the only major criticism he had here until he left.   &gt;Now let’s go bigger, outside of Oklahoma. Lebron?  LeBron gets praise to balance out his hate. And yeah, 2011 was brutal for him, but Russ's entire career has been criticized without much nuance outside of his MVP season.   &gt; f you would have said he has been under the scrutiny of the media and it hasn’t been fair I don’t think you would have gotten the downvotes.  I don't care about downvotes. Russ *has* gotten more criticism than LeBron in his time here. LeBron gets hot takes and he gets defended and excuses made for him all the time. Russ gets deep ""analysis"" of how bad and overrated he is. And how terrible of a human being he is for not talking to people who just want to eat him alive."
"You really think he was more criticized than Kevin Durant? I don’t think that is true at all. Now let’s go bigger, outside of Oklahoma. Lebron? That isn’t saying he isn’t highly criticized. He is. You f you would have said he has been under the scrutiny of the media and it hasn’t been fair I don’t think you would have gotten the downvotes. You said he’s the most criticized athlete of modern times I believe and that just isn’t true. Then you continue to double down.  That’s the only issue."
"Bought it for 12 mil sold it for 13.5, Kevin Durant the real estate genius."
They played great because Kevin Durant is awesome and they had another starter-level PG on the roster in Reggie. But they ran the exact same plays as always and coasted off elite talent.

Yeah okay I'll believe you over literally Kevin Durant
Yeah okay. Now if only KD hadn't already explained why he left accidentally: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-offered-an-odd-explanation-for-those-embarrassing-tweets-about-okc/.    What a fucking dumb take. Harden was not half the player he is today. And the organisation didn't choose to lose KD. They did everything they could to keep him
Nobody:  &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant: \*creates burner account\*
"you know, i hate Westbrook's game and think he's completely overrated, but I don't believe he's obligated to say *a single thing* to us or the media.  I'm a huge Marshawn Lynch fan too.  These guys are just being kind when they drop nuggets for the media IMO.  They don't *owe* us shit.  I like Westbrook's salty attitude *waay* more then I like stupid ass reporters going ""oooh kevin durant farted in a deli in new york one time!  kd2knicks CONFIRMED"", or ""rumor is matt barnes slept with so and so's wife"".  I dgaf about that stuff, it's for the birds, it has nothing to do with the game, and it cheapens the whole sport and makes everybody involved look like a bunch of helpless children if you ask me"
This is correct according to [this article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/kevin-durant-condo-sf-restaurants-hangouts-13441837.php)
brb accusing Steve Kerr and Kevin Durant of sexual harassment so they get dropped by their teams  Do you see how stupid that sounds? An accusation alone shouldn't be enough for penalization.
"The Anti-Westbrook train is leaving Oklahoma at breakneck speed, even faster than the coward Kevin Durant left in the summer of 2016. Russell Westbrook’s reputation amongst, and treatment of, members of the media has reached a zenith just as his team sits on the brink of an early postseason exit, no doubt the fault of several hatchet-faced referees, a pinheaded fanbase, and an old sack of oatmeal named Raymond Felton.  Russell Westbrook has been accused of refusing to answer questions from the media, sometimes refusing to even make eye contact. On behalf of all writers, we can barely look at ourselves in a mirror, so why should Russ have to?  Russell Westbrook is having historically bad post season stats, but it’s hard to be efficient at basketball when your hands are busy carrying Paul George, who injured himself at his second job as the inflatable man at a used car dealership, and with both of his eyes trained on Berry Tramel, who looks like if doing Whippits in the back of a 94 Dodge Ram was a person.  Even Steve Kerr has piled on, calling Westbrook’s actions “dangerous to the league.” But the only danger Steve Kerr is an expert in is getting punched in the face by Michael Jordan.  Does Russell Westbrook have a contractual obligation to cooperate with the media? Maybe, but my cousin had a contractual obligation to stay away from the local high school, and now he’s serving 3 to 5 in county. Free Hambone  Does Russell Westbrook have a moral obligation to cooperate with the media? I’m reminded of the old saying “it takes more muscles to smile than it does to frown.” But only at first! Have you seen what 25 years of sadness does to the human body? My grandma is the unhappiest person I’ve ever met and her face looks like a haunted mask from an Indian burial ground. Anyway. MY POINT IS that Russell Westbrook is a smart, handsome and good player, and I say this not just because I’m a fan, but because I am financially invested in gaining access to Russel Westbrook.  If you’re reading this, Russ, I promise to write fawningly about you (triple doubles are underrated! Stat chasing is good!) unflinchingly about your enemies (Why does Pat Beverley look like he should be selling bean pies on the subway?) and most of all, I promise to never subject you to the Ramsey Bolton-esque torture of ever making direct eye contact. I love you Russ."

"I mean this very series he had that ""I'm Kevin Durant"" quote after reacting to criticism, and he went off ever since then."
"Loyalty plays a lot into that, and you can chalk most of it up to that. Blind loyalty. We have players could choose to play for anywhere else, and for whatever reason they've chosen to play in **Oklahoma City**. That's good enough for most fans to write off some reporter getting big-timed by Westbrook. Because they're not turning on the TV to watch a reporter.   Oklahoma is lucky to have a basketball team in the first place. We wouldn't probably have one if not for a perfect storm of events like Hurricane Katrina, Clay Bennett, and the whole Seattle debacle.   In addition, we're immensely lucky to have had pretty much instant success in the NBA from drafting well. We got Harden, Ibaka, Westbrook, and Kevin Durant. Fans here, myself included, haven't had to endure shitty sports droughts. We've got the Sooners, Thunder, and now a bunch of people jumping onto the rebounding Browns bandwagon. That's why our subreddit is shit. Nobody knows the intricacies of what it takes to build anything. We just inherited it. To me it feels like very few people love the storyline of what it takes to reach success, they just want the W. That's why it sucks so much to be a Thunder fan right now, regardless of whether you are a Westbrook apologist or not. We don't know what it's like to have a bleak outlook on the future. I for one am all for whatever's next, but that's because I love basketball. I could give a shit if my team raises he banner or not - only one team does and it'll probably be the Warriors."
*Kevin Durant has left the chat.
Berry tweeted: [Kevin Durant has become Mr. Unreliable in Memphis series](https://twitter.com/berrytramel/status/461673585367478272?lang=en)  Donald Trump actually responded with: https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/462774078307573760?lang=en
"&gt; He's a notorious hater  FTFY  He hates on everyone not named Kevin Durant lol, dude is a clown and I am always astounded whenever he has positively upvoted comments"
"Dame being inefficient is definitely partly because of the shooting though. Whether right or wrong, what are you going to do when you give your teammates good look after good look and they keep missing? You're going to try and make shots yourself.  Kyrie has never been doubled by jrue and Anthony Davis lol. And he's certainly never faced anywhere near that level of defense.   Kevin Durant called it a gimmick defense. It was a hard blitz with a 3rd defender standing in the paint. You can't ""beat"" that trap because the pelicans literally did not care if our wings took open 3s."
"&gt; What he craves is LOVE and RESPECT  No, he knows he already has respect, he really just wants to make a lot of money.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2813346-kevin-durant-on-free-agency-plan-play-basketball-and-stack-money"
Kevin Love has mental health issues and said as much. CC has no actual basis to assume that about Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
Did you just actually say Blake or Cp3 are better than Kevin Durant? Lmao
"Jim Buss and Mitch were incompetent during their last 3 years and the Lakers are still feeling the affects of it. They  couldn’t get Carmelo Anthony  to come their way in the summer of 2014   Why did LaMarcus Aldridge and his reps seem so confused a year later, when the biggest free agent that summer had a second meeting with the Lakers only because the first one had been botched? Why wouldn’t Kevin Durant even grant the Lakers a meeting, after all that time in which Jim led people to believe that they had such a good chance of landing the former Oklahoma City Thunder star?   Why didn’t they sign budding stars who actually wanted to be with the Lakers, players like Isaiah Thomas and  Kyle Lowry who would go on to become All-Stars? And why, for the love of all things Lakers, did they sit on all that salary cap space in recent years only to give four-year contracts worth a combined $136 million to two players in Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng? an All-Star game in New Orleans taking place without any Lakers players for the first time since 1996 (the pressure rises still considering the 2018 All-Star festivities are in Los Angeles).  And that’s why, when Kupchak discussed a DeMarcus Cousins deal with the Sacramento Kings over that same weekend that they could have done if they’d been willing to give up  Brandon Ingram. Kupchak refused to include Ingram and now it becomes a great what-if."
"Yeah. Harden and a bunch of role players losing to Durant, Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green is such a choke job. Funny how rockets haters just twst the narrative like we were some defending champs or team that won 73 games and added Kevin Durant. Imagine if the 72 win bulls added the second best player in the league."
He beat out Kevin Durant
The Wizards **definitely** did not hire Scott Brooks in a desperate attempt to appeal to Kevin Durant.
"Yeah Westbrook basically shot Kevin out of OKC. I used to care so much about the Thunder and to this very day I completely lose my s\*\*t when I think that Westbrook used to take more shots than ""NBA scoring champion"" Durant. That's when I thought ""this guy's basketball IQ is very low"". It's really a shame beccause he plays super hard which makes it impossible for me to hate him :("
"They knew what they were getting into when they signed him to that big deal, they also knew Kevin Durant was a warrior when they signed him to it. Wouldn't you agree they'd be more desperate if he or harden were FA after the season?"
Butler: *I'm literally Jimmy.*  Kyrie: *I'm an actual genius.*  KD: *I'm Kevin Durant.*
"Why are you moving the goal posts? The warriors in 2015 were identical to the 2014 team except they played in a better system that let them use their incredible on court chemistry to give teams near impossible matchup issues.   That same team then went on to win more games than anyone else in history.  Then that same team got Kevin Durant because, as Kevin stated, he loved how they played and wanted to be apart of that culture and that chemistry.   If you look at the sixers this season they aren’t winning a championship, if they stay together though and build chemistry as a unit that could very easily be the next dominant team in the league."
That Kevin Durant guy is pretty good
Jerry West (PPG: 29.13).    Kevin Durant (PPG : 29.11).      Lmao
For the sake of information and my bias:    NBA finals PPG leaders :       Rick Barry (36.6 PPG).         Michael Jordan (33.6 PPG).      Kevin Durant (31.7 PPG).
Kevin  Durant
Kevin Durant.
"I think it's a combination of a lot of factors:  * Draymond Green is one of the best PnR defenders in the NBA.  He has a great knack for when to come up on Harden and when to drop and break up the lob  * Kevin Durant.  The Warriors starting lineup is elite defensively, and having a 7 foot SF that can quickly come in off the weakside to disrupt lobs or contest Capela is huge.  The Warriors are probably the only team that can pull this off, unless Giannis counts as a SF.  * Capela has historically struggled vs the Warriors in Oakland.  He's a borderline role player, so I'd look for him to have better energy at home.  * GS has clearly gameplanned to stop the Capela lob.  They've done a good job of stopping him with doubles when he catches the ball, forcing Capela to make a pass (which he's not great at) or try to score through back to the basket post moves, which he isn't skilled enough to do consistently."
You ever heard of Kevin Durant or Draymond Green or Andre Iguodala
"If I had to bet my life it's the 76ers.   Post scoring/size with Embiid, generally good perimeter defense and when JJ/Tobias are hot they can match Klay/Curry on 3's.   Of course the Warriors have this one dude named Kevin Durant.   Raptors aren't deep enough and the Bucks are a playing a style that the Warriors can out pace. And fuck the Celtics."
"Yeah, I think so.    If Ibaka can't defend one of Simmons or Harris, the Raptors are fucked because even if they survive the Sixers they need him to defend Horford or Giannis, and then survive switches against fucking Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.     Offensively they park Gasol/Siakam in the corners, where they theoretically can hit 3s and force Embiid/Harris out of the paint. That gives you more space to try and target JJ with Kawhi and even Ibaka, and gives you a chance to see if Lowry/Ibaka can beat Reddick/Butler in the PnR which they *should* be able to do.     Maybe none of that works, it probably doesn't. But I'd rather get my ass kicked a new way than settle in and get my ass kicked with small ball lineups again"
"You’re right he’s not Kanye cuz there can only be one Ye (and that honor may very well go to the tragically misunderstood b-ball maven that is Kevin Durant /s)...  BUT like you said, Kyrie is really fucking good, and he’s probably more deserving of the Beyoncé label since him and LBJ made for such a sexy power couple during their Cleveland bromance."
"Hes trying to make this a ""im kevin durant moment"" but failed"
"I'm sorry but is Kawhi playing with another Superstar, and 2 stars?   It's easier to play 40mins when the Opponents defensive scheme isn't entirely focused on limiting you and Dearing your teammates to beat them. And it gets 2x as difficult when you literally have to carry your Team because your teammates is so ass that the Opponents double downs on defense against you cuz they KNOW your teammates IS ASS  Kevin Durant don't have those problems. Regardless of how ""average"" Steph and Klay might be playing, no Defense in hell is stepping away from those guys. Steph can be 1-7 from 3 but no matter what, as soon as he crosses the Halfway Line, he is already being guarded.   So stop with that bullshit. Not all situations are equal."
"It is childish, it shows that his ego is way too high due to immaturity.  He is not the greatest basketball player ever, he's not even the best player in the league right now.  I'm taking Kevin Durant over Lebron all day."
Koo Koo Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is a Walking Problem for every team
" &gt; No Kevin Durant  Sees Flair, *Oh*"
"1-10 seems pretty good.. 11-25 is a bit off.. I would put Beal and Towns closer to top 15 over CP3 and Gobert.. also Irving and Embiid over Butler easily..   If I were to rank the top 35 players I would go...  1 Kevin Durant  2 LeBron James  3 Giannis Antetokounmpo  4 Kawhi Leonard  5 Stephen Curry  6 James Harden  7 Anthony Davis  8 Damian Lillard  9 Nikola Jokic  10 Joel Embiid  11 Paul George  12 Kyrie Irving  13 Karl-Anthony Towns  14 Jimmy Butler  15 Blake Griffin  16 Klay Thompson  17 Bradley Beal  18 Rudy Gobert  19 Russell Westbrook   20 Kemba Walker  21 Devin Booker  22 Victor Oladipo  23 LaMarcus Aldridge  24 Donovan Mitchell  25 Ben Simmons  26 Al Horford  27 DeMar DeRozan  28 Luka Doncic  29 Jrue Holiday  30 Mike Conley  31 D'Angelo Russell  32 Pascal Siakam  33 CJ McCollum  34 Tobias Harris  35 Chris Paul  &amp;#x200B;  Mentions.. Nurkic, Vucevic, Lou Will, LaVine, Randle, Middleton, Green"
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo
Durant got 38 in the first half when the Clippers got nailed because he is Kevin Durant but also because Kerr knew he wanted to and let him go for it. If the Raps are going to win this it's going to be out of epic heroball performances from Kawhi and 30 points won't cut it.
Lebron has one the most impressive playoffs last year. The point was no team can win with no other all star. Kyle Lowry is an all star the way Kevin love was so he is not getting as much focus as kawhi/lbj.   If a team only has one all star they get constantly doubled and that affects their shooting which in turn stalls the offense since there is not another option to defer to. Lebron dragged a team to finals but eventually lost to Durant who had two other all stars so He had more free reign on the offensive end than lebron ever had last year. That’s more impressive than what Durant has been doing. And maybe KD is the better player right now but we won’t know until he leads a team on his own like lebron did
Kevin Durant joined the Warriors a month after he and the Thunder blew a 3-1 lead to them
Kevin Durant joined the team that he blew a 3-1 lead to
Kevin Durant  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Anthony Davis  All of these men care to differ
"you have to look at things in the context of how the game was played at the time. In Iverson's MVP season, the league average TS% was 51.8%. Iverson's was 51.8%. For reference, this season, league average TS% was 56.0%. AI was also 2nd in the league in steals. When has Melo ever been top 20 in anything other than PPG?  AI wasn't James Harden or Steph Curry or Kevin Durant. But he was fine in terms of efficiency, and while I think the argument about teammates and role is way overused, those 6ers teams during AI's peak were engineered to fit him. It was 11 defensive specialists and then Iverson took care of the offense. Scoring all those points out of isolation makes it a lot tougher to be efficient, but it was the 6ers' best option.  Moreover, Iverson's fame was only partly a product of his on-court productivity. His story, his fashion, his style of play, his size... all of these made him far more interesting than his production on the court would have done on its own.  If the MVP award was solely based on a player's greatness on the court, the MVPs that went to Iverson, Rose and at least one of the ones that went Malone and Nash would have belonged to someone else. Even Kobe's MVP in 07/08 probably should have gone to Chris Paul, who had an incredible season."
Not really. Kevin Durant can get any shot at anytime. In these playoffs he’s leading the warriors averaging 30+
&gt;Joel Embiid joins Kevin Durant  Fine we'll take them both.
"1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry (I know he’s not playing the best, but if his team didn’t have 4 all stars he’d probably be scoring a lot more) 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden (I don’t like him as a player, but he’s a good player) 6. Giannis"
I rank them as  1) LeBron James  2) this dude Jacob Strain that whipped my ass from Hillside in high school  3) Kevin Durant
If walking Skeleton aren’t real explain Kevin Durant.
"Not looking for an argument here, I just don't really get your point. It's like saying ""it's so weird how Kevin Durant just picked up a basketball one day and started playing when nobody asked him to. just so strange."" It's like.. what are you even trying to say? lol"
Kevin Durant started yelling at the refs a lot. They started fearing for their lives and have been calling games like morons for the last 2 seasons.
"No knock on Kevin Durant, but Kawhi is definitely playing on his level or even better this playoffs from an offensive point of view. Points are there...but his efficiency is off the charts."
"Pretty good, but they'll be getting carried by 3x Finals MVP Kevin Durant."
I was so annoyed that he didnt know James Harden from Kevin Durant lol
"Feel bad for him... the dude’s playing THE best basketball within the rules, gets beat up night in night out... gets raked in the eyes... People are still shitting on his comments about officiating?!  The reason there’s officiating is to PROTECT the players... not just oh, he travelled, oh stepped out of bounds...  PRIORITY should be the players, then rules of the game... refs this year are too busy noticing all the lame shit like 0.2 second late jab step dribbles... shoes hovering over the line... rather than players getting beat up through many different things like moving screens and actual fouls  I understand the need to catch travelling etc and I’m not against it at all! But sometimes I wonder if the refs are too busy watching the game as opposed to doing their jobs... like serious...  Maybe they need a headset with the guys on TV screens giving the calls... since it seems so much easier for the fans and viewers to see said fouls on screen...  Like how do you miss a guy the length of Kevin Durant... WAY outside the baseline, trying to save a ball heading out of bounds... ball was there... dude is lengthy AF... 🤦🏻‍♂️  For the enjoyment of this sport I think officiating definitely needs to improve in this game for it to be more enjoyable..."
"“...Kevin Durant, you know...the guy with the big long beard”"
bro i will squeeze the living *kevin durant* outta you
Kevin durant is tmac lite
"I'm really starting to think you didn't read any of this lol.  &amp;#x200B;  ""In addition, Kevin Durant is clearly surrounded by better teammates. As good as the Raptors have been this year, I admit that the team with ~~5~~ 4 all-stars has a better team surrounding KD than what Kawhi has. In the game he scored 50 on the Clippers, Curry was getting double-teamed at half court while he was left in single coverage against a Clippers team with zero All-Stars. (This is a common theme these last 2-3 years; defenses focus almost exclusively on Curry and never seem to make any real adjustments for KD, but that's a story for a different post :) )On the other hand, Kawhi is being double- and triple- teamed by elite defenses, and manages to convert extremely difficult looks nontheless.""  &amp;#x200B;  ""And I haven't even mentioned defense once. A locked in Kawhi Leonard is still the best defender on the planet. He expends way more energy on the defensive end, as the duo of Kawhi and Siakam often pick up the best offensive players on the floor and lock them down. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant is nowhere near that level. He gets blocks but that's honestly about it. He's honestly not a bad defender, but he's above average at best. This pales in comparison to Kawhi and won't be enough to earn him the title of best player in the world. KD is surrounded by elite defenders like Klay, Draymond, Iggy, and Looney and is able to expend all of his energy on the offensive end, yet is still not on the level of Kawhi Leonard""  &amp;#x200B;  This is Skip Bayless levels of cringe"
"You should start watching the NBA if you think the Magic weren't an excellent defensive team.  &gt; Also, if you have been watching the NBA, you would know that undersized defenders actually give KD the most trouble.  He's Kevin Durant and you're making excuses about him having trouble with a 6 foot Patrick Beverly? Oh God."
KD has played great. Like a top 5 player on an ungaurdable team with a ton of weapons. Hes had some mediocre games and some fantastic games. The desperate attempt to crown someone as the next guy because LeBron isn't in the playoffs is really transparant and it's disrespecful to the other great players including Kawhi.   &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant is fantastic and is playing like Kevin Durant. I don't really see some ascension happening though. They were circle jerking him the other night for 24/5/4  on 9/22.  The very few times LeBron has performed like that in the playoffs he has been grilled and yeah for some reason KD is praised? KD obviously deserves praise for his Game 6 performance but the microscope  on his medicore (by superhuman/LBJ/KD standards) games isn't even comparable to the way LeBron's sub par games were analyzed.
"Slight Disclaimer: My list FAVOURS playoff performances (although that's not ALL that matters, it's worth more to my PERSONAL rankings than regular season)  1) LeBron James  2) Kawhi Leonard  3) Kevin Durant  4) James Harden  5) Steph Curry  6) Giannis Antetokounmpo  7) Joel Embiid  8) Anthony Davis  9) Damian Lillard  10) Nikola Jokic  Honorable Mentions: Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Kyrie Irving, Russell Westbrook, Kemba Walker"

"right, because the scoring title is most points per game, not who scored the most total points.   Kevin Durant scored more points than Melo during the regular season. Melo played less games. Melo scored more points per game. Melo won the scoring title, but KD ""led the league in scoring"" that year regardless."
"Wait, what?   In 2013, KD actually led the league in scoring, Melo just played less games. KD scored more points.   In 2016, Russ really took a step forward, plus we had Serge taking more shots, and Dion Waiters taking more shots.   KD won't win another scoring title ever if he stays in Golden State. But I assume this post is just to take a shot at Russ (with the ""higher b-ball iq"" quip).   It should be noted, that Kevin Durant won *all* of his scoring titles with Russ. It also goes to note, that Russell Westbrook to Kevin Durant was the most assisted bucket in the nba *for years*.   so basically: fuck off with this shit."
Ill go the opposite direction.   Kevin durant doesnt deserve a ring.    Hed be another barkley if he didnt take advantage of a cap spike to hop on the title favorites who already won a ring.
yes you drafted 3 out of 4. BUT THAT 4 IS FUCKING KEVIN DURANT
"Kerr has been saying it , he knows Steph isn’t offended and that’s what is great about him.   From 2017:   &gt;""If I worried about it, I wouldn't say it (laughter),"" Kerr told Lowe. ""That's the beauty of Steph -- he doesn't take that stuff personally. He understands it. Steph is one of the great players in the world. Two-time MVP, incredibly dominant in terms of the way he impacts the game.  &gt;""But you're talking about Kevin Durant at 6'11"" protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do."" &gt;**""There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD,"" Kerr explained.

"LeBron has been the best for so long because no one else has done anything more impressive than him in the postseason in that span of 8 straight Finals.  Even when he's lost we would still characterize him as the best in the league.  Is he the best anymore, no.  Is Kevin Durant the best right now? Maybe.  But Kevin Durant will never even sniff the top 10 even if he wins 10 titles with the Warriors."
"""Anthony Puccio has told Anthony Puccio marquee free agents like Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard &amp; Tobias Harris will consider Brooklyn when making a decision this summer."""
"No you don't understand! NY will just sign a bunch of ring chasers! /s  Except that Golden State and Clevland both went to 5 consecutive finals and the Warriors have been slowly haemorrhaging depth.   Their best cheap FAs over the course of their dominance have been: Zaza, Swaggy P, Quinn Cook (who was a g-league diamond in the rough) and Jonas Jerebko.   The Cavs were never really able to find that bench playmaker Lebron wanted and were excited when they got Crowder in a trade because it meant they finally had someone who could give Lebron some rest.     The ring chasing pool is super barebones and nowhere near as viable as people think. Even if you do sign someone, ring-chasers are ring-chasers for a reason (see Houston with Melo). You're mostly relying on buyout guys and guys who couldn't sign proper contracts in the off-season. You're almost never finding starting-level guys.  NY with Kyrie and Durant is literally a two-man team that will look like a worse version of Cleveland.  Cleveland| Knicks ---|--- Lebron | KD - Amazing player but a downgrade of Lebron Kyrie | Kyrie - Kyrie Love| Knicks Pick - Best case, even if you are getting a Doncic/Mitchell level rookie, that translates to an inconsistent/inefficient 17-20 points with room for improvement on the defensive end. Young guys need time to develop. Kevin Love was better than that. Thompson | Robinson - Someone who looks good on a team trying to lose. Tied for 5th in the league for fouls per36. NY will struggle to give him any serious minutes come playoffs. Thompson is the higher end of expectations for him in his second season. JR | Frank/DSJ - somehow another downgrade    The successful examples of star-FA signings joining to form a super team (Ray/KG to Boston, KD to GSW, Bron to Miami, etc) have all involved the stars joining teams that already had solid foundations. The get rich quick schemes rarely work out.   Horford joining the 48-win Celtics had a bigger impact than Lebron joining the 35-win Lakers.  KD to Brooklyn makes a better team than KD and Kyrie to NY."
IS THAT KEVIN DURANT ? GOD IT IS INDEED KEVIN DURANT
"No wonder Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant wanted to play in Golden State"
"In actually answering the question, no, what Kevin Durant and the Warriors are doing is not considered evasion of any sort by the NBA.  First, I'd like a quick point of clarification. A ""super max"" contract is one that is allows a player to sign for a higher percentage of the salary cap before they would traditionally be able to. Kevin Durant will have 12 years of service, thus is already eligible for the absolute maximum salary allowable under the CBA: 35% of the salary cap.  Quickly running through each of the contracts:  2016: Golden State renounces their rights to Harrison Barnes, as well as trading Andrew Bogut's contract to Dallas in order to open up the cap space necessary to sign Kevin Durant. Durant signs a 1+1 for $26.5M that first season (the maximum allowable amount in 2016-17)  2017: Kevin Durant opts out of the second year of his first 1+1 with Golden State and chooses to take a small pay cut, signing a second 1+1 with the Warriors with a first year starting salary of $25M. Golden State is allowed to use a form of Bird Rights (Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agents, or Non-Bird) to sign Durant, despite them being over the cap at the time.  2018: Durant opts out again, signing a third 1+1, this time with a starting salary of $30M. To do this, Golden State uses a different form of Bird Rights (in this case, Early Bird) in order to grant him the $5M raise (Early Bird starting salaries are restricted to the greater of either 175% of their previous salary or 105% of the league average salary from the previous season, whichever is greater, as long as they do not exceed the maximum allowable salary).   Nothing Warriors have done these past three seasons have been evading the cap in anyway. The only thing that Kevin has done is save Joe Lacob some cash from luxury tax payments."
You know who he is ~~Kevin Durant.~~ Steve Kerr.
"I have not seen a single internal source point to Kevin Durant wanting to leave the Warriors. Everyone talks as if there's a decent chance of him leaving, but they all stem from the fact that they *think* Kevin Durant accepts the commonly held view around the NBA that his rings won with the Warriors all have asterisks beside them.  Kevin Durant doesn't believe that. He came out with the Players' Tribune article saying this was the hardest road. He was on Jimmy Kimmel and when asked about him taking the easier road to a championship he said ""it's always a struggle"".  He's in denial about his situation, and he doesn't see his decision to leave OKC as a copout. That's why he feels misunderstood by everyone - he thinks he just made a smart decision to join a good basketball team, despite the reality being he left a great team in Oklahoma to join the 73-9 Warriors who defeated him the playoffs prior.  To reiterate, Kevin Durant leaving hinges on Kevin Durant viewing his rings as illegitimate *to some degree*. Whilst most in the NBA would agree, Kevin Durant does not. He's not going to leave."
You know who he is. He’s Kevin Durant.
"Per cbafaq:  &gt; Player options once were used as a way to give the player more money. The team and player agreed to a long-term deal with a player option after the player obtained full Bird rights (which used to be after one season). The player invoked the option, became a free agent, and then signed a new contract for more money using the Bird exception. However they mostly closed this loophole by making Bird rights ramp-up over three seasons, and by allowing options only on the last year of a contract. The most common usage today is for a player to change teams by signing a two-year contract, with the second year being a player option. In this case the second season acts as an insurance policy, and the player opts-out after the first season (unless he suffers a severe injury). He then signs another of these ""1+1"" contracts as a non-Bird free agent, receiving a 20% raise. He can then either play both years under this contract and enter free agency with full Bird rights, or opt-out again and repeat the process. Both LeBron James (re-signing with Cleveland) and Kevin Durant (Golden State) used this ""1+1"" strategy when changing teams.   http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q57"

It’s bad when you compare it to pre Kevin Durant warriors bench. That team was actually enjoyable to watch
I mean did you intentionally skip ahead? Because go back 30 seconds and they thought it was Kevin Durant. Dude literally doesn't even know who he's talking about
"That's true to an extent.     However, I think the Warriors are greater than the sum of their parts. The Warriors seem unbeatable because all the pieces fit together so perfectly.  The only two players who blow you away with individual talent are Durant and Curry. The rest of the players are really good at what they do, but are limited in some capacity (i.e. Thompson's playmaking, and Green and Iguodola's shooting). On other teams in different roles, we're not talking about how their presence makes this enormous difference. In Golden State though, their skills just perfectly fit around Curry and KD.  I don't know... I think even the people who say that KD's legacy took a hit by joining the Warriors don't realize to what extent winning those championships and Finals MVPs will better his resume in the longterm.  Imagine he stayed in OKC with Russ and didn't win anything for the last 3 years. We'd ""respect"" him more I guess, but we would have never seen him dominate in the Finals. We would have never seen how his presence made a great team completely unbeatable.  It's just hard to imagine a world in which 20 years from now, a Kevin Durant without any championships is viewed more positively than a Kevin Durant who three-peated, won 3 Finals MVPs, and played on possibly the greatest team ever.  All that said... as an impartial basketball fan, I also hope he leaves Golden State. I would love to start an NBA season without knowing who's going to win at the end. The Warriors now are awesome to watch in that they might possibly be the best team every assembled. However it also kind of sucks knowing that every time they lose, it's much more because the Warriors played poorly than the other team played well."

"Yea seriously. As much as I hate Kevin Durant for going to the Warriors and robbing us of a Cavs-Warrior rivalry, it would be pretty stupid if he left. I mean he is arguably on the most talented team in the history of the sport.  If they stick together, they likely will win a few more championships.  They will break records and become legends - maybe not individually - but as a team they will be remembered.  Kinda silly to think he would walk away from that."

You'd be surprised at how deals are made. It's not all about money. The benefit of having KD as an investor is not his investing expertise.  Lots of other potential investors will come to a pitch meeting just to meet Kevin Durant. He gets favorable terms but has to be in SF for the meeting.
kevin durant plays defense.
"And they'd near-certainly make more without him.  Look at it this way: One of the credible arguments for ""Kevin Durant should not go to the Knicks"" is *Dolan*. If KD doesn't - and God in heaven I hope he doesn't, because if he leaves Golden State I still want him to be happy and he wouldn't be - people will legitimately be able to look at the situation and say: ""They might've got KD, if not for Dolan."""

He’s an MVP, and 3 time runner up MVP, and an absolute terror on the offensive end. Maybe the *best* ever on the offensive end. It was never a slant against his talent. It’s *because* he was so damn good, that made the move to GSW the weakest move by a superstar ever."

"He doesn’t care about a little bit more money. As he said, he’s Kevin Durant. The whole “hardest road” thing has clearly gotten to him, because he’s human, and joining a team like the Knicks would be in hopes of proving that he can go on a real run on a non 73-win team. It’s something that would elevate his stays and probably means more to him than winning 4 championships in a row vs 3."

I love Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
Warriors sweep in the WCF while missing Kevin fucking Durant. Hilarious.
It's partially because of Curry's ability that the other players are hall of famers in the first place. The fact that teams gameplan to double him basically once he crosses half court generates wide open look after wide open look for the other players. Opponents would rather let Kevin Durant take wide open midrange shots than let Curry gets single defense coverage.  I don't see an effect to that degree with Kawhi and the raptors.
As long he isn’t back for the 2019-2020 season I don’t give a shit.  I love Kevin durant
Well not every championship team has a Tim Duncan or Kevin Durant taking paycuts. Some teams are put in impossible positions where they’re damned if they do damned if they don’t.

"&gt;Constantly? Barkley and Frazier? Who else?  Shaq, Pierce, Rose. Every national media pundit pretty much acknowledges that his rings don't hold the same weight as his contemporaries because it wasn't as difficult. It's pretty much acknowledge universally that Kevin Durant's rings have asterisks. This has to be his burner account.   &gt;Uhh. No... just... no  I meant after, but that's neither here nor there. Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson are more famous than KD is worldwide because they were marketed more. KD has the same visibility of every superstar post-jordan. He's not even the most visible or biggest star on his team, Steph's a way bigger personality from a marketing standpoint.   &gt;Just stop. You think Chris Broussard has talked to “most nba players” ..that’s funny man. Chris Broussard is infamous for reporting false information and having bad sources. The dude sucks. As mark Cuban said “my sources say he’s an idiot  Broussard was the one of the first people to report on the Heatles. He was one of the first people to report on KD to GS Rumors. Yeah. I'm sure. Mark Cuban also ran an organization rampant with rape and sexual harassment. I don't think he's the end all be all when it comes to ""reputable"" sources considering who he's hired and what he's turned a blind eye too.   &gt;I disagree and anyone that calls him a “snake” is just childish. And It’s totally arguable. People in general are not going to remember a “3-1 lead in the WCF of 2016” 20 years from now. If they’re gonna remember that then they should damn well remember that 73 win warriors team was the first in nba history to lose the finals after being up 3-1  People remember the Red Sox coming back against the Yankees. People remember the Miracle on Ice. People remember the 27-3 Blown lead of the Falcons, just like they remember the Giants coming back on the patriots and the Warriors coming back on the Thunder. People will remember the Warriors blowing a 3-1 lead and its a big reason why many entertain the LeBron is GOAT convo when they wouldn't before.   &gt;Again, yeah they can. That 73 win team didn’t win the championship. The ultimate goal. Regular season records are great but they failed to win when it mattered most. That’s why people say the 72 win bulls were a better team because they actually won the championship that year.  ""Who had the best regular season record in the history of the NBA"" The 2016 Warriors. They lost to LeBron with controversy. That accomplishment is more of a feather in LeBron's cap than it is a ding against the Warriors team, because no team has ever won 73 games. You can say the Bulls were better, but it doesn't change the fact that Kevin Durant went to a 73-9, championship team, who won 67 games the year before they went 73-9. Sorry, buddy.   &gt;Jesus man. Peoples opinions change over time. Lebron was shat on and everyone was saying he would never win a championship and that he won’t take the last shot. That narrative is gone.  Because LeBron disproved that narrative. There is nothing that is going to change about Kevin Durant joining a 73-9 win team where he couldn't be double teamed and wasn't the most important player on his team, especially if they win a title without him... again. LeBron gave us new information to assess and some of the most clutch moments in NBA history. Is the NBA going to go back and erase the 2015 and 2016 seasons? Because KD joined a 73 win team with the back to back mvp, second greatest shooter ever, a DPOY and the perfect system. His titles aren't as impressive due to that support system.   &gt;Kobe was acquired of rape for Christ’s sake. People rarely mention that anymore And for a while it was he can’t win without Shaq. 2 rings later and the way most people view Kobe is totally different than what the consensus was in 2006.  What does rape have to with basketball? You do understand that in every one of your  examples there was something that Kobe/LeBron did to change the narrative right? It didn't just ""change"" Kobe went and won two rings. LeBron went and won 3, with 3 of the top 10 finals performances ever.   KD can never change the narrative that he joined a 73-9 win team because there will never be any new information about him joinng a 73-9 team. He did it. That's not changing. On July 4th, 2016 KD joined the GS Warriors who were off a 73-9 season and 67 win season and a title the year before that. There is nothing he can do to change that the way Kobe can win without Shaq or LeBron can prove he's clutch.   This is KD's burner account. Enjoy your time NY never winning a title without another MVP caliber player."
It's bizarre you think it's certain the Warriors will make the finals next year and it's weird you think they will sweep the Bucks.  Even if Kevin Durant plays that series is not a foregone conclusion and if he doesn't play it's totally up in the air.
"When he **beat** Durant.  let me say that again.  He **LITERALLY BEAT KEVIN DURANT**.  Do not get fooled by the fact that he decided to take a back seat because KD is a safer offensive option. Just because you are the safer option doesn't make you a better overall player. Shawn Livingston's offensive mid range jump shot once looked more reliable than any other shot in the league (I'm talking about years ago).Would you say Livingston was better than Curry? No.  ""Overall player"" encompass a lot of things and Curry is currently, imo, the better overall player."
The Toughest Highway | by Kevin Durant | the Players' Tribune
"do you think curry would have 3 rings if his team mates were kevin love and jr smith instead of draymond green, klay thompson, and kevin durant?"
"No one can blame the front office for signing a player like KD. Like you said if you can get Kevin Durant, you do it. My problem is with the KD going to the Warriors after he blew a 3-1 lead to them. I don't have an issue with the Warriors, just KD"
"Even after getting Durant you shouldn't have a problem with them. Have a problem with him if you want, but do you expect a team to **not** sign freaking Kevin Durant because of principle?"
"Slitheriest, Kevin Durant"
"&gt; The fact the team that went 73-9 didn’t want to just run it back and prove that they could beat Lebron just means they didn’t think they could.  This is ridiculous. If you have the ability to add Kevin Durant, you do it. The Cavs would've done the same thing if they could've, even after winning."
1a. Michael Jordan  1b. Stephen Curry  2.Kevin Durant  3.Kobe Bryant
Kevin Durant
I think both teams would've been evenly matched both years without injuries or suspensions. It stinks that everyone wants to put an asterisk next to both teams 'chips. If only we would've gotten a proper 3rd matchup with both teams healthy and no Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is going to have a bad day.
He can't be in the GOAT conversation without multiple FMVPs. If he wins without KD this year and plays well that'll start the conversation of putting in that top tier echelon.   It's also about peaks and careers. Peak Steph Curry is a top 5 player ever. But he's not the GOAT because Prime Jordan was unstopabble on both ends of the floor and if he was in this era he would absolutely shoot 3s at a high clip.  Steph is underrated and I think he's potentially the best in the NBA (at the very worst he's 3rd) but he can't ever be the best unless he's winning without Kevin Durant again.
"The Warriors ain't got no chance of winning without Kevin Durant. Aint=negative, no = negative. Negative+negative= positive the warriors ~~aint~~ got ~~no~~ chance of winning without Kevin Durant"
There is still absolutely no way that the warriors are getting past the blazers without Kevin Durant
"You asked about holding Steph accountable. I said I I do. Now what does that do for your argument?   You asked if I give Shaq and Kobe credit for their rings when they were clearly second options. I stated I don't hold those rings as the ones with finals MVPs. Now what?   You told sure to put an asterisk on those, and then failed to respond to every point about KD, especially the one how it is *Impossible to key on him on defense in GS's offensive* and how unlike every other superstar who has won finals MVPs, he hasn't faced double teams and stout defensive game plans focused around stopping him. The clippers gave him fits when they made him the focus.   I also mentioned how Steph has more impact on the league and the Warriors than KD do.  I'm getting real tired of answering your questions for you not respond once their answered.   &gt;I personally think Kareem is the GOAT but in general it seems that big men aren’t looked upon as skilled as perimeter players  This is has nothing to do with what we're talking about.  &gt;The warriors probably don’t get out of the first round last year without Kevin Durant  &gt;Unless you think Klay, Draymond, Igoudala looney and Livingston could take down the spurs  The results would've been the same if Steph was their and KD wasn't, considering the Spurs were a 7th seed last year and Kawhi was hurt.   ""Take down the spurs."""
"A lot of people consider Russell to be right up there as the GOAT but the fact is there were like 8 teams back then and there also isn’t a ton of footage to see him play and if you weren’t around you don’t know how good he was.    I personally think Kareem is the GOAT but in general it seems that big men aren’t looked upon as skilled as perimeter players    The warriors probably don’t get out of the first round last year without Kevin Durant   Unless you think Klay, Draymond, Igoudala looney and Livingston could take down the spurs"
It's hard to say that when you really won on My 1 championship without Kevin Durant. KD botched SC legacy abit.
I'll take one Kevin Durant and 8 Carmelo Anthonys with that money please
Chris Paul wasn’t hurt this year... you didn’t miss twenty-seven 3’s in s row... Kevin Durant was out... you had home court advantage...  What happened there?
Lol comparing our getting pau gasol in a trade to getting fucking kevin durant for free
I love Kevin Durant.
"Not sure what you're getting at. Kevin Durant (top 3 player) joined the 73-9 championship team that beat him in order to win easy rings.   That 73-9 team had already proved themselves without him. They have nothing to prove, as they have already proven themselves. Kevin Durant hopped on their bandwagon. KD needs them. Not the other way around.    Hope this clears things up"
The asterisks are reserved for Kevin Durant. No one blames your team for drafting properly. They blame the top player that lost to you and joined you after he decided it was too hard
"What the fuck does Damian Lillard have to do with anything?  &gt;Imagine how many elite players GS has played going to five straight finals.... LBJ played 4 in eight years total. GS has played at least 5 every year the past 5 years. East was garbage.  Please tell me how a team like the OKC Thunder this year which has 2 ""elite players"" but plays objectively awful basketball and got destroyed by a severely depleted Blazers team makes the West so incredibly tough?   It's not always just about the number of all NBA players.   The 2013 and 2014 Pacers had historically good defensive numbers relative to the league but they didn't have elite players by your definition so they are trash?   A team that was already among the favorites to win the championship adding a top 3 player in the league is literally a 100% guarantee to make the finals. They had one challenge last year in the Rockets that matched up well with them and actually took them to the brink of losing. Every other team was so severely outmatched that it's just not a big deal they have made all these finals.  LeBron has faced adversity mainly through injuries of his teammates (2012, 2015) and ineptitude of the roster in 2018. 3 years where he absolutely willed the teams to win despite a lot of things going against him.  Please tell me how adding Kevin Durant in his prime to the winningest team in NBA history is not stacking the deck in your favor to the highest degree."
I am so shocked the team with the best record ever ads Kevin Durant and still wins all the titles. And the LeBron decides to hang it out. Unreal.
Kevin Asterisk Durant
The Warriors never faced as much of a challenge as LeBron did in 2015 or 2018.   Especially after adding Kevin Durant.
I hope Kevin Durant joins the Knicks.
"You're being a little disingenuous, no? We're talking about Kevin Durant joining the Warriors here man. Not minor changes. At least, that's what I'm talking about."
"What the fuck's with that ""asterisk"" story. He was an important part of the best team. How does it exactly result in ""asterisk"" next to the fact that he has won NBA championships. You can say ""asterisk"" shit about Chris Boucher, 2018 NBA Champion, not Kevin Durant."
"The warriors didn’t need Kevin Durant, they just needed him to not be on the thunder.🤡🤡"
"But it almost feels like the Kevin Durant show, similar to the Harden Show in Houston. Admittedly with less flopping, but similar idea. Everybody knows what's going to happen and nobody can do anything about it. It's just not a very fun game to watch when you have a team trying to guard Curry, Klay, AND then the third poor guy has to guard KD. Like, what are you really expecting from that dude, you know?"
"Imagine buying a Kevin Durant jersey LMFAO. you taking it to coachella and banging thots in that bro, or just killing yourself?"
"It depends.  Basically:  Without Kevin Durant, the Warriors *at their best* are better than their best without KD.  But their bad games are a *lot worse*. Durant evens them out at a higher average."
Don’t let facts get in the way of a good Fuck a Kevin Durant
Finals MVP Andre Iguodala and 2xFinals MVP Kevin Durant make a Big 5 actually. thanks for pointing that out.
"LeBron also leaves teams in virtual shambles than when he was there  Look up the top minutes played of the Heat his last year there and then even just his first year gone. They go from minutes leader being LeBron to minutes leader being Luol Deng?  When the Heatles formed it was centered around LBJ (who left) Wade who was pretty widely accepted to be slowing down, and Bosh who was basically 80 games away from retiring due to health issues.   Of course when you go from a team that is LeBron then role players of JR smith, jeff green, kevin love, kyle korver to a team that's best uninjured player at the end of the season is probably Colin Sexton you're going to see a pretty dramatic drop  OKC is doing ""just about as well as he did when he was there"" (outside of the fact that they lost in the first round every single year since he left) by replacing Durant with Dipo, then Paul George, and keeping Westbrook in his prime, Adams as the centerpiece. The LeBron equivalent would be like if Westbrook played like 30 games and now Steven Adams is the best offensive option"
"The Warriors were missing 2017 All-Star Starter DeMarcus Cousins, 2014 MVP Kevin Durant, and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala.  The Blazers basically conceded game 1 through awful pick-and-roll coverage that involved leaving Steph Curry open to shoot 3-pointers. Steph is the greatest shooter of all time, and legitimately the last basketball player in history that you should leave open.  In game 2, the Blazers went up 17. In game 3, they went up 18. In game 4, 17 again. Each of those games, the Blazers lost. Going up double digits and losing isn't good. Doing it repeatedly is awful.  A disclaimer: This is my explanation of other people, not necessarily my own opinion. There are mitigating factors that aren't all explained - namely, the Blazers were dealing with injury problems of their own to key players."
"I feel like even if he goes 0/70, defenses aren't going to sag off and let Kevin Durant shoot like they did Harrison Barnes."
"I wonder how they measured it. The NBA never lists MJ.  2019 NBA.com list - https://www.nba.com/article/2019/04/25/top-merchandise-jersey-sales-2018-19-season-official-release   Top 15 Most Popular NBA Jerseys: 1.

Jimmy Butler, Philadelphia 76ers"
"I would have Curry over Durant. The Warriors accomplishments are based on his tremendous and revolutionary play. Kevin Durant purely jumped on and added a cheat code. But Kevin Durant couldn't carry OKC to a win. Greatness isn't purely defined in a vacuum. You must view it holistically. Steph may not have the best physical attributes, but his impact I think can put him in the top 10 one day"
"Because they blew a third 17 point 2nd half lead while the warriors were missing Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, and Andre Iguodala"
"You know, I may be tired of seeing the Warriors win and win again.  But I just can't bring myself to hate on Curry, Green and their coach Steve Kerr. Like honestly they don't have egos at all. Kerr is a class act.  And Curry is an amazing player, and also Green is from my hometown too and he seems really down to earth.  Still don't like Kevin Durant, but these Warriors are showing just how good they are without him.  Sorry Bucks and Raptor fans, you are not going to win a Championship this year."
LOOOOL nooo it isn't.  I love Iguodala. Great player. Extremely impactful.  He isn't Kevin Durant.
"My rankings right now. I believe players like Lebron and AD (possibly Giannis, Kahwi, Westbrook, etc.) will probably go up next season after proving themselves again  Tier 1:  1. Kevin Durant  2. Steph Curry  3. Giannis Antetokounmpo  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. Lebron James  6. James Harden  Tier 2:  7. Nikola Jokic  8. Joel Embiid  9. Anthony Davis  10. Damian Lillard  11. Kyrie Irving  12.

"Yeah, he's got MJ first, Kevin Durant 2nd so he'll keep coming on his podcast, and Jalen Rose 3rd because they're best friends"
"So would a healthy Kevin Durant, andre Iguodala, and DeMarcus cousins"
"The obvious members of the top ten players club:   Kawhi Leonard  Giannis  Kevin Durant  Steph  James Harden  Lebron James  Those are the 6 best basketball players on the planet.  There is a drop-off after them to the next tier.    There are lots of players you could argue for to finish out the top ten.  I think Paul George, Dame, Anthony Davis and Embiid are the rest of the top 10.  Kyrie Irving's disastrous two years in have to be counted against him.  If I had to pick a 11th player, it would be Jokic.  He WILL be a top 10 player by next year, he's really good."
Good thing the Warriors will get Kevin Durant and possibly DeMarcus Cousins for the finals!!
1. Stephen Curry 2. Giannis Antekoumpo 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Lebron James 5. James Harden 6. Kevin Durant 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Joel Embiid 9. Draymond Green 10. Anthony Davis
"I think Draymond and Giannis are gonna make solid arguments over KD even if he plays all four games, but I think if Kevin Durant misses 1 game he can still play well enough to get the MVP"
Says the guy with a Kevin Durant flair lol
To a team down kevin durant and demarcus cousins
"That’s a fun thought. Imagine starting McKinney and Looney so that your bench is Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, Cousins, and FMVP Andre Iguodala."
"Klay is prett cool, pretty good, but yeahh.. Hey guys, let's have a moment here where we share personal hobbies that others could enjoy too.  I can go ahead and start with my go-to choice if I'm looking for a thrill or need to cheer up.  I prefer to type Kevin Durant into my browser of choice and just unwind and takes notes, not of his basketball skills(which we could write a book about, let's be honest) but his pure go-getter, respect magnet way of living.  I've found that Kevin,  if presented with low hanging fruit(just throwing out a random example) Kevin would climb the tree and place that very same fruit higher; so that next time he can challenge himself even more when he ventures outside(which he does often! ☝🏿😤🚫~~social media~~☝🏿😤🚫).  With ripped calves like his(and very shredded core, I noticed *atleast* a 5pack guys!) you know hes always outside.(no phone too, hardly uses it to be honest, just him and mother Nat') 🌝  &amp;nbsp;   ^(this isnt kevin)  `KDTrey5`  Edit: how do you delete your auto text signature??  `KDTrey5`"
"Kevin ""Not even good enough to be a victory cigar"" Durant"
"That’s a fun thought. Imagine starting McKinney and Looney so that your bench is Kevin “you know who I am” Durant, Cousins, and FMVP Andre Iguodala."
"Here's what's gonna happen. Warriors are gonna sit KD the first two games on the road whether he needs to or not, Toronto or Milwaukee will take one game at home and people will think there's a chance, then they go to fucking Oracle where Kevin fucking Durant is waiting for them and the Warriors win every game after that"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie would absolutely lead the Knicks to at least 1 finals appearance. Not saying they’d win but KD and Kyrie are too good to not make one finals
Kevin Durant is seething.
"steph was great, but honestly the difference between portland's defense and houston's is night and fucking day.  hell even the clippers didn't give steph that many wide open looks.  there's no boogie cousins, no kevin durant, klay is in a bit of a slump, how are you consistently giving curry 4-7 wide open threes a game in the postseason???????"
A team with Kevin Durant might have a pretty good shot
Can you imagine if this team also had Demarcus cousins or Kevin Durant
Could you imagine if this warriors team added someone like Kevin Durant?

__OOOH__ who lives as a serpent under the bridge? Kevin Durant!
The answer is Kevin Durant. Dude hasn't averaged 27ppg (his career average) since he's joined the warriors.

Can we acknowledge one more time how ridiculous it was that Kevin Durant was added to this team
Kevin Durant is like the fourth piece of paper towel when you only needed three to clean up the spill
"Kevin ""the hardest road"" Durant sits out the WCF - GS still sweep LMAO."
Nobody is cheering harder for the Blazers tonight than Kevin Durant
Durant himself said he wouldn't have joined Warriors if they didn't choked NBA Finals 2016...  &amp;#x200B;   [https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/9/17443200/warriors-cavs-finals-kevin-durant-3-1-lead-sign-nba](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/9/17443200/warriors-cavs-finals-kevin-durant-3-1-lead-sign-nba)
Honestly Nurkic fucked the team over by getting hurt. They also need to add a Kevin Durant type
Portland is getting Kevin Durant this summer
BILL WALTON+ KEVIN DURANT+ KAWHI LEONARD= MYERS LEONARD. quik maths
"[Wojnarowski] Kevin Durant has been kidnapped and is held hostage at the Raptors training facility.   [Wojnarowski] Kyle Lowry just loudly exclaimed ""Get the sword"". Not sure what this means. Possible some sort of code.   [Wojnarowski] Hmm weird... Fred VanVleet just brought out an actually sword  [Wojnarowski] OH GOD THEY'VE BEHEADED KEVIN DURANT! THEY JUST CUT OFF HIS HEAD! OH GOD IT'S DISGUSTING. THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR."
Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant.
I imagine he was talking about Kevin Durant or someone else. The context doesn't makes sense for it to be Kawhi.
Kevin Durant would like a word in that argument
But KD is also Kraft dinner. And to be honest idk if Kevin Durant is better than Kraft dinner.
"Calling them by their initials isn’t that common, partly because of the problem you pointed out. Like most people think of “AI” as Allen Iverson. KD just sounds cool and is quicker than “Kevin Durant”"
Would be a pretty epic move of the Warriors to find some random Kevin Durant and bring him along.   Or just people with KD initials.   Reporters: Are you bringing KD to Toronto  Warriors: Ha! We're bringing *three KDs!*
It's funny.  Kevin Durant going to GSW could end up fucking the salaries of future players.  Truly a snake.
"Conspiracy Theory:  The Golden State FO REALLY WANT for Curry to end the season as the Finals MVP in their last game at Oakland. They want this super spectacular finish to their time in Oakland that they're asking (and probably paying on the side), Kevin Durant, to fake an injury and lay low until GS is in serious trouble. So far no turbulence but Kawhi Leonard, AKA The Kawhiet Storm, is known to cause some serious waves. I hope he picks up where he left off before the Zaza incident/injury. If they go down 2, watch KD make a miraculous comeback. If it never happens, then I'm just a crazy guy. Let's see how this plays out. XD"
Yes KD is Kevin Durant.  KD plays for Warriors but he is hurt right now. Warriors are playing very well without Kevin.
I just recently got into basketball so I’m not sure what this post is related too. What’s going on with KD? And is KD Kevin Durant?
"In the almanac's classification, there's Point, Combo, Wing, Forward, and Big.  More specifically, (point) guards can handle the ball under defensive pressure, and are more likely to be able to shoot than any other position. They'll be the smallest player on the floor, and their usual position is PG. Some listed examples include Kyle Lowry and Quinn Cook.  Combo guards are like like point guards, except they're typically not the smallest person on the floor for their team. They might also have more off-ball skills like motion, fewer ball-handling duties, and maybe a bit more size. Their usual position is SG, although they may play PG in certain lineups. Some listed examples include Fred VanVleet and Shaun Livingston.  Wings tend to play on the perimeter, both on offense and defense. Offensively, many wings can catch and shoot, although wings with more expansive skillsets exist. Some modicum of dribbling, cutting, passing, and dunking is also common. Usually the 2-3 middle-sized players on the floor will be wings. Their usual position is SG and SF, although PF isn't unheard-of. Listed examples include Patrick McCaw and Klay Thompson.  Forwards are the intersection of wings and bigs. Basically big men with more range and handling than typical, or wings with particularly stout defense and rebounding. Their usual position is PF, occasionally SF, and maybe C for spot minutes. The listed examples include OG Anunoby and Kevin Durant.  Bigs do big man things. They rebound, dunk, and are the biggest or second-biggest player for their team. Shooting is uncommon but not unheard-of. They play C and PF. Examples include Marc Gasol and Draymond Green."
"&gt;He also has the best TS% in the finals ever.  Kevin Durant -  2012: 65% TS  2017: 65.4% TS  2018: 69.8% TS  Curry's peak is 61.9% in a Finals series, only time he wasn't in the 55-59% range."
Good thing they clarified which Kevin Durant they were talking about   *Des Moines based ventriloquist Kevin Durant...*
Cleveland built a team that went to 4 straight finals and feasibly could've 3-peated if not for injuries and Kevin Durant. What a horrible path that would be for the Lakers to take
I'll lose in the first round for 100 years before I'd ever cheer for Kevin Durant again
"Yooo that kid is a baller. I would love him, long scorer, defensive potential great value Kevin Durant right now, 19 as well? Shit he could be the steal of the draft"
Haha you think Kevin Durant would respond to all this lol Hahaha he is friends with Kobe you don't know anything about basketball at this level KD and KObe can talk like this because they are super good frenz. you need to go back to school and not talk about kd he is the best player in the league right now hahahahahaha smh my head.
https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/20/kevin-durant-blasts-fan-who-was-innocently-celebrating-the-warriors-game-3-victory/  he likes to banter!
"yeah, his life is so much less stressful now that everyone hates him. that's why he's on social media responding to them 24/7, especially the ones who point out his move was soft - because he ""doesn't have anything to prove"". when i see a guy blow up at a gsw fan for mentioning how good the team is even without him - https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/20/kevin-durant-blasts-fan-who-was-innocently-celebrating-the-warriors-game-3-victory/ - and calls it ""divisive"" to do that, he definitely looks like he has nothing to prove"
"The only 3 point shooting big men that became perennial All-Stars were Dirk, Kevin Love, and maybe Bosh. Dirk had the unguarded fadeaway. Love could rebound. And Bosh was an all around player with pretty good defense. Lauri barely has anything but shooting.  I guess you can include Durant as a big man too but Durant's a freak."
"To be fair it wasn't during the season but immediately after the signing while he was on a Nike promotional tour in China.  &gt;""That was before I met anybody from the Warriors and dove into the culture.

"&gt;would adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 2018-19 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors?  It wouldn't be even close, Rodgers to Rams would be far more impactful."
"More to life, but not more to basketball. It’s a professionally competitive game. Fuck the bullshit, okay to win, or join another profession. I can’t imagine how heated I’d be if my GM let Kevin fucking Durant go because his god damn feelings were hurt. Like what the fuck is wrong with you? Get over yourself and get a ring."
"Yes, but is adding an all-star QB as important to an NFL team as adding an all-star starter on a NBA team?  E.g., would adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 2018-19 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors?  I'd argue the latter is way more valuable."

"This is from your link:   With or without Kevin Durant, the Golden State Warriors are the favorites in the NBA Finals for a fifth consecutive year.  Caesars Sportsbook installed the two-time defending champion Warriors as -320 favorites to beat the Toronto Raptors in the Finals. Game 1 of the best-of-seven series is Thursday in Toronto. Golden State opened as a 1-point road favorite in Game 1.  Where are you seeing them as underdogs in game 1? Why are you acting like they're not a historically stacked team like we've never seen before?"
"Everybody upset with Kevin Durant is a hoe and isn’t being realistic about the situation at all. If you have a chance to improve your life, you do it. KD was the first real free agent acquisition the Warriors made, drafted most of the other team. Steph/klay/draymond were all drafted, and no one in the world knew steph would become the greatest shooter ever and become one of the most dominant players in the game. People should appreciate the best team we’ll ever see and enjoy the basketball. If you were fans of basketball and not just your teams then you would."
"check it out: [he's lying](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets)  what durant tries to say using his burners (while screwing up and tweeting on his main account) while being able to hide that it came from him, is far more representative of what he really thinks than this ridiculous ""yeah i just wanted to play good basketball...which i could only do on this 73-9 team"" bullshit. he could play good basketball plenty of places. he was playing good basketball when he had them down 3-1 in the WCF"
"“The 30-year-old University of Texas product added the decision to join Golden State said the ""spirit of the game"" played a much bigger role in his choice than the potential for individual accolades.  ""Not the spotlight or the fame that comes from being the best player. Not the legacy. I swear on my life, that don't mean nothing to me,"" Durant told Lee. ""How I build myself up in this NBA life, it doesn't mean anything to me. I just want to play great basketball every second I'm on the court, and that was a perfect opportunity for me to do so.""”  [source](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2831146-kevin-durant-wanted-to-be-with-warriors-so-bad-i-didnt-give-a-f-k)"
"""I don't dispute that"" So I'm right then. Kobe was traded to the Lakers. Kevin CHOSE to make it easy and that's a massive difference. If you take Kobe off Lakers don't win or take shaq off they don't win. They were both important. Take Kevin durant off the warriors and they sweep the WCF... Interesting"
"Kobe was an all-star and still dicked the spurs. Remember Kobe was a young player and not a fully developed 30 year old like Kevin Durant. It's hilarious he's still living in people's heads even after retirement. Kobe also won 2 ships with his own team, something KD will never do"
Uh Kevin Durant has.
"Kobe had Shaq. He was drafted to a team with three all-stars (Shaq, Jones, Van Exel).   Then he had Karl Malone and Gary Payton added to Shaq.    And when he lost Shaq, he asked for a trade.   Kobe is full of shit, and he needs to be called out on that.  He would leave if his team's shit: he demanded a trade and only pulled back on that when they landed Gasol to team up with Bynum and Odom.   &amp;#x200B;  Players who have good fortune (a team willing to spend money and HOF talent)  The fact of the matter is that Kobe never had to go through what KD went through in OKC.  Kobe didn't have a teammate who was hogging the ball: HE WAS THE TEAMMATE WHO WAS HOGGING THE BALL (look at his last couple of playoff with Shaq: he took more shots; Shaq shot at a higher percentage).   Kobe never had to deal with a team who would trade a future HOF (Harden) and then let key role players walk because they didn't want to spend the money.   &amp;#x200B;  Kevin Durant saw that the Thunder, even when they drafted well, were not willing to spend the money to keep the team competitive. Why would he stay? The ownership clearly didn't care as much about winning as KD did. They wouldn't spend the money to keep their own talent?   Sure... going to GSW made it a bit easy, but why wouldn't a player go to a team who put him in the best position to win?   &amp;#x200B;  Kobe just wants to make it sound like he somehow had more fortitude when the reality of the matter was that KD got drafted by the worst team in the league, while Kobe was essentially born on third with regard to his NBA career.   He needs to STFU."
He said it during an interview after he joined the team.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.796e1595413e
I think this is simply untrue. The team was unlucky like the Pelicans have been in recent years. Their stars could no stay healthy. Westbrook was hurt one year well before the playoffs and missed significant time. Then Kevin Durant missed significant time. If the team was healthy they would have made incredible playoff pushes from 2012 onward. Instead they limped into the playoffs like the Pelicans had with Jrue Holiday always injured or DeMarcus Cousins healing his leg.   &amp;#x200B;  OKC was a game from making the Finals. When KD and Westbrook were on the game together they were great. It was just rare both were healthy long enough to do it in the playoffs.
And Kevin Durant is 6'9
"Monta Ellis actually spent 8 years at Golden State. Great job being a fan before the Raptors had existed. You’re right you won a ring with a core you drafted. That’s good on you. But don’t diss other teams for getting a pre made superstar when you did the exact same thing. At least we actually had to sacrifice Derozan and you got Kevin fucking Durant for free. Nice job drafting your core, cause you wouldn’t have beat Cleveland without him."
"It's objectively not the case that this is common knowledge to most high school educated people. Maybe most high school educated people in your own social milieu, in which case, good for you -- but don't blame Kevin Durant for obvious functions of his circumstances, such as attending three high schools -- two of which are widely known for basketball, which means that I bet they're not widely known for academics!"
"great organization? yes. harden to houston is prolly one of the worst trades to happen in NBA history in retrospect. but as a front office, durant/ westbrook &gt; harden in 2013, considering how he went missing in the playoffs against miami even tho he won 6th man of the year. also, keeping ibaka makes sense, as it’s harder to find a 1st team all defence player, than harden, whom people see was easily overshadowed and below the levels of the 2 current stars. plus, they had kevin martin, a borderline all star at that point of time with a more consistent scoring ability than harden.   oladipo, pg and even sabonis proved that it’s not about the organization, but the coaching and westbrook made it impossible to win being in okc. he just wanna have fun and win."
They lost the ship that year that's why the recruited Durant. Kevin is easily talked into things it seems
And and that's without Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins
"Kevin Durant has no eyelids, so he can never close his eyes or blink. Instead of eyelids, thin clear membrane cover his corneas, called spectacles or brilles. These are attached to his skin. Although he cant close his eyes, he can close the retinas when sleeping."
"Oh, I get it! It's because he's never been to the finals!  I guess you're right. I have no room to criticize a player from another team. Especially because my home team hasn't made the finals in a long time.  Guess I'll go ahead and order my Kevin Durant jersey now."
"what do you want him to do? say nah i dont want to play with kevin durant and be part of one of the greatest teams of all time? cmon now every other player would say the same thing  lol why are you even upset dude  some people agree that Steph is unselfish, why does that make you mad? what do you think his legacy will be?"
"&gt;HANDLES FAME INCREDIBLY WELL!  Believe it or not, he does. He's been in the public spotlight since high school. Consider other players:  * Kevin Durant: Modestly insecure on social media  * Shaq: Spent over $1 million in an hour after signing his contract  * Michael Jordan: Gambling addiction  * Paul George: Cheated on Callie Rivers  * Nick Young: Cheated on Iggy Azalea, ""legalize cocaine""  * Len Bias: Coke, death  * Javaris Crittenton: Drugs, guns, murder, prison  In terms of personal vices, the worst LeBron has done is be corny and awkward. Maybe he's been a bit weird about his balding hairline? He's still with high school sweetheart, and has 3 kids. Possible tampering allegations, but the NBA can't and doesn't stop players from hanging out with each other. So yeah, he handles fame really well."
I could see Kevin Durant being on r/nba up voting and downvoting and making comments.
"Kevin durant too because of his already comical proportions.  I think Kawhi, Giannis, AD, and maybe Harden are good picks as well"
"Plot twist, OP is really Kevin Durant"
And that's one of the reasons you're not Kevin Durant.
how did you forget kevin durant lol....
"It's not tough at all. Kevin Durant is one of the purest scorers of all time and is unstoppable. But if say an exact replica of carmelo gets drafted instead of durant is the game any differently played today? No. Odds are the same teams still win the championship the past 12 years too. He is a freakish player but no one is investing in durant stoppers. No one is building teams or strategy's to stop him. He doesn't transcend the game like Bron or MJ.  Off the top of my head I have Mikan, Russell, Wilt, MJ, Shaq, LeBron, and Steph on it. Magic depends on the day for me. These guys bent the league to their will.  KAJ was the most dominant scorer of all time, has the most MVP awards, has a chip as the main man plus a wack as the #2 guy. Not in the Goat convo not on the Rushmore. Durant #2 guy on some chips, incredible scorer, one mvp. He isn't close to the pinnacle at this point.  And yes KD is better than Steph... at a game of 1 on 1."
"Kevin ""Shaquille O'Neal"" Durant"
Meanwhile GSW spent their extra cap space on Kevin Durant
Michael Jordan then Lebron then Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant has been better than LeBron since 2016.
Literally the team he wanted to play for growing up lmfao  https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/
Kevin Durant would beat anyone in the history of the league 1v1.
"&gt; Kevin Durant once told a story about how when Drake invited him up to Montreal, he not only had no idea where it was, he had no idea that they spoke French in a part of North America.  It's good own damn daily for not knowing to facts that are common knowledge to most high school educated people in the U.S."
I knew this was going to happen.  Kevin Durant is healthy. He has no incentive to play. It’s a business decision.  Durant is gone.
Yea but wasn't Kevin Durant on a few the teams?
"Why not? They're the Knicks, and he's Kevin Durant. I don't think the Warriors did a physical on Kd when he joined them."
I don't know what to say. Just imagine being a team's fan and not wanting Kevin Durant on your team.
"It's not really about elevating those individual player's game although that is the case in some cases. It's about suddenly making a role player an integral part of a contender. Curry does the same thing he makes his teammates better. So did Shaq and Duncan. Role players playing with them suddenly become very important.  That was the case at the time though. In their preseason interview, all three of them Bosh, Wade, and James said Boston was the team to beat. Boston literally had a big 3 and beat both James and Wade the previous years.   Wade was a top 5 player for sure, but Bosh was not and never was. You realize Bosh made 1 all-nba teams his whole career right? He was 2nd team all-nba in 2007. In 2010 his last year with the Raptors he didn't even make the playoffs, and the following big men were on the all-nba teams over Bosh: Bogut, Gasol, Duncan, Nowitzki, Amare, and Howard.  There is no measure that places Bosh has a top 2 or 3 or even top 5 *power forward*.  &gt;Okc has a big 2. Harden wasn’t that guy yet. We was a strong 6-man.  Harden was the 6th man of the year. Ibaka was 1st team all-defense. Kevin Durant was the leading scorer in the league and Russell Westbrook was 5th. OKC was definitely on par with James/Wade/Bosh.  You're also missing teams like the New York Knicks. Carmelo Anthony was all-nba 3rd team same as Wade in 2012. Tyson Chandler was all-nba, all-defense, and the DPOY.  In 2011 there was the 60 win Bulls. Rose was the MVP and Noah was all-defense. They got Jimmy Butler too.  See the Heat had plenty of competitors just as good of them. Remember Chris Bosh was none of these things not all-nba, MVP, DPOY, or all-defense. It was really Wade and James. Technically, some of the teams they faced had more players with accomplishments than them.  This is not the case at all with the Warriors. The Warriors have DPOYs (Draymond), all-defense (Draymond and Klay), multiple all-nba guys (Curry and Durant) and all-stars (Klay). No team they faced comes close to them they don't have equals out there to compete with them.  &gt;Lebron kicks if someone help defends his drive. If not, he tries to finish himself.  He primarily does pick and rolls with rolling bigs like Tristan Thompson, Joel Anthony, Timofey Mozgov etc. These guys were never asked to shoot 3s or even jumpshots. He definitely does not try to finish himself he is 50/50 correct playmaker type of player. His picks and rolls can result in shots for himself in the paint, shots for the big man rolling with him/alley oops, shots for shooters at the 3 point line, or a  3 point shot for James himself. He forces defenses to make mistakes so someone on his team can get a quality shot and he always makes the right play.  &gt;More than just having those guys on Lebrons team, they also were no longer on other teams in the east, making it even weaker.   That's really only the case with Wade. Love was busy not making the playoffs in the West, and Kyrie and Bosh were busy not making the playoffs in the East.   &gt;Likely, those players would have kept their superstar numbers and status though.  How? They would get faded into irrelevance. Karl Anthony Towns gets buried now for doing what Kevin Love was doing on those Wolves. Devin Booker is putting up the same numbers as Kyrie, but Booker isn't recognized as a superstar. In fact, Kyrie really became recognized as a superstar only after his performance in the 2016 finals."
"As much as the narrative out there is saying that Kevin Durant is a hinderance on Golden State's beautiful basketball, he is arguably the best player on the planet.  That being said, Golden State Warriors win easily with Durant in the fold, or at least, part of it. Durant and Leonard cancel each other out. Who do you like better? Curry, Klay, and Green or Gasol, Lowry, and Siakam?  Without Durant, I still think the Warriors win. The splash brothers are far greater than any two combination of Raptors top players. However, it can be argued that the raptors might have a stronger supporting cast, so it could keep the series close.  &amp;#x200B;  TL;DR - With Durant, Warriors in 5. Without Durant, Warriors in 6."
"“According to NBA insider Zach Lowe, former general manager David Griffin initially explored the idea of signing Kevin Durant after the 2016 championship before deciding it was not worth having to blow up the rest of his roster for one player”   David griffin tried getting KD on the team and as a GM why wouldn’t you? It’s your job to construct the best team ."
"It has more to do with most American players not be acclimated to going to foreign countries to play sports. The development of an American basketball player is done entirely in the US; many players have never had passports until getting to the NBA. Kevin Durant once told a story about how when Drake invited him up to Montreal, he not only had no idea where it was, he had no idea that they spoke French in a part of North America.  AAU basketball is played entirely between cities and states in America, then you go to college where you do the same. Travel from state to state and compete. All of a sudden you hit the NBA, get drafted by a Canadian team and for many players it's their first time having to move out of the country. Their support networks can't come up as easily either.  One of the things people gloss over about the Bryan Colangelo era Raptors is that he was dead on about free agents not wanting to come to Canada. He instead focused on getting low risk, high potential reclamation projects like TJ Ford or international players like Hedo Turkoglu and Anthony Parker (American but played in Israel). He was a bit ahead of his time though because the intentional talent pool wasn't quite there yet.  Toronto will never be a particularly popular destination for American players but I could see the team becoming a destination for high profile international players. I know Porzingis had Toronto as one of the teams he was okay with being traded to."
"Demarcus Cousins questionable, Kevin Durant our for game 1."
*laughs in kevin durant*
"i know Rachel Nichols voted for KD [and i think Howard Beck did also if I remember correctly](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-2018-warriors-kevin-durant-named-nba-finals-mvp-for-second-straight-season/) literally if those two people vote for Steph instead of KD he wins.   Literally two people, any two KD voters you want to pick, those are the two that apparently all the Steph bashers are worshipping as their opinions always being right and being the only ones that matter. It's comedy these same Steph haters probably bash Rachel Nichols takes on the Jump all the time and call her or Howard Beck or whomever a clueless idiot frequently."
Lebron was Wade's Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant taking a minimum contract to join us would destroy what little is left of his legacy.   But idc!!! HE COME
"&gt;He won 50-60 games regularly with just role players. He elevated entire teams and that's where the he makes teammates better comes from. He makes teams better.  And essentially the same amount when he got super teams.   Obviously Lebron isn’t trash. The fact that he took teams in the easy to the finals doesn’t mean he elevated those players games. It could just be that a great player was enough to get through the east.   &gt;How? Before their first games, Lebron's Heat was evenly matched with Boston. Literally position for position. Also OKC and San Antonio had their big 3s soon to be big 4s brewing with Ibaka and Leonard.  That turned out to be the case, but was in no way the perception at the time. It was only after the heat didn’t play as well as their lofty expectations were these other excuses found.   The heats biggest threat at the time we’re the Lakers, and the only chance they were given was Kobe heroics.   At the time, the only people who didn’t consider Wade the best 2 guard in the league were the ones who thought Kobe was. Lebron was clear cut best sf, and Bosh was a top 2 or 3 pf depending on who you ask.   Boston didn’t have a top 2 guy on their team at any position.   Kawhi wasn’t Kawhi yet. He was essentially just a strong defender.   Okc has a big 2. Harden wasn’t that guy yet. We was a strong 6-man.   Notice only one of those are easy teams anyway, and Boston was soon to be broken with Lebron gaining Ray Allen.   That’s how strong the heat were. One of Boston’s big 3 or 4, was a bench player for the heat.   &gt;Except Lebron's system never forced them to do that it only forced actually good 3 point shooters like Love and Bosh to shoot 3s, and Lebron actually gets criticized for that.  Yes it does. Lebrons system forces everyone who’s not the picker to clear the lane, typically behind the arc, but sometimes at the shoulder on the other side if they’re also the crasher.   Lebron kicks if someone help defends his drive. If not, he tries to finish himself.   (On a side note, this is also why he gets credit for being double teamed and I don’t get it. There a big difference between having two defenders on you as soon as you touch the ball, and having to deal with a help defender once you pass the first)  &gt;Nonsense. This implies just giving the ball to a player a lot will result in great stats. That is nonsense. Only great players can score so many points so efficiently, and handle the ball so much without turning it over all the time.  Simply giving the ball to a player to run that system will always result in a lot of stats, whether they’re good or not is a different question.   Lebron forced the game to be played through him. If a shot is taken, it’s him, or off his pass. Also, because he’s driving, he’s near the basket, usually with a smaller defender for rebounds.   I’m not suggesting it’s not a smart way to play. It is. But it does inflate his stats, and limit how others can play, regardless of their talent.    &gt;Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, and Kevin Love would not have championship rings without Lebron. Dwyane Wade would have ended his career with 1 ring without Lebron. These guys benefited heavily from Lebron.  Sure, maybe. We don’t know how everything plays out without Lebrons super teams. Likely, those players would have kept their superstar numbers and status though.   More than just having those guys on Lebrons team, they also were no longer on other teams in the east, making it even weaker. That helped a lot. Similar to how having Durant not on another team in the west helped the warriors."
I like how people on reddit think they know the psyche of Kevin Durant
"He won 50-60 games regularly with just role players. He elevated entire teams and that's where the he makes teammates better comes from. He makes teams better.  &gt;Before their first games, Lebrons heat team was further ahead of their competition than the Durant warriors.  How? Before their first games, Lebron's Heat was evenly matched with Boston. Literally position for position. Also OKC and San Antonio had their big 3s soon to be big 4s brewing with Ibaka and Leonard.  Th Warriors before Durant were already evenly matched with the other best team in the league the Cavs. Kevin Durant joining the Warriors made them a big 4 and since then there have been no other big 4s in the league to challenge them. Lebron James joining Miami made them a big 3 and there big 3s around the league.  &gt;I’m also confused as to how Green got turned into a spot up shooter? When did that happen?  He is forced to stand at the 3 point line and shoot 3s even though he is a bad 3 point shooter. Same with Iguodala when he is off-ball. They have to do this to space the floor for Steph to run their offense. This is like Lebron making Udonis Haslem or Tristan Thompson shoot 3s.   Except Lebron's system never forced them to do that it only forced actually good 3 point shooters like Love and Bosh to shoot 3s, and Lebron actually gets criticized for that.  &gt;(And stat pad of course)  Nonsense. This implies just giving the ball to a player a lot will result in great stats. That is nonsense. Only great players can score so many points so efficiently, and handle the ball so much without turning it over all the time.  &gt;Because Lebron has had some of the most stacked teams in NBA history, he’s hurt more than he’s helped.  Kyrie Irving, Chris Bosh, and Kevin Love would not have championship rings without Lebron. Dwyane Wade would have ended his career with 1 ring without Lebron. These guys benefited heavily from Lebron."
Is this a Kevin Durant burner account????
Kevin Durant has entered the lobby
"KAWHI LEONARD IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA RIGHT NOW.  Unquestionably. He is the best defender in the league easy, and is top 4 in offense. That’s better than anybody else. He has endorsements from the greatest players of all time. He can lock up the best scorers in the league easily. He can score in any situation. He is better at defending than Kevin Durant is better than him at scoring. Kawhi Leonard is also a top 3 scorer in the NBA, at lowest top 5. He is the best overall player in the NBA right now."
"A team with Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins, and a bench that goes relatively deep in Iggy and Livingston.. that’s a super team. The 2011 Heat was a super starting lineup, sure. They had literally no bench, and no center. Bibby was their fourth best player and then you had a major drop off in talent."
"Absolutely, they may not even want him to take shots given that he has been so out of the game recently. I imagine that he would be in a strictly defend and pass role and they would use him in specific matchup‘s. Perhaps something like specifically onto Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson given his length."
The I hate LeBron you bitch contested three: Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is a well oiled snek
Jerry West also recruited Kevin Durant to sign with the Golden State Warriors.  https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/heres-what-jerry-west-reportedly-told-kevin-durant-during-his-warriors-pitch/amp/
Kevin Durant is one of the best players in the league
kawhi is already the best player in basketball   only kevin durant is potentially able to stop this
"We beat them with Chris Paul, while we didn't have Kevin Durant this year.  Chris Paul would have helped them, but the narrative that Chris Paul would have been the difference maker is dead."
"1. Steph Curry spent some time in Toronto when Dell Curry played with Vince Carter. The carter effect and other YouTube videos show Steph playing with Vince as a kid.  2. Ayesha Curry was also born in Toronto and spent part of her childhood there.  3. Who passed the ball inbounds for Vince Carter’s miss in 2001 for Raptors Sixers buzzer beater? None other than Dell Curry. Kawhi redeemed this shot against the Sixers this year. Both winners of those games faced Milwaukee.  4. Chris Boucher and Patrick McCaw played for the Warriors last year. Alfonso McKinnie played for the Raptors last year. McKinnie’s story is impressive to make it back to the league.  5. Kevin Durant grew up idolizing Vince Carter and said so on the Dan Patrick show. Drake got fined for tampering for Kevin Durant free agency too. Drake is friends with Kevin Durant and Curry, but his heart is with the Toronto Raptors.  6. Kevin Durant swan song for the Warriors? A chance for a three peat against the most difficult defense they’ll face this playoffs or the end of a dynasty with Raptors Cinderella story.  7. Raptors only team to sweep Golden state this year. Albeit regular season is not the playoffs and postseason is a completely different animal.  8. Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol get their chance for a title after years of falling short in the west to the Warriors.  9. Klay predicted their matchup in the fall as a possible June preview. He’s Nostradamus.  10. And finally Kawhi 2017 amazing playoff run came to a halt against the Warriors... On his 2019 redemption tour after the whole injury ordeal last year now he gets the chance to beat the Warriors in the NBA finals."
One of my favorite tweets that gets underrated is the clippers-Kevin Durant interview:   Clippers meeting with Durant was “intense” and “at one point Steve Ballmer was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned
"No LeBron, Canadian team, and an overwhelming favourite. I will have to say no.  Honestly I haven't watched the playoffs as much in previous years because I am a hockey fan and it had been a forgone conclusion the warriors win the finals ever year since Kevin Durant joined."
"Wait are you suggesting that one player cannot defend against 5 all alone?  I AM SHOCKED I TELL YOU  ... seriously though, during that phase of the season between DJ getting hurt and Cousins coming back, Kevin Durant was effectively playing the 5 for actual minutes for the Warriors. Opening tipoffs and everything.  He's not bulky enough to bang inside with true Cs but anyone who's less than his (listed) 240 pounds should think twice before they come at him. He's longer than just about anyone, he's quick, and when he shifts to that role he's a shot-blocking monster.  People really under-rate how much KD's game depends on *who he has around him*. He can pretty much do it all, but he tries to focus on what the team *needs* him to do."
All-Playoff Team  * C - Nikola Jokic * F - Kevin Durant * F - Kawhi Leonard * G - James Harden * G - Stephen Curry
Kevin Durant will be moving to Toronto next year if the Raptors win the finals.  So count him out
"This just in it is hard to defend a team with  2018-2019  Accolades of: 3 All-Stars, a 1st and 2nd all nba player, and 2 2nd team defensive players.   I mean when healthy the “worst” starter has been an all star the last 3/4 years. And is all defense.   Hell even the 6th man was an all star for one season.  Just hard to beat a team that drafted 3 incredible players and develops solid backups that then signed Kevin Durant."

"you need to be more direct. “michael conley jr looks sexy in a suit.” “when he passes to zbo at the elbow, my heart cries out.” “I think if mike conley and a healthy oden had played together in the nba, they would have won a title for memphis.” “I’m naming my kid Conley.”  You know, not some weak shit like “uh i guess he sort of gave my superteam a run for their money” that makes me want to be not-friends with you and kevin durant."
Because no one is saying bev suffers from “mental fragility” which is so sweetly ironic that a bunch of teen suburban white boys on an Internet forum have the gall to call Kevin Durant who worked his ass off in the streets of PG county to come out of the mud and make a name for himself “soft”
"The other teams' GMs weren't talking about how they're ""obsessed"" with beating Golden State and their teams were specifically built to do that.  If you're announcing that your specific goal is to *beat Golden State* and you don't manage to do that?  And one year you go into the second half of game 7 with a solid lead, and manage to brick 27 threes in a row in a truly spectacular choke job, and the next year you get stomped by a guy a team missing Kevin Durant and led by a guy with a jacked hand who had zero points at halftime... *at home*?  You dun fucked up."
"I finally get it! The Warriors have been winning not because of Kevin Durant but in spite of him.  They are a magical team that can withstand venom and we should give them credit for being so beautiful and self-less.  If they were a hot chick, I would not have a chance with them because they are so pure and my loins are vile."
"Home court advantage: ✓  No Kevin Durant: ✓  Steph Curry injured with 0 points in the first half: ✓  Still lost : ✓  Never change Houston Chockets, never change."
Are the Warriors better without Kevin Durant? My column:
Why does everyone forget that the Warriors were the best team in the league before Kevin durant.... they were championship teams before durant....
Golden state is this good and they are missing kevin fucking Durant
#DONT LET KEVIN DURANT MISSING THIS GAME MAKE YOU FORGET THE WARRIORS WON GAME 6-7 LAST HEAR WITHOUT ANDRE IGUODALA
Kevin Durant injured.               Curry scoreless first half.             Rockets.......still lose.
"Warriors dropped all their bench to get boogie and Kevin Durant, Curry is playing injured, and it's looking like they're going to make the rockets look like fools  Rockets can't win in the postseason"
"Kevin durant is quite possibly the best player in the game right now, but goddamn if the durantless warriors are so fun to watch"
Lol the Warriors are still the best team in the league without Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins  Let that sink in for a second
Kevin Durant:  The hardest road!
"""Kevin Durant? Who's that?""  Curry and Klay, probably."
Kevin “Mr. Superfluous” Durant
"""Hello 911""  ""Hi the Warriors don't need Kevin Durant""  ""Ok I'm sending a unit your way right now"""
Warriors are better without ballhog Kevin Durant.
I love how the rockets are “choking” they’re playing a fucking back to back nba championship team. This team got Kevin Durant AFTER winning 2 titles. Maybe they’re just good?
"Lol Kevin Durant gets doubled all the time on GSW. Even if you watched only Ximo Pierto highlights, you would know that.  I swear people do not watch basketball on this subreddit."
Except Kevin Durant
"Did Kevin Durant change the way offense is played? That’s what revolutionary means. Even if Kevin Durant is a better overall scorer, he isn’t a better shooter and clearly isn’t as revolutionary of a scorer"
"There's a rumor that the Pels are scouting Knox.   With that in mind, if the Knicks get their pipedream this summer, would they trade their young core for AD? For a team that consists of Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis? They'd sign maybe Robin Lopez and/or Rajon Rondo to fill out a playoff contender. Players that wouldn't fold in the playoffs.    Trade DSJ, Knox, this year's top 5 draft pick, Dallas' 2021 unprotected 1st, Mitchell Robinson, and maybe even Ntilikina?"
Kevon Looney &gt; Kevin Durant  Steph Curry &gt; Seth Curry
I would just like to say that all of my previous takes on this series were based on Kevin Durant being healthy.
Kevon looney out there playing like kevin durant
Is Iguodala actually Kevin Durant
Well... didn’t you read the article how explaining how Kevin Durant is awesome BECAUSE of Steph Curry?!?!?!
Kevin Durant may be outplaying Steph and he's in Oakland..
Kevin Durant is injured.   Steph Curry is scoreless.   And the game is tied.   Anyone would've told you you're on drugs if you prophesied this before this game.
The game is tied and the warriors are playing without Kevin Durant AND Steph Curry.
Imagine if golden state played team ball but with Kevin Durant as well
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and Kevin Looney*
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and steph curry
D&amp;D: Dany forgot that Kevin Durant got hurt
"Kevon ""Kevin Durant"" Looney"
Was cooking a second ago: did JVG implicitly compare Steph to frickin  BJ Armstrong in his Kevin Durant-being-out-is-like-Jordan-being-out spiel?
Who needs Kevin Durant when you have Kevon Looney
Klay Thompson is actually just a better Kevin Durant
Why is this game so close? Tied without Kevin Durant? smh
Kevon “Kevin Durant” Looney
"Durant honestly is not the hugest difference maker every one of the talking heads and everyone in this sub makes him out to be. They’ve had life without Kevin Durant, they’ve won a title and won 73 games another year. He forces them to play different which they can do. If they lose this series, they would’ve done so if Durant played. If they win, same thing."
Imagine being so stacked that losing KEVIN FUCKIN DURANT might not matter hahaha  KLAY IS HEATING UP!!
"Great interview with PJ Tucker there and Van Gundy completely misses the fucking point as always.  We clearly aren't BETTER without Kevin Durant, but in the short term it can really refocus everyone."
They were waving bye bye to Kevin Durant?
He's 6'5 and was already guarding Kevin Durant
"Golden State only won, because of Kevin Durant. One I don't think they make it without him, two he was the difference maker. Clevelands offense was pound for pound just as good if not better than theirs, they just had KD on top of it."
"Reminder that last time the Warriors played the Rockets without Kevin Durant, they eliminated the Rockets from the playoffs with Stephen Curry only playing a total of 38 minutes in the series."
"Injured forward Kevin Durant yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Klay Thompson gave a look of pleasant surprise. Steph Curry yelled out, “We got an fucking squad now.” And before Draymond Green hit the locker room door, former NBA great Andrew Bogut got off a plane and coach Steve Kerr said “Y’all look so different.”"

"As much as I don’t want to agree, Kevin Durant fits the mold pretty well"
Who the fuck is Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant is good but he ain’t no Jordan Binnington
"""ow my small Kevin Durant-like Frame"" killed me"
"Kevin ""Thor"" Durant"
Kevin Durant missing time.... Hmm there's something with the Ks
"The term ‘pure shooter’ is also in reference to a players natural ability to shoot and shoot well , almost as if they were born to shoot.    Eg:     ( When Kevin Durant thinks of a pure shooter, he imagines one image)  “A guy that every time the ball leaves his hands it looks like it's going in,”   – Durant.   “I'm not a pure shooter like a Ray Allen or a (Kyle) Korver...Those are pure shooters. I'd say I'm a scorer”"
"P.J. ""Kevin Durant"" Tucker"
Yes it was.   It's the worst miss in basketball history.   Except maybe taking Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.   Or perhaps LaRue Martin over Bob McAdoo and Julius Erving.     4 times the Blazers have had the top pick.   Those 4 players (Including Bill Walton) played a grand total of 700 games total for Portland.  Barely over 2 seasons each on average.
This honestly [is my favorite photo of the playoffs and it probably will stay that way the rest of the postseason](https://www.google.com/search?q=patrick+beverley+kevin+durant+photo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO__7a8JHiAhWq1FkKHYRBBF8Q_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=590#imgrc=GXRZRQ6DoiftlM:). Anything in any way where we have them playing against each other 4 times next year it's mandatory we let that happen
&gt;what would take OKC to sign Kevin Durant this summer?  The Infinity Gauntlet.
"What? They'd gain what they get back in the sign and trade...  Hypothetically, if KD told GSW that he wants to play in Boston, GSW could demand Jaylen Brown and salary match from Boston for it and Boston would happily accept. They'd be getting Kevin Durant.  Not that I think this will happen though. Kyrie doesn't want to be in Boston."
"&gt;Kyrie and KD are both not going to the Knicks. Quote me on that, no way it's happening.  * ACEPACEACE.

"Despite going down 3-0 and ultimately losing 4-1, that 2017 Cavs team was really good but got stonewalled by a 73-win team plus Kevin Durant and a massive chip on their shoulder."
Derek Fisher has won as many NBA championships as LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined.
"&gt; There is reportedly some thought within the Golden State Warriors organization that Kevin Durant leaving in free agency is not a foregone conclusion.   &gt; According to Sam Amick of The Athletic, there is a ""recent sense"" among those close to the Warriors that KD might ""think twice"" about leaving and instead re-sign due to the ""recent stretch of domination and fan appreciation.""  &gt; The Athletic's Marcus Thompson II isn't so sure. He told Marc Berman of the New York Post this week Durant to New York is far from a lock and noted, ""I do feel like the picture the Warriors will paint is a pretty good one.""  &gt; ESPN's Stephen A. Smith said on First Take in April the Los Angeles Clippers have a ""better than 50 percent chance"" to sign both Durant and Leonard in free agency after pushing the Warriors to six games in the first round of the playoffs.  all of these people are full of shit"
"Yeah technically they lost to the best team of all time (2016, 73-9 warriors) and Kevin Durant combined. So not fair to say they were bad at all."
i literally decided like 10 mins ago that the only thing funnier than missing 27 straight 3’s is losing to a warriors team with no kevin durant. man i can’t wait to troll the rox.
Jimmy is younger than Kevin Durant and only 5 months older than Klay. He already deserved a 4 year max. At worst Jimmy's game will develop into a better Iggy. He takes care of his body and is always in top shape.
You do realize Kevin Durant isn’t playing for the remainder of the series so this makes absolutely no sense right?
"Warriors are 26-1 in the last 27 games they have played without Kevin Durant, but with Steph Curry in the lineup."
Actually Kevin Durant is responsible for that
"Yes I think that in 2019. Citing the year isn't an argument you can't just use literally every number you can think of as an argument you already tried that and failed that won't work on me.  For example, if you want to use one stat to determine who the top 5 players in the league are, ppg leaders in the playoffs gives you: Kevin Durant, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, and Paul George.  Now find me another single stat that would give such an accurate result."
"I definitely don’t think Steph nor Bron sees UA as right-wing or anti-Kap. Curry has come out several times in support of Kaepernick, so that can’t be it  Edit: to add references    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfchronicle.com/sports/ostler/amp/Stephen-Curry-Kevin-Durant-unite-with-Colin-12541619.php   https://twitter.com/con_chron/status/1096796943920054277?s=21"
"Steph has been this efficient with or without Kevin Durant. Dame has never shot a season at 40% from 3. Either way he’s going to be a pretty unanimous 1st team all NBA which suggests he was comfortably better, even with missing more games."
"Same production as Dame on slightly better efficiency, but Dame doesn't get to play next to Kevin Durant. Dame was also better defensively and a better playmaker."
"Lol at you.  The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway.""   SPORTS LeBron James and some of the NBA's biggest stars have reportedly had a 'disdain' toward Stephen Curry that he doesn't understand Scott Davis Jun 3, 2018, 3:27 PM ET lebron steph Ezra Shaw/Getty  Stephen Curry is a respected and popular player in the NBA, but some of the league's other top stars, including LeBron James, have been irritated by his rise, according to a 2017 report. Some NBA stars reportedly felt annoyed by Curry's rise and the fact he seemed immune to criticism from the sports world. Curry was reportedly aware of this feeling and was confused by it, feeling he had proved himself as one of the NBA's best players. Stephen Curry is one of the best, most respected, and most popular players in the NBA, but his quick rise in the league reportedly rubbed some of his peers the wrong way.  In 2017, Marcus Thompson of The Athletic, author of the book ""Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry,"" explained to ""The Big Lead with Jason McIntyre"" that Curry was not all that popular with some of the league's biggest stars, including LeBron James.  ""There's this thing there with he and LeBron that's a little weird,"" Thompson said.  According to Thompson, James and Curry were close from Curry's days at Davidson to his early years in the league. Thompson said James was ""like a mentor"" to Curry, but as Curry's game improved, coinciding with the Warriors' rise, he ""challenged LeBron's status."" Since then, the two apparently haven't been as close, and it reportedly bothers Curry.  Thompson said:   ""The part that's odd for Steph, like why does that mean there has to be some beef between us? He loves LeBron, he respects LeBron, and he's like ... 'Because the outside world is pitting us together, why do you and I have to now have this disdain between us? I thought we were cool.' ""That's the question that's in Curry's mind and Curry's camp: 'Why do you not like me when all I did was basically respect everything you did and kind of follow the model you carried out?' So there's an interesting dynamic there, and it's not just with LeBron. ""Steph wants to be accepted by all these guys. This is what he worked for - for you to say, 'Man, you're one of us.' It seems like they don't want to give that to him. Not yet, anyway."" During the 2016 Finals, the second rematch between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, things got noticeably heated between James and Curry as James' Cavs came roaring back and eventually won the series.  In Game 6, James swatted one of Curry's shots and trash-talked him afterward. The two had bumped each other a few times and exchanged words. Finally, Curry was called for a foul, lost his cool, chucked his mouthguard, which hit a fan, and was ejected. From there, the ""beef"" seemed real.  It resurfaced on Thursday in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals, when the two exchanged words after James blocked a shot by Curry. James eventually pushed Curry out of the way, rankling Klay Thompson, who exchanged some words with James afterward.  Thompson said the root of this disdain for Curry came from his leapfrogging so many players so quickly in the NBA's elite and receiving adoration for it.  McIntyre brought up an incident in which Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook laughed when they were asked about Curry's defense in 2016. Thompson said it was another example of the chasm between Curry and some of the NBA's stars:  ""I think if you ask them and they were being honest, they don't like all the hype he gets, and they have to direct it that way. I think out of all of them, if somebody doesn't like Steph Curry, I think it's probably Westbrook. He just shows no sign of - this really ain't about Steph. It's bigger. His seems to be, 'I don't like that dude.' ""But LeBron and them, I think they will say: 'Man, I like Steph. We can have a conversation.' But there's something that burns them about the fact that Steph is the one that is exalted, and because of that, they want to go at him and, in fact, kind of demean his hype. They want to take him down."""
"Curry and Thompson had sprained ankles coming into the series. Neither looks right. (Thompson is shooting perfectly on line but can't get the range right, which really looks like he can't rely on the lift from his ankles.)  Curry dislocated his finger. That shit hurts for months, and dude shoots with two hands and it's visibly fucking with his dribble. It happened during this series, I'd have thought even Rockets fans would have been aware of that one.  DeMarcus Cousins tore his quad.  Kevin Durant has a calf strain."
"The award has meant as much as it ever has. It is important and it is noted. I get what you are saying though, that you wish your favorite player got fmvp each year. Unfortunately that's not the way it goes. The best player gets it. Kevin Durant won those honors the last two years. There is no bias against Steph Curry. He just hasn't hasn't rose to the occasion yet. But maybe he will do it this year"
"""Kevin Durant like frame"" haha"
Lmaooooo if Kevin fucking durant comes at you asking for the max you get on your needs and prepare to whip out that big fat check book deposit it into his big fat checking account.
"MVP - **Kevin Durant** \- if he leaves in FA will go off next year if not yeah I agree with **Anthony Davis.**   DPOY - **Giannis Antetokounmpo** \- will continue to be a monster guarding 1-5 on defense.   MIP - **Marvin Bagley** \- averaged 15 and 7.5.. think he can improve this to 20 and 10 or **Gordon Hayward** \- banking on this if Kyrie leaves.. giving him more of the offensive focus.. could see him going from 11, 4 and 4 to 20-24, 6 and 6.  6MOY - **Domantas Sabonis** \- if he still is coming off the bench and keeps improving he will defiantly be a top 3 candidate.    COY - **Doc Rivers** \- will get an all-star free-agent and I think any of them would fit into a Clippers system well. Think they could be underdogs again and get a 50 win season possibly.   ROY - **Zion Williamson -** no other answer"
I agree but there are 2 free agents who could make them a conference finalist favorite: Kawaii Leonard or Kevin Durant. Plus they need shooting to surround whoever they have next year.
Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are skilled players. They get into better rhythm when Kevin Durant off the floor. That first 2014-2015 season was special team.
"K so Kevin Durant is doing very well as we all know, but he has only done it through two series, while Lebrun would have done it throughout the entire playoffs."
Kevin Durant
Rodney Hood or Kevin Durant?  Same person I think.
"""Personally I think Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the league right now, but James Harden did phenomenal during the regular season as well. Anyways, did you see the cumshot on that slut! They're gonna need to throw her in a carwash to wipe her clean!"""
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard. That's all.
Why? Kevin Durant may leave altogether this offseason and the league is wide open again.
"Bottom line is he hasn’t won a championship on his own except against a team that couldn’t fight back. Not saying he can’t, he’s just never proven he can. Everyone has bad stretches but people always speculate if curry is hurt any time he’s struggling. His game looks invincible in the regular season but it can be slowed down and he can be off. A good solution for his struggles though was adding Kevin Durant."
"It's not even about ""take what you can get"".  Who in their right mind would max Jimmy Butler over Kevin Durant?"
"Coming back from injury in 2016 he set a playoff record for points in overtime against the Blazers.  Down 3-1 against the Thunder he put up 31/7/6 with 5 steals, 31/10/9, then 36/5/8.  In a critical Game 5 of 2015 he put up 37/7/4.  In the 2017 finals he averaged 27/8/9.   In the 2018 finals he averaged 28/6/7 and set an NBA record for threes in a game.  Literally last night, Kevin Durant went down and Curry scored 20 points in the second half to see them through.   His career playoff averages are 26/5/6 on the highest efficiency of any player over 20 ppg in playoff history. He has the NBA record for most threes in the playoffs in far fewer games than anyone else on that list.   He's had bad stretches in the playoffs. As has LeBron, Kobe, Durant, Nowitzki, and nearly any great player you can think of who plays in enough playoff games. He admittedly gets banged up more often than most players, and seems to get more affected by that playoff wear and tear than most players. That's a valid criticism and limitation. But to act like he hasn't earned respect in the playoffs is totally unfair. He's got a ring and a finals appearance all on his own, and he's a massive reason why the Warriors won the last two as well."
"Harden is top 3? How? He's better than Giannis, LeBron, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, kawhi?    Are you delusional lmao"
Last year Rockets won game 5 to take the series 3-2 and lost CP3   Warriors win game 5 to take series 3-2 and lose Kevin Durant    Game 5 next year how about all the superstars sit out
This [random page](https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-who-has-been-better-this-postseason-kawhi-leonard-or-kevin-durant-toronto-raptors-golden-state-warriors/lru4tvqqmkct1x2wlhy1wlstj) on the internet agrees with you
Why is Kevin Durant laying around on center court?
"If the Nuggets win I think Durant should sit out the next series just to be safe. Nothing is more important than your health, Kevin!"
"Where did I say it was keeping Curry up at night?  What are you even talking about.  All I said was that he is probably slightly peeved that KD has stolen some of his shine, and even a FMVP from him.  Does that mean he doesn't wan't him on the team? Obviously not. You'd have to be an idiot to not want Kevin Durant on your team.   &gt;It's a shame a segment of NBA fans need the game to be like pro-wrestling drama between games  Honestly just get off your high-horse. You're creating some imaginary enemies to slander so you can try and feel superior. It's pretty sad."
"that's actually not true, it's hard to play with other stars especially when you're used to being ball dominant. Durant got a bit lucky in our situation because our stars/coach had implemented a system of unselfish basketball and draymond was not afraid to enforce the rules. But you see a lot of situations where stars gather together and they have difficulties coexisting because they want the ball so much. Richard Jefferson for example was a near superstar before joining the Spurs and couldnt handle not having the ball. Same thing with Kevin Love on the Cavs or the current Celtics situation."
"Every team with cap space will offer Jimmy the max, outside of the teams that have already used their cap space up to sign Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant."
"Kemba gave a look of pleasant surprise. Kyrie belted, “We got an [expletive] clan now.” And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett said, “Da fuq is this?”"
"Interestingly it looks like so far Kevin Durant, Kawhi, and Giannis are head to head for a surefire #1 place, pretty interesting."
"Ah yes, elite defenders Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Ok."
Kevin Durant has won as many playoff series without an all-star teammate as Westbrook.
are y’all serious?   kevin durant.
I have a hard time believing anyone can beat Kevin Durant.
lol and if John Stockton had Kevin Durant on his team Stockton wouldn’t be considered the best player either. As a matter of fact John Stockton usually was not the best player on his team for most of his career.
Kevin Durant as a talent is easily top 15 of all time so it’s hard to knock on Steph for not being the best on his team. But he has the accomplishments to be considered top 10-20 along with kd
That Kyrie is coming and now they have room for one Kevin Durant.
They both pass to Kevin Durant.
"“Excuse me can I play Kevin of Durant in the Monstarfish?”  “No, Brandon. You’re—you’re in the wave”  Lmao"
I dont understand how keeping a ball hog on your team is going to attract Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant. That dude couldn't hack it with the best player in the world and keep going to the finals every year because he is a weak ass punk with no heart. I hate the Celtics but they'll be better off. The dude can't win on his own because he thinks he is smarter than everyone.
Nah Durant. Kevin Durant has stayed remarkably healthy and is unstoppable on offence.   The dude is a 7 footer with the skills of a guard.
"&gt; If you want some scrub go to an eliminated house, if you want a king earn him   Kevin “Cersei Lannister” Durant"
"Lol and why do people always try to switch the argument up? Of fucking course they are better with Kevin Durant. But they are still really good without him. Rockets in 5 is an incredibly dumb take, dont try to move the goal post now."
"2011-2014 Heat, 2015-2017 Cavs. Joining the 2nd and 12th best player in the NBA's team when you are the the best invalidates anything you accomplish- see Kevin Durant. Kyrie and Kevin Love both top 15 players also. How could he have done any worse on these teams? Replace him with literally any top 20 all time player and they do AT LEAST as well as he did on these teams."

Kevin Durant won't go play for the Knicks unless someone else is coming. No way he's just gonna go play on his own.

Kevin Durant junior
"Klay Thompson hits a 3 early in the game, looks toward the Raptors bench, and rips off his mask to reveal the face of Kevin Durant."
“Kevin Durant is coming back for the Finals” is the new “Kawhi doesn’t have any issue with Spurs management he’ll be back next year”
"Not Kevin Durant... because of the calf and all, hard to leap."
I know the media is so crazy. They call their team overpowered with Kevin Durant and without him they can't beat an OK raptors team.
"It’s just reporting news. No one said “in a surprising turn of events, Kevin Durant will not play..”"
I think it's a conspiracy to keep Kevin Durant out of Game 4 so that the Warriors lose the series.
Watching McKinnie and Jerebko airballs open 3s and realizing that that would normally be *Kevin Durant* lmao
"Kevin Durant already isn't coming back for the finals, so..."
What happens if an inactive player in street clothes shoves an opponent after a play? What if you replace this guy with Kevin Durant?
they have 3 rings because kevin durant is a soft bitch
Well yeah Kevin Durant hadn't shed his skin yet.
Also a team without Kevin Durant.
That 73-9 team didn’t have Kevin Durant.
Paul Pierce is just pulling a Billy Madison for Kevin Durant.
Richard Jefferson sucks ass  I love Kevin Durant.
shades of Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant will not be returning to this series.
"&gt; Jordan is a better offensive player  How? Lebron scores almost as much as Jordan and also playmakes for others.  &gt;All of the stats back this up.   No they don't. Lebron has better counting stats. More points all time regular season and playoffs. More blocks, more assists, more rebounds more game winners. He's more efficient better FG%, 3pt%, TS%. Lebron has the highest elimination game scoring average of all time.  He has many advanced stats better than Jordan such as box plus minus, VORP, and win shares.  Lebron has literally won more games. He's scored more points than Jordan in less games.  &gt;LeBron was just physically bigger and more athletic than most of his competition.   This is not true and demonstrates that you have an untrained eye and do not understand Lebron's game at all. There are plenty of players with similar body types to Lebron such as James Johnson on the Heat. Why doesn't he just be Lebron if there is no skill involved?  There is plenty of skill and footwork involved in Lebron's game. For example in transition [Lebron will use footchops or double hops](https://streamable.com/kjgjk) to get defenders out of position.  &gt; They think, wow he's bigger, stronger, and faster and people can't stop his very basic offensive skillset.   Yeah, if they only understand very simple basketball. You have no understanding of the intelligence in Lebron's game so let me show you a play another user clipped. Here is a play the Cavs like to run for Kevin Love: https://streamable.com/gxrbd.   They get a point guard to set a screen for Love. What usually happens is the point guard doesn't want to switch onto Love, and the big guy doesn't want to switch onto a point guard, so both defenders hesitate. The Cavs like to take advantage of this moment of hesitation by having Love sprint to the basket for an open layup.  If they don't get that, they can get the switch with a small on Love so Love can post up or shoot over him, and a big on a point guard so the guard can try blowing by him.  But now this same play against another intelligent player like Draymond doesn't work. Here it is: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond understands what the Cavs are trying to do. Jordan Bell is hesitant to switch off of Love so he holds onto him so he doesn't get screened off, and so Love backdoors him and runs to the rim. But he can't get open because Draymond goes and stands in his way.  Lebron intelligently recognizes that Draymond has figured out the play, and so he calls Draymond's man Tristan Thompson to come set a screen for him. The screen easily rubs off Durant who has no idea what's going on, and Lebron knows he's getting an open jumpshot because Draymond has committed to stopping the play on the baseline. Draymond rushes over to contest when he realizes Lebron has countered him, but it's a late contest and James win the possession.   THAT is just a sample of the beauty and skill of Lebron's game. He has all the physical tools, yet he is also able to engage in mental games in the middle of a rigorous exercise. And he's got the skills to make it all work as well so he is a complete player. That's his claim as the GOAT."

Kevin Durant didn’t bulk up at all ever since he went into the NBA
"Usher probably like ""Sir, Kevin Durant had invited you to join him for the rest of the game. Follow me"""
"3rd quarter dubs minus Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kevon Looney yes"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportingnews.com/us/amp/other-sports/news/kevin-durant-true-height-demarcus-cousins-usa-olympic-basketball/11x65h8jsxzug1phpkzq0ar4iz  Dude is 7'1 in shoes. It's a common joke in NBA circles that his 6'9 listed height is a joke. He's a rare human, obviously. Certainly within the realm of possibility he grew after age 19."
"He's playing nowhere near ""perennial all star"" level since his injury you should try actually watching the games for a change  If you honestly don't think the Warriors missing Klay, Looney, and Kevin fucking Durant didn't essentially hand Toronto the W then you are the biggest nephew in this sub"
Oh of course. Lebron chose to have srub teammates he passed on adding James Harden and Kevin Durant to his team lmao. Get out of here there are only role players for teams to choose from to pick up.   He never ever threatened to leave he even signed a 2 year deal after the 2015 finals.
Kevin Durant
People rarely are Kevin Durant.
The difference is Curry had to do that for 1 game and LeBron did it for the entire playoffs for multiple years. This is the only adversity Curry has had to face this year and he came up short. LeBron has several wins to balance out the losses. If you are a champion then you win that instead of blaming the supporting cast and people don't give you pity parties for coming up short - because that's beneath a champion.  If you must make the comparison if all LeBron had to do was get through this one game and he'd have Klay Thompson and possibly Kevin Durant back he'd have won it. How can we be so sure? Because we've seen him do it without the promise of help on the way.
"Yeah that was obvious when the guy has Kevin Durant as his flair, the bandwagon player himself.  Although KD is actually hot fire and the Warriors are definitely missing him."
"Totally agree, it is evenly matched without KD, warriors are OP and become extreme favorites with him playing. I will be finishing my book on how Kevin Durant ruined basketball, stay tuned."
"He's out playing the guy who is injured? Nice. We might as well say that Steph is the best player in the league. After all, he is outplaying Kevin Durant and LeBron right now."

Kevin Durant wants to know your location
Is Kevin Durant even at these games? I never see him on the bench when they pan to it.
Disadvantaged? 2 future HoFers and Half of Boogie Cousins. LeBron had Timofey Mozgov and got mocked for losing. They'll be fine. They only have Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant coming back soon.
"That’s fair, but Kevin Durant and klay Thompson are out. That’s not even close to the same"
You realize Kevin fucking Durant and Klay Thompson are hurt right and didn’t play.
Steph Curry's Legacy 2015: Beat a Cavs team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. FMVP is Iggy.  2016: Blew a 3-1 lead and was LeBron's bitch. 2017: Durant saved his ass. 2018: Durant saved his ass. Again.
"....And if Kevin Durant was healthy? What would the series look like then, Nostradamus?"
"On level 2 of the game, the other team gets a Kevin Durant alongside their already top 3 player!  On level 3 a random starter on your team is replaced with JR Smith!"
"Remember a few years ago when Steph came back from injury against Portland. He took about a quarter to get adjusted then roasted em, in Portland.   This is Kevin fuckin Durant."
Kevin Durant just ran for the first time in 3 weeks on Monday. This is the NBA not rec league. He's not going to literally hop up off the couch and drop 40 in the finals.
If he's unsure then he probably won't play as the Kevin Durant we know. But still anything is better than nothing but then again the Raps are really good.
Curry has always played with the second best shooter of all time not named Stephen. LeBron would have killed for JR Smith to have instead been any of: Klay Thompson. Kevin Durant. Draymond Green. DeMarcus Cousins. Andre Iguodala. Shaun Livingston.
If you replace Kevin Durant with Kyrie you get a whole new meaning
Kyrie and Kevin Love &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Klay and Kevin fucking Durant
"Man, lucky for the Raptors that Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson didn’t play in Game 3. They pretty much have it in the bag now!"
The Knicks are also winless in the Finals without Kevin Durant in the past 20 years.
"I forgot that Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala, and oh yeah Kevin Durant died."
""" i hope Kevin Durant is not going to play again this year"""
Why you talking like the series is over lol they are still missing one Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant backstage crying in his momma's arms.
"""The Warriors are better without Kevin Durant"" Yeah no...Just no."
"Before the overreactions start.  Let me say congratulations to the Toronto Raptors for winning the Finals. They absolutely earned it and deserve it for being the best team in the NBA.  Second, I have gained so much respect for Stephen fucking Curry. He played the best offensive and defensive team with no real help to help carry the load from his team. He gave it his everything every game and you can see that in his stats and game. You can tell he just gave up when Kawhi made that easy up in a Game 3 Away game.  No Klay Thompson, No Kevin Durant.  I honestly do believe these Finals could have ended differently in 7 games had the Warriors had a healthy team. Until then, I will see you guys [next season!](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3a4h3t/post_game_thread_the_golden_state_warriors_defeat/cs97cys/)"
"Man I didn’t even mention game 2, I don’t know where you’re coming from with this. I’m just thinking about this little dude named Kevin Durant coming back with Klay Thompson. You’re putting words in my mouth dude haha"
Lol gsw and a Kevin Durant flair.
"Here comes the ""we lost because of no Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant"" comments"
Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Kevin Durant?
I guess we'll be seeing Kevin Durant in game 4
It's true and you know it. Add Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant in to this game and it would have been over from tipoff.
"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-2019-warriors-hope-kevin-durant-does-enough-in-practice-to-make-game-4-return-against-raptors/ Mmmm, this story from today says that kerr hopes KD can get some light work in practice tommorow. Hmm"
Having Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on your team keeps you from having to score 40 a game you idiot.
Kevin Durant out game 4 with a broken heart
Kevin Durant Warriors need you lmfao
"Why??? The warriors winning without Kevin Durant would be impressive and literally no one is sufferable about the 2015 ring or put an asterisk next to it.  Instead they allude to this year’s Celtics and how it could go worse.  You and every nephew that upvoted this are insufferable, helping fuel how shit /r/nba has become"
"this series would be a lot more interesting if we had Kevin ""Kevon"" Durant"
So has Kevin Durant been shitting his pants for 9 days straight? Wtf is his excuse!!!!??? B
"Without Kevin Durant ruining the league, basketball is actually fun to watch."
Probably Kevin Durant.
"Curry is gonna have to be consistent, dudes already puffing air after one quarter...I wish he did but I doubt he has that gas tank, only a handful players can do this all game: Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant"
"raptors, because of kevin durant."
"“You might be missing guys, but there’s no excuse for bad defense.”  Ok Mark Jackson, because missing Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Kevon Looney would never ever affect your defensive capabilities. This guy is so hard to listen to lmao"
if golden state is serious about winning this game you trap kawhi and force toronto's role players to make three pointers tonight.  you don't have the talent to switch anything right now without 40 minutes of klay and kevin durant.
WHERE'S KEVIN DURANT
"Kevin Durant, so what would you say you do here"
First of all Kuzma isnt a starter. Hes best coming of the bench. Even with our current roster you can put Javale at C assuming we resign him.   &gt;You can't beat Kevin Durant when he can get Kyrie switched on him and then just shoot over him like he was doing in the 2017 finals.  You mean the Lakers are beating him now as constructed? Oh right...   KD is KD and is gonna score on everyone. We cant guard him anyway with our current roster but the difference with Kyrie is there is a fuckload more scoring on the team rather than just Ingram and LeBron. Kyrie +Lonzo backcourt is a complete upgrade over Lonzo + KCP/Stephenson/who ever else we throw in there. Especially considering KCPs defense isnt as good as it was in his first season here
"yeah he totally misread your comment.  someone was saying that Dame was gassed bc of lack of experience, then you said it was also because Golden State defense is amazing and Nurkic is gone so his role is larger.  according to your comment, if Kevin Durant came back it would have been even harder for Dame because Golden State is already really good already like you said.  then this guy comes in and says that it would be harder with Kevin Durant as if that's not exactly what everyone was already saying lol."
Can Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins name a single player of the White Sox roster?
You dont think the added defense from Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins would've effected how well Lillard does against the Warriors??   He could barely drive to the hoop as is that series without two additional 7 footers switching onto him every PnR and clogging the lane.
"There are so many problems with adding a small pg like Kyrie or Kemba. They are both downgrades on defense at the point guard position compared to Lonzo. The Lakers wouldn't be able to achieve their goal of a 5 man switch lineup with Kyrie. You can't beat Kevin Durant when he can get Kyrie switched on him and then just shoot over him like he was doing in the 2017 finals. How do you get past Harden when he's hunting Kyrie?  Also, if you keep Lonzo, that means he moves to the shooting guard spot. That pushes Brandon Ingram to small forward, Kuzma to power forward, and Lebron to center. So everybody gets out of position just for Kyrie."
Scoring is not the Lakers problem though. The Lakers led the league in FG% before Lebron went down. Even Lonzo was hitting his open 3s from Lebron. And they were a top 10 defense before the injuries too. But they can't rely on Javale Mcgee since he is not a reliable switch defender [he defends Deandre Jordan like he's Kevin Durant](https://streamable.com/q2eua). He's just not a smart enough player to rely on and he even stopped blocking shots after Lebron's injury.  Having both Lonzo and Kyrie is still a problem defensively because Kyrie is a weakness on defense. The Lakers plan all along was to build a switchable 5 man lineup. Lonzo is a big guard he is a huge asset because of that. Kyrie Irving would be a downgrade at that. Even Hart fights bigger players on defense. What the Lakers want and need is a replacement for Javale Mcgee that's why Ad is their choice. Ad can switch and defend most positions just like the other Lakers.
"Kevin Durant is the Ronaldo to Lebron Messi, he's arguably one of the greatest scorers to exist, and he has single-handedly won games on his own with insane and absurd scoring. It will send shockwaves because teams were gearing up to max him out and for him to make contending teams on his own but now he won't be able to play at all for a year so it changes everyone's plans"
Yes but you can’t seriously compare Steph curry and Kevin Durant to Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili
LeBron with this Raptors team versus Warriors without Kevin Durant?  Easy LeChampionship
"No. But also, neither kyrie Irving nor Kevin love are as good as either Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson."
"Normally I would simply look at a comment like this and say ""hmph, he's probably going to get downvoted for not only being so irrationally on one side, but also being only emotional and crass."" I'd move on, knowing that I agree, but knowing there was no use in upvoting. But god damn does this fucking hit home with me. Fuck Boogie for never having sportsmanship, always acting like a child on and off the court, and acting like the world belongs to him. And after all of that, he felt like he could simply go to Golden State, win a championship, and get away with it scott-free. And he probably would have, if it wasn't for his, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson's injury. Which makes it so much sweeter that he lost. Today, I stand with you and will take the downvotes. Fuck Boogie. He carries himself like an entitled little bitch.  TL;DR - I agree. Demarcus Cousins is a fucking pussy."
Seeing all these people compare Kyrie and Love to Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant is hysterical man
"So what Cavs made an Australian dude a super star when Kyrie and Kevin were out   Warriors loaded on All Stars   Curry, Dray, Klay, Durant, and Cousins   And they also had Finals MVP Andre Igudola coming from the bench  They also had Andrew Bogut coming off bench. Warriors were unfairly stacked this whole year."
There are still chances  Kevin Durant come here bby
"In NBA, its easier to make these arguments because every individual star has SO much impact on the game relative to other teams sports like baseball/hockey etc  It also doesn't hurt that this particular team's stars are not JUST stars; they are Klay Thompson and Kevin f'ing Durant. Some of the best scorers of all time.  But all that said; it is what it is. This is team sports, that's how she goes. NBA is particularly narrative driven as well, so we will be hearing about this asterisk for awhile"
"Maybe, maybe not. The Spurs were washed up zombies at that point. Kawhi Leonard isn't Kevin Durant, especially back then. Kawhi is top 5. Kevin is top 2. Then you take out Klay and my point is absolutely made."
why would you need a flair to make fun of kevin durant?

"I do, even though Kevin Durant is a better isolation scorer. Steph Curry has the advantage in playmaking, playing off ball, and the gravity he exerts on the defense. Plus he can score from all areas on the court just like Kevin Durant."
If anyone can convince Kevin Durant to come home it'd be him. Wizards need to get him at all costs.
Drunk people cheering when their team gets lead &gt; people celebrating the fact the Kevin Durant suffered a monster injury. Cry me a fucking river.
"Losing kevin durant is not like losing kevin love, if you have lebron and love injured, then its a fair comparison, but that’s not what happened  Also, it says in an article by cbs that It's 8-12 months. In theory, if he comes back in lets say 9 months, that’s in march, before the playoffs, so in most scenarios he comes back before or during the playoffs. There is definitely a chance he doesn’t come back, but sources say there is a chance he does come back"

"&gt;On the other hand, if they would've said it was his achilles, the Raptors would've known there was no chance he could play.  &amp;#x200B;  And more to that point, the warriors probably wanted to keep the option for Kevin Durant to return on the table so no way they would announce an injury like that..."

the 73 win team that added kevin fucking durant had the breaks go against them for once? how sad
Masai Ujiri said that he loved Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson... was that tampering? lol
Why'd u use Durant instead of Kevin huh
Kevin Durant died for this.
Kevin Durant.  Him not playing is the only reason they won lmao.
Let’s see if this sub tries to pretend that losing Kyrie and Love is equivalent to losing Klay and Kevin fucking Durant
Appreciate the take but you just compared Conley to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and you should therefore be fucking ashamed.
Golden State would have absolutely massacred Toronto if healthy.  Broken Kevin Durant in game 5 looked like he could have scored 50.  Imagine over an entire series?  KD is probably the one player in the league right now who is immune to Kawhi Leonard.
Lmao. They lost KEVIN DURANT and KLAT THOMPSON for significant time. If healthy they win easily buddy

"Warriors fought a close ass game without Kevin Durant, and only have klay for 2.5 quarters.  This would’ve been a close series if both teams were healthy, but it’s the playoffs and everyone’s hurt.  This was a fun series, but I will remember it like I remembered the Warriors vs Cavs, when everyone on the Cavs was hurt.   GGs, is it F5 season now?"
FUCK the Warriors  FUCK Steph  FUCK Kevin Durant  FUCK Draymond  FUCK Klay Thompson
" I think we all need to recognise what the Warriors had to deal with in these finals, even in defeat.      Kevon Looney was constantly on and off with injury, with reports thinking he was done for the season. Klay Thompson was injured twice, missing 1 and a half games of the finals.       And above all that, the back to back Finals MVP, Kevin fucking Durant (34PPG) suffered an Achilles injury, playing only 11 minutes in the entire NBA finals.      Imagine any other team having to play under these circumstances happening to their team’s players. Credit to the fight of the Golden State Warriors."

The same raptor fans that cheered when Kevin Durant got injured probably booed Randy when he tried to jump the cheeseburger.
"I hate this take so much. I want to watch Kevin Durant play. I want to watch Klay Thompson play. I want to watch the most talented players on the 2 most talented teams in the most talented league in the world duke it out. Acting like the series is somehow more entertaining because it's ""competitive"" (even though it was looking more like a Raps blowout then a close series) when 2 of the 4 most talented players involved are out is nonsensical."
My heart is breaking for Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant w. You know they would both sell their souls to be out there on the court right now.
Difference between a good second man being out and Kevin fucking Durant.  We know how the series would have gone with KD/fully healthy teams. Come on now.

"Well that seems unnecessary.  You must have jumped on the bandwagon very recently.  See, in game 5 raptor fans cheered when Kevin Durant went down with an injury.    https://youtu.be/DqsNTRzqCSQ  Thing is, there were identical cheers outside the arena too.  This is why it’s extremely likely they were cheering when klay went down too."

Steph Curry blocks Kahwii Leonard on a dead ball in latest sign Kevin Durant is headed to New York.
"Yeah, but he won't play next year, so nobody could know what type of in-game form he returns to when signing him as a free agent in the summer of 2020.  It will be a gamble for whichever team does so, but somebody will--it's Kevin Fucking Durant.  So it makes more sense for him to opt in with the Warriors now and get the long term max after.  If he signs a max elsewhere now, he may not be able to make the 31.5 million that he can make in Golden State next year in the year following that contract, due to his health and age."

"80% of Durant doesn't leave an all-time legacy in the NBA history. 80% of Durant doesn't reshape the landscape of the NBA by his simple presence like a Lebron/Curry/Harden.  His livelihood is not at risk, his legacy is. Durant is a GOAT-tier level talent in the NBA, him merely being a superstar in the last few years of his prime robs the NBA and fans of something truly special.  Imagine my dream scenario, he comes to NY with another superstar and takes us to a championship. He instantly becomes a legend in NY and makes himself a legacy that few in NBA history has. It was always unlikely, but Kevin Durant is capable of that. 80% of KD isn't.  This shit is tragic. I really hope KD can come back at 100%."

"the disrespect this dude gets here even when injured...   Honestly, I do not believe there's a single GM who wouldn't sign him tomorrow. It's a gamble... but you're gambling on one of the best offensive players who is an insane shooter at almost 7 feet. You fucking sign Kevin Durant if you can sign Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant being 7 ft tall is such a huge deal because no one else can move like that at this height.  If his quickness and explosiveness off the dribble diminishes then so will his ability to score.
Kevin Durant is very much alive.
Kevin “Wade Boggs” Durant
"I root for my team, and certain players. I don't watch solely for the likelihood to compete for a title. I watch for the moments. I watch for my small market team to deliver an 8 vs 1 upset, for it to resonate with the community in a unique way, with a unique slogan. I watch for Zach Randolph to wrestle Blake Griffin or Kendrick Perkins to the ground, for Tony Allen to lock down Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant and yell 1st Team in front of a national audience, for Mike Conley to return from a broken face and lead the team to a lead over the MVP and leading record Warriors, for Marc Gasol to pull a Conor McGregor celebration. I keep watching for future stars Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson, and Brandon Clarke to inherit and adapt that legacy to their own personalities.   Competing for a title has usually been a process for the NBA, ever since the late 80s and the Pistons. Struggle, get close, next year get a bit closer, and the year after closer still.   An NBA season has hundreds of moments other than the final series, more than several every year for each franchise. The privilege of watching and appreciating the NBA is in experiencing as many of those moments as possible, even beyond your team.  Next year, my team is expected to be the worst in the Western Conference. Yet I cannot wait to see our young players develop, work together, build a foundation for a competitive future."
i had a few drinks and have to get up at 5 am tomorrow so im not really in the mood to read an essay about why you don't like kevin durant. sorry
"Was it really the best job offer though?   Made him less marketable, made fans hate him, made him lose respect among his peers, made him lose money from his contract.   I always viewed that move as going after short term gains rather than long term gains.   Short term? Two rings and two finals MVPs. But they came at the cost of his legacy.   Long term? If he beats them with OKC or with literally any other team that doesn't have LeBron on it, then he's a golden god for life. His career would be viewed much more positivitely than it is now. He could have had the accolades and the respect that goes with them. What he got is hollow.   You could argue that he never would have beaten Golden State. Even if you hold that opinion, I would rather be mentioned in a sentence with Charles Barkley and Karl Malone as being among the greatest to never win than to be mentioned with the biggest sellout of all time, Kevin Durant.  For any fans who want to say ""but rings!""...Durant is living breathing proof that not all rings are created equal."
"James Harden yelled, “There you go!” Kendrick Perkins gave a look of mild surprise. Serge Ibaka belted, “We had a fucking squad then.” And before Russell Westbrook hit the exit door, ex-OKC star Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “We look so different.”"
Just a smart ass way to say I'm sad because WEBRON didn't get Kevin Durant and that CROOKED Curry got him instead.

"&gt;“Imagine taking Russ off that team, see how bad they were. Kd can’t win a championship with those cats.”  A tweet from one of his burner accounts.  [Source](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets)"
Kevin Durant
"Errr, it's not like this is Kevin Durant signing with GS where the rest of the league is fucked. Last year showed that there is hope, by my count the Warriors,, Cavs and Raptors all could have won it all. Shit, who am I kidding? We all know that only thing that can stop Patrick McCaw's team in July is his team in June."
"Uh, we've seen him on the Thunder without Kevin Durant for 3 years, in which he has not had a single deep playoff run? He's not a trash player like the narrative some people are pushing but let's not act like he's just gonna lead any team to a playoff run"
"For one, Lonzo Ball won’t be sharing the point guard responsibilities. It will only be Lebron’s job to initiate the offense. Maybe he looks exactly the same as he was before except now he’ll have more responsibility because there’s no other playmaker interfering with his play style. Your sadly wrong if you think my argument is that Lebron’s game completely changes now that he plays point guard. That’s how it’ll appear on the stat sheet. Yes he’s been a point forward in previous years but we’re labelling him what we’ve known him to do now and there’s no other playmaker to interfere with that. Regardless, don’t move the goal posts. In your first argument, you said Lebron should not be referred to as a point guard but he is the point guard now. It’s all him. Whenever Zo initiated the offense, Lebron would slide down to the forward position. It’s just how the NBA is.  Green is 6’6 with long ass arms. He could very much play Small Forward.   Third of all as I’ve said many times, this league no longer depends on 1 on 1 matchups. This is a league where Pat Bev, a Point Guard, guarded Kevin Durant, a Small Forward. Defensive matchups mean nothing and teams can adjust regardless of the other team. When the Lakers play the Sixers. I’m sure Lebron will Guard Simmons so it’s a PG guarding a PG."
"No problem. The thing about the ""modern NBA"" is that these roles are becoming less and less strict. Big players like LeBron, Kevin Durant, giannis are more skilled and perimeter oriented than in any era in the past.   It's pretty common to say that we are in a positionless era in basketball, because players like them are so versatile and play out of what their traditional position would be, the 1-5 model doesn't fit as nicely as it has in the past. It's still a useful guideline, but positions mean much less than in other sports."
He's top 10 over who on this list?  &amp;#x200B;  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant   Kawhi Leonard  Joel Embiid  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Lebron James  Paul George   Anthony Davis  Nikola Jokic
I agree Kevin Durant unless he some how ends up in a different situation than currently will never win a Championship with Brooklyn the way it is. If they would have kept DLO... Different story.
"If Kevin Durant couldn't win a ring with career teammates such as Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Delonte West, and Mitch McGary, who can he win with?"
[OC] Just how bad was Russell Westbrook when Kevin Durant missed a game?
"If James Harden can't win a ring with career teammates such as Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard - who can he win with?"
So basically Kevin Durant is a title belt.
Kevin Durant is going to be absolutely reviled and ridiculed by everyone in the city and he is going to be completely surprised.  New Yorkers are built different when it comes to expressing their opinions and they don't really get starstruck.  Dolan literally had to resort to banning people from MSG because he gets heckled everywhere he goes.  A-Rod heckling stories are legendary.
"What if I told you Oklahoma City had Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Serge Ibaka all in their primes and failed to win a title."
Kevin Durant and it really isn’t close
Kevin Durant doesn't have friends
"I really hope this is his last year. For his sake and our teams sake.  He's an okay coach but it can't be easy to lose Kevin Durant, Paul George, and Russ in just 4 years.  The team just needs a new coach and a rebrand after Russ gets traded."
"&gt;Danny Green has a better TS% than Kevin Durant and you’re gonna act like he’s better offensively?  ...Eric Gordon isn't Kevin Durant, almost all of Eric Gordon's shots are assisted just like Danny Green"
I didn’t say they don’t mean shit but judging a player comparison by 1 stat and loose defensive statements is so flawed it’s not funny. Danny Green has a better TS% than Kevin Durant and you’re gonna act like he’s better offensively? Cause apparently that’s the stat that indicates how good of a scorer you are
"Why would we trade for Russ? He couldn’t even win chips with Kevin Durant, how is he winning with 19 year old Barrett?"
"So he went to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Jimmy Butler before trying to get PG13? Lol"
You’re ignoring Klay getting hurt and the fact they sacrificed that depth to be able to get Kevin Durant.  I also don’t understand the point of this.
"The one with Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Rashard Lewis, and Mo Williams rapping  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeBd-_sI8aM"
Kevin Durant is criticized for bailing on the Thunder because he couldn't win with those cats.   But the Raptors and Ujiri are praised for bailing on Derozen for the same reason.
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Kemba Walker, Kawhi Leonard, D'Angelo Russell, Paul George, Anthony Davis, and now Russell Westbrook are all 2019 All-Stars changing teams. Plus Nowitzki and Wade retiring. That's 41% of the All-Star roster last year. Plus Klay and Oladipo are hurt. Only 52% of last year's All-Stars will actually play for the same team Opening Night  And that's with Jimmy Butler not being an All-Star."
"Here’s a good explanation of why there was immediate benefit from the Nets perspective. Without this, they would have had a harder time signing everyone. Everyone had to agree to it, so they all deserve some thanks.   &gt;https://twitter.com/AlbertNahmad  &gt;Follow the next set of tweets very closely, to see how the Brooklyn Nets will employ salary cap magic on July 6, to squeeze an extra $9.2 million out of thin air!  &gt;The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!  &gt;The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!  &gt;The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!  &gt;OK, so how are the Nets going to do it? Here are the steps:  &gt;The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  &gt;Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  &gt;The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  &gt;The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  &gt;And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!  &gt;For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!  &gt;Kevin Durant doesn’t necessarily need to take anything below his $38.2M max to make the math work. Kyrie Irving might need to take as little as $420K less than his $32.7M max. But if he really wants that $420K, he can take it as some sort of unlikely bonus (by signing first)!"

Kevin Durant has become a Flat Earther because Kyrie got him to drink the Kool-Aid.    That's why he went to Brooklyn.  SF was too close to the edge.
"I mean, they had Kevin Durant last season, and the offense still peaked higher with Curry handling the ball"
"Okay sure I don't quite follow Durant as extensively... But at least now you understand that yes LeBron was villianized but yes he deserved those MVPs during years that maybe the superstar talent levels were inferior to recent years.   All things considered, Kevin Durant was never a clear MVP candidate during his time on the warriors. Their system did not allow for it and you could see by the frustrations by Draymond green that led to their inevitable split. Durant needs the ball in his hands and I'm sure his MVO legitimacy will be cermented with his time in New York where he and Kyrie will be the only ones touching the ball.   Also, MVP stands for most valuable player. And this is distinctly associated to your value and your team's performance which is sometimes derived from how a team would perform without you. The warriors would still be Western conference final favorites had Durant never joined.    And yes you are correct, they needed to sell a narrative to push ticket sales and it damn sure worked. NBA contracts are inflating and the NBA is thriving in the current state."
Kevin Durant won back to back finals MVPs.  The warriors were clearly different without Durant in the finals.  It’s obvious what Durant meant to that team.
Some more Lebron series:  Lebron vs Washington 35.7/5.5/7.5 on  60 TS %   Lebron vs Warriors  33.6/12/10 on 63 TS%  &amp;#x200B;  One Kevin Durant series:  &amp;#x200B;  Kevin vs Cavs 35.2/8.4/5.4 on a ridiculous 69 TS%
"Markets do matter. Being well-run is a clincher between two big market franchises, all other things being equal, however.  Up until recently the Lakers were better run than the Clippers. Leonard and George choosing the Clippers is a testament to them actually putting in the effort to exploit their market instead of being satisfied with being the second fiddle.   Similarly, without Sean Marks joining the Nets Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving won't be there."
Fun Fact : Kevin Durant
How do Thunder fans feel knowing Kevin Durant is the greatest player that has played for their team and will be getting his jersey retired by another team?
HE beat them? That's funny I didn't see him beat LeBron James or Kevin Durant. I didn't see him go out there and beat Steph Curry in a 1v1. Foh.
ESPN: Kevin Durant admits that he will be 20% of himself pre-injury.  Stephen A what do you think about this?
When Kevin Durant is able to play basketball again he will be 32 and coming back from an injury that nobody has successfully comeback from.
I like Kevin Durant.
"1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Giannis (Not even trying to spell the last name)  5. James Harden  6. Anthony Davis  7. Paul George  8. Steph Curry  9. Joel Embiid  10.  Kyrie Irving  Hard to leave a lot of guys off this list: Westbrook, Lillard, Thompson, Jokic, etc."
"&gt; Yes. They are the team that has been the best against the Warriors the last two years, and the Warriors are not the juggernaut they were any more without Kevin Durant.  Last I checked Toronto actually beat the warriors so they're actually the best against the warriors, but that's being pedantic.    You're using the warriors as a litmus test for title favorites even though that team doesn't exist anymore and they lost the title.  There's no guarantee that Toronto and Cleveland the year before don't beat the Rockets.  The year the celtics with ray allen, pierce, and KG won their chip, they were taken to 7 by an upstart 8th seed Atlanta team, that ALSO never managed to get to the ECF in subsequent years.     &gt;I think it's pretty stupid to judge a roster while they are still signing players. Were you shitting on the Lakers for only having 4 players signed while they kept cap space open for Kawhi too?  HOLD ON, it's pretty stupid to judge a roster while they're still signing, but apparently it's not stupid to call them title favorites?    &gt;Houston will sign another big or two. Faried is likely coming back. They can probably get some guys like Zaza or Tyson Chandler to give them backup minutes.  That's adorable.  I'm sure when the lakers or sixers trot out their currently signed frontcourt combos of embiid/horford/simmons or lebron/AD/Cousins, houston's 6'6 PJ Tucker, 6'4 Eric Gordon, and 6'10 clint capela will be happy to know that Houston are the real title favorites because they might bring back Kenneth Faried and a couple other guys that completely fuck up their offensive system."
"https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146560882178056192  &gt; The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561014424621064  &gt; The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561112772685825  &gt; The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561386228719618  &gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561874684760069  &gt; Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561986936889344  &gt; The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562326730092544  &gt; The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562923239759872  &gt; And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146563484961910784  &gt; For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!"
"Locks:  Lebron, Curry, Durant, CP3, Kawhi, AD, Harden, Westbrook  Non obvious probables:  Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry  Too early to say but possible or likely:  Giannis, Jokic, Embiid, Kyrie  &amp;#x200B;  Probably forgetting some people"
"Here’s the thing:  Usually you can’t tell who is gonna be good based on summer league.  As in, lots of guys have done real well in summer league and it didn’t translate over.   But very rarely have guys stunk it up in summer league - if they played a meaningful amount of games and minutes - and gone on to be good.   Kevin Durant would go on to score 29 in a summer league game.  Trae Young shot 30%, but averaged 15 on the strength of 5 FTA per game and he also dropped 5.5 dimes per and had over a steal per as well.   RJ has rebounded well and he played some defense tonight.  Hopefully he gets going offensively and can put up a couple nice scoring nights. Probably will. But if he doesn’t, it isn’t insignificant."
"I was told Kyrie walked into the first film session with Kevin Durant and asked, “What does 8:17pm mean to you?”"
"Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, open 24/7 for your convenience."
&gt;If you played well in the SL it doesn't mean you will be good in the NBA but if you are bad in a SL game you have some serious problem  How do you feel about Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant should join the Paralympics next year while he is at it.
"“I heard you tell Kevin Durant he could have whatever contract he wants next year,” Fitzgerald said to Myers.  “That was just for the media. He can’t have anything like that at all,” Myers said. Kerr interjected: “Mid-level.”  “I think last year you told Steph (Curry) he could have any contract he wants, too,” Fitzgerald said.  “Yeah, that was different. He’s been here from the way-before days. He’s earned it,” Myers replied."
Kevin Durant. Seven Durant.  I like it!
"It might be Kevin Durant but an Achilles is still a serious and devastating injury. In fact, it’s a much, much worse injury than Hayward’s injury and KD will be 32 when he returns. KD also has had a history of a jones fracture, multiple calf strains and an ankle injury on the same leg. That history along with his 7 foot frame will play a huge role in his recovery. It’s just naive to act like this isn’t a serious injury by fans.  With all that said I’m hoping KD comes back strong and dominates the league as he has in the past."
I'll say it again.   The Nets aren't acquiring Kevin Durant until the 2020-2021 season.
"At the start of next season Joe Harris will be 28 and Dinwiddie 26. This Nets team as a whole is at a much more mature position than the Celtics young guys were.  And the guy coming back from injury is not Hayward, it's Kevin-freaking-Durant. No one is going to be upset about KD getting minutes, lol."
"Westbrook used to be one of my 8-10 favorite players in the league from like 2011-2015, i kept looking past his shot selection,decision making, and dodgy defensive effort...because a pg that gets highlight reel blocks and steals means he's obviously a good defender right?*sarcasm*.  he was extremely exciting to watch, the issue for me was playing with a player i loved even more in Kevin Durant who was exciting, extremely efficient, and better decision maker.  it just started to feel like Westbrook was getting in the way, you also had Curry as the PG on the rise at that point in time who was basically the opposite of Westbrook.  I still like WB but i am way more critical now"
"&gt;Kyrie has that ring because LeBron. Not because Kyrie.  This is just untrue, this is a team game, you can't win without your team. If it's true then it can be said for almost any player that wins a ring. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green only won because of Curry, Rodman and Pippen only won because of Jordan etc.   Guaranteed Lebron doesn't win without Kyrie, e.g. the previous year where Kyrie was injured and Lebron lost. Also Kyrie played very well in that finals, he's not as good as Lebron obviously but still had a 41 point game and all round played well including that huge 3 to put the Cavs up at the end of game 7, Lebron probably wouldn't have made that. The point is, Lebron needed Kyrie and Kyrie needed Lebron.   I also firmly believe the Cavs do not win if they have Westbrook in that situation instead of Kyrie.  I think we just get lost in Kyrie's antics and attitude (which is very annoying) that we forgot that he's actually a really good player.   I don't question Westbrook's heart and drive, but I think he's too ball dominant, he's inefficient, he shot 42.8% from the field this season, well below the league average of 46%, can't shoot the 3 very well but that won't stop him from taking them. Westbrook also has questionable decision making in shot attempts in general and passing which make him turnover prone. For these reasons I just can't really imagine him winning a championship unless he makes some changes to the way he plays. And it's not like Westbrook hasn't had opportunities to win either, he had bloody Kevin Durant on his team for multiple years and had a 3-1 lead vs the Warriors. I think head to head, Westbrook is probably the better player and his heart is what you want in every player, but I also believe that he's just the type of player that will never win a championship, even when put on good contending teams."
I'm Kevin Durant online.
Kevin Durant is an emotional lesbian
"Interesting... And why doesnt he want to go to the Knicks? Probably the same reason why Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard etc. didnt want to be there."
"Kevin Durant is not going to be the same. Brooklyn are gambling but hey, it’s a gamble you take every single time."
With Kevin Durant. Switch KD for PG and...2 1st round exits. Shows how good KD was tbh. Also Russ was way better back then too.
"kevin ""sourpatch kids"" durant  Kyrie ""big gulp"" irving"
1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Steph Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Paul George 10. Russell Westbrook
Kevin ‘totally matured’ Durant
"It looks cleaner, but honestly if I were stand near both versions of Kevin Durant I’d be more busy contemplating how there are two Kevin Durant’s to notice that the OP picture had different hair."
"Boston was too old to be a superteam. They had one good season and were done.   Miami was a great team but they were not nearly as talented as they're remembered. That Miami team was all Lebron.   And Cleveland? Kevin Love was overrated and Kyrie isn't really a superstar. The only reasob they got where they did was once again because of Lebron.   Like I said the only Superteam was the warriors. At the time they essentially got a free max roster spot at the end of the previous system. They couldn't have signed durant if the cap didnt go up so much that year.   Every other dynasty worked withing the parameters of the league, but the warriors were like a glitch in the system. The CBA, Cable deals, salary cap and timing created the only superteam"
"so you are a Kevin Durant fan, why haven't you changed your flair to the Nets? how about KD-Siete? KD-Sie7e? KWD-7? KWD7? I'm out of the loop Who is Shane Trey?"
"Come on, bro. Didn't you know? Anyone who didn't play in the ACC is trash.  Kawhi Leonard? Trash  Lebron James? Didn't even play in college. Definite trash.  Kevin Durant? SEC My ass. Trash.  Steph Curry? Wtf is a Davidson? Trash  James Harden? Pac-10? More like Pac-TRASH.  Giannis Antetokounmpo? Last time I checked, the streets of Greece are covered in TRASH.  Anthony Davis? Who was his coach again? Oh Yeah. John Cali-TRASH-i  The 3 best players in the NBA are Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul and Steven Adams, because FUCK YOU ACC IS GOAT"
Is kevin durant a constrictor or venomous?
"I think a big reason for hot and coldness towards him is the difference between his floor and ceiling. It's true, he goes cold sometimes but he's also had some of the greatest games a fan can witness. Just look at his Wikipedia page.  Highest scoring triple-double in NBA playoff history (51 points on 4/20/2017 vs Houston Rockets).  Only player in NBA history to record a 50-point triple-double in an NBA playoff game.  Only player in NBA history to record at least 150 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists through the first five games of a playoff series.  Only player in NBA history to record at least three straight 30-point triple-doubles in a single playoff series.  One of two players in NBA history to record at least 25 points and 15 assists in back-to-back playoff games.[6] Includes Isiah Thomas.  One of two players in NBA history to record three straight 30-point triple-doubles. Includes Wilt Chamberlain.  One of three players in NBA history to record at least 25 points, 15 assists, and 10 rebounds in a playoff game.  Includes Oscar Robertson (achieved this twice) and Chris Paul.  T-1st place all-time for points scored in the fourth quarter of an NBA Finals game. Tied with Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry  His biggest problem is his deviation from his own average ability, which unfortunately can come when he needs to be clutch, especially in playoffs. I forget what playoff game it was a year or two ago where he had like 30 points in the 3rd quarter to get the lead back. Besides how impressive that is on paper, seeing the fuckin fire in his eyes when he was doing it was a performance you only get like maybe once a decade."
Does anyone remember Kevin Durant wearing the black and white hat with the number 7 on it during press conference’s? Or the White Sox hat he would wear? The Brooklyn Nets colors are black and white. He had to be hinting at signing with the Brooklyn Nets
"I'm totally down for that!! He didnt choose to resign with them, he chose us over everyone like you said. He brought in KD and regardless of peoples opinions on KD its freakin Kevin Durant!! Hes one of the top players in the world. It feels good to have haters though, it means were doing something right"
"Paul George had career numbers playing with Russell Westbrook and despite what people believe should've happened in this situation or that situation, Kevin Durant won an MVP with Russell.  I'll let you tell me which other players Russell should've been regularly feeding non-stop in OKC."
&gt; Kevin Durant is 25% likely to return to 100%  0% likely  Whereas it's 90% likely his career will be over by the time he's 35
"&gt;Kevin Durant is 25% likely to return to 100%  Lmao, and how tf did you derive those odds?"
Facts for Nephews:  &gt; Facts for Nephews: Kyrie Irving has had 3 knee surgeries in the past 4 years Kyrie Irving has a broken leadership complex He could only follow Lebron and not lead Boston Kevin Durant is 25% likely to return to 100% Achilles tear is career altering / ending injury By the time Kevin Durant supposedly returns to form (if ever) he will be 33 years old NBA players decline around 33 years old Nets fans have two broken stars  There ya go
"I cant imagine kevin durant with a number thats not 35 on the back of his jersey, sorry."
Kevin Durant more like **Seven** Durant  ***(Im sorry the joke was right there)***
"Casual fans don't misvalue players. Fans know that free throws are incredibly valuable. They just don't always root for players based on how valuable they are, or Kevin Durant would be the top 2 most loved player in the league for 5 or so years now."
y’know who else was an all-star at 22 or under  Kobe Bryant  Michael Jordan   Lebron James  Magic Johnson  Kevin Durant  naming 2 players who didn’t pan out is a horrible point.
Kevin Durant comes down the ramp with a steel chair and smashes it over Russ 💥   Kyrie wins
Because Kevin Durant
"Doesn’t matter. How likely do you think it is that they’ll draft 3 more MVP players? Organizations get lucky if they draft a single MVP caliber player within a decade, let alone 3 former MVP’s, only to lose them all.  OKC can rebuild all that they want, they’ll never match Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden."
"I mean he shouldn’t have outlasted Paul George, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook."
"&gt;And spending it on Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor versus the real process--The Greek Freak--is what separates good GMs from bad ones.  Literally everyone in the entire league missed on him, including the Bucks who would have traded up if they had him anywhere near the top of their board. One of the teams that passed on him even won a ring since then.  &gt;Exhibit A: Warriors (curry, klay,  Basically just have to draft the best shooter of all time 7th overall behind 4 busts, that also gets hurt repeatedly so you can tank for multiple high picks, pass on Paul George for Ekpe Udoh, and still get shots at great players.  Then you have to have an owner who doesn't care about short-term profit and also get Kevin Durant on your squad to round it out.   If you really look at who made the finals or got close, the way to be in a great position to win championships is to:  1. Get lucky with the lottery system to get a megastar that literally everyone wants, and have them stay healthy. Cleveland, OKC, and Spurs did this.  2. Have a combination of great ownership, fanbase, location, and respect in your franchise to get players to want to play for your franchise. Having those players be friends with some other star players helps too.  3. Make smart decisions with money that turn out well.  4. Get really, really lucky with timing on superstar free agents or guys forcing their way out of their contracts to play with your team.  5. Have Lebron"
"I filtered by at least 25 MPG and 50 games played and got this:  1.   Steph Curry 2.   Danny Green 3.   Giannis Antetokounmpo 4.   Brook Lopez 5.   Kevin Durant 6.   Eric Bledsoe 7.   Draymond Green 8.   Malcolm Brogden 9.   Kyle Lowry 10. Pascal Siakam   Whole lot of Bucks from a 60 win team, coupel raptors from a 58 win NBA championship squad and some big warriors from a finals squad....seems fine to me."
"If you bothered to put a minutes restriction on there you would realize your whole point is silly.  If you only include players that played at least 30 games and at least 20 MPG, here's the top 10:  Steph Curry  Danny Green  Giannis  Brook Lopez  Kevin Durant  Eric Bledsoe  Draymond Green  Malcolm Brogdon  Kyle Lowry  Pascal Siakam  Jusuf Nurkic  Khris Middleton  Andre Iguodala  Danuel House Jr  Paul Millsap  These players make sense when you consider the teams benches and who's replacing them when they come off the court."
"I actually did &gt;10 GP and &gt;10 minutes a game.  It was:  1. Raul Neto (UTA) 2. Steph 3. Danny Green 4. Donte DiVincenzo 5. Giannis 6. Brook Lopez 7. Kevin Durant 8. Eric Bledsoe 9. Draymond 10. Brogdon  So basically other than one outlier, all starters for teams that won their conference last year."
"In case you're curious here's the top 10 after you apply a filter:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 2. Kevin Durant 3. Draymond Green 4. Kyle Lowry 5. Pascal Siakam 6. Khris Middleton 7. Chris Paul 8. Paul George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Eric Gordon  There are still some issues in here, but it's about 100x better than one with no filter."
Not a single teammate had said a bad thing about LeBron.  All the narratives and stories are media fabricated or from kevin durant
"And that team just so happened to be the team letting go of Kevin Durant ? Lol Nah. That’s not how that went   GS, losing KD to Brooklyn , brilliantly inquired about a sign and trade so they can have some type of value. And the Nets, Warriors, somebody talked D Lo into it and he got seduced.   Why would he want to be traded somewhere where he’s immediately on the trading block? Lol Only causal fans (and apparently an impressionable mind like Russell) would buy that ‘we’ll teach you to be a winner’ nonsense. I guess he’s taking the accelerated winner class, July to February trade deadline schedule"
"At the olympics you are on average playing against opposition a bit worse than the G-league. There is only efficiency data available from 2012 onwards and melo is shooting a very respectable 65% true shooting, but if you compare this to, for example, lebron james versus the same opposition lebron is shooting 73%.  So his ceiling off-ball is that he can do on offense in the G-league what kevin durant does in the NBA while still being ass on defense."
https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-was-heckled-by-rihanna  I'll allow it.
"That was me... KD was a free agent, and the Nets had the available cap space to sign both he and Kyrie. Because of GSW's salary cap situation, they could only afford to sign MLE's and vet minimums - there was no way they could have gotten D-Lo. By Kevin Durant agreeing to a sign-and-trade, he made it possible for GSW to get D-Lo, hence... helping his old team."
"Damn son, you sound like me. I got the height of Nate Robinson, combined with the build of Kevin Durant, the knees of Zion Williamson and all topped off with a jumpshot like Ben Simmons."
"SC “analysts” have the easiest job in the world.      “Kevin Durant hasn’t passed gas in 36 hours, what this means for the bk nets championship chances, next on sportscenter”"
If Kevin Durant is healthy you absolutely sign him and pair him with whomever he likes. If it’s trading for AD then do it. If it’s signing Kyrie than do it. However he tore his Achilles and everything changed. But i disagree with this notion that it “shouldn’t worked out” only if you’re operating from the premise that he’ll never be the same after that injury and I’d agree with that.
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard (coming off of a championship), Paul George, Anthony Davis, DeAndre Jordan all changed teams to get to LA or NY IN ONE OFFSEASON  This happened one year after Lebron, the game’s biggest star, did the same thing  The problem off talent consolidation in the coastal supermarkets is absolutely rea"
"1. No, cause the supermax has many restrictions that keep it to only the most decorated players in the league. No team is forced to offer it even if a player is eligible and if a team feels like that will be a problem in negotiations they can always trade that player (see: Kings trading Cousins). 2. It's very unlikely that Utah will offer Gobert the supermax. Unlike the normal max, you are not competing with anyone else on the negotiation. If Utah doesn't want to offer Gobert that deal he/his agent cannot say ""ok well we'll go take meetings and this team will pay it.""    They will offer him the max though, and ultimately that isn't going to change their options all that much from a supermax. I feel like people are reading way too into the impact of that 5% difference in reality. For example, if that was the difference between them getting someone or not then they could move Ed Davis' $4.8M (4.19%) and waive Royce O'Neale's non guaranteed $1.6M (1.42%) for 5.61%. Teams will attach picks to move deals that range from $10M to even as high as $20M to clear cap when they need it. You also have the stretch provision as an avenue to create wiggle room. 5% is nothing.  The other thing is that it is *free* agency and ultimately you cannot control what a player decides they want to do. Golden State was able to offer Kevin Durant the supermax and he willingly left, taking an enormous paycut while going to a less talented team. Toronto had Kawhi's Bird's rights and could offer him more than the Clippers coming off a championship and it wasn't enough.  Even with Kawhi taking his 2+1 deal they would only have his partial Bird's rights so they won't even be able to offer him his max unless they have the necessary cap space. For that to be possible they would probably have to dump Beverley's $14.3M and more that summer, and they've already traded a bunch of picks, so that will be interesting. Or maybe Kawhi opts in with a wink wink deal assurance and gets that deal a year later.  At the end of the day you already have players who are willingly turning it down and in general more money to choose their path, and that's not a new thing. It's not likely to be a problem for teams to not offer the supermax if they don't feel it's worth it. If they feel like it might be they can always trade that player for a large haul and reset themselves."
"&gt; Back when Kevin Durant was a rookie, he was called a bust since he couldn't bench press 185lbs, but now he can Bench press OVER 315LBS!! Durant has been lifting weights and getting his weight up as well. Durant currently is 240lbs and constantly workouts. Kevin Durant has even worked out with lebron James. In Case you guys didn't know this video is fake.  From the description haha"
"Free Agency moves are pre-planned a year (or years) in advance.  That’s why you get “insiders” like Jarret Jack saying LeBron, AD, and KD are potentially teaming up https://mobile.twitter.com/jarrettjack03/status/1063193758601277443?lang=en  Then a quote from KD comes out that he doesn’t want any part of LeBron’s toxic media situation https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-lebron-james-has-a-good-reason-why-he-wont-respond-to-kevin-durants-criticism/  So then LeBron comes out saying he’s pissed at KD but then KD apologized to him https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/lebron-james-kevin-durant-toxic-comments-lakers-warriors-espn-interview  Which leads to KD teaming up with Kyrie instead  And Lakers lose out on a 3rd Max guy"
Name 15 players who are DEFINITIVELY better than Kevin Durant who have ever touched a basketball
Y’all just pull figures out of your butts.   There’s no team giving Kevin Durant 100 fucking million dollars a year.   Furthermore Chris Paul would not be making way more. You can barely trade his contract right now because teams don’t want to pay him that much. He’s not worth more right now. lebron is definitely worth way more.
"Kevin Durant gets paid less because he negotiated a contract to get paid less, which is a cardinal sin of a union job. Kevin Durant should never be able to take less than he's worth. That's union busting behavior."
"Agreed. I said it a few days ago....Oklahomans are loyal to a fault. We support anyone who played in the state, came to the state, or said something nice about the state so long as they left on good terms.   HOWEVER, if you leave on shitty terms....it's a fan base you'll never recover 100%. If they trash what was once loyal to them...you're pretty much garbage to them.   Kevin Durant came to OKC and when he was asked about being a UT student in Oklahoma he said ""I bleed burnt orange"" and the fans said ""Fuck it, at least he's honest, and we can live with that!"" As soon as he left, he was about as low on the totem poll as you can go. If he ever came back, it would never be the same. But if Russ came back, we would greet him with open arms."
"Lesser known fact, he got hurt and the Brazilian Kevin Durant took over."
Kevin Durant 4 years 160 million
"Pg: Russell westbrook Sg: James harden  Sf: Carmelo  Pf; Paul George  C: Kevin Durant   The thunder would have the ultimate small ball lineup, imo this team is straight unguardable, and it would work because they all were in their primes at one point with each other."
"You're saying drafting a top 10 player in the league (with top 3-5 potential), and a 22 year old all star is not hitting in the draft? So I guess in your opinion if you don't draft Lebron or Kevin Durant then it's a trash pick."
See Tobias Harris getting paid more than Kevin Durant. The top players are sacrificing their true worth and salaries for the mid-level guys and role players to get paid.
"No, but the max guys that exist would be paid exorbitantly more than they are now, thus leaving less for everyone else. In the current system it's the top players that are underpaid while the mid-level guys are overpaid. That's how you end up with Otto Porter and Tobias Harris making more money than Kevin Durant. Mid-level/role players should be grateful to the top players."
"Was never good enough to defend above his position as Paul has (we've seen him switch onto Kevin Durant in the clutch of a playoff game) and could be taken advantage of by physical guards, like Terry Porter in '92 who pretty much got whatever he wanted against the Jazz.  Stockton did roam in his career. He frequently made calculated gambles of digging towards post up players and jumping into passing lanes, which if successful were mitigated by a sound team rotation. Steals were more common in earlier eras than now, so it's not supported that a player would have a higher steal rate if they played now."
"Right, and guys like Lebron and CP3 haven't fought to remove the salary cap--that would benefit only the top guys. Guys like Lebron and CP3 are taking less than they're worth so that the other players can get more. Without a salary cap Kevin Durant would be paid 100 million per year and all of his teammates would be making 1 million."
"Let’s do a quick list of people who deserve top 5 more than curry - in no particular order; MJ, Wilt, Kareem, Lebron, Bird, Magic, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Kobe, Russel, I mean Kevin Durant has a better argument than Steph."
"Lol yup, I remember the headlines were hilarious.  ESPN: GEORGE W. BUSH CAN BENCH PRESS MORE THAN KEVIN DURANT!"
"I got MJ, Lebron, Kareem, Duncan, Bird, Magic, Shaq, Hakeem, Russell, Thomas, Chamberlain, Hakeem, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Isiah Thomas, Pippen and Dwayne Wade all over him just off the top of my head. They all have Finals MVPs which is a huge question mark on Steph's legacy. KD helped him win 2 while he won one against an injured Cavs team in 2015. I can see the argument for Steph being Top 20 but I don't see him as a Top 15 player just yet."
"Ah yes, the dynamic pairing of Kevin Durant and Kylie Jenner is real exciting."
"Can someone explain [this](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/254844/Kevin-Durant-Signs-Three-Plus-One-$164M-Deal-With-Nets) to me? He signed with the Warriors to be traded to NJ, so how did he sign a contract with NJ then?"
Not the first guy to dominate LeBron.  Just off the top of my head:  - Tim Duncan  - Kawhi Leonard  - JJ Barea  - Jason Terry  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry
at one point in his career he had james harden and kevin durant ????????? literally 2 mvp tier players and can't win? name me anyone that had that much talent and not get 1 ring.   KD left for a reason lol he knew russ sucks
"2009 - 2012 Twitter was legendary.         ""Scarlett Johansson I WILL DRINK UR BATHWATER"" - *1x MVP, 2x FMVP, 10x All-Star Kevin Durant*"
"Haha, funny haha Kevin Durant joke we didn’t get the good basket man"
"Not necessarily true.  Paul is a better switch defender than Stockton, who would not be able to defend the likes of Kevin Durant with any degree of success.   &gt;Chris Paul on the floor doesn't give you much, if anything better aside from two stellar years.  Except he's a far better scorer than Stockton in the postseason."
kevin durant has always been better than kawhi leonard
My top 10:  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Kawhi Leonard  4. James Harden  5. Steph Curry  6. Giannis   7. AD  8. Joel Embiid   9. Damian Lillard  10. Nikola Jokic
Kevin Durant looks like Morgan Freeman lol
Maybe because CP3 never played with someone like Malone. Imagine if he had played with someone like Kevin Durant his entire career or Dirk Nowitzki.  Stockton was never as dominant as Paul. He never reached the levels Paul did in 2008 and 2009 when he was MVP-level.
"Um, I just told you why Harden was better, he was playing 28-30 minutes in OKC and in Houston he was playing 38, shooting almost 10 shots more per game...   And you really want to include Reggie Jackson in the conversation? Because that only demonatrate you are stupid. He’a average was 15 minutes per game🙄 started playing good basketball when Westbrook was injured and he was out for months...   Paul George had career year this season... what the fuck are you talking about?! Finished top-3 in MVP conversation? Bro, do you really watch basketball in your life? And the best season of Kevin Durant was in OKC, because he won his MVP in OKC! And you know what they have in common? They both play with Westbrook in their career year! And I didn’t include Jerami Grant that had his best season WITH Westbrook.   Bro, get outta here, you don’t know anything about basketball and I’m losing my time."
No - the right thing is to pass the ball to wide open Kevin Durant before you get to half court.
"Kevin Durant left teams as a free agent, Paul George demanded trades.  I think players should be allowed to jump ship during free agency, so I say Paul George."
Completely wrong - KD is behind once Draymond steals the ball. He can’t beat him up the floor with meaningful spacing.   He’s trailing providing an outlet for a pull-up 3 and he’s open for a ~30-35% shot. There’s not many players you want taking that but he’s Kevin Fucking Durant.  And it’s better than no shot.
"[BrooklynNetsPC] Jay Z says Kevin Durant is “completely unhealthy” and has been “rehabbing all summer.” Hova believes Kyrie will be the starter, that he’ll be a “huge brain” and will make the Nets a team the likes of ""the flat Earth has never seen"""

Draymond green running the ball with 3 seconds left ORRR Kevin Durant running the ball with 3 seconds left.   Which is the correct play?  Ignoring the fact draymond even takes the rebound from kd lmao he made his mind up already.
I mean it happens. Kevin Durant has the reverse of that going on.
Kevin Durant made the most uncompetitive move I’ve ever seen
Kyle Lowry (14.2)  Landry Shamet (9.1)  Kevin Durant (26.0)  Draymond Green (7.4)  Myles Turner (13.3)  Exactly 70 ppg
Kevin Durant is not a top 5 player in the NBA. He has never done anything without a fellow superstar playing next to him.
"Yeah thats not what I said. Did Westbrook have a statistically better season? I guess its arguable yeah. Advanced stats were pretty similar across the board, slightly better VORP and WS etc for Westbrook. Durant was obviously miles better from an efficiency standpoint but Westbrook was a better facilitator (though to be fair he had the added advantage of passing to Durant lol).  &amp;#x200B;  But I said Durant was the *best player* on their team. And I don't think thats remotely arguable. When Westbrook won his MVP, he had the best statistical season. But he wasn't a *better player* than Kevin Durant that year, or a *better player* than Lebron James either. But he finished above them in MVP voting.  &amp;#x200B;  Even with all of that aside, even if I agreed that he was a better player than Durant that year. 2015/16 just wasn't as good of a year for Westbrook as 2016/17."
Probably Kevin Durant because he won’t be playing so his shoes can’t smell that bad
"I mean, yes they had more wins. But they also had Kevin Durant as the clear best player on the team. Westbrook was very, very good that year obviously. But I can't really see any argument for it being his best season as a player, because he was just better at basically every part of basketball the next season."
You mean Kevin Durant did.
"I would love to go to dinner with Lebron. I would ask him:  - 1) Does it bother you that Kevin Durant went to Golden State...like I know u couldn’t say anything publicly, but if Kyrie didn’t get injured in 2015 and Kevin Durant didn’t go to Golden State, then you would have 7 championships! 7 CHAMPIONSHIPS!! - 2) That fine ass lady that you were pictured with in biceps, did you tap that?? Was she freaky?? - 3) Tell me the truth about Delonte West is that really why you quit on the Cavs during the playoffs and went to Miami?  - 4) In that GIF of you and Kevin Durant, why did he give you such a nasty look did you really fart?"
"Kevin Durant is the best player to have been on the Thunder, not the best THUNDER player"
Kevin Durant die?
"The NBA had it out for Canada and prevented the Raptors and Grizzlies from early success. This is my own personal theory. It's based on some pretty circumstantial evidence but that already makes it more valid than Pizzagate IMO.  1) The NBA made it a rule that neither the Raptors or Grizzlies were allowed to win the first overall pick for the first 3 for the first three years of their existence. The Raptors won the 1996 draft lottery and were pushed down to the 2nd overall slot and picked Marcus Camby instead of Allen Iverson because of it.   2) The NBA implemented their current eligibility rules in the 2006 NBA draft. Prior to that draft, high school graduates could declare for the NBA draft. Amir Johnson the 2005 NBA draft was the last player to ever be drafted straight out of high school. So the Raptors win the lottery in the 2006 and instead of picking between Greg Oden and Kevin Durant who had just graduated, picked Andrea Bargnani."
"Dude, Westbrook ignored a wide open Kevin freaking Durant to dribble himself into a double team for a shot clock violation or turnover are you're trying to sell the Rockets as being the answer for fixing that?  Dude."
"People shit on Michael Jordan, Lebron James, and Kevin Durant.  What exactly makes you think they won't shit on Chris Paul?"
"&gt;3 years in a row  Lol so why are you talking shit then?  &gt;we lost a perineal talent Kevin Durant  Rule of life: keep the talent happy. Y'all didn't. We did. And look what happened. We built the GOAT dynasty. You crumbled after 3 first round exits.   &gt;it will actually be considered real unlike your last two.  Rings are rings, big guy."
I mean if Pippen wasn't a superstar... neither is Kevin Durant.
"Imagine if russell westbrook, kevin durant, and james hardin could all get along and stay on the same team"
"We’re talking about CP3 here, not Kevin Durant."
Team #1:  Brook Lopez - 12.5 Draymond Green - 7.4 Kevin Durant - 26 Landry Shamet - 9.1 Kyle Lowry - 14.2   Team #2:   Nikola Jokic - 20.1 Draymond Green - 7.4 Kevin Durant - 26 Andre Iguodala - 5.7 Landry Shamet - 9.1    I prefer team #1. Obviously this is assuming everyone is healthy.
Yeah it’s not like he had chances with Kevin Durant and Paul George before.. if he’s not good in Houston he will still have excuses made for him
"Magic is reaching with that. The finals was 7 years ago. Was he forcing shots? Absolutely, but I think it was in a desperate attempt to try to be seen as good as Kevin Durant was instead of being seen as a side kick. Now at 30, he has been the main guy on team and asked to do everything and it hasn’t found him any successful when it comes time for the playoffs. I think now from everything I’ve read about him, he wants to win and with Harden he can do that. He’d have to adjust his game and I don’t see why he’d be unwilling to do so. He already has his MVP, his legacy is cemented in OKC and in the history books. It’s all about winning a chip now."
Didn't stop him from doing the same shit when Kevin Durant was his teammate.  Dude will keep. fucking. shooting.  The dude views himself like Kobe.
"PG: Lebron    SG: Kevin Durant    SF: Bird    PF: Rodman    C: Duncan     Bench:    PG: Magic      SG: T-Mac     SF: Scottie    PF: Dirk    C: Russell     Duncan and Rodman=not getting exposed on pick and roll, because these guys can switch.     Lebron at point is basically easy buckets in transition and 1 in 1.      KD and Bird are 2 of the greatest shot creators of all time, while being versatile wings in their own right. KD would be the no. 1 option for scoring, Bird can do everything at an elite level, Lebron's gravity at point is cancer, Rodman and Duncan can guard old school and new age bigs.      Magic off the bench provides everything. It was a toss up between Kobe and T-Mac, but I picked T-Mac so it gets interesting. I wanted to put Dr. J in my lineup cause he would benefit from a modern NBA style, but I put in Scottie in case I need one guy to disappear. Dirk provides floor spacing and shot creation of the bench, Russell also has the athleticism and IQ to avoid getting exploited in pick and roll while being able to provide on both ends.        Our smallest player is our starting PF, who doesn't play like he is."
"3 years in a row and no shit, we had a bad situation after we lost a perineal talent Kevin Durant. Still was one of the funnest teams to watch. At least if we do win a chip one day it will actually be considered real unlike your last two."
"A certain team had Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, and a deep bench and lost."
"The only reason Stockton wasn't an MVP caliber player is because he played next to Karl Malone.  If Kevin Durant had been on the Warriors all of Steph's tenure, Steph would have 0 MVPs too."
\*Kevin Durant\*....lets not play stupid
"I remember it being a pretty half-assed nod, and going back and re-reading it, I don’t think that’s off. Only real mention of the fans is stuffed in the bottom of a five paragraph article that’s mostly about Kevin Durant, that be happened to post exclusively on a website he part-owns."
"Brandon Ingram   After mid January or so last year he was looking like Kevin Durant on offense for a few games at a time.   I think this is the year he should take a big leap. He’s got a great group around him in New Orleans, and he should be one the main offensive options."
"A certain team had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook but couldn't pull it off."
" &gt;“I feel like Lebron is just on a whole other level.”   she knows what's up  &gt;   &gt;“Stephen A. Smith just preaches bad opinions”   She's a keeper  &gt;   &gt;“Kawhi really does seem like a fun guy, Kevin Durant does not.”    Yeh, you should definitely marry her once again"
"Kevin ""Sad Guy"" Durant?"
So are you saying they somehow got worse with the addition of Kevin Durant?
"How are they the best team of all time if they hadn’t even added Kevin Durant yet? Are you somehow implying the Warriors got worse with KD? If that’s the case, why didn’t Lebron beat them then?  Also, you keep moving these arbitrary goalposts. Using your own logic, Lebron is not a legend because he choked in the 2011 finals."
"I wish I could @all-people-mentioning the Heat...  We have two max contract slots for offseason 2021. We will be the top free agent destination that year for whatever superstars want to pair up with Butler in South Beach. That's an absolutely magical opportunity.  We'll have about $50m in contracts (one of which is a $14m team option for Winslow) with a cap of maybe $125m. We can even pull off a sign-and-trade with Adebayo if we have a Kevin Durant / DLo type situation.  Taking Chris Paul destroys that. In 2021 with Chris Paul we will have like 30m total cap space. We'll have grandpa CP3, Butler, Winslow, Adebayo, somebody else as our starting five and won't make the playoffs.   The situation would have been the same with Westbrook. 33 year old Butler + 33 year old Westbrook is not a championship duo. Neither is 58 year old CP3 and 33 year old Butler.  The reason we were considering Westbrook was he might be good enough to put us in contention for ECF this season and next. Sixers/Bucks are the clear top two but Butler/Westbrook probably makes us third. One upset and we make the finals. That might be worth giving up 2022 and 2023.  But that's not happening with CP3. We are not a ECF contender with CP3 the way we would have been with WB.   Hence, this isn't happening."
"sorry but my dad works at nba 2k offices and i just played the demo for nba 2k22 which had kevin durant on the cover and the game says he averaged 31 ppg so i know  there's also a minigame where you can actually play as KD but instead of ballin you just mash buttons on the control to type a tweet, and each tweet you type costs 99 cents to tweet, but you gotta make sure to use L and R to swap accounts"

"True for normal people like you and me.  Not true for multimillionaires who aren't *only* looking for the best possible return, but also for actually being involved in some of these companies and building their brand.  eg: Kevin Durant is involved in Propel, a Brooklyn company that makes apps for people to use EBT more easily.  It's not just about the total returns for him, it's about making the right investments that fit with what he wants to do with his life."
"I mean, [this](https://kfor.com/2016/08/25/petition-aims-to-change-the-name-of-durant-oklahoma-to-westbrook/) happened. I'd day Kevin Durant is, at best, wildly unpopular in Oklahoma"
But it pairs Kevin Durant and Jim Belushi. Was this not a recipe for success?
Kevin Durant is one of the mentally toughest players in the game. SMH the disrespect.
"Kevin Durant gently cut off the 11yo twitter user he was flaming and reminded him: ""I know how to play --oh wait, that's my account"""
"Yo was that you buying that jersey? I was the guy buying the Kawhi Leonard Lakers jersey! I was in the Lakers section the whole time looking at their Lamarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant and Chris Paul jerseys"
Damn bron retired can’t wait to see my 3 favorite players on the thunder James harden Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook dominate the league
When the ~~Kevin Durant~~ ~~Kawhi~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ ~~Russell Westbrook~~ Chris Paul situation resolves itself.
Honestly tho who would have guessed steph would stay healthy enough to become a 2 time MVP forming the best back-court duo with klay Thompson. Turning the warriors into prime FA destinations bringing on Kevin durant as OKC started its collapse.
"&gt; Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka will make up the core of the Thunder for perhaps the next decade. The Thunder will be perennial championship contenders for years to come."
And the Kevin Durant and klay Thompson were injured..... lol
"&gt; Yea i just feel bad for the fans  The time to feel bad for us was when KD left us for the team that he choked against. Fuck him forever for that. We could have had a dynasty type era, because we were the best youngest team in the NBA, and we even signed [Victor O because we wanted to please KD.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/06/28/kevin-durant-free-agent-thunder-victor-oladipo/86477380/) Then he left us 7 days later.   We did put the best team forward for years, but it never worked out. Eventually you have to start over. No dynasty is forever, and now was the best time to do it. Watching WB grow older without competing for a ship would have been depleting for how hard he works. I'm glad he's with basketball Hitler."
"thats not how the world works buddy.  you don't get to make accusations and put the burden of proof on the accused.  by your logic I could claim that Kevin Durant is a serial killer and it is just as likely to be true as false since you can't prove that its not true.  sorry buddy, try again."
"It’s not debatable whatsoever. Kevin Durant is not a top defender at his position. He is not elite on that end of the floor.  &gt; If we’re talking about war he is right now, he’s great at everything and is a good defender. I can live with that.  That’s cool, and that’s the argument you should stick with. In some situations you’ll need KD’s scoring more than Kawhi’s defence and vice versa. I understand that preference. But saying KD is an elite defender just isn’t true."
#OOOHH KEVIN DURANT FROM DOWNTOWN
Never forget: Kevin Durant joined a 73 wins team that was 4 points away of being b2b champions.
Raptors fans jubilantly cheering when kevin durant hurt his Achilles
Lmao Kevin Durant and klay Thompson got injured. Shut up
"KG was leading top 10-3 offense with Wally as his 2nd best player. Very few bigs can carry a offense like KG over a regular season in history. Not even Duncan because he was no where the passer KG was and they pretty much had KG as the point forward. KG lead the greatest DEFENSE of the last 25 years at 31+ 2x  lol. Imagine giving younger hyper athletic KG better offensive weapons so he could focus more on defense.   KG was pretty much a floor raiser on Lebron level. I don't think he is top 10 like some advanced stats lover but don't be crazy now. Hell, Durant is better than Moses and KG is better than Durant.  http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/19/backpicks-goat-8-kevin-garnett/"
"He’s saying that it’s kind of lame that a major side-effect of the current Free Agency system is that every year the players who are not one of the **very select few** of big names entering Free Agency are always in some way directly affected by those few superstar’s decisions.     It’s not intentional obviously, though maybe some instances have been, but if you were a FA this year and you aren’t a superstar like Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant, then it’s hella difficult to have much of an influence on where you’d like to play and it’s more about *having to wait for those superstars to pick a landing spot as the rest of the league’s GMs have different plans for each team depending on how things play out for guys like Kahwi &amp; KD etc.* Through no fault of their own, any and every player who isn’t one of the most wanted players on the market are forced to twiddle their thumbs because many franchises don’t want to make certain deals until they know for certain what their remaining options are, and what their biggest competitor’s own options are and so on. It’s a ripple effect."
"I’ve yet to see a good argument for how it’s bad.  You know what all this trade and free agency drama brought?  The new official era of the NBA Power Couple.  The Lakers, Clippers, Rockets, Blazers, Nuggets and Jazz all have a legitimate shot at the 1-seed in the West this year, and the Warriors still exist too.  There are seven teams in this conference that you could argue have a shot at the Finals right now.  The East might realistically be a two-team race between Milwaukee and Philadelphia, but seven of the nine teams I’ve just named could win and give us the eighth unique champion the NBA’s seen in the last ten years.  And then next year the Nets get Kyrie and KD together.  This might be the most wide open season the league has seen in like 50 years.  For competitive balance, this offseason was pretty much a godsend.  Plus, even the teams that aren’t Finals contenders are in a decent spot.  You mean to tell me the Thunder, Pelicans, and Grizzlies aren’t in an excellent spot to build up their teams over the next four years?  There’s maybe one team that looks like it’s stuck in hell, and it’s Charlotte.  Phoenix still at least has Devin Booker to score 50 points in their 125-108 losses this year.  And we haven’t even talked about financials yet.  The NBA now gets to sell new jerseys for Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Kemba Walker, Jimmy Butler and “best rookie shoe deal ever” Zion Williamson. You think Nike and the NBA aren’t rock hard thinking about this year’s jersey sales?  You think no one’s noticed that the NBA just dominated the month of July?  You think ESPN isn’t going to run “Battle for LA” shit for a solid year?    So I mean yeah, I guess it does suck for New Orleans that they couldn’t keep Anthony Davis, but I guess that’s a cautionary tale about not running your basketball team in your off-time from running your football team?  You’ll note that the second Gayle Benson started treating that team like it mattered instead of Tom treating it like something to do when there was no football on, the Pelicans hired smart executives and made good moves.  They actually have their own medical staff now instead of just using an NFL staff, so maybe treatment of injuries will consist of more than “take some Toradol and get out there, pussy.”    And sure, it sucks for OKC that Paul George forced his way out, but you’ll excuse my lack of sympathy for a hard-bitten small-market team that only exists cause the NBA snaked Seattle and was stuck in first-round exit hell because when they had three (3!) future NBA MVPs on their team, they blew it up to save a fucking oil magnate a couple mil."
I like Kevin Durant.
Yeah fuck Kevin Durant he ruined the league for 3 years
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant
Yes and no. I don’t remember mj playing much but can safely admit him being the best ever.   Conversely i think future generations can safely admit kevin durant made the biggest bitch move in sports history and will always attach a “yea but” to his name.
"Klay's not a superstar, he's an all star but he isn't at the same level as guys like James Harden, Anthony Davis, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic. He's an all star like Jimmy Butler and the like."
This is why Kevin Durant went to Golden State. Championships live forever.
"You can see this with Kevin Durant and his interview where he said ""I'm Kevin Durant"" and then proceeded to kill the clippers. That's one of the coldest things I've heard/ seen and I'd put it just under Kobe's no flinch"
"&gt;You know what was bad for the league? Kevin freakin Durant signing to the Warriors.    Not just him ""joining"".. The 73 win team, who was just 1 Finals series away from being known as the greatest team and greatest regular season in the history of the game, eclipsing that 95 Bulls.. got fucked by LeBron instead and just had the much-needed reality check. They were being way too arrogant and nonchalant, especially after they went up 3-1  &gt;  Then, the 2 time regular season MVP, the DPOY, the best 3 and D player + Top 3 greatest shooter ever, with that 73 win team, cried to Durant of all people, from the parking lot. Formed the superteam of all superteams, just to beat LeBron. They didn't need Durant or anyone else for any other reason. They were already a 73 goddamn win team, with 3 superstars.   &gt;  And the rest is history.. They did that to beat LeBron, but the entire league suffered as well. Parity was at an all time low, lookin like NBA 2k or some shit instead.   &gt;   Now Steve Kerr of all people, after winning multiple free rings while doing pretty much nothing, talking about AD wanting a trade ""ruins the league"" lol they are just scared as fuck, especially since they lost Durant as well.. and multiple other teams just got stronger than ever.. especially the Lakers  &gt;  I actually can't even blame the 73 win team, Kerr, or any of their players for the whole Durant situation. Durant deserves most of the blame. How do you go to war against a team, for so many years, then finally you have them down 1-3, in the 2016 WCF.. and then completely choke and lose the entire series eventually?  Then you leave that team and Westbrook of all people, hanging.. and instantly switch up and join that same GSW team that ya choked and lost to.. How is that even possible for someone like his calibre.. to pull that shit? Imagine what Westbrook felt.. He went to war too, and then he saw his best partner just switch up on him and join them instead, just like that.  &gt;  What's worse is, countless nephews and other people had the nerves and lack of awareness, to call KD the best player in the world, after he finally won a series against LeBron, and his 2 chips.. after joining that GSW team.. lol Really? It's insane how fast and easily people forget.. Gold fish memory at its best"
At least Kevin Durant was a free agent and did not force a trade their while he was under contract. He fulfilled both of his contracts with OKC.
"because terry rozier got 3 yr 58 million, rubio got 51/3, and the knicks would rather pay julius randle and bobby portis than kevin durant"
"LMAO  Meanwhile Kevin Durant signs with a 73-9 team and makes watching the regular season for 2 entire years trivial.  Not surprised though, Kerr's father was killed by a radical islamist and he refuses to place blame on the brutality of the islamic religion."
You know what was bad for the league? Kevin freakin Durant signing to the Warriors.
No he’s Kevin Durant
"""Leonard's dominant playoff run led the Toronto Raptors to their first NBA title. And while he got the most votes in our survey, there was plenty of hemming and hawing.

Others also gave strong consideration to LeBron James, although ultimately no one selected him.""   ""In the West, Leonard's new squad was the runaway favorite, although several of those polled, while choosing the Clippers, indicated that this will be very difficult field of competitors.

"As a kid from the 90s living in Germany, I used to watch Shaq and Hakeem early morning. Never was the biggest fan of MJ, because he was too overpowered. Then I did a long break and started to watch again during the Playoffs 2016 as a LeBron and Cavs fan. To make it fair, I will grant every position two slots, so my list is gonna be a bit special:  PG: John Stockton, Stephen Curry   SG: Michael Jordan, Klay Thompson SF: LeBron James, Kevin Durant   PF: Shawn Kemp, Anthony Davis   C: Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O'Neal    There were so many legendary players, it is just insane in what amazing time we live. With all the trades this summer, the next couple of seasons will be dope. Let's simply enjoy this sport!"
In order:  1. LeBron James 2. Kobe Bryant (tie) 2. Shaquille O’ Neal (tie) 4. Tim Duncan 5. Kevin Durant 6. Dwyane Wade  7. Dirk Nowitzki (tie) 7. Stephen Curry (tie) 9. Kawhi Leonard   10. Kevin Garnett (tie) 10. Giannis Antetokounmpo (tie)*  *Yeah I know that’s 11 but w/e js stfu bout it lol
the only reason why you could say 3rd guy looks like kevin durant is that he's tall and lanky. I'm not seeing literally anything else.
"Offense - Steph Curry, James Harden, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Defense - Gary Payton, Scottie Pippen, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Garnett, Ben Wallace"
Is that the very weak Warriors team that won six straight playoff games against the Rockets and Blazers? The very weak team that people thought might have been a better team without Kevin Durant? Is that the one we are talking about?
"The Warriors had Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson AND Draymond Green"
Kevin Durant is top 10 all time...
"Some clarifications: 1) The list is ONLY applies to the upcoming season; it is not meant to be forward-looking. 2) The colors represent tiers, meaning players in the same tier can likely be ordered in a different way but are all superior to players in lower tiers. 3) I excluded Kevin Durant, John Wall, and Jusuf Nurkic because they're either expected to miss the season or have injuries that have particularly unpredictable timetables. 4) I DID include Klay Thompson and Victor Oladipo despite their injuries because they will both likely still play a sizable portion of the season and playoffs. I have treated them independently of their injuries for the sake of the list and simplicity. 5) I paid no consideration towards load management. I realize that players like Joel Embiid and Kristaps Porzingis will probably sit a lot during the regular season but chose not to penalize their ranking for this."
Everytime this argument is made team USA is never threatened. ever. I'll never forget whatever his name is on ESPN predicting a turkey Lithuania final when team USA sent Kevin Durant and Steph Curry to fiba in Istanbul
Because people want to believe that the kevin durant they know will be the same.
Because he’s Kevin Durant
"Sure but never to this extent. Do you remember the 2010 FIBA team USA roster? Wasn't the A-list stars but a bunch of the up-and-coming guys like Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Eric Gordon, Derrick Rose, and Russel Westbrook were on that team and they were a blast to watch."

"Russell Westbrook, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Hakeem."
"Kevin Durant has been the best player in the NBA since 2015 (other than 2016) if he hadn't broken his foot, we'd be in the KD era.   Kobe is top five all time.   prime CP3 and prime Curry is a wash. Steph has won more though."

His 2007-08 regular season is probably the most 'clutch' season any NBA player has ever had.   Between 2006-2009 Brandon roy shot 16/38 (.421) on FGAs in the final 24 seconds of 1 possession games.

"Definitely not Jordan since in those finals his shooting splits weren't anything crazy (still very good aside from the free throw shooting, but not greatest peak). Shaq definitely gets the edge here between these two, but you can make a case that the greatest peak goes to either Lebron in the 2015 or 2016 finals, or Kevin Durant in the 2017 finals. While that Warriors team was stacked, in 2017 KD put up 35/8/5 on shooting splits of 56/47/93.....against Lebron James"

Kevin Durant is good at basketball.
Kg was my favorite player before Kevin Durant.
"Though that act alone didn’t eliminate the Lakers — Leonard still met and communicated with them before his decision — Johnson’s leakage certainly didn’t help his former employer’s pitch.  On a fundamental level, the idea of forming a Big Three with James and Davis didn’t appeal to Leonard’s core sensibilities. He forged his legacy taking down super teams — like the 2014 Miami Heat and the 2019 Golden State Warriors — rather than joining them.  “Elite players like Kawhi earn their stripes, and he was not going to be a guy who joins a so-called ‘super team,’” one source close to the situation told Charania. “Now, if a super team forms around him, there is nothing he can control. The Clippers were the best long-term fit.”  As the NBA rumor mill rampantly churned, with multiple league insiders and media personalities placing the Clippers a distant third in the Leonard sweepstakes, the Clippers never felt compelled to respond or alter the public narrative.  Instead, they doubled down on their silence, ghosting the media and going off the grid. They were fine sitting back and obeying Leonard’s wishes, letting the media speculate and provide information from his meetings with the Lakers and the Raptors.  Honoring Leonard’s request was the easy part. Finding him a co-star proved more complex.  On that day that forever changed a once-laughable franchise, the front office was in a familiar, and temporary, station that had been its work home since May 1: Rented corporate space in El Segundo, about a quarter-mile from the Lakers’ headquarters, because, well, upgrades and renovations at the Playa Vista practice facility were causing a bit of dust.  This was the place where they executed their offseason playbook, where long days and short nights became the norm for this front office that might be the deepest and most talented in the league.  In the days leading up to Leonard’s decision, their core group — Frank, general manager Michael Winger, assistant general managers Mark Hughes and Trent Redden, and executive director of research and identity Lee Jenkins — had barely slept.  That included a 48-hour period in which the front office strategized seemingly every avenue possible to improve its roster around Leonard. On the final few nights before his announcement, the group would call it quits in the office around 2 a.m., then be back before 7 a.m.  But considering all that was at stake, the wheels would keep turning when the group headed home. Good luck reaching an REM state with this kind of opportunity in the balance.  As the Clippers surveyed the NBA scene, it wasn’t yet clear whom they could pair with the 2019 Finals MVP. They analyzed and studied every roster and star player in the league, attempting to find out who would best fit alongside Leonard, both on the hardwood and from a personality standpoint.  The Clippers inquired about Washington’s Bradley Beal and Houston’s James Harden, according to league sources, but neither star was available.  As *The Athletic* [previously reported](https://theathletic.com/1049513/2019/06/27/nba-free-agency-mysteries-from-kawhi-to-kd-on-down-clues-emerge/), Leonard had an interest in joining forces with Jimmy Butler on the Clippers and, according to ESPN, also reached out to Kevin Durant about teaming up in Los Angeles.  Enter Paul George.  Around the time of the draft, Russell Westbrook and George both communicated their discontent to the Thunder and expressed interest in the franchise possibly making significant changes, league sources told *The Athletic*. There had been frustration yet again at season’s end, with the Westbrook-George pairing falling short in the first round of the playoffs for a second time. It would only be natural that all options were considered.  The Thunder worked on quelling their duo’s concerns over the subsequent days and thought matters had been resolved — if only temporarily — by the start of free agency on June 30.  Oklahoma City moved forward with Westbrook and George as the foundation of its roster, and its free-agency pursuits — the agreement/non-agreement of Alec Burks and the addition of Mike Muscala — appeared to be evidence that it was adding to a playoff-level core. (After the Thunder sent George to the Clippers, they granted Burks’ wishes and [let him sign with Golden State](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/12/alec-burks-details-how-paul-george-trade-led-to-warriors-signing/).)  But on July 3, the Clippers received word that George wanted out of Oklahoma City and Leonard had been recruiting George to ask for a trade to team up with him and the Clippers. There are conflicting accounts on Leonard’s involvement in recruiting George. For the record, it should be stated that a source told Charania that it is “not accurate” that Leonard recruited George to demand a trade and come to the Clippers.  George sensed this was a special opportunity to head back home to Southern California, collaborate with one of the game’s best players in Leonard, contend for championships and join a like-minded organization in the Clippers. His endorsement was crucial — and, after talking with Leonard, he was on board."

"&gt; Now, I would say this to you. I would never put him in the category of a great shooter, even when he played in college. First of all, great shooters do not shoot 65 percent at the foul line. If you’re going a whole season and shooting 65 percent from the foul line, you can’t be in the category of a great shooter. The only real test for a shooter is foul shooting and three-point shooting. You can’t go by percentages. If you think back when Shaq played, he was probably shooting like 60 percent from the field and 40 percent from the foul line, (Ed.: 58 and 52) because he was shooting in-close and dunks. J.J. Redick shoots like 94 percent from the foul line, Kevin Durant, close to 90, Curry is like 93, so to think that this kid is gonna be a Steph Curry or a J.J. Redick, certainly not at this time, even if his shoulder isn’t bothering him. There’s no reason to think that he couldn’t improve, but a great shooter does not shoot 65 percent from the foul line.  https://deadspin.com/an-interview-with-a-shooting-expert-about-markelle-fult-1822997954  Shooting coach who reviewed Fultz's tape from college.

Everyone admits Kevin Durant is an out of this world basketball player. People don't respect the fact that he went to a pre-existing championship level team that beat him in the playoffs.
Uhh. Kevin durant would like a word.
"&gt; Who's even a superstar in this league? Kawhi, Curry, AD, LeBron, Harden, and KD? He's not better than any of those if he's at 75%   It's Kevin Durant. Even at 75-80%, with enough load management, he'd better than both Curry and Harden.. in the playoffs. Playoffs is what matters, nothing else.. not for him atleast, not anymore.   &gt;  Y'all fools here really got some gold fish memory. Kevin Durant is the only thing that was close to LeBron, in this generation. It's not a 2 years or  5 years sample either. More like an entire decade. LeBron and Durant, just dominating. They are aliens among humans.   &gt;  Overrating someone and instantly underrating someone just happens over night on r/nba lol  No wonder people don't take this sub seriously. It's a meme sub now, nothing else."
"You literally just typed a bunch of words and failed to do any research, and you sound like a moron. First of all I never in my post anywhere said the Knicks should have signed KD. I pointed out that a team was willing to give KD max contract even though he is 30, has an achilles tear and is out another year. Meaning KP should have been capable of fetching full value even though he was injured. He in fact was at the end of his recovery time table when he got traded.          [Kevin Durant](http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kevin-durant) joining the Brooklyn Nets alongside [Kyrie Irving](http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kyrie-irving) as unrestricted free agents this summer was the worst-kept secret among fellow NBA players, according to [Bobby Portis](http://www.slamonline.com/tag/bobby-portis).  “I knew what was gonna happen in February,” says Portis.          [https://www.slamonline.com/nba/bobby-portis-players-knew-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-were-going-to-brooklyn/](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/bobby-portis-players-knew-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-were-going-to-brooklyn/)  You should follow basketball more closely before you hurl childhood insults. I did not pull anything out of my ass and it's literally documented in front of you bud.        I find it hilarious that you think we lost all of our bargaining power. KP, when we traded him had not even publicly demanded a trade. He had a meeting where he in private expressed his unhappiness and he would have been open to moving to most any team. Look at AD, the haul that the Pels got would have been fair had AD never demanded a trade. AD essentially only would have accepted a trade to the Lakers. Pels had absolutely no bargaining power.        I love how you are saying I don't understand contracts, you're a moron. Courtney Lee is expiring and THJ has one year left after this upcoming season. We don't need that salary space this year or next. This season Lee and THJ's money is filled with guys like Gibson, Bullock, and fucking Wayne Ellington. Next year only THJ's money would have been on the books and that will be filled with some other useless contract.          In regards to KP happily and quickly signing, he went from not wanting to re up with the Knicks when he was traded to signing a long term deal almost immediately on Dallas. Any team in the league would have signed him to that deal.   &amp;#x200B;  KP was unhappy, no one is arguing with that. You either make him happy or get a better deal.        Feel free to come sit at the adult table when you have something intelligent to add to this discussion."
"Steph Curry wins FMVP against medical-marvel Kevin Durant and the Nets, Warriors in 6."
"Pre-1979 Roster:  PG: Jerry West  SG: Pete Maravich  SF: Julius Erving  PF: Bill Russell  C: Wilt Chamberlain  ​  1980-1991 Roster:  PG: Magic Johnson  SG: Dominique Wilkins/Alex English  SF: Larry Bird  PF: Karl Malone  C: Kareem Abdul Jabbar  ​  1992-2003 Roster:  PG: Michael Jordan  SG: Reggie Miller  SF: Chris Mullins  PF: Tim Duncan  C: Shaq  ​  2004-Present Roster:  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Kobe Bryant  SF: Lebron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Kevin Garnett  I think the 90's team is the most talented, but the present day one is more athletic and can shoot much better.  I don't know who's best, but those are 4 hella talented fives imho."
My point is that Kevin Durant and James Harden will probably make more money over the course of their careers from NBA contracts than Canelo will make from boxing. It wasn't always like this.
"[Steve Kerr says he was told Kevin Durant could only ‘tweak’ injury](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/steve-kerr-told-kevin-durant-could-only-tweak-injury/499615)  &gt;Prior to tip-off, ESPN’s Doris Burke reported that Kerr told her the team has no long-term concerns for Durant or fears of an Achilles injury. He only said Durant could possibly “tweak” the calf injury.  I think it's tough to figure out what was actually said.  However based on KD's instagram reaction I wouldn't be surprised if he felt the Warriors misled him."
I think he wanted to highlight when he’s not playing with a guy like Kevin Durant and even then he’s played with an MVP candidate and DPOY candidate in PG and still flunked in the first round.
"Giannis Antetokounmpo - Eurostep  James Harden - Flop/Travel  Draymond Green - *Angry Donkey Noises*  Stephen Curry - Stepback Three  Dirk Nowitski - Fadeaway  Kevin Durant - Pull-Up Transition Three  Russell Westbrook - Cockback Slam Dunk  Ben Simmons - 0/17 3PT  Joel Embiid - Flex, Crowd Pump, &amp; Flop  Kyrie Irving - *Kowalksi Analysis*"
"Ultimately I strongly feel a Curry led offense would be better than a KD led offense on any team that had a hope of contending. There's an idea of ""scalability"" that I find import in evaluating players. Skills that are not diminished by increasing the talent around you are more important than ones that are. Efficient scoring is inherently more valuable than inefficent scoring(see DeMar DeRozan). Curry is the most efficient high volume scorer in league history, and while Durant is also an efficient high volume scorer, it's not as if there's some weakness to Curry's game that Durant would have an advantage over him on offense. They both score at will, both are super efficient, but Curry is a better playmaker, is more efficient, and ultimately a better player.  Ultimately, every single contending team except the Rockets would most likely benefit more from adding Curry, and that has been the case since GSW's first title season. If Kevin Durant were a truly great defender that might be a different story, but while he's quite good, he doesn't bring it on that end hard enough.  Also keep in mind, that when Durant went out Curry upped his scoring to levels near Harden's without losing his trademark efficiency."
"Kawhi thoroughly outplayed Steph in this season's playoffs, much of which happened *without* Kevin Durant.  Steph is the best shooter of all time, and a great player. His defense is nowhere near elite levels, and you're on D for half of every game."
"That is not why Russ won. Russ won bc Kevin Durant left, so he had to average damn near 31/10/11 to drag OKC to the 6th seed in the West. He was the scoring champion, won countless games through his sheer clutchness, broke record for triple doubles in a season, averaged a triple double, and had the most efficient season of his career.   When you're LEAD THE LEAGUE in scoring AND average a triple double AND drag 2017 Oladipo and Steven Adams to the playoffs in the west, you deserve MVP."

Kevin Durant won’t be starting
"Sorry, I was comparing when Lebron beat the warriors because that seemed to be the context of the first comment.. Kevin Durant didn’t play for the warriors in 15-16."
Kevin Durant? Big name being left off
17 Kevin Durant or 2007 version of Timmy.
Kevin Durant
"Kevin durant is from washington. He lived in PG county too, where I live rn. He comes to Redskins games often. I hate that he never wanted to come to washington lol. Like he would legit be a legend here if he did, even if we didn’t win.  Oh well, guess i’ll watch some more, Rui Hachimara highlights to try to ease the suffering of mediocrity."
"After signing, Durant asked his agent, ""Why the fuck did you let me do this to my life?""  [Link](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2734119-kevin-durant-admits-to-regretting-signing-with-warriors-at-first-due-to-backlash)"
"How about these:  The mission of the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation (KDCF) is to enrich the lives of at-risk youth from low-income backgrounds through educational, athletic and social programs.     In 2018, KDCF made a $10M commitment to bring College Track and The Durant Center to Prince George's County, pledged $3M to support University  of Texas Basketball and the Center of Sports Leadership and Innovation, and completed five basketball court renovations around the world.     In addition, KDCF provided grants to support the work of:      Black Girls Code ($5K)      Teen Diaries Foundation ($7K)      Silicon Valley Debug ($10K)      Larkin Street Youth Services ($12.5K)      Oakland Elizabeth House ($12.5K)       New Heights Youth Inc ($25K)      Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Peninsulas ($74K)"
TIL Kevin Durant is a really good scorer
There will never be a white guy like Kevin Durant or Lebron James. It's not racism it's reality lol
"Not to mention, that argument includes the assumption that there is no way that he could have gotten any better, while in the absolute midst of his prime. GS helped some of course, but damn, he’s still Kevin Durant."
"Yup, that’s a big reason why his streak is making the finals and not winning the finals. Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Dirk are several tiers above 23 year old Paul George."
Too many to name but here’s a list of the best he’s played on the finals:  Dirk Nowitzki  Jason Kidd Tyson Chandler  Kevin Durant x3 Russell Westbrook James Harden Tim Duncan x3 Kawhi Leonard x2 Tony Parker x3 Manu Ginobli x3 Stephen Curry x4 Klay Thompson x4 Draymond Green x4 Iguodala x4
"Lmao, this response reads like it came out of the snarky internet handbook. It's crazy that people still talk like this in 2019. You don't have to speak like a twitter feed that people don't follow.  I am certain that people have improved as a defender late in their careers. It happens literally every single season, all the time. Here are 8 different examples off the top of my head of players who were thought of as bad defenders, who went on to become good or at least ""competent"" defenders.  Marc Gasol Jalil Okafor Klay Thompson Andrew Bogut Andrew Bynum Kevin Durant Demarcus Cousins Kobe Bryant   It's pretty common for guys to improve throughout their career on defense, actually. Again, I didnt say Enes Kanter will be DPOY, nor did I say he would even be competent lol, or anything to incur that useless, cliched, ""SHOW ME ONE ___ ILL WAIT"" response that adds absolutely nothing to this conversation. Just saying. It's not unheard of that Enes could improve slightly as a defender, especially now that he's with by far the best coach he's ever played for."
"What happened to Kevin Durant when he decided to risk it is not going to make it any easier to accuse a superstar of malingering.  Derrick Rose was also accused of malingering by some members of the media and public, then when he did return the next season he suffered another major injury.  For every story like Leonard’s, there are other stories of players returning too early."
Kevin Durant did the [same thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlNdnjuRUYQ) a few weeks later. I don't know why I remember these things.
1. LeBron James 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. Kevin Durant 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Steph Curry 6. James Harden 7. Anthony Davis 8. Paul George 9. Damian Lillard 10. Nikola Jokic
"&gt; What is James Dolan allergic to  &gt; Kyrie Irving Kevin Durant sandwich  &gt; Doris Burke  Lol eh, nothing that bad in your history tbh"
Then Kevin Durant  Also thought about Westbrook for those Thunder teams.
"&gt;He won a scoring title, finished in the top 5 in scoring 6 times, is currently the 19th highest scorer in NBA history and scored over 25,000 points over his career. He was a historically good scorer.   He is a historically high volume scorer. Great scorers put up high volume efficiently.  &gt;Were you watching him play back then or are you going on bball ref to pull out stats?  I watched him back then, and he was undoubtedly a talented player. He was just overrated in terms of his effectiveness. People tend to overrate flashy players like Melo and underrate a lot of the guys who actually help teams win. Melo was a flashy guy with big counting stats, but he was shit when it came to helping teams win.  &gt;It was a conversation up until 2007.   Anyone who was arguing for Melo being in the same conversation as LeBron in 2006 doesn't know shit about basketball.  &gt;He is one of the 75 best NBA players ever.  Melo is one of the 75 best NBA players to ever play for the New York Knicks...probably.   &gt;Lebron James, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard all were outside of the top 10 in VORP this year. Kawhi Leonard was 20th. Is Kawhi Leonard the 20th best player in the league? Is Karl Anthony Towns the 5th best player in the NBA?  If you know how VORP works, then you know that VORP's formula factors in how many games and minutes a player played. Kawhi sat 22 games this year. In the playoffs, he was 1st in VORP.  But, if you don't like VORP, use win shares or other advanced stats. The fact is that counting stats mean very little without the context of efficiency. The dude's ability to hog the ball and jack up shots doesn't make him a better player."
"He won a scoring title, finished in the top 5 in scoring 6 times, is currently the 19th highest scorer in NBA history and scored over 25,000 points over his career. He was a historically good scorer.   Were you watching him play back then or are you going on bball ref to pull out stats? Please, VORP isn't the be all and end all of who the better player was. You would have been laughed out of the building if you said Nene with his 11 points and 5 rebounds per game was better than Carmelo Anthony with 21/6/3.   It was a conversation up until 2007.   He is one of the 75 best NBA players ever. He's an all time great. Him and Dominique Wilkins have the exact same stats, accolades, and team success.   You literally don't know anything about Melo and you keep using VORP to either overvalue or undervalue players. Lebron James, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard all were outside of the top 10 in VORP this year. Kawhi Leonard was 20th. Is Kawhi Leonard the 20th best player in the league? Is Karl Anthony Towns the 5th best player in the NBA?"
I can see an argument for him above Kobe (he moves around the most for me) but idk about the rest. I also have Jerry West and Kevin Durant somewhere outside top 11. The further down the list the harder it gets to rank tbh
Kevin Durant can't even palm a basketball.  Hand size is overrated.
"Great, but how can we spin this into a conversation about him being a bad teammate into him being in a cult and luring Kevin Durant in because KD is the most susceptible to schemes like that"
"I have as many 60 point games as Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook combined"
Maybe not though -- Kevin Durant can't
Jeremy Lin actually confirmed this on his IG story that his injury affected his shooting form. Before he shot with his knees pointed inwards (kind of like Kevin Durant) but now his knees face more forward.
"[Pictured: 6' 11"" Ben Simmons next to 6' 9"" Kevin Durant](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/ben-simmons-of-the-philadelphia-76ers-and-kevin-durant-of-news-photo/1092481596)"
Answer me this what if Kevin Durant didn’t go to GSW and teamed up with someone in NY earlier. And then they beat kawhi in the ECF. What does this do to kawhi huh?
"Thank you, Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant.  It turned into a Steph vs Durant debate when they played together.
"I mean they sure didn't win 73 with Durant, so if anything Harrison Barnes was a slightly better Kevin Durant."
"A lot of NBA players go to China in summer (remember Steph was flying back from China to try and talk KD to re-sign and there was that fake PR snafu with a player not signing autographs).  Nike and other sponsors will get players to do a promotional tour and NBA tries to play preseason games there all the time.  That's supposedly one of the reasons why Kevin Durant wanted to sign with Brooklyn.  Brooklyn's new co-owner (governor) is a founder of AliBaba, a huge company in China."
"Kevin Durant has a normal hairline, find a new slant"
"Durant. Kawhi is amazing in the playoffs but he has off-games and isn’t always at his best offensively. Kevin Durant when healthy is completely undeniable in terms of getting his shot to go in, and I think him and Jordan are the only players I could say this about.  Kevin Durant is also the best regular season scorer of all time, and an all-time playoff player."
"Sigh....   Ibaka and his agent wanted a bigger role. Wasn't getting that in OKC. Ibaka (an expiring contract) was traded for Dipo + Sabonnis who was traded for PG who was traded for SGA + Gallinari + 4 unprotected picks and 2 swaps...   KD did sign his first extension with OKC. He was in OKC longer than he was in GS who he won 2 championships with so maybe GS is toxic? /s   PG signed a 3+1 deal when he was FA.. He could have walked away for nothing and said nothing but nice things about OKC during his Clippers press conference.   Russ literally signed two extensions to stay in OKC but didn't want to be apart of the rebuild so he was traded to the team he wanted. Russ is still on instagram liking posts by the OKC Thunder account.   They offered Harden (who at the time was the 6th man) 5 million dollars less than the max... KD and Russ both took less than max deals on their 1st extensions to help OKC build a team. Harden wanted his own team, he was simply too good to be the 3rd option in OKC. Imagine paying the 6th man max money after not giving it to Kevin fucking Durant.   So no, OKC is not ""toxic"""
"Key pt is that efficiency in pure half court settings and late in the shot clock is still low enough that you arent losing all that much in those spots with mid rangers from good mid range shooters.   The key pt is good mid range shooters. There's a reason guys like Chris Paul and Kevin Durant have the green light to go from mid range whenever they want. It's about recognizing this and just general trust in those kind of players. But when iffy mid range shooters start taking alot of those shots thats when more issues rise  His pts about the Spurs are valid to a degree but they say nothing also about how the Spurs never got to the rim. And there's no strategy, be it modern day analytics or old school type approach that puts an emphasis  on not wanting to get to the rim. I bring this up because I think people sometimes go overboard in hyping up the Spurs 2019 offense as how you can still function great while bucking all analytical trends. Well no....even Popovich would tell you they didnt fully optimize their shot profile by how little they got to the rim"
NBA officially lists him as 6'9 but KD has admitted himself he is almost 6'11 barefooted and 7' in his shoes  [salsa](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/)
Larry Bird and Kevin Durant aren't the same height
"Not my team, but.... beyond the demeanor he went about doing this with, I think Kevin Durant should be forgiven for leaving OKC in the sense that he was justified in leaving based on the team trading 2 of their 4 stars and not truly making a big push to break through to the top after so many years.   I hope KD apologizes for the spirt he left the team with, but ultimately I don’t think he was in the wrong for leaving OKC, and honestly, while it’s kind of a bummer for some that he went to an already great GSW team, he had the right to do so. Fans have the right to not like GSW or KD within reason, but ultimately what he did was fair and within the rules."
"I mean it really depends. PG got traded to Thunder, he liked it there. Wanted to win a chip with them. It's his choice in Free Agency. He's not obligated to come to Lakers. Sure, as a Lakers fan I was kinda mad/disappointed we didn't get PG but in the end it worked out with LeBron. Gotta look on the bright side ya know. So what he did with signing Thunder in *free*agency is his choice. Anyways, PG decided to sign a 4 year contract with them and not even a year later gave up on them.   KD, on the other hand, left at *free*agency. Just like how Paul George was never obligated to join the Lakers, Kevin Durant never had an obligation to stay with the Thunder. He gets to decide where he wants to play next. And since his contract is over, if he gets to join a team where he believes where he could get a best chance to get a chip, he's able to do that because he's not on a contract with the Thunder. Paul George on the other hand feels like he has a chance to win a chip with another team after signing a 4 year contract which he first believed he had a chance on winning with them. Maybe he asked the first time and Thunder agreed. Had Thunder not agreed how would they end up? Do you think the hostage situation would rise? Maybe, maybe not. That's probably what happened to Anthony Davis. He probably talked to Pels and they didn't agree so he decided he wanted to blow it out of proportion.  If someone's on a contract, leaving a team is more snakey then leaving in free agency. The only reason Thunder fans are happy is because they were able to get a good deal. What happens if they weren't able to? Thunder fans would want PG's head. And yes, I do know AD left on a trade for the Lakers. But doesn't mean I think that was cool how he handled it. If someone's on a contract, they should stay for the contract. Thunder probably knew that there was a possibility of an AD situation had they not agreed to PG's offer of a trade. But it all worked out for Thunder. So best of luck to them"
Is it really stupid to say the guy drafted #1 overall ahead of Kevin Durant and only played 82 games over his first 5 years(!!!) is a bust?

6”10 is one of those blatant lies.   Like how Ben Simmons grew to 7 feet or How Kevin Durant is 6”9. Not the actual 7”0-7”1 he is. Or how KD is 240 when he’s 220 soaking wet.   George is a legit 6”8  not that he’s a midget because of that. But the 6”10 was just a bullshit lie told to feed the longboi narrative a few years back.   I
"Kevin Durant, James harden, serge Ibaka, Paul George"
2012(Lebron’s first ring) through 2016 is probably more accurate if you’re including post season play as well. Kevin Durant took over in 2017...All years before and after this four year stretch are debatable tbh.
"Here's every team's franchise leader in Win Shares (only the ones with the team)  Celtics - Bill Russell: 163.5  Nets - Buck Williams: 62.8 (most would say Jason Kidd or Julius Erving ABA)  Knicks - Patrick Ewing: 123.0  76ers - Dolph Schayes: 142.4 (Dr. J and Barkley in a near deadlock for someone who wasn't a Syracuse National)  Raptors - Kyle Lowry: 62.9 (just barely edged out Chris Bosh this year)  Bulls - Michael Jordan: 204.5  Cavaliers - LeBron James: 154.1  Pistons - Bill Laimbeer: 98.4 (rather surprised by this, most would say Isiah Thomas, who the advanced stats didn't love)  Pacers - Reggie Miller: 174.4  Bucks - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 114.7  Hawks - Bob Pettit: 136.0 (Dominique Wilkins for Atlanta only)  Hornets - Kemba Walker: 48.5  Heat - Dwyane Wade: 116.1  Magic - Dwight Howard: 87.5  Wizards - Wes Unseld: 110.1  Nuggets - Dan Issel: 94.8 (Alex English if you take away ABA, and who would be the more popular pick)  Timberwolves - Kevin Garnett: 139.8  Thunder/Sonics - Gary Payton: 123.8 (Kevin Durant for just OKC)   Trailblazers - Clyde Drexler: 108.7  Jazz - Karl Malone: 230.3  Warriors - Wilt Chamberlain: 112.4 (will be Steph soon, who is probably the popular pick)  Clippers - Chris Paul: 78.2  Lakers - Kobe Bryant: 172.7  Suns - Shawn Marion: 93.2 (Steve Nash would be the more likely pick)  Kings - Oscar Robertson: 154.2 (maybe Peja Stojakovic as far as just Sacramento goes)  Mavericks - Dirk Nowitzki: 206.3  Rockets - Hakeem Olajuwon: 160.6  Grizzlies - Marc Gasol: 77.4  Pelicans - Chris Paul: 76.4 (only player to lead two Franchises, AD was very close to unseating him)  Spurs - Tim Duncan: 206.4"
"He’s an excellent defender 24/7, offensively he’s not excellent 24/7. They have four all stars but that doesn’t mean everything. Hardly a bench, Klay is out for a long ass time, and no Kevin durant. How is the WCF a low bar with a team like that? Not to mention the clippers, lakers, and others actually being strong teams that would probably beat the Warriors in a series."
They should retire Kevin Durant and Klay Thompsons's jerseys as if they weren't injured no championship would have left the USA 😂😂😂
Kevin durant is a complete player. You have to be stuck in 2011 if your implying anything else.
"&gt; On Wednesday, July 24, Marvel Stadium’s official page sponsored a post that listed Harden, Lillard, McCollum, and Bradley Beal as members of the squad, despite those players having been withdrawn for at least a week. The imagery featured Harden, Davis, as well as Kevin Durant, who’s recovering from an Achilles tear, and Paul George, who’s never been on the squad.  Pretty shitty really"
Right but that’s just reddit growing. Half that growth is just Kevin Durant making alt accounts to alt accounts anyway.
"Actually kd was the most tightly guarded player that series  72.2% of Kevin Durant's shots were tightly guarded (defender within 4 feet).This was the highest % amongst stars in the series, BY FAR.  If anything Lebron had it easy  % of shots that were open (no defender within 4 feet), 2017 Finals LeBron - 49.6% Curry - 48.4% Kyrie - 38.3% KD - 27.8% Klay - 55.7% Draymond - 52.7% Love - 47.7%  KD was the most tightly defended star in the series BY FAR. Not even close. Kevin Durant shot 18-25 from the field (72%) when guarded by LeBron James in the Finals.LeBron shot 20-37 (54%) when guarded by Kevin Durant in the NBA Finals.  Durant was clearly the superior scorer and defender in the Finals. But he gets knocked for having a great team. Did you even watch?"
Lol what? Kevin Durant is far and away the OKC GOAT.
"His offensive game isn’t predicated on absurd athleticism. It’s more length, great handles, and good vision/timing.  Coupled with him injuring the Achilles that he doesn’t jump off and medical advances, the chance that he comes back at the same level exists.  A lot of his performances will come down to how his team works with switching, spacing, and allowing him do take advantage of everything. You know who he is, he’s Kevin Durant."
"I’ll note that they got swept by Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala."
"I understand why he won MVP that year, but from a mere statistical standpoint it makes little sense.  Derrick Rose - 25.0/7.7/4.1 on 44.5/33.2/85.8 (55.0% TS)  LeBron James - 26.7/7.0/7.5 on 51.0/33.0/75.9 (59.4% TS) + Defensive 1st Team  Dwyane Wade - 25.5/4.6/6.4 on 50.0/30.6/75.8 (58.1% TS)  Dwight Howard - 22.9/1.9/14.1 on 59.3/0.0/59.7 (61.6% TS) + DPOY  Kevin Durant - 27.7/2.7/6.8 on 46.2/35.0/88.0 (58.9% TS)  Kobe Bryant - 25.3/4.7/5.1 on 45.1/32.3/82.8 (54.8% TS) + Defensive 1st Team"
"&gt; G-Steve Nash G-Stephen Curry F-Larry Bird F-Kevin Durant C-Dirk Nowitski  That's 5 of the 8 members of the 50-40-90 club. As efficient as it gets.  * Suns Nash shot 50-44-91, 62% TS  * Dynasty Curry has shot 49-43-91, 65% TS  * '85-'88 Bird shot 52-41-90, 60% TS  * GSW KD shot 51-40-90, 64% TS in the playoffs  * '09-'11 Dirk shot 50-42-94, 62% TS in the playoffs  Now they'd get absolutely gashed on defense, but man the offense would be beautiful. Like 55% 2P, 42% 3P, 91% FT, 63% TS as a team. Plus beautiful passing from Nash, Curry, and Bird.  125 ORtg, 115 DRtg."
Remove LeBron's rings &amp; Finals MVPs with Miami Heat and I really doubt he would be a consensus top 10 player of all time. Or Kevin Durant being a top 20 player ever if he never joined Warriors.
"Rings (or rather Finals MVPs) do matter for superstars and their all-time ranking. People can hate on Kevin Durant &amp; LeBron for joining a stacked deck, but they've elevated their status in all-time ranking after winning rings + Finals MVPs."
Yeah but not by as much as you think. A 3% increase is shooting through the roof? And kevin durant is an extreme example because his teammate is the greatest shooter ever. And even then his efficiency didnt increase that much  I wouldnt expect kembas efficiency to go up by more than a percentage or 2. And that's not enough to make him better than kyrie considering kyrie is significantly more efficient.
It’s a true statement. Kevin Durant joined a team that went 73-9 the previous season.
"The Heats game plan was to focus on James Harden, Kevin Durant was not their main focus as they knew they could match anything Durant did on offence so they focused on stopping their bench production."
Kevin Durant being petty on the media is nowhere near as bad as Dwight being a locker room cancer and unwilling to do what he is asked to do on the basketball court.  Dumb comparison
"Kevin Durant 2017 Finals MVP: 35.2 PPG, 8.4 RPG, 5.4 APG on 70% TS  is a good example why"
haha get it?? Kevin Durant joined a good team one time in his career (not that they even won the championship the year before he joined but still snakes amirite)
"That's amazing. Kevin Durant, known as a scorer and with 4 scoring titles, only has 55, but in 849 games, so basically the same rate as AD."
"&gt;An ESPN reporter has clarified comments he made earlier this week saying Kevin Durant told ex-Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook he was going to re-sign with the team this off-season.  &gt;“I misspoke in saying that Durant specifically told Westbrook he was coming back,” ESPN reporter Royce Young wrote on Wednesday.  &gt;These were not direct quotes meant to be attributed to Durant.

Well Stephen Curry changed the game as far as the 3 point shot so if your offense is revolves around the 3 then it would make sense to revolve around Steph. However Kevin Durant is included in some of the most unguardable players of all time -LeBron -Kareem -Giannis  -Sometimes Jordan  If you were picking an All Star team Kevin Durant would surely be over Steph and I think in Brooklyn he’ll prove that he can lead a franchise or at least be the centerpiece of it.
Next Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka Will be traded to the Houston Rockets.
"See I don't think they're salty that you were winning the titles, it was the manner in which it happened.  Timeline right here: -Dominant 67 win Warrior team wins, gets a bit lucky in the finals due to injuries -Even more dominant 73 warriors team struggles in the playoffs, to what I think were injuries, especially seeing how immobile Curry seemed, but to what many consider a simple choke job. Either way, hard fought series, was fun to watch. -However, you add a top 3 player in the NBA in Kevin Durant to add to the second best player even though you clearly don't need that. Proceed to crush the league(Kawhi also gets injured by a Warriors player) -Next season, clear dominance but Rockets pose a real threat. People actually credit the Warriors here for passing a real test especially seeing how close the series were, but Paul did get injured and that was a potential dethroning there. -2019: We saw what happened, sorry for your loss, but the impression is that the Warriors screwed over KD.   A lot of people are annoyed at the way you acquired KD, and how many injuries there were on your path. Personally though, you also endured your fair share of injuries and I think Iggy against the Rockets would have been extremely helpful.   Either way, the Warriors dominance was quite infuriating, especially 2017."
"Duncan has more rings than KG, Dirk, Davis, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, James Harden, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Damian Lillard, Paul George, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Blake Griffin, and Kevin Durant combined."
"Players I’d say are correctly rated:  James Harden (universally hated, but his skills are well respected, at least in the regular season)  Giannis  Klay Thompson  Jimmy Butler  Marc Gasol  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant pre-injury  Nikola Jokic  Paul George  There’s always gonna be nutjobs, but these are guys who you never really see any true nephew takes upvoted.  Now, this is only in regards to their skill level."
"Nothing epitomized LACs awful roster construction more than every yr without fail season on the line Doc would put Chris Paul on guys he'd be giving up 6-12 inches on. Largely because they didnt have a 3 worth a damn   2014 vs OKC: Game 4 4th quarter season on the line Doc throws his hands up in the air and asks 5'11 CP3 to guard 6'11 Kevin Durant.   2015 vs Hou: Game 7 he spends a ton of time on James Harden a 6'5 super bulky 2 guard. JJ who had done an amazing job on him was worn out and season on the line Doc just said fuck it having no other choice   2017 vs Utah: Game 7 with Luc Mbah Moute unplayable the point guard/combo guard trio of Raymond Felton, Austin Rivers and Chris Paul all took their turns guarding 6'8 Gordon Hayward.   Paul was a great defender but there was a certain level of hilarity to how every yr in a season defining game the roster issues would show themselves in the worst and most obvious way to the entire world by having to put a 5'11 guard on these big wings."
"Yes, and he beat both those dynasties at their peak. Wade didn't need knee surgery, Lebron and Klay didn't leave games early, and Kevin Durant averaged 35!"
&gt;disappointing  I think that goes to Portland. Imagine missing on Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant.

I don't give a shit what Kevin Durant does.
"I've sold myself on Westbrook with the Rockets at this point. The Rockets were unusually slow last year and the one-man fast break aspect of Russ' game makes sense in that context. They were an unusually bad defensive rebounding team and I think that Russ' game makes sense in that context as well.   This is also the best team of shooters that Russ has had around him since Kevin Durant and James Harden were on the Thunder, and I think that kind of spacing will improve his ability to score inside and rack up assists. On OKC there's been a lot of traffic in the paint for him to deal with, and kicking out on drives is a much lower % play because only George was an elite shooter.   The only question marks are his defense and his ability to shoot on his own, but I think that those things can be schemed around and the talent level is there to make this an upgrade over Chris Paul at the nadir of his career."
"Think this may be it (good series on RAPM either way). He says the way he does technical fouls can drop KD's RAPM by about 1 point. I don't think it ever goes into more specifics on measured differences but if it can be that large for technical I would imagine it could happen for regular free throws.  https://squared2020.com/2018/12/24/regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-part-iii-what-had-really-happened-was/  &gt; For our results, we compute stints as consecutive possessions played by a group of ten players. The way that I compute possessions is quite different than many other RAPM creators. For instance, the definition of possession is not uniform across the league. While my method of counting possessions matches the end of game results; distributing such possessions raise eyebrows. For instance, if a substitution is made during a free-throw and an offensive rebound occurs with a putback score; instead of double counting the possession, I say the second unit has given up 2 points over zero possessions as they had an empty possession that they yielded a score. Other folks will double count possessions. Others will count half-possessions. Either way you slice that possession, you induce an implicit bias in the direction of either unit. My implicit bias is that you should be penalized for not securing an offensive rebound despite being placed in best position, given the rules of the league.  &gt; In a similar manner, I tack on technical fouls onto current possessions. Many folks treat technical fouls as new possessions. Therefore the games where three technical fouls occur on one possession, I count it as one possession; while another person will count it as four possessions; three possessions with at most one point. And if we look at the computation of XtY above, you wee this will have grave effects on the resulting distributions. In fact, the biggest discrepancy year after year is Kevin Durant benefits from technical fouls like no other. It happens again this year as the technical foul discrepancy I impose drops his defensive RAPM upwards of a point per 100 possessions. It’s crazy to see how minor possession definitions dramatically affect RAPM."
You can add Kevin Durant too. He's freakishly taller than his parents.
"Us and the Jazz neutralized the vast majority of offences with that defensive scheme. Unless Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are the only pick and roll players you consider “elite” it’s not that simple."
"They'll only make the playoffs if they're clones of very specific all-time best high schoolers in the country. The teams basically amount to MJ, LeBron, and 3 guys who can't guard 1 on 1, can't keep pace in transition, can't rebound, and are a step slow reacting to any play. With exception of LeBron himself, high school-age players don't have NBA-ready bodies. They're still growing, and are not fast, strong, and tall the way that most NBA players are. In high school, Giannis was more Kevin Durant than Orlando Shaq. CJ McCollum was closer to 5 feet than to 6. Marc Gasol was more sphere than man. The team will be cut apart by any somewhat competent passers, exhausted by any vaguely fit floor-runners, and trampled by any reasonably beefy big men. MJ and LeBron will need to score nearly every trip down the floor to keep pace.  Now, if this were MJ, LeBron, and a mix of rookie LeBrons, Dwights, and Kobes, we'd have a different story."
Man then had the balls to try to do it to the warriors. And he would have done it too if it wasn't for that meddling Kevin durant
"He'd have gotten some run in that particular hyper-crisis scenario, but I'm guessing those rare situations aren't usually the basis of his free agency negotiations.   Carter's on record of saying he's hanging around the league so he can actually play, not just ride coattails to victory, so if the Warriors were to have pitched something like, ""Heyyyy buddy, your only real chance at minutes here will be if Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kevon Looney, and Andre Iguodala all go down with moderate to severe infirmities at the same time, you down?"", I don't imagine he he'd have been, in fact, down."
"Don’t be ridiculous. Westbrook is a good passer but acting like he’s “definitely” going to have eleven assists next year is absurd. I think Harden literally had three most unassisted points in league history last year. They will do less iso but it’s still going to be a big part of the offense and there will still be a ton of unassisted Harden baskets this year.  Westbrook’s going to have the ball less too, there will be occasional possessions where he doesn’t touch the ball, he’s not “definitely gonna have a career best in assists.” There’s only a small chance he has 11 assists per game (which would be a career high) and most people are suggesting 8-9 because he won’t be in charge of as many possessions.  Also he’s played with shooters before lmao. He’s had guys like Kevin Durant, Kevin Martin, Paul George, etc. Youre only thinking of the MVP year where there was very little shooting on his team.   Also assists don’t automatically go up or down only based on quality of shooters around him because it can be affected by three point rate, etc. even though three pointers are more efficient in general, they go in a less percentage of the time (37% from three still goes in less than a 50% two even though it’s less efficient, which affects asssits number)  Also Harden was the most efficient iso scorer in league history last year. They’re likely to do less iso this year with Westbrook’s addition and last year being an outlier but there will still be plenty of unassisted Harden threes.  Also the Rockets draw a fuckton of free throws which doesn’t even count as plays where you can have assists"
this sounds like something kevin durant would say
"Kevin Durant. Every day, every hour, every minute, every second of the week."
Because they had Kevin Durant. Those teams aren't relevant to the discussion
"Yep seeing something like Al Horford bring the ball up court and play point guard hwich he did alot in 2018 as an ex is just absurd.   The skill of even role players is just taken for granted. IF you were come up with a list of players who ""Shouldnt dribble in an NBA game"" PJ Tucker would be near the top. And [he can still do shit like this](https://twitter.com/RocketIntellect/status/1154609200758185989?s=20)(ignore the pass at the end and focus on his step back lmao). Never forget even one of the worst ball handlers in the NBA could go to a pick up game with guys who are legit good and absolutely cross some up if that's what they focused on doing.   On the converse of what you were saying regarding Chris Paul [the fact a 5'11 guard could even attempt to defend someone like Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opdFzn3teSA) is just absurd and breathtaking if you watch it without bias. He got alot of help that playoff game vs KD but that first play in that video was maybe the most entire play of that 4th quarter: CP3 stripped KD, spooked him from trying to dribble again and made him exclusively just try to post up CP3. CP3 then was able to make him catch the balll in the post away from the basket and him having to turn his back to the defense is what allows the doubles to come and be effective."
"I feel like that about a lot of things on this sub. There’s some opinions that you just aren’t allowed to have here. You can’t like Karl Malone because if you say one thing about him as a player, you get bombarded with comments talking about how he’s a rapist and deserves to die. You can’t like Kevin Durant because if you say anything good about him, you get all these replies calling him a snake, a bitch, and starting a chain of “Fuck KD”.  And there isn’t even any original jokes here. Every topic has like 4 pre-made jokes that people just spam every time it gets brought up. Post about Kawhi Leonard? Fun Guy / Boardman is every comment. Post about someone’s weight? Every comment is about Zion or Kelvin Benjamin. Post about Paul Pierce? Every comment is about shitting his pants. And the stupid “nephew” shit gets so old. I just want to talk about the NBA, but any time anyone makes a legitimate post, everyone jumps out of their seat to comment the first shitty joke that comes to their mind in order to get karma."
TIL Kevin Durant is good. Thanks man
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were drafted by the Supersonics before the move to OKC was announced.
"magic johnson has had stacked finals teams with kareem yet he was able to rise above and be the best player on the team in the big moment.   see: 1987 finals.   stephen curry has never done that. his efficiency took a hit and he didn't win a finals MVP in 2015, he scored an inefficient 17 points in g7 in 2016, he was outplayed by kevin durant in 2017 and 2018, and he was disappointing for most of the 2018 NBA finals.  i really hope you're not gonna try and compare magic and steph's finals resumes"
"and my point remains-- Curry has done more in his time in the league than even Wade, KG, Dr J, and yes, Kevin Durant. Those are big names, i know, but so is Curry."
In 2011 i legitimately said Kevin Durant would never win a ring without at least multiple all stars surrounding him and is comfortable being a robin to someone’s batman.

"Once upon a time, Warriors legend Kevin Durant spent a little time playing for OKC  Also James Harden way back when"
Kevin Durant scored 11 pts in game 5 of the 2019 finals and they still won lol.
"its only really smart for the BEST players to sign 1 years every year, like kevin durant is getting max regardless of his torn achilles  you go down several rungs, to the cousins tier, and getting injured costs you a ton of money"
Kevin Durant. Does the most charitable work without drawing attention to it. *cough cough*. Very kind hearted human being.   I don’t give a crap if he gets into arguments on Twitter. That’s not relevant.
"no. I think Bol is too tall. Kevin Durant is right on the range of being too tall, he has trouble dribbling around smaller guys, if he was any taller he'd get stripped way too easily. I think MJ was the perfect blend of height, length and athleticism. give MJ Curry's shot and he's averaging 60ppg. the only reason he's not averaging more is because the game is over before he has to come back in for the 4th. seriously it'd just be ridiculous to have to cover a guy with that athleticism all the way to the 3 point line. he'd lose you off the ball if you were chasing him around screens, and if you're covering him tight on the 3 point line he's easily blowing past you and getting into the paint or settling for a wide open jumper.. sure Bol could shoot 45% from 3 at any time, but he still wouldn't be a good ball handler or screen setter with that skelly body."
While 1+1 seems to be the prevailing thought. He has an injury history so he could take the Max. I say this because Lebron and Kevin Durant are the only players who’ve taken the 1+1 because they have financial security from Nike deals
&gt; slightly shorter Kevin Durant?  Wat
"So....  a slightly better shooting, slightly shorter Kevin Durant? You're describing KD"
"It's a really strange career arc.  He's managed to become one of the top scorers in the league without ever actually scoring that much.  Kawhi is [7th in his own draft class in career scoring](https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2011.html), behind Vucevic, Isaiah Thomas and Tobias Harris.  He scored 8250 points before his 28th birthday; Kevin Durant had 15537 points at the same age.  [23 active players have scored 1900 points in a season, but not Kawhi](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_active=Y&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=1888&amp;order_by=pts)."
"Cousins had a reputation for being an empty stat player who had never made playoffs. Cousins was never anywhere close to Kawhi as a player and anyone who wants to argue against it is an idiot.          We have Kevin Durant who has literally the worst injury possible for a basketball player and multiple GMs are ready to offer him a max deal. Yeah, Kawhi is much closer to Durant than Cousins."

"The Warriors weren't just Curry, Klay, and KD. They also had Draymond, Iguodala, and Livingston. These Lakers would be more like the Heat. The Warriors were one of the best teams of all time before flipping Barnes, Bogut, and some depth for Kevin Durant.  These Lakers wouldn't be as great and they would have a much smaller window. In that way it's a bit more like the Celtics where it's a great team for the next two years or so and then there would be a decline.  I dont want it to happen especially after the Warriors' dominance but I dont think itd be as bad for the competitiveness of the league as the KD signing was."

Kevin Durant signing with the Warriors
Not scrawny as fuck basketball players   Do you think Kevin Durant can bench a lot?
Kevin Durant
Ben Wallace is easily ahead of Kevin Durant and anyone who disagrees is a reasonably intelligent person.
"yeah, curry just isn't good enough to be the best player in a finals series. i'm glad we're accepting that. it's his legacy at this point. kevin durant is the greatest warrior of all-time."
"No order  Lebron James Kobe Bryant Dwyane Wade Carmelo Anthony Dwight Howard Chris Paul Deron Williams Kevin Durant Rajon Rondo Dirk Nowitzki  Honorable Mentions: Joe Johnson, Gerald Wallace, Brandon Roy, Pau Gasol, Rondo, Stoudemire,..."
"I would like it to happen.. And I don't think it would be similar to the Warriors, and here's why. The Warriors were already established as the best team in the league prior to KD joining. Yeah, they lost in the finals, but they had the best regular season record ever, and everybody knew the Warriors were the better team. The Warriors already had the rest of the team necessary for a title prior to Kevin Durant joining them. They had Harrison Barnes (who they had to let walk), Livingston and Iggy, and Bogut. Teams can't win a title without help for the superstars, and the Warriors had the support as well as the All Stars to go along with them. The team was complete prior to KD joining, but he was just the cherry on top. Let's look at the Lakers currently. Right now they only really have Lebron, AD, and Kuzma. They also have Moe Wagner, Isaac Bonga, and Jemerrio Jones. Those guy's aren't the role players you need for a title. The Lakers (even with Kawhi) still are a lot further away from being a complete team than the Warriors were (with or without Kevin Durant)"
"&gt; replace him with an actual great superstar like prime kawhi in 2015 and 2018 cavs easily win or at least have a muuuuuch better chance than he did  No player on Earth is beating a 67 win team with one of Mozgov/Dellavedova/Thompson as their second best player. If you really think that any other player could do it, you're just straight up ignorant lmfao.   &gt; Guy literally has 0 rings without a superteam LMFAO  Without Durant on the team, Curry has one ring against a team with their second and third best player missing. He coulda led his 73 win team to the 2016 championship but instead shot 6/19 in Game 7 at home LMFAO. He shot 1/6 in the fourth quarter, what a true superstar he is. LeBron scored 11 points in the fourth and made one of the greatest defensive plays of all time.   &gt; Whats ironic is you called the 2018 team a dumpster even though they had all star love but use him as your main excuse for cavs losing 2015  Kyrie Irving missing the series is the main excuse. Love is secondary.   And I called the 2018 team a dumpster fire because anyone with a brain knows that the team sucked. Look up that team's playoff stats and tell me that was a good team. They were good against the Raptors and that's literally it.   Kevin Love scored in single digits in 5/20 playoff games (not including the game he left early)and show below 40% from the field in 12 of those games."
Steph Curry  Michael Jordan  Kevin Durant  Lebron James  Hakeem Olajuwon (almost went with Shaq).  6th man: Manu Ginobili
"No he is a snake and a dirty ring chaser that ruined basketball!  Oh wait this isn't Kevin Durant, the guy is a legend."
He has more DPOY than Kevin Durant.
"The “shows of insecurity” was not referring to that speech, there are plenty of examples of that (i.e. burner accounts). The I’m Kevin Durant speech is utmost confidence... perhaps beating the Lebron “regular lives” speech."
2014: this kid is gonna be huge. He's got more potential than Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant combined. He's peerless.   2019: he's fighting to stay in the NBA

"Despite surprising shows of insecurity to how people think about him, the “I’m Kevin Durant” speech was greatness... because its true on all counts"

Can't you read? He isn't Kevin Durant
&gt; He's clearly Kevin Durant.  Read his username. He's not Kevin Durant dummy
Its kind of sad that is over.  I mean im not the biggest kevin durant fan but people are talking at worst hes gonna be top 5 now.   At best he'll be top 10.  His shit completely tore. It sucks.
"Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant"
And a hundred percent reason to remember he's Kevin Durant
Plot twist: Kevin Durant posted this to look like he's good at basketball  /s for all that need it
"He’s not worth the 35% Max at this point with that injury. The 30% Max that Kyrie, Butler, Kawhi, Etc are eligible for is what he should get but he won’t just because he’s Kevin Durant.   As a Nets fan I assume they’re going to throw a bunch of $ not on future performance but past performance and because Durant is a name.    Odds are whatever team signs Durant will give him a 3+1 with a Player Option in the 4th year. We already know Durant will miss the 1st year so now it’s a 2+1. Besides the exceptions the majority of Achilles take what 2yrs until the Player looks back to normal? Now you’re down to a 1+1.   What happens in Year 3 when Durant is potentially back to normal and maybe putting up decent numbers and opts out at 33yrs old because some team offers him a Horford type 4y/$100m+ deal.    Shit can get fucked real quick with Durant because whatever team signed him will have just spent 2yrs paying for Durant’s rehab for a 1yr window at a potential championship.    At that point it’s like hey do we invest another $100m+ on a 33yr old who had 1 good year after his Achilles injury on the downside of his career or do we go to another rebuild?"
"My wife is a manager for a big massage franchise we're lots of celebs and A list stars come and Kevin Durant  seems to be or used to be a regular. Sometime a year ago my wife asked if I knew who a guy named Kevin Durant was and I said yes. She said he came in with some other tall guy for their appointment. Durant  asked a front desk worker if she could charge his phone please since it was dying. My wife then sent me a Pic of his phone with a message sent to him from Blake G. Saying ""I'm so stoked for tonight, don’t forget the tilapia sandwiches for Josh Smith“. I couldn’t show anyone online because I didn't want my wife getting in trouble but shit was crazy.

This dude should not be getting downvotes. He's clearly Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant. I recall LeBron reaching out to him while still in high school.
This is aggravating. Of course the Warriors are better with Kevin Durant. Do they need him to be a legitimate top seed in the NBA? Fuck no. KD's money can be used to shore up some depth and they'd be fine.  Raptors didn't prove anything about the Warriors. It is what it always is and has been since the 2016 free agency.
"Kevin Durant was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Sean Marks. He made Durant look smart, which isn’t easy to do."

Dude would still get the max from most teams out there just coz he’s Kevin fucking Durant
You do but not from someone named Kevin Durant
Kevin durant?
"I'm sorry, man, but I think we're talking about completely different players.   I watch every Pelicans game. I think I missed 5 last season and about the same the season before that. Two seasons ago he was the highest percent shooter from the lowest percentage area in the NBA (mid range right before the 3pt line). His mid range is beautiful, he just uses it too much.   His floaters are amazing and his touch around the rim is gorgeous.   His post moves need a little work but that's mostly a size and motivation issue. He hates playing center and he's not really a post up big. That's like saying Kevin Durant has bad post moves; it's true, but it's not like he needs them."
Kevin Durant would never have gone to the Warriors if Steph wasn’t there. He won a ring before KD came and lead a 73 win team. It has to be Steph.
Kevin Durant
Arms of Kevin Durant
Completely different. Kevin Durant hopped on an already established dominant team. Kawhi hoping on the Lakers would be 3 dudes playing together for the first time.
You do realize that Steph then shot 67.5% TS with Kevin Durant right? And this is about clutch and you pointed out yourself that Curry took a step back in the Finals and then I add that after Klay went down in game 6 Steph went 1 for 6 and went from 5 points up to losing by 4 while missing the shot to regain the lead. Not clutch bro
I'm Kevin Durant
"It’s not brainless it’s how society works. When talking to someone, you make snap judgements of context based on their appearance, what they wear, how they talk, etc. When talking about Kevin Durant, a GSW fan is going to say how he is great, a true champion, a great scorer. An OKC fan is going to have some choice words because they experienced the feeling of betrayal and watched how their old favorite player was treating his old team.   Do you not see how you, a Raptors fan, might not see how much it hurts to see the star of my team ghost the team and coach, after the coaches wife had just fucking died, refused to allow the team doctors to work with him, refused to attend games, or even attend the playoffs, never make public statements, and then publicly put the team in a horrible situation by forcing them to trade him or he will sit out. You don’t see how that might make me see him in a poor light?  But he isn’t a bad guy and me wanting to know a bit of context for how to phrase this discussion to better help you see makes me brainless. Lmao."
"Just 50~60% of GSW roster would have suffice to beat you guys. Kevon Looney, Andre Iguidala, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins are all injured.   Fk it let’s do this;  • Game 1 : lost by 9 pts  Broken Cousins, Hurt Iguodala, Soon be dead - Kevon Looney, Missing a snake. They had to play J. Bell ffs.   Healthy (from actual starting line up) : Draymond Green, Klay and Curry   Kawhi had 23, Marc Gasol had 20. This game we saw mad Siakam, the dude actually won the game for the Raptors. They deserved this one.   • Game 2 : won by 5 pts Broken Cousins, Hurt Iguodala, Actually died this time - Kevon Loney, Followed by Klay Thompson after 32 mins of playtime. Still missing a snake. They had to play fucking Q. Cook  Survivor : Curry and Draymond Green   Kawhi had 34, with the rest of the points shared between all players, the lowest was 6.  GSW just won this game with Zombies basically.   • Game 3 : Lost by 14 pts Broken Cousins, Dead Klay, Somehow the snake is still missing, Kevon Looney out, somewhat better-somewhat hurt Iguodala.   Last man standing : Curry and Draymond   • Game 4 : lost by 13 pts  At this point nearly everyone died and Kevon Looney forcing himself to play, at least they got Klay back.  Support has arrived :  Curry, Draymond, and Klay  This is the game where the Klaw scratch its mark on the Oracle arena.   • Game 5 : won by 1 point With a snake that was killed in action after 11 minutes, but that was apparently enough.   Left Alive and Healthy :  Klay, Curry, Draymond   • Game 6 : lost by stupid referee that gave that one three a 2 point instead. Klay died in 3rd quarter when he was on pace to get at the least 40 pts, and the rest still dying.  Some Iconic moments : → Injured players like , Kevon, Cousins playing even with their injuries. →  Steph Curry sitting on the other side while his comrade fell, and then throwing the basketball hard to the ground. → Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Steve Kerr smiling together and “you did good” Moment after Steph missed the last three in what could be called their last chance.   I sure don’t like Golden State Warriors, however they played with more heart than anyone or any team for such a long time. It would have been nice to see people like Klay, Curry, Draymond get a 3peat, they deserved it.  Sure, the Raptors deserved this but had the Warrios got at least 60% (3) of their starter played fully, the story would have been so much different. I believe had they have that kind of timeline, they would have their 3peat."

Kevin Durant and Jamie Foxx?
Russell Westbrook apparently changed his name from Kevin Durant at some point
"I love Kawhi a lot more than I like Kevin Durant - however, recency bias is overrated where Kawhi is **right now** from a historical perspective.  Kawhi has 3 seasons of 20+ PPG scoring in **his career.**  2015-2016 was his first noticeably good offensive season, where he averaged 21.2 PPG.  He's made 3 all-NBA teams in his career.  Durant averaged 20.3 the moment he came into the league and 25 PPG his 2nd year, has 4 scoring titles, and has been **a 1st-team all NBA caliber player since 2010, making 1st or 2nd team every year** except for the 1 year he was injured (2015).  While Kawhi is rightfully so seen as by most people the best player in the league right now, Durant is miles ahead of everyone else as the 2nd best player of the 2010s (behind LeBron, Steph is honestly probably closest to him for his work from 2014-now).    My point isn't that scoring is everything - it's that Durant has been near elite, since 2008-2009 until 2019, being a Top 2-Top 5 caliber player for a decade.  Kawhi was good in 2012-2014 on the defensive side, and has been elite for 3 NBA seasons.  Kawhi is arguably a more complete player than Durant has ever been in his entire career right now, and **his two Finals MVPs are infinitely more impressive than Durant's** \- however, when **fairly** looking at both bodies of work right now, **Durant is miles ahead.**  The Durant hate train (which I'm a part of) for the decisions he's made has clouded how fucking good he historically is.  There have been very, very, few scorers or players that have achieved what he has achieved."

"  His contested rebounds per game is the highest amongst player's that are under 6'4 and second amongst players that are under 6'7 (second only to PJ Tucker). He also ranks as the highest guard in the league in the same stat. That can't possible be meaningless?    His rebound chance is the best for players under 6'10, and ranks highly amidst the true bigs when the parameters include the whole league. As per the contributor of the stat, rebound chance determines;  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; The number of times player was within the vicinity (3.5 ft) of a rebound. Measures the number of rebounds a player recovers compared to the number of rebounding chances available as well as whether or not the rebound was contested by an opponent or deferred to a teammate.   &amp;#x200B;     So for each of these rebound chances, he is in position to rebound the ball. Above many players in the league. In position to hustle for the loose ball or rebound, even if his man is not there to do so. The league reports Steven Adams has a rebound chance of around 18, which still ranks in the top 15 of the league. He is not having his soul drained for the purpose of Russ' stats.  &amp;#x200B;  Even more important is [NBA.com](https://NBA.com) tracks Adjusted Rebound % which they define as follows;  &gt; Percentage of rebounds gathered when given a rebound chance; excludes all deferred rebounds   &amp;#x200B;    As expected, except by you apparently, Russell Westbrook boasts a % of 69.7%. Which is good for 5th overall in the NBA and best among guards. He is beaten by Kevin Love, Lauri Markannen, Aaron Gordon, and Kevin Durant. He collects the most rebounds out of all of these players, has more contested rebounds per game than Kevin Durant, and is within 1.9% of first place. He ranks above notable rebounders such as; Giannis, Drummon, Davis, and Deandre Jordan.   &amp;#x200B;    So the stats paint Russ as a rebounder who is always in position, and collects an extremely efficient number of rebounds per chance. Especially relative to his size and position. His contested rebound percentage is the best among guards and second among players under 6'10 (to PJ Tucker, a notable hustler and rebounder). Even excluding deferred rebounds, he hangs in the most elite strata of rebounders.   &amp;#x200B;    If we want to say the stats don't paint him as a winning player we can look to his regular season stats in which he ranks Top 10 in the league for VORP, BPM, OPM, DPPM. His advanced rebounds stats as mentioned before demonstrate is a historically good rebounding guard and contends with the bigs in the leagues in terms of chances, and converted chances. If we're being logically consistent, it's hard not to accept that he is a winning player. If you love the stats so much, here they are."
"I generally intentionally underrated players who are still in the middle of their legacy building or are still ""mid-career"", most notably Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant.  As great as Kawhi has been in recent memory, he's only a 3x All-Star and 3x all NBA team.  Kawhi is positioned to catapult himself as high as Tier 5 by the end of his career, I project he'll probably land in the Tier 6/7 area.  I can see the argument for Tier 8 right now.  KD could probably be Tier 5 right now."
Reggie Jackson   Idk   Kevin Durant   Idk  Idk
Kevin Durant and Charles Barkley? Our team would win without a doubt. Those dudes are scrubs
"Well, the way I look at it is this is all entertainment and fun.. they get paid millions of dollars to play a game and we love it, love them.  KD chose a villain role.. I don't really blame the drunk and high Toronto fans who cheered that injury.. they got lost in the moment until it hit them that this was for real.  &amp;#x200B;  but when it comes to injuries, it ain't a game anymore.  it ain't entertainment.  One of the best NBA players to ever play just went down hard on the biggest stage.  Fuck yeah we didn't actually want that to happen.  Nobody actually wanted him to get hurt like this.    &amp;#x200B;  It's gonna be different for him than Derrick.. him getting hurt like this is was not expected and during his prime.  I think there's a lot of ways to look at this, but the bottom line is that it sucks for the NBA, for basketball fans, the warriors and, most of all, for Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant
"Mike Conley is only a year older than Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Westbrook. He is younger than Kyle Lowry, Horford, CP3, &amp; Aldridge."
Kevin Durant has a very large penis!
This sub loves narratives more than it loves basketball. Look at how Kevin Durant free agency questions were being asked during the finals compared to ACTUAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE GAMES
Bol Bol is going to be the next Kevin Durant.  Rises up over everyone.  55% from 3.  Blocks everyone.  Excellent court vision.  Knows how to pass bc he played point guard in 8th grade.  Inspired by Manute's Bol's death.  Chip on his shoulder from being passed on by everyone in the draft except Nuggets.  Future MVP incoming.
Kevin Durant. would of never been injured.
Kevin Durant scores more than Kyle Singler while taking more shots hence more opportunity.
"Forget a step back. It’s hard to guard a fadaway in general. Guarding a step back is incredibly difficult especially if the ball handler is curry or harden. What’s make it difficult is sometimes they pass out of the step back and then locate to another spot on the floor with intention to put it up at a more comfortable angle. Curry does this all the time. Steps back, passed out of the shot, locates to the corner, bang 3 points. Harden is more committed to his step back and is lengthier at 6’5 with longer arms that he internally sticks out as far as possible to draw contact. I also had to throw in Dirk nowitzkis one legged fadaway that he made a HOF career on and sometimes I get to smile watching Kevin Durant shoot one legged fadaways in a similar fashion. Toughest shot in the NBA that only the goats can make consistently while also being under pressure"
"And let’s not forget, they got a meeting with Kevin Durant where their owner cried and begging him to sign. He didn’t."
Bol Bol is going to be the next Kevin Durant.  Rises up over everyone.  55% from 3.  Blocks everyone.  Excellent court vision.  Knows how to pass bc he played point guard in 8th grade.

So their hot takes doesn’t turn the player base against them. Like how Stephen A Smith would mention how Kevin Durant was a class act before tearing him down.
Ou se trouve Kevin Durant? Il n'est pas ici.  God I hope I wrote that right. Ive forgotten so much.
"You can look all this shit up.  https://hoopshype.com/salaries/new_orleans_pelicans/  You need to clear $35ish million for a max slot. With what assets would they attach to the shit contracts to clear max space for Lebron? Assuming he would even want to go there.   You can't sign players when you're over the cap other than minimums and exceptions. The only way you can go over the cap is with bird rights.  Which is why there's been rumors/whispers of the Warriors signing Kevin Durant so he gets his max contract and security, and then trading him to where he wants. Otherwise he walks for nothing and the Warriors are still capped out and cannot replace him. And why the Warriors are in the business of buying draft picks, they need cheap talent on rookie contracts/minimums."
"Naw you see, the Globalist keyed in on Joe Lacob and forced Kevin Durant to play. They told him, in their bloodsucking vampire language, the blood of millions will pour unless Kevin Durant plays."
Was Kevin Durant erased from people's memory. There are others as well...
"And he admitted Durant took offense when he asked about free agency and got in his feelings over it ""we don't talk about that stuff"". [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-refused-tell-kendrick-perkins-about-free-agency-plans](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-refused-tell-kendrick-perkins-about-free-agency-plans)"
Or Warriors traded Kevin Durant+Iggy+Looney+Bell+Cook for D'Angelo Russell
"It really is ridiculous, as a neutral fan I think they have both made some good additions. Boston's being addition through subtraction and hopefully gaining some chemistry to their team again. Alternatively, Brooklyn have signed a good big in DeAndre Jordan, a solid bench piece in Garrett Temple and obviously two All-NBA calibre players in Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Jackie McMullan, who is a respected Celtic's insider, posted an article about the locker room problems and it goes well beyond Kyrie."
"Kevin Durant is not Kobe Bryant btw, also Kobe Bryant has never been close to sniffing a triple double average  Durant is 7 feet tall, one of the best shooters all time, his game is is going to be fine."
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-rumors-kevin-durant-felt-distant-second-fiddle-steph-curry?cid=Yahoo&amp;partner=ya4nbcs   as you were saying??
kevin durant and kyrie would made for each other  proof: I'm watching the History channel in the club and I'm wondering how do these people kno what's goin on on the sun..ain't nobody ever been
I don't know. Basically buying rings isn't as great as earning them. One of the best things about winning rings are the sacrifices and failures they make to get them. Kevin Durant took the easy way out - he couldn't lose his virginity so he bought   a prostitute.
**~~A source close to Kevin Durant~~** **Kevin Durant in a top hat and monocle said: “All (the drama) showed a lack of respect for one of the greatest players to put that uniform on and the fact that he took all that abuse and still put his career on the line to help them win.”**

Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to the Nets
"I define at as someone you can build a decent playoff team around. It's kind of a nebulous definition, but here's my list:   - LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic"
"Kevin ""10-ply"" Durant"
lmao the note passing game is gonna be on point. do you think kd is practicing signing his name kevin irvin or is kyrie practicing kyrie durant (or both)
kyrie just been reading Lacan and using it to manipulate Kevin Durant with this ego-game we play with ourselves
Kevin Durant demands a trade to a team NOT with Kyrie Irving!
"honestly dead serious, is Kevin Durant the softest athlete of all time? I mean this from the view point of him being arguably a top 5 talent in the history of basketball. He has to be the softest athlete in any sport ever based off his skill and success right?"
Going in with ambitions to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving makes this an L. It's a decent backup plan but still an L.
"Lebron James:  super team after super team after super team  Warriors: draft steph, klay and draymond- sign kevin durant   You: fUCk tHe WArRiOrs"
"wait, Kevin Durant felt disrespected by the warriors? Does he know how he disrespected the league by joining a 73 win team? Though, that's really shitty on the warriors part. Fuck man, they fucked up KD and Iggy?"
"I wish you guys respect my decision while seeking the truth.I MEAN, PLEASE respect Kevin Durant’s decision to join Brooklyn Bets. This is not Kevin Durant btw"
What the fuck does that mean Kevin Durant
"[Spears] A source close to Kevin Durant said: “All (the drama) showed a lack of respect for one of the greatest players to put that uniform on and the fact that he took all that abuse and still put his career on the line to help them win.”   Yeah, Durant is totally a great guy... Dumbass"

We're not recruiting Kevin Durant
So Kevin Durant wasn't friends with Steph Curry
"Not any player. Kevin Durant. He's one of the most powerful players in NBA history. If you think Kevin Durant was either forced or coerced into playing in the NBA Finals, you're not giving him enough credit. Stop infantilizing him."

I'll take 'Thing Kevin Durant Didn't Say for $1000' Alez
What the fuck does that even mean Kevin Durant
"Does not measure up eh? How does a Dominique Wilkins sound to you? I dont care if its a 2% chance he comes back to full form. By being the dumbass he is, Nolan has reduced your chances of being relevant over the next decade to 0. You’re not the LA fucking Lakers, theres not a sea of superstars just waiting to walk into your door. You’re the fucking New York Knicks. You’re never going to sniff a chance at a superstar for at least the next decade. Wake up. Signing a one legged Kevin Durant with fish-like amnesia gives you better odds at a title than whatever else your incompetent owner has planned for you."
"Okay well. I will say this, if you want to be more current. In the present day, the Brooklyn Nets, with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are more relevant than the Clippers.   The New Jersey Nets without a doubt throughout history are more relevant than the Clippers.  This conversation has gone elsewhere though, which is my fault lol."
"Injured forward Kevin Durant yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Joe Harris gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Spencer Dinwiddie yelled out, “We got an [expletive] cult now.” And before Kyrie opened his third eye, former Nets part-owner Jay Z hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”"
This is a no brainier. Kyrie is a better player than Russell. Kevin Durant is arguably the best player in the NBA at his best and if he's only 80 percent when he gets healthy that's still better than almost all of the NBA.
"Clippers have been more relevant maybe last like 7ish years? But i mean look at their history lol. They are in no way more relevant as a whole than the Nets. Like it’s not even really close. Actually, i’d go even further and say the Clippers historically may literally be THE most irrelevant team in the NBA, and that’s no shade at all, I like Ballmer and Doc and everything, but that’s just how bad the Clippers have been, and how weak of a brand they had before lob city.  Plus i mean, the Nets just got Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, the Clippers have...Pat Beverly and Lou Williams.  But like you said we’ll see"
"You're claim that he's likely to come back at an elite level just does not measure up to the history of players dealing with Achilles tears. There's obviously a high-reward payoff if he beats the odds, but those are long odds. I'd rather just let our young players develop and build a team from the bottom up than bet our future on a 33 year old Kevin Durant full recovering from the worst injury in basketball"
"If you're bullish on a stock strictly because of prior success, you're an absolute moron who shouldn't be investing.    &gt; BTIG’s Ross and Imperial Capital analyst David Miller have highlighted that the ability for the Knicks to fill seats and be must-watch television with All-World players like Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving would help boost advertising revenue for MSG’s flagship network and its MSG+ offerings. However, the same probably can’t be said for the haul of Randle and Portis, who haven’t started in a playoff game in their young careers.  This is the important part.  I haven't seen an analyst say that MSG will go down.  They are just saying that there is no reason to expect the performance we've seen out of the stock when they cannot even lock down a big name free agent.  That ""May Pressure MSG stock."""
That source: Kevin Durant
"If you're not utilizing a player's full skill set but you're still winning games what does it matter?  The average height for a shooting guard in the NBA is 6'5"", D'Lo is 6'5"". Also he's a career average 35% 3 point shooter and had a career shooting year. He can play the position just fine. The fit is not absolutely perfect like having Kevin Durant was but the Warriors can make it work."
That's why is sucks. He doesn't need the money and can live whereve he wants. Kevin Garnett played for Minnesota and Boston and had a house in Malibu.   Durant is a snake and kinda shitty. But it's not all his fault. Draymond Green is a classless act
"[""De'Angelo Russell does not fit there whatsoever. They just did not want to see Kevin Durant walk out the door with no compensation. ... They will trade him. It's just a matter of when."" - @TheSteinLine on @dpshow ](https://twitter.com/andrewperloff/status/1145703135324729346?s=21)"
"I'm confused. What would we revisit?  It is my understanding that in both scenarios, kevin looney was unlikely to be signed because he will make too much money. However, with aqurring dlo through an S&amp;T, the warriors now have 13 mil up against a hard cap to sign 6 or 7 players to fill out the roster. Previously, they could spend as much ss they wanted on looney using bird rights, and just have a big tax bill.  Now, they can only offer these 6ish players 13mil total in terms of thevfirst year of the contract. Maybe they sign him for a bigish portion of that. Maybe they decide not to. I trust the FO of GSW either way. But Durant leaving in an S&amp;T rather than resigning or leaving in FA made it harder for the warriors to sign looney. They might still do so. Who knows what they will do. , But can u explain which part of that will be revisited? I'm not making claims on what they will do. I have no idea whst they will do. Just that they are in a slightly more difficult position with the hardcap than just the tax. Why am i downvoted?"
Especially if its Kevin Durant
Have you heard of Kevin Durant? Lebron James? Guys that had a lot of success but couldn’t get over the final hurdle and bolted.
If they signed both Klay and Kevin yes it can   https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-durant-klay-thompson-nba-warriors-luxury-tax-free-agents-2019-6
Kevin Durant and Kyrie negotiates with the Nets before free agency to take a pay cut to pay DJ and this person crying about a non-laker employee talking to Kawhi
"AND ON THE DAY THE BROOKLYN NETS SIGNED KEVIN DURANT.. THE KNICKS COME OUT  ""We have reached an agreement with.. Julius Randle"""
Kevin Durant...
"Imagine dumping Porzingis to get cap space, then missing out on Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis, and pretty much any other max FA, and trying to spin that positively  Honestly, i'm impressed"
It was also really weird to me when he said he was personally texting Kevin Durant for hours and days  and KD called him out on it so Broussard said he’ll show the messages and it was just sporadic DMs on IG and he tried playing it off as it being the same thing. Just constant clownery from him.
"Obviously he’s not Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant but I think that was a great pick up in a vacuum. But then just when I think the Knicks might start getting competent, they sign two of their power forwards 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
"Kyrie goes to BOS to play with Gordon Hayward to and “dominate,” yet Hayward had ZERO impact on Kyrie and without him, the Celts were unlikeable in Kyries eyes, and he left.  Kyrie goes to BRK to play with Kevin Durant and to “doninate,” yet Durant has ZERO impact on Kyrie this year, and without him the Nets will likely miss the playoffs, or scurry in as a 7-8 seed.  This abomination of a “duo” is going to hit a major WALL of reality. KD had to be wooed and convinced to come to Brooklyn. They’ll be disbanded by 2022."
why would you not take kevin durant over julius randle and bobby portis
Who needs Kevin Durant when you can have Reggie bullock
"Bob Myers also flew to New York from the west coast. But he wasn’t going to pitch Kevin Durant on why he should stay with the Warriors, it was already too late. Bob’s trip will be documented in history books as the “reverse trail of tears.”"
"Yeah, everyone who rips on the knicks for this hasn’t watched any games and doesn’t even know we’re obsessed with Mitchell Robinson and actually think kevin Knox can be good.  We’re rebuilding the right way, and I think Durant and kyrie are both grumpy weirdos who would poison fiz’s young culture.  And if I’m delusional, whatever.  I’d rather watch young players drafted by the knicks grow than some rent-a-team fail with injuries and shitty attitudes"
" Hot take, 23 year old replacement all star not as good as Kevin Durant."
" What are you actually diagreeing dude?  Were you at the front office when KD and Knicks both agreed this was the best?  ""The Knicks and owner Jim Dolan were not prepared to offer Kevin Durant a full max contract due to concerns over his recovery from the Achilles injury, league sources tell me and [@wojespn](https://twitter.com/wojespn). Knicks officials are in Los Angeles tonight, meeting with free agents such as Julius Randle."""
Kevin Durant...
"ARE YOU ON DRUGS???? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KEVIN DURANT HERE PEOPLE!!! THE MAN CAN WALK, I SAID THE MAN CAN WALK, WALK OUT ON HIS KNEES AND GET BUCKETS OVER CATS!!! IF THERE WAS EVER A PLAYER WHO DIDN'T NEED NO DAMN ACHILLES TENDON IT'S KEVIN (whatever KD's middle name is) DURANT!!!"
why in fuck kevin durant goes to brooklyn tankers....  dangelo russell is one of shittest draftbusts ever. gonna be 3.choice pointguard at gsw warriors..
"If the Knicks maxed him and he came back looking like a shell of himself then literally everyone saying ""80% oF kEvIn DuRaNt"" right now would lolknicks and talk about how stupid they were to not pay attention to the history of guys coming back from this sorta injury.  I don't particularly believe that Dolan balked at maxing KD, my guess is he's saving face. But tbh I was 50/50 on it myself. On the one hand I don't think he's ever gonna be the same player and thus wouldn't ultimately get us anywhere. But I also don't think the guys we sign in his place are gonna get us anywhere so the next few years are a wash anyway (unless Randle takes some major steps I guess)."
"Few key attributes to be a Deng/Mosgov  * needs to be long enough and crippling enough that it hangs like an albatross for years. So 2 year deals like for Rudy Gay or JJ Redick are out  * should be a high risk move (due to age, injury, or performance concerns) with low ceiling (even if it works out okay it doesn’t really help much. Like what were Deng or Mozgov going to do for the Lakers even if they were playable? So signings like Kevin Durant are out because even if it ends up being a disaster, the upside to justify the gamble was there  * you’re not sure who the team was even bidding against for the player  With those qualifications in mind I’d like to nominate Harrison Barnes for this award. He’s 27, so it’s not quite as bad. But was there really a huge market for a 13/5/1 player who has maxed out in terms of progression? I feel like him eating 20% of their cap space every year is something they’ll regret as soon as next year."
"In this instance, I'd take square one again if it didnt work out. This is a different kind of gamble, its KD. Its not like you're mortgaging the future for Demar Derozen or someone. I'm a Bills and Sabres fan, so I'm looking at it from that perspective. As a long suffering fan base, if you finally have a chance to even maybe be one of the marquee teams in the league I'd take it all day long. Even a 20% chance KD returns healthy is worth it (obviously only my opinion). Are Frank Ntilikina, Kevin Knox and DSJ really worth getting too worked up about not seeing if they can become a great team. You'll be able to draft a comparable trio of players 4-6 years from now. Durant is the biggest shot you can take, it would be a wild ride, it would be fun, there'd be hope at least.  This coming season, youd have RJ and being obscenely excited for next year. The season after, even if KD struggled all season long, youd be able to tell yourself after another offseason to train and recover, hes gonna be back to 100%. Then you have that third season where reality wouldnt start to set in until halfway through the year (assuming he never gets back to 100%, just for this discussion). So worst case, the fun doesn't start to wear off until the end of the contract and by that point if you need to move on, you move on. And this is all assuming hed be able to recruit another star, so they'd have that going for them too. For a lot of NBA teams, the risk might not be worth it. For Knicks fans, it probably wouldve been. Theres very few times in your teams history you're gonna be able to sign one of the best players of the time. The guys they signed, the young players they have..  that's *ok*. If I was a Knicks fan, I'd just be more than willing to be like that car on the highway meme and see where KD, RJ, another pick next year and another star (maybe) get me.   I dont think theres really any right or wrong answer. Who knows if he even wouldve signed there. And Knicks fans have always wanted a smarter more patient front office. But theres also a chance for one of the more entertaining 3-5 year stretches in NYK history. I would've taken the gamble because how often do chances like these come around, but that's only me and I'm not even a NYK fan. Idk. Its interesting to think of the possibilities. And maybe I'm looking at it with rose colored glasses on, because the NBA was really fun when the Knicks were good (not like it's not fun now) and it's been so long since they were. Thinking about the playoff crowds, the national games, the big moments. I live in WNY so Knicks games are on the same network as the Sabres so maybe I'm not totally impartial."
Imagine waking up thinking your team was about to sign Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving and then they fucking sign Julius Randle LMAO
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"You know this how...? And as if Steph doesn't get a say whether he wants to be on or off ball. He transitioned more offball in the past few years to accommodate Kevin Durant, a top 15 all time player. He's not going to give primary ballhandling duties when he's in his prime to a 23 year old D'Angelo Russell.  D'Lo will be the secondary handler and probably lead the 2nd units, but there is no way he's handling it more than Steph when they're on the floor together."
..shhhh! You had me at kevin durant is an idiot!
"I think that can change though. The thing is, NY will never be a Mets town, LA will never be a Clippers town, etc. But the Nets have a real shot. You know what keeps the Yankees and Lakers as the top teams? Past players, accolades, and fame. The Lakers and Yankees are iconic in the mainstream, but the Knicks really arent on that level. They have some fame, but not on the level of those teams.  Lakers have 16 titles, Magic, Kobe, Shaq, etc. Clippers have 0 titles, Bill Walton, and Blake Griffin.   Its different in NY though. The Knicks have 2 titles(both of which were a long time ago), Walt Frazier, Patrick Ewing, and Melo. The Nets have 0 titles, Julius Erving, Jason Kidd, and now Kevin Durant. Those two arent as different as the other big city gaps. Also as someone from NY, I know more Nets fans than I do Knicks fans. The Nets are certainly on the up"
No an Achilles injury did not cost Kevin Durant 30million. Please do some homework. Specifically on supermax.
"It was said they would only trade capela to get a pick to trade for butler. Meanwhile they showed last year in the playoffs that they remained the second best team in the West. And the best team just got a lot worse (although I think the dubs still make the finals). That jazz team is deep but the one thing it really lacks is James harden. Most times out of ten the best player’s team wins in the playoffs unless the other team has both steph curry and Kevin Durant. I don’t worry about the Jazz in the playoffs, I do worry about the rockets."
I threw Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry on this list simply because I was curious.
"I just don't know how you justify remaining a knicks fan for the remainder of the Dolan era after this. The last few years of moves were all to sign kd. U run the previous superstar carmelo out of town, you alienate the young superstar in porzingis and get rid of him for nothing. And then you dont even try to offer kevin fucking Durant, a top 3 player in the league, a max deal, showing all other free agents of the league that Knicks are a bad place to go.  This is seriously boycott worthy imo and borderline sabotage"
Kevin Durant is AT LEAST top 3
"If the reports of knicks not even offering max to KD are true, that looks horrible to free agents. If kevin fucking durant, injury or no injury, isnt enough for the knicks FO to offer a max deal, no free agent is gonna want to sign with that"
Kevin durant for dlo?
"If Kawhi does go there, I'd say they have a good chance to win next year. The year after could be trickier because LeBron will be 36 and plenty of other teams will have improved (Milwaukee, Sixers, Nets with Kevin Durant coming back, etc)  So if I had to bet, I'd say probably one"
"Kawhi: ""Ayyy what it do Babbbyyyyyy""  Kevin: ""Wait, who-""  Kawhi: ""I'm a fun guy!""  (Silence)  Kawhi: ""Ahah, you in?""  Kevin: ""in what?""  (Durant hangs up phone)"
I know everyone is countering the Knicks being overly cautious with KD being an all world talent and his game being a jump shooter with his wingspan etc...but the Achilles injury is absolutely a career ENDER for basketball players. I ruptured my Achilles at 22 and for like 2 years after rehabbing I still felt like I had a cement block tied to my foot.  It’s likely he’s so skilled and talented that he can perform well offensively...but look at how it will effect him from a rebounding and defensive standpoint.   If you bet on anyone returning your max contract it’s definitely Kevin Durant but I don’t think it’s likely we are going to see a resurrection of any sorts. If his recovery goes wrong in any way we can potentially be looking at 4 years of hamstringing that entire franchise.
Tomorrow’s headline: did Kevin Durant purposely tear his Achilles to avoid playing for the Knicks?
Knicks fans: Can we get Kevin Durant?  Knicks: we have Kevin Durant at home  &amp;#x200B;  Kevin durant at home:  Julius Randle
At home screaming about how we have Kevin Durant
"I'm not entirely sure that KD can return to his near-MVP level play, but who knows, Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant."
It's almost gonna be 40m... https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/kevin-durant-2717/
Think about how much additional revenue Kevin Durant brings to a team. These guys are entertainers and we all willingly pay to watch them play. They deserver every penny.
"&gt; And? LeBron might be 35 but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s a top 5 player. If Kawhi goes to the Lakers next year, they are guaranteed a couple of rings. That makes it a weak move.  Nothing is 'guaranteed'.  And again, Lebron isn't going to be around forever and has already declined.   &gt;He proved he can beat a depleted a Warriors team. Fuck, even with KD out, the Warriors were gonna take them to 7 before KD got injured. A fully healthy GSW would have beaten the Raptors in five at most.  And don’t tell me about Kawhi being the man on that all-time great Spurs team.  Blah blah. KD joined a team that had won the most regular season games OF ALL TIME and WON A CHAMPIONSHIP WITHOUT HIM.   Now you're shitting on Kawhi's accomplished despite him proving he could win without a top player, unlike Kevin Durant  &gt;Yep you’re dense. Just ignore the fact that over the past 6 seasons, they didn’t have LeBron for five of them, and he was injured last season.  Lebron played 55 games last season and they missed the playoffs. Lottery team   &gt;And they got Anthony Davis.  After trading most of their team for him.   You're a fucking idiot if you're acting like the Lakers already won the title when they don't even enough to players on the roster to even play a game."
You’re literally insane if you’d rather have RJ Barrett and Julius Randle over Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant lmao
"Kevin Durant - Goal Keeper. Incredible length, plus pretty quick."
It would be like Kevin Durant going to the Warriors with Steph and Klay.
A Ben Simmons .  B Kevin Durant
"&gt; With Kevin freaking Durant on the team, opponents would double Curry instead of KD.   This is a bullshit narrative that Steph fans has created to give credit to him. Both of them got consistently doubled. Go watch KD’s 2017 highlights and you would see Kylie leaving Steph wide open to go and try and stop KD from driving to the rim"
"Something like Curry, Harden, and Giannis. Each one of them needs to be capable of carrying an offense for stretches at a time, something like 16 minutes a game or so. Everyone should be a playmaker, so goodbye Kawhi. They need to be able to score independently, but also be off-ball threats - Westbrook is out of the picture. And they need to have stamina, which is why I'm discounting LeBron for this, since he'll be 36 years old at the tail end of his contract. Anyone seriously injured is also out of the picture, namely Kevin Durant. Davis isn't an unreasonable pick as a big man, but Giannis is more of a playmaker, and good playmaking is always at a premium. Moreover, he already has surprisingly good chemistry with Curry. Harden is a no-brainer to pick, since he's the MVP runner-up and just put up a 35 ppg season."
*The World after July 4th 2016*   ‘How does Kevin Durant sleep at night?’
"Lol it’s easy to predict? Yeah everyone saw the clippers getting Kawhi Leonard and PG13 a couple months ago. Shit it was obvious Kevin Durant was gonna blow out his Achilles and Klay Thompson was gonna get hurt too. And everyone knew CP3 was gonna be carrying the thunder in 19-20! Damn, I almost forgot to mention how obvious it was that the PELICANS were going to win the first pick. So predictable"
Damn the ticker said Kevin Durant had 51 pts that day  Now I’m sad
"It's pretty disingenuous of NBA.com to lead the article by saying that: ""LeBron James and Kevin Durant scored at a gargantuan rate, with both players combining for 38,995 points (That's more than the career point total of James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard combined).""   Harden is less than a thousand points under both of them (LeBron: 19,550; KD 19,445; Harden: 18,627). Neither Kyrie nor Kawhi are in the top 10."
"Don’t know about all time, but more recently, the top 5 guys who have been unquestioned in league wide and fan-wide respect have been:   1) Carmelo Anthony  2) Kevin Durant  3) Russ Westbrook  4) Draymond Green  5) Demarcus Cousins"
"1. LeBron James (19,550)   2. Kevin Durant (19,445)   3. James Harden (18,627  Chances Harden overtakes Bron before the end of the decade?"
"I think that you are incorrect.   Curry really does do things on offense that nobody has ever seen.   With Kevin freaking Durant on the team, opponents would double Curry instead of KD.  KD is one of the greatest scorers ever, and the Klay was sitting over there on the 3pt line or slashing to the basket....and the opponent would be doubling Curry.    I don't know what else could be better evidence than that.  His offense just wrecks an opposing team like nothing I've ever seen.   The closest I can compare him with is Barry Bonds at his height, when he was getting intentionally walked with the bases loaded. That's how it has been with Curry."
4 game sample sizes heavily mess up net rating numbers. Let's actually look at 3 seasons worth of data instead: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/05/12/stephen-curry-not-kevin-durant-is-the-golden-state-warriors-best-player/#4ad54f957b23  Pretty big difference if you ask me.
"https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146560882178056192  &gt; The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561014424621064  &gt; The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561112772685825  &gt; The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561386228719618  &gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561874684760069  &gt; Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561986936889344  &gt; The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562326730092544  &gt; The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562923239759872  &gt; And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146563484961910784  &gt; For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!"
"Who’s the center? They got two guards, 3 forwards on that 1st team. Here’s my teams going by position:  PG: Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant SF: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George PF: LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Blake Griffin C: Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis, Pau Gasol"
Kevin Durant
"KD is 7 foot. Back then positions mattered. Theres a reason Kevin Garnett didnt want to be listed as a 7 footer. He would have had to guard other 7 foot players.   &gt;  he would drop 50 on every one of them from the 3 point then  Bro legit question, have you ever played competitive basketball? Do you know how tired you get when someone else is just bodying you in the post? Playing defense alone gets you tired. That's why theres not to many 2 way elite players. Asking Durant to defend those all time great bigs along with ""dropping 50 on every one of them from the 3 point"" is going to get him injured.   And Kevin Durant has only scored 50+ in a game like 6 times."
"Just out of curiosity, I summed up the cumulative MVP shares over the past 10 seasons:  -  **1st Team:**  1\. LeBron James (5.979)  2\. James Harden (3.291)  3\. Kevin Durant (3.209)  4\. Stephen Curry (2.206)  5\. Russell Westbrook (1.614)  -  **2nd Team:**  6\. Kobe Bryant (1.284)  7\. Giannis Antetokounmpo (1.013)  8\. Kawhi Leonard (0.993)  9\. Derrick Rose (0.981)  10\.

Answer my first question and then answer this one. If both Kevin Durant and John wall both came back the same way Kobe did and was as mobile as he was post Achilles injury. Tell me why Kevin Durants height wouldn’t have the advantage when it comes to shooting contested jumpers? Does that make it simple enough for your dumbass?
Kevin durant threw the 2016 wcf and already had made a commitment to the warriors. .
"1. 2008-09 LeBron James 2. 1990-91 Michael Jordan 3. 1985-86 Larry Bird 4. 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal 5. 1993-94 Hakeem Olajuwon 6. 2015-16 Stephen Curry 7. 1989-90 Magic Johnson 8. 2013-14 Kevin Durant 9. 2003-04 Kevin Garnett  I selected Garnett because I wanted a more balanced player over someone like Wilt/Kareem. Garnett is a more capable distributor than them and his scoring is at worst not far off when you account for pace and minutes and era and I believe he was defensively superior peak for peak. He has the record for most wins added in a season which is a more modern version of winshares that includes the postseason.  He won MVP that season in a landslide and led an average supporting cast to the WCF where his best teammate by far got injured and they still took 2 off Shaq &amp; Kobe Lakers. I didn’t want to select Kobe because his offense and defense didn’t peak at the same time like Garnett (the Lakers were significantly better defensively without Kobe on the court in 2005-06). Garnett and Duncan were really close but I went with Garnett because he was slightly better statistically along with personal preference and also the fact I was representing Minnesota with the 9th pick.  It is also worth considering that PFs are much more valuables that centers and point guards in this due to the lack of depth at that position. This also explains why Bird and Durant may have gone higher than expected, because SF is relatively thin as well."
"Everything comes to an end. Popovich had in the past said he would quit when Duncan quits. He did not. The Spurs quite normally would be the franchise to take over dominance from the Warriors now, with Kawhi and some rising young stars that would join if Kawhi were here.  Instead, the franchise drove Kawhi out. Popovich himself said  Tony Parker's injury was far worse... he'd  never seen anything like Kawhi's injury.. He did that shortly after the Zaza Pachulia injury in the playoffs, early in the next season, in Nov. 2017.   Some fans then went after Kawhi, the whole season, with ""kawhi is a traitor, unloyal, soft b.tch, burn his jersey...""  Popovich was not a medical expert to make that ""medical evaluation"" for what was happening inside Kawhi's body, nor was he entitled to announce it.  Real medical experts had still not cleared Kawhi to play as of 4 months after Popovich's evaluation.  It's interesting to note that, meanwhile, the Spurs franchise conveniently avoided paying Kawhi the max or near-max money that he earned by virtue of the CBA Agreement... The fans had the impression that Kawhi quit on the franchise. The truth was the opposite, the franchise quit on Kawhi.     Popovich kept his old players around too long. While this Kawhi-bashing campaign was going on, Tony Parker was being paid $15 m/yr, and Pau Gasol $16.5 m/yr. Parker was among two worst players on the roster, statistically, in every one of his last four years. And he most likely was expecting to sign a new contract. Gasol was inefficient.   The franchise paid those players but did not want to pay Kawhi.  There is every evidence to prove that Kawhi was willing to stay, getting the max money. But he was not paid, and plus he was faced with a campaign to destroy his name, dignity, his career.  At one point, I believe, he might have said to himself ""I want out of here, I don't want anything from these people, I want to go home, to the culture I'll be happy living in..""  To be able to say all the above, you only need to be aware of and consciencious of basic human rights, rights of the individual.  It's a cardinal rule of sports, of sportsmanship: you believe when an athlete says he is not healed, he is still injured. You don't go out to publicly call him out. And you don't only watch when the fan body is destroying the athlete the whole year calling him the unloyal traitor, thief for stealing the salary.  Tbe fans who say that must remember that Kawhi was giving that franchise the NBA finals MVP when he was on a rookie contract. And, you don't play when you are unhealthy.  Spurs doctor misdiagnosed Kawhi's tendon injury. Had Kawhi accepted to play when franchise-paid doctor cleared him, he was going to end up another Isaiah Thomas, or Kevin Durant who could not say no when he was cleared by franchise doctor.. The Spurs fans will be happy if they can make the playoffs at seventh or eight.  They must have been the contenders.  Popovich was supposed to create, from young players, the starting five that would be ready to contend now.  However, the last player he truly raised is Kawhi, who joined 8 years ago."
"Then why did he? Its kevin fucking durant. If ik the coach and i can get fucking 36 every night from him, i would."
"Cavs were better in 2017 than in 2016, as they became a better team. However, GSW added Kevin Durant to their team and lost role player, but still were able to keep the greatest shooter of all time, another one of the goat shooters, a DPOY and a former all star/all defensive finals mvp. Unless GSW had injuries like this year they win no matter what. If GSW were healthy this year, they win in 5 tops."
&gt;Every player is on PED's in the NBA lol.   I hate this line of thinking so much.   Kevin Durant is on PEDs?
Because the 73-9 Warriors added Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is one of the most unselfish basketball players in history. He sacrificed his own reputation to play team ball by leaving OKC
"That’s crazy talk. How the fuck can a player win league MVP over guys like Lebron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard without being a “bona fide first option”? I don’t particularly like Russ, but the hate he gets here sometimes is outlandish."
Kevin Durant is still a virgin and plans to save it until marriage.
"You mean Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard? Lmfao didn’t know Billups was in the same breath as those two. Also so which is it, Iggy deserved finals MVP or did he not? Y’all need to make up your mind."
Before kevin durant joined the warriors and got all the open loooks and lanes he was a 57%ts guy in the playoffs.
"of course he's always been good..  but he has often disappointed without kevin durant on his team. disappointed relative to the immense expectations placed upon him due to his status as an all-time great, of course."
"I mean chris Paul has played in 82% of his regular season games, steph curry has played in 85% is he injury prone too?  At what point are you considered injury prone?  Nurkic first year 13 DNP coach decision, 19 DNP 2nd season, 3rd season 9 DNP, all coach decision  There is a difference between being inactive and not playing.  I will educate you since you like to talk about stuff you know nothing about.  Since joining the blazers out of a possible 186 games, he has missed 19 games, in the same time span Kevin Durant has missed more games than nurkic.  So Kevin Durant is also injury prone  TIL You are injury prone if you have 30+ DNPs in your first 3 seasons and break your entire leg and miss 9 out of the 19 games since joining the blazers"
Kevin Durant did the right thing in joining the Warriors
"Very simple. I'll lay it out for ya. This list is the greatest FT shooters in volume/efficiency.  #1: Dirk Nowitzki - 7,240 at 87.9%  #2: Reggie Miller - 6,238 at 88.8%  #3: Kevin Durant - 5,742 at 88.3%  #4: Chauncey Billups - 4,496 at 89.4%  #5: Ray Allen - 4,398 at 89.4%  #6: Larry Bird - 3,960 at 88.6%  #7: Rick Barry - 3,818 at 90.0%  #8: Calvin Murphy - 3,445 at 89.2%  #9: Steve Nash - 3,060 at 90.4%  #10: Steph Curry - 2,534 at 90.5%   &amp;nbsp;  As you can clearly see, Steph Curry does not compare in a combination of Volume/Efficiency in comparison to the likes of Dirk, Reggie, and Durant, among others."
"&gt; They both have plenty of volume.  Oof. Imagine thinking 2,500 FTM is anywhere near comparable to 7,240.  Going further, Reggie Miller, Chauncey Billups, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird, and Rick Barry are also all superior FT shooters to Curry in volume/efficiency."
Kevin Durant is 30.  Dirk is 41.
All NBA players use it except Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram.
"In 2017, Kawhi Leonard &amp; Kevin Durant were more deserving of that MVP than Russ or Harden"
Kevin Durant needs to replace Paul George and you have an unbeatable team of   Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant   Kawhi Leonard   LeBron James   Anthony Davis   This team has everything
&gt;6. Kevin Durant  😘
Imagine benching a healthy Kevin Durant
"I like it, Kevin Durant needs to be higher tho"
"I think the clippers would win this series in 6. You’re forgetting the Clippers have Montrez and Lou Williams off the bench as well, hell even Shamet is better than most GSW bench players. Refs allow players to play more physical defense on Steph in the playoffs as well, in this case that would be horrible with the defensive players on the Clippers. But the biggest thing will be the absence of Kevin Durant, who served as a walking 7ft bailout the last 3 years."
"I disagree. D’Lo will never come close to the type of player that Kyrie is.  Also, Kyrie got the Nets Kevin Durant. Durant wouldn’t have gone to the Nets without Kyrie. Kyrie + Durant over D’Lo is a no brainer."
"He was the best NCAA player, as a freshman.  3rd to win the Naismith award along with Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant. What skills do those players have?"
"Everyone except Harden you dummy.   [Specifically, Wright noted that while Harden is guarding Kevin Durant, Durant is shooting just 32%, compared to the 50% he’s shooting when guarded by any other Rockets player.](https://clutchpoints.com/rockets-news-nick-wright-details-james-hardens-defensive-numbers-vs-kevin-durant/amp/)"
"Warriors 2016 death &gt; 2017 Hamptons.  Draymond as a scoring threat is a bigger difference than the upgrade from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant.  Also, minor regression from the unanimous MVP."
Kevin Durant is the benchmark. He's been the best playoffs player the last 3 seasons.
"TOV% doesn't account for assists in terms of possessions ""used"" so it underrates passers. (  However, this is definitely an underrated aspect of MJ's game (and Kobe/T-Mac/Dirk as well), a good turnover economy has a high correlation with elite offense. People who only look at scoring efficiency and ignore turnover rate tend to overrate players like Kevin Durant in terms of offensive impact."
"That game winner over Dallas, Three over LeBron (should've happened twice but I guess Steph had the greatest screen in NBA history 🙄), and the *""I'm Kevin Durant""* game"
Kevin Durant seems like a cool guy
Kevin Durant is not a snake. He only looked after what's best for his career.
"Game 3 2017, Game 3 2018, “I’m Kevin Durant”"
Lol “lead” as if he doesn’t habe Kevin fucking durant
"Probably will do, like he did with Kevin Durant.   I think this might work for a period of time until LeBron decides to go in the post.    He’s been vulnerable in the past to small but strong defender being good on him"
20PPG as the main guy on a team that made the playoffs.  Context definitely *is* everything.  Another nice bit of context is that even Kevin Durant got more open looks playing alongside Curry. It's kind of silly to think DLo's efficiency won't improve playing alongside Steph - especially because Curry can mentor him.
"Crawford could still come in at the end of a game when you’re subbing D for offense and create his own shot. That’s worth something.   Plus he’s a professional and apparently a great locker room guy. It’s good to have one of those on a young team sometimes. Like when the Thunder signed old ass Kevin Ollie (who went on to become a good college coach) to help show Durant and Westbrook how to be professionals. Intangibles. Crawford could definitely be a valuable 14th, 15th man.  And I haven’t been following Lin enough the last couple years to have an opinion."
okay the question im about to ask you is 100% serious  are you mentally disabled  are you literally comparing the warriors rotations **WITH KEVIN DURANT** to their future rotations **WITHOUT KEVIN DURANT**  i'll give you a chance to delete that comment because.. man that's just.. man. that's embarassing.
Not a single person except for maybe the Longhorns head coach was saying that KD should be going #1. No one knew KD was capable of putting on the strength he did without losing his athleticism. I’m stronger than KD was when he was drafted and I’m 5’9 145 pounds which was a HUGE concern for Kevin Durant come draft night.
“Fuck Kevin Durant” -Lil B in Fuck KD
"https://github.com/ledoux7/notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/forReddit.ipynb  League avg 18/19 season:  * fadeaway = 42.6% * 'Turnaround Fadeaway shot' = 44.1% * midrange zone = 40.2%   kevin durant:  * fadeaway = 55.6% * 'Turnaround Fadeaway shot' = 52.3%, 221 FGA * midrange zone = 55.09%, 461FGA"
"Not as bad as you think, but I did include a mention about him in the write-up:  &gt;Where's Kevin Durant? While I had him visually peeking over Spencer Dinwiddie's shoulder in the Nets' team, his stats aren't that overwhelming: (SPD = 6, 3PTS = 9, DUNK = 7, PASS = 5, POWER = 4, STEAL = 3, BLOCK = 7, CLTCH = 5 | NBA Jam Total = 46 | Raw Total = 49.5). He's probably worth a few additional points in either his dunking or clutch categories considering some of the plays he's had in his career, but it still wouldn't put him in that top overall category with the others. That being said, he would be worth an additional 12 team points over Dinwiddie when playing with Kyrie."
"Interesting coincidences:  The Nets currently have 3 Team USA 2016 players.  The Warriors had 3 Team USA 2016 players, maxed out at 5, had 6 at one time or another, and are down to 2.  All the best Raptors players in 2016 all played for team USA.  Nobody on Team USA 2016 has won an MVP since 2014. Nobody besides Kevin Durant has won an MVP, period. Notice that LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all sat this Olympics out."
"He's also not Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson. KD is one of the Top 3 scorers in NBA history and Thompson is the 2nd best shooter of all time, of course those guys are going to get maxed even when injured. Draymond is more of a Kyle Lowry type where his impact doesn't always translate into box score stats and those guys typically won't get maxed if they are injured."
"Kevin Durant said it best when he mentioned that he didnt wanna play side by side with LeBron but its not his fault. Its the media that follows LeBron. That shit's very toxic and hostile it could be downright depressing for a teammatr ""standing in LeBron's way"". Not much to gain if you win because most of the credit goes to LeBron anyways but if you lose the world is going to turn againat you to the point that you probably would never live it down."
"&gt;Today, Allen is remembered not for what he could do on the court — anchor a top-five defense, make six All-Defensive teams in seven years and guard superstars like Kevin Durant better than anyone else in the league — but what he couldn’t: shoot the basketball.  Who remembers him from that? What?"
If they don't want to accept that having Klay Thompson for the entire fourth quarter wouldn't have likely swung that game in the Warriors favor and gotten them the victory then they're the delusional ones. Might be the same people who said the Warriors are better without Kevin Durant.
He is basically Kevin Durant to be fair
"how exactly do you apply 'per capita' to basketball?  its almost like you have no idea what you are talking about.  nba players per capita?  that still doesn't account for lebron james, kevin durant, kawhi leonard, steph curry, klay thompson, dame lillard, anthony davis, paul george, etc...   maybe stick to watching soccer buddy"
Why are we talking about Tobias Harris offense like he’s Kevin Durant or something
Kevin Durant has a torn Achilles man
"The world would laugh at them at first. ""Haha! They're all twisted and weird, damn theyre so awkward!""  But in the 2020 NBA draft the Universoul Bone Breakers would be the first group of non basketball players to go in the top 5 consecutively. This would completely break the current system of excessive 3s and fast paced basketball, into the next era: the contortionist/gyration era. Over the next 25 years more and more flexible players would be drafted over traditional ""tall"" and ""athletic"" types. Legends such as ""Stringbean"" Samantha Andrews and Karen ""Triple Double Jointed"" Krawaski would be the first two women to break into the NBA, taking advantage of the new style of flexible play. The undoubted best player of this era will be Dentry ""Slithers"" Damton, a extremely snake-like player (physically with his movements, not in personality like Kevin Durant) that will out-contort any elite athlete or ballerina that the era throws at him. He will go on to win 9 MVPs and 11 MFPs (Most Flexible Player) before graduating to the BBA (basketball ballerina association) and winning a championship with the Miami Salsas against the Los Angeles Stretch in a double overtime encore performance that gets a 5 star review. Luckily the basketball aspects of the game will be eliminated in late 2045 with BBA commissioner Kevin Garnett leading the change. He was quoted as saying ""uhhhh, gotta get this! Uhhhhh!"""
So Kevin Durant?
"Fuck you, I’m Kevin Durant, I know more about Carmelo Anthony than everyone else on Reddit combined."
“Kevin Durant is surprisingly strong and well built”
"well if we doing this, I contend that in 2014 if Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving never got hurt, the Cavs would’ve won that series and Golden State never would’ve won a ring without Kevin Durant."
"    I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious     All smiles, Kevin Durant trials     Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'     I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles"
what do you say to the 95% of r/nba who says the Warriors win in 6 if Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson don't get hurt?
"Yeah we can play the what if game. What Zaza Pachulia didn’t cripple Kawhi sending him out early in the series that by all accounts was actually really close. Maybe Kevin Durant leaves ringless, and the team falls apart. Just seems like a bunch of bull shit to complain about injuries when you actually caused an injury of a serious contender for one of your rings.  That’s why I will never give a fuck about people complaining about GSW injuries. At least Toronto had ZERO part in any of GSW injuries while playing through their own in the play offs."
Golden State  PG - Stephen Curry/Baron Davis  SG - Klay Thompson/Jason Richardson  SF - Kevin Durant/Andre Iguodala  PF - Draymond Green/David Lee  C - Andrew Bogut/DeMarcus Cousins
Kevin Durant is good with all time players creating all time space for him. Got it
"The Warriors are a better organization, but that's not why they get less attention than Lebron. People simply care more about Lebron everyone's got an opinion on what he is doing and what he should be doing. Everyone is aware is he a generational freak so people can't stop talking about him and arguing about him passionately whether to praise or criticize him. He is a once in a lifetime talent the impact he can have on a basketball court is not believeable. The Warriors 4/5 all-star team should get more attention than any team all time, but they are not as special as Lebron the Warriors all-star team can be replicated again.  Steph could be criticized too if he had the spotlight James has on him. [Steph and the Warriors were smiling after Kevin Durant got injured in the Finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bml3aw/curry_on_kds_injury_we_all_looked_at_each_other/). I can't imagine the hate Lebron would have got if he was happy Kyrie Irving got injured in 2015."
No but that's what it takes to win. You have to be so competitive that you push yourself past your limits in order to defeat someone who wants to win as badly as you do because you have to push yourself further than your opponent to gain an advantage.  You think MJ's personality was healthy? He was a psychopath about winning. Remember Kobe's personality? He was always miserable never happy he was only happy after he won. Look at Chris Paul's personality. Draymond Green. Kevin Garnett.  Russell Westbrook. Kevin Durant said he didn't sleep before finals games in 2017. You think that's healthy?  Lebron in Miami was quite simply obsessed with winning that he could have been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Pat Riley told the Lakers they would never be happy while winning only afterwards.
"I'm not sure what you mean. Most players/coaches/gms first priority isn't winning rings either. They care about maximizing their money and job security. Rings are something only the top players care about and sacrifice for and the fans and media judge only the top players by rings we don't judge GM/coaches/role players by them.  Lebron is done letting rings run his life since he discovered rings aren't really a big deal why stress your whole life over them? It's not about the ring it's about the journey, winning with a team you like, with teammates you like, for the city you like.   Kevin Durant discovered this too do you think winning rings was his priority when he decided to leave Golden State? No it was other things like lifestyle and doing it his way. Same with Kawhi. Kawhi left a championship team, and literally said joining the Clippers is not about championships."

Is this the I’m Kevin Durant game ?
Kevin Durant is good at basketball. Got it.
"With that changing all these other teams around the NBA, it really makes you wonder what team Kevin Durant bitches out to join. Would it still be the Warriors?"

"Yes, some random fuckin redditor is less reliable than a doctor that is chosen to do surgery on guys like Brook Lopez and Kevin Durant.   Thanks for understanding my point."
"grabbed it from [this](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/11/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-news-recovery-history) SI article, but a little more digging shows you’re correct.    i will, however, still maintain my bigger point behind my mistake. when looking at some of the numbers pre-injury, Durant in two more seasons played than DW has either comparable or outright more miles on him across different aspects of the game (FGAs, TRBs, TASTs, TBLKs, TSTLs, etc.). this is despite them having equal usage rates when comparing KDs time in OKC with Niques time in Atlanta. in addition to, along with his cumulative minutes played per season dropping post-injury to totals not even surpassing that of his rookie year, Dom went from a reasonable bet for an ~80 game season to not reaching the figure again for the remainder of his career. Durant through his career hasn’t been as consistent as DW in his game count what with his small history of hiccups, but has still managed to hold a relatively high total minute count season by season regardless. and i have yet to even mention that KD started in the league when he was 19, while DW started at 23. KDs current age of near-31 has far more implications into the DWilkins comparison when you take this into account, and brings out real concerns on his future when taking the rest into consideration as well.    all of this is to say that while every achilles injury recovery isn’t going to be the same, KD without a doubt has wear on his body that is comparable to and in some cases exceeds Dom. making the recovery comparison isn’t only disingenuous because of the nature of such an injury or the amount of miles they’ve seen on the court or even the different organizations they’ve been a part of, but also because they’ve seen two different careers arcs entirely."
"figured out where you incorrectly got age 21.  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/11/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-news-recovery-history  &gt; Dominique Wilkins  &gt; Injured: January 1992, age 21  but it's impossible that he was 21 in 1992 because he was born in 1960.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wilkido01.html  &gt; Born: January 12, 1960  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Wilkins  &gt; January 12, 1960  so he would be 32 in 1992.  https://in.nba.com/news/nba-finals-2019-notable-players-who-have-returned-from-a-ruptured-achilles/1n9zw4ai4pb8x1cfabwoafokiy  &gt; Wilkins ruptured his Achilles in the 1991-92 season, when he was 32-years-old.  so that whole thing about KD being a decade older than Wilkins when they tore their Achilles is based on that SI article that has his wrong age listed."

"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-forward-kevin-durant-finally-reveals-his-true-height  &gt; Since coming into the NBA in 2007, Kevin Durant has listed his height at 6-foot-9. And ever since then, Durant has raised eyebrows while constantly standing next to 7-footers on the court and looking just as tall.   &gt; Finally on Tuesday, the Warriors forward revealed the truth -- he's been lying this whole time.   &gt; Speaking to Bob Fitzgerald on KNBR, Durant put fact over fiction when answering the age-old question of how tall he really is. ""Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6'10"" and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I'm 7-feet,"" Durant finally revealed.  &gt; So, why has Durant been listed at 6-foot-9 for so long?   &gt; ""I just like messin' with people.

"So here's the thing that I have yet to see a single person talk about:  Kevin Durant Broke his right foot twice. Now he tore his right Achilles. People were saying the calf strain was what fucked it up, but if you have a full bag of groceries, and you put a final product in the bag and it breaks, it wasn't the item that broke the bag, it was the fact that the bag was full. I'd argue that his foot breaking twice in that leg put so much pressure on his knee and achilles over time that it snapped. I had the same injury he had in his right foot and my Achilles in particular gets incredibly sore. I couldn't imagine the stress Kevin Durant puts on his Achilles. I hope he doesn't, but I wouldn't be surprised if he tears a major ligament or has meniscus issues after he comes back in that right leg. I hope he doesn't, but it's a possibility"
"Oh right, that was when LeBron outplayed him in literally every facet of basketball while the entire Cavs defence was “don’t let Curry take a shot”, good call. Or was it the following year when the Cavs got curbstomped because they’d rather give Kevin Durant open dunks than Curry an open three?"

Steph Curry also more important to GSW than Kevin Durant
Russell Westbrook more important to OKC than Kevin Durant
Imagine if they were to add a MVP scoring champ like Kevin Durant! I’d love to see that happen
Really reminds me of Kevin Durant
Or would have called up Kevin Durant after the game and begged him to join his team.
"&gt; I'm not going to even have the gravity argument with you, I already made my point, if you still don't understand it's beyond me.  ...okay  &gt; Everyone is fit in the NBA, especially PG, he doesn't crumble defenders like Harden or KD, defending is a lot more tiring than running, also their defenders have a much more noticeable effect, Harden irritates defence with a lot more effect. Also I'm not explaining because I'm expecting you won't understand, see, the two go hand in hand.  Shedding constant screens is absolutely a tiring exercise. You’re probably not explaining because you’re not confident in your ability to do so.  &gt; Obviously, but the narrative sure doesn't fit on Gobert when, say, he won the DPOY? we have people saying he shouldn't have even won it, also he's still not a top 15 player despite Utah ranking top 1-2 defence most seasons with or without offense.  How often does a seasonal award winner not receive pushback. It’s normal for DPOY, MVP whatever to be a subject of controversy and some level of debate. I have no idea what you’re even trying to prove with this Gobert discussion.  &gt; Alright let's see:  •	⁠21 pts, on 35% FG%, 3/11 3PT, 6 pts from FT in an elimination game, G6 Toronto. •	⁠23 pts, on 35% FG%, 3/10 3PT, 8pts from FT, G2 Toronto. •	⁠Entire first half of HOU series •	⁠12 pts on 21% FG%, 1/9 3PT, 5 pts from FT, G4 LAC.  &gt;No player that is on or above Curry's level had performances this bad, in a single postseason, I can go on to other games but you get it. Try find something, also Kobe gets a lot more criticism playing with Shaq despite Kobe playing better than Steph is doing  Here is that terrible G2 vs Toronto you mention  https://youtu.be/JCks-bQbn1A  Problem here is that you’re not capable of understanding what a bad performance from Curry actually is. I presume you don’t think James Harden is on Curry’s level with his history of poor shooting performances in the playoffs. I suppose Kevin Durant pre Warriors isn’t on Curry’s level either. In 2016 he had games of 7-33, 7-20, 8-21, 10-30, 8-24, 10-31 shooting.  In one historical example to give you context - Larry Bird in 1982 had games of 3-10, 3-8, 4-16, 6-16, 6-19 and 7-18 shooting in a 12 game sample size. Of course he contributed very reliably in other aspects of basketball, but so does Curry.   I don’t know what Kobe has to do with this...but we could use him as an example too if you wanted."
Kevin durant for obvious reasons
"Durant’s been in the league 11 years. Went to the finals four times. Exclude the warriors trips and that’s a 1/8 success rate. But as we know, it’s actually 4/11. Durant was the main reason his team went to the finals in 2012.   The raptors have been in the league for 24 years, going to the finals once. That’s 1/24. Kawhi Leonard was the main factor into the Raptors going to the finals. You can argue LeBron was the main factor, but LeBron didn’t knock out the sixers on a series deciding shot. Kawhi, your teams “it” factor, left the team.   Kevin Durant, in a vacuum, is three times as likely to go the the finals than the raptors are. Take Kawhi off the team and he’s infinitely more likely.   I know my math doesn’t make sense if you’re a fuckin nerd, but I like those odds.   Real life isn’t in a vacuum. Durant’s out for the year. But that’s okay because the Nets without Durant are better than the Raptors in real life too."
"It's still LeBron until someone proves they're better or he proves he can no longer stay healthy enough to carry a team deep in the playoffs. I'm willing to give him last year with a new young team and an injury and say no one's proved it yet. He made 8 straight Finals and except for 2011, he won every time there wasn't a wild talent disparity between him and his finals opponent (and once even when there was, in 2016). He was also clearly the best player in every Finals he's been in during that streak, again 2011 excepted. No other star has accomplished what he has with the resources he's had - the 73-win Warriors had to go get Kevin Durant because they couldn't beat him unless the other 2 best players on his team were injured, and even after he lost Kyrie he still carried his team to the Finals and damn near took a game off the KD Warriors by himself. That was just two years ago. You put KD, Steph, or Kawhi on those Cavs teams in his place and they don't have as much success. Maybe this is the season where Kawhi or Giannis takes his crown, but IMO it's still his right now."
"Im talking about individual players, not teams. Whos a better player, steph or draymond? harden or gobert? Joakim Noah or Kevin Durant? Iverson or Mutumbo? Im not saying defense isn't important but scoring champs tend to be better players."
"Kevin Durant would be pretty sweet, and PROBABLY not 1-4"
"&gt;On Tuesday, Yahoo Sports published the first interview with Kevin Durant since he left the Warriors for the Brooklyn Nets in free agency. In the article, Yahoo's Chris B. Haynes wrote that Durant decided to keep ""his mouth shut and focus on his craft"" at some point during the 2018-19 season after chatter regarding his impending free agency reached a deafening level.   In response to all of the Knicks buzz that took a life of its own.   FWIW, they had  a scare that he was going to leave after 2018 more than even last season according to Lowe."
"I'm from his area. Don't know how he's going to pan out but Emoni's been getting hyped since, like, sixth or seventh grade. Could see a storm a-brewin' and it's been pretty interesting to see what he was able to do with Ypsi-Lincoln right off the bat.   If nothing else, I'm intrigued right now. He plays like Kevin Durant at the moment."
Kevin Durant Russel Westbrook James Harden
"Idk bud. Curry definitely *tries* harder but Harden this past season was actually pretty decent on D.   Also, how is your argument that Curry has mvps and Chris didnt valid? Curry got his mvps while still in a league with Lebron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, etc. Its not as though he didnt have to work just as hard to win one than Wade would've had to. Simple fact of the matter is, one of the main reasons why Wade doesn't have an MVP is because Wade was never able to (aside from a two year span) lead his team to have great regular seasons. The heat were pretty consistent in finishing as a 44 or so win team until Lebron and Bosh came around."
- Lebron James  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - James Harden  - Giannis  - Paul George  - Anthony Davis  - Kawhi Leonard  - Joel Embiid
"last year the people lebron guarded shot 46% in the NBA, but they shot 43% when lebron guarded them, a difference of 3%  the people kawhi guarded shot 46% against the rest of the NBA, but 46% against him. the difference was 0%  here are some other guys considered elite defenders:  Paul George 46% and 45%, 1% difference  Patrick Beverly 45% and 43%, 2% difference  Ben Simmons 46% and 44%, 2% difference  Kevin Durant 46% and 41%, 5% difference  Giannis Antetokounmpo 47% and 40%, 7% difference  and the League Leader by a country mile, T.J. Leaf 45% and 34%, 11% difference (only one over 7%)  personal defense is too often attributed to team defense. Lebron is still a great defender based on how hard it is for the NBA to score on him. he definitely isn't as concerned about stopping his man from getting the ball, but he's one of the best at contesting without fouling.   he definitely affects people trying to score and they usually don't score. he doesn't have the energy to make up for the mistakes of his teammates, but he does his job extremely well.   Lebron's numbers in 2013-2014 when he's often considered ""in his defensive prime"" (first year they started this tracking, year after he finished 2nd in DPOY) were 45% and 43%, a 2% difference  he's actually guarding slightly better shooters and holding them to slightly lower FG% nowadays than then, but his teammates were much better defensively so he gets more credit  there is a clip from last year where lebron calls out the other team's whole play and says who is cutting where, etc and they still get a layup out of it because mcgee (i think) rotated to slow to take away a weakside cut  he's not perfect, but teams go at him and fail. the problem is that nba defenses are more complex than people know since it's evolved at the pro-level to be completely unlike other leagues' defenses.   even insiders don't 100% know all the caveats."
Nobody is claiming Lebron 'locked down' Kevin Durant only that he played good defense. With Kawhi people claim that not only did Kawhi play good defense but that he locked down Lebron.
"I did not say tell me what the rank of the Rockets was, I told you to tell me that it is the best version of offensive basketball that can be produced. You did not.   And I will tell you why it is not. You lack the capacity to think beyond the numbers. While the last two seasons the Rockets have ranked highly in Ortg in the regular season, in both postseasons 2018 and 2019 did their Ortg as a team tank in multiole different series compared to the regular season. Contrast to the Warriors the past two years whose ORTG have stayed the same or increased in the postseason against multiple opponents. Why? The Rockets offense is catered around numbers where the numbers dictate their shot selection. This means they will only ever take 3s or layups, rarely mid range shots, even when they are open. This leads them to force up shots, shots that arent actually open, shots that are contested. They do not take the easy shot, they take the more difficult shot because it should yield more points. This is a rigid way of playing in which if you do not adapt, defenses can gameplan to slow down your offense. This is why I asked if you could tell me that the version of offense the Rockets produced was the best version of basketball. It is not. Just because it rated high in ORTG for a regular season does not mean it can not be improved. The Rockets as a team shot a middling 35% and 36% from 3 the past two seasons. You can not tell me that a more diversified offense with less rigid shot selection would have made the Rockets offense even better.   Why do the Warriors consistently rate high in ORTG even going into the postseason? Because they do not run a stagnant offense and do not limit themselves to what shots they could take. They run a motion offense utilizing Stephs gravity as a shooter, versatility and unselfishness of its players to create easy shots for everybody. Does it help to have Kevin Durant? Yes, but even Warrior fans will tell you they would much rather the Warriors run thejr offense than just let KD isolate all the time. Even the Warriors prior to KD did not suffer as many drops in postseason Ortg as consistently as the Rockets.  You dont need APM to figure out what roleplayers to scout for. Watch the damn game and figure out what they can do well and what they don't do well.   All a TSS% does is tell me that a players degree of overall efficiency. Nothing more, nothing less. This is why it is a meaningless stat. It does not tell you how a player gets their shots or what kind of offense is run or what shots are being taken. I do not need TSS% as a basis to scout for players. DAngelo Russell has a comparatively low TSS% compared to most, this does not make him a hole on offense that you dont want to give the ball to. I do not use TSS% to tell me hes an excellent shooter, very good at creating mid range shots and hitting them at a good clip, but is lackluster in getting to the rim and does not draw many free throws. I do not use TSS% to tell me that Klay Thompson, despite having a less TSS% than Steph Curry or Kevin Durant is someone Im going to pay less attention trying to defend them than others. I do not use TSS% to identify that Klays abilities as a ball handler and foul drawing are limited and that he is a rather limited offensive player. I do not need TSS% to gameplan against Giannis, I only need his individual FG% from mid range and 3 to know to force him to shoot jumpers or to simply watch his game.  Draymond Green is a limited player on offense. He would not be anywhere close to where he is now without Steve Kerr constructing an offense that utilizes his strengths. If Draymond was truly a top 5 prospect then he should have the talent and abilities of most lottery picks to be an All Star on offense or better and lead a team."
"lmao, I know you think this is a gotcha but it really isn't. Just because a player thinks he is okay to play doesn't mean that the medical staff gets a pass on letting the player play. Hey remember when Klay Thompson injured his ACL in game 6 and he begged the medical staff and tried to convince the medical team that he was okay to play, do you think it would be okay for the medical team to let him play out the game? The player's opinion on his health is irrelevant because they want to be out there no matter what, even if they are not 100% and know they are not 100%.  Okay so lets look at this logically, how long does it take for a calf strain to heal? Well generally medical experts conclude that for a calf strain to fully heal generally takes around 6 weeks. Now he was back on the court in just around four weeks, meaning that his calf was not fully healed? What does this mean? Well it means that because his calf was most likely not fully healed, and that he was most likely using other muscle groups to compensate for his weakened calf. Here is an article with a medical expert talking about this: https://www.inquirer.com/health/kevin-durant-achilles-rupture-calf-strain-compensation-pattern-injury-20190619.html So, the warrior medical staff most likely knew that his calf was not fully healed since it generally takes six weeks for a calf injury to heal and that he would be compensating with other muscles to make up for this and that he had a risk of injuring another muscle group. And lo and behold look what happened, he ruptured his achilles within 15 minutes of play. I highly doubt thats a fucking coincidence mate. Just because KD says he doesn't blame the medical staff doesn't mean that I can't blame the medical staff for taking this risk."
"Are we comparing  porzingis, with Kevin fucking Durant. The person who was having an argument for best player in the league before  he went dowb. Even then people said his contract is a gamble, yet a player who is 7'3, anaemic and 240 pounds that has been dealing with lower back, knee, and ankle injury then finally tore his acl on a regular play. Dude is not the poster boy for health, and getting injury protection is not alienating a player. It is literally saying if you play x amount of games you would get x amount if not you still get a hefty paycheck. If he feels alienated from that then he is a diva, cause he has not warranted the right. Onliy a select few players can command the max while being that injury prone, and Porzingis is not one of them"
Dr. Gottlieb;  + Kyrie is schizophrenic   + Kevin Durant has borderline personality disorder  + Ray Allen and Kobe had OCD  + Kawhi has autism  MD in being a sensationalist that is riding Cowherd’s coattails.
Because Kevin Durant is not a top 10 player all time. I thought we were done with burner accounts? Cmon KD.
"After that, Woj: ""The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets"""
12 game explosion ?   Kevin Durant last 3 playoffs :   48 Games 30/7/5 67TS%   LeBron missed the playoffs(that’s why I don’t have him at 1) but I can use his last 3 too   31/9/8 60TS%
"Let me preface what I'm about to say by acknowledging how dumb and classless it was for fans to cheer an injury. You don't do that in any sport, full stop.  Durant is a petty, dramatic bum. I hope we don't have to hear any more about Kevin once the season starts. He can spend the year trashing more people on his burner accounts."
Gladly.  Kevin Durant played on a team that included another top 5 player and two other all stars. He gave up any claim he had to best player in the league when he decided to make the most stacked team in history.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/06/10/kevin-durant-has-been-cleared-to-practice-questionable-for-game-5/amp/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/2019/06/08/kevin-durant-calf-injury-news-update-workout-warriors-finals  He was cleared for practice literally a couple days before the game. The second article mentions that the workouts to test his calf’s recovery went poorly - I recall several other reports echoing that sentiment. How the fuck does he go from not even being able to practice, his earlier calf injury still questionable, to playing in an nba finals game? It’s absurd. There was no indication he would come back at all other than an optimistic time table that he *could* do so.   Anyone who watched the game could see how hobbled he was. He was playing at half speed all  of the 13(!) minutes he lasted out there before predictably getting an injury.   I’m not saying this as an indictment of the Warriors organization. Most teams would have been fine with an earlier return. It’s a problem the NBA has writ large - among fans, media, and individual organizations - everyone was pushing him to come back or “he didn’t want it enough” and other lunacy.  The worst part? It’s most certainly going to happen again. You can’t put a player in that kind of atmosphere and expect them to be the one that says no."
"KD didn't exactly help clarify matters, though. Remember when he [liked the instagram post referring to the Warriors staff as ""incompetent?""](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-likes-ig-post-calling-out-warriors-incompetence/19v8srlyqif9317yhhpw6nd2uv)  These days that's enough to give a story some serious legs, whether or not it's substantial."
&gt; Stephen Curry has lost 15  &gt; Kawhi Leonard has lost 7  &gt; Kevin Durant has lost 9  How many total finals games have these guys played compared to Lebron and West?
"LeBron has played: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Russel Westbrook, James Harden, Dirk, Duncan, Manu, Parker, Kawahi. No one said Jordan never had tough competition.   The east became weak but it wasn't always like that. He had to play the Celtics that beat Kobe's lakers, the Pistons that beat Kobe and Shaq, The Knicks with Carmello, Amare, (probs an overrated team). Point is saying he has just walked into the finals is not fair at all. His last stint in Cleveland he had a weakness team and was the 4th or 5th seed and muscled his way in.  What LeBron did at the age of 22 against the pistons too proves that east wasn't easy and he was the second coming of Jordan."
Kevin Durant has a better reusumè
"If Kevin durant got jacked he wouldn’t be a better player, it’s not his game"
"Often times people remember the altered retelling of the story rather than the original story itself. For example, the Sports Illustrated story about Draymond texting KD from the locker room after the 2016 Finals somehow transformed into Draymond crying to KD from the parking lot.  Original story: https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/13/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-nba-championship-draymond-green-text"
“You know who isn’t on Jordan’s level? Kevin Durant.”
"&gt; When I look at greatest players, i usually go by talent on the field of play whatever it is. Dan Marino is almost universally considered a top 5-10 QB because of what he did on the field with no rings.  Football is a lot different than basketball. Players do not have as big of an impact in football as in basketball, and they do not have much control of the teams they play for as nba players do. Superstars can win championships in the nba, you need a full team and system (and a lot of luck) to win a championship in the nfl.   Charles Barkley is also considered one of the top 5-10 power forwards of all time, he just is not a top 15-20 player of all time.   &gt; I'm not trying to speculate on your age but it's a recent phenomenon that players that haven't won cant be in consideration for all time greats.  That is because we have a lot more players in contention for all time greats. If you take out 21st century all time greats players like Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Kevin Garnett then it suddenly becomes easier to be considered in the top 20, because there are a lot less players to compete with. It is not rocket science."

"I've heard that while durian smells fucking terrible, it does taste good. Durant seems fucking terrible if he isn't on your team lol  Spiky exterior, but soft on the inside. Guy's tough on the media but is actually a cool guy.  I've never had durian, but my parents always bring a lot of it home when they can. The damn things stink up the freezer so bad, my ice cream ends up smelling like durian so I have to just give it away. If KD isn't on your team, best believe he's going to make your team's life a living hell and you can't do anything about it. Again, I've never had durian. Durant has never been a Laker. Maybe if he comes to the Lakers I'd try to eat durian...*maybe*  tl;dr, +1 vote for Kevin Durian"
"&gt; Don't act like there weren't reports the entire year about it  I'm not, but the thing is, those were reports from *reporters*, a category of individuals Kevin Durant *fucking hates* and clearly *was not talking to*.  It was so obviously bullshit and wistful thinking on their part. There was never anything vaguely approaching a source."
"He changed before he went to the Warriors. He was really nice before. As in really nice. He appeared to be a good kid. Then he got tired of not showing his true emotions, and so he changed. Became true to himself as a person. If you watched him before, you can really tell the difference.  Here’s an article about his change: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/thunder/2014/09/29/kevin-durant-thunder-lebron-james-team-usa-free-agency/16399315/  And here’s the “Too Nice?” commercial: https://youtu.be/DFSNTficfuE"
Kevin durant? Maybe Klay Thompson?  Even steph has a case although he lacks on defence
You guys were cool until Kevin Durant came along. Relax. When he came along the only thing that was revolutionary was the # of all-stars on the same roster.
"https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146560882178056192  &gt; The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561014424621064  &gt; The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561112772685825  &gt; The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561386228719618  &gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561874684760069  &gt; Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146561986936889344  &gt; The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562326730092544  &gt; The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146562923239759872  &gt; And that’s why the Warriors will need to acquire Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham in the D’Angelo Russell trade, even though their salaries were non-guaranteed. And it’s also why they’ll need to pay the Wolves cash just to get rid of them!  https://mobile.twitter.com/AlbertNahmad/status/1146563484961910784  &gt; For those asking: If you follow my tweets closely, you will notice that the Nets will sign D’Angelo Russell into cap room. So BYC will NOT apply. That is the most critical part of this entire story!"
"You two bone heads are ridiculous you know that.   #1 No one wants to do work to prove you two knuckle heads wrong.  #2 Attempting to search for news regarding KD Calf / Achilies injury would just flood you with his recent interview stating how the Warriors are not to blame. So any news that was said about his injury a month ago would be burried deep within the Google pages. So that is working for you two.  But here is one. Its probably not the best one, bceause I assure you there were several a month ago where this was mentioned by several journalist / beat writers. But I do not want to spend any more time of my life for you two idiots. u/wakandafist  *“When we gathered all of the information, our feeling was the worst that could happen would be a re-injury of the calf,” Kerr told reporters during Wednesday’s media availability. “That was the advice and the information that we had, and at that point, once Kevin was cleared to play, he was comfortable with that and we were comfortable with that, so the Achilles came as a complete shock. ... Had we known this was a possibility — that this was even in the realm of possibility — there’s no way we would’ve ever allowed Kevin to come back, so it’s devastating.”*  https://sports.yahoo.com/steve-kerr-no-way-warriors-would-let-kevin-durant-play-knowing-achilles-at-risk-211827104.html   What is funny is you have KD here saying the Warriors arent to blame.

Kevin Durant: NBA Referee
"Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Charles Barkley"
Of course Kevin Durant wanted to get back and playing the finals.  The Warriors organization should have had a doctor telling him that it wasn't okay to play on.
"Kevin Durant will not be playing at all next year.     Durant's window is a couple years, assuming he recovers from his injury.   The Raptors have endless years to get back."

He is Kevin fucking Durant. Any typical rules on the dating scene don't apply. He could get just about any woman he wanted. And then he could fly them to wherever he was whenever he wanted
The entire thread is shitting on r/NBA for narrative when the same sub also doesn't believe anything Kevin Durant says half the time. Makes sense.
"no man KD is a cool dude, haven't met the guy yet but I'm pretty sure he's cool. I'm not Kevin Durant too"
"right, and then after that he said this:   https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/26/andre-iguodala-defends-warriors-training-staff-on-how-they-managed-himself-kevin-durant/"
"What people are failing to understand is that yes they cheered his injury but in my mind they weren’t cheering because Kevin Durant the man is a bad guy to us or that we want to see players injured. But this city has been a losing sports city for 25 years. We made the finals to okay a team many saw as sweeping us out of the finals. The fact we won the first game probably surprised a lot of people, myself included. The fact we were up 3 games to 1 against a team that again many see as this almighty super team that can’t be beat against this(what many people in the states see us as) smaller market non traditional basketball city’s team was just amazing. And I’m not gonna lie. Even when we were up 3-1 I still thought there was a good chance we didn’t win. We weren’t supposed to be there. We were a few lucky bounces from almost being eliminated in the second round. We were down 2 games in the ECF. And now we are staring down the final win to clinch an NBA title. A title that went to the best of the best for the last however many years. No one picked us to win this. In a poll the previous year with 4 teams left in the playoffs we were called “other” when asked who would win the title. So now here we are, Durant comes into the game and is lights out. He’s now threatening our only chance in many peoples eyes of winning a chip. We all knew in the back of our minds that Kawhi might leave. And then he goes down. People weren’t celebrating Kevin Durant getting hurt because we are blood hungry savages. We were cheering because the best chance for them to beat us went down. And we already proved we could be the team without him on it. Like I get it, without all that context people think we were cheering for this man to be actually hurt cuz Fuck him right? Nah man, and maybe there’s no excuse for it but I’m 100% certain that if this was a regular season game that no one would’ve cheered and would actually be upset at the fact that they payed good money to come see the GSW play the Raps only for one of their stars to go down. Call me an asshole and downvote me to hell but I was happy he went down because I know KD is probably right. We won’t be there for a bunch of years unless the stars align like they did this past year."
The Nets had a solid team last year with no super stars.  Now they have Kevin Durant and Kyrie.  They are a solid team.

KD has already verified that he's [6'11''](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2016/12/13/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-real-height-7-feet-tall-video/) in socks but he tends to slouch a ton so who knows. Maybe theyll smack him up against a wall and he'll be 7 feet.
"Yes, keep thinking that Kevin Durant is 6’10.25 with shoes when he’s noticeably taller than guys listed at 6’11 and even 7’ in photos of them side by side, keep thinking all this is accurate. A lot of combine measurements are not accurate."
"Players shots 35% on 3s against Kawhi last year one of the worst marks in the league and no other all-defense players allowed those type of numbers.  Kawhi was ranked [249th in DRPM last year](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/DRPM). Worse than his own teammates like Vanvleet, Siakam, Ibaka, and Lowry. James Harden was ranked 248.  Go up the list and Kevin Durant is ranked 171, Jayson Tatum 99, Lebron James 41, Jimmy Butler 40, Marc Gasol 20, Paul George 17, Anthony Davis 15, Giannis 11, Embid 5, Draymond 4, Gobert 1. Yet somehow Kawhi has a rep as the best defender in the league and is getting all-defense selections like these guys and even over these guys."
"Meh, either he's 7 foot, or Boogie Cousins AND Deandre Jordan both exaggerate their height. And also Boogie, who says he's ""every bit of 7 feet"" is just wrong.   [https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-true-height-demarcus-cousins-usa-olympic-basketball/11x65h8jsxzug1phpkzq0ar4iz](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-true-height-demarcus-cousins-usa-olympic-basketball/11x65h8jsxzug1phpkzq0ar4iz)   &amp;#x200B;  I mean who knows really, but that doesn't look like 6'10 to me. And there's the pics where he's taller than Giannis."
"I think everyone's a little different in that sense. It's probably optimal because it minimizes the distance that the ball has to travel from gather to release, but if your dominant (targeting) eye is on the opposite side from your dominant hand, the ball might travel toward the opposite side of your shooting hand on the way to the release point. You can see it in players like [D'Angelo Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf9kgV0bzPk) and [Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOtMzRuCMn8). Lonzo's clearly left-eye dominant as a right-handed shooter, so maybe he's in this category?"
"I’d say he’s the Kevin Durant of golf currently. Obviously dominant, has kind of a weird chip on his shoulder and can be a bit of a dick towards the media at times. Golf is tough to compare to because you can’t win every tournament, but he’s been consistent in a way over the last three years that we haven’t really seen since Tiger"
Lol they already tried to spin this narrative right after the trade to which Porzingis responded by saying that he would love to play with KD. https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/252862/Kristaps-Porzingis-Would-Welcome-Playing-With-Kevin-Durant-On-Mavericks
Ok..... But that's one stat. Why would you focus on one stat when literally every other stat has kawhi as far and away the better player for yall?    Would you think that vucevic contributes more to winning than Kevin Durant because he also has a higher rpm?
Kevin &amp; L'Carpetron Durant
I'm not saying the Clippers will be a top 5 defense in the league but jesus christ that Warriors series did a number on Zubac's reputation. Analytics show he is one of the better interior defenders in the league. He was unplayable vs the Warriors for many other reasons related to his inability to switch onto wings like Kevin Durant. He was also bricking everything because of his broken hands.
"Kevin Durant, in 1 move created the greatest team of all time."
"My man.. how do you have Kevin Durant in there? He’s not even gonna  start the season due to injury, if he plays at all..."
"Hmm, didn’t they have a couple of guys named Kevin Durant and Andre Igoudala on that team? And didn’t Klay get a severe injury this season?"
Kevin Durant has the best handle in history.
"It was banned in the sense that you couldn't hold the ball handler for too long, you could still hand-check.   &gt;Did you see the refs call handchecking on Patrick Beverley when he was guarding Kevin Durant this year?  Yes, what's your point? The 90s still allowed more physicality on the perimeter.  Just like how zone defense is used today. It was illegal in the 90s, teams still used it, but not to tje extent of today's NBA."
"Handchecking literally was banned in the 90s. Sure it still happened, but it happens now too. They don't call it. Did you see the refs call handchecking on Patrick Beverley when he was guarding Kevin Durant this year?"

Lmao Kevin Durant is the worst player in nba history. I'd rank Thabo sefalosha over him
Kevin Durant would be pretty good on the Warriors.
"WARNING, CONJECTURE:  I'm pretty convinced Durant always wanted a superstar bff off the court. Maybe he thought Steph would be that, but it seems like Curry splits all his off the court time between his family and golf. I don't see him meeting Durant at his SF penthouse to veg out/enjoy nightlife, and I don't see KD driving to the east bay and joining Steph for a family bbq cookout. As far as I saw via all the team photos and clips on social media, Kevin wasn't too keen on golf, either."
https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/
"Kevin Durant is a generational talent, to be certain.   But Curry has something intangible that makes him potentially higher than generational. He's like a Shaq, but in point guard form. Just changes the game around him.   I don't know, they're both too good though."
"Steph is the core and leader of the team, and is the main reason why the Warriors were able to perform at a certain high level.  If you make other additions or changes to the roster that improve the performance of the team, you raise their level even further and technically take them to “higher highs.”  For example, if you win 60 games with Steph on your team, then trade Harrison Barnes for Jae Crowder, and then win 64 games the next couple seasons, then technically Jae Crowder took your team to “higher highs.”  Does that mean he is the sole reason for the Warrior’s strength?  No, that’s still Steph; take Crowder away and you still win 60 games because Steph’s still there.  It’s just that the other guy allows you to do *even more* than what you *already could do*.  What’s unique about the Warriors is that instead of adding Jae Crowder, they added Kevin Durant.  That’ll make your higher highs a lot higher.  Now I believe that Curry was still the #1 guy, the leader and core of the Warriors.  But again, KD allowed them to do even more.  This was seen in the ‘18 WCF, when the Rockets took the Warriors to seven games, and in this year’s Finals.  In both series KD was a turning point; without him the series was uncertain, even with Steph and the others, but with him they held the distinct advantage.  The difference is that without Steph (and with KD), I believe that the Warriors’ chances would be worse than “uncertain.”  I think they would in fact start off at a disadvantage.  Steph is the crux of the Warrior’s power, while KD was auxiliary.  In short, I define “higher highs” as taking something already great and making it even better.  Steph is the “already great;” KD is the “even better” - not better than Steph himself, but rather making an already stacked team perform even better than it did before."
does anyone seriously believe kevin durant would not be the best player in any era before this current one?
Kevin Durant comes to mind
"Kevin Durant has been better for longer. He has one less MVP and Title, however he’s a better scorer than curry and a way better defender. I love Steph curry, but there is no way I’m taking him before Durant"
Kevin Durant was the better player even while being on the same team.
"**2017 regular season  Kevin Durant - 25.1 points on 65.1 TS%  Steph Curry - 25.3 points on 62.4 TS%  **2017 entire playoffs**  Kevin Durant - 28.5 points 68.3 TS%  Steph Curry - 28.1 points on 65.9 TS%  Now, I’m not sure how much you value defence - I value it quite a bit. KD has always been an above average to good defender. Steph can be serviceable. Sometimes. Maybe. If you squint your eyes and tilt your head to the left. Usually he’s anywhere between below average to neutral."
Are you sure those aren't just the new [KD shoes](https://www.news.com.au/sport/american-sports/kevin-durant-what-are-those/news-story/cdcb616ee824fcd2263e2bbf339d901f)?
And then Kevin Durant led that same team to higher highs.
Kevin Durant has two finals mvps to Curry’s zero when they played on the same team both in their prime. That should be where the argument begins and ends.
Kevin Durant
"&gt; Try to avoid outcome bias when determining if a decision was good or bad.   You''re essentially saying ""look, X player ended up injured, so whatever decisions led to that outcome must be bad.""  The logical converse would be ""X player ended up winning the championship, so whatever decision led to that outcome must be good.""  Why are you phrasing it as X player? You can say his name. Kevin Durant got injured. He’s a person.  And why doesn’t that logic make sense? It’s not *just* the outcome that backs it up. Look at the facts surrounding him.  - He practiced a total of ONE time before playing. One time. You think one single practice is enough to make the decision that he’s ready to play? I don’t.  - The body part he hurt was *directly* connected to his most recent injury. It’s not like he hurt his elbow, his hand or even his knee. The two body parts are directly connected.  - You also have to consider the amount of *time* it took for KD to get injured. It’s not like he played 3, 2 or even a full game. He got injured TEN MINUTES into the game dude. If he played a game, then came back the next game I’d be more inclined to agree with you. But ten minutes? Come on man.  - It’s not the first time something like this has happened with the Warriors. They have a history of pressuring players to come back early from injury. See [Andre Iguodala](https://youtu.be/eb3zfWEPo4I).  I think the way you put is is an oversimplification. What you’re essentially saying is this: Kevin Durant injured a body part that was directly connected to the body part he most recently injured and finished recovering from 10 minutes into the game by and the two injuries are completely unrelated. Meanwhile, a team of fully trained medical professionals saw no scenario where this outcome was possible. That just sounds absurd when you read it out loud.  &gt; This just isn't true.  ""Bad"" decisions can lead to good outcomes as well.  For example, a clearly hobbled Kawhi Leonard playing 40+ minutes a game was, by your logic for Durant, a bad decision, however it led to the Raptors winning the Championship.  &gt;Both the Raptors and the Warriors medical staff cleared their respective players to play, the only difference was that Durant and Klay tore their ligaments, and Kawhi did not.  This difference in outcome does not affect validity of decisions made prior.  It's just luck.  Yeah except that’s not really an accurate comparison. Klay’s injury was not directly connected to a previous injury. It was a freak accident. Kawhi was hobbled from regular wear and tear. Uncomfortable, sure. But nothing to make the doctors believe he was at risk for further injury. And again, Kawhi hadn’t *just* come back from a recent injury. KD had. It’s not luck in any way, shape or form and I don’t really see how you can make the connection that those situations were similar.   &gt; Food for thought, how would it look if Durant (cleared medically by the team and personal doctors) decided not to play, then turned down a supermax to play with the Nets?  In this scenario, you don't know that Durant would have torn his ACL.  Harder to judge without hindsight, right?  You could say ""those medical teams are clearly incorrect, and Durant needs to rest until next season at least because he will tear a ligament if he comes back this series.  Also Kawhi won't get injured.  Ignore his limp, play him all you want.""  Everyone would look at your flair and roll their eyes.  I absolutely disagree. I think it would have been viewed as the right decision by most logical people. You’d get the idiots saying “KD is soft hurr durr” but most people would have understood. We literally have an example from 2 seasons ago where a player came back too early for the benefit of the team and it ruined his career (Isiah Thomas). People would have understood.  I’ll never get this trend of bending over backwards to defend front offices as if they can do no wrong. Maybe because it’s KD and people just generally hate him? I don’t know. I just legitimately think people have plugged their ears and went “lalalala” with the KD situation all because Bob Myers shed a few tears on camera."
"uh yeah they are. Defenders can get away with physical contact in the playoffs. Look at how FVV defended Curry. Look at how Tony Allen defended Kevin Durant back in 2013.   &gt;Malone would fall apart in the playoffs and Stockton would carry that team running P&amp;R.  Karl was pretty clearly Utah's best playoff performer and to say he fell apart and not Stockton is pretty absurd. Stockton's scoring efficiency dropped by a similarly large margin as Karl's in the playoffs, which is much more damning because Karl was the one shouldering Utah's offensive burden while Stockton picked his opportunities carefully. Utah needed someone other than Karl to act as a reliable secondary scorer, and too often Stockton didn't rise to that occasion.  Malone is one of the best of all time at sealing his man deep into paint. A TON of Stockton's assists to Karl were more so a credit to his positioning than the pass itself."
"I don't consider this offseason a failure because we didn't get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. I consider this offseason a failure because rather than be a team that utilized their cap space to take on vets for assets (and look around, quality veteran players who are hard working professionals who can actually play were traded, and trade with 1st round picks). Instead, we signed a bunch of FAs who:  1. Don't make our ""core"" better this year;  2. Don't aid in the development of our ""core"" for the future;  3. Will not help this team make the playoffs, or frankly, even help us not be one of the 2 or 3 worst teams in the league (I actually think there's a strong possibility we finish as the worst record in the league again), and;  4. Operating under the assumption that the Knicks are still completely unwilling to take on negative contracts to acquire assets, not one of these free agents can ""just be flipped to playoff teams for assets at the deadline"". Partly because you'd need a playoff team that has a matching expiring contract, and partly because some of the guys we signed (Randle, Portis, Payton most notably) can't actually help a playoff team.  So given that our ""core"" is not gonna get better this year or develop for future years, we're not gonna make the playoffs, and next summer the guys we signed are gonna walk for nothing, I don't understand how anyone can view this as anything other than a total failure.  Also, I've heard some people say ""oh well if we have a bad record, then we'll get a high draft pick, so that's another way things work out for us"". And while I agree it's good to get a high draft pick since we have no high end talent and that will give us another chance to bring one in, I feel like if (or likely when) we're again one of the worst teams in the league we'll have to admit that we dont have a young core of a future championship team. If we really had 5-6 young guys that could be a core of a future championship team, then they're not finishing with the worst record in the NBA. And before you point to the Process Sixers, the only reasom they were able to be one of the worst teams in the league while having championship caliber players in their roster is that their championship caliber players didn't play during the losing years. And the lottery picks that did play were jettisoned for nothing and are now fringe roster players."
They had a guy named Kevin Durant before when they last played together  Not saying it won’t work but I don’t think you can use their last time playing together as a reason it will work
Harden and WB played with Kevin Durant on the team. Come on stop it lol
Are you really putting *Peja Stojakovic* into the same conversation as Kevin Durant?
"You can have all the draft picks you want, you're not getting anything close to Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook again."
"Who else are they gonna attack? 7ft foot Demi god Kevin Durant? All nba defensive players draymond green, klay Thompson or Andre Igoudala?    No shit they had game plans to attack curry"
"He tweeted that he would drink scarlett johansson's bathwater.  Also, he was asked about this on the bs podcast and stood firm on that statement.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/08/kevin-durant-scarlett-johansson-bath-water-tweet-team-usa-rio-draymond-taurasi-trash-talk-funny-simmons-podcast/amp"
"This.  KG and Karl Malone were both amazing power-forwards, and I think one could argue they they were the two best to play the PF position.  I do consider Duncan a 5 and not a 4, so I will leave him out of the conversation.  However, Dirk redefined the position and created the ""stretch"" PF position.  I think we all suffer from what era of ball we have witnessed, but between KG, the Mailman, and Dirk, the best is in there somewhere. Of course, Kevin Durant could ultimately have something to say about this too...."
"Hope he has a great year.  When I saw him crying after the semi-finals, I got excited for next season, because I remembered Kevin Durant had a similar experience in the 2012 Finals and said he was tired of being #2 (position ranking, draft pick, etc.) and then won MVP in 2014."
"Can't speak for all the players that do this but KD wanted to be listed as shorter because he didn't want to play in the post.  “I always thought it was cool to say I’m a 6-9 small forward,” Durant told the Wall Street Journal in that 2016 interview. “Really, that’s the prototypical size for a small forward. Anything taller than that, and they’ll start saying, ‘Ah, he’s a power forward.'”  https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/30/why-warriors-list-kevin-durant-at-6-foot-9-wink/"
"Same. After watching them in the pool phase I thought they were unbeatable. Also for anyone reading along, Poland basically did a kevin durant on Golden state. They recently added the best player in the world to their team (wilfredo Leon) after they had just won the world championships"
lol that's even worse. It would mean all you have to do is shoot 3s at 27% or so to be equivalent to Kevin Durant in the midrange. Literally no reason to shoot them ever anymore.
And he was still clowning folks with that old man game.  It's the reason why I refuse to give up on Kevin Durant. Dirk has provided the perfect mold for him to return as.
"The most unique thing about Dirk's fade away is the fact that he looks at the ball, rather than the rim, when he shoots all his shots. Kobe and Jordan's fade away shots have been just as effective, if not more. The difference is that Dirk can simply lean back on one foot, while Jordan and Kobe had to get six more inches of air to release the ball at the height Dirk did. The ""Dirk Fade Away"" is just a slow motion, closer to the ground Jordan fade away, as done by a seven footer. And Kevin Durant does it better anyway. The leg out in front? Everybody does that. Dirk just has longer legs.      The same principle applies to Kareem's signature move, really. I can do all the hook shots in the world, but they will be easier to stop because I'm 5'10. They will never be ""Sky Hooks"" because I'm not 7'2"" with 30' arms. Although, I give a lot of credit to Kareem for perfecting the straight arm reach as far away from the defender as possible, then barely flicking his wrist. Your Dwight Howard, turn around style heave hook shot just isn't the same."
LBJ  Larry Legend  Kevin Durant   Dr. J  Kawhi Leonard  Elgin Baylor  Dominique   Scottie Pippen  Paul Pierce  Carmelo

We do not speak of the aggies round these here parts. This is longhorn country. La Marcus even went there! HOOKEM ( i dont think a&amp;m has put out all stars like he or kevin durant... )
"This is the problem with this sub. Thinking someone like curry struggles to score in isolation is absurd lol  He was highly efficient from literally *everywhere*. Not just pull ups threes. He lead the league out of guards for FG % in the restricted area lol  The reason he struggled in the playoffs was because he had a grade 2 MCL sprain, an injury that usually requires 3-4 weeks of rest before resuming training, and came back to play after like 10 days.   Just look at his performance in the finals. No KD, no Klay for half of it. Being guarded by a combination of Lowry, FVV and Kawhi and he put up 30ppg on 60%TS. He is an absurdly efficient iso player, and he has the stats to back it up.   They got KD because he's fucking KD. Not because they needed iso scoring, but because the 2nd or 3rd best player on the planet wanted to join their team so they just said yes. Any team would have said yes, regardless of their team needs. Because it was Kevin Fucking Durant."
Because there's still going to be a bunch of Knick fans in the crowd at any NY sporting event (and obviously more Knick fans than there would be Nets fans).  Plus it's not like KD was winning any popularity contests outside of the Bay even before going to Brooklyn considering (if you haven't heard) he *did* sign with a 73-9 team after blowing a 3-1 lead to them in the Conference Finals.  I don't know what makes you think the whole crowd has to be filled with Knick fans for Kevin Durant *of all people* to get booed.
Looking at you Kevin “7ft in shoes” Durant
"&gt;That's wrong.  Your entire take is laughable. And you keep saying he 'retired', which wasn't the case. His contract was up and was simply moving on as Heisley wouldn't pay luxury tax and was already thinking about selling the team.   &gt;First of all, West started shopping Pau previous season, because of player's trade request.  Heisley didn't want to pay luxury tax for another first round exit and Pau was also disgruntled, which is why he was being shopped. It was pretty much mutual.   &gt;West realized he's not getting a fair offer for Pau and retired  Are you really this naive?   &gt;The offer West ""chose to decline"" from Bulls was also bad, they were trying to get him cheap as well.  The offer wasn't bad though according to a plethora of reports. Which is why there was so much outcry initially over the trade to the Lakers.   &gt; and Pau stayed on trade block for a year with nobody willing to pay a fair price.  West and the Grizzlies thoroughly scouted Marc when he played HS ball in Memphis and after losing a ton of weight he was having a MVP season in the top league in Spain. If you can't read between the lines, nobody can help you. Jerry West is the OG tamper King. They were negotiating through Pau to assure Marc would actually come over.   &gt;Lakers traded for Pau midseason next year. We were chasing Suns for the 1st seed even though most people didn't have Lakers as a playoff team in their season predictions. Kobe injured Bynum's knee around All Star break and about a week later we had to trade for Pau  Pretending the Pau trade just randomly went down due to injury circumstance when it was in the works for over a year is pretty hilarious. I like how you left out the part where Kobe demanded a fucking trade was ready to leave for the second time since Mitch had been GM. West literally swooped in again to save the franchise.   &gt;Grizzlies owner Heisley   The optics of Jerry West sending the Lakers Pau Gasol, especially amidst the Kobe drama never looked good. He's always been  the epitome of humble, hated the spot light and consistently denies credit. After facilitating the Pau trade it's no real surprise he prefers the shadow president ops role. 'Consultant' suits him and allows him a bit more leeway when it comes to the grey area of tampering.     &gt;And where did you read he stayed as a consultant after he retired? Do you have a single source to back that?  Jerry West literally said it himself. He stayed on with Grizz through the summer and oversaw the entire transition period. And he didn't just 'work' for Heisley, they were close friends. If you think he wasn't consulting on the ongoing Pau then you must really young and/or naive.   https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2840564  &gt;West is staying through June 30 and will advise Heisley on his replacement and a new coach and in a draft that could deliver 7-foot center Greg Oden or college player of the year Kevin Durant. Then he said he would be open to working as a consultant.  Speaking of interviews, not only did Jerry West talk about consulting for the Grizz, Heisley has been on record saying many times over how he trust West's opinion above all others.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZoU3SY-eTE  Jerry Buss even had the Logo present the Lakers their 2008 Western Conference trophy lol"
"Well while one was facing Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp in the finals, the other played a team that averaged 70 wins across two seasons then added Kevin Durant. Even just using rings as a tie breaker is lazy"
"Funny to think the 3 mvps drafted by the thunder are some of the most hated players in the league. Kevin ""snake"" Durant, Adolf Hitler, and Russell Westbrick."
"Kyrie and KD LOVE the media. If they didnt like the media, they might stop participating in it for 5 seconds. They ""dont like the media"" like that friend of yours that ""doesn't like drama"" but somehow always manage to get themselves kicked out of the bar every Friday night. Kevin Durant seems to be particularly insecure about the media disliking him, but goes out of his way to portray himself as an interesting character on social media. It is a child like maturity level, like a Redditor that can only take upvotes, but is deeply affected and will argue back for days in posts he catches downvote for."
"Yeah, you're probably right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Durant is NOT walking through that door, okay?"
"LeBron was definitely the best player in the world back then. Now, I think it's either Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard — leaning more towards Kawhi though."
Hes kevin Durant
"There’s an incredibly small chance they get a ring. Kyrie, Levert, and the ghost of Kevin Durant isn’t a championship caliber team."
"I also love that when Simmons set out to analyze/trash Kobe, his idol [Bill Russell had a soft spot for Kobe](https://grantland.com/features/the-kobe-question/). As did Bill Walton.  &gt; So when Russell mentioned a current star devouring his book and stealing that specific concept — then thanking Russell for the help — naturally, I expected the player to be LeBron James, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, maybe even Kevin Durant. Nope.  &gt; Kobe Bryant.  &gt; “Really?” I said *incredulously*.  &gt; And that’s how I learned that basketball’s greatest teammate ever held *something of a soft spot for Kobe,* someone who’s battled more coworkers over the years than Chevy Chase. *Russell enjoys his competitiveness, loves his work ethic, appreciates his respect for history, and over anything else, loves how he borrowed that scouting idea*. No other player ever mentioned it to him. Just Kobe. *Which didn’t make sense to me.*   And Bill Walton arguing with Simmons  &gt; interview Bill Walton for my NBA book and we ended up arguing (in a good-natured way) about Kobe right after he won the 2009 title. My book argued that success hinged on “The Secret” of basketball — that it wasn’t actually about talent, but how you sacrificed your game and meshed with teammates. Walton maintained it was more like a “choice,” saying it was every player’s responsibility to find his own destiny. And that path was going to be different for every player. Walton believed that I didn’t like watching Kobe that much because he didn’t play basketball the way I liked to see basketball played. *That was my choice*, just like it was Kobe’s choice to play that way.   It's fun to see Simmons the hyper celtics fan and Kobe hater see each of his idols praising Kobe..."
Kevin Durant of the national basketball association?
"Where does this even come from? As if Lebron, Kobe, Kyrie, Jimmy Butler, everyone on lob city, Kevin Durant, Draymond, etc. havent publically voiced displeasure with their teammates during or after the season. The fact that no one has ever done that regarding the Lin situation should be evidence that the entire thing is a fabrication."
"I feel like everyone forgets that it was tied. So even if the shot didn't go in, it doesn't mean anything. In fact Kevin durant being hurt did more."
"After the Bucks and Sixers they are probably as good as everyone else in the East, and that's without Kevin Durant."
"Haha holy shit, you really believe Kevin fucking Durant who was dropping 30 a game on elite efficiency the moment he stepped onto a court would be afraid of Jimmy Butler? Heat fans becoming delusional"
Kevin Durant what the fuck does that mean?
I know he's injured but surely Kevin Durant is still up near the top?? Am I blind or did he miss the ESPN list completely?
"kevin durant is 30 years old i highly doubt he grew, from 2014-present he still looks about the same"
[He's actually publicly admitted that he's 7' in shoes and about 6'11 barefoot](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/). Idk why it's still even a debate whether he's 6'9; it's firmly established that he's taller.
Kevin “strong independent woman” Durant
"Wow the blind stats poll. Numbers without context, a poor man’s argument.   No point in getting into this. I get it, Steph is your guy. I like Steph Curry, I’ve defended him in the past... but comparing him to Kobe is too much dip on your chip. We just watched Kevin Durant go to his team and make him the clear #2. Let’s compare Steph to his peers before we start comparing him to the best of the best."
"More like misunderstood.   The Warriors are the poster child for ""small ball"" but look at the actual personnel for the death lineup. With the exception of Draymond, they were actually a really *big* team.   Steph is seen as small, but is actually on the average to slightly tall side for a point guard, and is an excellent rebounder for the position. He's the weakest point defensively, but does just enough that it's not a major hindrance, especially when you consider his otherworldly offensive impact.   Klay is quite big and long for a 2-guard.   Iggy is/was a fantastic defender with great length, one of the few guys able to somewhat check the big star wings like LeBron.   Kevin Durant is seven feet tall with a gargantuan wingspan. He's quite long for the 4, even solid center length, just lighter and more mobile. He gave them plus rim protection for the position, and solid rebounding.   Then there's Draymond. His unique physical traits are well documented with his great wingspan and strong base, which allow him to deal with most bully-type centers and protect the rim well. Plus there's his savant-like mind that makes his positioning and timing excellent, making up for his relative lack of athletic gifts. He's the only guy on the team who's actually undersized for the position and has essentially unprecedented tools to make up for that.  Size, shooting, and general skill are all good things that you want to maximize on the court. It's just that very few teams have the personnel to do all at once, and the Warriors have altered certain assumptions about where that size is needed. Just because you're not running a traditional center doesn't make your team small."
I see you're unfamiliar with Kevin durant.
"It was the fucking Finals, the pinnacle of basketball. Durant and his camp decided he would play after the nod from multiple **MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS**.  The injury fucking sucks, and I hope Kevin and modern medicine can limit the after effects of an achilles injury, but it's not like he was hung out to dry afterwards. The Warriors had the 35% true max deal on the table for him to sign on the dotted line."
"Oh so ur delusional and u can't read now?  Y'all won 3 titles...2 of those because you had Kevin Durant. And then the other one was the result of the Cavs having injuries to two all stars, and they still pushed y'all to 6, lmao.   These are all facts. Nothing to dispute"
Kevin Durant. He says he’s 6’11 but I’ve heard that all the 7 footers know he’s 7 foot something
"Holy shit, I went in with the whole ""fuck this egotistical cunt"" to leaving with immediate forgiveness.   This was really human of him, it was relatable and he took full responsibility. I really do wish the man the best in Brooklyn, nobody is perfect. Literally the BEST thing he could've said and I forgive and totally understand him.  Soooo.. FUCK Kevin Durant"
There's a bit of luck involved in every run to the title. Warriors benefited from Love/Kyrie injuries. Cavs benefited from Draymond suspension. Kevin Durant joins GS. Raptors benefit from KD injury.
This just in: Kevin Durant struggles with telling time. How will this affect his time management on the court?
"When I saw   &gt;SF Kevin Durant – Zapdos (Legendary long two’s baby, that’s the joke)  and  &gt;PG Stephen Curry – Moltres (Legendary 3’s, get it?)  I was expecting you finish off with something like   &gt;SG James Harden – Articuno (Legendary 1’s, har har)  Disappointed."
Kevin Durant is so damn unlikeable
"Would be curious to hear more on that.  Personal anecdote, I've seen Kevin Love in person numerous times when he was playing high school ball in Oregon.  He still looks enormous in person.  If you look across the board in the NBA, most power forwards pre-draft barefoot height is around 6'8.  Add the two inches for ""in shoes"" height that the NBA likes, and you get the more or less standard 6'10 listing.  With a few rare exceptions (KG, Durant) basically every NBA players height is their in shoes height."
1987 Magic Johnson  2008 Kobe Bryant  2017 Kevin Durant  2011 Dirk Nowitzki  1996 David Robinson  No team would have a sure chance to beat that team OP but I think this team would do well
&gt;Kevin Durant - Zapdos.  Something doesn’t seem right here.
"I think almost nobody is going to be as tall as we think they are. It is pretty standard practice in the league to measure with shoes on and then round up generously. Guys like Kevin Durant, who we think must be 7 feet tall because he's as tall as those other ""7 footers"" we know of, may really not be 7 feet because neither are the players we compare him to."
"Kevin Love, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, Tristan Thompson are who I’m looking forward to being dropped a couple of inches (or raised in KD’s case)."
"He already admitted he was recorded at near 6'11 with no shoes.   &gt; “Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6’10” and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I’m 7-feet,” Durant finally revealed. https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/"
Kevin Durant is an Ekans by definition
Imagine if you gave Kobe prime Klay/Draymond then added Kevin Durant
"Right, it's only when you either talk about his height or his cultural impact that he becomes amazing. In terms of his actual **on court impact**, he was definitely a great player, but he was much closer to guys like Carmelo Anthony or Vince Carter (minus the longevity) than he is to Kevin Garnett or Steph Curry or Kevin Durant."
"They're uninformed. He's been 6""9' ever since high school in 2006 when he came to play for UT [https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2006/kevin-durant-1668](https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2006/kevin-durant-1668)"
"Before Geography class, Kyrie Irving was on one side of the classroom and all the other Nets were on the other side being quiet. After Kyrie left, Kevin Durant took out his globe and all the other Nets started playing with a model solar system."
"Draymond Green on if he would still go up to Kevin Durant and ask if he could get his fiancée pregnant: ""It's unclear."""
The 7 footer that got drafted before Kevin Durant
How's he ever gonna be 6 foot 9 if the broken little bitch can't even stand on his own hahaha fuck Kevin Durant. Dude couldn't make It happen without joining literally the best team in history
"Position isn't defined by who you guard on defense. If Patrick Beverley is guarding Kevin Durant for long stretches, it doesn't all of a sudden make Bev a small forward."
"More so Lebron got lucky than teams gave up.  The best team to challenge him, the Bulls, had their best player get injured which knocked them out of contender status.   Then looking at top 10 draft talent from after Lebron got drafted that could challenge him.  Carmelo to the West, Wade/Bosh to East (but Lebron joined them), Dwight Howard East, Deron Williams/Chris Paul West, LaMarcus Aldridge/Brandon Roy West, Kevin Durant West, Derrick Rose East (Injured by 2012), Westbrook West, Love West (joined Lebron), Blake Griffin/James Harden/Stephen Curry West, John Wall/Paul George East, Gordon Hayward West, Kyrie Irving East (joined Lebron), Kemba Walker East, Anthony Davis West (joined Lebron), Damian Lillard West, Bradley Beal East, Oladipo East, McCollum West, Joel Embiid East, Karl-Anthony Towns West.  The majority of star talent went to the Western conference. The few East guys that were stars teamed up with Lebron. Super soft conference while Duncan, Kawhi, Curry, Dirk were fighting out of the West."
"Whether you believe it or not, Barnes is a quality SF. He does a little bit of everything well. He can post up, shoot the 3, get you a shot when the shot clock is running out, play good defense. And last year the only true small forward we had was Justin Jackson, who while I love, was inconsistent.   People act like you can just go get your own Kevin Durant or something. There is a finite number of good players at every position. Barnes is a good small forward, that is kinda rare in this league."
Yeah because the other dude was Kevin Durant...
Oden was one of the most hyped dudes of the past 20 years  We're talking about a man that deservedly got drafted over Kevin Durant - and it's not like KD was bad in college or came out of nowhere.
Kevin Durant fucking slouched. I don’t care what anyone says. This rule was to prevent people from lying “up” about their height. But it’s very easy to roll your shoulders and slouch to shave off some height.
Kevin Durant on if he would still drink Scarlett Johansson’s bathwater : “It’s unclear.”
It's the new Kevin Durant height
"&gt; Wait wtf.. So according to the new official heights Durant, Dwight Howard, Anthony Davis are all the same height??? Something fishy is going on.  Not if anyone was paying attention to the facts that have always been available: the draft combine measurements.   Here are their draft combine height without shoes:  [6'9"" Dwight Howard](https://stats.nba.com/draft/combine-anthro/#!?SeasonYear=2004-05)  [6'9"" Kevin Durant](https://stats.nba.com/draft/combine-anthro/#!?SeasonYear=2007-08)  [6'9.25"" Anthony Davis](https://stats.nba.com/draft/combine-anthro/#!?SeasonYear=2012-13)"
"Yes, 2010 and 2011 all NBA first team Kevin Durant wasn't close to being what her is now when Harden was traded in 2012...."
"Late round picks can’t “flop” lmao. Late round picks are expected be out of the league in three years. Any playability is a bonus. Draymond was a historic diamond in the rough.  Every role player we’ve signed recently has been a 1 year vet min or MLE due to cap restraints because we signed fucking Kevin Durant. End of bench quality or top 3 player? That was a tough choice. And even with that, Warriors managed to get solid production out of Zaza and West.  If y’all ever have the pleasure of signing Giannis to a super max, you’ll understand what sort of roster sacrifices are required."
[Looks pretty right](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/spains-marc-gasol-talks-to-usas-kevin-durant-during-their-news-photo/103539614)
I know it's dumb but does anyone else really not trust these things?  I'm supposed to believe Marc Gasol is almost 4 inches taller than Kevin Durant?
"Ok, and then add a top 15 all time player named Kevin Durant to that mix who was arguably the 1st/2nd best player on the planet at that time. Then you have a completely unfair team. Not to mention the Warriors bench was loaded in 2017, the 2011 Heat had Mike Bibby as their 4th best player and started a fucking d leaguer at Center. Get off Curry’s dick"
"Different times are hard to compare, but you're not quite correct. LeBron had only been in the league for a few seasons, but no one came close to the hype Oden had after LeBron was drafted. Social media wasn't as big, but he was featured in SLAM, Sports Illustrated, and he was the talk all over message boards. Kevin Durant was putting up incredible numbers at Texas and Oden was universally seen as the best player to draft.   Zion's hype is partly due to IG and YouTube because dunks. Obviously Zion is an incredible prospect in his own right, but Oden's potential was on another level."
"Interesting how the last table about the best single seasons according to RAPTOR is often the MVP predictor:  \*Note: Because the article only lists the 20 best including playoffs, elite regular seasons weighed down by bad playoff seasons may not appear on that top 20, so this table might not be entirely accurate.  |Year|Best REGULAR season according to RAPTOR|2nd Best REGULAR season according to RAPTOR (difference between 2nd best and best)|MVP that year| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |2014|Stephen Curry|**Kevin Durant** **(-0.1)**|Kevin Durant| |2015|**Stephen Curry**|Chris Paul (-0.5)|Stephen Curry| |2016|**Stephen Curry**|Draymond Green (-5.9)|Stephen Curry| |2017|Stephen Curry|James Harden (-0.4)|Russell Westbrook| |2018|**James Harden**|LeBron James (-4.6)|James Harden| |2019|James Harden|Paul George (-2.7)|Giannis Antetokounmpo|"
Literally googled KD and porzingis and this was the first link https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2821993-lowe-dont-think-kristaps-porzingis-was-psyched-to-play-with-kevin-durant
i remember reading about how the blazers viewed those two at the draft. they knew that kevin durant would be a perennial all star but they thought greg oden would help bring them multiple championships.   looking back the correct choice is obvious but oden was on track to be a monster before the injuries.
"Greg Oden was picked above Kevin fucking Durant for a reason, it's not like he didn't have any hype. While it wasn't on the level of Zion or LeBron my man def had hella hype"
For the curious:  1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Chris Paul 5. Draymond Green 6. Kevin Durant 7. Kawhi Leonard 8. Kyle Lowry 9. Paul George 10. Russell Westbrook 11. Jimmy Butler 12. Damian Lillard 13. Anthony Davis 14. Kemba Walker 15. Klay Thompson 16. Kevin Love 17. Nikola Jokic 18. Giannis Antetokounmpo 19. Kyrie Irving 20. Danny Green
"Exactly. If anything, I think Draymond is a perfect basketball example for this discussion. Drafted in the second round as an undersized power forward, no one expected him to end up an All Star. But he winds up playing for a team with Steph Curry, a perennial All Star, MVP candidate, and the best shooter of all time, along with Klay Thompson, another great shooter and perennial All Star. The last few years he also gets to play alongside Kevin Durant, who may go down as the best scorer of all time. To add to that, he’s playing for a great coach in a wide open system that allows him to show off his strengths (good defense and rebounding, great hustle) without asking him to be the man. Plus, the Warriors organization has shown to be a great place to play: they’ve been one of the pioneers in the use of data analytics, ownership has shown it is willing to spend to put together a championship caliber team, and they overall have a reputation for being player friendly.   Say instead Draymond goes to a dysfunctional situation like the Kings or Suns. Do we even know his name if that happens?"
"I had a go. There's a lot of players I have left out too.

Smh the disrespek to Kevin Wayne Durant
"2013 he was good  2012 he was outplayed by Kevin Durant but fortunately he had the better team. Yes prime LeBron wade and bosh beat 22 year old harden, 22 year old Westbrook and 23 year old kd"
"People in 1984 - “MVP Larry Bird or Potential superstar Michael Jordan, hmm what’s. tough choice”   People in 2003 - “MVP Tim Duncan or Teenager LeBron James, what a tough choice”  People in 2007 “MVP Dirk or Skinny teen Kevin Durant, what a tough choice”     Every great player is young at one point and besides LeBron James nobody has ever been as impressive at 19 years old than Luka doncic last year"
"&gt;""Even when I averaged almost 24 points and got the max deal, people were still saying stuff,"" he added. ""Look at max players and some max players don't average as much, but it is what it is. I'm just trying to get right, get back on track.""  This is the key passage I see. Basing his value on his PPG. If you are Kevin Durant, you can say screw it, you can't criticize me as long as I put up points. But if you aren't established as a star, you can't be basing your value on your PPG.  Jared Dudley sounds corny when he talks about how valuable all the little things he does are, but Wiggins could take a page out of his book. Starting gassing himself up over defensive rotations, setting screens, making good cuts, etc.  Some players just get hurt because they are told they are stars from a young age and so actually start to believe the BS that scoring is all that matters.

He ran into that full 90lbs Kevin Durant Wall
"&gt;&gt; So no, Klay didn’t die. But Buddy had a better shooting year than him. &gt; &gt;Let's not forget that Klay shot that percentage playing with Kevin Durant and Steph Curry to take away defensive pressure. Makes what Buddy did more impressive imo.  It works both ways I think, as in he was shooting like that WITH KD and Steph, I think this year he wouldve shot better, hopefully he can return to form when he gets back"
"I don't think you get it  It is not great shooting ability.  It is at the 98 percentile elite shooting ability  How many guys can you list that has a hair trigger, way beyond 3 pt distance,  run around screens (and can get 3 pt shot off) , has no conscious but also makes shots?  Right now  the only ones in this company is Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, Joe Harris, Kevin Durant, Devon Booker"
Ahem put some respek on the Brazilian Kevin Durant please.
"&gt; So no, Klay didn’t die. But Buddy had a better shooting year than him.  Let's not forget that Klay shot that percentage playing with Kevin Durant and Steph Curry to take away defensive pressure. Makes what Buddy did more impressive imo."
"??? How is it not ATLEAST in contention? Curry and Klay are the best three point shooting backcourt of all time. Klay is a great defender. Kevin Durant. Iggy, fantastic on baller defender and perfect glue guy. Dray, not only a DPOY level defender, he’s capable of playmaking."
"&gt; a radiant Kevin Durant  &gt; Rockets &amp; Blazers red in the face  &gt; Curry &amp; Green are glowing  &gt; Raptors are heating up  &gt; meltdown of the Warriors  some people might say this was too much...don't listen to them. Beautiful, champ."
"""AD has always been a top 5 player""  What, even when he was six?  Also: Nah.  In no particular order:  LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant is six players who are better without taking more than thirty seconds to think about it."
Nets flair since July 7th...i choose to believe this is actually Kevin Durant .

Do they get 3 years with Kevin Durant too?
what a dumb comment. isaiah thomas had a historically great offensive season and wasn't fortunate enough to play with kevin durant
I’m arguing they don’t apply because the volume isn’t even. Your entire argument is that because harden shoots more he’s better. Mine is Steph had to play with Klay and Kevin Durant. Who here do you think has the better argument? You can say I’m biased all you want but I’m not the one just saying shit just to be saying it. And there’s literally no aspect of basketball where harden is superior to Steph Curry other than getting to the free throw line. Numbers(specifically ones that regard efficiency) will prove that but you coincidentally don’t care about those.
"&gt; Like KDs playoff shooting percentages jumped 12.5% with GS, bro tack on that % to PGs and look at how incredible his numbers would be, put it on ANY all stars playoff numbers.  Kevin Durant is arguably the GOAT-scorer and one of the best shooters regardless of who is on his team. Durant is an all-time great and right at or already in the top 15 players of all-time.   His efficiency was elite at OKC despite being surrounded by non-shooters in a bad system. It just went up when he was surrounded by two more all-time great shooters and a better system and coach."
"Lmao not remotely true.  * 2007: Massive underdogs, no one expected them to win, they didn't.  LeBron was 22, Jordan didn't make his first finals until he was 27. * 2011: The only one where LeBron actually played poorly * 2014: LeBron led his team in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, and was 2nd in Blocks. He shot over 50% from 3, had a truly insane shooting performance w/ a TS% of 68%  (I *believe* that's the most efficient high scoring finals performance in history, someone can check me on that) * 2015: Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving both injured.  Cavs played a 6 man rotation.  LeBron averaged 36 / 13 / 9 for the series and averaged 45.7 MPG. * 2017, 2018: Kevin Durant was on the Warriors."
same with kevin and durant
&gt;Everyone knew Bron and James were just at the cusp so were kevin and durant
"2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"Before this they had Kevin Durant, Healthy Klay, Andre, Jerebko, Livingston, Quinn cook, Boogie. That’s a lot of good players and vets"

Kevin Durant for Andrew Wiggins would be a huge W for Minnesota
Kevin durant
That’s what happens when you win 73 games one year and then add Kevin Durant for the next 3. +/- goes up
"Who was the better player, Prime Kobe or Prime Kevin Durant ignoring accolades."
"""I don’t want to get into a [...] feud with Kevin Durant but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" Morey said on the Durant quote. ""So many people could have been harmed not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So, just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though yes we do have freedom of speech but it can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too."" Morey added Durant’s quote was dangerous. Morey said he is uncertain about the future ramifications of the Durant quote with the NBA and 538."
kevin durant would be the clear winner in a 1 on 1 tournament. everyone else is fighting for second.
Kevin Durant has such a huge opportunity...
Just Kevin Durant as far as I am aware.
he's talking to Kevin Durant lol
Who the fuck wants to hear anything from a guy who couldn't get it done without joining literally the best team in history? Fuck Kevin Durant lmao
Kevin Durant is about to lead a Hong Kong protest and complete the greatest heel-to-face turn in the history of sports.
Dwight has a better looking body every season.  A good looking basketball body would be like Kevin Durant.
"What? Yes, absolutely when he shoots the ball is out of reach for almost every nba player. Youtube Kobe guarding kevin durant."
Kevin Durant aka Top 5 Nike athlete
"&gt; Another is Kevin Durant doing the electric slide out of bounds to save the ball   I pride myself on being composed and reasonable during sporting events, and when that play happened, my initial reaction was fucking luncay lol. to the point where the next day my wife was like, *""dude maybe you need to stop watching basketball at this point""*  it was worth it for the harden game winner though. that was better than sex"
Probably not the worst  But the first one that comes to my mind is when Giannis went out of bounds for the game winner against OKC last season  Another is Kevin Durant doing the electric slide out of bounds to save the ball
Why do people act like Kevin Durant not being there is the only factor in the Warriors potentially missing the playoffs?
*Durant would never do something so weak.*  - Kevin Durant’s burner account
Didn't people saying Kevin Durant joined the exact same 73-9 roster that defeated him?
"The role players and depth they sacrificed to sign Kevin Durant.  All gone, and now KD is too."
"Well, it’s not just Kevin Durant. It’s also all the quality role players they had and Klay is hurt."
"Imagine being Kevin Durant and working hard day in and day out for 3 years to be unlikable person the league, and LeBron just waltzes in and does so in an afternoon"
Kevin Durant is in a dark room on his phone watching Bron's Twitter feed and wiping the drool from his face right now
"&gt;I didn't go there to make my life easier every day. I didn't so I could stop getting up at 8:30 and try to be the first one on the court. I didn't go there to walk into every game and be satisfied if I have 20 points and shoot 30 percent from the field. That's just like, in my DNA, that's just like my blood, that's what wakes me up. I can't stand when somebody discredits the work. Like, I actually did that. I actually put that in. Don't take that away from me.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-on-joining-warriors-i-didnt-go-there-to-make-my-life-easier/"
"but, I think the warriors had like 5 players that were either top 15 or lottery draft picks, and the raptors had 0. The warriors had, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Kevin durant, Andrew Bogut, and DeMarcus Cousins. That's almost unheard of. I think the Cavs had a lot at one time as well."
"the warriors are like 8-10 in the finals without Kevin Durant. They are a year older, I don't see how they would be the favorites."
"And still probably won't treat him as poorly as they do Kevin Durant.  Because actively standing up for the Chinese government isn't as bad as wanting to win a few easy rings while having fun on a historically awesome team, and occasionally talking shit back to people on social media.  That would just be unforgivable."
Kevin Durant. Crustiest guy in the league
"if handchecking/physical defense is allowed, durant.  if not, kobe.  yes kobe is great but hes not going to be as efficient as jordan/lebron getting to the rim every play or a 6""11 kevin durant."
Oh and don't forget that the team they faced in the Finals lost Kevin Durant for essentially the whole series and Klay Thompson for a considerable portion. The fuck is this guy on
"I’m a Bron stan but if there’s two people I fear going against Lebron , it’s this man and Kevin Durant. I just have a weird feeling that this dude is gonna destroy the league this year, he just seems like he’s in such a all time offensive rhythm and nobody could stop him."
"If you lack perspective, sure. You rank players based on imaginary factors like clutch gene and isolate the last five minutes of a game from the other forty three as if they just evaporate into thin air. Toronto, one of the greatest defensive teams in NBA playoff history, being able to sell out on stopping Curry because everyone else on the court is a non shooter has more to do with the offense tapering off down the stretch. If the Warriors had even decent shooters on the floor the offense would have looked substantially better. The last time we saw Kevin Durant have to deal with a defense that threw doubles and triples at him the Thunder lost a 3-1 lead and he decided to join the Warriors so he could see less defensive attention. His words. Imagine using him as an example in this context.  You just said that FVV and Lowry were made to look like hall of famers because of Steph while providing zero evidence of your own to back up that statement. I give you evidence to the contrary and you refute it. Classic strat. You know Kawhi was guarding Andre Iguodala more than anyone else on the Warriors? Was it because he can't guard Draymond, Klay, Curry or because the Raptors don't want their offensive anchor chasing guys around picks all day."
I mean their bench was trash last year but they were just fine because they had Kevin freaking Durant lol.

The Warriors were not *better* without KD, but they played a better style vs. the Rockets and the Rockets only.

Couldn't adjust.)"
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Jimmy Butler, Chris Paul, and a lot of the other more successful playoff performers in recent years all make a killing in the midrange.   Houston Rockets continue to ignore all of that to shoot 2-16 from three."

"Did anyone actually need to hear him say this? I thought it was pretty definitive at the time that Kevin would walk in free agency given Draymond's arrogance. The guy was on the phone crying to Durant after losing to Cleveland in 7 and then goes at him a couple years later as if he wasn't needed. Oh, hello Draymond's spit, i'd like to introduce you to Kevin's face... Cold reality will slowly sink in like a knife now over the next several years as Green realizes his 15 minutes are up. He did get a max contract out of it though so"
I think he said it in an interview how he was impressed by the Celtics and it was really close. You can google it and a bunch of stuff comes up but it’s a clutter.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/nesn.com/2016/11/kevin-durant-free-agency-redux-how-close-were-celtics-to-landing-warriors-star/amp/

It almost worked, too — Durant admitted he was “ready to just say, ‘OK. Let’s go'” after meeting with TB12.  Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck believed the team “lost in the finals” of the Durant sweepstakes. Al Horford, Boston’s free agent consolation prize, admitted Durant told him he “definitely considered” joining the C’s after Horford signed with the team"
"no shit lol MAN if we had the pieces to keep Ben, Jo, some wing defenders, and Michael Jordan in his prime I would totally do that. And also Kevin Durant and Jesus"
Why does this make me think it would have been cool to see them play with Kevin Durant? oh yea and throw Serge Ibaka as well as a stretch big and rim protector.
Kevin Durant
"Idk about that, KD has always loved Kyrie, and the way he views basketball and hates analytics i think he legit thinks Kyrie is top5   He said it when he was on the Warriors  &gt;“Kyrie’s the most skilled player – well, top three most skilled players in the league in my opinion, one of the most skilled players to ever play,” Kevin Durant told reporters at practice Friday.   https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2018/01/26/kevin-durant-kyrie-irvings-one-of-the-most-skilled-players-ever/"
"All the news outlets are probably pissed he said this. Now they can't release news articles every few weeks about ""IS KEVIN DURANT COMING BACK THIS SZN?"""

Cameroonian Kevin Durant
"Awhile ago I’ve read an interesting article that says that KD actually tries to deliberately expand his horizon. This impulse came to him after his major injury with OKC and having too much time on his hand, while not being able to play hoop.  &gt; With what he craved most -- shooting hoops -- still forbidden, he surveyed his landscape and realized his world needed a jolt of reality. For the first time in his life, he would venture out of his basketball bubble. ""Basketball was out,"" he says. ""So I thought, Let me go out and see this world I'm in.""

Lets go inside the mind of a Kevin Durant... brrrrrrr
Time for the reddit mindreaders to come out and try to understand the psyche of Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant does not care what people think about him.
Lebron doesn't just raise the floor.  When he is healthy he puts picks up the entire building and puts it on a mountain.  The only reason he doesn't have more championships right now is Kevin Durant decided to join the Warriors.
He went from fanboying Kevin Durant to Kawhi Leonard
So does Kevin Durant have to act like Tim Duncan or am I missing something?
"It's weird to me that people keep trying to make the point that the Warriors somehow ""sold their souls."" Kevin Durant was a free agent that was signed under the salary cap in place. There was literally zero foul play.   The Los Angeles Clippers just acquired a player that had just wrapped up year one of a 5 year max contract and a borderline MVP season. The player literally forced himself out after robbing OKC blind. It's very clearly and obviously the shittiest thing a player has done to a team in a long time. But lets focus on KD, the player that decided on his own, in a contract year, to join a loaded team and get rings.   Somehow, I don't think the anger and vitriol will be anywhere near what it was for the Warriors should the Clippers dominate the next 3-5 years."
"Did you just *unironically* say the Warriors ""can't catch a break""  After their injury prone Curry comes around and turns into the greatest shooter in history, giving a rign and another finals on a bargain contract, then they lock in Durant before resigning Curry to a Suoermax?   While Klay sits around on his *own* bargain contract in the meantime?  While Green assaults people over and over without getting the 10 and 20 game suspensions he deserves?   Oh did I already mention a cap bump that let's them sign *Kevin Durant* when they were already a 73 win team?"
"&gt; Why does everything Kevin touch die?  Kevin ""Midas Touch"" Durant."
cough cough Kevin Durant!
"Here's what I'm saying:    A 6'7"" version of Kevin Durant would still be an All-Star in the league, because Durant is a ball player. He's got basketball skills at any height.    Do you think a 6'7"" version of Giannis would still be an All-Star? Ima say hell no. If he can no longer do his euro step from half court every play, he would be an absolute laughing stock on offense, just like Andre Roberson is. Yeah man of course he shoots 58 percent -- all his shots are like 5 feet from the basket! lol, a result of his pterodactyl frame and athleticism. If he lost 4 inches he would be screwed, because he doesn't have the skills.    tl;dr   6'7"" Kevin Durant would still be an NBA All-Star because he's a ball player.   6'7"" Giannis might not even be a starter in the NBA."
No. I literally just said that I'm not counting kevin durant because hes injured why would I count blake(a great player dont get me wrong) who also is injured.

"I mean looking at your post history it's obvious you just like to talk shit for no good reason and never really back up your talk so let's give you a chance.

I thought Kevin Durant said there was a system. Sorry Dubs fans it's just too funny.
Just a reminder that Raptors fans booed Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant getting injured in the finals.   You can't talk about how to behave in a series.
Thunder fans are still talking about Kevin Durant?

Pascal spacejammed kevin Durant. What the heck
"Pat is a steal of a deal for any team and definitely not overrated. A lot of those ""better"" defenders you mentioned are supermax players and a few aren't even guards. Pat is comparable with all those players numbers wise while allowing the Clippers to invest heavily on two supermax players who play a variety of positions, build a effective bench and keep key assets. No way to build a roster like that with supermax guards and definitely not going to work if you want to invest in only forwards. Pat even agreed to take less money to play for the Clippers which no other player on that list has ever done or would demonstrating his commitment to the team. Pat is a great locker room presence, hypes his team up to play defense and helps build the identify of the team. Pat can also handle mismatches like none of those players. Even Klay is going to give up a drive from Embiid or Giannis but Pat is going to step up and try to take the charge while continually pestering even Kevin Durant on entry passes while attempting to challenge every shot he is near."
but kevin durant played better during his finals mvps than lebron did when he won his in miami. also curry came very close during 2/3 rings and shouldve won one.
youd be hard pressed to find ANYBODY who could win a finals mvp over kevin durant. especially the way he played in the finals.
Kevin Durant and LeBron have gone their whole career without demanding a trade? What point are you getting at?
Kevin Durant and LeBron spent 7+ years doing that before changing teams.

"Let's be honest, Kevin Durant doesn't know what winning a real championship feels like either. One that you earned."
"**PG:** Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo.    **SG:** JR Smith, Nick Young, Dion Waiters.    **SF:** Kevin Durant., Jimmy Butler, Lance Stephenson.    **PF:** Carmelo Anthony    **C:** Dwight Howard"
"You're right. Klay's 24.7 PPG on 54.5 TS% helped the Warriors win that series more than Steph's 27.9 PPG on 61.2 TS%.   Kevin Durant showed just how dominant he was without Steph in that series, averaging 30.0 PPG on a very high 53.9 TS%. And Russell Westbrook of course proved himself better than Curry in that series with his 26.7 PPG on 50.9 TS%."
"Kobe Bryant smiled when Dwight Howard’s name came up during a recent conversation. Time has a way of smoothing over differences, and Bryant, who has transitioned into the world of storytelling since retiring in 2016, is fascinated by the narrative arc of his former Lakers teammate.  Howard first came to the Lakers in 2012 with the expectation of being the next great Lakers big man and helping Bryant win a sixth championship. But their lone season together quickly turned into a nightmare so horrible that Howard took less money to bolt to Houston. The Lakers have failed to make the playoffs since.  He came back this offseason on a one-year, non-guaranteed contract. Seven years after joining the Lakers as one of the best players in the league, he returned as a journeyman on his fifth team in five years. But Howard has proven to be a pleasant surprise early this season. On Sunday, he helped the Lakers to a 120-101 win over the Charlotte Hornets with 16 points on eight-for-eight shooting, 10 rebounds and four blocks. He was plus-23 in his 23 minutes on the floor and received loud ovations from the crowd at Staples Center, which was unthinkable just a few months ago.  “I’m happy for him because sometimes we don’t realize how much we love the game and miss the game until that window starts closing or its closed,” Bryant said. “Then you’re like, ‘Oh damn, I really miss playing the game. I want another opportunity to show what I can do.’ Sometimes you don’t know if that opportunity will ever come again. For him, I really believe he’s appreciative of the opportunity and I think he’s going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.”  Howard is the only player on the current Lakers team that Bryant was teammates with during his 20-year NBA career. As much as that 2012-13 season is remembered for being a colossal failure, Bryant still believes they could have made noise in the postseason had he not suffered a torn Achilles tendon near the end of the season.  After going 17-25 through the first 42 games, the Lakers went 28-12 and finished the regular season with a record of 45-37, earning the seventh seed in the playoffs. However, without Bryant they were swept in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs.  “In all fairness, the second half of the season when I tore my Achilles, we had the best record in the league,” Bryant said. “We had to make things more contentious than I wanted to, but the object is to win. Unfortunately, I tore my Achilles and that sidetracked everything, but that second half of the season there wasn’t a team in the Western Conference that wanted to play us when we were healthy. Maybe things would’ve been different with Dwight if we were healthy and had made a run. Who knows?”  Injuries defined this NBA season before it even began. Kevin Durant (ruptured Achilles) and Klay Thompson (torn anterior cruciate ligament) were essentially shelved for this season in June, and their former Warriors teammate DeMarcus Cousins (torn ACL) joined them on the sideline soon after signing with the Lakers. Cousins’ injury opened the door for Howard’s unlikely return to the Lakers in August.  “The place where the league is at right now is awesome,” Bryant said. “K.D.’s injury literally changed the landscape of the game, and now you have a lot of duos that are in different places. There are a lot of great story lines to follow and there are a lot of questions you don’t know the answers to, which creates an interesting season. It’s like watching a good film. You don’t know what’s going to happen, but it’s a hell of a time for L.A.”  Howard has often been described as a “big kid” by coaches and teammates, and Bryant realizes the tough love he often dished out on Howard fell flat. Howard acknowledges he hated Bryant for years — for calling him “soft,” among other things. It’s a lesson Bryant takes with him as he now coaches youth sports.  “If we as coaches are not conscious of [our impact] we can do a lot of damage to kids with the roll of the eyes or something we yell, but we can also help them in a really positive way,” Bryant said. “It’s something a lot of people don’t take seriously because it’s sports, but it takes a lot of care. I look at it from that standpoint. That’s why I love working with young kids because it’s an opportunity to not only prepare them for the game but put them on the path to prepare them for life and the struggles that will inevitably come their way.”"
Washed up Iverson (still a huge name though) and prime Deron Williams played at Besiktas. Streets did not set on fire then.   Iverson got a big greeting at the airport though but you still overestimate the interest at basketball. Besiktas fans won’t burn down the city over Kevin Durant coming at age whatever. Not even close. That could only happen if Besiktas wins EuroLeague.
"idk i guess now he's LA famous.    honestly a lot of ppl underrated him for a long time. the first example that comes to mind is Colin Cowherd, who said last year ""Kawhi is the most overrated player in the league, dont put him on the same tier as Kevin Durant."""
"Counter point: very few people are freaks of nature like Kevin Durant who are nearly 7 feet tall with a 15 foot wing span to shoot over damn near everyone with ease. Dude is one of the greatest offensive weapons in history, he will adapt"
Fun fact: Kevin Durant used his fake account to troll Chris Boucher when he was a rookie on the Warriors.
"Lmao. Curry didn’t cook the Cavs in 2015, he didn’t even play well enough to get Finals mvp. Lmao Lebron led all teams in stats and +/- in 2016 but ok 😂😂😂. Durant was definitely better than Curry in 2017/18, as was Lebron.  Curry hasn’t won the finals without facing a team with two injured all-stars or without Kevin Durant on his team, and he won’t win another."
Harden actually only has 4 such games. Here's everyone with 3 or more:      19: Moses Malone     13: Dolph Schayes     9: Karl Malone     8: Adrian Dantley     7: Kevin Durant     7: Jerry West     6: Dwyane Wade     6: Bob Pettit     5: Richie Guerin     5: Paul Pierce     5: Oscar Robertson     4: Dominique Wilkins     4: Kobe Bryant     4: James Harden     4: Kevin Johnson     4: Lenny Wilkens     4: Corey Maggette     3: LeBron James     3: Tiny Archibald     3: Gilbert Arenas     3: Carmelo Anthony     3: Larry Foust     3: Russell Westbrook     3: Allen Iverson     3: Kevin Martin     3: George Mikan     3: Jimmy Butler     3: Tom Chambers
"June 30th to about July 5th is crazier  On June 30th, I was at Walmart and decided to quickly post, saying ""Kevin Durant will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies"". I put my phone down for a minute and came back and saw 60 upvotes, about as many comments, and the post had been removed already."
Trade him to the western conference.... The bulk ofo the best players are over there. Kevin Durant certainly thinks he is good. He went to Brooklyn to play with him.
"He averaged 36,7,8 on the same efficient as Kevin Durant in their series last year....  If he didn't have to run into the greatest team ever made he would be a champion already...   #HardenGang"
"yes, kevin durant just did this. lebron did this when he opted out the first time in cleveland, a lot of other examples. but they have to agree to it"
"People legit say stuff like this about Kawhi and PG when just a few months ago we saw a team with Klay, Steph, DeMarcus, Draymond, and Kevin Durant not win a title lol"
"So I decided to actually look them up on Basketball Reference. These are career stats:  LeBron James, Regular --&gt; Postseason: eFG% 54 --&gt; 53; TS% 59 --&gt; 58; PPG 27 --&gt; 29  Kevin Durant, Regular --&gt; Postseason: eFG% 54 --&gt; 53; TS% 61 --&gt; 60; PPG 27 --&gt; 29  Kawhi Leonard, Regular --&gt; Postseason: eFG% 55 --&gt; 57; TS% 60 --&gt; 62; PPG 18 --&gt; 20  James Harden, Regular --&gt; Postseason: eFG% 44 --&gt; 49; TS% 61 --&gt; 58; PPG 25 --&gt; 23  Paul George, Regular --&gt; Postseason: eFG% 51 --&gt; 50; TS% 56 --&gt; 56; PPG 20 --&gt; 20  PG's only dip is in eFG%, but LeBron and KD both have the exact same dip. I don't see evidence to support your arguments."
I agree.   Everybody shits on him for not beating  a 73 win team that added Kevin durant but where is literally everybody else in the fucking league? Either sitting at home watching or in Cleveland waiting to get blown out by the warriors in the finals
"when we’re talking all tome players “average” never means average for a regular player. i’m taking average for kevin durant. it’s not a “little less efficient for him”   Kd had one run where he was excellent. every other run he simply was not.   go look at from 2012-16 , his average TS in the RS was .635 , playoffs? .560 , that’s a HUGE DROP. in 2016 it was .540 in the playoffs and he blamed everyone else for losing"
"I'm still waiting on the reverse circlejerk  where people will learn to appreciate that they are watching one of the most offensively talented players to ever play. He absolutely shatters my ""Kevin Durant test"" on judging a players scoring prowess. It shouldn't be possible for you to check players stat sheet night after night and see 40+ and just shrug because it's so common. It's not even an event anymore with him. ""Oh Harden dropped 59? That sounds about right."""
"https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dwlliz/oc_detailed_discussion_of_james_harden_as_a/  'Here’s the interesting thing: Harden is the only player to have been top 5 in scoring every year since 2012. Lebron James was top 5 every year up until 2019, when he didn’t appear in the playoffs. I assume he would have been top 5 again if he played, of course. Kevin Durant also made the top 5 spots for 6 out of those 7 years, with 2015 being his exception.  Not only that, though: Harden is the only player to have averaged 26 or more ppg in the playoffs every year since 2012. This might sound like a cherrypicked stat, but I chose 26 because that was Harden’s lowest scoring average since 2012 (technically his lowest was 26.3, but I wanted to give the league a chance). Admittedly, Durant would have been in this club if he’d played in the 2015 playoffs. He averaged 26+ every other year since 2012. Lebron averaged 26+ every year but 2013…when he averaged 25.9. If he’d played in the 2019 playoffs, I suspect he’d be in this club as well.  In other words, the only players to display comparable consistency in playoff scoring to Harden are Lebron and KD. Even then, Harden has shown that level of consistency one year more than those two all-time great playoff performers. Just for reference, even Kareem never averaged 25+ ppg in the playoffs for 7 years in a row (http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/baeDS).  By the way, Harden also made top five for assists per game in 2015, 2016, and 2017 (alongside Lebron, who made top five all those years and more).'   I haven't doubled checked any of this, so don't call me out on the validity or lack there of"
Looks like Kevin Durant/Greg Oden 2.0 at this point (sorry zion)
"I’m still not understanding this take? Kevin Durant is easily the 2nd best in the league, and he’s still a good margin away from Lebron."
"&gt;Kevin Durant will come back next season and Kyrie will be the second option.   &gt;   &gt;The nets will start to win games because Kyrie isn't taking on that self appointed leader role anymore.  Kyrie will get pissy and demand a trade because he wants to be the leader of the team. Because he thinks he's a great leader.  Seriously, I could see Kyrie causing issues in Boston as soon as he was traded there. Tried to warn Celtics fans, but they buried me in downvotes, so I enjoyed seeing their hopes go up in smoke last season.   What else can you expect from someone who put up empty stats for 3 years before Lebron joined. Lebron joined and they got successful, won a title. Sure, he contributed, but even then each time Lebron was out, Kyrie couldn't win. Winning % without Lebron was shit. Winning % without Kyrie was still great. After 3 consecutive finals, he demands a trade. I guess he got tired of all that winning.  He's the Stephon Marbury of this era, less selfish but more stupid."
"Yep, basically that.  He's on 25th per [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/511690-kevin-durant-and-the-real-best-nba-scorers-ever-minute-by-minute#slide28)"
"Yeah, fuck Harden for not being able to beat Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green with role players. What a bum."
"not if that one ring is more impressive than any of steph's  steph has won one ring as the best player on his team, and that was against a team without 2 of their 3 best players and he *still* only won in 6 games. and didnt win finals mvp.  then he had a historically bad choke in the next finals, putting up an inefficient 17 pts in the biggest game of his life. that was the only finals series of his career with mostly healthy teams and him being the best player on his team, and he lost.  then kevin durant came and won two finals mvps with steph as the #2  the bar isnt terribly high for harden to beat lol"
"&gt;I think Kevin Durant was better last year  Ok, why?"
Basically lebron has longevity over kawhi. Kawhi was a late bloomer and is younger. But kawhi also has to tone it down in the regular season due to his degenerative condition. Last playoffs kawhi was on that best player in the playoffs level along with James harden and Kevin Durant.
"I think LeBron is still the best player too, and I think Kevin Durant was better last year though i do not see that happening again because of his injury"
PG: Russell Westbrook SG: James Harden SF: Kevin Durant PF: Serge Ibaka C: Kendrick Perkins
"* First he'll say how he can't wait to build a Nets dynasty, and how he wants to retire a Net.   * He'll play really well statistically despite the losses.   * Basketball nerds and reddit users will look at his stats and wonder why they aren't winning without watching the games.   * They'll assume it's because their defense is just bad and nothing else.   * Then he'll take on the self appointed leader title and start barking at the other guys that were there before him.   * He'll alienate the other players when they don't perform up to his standards.  * At some point he'll say something really dumb in an interview to throw his teammates under the bus.   * He'll still keep putting up empty stats that reddit users and nerds love to look at (he's 3rd in the league in overall +- and 4th in scoring efficiency!!) and continue to not watch games or pay attention to the chemistry of the team.   * The nets will either miss the playoffs or be an early out and Kyrie will be chucking the ball with little care during those games and still up up 30 points.   * Kevin Durant will come back next season and Kyrie will be the second option.  * The nets will start to win games because Kyrie isn't taking on that self appointed leader role anymore.  * Nerds will point to the same stats as last year and credit him for their wins.   * After a few years of no titles he'll either demand a trade or retire early."
Well that settles it folks. Throw TS% out the window and use a worse metric because Kevin Durant said so.
"True shooting is flawed, inflated by free throws but you know stats aren’t everything right? i hope you watch the games instead of looking at numbers all day. if you’re looking at just numbers then why not just say Wilt Chamberlain is the greatest offensive player ever by far since he put up the best scoring numbers. games aren’t played on paper, Kevin Durant is still the more skilled scorer, maybe be the best ever at it. i’ll take him over harden any day of the week &amp; saying harden’s the best scorer of our era right now is not true, if you’re actually watching games and not balls deep in the stat sheet"
"Steph, Klay, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
" Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."

"100% that’s the reason    His plan worked though sadly. People give him real credit for winning those titles for some reason    He has never actually earned any of his rings and literally took a road that leads to free rings back in 2016. We all knew he literally just wanted free rings so everybody said his rings will never mean nothing because he joined an already established  73 win core that was fresh of b2b finals and a title the year before. We all said they would win the next bunch of titles and .... they did    They cruised through the 2017 and they were so much better than anybody it was ridiculous. Replace the weakest player in the starting lineup of a 73 win team with Kevin durant and who knew they would dominate.   In 2018 Kevin Durant and his all time great team still almost lost to James Hardens team who everybody shits on for being a choker though he was that close to beating this juggernaut   In 2019 he got injured in round 2 and everybody counted his warriors out.... but that 73 win core showed out by taking care of the rockets in game 6, SWEEPING the blazers and despite a Klay Thompson injury they get it super close in the finals till the end. In my heart of hearts I know that if Klay isn’t injured in game 2 or the end of game 6 then this is a 7 game series and who knows what could have happened.    This is maybe the best team in basketball healthy without KD and yet people give him credit for those rings.    He shouldn’t have left honestly. Seeing comments nowadays where people use KDs rings in arguments vs players like James Harden and Karl Malone is just sad to see."

"Rockets fan here. I have a comment. Karma for what? Drafting two of the best shooters the NBA has ever seen? Making one of the biggest free agency moves of this decade by signing Kevin Durant? I don’t know if you remember how the warriors used to be, but before ‘15, they hadn’t won a championship in 40 years. From 1994-2006, they finished in the bottom 5 in the west and never made the playoffs, up until ‘06 (the ‘We Believe’ season when they beat the top seeded Mavs as a bottom seed.) Years of mediocrity and no playoffs led to Kerr being hired. He led them to the top, and kept them there. For 4 of the last 5 seasons, the warriors finished 1st in the West, including a 73-9 season, before KD had shown up. I’m not a warriors fan, but I am a huge fan of an underdog that is able to rise from nothing into something. I don’t like to see good teams fall apart and become nothing, but that’s just the cycle of how things go in sports. No team is going to get to the top and stay there forever. Better teams will come along and the balances of power will shift to more teams (Clippers, Lakers, Rockets in the West; Celtics, Raptors, Bucks, Nets in the East).  I’m not calling you stupid or anything, just recommending you do some research before hating on a team that is successful. I’m assuming you hate the patriots as well."

Here’s the forgotten history of a blockbuster move older than some of the players involved. By Ben Cohen Nov. 15, 2019 8:01 am ET SHARE TEXT 9 RESPONSES The long-forgotten deal that altered the course of NBA history decades later almost didn’t happen.  The clock was ticking on the Seattle SuperSonics to make their first-round pick in the 1997 draft, and only at the last possible moment did they agree to move down nine spots in exchange for the Denver Nuggets’ second-round pick in 1998.  “That trade went down to 5 or 10 seconds left,” said Wally Walker, the former Sonics general manager. “It was as big a game of timing chicken as I’ve experienced.”  It turned out to be fortunate that Walker didn’t blink. Those five seconds would change the future of the league.  That seemingly trivial swap is the reason the Los Angeles Clippers were able to acquire Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder more than two decades later as they also signed Kawhi Leonard and shifted the NBA’s balance of power one night last summer. It also allowed the team formerly known as the Sonics to secure one of the greatest trade hauls of all time: two promising players and possibly seven first-round draft picks.  “Whoa,” Walker said. “How about that?”  The most fascinating trade in recent memory is a window into how NBA teams get built over time and how even basketball assets can appreciate in ways that nobody could have anticipated. This was a blockbuster deal that might determine the league’s next champion in Los Angeles and produced an unprecedented bounty for Oklahoma City. And it began so long ago that it predates the careers—and even the lives—of the players and executives involved.  Thunder general manager Sam Presti was in college. George was in elementary school. Oklahoma City guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander wasn’t even born yet.  The 30-Year NBA Trade It started with that innocuous trade in 1997. It continued when Walker used his 1998 second-round pick on a high-schooler named Rashard Lewis who blossomed into an All-Star. And then it was dormant until 2007.  That’s when the Sonics hired a 29-year-old general manager. His name was Sam Presti.  “I am not sure I was thinking about much other than trying to act like I knew what I was doing and just making my way to the end of each day,” Presti said.  Lewis was entering free agency ready to command a huge salary, and the Sonics weren’t paying to keep him as they were rebuilding. But when Lewis struck a deal with the Orlando Magic, the Sonics also didn’t want to let him walk for nothing. Presti devised an inventive way to split the difference.  He convinced Lewis to sign with the Sonics—so they could immediately trade him to the Magic.  It was a win-win-win scenario. Lewis made nearly $15 million more, the Magic secured an extra year on his contract and the Sonics generated an equally useful “traded player exception” worth about $9.5 million. This was a groundbreaking idea for a time before general managers were seen as mad scientists in the superhero universe of the NBA. The average fan didn’t know who they were, what they did or why anyone should pay attention to their creative salary-cap maneuvering.  How long ago was 2007? Presti remembers being awed that Lewis had a mindblowing new gadget. It was the iPhone.  But even then, the smartest way to build a sports team was to search for value where nobody was looking, and the market inefficiency of the moment was the systemic misvaluation of draft picks. The Sonics decided to become hoarders. They collected draft picks because they understood it was an inherently risky strategy—and they were right. Presti whiffed on a draft pick named Rodrigue Beaubois, for example, and it didn’t matter because he also hit on Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden in 2007, 2008 and 2009.   He plucked those superstars with Seattle’s own picks. But he also nailed one more pick in the middle of this spectacular run that originally belonged to another team—and Presti had Rashard Lewis to thank for it.  The Sonics hadn’t wasted their pile of cash on a player to make their bad team marginally better. They used their $9.5 million to accumulate even more draft picks. When the Phoenix Suns were looking to dump salary in July 2007, Seattle had space to absorb the expiring contract of Kurt Thomas. But to get rid of the basketball equivalent of a toxic asset, the Suns would have to attach two first-round picks.  The executive on the other side of the trade is no longer the general manager of the Suns. He’s now the coach of the Golden State Warriors.  “Oh my god,” Steve Kerr said. “What’s the six degrees of separation—Kevin Bacon? Kurt Thomas is now a Kevin Bacon.”  The Kevin Bacon of the NBA was traded again seven months later for another draft pick. By now Presti had turned Rashard Lewis—a player he wasn’t going to sign—into 2008, 2009 and 2010 first-rounders. It was time to turn his picks into human beings.  The first pick in his stash was the No. 24 spot in 2008. Presti drafted Serge Ibaka. Eight years later, after the Sonics had become the Thunder, Ibaka was a productive NBA player with one year left on his contract. Presti maximized his remaining value by sending him to Orlando in 2016 for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis.  Oladipo and Sabonis spent one season with the Thunder. Then they were flipped in stunning fashion in 2017 for Paul George.  Now one All-Star who was going to leave Seattle had become another All-Star who otherwise wouldn’t have come to Oklahoma City.  Kurt Thomas is now a Kevin Bacon.—Steve Kerr The pairing of George and Westbrook didn’t work out the way the Thunder envisioned, but it helped persuade Westbrook to stay when Durant left and sold George on signing a long-term deal in 2018. The Thunder banked on having both for the primes of their careers. They did not anticipate George asking out last summer to play with Leonard.  This put the Thunder in an odd position. Even though their best player was basically demanding a trade, they also knew the Clippers were desperate to keep Leonard away from the rival Lakers. Suddenly the Thunder had extraordinary leverage.  They were able to extract a remarkable price for one player: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Danilo Gallinari, the Miami Heat’s first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, the Clippers’ first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and the right to swap picks with the Clippers in 2023 and 2025.  What was once a 1998 second-round pick compounded and became two players and potentially seven first-round picks through 2026.  They hadn’t simply traded Paul George. It was as if they had traded Kawhi Leonard, too. The Thunder got a massive return on investment for perhaps the best player in the NBA even though they’ve never had him under contract.   Kawhi Leonard eyed Paul George and brought him to the Clippers. PHOTO: EZRA SHAW/GETTY IMAGES The Thunder essentially swapped their today for the Clippers’ tomorrow. There has never been a trade with so much future value on one side. The player they draft in 2026 might very well be doing his sixth-grade homework right now—and Presti is the first to admit that he couldn’t have imagined how one of his first decisions in 2007 would be paying dividends now.  “The idea that anything we were doing could have 25-year performance never occurred to me,” he said.  The two people indirectly responsible for his deals feel the same way.  Allan Bristow, the retired Denver executive, spends his time fishing and hunting these days. On the night George was traded, Bristow was babysitting his grandchildren. He did not know about his unlikely role in the saga. “Heck no!” he said.  Wally Walker is now a money manager, and he’ll soon get to see the profits of this deal for himself: He recently accepted an invitation to an NBA game from one of his friends in Seattle.  That friend happens to be Steve Ballmer —the owner of the Clippers.  SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you rather be the Thunder or the Clippers in this deal? Join the discussion.

it's sort of from this article.  KD/Kyrie took a little less so that Jordan could get 4/40....  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/06/30/report-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-taking-discounts-so-nets-can-give-deandre-jordan-four-years-40m/  nobody was giving Jordan 4/40 guaranteed...but the fact that Kyrie/KD took less than max in guaranteed money and then signed their buddy?? idk seems like it was a package deal
Yeah it's  Kevin Durant arguably the best player in the league

"What if there was a Warriors fan that met some mysterious dude at like a booth at the fair or some shit and the guy says ""Your favorite team will win 73 games, win three titles with the addition of Kevin Durant but everyone gets hurt after. Do you accept?"" and he accepts???"
where is Kevin Durant on this list?
This is in no particular order. Just names that came to mind:  1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Bill Russell 8. Hakeem Olajuwon 9. Tim Duncan 10. Shaquille O'Neal 11. Kobe Bryant 12. Oscar Robertson 13. Julius Erving 14. Moses Malone 15. Kevin Garnett 16. Kevin Durant 17. Karl Malone 18. Jerry West 19. Dirk Nowitzki 20. Stephen Curry 21. David Robinson 22. Dwyane Wade 23. John Stockton 24. Charles Barkley 25. Steve Nash
"You can kind of do that when you have the best offensive weapon in the league and the talent surrounding him to make it work.   Charles Barkley would say this all the time in regards to the Warriors. Not everybody has a Steph, a Klay, or a Kevin Durant, so why are all you other teams trying to shoot 3's just like them.

Everything changed when Kevin Durant joined the fire nation

"Marcus Smart shoots better than advertised, especially at home. If not, he'll hit a three that sparks a run for the Celtics.  CJ Miles, before this season, was automatic from three. Like hitting 4+ threes, with a miss or two.  Kevin Durant during the OKC was ridiculous. If he were playing poorly to start the game, it wouldn't be long before he erased a lead."
Kevin Durant
"Up 20 in game 1 for the spurs, and they way the Rockets were playing Paul he was going to get hurt (he’s been injury prone). And also Rockets still had the MVP of the league that year who missed 20 threes in a row and the team missed 25 in a row game 7. Warriors were also pretty beat up every year in the post season. No one is at a hundred percent in the post season that’s why Kawhi has load management. Kevin Durant went down last year and they still beat the Rockets sssoooo..."
"They count.  But let's be real, not all rings count the same.  You're supposed to win the championship when a legit MVP in his prime joins a 73 win team.  If LeBron joined the Warriors they would have destroyed everyone as well.  It's not much of an accomplishment.  Dirk's 1 ring means more than KD's 2.  And if you think this is hyperbole read what KD himself said:  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/  &gt;After winning that championship (last season), I learned that much hadn’t changed. I thought it would fill a certain [void]. It didn’t.  Guarantee you LeBron's 2016 ring filled a void.  Dirks ring filled a void.  And if KD wins a ring with the Nets, that void will be filled."
"James Harden and role players had halftime leads in both Games 6 &amp; 7 against Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Andre Iguodala. It took those five an insanely improbable 27 missed threes in a row for them to beat them"
"Let me explain why you are a dumbass, and anybody who thinks the Warriors would have lost this series if Kawhi was healthy is a dumbass. You said the Spurs won the season series 2-1. Let me recap the games real quick.   &amp;#x200B;  10/25/16 - the very first game of the season and KD's first game as a Warrior. Spurs blowout the Warriors.   3/11/17 - the mighty warriors visit the spurs. The warriors have a starting lineup of Pat McCaw, Matt Barnes, Zaza Pachulia, Kevon Looney and Shaun Livingston. The highest scorer for the Warriors was Ian Clarke who came off the bench. KD, Steph, Klay and Draymond are all out. Kawhi and Aldridge are also out for the spurs. The Spurs blow out the Warriors.   3/29/16 - The Warriors finally beat the Spurs this year. They were down 20 late in the first quarter and came back to win by 12 points. Kevin Durant wasn't playing in the game.  &amp;#x200B;  If you think these 3 regular season games are any sort of litmus test, then yes, you are dumb.  &amp;#x200B;  Oh and also, this shit don't matter. Because the Warriors won the Championship that year."
Name for me please three people that do not get cooked when guarding Kevin Durant.
Read this as Kevin Durant at first... Was very confused
I’m kinda new to basketball. What is LeBron implying? The Cavs with LeBron and Kyrie beat the Warriors in the 2016 Finals right? But what is LeBron saying here about Kevin (Durant or Love) and Kyrie?
"I think it's tough to justify him over Jordan, Durant, or LeBron looking at points per 75 possessions.  He has had a great regular season last year, but is rather unsuccessful in the playoffs and a 1-year peak isn't enough for me to say he's better than the 3 of them.  A toss-up between Steph for the #4 spot to me, I think Steph is better.  Put some statistics below.  If you want to count Wilt, who knows where he lands, but I'm sure he has a good case to be put higher than him.     [For his career, James Harden is tied 4th per 75 possessions.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;type=per_poss&amp;per_poss_base=75&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=mp&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=10000&amp;order_by=pts_per_poss)  &amp;#x200B;  1. 30.3 - Michael Jordan (.569 TS)  2. 27.6 - Kevin Durant (.613)  3. 27.5 - LeBron James (.586)  4. 26.8 - Kobe Bryant (.550)  4T. 26.8 - James Harden (.609)  15. 25.1 - Steph Curry (.623)  &amp;#x200B;  At best he could be #2.

Harden's single-season number is probably the best all-time, but I could again see Harden being third by simply the consistency of Jordan, and Steph's TS.

James Harden looks bad compared to everyone on this list except Curry, who blows him out of the water with his TS again."
Yeah definitely nothing to do with personality. Kevin Durant was always better than Westbrook despite what most people said about leadership etc...
Uh no actually the reason for that is a guy named Kevin Durant who completely shifted the balance of power in the league. Cavs would’ve beaten the warriors again in 2017 had KD not been there
KEVIN DURANT 🗑🗑
"Well they liked him the first two games and then KD said ""I'm Kevin Durant"" and literally averaged 40 the rest of the series"
"Kevin Durant 2014 is pretty close, but Westbrook was out for a lot of the season  (Westbrook was definitely the alpha)"
Dude half the people in this thread are out of their minds. Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of this generation. Maybe #1 or #2 ever.  Harden is amazing but he's not quite on Durant's level. And Durant might not really be on Jordan / Wilt / Kareem's level.
Everyone watching the playoffs last year knows who the best player in the world is: It's Kevin fucking Durant. We don't get to watch the best player in the world play basketball until he returns next year.
All NBA thin bois 1st team:  G- Ja Morant G- Coby white F- Andrew Wiggins F- Brandon Ingram  C- Jackson Hayes DNP - leg is fucked - Kevin Durant
1. MJ  2. Kevin Durant   3. Lebron  4. Steph Curry  5. James Harden
Austin “Kevin Durant” Rivers
right? kevin durant and serge ibaka were on the thunder back then
no you didnt watch the warriors if you seriously think teams were doubling curry to leave kevin fucking durant free. did it happen a couple of times? maaaaybe. consistently? fuck no
That’s not the point at all??? The dude fell for a comment that said PG was worse than Norm.   What’s that question have to do with anything? Would you pick Landry Shamet or Kevin Durant?
"not with anyone who talks like Kevin Durant, sadly."
yeah. Isaiah Thomas and Kevin Durant also do this a lot-- turn over the ball hand just to the fucking limit and bring their off hand to like an inch away
Draymond thinks that's a good shot.  Luckily Kevin Durant wasn't on the team.
"He’s the reason Kevin Durant didn’t go first, and KD was projected to be elite"
"Yeah he’s just run into one of the greatest teams to ever play the game, who then added Kevin Durant. What a shitter"
I'm gonna take a leave of absence and return once Kevin Durant comes back next season. See you all later!
"No it's not a dumb argument. The average NBA height is 6'7, let's put Tako at 6'10, above the NBA avg height, he still wouldn't make it in the league because he doesn't any elite basketball skills. Handling, court vision, passing, shooting, driving, nothing.  Compare him to someone like Kevin Durant, who is also 6'10, and it would be a total joke to even compare the two.   idk why u bring up lebron james, that guy is like the epitome of a skilled basketball player, u could cut a few inches off of him and he would still be a great player, maybe not as dominant as he is currently due to his size but still NBA caliber. Tako fall would be a COMPLETE JOKE of an NBA player if you took away his ability to just tower over everyone."
"I can’t remember the last time I’ve watched someone with the amount of talent Kyrie has on a regular basis. Deron Williams had flashes of it, but it probably goes back to Vince Carter. Then I remember we have Kevin freaking Durant waiting in the wings."
oh you mean Kevin Durant 2022?
"I said the last 30 mvp years. What do you think is the modern era?  2018-19 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18 James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17 Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15 Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14 Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12 LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11 Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08 Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07 Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05 Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04 Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02 Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01 Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00 Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97 Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95 David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94 Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93 Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91 Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   This is the modern era 90s and beyond. There are only 4 unique back to back MVP winners in the entire span of 30 years, which is once again the modern era. Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan, and Lebron James. if you count MJ who already had multiple MVPs in the 80s as a unique mvp back to back winner than at best you're talking 5 people who have done it in the modern era. That is an extremely uncommon individual feat.   Individual back to back winners are extremely uncommon."
Kevin Durant?
People stopped watching because a 73-9 team added Kevin fuckin Durant and the shit became unwatchable.
"Lol you're point is not even slightly made dude. It's hilarious that you actually can't comprehend basic facts. I don't know how many more ways to try to simplify math for you. The odds of Giannis having a back-to-back MVP season this year are exactly precisely 4/25. Not extremely common. Now can he be a Lebron or an MJ and beat the odds? Sure. Is it extremely common to do so? No.   Let me break this down for you with the actual list from your timeframe since you can't seem to comprehend basic math or facts.   2018-19     Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (Voting) 2017-18     James Harden, Houston Rockets (Voting) 2016-17     Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder (Voting) 2015-16     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors (Voting) 2014-15     Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 2013-14     Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 2012-13     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2011-12     LeBron James, Miami Heat 2010-11     Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls 2009-10     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2008-09     LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 2007-08     Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 2006-07     Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks 2005-06     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2004-05     Steve Nash, Phoenix Suns 2003-04     Kevin Garnett, Minnesota Timberwolves 2002-03     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2001-02     Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs 2000-01     Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers 1999-00     Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers 1998-99     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1997-98     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1996-97     Karl Malone, Utah Jazz 1995-96     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1994-95     David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs 1993-94     Hakeem Olajuwon, Houston Rockets 1992-93     Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns 1991-92     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls 1990-91     Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls   As you can see, outside of MJ and Lebron James the only players to experience b2bs are: Tim Duncan, Steph Curry, and Steve Nash.  The top 2 players of all time won 8/30 of the last 30 MVP seasons. Even including them, one unique person per decade gets to experience this feat. The 2010s already had theirs in Steph Curry, it'd be a statistical outlier for it to happen again this year. It's an extremely uncommon feat.   Nothing about what you are saying jives with the actual data which shows a host of MVP seasons dominated by MJ and Lebron with one other person per decade pulling in a b2b which already happened."

"Oh yeah, I can see this sub being totally objective in teaching it.   ""In 2016, snake pussy bitch coward Kevin ""The Dickless Worm"" Durant pussied out, signing with the impossibly stacked Golden State Cheatarriors."""
"ESPN cares about less than these things in no particular order; Cowboys ND SEC Lebron James Yankees/Cubs/Red Sox Kevin Durant   Dono where’ve you been for since, Like 2000 but it’s always been like this. It’s why I like watch MLB/NFL network. More comprehensive coverage of all teams."
"Before anything else, I just want to say that this is great work! Super interesting to look at the rankings, and amazing graphics / presentation/ open-source code.  When I was looking at the unicorns list, however, it struck me that the unicorns (outside of Svi) were mostly just a list of the best players in the NBA. You point this out a lot in your post, and your top PCA factor loadings reflect this by prioritizing usage states and counting stats. This makes sense, seeing as part of the reason we call people unicorns is that they're really good, in addition to being really weird.  But still, I wanted to see what the process would look like if it de-prioritized usage and effectiveness. To do this, I re-ran your code subtracting all counting stats (e.g. PPG) and advanced effectiveness stats (e.g. VORP, BPM). The subtraction of those stats were a little arbitrary, but had some interesting results.  |Guard Components    | Factor 1                   | Factor 2                  | Factor 3                  | Factor 4                   | Factor 5                   | |----|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0  | TOV%                | TIME_OF_POSS       | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH | AST%                | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 1  | 2P%                 | eFG%               | DRIVE_FG%          | FG%                 | TS%                 | | 2  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | DRB%               | BLK%               | ORB%                | TRB%                | | 3  | TRB%                | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%    | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 4  | 3P%                 | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | POST_TOUCH_FG%     | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | 3PAr                |  | Wings Components | Factor 1            | Factor 2        | Factor 3           | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |---------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0             | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TIME_OF_POSS    | eFG%               | TS%                 | FG%                 | | 1             | 3PAr                | 3P%             | eFG%               | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2             | C&amp;S_FG%             | 2P%             | FT%                | BLK%                | ORB%                | | 3             | DFG%                | 3PAr            | TOV%               | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | | 4             | FTr                 | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG% | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | STL%                |  | Bigs Components | Factor 1        | Factor 2            | Factor 3            | Factor 4            | Factor 5            | |-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------| | 0               | 2P%             | TRB%                | 3PAr                | ORB%                | FG%                 | | 1               | DRIVE_FG%       | AST%                | AVG_DRIB_PER_TOUCH  | TIME_OF_POSS        | AVG_SEC_PER_TOUCH   | | 2               | PAINT_TOUCH_FG% | ELBOW_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_PAINT_TOUCH | TOV%                | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | | 3               | eFG%            | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | 2P%                 | PAINT_TOUCH_FG%     | PTS_PER_POST_TOUCH  | | 4               | BLK%            | PULL_UP_FG%         | C&amp;S_FG%             | PTS_PER_ELBOW_TOUCH | DRIVE_FG%           |  For guards, it seems like the first component reflects people who hold the ball a lot, the second component those who are good scorers, and the 3/4/5 reflect more play in the paint.  For wings, 1 is overall effectiveness, 2 might be propensity for threes vs driving, 3 I have no idea, and 4 for post play.  For bigs, 1 is hard to say, but 2 seems to reflect ball handling, and the rest I don't really know.  So how does this shake out with unicorns then? We get some weirder ones, with fewer past/future MVPs.

Honestly, I can't tell because I'm not as familiar with the play styles of players like, uh, Gary Clark/Hamidou Diallo/Svi. Maybe others can chime in on that. It does preserve some players that we know are weird even we subtracted their effectiveness, like the Greek Freak (dribbling death-center), Ben Simmons + Russel Westbrook (rebounding triple-double machines), Joe Ingles (super-shooting big), and Lebron (Lebron). The least unique guard is Bogdan Bogdanovich, wing is Jayson Tatum, and big is Zach Collins, which all feel kind of right to me.  Food for thought, anyway! Again, great post, thanks for putting in all this work."
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Svi Mykhailiuk."
"Full health (injuries discounted and assumed to be fully healthy during playoff run. If factoring for availability this changes with projected playoff LeBron from 2017-2018:  1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Anthony Davis 9. Joel Embiid 10. Damian Lillard  My list is pretty standard, with 2 exceptions, the higher placements of Jokic and Curry. I believe Curry is still the most impactful offensive player  in the league closely followed by James Harden. He warps defense like no other. My next controversial placement would be Jokic above AD. AD is a an amazing defensive player, but overrated on offense due to his lack of creation, Jokic also had one of the best postseasons in the last 10 years last year statistically, and in advanced metrics was second to only Kawhi in value.   This whole list is pretty tentative considering the uncertainty of a 2 year older LeBron, and Steph and KD's injuries. Giannis certainly has a argument over Harden, as well as AD over Jokic."
This reminds me of the Kevin Durant and  Steph curry fan fiction. Does anyone else miss those?
"&gt;I agree with him on the warren trade, I don’t get why he cares so much about the jackson trade. Jevon is a solid player and JJ was a bust who makes a lot of money. Who gives a shit if you gave up a second  Its not so much the fact he got traded away. His argument is that if you want to get rid of Jackson then the stretch provision exists and that its sub optimal to be giving up draft picks to salary dump players unless you're getting Kevin Durant even second rounders. Jevon has been inconsistent and it remains to be seen whether he'll be in the rotation by the end of the season."
"Who, in a matter of about 10 games lost Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, and Draymond Green."
"They signed Kevin Durant. In order to sign Kevin Durant, they had to lose depth pieces. It's not all about Kyrie"
"I don't know why people keep saying this.   Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles, his prime is over. He will never be in the conversation for best player again."
"Before the draft my only comparisons were Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They were the only players who had as much success as he did before the turned 19. Naismith/High school/Euroleague mvp. No freshman had ever done it before Durant and AD, and no 19 year old had ever come close to what Doncic did. He was the best prospect of the last 10 years besides AD and honestly it's not close."
"I believe that would hard cap the Rockets, much in the same way the Warriors are hard capped as a result of the S&amp;T deal with Kevin Durant and D'lo."
"Tbf Kevin Durant is the second best player in the league, it's not a ridiculous take"
"alright first time 2010-11 season, I was not dumb, I was happy Lebron left for his own benefit as im more of a player &gt; franchise, unless if the player completely fucks over the franchise and it was done out of pettiness (mr Kevin) even though ive come to accept Kevins decision as well, I knew that he deserved better and whatever we ever tried was just not good for him, he gave his all and I appreciate that, I hated everyone who burned his jersey because he legit took us to the finals and we still gave him no help... I really hate big z btw, always thought that man was trash, BUT ANYWAYS, the season was hard to even watch, just going on losing streaks was just bad and it gave me a depression as I would just get made fun of for it a lot. I ended up just stop watching the season until Kyrie (my favorite NBA player of all time) came to Cleveland as I started favoring college basketball heavily that season over watching my Cavs lose so many times. he grew and grew and it was just amazing. loved watching him so close up and getting to see him flourish as he already looked so NBA Ready in his rookie season. he was just one of those guys you know will just only grow (and he did)   &amp;#x200B;  2013, the news came to me, Lebron is back from Miami to Cleveland, I couldn't believe it... Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, AND NOW LEBRON (even though Kevin was kind of upsetting seeing him on pace to be a all time great to slowly declining in Cleveland to just a unanimous ""good big man"") the season was exciting we kept going and going, everything just falling place, it took us obviously a couple of years to get where we got so imma just skip all the boring stuff and go straight to 2016. (even though 2015 was a great season, we will not talk about it) Lebron Kyrie and Kevin all now with great chemistry and teamwork as we see on Richard Jeffersons snapchat Story everyday. The team is looking GREAT, we are genuine contenders and we have the keys to littearly win the finals after DOMINATING, the hawks so bad they went into rebuilding mode, the Celtics to another level of disrespect, our rivals the bulls, and obviously the infamous lebronto... its just great dominating, feeling a lick of the championship, but were still not there yet, we defeat everyone in our way in 2016 playoffs WITH EASE, I remember certain shots and everything from each series, wether it was raptors, pistons, or hawks, it was just funny to see them losing and us winning so easily it just looked nic- game 1... 89 - 104 against the warriors, its not super bad but thats still a 15 point loss but its ok its just one gam- game 2... A 33 POINT LOSS, ABSOLUTELY DEVESTATING YEA SURE OK WE GET IT GS YOU ARE 73-9 YOU CAME BACK FROM 3-1 TO KEVIN DURANT AND RUSSELL WESTBROOK BUT THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR PLEASE STO- game 3... we beat them by 30... ok this was home, we won by 30, we are easily going to tie the series 2-2 in game 4, thank go- game 4 AT HOME and we lose, the only thoughts in my head, boy oh boy I cant wait til 2017 to get these fucking shitheads I swear they wont repeat, basically I really thought we lost right then and there, a lot of people did and its embarrassing to admit it but thats because I am willing to admit what many Cavs fans wont, we gave up, but ooooooohh just wait til you hear about game 5... game 5 KYRIE AND LEBRON GO OFF FOR 82 MOST POINTS BY A DUO IN NBA HISTORY IN THE FINALS, I just got an INSTANT Rush after that game, play by play going in hard sooo so hard, I loved it. Game 6... Super scary entering this game, we are at home court and if we lose, we are going to be so embarrassed losing the finals at our own home court, but w ended up picking up the win and it was so so anxiety filling cause all it was doing is teasing and teasing and teasing. We win the game by 14 points but even that is a nail biter, as 14 points is the least we need to feel safe against this RECORD SEASON team. We get to oracle arena in game 7 and when I open the tv to see Kyrie and LeBron wearing those same jerseys from game 5, omg I felt so excited, I loved those jerseys so much and its my all time favorite jersey, it holds history and its just purely really sexy lmaooo. but the first quarter is just so neck and neck and both teams are playing super aggressive with it, second quarter we get DOMINATED, im super quiet and dont know what to say, my warriors neighbors are celebrating every warriors point and booing every Cavs possession, (I live in California). third quarter we come back HUGE on points and we are playing really great out there, everything from LeBron getting assists to the open man, to fastbreaks happening so often (where most of our points are coming from), the defense look somewhat ok but somehow no one can stop draymond??!!?!? but still an effective Cavs third quarter, the 4th quarter was the longest 4th quarter I have ever watched, then it happened. Igoudala to curry back to igoudala, up for the layUP- OH BLOCKED BY JAMES! That block gave me AND STILL DOES give me goosebumps every single time. Ive seen LeBron do it many times before and ive see nlebron do it so many times after, but that one, omg that one right there was just too solid to ever forget about. That was the greatest thing ive ever witnessed in the history of the NB- the crowd chants ""defense \*clap clap\* defense \*clap clap\*"" ""Irving and Curry one on one, Irving PUTS IT UP, ITS GOOD, KYRIE IRVING FROM DOWNTOWN"" I WENT ABSOLUTELY BESERK SEEING THAT SHOT GO IN SO SMOOTHLY MADE MY HEART DROP AND SAY OMG THERE NEEDS TO BE A MIRACLE FOR THEM TO EVEN COME BACK AFTER THIS... The game ends and I fall into tears just as LeBron did, im so excited ive never cried over something equivalent to this. The whole city of Cleveland and basically all of Ohio erupted and it was great to see it all just unfold like that, I sat back in my couch relieved and excited at the same time, watching everyone just celebrate, LeBron holding that trophy (both of them), ""Cleveland this is for you!!!!!!"" ahh love it.  2017 that summer after the chip KD joins obvi the warriors and its a complete blow off if youre a Cavs fan, obviously very worrying, but man oh man we had confidence, we go through again destroying the east, disrepsticng the pacers, lebronto, and the Celtics with ease. but come the warriors time, we lose and go down 3-0 and after that one game that brought us back to 3-1 it was super unrealistic but many fans pretty much had that ""if we can do it once we can do it again"" and we honestly had a better structured team that year anyways, but you know things dont always go as planned. 4-1 we lose, we lose kyrie (personally devastating even though the drama idc I love kyrie)   2018 season happens, almost lose to Celtics but you know.. LeBron and stuff. Game 1 of 2018 happens, that was just demoralizing... it was just over from right there. that was our chance of momentum and it was gone. Always loved jr off court but on I hated him, even with good games, still never liked him. but its whatever.   now were here, in 2020 where the warriors are the worst team in the league? (not their fault) the Cavs are just as good/bad? the raptors are champions, LeBron is still the best player in the world but only certain occasions where he wants to show it basically cuz we've come to expect him to have inhumane numbers because thats the standard he has set for himself but obviously LeBron is a genius and is still playing amazing while preserving himself just putting himself as the second best player in the world behind kawhi and the Cavs are just here at the bottom with a dying Kevin and every fans favorite duo in Collin and Darius or waht we call in the Cavs sub... sexland!  but yeah we alright now, we had our fun (both teams) and now the suns are doing not bad, the nba will always facisnate me..."
"last season there were 8 at 26 or more   &amp;#x200B;  luka is a new addition , you think he can't keep it up?  bradley beal is at 26.1 (26.7 last season after the all star break 25.6 overall) also a new addition  kyrie is almost certainly going to stay above 26 because he has no other stars with him. (but probably not at his current 31.9)  &amp;#x200B;  right now there are 15 players averaging 25 or more and it is more likely d'angelo russell goes above 26 (now that curry is out) than any of them go below   &amp;#x200B;  in truth most of the top 10 is new just like some guys are hot , some started slow , embiid , devin booker kevin durant ,paul george , steph curry  and bradley beal and some are hurt )  &amp;#x200B;  the only person currently in the top 10 that should drop in pascal and maybe lebron , but its just as likely embiid , russell and booker are over 26 before the season is over"

"He’s not a bust skill wise he was solid coming in and was a great prospect but he had so many injuries. The fact that he came before Kevin Durant is also a bit sad because of how acceptant he was of people thinking he was a bust. Big men just have bad luck by getting drafted 1st and having generational players drafted right behind them, he is one of my favourite personalities though"
"As far as teams that win multiple rings and are dominant for several years go, The Warriors have gotten much less hate than the Kobe-Shaq Lakers or the Heatles.  That being said Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are fairly likeable players and although Kevin Durant is in denial about how hard his road is - he hasn't done anything incredulous outside of that statement. Also, his game is incredibly fun to watch. Iggy and Livingston are good veteran leaders with good narrative as well.  The only truly dislikable player on the team is Draymond. Between the natural shooting motion bullshit and his propensity for speaking his mind he gets a lot of (deserved) flack. However he also garners some goodwill from his willingness to be so honest. His penis isn't massive. That willingness and candor that he brings is rather appreciated in spite of his flaws.  I'd say the subreddit must somewhat like the Warriors because the outcry against them is nowhere near the ridiculousness the Heatles got. Could you imagine if Lebron had made the Decision when Social Media was as prominent as it is now? He would've gotten crucified much harder nowadays. Especially after the Mavs final"
"Kevin Durant, you know the guy that joined a 73-9 team"
KD is essentially same height as him even though Russell is old now.  https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/bill-russell-and-kevin-durant-of-the-golden-state-warriors-pose-for-a-picture-id970198882
"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/bill-russell-and-kevin-durant-of-the-golden-state-warriors-news-photo/970198882  KD is taller than bill, and Ryan hollins said he’s a legit seven footer. And plus we don’t know bill’s height with shoes on"
"Yeah, nobody ever remembers that Kevin Durant didn't win any championships before joining the Warriors.  Thank you for informing us."
Ok yeah their presence on the court helped each other why is that so surprising. I’m not gonna even argue who helped each other more cause I don’t have the data to back it up.    Kevin Durant has an easier time in Golden state that’s fact.
"Honest answer: why are you blaming this on fans?      ""[We won without you.  Leave.](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/report-draymond-green-told-kevin-durant-won-without-leave/)"" - Draymond"
"Since when the hell is Draymond a better defender than Pippen, Hakeem, Rodman, Bill Russell, Mutombo, Ben Wallace or Kawhi?   Lmao fool said ""top 5 defender of all time""  &gt;second greatest shooter of all time  How is Klay a better shooter than Ray Allen or even Kevin Durant who is still an elite 3 point shooter and has arguably the greatest mid-range shot of all time?"
"&gt; Marvin Bagley, projected to be one of the top picks in the NBA draft next week, is going to sign a five-year deal with Puma that is expected to be the largest rookie shoe deal since Kevin Durant, sources tell @TheAthletic   &gt; Durant's initial deal with Nike was for seven years, $60 million. His second could be worth up to $300 million over 10 years."

"I'm comparing a healthy Kawhi to a healthy Durant  Durant is a better scorer, passer and a one man wrecking crew on offense  Kawhi is great and has the defense but KD's impact on a game is bigger than Kawhi's  No one can stop Kevin Durant"

"I could see how Kanter says this take without any loyalty bias. He only played with Kevin Durant for one season and played with Russ for another year which was his MVP year. Obviously, KD was still great in his last year in OKC, but Russ did something that was thought to be impossible the year KD left."
Well they shouldn't lose. It was the Warriors plus KEVIN Durant. How in the hell are you going to beat them? That's some 2K shit.
"He doesn't have GOAT potential. That's pretty easy.      In terms of top 15, it's not impossible but it's really really really hard to get into the top 15 and highly unlikely. Just to illustrate how difficult it is to get there, absolute legends like Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, David Robinson and Charles Barkley are some of the guys who are around that 15 spot. Amongst active players, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard all currently have much better resumes than Giannis and Curry and KD are almost assured spots somewhere in the top 20.      There are players like Steve Nash, D Wade, Moses Malone, Chris Paul, Scottie Pippen, and a bunch of other guys who don't even have an argument for top 20.      It's insanely hard to break into that group and Giannis is both young and he improves a lot every year but he has *a lot* of work to do to finish that high."
"""Imagine today’s Oklahoma City Thunder never fulfilling their potential, getting sidetracked by injuries and drugs, wiping their roster clean, then winning championships with an aged Kevin Durant nearly a decade later.""  Hehe, well..."
do you not remember Kevin Durant was MVP on the thunder
"If you had have told me last summer that the Raptors were going to win the championship I would have told you go fuck yourself. If you had have told me at the trade deadline that the Raptors were going to win the championship I would have told you to go fuck yourself. If you had have told me at the end of the regular season that the Raptors were going to win the championship then I would’ve told you to go fuck yourself. If had have told me that the Raptors were going to win the first round I would have said maybe, but go fuck yourself. If would have told me that the Raptors were going to win the second round I would’ve said maybe, but go fuck yourself. If you would have told me that the Raptors were going to win the Eastern Conference Finals then I would have said maybe, but go fuck yourself. If you had have then told me that the Raptors were going to win the NBA Championship after Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson both suffered shitty injuries, I would’ve told you to go fuck yourself.  My point is, anything can happen, and Portland, similarly to Toronto, has done quite well in recent years so who the fuck knows!"
Kevin Durant is an incredibly unique player.  Being a 7 footer with great ball handling skill and impossibly efficient shooting. He’s truly unguardable.
Sure... Curry was the reason they were so good... nothing to do with Kevin Durant...
He had Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on his team taking shots. Giannis has Middleton and Bledsoe. I'm willing to bet you Curry has a higher ppg this season than Giannis.
"I saw Kevin Durant at a Cvs in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."
"Yeah, but would he be a starter? Would you kick off one of the starters? Let's say Anthony Davis last year had more votes than Kevin Durant heading into the all star game but got traded two days before the break from NOLA to LAL.. Would he take KD's forward spot as a starter? (just as an example)"
"Fun Fact: Kevin Durant discussed this play and the impression it made on him during a podcast with Bill Simmons.  &gt; You look at Manu Ginobili, it’s to the point now you don’t even look at him as a sixth man. You just look at him like a sixth starter. A lot of people would love to be Manu Ginobili. The reason I love Manu so much is because one play that told me like, ‘Man, this guy right here is a winner, a f---ing winner.’ We played them in 2010, and we couldn’t beat them. We weren’t as disciplined as them, and they were just like more experienced. We couldn’t beat them. And like, he was struggling. He was like 0-for-7. On the baseline, he kind of like let the ball bounce off his foot. And he dove out of bounds, like full-on dove out bounds, like feet in the air, hands in the air, and threw the ball back in bounds, and they scored a layup. I [was like], ‘This f---ing is just a winner.’ Like he doesn’t care. He’s just a winner, and he’s ruthless. You’ve got to be ruthless, paranoid, and like kind of crazy to be in this league and be pretty good for a long time. I think all the good players in this league have that. Manu Ginobili had that as a nonstarter, and I think James [Harden] has the same thing; like crazy, ruthless, like super-paranoid, just like always looking over your shoulder, those types of guys. James had that, and I think Manu Ginobili is like really a mirror image.  [source](https://www.espn.com/blog/san-antonio-spurs/post/_/id/1360/kevin-durant-calls-manu-ginobili-ruthless-and-winner)"
Curry has clearly been the best floor general in the NBA for the entire golden state warriors dynasty and still today too. He was the heart of the selfless machine-like teams that played before Durant then he managed to perfectly adjust his role to include Kevin in the warriors as well as it could have been done. Harden has failed to facilitate and raise the level of his teammates in important games. The track record and personnel that both players have had throughout their career explain how they go up against each other from a facilitating context.
He cant be kevin Durant because I am
"You’re the one adding this 5 second stipulation, you’re the one who first mentioned it. You also asked if Curry or Kevin Durant had game winners. Here’s a Curry game winner with less than 5 seconds left on the clock if that satisfies you. https://youtu.be/GEMVGHoenXM  If we’re only counting playoff game winners with 5 seconds on the clock, then that is just a hella niche stat. Not all games are decided at the buzzer, some are decided in the last minute. I think you’re just being really picky, but if you’re satisfied being that picky and refusing to acknowledge anything outside of the last 5 seconds, then be my guest."
The better interpretation is he has issues vs Kevin Durant specifically. Which well.....it's Kevin Durant there are alot of good defenders who still cant handle him.

"No, no they haven't. 40+ points on 80%+ TS is done very rarely even in the regular season, maybe 2-3 times a month. In the playoffs, it's extremely rare, it's been done around 20 times. i.e. Jordan, LeBron, Kobe, Magic, Bird, Kareem, Shaq, Wilt etc. have never done it. In the Finals, it's happened twice in NBA history. Even lowering the parameters to 35+ ppg and 75%+ TS, it's happened only 4 times.    |Rk|Player|Date|G#||Opp||MP|FG|FGA|FG%|3P|3PA|3P%|FT|FTA|FT%|TRB|AST|TOV|PTS|TS%| |-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |3|Kevin Durant|2018-06-06|3||CLE|W|43|15|23|.652|6|9|.667|7|7|1.000|13|7|3|43|.824| |8|Kyrie Irving|2016-06-13|5||GSW|W|40|17|24|.708|5|7|.714|2|2|1.000|3|6|4|41|.824| |14|Kevin Durant|2017-06-12|5||CLE|W|40|14|20|.700|5|8|.625|6|6|1.000|6|5|4|39|.861| |19|Kevin Durant|2012-06-12|1||MIA|W|46|12|20|.600|4|8|.500|8|9|.889|8|4|2|36|.751|"
"Kevin Durant is way overrated. I see him as a for sure HOF-er; but to me, he lines up with guys like Dominique, Alex English, and Adrian Dantley in regards to overall rating. Maybe at the top of that list, due to his length and outside shooting ability, but not much beyond them on an all time list. And Dominique is my favorite player ever, so I'm still giving KD more credit than I'd like to with that comparison. Basically, I'm saying he's really good, but not top-20 all time good, like I see a lot around here. I agree with OP that Steph is definitely better."
"&gt; The fact that later that year they got Gasol and he was no longer forcing his way out?  Again... What happened between the time that 1) Kobe demanded a trade, and 2) the Lakers acquired Pau.   &gt; But I just don’t get why Kobe gets a pass because he spent his whole career with the Lakers and didn’t bandwagon hop   Kobe was playing with Kwame Brown Chris Mihm and Smush Parker.  Kevin Durant was already playing on an actual title contender.   I understand context is hard, but whatever..."
Jaylen Brown is probably a rich mans Kevin Durant
Yes. It's the fact that he's prone to shooting terribly from the line that is a knock against him relative to Kevin Durant. He didn't crack 70% in any series prior to the Raptors either.
Why would Jordan be an above average 3pt shooter? How do you jump from below average 3pt shooter to Kevin Durant or better?
"The Celtics didn't have a Kawhi or Pascal level initial defender.   &gt;the raptors had the defensive personnel to slowdown anyone.  Curry put up 30 on 59 TS% in the Finals. They'd have a harder time defending Kevin Durant, who is an elite threat from every section of the court, than Giannis.   Look, I know you love Giannis. But it's okay to admit that he pales in comparison to KD as a half court scorer because he doesn't have  as many options to beat a defender."
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad. Steph only works as well as he does because the entire team is built for him. Kevin durant could fit on any team and be Kevin durant. Like put durant on the hornets and he's still putting up 30 in his sleep. Put steph on the hornets and he drops off because all they have to do is double and triple him. There's no one to pass to worth a damn.
Frick Kevin durant
Not the best but my favorite is Kevin Durants but only if you do it like this:  Kyrie Curry Westbrook Harden Durant
"Kevin Durant *[clearly out of bounds in crucial moment but, but refs don't call it](https://youtu.be/rAGZPmQGLb8)*"
Nope. As far as individual playing goes the edge goes to Harden. It's not really fair to compare wins when one is playing with Kevin Durant. So only looking at stats is the easiest way to measure and Harden has an edge there for years.
Not even underrating Curry. I think it's insane he's able to make an argument. A lot of people are stuck in 2016 when it comes to Curry but Hardens been better ever since then by the stats. This year he will be by the wins now that Curry doesn't have Kevin Durant on his team.
Hmmmm... is he top 10 got me thinking. Off the top of my head I'm gonna try and name 10 better players that I would rather have to start a team.  1. Jordan 2. Hakeem 3. Kareem 4. Wilt 5. Bill Russell  6. Lebron James 7. Oscar Robertson  8. Kevin Durant 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Jerry West  I can't think of anyone else to take Kobe out. Maybe Shaq over Durant.
I was kidding. I was referring to Garnett. I honestly somehow didnt realize in my initial reply that Kevin could even refer to Garnett idk why or how. Maybe cause I call Durant Kevin more
Kevin Durant. But oddly id rather have Kevin Garnett on my team

why is kevin durant (who is much bigger) never getting flak for not wanting to play center?
2017-18(playing with Kevin fucking Durant) regular season TS% .678 postseason TS% .590  How does ur efficiency drop by almost a .10% when ur playing with another MVP. doesn’t make sense.
"Kevin Durant... he took a shortcut to his rings and i don't respect it at all, if your team can make the finals and/or win the championship without you it 100% should not elevate your legacy (and also, look at his shooting efficiency in okc vs with the warriors and get back to me, there's no universe in which he's close to being the best player in the league, even when healthy)"
I don’t think he struggles but I think he plays slower than other ball-handlers. He doesn’t have the fancy Kyrie and Steph moves but I’ve been watching his playoff run back and his hesitation moves and crossovers into pull-ups are almost as unstoppable as Kevin Durant.
"Current: Kevin Durant. Say what you will about him off the court but on the court, he’s a killer. Something about his length and the fact that he can shoot the ball so well is appealing to me.  All-time: Kobe Bryant. The legend surrounding him is just too much not to fall for."
He paved the way for Par Beverly to annoyingly guard Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant never lost to Charlie and Martin Sheen in a televised game either.
kevin durant is an all time great. we're all going to miss him next year. fk achilles..
If Kevin Durant didnt exist would LeBron be the GOAT  If Draymond didnt exist would LeBron be the GOAT  If Steve Kerr just took the Knicks job would LeBron be the GOAT  Deep questions here truly
"Win shares isn't a perfect stat, but the following is interesting..  Number of seasons with over 10 win shares for some players :  LeBron James 14  Michael Jordan 11  Kobe Bryant 11  Kevin Durant 9  Larry Bird 9  Paul Pierce 8  Clyde Drexler 7  Dwayne Wade 5  Ray Allen 5  John Havlicek 4  Paul George 2  Kawhi Leonard 2    Kawhi has played over 70 regular season  games 2 times.  Pierce did that 14 times, and 7 times was at 80 games or over."
i’ll be surprised if warriors doesn’t have a kevin durant memorial court this season 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
I remember a few weeks later Kevin Durant copied it and the same thing to a fan in OKC.  So lame lol.
"[He's right though. KD was more efficien true shooting wise and scored more but from the floor they had the same efficiency \(wiggins was a bit better, even\). Their overall numbers are surprisingly similar](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;y1=2008&amp;player_id2_hint=Andrew+Wiggins&amp;player_id2_select=Andrew+Wiggins&amp;y2=2015&amp;player_id2=wiggian01&amp;idx=players)"
"Stefon ""kevin durant"" Curry"
"I think it's unbelievably naive that you don't think Kevin Durant is going to take significant viewersship away from U of Texas if he goes to USC or somewhere else in California instead.  How many millions of die hard fans do the small schools in Texas have?  If the quality product moves, the fans will wane.  And you sound like a prick.  Nice."
"https://grantland.com/features/russell-the-creator-westbrook-nba-oklahoma-city-thunder-western-conference-kevin-durant-serge-ibaka-kevin-love/  &gt; Westbrook’s favorite jumper is near the elbow — a midrange pull-up that he and his father have called his “cotton shot” since they practiced it endlessly at Jesse Owens Park in Los Angeles throughout Westbrook’s childhood.  &gt; “My dad taught me that,” he says. “It’s called that because of the cotton net at the park I grew up at. ‘All cotton’ is what my dad used to say. ‘All net.’ That cotton shot is all I practiced.”"
"&gt; Reddit just decided that all players peak from like 27-30    No actually LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson,  Shaq etc. decided that the prime age was 27-30"
It worked on Giannis and Patrick Beverly gave Kevin Durant lots of issues doing the same thing but being an entire foot shorter than.   Would you have Noah be the primary defender on Jokic?
"Well, it's kevin Durant"
I'm confused as to why nobody is mentioning Kevin Garnett. Curry and Durant will arguably finish their careers top 15 and Duncan was still in his prime in '07. He just took a step back offensively because the Spurs were more effective running the offense through Parker and Ginobili
"Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler,  Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, LaMarcus Aldridge."
&gt; Pulling Gobert from the paint with a stretch 5 **and/or having capable off the dribble shooter in a pick n pop/roll**  Omfg can you not read complete sentences? What is Steph curry &amp; Kevin Durant if not capable off the dribble shooters.
They forgot Kevin Durant (who will play next season trust me). And had Klay at 58 below Otto Porter Gary Harris and Jayson Tatum?
"&gt;When you compare  him to the league around him, *Robertson is the 2nd most efficient volume scorer of all time*\*, behind Kevin Durant.  This is just misleading. his efficiency is only great relative to the league around him, and doesn't translate across eras. His efficiency and pace-adjusted stats in Cincinnati put him at about 24 ppg on .570 TS%, far below LeBron (27.2 ppg on .586 TS%), Jordan (31.5 ppg on .580 TS%), and below guys like Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Shaq, and Kareem.  Even Steph, including his rookie and injured seasons, has still averaged 23.5 ppg on .624 TS%, the 4th highest efficiency in NBA history.   Just because Oscar was very efficient and high-volume for his era doesn't mean that it translates across eras. He was ""*the most efficient volume scorer""* of one of the highest pace and lowest efficiency eras in NBA history."
"Imagine telling somebody in 1974 that Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, James Harden, and Giannis Antetokounmpo would be some of the best players in the league... absolutely unreal /s"
"You just reminded me that Steve Nash was actually a tough as PG for his slender size. Didn’t he break his nose in a game as well and continued playing? I know he lost a tooth in game too.  As far as bears you don’t want to poke before tip-off, I think the obvious answer is Bron  Another is KD, remember we just went through the whole “you know who I am, I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am, you know my name.” After that press conference, guy put all that Pat Beverley and Clippers talk to rest.   As I typed that I just realized the best answer.  Damian Fucking Lillard,  👋🏼"
"Here's the list of those 35 players, announced a god awful long time ago in April, 2018:  Harrison Barnes - See Jerry not everyone dropped  Bradley Beal  Devin Booker - You should've played Book!  You had nothing to lose!  Jimmy Butler   Mike Conley  DeMarcus Cousins  Steph Curry  Anthony Davis  Demar DeRozan  Andre Drummond  Kevin Durant  Paul George  Eric Gordon  Draymond Green  Blake Griffin  James Harden  Tobias Harris  Gordon Hayward  Kyrie Irving  LeBron James  DeAndre Jordan  Kawhi Leonard  Damian Lillard  Kevin Love  Kyle Lowry  CJ McCollum  Khris Middleton - that's 2 Jerry!  Victor Oladipo  Chris Paul  Isaiah Thomas - He should've played.... c'mon IT!  Klay Thompson  Myles Turner   Kemba Walker  John Wall  Russell Westbrook   Yes Jerry, I'm sure you won't forget that the biggest names in the game didn't play in FIBA and you will turn them away at the door when the Olympics roll around.  Invite some younger talent in the first place your crusty old bastard and maybe they won't turn away from you."
"I don't have time to do this rn like I said, I'm not here to argue the validity of the statement. Just most NBA players/execs say the same thing. Here's something to start you with.

"I still remember an article where I read that Kevin Durant said that ""D.Rose stole my career"" which I find both funny and sad at the same time."
"Ok. Your point?  It's not like just because a team offers you money you are forced to accept it. I know it's hard to deny THAT much money but we do hold superstars like KD to an higher standard (expecially at the time). Either because they pretty much make huge money anyway, and because of the romanticism we project into a sport, because we see it as an escape from everyday life. Or both.   You might argue that it's our fault to expect better of people who at the end of the day are trying to make the most out of their career, being successful and so on, expecially when you consider some things like legacy that comes into play later on.And I would partially agree with that.   The point is, due to Kevin Durant being a straight up baller (love him or hate him, it's clear he lives and breathes basketball) , he would have gone to Golden State regardless of the cap spike. He just wanted to get those easy rings in order to not go down history as someone like Charles Barkely or Stockton.   He got his wish granted but he needs to grow up and need to understand that that actions have consequences  \[IMHO his grand master plan was to win a chip in Brooklyn and shut the haters up, just like LeBron did when he won in Cleveland, but he must have realized that the chances of that happening were pretty much cut in half due to his injury and that's why he's been saying so much dumb stuff lately (the ""never choked"" quote is baffling TBH). That's just my speculation though, based on pretty much nothing but my gut feeling\]"
Never say never because limit like fear is often just an illusion.   \-Michael Jordan  &amp;#x200B;  Hardwork beats talent if talent doesn't work hard  Kevin Durant  &amp;#x200B;  I can't relate to lazy people.

"Stephen Curry James Harden Lebron James Kevin Durant Anthony Davis - Damian Lillard Klay Thompson Kawhi Leonard Paul George Karl Anthony-Towns - Kyrie Irving LaMarcus Aldridge   Jimmy Butler, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green and Demar Derozan would be the first three substitutes if any of the above guys didn’t play. I threw LaMarcus in there because in FIBA the big guys are a little more valuable, even though I don’t think he’s one of the twelve best American basketball players."

"Kevin Durant about Kobe Bryant's rape: “If you’re doing something that’s so violent, you might want to reconsider what you’re doing… Bryant's been a friend of mine for a long time…would I make the same decision? No. I would have not raped a hotel employee in Colorado in 2003.”"

Huh. I just realized I don't want Kevin Durant to be the president.
Kobe Bryant is right.   Kevin Durant would have had more merit staying at OKC with Westbrook to beat the Warriors the following year and then win the NBA title.
I have a feeling kevin Durant made this post with his fake reddit account
"It's too early to say before seeing Kevin Durant back from injury. If he's back to his form this past season, then the Nets are going to be hard for anyone to beat."
"That’s the thing, I’m not arguing people are staying up at night over KDs decisions. They have opinions on what happens in sports, and can feel devastated by a bad loss or elated by a big win. But that doesn’t mean people are up and down with every win/loss, or can’t separate the rest of their lives from basketball. People in OKC aren’t walking around in a bad mood because of Kevin Durant. They hate him kinda in the way you hate a movie character; they can still go about their lives"
Kawhi’s game winner  Wades game winner against GSW  Kevin “you know who I am” Durant going on a rampage   Any of Giannis’ crazy ass dunks  Steph torching Portland even with them having big leads in multiple games
"Even in context, that doesn't add up with the stuff he has said in numerous other interviews.   The cupcake game happened on February 11, 2017.    From a Lee Jenkins profile on Paul George from July 11, 2017  [https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-thunder-trade-kevin-durant-lakers-pacers-russell-westbrook](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/11/paul-george-thunder-trade-kevin-durant-lakers-pacers-russell-westbrook)   ""KD was like, 'That place (Oklahoma City) will blow you away.' He told me, 'They can offer what other teams can't in terms of the people and the preparation and the facility, down to the chefs and the meals.' He was pretty high on (the Thunder). He thought it was a first-class organization in every way,"" George said  Some quotes from another interview, from Nov. 16, 2017:   [https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-okc-blue-blood-forever/story?id=51204319](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-okc-blue-blood-forever/story?id=51204319)   After he left, Durant seemed to have an icy relationship with those he left behind, including former teammate Russell Westbrook.  He says he has come around, and that ""me and my family didn't erase those eight years in OKC.""   ""I am OKC. I'm still OKC,"" Durant told Bleacher Report. ""That blue is going to be in my blood forever. That place raised me. I have people there who would take a bullet for me and vice versa. ""   ""I didn't have that perspective at first. I didn't have it when I went back to OKC. I was like, 'F--- all of them,'"" Durant said. ""I didn't have it when they gave my number away. I was, 'F--- all of them.' My best friend works for the team, I told him, 'F--- all y'all. That's f---ed up.' Then I had to get out of my head, tell myself, 'It's not that serious, it is what it is.' ""   ""If I was on my death bed, I guarantee you \[Thunder owner\] Sam Presti and Russell Westbrook would come check on me. So I'm going to look at it that way rather than the other way.""   If he found the treatment from the organization to be so bad after he left why did he say *anything* positive about the organization, for years afterwards? I don't think he's lying but he seems to remember things in a way that justifies however he feels at any given moment."
"His first nba finals win came against a broken down Cavs team.  His second finals he was apart of a team that lost a 3-1 lead  His next 2 had Kevin freaking Durant helping him.  Basically, his finals resume is.....odd and its affected his status as the number 1 player."
"I don't like a single thing Kevin Durant said today.  And he was my favorite player, after Kobe retired, for a long time, he's a lanky, skinny tall dude who can do everything on the court, who got drafted by the Seattle Sonics(my mom's hometown), i literally wanted to be him.  He disappoints me with every sentense."
&gt; Kareem or Bill Russell of the social media generation  [Bill Russell](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/682589-bill-russell-civil-rights-hero-and-inventor-of-airborne-basketball) and [Kareem Abdul-Jabar](https://theundefeated.com/features/lew-alcindor-kareem-abdul-jabbar-ucla-boycot-1968-olympics/) were hated by the media because they wanted to talk about social inequality that the black community faced in there respective eras. The media in those days just wanted someone who would be these fake poster boys showing how equal America was even though the majority black Americans were living in a racist society that constantly treated them like second class citizens. Both of those men refused to be that fake smiliing propaganda mouth piece and spoke out against the social inequalities that plagued America at that time which caused many members of the media and the public to think negatively of them.  Kevin Durant main problem with the media stems for his decision to play for the warriors and how the public and media has viewed him since then not because of his stance on civil rights. He is not on the same level of media scrutiny that Bill Russell or Kareem faced back in the 60’s and 70’s.
"""Well I was gonna say sorry but now I'm not going to do it!!!""  This is some real kindergarten level shit right here. Just when you think Kevin Durant couldn't become more of a BITCH, he somehow manages to 1up himself time and time again. If they aren't winning when he comes back from that injury, the Nets are going to be one helluva shit show, probably worse than the Leltics shit show last season."

"Well I'm gonna have to disagree, all your point about fandom indicates is that a lot more people are vested in which organization Kevin Durant works for as opposed to whether the 7-Eleven cashier opts to stay or leave for Safeway."
"That Kevin Durant is not employee of the Oklahoma City Thunder in the same way a cashier is an employee of 711 and you'd have to be willfully obtuse to pretend to not recognize the difference. Yes, he's technically an ""employee"" of ""an organization,"" but that's obviously a reductive point."

"I didn't say they never will, just that they never have, which is a fact for as long as Booker has been with them. The Suns have never been in anything that resembles an elimination game or a must-win playoff game for as long as he has been there. I'm not saying that as a negative issue, I'm saying that is what makes the focus on Booker different from other players around his same age.  I can also point at all the former players who jumped following World Cup cycles as a reason he should have accepted the opportunity, which includes 1994 when Shaq was the tournament MVP then led the NBA in scoring and made his first Finals. Kevin Durant was the 2010 tournament MVP the summer before his best individual season of his career. Derrick Rose stood out in the same tournament and won the NBA MVP the next season. Kyrie Irving was the 2014 tournament MVP before he made one of the biggest shots in NBA Finals history. The only other tournament over the last 25 years was 1998 when they took college players instead of NBA players.  People are mad Booker passed that up when it seemed like he had the most to gain from it. But now at this point we are just talking in circles."
"KD is a grown-ass man, and he's still a whiny bitch. How can you be Kevin fucking Durant and be so insecure?"
Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose definitely improved following the 2010 World Cup. You could put Curry in that same boat too.

~~Andy Bernard~~ Kevin Durant does not lose contests. He wins them. Or he quits them because they are unfair
Thunder fans are really the only people that should have a beef with Kevin Durant......and even that is a stretch at this point.....
"Didn't realize you were a part of these super high level runs, I'd love to hear your insight!  For all you know the non-NBA players are there with the expectation that they're there to help the NBA guys train. Regardless, I love that all these redditors have decided it's stupid when Booker and Kevin fucking Durant think otherwise.  It obviously wasn't unanimous but it's clearly not an outrageous opinion.  And frankly, Joakim Noah and Draymond Green being the two guys speaking out against it doesn't really do much for me in thinking that it's not somthing expected out of these games by a lot of NBA stars."
i think its abundantly clear that kevin durant is really stupid and basically illiterate
"I just want to say, KD had the right to leave OKC. He also had the right to go to GSW. I just wish he was a little more civil about it, but he did apologize later on: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20757602/kevin-durant-sorry-tweets-critical-billy-donovan-thunder  With that being said, I don’t think OKC fans would ever forgive him unless maybe he came back and won a ring there."

Kevin Durant is so talented he never had to get tough. Think about that. Think about how good he could be if he had a thick skin.
"OKC were not one of the worst spacing teams. They had Kevin Martin (43.6% from 3) and Thabo (41.9% from 3) at wings getting the most minutes along with Ibaka (50% from 10-23 ft). That's much better than Warriors spacing outside of the big 3.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2011-12 Line-ups with Durant/Westbrook/Ibaka peaked at 117.76 ORTG   2012-13 Line-ups with Durant/Westbrook/Ibaka peaked at 112.4 ORTG   2014-16 Line-ups with Curry/Klay/Green peaked at 119.26 ORTG  Death line-up in 2015-16 (big 3 + Iggy) peaked at 129 ORTG   2016-17 Hamptons 5 (big 3 + KD + Iggy) peaked at 125 ORTG  2016-17 Curry, Klay, Draymond peaked at 129.38 ORTG  As you can see, adding a ball dominant player (KD is not even nearly as ball-dominant as Harden/Westbrook) does not automatically increase ORTG.    2017-18 CP3/Harden/no Gordon peaked at 119.5 ORTG (622 mins), however removing Harden/adding Gordon led to 121.09 ORTG (452 mins) and removing Paul/adding Gordon led to 119.98 ORTG (549 mins). Again..adding a ball dominant player does not necessarily result in an increase in offense."
Kevin durant is a giant man-baby
"Interesting, cause I do the same him you are sayin kd does. I run away when I feel like I don’t belong. I haven’t lived in the same place for more than 1 year for the past 6 years.  I am Kevin Durant."
"Okay and there hasn't been much basketball played since that happened.  So like I said,   &gt; As of right now, it's Kevin Durant as much as it pains me to admit.  &gt; If he comes back from injury a different man, ask us again."
"Kevin ""Carmelo ""What you going to teach me"" Anthony"" Durant"
"[https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/07/02/you-dont-know-me-like-that-kevin-durant-the-warriors-and-a-toxic-locker-room/] (I had an interaction with him and his people back in February when I went on a podcast and I said that, ‘If and when Durant leaves, it will be to go play with Kyrie, to follow Kyrie.’ And he took major offense to that, approached me in the locker room about that. He basically just said ‘stop acting like you know my motivations, stop acting like you know what I’m thinking, and what drives me. You don’t know me like that.’)"
"Kevin Durant is trying too hard to be some sort of polarizing figure, when we all know he's ACTUALLY a boy with a bible in his backpack without tattoos on his sleeves that couldn't bench press more than his own body weight.  It's not working KD.  You're just a fucking beautiful basketball player, who has completely shaken the NBA scene.  Be whatever you need to feel yourself, but all this is hot ham water."
Yeah but to the majority of NBA fans his achievements aint worth half of lets say lebrons 2016 ring because he joined the strongest team in the league that beat him when he choked. Kevin Durant wants to leave a good legacy but in reality he soiled his legacy as the weak guy who joined GSW versus came back next year to beat them with OKC.
Was wondering too. Looks like someone asked him about him saying KD could have whatever he wanted to resign:  Myers: That was just for the media he can’t have anything that he wants.  Coach Steve Kerr: Mid-level  Broadcaster Bob Fitzgerald: last year you told Steph he could have whatever contract he wants too.  Myers: That was different. He’s been here since the way before days ... he’s earned it.  Fitzgerald: And there ended the Warriors’ cohesion right there.

"The team that drafted him doesn't exist anymore and the city it relocated to slapped him in the face.  He says he sees the 2019-20 Brooklyn roster as new beginnings for everyone involved. Young head coach who's only been doing this a couple of years, young GM who's only been doing this a couple of years, owner who's only been running the show for about a month, really young core who are coachable and play with a team-first mindset...  He's not walking into a situation as the new guy, or as the outsider. It's not going to be ""The Nets, and Kevin Durant"" like it was in Golden State. Durant, Irving and Jordan are each First Team All-NBA talents and they're coming here together to build something."

"No. I don't blame you for remembering it that way because the Breakfast Club snippets were posted here and highly upvoted but the clarifying local interview he did the next day once it blew up was not. Better late than never, there's more here where he explains his thoughts on how the training staff handled KD's injury, but the parts relevant to his own injury are:  &gt; “I always have great faith,” Iguodala told Bay Area News Group about the Warriors’ training staff. “I always talk about all of our trainers, past, present and hopefully in the future. We have a great group of guys.”  ...  &gt; “I don’t think it was internal pressure at all,” Iguodala said of how the Warriors’ training staff handled his left leg injury. “It had nothing to do with me, When you read an MRI, it can be read so many different ways. Even if I thought what it was or they thought what it was, we were all clear and on the same page. My leg was stable. In that area, even if you have a bruise or a fracture, it is very similar. People don’t realize that. We were both on the same page that it was stable and that part of the body was fine to go play. Regardless of what I thought it was or what they thought it was or what anybody thought it was, we were all on the same page that I was good to go. It was a stable leg.”  ...  &gt; “If you have an MRI, you can interpret it in many different ways and however many different interpretations,” Iguodala said. “I knew it was stable. I knew, for the most part, that it could only get better. It couldn’t get any worse. It showed. I went out there and played and had success and helped my team win. The team made the right decision. I made the right decision.”  Source:  https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/26/andre-iguodala-defends-warriors-training-staff-on-how-they-managed-himself-kevin-durant/"
"Antonio Brown just forced his way off the Raiders by freezing his feet, complaining about his helmet, and calling Mike Mayock a cracker (which is hilarious).   Kevin Durant left as a free agent to a really good team which was annoying to every other fan base.   It’s Antonio Bryant."
"Choking, because it's some quarterback doing it and not Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant doesn't choke, ever. EVER.   ಠ_ಠ"
"Absolutely.  But if we were to do that, we would also have to account for the other hundreds of athletes going through the same thing.  I would say Jeremy Lin is more depressed (imo) than Kevin Durant.  Durant seems to be trying to find something that makes him whole.  Trying to find yourself while dealing with the rat race is fine, but you don't need to blow other's candles out in order to make yours shine brighter.  Kevin Durant can be depressed and that's his right, but who is gonna tell him to go and get help like Kevin Love?  Where he gets a bad looks is lashing out and saying the employees at his old job were terrible and leaving bad reviews on glassdoor via burner accounts.  Also quitting without giving his old job ample time to fill his replacement.  Three years later, he's left the new job to join a startup and still talking about his job in Oklahoma."
I get what you're saying but if it was Curry they wouldn't have done that. It's because Kevin Durant has proven time and time again to be the most unlikeable asshole in the league.  I wouldn't do it myself but I could see why some would do it.
When did Durant ever play with two superstars? To pretend that James Harden was a superstar back in OKC is disingenuous. There are plenty of other ways to shit on Kevin Durant
"As of right now, it's Kevin Durant as much as it pains me to admit.  Fuck all the extra noise, he's just simply the best player in the NBA right now and has accolades to back up the argument.  If he comes back from injury a different man, ask us again.  Might be Kawhi at that point, might be Giannis.  TBD."
"Curry can do it, we’ve seen it before. Man won 73 games.  Kevin Durant also did it during his mvp season when Westbrook got injured. "
"“Kevin Durant has been fined for comments about the officiating, and we’ve also decided to ensure all the officials from the game in question will be in the postseason rotation to encourage the flawless reffing we expect from our beyond reproach officiating staff.”"
You're not concerned about the back-to-back champions that have Kevin Durant and Steph Curry on their roster?
" &gt;Wait... since he will probably be in free agency or get traded soon, do you think the Knicks have a shot at getting Green, too, especially if Kevin Durant either stays with the Warriors or goes somewhere else?  We definitely could, but I'm not sure we'd want him. Draymond is currently making $16M per year, and he's putting up 7 pts, 8 rebounds, 6 asts. The Knicks are getting 8/9/2 out of Noah Vonleh this season for $1.6M. Basically comparable production for 1/10th of the price. Unless Draymond starts hitting threes I don't think he's going to be worth the money he expects to anyone, and he'll probably get paid by an incompetent FO and end up hurting their roster by eating up cap space.        &gt;That makes sense... though, why don't they just try to push for a 2020 championship and beyond? Trying to be better than Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls from the 90's, so to speak.  They may very well want to, I just don't see the urgency with them anymore. Not everyone has the insatiable killer instinct to just keep on winning and winning and winning. I'm not an insider or anything, but they seem kind of bored to me.     &gt; although, he could Russell Westbrook it and still stay faithful despite having not won a championship yet.  I sincerely doubt it. The Pelicans haven't been nearly as good to Davis as the Thunder have to Westbrook. Say what you want about Sam Presto, he's made some bad moves for sure. But he always puts his guys in a position to compete. The Pelicans have never put a truly good team around AD, now in his seventh season and 85 games under .500 for his career. I'm sure he wants out.    &gt; &gt;Heh, I'm outside the nation, so this might be a tad more difficult! But our main sports network airs the usual suspects: if it shows up on TNT, they're almost a shoo-in over here. ESPN-feature games? Haven't checked lately, so I got no dice here. &gt;   Get a cheap VPN and watch illegal streams. That's how we do it over here lol.      &gt;So, they're *not* coasting? That gave me a bit of chills. Granted, they're good teams, but still...  All three of them seem to be figuring stuff out. Embiid and Butler are figuring out how to gel together, the Celtics are trying to recreate last season with two max players (one of whom is integrating just fine, the other one coming off the bench for simplicity's sake), and Miami is just trying to stay competitive. I would look for Pat Riley to be a major player at the trade deadline.     &gt; &gt;You know what? It's been fun talking to you! Thank you for the discussion. See you around?  Definitely! It's been great talking to you too. "
"&gt; KD is almost certainly going to be offered the supermax, and Draymond will probably either be traded or walk in free agency. This is a part of the locker room drama I mentioned earlier.  Ah. Maybe Draymond is doing something like flailing in death throes in Golden State or what have you.  Wait... since he will probably be in free agency or get traded soon, do you think the Knicks have a shot at getting Green, too, especially if Kevin Durant either stays with the Warriors or goes somewhere else?  &gt; As for the rest of Warriors, players and organization alike, I think the reason they're so cool with it is less about having a team intact either way, and more about having already won three titles.  That makes sense... though, why don't they just try to push for a 2020 championship and beyond? Trying to be better than Michael Jordan and his Chicago Bulls from the 90's, so to speak.  &gt; There's a lot of parallels with him and LeBron before he left for Miami.  I just checked Anthony's age. He's 25, which seems about young enough to still have a shot at getting a championship in his prime. Seriously, though, the Pelicans might be disappointing him at this point... although, he could Russell Westbrook it and still stay faithful despite having not won a championship yet.  &gt; Yeah if you get the chance watch their games. It's hard because they're almost never on national TV but they're a fun team.  Heh, I'm outside the nation, so this might be a tad more difficult! But our main sports network airs the usual suspects: if it shows up on TNT, they're almost a shoo-in over here. ESPN-feature games? Haven't checked lately, so I got no dice here.  &gt; I expect Boston, Philly, and Miami in the playoffs, and at least some shakeup from the current seeding order is likely, but I doubt that anyone is holding back at this point unless they're wary of injuries.  So, they're *not* coasting? That gave me a bit of chills. Granted, they're good teams, but still...  &gt; You picked a good time to start watching. I think this years playoffs are going to be great.  Honestly, I've been lurking on this subreddit since midway through the 2018 Conference Finals. However, since I have this I-wanna-see-the-world-burn attitude, almost any team's interesting to me, especially this season. Lots of narratives:  * Will Golden State win their third championship in a row? * Will LeBron make the finals and become the Lakers' next star player? * Will Doncic be this generation's Dirk and send them to another championship run? * What will the post-LeBron Cavaliers do? * Now that LeBron is gone from the East, who will emerge victorious from the conference? * Will Toronto give Canada their first NBA championship ever?  And so on...  Yup. I guess this is a good time to start watching... if my schedule aligns, that is.  You know what? It's been fun talking to you! Thank you for the discussion. See you around?"
" &gt;I guess so. It's strange how not just Kevin Durant but also the rest of the Warriors are so carefree about his free agency.   Not all of them. KD is almost certainly going to be offered the supermax, and Draymond will probably either be traded or walk in free agency. This is a part of the locker room drama I mentioned earlier. In the first week or so of the season there was apparently a personal conflict where Dray said some below the belt shit about KD in front of the team. Before KD showed up Dray was the center of attention, this weirdly dynamic player who came up out of nowhere and gave the warriors an x-factor that helped them reach the next level. Two years later, he's the fourth option and he's putting up his worst numbers as a starter with no big contract in sight. He's also a punk bitch so it's no surprise he isn't handling it will.   As for the rest of Warriors, players and organization alike, I think the reason they're so cool with it is less about having a team intact either way, and more about having already won three titles.     &gt;I heard Anthony Davis is a very good player... and his team is almost dead last in the West. I think I know what you mean by ""fed up"".  There's a lot of parallels with him and LeBron before he left for Miami.     &gt;Alrighty, then! To be honest, I don't hear much of them: maybe it's because it's a small market, I don't know, but if they're third in the East, they *must* have something good cooking in there. Seriously, I've never heard of Oladipo until last year, so that could be something to say about how casual I am.  Yeah if you get the chance watch their games. It's hard because they're almost never on national TV but they're a fun team. Oladipo was a big noise as a rookie but two different teams gave up on him prematurely. It's awesome because he plays like a man who's got something to prove.      &gt;&gt; Smart money is still on Bucks and Raptors, but both Mike Budenholzer and Kyle Lowry have long histories of putting up great regular season performances and then inexplicably collapsing in the playoffs, so anything could happen.   &gt; &gt;Isn't it a strategy, though, for a very good team to take it easy during the regular season (only putting in enough effort to get a middle playoffs seed) and then go all in during the postseason proper? Does that mean the 76ers, the Celtics, or the Heat are more likely to win the East, or am I missing something here?  I think we're used to that from our superteams, but I doubt that anyone will be doing that this year. LeBron might personally take it easy to avoid unnecessary strain, but not if the Lakers are fighting for the 8th seed come March, which is a possibility. Teams like Golden State, LeBron's Heat, the Tim Duncan Spurs, etc., Took their foot off the gas a bit when they had a comfortable lead with a high seed, but if things continue the way they are now there's gonna be stiff competition in both conferences.   I expect Boston, Philly, and Miami in the playoffs, and at least some shakeup from the current seeding order is likely, but I doubt that anyone is holding back at this point unless they're wary of injuries.   You picked a good time to start watching. I think this years playoffs are going to be great."
"&gt; He's out with an ACL tear now, which is the same injury Chris Paul had early in his career. CP was never the same player again, but remained a perennial all-star and top 5 guard for years afterward anyway.  I bet Knicks fans are hoping Porzingis is going to recover like Chris Paul, if not just shrug the injury off like it was a year-long cold. Then again, I don't know what an ACL tear feels like, so I don't know.  &gt; I think we have a decent shot at KD...  I guess so. It's strange how not just Kevin Durant but also the rest of the Warriors are so carefree about his free agency. I think Klay made a joke about it early on and everyone was fine with it. They know they have a considerable chance at losing one of their star players, and they're fine with it. Probably because they already have Curry, Klay, Green, et c...  Still, it's weird. I'd expect drama or at least some tension about it, but apparently in Oakland? Not much.  &gt; I also think there's a real shot that AD is so fed up with the Pelicans next offseason that he takes a serious look at NY. Fingers crossed.  I heard Anthony Davis is a very good player... and his team is almost dead last in the West. I think I know what you mean by ""fed up"".  &gt; In that situation, I'd want them to continue developing the core, and either trade KP for a veteran and a high pick in 2020 or 2021 (provided his value is that high after he comes back), or else just keep steady, shuffle vets and expirings in and out of that cap space so it can be cleared at a moments notice when the next big FA comes up.   Sounds reasonable enough.  &gt; It'll be interesting to see how it pans out, especially if Boogie under-performs when he hits the court in a few months.  I've read somewhere else in this subreddit that if the Warriors could get Boogie a championship this year, they would solidify their status as the recovery team: ""You're a good player who deserves a ring but you're stuck in a really bad team *and* you're running out of time? Then come join Golden State!""  &gt; I would also keep an eye on the Pacers.  Alrighty, then! To be honest, I don't hear much of them: maybe it's because it's a small market, I don't know, but if they're third in the East, they *must* have something good cooking in there. Seriously, I've never heard of Oladipo until last year, so that could be something to say about how casual I am.  &gt; Smart money is still on Bucks and Raptors, but both Mike Budenholzer and Kyle Lowry have long histories of putting up great regular season performances and then inexplicably collapsing in the playoffs, so anything could happen.

"""On replay, Kevin Durant maintains legal positioning before touching the ball.  CNC""  - L2M"
"&gt; Checking the standings, I'd consider Cleveland to be the second worst,  You could be right, I haven't paid that close attention lol   &gt;  &gt; I've heard that Porzingis has been recovering for a long time. Do you think his injury (or whatever it was that made him sit out) would have long-term negative effects on his performance over the next few years? I personally doubt being sat out for so long could be fully healed.  It really depends on the player. KP has a versatile game with a lot of facets to it, and he's a smart player. I'm not just being a homer when I say that if he were to hit his ceiling, he has MVP potential. He's out with an ACL tear now, which is the same injury Chris Paul had early in his career. CP was never the same player again, but remained a perennial all-star and top 5 guard for years afterward anyway. Again, every situation is different. There's no reason he couldn't come back in force though.   &gt; Which free agent are you looking for exactly come this or next summer? The only ones I could rattle off of the top of my head are Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and maybe Anthony Davis. Eyeballing it, I guess most likely scenario is Klay, although his family are all West Coasters, so a New York move may be difficult.   I think we have a decent shot at KD. I'm not willing to defend that against serious scrutiny because I'm aware of my homerism and that may be all this is, but if I was KD, now that I got my rings and my FMVPs, I'd want to go somewhere and write a fuckin story. Pulling the biggest market in the NBA out of the dumpster and bringing them their first title in almost 50 years would be super tempting to me, and if I only had to give up $30m to do it I would seriously consider it (that's the difference over 5 years if he gives up the supermax to sign with a team that doesn't have his bird rights).  I also think there's a real shot that AD is so fed up with the Pelicans next offseason that he takes a serious look at NY. Fingers crossed.  &gt; In the unlikely event you win enough games to accidentally get out of tanking mode and miss out on Zion or someone like him, what's the contingency plan you hope the Knicks would put in?  In that situation, I'd want them to continue developing the core, and either trade KP for a veteran and a high pick in 2020 or 2021 (provided his value is that high after he comes back), or else just keep steady, shuffle vets and expirings in and out of that cap space so it can be cleared at a moments notice when the next big FA comes up. We have a bad habit of selling the farm the moment things don't pan out, trading in quality assets, promising young players and valuable picks for post-prime guys on expensive contracts who just can't get it done anymore, and I just want to avoid that at all costs this time. There are a lot of ways things can go right for us if we just don't do stupid shit like that.    &gt;  &gt; As for what I think of this season: It's nigh impossible we're getting Warriors-Cavs Part V, that's for sure. It'd be weird if LeBron doesn't make the finals this year... but, it'd also be weird if the Warriors don't make the finals, too. Not that I want them to make it... it's just, at least we know one staple of recent finals isn't going to appear, and it's like not seeing a main character.  Agreed. The Warriors look super beatable this year though. I would still put money on them at this point, but they have so many problems that could blow up and become serious at any time. Complete lack of bench depth (Kerr does not seem to be able to scheme for the bench either which is surprising), Klay and Draymond slumping hard, reports of locker room drama, and several players with injury histories that could pop back up at any time. It'll be interesting to see how it pans out, especially if Boogie under-performs when he hits the court in a few months.    &gt; My bets are half on the Raptors, half on the Bucks to win the East and face... whoever's coming from the West. They're right when they're saying it's a bloodbath out there.  I would also keep an eye on the Pacers. They surprised everybody last offseason. Oladipo was previously written off as a bust and ended up as an excellent first option for them, blew everyone's expectations away, especially in the playoffs, and he's only been back for a few games so we might see him take another step this year and become an even bigger threat. Smart money is still on Bucks and Raptors, but both Mike Budenholzer and Kyle Lowry have long histories of putting up great regular season performances and then inexplicably collapsing in the playoffs, so anything could happen. I think Giannis is doing well enough to compensate for that, but it's hard to know until you get there. "
"Checking the standards, I'd consider Cleveland to be the second worst, unless you guys haven't squared off against the Cavaliers this season... not sure; can't remember, honestly.  I've heard that Porzingis has been recovering for a long time. Do you think his injury (or whatever it was that made him sit out) would have long-term negative effects on his performance over the next few years?

In the unlikely event you win enough games to accidentally get out of tanking mode and miss out on Zion or someone like him, what's the contingency plan you hope the Knicks would put in?  Also... ouch. I hate it when the owner stifles a good team into ruin. I could feel similarities to what the Bulls are facing. At least the owner's easing up.  As for what I think of this season: It's nigh impossible we're getting Warriors-Cavs Part V, that's for sure. It'd be weird if LeBron doesn't make the finals this year... but, it'd also be weird if the Warriors don't make the finals, too.

And then played like Smush Parker in the next game and got away with it because he has Kevin Durant on his team 
Felt bad for the numerous calls Harden has gotten this season so they overlook Kevin Durant with one of the most obvious calls you will ever see.

How the fuck did they not call Kevin Durant out of bounds? I’m astonished 😦 
Kevin Durant literally took a trip across the bay to SF before coming back to toss the ball back inbounds
Kevin Durant #sportsmanship 
Kevin Durant was out of bounds by about the length of one normal human being.
LOL. Kevin Durant was out of bounds for like 3 seconds.
Kevin Durant was /r/ActLikeYouBelong
"KEVIN DURANT WITH THE SAVE FROM THE UPPER BOWL, NO CALL — God bless you NBA refs!"
Watch Kevin Durant.  Just watch Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant is soooo desperate with this hero shit. He's been doing it since OKC
"I'm not saying you aren't supposed to hate him, and maybe even that you aren't supposed to boo him.  But Spurs fans do owe him for that championship he helped deliver, and I think that should give Kawhi a certain level of respect from the Spurs, and the fans.  That's the difference between Kawhi leaving vs guys like Vince Carter, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and Lebron James (in 2010).  Kawhi delivered a championship.  For example, I don't think the Thunder owe it to Durant to retire his jersey, but I do think the Spurs owe it to Kawhi."
"for some reason you are all over this thread shitting on LeBron.  just stop it.  This thread is for shitting on James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Chris Paul, and assorted other Rockets and Warriors but LeBron has no place here."
"This sub has so much potential holy shit James harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Austin Rivers, Draymond Green. Salt level over 9000"
"Probably because the Warriors are still better off playing Curry on ball than Livingston on ball + Curry off-ball.  Being a great off-ball player is awesome when you're playing next to a guy like Kevin fucking Durant.  This isn't even Livingston from 4 years ago, this is 33 year old Shaun Livingston"
"The difference between Danny and Kawhi was that, while Danny was busting his ass trying to guard Kevin Durant in our playoffs series, Kawhi was watching dodger games and being a diva. "

"Honestly, one of the things I've admired most about Lebron is how he has steered this conversation in the media.  Lebron is really good, but he should be vying against Tim Duncan/Kobe Bryant and now Steph Curry/Kevin Durant for best player of his decade(s) at this stage of his career with what he has accomplished rather than taking a shot at Kareem, Wilt, Russell, and/or MJ.  Now, I do think Lebron has a *great* chance of vaulting in to the conversation when it is all said and done, but I'm hesitant to say he was the best player of the 2000s and he's only in the running for the 2010s because he went to Miami and teamed up with 2 other guys who may have laid claim to best of the decade were it not for Lebron."
"He's gonna be a point who can pass, defend at a high level, an score occasionally.  But he's never going to be the main option on a championship team. Probably not even the number 2. His shooting and layup making is his biggest flaw and at the end of the day he has to fix those on his own. Work out and shoot a million jumpshots in the offseason.    Unless you think he will reach the point he can win on his own team. And if you look at the players who have won...he's not it.  I like him on this team. I dont like his shooting and layup making.   And I have similar thoughts on Ingram. There is literally no player in the league good enough to shoot iso 2s and win consistently. Not even the best in the league, Kevin Durant, could get it done like that. Other players like Derozan arent gonna get it done. And they are the elite.  He needs to develop into a winning player. He's pretty far along in my opinon, just needs to realize the iso midrange is a bailout shot not a first option. And he's not gonna learn that on his own team.   "

"Over Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, and Jimmy Butler?"
"Depends on what you classify as a elite stretch ""big""?  Do big ballhandlers Kevin Durant or Giannis (if he could shoot) count as a big? Or is it those who actually play inside primarily like Joel Embiid?  If Durant counts, then the big? Otherwise gimme the guard."

"Ingram was never going to live up to the hype of Kevin Durant. That comparison is going to be with Ingram forever and it's not fair. Durant is so unique and one of the best scorers of all time that it could be a while before we see someone like him.   Personally, I don't need Ingram to be an all world scoring machine. Ceiling wise, if he can become a better version of Andre Iguodala I would be happy. Defensively, he's long and can be disruptive. Offensively, even though he is struggling this year, I think he has the skills to be a point forward. We have to remember the Lakers have no sense of half-court offense, even more so without Lebron. I want to see that get fixed before we can officially call Ingram a bust or trash player. "
"He, literally, told OJ Mayo at his basketball clinic that he [Jordan] was the best player in the world when Mayo was just out of high school.  Kevin Durant said he [Durant] was the best player in the world.  This isn't uncommon."
"Plus, he got shut down by Matt Barnes the next year, and fucking Andre Roberson and Kevin Durant the year after. Dude’s not a demi-God. He’s very capable of getting shut down offensively and not unable of locking up his guy."
Even if this is true  Why does it matter? lmao  He made a mistake and then hired a PR firm (which tons of athletes do btw). Where's the issue?   I assume you say the same thing and have the same hatred for Jordan and Kobe for doing arguably way worse things right? At least be consistent.   Kevin Durant hired a Public relations adviser after his move to Golden State. What you are saying isn't even news lmao 
"Al Horford played quite well during his NBA rookie season, and finished second in ROY voting (behind Kevin Durant), having earned 30 first-place ROY votes. Al is also a 5x NBA All-Star and a 2x NCAA champion. The Celtics also won that Christmas Day game you mentioned (in which Ben Simmons fell two assists short of a trip dub, with a +/- of -17 in 38 minutes)."
"Or was it that Andrew Wiggins joined Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant, and Tracy McGrady as 7th youngest player to 7,000."
"I was born @ year 2000, here we go.  PG: Stephen Curry  SG: Paul George  SF: LeBron James  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Joel Embiid  All can shoot 3s decently (IDK about Embiid though). All can space the floor. All can finish well. All can switch in D to cover Curry. Can teamplay or ISO at any given moment. With that being said, spacing is key for today’s NBA so y’all are barbeque chicken. "
"Anthony davis, Kevin durant, Porzingas, were just getting a preview of whats to come"
Agreed but it sure as helps when you Kevin Durant. Imo kd is the one who led okc that year and not Westbrook. You give some players kd for nine years and the chances of making a finals appearance go up significantly 
At least he didn’t pull at Kevin Durant. 
The next Kevin Durant
"&gt;Dončić may have been born to play basketball, but he lives to put on a show. “We’ve said from day one, he’s almost like a matador,” Nowitzki says. “He loves playing off the crowd, loves to make spectacular plays.” Trying is its own form of daring. Dončić will take step-back threes against Kevin Durant with the game on the line and attempt lobs over some of the tallest players in the league. Then, if he fails, he will shrug and try again. Carlisle, one of the most meticulous coaches in the league, even encourages it. “The thing with a player like Luka: If you restrict him too much, you’ll take away some of his greatest gifts,” Carlisle says. “I can’t do that. We can’t do it.”\  Tbh that does sound like the matador"
I really don't like the thunder's orange compression gear. they remind me of those silly ass KD shoes  https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/3/24/11302044/kevin-durant-basketball-shoes-look-like-knee-high-boots
"You can be upset but you need to get tf over it. My lord. It’s not like Kevin Durant’s move, so stop acting like he’s Kevin Durant. It is that you didn’t have anyone else. You were bounced out of the first round. Your only 8th in the West even with DeRozen. He was hurt, he did not sit out for no reason, stop with the bs. Kawhi Leonard has been humble and helped the spurs for multiple years. You don’t win 2014 without him. To simply strip away what he’s done for the franchise because of one drama saga is nothing short of incomprehensible. I’m gonna get downvoted into oblivion because this is Nba fans and they only like the bandwagon opinions. "
"Durant should get booed by anyone who lays eyes on him. It’s the duty of every man, woman, and child to boo Kevin Durant anytime he steps in public."
"He didn't carry as hard as people really think and that showed on the last game against the Heat where everyone else showed up. He was definitely their best player, but it was not Dirk vs the Big 3. Kevin Durant this year and last year is better than 2011 Dirk in all categories, yet nobody is saying that he carried the Warriors."
"ofcourse we're going to go 46-0, 100% kyrie's going to average 40 a game, jayson tatum will evolve into kevin durant, jaylen brown is already basically a better klay thompson, al horford is bill russell with a 3 point shot and gordon hayward hasnt even evolved into his mecha-form yet and fuck terry rozier hasn't even shown his demon eye yet, trust me once this happens we go 46-0, then we go 46-0 in the playoffs guaranteed."
"&gt; Yea, it’s not like they added Kevin fucking Durant to their 73 win team or anything.  We're talking about 2016, what are you talking about?"
"&gt; That should be a hit against LeBron that he couldn't be what the Warriors were/are despite also having a big 3.    Yea, it’s not like they added Kevin fucking Durant to their 73 win team or anything. Or that in their first match up Kyrie and Love went down. Why do you choose to be willfully ignorant?   You’re right though, Jordan would’ve beat them each time with ease. He was infallible, after all. You sound bitter as hell"
"Even if he's the second or fifth best all time, it's not an outrageous claim.  I wouldn't hate the guy if he wasn't so damn good at basketball (or am I talking about Kevin Durant?) "

Kevin Durant is the Greatest Basketball Player of All Time.
Kevin durant and Curry
"Kd hired an analytics expert to track Lebron's game and openly says he looks up to him and tries to imitate him.  &gt;LeBron James has a not-so-secret admirer, and his name is Kevin Durant.  &gt;In an interview with Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated, Durant admits to a number of things, including his distaste for second place, his employment of a personal analytics expert and an affinity for LeBron:  &gt;LeBron is the most dominant player in the league and also one of the most efficient producers. He's the best, and Durant wants to be the best, so why not study (you guessed it) the best?  &gt;""That’s my guy,” Durant said (via Jenkins). “I looked up to him [James], and now I battle him.”  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1615870-kevin-durant-hires-analytics-expert-checks-lebron-james-stats-every-game?goback=.gde_4344339_member_235403911  However his recent interviews come off as salty I agree. He's probably disappointed he doesn't get the respect Lebron gets after winning his championships."
Kevin Durant over Tim Duncan?..
Kevin Durant. He shits on average twitter folks regularly. LeBron don't got the balls to do that. 
Kevin Durant without an elite PG: MVP
Wow even warriors fans will admit that the team got better after adding Kevin Durant? Shocking info there
"This is the incorrect answer. Warriors would've still won in 2015 despite Kevin and Kyrie playing? I guess you could argue that. I don't believe they would, but you could argue it.    But how can you argue that the Warriors would've definitely won 2017 and 2018 without Durant? "
Kevin Durant wants to *know your location*

Kevin “morton” Durant. 
And Kevin ‘DPOY’ Durant gave up a 34 point triple double. 
"Individually, Westbrook's season is superior to KD's. The only stat that KD wins in is WS and WS/48 which, when you look at supporting casts, makes total sense.

The very fact that Kevin Durant who plays the same position put up 35 points on 65% TS in the Finals against Lebron.  Jordan would never allow his matchup to absolutely destroy him in the Finals.
It’s still considered the super max though as of 2017 thanks to the new kevin Durant rule. Both super maxes are at 35% hence “super max”
"Kevin ""Moneybags"" Durant "
"Reggie Jackson finished 11-16, with 32 points, 1 assist, 9 rebounds.   Kevin Durant: 5-21, 15 points, 4 assists, 13 rebounds.    Russell Westbrook: 6-24, 15 points, 7 assists, 9 rebounds.    Jackson had 5 points in the final minute to help OKC erase a 75-80 deficit and send it to overtime, and then had 6 of OKC’s 12 points in overtime.   An extremely underrated game from Jackson. I’m not a fan of how he acted in OKC leading up to his trade, but he honestly bailed out the Thunder so hard this game.   KD’s MVP season, Thunder about to go down 3-1 in the first round, and Jackson comes up with the game of his career.  Who knows what would’ve happened if the Thunder end up losing in the first round in 2014. The whole landscape of the NBA might be different.  "
"The American basketball player, who plays small forward and attended The University of Texas at Austin from the years 2006-2007 AD, known as Kevin Durant will not return to the Golden State Warriors, a member of the NBA’s Western Conference, once next season  commences"
Kevin Durant getting sensative? Naahhh.
"No, he was just doubled on catch by Anthony Davis and Jrue holiday.    Kevin Durant even called out the tactic as being cheap. There isn't a guard in the entire league that could do anything against that defense. If you want to commit 3 people to preventing a guy from scoring, you can stop him from scoring, and that's what they did.   It's not a coincidence that aminu went from 9 ppg to 18 and was crazy efficient. They literally left every single one of our front court players wide open and dared them to make shots, and no one but Aminu could. Turner, nurkic, Collins, etc all bricked wide open shot after wide open shot.   Nothing you can do but pass out of the double. If you don't have a good supporting cast that can score 4v3, you'll lose "
Kevin Durant + Green should do the trick... 
"You think about this wrong though. He's not just a man sitting around being rich, buying stuff. If he was, yeah what's the difference between 100 and 125 million?   But with guys of his stature it's not just personal wealth. These guys are like corporations. He's not just Kevin Durant. He's the CEO of Kevin Durant Inc. He has business ventures and investments all sorts of things going on, Many people and resources tied up in his activities.   In that context, the difference between 100 and 125 million is huge. If the CEO of a company blew a chance at 125 million and only came away with 100 million he'd be fired the next day. "
"&gt; Yup, Kawhi was playing with legends  And poor Harden was only playing with scrubs like (at the time) 3x scoring champ+3x first team all-nba Kevin Durant, 2x all-nba 2nd team Russell Westbrook and first team all-defense Serge Ibaka.  If only he had 38 year old Duncan, 37 year old Manu, and 32 year old Parker to take attention off of him, he would have really thrived!"
Kevin Durant needs to leave Golden State so life goes back to normal. 
"I’m talking 1v1, Kevin Durant is just going to keep going at you because almost everyone’s a mismatch to him. 5v5 LeBron will get his and expose the team. "

Now describe losing Kevin Durant
"Again, read twice before embarrassing yourself. The OP CLEARLY talks about the 2017 team.   Did the 2017 team play in the 2016 finals? Did Kevin Durant play in 2016 NBA Finals?   Can you read?  "
"They have Kevin Durant now, and the Warriors have scored very well against OKC on average since he went there."
If they have to choose between Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson I don't think that's a very hard (basketball) decision
Sign Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant in the offseason
"&gt;I suggest you just keep playing, man, and don't worry about what goes on at the top of things. Relax.  -Kevin Durant  "
"Hey sorry for the delay, I got caught up with some other stuff.  I compared the 12-13, 13-14, and 15-16 season for his OKC years. I didn't want to use 14-15 because he was out for so much of the year, so that's why I included 12-13. Then I used 16-17, 17-18, and the 18-19 season so far. Here's how they compare:   Stat | OKC | GSW ---------|----------|---------- RSD (PPG) | 24.1% | 29.5% RDS (TS%) | 16.3% | 20.3% GBT (PPG) | 12.0% | 15.5% GBT (TS%) | 14.1% | 19.6%  Incredible; across the board, OKC Kevin Durant is much more consistent. I wonder how much of it is due to him being in a different role on GSW where he doesn't have to score every night, but the surprising thing here is the TS%. Night in and night out, he was putting up incredibly consistent TS% in OKC.    Crazy stat: he only had a single game with less than 20 points in the 15-16 season, and it was because he only played 16 minutes."
"I'd say:      1. LeBron James   2. Kevin Durant   3. James Harden   4. Stephen Curry   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo   6. Kawhi Leonard   7. Anthony Davis   8. Russell Westbrook 9. Paul George   10. Kyrie/Dame/Jokic/Embiid      The rest, I agree with. You could switch up Curry and Harden, PG and Westbrook or Embiid/Dame. But I'd definitely say that Harden is top 3 at this point. I see an argument for Curry over Harden, but this is just how I'd put it."
"Wut? Some of those teams have Kevin Durant. Some don’t. You can’t group them, he didn’t beat the one with Durant lol"
"Lebron has never lost an MVP to voter fatigue. There are three seasons in which he was better than the actual winner of the MVP though, which are 05-06 (Steve Nash), 10-11 (Derrick Rose), and 16-17 (Russell Westbrook). The problem is that in each of those years, there was someone else that was better than the MVP winner as well as Lebron.   You have Dirk in 05-06, Dwight Howard in 10-11, and Harden/Kawhi in 16-17.   He wasn't good enough to win one prior to 05-06. Didn't have MVP caliber seasons in 06-07 or 07-08. After his last one, Kevin Durant, Curry x2, and Harden's were all clearly deserved.   2010-2011 is the only one I think you could make a case for him to deserve, so at most, Lebron got snubbed once.  Jordan on the other hand should have 2 of Magic Johnson's MVP's and Charles Barkley's MVP. He was the best player those years and didn't win it.   Jordan got robbed in 1997 as well, but they did the make up call for him in 1998. Jordan should have been 97 MVP, and Malone should have been 98, so those should have just been flip flopped. "
KEVIN DURANT IS A BITCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Paul George  Kevin Durant  Steven Adams  Pretty damn good considering we have only been around for about 10 years
Once upon a time there was a lazy student who turned to the internet for help. He went on a site called reddit and got in an argument with someone. That person was Kevin Durant. The two of them fell madly in love and hissed happily ever after.    The end.
"&gt;The only players who has been able to get within the top 30 in both are Kevin Durant, Rasheed Wallace, Andrea Bargnani, Shawn Marion, and Raef Lafrentz.  Donyell Marshall and Robert Horry, too."
Kevin Durant is a great defender too but his offense is miles ahead. There's no way Giannis is better than KD at the moment. 
Steph Curry  Chris Mullin  Kevin Durant  Rick Barry   Wilt Chamberlain   HM: Klay and Spree
"I'd say he's still at peak popularity, but when you play next to Kevin Durant, you're going to lose some steam in comparison. "
It’s obviously because Kevin Durant
The coach literally lists him and plays him at the guard position. It's been like that for MONTHS. LeBron and Kevin Durant have played at the Foward position all year. It is not the fucking same lol.
"Maybe living on the coast you don't realize this, but people in small markets, especially in the Midwest don't have a lot of opportunity for entertainment. In Oklahoma specifically, the only permenant local entertainment before the Thunder were OU/OSU football. Major acts never pass through here. Wanna see Drake, Rihanna, Beyonce etc? You gotta take a 3hr road trip to Dallas.   So when the Thunder came to OKC people were beyond exited. Our fixed entertainment market just got it's first professional sports team. And it wasn't soccer and the MLS or some bullshit like that. This was the NBA.Not only was it just an NBA team. This was a great NBA team, with 2 budding all stars.  Kevin Durant could not have been more loved by the people of OKC. He had the same kind of love here that Tom Brady has in Boston.   So when you ask, how can we still be salty. Theres's a couple reasons.   1, We don't have anything else to distract us. We're not Miami where there's a billion things to do, and people don't show up to the game until halftime. A Thunder game might be the only major event on the city schedule all week.  2, KD broke our hearts. We loved him to death, and he left us. OKC is like that kind of chubby practice girlfriend a highschool kid with low self-condifence has. We loved his awkward gangly ass, and he left us. And not only did he leave us, but he left him for the hot popular girl who'd been bullying us. That's not something you really ever get over. Sure, you move on, but you don't get over it. "
He's not nearly good enough to justify more votes than Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis. Those are superstars. To say that him being white has no effect on how fans in general receive him is just naive. People tend to have a bias of varying severity in favor of their own or similar ethnic groups. 
"Kevin Durant is a super star. If you asked a group of 100 random people if they knew who Nick Young (aka Swaggy P) was, you'd get a similar amount of 'yes' that you would if you asked them if they knew who Nikola Jokic was... It doesn't mean they're the same level of player, it just means he has a broader media appeal. Another example of this was Kris Humphries a few years back. Everyone and their mother knew who he was because he was with the Kardashians. "
Is Kevin Knox better than Kevin Durant? 
No he isn't lol  If you asked a casual person who Kevin Durant is they would probably know. Most wouldn't know nick young 
With Lonzo we don't need Kevin Durant.   Kevin Durant*needs us*
This is going to be better then anything I could tell you. I did not read the KD write up but I’m sure this will tell you why he’s one of the best but not with the best of the best.  http://www.backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/
damn so is lonzo gonna recruit Kevin Durant?
"This is rather remarkable irony. OKC drafted themselves into James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Serge Ibaka. Then managed to squander it all with 10 years of shitty coaches from Scott Brooks to Billy Donovan. 2016 was OKC's pinnacle of underachievement due to awful coaching."
"Lol 😂 do you think, by any slight chance, Kevin Durant left due to Westbrook’s poor shot selection during crunch time in the playoffs? "
[I mean the man himself said he plays like him ](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/los-angeles-lakers-brandon-ingram-kevin-durant-like-looking-in-the-mirror-071916) as long as he isn’t saying he’s as good or better wharsnthe problem with saying they play similar?
“Kevin Durant lite” mark Jackson shut your ass up
"If you’re saying by those standards Jordan nor Kobe nor LeBron had weaknesses. Neither of these 3 hampered their offenses enough to have “weaknesses”.  You’re not thinking about eras and how offense changes over time. Jordan played in a time where not having a 3-pt shot was not a weakness and having it was more of a bonus to the team. Going by that Jordan could pretty much get anywhere he wanted and score, post and perimeter. Mid to high 80% FT shooter.  Same for Kobe. While Kobe wasn’t Steph level 3pt scorer his era didn’t warrant a shooter of that magnitude and compared to the era he played in, Kobe HAD to be defended from the 3 because he was dangerous. Kobe was a proficient post player, excellent mid range shooter and was a good slasher. Mid 80% FT shooter as well.  LeBron may have had a weakness for the perimeter shot earlier in his career but could still knock it down once in a while, and in his prime LeBron developed a reliable mid range jumper with his amazing driving ability. And at this point now in his career he’s become a pretty solid 3pt shooter to where its not a problem for his offense if he pulls it. Only possible weakness I could see for LeBron is his FT shooting, which wasn’t THAT bad but it could’ve been better than the low-mid 70% range. He’s developed a nice post game too.   By these guys’ primes there was no real weakness that you could exploit from their games.  Steph’s “weaknesses” have a pretty good hiding spot behind the Warriors offense. Like the other guy said, he can’t post up, but also, Steph can also get affected pretty good if his 3pt isn’t falling. It’s not easy to notice, but typically when he isn’t on its when his 3pt shot isn’t falling. Steph has a mid range shot and is pretty proficient at it, but his paint-to 20ft scoring is in the weaker side of his game. He’s a weaker, smaller built player who lacks significant strength to force his way in, he has to use screens a lot. Easy to block at the rim too.   Basically, Steph’s weakness is probably his offense inside the 3pt line. Whereas MJ, Kobe and LeBron were unstoppable in that range and are better creators in this area than Steph is.   I’d argue Kevin Durant is the more “unstoppable” player than Steph is tbh, that’s why KD’s Finals performances are usually superior to Steph, because he’s definitely the better scorer inside the 3pt line and in the paint. At 7’0, dude can shoot over pretty much anything and is proficient everywhere.      "
Kevin Durant 
"Kevin ""the Serpent"" Durant"
Fr does he think he's impressing anyone here? We all can do that blindfolded. I'm literally Kevin Durant
The minutes argument just doesn't hold water. Warriors probably have the worst wing depth in the league. He got and would get more minutes with the Warriors than he would get on most other teams. He just has no chance of becoming the starter over Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant.  He also ghosted the team and all the players. The guy wasn't just making a business move.
"That was me, I got downvoted hard for questioning it and asking if playing on a dynasty and being mentored by the likes of Iguodala and Durant were worth taking the $5 mil with the Warriors now for his career in the long run. One notable upvoted reply was “grow up, never count another man’s bread son”. Another upvoted reply was “mentorship means nothing, Kevin Love will mentor him”. Sooo yeah lol"
Apparently it’s   - Ben to LA - Anthony Davis to LA - Durant to LA - Cousins to LA - Westbrook to LA - Klay to LA - Kevin Love to LA - Jimmy Butler to LA 
Kevin Durant
"Because people who actually know the game of basketball know the Warriors do not win any finals without Kevin Durant. They sure as shit don’t beat Houston last year without him.   Hell you can gameplay and scheme in the playoffs against Curry, fuckall you can do against 6-11 dude pulling up from 30. "
"Kevin ""the Servant"" Durant"
"This is the nba. Do you think people hate on harden because they believe he is a bad person? Or just because he annoys them on the court? Do you think nba fans think Kevin Durant is a bad person for going to the warriors, or they are just annoyed that sport they love is less interesting? Sports ‘hate’ just means something different. We’re not actually judging the morality of these guys. I don’t actually ‘hate’ curry in the true sense of the word. He seems like a good family man off the court but he and his marketing machine annoy me in the context of the nba."
"Whoever goes #1 might be a bust. I know it's due to injury, but Greg Oden and Kevin Durant is a good example."
"I’m sorry but AD does not deserve to be in this conversation. Yes, he puts up great stats, but he can’t win. Clearly not valuable enough to be MVP.  That said, here’s my top 5:  1. James Harden  2. Nikola Jokic  3. Giannis Antentokounmpo  4. Joel Embiid  5. Kevin Durant"
"Honestly the hardest road stuff is the most ridiculous crap.   Dude was being questioned on whether it was personally difficult for him to leave OKC. His full quote was   &gt;This is the hardest road because I don’t know anybody here. I’ve never lived in this community. … This is not the easiest situation because I’m out of my comfort zone.   and the rest of the piece was talking about how it was tough for him to leave his friends in OKC.   Now 90% of people legit think the quote was on how hard it would be to actually win games... Probably doesn't help that when I went trying to find the [original quote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/?utm_term=.2822b3da92db) I legitimately had to go 10 articles deep, because the first 9 were all random media figures taking just the snippet without any of the context there.

"Again not a perfect 1-to-1 but:  Tatum-Durant comparisons from [JA Adande](https://www.celticsblog.com/2018/9/7/17832348/ja-adande-kevin-durant-comparisons-not-that-far-off-when-it-comes-to-jayson-tatum-celtics-boston-nba), [Blakely](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/blakely-jayson-tatum-next-kevin-durant-not-yet-hes-trending-there), [Reid Forgrave](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/video/forgrave-jayson-tatum-has-some-kevin-durant-him)  The Smart-Dray comparisons have been around for a while, though Smart covers 1-4, Dray covers 2-5.  Watch any Curry/Kyrie matchup for details  Klay/Gordon might be the biggest stretch but I think it's apt.  Again, not saying we're AS GOOD as the Warriors, merely that the creation of the starting lineup is meant to have the same allocation of strengths and same chemistry make-up. An elite point guard, a second sharpshooter threat, a DPOY candidate, and a do-everything offensive weapon. Also, Al Horford (who fills in a bit in the Dray camp)."
Doesn't even mention Kevin Durant smh
"This comment is glorious. *Pre-prime* LeBron and Bosh??? This is an incredible rewrite of history. Lebron had **two** MVP’s lmao. He’s been in his prime since 2007. Bosh had 4 straight seasons of 20/10 seasons before he went to the Heat. The year before LeBron went to the Heat, he averaged 30/7/8.5. Stop making it seem like they were up-and-comers when they went to Miami- they were fucking gold medalists and superstars.  Rodman before going to the Bulls had 2 defensive player of the year awards and 7 1st team all defense appearances. The Bulls were also bringing back possibly the greatest player of all time still in his prime, so bringing up their 47 wins is irrelevant.   Point is, NBA history has plenty of examples of teams adding free agents and then dominating the league until those stars leave (just like the Warriors are doing now). That doesn’t mean we need to put an asterisk on their titles, and it doesn’t make them any less earned. It sucks as a fan, but any team in the league would add Kevin Durant if they could, no matter how many wins they had the year before."
Kevin Durant definitely won't be a Warrior next season. 
Mario Hezonja and Kevin Durant. Why wait until this summer?

Why didnt the league investigate golden state for signing kevin fucking durant? like wtf????? I mean Chandler parsons got paid more to bang fucking insta thots
What are you talking about? I'm clearly Kevin Durant!
Do u really have an OKC Kevin durant flair
Kevin Durant
" I need to know the date he comes back so I can buy tickets!! I want to be able to say I saw a lineup of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins play an NBA game."
"Last year's Last 2 Minute Report analysis by 538 shows that Kemba Walker, Anthony Davis, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Demar Derozan, Damian Lillard, and Kyrie Irving (among others) had calls more often called against them than in their favor.  James Harden, Giannis Antentokoumpo, and Demarcus Cousins were among the few stars who got more calls in their favor in the last 2 minutes than calls against them.  https://pudding.cool/2017/02/two-minute-report/"
Did the nba ever release a statement about the Kevin Durant out of bounds non call?
"“(Kevin) keeps telling me he likes Seattle,” says Green — “Of all the places. Maybe he just wants to play there someday.” — “You hating on me, Draymond?” Durant asks, sssmiling. Green grins back. “No man. We need you to stay. Stay, Kevin. Ssssssssstay.” Durant sticks his tongue out, then slithers off."
"""Kevin Durant needs title with Supersonics to enter GOAT convo"""
Brandon Ingram needs to be more like Kevin Durant - Stephen A. | First Take
This is the third season now since Kevin Durant broke my heart and my tears are still saltwater
"""Kevin Durant needs title with Suns to enter GOAT convo"""
"Ah yes, the Kevin Durant phenomenon. Where a fanbase acts like they drafted a guy and defend him vehemently against everything despite looking foolish"
"James Harden - 12.4 threes on 22.4 shots = 55% of shots from 3.  Paul George - 8.7 threes on 20.4 shots = 43% of shots from 3.  Kevin Durant - 5.0 threes on 19.5 shots = 26% of shots from 3.  Lebron - 5.6 threes on 19.6 shots = 29% of shots from 3.  Curry - 11.3 threes on 20.0 shots = 56% of shots from 3.  Curry and Harden are in another stratosphere when it comes to percentage of shots taken from 3, compared to the other guys you named.  Curry's shooting percentages are insane considering the # of threes he's taking.  That doesn't mean Harden has ""horrible percentages"" merely because he isn't as good a shooter as Curry, the greatest shooter of all time."
"I can see one possible situation where they might let him go, and that's if Kevin Durant and a couple more prime free agents all tell them they want to pull a Miami team up to form an instant contender. But since there's maybe a thousand in one chance of something like that happening, probably not worth talking about."
Kevin Durant would probably average around 50 ppg 
I don't think it will be forgotten but why would/should someone who won't even know a league with Kevin Durant in it care? 
Kevin “LeBron James” Durant
Kevin Durant has arguably the greatest footwork/ handle of any 7 footer in NBA history so I don’t get your argument. 
"Kevin Durant literally shot 43% from the field and 29% from 3 his first year and won ROY. He also didn't have forced expectations of playoffs on his shoulders until his 3rd season.   Lonzo sat out a big chunk last season and rehabbed all summer, and people were acting like he was supposed to come out as John Wall with a Steph Curry shot.   The fact they're on the Lakers + LeBron gives these kids no breathing room. Give them time. "
Yeah but Kevin Durant is a generational talent.
"Dallas Mavericks send: Wesley Matthews, Dwight Powell  Golden State Warriors send: Kevin Durant"
"I don't think he's sensitive. In the interview, I think he was just calling it what it really is-hate. He receives criticism, but I would say a lot of the comments I see about Harden fall in the ""hate"" category (they don't offer any worthy insight) rather than critique. When I think of someone being sensitive,  I think of Kevin Durant and his fake online profiles defending himself. Harden does not respond at all to criticism unless directly asked about it."
Always weird to see my childhood idol working with Kevin Durant/the Warriors.
Kevin “Adolf Hitler” Durant
"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/10/15/17977348/2018-19-nba-season-trends-anthony-davis-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-kevin-durant  &gt; ""There are whispers around the league that neither Jimmy Butler nor Kawhi Leonard wants to play with LeBron"""
True.  IMHO kevin durant raped the NBA and its fans

Umm according to the advanced statistics usually wingspan value added per free throw minutes squared having Kevin Durant makes your team significantly better
It will be pretty crazy to take Tim Duncan and Tony Parker over Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
It comes down to Draymond Green acting like an idiot and getting away with it and milk snake Kevin Durant joining the 73 win team after they bodybagged him in the playoffs.
"What's the excuse? It was a statistical anomaly, and it doesn't happen with a healthy CP3.  Inb4 ""Iguodola was injured"". Yeah, so was Mbah A Moute who was arguably just as important since he was going to gaurd Kevin Durant. "
That's not even true. That's like saying teams would have no motivation to get better if the Warriors didn't add Kevin Durant.
Three-point shooting so far tonight:   Steph Curry 3 of 10  Klay Thompson 0 of 4  Kevin Durant 1 of 5  Draymond Green 0 of 4.  And... DeMarcus Cousins 3 of 4.
I'd really like you to answer that question about the Spurs. Did the 2013 Spurs need to sign Kevin Durant? They lost in 7 to LeBron. They clearly needed more help am i right???
"I don’t know why KD isn’t in Swiffer commercials.   “Well thanks for coming to my dinner party Kevin Durant but the sauce blew up on it’s on my ceiling! Could you get that?”  “Nah, but you can...with Swiffer” "
"Just because they lost doesn't mean they needed him lol. He was the 2nd best player in the world and they were up 3-1. Think about what you just said. They need to add Kevin Durant because they lost game 7 in the finals by a single possession? That's nonsense. Absolute nonsense. The only the thing the Warriors needed was to not choke in 2017, they had an MVP, they had two other all stars, they won 73 fucking games. Any team that won seventy three games doesn't ""NEED"" to add another MVP to their roster."
And apparently we’re the favorites to sign Kevin Durant this summer lol  Rumors 
"It was fourth quarter, with less than ten seconds left and Golden State was down by 2. T h e arena was so loud, that Steph couldn’t hear his own thoughts.          He calmly walked the ball up the court and saw Russell waiting for him at the half court line, watching him intently with his eyes. Once Steph reached half court, he quickly passed the ball to Kevin and once Kevin touched the ball, every fan in the arena instantly booed.          "" CUPCAKE! CUPCAKE!” everyone chanted in the stands. Kevin calmly dribbled the ball and watched as his former teammate, Andre Roberson, checked him.          After passing the ball, Steph ran straight through the lane and took a screen from Draymond. Russell bumped into Draymond and then hurriedly moved to catch up to Steph, but this was enough space to give the sharpshooter room.          Kevin dribbled the ball to the top of the key and Andre followed. He gave him a quick in and out with the ball and then passed it to Steph once he saw him open. Steph caught the ball in the corner behind the three point line and quickly released it in the air. Russell moved to contest the shot, but was too late.         The clock was running down as the ball sailed to the basket. Steph had landed and watched as the ball moved in the air. He closed his eyes and silently prayed that the ball would sink in the net. When he heard the buzzer go off, he opened his eyes and saw the ball rattle in the hoop. The whole Warriors bench stood and watched. BUZZZZZ!!!!!        ""  WOOOOO!!!!!” Steph yelled excitedly. He raised his arms in the air as Thunder fans booed. The team was running onto the floor to hug him and celebrate the game winner. Thunder players were shaking their heads at the sudden lost and standing in disbelief. Steph continued to stand confidently as Kevin was the first to reach him. He put his forehead to Steph’s and yelled.       “ YEAH!” Kevin yelled out loud. He brought a hand to Steph’s head and smiled. Steph looked in his eyes and smiled, too. At that moment, Steph focused solely on Kevin and wanted nothing more than to kiss him. Kevin was leaning close to him, so Steph leaned up and kissed him.            It went silent in the arena, every fan either stopped cheering or booing and watched as Stephen Curry kissed Kevin Durant."
"1 MVP ""candidate"", 2 ""all stars... in the east, I guess"", a solid role player who's way past his prime now, and a 1st overall pick *who is so far a massive bust* with 680 career minutes played *total* is not worth more than Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson, no"
"I think y'all are forgetting the biggest narrative that year, Kevin Durant went to the Warriors leaving the Thunder to fall into obscurity (more or less). Then Westbrook averaged a 30 point triple double and got one hell of a game winner on the game he broke the single season triple double record. After he hit that game winner, the narrative was in full swing behind him and he won. "
"Yeah they taught me that a pussy like Kevin Durant can’t win on a team without having 17 other all stars on his team same goes for Demarcus bitch ass Cousins. Let’s be clear, Warriors wouldn’t have won in 2015 if Cleveland had Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love on the floor and healthy. In 2016 when they were “the best team ever assembled” they blew a 3-1 lead. 2017 was statistically the worst year for every team, the worst year by every team in NBA history and the Warriors easily won with the addition of Kevin Snake Durant. And last season the Rockets would most likely would have won if Chris Paul didn’t get injured I mean come on the Rockets were up by two games. WARRIORS ARE FULL OF PUSSY ASS BITCHES"
If we call that asinine we don't have any good words left for saying Siakam is totally just as talented as Kevin Durant and Steph Curry
"When scoring a bucket in gargabe time against a tanking team means the same for this guy's list than scoring a game winning shot in the PO in a game 7 then that list has no value whatsoever.  Not to mention that he just puts the weight he wants on the things he wants.  Chris Paul as #21 player of all time ahead of Stockton, Curry, Durant or D-Wade is enough to just qualify that list as complete garbage.  Im sorry but KG at #8 is insane.   &gt; I think a reasonable downgrade is fair, but that still leaves Pippen in the top thirty.  Pippen was in the low 40s of that list when it was released. We are talking about a guy with 0 MVPs, 0 finals MVP and 7 All-Stars that averaged 16ppg in his career. There are a lot of players that have more accolades, more awards and better stats than him .... and actually leading their teams.  Duncan, Kobe, Lebron, Gary Payton, Garnett, D-Wade, Allen Iverson, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook  would all enter for sure in a new top 50 list and that will put Pippen out of the list guaranteed."
They were able to play at a slow pace because their defense somehow held it's own against the Warriors then the Warriors added Kevin Durant and their defense didn't stand a chance so they were forced to play catch up the entire series. 
"I normally want to say something more constructive, but this is pretty much trash. I appreciate your effort, but it is very selective the stats you are putting up. You skip a lot of Lebron seasons and you skip a lot of MJ seasons, while including his baseball year for some reason. You also don’t note that 4/6 and 2/3 are the ummm... same.  But what is more interesting is the evolution of the MVP voting if anything. Bosh was an MVP candidate when forming the super trio. And Lebron was always the leader of the Cavs, which took the air out of the rise of Kyrie and stymied teammates of MVP calibers like Love and Bosh.   Somewhere Bosh wrote about this. The sacrifice of being in a supportive role rather than the growth of an individual player with freedom to be great on their own.   In 2016, Kyrie’s was overlooked for his role, when he was getting 20-30pts per playoff game. In 2017, Lebron was on a team with Derrick Rose, Wade, Isaiah Thomas, and Kevin Love.   I think what would be an interesting comparison is how many aggregate allstar appearances his teammates had. For instance, look at Harden and CP3. If CP3 was on his own, he would have finished much higher in MVP voting. Westbrook wasn’t in the conversation when Durant was the “leader,” of the Thunder. And Paul George took a backseat to Westbrook last year.   Getting MVP votes does not denote the quality of players. Steph Curry isn’t surrounded by nobody’s because Klay Thompson, Draymond, Igoudala, and now Durant, and it doesn’t say a single thing about Steph’s value or individual abilities.  James notoriously builds his teams with other superstars. When he returned to Cleveland, he joined Kyrie and pushed for the trade for Kevin Love. Nearly an entire roster was uprooted. Same with Miami and their moves to bring in James and Bosh.   They are very close in skill and abilities and their leadership. I don’t take anything away from either of them and there’s a reason there’s such a tight debate. Measuring MVP votes is arbitrary and not at all a controlled environment for comparison because the opponents aren’t the same and voting isn’t the same, let alone a valuable measure of talent, leadership, or domination. "
You can't forget the Fuck Kevin Durant aspect. 
Percentage of team's points scored in games they played:  * Chris Paul '09: ~24% * Steph Curry '16: ~26% * Kevin Durant '17: ~22%  I'd say scoring around a quarter of your squad's points is a very significant share and constitutes as a large portion of the team's scoring load.
Would Kevin Durant even start at point guard for the Warriors? 
Kevin Durant. I would attack him emotionally until he's worn down
"Side question, why do talking heads always say shit like ""Kevin Durant is the best pure scorer"", when he never appears on any all time scoring lists?  Is KD overrated?"
Kevin Durant. Was gonna pick Nate but that mafucker looks tough on second thought
More Kevin Wendell Crumb than Kevin Durant.
That IT firm? Kevin Durant.
"&gt;Most help of all time  Have you heard this guy called Kevin Durant?  Bulls without MJ: 55 wins, flameout in the 2nd round  Bulls with MJ: 3peat  You see the trend? "
Kevin Durant should probably qualify
"&gt; This Green knows what to do when defenses don't guard him. The tactic isn't new, and the solution usually isn't to jack more 3s -- not on this roster. When Green catches the ball wide-open on the perimeter, he flicks it to Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant, and in one motion sprints toward them for an impromptu screen. If no one is on Green, that means no defender will meet his star teammate on the other side of that pick. And that is death.  All of this. He doesn't really need to shoot well threes as long as he's not stopping the offense dead, hesitating and hitching before a shot. And when his mind is in the right place, this team can start humming.  &gt; he exists almost outside of Toronto's offense  I haven't seen a Raptors game in a while but this was very apparent before. Wonder if it has somewhat improved."
"I'd like to quote Lil B for this special occasion. ""Fuck Kevin Durant"" "
"Assuming there’s a top 10-level player on the same team as those players that are playing poorly, usually yes.  Now if you’re only talking about one or two guys, especially if they’re not actually important parts of the team, or if there are multiple elite players on the team, that’s not going to be the case. People can discuss, say, Draymond Green playing poorly without any sort of “carrying” narrative for Steph Curry, because he’s also playing with Kevin Durant. You could say “oh, Norman Powell and CJ Miles have been pretty bad this year” without saying Kawhi is carrying the Raptors because there are a ton of other players who have been noted as playing very well on that team.  In the case of LeBron and the Lakers, that’s absolutely not true. There’s endless shit-talk about Ball and Ingram, who are starters, plus a lesser degree of criticism for Kuzma, because of how limited he is, or Hart, because of how inconsistent he is, or basically their entire bench for being full of memes.   Seems like you’re getting way too caught up in semantics trying to catch me out for whatever reason when I was clearly using Lonzo and Ingram as examples because they’re the *most* criticised players on that team."
Brandon Ingram has the higher ceiling. If he learns to shoot 3s at 40% - potential he flashed at Duke - then he is Kevin Durant Lite.  He's good at everything except shooting 3s already - it's just a matter of him putting it all together on a game by game basis. Consistency is a bitch.
And Kevin “that was like a passing of the torch” Durant with the ego
"How exactly did they keep the best one for the team? Kevin Durant is in a league above Westbrook on the all-time list, and James Harden is proving to everybody this year that he can carry a team just as well as anyone in history can. What exactly has Westbrook done other than statpad his way into first round exits? "
"&gt; I think Hakeem, MJ and Russell were just better than Duncan,  Duncan had longevity, but those three IMO had better peaks.  Did you saw peak Russell play? Because if you didnt I dont know what you are talking about. Just saying that with some players you seem to go with just eye-test and accolades dont matter but for others you just play the awards card. You have to be consistent.  I just wanna throw this link up here: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/def_rtg_career.html  Best CAREER defending ratings in the history of the league. Duncan sits at #3 and he is the highest of all the players you mentioned barring the old guys we have no data.   Also calling Lebron an incredible defender is completely exaggerated. He was a good defender in his peak but defence its actually one of his weaknesses if you compare him with other GOATS like MJ, Kobe or Duncan himself.  Peak Lebron had to guard Jason Terry in the 2011 finals and he just couldnt guard him at all. Not to mention that Kevin Durant went to 35ppp 2 seasons ago in the finals, and in last years Finals Lebron avoided at all cost to guard him.  I'd go with something like this:  - Tier 1, GOAT Defenders: Duncan, MJ and Hakeem. - Tier 2, Incredible Defenders: Bill Russell, Kareem. - Tier 3, Good Defenders: Larry Bird, Lebron. - Tier 4, Solid Defenders when they actually cared: Shaq, Wilt.  - Tier 5, Defense? what's that?: Magic"
Calling Westbrook worse than Kevin Durant and James Harden isn't an insult to Westbrook.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nba.com/amp/league/gmsurvey/2018  If you were starting a franchise today and could sign any player in the NBA, who would it be?  1.

"Literally word for word. https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-calls-environment-playing-with-lebron-james-toxic-says-it-ventures-beyond-the-basketball-court/  So much hype comes from being around LeBron from other people,"" Durant said. ""He has so many fanboys in the media. Even the beat writers just fawn over him. I'm like, we're playing basketball here, and it's not even about basketball at certain points. So I get why anyone wouldn't want to be in that environment because it's toxic. Especially when the attention is bullshit attention, fluff. It's not LeBron's fault at all; it's just the fact you have so many groupies in the media that love to hang on every word. Just get out of the way and let us play basketball."""
So what your saying is... Kevin Durant is the most valuable Warrior of all time. 
PG: Jason Kidd  SG: Michael Jordan  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Larry Bird  C: Hakeem 
"Steph Curry - Damian Lillard - Kemba Walker James Harden - Russell Westbrook - De'Aaron Fox (yeah, I said it) Kevin Durant - Kawhi Leonard - Paul George Greek Freak - LeBron James - KAT Anthony Davis - Nikola Jokic - Joel Embiid "
You realize that Cavs became the 1st team in history to ever overcome 3-1 deficit to win NBA finals?  Which was completely unthinkable considering Warriors were overwhelming favorites to win that series.   There's a reason why Warriros went out and signed Kevin Durant to make sure that it would never happen again.  I completely understand LeBron's view as that NBA Championship elevated him into argubaly the GOAT.
"He won't, players are not going to vote for him nor is the media. Other players will get ahead of him. He is front court, so you have to expect players/media to vote Paul George, Anthony Davis, Jokic, Lebron, Kevin Durant 100% ahead of him, with Aldridge, KAT and Tobias Harris probably ahead of him."
I think if you were a 5 time All Star you got an automatic bid into the draft pool. They had wildcards for players who weren't 5 time all stars yet but still valid picks like Kevin Durant at the time.
"Uhh, [the refs put it in their L2M report of the game](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2814006-rockets-vs-warriors-l2m-report-confirms-kevin-durant-was-out-of-bounds-in-ot).  "
&gt; KAWHI LEONARD and Kevin Durant could possibly link up at the New York Knicks next summer and scupper the Los Angeles Lakers’ hopes of landing Anthony Davis.  lol
"Media loves Luka. They still aren’t going to vote for him over those 5 guys who are all putting up near MVP seasons.   They obviously love Luka but they take their job seriously. Very few are going to sit down, fill out a ballot and actually list Luka over Kevin Durant.   If he’s 6th or lower in media and fan vote he’s not going to be a starter. I love Luka as well but he’s not going to be a starter in the stacked west. "
"Nah man, you’re absolutely right. Take any good player in the league and give them his opportunity and they’d do the same. You know what, they’d probably even have better efficiency! For sure better defense! Any good player could shoulder the burden of playing the way he does and achieving the stats he does, which is why historically every team that’s had a superstar player always makes the playoffs, like how Anthony Davis carries the Pelicans or DeMarcus Cousins carries the Kings.   If you want to argue his stats, that’s fine. I’m glad you can look at stats that show he’s just had a Mamba-level streak, a .621TS, is carrying an absolutely battered team (where the number 2 usage guy is out) and still say he’s a good player. That’s what good players do right there.   I’m not dense for making fun of your argument, but I might be dense for trying to defend Harden here in this thread. If you truly believe that most of the top players could do this, I’d ask you to tell me which ones. Could Anthony Davis? Could Russel Westbrook, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis?  A couple could, sure. Giannis could, maybe AD (if you don’t count the years he’s been unable to) and prime LeBron absolutely could. Heck, Curry might be able to, KD too. Good job, maybe 5 guys in the league could.   Being unable to look past your stats into the details that lead into those stats doesn’t help your argument, it just shows me you’re not actually willing to look at this contextually. "
Kevin Durant read this thread &amp; get angry on Twitter pls 
"Glad to tell ya. There's 3 greater/better than Curry (since I have him on my Mount Rushmore) Larry Bird, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant received text after Lebron beat the Warriors: “Wow, I guess it makes a bit easier for him to come to GS now.”"
"Yeah, and also back then, Kevin Durant was named Harrison Barnes."
"I hope something happens like that Kevin Durant out of bounds call, I want to see this shit explode in their face."
"I mean he's having a really bad season by most if not all offensive metrics and this is on top of him not really excelling in them to begin with. He's still a defensive juggernaut though who has completely bought into finding the right shot and that's what Golden State needs the most when you have Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and klay Thompson."
"He has a case, but when you look at the other front court contenders in the west id say he has a relatively weak case. Lebron, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Lamarcus Aldridge are all higher than him for sure imo. Then there are some other ones that are also debatable"
"Fun fact: When Danny Green's anaconda got sick with a disease the vet couldn't diagnose properly, he took it to his local herpetologist. His name? Kevin Durant. "
No I really dont think Kevin Durant could do what Harden is doing right now. KD's career high is 54. Harden's high is 60. KD has gotten above 50 six times in his career. Harden has done it *13* times (in two fewer seasons). Harden is takes only 4 shots more than KD per game yet is scoring 7 points more than him every night. Literally every stat points to the fact that Harden is having an all time great offensive stretch on par with Kobe and MJ and yet you wanna sit on reddit being salty. Lol.
Ok so you think Kevin Durant is a better leader than dirk 
Yep. The help defenders would have too think twice about leaving there man if it was Kalyn Thompson or fucking Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant and Giannis are first team
I'm a nets fan and I agree that I can't see a Kevin Durant level star signing with us. I can see a second level guy like Butler or Tobias Harris though I wouldn't want Butler
"&gt;We don't have offensive impact data for Dantley, so we don't know how his teams did with him on the bench for on the court  we did see how his teams performed full years without him. Better. Utah own more games and had a better defense with the same offense. Detroit won back to back championships and had better records both years than the two where he played.   &gt;and I have been told by extremely knowledgeable posters that advanced box-score stats (PER, WS, BPM) clearly take precedence over actual impact stats (RAPM, On/Off, APM, etc).   Please tell me your source on someone calling PER better than RPM so I can ignore him.  &gt;How is PER garbage?  https://twitter.com/ElGee35/status/1082654447573045249  &gt;and we know that scoring efficiency is all-important  It's important, but not on a vacuum. Danny Green PER and TS% are nothing spectacular, yet he's one of the best players in his role in the league, and has allstar impact being a roleplayer.  &gt;Dantley is quite possible the most efficient high volume scorer in the history in history of basketball!  [What?](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/charles-barkley-of-the-philadelphia-76ers-battles-with-kevin-mchale-picture-id949299454) These two have something to say about that. [And this two guys too](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/4/590x/Steph-Curry-Kevin-Durant-954531.jpg)  &gt;It's crazy to say he didn't help an offense, and by a huge amount.   How is it crazy when there's 1000 examples of this? Phiadelphia was better the least Wilt shot, Toronto was better without DeRozan (and the SPurs are too!). Chicago had a better offense with Jordan taking less shots. Volume scorers have always been hugely overrated as far as impact goes.  &gt;Like I said, his rosters in Utah were quite awful offensively.  The ""awful offensive rosters"" were just as good without him, so that says enough for him. The ""good rosters"" in Detroit were better without him too on both ends."
The S if for Kevin Durant silly
"Just wanted to point this out, Kobe's best season from 16ft-3pt range is 42.9%  Paul Pierce's best season from that same range is 51.7% (only season above 50%)  Ray Allen's best season from that same range is 50.3% (only season above 50%)  LaMarcus at 44%  Kyrie at 54.9% last year (!!!), only season above 50% from that range  Kevin Durant at 55.8% (!!!), also only season for him above 50% from that range.  #Steph Curry has two fucking seasons above 60% (64% in 2011-2012 and 61.3% last year) from that range.   His numbers from 10-16 feet are very similar to Kevin Durant's (Steph has better numbers). Bballref doesn't have Jordan's data because shot distance only started being recorded while he was in Washington. Basically, you're wrong and you're talking out your ass by saying  &gt; He's never proven that he has any semblance of a midrange game  That's bullshit. Steph's shooting translates seamlessly to the midrange and you just don't want to admit it. The midrange shot is inefficient, Curry knows that, the league knows that, but if he has to put it up it's going in. He is by far the greatest OVERALL shooter in the history of the NBA, any player would agree.   "
Should he be? Yes. Will he be? Not playing with Kevin Durant.
"This is a common thing I see where people say that a current great player in their prime is a totally unstoppable offensive player, and say they are top 5.  They are ignoring though that the people that were watching during the eras of other all time greats were saying the same thing about those players.    How do you think people were reacting when 6""4' Charles Barkley  (an inch taller than Steph Curry) was scoring 25 PPG while shooting ~63% from 2 and getting double digits rebounds every year (including 4-6 offensive rebounds)?  How do you think people reacted to Kareem Abdul Jabbar shooting 50% on a midrange hook shot that was released ~8 feet in the air?  Or when Magic led the Lakers to the best offense year after year, despite his teammates consistently changing?  Or when Jerry West had the pull-up game of a Kevin Durant while being a strong defender, passer, and showing up in big games like no one ever has?    Those examples aren't even including the obvious examples of guys like Shaq, Lebron, Jordan, and Wilt.  I get that Curry is doing unprecedented things with 3 point shooting, but a lot of guys have done unprecedented things on offense.    "
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
"*looks at your flair*  man, so unfair how the Warriors have kept the Kings from a title...?  How would the Warriors not have fans? Oracle's been selling out since they were still trash after being pretty much trash for *over thirty years*. You think we're gonna back our team through six playoffs appearances since **the late seventies** and then look at them now and go, ""oh, no, this is just too good, it's unfair, I'm out""?  Get over it. Rest of the league needs to get good.  To put it in Civ terms? Kevin Durant was a cultural victory. Warriors built a team he looked at and wanted to join, and why wouldn't he? He'd played against them, and he'd been grinding out miserable games under a shitty coach and looking across the floor at the Warriors having just *so much more fun*.  Other than that, it's been a bunch of dudes that were either drafted by the Warriors, or unwanted by other teams. Suck it."
"You thought a team with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and DeMarcus Cousins would collapse?"
&gt;u/tropheez  &gt;Kevin Durant flair  How insecure are you in real life? 
They were officially unstoppable after Kevin Durant joined the team that won 70 games and a championship without him.
"Kevin Durant plays on the Warriors. He's one of the greatest scorers that has ever player... and he's just so boring to watch compared to Curry.  Curry has ruined basketball for me. There's just nothing else that even comes close to the excitement of Curry going supernova. I'm not even a Warriors fan, but I stay up way later than I should to watch them play whenever I can.  The guy score 20 points in 4.5 minutes in the third quarter. They were on the verge of getting blown out. Then 4 minutes later, they're winning and everyone in the arena is wondering WTF just happened?   I've never seen anything like it."
I can’t believe Steph Curry Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are better 3 point shooters than Austin rivers Gerald green and pj tucker 
No. But I also didn't think they'd get Kevin Durant or DeMarcus Cousins in the first place so I dunno.
"Man Kyrie had Kobe in his ear , lol Kobe is my favorite player but he’s the same guy that told Russell Westbrook he needs to have the ball more when he had KEVIN DURANT on his team."
Kevin Durant is also in the MVP race.
"Centers aren't a position, so his competition is Paul George, LeBron, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Jokic, Aldridge, KAT. That's not to mention in the guard position since he would have to be a wild card if he made it so add D Lill, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harden, DeRozan, Westbrook. I don't see him making the all star team"

"Let's be serious here. Kevin Durant needs to embrace being called a snake therefore he needs a snake type. Kobe was the Black Mamba, Stone Cold Steve Austin was the Rattlesnake. Kevin Durant can be the Diamondback, King Cobra, Copperhead, Milk snake, Cottonmouth, etc who cares what name it is he needs a snake type."
Kevin Durant brick assisted Curry.
"[2 years ago Jay Z pleaded with KD to at least sit down with the Nets, and he said no.](https://www.netsdaily.com/2016/7/1/12077128/despite-jay-zs-plea-kevin-durant-refused-to-meet-with-brooklyn-nets)  Have to imagine he's going to at least listen to what Brooklyn has to say this time around."
"I mean yeah dude if your injured players were in the game things would have been entirely different, that doesn't take away from anything that I've said. The game was winnable by the Rockets that were actually playing, and it was lost because of mistakes made by the Rockets that were actually playing. Responding to that by saying ""they wouldn't have been there if Player X, Y, and Z weren't injured"" has nothing to do with my point. The Hawks would win all their games if they had LeBron James and Kevin Durant but they're not in Atlanta so there's not really any point in bringing it up. See what I'm saying?"
[Sure he is](http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/omnisport/99/78/kevin-durant-63016-usnews-ftr_1vn2owry7ud31j185pcc24t39.jpg?t=-1590445563&amp;w=960&amp;quality=70)
"Every time Kyrie Irving hits a deep 3 in the clutch, Stephen Curry feels a tingle up his spine.  Then as Kevin Durant wraps around him, he whispers in his ear, “I got ussssss.”"
"Dawg, him doing that lets Kevin Durant play optimally. Thats why this all works so well. We can always put the ball in Currys hands, but this is how we optimize every players chances of getting an open shot. Klay and Curry rarely stop moving. Kd is not as mobile. This maximizes the offense potential while keeping KD involved.   Also the variety of looks they can give the defense is insane.   People that complain about Kerr are just frustrated because they want that fucking 2016 Curry high. It was like shooting heroin.. i get it. Just chill out and watch this team grind out another chip."
There has to be some solution though that doesn’t involve Kevin Durant being officially listed as 6’9’’. Maybe they take measurements when the season starts?
"Prime Kevin Durant is simply a better player, especially on the defensive end. Anyone who says different is just basing it off personality. "
Basketball doesn't work like that. A player can be better only in one skill and still be a better player.  And you're downplaying the gap in scoring. 10% TS is a humongous difference. That's the difference between Kevin Durant and Evan Fournier. That's the difference between an all time great top 15 guy and a guy who is a solid starter and at best 5th best guy on a contending team.
Could you imagine these two on the same team? With Kevin Durant too? 
"Highest scoring teammate among players with a 35% or higher usage rate:  16-17 Russell Westbrook (41.7%)- Victor Oladipo 15.9 PPG  05-06 Kobe Bryant (38.7%)- Lamar Odom 14.8 PPG  14-15 Russell Westbrook (38.4%)- Kevin Durant 25.4 PPG  86-87 Michael Jordan (38.3%)- Charles Oakley 14.5 PPG  01-02 Allen Iverson (37.8%)- Derrick Coleman 15.1 PPG  16-17 DeMarcus Cousins (55 games in SAC) (36.5%)- Darren Collison- 13.2 PPG  08-09 Dwyane Wade (36.2%)- Michael Beasley 13.9 PPG  17-18 James Harden (36.2%)- Chris Paul 18.6 PPG  00-01 Allen Iverson (35.9%)- Theo Ratliff 12.4 PPG  05-06 Allen Iverson (35.8%)- Chris Webber 20.2 PPG  11-12 Kobe Bryant (35.7%)- Andrew Bynum 18.7 PPG  12-13 Carmelo Anthony (35.6%)- J.R.

There was legit nobody else that was really an option (85 King, 01 Stackhouse, 02 Iverson)  3. There was a legit 2nd option that either did score a decent amount (06 AI, 82 Gervin), or could/would have if given the opportunity (17 Brody, 06/12 Kobe)"
"Because this isn't a full season far too small of a sample size. 40 games allow for too much variance for players, especially players on rookie contracts.  &amp;#x200B;  You're also comparing the likes of Collinson and Chris Paul to Lonzo Ball, which is simply unfair.  &amp;#x200B;  The way you're doing it almost as agregious as comparing Hakeem to Jordan or Shaq to Kevin Durant. Sure, go ahead, but it's not the same. The proper way to do comparisons is to figure out which properties are variable and make others as consistent/1:1 to each other as possible. That way you can focus on the difference of the isolated variables instead."
"I personally would. I think harden is a better playmaker overall. Harden has basically been unstoppable lately running pick and rolls with Danuel House, PJ Tucker, Gerald Green, and Austin Rivers spacing the floor for him. I’m trying to imagine how a defense stops him when 2 of those shooters are now Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant. "
"Lebron has gotten his teammates all-star and all-defense selections. His coaches have won COY. What awards has Durant gotten a coach?  &gt;That was a fluke year. Plain and simple. Just look at his shooting mechanics. That is not a 38% 3FG shooters form.  And 2014 was a fluke year for Kevin Love. But your bias won't let you hear that, so Kevin Durant made Draymond Green worse. He turned Draymond into a spot up shooter and now he sucks. Dray used to get the ball more and playmake, but now Durant being the bad teammate that he is argues with Green and curses at him to give him the ball. Now all of Draymond's stats are down, and he can't shoot because he has no rhythm. Thanks Kd."
"I don't hate Kevin Durant. I understand why you'd wanna go to a consistently winning environment. You wouldn't shit on an engineer for taking a job at Google or at Apple, would you?"
"Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Steve Nash, Shaquille O'Neal, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki, etc."
Big step up from last year.  ISO Possessions per game (2017-2018)  * James Harden: 9.6 * Chris Paul: 5.2 * Non-KD GSW: 3.6 * Kevin Durant: 3.3
"I saw Kevin in the title and was like ""who""? I'm too used to seeing it as Durant haha"
Kevin  Durant “ how can I make this night about myself”
"Apparently [Mybookie has the Thunder at 7/1 for Durant going there next year.](https://www.oddsshark.com/nba/odds-kevin-durant-leaving-golden-state-warriors)  At first I was shocked, but if Durant is committed to leaving than OKC actually makes a lot of sense.  The biggest issue is the only way to join them would be to opt into his player option and get traded (likely for Adams).  "
No Brandon Ingram can be Kevin Durant. Going from Ingram to PG is an obvious downgrade 
"I pretend that I just read   &gt; Kevin Durant is planning return to OKC   Jokes aside, really cool from him. I hope it won't be too awkward."

Following in the footsteps of buzzer avoider Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"""You miss 100% of the shots that you miss."" \~ Kevin Durant"
Is Steph Curry even the best player on his own team? Kevin Durant looks the part.
"That's a bad argument dude.  Kevin Durant is considered by most people to be the 2nd greatest player in the NBA generally speaking, and he's most definitely on almost everyone's top 5. He's also primarily a scorer, which is exactly the system that Kerr operates, and Kerr's worked with the guy for more than 2 whole years now.   When Curry is out, Kevin Durant just has to settle for... the 2nd best 3 point specialist in the league, Klay Thompson, who is also a really good defensive player. And to round that out, they also have an all-star and fantastic 6th man in Andre Iguodala.   And the rest of the roster has pretty much been handpicked by Warriors and Kerr. It's not like Curry having to deal with injuries is a shock to anyone - the dude has had to deal with injuries a lot throughout his career. So we have to assume that if Kerr is a good coach, he has contingencies for that within the rest of his squad.  Despite all this, Kerr was only able to round up a 19-14 record over the past 2 years in games that Curry has been out and KD has been in. Nothing to scoff at for sure, but not great. Compare that to KD in 2017 being out for a stretch of 18 games where Curry played, and the Warriors garnering a 15-3 record over that stretch. It's a major difference.   ----  My conclusions from this:  1. Draymond was totally right. The Warriors don't need Durant to win. He helps a lot for sure, but it's not needed at all. The Warriors system relies a lot on Steph and KD really just provides a peripheral (but seriously intense) offensive threat to that system.  2. Kerr is a good coach in that he designed an offensive system around Steph that is so intense that it led to 3 championships. He's also had some playoffs luck for sure, but everyone has playoff luck when they are talented. I would never call someone a bad coach when they manage to attain that level of success, especially in the face of Lebron James. You need a good coach to beat Lebron.   3. Kerr has been given a massive set of tools to use throughout the past 3 years but has not been able to capitalize nearly as well with the rest of his players as he has with Steph Curry. Yes, he manages to corral egos and get these stars to work together, but part of that comes from the players as well. Steph appears to be a humble guy, and Klay appears to be a major team player. But I would expect a great coach, let alone ""the best coach in the NBA right now,"" to be able to show dominance or at the very least unexpected excellence with whatever squad they were handed. I would argue that label falls more with someone like Doc Rivers and the Clippers, Malone with the Nuggets, and Bud with the Bucks. But definitely not Kerr."
"All I get from thi is that Kevin Durant is still more concerned about his own FG% than his team's success.  I read an interview with him where he admited thi before, that he didn't liek taking those shots because it hurt his FG% but that he 'moved past' that.   Apparently not. There was plenty of time to get a shot off any he didn't.  He should have. Even if it was a low percentage shot, 10% is higher than zero. "
**LUKA JEFFREY DONCIC** would make that shot 100 times out of 100! That **ABSOLUTE SCRUB** Kevin Durant doesn't even have the **BALLS** to even *attempt* that shot before the buzzer.
"&gt; i hear people complaining about them about money,   they should attribute that to the salary cap spike anomaly which allowed the warriors to acquire kevin durant. Golden State got really lucky with a lot of things, it's like a reverse perfect storm."
"It’s important to realize there’s a salary cap in the NBA with certain exceptions. So in order to maintain such a talented core and still attract premiere players, some players take a salary less than their market value would be. So it’s much better (in my opinion) than most of the top football clubs in that regard. They developed this team, and those players are making sacrifices in the form of a pay cut to keep making the team better. Everybody else hates them because 1) they’re so good, some hate is inevitable and 2) Kevin Durant, a unarguably top four player in the league, decided to join one of the best teams ever and destroyed any parity in the Nba.   Also in my opinion, instead of the club buying the best players/championships, the players in this situation are the ones that have bought the championships by taking those pay cuts. I’m not saying it’s good or bad."
"They drafted Steph Curry at 7, Klay Thompson at 11, and Draymond Green at 35 (in the second round). Five teams passed on Curry (Minnesota passed on him twice), and it's safe to say at least some of them have regrets.  Kevin Durant became a free agent in 2016. He's surprisingly shy for a superstar athlete, and he wanted to go to a team where he didn't have to be the ""Face of the Team"" guy. Golden State offered that, plus a very strong shot at winning championships, plus that season they had just been visibly having more straight-up fun than anyone else in the league.  That was 4.  Then last year, DeMarcus Cousins tore his Achilles tendon, a devastating injury in basketball (and most sports). He was a free agent in the off-season, and he did not get any offers he considered sufficient for his talents. (Some teams, reportedly, passed on him because it was a certainty that he would miss the first part of the season due to his injury.)  After no-one was beating down his door with offers and at least one team declined his services, he called Golden State, who eagerly agreed.  That's 5.  The thing about DeMarcus Cousins going to GSW is that, as much as some people complain and hate on him for it, it really was his best possible option. Not only does he get to play with other stars, on a winning team where he looks good and can shed some of the reputation baggage he has (completely unfairly and unjustifiably, in my opinion) accrued, the Warriors more than any other team could afford to give his rehab from injury as long as it needed.  He's playing better than even the most optimistic fans were hoping, I think.  No-one thinks DeMarcus Cousins is likely to stay at Golden State next season. They can't afford to pay him. There are widespread expectations that Kevin Durant might leave this offseason, too. This could be the peak for the Warriors. (29 teams sure as hell hope it is.)  But it's a combination of good drafting, good development, cultural victory, luck, and circumstances. "
"Players shot threes before Steph curry, you can’t credit Steph for every three made by an nba player. And yea, the warriors are only good because of Steph curry. Steph curry made draymond green a defensive menace, and taught Kevin Durant everything he knows😂😂😂"
"I think Kevin Durant has a chance. He might want to team up with Lebron just for the chance of getting to play with Lebron. I think he re-signs with the Warriors, but I think signing with the Lakers to play with Lebron is more likely than joining the Bulls/Knicks/Nets.  Kawhi Leonard could be faking everyone out and actually wants to go to the Lakers instead of the Clippers.  Kyrie Irving for a possible re-union.  Otherwise, Jimmy Butler if the Sixers try low balling him. He's a friend of the banana boat.  Kemba Walker can probably be talked into leaving Charlotte if he wants to win. If he wants the money, Jordan will probably give him all the money.  Don't see Klay leaving Golden State, and I'm pretty sure him and Lebron don't like each other anyhow.  After that you're down to Vucevic and Cousins, either of which they can probably sign.  If I had to guess, I woudl say they get either Butler or Kemba.   "
"Obviously the Warriors were smart for drafting Curry, Thompson, and Draymond, but you do realize that every team would sign KD and Cousins (for the minimum) if they could. It’s not like 29 teams passed on Kevin fucking Durant, and the Warriors were the only ones to see the potential. Also, who the fuck has ever criticized the Warriors for being too smart lmao."
Pretty sure he played with a guy named Kevin Durant as the first option.
1. LeBron James  2. Paul Pierce   3. Kevin Durant  4. Paul George   5. Tristian Thompson
This has only been true this season now that he's the only option. They double team him because it forces someone like Austin Rivers or Ennis to take the shot instead. Meanwhile teams will double team Steph to leave Klay or Kevin fucking Durant open.
"They drafted 3 of their 5. All developed really well. Steph Curry especially. 2 time MVP and best shooter in NBA history.  Kevin Durant signed in Free Agency two years ago.

Kevin Durant wasnt in his box
Kevin Durant has been utterly useless in the 4th this game. Hero ball and missing the shots. Throwing a pass out of bounds when his team has a 2 point lead with 30 seconds left. 
Kevin Blake Bortles Durant.
Kevin Durant overthrew that like Blake Bortles
KEVIN DURANT WHAT THE FUCK
This is why I deduCT 10 points from Durants shooting rating when I ball on xbox. I like my video games to be a true reflection  of player ability and devalue stat padders and rating hoarders.   I also add the pick dodger badge to Kevin Durant because he's so good at slithering around the court like a snek.
Kevin “James Harden” Durant

I wish I could be a fan of Kevin Durant
yeah that why he need kevin durant to join them just to beat lebron yu dumb fuk
kevin durant should be shot for robbing us of prime steph &gt;:CC
KD used to do this all the time at OKC and it used to annoy the crap out of me.  Also this reminded of this article from years back when KD actually admitted to it. https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html?y20=1 
Steph Curry and Kevin Durant feeling it.   No big deal.

**Starters**  * James Harden * Steph Curry * Kevin Durant * Lebron James * Paul George  **”Locks”**   * Anthony Davis * Nikola Jokic * Damian Lillard  You need to pick 4 of these guys to fill out the all star roster  * Rudy Gobert * Karl-Anthony Towns * Russell Westbrook * LaMarcus Aldridge * Mike Conley * Jrue Holiday * Luka Doncic * Danilo Gallinari * Tobias Harris * DeMar DeRozan * Donovan Mitchell * Jamal Murray * Klay Thompson  I think LMA will get in but a lot of competition.

Kevin Durant - Lakers   Kawhi Leonard - Lakers   Kyrie Irving - Lakers   Jimmy Butler - Lakers   Klay Thomson - Lakers   Kemba Walker - Lakers   DeMarcus Cousins - Lakers   Tobais Harris - Lakers   Nikola Vucivic - he stay 
"Kevin Durant -- he go (Brooklyn to be different... but probably not there)  Kawhi Leonard -- he go (Clippers)  Kyrie Irving -- he go (NYK is kinda interesting I guess)  Jimmy Butler -- he go (NYK? Do they have cap for two?)  Klay Thomson -- he stay (Warriors)  Kemba Walker -- he stay (Hornets)  DeMarcus Cousins -- he go (Lakers)  Tobais Harris -- he stay (Clippers)  Nikola Vucivic -- he trade, then he go (Idk where tho)"

Utah looks like the better fit and they need his extra scoring &gt; &gt;Vucivic will probably go Dallas. He's high IQ and a do it all center. &gt; &gt;Cousins will go to LA if he plays well this season. LA will he desperate for another star. &gt; &gt;Kyrie is going to NY. I'll get shitted on for saying this but idc. He's going for non basketball reasons. He always wanted to play for the Knicks and he's very close to his dad and sister who live in NJ &gt; &gt;I don't know where KD and Butler are going. I'm not gonna attempt to try to figure it out  He go  He go  He stay  He stay  He stay  He go  He go  He stay  He go  Also, on behalf of the Lakers fanbase, we're not interested in DeMarcus Cousins until he looks like his old self again lmao"
Half of all r/NBA accounts are actually Mike zarren meme accounts.  You either die a Mike Zarren account or you live long enough to become a Kevin Durant burner 
Maybe if you had Kevin Durant you could. Or James Harden. 
"LeBron James, Steph Curry, James Harden, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard all certainly deserve it over him. Russell Westbrook, Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, Tobias Harris, and Karl Towns all have legitimate arguments over him as well.  Like it or not, team record does matter for being selected to the all star game."
"""The Doore Ant""   Durant...  Kevin Durant"
To be fair things aren't easy to predict. There are so many things we don't know behind the scenes. Who knew someday GSW would have the all time regular season led by an injury prone shooter? Then Kevin Durant would join that team and now LeBron is on the Lakers. Plus its an unpopular opiniom thread so there is a lot of bad takes.
"&gt;The NBA needs a hard salary cap. I don't really care if players like LeBron get underpaid based on market value, but talk to anyone that doesn't like the NBA and the #1 reason is because of there is no parity in this league. Realistically there are only ever 2-4 title contenders each year. Also, the Lakers being able to get away with paying 4 future HOFers and a solid starter is disgraceful.  Well well well.....  &gt;OKC traded away their best player. In a few years time it won't be Westbrook vs Harden debate, it would be a Harden vs Durant debate.  Interesting.  &gt;Kevin Durant's efficiency would be *much* worse without Westbrook. Westbrook basically makes KD as good as he is.  KD won MVP the next year...  &gt;James Harden is very overrated and is a glorified jump shooter. Yes he does draw lots of fouls, but he goes into the lane looking for a foul rather than trying to score a basket. This has always been something frustrating for me, players looking to get fouls rather than score, thats not basketball!  Some things never change  &gt;KD will never win a championship with Westbrook as his PG.  Indeed  &amp;#x200B;"

"Who would get the free throws? Due to law of equivalent exchange, Kevin Durant was in bounds "
"Kevin Durant. The amount of ways he can score is insane and his game just looks effortless, it was so much fun to watch him in OKC and is still kinda fun to watch him now on GSW"
Thinks he's Kevin Durant with that shot.
"Advanced stats point to Kyrie being a top 8 player. Eye test tells you Kyrie is one of the most talented scores of all time (Kevin Durant even put him in the same class as Jordan and Kobe). Advanced stats say Westbrook has fallen off a cliff. Eye test says he’s an overrated chucker who stat pads.   Take Westbrook. I’m happy you have him, and that my team has Kyrie Irving entering his prime :)"
I like Kevin durant. Kevin durant is best player in league
What the hell do you want me to call them? Questions? Observations? How ever much a pussy kevin Durant is youll never be half the man he is and that's facts 
Westbrook is easily one of the top point guards in the league right now. But he needs to accept that he should not be the first option on offense. He used to average more shots than *Kevin freaking Durant*. Even Curry knows better and lets Durant take on the bulk of the offense most games. Now Russ has another superstar on his team in PG13 and still insists on taking 20-30 shots a game.
"Fuck Off. What have you done? Look at your self seriously and critically. And while your looking shave your fucking neck beard then try to shave off a few pounds. Then ask your self again, what have you done? I hate kevin Durant as much as the next r/nba 10 year old but he's doing something necessary and good. "
"I’ll try. (These aren’t in order)  Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic....alright forget it. Yeah he’s top 10 "
Kevin Durant
"Is it a stretch to say a player will be more tired after 34 than 32 minutes? Absolutely not. Fatigue matters and it's a huge deal. That 2 minutes of rest Durant gets to start 4th quarters in the finals is the reason he can close them out and not have his shooting go to shit like it did with OKC when he had to play the whole quarter. The same for Harden. The same for Kobe. The same for MJ. The same for Lebron.  I wish I saved that post showing the entire league shoots better in the 1st quarter than the 2nd quarter, better in the 2nd quarter than the 3rd quarter, better in the 3rd quarter than the 4th quarter. There is a direct correlation here scoring later in games is extremely difficult to do.  Games 3 and 4 of the 2017 Finals are the perfect examples regarding Kyrie. Kyrie Irving and Lebron James played the entire 2nd half of Game 3 battling the Warriors. James and Irving both shot 2/3 to start the 4th quarter and James made both of his free throws (Fatigue affects free throw shooting too) for 7 total points in the 4th and Irving made his only free throw for 5 points in the 4th. James last points came at the 4:28 mark, Irving's last points at the 5:29 mark.  Neither were able to make a shot after that point. Both finished the game shooting 0-3 and including both players missing a layup from 1 feet. Kevin Durant, on the other hand, entered the 4th quarter with 9:30 to go. And we all know how he was able to make his shots and close that game.  In Game 4, the Cavs adjusted. James played the whole 2nd half while Irving was benched for the last 2 minutes of the 3rd. Just that two minute break allowed him to close the game, and the Cavs were able to win. Here is Kyrie Irving himself mentioning how that 2 minute rest allowed him to finish the game strong: https://youtu.be/BpCOD_ERsJo?t=449  Moreover, do you remember [this clutch turnover on Durant caused by Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHwzCD5RRg) in Game 5 2016? Well Curry had been resting to start the 4th and came in full of energy and made a huge impact on the ending of this game, while Durant faded off with fatigue after playing the whole 4th quarter."
"2018 Game 6 vs the Rockets down 3-2.  Kevin Durant: 23 points, 6-17 35% FG, missed free throws for the first time all playoffs (4 of them)."
"2018 Game 6 vs the Rockets down 3-2.  Kevin Durant: 23 points, 6-17 35% FG, missed free throws for the first time all playoffs (4 of them)."

"I also love the ""No fucking doubt"" quote from Kevin Durant when asked if he respected Jrue's defense."
Kevin Durant never missed a shot in the 2018 finals 
"That’s like saying Kevin Durant, kawhi leanord and giannas aren’t better than luka... just older "
"Or even all the playoff teams that keep signing different wing defenders every year just for lebron like teams used to do in preparation for Shaq. Demare Carroll (Raptors), PJ Tucker (Raptors), Ron Artest (Lakers), Tony Allen (Celtics), Kevin Durant (Warriors), Marcus Morris (Boston), Markieff Morris (Detroit, then Washington).  Wouldn't surprise me at all if the Raptors drafted OG and Siakam for Lebron and the Spurs drafted Kawhi for Lebron.  "
"I question why he is employed as an NBA coach tbh  Dude was garbage on OKC with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, who the hell thinks he's going to be able to better with *literally any team at all*?"
"The only possible reason why someone could think Paul George isn't a top-ten player.  Ten players better than Paul George (in no particular order):  LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid.  There's ten right there."
"“If you can gain your chances to a ring, while everybody else is losing theirs and blame on you, you straight homie''. - Kevin “Big Smoke” Durant "
"Because it basically sounds like people complaining because they're pissed the Warriors aren't a joke any more.  The Shaq/Kobe Lakers and the Jordan Bulls and the fucking Bill Russell Celtics are celebrated legends of the game and yet if it's the *Warriors*, well, THAT'S a problem and everybody hates it.  You'd all be fucking thrilled if your teams were this good and most fanbases would be shittier about it than ours, because *most* fanbases don't have ""sure, but we sucked for almost forty years, so..."" holding them back.  The bandwagoners would be there no matter which team this was, but Warriors fans who were around before are just trying to be happy our team is great for once.  If OKC's front office wasn't piss fucking poor Kevin Durant wouldn't have left. If the NBAPA leadership didn't get greedy the cap spike wouldn't have happened and *all the players who aren't superstars and weren't 2016 free agents would be better off*. Washington might have had a shot at KD if they didn't hire his trash ex-coach and if their locker-room weren't an obvious pit of misery and bitchiness.  Other teams really just need to stop whining and *fucking get good*."

"Everyone says that we're not a destination but what franchise actually is one besides the Lakers and Miami? Free agency is total crap shoot and it's not like we've never signed an all star before (Carlos Boozer in his prime).   Y'all got Al Horford only after Kevin Durant spurned OKC and Gordon Hayward came for Brad Stevens not because Boston's special. Before Horford who was the biggest free agent to come to the Celtics?  Before Durant, the biggest free agent to Golden State was David Lee. At one time Orlando signed prime Tracy Macgrady and Grant Hill but I don't see anyone calling them a destination. Atlanta got prime Joe Johnson from Phoenix and Phoenix scooped up Nash. The Knicks snagged Carmelo but Denver made a great signing with Milsap.   Free agency is total crapshoot and it's dumb to assume that no quality players will go to small market/low profile teams. "
"Yeah, it was pretty predictable. Just look at the [fan voting](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25786429/latest-nba-all-star-game-voting-kevin-durant-james-harden-out) and remove the players that didn't truly deserve it and were boosted by fan sentiments, because they would be pulled down by the media and player rankings. Those players were Doncic, Rose, and Wade.  That said, I think it's kind of boring to simply go by merit. It's an exhibition game for fan entertainment, not some serious competition (the players certainly don't take it seriously). Why not let fans vote in certain players based on sentiment?  (And for those players who have contract incentives tied to ASG, that's just dumb. Make those incentives tied to something serious, not an exhibition. Would you tie incentives to preseason games? Then why ASG? They should only have incentives based on serious polls like All-NBA teams).  My solution for this is that any players that were in the Fans starting lineup that were eliminated due to Media / Players votes, should be automatically put as All Star Reserves. And then coaches pick the remaining spots. That way, the Starters will be the most deserving. But you still get fan sentimental players as reserves."
"Even the commentators are like that. It’s insane. I remember during Boogie’s first game they were talking about “what Kevin Durant is going to do this offseason after he gets his third ring” like it was a foregone conclusion, which it pretty much is."
"Really? I don’t remember, probably because I don’t remember losers. Was it the time when he was on the same team as Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant and  failed miserably in the playoffs, I vaguely remember something like that."
Im using that next time. Fucking Kanter is a Stan to Kevin Durant. I've never seen anyone more saltier than him.
"This.  Who has a strong desire to watch a product where we all know who is going to win the championship before the season starts.  Blame has to go on to the players union leadership (Michele Roberts, Chris Paul) for not agreeing to smooth the cap increase and thus allow the Warriors to sign Kevin Durant.  The players were still going to get their money in the end with the cap smoothing.  Now we have a super team who wins every year and it's a boring league to watch due to the competitive imbalance. "

"Better for the Pelicans? Requesting a trade seems like a win/win. Player gets let go, and team gets something in return. Quietly leaving for nothing (Kevin Durant) is infinitely worse than requesting a trade and letting the franchise get a return (Paul George, Kawhi, AD, ...)"
He Is ThE NeXt KeViN DuRaNt
Miami was pretty desperate to add Bosh to Wade and LeBron. The Cavs were pretty desperate to add Love to Kyrie and LeBron. The 73-win GSW were pretty desperate to add Kevin Durant.   The chance to get a top 7 player in his prime does not come along often. 
Kevin Durant did if fairly through free agency. It was a bitch move to okc but there was colluding/tampering. 
Maybe Kevin Durant Height not skill
"Does this sound right?  Say, LeBron picks first:  1. LeBron - Anthony Davis 2. Giannis - Stephen Curry 3. LeBron - Kyrie Irving 4. Giannis - Kevin Durant"
"I find it hilarious that you say that Harden “gambles” on steals. When in actuality he’s extremely precise and calculated with his defensive positioning. It’s not a result of luck that his steals numbers are so elite. His timing and fantastic reads are what gets him his numbers. Just because you can see this doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.   Everyone that has led the league in steals are solid defenders. Harden is not an exception or an anomaly. It’s amazing you don’t see the connection.   To put Harden’s other defensive numbers into perspective, he currently has a similar defensive plus-minus (+0.7) as Kawhi Leonard, (+0.8) and better marks than Jimmy Butler, (+0.5), Kevin Durant (+0.2), and Klay Thompson (-2.2), to name a few. In fact, he’s third on the entire Rockets squad in that statistic, behind just Clint Capela and P.J. Tucker (Both of whom are top defenders)  You might not like Harden or his playing style but don’t be a loser that try’s to diminish his impact on the game. "
Better than now:  \- Mike Conley  \- Marc Gasol  \- Draymond Green  \- Blake Griffin  \- Kawhi Leonard  \- Kevin Durant  \- Kevin Love  \- Rudy Gay  \- LeMarcus Aldridge  &amp;#x200B;  Can't think of worse tbqh
I feel like 7 footers should go for the Kevin Durant body type if they want to play a long time.

"Unless that other player is Kevin Durant, that player isn't going to be as good as KD."
"[I think Wob tweeted it best](https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1090469693981450241):  ""Every Brandon Ingram possession is either Future China League MVP or Next Kevin Durant, there's no in-between."""

"Kevin Durant. KD. 🐍   There, maybe now he can find this nice little tip "
"Kevin ""Tom Brady"" Durant."
Everyone was getting upset during that one Warriors game because highlights were being posted like “Kevin Durant pulls up for 2” and it was literally just KD pulling up from the elbow like he does 5 times a game. 
"I don't get why everyone is so low on a 6'3, 21 year old PG who's already established himself as one of the most athletic players in the league and is pretty skilled in most aspects of the game. Not saying he'll be Westbrook or Derrick Rose but he certainly has a future in this league as an All-Star level PG. NY shouldn't give up on him like Dallas did.  As for the Knicks, the only way this trade works out for them is if they land at least two of Durant, Kyrie or Zion this summer. Knicks management placed a lot of faith in themselves to make this happen, which isn't necessarily a good sign since faith has failed a lot of Knicks FOs over the past 30 years. My prediction is Durant picks up his option and waits a year to see how things pan out, Kyrie gets sold on Boston (again) and the Knicks get fucked at the lottery, as karma for rigging the Ewing sweepstakes. If this happens, I think we're looking at a DSJ-Jimmy Butler-Kevin Knox-Tobias Harris-DeAndre Jordan starting lineup next year. They'll probably be good enough to nab the 5th seed after trading JB for Winslow and Richardson 20 games in. "
Kevin Durant you suck
"I'd be embarrassed if I needed Kevin Durant to win a ring. Before you bring up 2015, Cavs had no Kyrie or Love. Mozgov was their 2nd best player. What an accomplishment that year was! And Steph was still trash "

FUCK KEVIN DURANT...upvote for visibility

Do you guys think Brandon Ingram is stronger than Kevin Durant?
"Because they took a 73-9 team, and replaced Barnes, bogut, barbosa, speights, and ezeli with Kevin fucking durant, David west, and acceptable young bench players?? What the fuck kinda stupid question is that?"
And why would Kevin Durant do that?
We traded Kristaps to free up cap space to sign Kevin Durant and another superstar. 
"Any hated player who shows up and engages will at least earn credit for ""facing the criticism head on"" or something like that. Extra points if they lean into any joke about themselves.  Like if Kevin Durant did an AMA on here and said his greatest accomplishment was getting a degree in parseltongue and announced that next year he was going to sign with the winner of the 2019 MarbleLympics, most of us would laugh with him and think maybe he's not so bad."
Oh you think Kevin Durant isn't on Reddit? Or isnt a mod at r/warriors 🙄
Hi Kevin Durant. We only dont like you because you're on the Warriors. please go somewhere else this summer . it'll help your legacy and we'll all like you again!
He was basically the shooting guard version of Kevin Durant in his prime.
Is Kevin Durant fucking grateful for his ex?
People don’t realize how good Blake was at Oklahoma. Also I’d still take Kevin Durant too. He was more of a transcendent talent that transfers over to NBA with size and length. Zion could be Barkley but he could also be Jason Maxiell
"why is everyone so hyped about AD? dudes more like Kevin Love (Minnesota days) than Kevin Durant Giannis would have them as a contender with that roster hate away, it's the truth #notawinner"
"Hold your horses man, he's an amazing player but since LeBron you had Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, etc "
"Paging Kevin Durant, a Mr. Dolan is on the line."
The Warriors got lucky when the salary cap went up the year Durant was a free agent. Nothing less nothing more. They beat a Cavaliers team that didnt have Kevin Love or Kyrie. Lets be real man lol. Sometimes you need a bit of luck.
"1.  Even after signing Jimmy to a max (which is no guarantee), combining that with Markelle's 8 or so that leaves the Sixers with 22+ million open for next year.  Unless Kevin Durant is coming to town, the Sixers don't need to clear 8 more mil in space necessarily.   2.  If Durant or like 4 mid level guys (mediocre overpayed role players that want to make 7-10 million a year like the Ilyasovas or Shaun Livingston;s of the world of the world) all decide they want to sign (this is a franchise that is not a free agent destination, the best FA signing ever was one year of JJ Redick and then possibly George Lynch), the Sixers can dump him then probably far easier then right now before the trade deadline (teams can see him work out and perhaps make a jump shot, unlike now).     3.  Markelle should have the surgery 100% "

Didn't Kevin Durant say he did not want to play with Lebron since he would have to change his game too much?

"I don't think it makes sense for the Bulls to trade for him actually.  It'd be like trading for Lebron James or Kevin Durant. Sure it makes the team better, but as currently constructed, it does not have enough to get to the Finals or to continue making moves to re-construct the roster around AD to make the Finals in the next two years."
"&gt; Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, there's plenty of garbage top picks.  Yeah but Victor Oladipo is an All-Star, and Kevin Durant is an all time great scorer. So in both those drafts, the 2nd pick ended up being good at least. Fultz and Ball are both somehow bad.  "
"I'd tell them that if they wait until the offseason, we will draft who they want wherever we end up, then trade that player along with Dennis Smith Jr, Kevin Knox, Lance Thomas and the two Dallas picks for Anthony Davis.   Allowing us to secure both Durant &amp; Kyrie on the promise of AD BEFORE trading for AD.    "
kevin durant
"My bad I didn't know he was referring to that 2nd team. But on the other hand, this is cherry picking one of his best post season performances ever and the incredibly overlooked horrible defense by Kevin Durant on LeBron that contributed to that 51 points. "
Bruno Caboclo = next Kevin Durant
That's a good percentage though. Kevin Durant for example shoots 42% outside of 3 feet for his career.
Idk man I think y'all could've won at least one or two without Klay. You have Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant lol
Did anyone actually confirm if its really Kevin Durant? All youd have to do to fake this is change your first name to Kevin Durant and then it would show up just like that right?
"He settles for high difficulty iso plays more often than he needs to. Sometimes it's necessary for him to take over games but it comes at the expense of team offense. He's playing next to 2 of the greatest shooters of all time and a 2 time mvp, but he'll often hold the ball deep into the shot clock and take some heavily contested shots because he's 7ft tall and his name is Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is black tho

"Imagine Lebron joined the spurs team that swept him , Kevin Durant Joined a team that his okc team blew a  3-1 lead in wcf to.  imo his 2 final MVPs mean jack shit cause I saw Kevin Durant in the big games lose."

"It’s in the background of a lot of conversations you have with Warriors figures these days, right after all the talk about how DeMarcus Cousins is fitting in, how well Draymond Green is playing, a few moderately notable pending free-agent decisions and the maintenance of this historic team heading into the attempt at a three-peat this June.  Eventually, when the tape recorders are off and chatting is a little looser, it almost always winds around to this fundamental question (well, after the Kevin Durant Question, of course):  What’s Joe going to do?  The question isn’t about this season and this moment, of course. Everybody in and around the Warriors knows that owner Joe Lacob (and the rest of the organization) is dead set on winning immediately and winning as much as possible, which means focusing everything on getting this roster to peak for the upcoming playoffs.  That part is settled Warriors fact. They’re not doing anything to mess around with their best chance to win their third NBA championship in a row and fourth in five years and if anything they’ll try to add around the margins by adding a veteran center or a wing in the buyout market just for postseason flexibility.  The curiosity, though, is about the longer-term view — with the move to San Francisco’s Chase Center coming up next season, Durant and Klay Thompson both set to become very, very, very highly sought-after free agents, the core group moving toward NBA middle age and a whole slew of opponents clearly not only set up to try to challenge the Warriors for league supremacy but also to try to pluck Durant and/or Thompson and then maybe Green, too, when he’s scheduled to hit free agency in July 2020.  The Warriors have put together one of the greatest rosters ever. But keeping it together for another three or four years would potentially cost Lacob and his ownership group upward of $300 million a year in salary and luxury-tax costs … while most of the main players age past their primes.  And the Warriors don’t even know if Durant or (less questionably) Thompson will re-sign with this team in July or the long or short term.  Well, actually, the Warriors know Durant is at least thinking about leaving or else he would’ve signed a much longer deal last July, when he wouldn’t take anything but one year plus an option. It’s possible, maybe probable, depending on the moment and the latest report, that Durant is enticed by the idea of moving to the New York Knicks, who just opened up a massive amount of cap space last week.  So, with this unsettled dynamic, is Lacob thinking that this is a last stand and ready to redo a huge chunk of his roster over the next few summers and break up the core to try to land a younger superstar … or is this notably antsy owner relatively content to ride this out for as long as possible with the stars he has?  All important questions. Which I asked him a few days ago after a recent game. The main theme of Lacob’s answers: There are no plans to tear the roster apart and if it costs huge dollars to keep this group together, the Warriors are very capable and willing to pay that cost.  “We can do whatever we want (financially),” Lacob said. “And you should expect that that’s not going to be a reason this team … doesn’t stay great going forward. We have the capital to pay our players what they deserve. And we will.  “That’s not really the issue. The issue is more about people have to want to play here and it’s on us to make it a great environment.”  This is a slight change in tone from Lacob from recent years. In past moments, Lacob has always said he wants to keep all his best players, but he’s cautioned that there might not be unlimited resources to do so, that ownership at some point has to make some fiscal decisions.  That isn’t what he’s saying now and I think it’s a product of several factors:  1) Chase Center was always set to provide the Warriors with an unprecedented influx of cash and that money is now a tangible part of how Lacob and Peter Guber can operate;  2) The Warriors, almost inescapably capped out for years to come and without valuable young trade pieces, don’t quite have the capability of adding a major new star even if Durant leaves, so Lacob is determined to play the Durant negotiations out until the end;  3) If Durant leaves, the Warriors’ winning culture probably will put them back at the top of the line to chase another available superstar in a few years; and  4) The main long-range focus is to maintain the core of Stephen Curry, Green and Thompson, which means a full commitment to paying Thompson (probably the max) and Green (something close to the max) when they are due to land new deals.  If the Warriors offer Thompson his maximum allowable contract in July, he’ll almost certainly re-sign, even with his hometown Lakers eager to bring him in. And I expect that the Warriors will offer the max to Klay.  And Marcus Thompson reported that Green was offered and turned down a three-year extension (which would start with the 2020-21 season) worth $72 million last summer, but those talks could easily restart this July.  So all around the Warriors, teams are positioning themselves to win in a potential post-Warriors universe: The Knicks trying to set up for Durant and possibly Kyrie Irving and a top draft pick; the Lakers chasing Anthony Davis; the Clippers and Denver have lots of young talent; Dallas now has Kristaps Porzingis to team with star rookie Luka Doncic.  “Of course, that’s the role we’re in right now,” Lacob said. “Twenty-nine teams are all trying to get better. That’s what they’re supposed to do. Our job is to do that, too, to continually get better and I think we’ve gotten better pretty much every year. This is probably our best roster ever. So we’re going to continue to do that.”  Are the Warriors concentrating on those looming challenges beyond this season — specifically the teams that seem to be targeting Durant and Thompson?  “I mean, theoretically yes, but I’m not really worried about it,” Lacob said. “All we can do is be the best organization we can, treat players the best we can, provide the best environment, have the best management, have a great arena. I mean, all the things we do. The culture of the organization, I think, speaks for itself. Then the chips fall where they may.  “I think we’ll continue to have a good team if not a great team and try to hopefully be a title-contending team for as long as we can. We’ll be aggressive. Nobody’s going to outspend us. Nobody’s going to outwork us.  “I can’t control what a free agent might do. Logically, I know what they should do, which is stay with us, but I can’t say what they’re going to do, so they’ll do what they’re going to do. And we’ll have contingency plans; if somebody leaves, we’ll do what we’ve gotta do.”  There have been summers when the Warriors clearly were happy with their roster and wanted to do everything possible to keep everything together — in 2015, after their first title of this era, and in 2017, after their first season with Durant when they first and foremost wanted to and did re-sign veterans Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.  And there have been summers when the Warriors knew they were likely to do a lot of shuffling— in 2016, to clear the way for Durant, and last summer, to try to get younger in the last five or six spots of their roster.  This July seems likely to find the Warriors straddling the two modes: They’ll try to keep everybody together, but if they lose somebody, they’ll have to get imaginative or lucky or both. But in order to have any shot at keeping Durant, they have to put all their chips in on him … until he makes a decision.  Which freezes the Warriors’ financial and personnel plans this July. They’re OK with that; though they would’ve loved to get on Anthony Davis’ short list, the dynamics of that situation seem to put him out of their reach right now.  Down the road, in two or three years … that’s when the Warriors can try to get seriously aggressive again, when it’s possible great young players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Porzingis and Karl-Anthony Towns could be available.  Until then …  “The best thing for us to do is keep our great players together as long as we can, as long as we should, and then develop on the margins players in (G League) Santa Cruz that can help and be smart about the guys we do sign to add to the roster,” Lacob said. “And maybe we’ll get lucky and get a DeMarcus Cousins again next year, somebody who wants to come here for less. We’re open to doing that and keeping the roster moving forward. …  “I do think we have to continue to reinvigorate the team and the roster with youth. You saw — we’re trying this year; we’re trying very hard to develop our young players and to hopefully bring them into the mix and play them more and to try to stay somewhat young as we go forward.  “But nobody’s really old on this team. They’re kind of right in the middle of their careers. So I don’t think it’s something that we worry about every day. … Let’s see how the season winds up. All I can say right now is I think we love our roster with all our players, the coaching staff. I think we’re in a really good spot. I can only say, we’ll evaluate at the end of the season and sort of see if anything’s changed from where we are today. Right now, it looks pretty good.”  So that’s what Joe Lacob’s thinking, or at least what he told me. For now, the Warriors are at the peak of a dynasty and they’re not going to mess around with that this season and probably into the next one, too."
Man anyone who likes the warriors should thank Kevin Durant for these 2 (3) rings if he leaves.   There should be no bad blood bereeen them.   Yeah there’s petty drama and whatnot but this is the most “first world problems” I’ve ever seen. There’s 4-5-6 fucking all stars on that team of course you going to get some weird / funny headlines between them.   When they get on the court all that shit goes away.   Kd might be hated by most of America but the Bay Area better always respect him. 
"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/kevin-durant-rejected-meeting-knicks-free-agency-article-1.2912206  The Knicks still tried to set up a meeting and he rejected the offer. Sorry, my dude. "
"it would be pretty favored for USA.   **USA:**  * PG: Steph Curry * SG: James Harden * SF: LeBron James * PF: Kevin Durant * C: Anthony Davis * 6: Paul George * 7: Kawhi Leonard * 8: Kemba Walker * 9: Kyrie Irving * 10: Damian Lillard * 11: Russell Westbrook * 12: Bradley Beal  &amp;#x200B;  **World:**  * PG: Ben Simmons * SG: Luka Dončić * SF: Giannis * PF: Nikola Jokic * C:  Joel Embiid * 6: Rudy Gobert * 7: Steven Adams * 8: Danilo Gallinari * 9: Nikola Vucevic * 10: Pascal Siakam * 11: Domas Sabonis * 12: Deandre Ayton  Honorable Mention: Dragic, Markkanen, Marc Gasol, Capela, Porzingis, Bogdonovic  &amp;#x200B;  I think it's closer than some think, but the USA team wins 130-115 IMO  &amp;#x200B;"

It clearly says he isn't. But you know who also ISN't Frank Ocean. Kevin Durant. 
Kevin Durant telling anyone to “grow up” is absolutely comical though. Mr Burner Account and Instagram arguments with 13 year olds. He’s the most immature superstar ever 
if kevin durant randomly responds to fan DMs he probably reads everything the media puts out about him which explains why he's so upset
Spoiler: Steph Curry and Kevin Durant were two of the first players picked. 
"I saw Kevin Durant at a grocery store in Oakland yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him hiss as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and hesi jimbo'd me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yelling ""IM DONE"" really loudly.  "
As if the sports media is the hand that feeds Kevin Durant... that may be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard a basketball pundit say.
Kevin Durant is like if your angst-ridden AIM away message was a really good basketball player.
"Well barring some bullshit from a dirty creighton player we would have been in the game against Kentucky, but either way that’s  standard you hold a team to, not a player. Or were Ben Simmons and Kevin Durant overrated and shitty in college too?"
"&gt; Kevin Durant made some of his strongest comments yet about his future free agency, going as far to say he wants to have his jersey retired in Oklahoma City.  ""I love it here, man. I love my teammates, I love the city, I don't really think about anywhere else,"" Durant told Revolt TV in a recent interview. ""I hear it all the time, don't get me wrong, and once you hear it you're kind of like [looks up, thinking]. But for me, I love staying in the moment, and I'm one of those guys that would love to stick it out with one team my whole career.  So, maybe don’t take anything he says seriously. "
"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook  Pick 3 guys that AD is better than. "
Kevin Durant is bastard man!
"so Kevin Durant thinks that he gets to just sign one year deals with the Warriors so he can have more power in that relationship, and at the same time get away with being mad about reporters asking questions and speculating about where he'll go next?  yeah makes total sense."
"Okay so if Kevin Durant isn’t contractually obligated to talk to media after practice, then who’s fault would it be when it does? I mean wouldn’t that be his *choice*"
Kevin Durant is so full of shit. 
I have no sympathy for Kevin Durant lol
"Yeah except AD did it by himself. Same as Lebron. Kevin Durant did it with 2 other MVP's and still couldn't pull it off and had to jump on the bandwagon winningest team of all time, back to back champions with FIVE ALL STARS to pull it off. "
"Tell that to Pete Rose, Lance Armstrong, and Shoeless Joe Jackson. You don't respect sport you lose the respect of the sport. Kevin Durant placed winning above fair play and he's not much better than those others in my book. "
"All I think of Kevin Durant is that he's not a rational or particularly moral person who doesn't respect competition, sportasmanship of player. But he's really really good at basketball while doing it. F U KD you really fucking good basketball player you. "
"Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant"
"OMG! The poor Multi-Millionaire! How awful! Poor KD. He gets picked on by the media &amp; fans. It's just awful. That must be so hard for him. /s  Fuck Kevin Durant! He gets paid MILLIONS OF DOLLARS each year. I'm about to go shovel 12 inches of snow, in freezing temperatures, before I can even leave for work. He can fucking deal with it. I'm tired of these guys constantly bitching, like punk ass little bitches. If he doesn't like it, he can return all those checks &amp; retire.  What a punk ass fucking bitch KD has turned out to be."
Kyrie-Kobe-Lebron-Kevin Durant-Anthony Davis
"Durant is a talented player, by all means, and right now he's a hot commodity. Any organization would love to have him. He's not hated.   LeBron was absolutely hated when he made his decision. He left his city behind... a personal choice and it didn't go over well.  LeBron didn't want to be burdened with carrying a team. Shit, he was carrying Cleveland since birth.  The 2010 decision opened the door for young superstars to do with their career as they see fit. KD followed the LeBron method, maybe not to a tee, but he surely did.  By the time KD went to Golden State, the league  had already shifted and the development of superteams was already in place... which has lead to an influx of players publicly demanding they want off teams, contracts, trades, etc.  Kevin Durant and LeBron James are not hated. It's deeply rooted disappointment. Fans don't always get what they want. "
"I read the article he wrote in KD. Titled ""silent star: on the presumed warriors exit of Kevin Durant"".  I understood why KD was so pissed from that title alone."
Personally if the Walmart Kevin Durant blows out his knee we wouldnt know
Kevin Durant. No argument there.  Bitch made...
The score was warriors win by 39.  Media:Kevin is there a specifically reason why y'all won by 39? Why not score 1 more to win by 40? what does winning by 39 MEAN?  Media next day: according to sources close to Kevin Durant he intends to sign a 5 year contract with the New York Knicks at $39 million per year.
Kevin “the hardest road” Durant  Leaving a championship caliber team to join a historically great team that just knocked of your team in 7 games will always be a weak move.
"I don't give two shits about that Ethan Strauss guy and it was good that he was called out, but the irony of Kevin Durant, the guy who makes burner accounts to argue with teenagers on twitter, telling another person to ""grow up"" is rich as fuck."
"In the future his name will be mentioned right along side other great humanitarians like Gandhi, MLK and Mandela.   His period in Golden State will be viewed as this life altering experience similar to when Malcolm X pilgrimage to Mecca and prayed beside people of all colors and nationalities.    We're blessed to live in this moment with Kevin Wayne Durant. May we all drink as brothers side by side from the Holy johansson Bathwater. "
"Kevin Durant is quoted as saying ""I got"" ""with the knicks"" ""I"" ""traded Porzingis"" ""Me"" ""I'm trying"""
the strauss article? no. that would be this one:https://theathletic.com/802440/2019/02/05/silent-star-on-the-presumed-warriors-exit-of-kevin-durant/
"It's the Knicks. They are the classic loser franchise of the NBA. They've also been without a championship almost fifty years. Kevin Durant deciding to not only leave Golden State, but build a championship contender with the Knicks and give them a few chances at some championships would do a whole hell of a lot for his legacy than just staying behind with an easy path to the Finals. "
Kevin Durant is in here guaranteed.
[Nope](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819624-report-kevin-durant-thought-hed-be-seen-as-better-than-lebron-after-17-finals)
What would Kevin Durant?
[WOJ] Kevin Durant only wants to go to the gym and then go home. No interest in lotion or smelling good. Trade incoming. 
[this article](https://theathletic.com/802440/2019/02/05/silent-star-on-the-presumed-warriors-exit-of-kevin-durant/) written by him. Behind a paywall though
"I don't see SAS, Skip Bayless, or Ethan Strauss working the beat and sitting in post-game press conferences asking Kevin Durant questions.      Do you? "
I was JUST standing next to Ethan Strauss as he rubbed lotion over his torso and joked about smelling good for Kevin Durant when he asked his question...This business is insane. He and the reporters’ lives changed that fast.
"\&gt; NY is a surefire way to guarantee as going down as an all-time great   Wait are we now pretending Kevin fucking Durant isn't an all-time great? I know he's obviously not as great as Bron, but he's still one of the best scorers ever."
"I think it was perfectly justified. When you listen to what he’s saying you can tell what is actually bothering him, the media aren’t concerned about How Kevin Durant is playing basketball they are concerned how they can use his name to generate stories for themselves. When he’s asked questions about something that other people are saying he’s a part of like a move the Knicks made that make them Eligible to sign him, it goes past reporting stories. He’s there to play and try to win games for the Warriors not ponder his free agency future and has no obligation to feed into speculation."
Kevin Durant doesn't personally owe you redditors parity
"Kevin Durant needs to learn that the media are there to work every day, just like he is.      They aren't there to be public relations for players. They are there to find and report on stories that the public will be interested in to drive revenue.        This was disrespectful."

These assholes have no idea how to enjoy something as great as this Warriors team that is right in front of them.  They talk about the shit 24/7.  IT'S CRAZY."

Kevin Durant just went hard AF on the media.  That's my dawg.
Kevin Durant + upset name a more iconic duo
"yeah where's the evidence in that? [this](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/kevin-durant-draymond-green-warriors-thunder-video) says otherwise  &gt;  “Me and KD weren’t really talking during the playoffs. During the playoffs, it’s a little different. More is at stake. So we weren’t talking much, and that’s normal. I heard something come out where they said, ‘Oh, Kevin Durant and Draymond were talking during the playoffs,’ they were lying. But if that’s what they want to believe, if that makes them feel better about themselves — when I say them, I’m talking about whoever, whoever’s saying it — then believe it. But they’re wrong.”   Rich Paul's dumbass went public with it. made it way too obvious  "
God. Imagine the Knicks get the number one pick and trade it with Kevin Knox and all of the assets from the Mavs trade to get AD after signing Durant and Kyrie.  LeBron would be big mad.
You mean the next Kevin Durant?

"**Kevin Durant yelled, “There you go!” Draymond Green gave a look of pleasant surprise. Klay Thompson belted, “We got fucking loads now.” And before Stephen Curry hit the locker room door, ex-NBA star Steve Nash hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so loaded.”**"
&gt;So by the time the Pacers seriously want to compete he’ll be 32.5   Lebron is 34 btw and the Lakers are just now trying to build a team around him. James Harden is 29. Chris Paul is 33. Kevin Durant is 30. Steph Curry is 30.  Would you consider any of those players to be too far on the backside of their career to be someone you'd want in the playoffs? 
"As a college basketball player he's incredibly hyped because he plays for Duke and makes good highlights. As a prospect I'd probably put him in the Ben Simmons or Kevin Durant range. Oden, Wiggins, and LeBron of course were all more hyped as prospects than him."

As far as I am aware Draymond isn't a team nor did he tell KD what amount to sign for and for how long ie, contract specifics. Yes I understand that players can tamper but that is not the same a player tell another he wants to play with him."
Or maybe he wants to compete unlike Kevin Durant
"2 minutes ago the caller ID on my phone said Snake. It was a pre-recorded message from Kevin Durant, who didn't sound too excited reminding me to pick up the latest Metal Gear Solid game.

"Poor guy. Had to carry Steph, Klay, Draymond, Iggy...   Kevin Durant is one of the best scorer all time for sure. But man I really wish he had gone somewhere else and really carried a team on his back."
&gt; You almost never see a team like say the Bucks go from being pretty good to title contender.  The Golden State Warriors  **before** Kevin Durant signed with them.  All they had to do was replace head coach Mark Jackson with Steve Kerr.

"&gt; Look at his resume since joining the Warriors. His finals performances have been all-time.  They are meaningless, however. He's playing on the greatest team ever, a team that can win titles without him. Nobody doubts that he's a great player, one of the best ever in terms of pure basketball, but racking up wins and numbers when your team is miles above any competition isn't that impressive when you're Kevin Durant level good.

"The article says it comes from Ethan Sherwood Strauss, and here's the relevant paragraph from Strauss' article on the Athletic:   &gt; Some teammates believe that his biggest successes are indivisible from what currently ails. Or moreover, the reception of such successes. Sources say that Durant believed his besting of LeBron James in the 2017 Finals would get him hailed as the game’s top player, a mantle he’s craved for some time. While LeBron averaged a 33.6 point-per-game triple-double in that Finals, Durant was superior defensively and hit the series’ biggest shot right in the King’s face.   You would \*never\* get a quote from Durant saying something like that, but Strauss is a highly respected reporter, so if he's attributing something to multiple sources you can believe it's credible.   And let's be clear about why people shit on him. KD is such a whiny brat when it comes to dealing with the media and accountability (he's now on day 9 of refusing to talk to them after games and practices because he's so afraid of the Knicks question following the Porzingis deal, not to mention the burner accounts). He also happens to be the corniest superstar in a league full of corny superstars, he tried to nickname himself ""The Servant"" for god's sake.   &amp;#x200B;  Here's a link to [the article](https://theathletic.com/802440/2019/02/05/silent-star-on-the-presumed-warriors-exit-of-kevin-durant/), but FYI it's behind a paywall.   &amp;#x200B;"
"So i guess in 05-06 and 06-07 the Lakers were proven championship contending teams getting 40 wins a season by your logic.  There was no Shaq, or Payton, or Antoine Walker and Rileys not even coaching on that Heat team prior to LBJ joining. But okay, whatever mental gymnastics you wanna play to defend kevin durant for making the biggest bitch move in nba history.  And funny, if you bothered to look through my history, i am very critical of lebron, the opposite of a slurper. Being objective just lets me realize that Durant's move was much much worse than Lebron's."
"&gt; I didn't go there to make my life easier every day. I didn't so I could stop getting up at 8:30 and try to be the first one on the court. I didn't go there to walk into every game and be satisfied if I have 20 points and shoot 30 percent from the field. That's just like, in my DNA, that's just like my blood, that's what wakes me up. I can't stand when somebody discredits the work. Like, I actually did that. I actually put that in. Don't take that away from me.

"Like I said before, people have a natural tendency to remember the bad more than the good. To them, it doesn't matter how many points he scores, how many wins, or other accolades he gets. Those clips of him flopping or abusing the rules will forever stay in their mind. Even other superstars get this type of treatment. Russell Westbrook despite his historic numbers and achievements, is still hated on because of clips of him *stat-padding* and *stealing rebounds*. Kevin Durant, no matter how good he plays, still gets hated on because he signed to the Warriors. All I'm saying is, no matter how minuscule that part of his game is, this sub won't forget. And its justified. Watching a player foul bait even once in a game makes fans lose respect, and over the years it can make fans hate the player. If that's not clear to you, I don't know what to tell you."
That means you Kevin Durant.  
"&gt;They were actually the betting underdog in 3 of their 4 finals.  2012 they were down in Vegas for two reasons: One - Kevin Durant Just obliterated the western conference and made the Spurs his bitch, no one knew how to stop him (turns out the solution was you don’t stop him, just stop half the Thunder team from playing); Two - 2011 was on everyone’s mind, LeBron was seen as a choker that few believed could win, it was a “I’ll believe it when I see it” moment.  2013 Spurs played brilliant basketball and the Heat had a tough ECF. Their odds went down.  2014 was again similar.  One thing you should remember is that the **Heat started the season as championship favourites ALL 4 years** and only through them “underperforming” (at least to the what we thought they could do) and other teams being brilliant did their odds drop before the Finals."
"KD was a horrible influence on Russ. You would see Russ scream at other players at times to ""shoot the fkn ball!"" on live television because Kevin Durant was telling them to always pass him the ball. The hero ball culture of our previous years were from KD's leadership and culture."
Kevin Durant called him a Unicorn due to his unique size/skillset way back when and it stuck. 
The Thunder have won a total of **three playoff games** without Kevin Durant. I’m not pretending anything 
"Chris W Bush-Bosh.  Or are you thinking of his father, Kevin Durant?"
"You're comparing 2 different plays.   Yes, his play to get the rebound over Kevin Durant was absolute clutch, excellent move by JR.   But him not passing to Lebron for a shot or taking a shot himself or just doing SOMETHING to get points on the board to take the W was what people complained about.  You know how announcers say ""oh it was a hundred dollar move but a penny finish?"" JR's rebound was a million bucks, but his lack of finishing made all that money essentially disappear again.   You can't justify not taking a last second shot by saying ""it would've been blocked by KD."" By that logic, JR shouldn't have gotten the last second rebound either because KD should've gotten that too. But he didn't.   So yes, making the wrong play because you were unaware of the score is a boneheaded move. "
like Kevin Durant soft (soft but irritable) or Kobe's teammates soft (soft like toilet paper) or soft like Carmelos gut
I was so sad atleast we got Kevin Durant that offseason to help cope 
"I think Kevin Durant has less than a 1% chance of going to New York, the only reason there is a chance is his business."
Kevin Durant was far better than Kawhi in 2014 but Kawhi won FMVP and Durant won MVP
Kevin Durant has been the 2nd best player in the league since 2012 (only behind a top 5 player of all-time). No way dude is worse than KG
"If Kevin Durant leaves the Warriors, he instantly becomes a fan favourite around the league like LeBron when he left Miami"
Kevin Garnett was better than Kevin Durant is.  If you replace KD on his team with KG all the teams have the same or better results.  Meanwhile if you put KD on the teams KG had I don't think he is able to do any better.    
"Kevin Durant is in my top 3 favorite players of all time, and I don’t dislike his move to the Warriors.    Pascal Siakam has been the most impressive player on the Raptor’s so far this season over Kawhi &amp; Lowry.   Luka should’ve been an All-Star. "
Lol at Kevin Durant still being listed at 6’9. 
Maybe Wade is still being petty about the beef they had back in [2013](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/09/25/kevin-durant-dwyane-wade-james-harden-top-10-players-2014-sports-illustrated-point-forward) /s
"NEW YORK, July 4 2019  &gt; Three-time MVP Kevin Durant announced his free agency decision this morning. The former Golden State forward will be heading to the New York Knicks, where league sources report he will be part of a larger recruitment drive for highly coveted free agents like Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving.  &gt; ""It literally cannot go tits up,"" said Durant of his New York move."
"I don't think you get to say that you ""carry"" a team with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson "
"I don’t know how he does it, carrying a team with Kevin Durant and three other all stars"
So you can sleep at night saying ‘James Harden  is more efficient  than Kevin Durant ’ ? 😂  You can say that out  loud? With a straight face? Please 
"More then anything that really just shows true shooting % is a farce. And it really needs to be kept out the hands of people who don’t know shit about basketball  James harden is more efficient than Kevin Durant ? How?!   where ?! Like wtf are you even talking about   KD is shooting 50% from the field. Harden is shooting 45%  Harden 37% from 3, KD 36%.   So if they’re about equal from 3 but a massive 5% gap overall, how Tf is harden more efficient.  Y’all analytics nerds are the worst  "
[Here is the 16-17 graph](https://imgur.com/a/9wSQEFo)  It's a little crowded because IT took very little mid-range so I had to lower the bounds quite a bit. He's way at the top next to kevin durant!
Who’s this Kevin Durant guy? Good enough to get a triple double but can’t seem to remember him. Odd.
We lost Kevin Fucking Durant for absolutely nothing and somehow things don’t feel much different than when he was with the team because Paul George is having almost the same level of impact. We are so incredibly fortunate. 
"Fun fact: In the 2016 season, Russell Westbrook assisted Kevin Durant more than any other player in the league assisted a teammate"
"No offense but you just named 5 players with really unique names. Kevin could be Durant, love, or Garnett but it’s iust super common so we can’t asdress them like that. "
Steph Curry is better than Kevin Durant
Here's the article by Ramona Shelburne about KD trying to become a mogul.  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/25951825/golden-state-warriors-star-kevin-durant-focused-building-future-basketball
History will remember the Warriors getting Kevin Durant after commuting the biggest choke in Finals history. Curry will never come close to LeBron on an all time level. 
Except Kevin Durant clearly and that's what matters to keeping them invincible. KD knows that winning with the Warriors will always come with an asterisk for him and he knows that people still don't take him seriously so there is a real chance he leaves and trys to prove the haters wrong and win on his own.
"You did not show that he was the most clutch player that year. You compared him with James Harden, and to a minor extent, Kevin Durant. I never said either of those two were more clutch.  If you want to show that WB was the most clutch, then you would have to compare him with everyone else in the league.  Of course his PIE was high, he had an insane usage, and PIE just accumulates counting stats.   IT had astronomically higher efficiency in the clutch (65% TS vs, 57% TS) and had an almost identical ast/to ratio.  I don’t know where you’re getting your numbers from, because nba.com’s clutch stats do not match your own, particularly eFG%."
"Kyle Lowry averages Post Season 2018: 17.4/4.3/8.8 on 51-44-82%, 65% True shooting Percentage(Same as Curry in 2017) And was 10% Better than Chris Paul on a similar Volume   2018 Series Cavs/Wizards  Kyle Lowry 16-17 Post Season - 16 Points on 11 shots, 6 A / 3 RB Shooting 46/34/82 &amp; 59% TS  Kyle Lowry vs Caveilers and Lebron   2016-2018 averages:  21 PPG 3.6 RPG 6.3 APG on 50.2% FG and 43.3% 3PT vs the Cavs. (61 TS%) (averaged 20PPG on 56%FG in the first two games Vs The 2017 Cavaliers before he left the series with ankle problems)  Kyle Lowry has a higher TS% than Russell Westbrook and Damian Lilard in the NBA playoffs.  Kyle Lowry in game 7’s  24.6 PPG  6 RPG 7 APG 1.7 SPG, 43.4 % FG 47 % 3FG  Kyle Lowry also leads the League All-Time for Playoff Buzzer Beaters under 2:10 Minutes  Kyle Lowry:14 Lebron James:11 Kevin Durant:8"
"I'm not going to list every free agent from 2016, but let's look at the conventional ""top"" ones.  - Lebron James: Just came off of one of the most incredible Finals series ever. He was resigning in Cleveland. Everyone knew this.  - Kevin Durant: Signed with a 73-9 team, went on to win the next two championships. Not remotely surprised he took this over the Lakers.  - Mike Conley, Andre Drummond, Demar Derozan, Hassan Whiteside, Dirk, Bradley Beal: All re-signed with their teams for more than what the Lakers could offer them.  - Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Al Horford, Nic Batum, Etc.: All players that either didn't fit the Lakers (Dwight was never going back), had better opportunities to win elsewhere (Horford to Boston), or were given huge contracts by other teams that weren't too good in hindsight (Wade, Batum).  None of the 2016 free agent class NOT signing with the Lakers is remotely suspect. At all.  Indy traded George because he made it clear he was *NOT GOING TO RE-SIGN* in Indy. There was no guarantee that it was LA or bust for him, but the smart money was on him going there. So they cut their losses and got what they could for him; it turned into an All-NBA caliber player in Oladipo. PG happened to really dig playing alongside Westbrook and fell in love with the team and the city. He re-signed there as a result. It's not suspect, and is probably one of the reasons that Toronto traded for Kawhi, knowing that they had a year to try to entice him into staying. If Kawhi stays in Toronto, is this also league-meddling?  The Pelicans turned down a deal that offered them all these players because they believe they can get better value for Anthony Davis from another team... like, say, the Celtics. Would you rather have Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and picks NOW, or would you rather wait for a package that includes either Jaylen Brown or Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, and potentially better draft picks in a few months? That's a judgement call, and obviously one the Pelicans made on their own - not because the league is trying to fuck over one of its most successful franchises.  This conspiracy theory would be dumb as shit applied to a team like the Hornets or Timberwolves. Applied to the fucking Lakers, though? The league is exponentially more exciting to casual fans when the Celtics and the Lakers are good. There's no way they'd needlessly, and intentionally, handicap one of their biggest successes."
"Questionable if great players want to be buried in his enormous shadow.  It’s like Kevin Durant said, havoc follows in his footsteps wherever he goes. Headline will always be that LeBron wins, or LeBron didn’t get enough help.  Maybe a younger developing  one will come waiting for him to retire. "
KD has the power? No he doesn’t. I’m not giving Kevin Durant credit for joint a team that already won a championship and broke the all time season wins record.   
"I don't understand how any of the smaller market owners agreed to an anti tanking rule. Like, the Pelicans have to trade a superstar that wants to go a bigger market. So how do they have to rebuild? Through the draft. Smaller markets are not going out in free agency and signing Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving. How has the NBA decided to determine draft order? By who's the worst team. Especially with the new lottery odds, being 8th worst would actually give them a small chance at Zion but they'll probably be 12th or 13th now.  In 2016 Adam Silver decided to praise the Blazers for how they rebuilt as an example of not needing to do things like the Sixers. The Blazers starting 5 right now is Dame, CJ, Laymen, Aminu and Nurmic. The Sixers are starting Simmons, Redick, Butler, Harris and Embiid. The Sixers didn't even draft well and that's the team they have right now.  You've already got a league where the big stars seem to have more power to change teams than ever. You can't make it harder for the smaller markets to acquire those stats."
"Even if the Knicks get the #1 overall pick, I think they'd still trade it for AD.  The presence of Anthony Davis should be enough to lure both Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant to NY.  It would require Kawhi &amp; Durant to take about 5% less than max.  But that's not unheard of --- LeBron, Bosh and Wade did something similar in 2010.  Davis, Kawhi and Durant in NYC is just too enticing to pass up.  "

"If by MVP discussion you mean a vote by Royce young as his 5th place for MVP then yes.  If not, Westbrook has absolutely no place in the MVP discussion. Kevin Durant is having a way better year and he's barely in the discussion."
"Elton should reach out to Kevin Durant and teach him some post moves in the offseason, mentoring him in what it means to be a veteran"
"Playing with Gobert helps, but Ingles plays about 10 minutes without Gobert every game and the average points conceded are even lower in that time. In big measure, that defensive score is mostly dependent on 2nd quarter bench lineups, The best defensive lineups Jazz have include Ingles, and the team generally does well when he plays without Gobert or other players, so that's why score-based stats are high for him.  As last year playoffs showed, he's a good defender. He's important in their plan on that end too, not like Gobert, but quite important. He'll usually guard the opponents' star wing, like Paul George or Kevin Durant. He's the best perimeter defender they have in terms of one-on-one, contesting shots. And like the whole team, he's smart about it, he knows how to lead players he's on in crowded or tough positions, and he can be really ""dirty"" and annoying.   I think it's the popular opinion that he's among a group of best perimeter defenders in the league?   "
"... the Warriors are still adding Wilt alongside Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green  with DeMarcus Cousins now coming off the goddamn *bench*  It's the Warriors, because you're taking one of the greatest teams of all time and ADDING WILT"
"I think this entire thing about KD moving to GSW to get away from Westbrook was all propaganda created by the media and the fans just ran with that narrative. The same way that the “Lebron is toxic” narrative that started from another KD comment.  Westbrook has a positive affect on many of his teammates. Oladipo, Kanter, Adams, Carmelo, Paul George and even Kevin Durant stated that Westbrook either help make their job as a player easier or motivated themselves to play harder based on Westbrook’s work ethic. "
Kevin Durant did 100% double dribble. Refs are always making calls in Golden States favour 
"People put too much value on a narrative based award. Steve Nash doesn’t deserve two MVPs and has them anyway.   More than Shaq, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, etc."
"Thanks lol.   Why do you disagree?  I think that if the metric you use for Goat is most accomplished/decorated it would be Kareem  or Bill Russell . If you go by dominance it is on an era to era basis but it got to be Wilt . If you go by best player simply in terms of you take every single player in their prime and put them on the court , I believe Lebrons team wins the most games .   I value players by how much value they bring to winning . The only players in the league over the last 10 years that can determine wether on not their team makes the playoffs regardless of teamates are Lebron and Cp3 . They are among the top all time in both their efficiency offensively and defensively, Kobe is a better player than CP3 but he had losing seasons because he does nothing to improve the team as a whole. Chris Paul has no weakness in his game whatsoever (he does physically , his height  comes into play sometimes) . Most of the games top pg’s today are just high volume scorers who are super flashy but inefficient helping their team win. Chris paul can legitimately guard 1-3 and sometimes even bigs on switches , even at his height . Go watch his switched onto kevin durant in the playoffs . Kyrie , Dame , Russ , Kemba are all average to below average defensively and are self centric point guards."
Yeah you don’t leave Kevin Durant open with the game on the line regardless of the circumstance 
Knicks posted a tweet advertising the deadline to buy season tickets for next year. In the picture was Dotson I believe on the court standing next to Kevin Durant 
"Lol looks like I hit a sensitive spot. So the conversation went from “first round sweeps vs finals sweeps” to you getting emotional and saying “6&gt;3”. Trying having a legit debate and not letting your emotions take over.   &gt;	72 win bulls who actually won the championship would have beaten the warriors   Based off what? Jordan’s teams never played a team as good as the 73 win warriors, let alone the 73 win warriors plus Kevin Durant.   &gt;	hypotbeticals so why even bring it up  Wait so you knew it was a hypothetical but you brought it up anyway? Wtf lol  &gt;	How many 60 win teams has lebron beat conpared to Jordan?  Lmfao what does that have to do with anything? That’s like me saying “how many first round losses does lebron have compared to Jordan?” Or “how many 70 win teams has Jordan beat compared to lebron?”"
i never would assume kevin durant is missing that whether he is 0-6 or not
"I have owned 4 different players jerseys in my life  1. (First jersey) Kevin Durant  2. (2nd jersey) Russell Westbrook (after KD left)  3. Nazr Mohammad Don’t ask me why. He became my all-time favorite Thunder player as a kid. I saw his first second as a Thunder player in person and the next game I was at I made my grandpa, who offered to buy me a New Jersey  (I was 8 or so) buy me a customized Nazr Mohammed Jersey because they didn’t sell his jersey pre-made.   4. Damontas Sabonis  I bought myself a custom made Domantas Sabonis Jersey during his rookie season expecting him to stay in OKC forever and become a building piece. I was right in the aspect that he would become a building block of a midwestern city’s franchise. He is still one of my favorite players.  I have pictures if you don’t believe I have a Sabonis (OKC) or Mahommed (OKC) Jersey. "
&gt; I’m a warriors fan! I just don’t like Durant  &gt; Kevin Durant flair  Totally not a troll guys.
That block by Wade on Kevin Durant near the end of the game was a thing of beauty. I'm glad he got the points from the turnover too.
We would probably be perennial Eastern Conference Finals participants with Kevin Durant. I always thought that our team would be an amazing supporting cast for a superstar. 
"&gt;Kevin Durant clear double dribble.  lol,swear to god Durant used this to score on Kyrie everytime in the 2017 finals"
"This post is all I ever needed to see.  You think Steph Curry is a better all-around basketball player than LeBron James?  This is all I needed to know about your basketball knowledge. That dude has played in the last four finals and has still yet to win a Finals MVP.  That shows a whole ALOT about how much their Finals success did not necessarily have to do with him.  Don't get me wrong, the guy is the best pure shooter to ever play the game, but if not for Andre Iguodala and Klay  they do not beat LeBron's and the powerful trio of Dellavedova and Mozgov four years ago, and who knows how things shape up if Durant never joins the team?  Have you ever thought about that?  Steph Curry has never gotten a clean finals win against LeBron James without either the Cavs being completely banged up or without Kevin Durant.   As for Durant, he had his chance to beat LeBron and earn some potential LeBron-level respect, but failed as the favorite with Oklahoma City.  Instead, he went and joined a 73-win team that both: a) he blew a 3-1 lead against in the Conference finals the year prior and b) lost to LeBron as a heavy favorite as a 73-WIN WITH A 3-1 LEAD in the year prior.    So, how could ever expect someone to think Curry/Durant are better players than LeBron?  In the same breath, how could you expect anyone to respect your opinion saying nonsense like that?  It is absolute lunacy to have that opinion, and I bet 99% of Golden State's own fanbase would not even believe that."
I like what Arnovitz said in one of Lowe's podcast. Being able to play small forward and SG is just a way of saying you can guard Kevin Durant come play off time.

man the distance some people will go to hate on Kevin Durant is bizarre

"Kevin Durant playing with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Steven Adams would be pretty fun"
I don't like Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is going to leave the Warriors and get exposed when he can’t win without an MVP level talent next to him
"We don't know what would have happened if LeBron wouldn't have been there. We do know that the heat had another $23 million cap space to sign other players and they wouldn't have brought in LeBron baggage like crippled Zydrunas Ilgauskas who didn't make it to the all-star break in 2011 before having his career ended by injury or Mike Miller who was injured during his entire stay in Miami. We wasted our Mid-level player exemption on Miller in order to placate LeBron. So that's about $30 million in cap space in 2010, which is equal to $55 million in today's NBA. We would have loaded up and had better depth. Most likely we would have won at least 2011 and 2012. After that it would have been problematic due to Wade going on maintenance mode. But another person tonight stated, LeBron diminishes other star teammates. So Chris Bosh would likely have been unleashed had LeBron not been there rather than taking a back seat as a third wheel like Kevin Love. Look at the Warriors for example. Do you think we're seeing the best out of Curry? If Durant was not there he would be balling out like Harden. To many chefs in the kitchen!"
"Very very true.  Like a fucking 42 point loss to Indie is ""understandable"" because there are RUMOURS of them being traded for a top 5 player in basketball.  In the words of a great philosopher, Kevin Wayne Durant, ""Grow Up"" "

Fuck Kevin Durant
"He’s absolutely in the conversation (especially for first team All NBA) but I hate the third reason: narrative. Paul George is getting extra attention because he’s playing so much better than usual, but that shouldn’t be a feather in his cap. We can’t penalize someone like Kevin Durant or Steph Curry for *already* being superstars before this year. "
Kevin Durant
"So imagine this NBA in the late 00's: These would be 16 best team lineups if every lottery team picked the IMO best available players at the moment in the drafts from '96-'09, and then never traded them away, based on these [redrafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aohdgx/rnba_game_threads_index_daily_discussion_february/eg3jzov/) I've done in the past few days. So here's basically if every team played their cards right in the 90's and 00's drafts:   Team | PG | SG | SF | PF | C | Bench including ---|---|----|----|----|----|---- 1. Raptors | Allen Iverson | Richard Hamilton | Rashard Lewis | LaMarcus Aldridge | Chris Bosh | Andrei Kirilenko, J. R. Smith, Raymond Felton, Taj Gibson, Tony Battie, *Kurt Thomas* 2. Bulls | Russell Westbrook | Andre Iguodala | Shawn Marion | Amar'e Stoudemire | Zach Randolph | Rajon Rondo, Kenyon Martin, Arron Afflalo, Mo Williams, Desmond Mason 3. Clippers | Tony Parker | Stephen Curry | Peja Stojaković | Josh Smith | Dirk Nowitzki | *Jerry Stackhouse*, Baron Davis, Goran Dragić, Josh Howard, Jamal Crawford, Ersan İlyasova, Aaron Brooks, Brevin Knight, Nenê 4. Grizzlies | Steve Nash | James Harden | Vince Carter | Stephen Jackson | Mehmet Okur | Manu Ginobili, DeAndre Jordan, Al Horford, Caron Butler, Michael Redd, Boris Diaw, *Joe Smith* 5. Warriors | Mike Bibby | Tyreke Evans | Joe Johnson | Carlos Boozer | *Kevin Garnett* | Ben Wallace, Shane Battier, *Bruce Bowen*, Kyle Korver, Devin Harris, Randy Foye, Derek Anderson, D. J. Augustin 6. 76ers | Rafer Alston | Kobe Bryant | Tracy McGrady | P. J. Tucker | *average C* | Trevor Ariza, Ramon Sessions, *Michael Finley*, *Sam Cassell*, *Eric Piatkowski* 7. Hornets | Kyle Lowry | Wilson Chandler | Danny Granger | Elton Brand | Al Jefferson | Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Marcin Gortat, Nicolas Batum, Brandon Jennings, *Alonzo Mourning*, *Dikembe Mutombo* 8. Wizards | José Calderón | Rasual Butler | Ron Artest | *Rasheed Wallace* | Pau Gasol | Luol Deng, Matt Barnes, *Donyell Marshall* 9. Cavaliers | Jason Terry | Jason Richardson | LeBron James | Lamar Odom | Shareef Abdur-Rahim | Luis Scola, Ben Gordon, Morris Peterson, Troy Hudson 10. Timberwolves | Stephon Marbury | Steve Francis | Jeff Green | *Antonio McDyess* | Kevin Love | Jrue Holiday, Jeff Teague, Raja Bell, J. J. Redick, Jarrett Jack, *Robert Horry*, *Eddie Jones* 11. Celtics | Chauncey Billups | DeShawn Stevenson | Ricky Davis | Jermaine O’Neal | Joakim Noah | Andrea Bargnani, Keith Van Horn, Tyson Chandler, Troy Murphy 12. Thunder | Andre Miller | Luke Ridnour | Leandro Barbosa | Blake Griffin | Marc Gasol | Andrés Nocioni, Brook Lopez, Emeka Okafor, J. J. Barea 13. Bucks | Chris Paul | Ray Allen | Anthony Parker | Thaddeus Young | Udonis Haslem | *Jason Kidd*, Kirk Hinrich, Eric Gordon, Cuttino Mobley, Darren Collison 14. Magic | Eddie House | Mike Miller | Matt Harpring | Dwight Howard | *Shaquille O'Neal* | Brad Miller, Keyon Dooling, Andrew Bynum, Ronnie Brewer, *Chris Webber* 15. Trail Blazers | Delonte West | Louis Williams | Kevin Durant | Rudy Gay | *average C* | Ryan Anderson, *Brent Barry* 16. Nuggets | Dwyane Wade | Paul Pierce | Tayshaun Prince | Tim Thomas | *average C* |   Honorable mention: Detroit Pistons with Larry Hughes, Gerald Wallace, Carmelo Anthony, Stromile Swift and Juwan Howard.   Yeah, I can edit those rankings if you've got a convincing argument. I also added counted a couple of players from 1991-95 drafts, mostly notable ones who played into the late 00's, and re-drafted those drafts just with them. Though they're in italics and most likely benched, since most of them declined by then. If a team lacks ideal lottery picks in a position, assume an average player in that position is there."
Calling out people for their bullshit isn't acting like an adult? I swear you folks lose all your brain cells when Kevin Durant is involved. 
If only Westbrook could have played like this when he had...  You know...  Kevin Durant.

"There was a HORSE competition in the All-Star Weekend, Kevin Durant won both times"
[As is tradition](https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)
"I didn't think it would be possible for fans to universally hate someone more than Kevin Durant, but the NBA and ESPN have figured it out. Turns out we hate traveling more than ruining the competitive balance for 10 years."
And in the process they're giving one of their strongest contenders Kevin freaking Durant. 
I remember a youtube video in 2009(when HS mixtapes were getting popular) of him as a 6'6 13 year old clowning everyone with guard handles and dunking all over them. Looked like the next possible Kevin Durant. He barely grew and his development has been underwhelming since then.
"No bro trust me, Kevin Durant is 100 percent correct. He also has great hair and totally banged Scarlett Johannason."
"Talent is the physical or mental gifts you are blessed with. Andrew Wiggins is talented as hell.   Skill is developed through ridiculous repetition, good teaching and experience.  Greatness is the ability to use the above and achieve amazing accomplishments e.g. a championship.  Giannis has the body composition and athleticism which rivals the most talented players in history. Kevin Durant is more skilled than Giannis. Although he is also ridiculously talented, an argument can be made that Giannis is more talented."
"What adds on to the media bullshit and justifies why the media ”should” keep doing what they do are the fans that eat that shit up and use it against players they don’t like.   &gt;	Kevin “I make burner accounts to argue with teenagers on twitter” Durant told a group of adults to “grow up” because they reported what happened. His reaction was ridiculous, and he’s ridiculous.  Exhibit A. "
"""Ssssssssssstay in school kids."" - Kevin Durant"
"Kevin “I make burner accounts to argue with teenagers on twitter” Durant told a group of adults to “grow up” because they reported what happened. His reaction was ridiculous, and he’s ridiculous. "
“Kevin Durant was pretty bad his rookie year .”  KD rookie year stats: 20.3 ppg 4.4 rpg 2.3 apg  I think it’s fair that if you was watching this man come in we knew he was special immediately and It was only a matter of him mastering his craft ..  Now with cases like Ingram the immediate comparisons hurt how people were going to initially expect him to show up on the court. And their games were more different then people want to admit they are both just listed 6’9+ and have stupid length and presumably “skinny” so people assumed dude was gone come on the scene some special 😂.   Anyways horrible take on Kd rookie year
"Well immediately is the wrong word, it's year 3 for him and every shred of statistical evidence indicates that he's a terrible NBA player. It's absolutely ok not to be good right away. For example, Kevin Durant was pretty bad his rookie year. But if you're in your third season and are still as bad as Brandon Ingram is now it's exceedingly unlikely that you will live up to your potential. Durant, for example, was already a good player his second year and was one of the best players in the league his third year."
More like a hybrid of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant  Length of KD combined with athleticism of Westbrook
The tide is turning. I think we are all coming to like Kevin Durant now
Could have at least made an effort for Harrison Barnes.  But the front office couldn't foresee Kevin Durant trying to go to Golden State. I mean its not like everyone speculated Kevin Durant could go to Golden State or anything. /s
"kevin durant, lebron james, anthony davis"
"I was reading a thread on here where people were discussing franchise changing superstars.  A redditor mentioned that OG Anunoby could grow into a superstar and a ton of people started agreeing with him/her. Anyone who disagreed was downvoted into oblivion.  OG ANUNOBY IS NOT A SUPERSTAR. NOR WILL HE GROW INTO ONE.  Yes he is a very good player. Yes he is shooting nearly 33% from 3. I'm not saying he won't be a star or that he isn't one already (He's leading the kings to a winning record), but he won't be a SUPERSTAR. Superstars are RARE. I know everyone gets hyped on there players but please lets be realistic. I already know I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this post but somebody has to say it. Kevin Durant, Giannis, Lebron. Those are superstars. Buddy Hield is 21. Those players were significantly better at or before that age. He's a great player. But he won't be a superstar."
"1.	“I’ll let you go watch the J. Cole concert if you all get your ass back on transition.” – Mike Malone to Team LeBron at All-Star weekend.  2.	“I don’t really have a favorite player to guard. I guess somebody on the bench who doesn’t play. It’s easier to guard them.“ – Kawhi Leonard.  3.	“People love saying the name. I’m like Elvis. Swaggy Presley.” – Nick Young.  4.	“They call Canadians soft and then they call me evil … pick one.” – Jamal Murray.  5.	“Wus good twittos ?!” – Serge Ibaka on Twitter.  6.	“In 2010, I was mad at @KingJames for leaving Cleveland … but I’ve been in Miami for a total of 5 min and now I totally understand.” – Kirk Cousins.  7.	“It’s not like the president shutting down the government. It’s basketball.” – Kevin Durant on Anthony Davis’s trade request.  8.	“Maybe I should Bird Box.” – Kyle Kuzma on avoiding trade rumors.  9.	“We’re not there yet, but pretty soon little black kids in the hood will be wearing his jersey.” – Charles Barkley on Luka Doncic.  10. “Running.” – Nikola Jokic on the hardest part of the All-Star skills challenge.  "
"Yeah, given that his scoring has never approached KD's it might be more homeless man's Kevin Durant."
"Off the top of the head, Eddie Jones, Michael Finley, Tayshaun Prince...  There’s way too many guys who’ve played this game to come with ‘a poor man’s Kevin Durant’ was bag literally make me laugh out loud. One of the most unique 1 of 1 players ever to play the game. "
&gt;much closer to a poor man's Kevin Durant   Omg if raps fans ever said shit like this they'd be downvoted into the floor.  
"it’s not that complicated... adults can’t change their bone structure. But gaining muscle, fat, water is no problem. Karl Malone was a big guy, Lebron is just wide. If kevin durant got in the weight room and put on 20 kilos of muscle he wouldn’t look the same as Lebron even if they had the same body composition relative to height. "
"Really didn't think I'd have to spell this out, but I guess I do.  The comp was **poor man's Kevin Durant**.  Not saying they're the same player.  And the discrepancy I'm point out is that calling Middleton even poor man's KD on defense would be generous."
"He's actually much closer to a poor man's Kevin Durant.  He has an an extremely high level mid-range game, I would argue borderline elite.  He can pass, shoot 3s, has good ball skills.  His preference when everything else is the same is to play the mismatch, pick on a smaller player, and use his length to shoot over the defender.  &amp;#x200B;  The reason Khris is a second star is because of his versatility.  He's the only real creator on the Bucks other than Giannis and Bledsoe, and he has much more diversity in his game than Eric.  When Giannis is off the court, the Bucks can run through Khris."
"Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant, James Harden, obviously Chris Paul, LeBron James, Mike Conley, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Damian Lillard, Nikola Vucevic, obviously Kyle Lowry and obviously John Wall."
"I imagine losing Kevin Durant does a number on ""future plans""."
Kevin Durant as your choice is a lmao. If anything its Giannis. 
"I'd like to take a moment, on this day, to thank Kevin   ""The Servant"" Durant for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 4th, 2016. Not for going to the Flubs, but for leaving. The Bitch is all numbers, especially his favorite number, 2nd, and him leaving gave Russell Westbrook an opportunity to pursue history. Remember all of our 4th quarter meltdowns last year? It's because Russ would always defer to Skin n Bones. Look at Russ's clutchtime stats this year, it's remarkable. Little Nipples makes history by taking the hardest road, Russell ""King of the Prarie"" Westbrook makes history by breaking a 55 year old record that may never be broken again. Kevin is cursed, it's why he got injured, and now Steph is injured, he'll come up second again this year. And to top it all off Trump takes away our Szechuan sauce, damn. So thank you Mr. Durant, for being the real MVP, the real Ms. Durant, for getting your unclutch ass outta town.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nbacirclejerk) if you have any questions or concerns.*"

"&gt;all this all-star weekend did was confirm Kevin Durant and Kyrie are going to link up. the signs are all there.  God I hate Twitter. If nothing happens, Durant stays with the Warriors, Kyrie stays with the Celtics, Davis goes to Boston or something, everyone is gonna be like ""oh wow look it's as if we completely overestimated these things""   AS IT ALWAYS FUCKING HAPPENS"

[Random Reddit Dude] Report: We 'Have No Idea' If Kevin Durant Will Re-Sign in Offseason.  FTFY
"&gt; I'm honestly pessimistic about any marquee free agent here.  You sound like me, talking about the warriors, 15 years ago.  Let's see, back in those days, our marquee free agent signings were:   -Speedy Claxton  -Overpaying Corey Maggette at a Tim Hardaway Jr. Level rate  -Overpaying Adonal Folye to stay (and rationalizing it with ""he's not a bad center, and that's the market rate"")  -Overpaying Derek Fisher, by a lot, to come.    The warriors, of that era, paid Antwan Jamison the max.  We rationalized it with ""yeah, who else is going to take our money?"" Paid a massive contract extension to Mike Dunleavy Jr.    Here's an old bleacher report article, to give you some idea.  It was published in 2011, and it lists the 12 best free agent signings in warriors history:   https://bleacherreport.com/articles/666558-golden-state-warriors-the-12-best-free-agent-signings-in-team-history#slide1  Keep in mind now, these are the 12 best ones.  They are:   12) one season of a broken down Mark Price at the end of his career  11) Anthony Toliver, who played one season in Golden State before going onto a pretty good career  10) Mario Ellie for two years, who average 12 points a game.   9) Dorrell Wright who the warriors signed on the cheap.  I remember being excited about this signing.  8) Derek Fisher.  Tells you everything you need to know about the pre-Lacob Warriors that Derek Fisher, whose contract was an albatross and didn't do anything for the team, is still the 8th best free agent signing.   7) Jon Barry signed and it was ""a nice gesture to his father"", he hardly played.  6) Terry Teagle, don't remember his career, my first season as a fan was the 1990-91 season, which is just after Teagle left, so no comment on this.   5) Earl Boykins, the 5'5 backup PG.  Nice.  4) Brian Cardinal AKA the custodian, had one good year with the Warriors, and was promptly overpaid in free agency by Memphis.  3) Reggie Williams he was a find, for a short time, as he played some quality minutes for the warriors, but he's never been an NBA starter  2) Speedy Claxton that's right, the second best free agent signing in Warriors history was only brought on board because the warriors lost Gilbert Arenas to the Wizards that same summer and Cohan had to spend on someone to replace him.  Speedy was traded in the deal that brought Baron Davis to the warriors later on.  1) Rod Higgins, that's right, the best free agent the warriors signed pre-2011 was a ""solid starter"" tier player.    Terry Teagle is the only guy on this list I absolutely never watched play.  Higgins I have fuzy memories of, but I do remember the end of his career with GS.  Fisher and Folye?  We used to mention them derisively on an old warriors forum I was a part of as ""F+F"".    It can turn around, but the only way its ever going to is if Dolan sells the team to someone who can turn it around.  That's my lesson from being a warriors fan during the Cohan era start to finish: ownership matters, more than any other single factor.    Let's re-do that BR article post 2011, the best signings would be Andre Iguodala, Zaza Pachulia, Kevin Durant, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins, David West, its been a complete turnaround.  "
"Look man I ain't saying you're wrong. In fact, it would make the best sense to go the clips. Jerry West has the fucking midas touch.   I'm honestly pessimistic about any marquee free agent here. Just as I am pessimistic that LA will ever be clipper town in this generation unless Kevin Durant becomes LeBron +MJ and wins every frigging thing for at least a decade or so, and even then maybe they just entered the convo because old heads will always gravitate towards the purple and gold.   "
"&gt;&gt; “I’m going to be honest with you—after that whole OKC thing, with the contract and all, it felt like my back was against the wall,” he says, referring to last offseason. The Thunder kept Waiters in limbo while Kevin Durant pondered his future. Once KD bolted, Waiters was no longer in the franchise’s long-term plans, despite the team previously hinting that he was. “It felt like they played with my life and with my family. I had offers—stuff you can’t pass up—and for them to hold out that long? It’s messed up.”  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/dion-waiters-interview/"
"Thats why he should not bother leaving. Win as many championships/fmvps as possible with this warriors team. make a ton of money and then enjoy watching his critics say 4,5 or 6 time nba champion kevin durant every time they have to mention his name."
"""I have just been informed that Kevin Durant does not know what he will be eating for breakfast in 4 months.""  "
"I HATE Kevin Durant (not genuinely, just in a sports way) more than any other athlete and even I would immediately flip and be excited to see what he can do in New York."
Don’t forget Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson 
"Sure they are the best player but how excited am I supposed to get when someone tells me Kevin Durant is the best player on his team? I already know that. I already know he has moves and is damned hard to stop. It's a bit ho hum. It's even worse in the NFL, the superbowl MVP almost always goes to the winning team's QB, whoop-di-fucking-doo!"
Kevin Durant was also very high on Willie Cayley Stein just a few months ago on CJ McCollum’s podcast. I’m not reading too much into this just yet. 
"What a coincidence; I also ""have no idea"" if Kevin Durant will re-sign with the Warriors in the off-season. "
"*Kevin Durant was asked where he would play next year, to which he replied, “I’m Ed Davis.””"

Kevin Durant isn't confident that's why he had to go to the warriors and why he gets into spats with kids on the internet who hurt his feelings
"Yea sure that’s definitely why he went to the warriors. Not for a multitude of other reasons, but because he couldn’t handle the pressure of winning. If that’s how you see it that’s cool, doesn’t make it fact, and it doesn’t change the fact Kevin durant made Oklahoma relevant and did a lot before coming to the warriors. "
"Y’all keep saying this every year. “2016 offseason was the GOAT!” “2017 offseason was the craziest ever!”  This has been going on since Deandre Jordan got kidnapped inside his own house. We’re literally looking at an offseason where Anthony Davis will be traded, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving. and Kawhi Leonard might switch team, and who knows what other drama. It’s going to be beat *easily*. "
"On the other hand, if Kevin Durant leaves this summer then our future is a lot more murky, and there's a good chance that Curry reverts to his 2016 self, which could be pretty entertaining."

Kevin Durant literally bashed LeBron going to Miami. 
Ok this is what we need to get rid of at r/nba. Bogus statements. Kevin Durant is not going to the Knicks people. Why the hell would he go there ? 
After Kevin Durant threatened to leave the country if not traded.
"LOL imagine watching the Warriors on opening night 2016, wondering how in the world they would follow up that 73-9 season, and then Kevin Durant takes the court at SF instead of Harrison Barnes."
"D League All Star MVP Quinn Cook, very similar to NBA All star All star Kevin Durant, actually."
"&gt; Harden gets a smaller proportion of his points from free throws than Adrian Dantley (1984), Allen Iverson (2006), and Kevin Durant (2010)  I think this should shut some people up. All of these really just prove how great his season is."
ive realized that people just don’t want to face the reality that kevin durant has been the best player in the world for about two years running now  
Lakers will win 2019 Championship.   Anthony Davis will play with Kevin Durant for the Golden State Warriors.   Knicks will get two or three #1 Draft Picks.   James Harden will play for the Golden State Warriors.   Another GM will be fired for doing weird stuff.  
OP is Kevin Durant.. lol

"The average male human being is around 5'5'' - 5'7''.  There are like 2 billion 5 footers in the world, yet, there's not a single good 5 footer in the NBA. Not even one, meanwhile there are like maybe 5 thousand male human beings taller than 6'10'' around the world and they outnumber 5 footers in the NBA, by a lot... Not only that the guys taller than 6'10'' are usually really fucking good (Giannis, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Embiid, etc).  It's basically just about being tall. Giannis is a soccer reject who switched to Basketball at age 14 after a random guy in the streets of Greece saw how tall he was and literally told him that if he pursued a Basketball career he would give his parents a job (he never saw him playing a sport, let alone Basketball, he just saw his physique) and Giannis is already the best Basketball player in the world, even if he started to play late in life and in a mad-Football-country with 0 Basketball infrastructure like Greece, for fucks sake, Greece never produced a good Football player but they produced the best Basketball player in the world even if they don't give a fuck about Basketball.   It makes you think. "
"Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant were speaking in the hallway after the all star game. Reading Kyrie’s lips it seemed like he said, “two max slots. Me and you. Oh yeah, and John Jenkins.” "
"KD's company didn't move to Boston.

They won't show up in Boston, because why would they be in Boston, or even Brooklyn, because it takes too long to get to Brooklyn."

"KP asked for a trade to get us assets and leave the Mavs next year to return to the Kevin Durant-led Knicks, change my mind."
40 year old Kevin Durant signs a 1 year deal with the newly refounded Sonic's and retires at the end of the season.  KD spends 2 years in seattle. His rookie season and his final season
"People keep referring them to the ""73 wins"" team like the team is somehow magically that team without KD. Literally the only thing that's the same are Curry and Klay. Draymond has significantly declined and Igoudala is pretty much a shell of himself. Also that ""73"" wins team struggled heavily in the playoffs against Portland and OKC because they're a good team that focused way too much of their efforts on regular season wins. Fact is, this team needs Kevin Durant."
&gt; they might make warriors a run for their money  remember. the team that won 73 games added Kevin Durant and then they added Boogie Cousins. I highly doubt it. Boogie just pushes them over the top.
"&gt; At press time, Kevin Durant was considered a leading contender to be signed and then traded away for extra cap space in 2022.  Fuck that team had a family!! "
"Robinson, Malone, LeBron, Wade, Westbrook  First team all-hungry  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Brandon Ingram, (young) MJ, (young) Curry  Who win?  hungries have a weak spot in Ingram but they also got MJ+Kareem+ Warriors MVPs. Team one more well rounded with much better passing, AND would crash the bourds, but only Lebron as a 3pt threat."
"I like how you just say “cool” when it comes to Stackhouse averaging 30 PPG in a season. Since 2000, the only players to average 30 PPG in a season are:  Shaquille O’Neal  Allen Iverson  Jerry Stackhouse  Tracy McGrady  Kobe Bryant  Lebron James  Dwyane Wade   Kevin Durant  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Stephen Curry  Like it or not...that is elite company. Mitchell would be happy to accomplish such a feat. "

My Next Chapter (Deadass I Actually Left The Warriors) by Kevin Durant
"It's probably the same guy voting James Harden as the best Athlete, Kyrie Irving as the best pure shooter, and Kevin Durant and the best defender in the league"
Kevin Durant going to the Warriors sealed LeBron leaving. What were we gonna do? Go back to the finals with the same team and go through the same nightmare of a season only to to lose in 5 again? 
No fucking way Kevin Durant is over Westbrook. Let's be real 
no he is not dude i'd trust kevin durant over him rn 
I read this as Kevin Durant 
"Will Kevin Durant be the star actor? Space Jam 1 had the best player at the time as the star, I hope Space Jam 2 follows this recipe."
"Disagree. That team and this team is world's apart in terms of effectiveness and chemistry. Stephen Curry and Klay are pretty much the only players that are the same. Draymond has declined significantly, and the bench mob is now one of the worst in the NBA. Kevin Durant is heavily relied upon on this particular team."
"The thing about it is that we won't see another KD for a long ass while. We don't really have a solid comparison for him. The best we have is ""A more athletic dirk that's a better defender and better at putting the ball on the floor"". You don't have to literally be the best player of your generation to be a generational talent. You're confusing generational talent and best player in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  To clarify: Tim Duncan has held the title of best player in the league but he's not a generational talent. Even in his generation we've seen really similar players to him (Al Horford is basically dude's mini-me), Kevin Durant hasn't been the consensus best player in the league but is a generational talent. We don't have another player that's quite like him in terms of physical makeup and playstyle. "
"&gt; Stephen Curry (75/196, 38.3%)  &gt; Kevin Durant (36/90, 40.0%)  &gt; Klay Thompson (35/91, 38.5%)  Man honestly fuck this shit.  I'm glad I was able to rekindle my Nets fandom this season because otherwise I wouldn't find this season entertaining at all, this Warriors team is just too damn good.  Happy for Brook Lopez though."
Kevin Durant would wreck Michael Jordan if they played 1v1 in their athletic primes. 
“Me neither”- Kevin Durant
"I will admit easily was the wrong word to use, but they're nowhere near as good as they are with KD. KD makes them an all time great team competing with the 90s Bulls and Lakers/Celtics of the 80s. Without KD, they're just a good team with a chance to win if everything falls in their favor. The notion that they don't need Kevin Durant is just ridiculous. Every team wants to win, and a superstars' goal should be wanting to win and putting yourself in the best situation to win."
"Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Demarcus Cousins. "
"But his legacy is ""I'm Kevin Durant and I made the literal softest move in NBA history in order to be gifted championships."" I don't see how you can continue to support the move when it waters down Steph's championships."
"&gt; and had Bron on the Warriors and had Kevin Durant with Kyrie and Kevin Love, Bron would've obliterated that entire team  yes this has been true LeBron's entire career. he always needs the better team to win."
"I watched both series, I didn't need to see both of these shots, though they were great. If you literally switched the players, and had Bron on the Warriors and had Kevin Durant with Kyrie and Kevin Love, Bron would've obliterated that entire team. Kyrie and Kevin Love and those role players without Lebron might've been an 8 seed. Curry, Klay, and Draymond without KD were the greatest regular season team of all time. There's a difference. And all that means is that Lebron is carrying a much heavier load than KD was in that series, obviously. "
"Kevin Durant is a poor example because he plays good defense alongside elite offense. And the reason the league cares more about offense is because good offense is much more valuable than good defense unless you're a Center. It sounds like you're overrating defensive impact. Curry, Durant, and Harden are all time great offensive players.  Brodie is also terrible example to use. He's not nearly as good a defender as the other you've named and his offense this year has been below average. Even if the league cared more about defense he wouldn't be top 4 this year.  Finally, if other players could score high volume on good efficiency, then why don't they? Most players lose efficiency when they increase volume. Harden is shooting an above average eFG% and an elite TS% on the highest volume in the league. You can't tell me that Lillard and KAT would be able to do that with a straight face."
"I've heard this argument before, but it's not the whole story.  Warriors won in 2015. Then a record breaking regular season in 2016 followed by a 3-1 lead in the finals, which they blew. But it is way too easy a thing to just say that the Warriors lost. How did they lose? If you break it down you see that Curry and Thompson were extremely erratic, they each had 3 great games and 4 bad games. Not great for your 2 best players. Barnes was horrible. Bogut got hurt and missed 2+ games. Green got suspended game 5. Iguoldala also got hurt, but unlike Bogut he played, however, he didn't look great post-injury.  On the other side Lebron played out of his mind and Kyrie was probably the 2nd best player in the series. All of that happened and it STILL went 7 games and came down to a literal last minute prayer by Kyrie to win them the series.  If the teams remained the same for the following year, my money would have been on Golden State to reclaim the title because I don't think the stars would've aligned for Cleveland again.  They definitely did not need to add Kevin Durant. The two teams were relatively equal, no shit adding Durant pushes them to be clear favorites, and thus I don't give Durant a whole lot of credit for their success."
Kevin Durant
&gt; I am also confused when Warriors fans say we have to respect their 3-1 Finals record when 1 of those rings was won against the most injured team in nba Finals history and the other 2 were won after laughably overpowering the league when Kevin Durant bandwagoned for a guaranteed ring  my man
The Lee Jenkins article posted here a couple of hours ago was really eye-opening. Imagine losing Kevin Durant and still having the hope that you can get it done. 
"**Snakes in the Lane**  ""I'm tired of these muthafuckin' snakes in this muthafuckin' lane!""  Starring Kevin ""Snake Pigskin"" Durant. "
"Is he best offball?  I thought one of the things learned is that Steph offball really gets mugged in post-season play, which led to them think one of the lessons of losing to the Cavs was not play him offball as much...except they got Kevin Durant. "
"You're right. Warriors do need KD if they expect to win championships. I don't like the notion that the Warriors don't need KD to win. They absolutely do need KD to win titles. Boogie aside, because he's just a one year rental, the Warriors are basically a team with 2 all-stars, a former all-star on the decline and a bunch of D league rotation players without Kevin Durant. Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and Milwaukee, I feel like can easily beat Golden State without KD. Maybe even OKC."
Plus you don't have a lifelong friendship with Kevin Durant to maintain.
Jonathan Bender would be in my lineup.  Dude had the potential to be Kevin Durant years before Kevin Durant.  Too bad he had no knees.
"Points per drive is probably the better indicator.    Joe only shoots 0.4 FTA per drive.  Which means he's getting solid looks on cuts.   Which is still great.  Players that can cut effectively and take advantage of offensive execution are GREAT to have.  Including free throws made, points per drive leaders for the top 100 drivers (by # of drives per game), would be:   * T.J. Warren * Blake Griffin * Kevin Durant * Bojan Bogdanovic * Kyle Kuzma  Kawhi sneaks in as 6th.  If limited to the 42 guys that drive 10 or more times a game, the top 5 would be:  * Kawhi Leonard * Zach LaVine * LeBron James * James Harden * Caris LeVert  Giannis sneaks in as 6th.  Bledsoe is 26th.  Beal is 13th.  Ingles is 38th of those 42 guys.  As none of the guys in the second group are in the first, I'm assuming there is definitely some diminishing return to volume.. Eg. the more you drive, the less likely you are to produce as high a points per drive.  Makes sense.  Ultimately, this is an argument for Kawhi, as he's has REALLY HIGH points per possession at VERY MEANINGFUL volume (14 drives a game).    Of course all that said, we could factor in AST %s as well.  Kawhik has a 6.8% assist % on his drives.  Whereas Ingles is at 13.9%.  In essence, Ingles is doing a lot of running, cutting, shooting open layups or passing along to the next open guy in the offense. Bledsoe also has a high assist %, 13.1% on his drives.   In an effort to COMPLETELY make up a stat, I ranked all 42 guys first by PointsPerDrive and second by AST %.  Then I created a made up combined ranking, by multiplying the PPDrive rank by 75% and AST% by 25%.  The top 5, then, are:  * James Harden * LeBron James * Kawhi Leonard * Lou Williams * Kyrie Irving  If I wanted to put more emphasis on scoring efficiency, and changed the formula to multiple each ranking by 50% (so equal weighting), the top 5 become:  * James Harden * LeBron James * Lou Williams * Devin Booker * De'Aaron Fox  There you have it... random made up stat fun!      "
"fine ill let you pick Kyle Korver to take the last shot,ill be fine with lets say Kevin Durant...and im not coming to your funeral lmao  there is a reason why some players dont want the pressure of last shot,or taking a penalty...lionel messi is famous for his rather mediocre penalties,yet he is one of the best if not the best soccer players ever  and you cant put that into numbers,the pressure of performing at the right moment just exists and some players handle that pressure better than others"

Marc Gasol has a strong argument too that season but I could see somebody taking Melo over him.  also, he put up 29/6.6/1.6 with 1.1 stl and 2.6 TO on 40/30/89% in the playoffs while taking 52% of his shots in the mid-range- not that great for a T5 player"
Kevin Durant and Jamie Foxx please
"Not many Bucks fans were even talking about the Bucks at that point. Everyone was pretty much ready to just give up on this franchise it felt like, I know I was feeling it. We were so bad that season but Giannis would have a flash or highlight play every other game and you could really see something in this kid lol I'll never forget the game his rookie year, first time playing Kevin Durant and Giannis blocks the shit out of him. I was like damn! Get it rook!"
"Lebron had to form that team with Wade and Bosh to be able to contend against the Celtics super-team. They had Rondo, Allen, Pierce, Garnett. All playing incredibly well. Fair enough, Lebron and Kyrie were in their prime in '16 (Lebron has been in his prime for about 13 years now), but Love was a shadow of who he was in Minnesota. I believe he average one of his lowest PPG seasons in their championship year, so I'm not giving you that one. That leaves 2 all NBA players, and yes, there were. Spurs had Duncan, Ginobili and Parker, all in their primes. Pierce and Rondo were both also in their primes. Kobe, Gasol.  &amp;#x200B;  2016 Cavs had two All-NBA players and a struggling all-star in Kevin Love. Warriors had 3 all-stars in the height of their prime. Clippers had 2 All-NBA caliber players (DeAndre Jordan has never, is never and never will be an All-NBA type player).  Lebron joined a decent team, formed a big-3 and made them great. Kevin Durant joined the, statistically, best team in the history of the NBA with an existing big-3. How are these remotely comparable?"
"For Boston, I'd take Kevin Durant or Anthony Davis in a heartbeat"
Warriors trade everyone not named Kevin Durant
I’m betting there’s a lot more articles out there stating that KD is the best player in the league rn or the second best. And here’s what KD thinks: Kevin Durant says it's 'easier' to be the best player on a bad team than stand out on a great one.   Here’s the link for the article from where that quote came: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-its-easier-to-be-the-best-player-on-a-bad-team-than-stand-out-on-a-great-one/
Just like how you guys traded Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant 
"So you're saying:  Devin Booker, , Dennis Smith Jr, Colin Sexton, Zach Lavine, , Trae Young  vs  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Demarcus Cousins  Yeah that crushes the Warriors."
That was Paul George's 5th heave attempt for OKC and first make (second of his career).  Kevin Durant was 0 for 3 for his entire Thunder tenure. 
"Kevin Durant beefs with 12 year olds on Twitter, Westbrook saves it for real life "
No.  Kevin Durant in 2014 was unstoppable 
"why? lakers tried to sign paul george, he stayed with okc. they tried a kawhi trade, spurs chose toronto. and after that it's almost impossible to make a championship level team with the remaining free agents. [deandre, cousins and favors were the best remaining if you exclude the unlikely ones like durant, restricteds etc.](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/06/25/nba-free-agency-2018-lebron-james-kevin-durant-chris-paul). best option was to fill squad with 1 year contracts and try again later for kawhi, butler, klay... this is not mind boggling at all. this makes sense the most. it's not like they didn't try to sign someone good."

"I think it's probably getting to him that Lakers fans are turning on him and calling Kobe better than him, as well as the recent thing in the media of calling Kevin Durant the best player in basketball now."
"If your shoes are the right size and properly tied, they won't fall off.  In fact, you would struggle mightily to pull off a shoe that's properly sized and tied.  The vast majority of NBA players will go their entire careers without their shoes falling off.   [KD's shoes fall off the most of anyone:](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-kevin-durants-shoes-keep-falling-off/)    &gt; “My feet are so weird, man. I’ve got flat feet. I’ve got all sorts of calluses and corns on my feet,” says Durant, who wears orthotics and two pairs of socks during games in hopes of reducing friction.  &gt; Durant wears a size-18 while on the court — one full size bigger than what he wears when in casual settings.  His shoes are wayyy too big for him.  He has calluses on his feet *because* his shoes are too big and his feet slide around.  &gt; Nick Collison, Durant’s teammate for nine seasons in Seattle and Oklahoma City, says he and others stayed on him about it constantly. “The funny thing is, I know it’s not the shoes, because I wore the KDs for years, laced them up tight, and literally never had a problem with them,” says Collison, who recently announced his retirement. “But we were constantly telling him to tie his shoes. All the time.”"
"Don’t hate me Sonics fans, I really hope Seattle gets a team but I’m going to include their players because we “technically” still own their history.  Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Gary Payton, Ray Allen  Honorable Mentions: Paul George, Jack Sikma, Shawn Kemp"
"What about the rest of us who are just basketball fans, and don't get completely lost in the idolization of celebrities and athletes, and who recognize that Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Giannis might just be better right now?   If you spend a lot of time on social media complaining about Lebron, or praising Lebron for everything he does, then you're no longer a fan, you're a cult member. Please get back to a healthy lifestyle and realise that you are allowed to criticise Lebron without being a ""hater"". Likewise you're allowed to like Lebron without being a ""bronsexual"". It's a shame how basketball discourse is literally ran by 14 year olds on reddit and twitter, but that's the way things have become. "

"Kevin Durant over Moses Malone on all PPG team.    Edit: sorry just saw it now that it was 2 guards, forwards and 1 center. "
Kevin Durant is way better now. Actually plays defense and is a better scorer. Not to mention he destroyed LeBron in the past two finals
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kevin Durant (at least in terms of shooting percentage) all come to mind"
There are tens of thousands of Durant-stans. Their name is Kevin. 
Not sure how is argument for number 2 actually will stack up when we’re removed from this era.  Against his contemporaries:  * 1-2 against Tim Duncan * 1-2 against Kevin Durant * 1-3 against Stephen Curry * 0-1 against Dirk Nowitzki   Less championships than Duncan and most likely Curry. 
I honestly don’t think Kevin Durant will ever be considered the best player in the world because Lebron doesn’t seem to be slowing down soon and in 2 or 3 years if he really is better than bron  which is likely then Giannis or AD will have passed him by then . 
"If JR doesn't make that mistake, the chances of the Cavs getting swept are much lower. LeBron was in God mode. Again, JR is not the reason they lost the series, but he is the reason they lost a game. He did something worse than making a mistake. He did nothing. He lost them a game, so therefore his mistake is why they got swept. He threw away their only reasonable chance at winning. LeBrons anger at JR caused him to break his hand. The momentum from game 1 carried into game 2 where Kevin Durant turned into an absolute machine and didn't let up for the rest of the series. The Cavs had the perfect storm of mediocre Warriors performances and one of LeBrons best performances ever. JR's indecision and lack of awareness is the one thing that is the most avoidable thing that prevented the Cavs from winning 1 game. Hell, had he made a better play, the Cavs might have still lost, but LeBron would not have played the rest of the series injured. JR managed to lose a game by doing nothing and neutered his leader for the rest of the series. We can talk about defensive schemes, adjustments, LeBrons exhaustion from the regular season, and talent level, but the Cavs played game 1 damn near perfectly and JR Smith made a mistake that had lasting impact for the whole series. "
Kevin Durant
chris paul  westbrook &amp; harden  this “steph is better than KD” shit really has y’all sleep on how cold kevin durant still is. don’t get it confused.   
 KEVIN DURANT BEST PLAYER IN TGE WORLD 
"Giannis is the best player in the league right now &amp; will likely have that title for the next 5-8 years. Kevin Durant is 1B &amp; sustaining his success.   Lebron is still right there too, even though he is playing down right now and his team sucks - but, his success has not been sustained. Hope he isn't on the decline, its too early to tell."
For all the posts that say that he is just coasting or if he makes the playoffs he will turn it on. Even if he does  make it he will need a closer just like always ie a wade or Kyrie which he doesn’t have and I feel like not making the playoffs is what he wants to blame the team. Kevin Durant was right it’s too toxic to play with him. He knew what he was getting into with the young guys when he signed up for the lakers. To act this now is unprofessional. 
"Uhh i didn't even all he does is chuck 3s. Its just hard for me to personally call him better than Kevin Durant when hes taking 10 3s a game, and shooting 2s at 49% compared to Durant whos at 57%  I'd trust KD more to get me 30 than PG. Its close, but i'm just saying i'll take KD. "

He has been transformative for the Mavs present and future and I give the Mavs major kudo's for recognizing his insane potential and clearing out the older starting guys in the locker room as well as DSJ, in order to give full rein to Luka so that he can continue to learn and grow in this season so as to be even more prepared for our epic 2019-2020 season!  Projected Starters for Sept 2019: Luka Doncic, Tim Hardaway Jr., Maxi Kleber, Kristaps Porzingis, Demarcus Cousins?   Mavs have the cap space to pick up a major free agent this summer.... is the allure of Luka and KP enough to generate the attention of a true max player like Kevin Durant? The idea of a KP, Luka, Durant trio is scary as hell and would in my mind, immediately be a contender. I'm probably just dreaming.... But if Knicks fans get to dream of a KD, Kyrie, Zion trio then I, as a committed Mavs fan, get to dream of Luka, KP, and Durant steamrolling the rest of the league. "
Kevin Durant and Draymond Green enjoy a brief rest before the gruel of the playoffs begins.
Kevin Durant and Draymond Green enjoy a brief rest before the gruel of the playoffs.
"It's obvious that a 34 year old veteran with more mileage on his body than anyone in the sport, coming off an injury, in the middle of a throw-away season is attempting to conserve energy on the defensive end because of the load he carries offensively. And even so, his defensive rating is better than people like Kevin Durant and Marcus Smart, who are incessantly praised for their defense.  LeBron James is not the most elite defender in the game and nobody is claiming that. Yet, people will have you think he's the worst. My comment is not in reference to constructive critique, but all the LeBuM TrOlL narratives being spewed here daily, by foolish ""haters"". "
"You were ranting yesterday about how anyone who doesn't already see Durant as top 10 all time is a pathetic loser. Let it go, Kevin. Let it go."
Kevin Durant is probably next 
"I don't know anyone who hates him, but he hasn't lived up to all the hype (remember just this summer he was untouchable for Kawhi).  But that's not his fault, it's not like he announced to the world I'm the next Kevin Durant."
"Lebron clearly still has the best legacy in the NBA right now, but Kevin Durant is the best player at this moment. He plays better defense, is comparable/slightly better on offense, has almost as many personal accolades and is still in his prime."
"Plot Twist, Kevin Durant goes to the Kings and they Become the dark horse that rides everyone to hell."
"Draymond also has Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and DeMarcus Cousins on his team. 3 of those are some of the best shooters in the league.   Percentages can also be misleading about a player's skill. You'd consider Kyle Kuzma a shooter, right? But he's also shooting 31% from 3, so you should leave him open because he's trash at shooting the 3, right? No, he shoots a ton of 3s a game, so you come out on that. Bruno obviously isn't Kuzma, but he's not a player you just ignore on offense like LeBron did."
Kevin Durant 
"Because 1 year and the regular season does not crown you as the best player in the world? Playing at a higher level for a year(s), does not make you better.  &amp;#x200B;  There have been multiple seasons where other players were playing better than LeBron, but he was still labelled the best because of previous success.   &amp;#x200B;  E.g. Kevin Durant MVP year, steph curry's 2xmvp years, RW mvp year etc etc. All these players were playing A LOT  better than Lebron but he was still crowned the best as he had RINGS and MVPS beforehand.   &amp;#x200B;  Sure Giannis is playing a higher level currently, but durant can turn on switch and average high numbers, but it's not required. To be labelled the best, you need playoff success, that's why durant is the best. Lebron is declining and so KD has stepped in. When Durant declines, it will be giannis, AD, harden or whoever has the most playoff success.  &amp;#x200B;  If you have a must win game, are you really picking anyone else in the league except KD? "
Kevin Durant?
"yeah, what a shit performance against the 73-win team that added Kevin Durant. Harden should have put up 50/10/10 that series. "
"Nah I think somehow the Warriors will get him. Next year their starting lineup will be Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Clone of Kevin Durant, Zion, Anthony Davis, Extra Clone of Durant for good measure. NBA doesnt have enough power to stop them from playing 7 players at once. "
“When steph curry put that pole down and they did the team huddle it was the moment Kevin Durant first saw himself in a Knicks jersey” - stephen A or Max 
I mean Kevin Durant added to the Pelicans would get AD to rescind his trade request.....
Kevin Durant is the American Bruno Caboclo
Kevin Durant is the best player in the league.
"Kevin ""Bruno Caboclo"" Durant"
KD with the most stacked team in NBA history outplayed him going 5 vs 1 against him with 4 all stars. Okay buddy. Kevin Durant will never be respected on the warriors.
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant choked a 3-1 lead in the Western Conference Finals then joined the team he lost to. 100% bitch made
OKC AND Kevin Durant flair saying this.. the joke writes itself
"Brandon ""Kevin ""BI"" Durant"" Ingram"
"Pretty sure this is it, if my memory serves correct.   * 1. Greg Oden * 2. Anthony Davis * 3. Kevin Durant * 4. Blake Griffin * 5. Andrew Wiggins * 6. Karl-Anthony Towns * 7. Ben Simmons * 8. John Wall * 9. Kyrie Irving * 10. Luka Doncic"
LeBron James DRTG is 105.6 this year.  Kawhi Leonard has 108.3  Kevin Durant has 107.3  Draymond Green has 105.3  Paul George has 102.4  So this doesn't really seem to pan.

"Another player? How dare you, that’s mr Kevin Durant to you sir "
Never forget Portland drafted gregg oden instead of Kevin Durant 😂
"Knicks. Mudiay is Curry, Ntilikina is Klay, Robinson is Draymond, and Knox is Igoudala. Then Kevin Durant will join. "
"Hmm, I don't. Steph Curry. Kevin Durant? LeBron James? Idk. You name them."
"No. That’s why I will admit here and now that this account is one of 35 operates by me, Kevin durant"
Because Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team and after winning 2 easy championships they added Boogie Cousins. 
I came here for a shitpost about Kevin Durant
"1/8th of his blocks are threes as well, never been a player who blocked threes at this rate.   Also ranked just behind Kevin Durant in WS/48, above LeBron. Obviously that doesn't make him literally better than LeBron, but it also makes him literally better than LeBron."
"I know what the stats are lmao. So Embiid can't create his own offense? AD can't create his own offense? Giannis can't create his own offense? Kevin fucking Durant can't create his own offense?   &gt; The stats are readily available a lot of his shots are assisted.  The stats are readily available, guess none of those guys can create for themselves and be the number 1 on a team."
Kevin Durant is better than Lebron James right now 
Bro imagine not being excited when your FO tells you they're going to go hard after Kevin Durant. He was upset that he wouldn't be the face of the franchise anymore
"Just to put things into perspective, Mo Bamba came into the league weighing about as much as Kevin Durant did when he was drafted. He simply does not have an NBA ready body right now."
"No. The greatest Knicks moment was when we heard Kevin Durant, Kyrie, and AD want to play here."
“And the Oscar goes to Kevin Durant for appearing for the Knicks” 
"Maybe some nets gear too while you’re there :).  Enjoy! There are also some club seats that you can get. Calvin Klein club , Honda club. I’ve only sat in the Calvin Klein club but I paid $100 which included good seats and unlimited buffet, plus I got to stand by the tunnel to the locker room to shout out the players a bit.    I’ve had so many great experiences at Barclays. I gave Kevin Durant a high five. I had the team laughing at my Avery Johnson impression. Anyway , enjoy ! I will likely be watching the game at home "
Kevin Durant gotta like what he sees tonight
"Let Chris Paul defeat the Warriors in playoff first before opening his fucking mouth. Coulda, shouda started by Coach Mike Anthony first. Iguodala was merely responding. Playoff Iguodala will eat him and Harden alive like last year.  Even in the last match Warriors were not serious. Kerr did not call time out despite going 0-15. Kevin Durant did not enter the game in fourth quarter until 5 minutes left. "
"The point with Kerr is that he would not improve the current Knick's situation one iota, which is to say, he is not a good coach.  Kerr did not turn the Warriors into anything. They simply hit their prime at the same time. The person who did the hard work of turning the Warriors into what they are was Mark Jackson. You could have put a Corgi there in 2015 and they would have won just as many games and won just as many championships.  What is shameful is that Kerr somehow still managed to lose 2 games against LeBron by himself in 2015 and also... managed to blow a 3-1 lead in 2016. Yet you give him a pass for those failures. He still needed to get KEVIN DURANT to barely eke out a victory against an injured Rockets team in 7 games last season. What a great coach! 4+ all-stars and he still manages to not have the best record in the NBA this season. A GOOD coach would have the Warriors 10+ games ahead because no other team has 2 FUCKING MVP'S!"
Uh..yeah. Turns out in the postseason your competition increases exponentially. A better isolation scorer than Kevin Durant needs to do better than 18ppg on 47 YS%. Do you not agree? That’s pathetic.
How many games would we win if we just added Kevin Durant?   Would it be the same as the lakers and their struggles after adding lebron? 
"‘11 Rondo  ‘16 Thompson  ‘12 Durant  ‘07 Nowitzki  ‘17 Horford   Rondo as the primary facilitator on the offense with Kevin Durant being the focal point, and three other great talents who can shoot. Every play will be Rondo either kicking it in for the bigger three guys to take the drive or kicking it out to hit the open three. The lineup is kinda small but the spacing advantage for the offense will be impressive.   KG and Hakeem are great but will not be able to mitigate the 3. To answer all the threes your offense will have to run through curry which means no ISO-Kobe drawing away four defenders, and Bird is slightly marginalized without being the primary ball handler. Yes KG and Hakeem will kill my team on the boards but they won’t have to be guarded at the line so my boys can double Curry, Kobe, or Bird off the fastbreak.    It will turn into a numbers game where you are betting on Curry hitting more threes then four of my guys combined, with Curry being smothered more often than the four on my team. Yes Curry has the range and accuracy advantage but in what is essentially a four on one shooting contest, the four will win.   In fact I think my guys could win in 5 or maybe 6.  Just an idea for average stats assuming all guys playing 48 minutes:   Curry - 41/2/4  Bryant -  25/4/5  Bird - 29/7/6  Garnett - 18/22/9  Hakeem - 15/27/10  Team total: 128/62/34   Rondo: 11/7/25  Thompson: 32/4/5  Durant: 40/6/8  Nowitzki: 29/9/8  Horford: 25/6/3  Team total: 137/32/49 "
Kevin Durant ??? He averaged 32/7/6 in KLove’s best season and was the runaway mvp lol. There is no argument to be made for Minnesota Love over KD
Kevin Durant 
"3 per game isn't that low, and 40% is pretty crazy for a rookie. Kevin Durant shot 29% on under 3 attempts in his rookie year..."
Kevin Durant becomes first player ever to win 4 consecutive Finals MVP
"""hold him for kevin [durant]"""
What can adam silver do when Kevin Durant is a bitch😂 
Kevin Durant has a better resume than Curry. 2x FMVP 1 MVP 2x NBA champion and 8x All nba
"It's Steph for me.    Golden State is the one team that has stood in his way of dominating the finals the last few years with that Cleveland team.  Steph Curry was the back to back MVP that is the spearhead of that team.  Without Steph Curry, there is no Kevin Durant going to GS, etc.    Plus I think it's said without being said that LeBron doesn't really like Steph, neither do Chris Paul or Westbrook and maybe one other player from a big Warriors book I saw.  "
"&gt;Philly fans hate him  That doesn't change his shooting stats.  &gt;and he's 36.2% at 0.7 3p made at 1.9 attempts. Seriously Maginka or anyone from analytics is stupid to think he's going to stretch the floor with that stat.  You're leaving out the important context that he is a bench player that has averaged under 15 minutes a game.    Kuzma and Ingram have similar season per game rebounding numbers  to Tyson Chandler, but per 36 minutes played he gets twice as many.  The last two years Muscala has attempted threes at a higher rate than even Kevin Durant.     Career 3 pt attempts per 36 minutes   Porzingis = 4.9  Muscala = 4.3  Embiid = 4.2  Nowitzki = 3.6  Towns = 3.2  Anthony Davis = 1.3  So when on the court, Muscala is literally one of the highest volume three point shooting big men of all time.  That plus 36.2% made easily looks on paper like something capable of helping to stretch defenses.  "
OP said it’s legit to rank Bill Russell ahead of Kevin Durant.  
"The Hawks new front office has been INCREDIBLY competent with their draft picks between ""the Traed"", and picking up both Collins &amp; Huerter at 19.

"Kevin Durant, kinda at least"
if we're being completely honest: Kevin Durant
Kevin durant does it all the time too.
Its like if Kevin Durant were an owner.

Ok just look at Kevin Garnett dragging the twolves every year to the playoffs.  Steve Nash taking garbage suns team.  Russ in okc after Durant left. Olujuwon for years had shit around him. 
Kevin Durant was overheard in the shower telling Kyrie that  “They feel like two bags of sand”.
Well they didn’t have Kevin Durant so just leave HB open if you’re the Cavs 
Where is Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant?
"Look at what the poster above you said when Capela got hurt they brought in Nene and Faried and got similar production from the two of them, it's a good point. Not trying to make you feel bad or anything but you're in serious denial if you think to take is an all-time low. So what if they constantly praise him? Their words aren't gospel and they do not have any more access to game footage then other fans do. All the footage, video evidence, advanced stat databases, etc, is out there to the general public. I also recall Zach Lowe once calling Jonathan Isaac the next Kevin Durant during lead-up to last years draft. I've read countless of takes from all of those guys, which didn't end up going as they planned. At the end of the day whatever happens on the court is determined by the players and the only analysis that truly matters is based on that, not these guys opinions on who they want to praise and constantly shower with compliments. Adams is considered a great teammate, a funny guy and very media friendly. The media loves him, of course, they talk excellently about him. Why would any of those guys randomly just come out with an article right now about Steven Adams being overpaid? Its a completely out-of-the-blue comment for one of those guys to randomly insert into an article, especially considering that the Thunder have a good record and there's no turmoil or anything between them that would spark a comment like that. But that doesn't mean he's not massively overpaid... he is being paid like a max player, but he is not an overly special or more importantly ""unique"" player, he has a very common skill set, which, production wise could be likely be matched with much less-regarded or well-known players, especially if they're playing with 2+ elite offensive players. "
You think he’s better than Kevin Durant? Offensively he can score every where and one crossover gets defenders stupidly outta position. And you’re gonna have a harder time blocking his shot then hardens. I dunno. Harden carries an extreme load tho but ion know
"I need you to sign off on this contract stating that you will not bandwagon back to them in the event that they receive Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, or Kevin Durant. "
Yes and here is why I believe that  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/04/draymond-green-kevin-durant-warriors-nba-free-agency-thunder  https://newsok.com/article/5508043/draymond-green-recruited-kevin-durant-throughout-the-season  
Kevin Durant
"A little bit. And if Kevin Durant goes to the Knicks (with Kyrie), the East may actually be stronger for the first time in quite a while. "
Can’t please NBA fans. Kevin Durant sucks because he picked a good team; LeBron sucks because he picked a bad team.
"Kevin Durant, taking the hardest road to get there."
I wonder if GSW will put Kevin Durant on Harden.
Step 1: Klay Thompson  Step 2: Klay Thompson  *klay gets tired*  Step 3: Kevin Durant
I am also convinced the Kevin Durant is the greatest shooter of all time. 
Kevin Durant
Does Kevin Durant do leg day?
Yeah he just lets Kevin Durant carry while he’s massively underperforming and getting eaten alive in isolations
Kevin Durant in 14  He had a Foot injury 
Giannis will not get all this foul calls when the inside gets crowded in the playoffs and he will be forced to shoot the ball. But to bucks advantage Giannis is the better shooter than Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
"Throwaway account because I'm Kevin Durant, but just stopped by to say, this is completely normal.   All of us NBAers have burners (accounts, phones, chicks, straps etc)"
"Remember when Dwight Howard told the world he was going to evolve into his own version of Kevin Durant?   That’s exactly what Blake has done. He could always ball, but the dude can flat out shoot now. "
[Including Russ! Why does no one remember this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/kevin-durant-forgets-to-use-his-burner-account-again-and-likes-an-instagram-comment-calling-russell-westbrook-the-problem)
"Then why do Lebron's defensive stats portray him as a better defender than both James Harden and Kevin Durant this year, neither of whom have received as much flak for defense this year? For sure he had some terrible defensive games, but I don't think he deserves all the shit he's been getting, especially considering that he's coming of the worst injury of his career on this shitshow of a lakers team."
Kevin Durant will be 3x Finals MVP. Book it
"I think the problem is there's too much talent in the NBA. We look at Anthony Davis, and think he's this generational talent, but he's really not.  Just going down the standings, the list of superstar talent in the league:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Bradley Beal, Kevin Love, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Nikola Jokic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Karl Anthony Towns, Lebron James, and then Anthony Davis way down there in the standings.   When you have a superstar class that big, Anthony Davis is only going to impact winning so much, as there is too much talent in the league.  This doesn't even count all the superstars in training that will be on the come up soon like Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum, and Lauri Markannen, or guys like Kemba, Al Horford, Tobias Harris, Lou Williams, Jrue Holiday, etc. that are also as good of what we traditionally think of all stars.  The league is fucking stacked right now, and it's only getting more talented every year."
That's been done for a while.  [He's 7 feet tall in shoes. ](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/)

I don’t get Kevin Durant. But I kind of get this. 
"See Nick Collision is a great candidate based on the criteria that many want to see. Sure, he didnt put up the numbers that many guys who have had their jersey retired did. So i can see where someone might have an argument against it.   But here is a guy that spent his entire career, which was 15 years, with a single franchise. Including the first 10 years of the team when they moved to Oklahoma City. In fact he was the only constant over that period of time. He played in 65+ games a year most of those years. Universally loved and looked up to, both by players and community. Did a LOT to bridge the gap between team and community.  Even Kevin Durant, arguably the best and most successful player to play for the franchise called him Mr. Thunder.  His leadership and mentoring went a long way.   &amp;#x200B;  Personally, thats exactly the type of player id like to see get their jersey retired.  Not some dude who played with a team for 6 years and put up decent but not amazing numbers. To get your jersey retired in that short of time with a team you need to have done something amazing, like bring home the championship a few of those years or something. "

I think he means kevin durant since we want role players who can shoot time to time
Aaaaaaand the Nets have gone from a bad meme to a good meme. Awesome.  Gonna enjoy this until we lose to them in ECF next year when they bring in Kevin fucking Durant. 
"It seems simple:  Get Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard if you can, because they're the Tier 1 superstars on the market.  Can't get him, go for Kyrie Irving because you know him and Lebron were deadly together in the playoffs.   Can't get him, get Klay Thompson to try to damage the Warriors, granted he's probably already re-signed by this time in the process.  He's gone? Jimmy Butler is the last star left. Go get him, as he could play a good 2nd fiddle to Lebron.   After that? You get Cousins and say Yolo and help he returns to Pelicans/Kings Cousins level.  No matter the scenario, they should also continue to try to trade for Anthony Davis using their assets. "
"I brought in kyrie as an example of someone who is a poor NBA defender but has been seen getting stops on an elite scorer like Kevin Durant. I include him to suggest that your parallel between 5v5 NBA defense and smaller game defense might not hold. Just like I included Paul George in my first comment as an ostensibly ""lesser"" player who actually cooks these dudes 1v1. "
this is fucking joke. you're sitting here comparing harden's roster to steph's. steph's roster is arguably the greatest team in nba history. EVER. i can't believe some of you have the balls to try and make this is an actual discussion.  gtfo my face talking to me about harden's shooters when steph gets to play with klay freaking thompson and kevin freaking durant. jesus.  
"Nope, most iconic is the game winning poster on Kevin Durant in game 7 of the 2019 WCF"
I always took removing Lavar pictures from IG as simply getting rid of BBB logos/association. I've literally never seen Lavar without a BBB hat besides in Cold as Balls with Kevin durant
"Been juggling this for a while... I think I have it (at least one that I think is fair).  **FIRST TEAM**  - Giannis Antetokounmpo (F)  - Paul George (F)  - Joel Embiid (C)  - Stephen Curry (G)  - James Harden (G)  **SECOND TEAM**  - Kevin Durant (F)  - Kawhi Leonard (F)  - Nikola Jokic (C)  - Kyrie Irving (G)  - Damian Lillard (G)  **THIRD TEAM**  - Anthony Davis (C)  - LeBron James (F)  - Karl-Anthony Towns (C)  - Bradley Beal (G)  - Russell Westbrook (G)  In summary: I took Embiid over Jokic, gave Beal the 6th guard, and gave AD the other ""forward"" position. I think that he and KAT deserve it (despite all of the former's issues with the trade deadline)."
Umm Kevin Durant was drafted by Seattle and even played a season there. So ya he should be on Seattle’s all time team. /s
Kevin Durant has to be on the Warriors.
It probably says more about you if since you seem to think Luka Doncic can LOCK up Kevin Durant...lmao
"bud can coach but its up to the players to execute. bud isn't dropping 27/12/6 with DPOY defense every night. this isn't a steph curry - kevin durant situation where both are eligible and good enough to win MVP that they cancel each other out. bud winning COTY does not mean giannis shouldn't win MVP or vice versa. if that were the case, give d'antoni both of steve nash's MVPs"
And Kevin Durant is 3rd. And Durant has 2 Finals MVP’s. Curry has been great in the playoffs. But you can’t deny Curry and the Warriors probably owe their last 2 titles to Durant.

Hey man how do you get the gsw kevin Durant thing after your username? What’s that all about? I’d like to have okay Thompson if I could figure out how to do it 
"Kevin Durant gets owned in this lmao... 4th best of thunder org? I guess, Shawn kemp honestly wasn't really as great as Durant talent wise, id probably slide him up above... Guess I understand decision to have Westbrook above him since he left but for real Durant is just better than Westbrook full stop."
"At first I thought ""Well maybe their methodology is heavily skewed towards the team that drafted them and how many years they spent with a franchise."" But he has Shaq as a Laker (and Orlando, both), which isn't consistent with that type of ranking.  As much as I love him, Chris Mullin should not be on this list over KD. He's not a better player, he did not do more for the franchise. He may be more likable, easier to understand, but he's not a greater player nor was he greater for the franchise than Kevin Durant. "
"&gt; But if Kevin Durant couldn’t carry a decent team anywhere in the tournament  college KD couldnt carry his team anythere. Current KD? Can carry anybody to the NCAA final four and win it.  Also, *prove me KD's team in college was a decent team*. Literally, how many of the roster actually made it to the pros? How many made a career playing in the NBA or at least in Europe?  Because, quite frankly, you are using the term ""decent"" pretty lightly here when you talk about NCAA teams.  "
"No I’m really not.  You all are overrating it because it’s your inscrutable argument, you can just say that and assume it’s always 100% true, because I can’t prove to you that’s it’s not.  Of course guys improve. But if Kevin Durant couldn’t carry a decent team anywhere in the tournament, the idea any decent nba player can carry a 16 seed far in the tournament is just stupid "
"Lol you have no idea what you are talking about.  You started this discussion by comparing Luka winning the euro title, when Luka played with the best roster in Europe.  The whole point is your teammates would suck.  Nba players couldn’t impact a game single handily the way you think they could, if their teammates are absolute shit.  Kevin Durant was nba ready a star player we have ever seen in college, and he couldn’t take a roster with nba talent on it past the first round.  College teams would play gimmicky defenses against this hypothetical situation and you would be depending on really bad college players to hit open shots in 6 consecutive games.  "
"And your opinion means absolutely nothing.  Kevin Durant was about as good a college player we have seen, and was totally nba ready.  His team lost in the first round.  Would you say in 2007-2008 he was a top 50 player? I would, easily.  He would have had zero shot of taking a 16 seed to a championship. "
"Yeah Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Al Horford as opposed to Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green. Tomayto tomahto "
"Kevin Martin was a multiple time 20ppg scorer on some average Rockets teams &amp; seemed like the perfect 4th wheel to Durant, Westbrook &amp; Ibaka. It’s ridiculous to say that the Adams pick was the only thing of value. "
When I said by himself I mean that Larry turned the Celtics from a good playoff team to the best team in the league   Kevin Durant turned the Warriors from the best team in the league to... the best team in the league.
You don't think a team with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant would be better than the Nets? Come on bro use your head
Kevin Durant 
Best one Ive seen here. This would be mine   Chris Paul: 15.7  Marcus Smart: 8.6  Andre Iguodala: 5.8  Kevin Durant: 27.0  Brook Lopez: 12.5 
PG: Kyle Lowry 14.8 ppg  SG: Marcus Smart - 8.6 ppg  SF: Kevin Durant - 27.0 ppg  PF: Draymond Green - 7.0 ppg  C: Brook Lopez - 12.5 ppg  &amp;#x200B;  69.9  &amp;#x200B;  This lineup would be crazy good. Incredible defense 1-5 along with excellent spacing outside of Draymond. Has the star power in KD needed to go far in this league along with a proper supporting cast including a good number 2 option in Lowry. The team can pass the ball very well and in crunch time can go to KD to get buckets. I'm very confident this is one of the best teams you could build with these restrictions.
So Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
"Wtf y’all have Kevin Durant and in just the past handful of games I remember him shooting 6, 9, and 11 shots. Good lord please leave so we can watch all these dudes  play at their highest level every night"
The disrespect to ADs [double-fuckin-clutch GW in OKC over Kevin durant](https://youtu.be/kmar9bLehVY)
"Kevin ""13 pts on 6 shots"" Durant might want to be a little more aggressive today."
&gt; Kevin Durant is the best offensive player  not even close
PG: Steph Curry SG: Chris Mullin or Klay Thompson SF: Rick Barry or Draymond Green PF: Kevin Durant C: Wilt Chamberlain
"Okay, let's see. I am a HUGE fan of Zion and believe he will be a perennial all-star in the NBA. But he has yet to play in an NBA game. (This list is going off of RIGHT NOW. Not potential. This isn't a trade value list. If it was, he'd be a top 10 asset. This is strictly who is the better basketball player in 2018-2019.)  This year (2018-2019) he wouldn't be better than:      Lebron, Durant, Curry, Harden, Giannis, Davis, Kawhi, Embiid, Paul George, Westbrook, Lillard, Kyrie, Jokic, Karl Anthony Towns, Gobert, Beal, Oladipo, Blake Griffin, DeRozan, Aldridge, Mitchell, Doncic, Klay, Chris Paul, Butler, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Kemba, Booker, Ayton, Mike Conley, Fox, Lowry, John Wall, Zach LaVine, John Collins, D'Angelo Russell, and Nikola Vucevic.  That is 38. Then you have guys averaging nice numbers and winning in the NBA: Porzingis, Nurkic, Draymond, Ingram, Cousins, Capela, Jamal Murray, McCollum, Horford, Markennen, Bagley, Sabonis, Tatum, Markennen, Middleton, Kevin Love, and Trae Young.      He's probably in the 30-55 range.  Again, I think it's possible. I am going based off of 2018-2019. NOT the future. It is definitely a conversation. I could see him averaging like 20/8/4 next year."
"Steph Curry, Chris Mullin, Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Wilt Chamberlain"
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Rick Barry  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Wilt Chamberlain
C    Serge Ibaka PF  Kevin Durant SF  Paul George SG James Harden PG Russell Westbrook 
"What's their record when Kevin Durant plays? Oh right, he's not hurt all the time like Curry."
"This is a cop out answer. MJ never even came close to playing a team assembled like the Warriors. I don't care how transcendent MJ was, when you have the best shooter of all time, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant, you can only do so much individually."
Kevin Durant is potentially the most versatile scorer in history. Curry has the best shot of all time but there is no answer for a 7’ tall sharpshooter that has decent handles and can drive.   That’s not even taking in to account the differences in defense. Curry is the motor of the team but KD has a larger toolkit to work with. 
"Or, all of those seasons are historic in some way or another. That’s why all those guys won MVP. When you’re looking at six different stats, as you apparently want to do, chances are the best player (or couple of players) in any given year will have a unique combination of them. Unless you’re using the term “historic” to mean “literally the best box score of all time”, I don’t really see why Kevin Durant having historic volume and efficiency in 2014 precludes Giannis from having a completely different type of historic stat line five years later.  But hey, if we’re talking about “relevant stats”, let’s talk about minutes per game. That seems pretty relevant, right? Maybe even the most relevant, the more minutes you play the more all of your other stats except TS% are going to go up. Wonder who’s matching up to Giannis there."
Or Kevin Durant &gt; Larry Bird
"Kevin Durant is the best offensive player, and I’m saying Giannis is more valuable because he’s a 2 way player instead of a 1 way player. He does everything on the court making him more valuable."
Should Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant join the Jason Kid Lakers?
"1/5- Jealousy?  Hell no.  If KD had gone to Miami or Boston, he wouldn't have gotten nearly the flak that he did.  And it's not like KD is getting only flak from other fanbases.  I'm a neutral fan and think what he did was weak.  I have a friend who's a Warriors fan and calls KD a ""pussy ass bitch"".    &amp;nbsp;  2 - Did you not read what I wrote after that. Those are the similarities that exist between KD and Average Joe's job.  I mentioned a few differences after that.  Here are a few other differences out of countless others, if you need: Average Joe worries about his paycheck, while KD is getting a max and more than enough for a lifetime.  Average Joe applies to get a job, while nba teams apply to get KD.  Average Joe needs to adapt to wherever he goes, while nba teams will adapt and build around KD.  Average Joe won't have a legacy related to his job that's heavily debated over, while KD will.    &amp;nbsp;  3/4: You really think KD would have left if he had won a championship with OKC?  Also, KD has said multiple times both [publicly](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kevin-durant-addresses-reports-that-he-left-okc-because-of-russell-westbrook) and [by ""burner""](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets).  OKC's front office did blunder by trading away Harden, but they were far from incompetent.  They built a team that was up 3-1 in the WCF.  KD on his ""burner"" wants to blame the team outside of Russ, but KD was the one who laid eggs in Games 5 and 6.  "
"If Kevin Love was in that finals I honestly think we wouldn't have the Warriors dynasty today. Warriors loose because the Cavs 2nd best scorer wasn't Mosgov, Warriors come back next season with a 73-9 record and loose again which leads to Durant going to another team and warriors blowing it up."
Kevin Durant and if you asked me again in 5 years same answer durant's shooting and height advantage doesn't change with age worse case he becomes Dirk when hes old?
"""elite"" https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/video/kevin-durant-makes-mockery-james-hardens-defense-dunk"
&gt;James Harden - 0 rings. (Staying put) &gt; &gt;Kevin Durant - 2 rings. (And counting)  &gt; &gt;Steph Curry - 3 rings. (And counting)  &gt; &gt;LeBron James - 3 rings. (??) &gt; &gt;Russell Westbrook - 0 rings. (??) 
Best fit? No. I think Kevin durant would fit better. 
"It actually is a real quote and I’m from China. Because Chinese translate English names following its pronunciation. Kevin will be 凯文, Durant is 杜兰特, so Kevin Durant is 凯文杜兰特"

"Is that a real quote? OP wrote the first name first, but in Mandarin you use the last name first, so I'd think Zhou Qi would do that (or just say Kevin Durant)  My Chinese name is 杜凯石, but the first character is for my last name. KD's Chinese name would be 杜凯文, not 凯文杜  I only noticed because KD and I have two characters in common"
Another great article by him Kevin Durant wants to attend Nick Collison Night but is only trying to boost his own image  https://newsok.com/article/5621425/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-wants-to-attend-nick-collison-night-but-is-only-trying-to-boost-his-own-image?earlyAccess=true
"They're always Berry I'm pretty sure lol.  Same guy who wrote Mr Unreliable and asked Adams to throw teammates under the bus in 2017.  He gets crap now but he brought it on himself.  There was a story in SI a while ago about Westbrook giving a baby carriage to their sideline reporter even.  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant  &gt;Westbrook will never be a garrulous speaker, but he respected McCaslin’s candor. During the playoffs last spring McCaslin was pregnant, and Westbrook pestered her about when she was starting maternity leave. She didn’t understand why he was so interested. Finally, after a flight from San Antonio to Oklahoma City, Westbrook led McCaslin through the airport parking lot and popped the trunk of his car. Inside was a Maclaren stroller. “He’s more human than people would ever think,” McCaslin says. “He just doesn’t want you to know that.” When McCaslin thanked Nina for picking out the stroller, soon to be occupied by baby Hunter, Westbrook’s wife laughed. “That wasn’t me,” she said. “That was all Russell.”  He treats most of them normally.  Tramel is the boy crying wolf now."
You suuuuuuuure Zhou Qi said....Kevin Durant is a snake?
"""Kevin Durant is a snake."""
"At age 25 Kevin Durant was an MVP, a five-time All Star, four-time scoring champion, five time member of the All NBA First Team.  He had not won a championship, but he had made it the the playoffs five times with two losses in the WCF and one in the Finals."
Idk if anyone has said this but the Zhou Qi one says : Kevin Durant is a snake
"""Scarlett johanneson I will drink ur bath water...#random"" - Kevin Durant"
&gt; 1 million  And 800k of them are Kevin Durant burners
It was amazing. Fuck Kevin Durant for ruining what could have been a true rivalry.
"Kevin Durant, as a tulip"
Not when you have 4 all stars on a BASKETBALL TEAM !! Do you even follow other sports ?? It’s nearly impossible for them to loose ... so yeah if Kevin Durant didn’t join an already impressive championship caliber team then I would be more impressed... the pistons in 2004 impressive !!! Dallas in 2011 impressive !! Hell even golden state in 2015 was impressive.. otherwise your just stacking n all star team against a sub all star team .. as well your a warriors fan so I wouldn’t expect you to understand... your head is in the clouds and I bet your only a warriors fan cause they hot .. just some loser bandwagoner with no life ... get off the couch fatso !!  
"Kevin Durant closing the 3rd and 4th quarters in that game was absolutely ridiculous. Shame we lost, but I remember thinking in the 1st that it would be a blowout."
Hahaha “Kevin Durant is a snake” 
"Here is every university to produce at least one MVP:  |School|MVP(s)| :--|:--| |Arizona State|James Harden| |Auburn|Charles Barkley| |Cincinnati|Oscar Robertson| |Davidson|Stephen Curry (2)| |Georgetown|Allen Iverson| |Grambling State|Willis Reed| |Holy Cross|Bob Cousy| |Houston|Hakeem Olajuwon| |Indiana State|Larry Bird (3)| |Kansas|Wilt Chamberlain (4)| |Louisiana Tech|Karl Malone (2)| |Louisville|Wes Unseld| |LSU|Shaquille O'Neal, Bob Pettit (2)| |Memphis|Derrick Rose| |Michigan State|Magic Johnson (3)| |Navy|David Robinson| |North Carolina|Michael Jordan (5), Bob McAdoo| |San Francisco|Bill Russell (5)| |Santa Clara|Steve Nash (2)| |Texas|Kevin Durant| |UCLA|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6), Bill Walton, Russell Westbrook| |UMass|Julius Erving| |Wake Forest|Tim Duncan (2)| "
"That doesn't make much sense.  That's like saying Kevin Durant would have replaced Lebron James.  With two players with relatively equal talent, the one with more experience is almost always going to be better."
"Based on articles I've read and my own recollections at the time of the draft:  *Tier I:* - ""I wouldn't be surprised if he's a hall of famer""  Anthony Davis - Projected to be a defensive beast from day 1 with massive alien arms and smarts, with the potential to be an offensive star with speed, leaping ability, great handles for a big man, and a nice looking jumpshot for a big man honed when he was still projected to be a guard before his extra growth spurt late in high school. He was the projected top pick early in the spring even before winning the national title and playing amazing down the stretch in the tournament.  Greg Oden - Projected to be a dominating two-way 7 footer, performed well in the NCAA tournament too despite a hand injury. Injuries suck but his advanced stats were quite good on both offense and defense in his limited minutes before his first mini-retirement after his third year. Some people were comparing him to Tim Duncan before the draft to give you an idea of how talented he was :(  Kevin Durant - Many people had him as an equal overall or only slightly worse prospect to Oden, obviously in most drafts he'd be the first overall pick. He put up dominating numbers in his only year under Rick Barnes even though they didn't get very far in the tournament.   *Tier 2* - Truly elite athletes who will have a knack for scoring on day 1  Zion -  Awesome speed for his ridiculous size. 6'11 wingspan with his leaping ability absolutely should be a great defender, although probably won't be a dominant rim protector. And his offense improved a ton through the year, his passing improved, shooting progressed, and his face up ability is outstanding for a college player. Just a really strong two-way prospect with superstar potential.   Blake Griffin - Everyone knew he had great pick and roll scoring potential (like a young Amare Stoudemire) coming out of college. Good athleticism meant he had the potential to become a good defender, even though he never quite got there. Some of his other skills like passing and jumpshooting he only developed after he was in the league a few years.  *Tier 3*  John Wall - Great season for Wall, showed ability to get to the rim at will, pass, and play defense, ran the offense of the second best team in the country that year during the regular season.   Derrick Rose - There was just enough of whispers by a few people that the Bulls should consider taking Michael Beasely that I put Wall ahead of him (thankfully they didn't take Beasley). But it was a pretty big debate whether Wall was better than Rose when Wall was a freshman.   Kyrie Irving - Missed most of his freshman year but showed enough polish that he was the best player on a Duke team that returned most of its starters from a title-winning team.  Andrew Wiggins - There was a point in time where Wiggins looked like a tier 1 prospect especially before his freshman year started, but his freshman year was actually a bit underwhelming at Kansas. He didn't come out and become a 20-25 point per game scorer like a lot of people expected, he couldn't get to the rim at will like some people expected, his three point shot looked good but his percentage was not great, etc. Obviously he was a good player, but still, you could watch entire Kansas games on mute and not realize that he was supposed to be the Maple Jordan. He was overshadowed a bit by Joel Embiid and was actually passed at one point in mock drafts by him before Embiid's injury. Still showed enough defensive skill along with his obvious fluidity that he became number 1 pick... but no longer had the hype by that point and was included in a package for Kevin Love after the draft.  *Tier 4*  Karl Towns - Strangely enough a lot of people thought he was more of a defensive prospect than an offensive one. Maybe it was because he was a mobile 7 footer. But nobody expected him to come out and be an offensive superstar his rookie year. But people also didn't think it would take him five years to become a decent defender like he had. It actually wasn't until roughly Jaunary of his college season that he passed Jahlil Okafor in most pre-draft rankings.   Ben Simmons - This was pretty recent, great prospect but had questions about his jumpshot and some questioned why his team performed so poorly during college.  Jabari Parker - was supposed to be the next Carmelo, his three-point shooting never quite came around and his torn ACL interrupted the best stretch of his career sadly. Still is going to be in the league a long time  Joel Embiid - would have been all the way up in tier 2 if it wasn't for his pre-draft injury. He showed more pro promise than Wiggins in their year at Kansas and was reportedly dominating team workouts to the point where he was briefly featured at number 1 overall in that stacked draft... but then the pre-draft injury knocked him down below Parker. People were scared (understandably so) about taking a 250 foot 7-plus footer with leg problems so obviously that affects his hype as a prospect and on this ranking.  *Tier 5*  - Recent guys I don't need to explain  DeAndre Ayton  Luka Doncic  Markelle Fultz  Brandon Ingram  Marvin Bagley"
Kevin Durant has as many FMVPs as Hakeem Olajuwon   LeBron James has more total points than Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant has the most missed shots in NBA history  Shaq never won an NBA finals game until Kobe made the all-star team  MJ was 1-9 in the playoffs before Pippen got there  Scott Brooks has more COTYs than Brad Stevens  
"&gt;[GSW] Kevin Durant   Okay, bro. Ok... "
"Interesting argument, because their team is SO stacked, it would make sense that none of them become MVPs -- none of them had to rise above the rest to lead... look at how above average single players had made an impact on a team of nobody's -- Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Derek Rose, Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson.

"There's at least one timeline where Kevin Durant gets lippy with a 14 year old Oklahoman and ends up punching him in the face, after the kid screams ""you suck"" in the tunnel.    OKC steals game 4 in double OT.  Loses the series in 5."
"You pretty much tear down the fact as being significant when you report three players have taken 15 of the awards. And truth be told if it wasn't a promotional ploy by the NBA even fewer players would be recognized as NBA MVP's. How many would Lebron have? kevin durant goes to a team that won 72 games and they win far fewer games and he is voted MVP? Um the guy that got cut to make room for durant was ""More valuable""."
The only comparison for Zion is someone who was overwhelmingly the best college player and unquestionably the number one pick who then failed.  The only guy that even comes to mind in recent memory is AD and maybe Kevin Durant (even tho he went no.2)
"Darko definitely received a ton of attention but if I had rank the top 10 draft prospects in my lifetime, I'd probably go  1. Lebron James 2. Tim Duncan 3. Greg Oden 4. Anthony Davis 5. Kevin Durant 6. Derrick Rose 7. John Wall 8. Darko Milicic 9. Carmelo Anthony 10. Andrew Wiggins  With honorable mentions to Blake Griffin, Michael Beasley, Karl Towns, and Kwame Brown. "

"KD initially regretted his move to the Warriors  [Kleiman said a panicked Durant called him early one morning from his hotel room in China.  “I was up at 6 a.m. and he [Durant] calls me and says, ‘Yo, are you up?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, what’s up?’ And he’s like [yelling], ‘Why the f— did you let me do this to my life?’""](http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)"
"[Direct image link](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3ErOtOUgAAgTtj.jpg:large)  Is Kevin Durant the greatest mid-range shooter of all time? His percentages from all distances are insane. Basketball Reference doesn't go far enough for to check out Michael Jordan's splits when he played for Chicago, which is annoying."
Kevin Durant did.
"Draymond got enough problems as it is anyways. They way it looks now, both Steve Kerr and Kevin Durant are more than done with Draymond. Don't think it will be long before KD ups and leaves."
"&gt;  I mean if you can call a a non existent foul on Kevin Durant against Wolves,  You’re comparing situations 6 years apart. The refs in 2013 are probably retired, let alone working that specific game you’re crying about"
He's Kevin Durant and can do what he wants.
"they won 60 in 2013, 59 in 2014 with Russ missing 36 and 55 in 2016 (went 3-7 without KD). They were easily a 60+ win team with both of them relatively healthy even in the post Harden years. But yeah Kevin Durant is pretty damn good at basketball"
Lady’s and gentlemen; Kevin “hardest road” Durant!
"Kevin Durant did not miss a single shot, nice"
So you think Dwayne Wade is better than Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant didn't get far in the tourney either. 
Kevin Durant
unless your name is stephen curry or maybe kevin durant you don’t really have any business taking such a deep shot in such a situation
But when the alternative is Kevin Durant that might not be enough. A couple weeks ago PG was the no-brainer choice. 
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant 
&gt; Why is Kevin Durant still considered better than James Harden  &gt;&gt; KD’s been elite much longer  You’re reading things that weren’t said. This was literally the answer he gave
Kevin Durant: he always does these low passes that are so predictable and they usually gets deflected every time he attempts them 
KD himself said in 2017 that he was record at 6’10 and 3 quarters with no shoes and with shoes on he’s 7 ft. Wish the league would change his official height so 2K would as well lmao.   https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/
"Kevin Durant, in 2k14 blacktop it always said he was 6’9. So I thought that’s how tall he was. "
"&gt;Okogie fucking slapped his ankle in middair. There’s no defending that shit, get the fuck out  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2828794-nbas-l2m-report-refs-were-correct-in-kevin-durant-warriors-loss-to-t-wolves  Get the fuck out?  Sad.  Your judgment is clearly biased.  "
He's also an adequate 3&amp;D wing to guard Kevin Durant and Paul George. His value will show itself in the playoffs.
"Kevin “the hardest road” Durant: “I will be joining the 73-9 Warriors because I want to challenge myself...not for the free ticket to the finals.  Something, something,  let’s go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!”"
Lol regular season stats don’t define Kevin Durant. The number of rings on his fingers do
"Steph Curry, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kobe, Shaq, Giannis??? He shot 30% from three and 41% from 2 cmon. "
Sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving 
&gt;ex-thunder forward kevin durant
"Disclaimer: I love having Kevin Durant.   That being said, the culture seemed significantly better and more positive before we brought him in. When it was just Steph, Klay, and Dray as the core it was awesome, there seemed to be minimal (if any) friction, but now everything just feels a little chippier. I think Kerr is one of the best in the game but going from a young homegrown core of three All Stars, to four, and now five must get difficult to manage. "
"He's apparently buddies with Kevin Durant, so I suspect he sees that happening next year. If DeAndre accepts a discount, he can form a heck of a platoon with Mitchell Robinson at center for KD+Kyrie (hypothetically)"
"""straight up better"" than a team with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Serge Ibaka.. a Thunder team that beat the Spurs in 6 games, a very similar Spurs team that should have beat the Heat in the Finals the following year if it was reffed properly like the videos showed."

"&gt;I wonder if these same people think the Warriors got worse when they replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. They won 6 less games, right?  Sadly, I can guarantee there's people out there that honestly believe that. "
"that's kevin durant loading up for the shot. far be it for fans to slow it down the to the millisecond and screenshot the exact moment the defender even looks like he's making initial contact....yes ofc the referee can see that /s. Watch it in realtime, he was fouled in the act of shooting."
I’m gonna go with Kevin “likes fighting with minors on the internet behind a fake account because he can’t take criticism” Durant 
"I wonder if these same people think the Warriors got worse when they replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. They won 6 less games, right?"
You can’t just say Oden is better than fucking Kevin Durant 
"Often it has to do with the way the offense works and that player's skillset. The prototypical 6th man is a guy, usually a PG/SG combo type, who can come off the bench and be the lead ball handler and be the offense for a bit. When you are setting your lineups, there are diminishing returns to having more ball handlers on your offense, obviously only one guy has the ball at once.   Say you have a team with two stars (let's say they are Dame Lillard and Kevin Durant just for example), Jamal Crawford in his 6th man prime, and the rest of your team are role players (i.e. guys who are gonna shoot and play D at SG/SF, big men who are gonna rebound, block shots, set screens). What is your starting lineup? It makes sense to start Lillard and Durant, those are your two best players. But you need to take them out at some point, so it makes sense to sub them out and have Crawford available to sub in and run the offense while Lillard and KD rest. Yeah, you could have them all start together, but Crawford is gonna be best when he gets to do his thing and look for his shot, and you don't want him doing that when KD and Lillard are better and they are out there. See what I mean?  The other reason someone might be a 6th man instead of a starter is if they have a skillset that allows them to abuse weaker opposing bench players that may not be as effective against the better starters.  Also part of it is some guys straight up *like* coming off the bench in that role. They like being on the ball, coming in and getting to control the action. Or attacking tired defenders.  Lou and the clippers are slightly different in that they don't have a true star and play a very egalitarian offense. But generally that is the theory."
Kevin Durant ends with T  Knicks are shit also ends with T
Traded Patrick Beverley for Kevin Durant. As in the warriors lost the superior player in the ejections
*What if I told you a long enough road may lead you home?*  30 for 30:  Kevin Durant
I'm pretty sure him joining GS actually reduced his perceived value. He joins an insanely successful team without good center backups and he still has a worse impact than either of them. Truly the definition of empty stats when your scoring involves taking away from Steph fucking Curry and Kevin fucking Durant.
"I need serious, truthful answers here.   Was Kevin Durant always a bitch? I obviously used to love him when he played for OKC. But now he acts like an bitch. I don’t remember him acting this way. Is it just my bias goggles that didn’t allow me to see this or did he just turn into a bitch when he jumped ship? Did being on the warriors and winning turn him into the attitude he has now?"
He also takes way too many shots while he's on a team with fucking Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. His defense is also bad and simply not cut out for an elite level playoff team.
"Patrick Beverly vs Kevin Durant  No DQ, no holds barred.   Book it Vince McMahon"
Kevin “the ultimate front runner” Durant letting someone get in his head.  Color me shocked.
Kevin Durant can only talk when he's on the most stacked team in the league lol.
Pat would win but the next day Kevin Durant would be his tag team partner
wtf i love kevin durant now
Biggest bitch in the league. Kevin Durant y’all.
Kevin Durant is the biggest bitch the league has ever seen.  Needed the refs to save his ass before Pat knocked him out.
he has a fucking all star team fucking Kevin durant came ot fucking carry him becaues lebron is his daddy
Kevin Durant would be the most loved player in the NBA if he were playing for a team like the Clippers or Magic.
i hate kevin durant
Kevin Durant ruined this. We used to get to watch Curry do this night in and night out until he came smh
Kevin Durant lives where weed is legal

"&gt; You've all focused this solely  I mean, people can only reply to what you actually write, and what you wrote was actually pretty clear even though you are trying to walk it back now.  It isn't a particularly novel observation that players can ostensibly make more money in major markets by turning down the supermax.  Whether this is actually the case or not (given that, you know, the Hornets are owned by noted sneaker brand namesake Michael Jordan, that Kemba is not actually one of the top 10 or so players in a league where huge endorsement deals are concentrated among the top few players, and he is about to turn 29 and likely to decline soon) is far from clear.  You also ignore differences in tax rates here.  NC has roughly a 5.5% state tax rate and NYC state has about a 13% tax rate (marginal tax rate is roughly average tax rate at these types of income).  On a 220M contract that's about a 16M after-tax difference -- he'd have to make an additional 25-30M pre-tax to even that out.  This is on top of the difference between 150M over 4y (which would have Kemba looking for his next large contract at age 33) and 220M over 5y.  That's a 100M pre-tax difference (for one year less of contract).  You really have to assume that Kemba will start getting Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant-level endorsements or higher to make the math work out.   Finally,  &gt; The Supermax ... has already been declined by two all-nba talents  In fact, [no one has ever turned one down](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a7obqf/reminder_no_one_has_ever_turned_down_a_supermax/).  And Kemba Walker is much closer to John Wall than he is to the other 3 players who have accepted the true supermax."
Gallinari has more points than uh.. kevin durant.
Kevin Durant aka Mr. Inflatable

This isn't relevant to the game at hand but I feel the need to tell someone that in my 2k myleague last night for the Knicks rebuild I'm doing the Sixers won the championship the first year and Kevin Durant signed with them in the offseason
Kevin Durant
"16 year old kid makes fun of Kevin Durant on twitter  -&gt;  KD makes burner account to defend himself (Don't really know what else you'd expect him to do here)  -&gt;  GSW fans go crazy, 300 ""but LeBron did it too""'s in an hour, 50k downvotes for people making fun of him. ""Can you believe that people don't like KD?"" rabl rabl  -&gt;  KD gets in another argument with a 16 year old nobody next again next week because he's soft as baby shit"
Crazy how spooky the nets are going to be when they sign Kevin Durant.
"So if I am talking to my children and they tell me Kevin Durant was amazing because of his 3 rings and FMVPs, I will ignore my own experience and that of other people who actually were around for his career arc and accept what they have told me, rather than providing them with context. Got it"
"Because we aren't going to let Kevin Durant take something we enjoy away from us, try though might"
"Kevin ""wasted most of his career trying to carry OKC"" Durant"
Kevin Durant
he joins kevin durant on the new york knickerbockers.
Some days Embiid thinks he's Kevin Durant.
Because Kevin Durant is the big bad villain of the league.  I feel right now it's easy to hate on him but 5 years after he retires there will be a lot of apologism and people will respect KD's decision much more.
Lmao so you think Harden would’ve been able to start a dynasty with Klay and Draymond and win back to back MVPs even though he couldn’t do it while having Westbrook and Kevin Durant...?   I know you hate the warriors but at least try to apply logic to your thoughts

no bc kevin durant lebron James and giannis exist
"Yeah but he possibly has the best team of all time around him. Like how many double teams does he see? When you have Kevin Durant and Klay moving off ball. He's been great this season, but I doubt he's this efficient at 31 without his allstar team."
"If his consulting was anything like his twitter page, I don’t think he would be much help. “My Los Angeles Lakers should try and sign Kevin Durant this off-season” Thanks Magic"
"Kevin Durant surrendered the chance to possibly claim more MVPs and scoring titles in order to be better positioned for championships. He swapped out nearly a decade of goodwill from rabid supporters in exchange for a deluge of venom. And he gave up the aw-shucks charm of relatively quiet anonymity for round-the-clock, nitpicking scrutiny. But ask him if being a member of the Golden State Warriors has been all that he thought it would, and Durant responds without hesitation.  “Of course,” Durant said in a recent conversation with The Athletic.  Durant’s alliance with the Warriors has been mutually beneficial, and neither side should be upset if these playoffs turn out to be the end of their dynastic run together. The two championship rings and Finals MVPs are what was expected when Durant posted a picture of himself, arms folded, in that sleeveless T-shirt, and declared on The Players’ Tribune that the rest of the NBA would be playing for second place until further notice. That success has come with some stress — some from the outside, some self-inflicted — but this experience has been rewarding nonetheless.  “I came here knowing for a fact, that every media member, every fan was going to call me every name in the book for however long I was here and I was going to take the brunt of everything. I knew coming here,” Durant said. “But I wanted to be a part of this so bad, I didn’t give a fuck. Same with LeBron. He took all of that heat, no matter what.”  In three seasons in Oakland, Durant has learned to move better without the ball and developed the kind of ball-handling needed to consistently make plays for others and get any shot, from anywhere he wants. His shot remains a lethal weapon, but he can be more discretionary surrounded by more offensive threats.  Oklahoma City ran a perfunctory, facile offense that only popped because of the explosiveness and unpredictability of Durant and Russell Westbrook. The Warriors have been a graduate school education for Durant, forcing him to improve not only as a player but also as a teammate capable of sharing and ceding the spotlight as the situation warrants.  “I enjoy the way they played basketball. I never played with shooters like that. That moved. That were versatile players. I wanted to be a part of that,” Durant said. “My game was talking to me. Not that other shit. The spirit of the game was talking to me. Not the spotlight or the fame that comes from being the best player. Not the legacy. I swear on my life, that don’t mean nothing to me. How I build myself up in this NBA life, it doesn’t mean anything to me. I just want to play great basketball every second I’m on the court, and that was a perfect opportunity for me to do so.”  What Durant doesn’t possess are the kind of mind-blowing, get-on-my-back performances that players on teams with inferior individual talents ride into the record books and MVP conversations. His former Thunder teammate and reigning MVP James Harden just completed the greatest offensive season since Michael Jordan was demolishing scoreboards three decades ago.  Harden is about to finish no worse than second in MVP voting for the fourth consecutive season. Though he hasn’t finished higher than seventh since joining the Warriors — and is unlikely to finish much higher this season — Durant said he isn’t envious of the recognition other players are receiving. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Paul George could bump him from first-team all-NBA, an honor that, surprisingly, he has claimed only once since his MVP year in 2014.  “I watched James and I see what he’s doing and I admire what he’s doing and I appreciate what he’s doing,” Durant said. “Before, I would’ve been, ‘Fuck, I wish that was me.’ But now, I can appreciate the game even more because I’m so secure with my game. I don’t have to go out there and shoot every time for people to recognize me. I’m cool with it, you know what I’m saying?”  The Warriors are again favorites to win it all, with the addition of a playoff-starved DeMarcus Cousins tipping the odds even more in their favor. Becoming the first team since Bill Russell’s Celtics to win at least four in five years is the motivation, since the Warriors have proven most all other points. But this season has been a challenge unlike any other for an organization that has been blamed for ruining competitive balance.  Boredom and maintaining good health aren’t the only obstacles impeding the opportunity to make history. With Durant, Cousins and Klay Thompson set to become free agents this summer, and Draymond Green facing the same situation next year, the sense that this is the last dance for this dominance has resonated throughout the league, providing hope that the Larry O’Brien trophy won’t just set up permanent residency in the Bay Area.  This summer, Durant is set to make another seismic decision that could alter the landscape of the league for years to come.  From majority owner Joe Lacob on down, the Warriors haven’t let Durant’s future, and the constant rumblings surrounding it, disrupt what they’ve set out to accomplish. The competition has improved this postseason, and the rest of the league has caught up to a style of play that sent shockwaves throughout the league once Steve Kerr took over as head coach. But the Warriors still have the edge in talent, with a starting lineup of five all-stars, including two MVPs. After winning his first title, Durant recognized that it didn’t automatically fulfill him, mend any fractured relationships in his personal life or remove any worry; winning merely validated his dedication to the craft. That realization has resulted in some dourness and complicated his relationships with a team, a franchise, that has made joy so much a part of the equation. He’s had fun but is still searching.  This season has provided some displeasing moments — the Draymond Green public spat against the Warriors’ first-round playoff opponent that needed to be hashed out, privately over a bottle of wine; and rumors about Durant heading to the New York Knicks that reached a crescendo after a cap-clearing deal at the trade deadline. Having to address those situations has been annoying and caused him to lash out in response.  Given the scorn he endured for leaving Oklahoma City, and the perception among some bitter fans that he wasn’t fully committed in his final season with the Thunder, Durant is sensitive to any suggestion that he isn’t all-in for right now. His game is talking, commitment resonating with each slashing dunk or pull-up, foul-line jumper. But everyone seems to be listening to everything else.  If he could control the narrative, Durant would want the focus to be on how much he has evolved as a player with the Warriors, how he has become more efficient and engaged as a playmaker and defender. His versatility and dynamic skill set are unique for a player his size. And with LeBron James unable to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to the playoffs, a few more have reluctantly conceded that he is now the best player in the game. A rare superstar without a legion of diehard Stans, Durant knows what he believes but won’t waste his energy trying to make the argument for others.  “Comparison is a need for joy,” Durant said. “It takes a long time for you to realize that as an NBA player, especially when you’ve been pumped up, as soon as you come into it, you’re promoted a star. You always want to compare yourself to the next guy or the guy that did it before, the MJs, the Kobes, the LeBrons, to rookies. I want to compare myself to my teammates. When you compare yourself at all times to see what guys are doing, you’re taking away from the focus of trying to make yourself the greatest that you can be.”  Wherever Durant decides to play next season, that team will get a player who is undeniably better than when he arrived in Golden State. The Warriors remain optimistic that the appeal of becoming something historically great and moving into a sleek, new arena in San Francisco will persuade him to stay. They don’t need to make much of a recruiting pitch because they’ve provided the results and winning culture that he sought.  Although his accomplishments have been discounted by some because the Warriors remain Stephen Curry’s team, Durant understands that leaving the Warriors’ best potential rival, the Thunder, removed the lone impediment to Golden State’s dreams of domination. Durant’s decision to add some duper to an organically built super team topped what James did by teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. It also denied James the opportunity to make more than one ring in Cleveland part of his legacy.  Having has spent much of his career in pursuit of James, using his success as a barometer for what he needs to accomplish, Durant now has a chance to tie him in championships and capture the three-peat that would put him in select company alongside Russell and Jordan. He’s in that position because he’s endured the storm, all for chasing what had eluded him in previous places.  “I’m from Washington, D.C. I went to Oklahoma City for eight years. Out of nowhere, I went to the Bay for three years,” Durant said. “I’ve been roaming my whole life. I never had no stable environment. Ever. Ever. Since I woke up. I sacrificed a lot of shit to be here and to change my game up to be with these guys. And it was worth it.”"
"Klay Thompson, Steph curry, and Kevin Durant. Thank goodness those guys will never be on the same team."
"Hey guys we were each top 3 these past years, but we can still improve. What should we do?  Fuck it, let’s add Kevin Durant"
"Kerr oddly doesn’t get enough credit in my opinion. His adjustments can be a step slow, but the ego managing is extremely difficult and important for super teams.   It’s also simple to say: oh his job is easy they signed Kevin Durant, but KD doesn’t come there, and Boogie doesn’t come there cheap, unless they buy into the system and the coach."
The Splash Brothers - era Warriors were so fucking fun to watch. Damn you Kevin Durant
It started in 2019– and now the Knicks legend is back where it all began. We’re thrilled to have Kevin Durant represent us at the 2019 NBA Draft Lottery. Tune in on May 14 as he takes the stage in Chicago.

We dont hold it against him that he plays on a stacked team.  Kevin Durant - we choose to underappreciate his impact. We hold it against him that he plays on a stacked team.  They play on the same team and make the game much easier for each other, but due to narrative, its appreciated at diff levels.  -___-"
"It's totally nuts, but completely accurate anyways.  [Here's a Bref comparison to the top five](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id1_select=LeBron+James&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;player_id2_select=Giannis+Antetokounmpo&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=antetgi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id3_select=James+Harden&amp;y3=2019&amp;player_id3=hardeja01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id4_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y4=2019&amp;player_id4=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id5_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y5=2019&amp;player_id5=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=Russell+Westbrook&amp;player_id6_select=Russell+Westbrook&amp;y6=2019&amp;player_id6=westbru01&amp;idx=players)  I think the main thing is Westbrook is by FAR the worst shooter of that group of six.  TS% of .64, .64, .63, .61, .59 for the top five and .50 for Westy.  He's only shooting 43% overall.  I'm not saying this makes him bad, but it does mean he's not in the god-tier.  Everyone in the top five is putting up more points AND much better efficiency than Russell.  Add to the fact that I don't think his rebounding is as impressive as it looks (most DRBs in general are 'replaceable' by other players and especially in his case) and it's pretty solid.  An interesting point to note is that he's noticeably declined since his insane MVP year.  Actually quite a lot I think.  His usage was 41% that year (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) with a TS of 55%...  which is hard to even process.  With Paul George joining the team he's now only using 30% of possessions, but rather than getting more efficient he's declined to 50% TS%.  Crazy but true."
"Probably? People were saying ""probably the best team of all time"" even before they got fucking Kevin Durant lol  &amp;#x200B;  They're the best team of all time and it's not even remotely disputable."
"""I'm the biggest Lebron fan in the world and even I have to agree that Kevin Durant is better""  \-Kevin Durant"
"Because one is a superstar who had a lethargic year that likely included contract tampering and the destruction of the locker room cohesion and the other seemingly caused strife that prevented a well constructed team from achieving any sort of rhythm while seemingly also messing with locker room cohesion. The first guy has played 56000+ minutes and is coming off a season with his first major injury and the other has had 3 knee surgeries. Up until not too long ago there was beef between them.   Add to that question marks in the front office, coaching staff, and supporting cast. Who is going to play with them? How is Ingram going to be? Who can they pick up in free agency? How are they going to match up against existing superpowers in the west? What happens if and when Portland, Denver, Houston, Utah, Clippers, and/or Sacramento improve? How far do you think Golden State is going to drop if/when Kevin Durant leaves in free agency?   Even if they get Davis in a year, LeBron is even older, as is Kyrie. I really don't think those three are enough to call the Lakers a title contender. Maybe a ping pong ball lands them a stud in the draft and they get Kyrie and an out of nowhere superstar signing for under market. Maybe Pete Maravich rises form the dead in his prime and signs a vet minimum.   Kyrie and LeBron can be pretty big oars, but that doesn't mean shit if you are in an over sized cheese grater instead of a boat."
"Kevin Durant/Harden, Lebron, Giannis in that order."
Kevin Durant IMO is the best. Giannis seems the most hungry and determined. Steph is the best shooter. Kyrie is the best ball handler. LeBron is fading a little but still top 3. Harden is the best scorer. Paul George and Kawhi are the best 2-way players. Embiid is the best big man but I’m sure Jokic would like a word.  So many talented guys in this league it gets harder and harder every year to rank this.
"&amp;#x200B;  &gt;Oden, then 28, would stare at the television screen, watching clips of the player drafted No. 2 behind him, Kevin Durant, now a league superstar. The tears would flow.   &gt;   &gt;He would watch the old NBA YouTube clips of himself, knowing he shouldn't. He would sob.  &amp;#x200B;  Shit man, that's rough."

"According to Forbes' Kurt Badenhausen, superstars LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant — the top three total earners in the league this season — will all make more money in endorsements than they will from salaries and bonuses in 2019."
"Aside from Stockton which is overrated by many due to his career totals but only once or twice top 10 in the league, the others are pretty comparable.      It's easy to have a debate about top 10-12 ever because the set criterias work for them even though you have a different weightings. But then, the things get hazy.      Moses Malone, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett, John Havlicek, David Robinson, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry.   14 names. These 14 names are top 25 ever. Top 30 at worst and when you rank these names you should be able to keep the consistency with your top 10. So, it's not easy.   (I may be forgetting someone, of course.)"
"As a Kevin Durant fan, I fucking hope so."
Kevin Durant
Kevin. Durant. Enough said.
"Imagine being one of the biggest sources of revenue for the league and being fucked for nearly a decade because some owners were bitching about a superteam, then you watch Kevin Durant join the Warriors and run the league for the next few years"
"Ok I’ll bite - why should they do this? Is Kevin Durant coming to Washington this summer?  Wiz aren’t in a position where they are seriously contending next season, they don’t need the cap space that badly. At the very least they would wait until he comes back in 2020, and his trade value will tick upwards if he proves he can play."
Kevin Durant plays at in at least one playoff game
This is just wrong lol. Harden is one of the very few players that doesn’t lose efficiency if he takes more shots. Thats one of the things that’s made this season so special.  Kevin Durant even says he doesn’t like taking too many shots because it hurts his efficiency numbers. Historically more volume almost always means less efficiency.
He did sacrifice salary in 2017. About $10 million   https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kevin-durant-wanted-underpaid-fellow-warriors-salaries-deserve/story?id=49148436
"So many games? That was only 1 half bro. One half.  For their career KD is scoring 28 per game on Kawhi.

&gt;So all of a sudden giannis is better than Kevin Durant  Hes not
"1) Rondo 2) MJ 3) Wilt 4) Melo 5) Ben Wallace 6) James Harden 7) Rasheed Wallace (i grew up in Detroit lol) 8) Kevin Durant 9) Dwight Howard 10) TMac and Rondo are probably my two favorites of all time  honorable mentions: KG, Wade, Mike Miller, Chauncey Billups, Nate Robinson, Bill Laimbeer, Reggie Miller, Dirk...i could go on and on and on"
KD has no problem against Kawhi  27.5 points on 58.8% TS in the regular season  28.3 points on 61.1% TS in the playoffs  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2=leonaka01&amp;idx=players
Is this Kevin Durant?
"No no the media needs to give him the title a little too early so they can raise expectations and then tear him apart when he doesn’t meet them. See: Lebron James, Kevin durant etc"
Others in the 50-40-90 club:  Larry Bird (2x)  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Reggie Miller  Steve Nash (4x)  Drik Nowitzki  Mark Price
KD averages 26.4 on 48% FG against Tony Allen in the regular season.  KD averages 28.3 on 44% FG against Tony Allen in the post season.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Tony+Allen&amp;player_id2_select=Tony+Allen&amp;player_id2=allento01&amp;idx=players  Personally I think KD would destroy prime Tony Allen today. He now has the strength and size to bully Allen in the post. He didn't have that strength in 2013.
"Steph Curry, Allen Iverson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Michael Jordan, fifth is a toss up between Kevin Durant and Vince Carter"
Then they still have possibly the most naturally gifted mid-range shooter of all time in Kevin Durant. Ya know. That finals MVP guy
"LeBron had just won B2B MVPs before joining the Heat. There was a guy winning B2B MVPs right before KD joined the Warriors, but his name is not Kevin Durant."
"Read my other reply in this thread. I’m not saying one guy is better or Giannis is even close to being considered an all-time great. Russ clearly has the better resume. It’s just that when he hasn’t had *Kevin Durant* next to him it’s been nothing but flameouts, and I think there’s a weird double standard with how much fans emphasize playoff success for “all timers” and how much everyone ignores Russ’ relative mediocrity there."
" Is Dirks championship more impressive? Obviously the answer has to be yes. If the Warriors were to not win a championship was Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and multiple other all stars all on the same team it would be a huge upset. Dirks legacy changed because of that championship. You never hear people complain about Derek being a huge flopper or that he was soft as butter which was what he was known ass until the championship. He was known for settling for jump shots rather than driving and never really played aggressive or effective defense. His reign changed how people remember him as a player and how people talk about him at the time.  The same thing has happened with Ginobili even though he wasn’t the focal point of the spurs, they won five rings with him is one of their top three players and his legacy has changed from obnoxious flopper that really started the whole concept of flopping in the NBA to champion and crafty scorer.  I think when you have a team with a ton of talent it takes several rings for people to really give you the full credit. Of course Kobe and Shaq won three rings together they had Kobe and Shaq. Of course Jordan and Pippen 16 rings they had Jordan and Pippen. The assemblage of talent on the Warriors  is unlike anything we’ve ever seen in the league probably better than the prime Celtics. I think if they win enough brings 6+ rings then the critics will be silent. They’ll simply remember the team for its greatness. Even the individual players will be looked at favorably like in the spurs instance."
One of the most overpowered teams ever and a example of what happens when too many superstars team up unbalancing the NBA competitive landscape. Also blowing a 3-1 lead works against them since they won 73 games and had a chance to be beyond the 1996 Bulls 72 win championship season by not winning that year and getting Kevin Durant after they actually have a less glorious legacy if the Warriors won in 2016 their legacy would be glorious.
Kevin Durant.
**KEVIN DURANT OVERREACTING TO ONLINE CRITICISM IS LITERALLY 99% OF ALL /R/NBA ACTIVITY**
"Every time I see a Kevin Durant stat I go ""wow huh I didn't know he was THAT efficient""."
"Yes, he is.  Steph Curry gets targeted by opposing teams on defense because:  a) when your other options are Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, yeah, Steph Curry is the weak link in that chain and  b) tiring him out on D is pretty much the only way to stop him crushing you at will offensively."
"My favorite part about that game was the end, where the Warriors didn't win. Quite the contrary, the Warriors lost that game and didn't win it. Specifically, Steph Curry, the unanimous MVP did not win the game. Nor did Draymond Green. Nor did Klay Thompson. Nor did Kevin Durant, who wasn't on the team yet, but fuck him anyway.  In fact, none of the Warriors won that game, because the Warriors lost. At the end of the game, it was not the Warriors who won, but rather the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Lebron James, who won the game due in no small part to the fact that he was not a member of the Warriors, but rather the leader of the victorious Cleveland Cavaliers.  Who did the Cavs beat to win that game, you might ask? The Golden State Warriors, who blew a 3-1 series lead and ended their season without winning the title."
"Not a single one of those names has half the international recognition of even, say, a Kevin Durant. And I use KD as an example because he's a unanimously agreed upon top star in the league but not the #1 or even #2 guy."
Kevin Durant had more TO than shots taken. Yeah that is about right.
The 2017 Cavs have the highest playoff offensive rating in NBA history. That's including the finals loss. They did all they could to win. It turns out if you have a record setting offense then you still can't beat a 73 win team who added Kevin Durant.
"You know those people who ""track"" the trophy through the NFL as the teams beat the champ and then beat the teams who beat the teams who beat the champ?  Well the NBA is going to introduce a new rule next season, where if you beat the team Kevin Durant is on you get to have Kevin Durant on your team."
"&gt;Durant is constantly talked about in the media, Twitter and by OTHER NBA PLAYERS for joining gsw to this day.  LeBron had the same treatment up until he went back to cleveland, where everyone started loving him again. Players still respected LeBron, but you still had guys like Rondo who talked about him negatively.  If we're talking about peak levels of hatred, there is absolutely no competition. LeBron in his heatle days were the epitome of villainous. They were paraded as the villains and booed in every single arena. Today, nobody but OKC booes durant, and even now they don't even care because they're in love with their new boo, Paul George. Also remember that Cleveland hated Bron so much, they were throwing batteries at him. That's much worse than verbal insults, which most players experience anyway.  There are 2 reasons for this: LeBron has been the de facto ""Best Player in the NBA"" for almost a decade now (maybe not this season but you get the idea). Kevin Durant has never held that title with such strong agreement. So his backlash will never be as big  Reason 2 is because Durant's move was seen as much weaker than Bron's move. I'm sure we've all been through this debate, but essentially, LeBron and KD made the same move, but KD's was worse."
"Kevin Durant, Patrick Beverley, then literally it doesn’t matter the other three you put on the team"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins"
"In terms of Kevin Durant the only issue is the lack of shot taking. Patrick’s defense is NOT the reason KD took only 8 shots. KD can put up a shot any time he wants, there’s no angle he can’t get willingly. As much as the Dubs don’t like to ISO as it slows down play, when the Clips use Patrick to invite a KD iso, I want them to let KD take it every time. I refuse believe to Patrick can lock him down. Just annoy him a bit"
kevin durant
"Well last time we did, we got Kevin Durant and won back to back. So.. 🤔"
Anyone that defends KD on Reddit is a Kevin Durant alt until proven otherwise
"A member of the @GSWarriors bought several of the burner phones that turn off in the back and F Kevin Durant is debuting one of them in the morning shootaround. “You look like you're a mod at /r/nba,” a teammate said to KD. Durant said he would NOT use the phone in tonight’s game."
"Well by the book, I think you're right. But given that the NBA doesn't usually call palming violations by the book (Kevin Durant basically palms the ball every time he dribbles), I'd say since Kanter's hand is most on the side of the ball here, he could take another dribble. But ya that frame is the only point of debate imo"
"No.   Just last year the pelicans made it their game plan to lock down Dame and CJ, I would call that the most committed and singularly focused defensive effort.  I would also applaud Jrue's job vs Kevin Durant in the second round then.  There are plenty of great defensive efforts that are the main winning strategy of teams in the playoffs. Acting like there hasn't been a great one since 2015 is disrespectful."
"This shit is all subjective, right. It's what I feel based on what I've seen and there's no right answer. But to me, I can't give that crown of best in the NBA to someone who hasn't proven it in the post season or reached the finals.   If James gets it this year, I'd give him my pick without hesitation.   And Steph is one of my favorite players. I think KD is just a better one on one player and defender, but if someone said Steph, I wouldn't argue with them. That's a fair take too.  I'm actually surprised that someone would be so ""amazed"" that anyone would think Kevin Durant is the best player in the world. Has he fallen off to you? I mean, it's not like I said Kemba is the greatest. Or Dame. I feel like KD is in most people's top 3."
Every time I see a close up of Kevin Durant I remember how much I hate his stupid ugly face.
"&gt;KD has gotta learn some mental toughness, you can’t be an all time great  Let me ask you this. Do you think current hall of famers respect Kevin Durant?  I bet if you ask the all-time greats, they'd all call him a bitch."
Only part that sucks is that it wasn’t Kevin Durant.
Thank God the Warriors lost that year to overshadow the fact that OKC blew a 3-1 lead *and a Kevin Durant*   😭
Kevin Durant.
"if anything theyve been using him for rings. Everyone has kinda shit on him.  Steph and klay being jealous when he got his finals mvp, the owner or gm basically shit on him at the parade, Draymond telling him straight like it is when that was supposed to be his closest friend on the team and the guy that recruited him.    Kevin Durant is a Multiple time champion, finals mvp but prolly feels like a used up whore and wants to feel appreciated. Cant blame him. He's had regrets about the move ever since he left. It was worth it for the rings, but now he understandably wants to bounce."
"I got 17 karma dog if I wanted more Karma I'd just post ""Harden is Hitler"" or ""Kevin Durant mentally weak"".   I just wanted to make people aware that The Clippers are probably gonna have the only 2 rookies playing big playoff minutes. I'm a happy clippers fan."
"&gt;He's not an enigma  Enimga: a person or thing that is mysterious, puzzling, or difficult to understand.  Kevin Durant is difficult to understand"
"Nah Kevin Durant has Stockholm syndrome, didn’t you see what he did last time he blew a playoff lead?"
Kevin Durant has formally requested a trade to the LA Clippers...

I will never hate a basketball player more than Kevin Wayne Durant.
Naw but I unironically think Kevin “if you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em” Durant is **seriously** considering signing with the LAC this summer.

"&gt; There are tons of reporters who will go ""Hey you know what? Kevin Durant clearly doesn't like us asking about free agency and he's told us this throughout the entire regular season"" and so they ask about different questions.  I think that is in journalism handbook: only ask easy questions your subject likes to answer."

He’s so lonely and should get married because everyone on this sub has a psychological read on him like I never had. What a bitch. He’s insecure and lacks self-esteem, which is why this mentally weak human being blew a 3-1 lead to us 3 years ago in a western conference series."
"NBA Players with an MVP not currently in the HOF: Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dirk, Kobe, Lebron, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Westbrook, Harden.  Sucks to hear, but D Rose is the only one on this list that isn't going to the HOF currently."
aaaaand kevin durant to the clippers next year.
Patrick Beverly didn't hold Kevin durant to 8 shots Kevin Durant held himself to 8 shots   KD just didn't want to shoot this goes back to the regular season where for the past  12 games he was taking less shots than Draymond
"Are you saying they shouldn’t have recruited Kevin Durant, who many considered the second best player in the league? They should actively go out of their way to not recruit the best possible teammates so that redditors can feel happy about their arbitrary notions of honor?"
I can’t believe Kevin Durant decided to sign for the Clippers because he blew a 31 point lead.

patrick beverly is gonna appear on the injury report tomorrow with a sprained shoulder from aggressively waving at kevin durant after the game

5 shots and 7 turnovers. Up double digits. Such is life as Kevin Durant.
"&gt;	With 15 points tonight, Kevin Durant (1,074 points) has passed Jeff Mullins (1,073) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time postseason scoring list."
Ya Kevin durant is totally not rattled lo /s
Does Kevin Durant remind anyone else of Fry Lock from Aqua Teen Hunger Force?
Kevin Durant looks so frustrated out there. I am not even watching the game just watching the KD-Bev show. This is amazing.
That play was straight up a copypasta in real life. Patrick Beverley draws an offensive foul on Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant turns the ball over. Third Quarter TV Timeout. Clippers 74 - Warriors 99
"Durant shot under 40% from the field for three consecutive games in the WCF (36.5% between games 4-6, Houston is 2-1 with the lost coming with Paul injured).   He’s still Kevin Durant, yes. You wont stop him. But you can make him work very hard for his shots and that’s what Ariza did to keep him from completely taking over the series."
Nobody watches the big screen more than Kevin Durant.
"Fuck man.... I feel sad for Golden State man.    Now they have to rely on Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and the great Jordan Bell.   Smh!   Cold game!"
"""Jordan for three!""   ""No, two pointer. He had a foot on the line""   ""I'm being told it was actually a dunk""   ""I'm being told it was actually Kevin Durant"""
"You can actually see, on tape, the exact moment at which Kevin Durant developed a true hatred and contempt for the media.  When a reporter stuck a microphone in his face and told him that Erin Popovich had just passed away, he's shocked, and upset, naturally enough, and then he sits for a moment not *quite* looking at the camera and pretty much visibly thinking: ""Fuck you, you goddamn *ghouls*.""  Because he's having a real *human* moment of sympathetic pain and he's doing it with a fucking camera in his face because they want something dramatic.  Before that, he was smiling and laughing and being friendly with the media who were there for that practice session.  I don't think he's been friendly with the media since. He fucking hates them now, and he has reason. Because they showed up and proved to him as thoroughly as it is possible to prove such a thing that even his pain is just entertainment to them. The media will not grant even the most basic human decency.  Human decency would demand that the camera turn away from his shock and his grief that someone he knew had just died. I doubt he and Erin Popovich knew each other well, but he knows Pop, he respects Pop, he cares about Pop, he has *empathy* so he's going to be *feeling a way*.  But the media? They'll stick a camera in his face and tell him as bluntly as they possibly can to maximise the *drama*.  It would be weird if Kevin Durant *didn't* fucking hate the media."
Golden State has signed-and-traded Kevin Durant for Zion Williamson
"The Viper, Kevin Durant"
He'll also play in the final play off game of another all-time great: Kevin Durant.

[In case you were curious how dominant Kevin Durant has been from the midrange this season.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;year_id=2019&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;shot_type=JUMP_SHOT&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;shot_distance_min=6&amp;shot_distance_max=20&amp;q1=Y&amp;q2=Y&amp;q3=Y&amp;q4=Y&amp;q5=Y&amp;time_remain_minutes=12&amp;time_remain_seconds=0&amp;time_remain_comp=le&amp;c1stat=fga&amp;c1comp=ge&amp;c1val=300&amp;order_by=fg)   Note how much higher his volume is than everyone else close to him on that list. Literally insane.
"""Hey is that Kevin Durant at that boba shop?""  ""Naw you must be confusing him with another nappy haired 7-footer who hangs out in the Bay Area"""
Sixers with Kevin Durant as their center court logo
Legal reasons most likely [https://www.courthousenews.com/durantula-guitarist-callsa-foul-on-kevin-durant/](https://www.courthousenews.com/durantula-guitarist-callsa-foul-on-kevin-durant/)
Kevin durant and james har-  ...oh wait  ....nevermind.
"There are tons of reporters who are professional. There are tons of reporters who are reasonable. There are tons of reporters who will go ""Hey you know what? Kevin Durant clearly doesn't like us asking about free agency and he's told us this throughout the entire regular season"" and so they ask about different questions.   &amp;#x200B;  Reddit views these players as animals not people, so when reporters come out and act a whole dickhead and continue to poke the bear instead of saying ""Wow thats annoying as hell they should stop"" people come up and post ""HyUk jUsT dOiNg ThErE JoB hYuK"""
"Who the fuck would answer free agency questions during the playoffs while trying to threepeat?  &amp;#x200B;  Whats the point of even asking then?  &amp;#x200B;  Has he revealed anything about his free agency plans during the press conferences and interviews during the entire regular season?  &amp;#x200B;  No. So then I ask you, why, as a reporter would you ask that question? ""People want to know"" but they haven't found out yet, its bordering on harassment. They're literally trying to get him to say something emotional or something that's not super nice and polite so that they can run with it and attract people to their sites to watch Kevin Durant get pissed off."
Are you saying Kevin Durant need to re evaluate the way he watches basketball
Of course the greatest scorer of all time will be on this map twice.   Also Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team. Idc what picks they were
"No, but Tramel used the same title when it went out in his own twitter account:   &gt;[Kevin Durant has become Mr. Unreliable in Memphis series http://t.co/pxFsG8PCLo](https://twitter.com/BerryTramel/status/461673585367478272?s=19)"

"Yeah if only he had a teammate like say, Kevin Durant? Victor Olapido? James Harden? lmao"
"I guess we have different definitions of elite because if you’re not top 10 in your era and you’re not top 20, then you’re not among the most elite of all time. Like I said, he’s borderline elite, but he absolutely cannot be grouped with Kevin Durant"
"Are there that many new warriors fans?  Are you seriously trying to pretend that it wasn't Curry and Thompson that didn't make this team explode? Or are you just going to forget about '13/'14 and pretend like it didn't happen?  They won the chip in '15, but they hit the playoffs and exploded in '13 or '14.  Let me guess, you think that Draymond is the reason, not, oh I don't know, a massive coaching change, a shift in the usage of Iggy/Barnes, completely different Curry and Klay action, the list goes on?  The Warriors were a 29 win team in 2012. Curry breaks out from 14 ppg to 23 ppg, and Thompson from 12 to 16 and they win 47 games. Draymond plays 13 mpg. No Iggy. Next year they win 51 with Curry's 24 and Thompson's 18. Draymond 22 mpg + Iggy.   I mean cmon now. We really trying to pretend that DRAYMOND sparked this fucking team?  Jesus christ. There's a reason Kerr wanted that GSW job, and it was two guards putting up 40+ ppg on 45/40/85 shooting. Not fucking draymond. Good lord.  Next thing we're going to hear about how Kevin Durant took this team in shambles from losing in the finals to being a 3-peat. LMFAO"
"About 350,000 folks commute \*into\* San Francisco for work. (About 400,000 folks who work in SF also live there.) While not each of those 350,000 folks is cramming into the city during traditional commute hours, getting into the city on a weekday morning is a small nightmare. Conversely, leaving the city between 4 pm and 6:30 pm on a weekday is rough.     I assume Kevin Durant leaves for his games before 4 pm. Or maybe he takes BART to Coliseum in a great disguise."

"""He hasn't had playoff success without Durant""  Well neither has Kevin Durant. Let's see what happens if he has the cajones the leave the Avengers."
"Really? This is like KD thinking people would regard him as the best in the world when he won the championship with 3 other all stars.   This year I feel is the only argument that CAN be made and LeBron still averaged 27/8/8 (second ever) on an injured groin. Kevin Durant absolutely has been the second best player in the league, but the teams around LeBron have underperformed on top of being much less talented than what KD has had, on top of him being outplayed by LeBron."
Kevin Durant: “Who dis?”
"Lebron uses athleticism and physicality to score while kevin Durant uses skill to score. Never said lebron couldnt score. The question was who's more skillful, not who has the highest ts% . Try again little buddy."
All Kevin Durant has is that same crossover. He doesn’t have handles like PG.
Lebron uses athleticism/ physicality to score. Kevin Durant uses skill to score. The question is who's more skilled not who has more total points on all time list .
Ball handling? Kevin has more handles that Lebron but neither of them is bad at it them is bad at it that itll affect their game. Should even be brought up. Lebron passes more because he lacks the necessary skills to score like Kevin Durant. Durant's scoring is more skillful &gt; to passing.
"Rebounding uses athleticsm , not a skill. Lebron passes more because he lacks the necessary skills to score like Kevin Durant. Durant's scoring is more skillful &gt; to passing"
"Take into consideration volume and difficult level and Steph is less impressive.  Also the system he plays in does wonders for his finishing.  Steph is not a better scorer from literally anywhere on the court.  Steph lacks any post game at all; which is a skill, and while Steph may have a higher percentage from mid range(not even sure if this is true, haven’t checked), he rarely shoots them unless he’s absolutely open.  Kyrie takes insanely contested mid range shots constantly and shoots a higher percentage on them than Kevin Durant over the course of both of their careers."
"I've said nothing incorrect. Lebron uses his physicality to score, Kevin Durant uses skill. Try again."
"Being physical is not a skill.  Shooting is a skill and has multiple branches off of that. Shooting off a faceup, shooting off the dribble, fadeaway, leaner, runner, crossover into a pullup, posting up into a fadeaway, hesitation pullup. Kevin Durant is much more technically sound. Lebron shoving his shoulders into people on a layup is not a skill"
Kevin Durant. He's elite on both offense and defense.
Kevin Durant easily &gt; Lebron
"&gt;35 year old Iggy is probably the best finisher we have off of lobs  Other than Kevin Durant, though you're right. Durant usually isn't in the right spots for lobs from Curry."
Kevin Durant
"Oh yes, non-NBA player and internet person, do explain how you know what it means to be a NBA championship over the likes of Kevin Durant.  Hate the move all you want, but pretending those rings mean nothing is cry baby bullshit."
Whatever you say ... Kevin Durant
"If you’re actually curious, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis were the next most searched 3 players. A snake, a turtle, and a unibrow leading the second unit. 82-0."
"I dont think you get why i said what I said. Im sorry i wasnt more elaborate. He used Westbrook playoff accomplishments with kd and harden to support his claim. Which I don't think is fair since Westbrook hasn't won a series without Kevin Durant. Even with the acquisition of Paul George. So yes, Lillard has won 0 series, but using Westbrook's playoff victories and accomplishments with a much more talented team isn't a good starting point for this argument.   Westbrook best point would be MVP which a narrative driven award."
Kind of easy to score when the defense has to worry about Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson
Are you trying to argue that Kevin Durant is better than Paul George? And he still had Russ for part of that series.
Kevin Durant hasn't won a playoff series without at least one other all star. The west is rough.
Kevin Durant could be the next KD
Kevin Durant. Did you guys know he’s Kevin Durant? I had no idea
"Damian never had the teammates that Russ had. That's incontestable.  Imagine if Damian Lillard had played alongside Kevin Durant? He would have had a lot more ""accolades"""
Westbrook hasn't won a playoff series since the departure of Kevin Durant
"I've posted this rant many times before in this sub. I'll just copy and paste it again. Kevin Durant was the best prospect I've ever seen, I would take him first overall in any draft class. Granted, I didn't pay attention when LeBron was around, so I don't have a good view of him, but of the players I've seen Durant was the best.   &gt;Oden was a great college player yes but he was nowhere near as good in college as other big prospects like Blake Griffin, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Deandre Ayton, Karl Anthony Towns, and now Zion Williamson. Yes he was a great prospect. He was not Kevin Durant. &gt;There was a large vocal minority of people who were completely baffled that Durant wasn't going first overall. Read [this mock draft](http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=nbamockdraft/070627) by Bill Simmons. It was absolutely not crazy to consider Kevin Durant. Granted I am nowhere close to as scathing as Simmons is in his criticism of Oden, but my point is that it's not revisionist for me to say I'd take KD over Oden.   &gt;Oden was absolutely not a perfect prospect. Durant was. Odens counting stats were definitely not bad, he averaged 16/10/1/1/3, on 59% TS and his shot blocking was definitely solid. His 63% from the line wasn't great but for a big it was solid. He played 29 mpg. All of this was great, his rim protection was excellent and he was easily the best player on the Ohio State team that made it to the championship game. He lost to an incredible Florida team that had 3 top 10 picks (Al Horford, Corey Brewer, Joakim Noah). He won the defensive player of the year award. He was a 2nd team all American.   &gt;There is no doubt I would have taken Oden second. He was a very good big man prospect, and he was definitely one of the better prospects of those draft classes, but he wasn't Durant.   &gt;Durant averaged 26/11/1/2/2 on 59% TS including 40% from 3 (6 attempts per game) and 82% from the line. All on 36 mpg. He was the first ever freshman to win the Naismith and he won just about every other college basketball award you can think of. His only blemish was losing in the 2nd round to a USC team, even though he scored 30 points that game. Calling him the best player in college basketball isn't doing him justice, he had one of the best college seasons in NCAA history.   &gt;We are talking a 6'10"" pure forward with a 7'5"" wingspan (bigger than Oden I might add), 9'2"" standing reach, who averaged 26 points per game on incredible efficiency, had the speed and fluidity of LeBron James, who could handle the ball like a guard, shots 40% from 3, 82% from the line, and had just won every award you can possibly imagine. All while he was a 19 year old freshmen in college. Durant was, plain and simple, the best prospect we have seen since LeBron. Oden was also amazing, he was not Kevin Durant."

You clearly haven’t seen Patrick Beverley and Kevin Durant go back and forth all series.
I just remember him writing that peice about Kevin Durant not showing up in the second half against warriors then the daily Oklahoman titled it as Mr Unreliable smh
Kevin Durant first NBA superstar to bring multiple championships to different national teams. He would get two more final MVPs. That would make his case for better than Lebron.
"It is true. The editor even wrote an [apology](https://newsok.com/article/4744890/headline-over-kevin-durant-story-missed-the-mark?no_cache=1) for the headline. It's rare for writers to be in charge of their headlines. The article isn't good, but it wasn't blackball him from covering the team forever bad."
You don't get much of a choice. The defender is forcing intensity on you.  Extreme analogy:  - Kevin Durant guarded by Pat Bev. Constantly infront of him with his blowjob stance.  vs   - Kevin Durant guarded by a New York Knick. A half-assed hand in the air. Waiting for the season's tanking to be over.
"lol i ain't even salty, im amused by how people compare the two, and the fact that your whole minutes spill was bullshit. It don't matter if he averaged 20 minutes for a month, he still averaged more minutes than Giannis at the end of the day. If anything Giannis's stats would be even better if he played the same minutes as AD. Giannis has virtually every advanced metric on his side too. Plus if you actually watched the two play, you would realize how different they are. Giannis primarily operates in the perimeter while AD is more post focused. Plus AD is no where near the playmaker that Giannis is. Really the only thing AD does better than Giannis is shoot and maybe defense(that one is very arguable though because its hard to quantify good overall defense). Litteraly everything else Giannis is superior, playmaking, finishing in the paint, efficiency, most importantly DURABILITY, etc. AD can't give you the same production as Giannis, he is still a superstar but Giannis is in another tier.   I have watched every bucks game this season, and from my observation, He is on a level of overall impact that only LeBron James and Kevin Durant can match. Keep sleeping though, I have always been ahead of the curve on Giannis. I know i am gonna get downvoted for my opinion but hey, I remember how I was getting downvoted last year for saying Giannis is better than Paul George and Anthony Davis. I was be proven right then, and I will be proven right in the future. Yall keep sleeping  😴😴😴"
Show me how many TV shows/Movies Kevin Durant is working on right now.  Check. Mate.
Kevin Durant.

"Patrick Beverly is 6’2 and Kevin Durant is 7 feet, there you go."
"No idea why you are getting downvoted  It is obviously a dig at the Warriors, who are leaving Oakland, and Kevin Durant  It is so obvious. How can basketball fans be this oblivious? Pretty much everyone over and r/baseball made the connection right away but people here are denying it LOL"
"I would go with Kevin Durant. He cares about the people. Curry is pro people dying, so I don't want him shooting my shot."
"This is really weird because Kerr came out and said ""we need KD to take 20 to 30 shots"", then KD says ""I dont have to take that many shots""  OAKLAND — Steve Kerr hardly minced his words about Kevin Durant, who had more turnovers (nine) than field-goal attempts (eight) in the Warriors’ Game 2 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. “Absolutely, he needs to be more aggressive,” Kerr said. “It’s the playoffs. He can get any shot he wants at anytime. I want to see him get 20 shots, 30.”  It does not appear Durant wants to do that when the Warriors (1-1) play the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 3 on Saturday in Los Angeles.  “I’m not going to just go out there and just go for 20 or 30 shots,” Durant said. “I don’t play like that. If we were up by [31] points and I had five shots, everybody’s shots would be evenly distributed around that time when we’re up 30. Me taking two more shots after that isn’t the reason we lost.”   When I get the ball in my position to score, I will look to score. If I don’t have an option to score, I will pass,” Durant said. “We run a lot of plays here. We move the ball every time down the court. Every time I touch it, I’m not going to break the play just to be aggressive to get up 30 shots because it looks like something is wrong with me. I’m just going to play basketball. We won Game 1 that way. We were up [31]. We should stick with the game plan we had for 3 ½ quarters and do that for 48 minutes.”"
"Kevin Durant and deflecting criticisms, name a more iconic duo"
"Kevin Durant and deflecting criticisms, name a more iconic duo"
So does that mean Kevin Durant is not a generational talent because Lebron was drafted 4 years earlier?
Kevin Durant is like Kanye West. They both need to be loved and feel important
"I'm not sure who this Kevin Durant guy is, but watching the refs was a real treat"
Kevin Durant would be considered the best player in the league for 2 years now if he wasn’t on the Warriors.
Kevin Durant is the best player in the nba for the past 3 years
To keep it simple let’s go with someone saying that Patrick Beverly is better than Kevin Durant. They can make the argument about defense leadership or whatever you want but it doesn’t change the fact that their opinion about who’s better is wrong.
https://sports.yahoo.com/rip-kevin-durant-rip-move-kind-164236047.html?y20=1
I’m Kevin Durant
"Is there a ""I'm Kevin Durant"" t-shirt yet?  Feels like there should be.  His Jersey should say ""I'm Kevin Durant.""  You know what, they should just skip names altogether and let players put whatever name they want on the back of the Jersey."
"That is the correct answer. Oden was undoubtedly the bigggest. Let's put it like that: Kevin Durant was basically hyped as New Michael Jordan (I know. But in his case, in a serious way), and Greg Oden was still hyped more. The big question was his health and mostly that.   &amp;#x200B;  If we take into consideration that there was always doubt about Oden being able to play, then it's probably close to a tie between Anthony Davis and Durant."
"Follow up question is: any comment on proclaiming ""I am Kevin Durant!""  ah man, he's in his own head."
"I love how right after his answer, the next question is ""why do you feel like you need to tell everyone I'm Kevin Durant! during a game?"""
"Tier 1:  Zion, Anthony Davis, LeBron   Tier 2: Greg Oden, Kevin Durant, OJ Mayo  Tier 3: Blake Griffin, Andrew Wiggins   All were extremely hyped #1 picks. Honorable mention might be Derrick Rose"
"Our owner said that in the middle of the 2016 season.  We won 73 games, lost in the finals, and then signed Kevin Durant in the offseason and won two more championships.  Make fun of Lacob for whatever you want, but I think that was a pretty good way to back up such a cocky statement."
"Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant"

"if nike still gives those kind of bonuses to Kevin Durant, he needs to rework that contract! he's a huge name it doesn't matter what market he's in."
"I totally agree with that. He's had some disappointing games. What often gets ignored here is that usually that happens because the defensive strategy is to completely lock him down and force the rest of the team to win. This was especially true for the Cavs.  I know GrAvItY is a meme but even in Steph's bad games he often has great +\- because focusing a disproportionate amount of defensive effort on one player on a stacked team doesn't typically work out.   I'll never forget when the Cavs double teamed Steph on a fast break 3 allowing him to dish it to Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant for a wide open dunk."
Who else read this as Kevin Durant and not Kevin Looney at first lol
"kevin durant. i know he has it in him, just needs to get on a team where hes not a role player"
"They almost never doubled Klay. They’d trap him in the corners, but that’s not a double. Who in their right mind would double a spot up shooter when Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are on the court at the same time? It doesn’t make any sense."
Think they'll still have attendance problems if they can have a competitive playoff series then also sign Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA and it’s not close.
"&gt; SO, Sam Presti's obsession with a big 7-foot traditional center goes all the way back to 2009 when he traded for Tyson Chandler.   Tyson was arguably the second most important player in the 2011 DAL team that won a ring.  &gt;Then in 2011, he traded for Kendrick Perkins --- and before Perkins even played a single minute (!!!!!) for the Oklahoma City Thunder, Presti signed him to a 36 million/4 year contract.  This was during an era where OKC still need to go through Duncan, LAL's big men, and Dwight possibly. Kendrick was a valuable asset during his time there.  &gt;This was an incredibly short-sighted move that was looked at with a lot of skepticism  Short sighted moves are the types of moves you make when you're close to winning a ring. This has been the strategy for most teams who won or were just there. And honestly, there's no need for Presti to try and have some contingency plan. They had KD and Russ who were young. Any moves, no matter how bold, is not mortgaging their future. That's the beauty of KD and Russ. You can stay young and be in a win-now mode.  &gt; around the league at the time, that in-directly led to the Harden trade ([some more info](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1389202-why-kendrick-perkins-contract-forced-okc-thunder-to-trade-james-harden)). Now, Harden was traded for one and one sole reason only -- the OKC Thunder owners did not want to go over the luxury tax line this early into their ownership. But the only reason this problem arose is because, Harden was 5th in Sam Presti's priority order of whom to pay. It was Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and then James Harden. Sam Presti didn't account for James Harden when writing up the bill. In all honesty, I think Presti *assumed* without asking, that Harden would be okay with taking whatever they offered him. Harden obviously said he wasn't taking less, and again, without so much as giving it a second thought, Presti immediately looked to move Harden. Despite having just signed Perkins to that massive extension, Presti's first thought was, ""I'm going to trade Harden for another 7-foot center"".   &gt;   &gt;In summer 2012, Presti offered Harden in a trade centered around Jonas Valancunis to the Toronto Raptors, but Raptors GM at the time, Bryan Colangelo, declined ([here](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1610472-james-harden-could-have-been-a-raptor-would-you-have-pulled-the-trigger)).   &gt;   &gt;Harden wasn't even hitting restricted free agency for a whole year, but Presti for some reason was impatient and desperately wanted to move him on, despite Harden having played the third most important role in the team getting to the NBA Finals just a couple months back. In the end, he was traded to Houston and the rest as they say is history.  Hindsight is 20-20. Of course it looks bad that Harden is an MVP and OKC is no longer the juggernaut it was. But think of it this way, I think it was fairly obvious Harden was too good be the 3rd best player on a team. He was likely gonna wanna leave anyways and it was okay to part ways because they knew they had 2 superstars in KD and Russ. And even if he stayed, you're spending all your money on perimeter players with the Russ and Harden needing the ball in their hand to be worth you're paying them.   Idk where you got the idea that Presit can just pay Harden whatever and he'd be fine with it. That just seems like all mindless speculation.  &gt;Now, OKC obviously got the draft picks in the trade for Harden. And guess who Sam Presti wanted to draft with the highest pick available? Yep, you guessed it, a 7-foot center. Steven Adams was drafted with the 12th pick in the 2013 draft, with Perkins obviously still on the roster (sidenote - Giannis was drafted with the 14th pick).  Steven Adams was a good pick up and was valuable in their playoff runs. And they got Kevin Martin who did a decent job of filling in what Harden was doing as the sixth main. And also Jeremy Lamb. He's nothing to rave about but there was a lot of upside to him at the time of trade. You complain about being Presti short-sighted but this trade was picking up young guys.  &gt;In February 2015, Presti finally hesitantly decided to trade Perkins, and it cost OKC a first round pick. But guess what OKC got in return? Yep, right again, yet another traditional 7-foot center, Enes Kanter. Now, here's where the real craziness with the money begins. In summer 2015, Kanter hit restricted free agency, and OKC matched a 70 million/4 year offer sheet for Kanter. This made absolutely no sense whatsoever. OKC had to pay KD soon, Westbrook soon. Hell, Kanter wasn't even the team's starting center (!!!) Adams was, and he had to be paid soon too. But Presti couldn't resist, he simply had to pay him.  Kanter was giving them an inside presence. He was fine during his stint. Overypaying people is something you just have to live with when you wanna win. The best teams always have a huge payroll.  You're mainly complaining that OKC has been focusing on big men rather than Harden. TBH, they had enough talent on the perimeter where they didn't necessarily need Harden. **And going big and long is a strategy that almost got them rings, probably a higher chance of winning than sticking with Harden in my opinion.**  &gt;But imo, from the beginning to the end, the main reason why the Thunder have come all the way from a team that drafted 3 all-time great talents to what they are today, is down to Presti's adamancy of continually wanting that traditional 7-foot big and prioritizing and premeditating the needs of a team built around that type of center, over what the team ALREADY had -- 3 MVPs, then 2 MVPs, now 1.  Realistically, they had zero chance of retaining 3 MVPs. One of them was bound to leave and letting Harden go was probably the right decision. And they did a pretty good job at setting up a team that's worthy of retaining 2 MVPs. KD leaving was just so unpredictable."
"Kevin ""Kevin Durant"" Durant"
"Geez this guy comes off as such a dick.  “I’m Kevin Durant”  “I don’t need to show anybody anything”  Fuck this guy, if he wasn’t a basketball player he’d have 0 friends with that shit attitude."
&gt; Awesome try at a straw man though!  That's what Warriors fans do. They rationalize and they straw man in some desperate attempt to make themselves feel better about Kevin Durant joining their 73-win team.  Dirk's single ring will mean more than any amount KD nets while on Warriors.
"Ewww. ""Kevin Durant, Warriors""? As if the team is just along for the ride.   Either this is KD's PR at work or the Warriors renowned PR is laving his balls in the hopes that he won't think he has to leave to get credit for winning."
"Durant's PR stepped up their game? Google his name and look at the headlines today:  ""He's Kevin Durant, and you're not""   ""Kevin Durant, Warriors dominate Patrick Beverley and Clippers in Game 3""   ""Kevin Durant chooses to Crush the Clippers Rather Than Toy With Them""   You've got to love how that last one insinuates he gave game 2 away out of sheer boredom. This isn't just Warriors PR, it's Durant PR."
I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am.
"I'm Kevin Durant,  you know who I am. Y'all know who I am. That phrase alone with him coming out and dropping 38 with ease and barely driving to the basket to get the 38 is the reason why. I think this is the Kevin Durant everyone wants to see. That mamba mentality, that killer instinct. It's very rare that Kevin Durant plays like this. This dude was aggressive and that's what everyone want to see. We know what he can do and he know. He just don't change his game for no one. But, last night he did because I think deep down Patrick Beverley and the media got to him."
"Say what you want about Kevin Durant, but he is Kevin Durant."
"6’12 Kevin Durant shoots over 6’1 Patrick Beverly, shot appears to be unimpeded. Someone call ESPN, we have a breaking story."
ahh my old kd's https://www.sneakerfiles.com/nike-kevin-durant-collection/ those black and green/gold ones were like the first expensive basketball shoes I ever bought.. I'ma delete this in a sec gotta get off here..
"The referees weren't screwing around and all night we saw a ton of whistles, [while the flames of the KD-Beverly matchup continued to burn](https://i.imgur.com/jYLF8iP.gifv).  Boogie was often fed a lot inside in the first possessions of the game, but without him in the starting lineup we saw a change in approach where the Warriors have Bogut be involved in the early stages of plays [bringing up near the three point lane and make use of his passing and screening](https://i.imgur.com/yt7rp4o.gifv).  For all the talk there has been about the Clippers top-locking the Warriors and minimizing the amount of three point shots, the Warriors are hardly reliant on those to win a game. You can however have much better chances of not getting an avalanche of points in a couple of minutes.  Beverly did get two fouls out of Durant very quickly but Kerr chose to keep him on the court and he went right to continue his scoring. Durant often would get the ball coming out of a Bogut screen that would leave Beverly behind and he started the game hot, [with some ridiculously tough baskets](https://i.imgur.com/Y9fArOQ.gifv). He started 5/5, outscoring the opposing team in the first 6 minutes.  On the other end, the Warriors were locked in and busted out a zone-like defense in a [successful effort to stifle their offense](https://imgur.com/a/WJseaDF), taking advantage of the lack of consistent 3 point shooting from two backcourt players for the Clippers starting lineup, and a better paint protector in Bogut which they trust to stay on players should he go higher up. Looney is also reliable on the perimeter against smaller players so this creates a new way to use the big men rotation throughout.  It was a 10 point lead when Lou Williams and Harrell checked in, and the real chess match would begin. [And the Warriors weren't willing to give him an inch](https://i.imgur.com/fgGjGSI.gifv), tagging him from behind around the screens and collapsing hard on his drives. The Warriors would turn stops into a positive feedback loop and make 9 straight field goals to end the quarter, Curry already with 3 triples, and a 17 point lead. Fouls on Curry and KD were the only looming sign at this point.  ______________________________________________________  The split screen when second quarter began of Kerr saying the team needs to be focused on the Lou/Harrell PnR [while on the right screen that same play worked to perfection](https://i.imgur.com/J9xRO2V.gifv) is kinda funny. But even, despite the clear scoring of the second unit, the purpose is to basically contain enough it until KD/Steph gets back and [I trust Iggy and Bogut in that role](https://i.imgur.com/mvLtRTo.gifv) and Lou was barely noticeable for most of the quarter with Andre having a fantastic defensive game.  Smart on the part of Doc to have Gallo join this unit and he went [straight to the weak link in Cook](https://i.imgur.com/3PtwfFp.gifv). If the two main scoring options are playing at the same time, it's much harder to hide him away. Durant would quickly make his way back to the court after being given extra time to rest at the end of the previous quarter. Klay started to find his game with four straight makes ([and Dray out there playing chess](https://i.imgur.com/9RNIXHg.gifv)).  I'd be lying if [KD forgetting his man](https://i.imgur.com/NJQfEDb.gifv) and turning the ball over on the following play in what would be a 10-2 Clippers run didn't start to bring some cold sweats after game 2. Plus, Curry would soon sit after getting called for a third foul. But KD would stop any momentum dead with drawing multiple trips to the line (two and-1s) and [the Clippers faucet had been turned off once again](https://i.imgur.com/HQDZ7bJ.gifv). Great defense but also two long attempts from Gallo and one from Shamet that usually would go in but didn't here. Durant would end this half with 27 points and his team with a 21 point lead. ______________________________________________________   I'll try to be brief about the second half because... I mean...  Do you like missed shots? Man, than you'll love the start of this half. Gallinari just couldn't score today. They're challenged enough in regards to outside scoring and that makes it incredibly hard to compete. He was 1-11. The Warriors did try a lot of Dray creating from the post, usually towards a Klay or Steph cut. Even with Curry sitting on the bench for foul trouble once again, the Warriors kept charging ahead scoring. Durant making everything and it was a 30 point game before you know it.  A note on how Kerr sent a big and switchable lineup to end the third to contain any ""comeback tendencies"". The McKinnie-Iguodala-Draymond-Looney combo had an 85.4 defensive rating, even if only in 36 regular season minutes. In the playoffs it's 88.6 in the very small sample minutes - stats.nba.com numbers. But still, there's a clear defensive focus with this decision.  I couldn't bring myself to even focus during the 4th. After the embarrassing loss in game 2, this was the Warriors playing exactly like they wanted to play and Kevin Durant was a bulldozer going through LA.  ______________________________________________________  Other notes:  [Beverly staring at KD from the bench ahah](https://i.imgur.com/m8E8VuL.png).  Has the rest of the league realized already how reliable Looney has become? Because sometimes i forget it myself.  I'm just happy to have Bogut back in this team although i'm still scared that this might be too many minutes for his body to hold up, especially now that Cousins isn't playing a big chunk of them. Nice read once the Clippers get the switch they want (Steph on Gallinari) and [Bogut goes right in to smother him in a double while Dray makes sure Zubac doesn't become a free outlet at the rim.](https://i.imgur.com/4jpiLRp.gifv) In fact, Gallo would be smothered at any opportunity after his great scoring in game 2 and,as previously mentioned, [the Warriors won't ever hesitate helping from SGA or Beverly](https://i.imgur.com/RkYC7Ma.gifv).  Another thing Bogut did was have a lot of impact on offensive rebounds, [which the Clippers were very soft on avoiding](https://i.imgur.com/sk1hTy9.gifv).  Beverly is trying so hard to stick to KD that in [this play, when he doesn't switch to Iguodola, Harrell gets lost in no mans land between two Warrios players leading to an easy layup.](https://i.imgur.com/SeB5b5f.gifv) Green does help a lot standing so far from Draymond but not affecting a single passing lane."
"Someone said it best on here when they said Kevin Durant is the kid who beats you at video games on your own console and doesn't even know he is any good.    I bet at the time out KD was like ""damn I aint even kno I could hit dat""."
Kevin Durant got mad burner accounts.
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/beut90/the_warriors_are_everything_thats_right_with/  Just take a look at this thread. OP says “Kevin Durant went to Golden State to win championships. Lebron went to LA to film movies.” Lmao   Personally, I will never forget the coward move KD made in 2016. He’s too talented and great to get a pass for a move like that."
"I agree with all EXCEPT your KD comment. In what way was KD's move pure in the eyes of the basketball gods???  Leaving your team to go to the team that beat you in the WCF by one game so you can have an easy ride to a ring? I can't imagine ever having the mindset of doing that and I will never understand how anyone could do that and not feel like the smallest person in the world.   &amp;#x200B;  Also funny how KD with his burner account said ""it was just him and Russ...they were never going to win with those other cats"" OKC was ONE GAME AWAY from beating the Warriors in the WCF and then he claims they were never going to win??? Comical. No respect for KD at all. Disloyal, weak minded, most sensitive player ever. Literally laughed out loud the other night when he said to the reporter ""I know who I am. I'm Kevin Durant"" As he looked like he was about to burst into tears. LMAO  &amp;#x200B;  Oh and I'm not an OKC fan. And I also agree with the rest of this post. Thanks for tuning in."
"OKC never found the good shooting to surround Westbrook and Kevin Durant, and OKC still haven’t found good shooting surround Westbrook and PG."
"Kevin ""HULU HAS LIVE SPORTS"" Durant"
a 73 win team that added Kevin Durant is everything that's right with basketball?  Right...
This sub is trash.    How the fuck did kevin durant vecome this overrated for joining a 73 win win and being given unearned rings     I hope Giannis just joins golden state as a free agent. Fuck it right.  If losing to the best and than joining them makes you great than what a sad world we live in
there's a Kevin Durant in all of us

I'm Kevin durant.
"He is a top player when he does not face pressure, then he becomes bad. Kevin Durant could never come back down 3-1, he has no heart and doesn't care."
"I have nothing against the Warriors themselves.  They're doing exactly what every franchise should be doing.  The only two things I don't like are 1. I want the very best in the game to want to compete, this is not what Kevin Durant did. He's way way way too good to be riding coat tails.  I always felt he was too passive letting Westbrook often out shoot him, and now he went to a different situation where it appears he can't handle the pressure. He's a mentally weak player with some of the best talent I've ever seen, it's more of a shame really.  2. I feel the addition of Durant has robbed Curry of the opportunity to really cement his legacy.  The Warriors were already so good, and and another meet up with the Cavs would've been great.  Durant changed the entire equation. It's too easy for them now. Would any of the 90s Bulls teams been as fun if Oneal or Ewing decided competing was too hard and joined the Jordan? Would that not have diminished his greatness in someway?"

"Russ played with an MVP. A 6MOY. And a DPOY. At the same time. Without them, he literally has not won a single playoff series. Lemarcus Aldridge and Kevin Durant aren’t even in the same stratosphere. And OKC’s supporting cast was better."
"So if you replaced Kevin Durant with, say Khris Middleton, the team wouldn’t slide much?"
I once went to Chipotle and i noticed Kevin Durant at a table sitting with Rich Kleiman.  I then noticed K.D pick up his steak burrito and swallowed it whole. In one gulp. He then proceeded to leave the restaurant.
"Charles was fabulous offensively, but equally terribad defensively (when we are comparing him to other all time greats.  To talk about him as a top 10 player you not only have to have him ahead of players like Bird, Hakeem, Kobe and Garnett, you also have to have him over a bunch of players that I think he is very close in stature to: Dr J, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitski, Moses Malone, Kevin Durant.  I get that 'RINGZZ' is a stupid argument, but I don't really see a compelling counterargument presented in this thread.  [Here's](https://www.backpicks.com/2018/02/01/backpicks-goat-20-charles-barkley/) a pretty good writeup of Barkley's strngths and weaknesses that comes in the context of rating him 20th all time."

"kevin durant averaged 35/8/5.5 on 64 TS in 2017 and 29/10/7 on almost 66 TS the next year. there is literally no argument to be made that curry was more valuable in the finals either of those two years. and those times that you mention happened twice in game one in 2017, but if you watch the highlights you will see that the VAST majority of kevin durant's shots were highly contested but he made them anyways.   and regardless, KD has put up 30/5/6 on 61 TS against the heat when he was in OKC and way younger. curry has literally never played better than durant in the finals."
You cannot say that reffing is the best its ever been in the same season that kevin durant took 50 steps out of bounds with the ref looking directly at him and didnt call it.

"Your FO is fucking horrible and you’re wasting the arguable goat’s last seasons on fucking Lonzo ball and dollar tree Kevin Durant, you have zero chance"
It's facts. Kevin Durant carried the Thunder and kept Westbrook in check.   Now casual views finally understand why Durant couldn't win with those cats and moved on.
"Rockets:   Kevin Durant. Takes the best player off our biggest competition and provides everything we want at our weakest position (shooting and defense).  Other obvious choices being Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George. Klay Thompson as another great choice that doesn’t normally play Small Forward.  The ceiling from adding any of these guys is a championship."
Kevin Durant
"So if Kevin Durant plays badly in their next game, Steve Kerr should bench him? Of course not. Star players are going to play regardless if they are playing bad or not, and I thought a basketball connoisseur like yourself would know this. It’s on him for playing bad. The coach shouldn’t bench his best players in retaliation, thats not how it works.   I can’t believe this conversation started with you calling me dumb, you have no idea what you are talking about."

"Just reposting a comment I made over on r/nbadiscussion because there’s not a lot of traffic over there and I’d like to see what people over here have to say about it, if anything.   (from the Post game thread of Portland-OKC game 4 in OKC, Portland wins 111-98)  Anyway, great game last night. Dame was amazing, and his post game press conference made Russ and ‘Playoff P’ look so bad by comparison, with their immaturity and refusal to answer questions. George refusing to answer a question about why he dunked at the end of game three, give me a break, what a couple of man-children. He even looks at Russ and says “Should I answer?” And Russ says “be quiet” and then George says “next question.”  What a couple of clowns.  As a resident of Austin, Texas where Kevin Durant went to college, I can tell you that KD was never like that when he was in college. He was a nice guy. Then Westbrook rubbed off on him and we all saw him become the villain. Now he’s doing the exact same to George. It’s like guys are intimidated into following his lead, like they think he’s so much cooler than him that they’d better play along. Because with Russ it’s his way or the highway. Everyone saying the Thunder need to get a new coach that Russ will respect are giving Russ way too much credit. He doesn’t, and won’t respect anyone, outside maybe a few legends like MJ. He’s that egotistical. It goes beyond basketball. He has a god complex and anger issues. By the way, a god complex is an unshakable belief characterized by consistently inflated feelings of personal ability, privilege, or infallibility. Sound like Russ?  Aminu has impressed me all year and continues to impress. That play near the end of the game where he faked out Morris and another defender (Adams, I’m pretty sure) then went under both of them and found the easy layup was amazing. After that ball went through that net, Morris was entirely defeated. His body language (slumped shoulders, look of disbelief) showed what everyone else in that arena felt at that moment: This series is over.  I wonder when and how Aminu got the nickname Chief. Does he have Native American blood in him, perhaps? Just curious, cause it’s an awesome nickname, and for most good nicknames there’s a good story behind them.  Seeing Westbrook and Paul George fail is like soul food for me. Westbrook has been a dick for a long time. The recent backlash of people finally realizing how immature he is is long overdue and deserved.  I can’t believe how well Kanter and Leonard have been doing filling in for Nurk. I never expected Portland to win this series coming in. I think this shows that either A) he’s not nearly as important to Portland as many people thought, or B) Kanter is just much better than I thought. Either way, it makes me really happy. Good for Portland. Go win something.  I wonder how the rest of Nurk’s career will turn out. Big man coming back from a compound break of the tibia/fibula, will be very interesting to watch. I hope he learns some humility during his time off the court. He needs it. He needs to do some maturing. It might be exactly what he needs and he might come back better than ever with a newfound perspective on the game. That’s what I hope for him.  Awesome, awesome series here. If Portland wins and Denver wins, do the play each other next, assuming GSW and HOU finish out their series?"
"1) Lopez vs Draymond isnt relevant. What you need is bigs who can switch out on the perimeter vs GSWs off ball actions. Its too much to demand your guards 1 v1 to shut down Klay and Steph off ball from getting free without any help. Nobody even the best defenders can do that repeatedly.   [Capela spent 85 poss last year in the WCF either switched onto Klay or Steph for hte majority of the poss that's 12 poss a game](https://on.nba.com/2UrXYZK). He got switched onto Kevin Durant who they will run some off ball stuff with as well another 36 times. PJ Tucker who played tons of small ball 5 that series [was switched onto Steph 60 times that series and Klay 54 times that series](https://on.nba.com/2Uz3Gce). That's about 16+ times a game.   That gives you an idea of how much you need your center to be able to get out on the perimeter and switch onto Steph or Klay actions to really be able to defend GSW. Brook Lopez just aint doing that at all.   2) If you put Brook Lopez on Draymond with his drop coverage its also just an invitation to run DHO after DHO right at him and get 3s that way with good shooters. [ex of how you can attack Lopez in his drop stance to get a 3 for klay](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800377&amp;GameEventID=223&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Thompson%2027%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(12%20PTS)%20(Livingston%201%20AST)&amp;sct=plot) Lopez aint getting out that high to defend it.

Same idea here on a [return 3 from Steph just go at the big who is dropping hes not going to get over to prevent the 3](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800377&amp;GameEventID=514&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=MISS%20Curry%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot). Again put Brook Lopez [in a pick and roll even when Bledsoe is defending you becuase you know they wont switch with Lopez get a 3 off](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800166&amp;GameEventID=222&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=MISS%20Curry%2026%27%203PT%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot). The rare time [Lopez did switch onto Curry this is what it looked like](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800377&amp;GameEventID=290&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Curry%201%27%20Driving%20Finger%20Roll%20Layup%20(8%20PTS)&amp;sct=plot).   3) It is actually quite difficult to defend 3 really good 3 point shooters at once with their scheme and theyve rarely had to do it.   What the Bucks scheme frequently does is overload towards one side where the most dangerous off ball 3 point shooter is and force you to pass to the other. They excel at not allowing corner 3s in particular. Most teams this is fine often one of their most dangerous players is also one of their best shooters so when he drives there is at most one other legitimately dangerous off ball shooter to worry about. [Simple stuff like this just shade towards one side where PJ Tucker in the corner is the only real threat you are concerned with and concede a pick and pop 3 the other end](https://streamable.com/7mfjs)   If its Steph or KD driving and you have the other on one side and then Klay on the other that becomes impossible to do. Just put Klay on one end and Steph/KD on the other end. It changes the equation alot. [Look at Giannis helping Middleton on a KD drive when its Klay and Steph on the opposite end both of them you cant do this](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800166&amp;GameEventID=53&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=Thompson%20%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(3%20PTS)%20(Curry%202%20AST)&amp;sct=plot) You can force role players to take 3s they dont want to be taking when you can overload to just 1 dangerous off ball 3 point shooter. When a team has 2 dangerous 3 point off ball shooters at all times it becomes alot harder.   4) The thing that separates GSW from most teams also is GSW moves a TON off the ball. It's alot easier to track teams who are basically stagnant it was one of the keys to how Mil defended Hou the Rockets dont move off the ball it becomes alot easier to account for them at all times with how Milwaukee runs their defense. This is an ex [of what Im talking about just super basic off ball actions but they are constant with GSW and its enough where if you arent on top of your shit or constantly switching it will bite you in the ass](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800377&amp;GameEventID=553&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=MISS%20Thompson%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) Same idea [here](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021800377&amp;GameEventID=642&amp;Season=2018-19&amp;title=MISS%20Curry%2028%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot).

"The Clippers are a legit go-to scorer from being a serious threat. Maybe not championship level, but they can make a good run with someone like Kevin Durant."
"someone doesn't actually watch him play. try watching the game instead of just looking at highlights and you'd see that klay simply doesn't possess the handles to be a #1 option. ""WELL MAYBE HE CO-"" no. stop. it's pretty fucking clear that his offensive skillset isn't versatile enough to allow for that.   &gt;People weren't saying that Klay was inconsistent before KD arrived  yes they were lol. just because you were unable to see it doesn't mean everybody was as short-sighted as you. he's always been a streaky shooter because ... he's a shooter and shooting tends to be streaky.  he's not suddenly better than klay. i've said for a while that cj is clearly far better suited to be a #1 option over klay for years now. [remember when cj outperformed klay in a playoff series despite klay being surrounded by fucking STEPH CURRY AND KEVIN DURANT?](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2017-nba-western-conference-first-round-trail-blazers-vs-warriors.html)"
These cats can't win - Kevin Durant
He's better than Klay. We've literally never seen Klay for more than a game or two without the best gravity dude on the planet and/or Kevin Durant next to him. I'd say he's comfortably better than most of your bottom list too.
"Russ is neither right nor wrong. His job is to play ball. Media relations is a fringe duty but his performance on the mic doesn't matter as much on the court. The narrative would be different if they were winning rn. Same as KDs recent comment, ""I'm Kevin Durant"" the narrative is positive because he backed it up. Russ is just taking an L cuz he didn't back up his attitude this post season.  Lots of ballers are actually rude and but it's okay bse they back it up. Jordan, Garnett, Embiid, Kobe etc have done/said mean things that we overlooked  Just to make it clear, I don't think he's wrong and I loved it when Marshawn Lynch protested the media too. In the same vein, the ridicule he's getting for it is totally justified because you have to be humble of you can't back up your words/attitude with playoff wins."
"Kevin ""GOAT bottom"" Durant"
Let me introduce you to Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and James Harden"
Kevin Durant nigga wtf
"LeBron after losing to the Celtics in the second round in 2010, and again when he made The Decision.    Dirk Nowitzki losing to the We Believe Warriors in 2007.   Kevin Durant signing with the Warriors.   Harden in 2017 against the Spurs.   Dwight when he didn't sign with the Lakers."
You mean the guy that won the series for them against the Spurs?  Yeah man he was horrible.  I guess having Kevin Durant and now Paul George just isn't enough for him.
The myth of Russell Westbrook Triple Double God has overtaken the reality that he's a very good player with some weaknesses. Not every player is Kevin Durant or LeBron James.
"After a second straight 48-win season, the Pacers face a fascinating summer where more than half of their rotation hits free agency. Victor Oladipo, Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis are all under contract but President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard has the opportunity to figure out what he wants around them with a shocking amount of flexibility.  Indiana had significant spending power last season too and ended up focusing most of it on short-term contracts to keep the powder dry for this summer which lined up with when so many of their key players were already going to come off the books. After drafting Aaron Holiday and Alize Johnson, Pritchard signed Tyreke Evans and Kyle O’Quinn on one-year deals and his only significant long-term contract was Doug McDermott’s $22 million over three seasons. Another important part of Indiana’s offseason was agreeing to an extension with Turner that looks very team-friendly after his strong season. Unfortunately, Oladipo went down with a ruptured quadriceps tendon in January but they were able to sign a bought-out Wesley Matthews and the veteran helped stabilize the starting lineup to close the season. After being eliminated by the Boston Celtics, Pritchard and the Pacers have the choice between remaking their roster around their young core and bringing back a very successful group for another few years.  Here are three key storylines to watch for Indiana this offseason:  Cap Space vs. Retentions: Pritchard faces one of the most fascinating challenges in the entire league thanks to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Pacers can retain key contributors like Thaddeus Young, Bojan Bogdanovic and Cory Joseph using Bird rights but each of them carries a cap hold meant to be a placeholder that estimates how much that player will earn that season. Those exist so teams cannot game the system by clearing cap space, signing new talent and then re-signing their own free agents. While the Pacers absolutely could pick and choose who to retain, their only path to $30 million or more for new additions is letting their best players go with only the modest $4.8 million Room Mid-Level exception to use beyond that space.  As such, the fundamental choice will be whether the front office wants to run this back with largely the same talent and that poses additional challenges as their key free agents are in their late twenties or early thirties and thus at a different stage in their career and the aging curve than the 26-year old Victor Oladipo and 23-year old Turner. As a top-10 team in the league this year and even stronger than that when Oladipo was on the court, there are high stakes and serious variables to consider.  Thaddeus Young: Young is finally coming off the four-year, $50 million contract he signed with Brooklyn in 2015 before the cap explosion. He has thrived as a Pacer, but turns 31 shortly before free agency and will presumably be looking for his last big payday as a starting power forward. That makes life harder on Pritchard because Indiana has to deal with the volatility that comes with thirty front offices that each values players differently. All it takes is one or two prioritizing Young with their cap space to drive up his asking price in years, dollars or both. At the same time, Young has been an essential part of the Pacers’ defensive growth and success since McMillan took over and would be incredibly hard to replace. Bringing him back may require a significant commitment that likely runs beyond Oladipo’s contract that expires in 2021. It is an open question whether the best-case scenarios for Young in terms of salary are tolerable for the Pacers even with his importance to their competitiveness over the last few years.  Bojan Bogdanovic: Paralleling Young, the Pacers may face a brutal choice with Bogdanovic. The 30-year old averaged 20.9 points per game after the All-Star break and took on a much larger role after Oladipo’s injury, helping keep the team afloat offensively despite such a huge change. Forwards are incredibly in demand around the league and only four free-agent forwards had a higher scoring average over the full season: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Khris Middleton and Tobias Harris. At the same point, Pritchard and the front office could try to go in a different direction at small forward, presumably by bringing in a stronger defender, someone younger or both, depending on what is available to them and at what price.  Potential Free Agents: Thaddeus Young (unrestricted), Bojan Bogdanovic (unrestricted), Darren Collison (unrestricted), Cory Joseph (unrestricted), Tyreke Evans (unrestricted), Wesley Matthews (unrestricted), Kyle O’Quinn (unrestricted), Edmond Sumner ($1.6M team option) and Alize Johnson (partial guarantee)  Likely Summer of 2019 Cap Space: None  Realistic Maximum Summer of 2019 Cap Space (using $109M estimate): $45.8 million  2019 Draft Assets: Own first (No. 18) and second (No. 50) round picks  Potential Targets: It completely depends on which track they follow. Using cap space would open up a series of intriguing possibilities for free agents or potential trades. The top tier free agents will likely head elsewhere but Pritchard could make competitive offers for Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Nikola Mirotic, Danny Green or Al-Farouq Aminu depending on his vision for the new-look Pacers. They could also go after players under contract like rumored trade target Mike Conley and use the prospect of giving Memphis immediate savings to lower the amount of assets necessary to complete the deal.  Retaining free agents likely keeps the Pacers as an over the cap team, though they would probably be able to use the Mid-Level exception without running into the luxury tax. Depending on who sticks around, they could add depth in the form of Patrick Beverley or Seth Curry at guard, Wesley Matthews, Jeremy Lamb or Terrence Ross on the wing or one of the Morris twins at power forward. One intriguing option would be a competitive offer sheet for Mavericks big Maxi Kleber who can either play alongside Turner and Sabonis at power forward or slide in behind Turner at backup center if they decide to move Sabonis before his extension eligibility runs out.  Pressure Scale: 9. It is genuinely rare to see a team face this many big decisions while their two biggest foundational pieces are solidly under contract. Turner and Oladipo making a combined $39 million each of the next two seasons looks like an absolute bargain, but building a team around them is complicated and perilous because the Pacers likely only get one shot at making the right moves. Pritchard could be aggressive with the knowledge that he has centerpieces on both ends of the floor or see one of the league’s best teams early on only losing that place because of injury. What makes that choice significantly harder is that the front office will have to adjust on the fly due to what offers are made to both their own free agents and potential replacements in the first part of July. It is entirely possible that the seas part and a clear path opens up but it would not take much to make it very challenging to keep this roster together much less improve the team. Additionally, they face a complicated extension negotiation with Sabonis after his successful season and the possibility that they will need to figure out whether they want to keep both Turner and Sabonis beyond the 2019-20 season.  State of the Franchise: To Be Determined. A unique part of the Pacers’ offseason is that the cap holds for Young ($20.6 million) and Bogdanovic ($13.7 million) are within the reasonable range for their next contract, making it harder to game the system. Teams are allowed to use their space then re-sign their own free agents with Bird rights but that only makes sense if the player will make more than their hold, most common for restricted free agents with comparatively low holds. If the player’s new salary is lower than the hold, they should sign quickly to open up more space. If Pritchard wants to retain some of his best free agents, it is more likely than not that they will not have much spending power for new additions. After all, if Indiana re-signs just Young and Bogdanovic to deals near their holds and let every other free agent go they would only have about $12 million to work with, barely more than the Non-Taxpayer MLE. That reality makes it tough with the point guards as well because Holiday can step into a role but keeping Young and Bogdanovic would make it harder to add a new point guard, thus giving Collison and Joseph more leverage.  It may turn out that Pritchard can work out a sense of where their negotiations are going before July 1 as agents usually have an idea of what offers will be on the table. That information proves useful for the front office and players alike because some basic understandings could be formed in June, even if they were not totally binding in case something dramatic happened for either side. Knowledge is power and that is even more pertinent here because so much will happen all at once.  Indiana’s success after trading Paul George makes this a far more significant offseason. After all, they were in the mix at the top of the East when healthy and all four teams above them in the final standings could be facing wholesale changes with significant departures. What Pritchard and the front office want and how much they are willing to pay in order to get it will have a major effect on the franchise and the league for years to come."
Kevin Durant is good at basketball
Pop is in a position to be the old strict guy so showing a sense of humor tends to endear you to him because it's not something you usually expect from a guy like him in a position like he has. Russ' thing is he's a feisty scrappy competitor that will take on all comers. So when he gets in a pissy petulant verbal spat with a random reporter it comes off as beneath him and unnecessary. Doing his best Kevin Durant using an alt on Twitter impression.
So we should assume that a fake account made up by Kevin Durant in order to obscure Durant's true feelings from the public is actually an reliable window into Durant's true feelings?
"https://newsok.com/article/4744653/memphis-defense-has-knocked-kevin-durant-from-his-moorings?custom_click=rss&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed  I assume this is the article that he got up in arms with from Tramel? It’s critical of KD, but certainly not slanderous or beyond the pale. You can look up articles about any superstar and find this sort of commentary - LeBron was once (and probably still) pilloried by the media as a villain, as unclutch, as overrated. You don’t see him refusing to answer a reporter’s questions."
"You dont know how cap holds work. Dlo has a 21million cap hold. RHJ and Ed Davis also have 12 million in cap holds between them. But let's assume you let go of them and keep DLO.  Also you waive Shabazz Napier.   Now you only have 30million in cap space with your 2 first round picks in the books. Let's assume you're even willing to let go of those picks. You're still 3million short of the Max KD wants, and you still have to resign D'Angelo Russell. Only way it can happen is if you trick somebody into taking Allem Crabbe.    After all that, trading 3 or 4 rotation guys, the Nets could finally sign Kevin Durant and D'Angelo Russell. Probably with a little to spare for more free agents"
Something about having Kevin Durant makes his odds of winning a championship exponentially higher 😂😂😂   P.S the fact that you think Pat is the clippers second best player shows you watch wayyyyyyy too much ESPN
"Am I the only one who thinks KD is actually wrong about this? Like don't get me wrong he definitely does generate a lot of buzz, but if hypothetically Kevin Durant didn't exist, the media would just focus on the next great player or just shit on Russell Westbrook more. It's like any celebrity who thinks that Hollywood can't move on without them."
Kevin Durant seems like a great choice. Maybe even Harden or Ibaka!
"Kevin ""Jimmy Butler"" Durant"
"Dirk was the first 7 footer to shoot the 3. Before him guys his size were expected to take 90% of their shots within 10 feet of the basket. Dirk had the ability to “stretch” the floor by shooting at any distance and is largely credited for popularizing the position Stretch 4. Guys like Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis and Giannis have modeled their shooting after him. In 50 years when people look back at the game Dirk will be remembered as once of the sports most influential players."
"[Woj] All-Star Kevin Durant participated in media availability, a session that included him verbally challenging ESPN, TNT, and Fox Sports, league sources told ESPN. Durant was vociferous and emotional at times, targeting SAS/Bayless/Cowturd/Wright. Story soon on ESPN."
“You fucking need me! You can’t get clicks without me!” - Kevin Durant to the media
"Kevin Durant, make him take 30 shots a game"
Kevin Durant calling them a 8 seed certainly helped.
My stat is the warriors have won 3/4 last titles and haven’t lost a series with Kevin Durant and have home court so I’m taking them.
"It’s just an example, it’s hard to compare how hated players are based on jersey sales because people just buy the best players jerseys. Kevin Durant has the 9th most bought jersey and Derrick Rose has the 14th. Do you really think Rose is more hated than Durant?"
"Lets just agree to disagree.  You're defending the actions that made an NBA franchise feel they needed to intervene with Turner Sports.  I will never defend those actions.  Also, telling Kevin Durant to ""stay in his lane"" because he wasn't a member of the ""NBA Championship"" Club???    Yeah....you take that side...I'll stay on this side."
"Kevin ""fake news"" Durant"
"Oh, you mean when OKC had the all-time great Kevin Durant? Their playoff performances were better, but they never won it all. And Russ is not the same player he was in 2016, and certainly not in 2012.   Plus, Paul George is better than Westbrook. Westbrook is the second option now, but he treats himself like the first option. Look where is has gotten OKC this year and last year."
I remember saying if he couldn't win with Kevin Durant he wasn't going to change and win with anybody else and getting heat for it. Both his coaches have had to let him do his own thing and they've had to take flack for it as well.
"If I'm Kevin Durant, I don't think I pin my future on the growth/health/contributions of Russell or LeVert as the 2nd best player on my team for my age 30-34 seasons."
*Kevin Durant enters the chat*
"If winning is what matters, it's not even close between The Nets, Clippers, and Lakers.   Lakers are a dumpster fire, and Lebron's only getting worse.    Nets are good but would have to move some contracts and players off their books if they wanna make room for KD. Eroding some of the value they'd otherwise be adding to the team.   The Clippers are pretty likely to land Kawhi, and even if they don't they can easily keep most, or all, of their core rotation players while adding Kevin Durant. That's a 48 win team adding a top 5 player in the world, while having a ton of young players developing, and having assets to acquire more talent."
And secondly how fucking good is Kevin Durant that he made OKC a contender?  this ^
3.  Kevin Durant – Golden State Warriors  Salary/ Bonuses - $30 million  Endorsements - $53 million  Total Earnings - $65 million  confused
"I didn’t check Harden’s right away. I just assumed Kevin Durant already achieved it (article was from 2015).   But yeah, it’ll definitely be KD then Harden as the next two. They’re joining elite company."
&gt;Kevin Durant is currently on pace to achieve this with two more seasons.  Harden would do it in 3 more seasons
"Because he loved Seattle. And if the Sonics came back, the true redemption homecoming would be an option. After all, he wasn't drafted by the OKC Thunder, he was drafted by the Sonics.  Just look at the pre-season game the Warriors played in Seattle last year. Durant turned up rocking a Sonics legend throwback jersey, and while the rest of the Warriors obviously didn't really give a shit about a meaningless pre-season game, Kevin Durant was there to *put on a goddamn show* for the Seattle fans.  I honestly don't think he'd have left the Sonics. He didn't have enough reasons to stay in Oklahoma. He wouldn't have needed reasons to stay in Seattle."
"Against the Jazz?  Yes. The Thunder advance. Trivially.  OKC defense is adequate, but they can't score worth shit. That does not happen in 4/7 games to a team with Kevin Durant on it."
&gt; how fucking good is Kevin Durant that he made OKC a contender?  While coached by Scott Brooks and Billy Donovan.  *That* good.
"Almost all Sonics fans absolutely fucking hate the Thunder so I doubt it.  If Seattle gets the Sonics back, Kevin Durant will go back in a heartbeat."
"In no particular order  Bruno Caboclo, Alex Caruso, Meyers Leonard, Lebron James, Zion Williamson, Zhou Qi, Kevin Durant, James Harden"
"A top scorer who doesn't need the ball all the time like Durant, a dynamite 2 guard who can help playmaking and space the floor like Harden, and a stretch big who can play the 5, someone in the mold of a Serge Ibaka.  &amp;#x200B;  If that dream combination doesn't exist, he could use an elite PnR roll-man who can match Westbrook's energy (Harrell), a 3+D shooter (Danny Green), a playmaking and stretch wing who can defend competently (Ingles), and a stretch four who is also competent offensively  (Kevin Love, or Aaron Gordon for athleticism).  &amp;#x200B;  Westbrook  Green  Ingles  Love  Harrell  &amp;#x200B;  Tried to make it so Westbrook is the best player, and the team is within the realms of possibility. Won't win a title, but that's one of the top 5 scoring teams in the league."

" [http://www.espn.com/nba/story/\_/id/23766415/zach-lowe-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-dynasty-nba](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23766415/zach-lowe-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-dynasty-nba)      Diversifying his skillset in Oklahoma City prepared him for the more egalitarian offense in Golden State. The fit hasn't always been seamless. It veered off course at points this season. Curry's injuries prevented the two superstars from deepening their chemistry. Durant assumed more pick-and-roll duty, and ran isolations at the same rate as in his last season with the Thunder, per Second Spectrum tracking data. Many more of his baskets were unassisted. The Warriors saw too many possessions like this, from their dispiriting late-season loss in Indiana, after which Kerr famously ripped the team's effort:     Without Curry, the Warriors lost some ineffable rhythm. In December, when Curry missed almost a month with an ankle injury, Thompson, lowest of low-maintenance stars, grew concerned enough to request a private meeting with Kerr about the state of the offense, team sources say. (The meeting happened; Thompson left satisfied.)  Durant's commitment to the little things sometimes waned, as when he failed to box out J.R. Smith on a free throw in the final seconds of Game 1 against Cleveland. Kerr would point out these errors during film sessions, and over the long NBA winter, he went hard at Durant (and other players), sources say.  Durant withdrew. No one knew exactly why. ""He internalizes things,"" Fraser says. ""Sometimes he doesn't say much. It makes you wonder: 'Are you pissed at *me*?'""  Silent ambiguity was new. Golden State's three homegrown stars are easy to read. Curry really is the new-age Duncan -- selfless, even-keeled. Thompson is both oblivious and ultra-competitive. Green will let you know he is upset, and then it will pass.  Kerr eventually summoned Durant to a lunch in Portland on Feb. 14 to clear the air. ""'I don't want to lose you,'"" Durant remembers Kerr telling him. ""He had been drifting a bit,"" Kerr says. ""He's vulnerable. He's not a machine. I felt the need to reconnect.""  Both Kerr and Nash saw the drifting start over the summer, after Durant realized his first championship would not complete his life -- or silence every critic. He didn't work as often with Nash, or as productively, as planned.  ""He didn't have a great summer,"" Nash says. ""He was searching for what it all meant. He thought a championship would change everything, and found out it doesn't. He was not fulfilled. He didn't work out as much as he normally does.""  But Golden State has built the sort of culture that repairs fissures before they open wide. They didn't fray when Houston took a 3-2 lead behind a switch-everything defense that jostled them out of character, and into more Durant isolations. Durant slumped. The noise returned: Did he fit?  The team wasn't worried. There were no shouting matches, or players-only meetings. After losing in Houston in Game 5, Durant, Kleiman, and a Nike representative retired to the team's hotel, ordered room service, and relaxed. Kerr [privately predicted they would win their next six games](https://theathletic.com/386306/2018/06/09/a-title-defense-for-the-warriors-and-a-called-shot-for-steve-kerr/).  No one was upset about Durant's shot selection. He had gone one-on-one more in the previous series against New Orleans, per tracking data. The Warriors signed him precisely to counter switching defenses. They wanted the thing that made him different from them.  &amp;#x200B;     ""He was never supposed to come here and fit in,"" Draymond Green told ESPN.com after Game 3. ""I told him that from the beginning: 'You came here to stand out.' He came here because of the way Cleveland played us and how Houston plays us now. We knew he would start making shots. We are never gonna flip on each other.""  &amp;#x200B;     Durant's teammates understood they bore some responsibility for the Durant-centric stagnancy. They stood around him instead of cutting and screening with vigor. Even Curry, the deadliest and shiftiest off-ball star in history, strolled without purpose:"
"You're literally simplifying Westbrook has a player. It'd be like me saying: Kevin Durant is just a 6'11 athletic freak who plays basketball.   With Westbrook you're ignoring his valuable contributions to the Thunder such as his elite playmaking ability, great teammates, being one of only two players who can create their own shots on OKC, etc."
Russ had Kevin Durant on his team and still usually took the most shots.
Just want to point out that Kevin Durant scores ZERO points for the Thunder tonight. Go Sonics!
"The ""I'm Kevin Durant"" 3."
"come on, its kevin durant  &amp;#x200B;  you know who he is... yall know who he is  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  lol"
"Yes, as much as I hate him. It’s Kevin Durant."
There's this Kevin Durant fellow
Because westbrook did that with Kevin fucking Durant on his team? He hasn't done it without him
Kevin Durant is the height of a center so him
"Uh yeah, it doesn’t. The warriors have the two best shooters of their generation in Steph (undisputed goat shooter) and Klay “I’ll drop 60 in 3 quarters on 7 dribbles”Thompson. They have Kevin Durant whos one of the greatest scorers of all time and Draymond who is still a great defender. Oh and Iggy whos still a ridiculous defender. The 2011 heat had shit depth. It was just Bron, Wade, and Bosh. Had they played, they would have gotten annihilated. Had it been the 2013 Heat, then I think they still lose but take it to 6 games."
"I think it's important to look at what each person brought to the game, and how they acted during their time as one of the best players during their era. And for me, Kevin Durant ran completely counter to what you should do when you get crushed by a team in the WCF in the way that they did.   Stats and hardware are important, but all those guys in the top 10 have the stats and the hardware. What they didn't do is jump ship to an easy route to their hardware."
It does not look like OKC is going to win this first playoff series without Kevin Durant.
He makes a few in he first and thinks he’s Kevin Durant
👍 Kevin Durant 😂 Kevin Durant  ❤️ Kevin Durant
When are we gonna admit that Kevin Durant made the right choice?    Westbrook as a ball handler will never be enough to get a team a ring.
"Pg 1. Damian Lillard  2. Kyrie Irving 3. Stephen Curry 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kemba Walker  Sg 1. James Harden 2. Victor Oladipo 3. Bradley Beal 4. Luka Donicic 5. Klay Thompson   Sf 1. Kevin Durant 2. Lebron James 3. Paul George 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Jimmy butler  Pf 1. Giannis  2. (Kristaps Porzingas when healthy) 2. Blake griffin 3. Draymond Green 4. LaMarcus Aldridge  5. Tobias Harris   C 1. Joel emiid  2. Anthony Davis  3. Nikola Jokic 4. Karl Anthony towns  5. Rudy Gobert  I know all you steph curry stans are probably going crazy right now but think of it this way, if you took curry off the warriors, away from Draymond and klay who cover up his defensive issues, and put him on any of the other teams with those point guards ahead of them, would the new team hes on do better with him than say lillard, no. Would the celtics be doing better with him instead of kyrie, probably not since he isn't as good in the pick in roll. But for sure if you put lillard or kyrie on the warriors you would have a team that may never lose a game because they dont need the jump shot to be on so they can play good.   When I was making this list, I kept thinking, who do I want to have the ball at the end of the game to win it. So that's one of the reasons why klay is number 5 while others think he should be higher. Hes offensively limited as a scorer and creator. He is a defensive jj Reddick with a post game. The dude cant run a pick and roll, he cant go in iso and make a cross over and pull up, he doesn't have a step back, he cant create space for himself, that's why he and steph are running around screens on the sideline.   Let me know what you guys think and dont be ignorant. Thanks"
Is it sign Kevin Durant?
"""I'm Kevin Durant/You know who I am"" is my favorite KD quote ever"
Kevin Durant is currently the best player in the world
That’s Kevin Durant
"Sources are telling me the Knicks have shifted interest from Kevin Durant to Pascal ""Breaker of rims, king of spice, beloved, first of his name"" Siakam."
Kevin Durant? 😂😂😂😂
"People wanna talk about Kevin Durant, Lebron, or Playoff Rondo...its kinda rude and inconsiderate to not mention a certain player on the raptors that is built for the playoffs and can lead his team to the promise Land: Normal Powell"

Westbrook ""stone-walls"" this guy because of this article from 2014, which OPs source decided not to mention.

Kevin Durant has a wrap on his left cheek. “I’m good. I’m solid.”
Now they're saying Kevin Durant has joined the announcing team.
"Kevin ""pouty bitch"" Durant is a disgrace to the game.  GTFO"
Kevin Durant is the best player in the league.
I know people are going to read this thread title and laugh but I sure remember the most ridiculous bout of poor officiating this year and it had more to do with Kevin Durant and less to do with James Harden.
[Here ya go ](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/video/refs-mistakenly-call-kevin-durant-bounds-late-loss-vs-rockets)
"I feel like they peaked beginning of last June honestly. And it was a pretty fun, entertaining peak. I would say now curry is falling into a roll and their offense is more centered around Durant. But Curry’s role still creates open looks for everyone. Let’s draymond catch pass after a double or hedged screen and attack down hill to throw lobs, hit players for corner threes or finish at rim. Also Curry’s movement off screens creates scrambles and miscommunications and over playing leading to iggy/Klay/looney back door open lay ups. Then when defense locks in on Kevin curry can step up and hit a step back dagger off a switch to end a game. Overall it peaked last year. This year I think they all accepted slightly new roles completely and it’s working out pretty well. Durant might be peaking as a iso player and rim protector tho. And it’s amazing to watch."
You know who he is. He's kevin durant
"And how many of them were non-restricted free agents in 2016? Here's the full list of small forwards available that year  1. LeBron, who was clearly staying in Cleveland   1. Batum, who decided to stay with the Hornets four days before Durant made his decision   1. Parsons, who basically has not been able to play since then due to injuries   1. Bazemore, who decided to stay with the Hawks four days before Durant made his decision   1. Deng, who the Lakers way overpaid for 1. Matt Barnes, who ended up being waived part way through the year and actually did end up on the Warriors for a bit during the stretch where Durant was hurt and then retired at the end of the season 1. Jared Dudley, who agreed to sign with the Suns four days before Durant made his decision   1. Maurice Harkless, who was a restricted free agent Portland decided to keep 1. Lance Thomas , who isn't good enough to start on the Knicks 1. Wesley Johnson, who is a bench level player 1. Richard Jefferson, who had no plans to leave Cleveland and was 36 1. Solomon Hill, who agreed to sign with the Pelicans four days before Durant made his decision 1. Quincy Acy, who ended up in the d league for part of that year 1. Lance Stephenson, who played a total of 18 games that season for three different teams and who is not starter level 1. Alonzo Gee, who is a career journeyman backup who was out of the league after the 16-17 season where he only played 13 games 1. Luc Mbah a Moute, who decided to stay with the Clippers the day before Durant made his decision  And no, I am not the only one who thought this. For instance, here is the sbnation blurb on Barnes as part of their discussion of all the 2016 free agents:   &gt; If the Warriors don’t land Durant, they almost have to retain Barnes. Andre Iguodala is aging, and the Cavaliers and Thunder both proved the Warriors’ margin is slimmer than you’d think. (Cleveland proved there is no margin, actually.) Barnes is a cap-killer for a team like Golden State, but at a certain point there are no other options.  https://www.sbnation.com/2016/6/28/12029662/nba-free-agents-list-ranking-rumors-2016-kevin-durant"
"Despite committing to a 13 million dollar contract with the Golden State Warriors, Kevin Durant has indicated that he will speak to over half of the NBA teams regarding his destination next season."
"There are other small forwards in the NBA besides Kevin Durant and Harrison Barnes?  This year, Barnes made far more than both Draymond and Klay. That's the ridiculous contract he was being offered. The only people who think GSW was going to make him that same offer are Harrison Barnes and...you apparently."
Didn’t the Warriors literally [leak their report](https://www.complex.com/sports/2019/04/warriors-sent-tape-patrick-beverley-illegaly-defending-kevin-durant) about Patrick Beverley too...? Lol

Not sure anyone can.  That's a random thing to say but okay?
Kevin Durant is 7ft and can shoot over anyone
James Harden needs foul calls to be great. Kevin Durant only needs the ball.
the reason why that worked for the Cavs and this wouldn't work for the Rockets is that Harrison Barnes and Kevin Durant are *just slightly* different calibers of player
"Durant has been on fire since he said ""IM kevin durant, yall know who I am."""
Kevin Durant is inevitable
why didn't the clippers just think of having Kevin Durant?
*Kevin Durant has mutated!*
How do you defend Kevin Durant?

I'm starting to think signing Kevin Durant was a good decision by Bob Myers
"I mean personally I hate: Warriors, then Rockets, then 76ers.  But I actually kind of like the Celtics. Unlike the 76ers, their young core isn't cocky or douchey-seeming. And you know how Philly fans are (no offense Philly but you know it's true) At least Celtics, unlike the Rockets, play real basketball instead of how many threes can we throw up. And they don't have any Kevin Durant level traitors, even though a case could be made for Kyrie. But that's just my opinion, everyone feel free to tell me I'm wrong lol"
Hes Kevin Durant you know who he is
Do you think Kevin Durant is the only player who can easily score 40+ on Kawhi Leonard?
"Yeah but we're in the Kevin ""i'm Kevin Durant, you know who i am"" Durant era now"
"It's incredible to me that one of the least controversial topics in this series is KD.  Everyone's just like ""Yeah, he's Kevin Durant, I guess. And there he goes. Doing Kevin Durant things again."""
Only Kevin Durant can guard Kevin Durant.
No one can easily guard Kevin Durant
"Steph doesn’t get nearly the love unless you actually watch basketball critically. The fact is, he obstructs a gameplan more than just about anyone has ever. He’s a magnet for attention and draws stunts and defensive help throughout the entire possession regardless of whether he has the ball in his hands. Steph is still the cog that makes this offense work hands down.   The fact is, Kevin Durant is also extremely good at basketball and has a demonstrative mismatch on almost any 1 v 1 in the league. There’s a reason you almost NEVER see KD get trapped in double teams and traps, it’s because you can’t leave Steph (and klay tbf) alone roaming the 3pt line. It’s just match ups and since he can shoot over/get a decent shot over literally anyone in the league it makes it the best chance for a good shot.  But don’t get it twisted, this all happens because the warriors have two of the best shooters of all time just salivating for an open three if a team is stupid enough to double Durant."
would somebody arrest kevin durant already
He was 3rd that year and wasn’t even remotely close to second place Kevin Durant.  He doesn’t win MVP regardless of LeBron
Kevin Durant: +0 for the game  In the last minute: -Missed game clinching shot -Turnover with 17 seconds left in a one possesion game

"The more I watch kevin durant, the more positive I become that he is the only reason for a warriors dynasty. Quite literally without him golden state would have been 1-1 in the finals and ceded power to lebrons cavs, Okc (had durant stayed) or houston, but they most certainly would not have won a second (let alone a third or possibly fourth chip) . Draymond green is garbage now and has been the past year and a half if not longer and steph and klay are too hot and cold to carry a dynasty without KD. KD shoulda stayed in OKC and forced presti to trade Russ for another superstar...unfortunately he chose the warriors and despite being possibly the best player in the world the past three years, he will never get his full due, and in many peeps opinions doesnt deserve to after joining the warriors."
"Yes, we saw today. He's Kevin Durant, you know who he is."
"The best teams always get a huge amount of ""bandwagon fans"".    And Kevin Durant, arguably the 1st or 2nd best player in the league decided to join them a couple years ago and made a statement about taking ""The Hardest Road"" even though the Warriors had made it to the finals the previous 2 years. And made the team that much more unfair."

Kevin Durant.
How stacked the warriors are when you can have Steph shoot 12 shots and it's all good because you just defer to kevin fuckin durant
Kevin Durant is the best player in the NBA. Ice water in his veins. The Rockets are champs last year without him and they'd dominate the series this year without him.
"Underdog Kevin Durant carrying his unproven and doubted team. What a true Warrior, no one saw this outcome 💪💪💪"
Kevin Durant put both hands on the refs chest and nothing happened
"Hey folks, I'm that guy on the other thread. That was my first NBA game I have ever watched.  You are all really intense, holy shit.  A lot of people said it wasn't a good game, but I thought it was really really fun. If it only gets better, I'm really excited.  I learned I'm not suppose to like Golden State or Houston, but I really like Kevin Durant.  But like, fuck refs amirite? (I think I'm doing it right)."
"Kevin Durant must’ve smoked Steph klay and Dray with Quinn and Evans in practice, cause they fucking NEED him"
"Great game, this will be a great series.  Both teams played hard. The refs had a bad game which influenced both teams.  Gordon came to play and same goes to Kevin Durant.  Rockets need to figure out defensive rebounding and Warriors need to cut down turnovers.  Looking forward to next game  Go Rockets"
Kevin Durant seems to greatly increase your chances at winning basketball games.
Kevin Durant: Still good.  Refs: TBD.
HE IS KEVIN DURANT
In all seriousness  It really feels like Kevin Durant was the only lme to show up and play basketball today   That game was hard to watch either way

"&gt;During the 2017-18 regular season, 124 of Jokic’s 803 assists were thrown to Harris, which was more than any other Nugget despite him catching 1216 (!) fewer passes than Jamal Murray. Those 124 assists represented the same number of times Draymond Green fed Kevin Durant and were a more potent distribution service than Ben Simmons to Joel Embiid, Kyle Lowry to DeMar DeRozan, and John Wall to Bradley Beal."
I don't watch a ton of non-warrior ball but I can tell you both Curry and KD have refined their shot selection.  They aren't just taking dumb shots cuz they are Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  They're moving the ball and getting the best shot.  There is a difference between the shots KD is taking this year and what he was taking last year against Houston.    KD has been a somewhat awkward fit up until now.  Right now he is beautifully integrated into the system and it makes everyone else better.
&gt;Their actual performances in numerous games says otherwise so...  Steph blew it in 2016. So did Kevin Durant.
This is the Who's Tommy.   He's blind and gets abused by Cousin Kevin (Durant).
"Don't ya know, that's all it took to get KD here. Any other team or player could've done the same and got KD, all they needed was a cell phone and a random parking lot, and boom. One Kevin Durant, please."

I mean they have Kevin Durant of course they’ll make it
Harden actually had one of his better individual defensive showings this year last night [he not PJ Tucker was the main guy to guard Kevin Durant and he did it well](https://on.nba.com/2IVAbQH)

I don't think he's a choker but he also isn't the best player in the league (which he was during the regular season this year and last). He has a clear decline from regular season to playoffs every year. Harden needs to be scoring 36 points on high efficiency to beat the Warriors but it looks like that just isn't happening.  &amp;#x200B;  I also don't think it's fair to say the Rockets are choking when Kevin Durant joined a 73 win team and killed competitive balance in the league. If he had normal opponents he career track would likely look very different.
"&gt;Nothing you said comes close to disproving that.  Nothing the OP said *proved* his assertion.  It's not up to me to disprove an assertion.  He has to make that argument.  And nothing he said came close to proving his argument.  He just said things.  The Warriors would STILL win championships without Dray.  And now let me make my argument.  How do I know this?  Because [this](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Draymond+Green&amp;player_id2_select=Draymond+Green&amp;player_id2=greendr01&amp;idx=players).  Pure, raw statistics.  Durant's offensive win share *AND* defensive win share is well above Draymond.  You're going to have to make a good argument as to why losing Dray would end the dynasty over losing someone like Durant."
"[Idk, doesn't look like Bev to me](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/video/kevin-durant-receives-third-technical-foul-nba-playoffs-vs-clippers)"
Shit....I’m rooting for GSW and Kevin fucking Durant over these dudes. It’s so bad I’m rooting for KD to win in the playoffs. My salt over that is overshadowed by my desire to see the game played right.  Dame and the Blazers whipped the shit out of OKC but they did it the right way. Just gotta shrug and respect it. This foul-drawing shit is baaad.
"Kevin ""not snek"" Durant"
"Kevin Durant, not LeBron James, is the most unstoppable player since Jordan.  This LeBron James praise is hilarious. KD is and will always be better in the playoffs than LeBron James, who is not even in the playoffs. KD is on a team with 3 other All-Stars, yet they still are in trouble without him in the playoffs. In OKC, he led the team to WCF four times. There is a reason why his efficiency jumped joining the Warriors - he has better shooters around him. LeBron had a playoff run last year, which is overrated - he beat a 5th-seeded Pacers squad in merely 7 games, known playoff chokers and a team without its two veteran All-Stars in 7. His team? Kevin Love and a bunch of savvy playoff veterans. He had an okay playoff run in the East. KD is better. Show some respect."
"Didn’t realize KD made the playoffs all by himself, amazingly unlucky for the warriors to have every available player suffer season-ending injuries like that! What a hero, isn’t Kevin Durant just the greatest?"
JJ reddick for three!!!!  I’m being told that it was actually Kevin Durant for a layup.
"This was hard to read given how untrue the last part is:   &gt; The same is true for the Warriors, who moan just as much. Green is the worst offender. Curry isn’t much better, though his pettiness comes with a wink and a nod and a smile. The only one of their star players who doesn’t get caught up in all the antics is reigning finals MVP, Kevin Durant, who stands off in the corner somewhere sulking about something else."
"Warriors can go something like Livingston + Draymond Green + Pick, sign and trade on both sides for max contracts on the PFs (as both will get it) to make the money work. Of course, it would mean that the NBA would be cancelled for the season, and a starting five of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis will never be seen even in theory, as it would cause a salt-singularity focused around r/nba which encompasses that particular reality."
"To be fair, Kevin Harlan called James Harden “Durant” twice last night."
"No, and it doesn't even have to do with him joining the Warriors, and it won't change even if he joins the Knicks  Dude is simply not as good as those actually in the GOAT discussion, plain and simple.  LeBron was one of the greatest playmakers AND most unstoppable scorers ever. Jordan was probably the best scorer ever, and shockingly one of the best perimeter defenders ever.  Even those on the fringes are better than him at more than one thing -- Kareem was an excellent offensive weapon and amazing rebounder, Shaq was the most dominant post player ever, Wilt was basically a human cheat code who was good at everything, etc.  Only advantage Kevin Durant really has above everyone else is his efficiency at scoring from all levels, but his scoring's not even as explosive/unstoppable as Jordan's is. He's historically been only _okay_ at everything else -- decent rebounder, decent passer, decent defender, etc. but not quite elite like those above him.  Unless he magically can average like 40ppg for 5 more years or something AND do it in the playoffs AND sustain some deep playoff runs, then he'd MAYBE have a chance at being in the GOAT discussion.  But as of right now, I think at most he ends his career being a top 15 or so player all-time."
"What's fucking hilarious is that you assume I'm a Rockets fan when I've been a Spurs fan since I was 8. And even if I WAS a Rockets fan, it doesn't discredit my point that BAD OFFICIATING HURTS THE LEAGUE. It undermines competitiveness and takes the focus away from competition and results... you want proof, just look at this thread, instead of discussion winners and losers, we are bickering over missed calls.  As for this bit  &gt;And if an organization is going to focus their film analysis efforts on trying to prove that refs screwed them rather than actual gameplanning or scouting, they're going to lose,   If you;re too daft to understand that...  &gt;[Amick] Since the tallies from the NBA’s 48 minute report are now officially a thing,   THE NBA HEAD OFFICE ARE THE ONES DOING THE FILM ANALYSIS ON THESE REPORTS... than you my friend are the one...  &gt;acting like the most worthless little shit   Clearly the NBA sees this as a NEGATIVE seeing as how they are OFFICIALLY acknowledging and addressing this shit...   My god dude. Take a breath my friend, acknowledging that bad officiating hurts the league isn't rocket science. &lt;har har... It's fucking common sense. We should all be striving to get better officiated games and evenly called matches... if you think you need a competitive advantage of getting calls go your way, you deserve an *asterisk next to those w's.    Let me guess... your favourite player is Kevin Durant and you think he's got a bigger legacy than LeBron James?"
Kevin Durant is mad since Patrick Beverly guarded him lol
"Kevin Durant is 100% needed, and he would be an absolute fool to join the Knicks (unless he is past the point of caring about winning)  The warriors feel like the 04 Lakers to me. Very beatable"

You're just a stupid propaganda account playing stupid because what you do is stupid and immoral."

"Joined in progress.  Kevin Harlan called the play as “into Capela who collides with Durant, with a foul on KD”.  https://youtu.be/xs1sW6V3QV8  12:35"
"I don't think they should call it unless there's a decision made in the offseason, teams are informed of it, and the refs ease the players into it as the season goes along. So I disagree with what you're saying about a bullshit no call.  That being said, I have never seen anything like Kevin Durant when it comes to the extent that he carries the basketball almost every possession that he dribbles it. No one else comes close. It's something that's always stood out to me."
Don’t talk about Kevin Durant that way bruh
Neither of those players are underrated. Also Kevin Durant is probably the main reason GS is up 2-0 lol the dude is a human flamethrower.
stands for Kevin Durant for me.
No one:  Literally no one:  Kevin Durant: you know who I am
"""Built"" doesn't include Kevin Durant making the literal softest move in NBA history."
"Fine, asterisks all around. But really though, the Kevin Durant move has been the least enjoyable free agent move because it has pretty much made every year just an academic exercise in who can get an MVP and come in 2nd and 3rd place."
Kevin Durant and Steph Curry really don’t deal with the “inbound the ball and let them foul you” part of winning well at all and teams know it.
I mean what did you wanted them to do? Not sign Kevin fucking Durant?
“OMG is that Kevin Durant???”

"The warriors... Mostly Kevin Durant, I suppose, have ruined the NBA. It sucks because it's wasting quality talent not only on their team - but across the NBA. It would be cool to see Curry and Thompson vs. Harden and Paul. And thank God boogie ain't playin, am I right fellas?! But yea throw me an up vote for a good fuck you to all these bitches that root for this joke team. Warriors 'fans' - @ me if you want to get owned. LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RAWKETS"
I can continue this as long as you want.  You can't even muster a coherent thought.  You've devolved into using monosyllabic words.  Where's your fire?  Where have your balls gone?  Don't you want to show to anyone reading this that you're right?  That I'm a Russian propagandist forwarding Vladimir Putin's opinions on Kevin Durant and James Harden?
Kevin Durant tends to do that to defenses.
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant is 100% the better player man

A question for Warriors fans — if you guys saw a bunch of bullies beating up a smaller kid would you join the bullies or help the kid?  This has nothing to do with your team and Kevin Durant at all.
"Now that it’s been a few years, are people more or less okay with MVP Kevin “bitchass” Durant joining the greatest regular season team of all time after blowing a 3-1 lead to them in the playoffs?"
You love to see it from Kevin I'm Kevin Durant Durant
Yo this Kevin Durant guy is pretty good imo
"Why would winning somewhere else out-weigh breaking everything he's built for himself and with his city/team in Golden State? He's already winning as much as he possibly can, at the biggest basketball stage in the world, in front of a very good market in an amazing area of the USA.   Does Kevin Durant give you the impression that he wants to be credited for bringing the Knicks to the 8th seed? That he wants to move?  There's a 0 percent chance that KD moves, unless some wild, unexpected, totally unrelated shit happens that nobody yet has the scoop on. Like finding Curry sucking on the toes of his woman or something."
Proletariat Kevin Durant
"&gt;Part of sports to a lot of people is believing that anyone can be a pro.  Yes, apart from the PEDs, I'm sure that the dream of being 6'5""+, and capable of playing NBA minutes at NBA speed, against NBA players, was otherwise realistic.  In seriousness, I don't think you've quite hit the mark. Instead, I think it's the notion that there's something unfair about using PEDs - as in it makes it impossible to attain the highest levels without it when some players are using. There's some validity to that argument, although I don't think it will mean that all players need to use PEDs (for example Kevin Durant doesn't have a ton of meat on his bones but copes just fine)."

"You really think Dolan came down to the graphics department and said ""put Kevin Durant in the season ticket promotion""?  The idea that it wasn't on purpose is total bs, but thinking Dolan made that call seems ridiculous."
Reminder that Kevin Durant averaged this exact line in the FINALS.
"How’s his image tarnished if they win? Is the NBA going to rescind his championships and Finals MVP’s?  “Sorry Kevin, but bellsofwar3 tells us that actually Harden should have led the Rockets to a Championship last year, and that you’re not a good basketball player. So I guess we’ll just be taking your trophies back.”  Man, it’s been a week since Houston wasn’t able to win game 6, at home, with a full lineup, and an injured Durant, and you’re still grumbling?  Didn’t I already tell you that humility is one of the defining traits of the intelligent?"
Things Kevin Durant does nobody has done either. It’s more likely another Steph type player pop up than another KD. There’s aren’t 7 foot guys with guard skills and can shoot like that. He’s the first and probably last.
&gt;You know what they call people who leave when things go south?  Kevin Durant?
"Kemba Walker - $3  Danny Green - $1  Lebron James - $5  Marcus Morris - $1  Joel Embiid - $5  &amp;#x200B;  Remember Shaq/Kobe? This lineup is akin to that one.   **Offense:** LBJ would be the primary ball handler surrounded by great shooters. Embiid can also carry that load by posting up and passing it out when he gets double teamed and unlike Simmons, LBJ can shoot.  **Defense:** Embiid is one of the best rim protectors so that is covered. On the perimeter, I have Green who is known for is defense and can cover for Kemba's occasional mistakes. Lastly, I have the rough Morris, who can cover for LBJ's mishaps.   &amp;#x200B;  Or alternatively,  &amp;#x200B;  Rajon Rondo - $1  Jrue Holiday - $3  Kevin Durant - $5  Al Horford - #1  Anthony Davis - $5"
Funny thing is he was thought of as a Kevin durant type sf who can score off the dribble and stuff going to UCLA. Never quite happened

"The warriors didn't need Kevin Durant, they needed him off the OKC team."
It's almost as if they didn't need Kevin Durant to join their team.
"You know they say that all teams are created equal, but you look at Steph and you look at Zach Collins and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another player, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But Steph's a genetic freak and he's not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat him. Then you add Klay Thompson to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way with Kevin Durant, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but Steph, Steph got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Zach Collins KNOWS he can't beat him and he's not even gonna try!  So Zach Collins, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus Steph's 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning in the Western Conference Finals. But then you take Steph's 75% chance of winning, if they were to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, Steph got 141 2/3 chance of winning. See Zach, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Portland."
"It's almost unfair how good this team is.  3 All NBA defenders, the best shooting back court of all time, and Kevin Durant....  I commend all the teams for really giving them a fight, but man, this team is something else."
Did you just really say that Glen Rice was a better shooter than Kevin Durant ? Do you really hate the guy that much ?
"This the same Finals series that featured *Kevin Durant* getting wide open layups because Steph had the ball?  If you're so smart, use points created or something that accounts for what Curry is recognized for.  Instead you're making a sophomoric argument where you're fitting data to your argument."
"I feel like Tatum's problem is that his complementary skills are underrated, but his star skills are overrated.  He is not a great shot creator.  He hasn't yet shown the skills of a primary option.  Not yet a PnR ball handler/Post scorer/iso scorer of the level you need to be to lead an offense.  He might develop this skills, as he is pretty physically gifted, can dribble well, and can shoot off the dribble.  But he isn't there right now.  But he is a solid defender and spot-up shooter, albeit inconsistent, and is good at attacking closeouts off the dribble.  Very good as a complementary option on the wing.  He is more like Luol Deng than Kevin Durant.  And that isn't some terrible thing, that is a really good player.  He is already one of the most effective players his age in the entire league.  If he is gonna be a star, he has to start improving quickly, most stars develop quite rapidly until they are a star.  Excluding point guards, not many players plateau at a level lower than stardom and become a star.  If Boston sees him as a future star, they should make him a major playmaking option next season.  He should be their lead playmaking wing if that is the case.  If he is on the star track, he probably should be progressing their pretty quickly."
"I like how you say your opinion as fact like it means anything.  How about this: I think they would have won without KD in game 4 and game 6. Why do I think this? Because the *fact* is the Warriors have won 30 of their last 31 games without KD and with Steph, a 97% win rate.  https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/old-Steph-Curry-Trail-Blazers-Kevin-Durant-return-13846145.php?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app"
"I know I am biased, but I want to defend why many of us C's fans thought/think he is a generational talent last year.  Comparing Tatum’s rookie year to other players who played the majority of their rookie season as a teenager. Here is a list of some of the better players, (in no particular order):  Lebron James Kobe Bryant Giannis Antetokounmpo Tracy McGrady Carmelo Anthony Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal Kevin Durant Tony Parker Andrew Wiggins Devin Booker  Here is where Tatum ranked in counting stats:  PPG = tied for 6th APG = 10th TRB/G = 3rd STL/G = 6th BLK/G = 5th TOV/G = 2nd  Counting stats placed Tatum in the middle of this pack of players. He’s not the best, but not the worst either.  Here is where Tatum ranked in shooting:  FG% = 1st 3P% = 1st FT% = 4th TS% = 1st eFG% = 1st  There is no doubt that Tatum was the best shooter out of all these players.   Here is where Tatum ranked in some advanced stats:  WS = 1st OWS = 3rd DWS = 1st VORP = 3rd BPM = 3rd OBPM = 7th DBPM = 1st ORTG = 1st DRTG = 2nd TOV% = 1st TRB% = 4th AST% = 10th STL% = 7th BLK% = 3rd  Advanced stats absolutely loved Tatum, especially on the defensive side of the ball.  Summary: Among the elite players that had rookie seasons as teenagers, Tatum definitely looked like he belonged. Offensively, Tatum’s shooting was been better than anyone on this list and Tatum was also the best at taking care of the ball. His assists numbers are the worst among the bunch. Defensively, advanced stats love him above the rest.   Admittedly he should not have been ""untouchable"" in an AD trade and that is where the delusion started. However, to have high hopes of him being a generational talent was not unfounded.   In my mind, this year was a sophomore slump and he could be back to being a generational talent projection next year."
Lmfao. Thanks for providing me two shots in which his team was up 2-0 to begin with. What was the last thing Kevin Durant did before he slithered to Golden State?
"def not the mvp though. def didn't sacrifice his game for the success of Kevin Durant.    Def just avg and overrated.      people are so stupid. This guy would WRECK every year if he decided to be ""harden"" and take as many shots as he wanted, but the guy wants to WIN a championship and he understood that by getting KD to be the ""king"" of the team, that was how they were going to win.   But now he is like :gimme the damn rock and lemme be me""   he would be MVP every year if he wanted to be..instead he wants to win with the TEAM.   How anyone can vote for harden over Curry is beyond me. But the NBA is stupid"
"Yeah, I had forgotten they played last night. 3 and a half games.    You admitting to them needing each other to win the title. That’s the end of our discussion.  Teams aren’t trying to be a top 4 team that regularly makes the finals. They want to be *the* top team that wins the title every year.   Kevin Durant didn’t wait around for his team to build him a dynasty. He joined one, and I don’t think that’s soft.   I don’t understand. You’re soft for making the smart choice to further your career? What should he have done? What contender should have Durant signed with to make you happy? Some players never win a title, and the chance to win multiple is there for him. He would’ve been soft for not taking it in fear of the media calling him out."
"No. See: Durant, Kevin"
They could have beaten the 2017 Cavs with an improved Harrison Barnes.....instead they got the greatest version of Harrison Barnes x 10 in Kevin Durant.
"They’re undefeated in the playoffs without Kevin Durant. They don’t need him.  He had a 3-1 lead over the team he joined, played terribly throughout the remainder of series and choked. Then joined the team he choked against.  I guess I don’t disagree on your thoughts concerning OKC’s management, but they built a team that had a 3-1 lead on the eventual champions.   I’m not saying his accomplishments need an asterisk, but the guy pulled the softest move in maybe the history of major sports. It’s hard to forget that. Joining the team you lost to...when you were one game away from leading your former team over the very team you joined....crazy."
"To be fair this was all started by 2 nephews on the phone after 2016 finals G7:  Draymond Nephew Green: Yo KD Warriors can't possibly win without you so you have to join us  Kevin Nephew Durant: Oh you right, that's a reasonable take, I'll pack my bags  So it's only reasonable that every Warriors take since then must be done by a nephew"

Are you sure? Golden State has won their last 2 1/2 games w/o Kevin Durant in the playoffs
"&gt; $5 Evan Turner , $4 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George  FTFY"
"Whoa, why is kevin durant in the $5 list with lebron, kawhi, giannis, and evan turner?"
"&gt;$5 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, **Evan Turner**"
"&gt; NBA measurements are with shoes so he’ll be listed at 7’7  Actually, players get to choose if they want to be listed with or without shoes height. Most players choose to be listed at ""with shoes"" height, but some 7 footers choose to be listed withOUT shoes (probably so they don't seem too freakish).  A famous example is Kevin Durant. [He was measured at 6'9"" without shoes at the combine](https://stats.nba.com/draft/combine-anthro/#!?SeasonYear=2007-08), and that's what he chose to be listed at, even though his with-shoes height was 6'10.25"" (and he probably grew a bit since the combine).  Another random example is that Jeremy Lin is listed at without shoes height of 6'3"". He would actually be about 6'4""-6'5"" with shoes. (His situation may be a result of him not being at the combine, so they didn't have a ""with shoes"" height for him)."
"I think it's getting blown out of proportion about the Warriors play without KD. Yes, we get to see Steph with higher usage as well as Klay, but it's ridiculous to think that the Warriors are actually better with Kevin Durant.   He's Kevin fucking Durant. He makes any team better and harder to guard when you have a 7 foot guy who can take a pull up jumper at will. Some of the comments I've read makes you think KD is as valuable as Melo on OKC."
"Now I’m not usually the type to fire off hot-takes, but Kevin Durant does not make the Warriors worse."
30-1 in their last 31 with Steph but without KD. Here’s SF newspaper saying 28-1 before Portland series https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/old-Steph-Curry-Trail-Blazers-Kevin-Durant-return-13846145.php
"Dude you're right. Steph did not outplay harden. No statistics or even any eye test would say otherwise. That's what the warriors bank on though. That was the whole point of hurting or bench to get Kevin fucking Durant. Curry did not outplay harden in any sense. He stepped up when it mattered and that's amazing as a warriors fan. But in the end it was the warriors front office that won that series. It must be incredibly frustrating but your front office didn't keep the players necessary to stop our team. I hope for one, harden keeps playing like he played in that series cause he wasn't playing like ""Hitler"" that r/NBA knows him for and two Houston figured it a way to put a team together that can replicate a series as exciting and suspenseful as the one we got to see this year because as dramatic and irritating to watch as it was at times, it was genuinely more entertaining than most series we've seen in recent years and is what keeps me coming back to watch as an NBA fan."
When the game ended it did cut to Kevin Durant alone in the dark tunnel with a hoodie on and covering his face with sad music playing in he background
Kevin Durant is a superstar not a 3 and D player
"That's not the point. Him being more efficient than Westbrook should be a given. Kevin Durant doesn't get bonus points for being more efficient than Russell Westbrook. The fact that he was shooting sub 40% from the field and sub 30% from 3 is damning. Her performed well below standard, when he should've been playing ABOVE standard."
Is it just me or did Durant ruin how much greater Curry could’ve been. Warriors are unstoppable with Durant but they’d still be unstoppable with Curry. Curry would have more season MVPs and finals MVP if Kevin Durant didn’t decide to piggyback of Curry’s success.
"Draymond did say this to KD at one point. Also called him a bitch.  &gt; Green called Durant a “bitch” multiple times, sources said. In a summarized version, sources said Green shouted, “You’re a bitch and you know you’re a bitch.” The rhetoric, sources said, continued even when Kerr attempted to direct the team’s attention to his whiteboard.   ...   &gt; Green blurted to Durant something along the lines of, “We don’t need you. We won without you. Leave,” sources said.   https://www.slamonline.com/nba/report-draymond-green-told-kevin-durant-won-without-leave/"
"&gt;Why is Durant seen as being the best player in the NBA?  That's the narrative the media wants to push on basketball fans and if the media repeats something long enough the public starts to believe it and parrot the very same talking points the media uses even though people love saying how they hate and don't trust the media.   &gt;but it seems weird to me that KD is often regarded as it now vs other players (Kawhi, Giannis, Harden, etc).   Saying Durant, Mr. Unreliable, Mr. Sensitive is the best player in the NBA is great for discussion and ratings. You have ~~Lakers~~ Warriors fans saying Steph is better, Durant needed to join the very same team he choked away a 3-1 conference finals lead to in order to win his first ring by riding Steph's and Klay's coattails. Last year in the conference finals right up to the time Chris Paul had his routine playoff ending injury Durant was conspicuously silent in the series when the Warriors were down 3-2 and the heat was on, once Paul had his injury Durant started playing better because the pressure is off the Warriors because everyone knows Rockets aint winning a thing with Harden as the main player.   Why would the NBA want to push Kawhi as the best player in the league? This guy couldn't hack it in San Antonio because a sissy Frenchman and other players on his team called him out for not playing hurt, he sulked and requested a trade. Kawhi is all the way in Toronto and has the personality of a ball rack, he wont make a good face of the league. Giannis, is not there yet, if he had a great or a very good number two player by his side, they make some deep playoff runs then once the media gets its marching orders from the NBA they'll start acting like he's the second coming.   Harden, the guy relies on the whistle too much during the regular season and when refs swallow their whistles in the playoffs and let players be more physical we see how Harden comes up small because the refs are not going to bail him out by calling a ticky-tack foul just because a player bumped into him when trying to draw a foul.   &gt;Like obviously he is super great, but doesn't the fact that he plays on the Warriors with the likes of Steph and Klay mean that he basically has it WAY easier to showcase his skills compared to other superstars because teams can't afford to double team him?  Yes, the warriors are like 23-1 (or something like that) when the Warriors play with Steph but Durant is out but when Durant is playing and Steph is out the warriors are like .500. At the end of the day calling Durant the best player in the league has the most and sexiest storylines you can get from it, whose team is it really, Durant's or Curry's? Did the Warriors even need Durant? How are Steph and Klay going to play without Durant? Are the Warriors better without Durant because Steph and Klay now do not need to coddle Durant and make sure Durant ""gets his touches""?   &gt;I guess what I'm saying is until Kevin goes to another team (hopefully this off-season haha) we can't really declare him the best..  They can declare Durant the best but he wont be the best, LeBron is still better than him, Leonard is better than him, hell, Steph is better than Durant and when the pressure is on Klay is a hell of a lot better than Durant. In OKC back in 2016, Klay hit like what, 9 three pointers to bring the Warriors down from behind to win the game? Durant aint doing that when there is a lot of pressure on him which is why he choked away a 3-1 series lead, had to tuck in his tail and skulked on over to the Warriors."
Dont you ever disrespect Kevin Durant like that ever again. Kevin Durant is MILES. YES MILES ahead of whoever is in second place
Because I like Kevin Durant and think he’s the best player in the nba
"The other guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about at all. Graded muscle tears and their respective times to return are estimates based on an estimate of total muscle fiber damage, and these goalposts shift frequently in medicine. For instance for a long time a grade 3 tear was defined as complete severance of one part of the muscle from another, whereas grade 2 was just “more than a small tear”, and a small tear was grade 1. [This study](https://www.google.com/amp/s/warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/09/kevin-durant-mri-results-mild-calf-strain-to-be-re-evaluated-in-a-week/amp/) showed that those definitions can be changed and that classifying these injuries is simply a way of helping the patient estimate time to full health, but those estimates even now vary widely with grades. It’s entirely possible to sustain a calf injury that takes 2-3 weeks to return from, same as it’s possible to have a calf injury that heals fully in 10 days, or 6 months. I have no clue what KD’s is though he could be out for fuck knows how long. Apparently we only know what the medical staff of the Warriors tells us, which could be accurate or skewed for a PR reason (the narrative that it’s serious and they don’t want to demoralize the Warriors by telling them their best player is out for the rest of the playoffs)  This is why I asked for a source from a medical professional other than the vague update the Warriors released, not just a vague insult about not having common sense."
Cuzz his name Kevin Durant
Just goes to show how the Warriors have absolutely no need for Kevin Durant. Weakest move in NBA history. 🐍🐍🐍
You got a source on that? The only report I’ve seen said it’s “mild” implying grade 1 tear.   [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/09/kevin-durant-mri-results-mild-calf-strain-to-be-re-evaluated-in-a-week/amp/)
"If they somehow lose the Finals, we all know what the headlines are gonna be. “Kevin Durant wasn’t fully healthy”"
"The problem with OKC fans is they are so enamored with Westbrook that they are blinded by his inefficiently and failure.   Let me ask you something,  Would you rather have Curry or Russ?   Harden or RW?   Kevin Durant or Russ?"
"KD gives the Warriors stability. When the system works perfectly, Warriors are hard to beat, but if a situation like a KLove on Curry happens again like in the 2016 finals, the Warriors will have a hard time getting open and that's where Kevin Durant makes the Warriors better.   So in this case, Seth in correct in his assessment. Warriors are absolutely a better team with Durant but they're harder to guard without KD because Curry and Klay just run around so much.."
And then Kevin Durant comes back
Good. The nba in general is better without Kevin Durant
He means Kevin Durant.    Screaming at the refs and getting kicked out of games and costing their team games.
"Exactly.   I want people to go back and look at the stats from game 2 of the clippers series. After he made the comment “I’m Kevin Durant” ... I want someone to go and pull the stats of Klay and Steph and then look at his stats and if they wanna get more in depth, they can look at the stats for the previous years since KD been there.   Reality is Steph and Klay and better 3 pt shooters but KD is better than both of em because all around he’s better. Sure the splash brothers draw a lot of attention but Kd does to and he still slows the game down, post up and shoot over defense effortless and consistently. The only drawback from that is it takes away looks for Steph and Klay and it prevents them from getting as hot, easily"
"greg oden, who portland drafted first overall in 2007... right ahead of one kevin durant"
"&gt; where Demarcus cousins and Kevin Durant can get hurt and still sweep the finals.  Highly doubt we will sweep. We may not even win.  And yea, it's comparable.  Sucks to be a crap team when there's a dominant powerhouse.  You guys just got spoiled for a long time."
How can you complain about losing Nurkic when the Warriors have lost Boogie Cousins and Kevin Durant?
Besides you guys have a team where Demarcus cousins and Kevin Durant can get hurt and still sweep the finals.   Not even comparable.
Guess it's a good thing none of them were dumb enough to tell the front office they wanted Harrison Barnes instead of Kevin Durant
my favorite player is Kevin Durant.
"Imagine losing Kevin fucking Durant and still being favored to win it all. Even if theyose KD to the knicks, warriors will still probably be the best team in the league. Absolutely insane."
Kevin Durant rn https://i.imgur.com/eeWtl0V.jpg
"portland keeps acting like iguodala is kevin durant in the corner.  they don't have the defensive awareness to preemptively zone up and give that shot up.  you live with an iguodala 3, you don't live with layups and dunks at the rim."
Kevin Durant looking like the grim reaper reading that stat sheet
Imagine if this Warriors team had Kevin Durant to fill in that SF spot
Kevin Durant will be back if they don't get swept and likely Cousins if it goes 7  How's that for demoralizing
Literally up 2-0 in the WCF without Kevin Durant. L E A G U E P A R I T Y B O Y S.
Kevin Durant needs to leave this team.  They're too fun to watch without him.
FUCK KEVIN DURANT  Warriors are so much fun to watch without him
"When the Warriors win the title without Durant i hope Draymond grabs the mic and says ""Fuck Kevin Durant"" at the tune of Lil B. And then says "" we dont need yo bitch ass! Get yo steppin!"""
Man these guys ain't even got Kevin Durant come on
there's no kevin durant
How stupid is it thinking about the fact that the two players not on the court for the Warriors are fucking Kevin Durant and Demarcus fucking Cousins....
"Portland is right up there with OKC if not more so on the biggest ""What If"" questions  If they drafted KD back in 07...that would've been BRoy, Aldridge, and Kevin Durant all drafted within the span of a year...without BRoy's unfortunate injury bug that's a dynasty"
Are you missing any one near the level of Kevin Durant or DeMarcus cousins? Lmao
Absurd how quickly they can erase a lead even without Kevin Durant
Like Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins?
"Well, at least we now know that Kevin Durant is alive. So that's something."
"""*We're going to force you to beat us with someone besides Steph and Klay.*"" - Portland Trailblazers   ""*That's why we got Kevin Durant! Kevin...?*"" - Golden State Warriors"
Kevin ducking Durant did it lol. Chris god damn Bosh did it. They both took pay cuts for one player. LeBron James.
Imagine this team with Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant ruined the AIB :(
"Tomorrow: ""it's been brought up, and people are saying, that Kevin Durant might go play for the Alaskan Inuit Basketball League. Jalen Rose, what's your reaction to this breaking news?"""
"So bro, can you teach me how to add ""Kevin Durant"" after ""warriors""? :D"
The Warriors are more interesting to watch as a team without Kevin Durant.  Better team dynamics and flow.
i was laughin my ass off at all the dumbasses on here acting Like the Warriors without Kevin Durant are bad
The next time you see Kevin Durant play he will be in a knicks uniform  Bucks in 6  Then warriors in 5
Imagine being Kevin Durant for a series’s worth of games in the middle of the playoffs and your team doesn’t break a sweat. Meanwhile top players like Kawhi and Bron last year straight carrying their team
 Isaiah Thomas said that he’s not a top-tier guy like Kevin Durant Kawhi Leonard Giannis or LeBron today.
Myers “Kevin Durant” Leonard
Kevin Durant is the real MVP this season
Wtf Meyers Leonard is Kevin Durant now?
Meyers Leonard playing like he’s Kevin Durant what the fuck
He dicks them so hard they had to go out and get Kevin Durant AND play against him when his second best player on his team was probably Tristan Thompson LMAO
"Michael Jordan's mentality was literally the exact opposite of Kevin Durant. To be the best you have to beat the best. You can't best them, find a way to get better. Not jump ship and join them. What we love about sports is the challenge, the greatness, the adversity. Kevin Durant eliminates all of that from the current NBA. Until a team comes along and dethrones the Warriors, this will be the narrative of the league."
The spirit of Kevin Durant has come to reside inside Meyers Leonard.
"Meyers ""Kevin Durant"" Leonard"
You know it’s been nice forgetting Kevin Durant exists this playoffs
I love Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
"I'd be happy if KD leaves. It's boring with him in there... who the fuck is gonna beat a championship-winning, 73-9-season having core with Kevin fucking Durant. Fucking fuck."
I think he’s saying there isn’t as much attention given to you and your job as there is to Kevin Durant and his.
&gt; Please never compare the competitive nature of Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan again  Yup.
"If I have the ability to talk to trolls online and not let it affect me making decisions about the future, I'm sure Kevin Fucking Durant can too."
Lebron literally said him and kd are the two best players in the league. You know who gets picked first in the all star games? KEVIN DURANT
It’s the nba finals and he’s Kevin Durant.
KD is more integral to the warriors than Kevin Durant
**Is Kevin Durant a redditor in r/nba?**
"When he beats GS in the playoffs in the future it’s going to be the greatest moment in NBA history.    And basketball is a team game, Steph Curry didn’t beat Kevin Durant. This isn’t tennis."
Is Kevin Durant a redditor in r/nba?
My god... I can’t argue with people who legitimately think Curry is a better basketball player than Kevin Durant. I know you’ll never back down so I’m not even gonna waste my time.
"Where's the comparison, tho? Does /u/riskyafterwhiskey11 argue with internet trolls about his personal job, his performance, his personality?  He's comparing apples and Kevin Fucking Durant."
I’ll name one: Kevin Durant. 😂
I love Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant has never logged off
*[Shams] Anthony Davis Has signed a 3 year deal with the Golden State Warriors.*    Followed by   *[Woj] Golden State Warriors Kevin Durant resigns for 5 year supermax.*
I don’t think it’s rigged every year but it is very suspicious that the A list #1 picks have gone where they have.  2003–Cleveland after sucking for years gets hometown star Lebron James.  2004–Tracy McGrady is leaving the same off-season.  Orlando gets Dwight Howard as a replacement.  2005–No #1 pick with superstar upside.  2006–No #1 pick with superstar upside.  2007–Seattle SuperSonic amidst turmoil given 2nd pick guaranteed Oden or Durant.  2008–Hometown star Derrick Rose the clear #1 pick given to Chicago.  2009–Clippers given Blake Griffin.  2010–Wizards win John Wall.  2011–Kyrie gifted to Cleveland a year after Lebron leaves and the roster is a dumpster fire.  2012–Pelicans gifted Anthony Davis after losing superstar Chris Paul.  2013–No clear #1 pick.  2014–No clear #1 pick.  2015–Wolves win KAT after losing proven star Kevin Love in trade.  **Not sketchy like the situations surrounding other teams that won a top pick though**.  2016–After years of sucking with nothing real to show for it except 31 games from Embiid coming off a serious injury Philly wins Ben Simmons.  **Debatably not sketchy given they hadn’t won the 1st pick despite tanking as hard as possible for years**.  2017–No clear #1 pick.  2018–Phoenix wins first #1 pick ever.  Having only drafted 2 decent players since 2012(Booker and Warren).  Ayton and Doncic have superstar upside.  2019–Pelicans gifted Zion after superstar Anthony Davis makes it explicitly clear he is leaving and trying fri leverage a trade to the LAL.
"To answer your question, no Patrick McCaw that didn't play in the Finals does not get the same ""win is a win"" as Kevin Durant, Dirk, LeBron, Duncan, etc...  A win is a win as far as Durant is concerned because not only did he play in the Finals, he was also FMVP.  Name ONE FMVP that didn't earn their ring.  You can say that others could have also won FMVP the same year, but I doubt anyone would contest FMVP to not deserve credit for the title."
"Sure, but when that team acquires Kevin Durant in free agency, the coolness effect wears off."
You are comparing Patrick McCaw to Keving Fucking Durant?  You take your meds today?  You know Kevin Durant was Finals Fucking MVP two years in a row right?
The other players that won college player of the year as a freshman are Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant.
"It's funny that he's all butthurt that's what happens when you can't win on your own and join a team that does almost just as well without you as they do with you.   Kevin ""If you can't beat em join em"" Durant."
&gt; Hard work beats talent when talent don't work hard - Kevin Durant  Kobe's already got a successful VC fund and the beginnings of a successful production / media company. I would definitely put him in my FO.
"They are quoting the phrase that someone else coined, but it's in their own criticism. That's why the whole thing isn't in quotes.   If it was reporting what someone else called them, it would say ""Skip Bayless called Dame and CJ 'trash brothers' in a tweet.""   If I said ""The warriors are better without that 'snake' Kevin Durant"", I couldn't turn around and say ""woah! I didn't say he was a snake!"""
"Don’t care what you post. If both Kevin Durant and Curry are available. You get Kevin Fucking Durant 1000 times out of 10.  Not saying I won’t take Steph, he’s great as well. But he is no Kevin Durant."
BREAKING NEWS KEVIN DURANT JUST WIPED HIS BUTT WITH CHINESE TOILET PAPER COULD THIS BE A CLUE ABOUT WHERE HE'S HEADED THIS SUMMER CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT
Please never compare the competitive nature of Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan again
The best clickbait was “Kevin Durant moves office to manhattan” when his office has been there for years and he was only moving a couple blocks away lmao
"It's so not dumb lmao and I find it hilarious when warriors fans side with KD considering how much more fun, likeable your team is when he's not there. And how much better Steph looks when he's not there. Steph, ya know, your actual guy. Your actual superstar who you developed and who didn't just jump onto your wagon when it was already winning.   You should want KD to get the fuck outta there and stop taking Steph's points.   Like I said to someone else:  The question that needs to be asked is ""how good is this team if I disappear?""   The Miami LeBron teams would be significantly worse without LeBron. The bucks would not be a playoff team without giannis. The rockets would be significantly worse without harden. Etc etc etc.   The warriors were, would have been and are going to be completely fine, IF NOT BETTER, without Kevin Durant."
"Duh.   Giannis would be winning on the team that drafted him with the players assembled around him and by being the best player on a team that would not be very good at all without him.   The question that needs to be asked is ""how good is this team if I disappear?""   The Miami LeBron teams would be significantly worse without LeBron. The bucks would not be a playoff team without giannis. The rockets would be significantly worse without harden. Etc etc etc.   The warriors were, would have been and are going to be completely fine, IF NOT BETTER, without Kevin Durant."
A lot of players can play winning basketball with 3 other All-stars on their team. Kevin Durant has already proved that he's an amazing player and he could have won chips on his own team. He took the easy way out. His championships were pretty much guaranteed. It doesn't improve his legacy as now he'll never be seen as a top 10 player. He could have been that had he won one with OKC and he absolutely could have.
"You don't need to argue it. It's totally fucking true. Kevin ""how can I win with these cats"" Durant went and got some way better cats and whadayaknow, he starts winning. Hmm 🤔🤔🤔  A real champion, one without asterisks, wins with the team assembled around him. Like Curry did before KD came back and like Curry probably will this year and like many many champions have before. A fake champion goes and joins a dynasty."
"Didn't KD take a paycut? He was a 9 year vet at the time he signed with the warriors, making him elligible for $30.6M. He signed a 2-year 54M with the warriors. Meaning he left at least 6M on the table.   https://www.si.com/nba/2017/07/03/kevin-durant-warriors-contract-discount"
"Problem is if he does that, decisions made. Kevin Durant won’t have much of a chance to rewrite his legacy. Most every future discussion of him will include it. Would you really wanna constantly have to overcome that the rest of your life?    Like sure you’re great but every real discussion of “How great?” Will be limited by his reliance on this stacked Warriors team."
"I agree with him, his adopted brother's untimely death is a nightmare, what's going on in Syria and Yemen and the US-Mexican border is a nightmare, the endless vicious Republican attacks on pretty much everybody in America (as well as America's institutions) is a nightmare (Kevin Durant himself said so.....), people slapping asterisks next to championships is not a nightmare, KD should tweet, ""Republicans do this and this and this and this and this and this.....THAT is a nightmare you bitchass muther fucker...."""
"I don't really think 2019 has been that tough for them. The only real hurdle in '18 or '19 has been the Rockets, which I said I appreciated in my above post.  The Clippers were really just a wake-up call, I mean Durant even said it was the kick in the pants he needed to remember that he is, in fact, Kevin Durant. He said they never took them seriously because he didn't think they had a chance to lose to the Clips.   The Blazers are injured af and are getting swept, so there's not really a challenge there."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant is surely signing up to leave Russ to play with the morbid franchise of GS without Steph."
I love Kevin Durant.
So you're basically saying that Kevin Durant. The guy who was averaging 35 on 70% TS. Was hurting Curry/Dray/Klay/Iggy. Alright I think we're done here
"I have to appreciate that Kevin Durant gives all of us average people the opportunity to literally SMH at a multi millionaire Top-2 basketball player in the entire world. Lebron and Steph are nearly untouchable at this point (from a PR standpoint) so it’s kind of refreshing to see this massive celebrity basketball star show so much of his flaw and inner turmoil.     *there isn’t a universe where you should have even considered going to GS and you know it, Kevin.*"
It was a big story since the OKC paper published an article with that nickname: [http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2014/story/\_/id/10868089/mr-unreliable-headline-daily-oklahoman-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-causes-stir](http://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/10868089/mr-unreliable-headline-daily-oklahoman-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-causes-stir)

You know what sounds like a good idea for a guy who likes to not be bothered... going to the lakers or the knicks and playing with LEBRON JAMES or KEVIN DURANT and KYRIE

What's this talk of Kevin Durant winning a championship ? He is good enough to win it but having a super team that won 73 games and lost game 7 of a finals close game doesn't count towards him being the man. He has yet to win a championship like Kobe did in 2009.
Lol have you been watching the playoffs? The warriors are not playing better without him at all. If the warriors were to play like this against the Bucks or hell even Toronto and maybe even the Sixers THEY WOULD NOT WIN A SERIES they are fortunate the blazers are in the WCF.... I’ll give klay and Steph credit for closing out game six against the rockets without him but the rockets didn’t play anywhere near close to form. KEVIN DURANT IS A HALL OF FAMER. HE IS ARGUABLY THE BEST ALL AROUND SCORER OF ALL TIME. Nothing to prove. HIS RINGS ARE VALIDATED. WHY??? HE WAS SHITTING ON LEBRON JAMES WHEN IT MATTERED. DAGGER 3s from the top of the arc to close games out. This post IS BLASPHEMOUS
If Curry was 7 feet he would be Kevin Durant
"But you would take...Kevin Durant, who blew a 3-1 lead? Forgive me if I’m missing an obvious joke."
"It is the Warriors dynasty, not the Kevin Durant dynasty."
"Whenever I see the weekly ""Social Media Makes Everyone Unhappy"" headline based on a new ""study"", I think of Kevin Durant."

PG- Magic Johnson  SG- Kobe Bryant SF- Kevin Durant PF- Giannis  C- Hakeem  6th- Lebron
I'm Kevin Durant?
"From another thread in this sub I can't find    https://m.imgur.com/FhFvwTZ   This is preinjury... I'm sure it'll get worse.     I dunno how you can have a top 3 and exclude Kawhi. He's been the best player this NBA playoffs hands down. Kevin ""if you can't best em join em"" Durant is good, but the team fires on all cylinders without him. Without Curry the Warriors aren't Warriors. That's why he's so insecure."
This is very surprising. What are the chances of getting a response from freaking Kevin Durant himself when you arent even trying to get a response from him. KD is getting way too invested in twitter lol
"Why would I, the warriors fan, like Kevin Durant? Let me think? I dunno actually"
Its legitimately likely that Kevin Durant will read this very comment thread.
"I think it's just statistics.  Chances of being a 6'0 to 6'3 (already above average height) phenom with explosiveness, shooting skills, and ball handling skills are astronomical.  Chances of being 6'10+ are astronomical, much less 7'2+.  Combine those odds and get Kevin Durant."
I vote Kevin Durant for DPOY
Kevin Durant sign and trade for AD
[idk I think there's at least a 2.66% chance](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors)
Russ ? Yeah “no more questions bitch”   KD? “I’m Kevin Durant”
"As a non-biased party I'm giving that title to KD. Kawhi is good no doubt, but I mean...its Kevin Durant."
"I’m Kevin Durant, you know who I am"
"It's so clear that's what's going on right now. I just read an article that was headlined: ""NBA Exec Reportedly Reveals That Kevin Durant Is Unhappy With ‘Prodding’ From Steve Kerr And Is Frustrated That He’s Not The ‘Centerpiece” Of Team"". This is some soap opera/WWE type shit. KD is gone from the Warriors for sure. And tbh, I think that means the end of the Dubs Dynasty."
To the Bucks fans. I respect your team and your city and fans. But your team will not beat the Warriors with or without Kevin Durant. I’m sorry they don’t seem good enough!!! Yes I know teams have off nights but they’ve shown a lot of holes
And with Kevin Durant
With Cousins and Kevin Durant silly
"Yup, Kevin Durant is essentially Harrison Barnes again. Nice to have him but not needed."
"That just sounds so mean spirited. Klay, Curry, and Dray doing there thing to rip the defense to shreds and wear them out.  2nd units come in and the opposing team has to deal with Kevin freaking Durant."
"&gt; he warriors have not and will likely not beat a full strength team in the finals without Kevin Durant.  Nah, I just really enjoy watching you guys say the warriors were unbeatable/73 wins/blah blah blah and then also say that they won't win without KD. It's hilarious every time."
"Connecting the dots is hard for you, huh?  The warriors have not and will likely not beat a full strength team in the finals without Kevin Durant.  They won their first championship against the Cavaliers with no Kyrie.  Full strength Cavs gave the warriors the historically infamous 3-1 meme.  Durant made LeBron his bitch in the finals.  No Durant, they’re not beating the bucks."
Bro he had Kevin Durant for 8 years

"Fuck wrong wit u boi  -Finals MVP Kevin Durant, 2019"
"Great players make others better around them.  Or that's the argument for Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Lebron James, and countless others greats or that's atleast how they've been portrayed by the media.  Why does the narrative change for Kevin Durant? What does it result too a low iq post about how  ""KD IS DA BETTER PLAYER, but STEPH IS DA MOST IMPORANT PLAYER"".  https://imgur.com/a/iROddqt  How does that even make any sense? The most important player is the best player. Without Steph they ain't going to the finals. Without KD they can still win a chip and they already proven that. Basketball is not a 1v1 game. It's a 5v5 game.  Wish i could downvote you more."
Kevin Durant took the 2nd most contested shots in the finals.
"Kevin Durant is 6th all-time in PPG  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career.html  He's also 3rd all-time in Finals PPG, Playoff PPG and 9th in FG%  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career_finals.html https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg_pct_career_finals.html https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career_p.html   In the playoffs, he's 7th all-time in PER  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/per_career_p.html  I'm not necessarily arguing anything, just stating some facts that might affect things."
6MOY Kevin Durant
"I'm talking about right now, as in this year. KD hasn't said anything other than ""I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am."" And he IS a top player. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't know basketball."
That’s the problem though. They’ll maybe lose that game but still win a series. They do not need Kevin Durant he’s there to be a luxury for when Klay and Steph are off. In a 7 game series they don’t need KD
The Warriors are more cohesive without Kevin Durant because they have to be. With him in the lineup they can fuck around and rely on individual talent to bail them out.
"The flaw isn't slight, the narrative makes no sense at all. No shit they're better with Kevin Durant. That's why people got mad in the first place."
Everyone who thinks the Warriors are better off without Kevin Durant is fucking retarded and won’t be able to read this post anyways
Well the Anti-Warriors Deep State led by famous rapper Jay-Z (full name Jayson Zebra) is trying to push Kevin Durant out of Golden State and to New York so that he can use Mr. Durant at any moment to help Roc Nation gain currency
"what about kevin durant AND kawhi leonard AND lebron james, then truly the league will be OVER"
Said Kevin Durant a season or two ago haha
Would Kevin Durant even be in the nba if he didn’t existed ?
"Not next season baby, because Kevin Durant is leaving Golden State, ending their dominant dynasty and going to New York with Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving and Tobias Harris to take them to the second round of the play offs before losing to the Bucks in 6 because everything the media says is true"
"I can’t do it. We know Curry’s impact on a basketball game from advanced stats through a number of years. We also know Durant’s. We know Curry elevates other players while Durant doesn’t.  Yes, Durant has had better playoff stats with them playing together (I believe 3 PPG and 2 TS% better), while Curry has better regular season stats, but a large function of this is the following:  1. Stephen Curry doesn’t get to play with Stephen Curry, but Kevin Durant does. 2. Teams like Houston and Cleveland buy hard into doubling Curry while giving single coverage to Durant.   Right now I would put Curry and Kawhi as the two best players in the league. Not sure where Lebron factors in, because we can see what he’s done before, but him and Durant are the next two up. Then Harden and Giannis after that."

"The Warriors are the prohibitive favorite with or without Kevin Durant. It’s crazy how underrated Steph is. People had him second behind LeBron before KD went there, and he is still second behind LeBron."
Kevin Durant (Calf Strain) is likely to be even more so sensitive on social media.
"Kevin Durant is not a better defender than Paul George. His size might make him a better fit on bigger players, PG was 5th in defensive win shares, Durant didn’t finish in the top 25. Similarly, PG has the 5th biggest defensive rating among active NBA players where as Durant is 36th."
Kevin Durant is a better defender than Paul George. He’s really fucking good. Underrated in that regard.
"Raptors got fined for tampering during 2016 OVO fest when they were recruiting Kevin Durant, Drake paid for it though."
Kawhi is elite but Kevin Durant is the most well versatile scorer in NBA history.
kawhi is a walking bucket  he’ll be reaching kevin durant levels soon  no one can guard him
lebron james can be great whilst being insanely overrated.   kawhi leonard and kevin durant are currently neck and neck for the best player in basketball.
I don't wanna hear about a coach when your MVP and a guy bucks fans were saying is better than kevin fucking durant disappears looking like a yolked up ben simmons while kawhi was ripping shots.
Ok who on earth said Giannis is better than Kevin fucking Durant lol

"Man, Kevin Durant being hurt is so damn cool. Legit excited for the playoffs for the first time in years. The finals are going to be fun. There is competition!"
"Not really. All-NBA is mostly honorary, this is just a new thing that the NBA introduced a few years back to try and encourage star players to stay with their team after Kevin Durant joined the Warriors"
Exactly.  LeBron: I’m the best player in the world  KD: You know what my name is? I’m Kevin Durant  Steph: Shimmied on the doctor after Sonya pushed him out  Klay: There’s not a lot of guards better than me  [This Sub Singling Klay Out](https://media0.giphy.com/media/iSxPmDWr97248/giphy.gif?cid=8fc3c8975ce74f9e50374c3677029099&amp;rid=giphy.gif):

"This is formatted so poorly, it hurts my eyes.

"The ESPN analyst above said that he doesn’t think the Warriors are better without Durant, he thinks they are equally as good either way.  That’s a lot to think about.   Does it mean they are just as good without Durant, but not better? Which also means they are not a better team with Kevin Durant.  The first or second best player in the league being expendable is ridiculous."
If Chris Paul dosen't get hurt you would not question that take at all.    The rockets outplayed a 73 win team that added kevin durant and were an injury away from the title with a harder road than any of those spurs and heat teams faced.

The voters thought Kevin Durant did not have a better season than Paul George. /thread
"Link to the news that Durant and Cousins won't be back for Game 1, but they're expected to return during the Finals.

I’d like to imagine that steph plays really well as the focal point for like two games even though he doesn’t want to be.   Then Kevin Durant comes back and every one is like Kevin is the focal point and Kevin is like I’m the focal point. But they lose that game.   So some media person asks Steph if he should be the focal point again for game 4 for the good of the team.   And Steph just says “I dun want it”   And “she’s mah qween”   Then Kevin Durant goes hero ball and loses the finals.   Steph then has to publicly tell Kevin not to sign with the warriors again. The fans are mad at him for saying it and somehow have the power to demand the front office do something.    Front office makes Steph stay in Oakland while they go to San Fran to appease the fans.   The fans then go to a toxic killer butterfly island.
Yea there isn't a single team picking Paul George over Kevin Durant.
*cuts to Kevin Durant*  “I changed New York’s contact to Golden State’s. Did you really think I’d play with Kyrie? 🐍”
"For me I'm harsh on KD/Curry right now, right now o me is a current top 3 player in the league currently no doubt, but I need a bigger body of work WITHOUT having the  luxury of Kevin Durant. Right now to me he is not in the top 20. I know a lot of ya'll put him higher for your recency bias, but these years with KD to me are meaningless over others in the all time position ranking. Ask me when his career is close to being over, he's still got a lot of basketball life left."
"D'antoni came closer to beating the Kevin Durant+Curry Lead Warriors(what might potentially be the greatest team of all time)than any team/coach in the league (With way less talent by the way), yet he doesn't adapt well in the playoffs.. LMFAO"
Kevin Durant on your team makes zero difference? Enlighten me please sir
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Klay  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Embiid  SF: Kawhi
Durant not being first team kinda makes the whole thing a joke.  Name one person who would take Paul George over Kevin Durant.
"Curry was underrated early in the season, PG's performance fell off late in the season.  My answer would have to be one Kevin Durant."
I'm not seeing Paul George as first team either.  I think he should switch spots with Kevin Durant
"If even warriors fans can see it, why can't the rest of r/nba. Kevin Durant is in the wrong here. And i say that as the biggest Kevin Durant fan there is"
which suns team was better than last years rockets dude..... the team that was a hamstring away from winning a championship and beating a 73 win team that added kevin durant
"Personally there are only a handful of guys I would give a supermax to easily   - Curry - Giannis - Harden - Kawhi - Kevin Durant  Fringe guys that I would consider offering the supermax to are - Paul George - LeBron - Embiidd - Jokic  If you give Kemba, Dame, Westbrook, Kyrie the supermax, I don't believe you can win with them being your star player.   I understand why Portland is going to offer Dame and why Hornets may offer Kemba the supermax, but it's going to look real nasty in the latter part of the contract.   I personally wouldn't if I were the GM. You are basically shutting out your window of contending if you do that."
"I'm not saying players don't improve. Jesus christ. I'm saying LeBron is one of the all-time playmaking geniuses, and it's fucking insane to project someone into developing from solid to Lebron in their mid twenties  &gt;Steve Nash, a two time MVP, wasn't an all star until his 6th season  Steve Nash developed counters and confidence. He didnt go from being a bad shooter to a great shooter. He didnt develop from an ok passer into Steve Fucking Nash. Back before he even went to Dallas, when he couldnt even get on the court, Kevin Johnson used to take him aside during practice and say ""what are you doing? You know you're better than anyone else here, right?"" Nash always had tremendous talent, he just had to put it together mentally and find a coach who would truly believe in him as a superstar (which he didnt find until Phoenix, at 31).   Steph Curry has the all-time record for college 3pt makes in a season. I dont care that he wasnt an all-star in 2013, he was a top 7 player in the league. He was 6th in VoRP, 6th in OWS, and was 3rd! in offensive box +/-. In 2013, when Steph didnt make the all-star team, Offensive Box +/- went LeBron, Cp3, Curry, then Durant. Then he got into the playoffs, won a round, and surprised everyone by giving a real challenge to the Spurs. I dont care he ""didnt make the all-star team""--Steph was a fucking superstar in 2013.  Moving backwards: his third season he played 23 games, and his second season they only let him shoot 4.6 threes per game, despite him shooting 44%. Yes, Steph has improved every year. But if Steph had Kerr earlier (and better ankles), he's an all-star in year two. In 2013, we're seeing Steph compete for 1st team All-NBA.  Kobe came in at 18. By the time he was 24 (Giannis's age) he was a three time champion and close to a finished product. He had already played his best defense and in 2003, had one of his best three seasons.  I fucking gave Giannis the credit of being a potential top 10 guy ever. All I said is, when he gets there, it's not going to be because he's developed LeBron's vision, because *no one just develops that*. Asking for LeBron's passing is like asking for KD's shooting.   Giannis is doing his poor man LeBron thing aided by the perfect system and coach. LeBron did his thing as his team's coach on offense, winning 67 games surrounded by Wally Sczerbiak and Mo Willaims"
"You know, I never thought about comparing Ayesha to Kevin Durant until now lol."

How is Kevin Durant not First team?
"Lebron's game has so much variety. He takes shots from all over the court. It's not all layups like Giannis, mid-range like Durant, or 3s like Curry. Lebron does dunks, layups, mid-range, 3s, and deep 3s. Complete package.  The other unique thing about Lebron is how much he relies on mind games. On [this play](https://streamable.com/3mnjj) for example, the Cavs are running a set that usually gets them a layup or a 3 for Kevin Love. This is because point guards usually don't want to switch onto Kevin Love like Vanvleet here. So the Cavs take advantage of the hesitancy to switch, and fake out bigs guarding Love by going towards the screen then sprinting backdoor towards the hoop.   Draymond is so smart and aware of the Cavs plays though that the Cavs can't do this to the Warriors. When they try [here](https://streamable.com/3mnjj), Curry hesitates to switch for just a second, and Love fakes out Bell by rejecting the screen and sprinting backdoor. Draymond Green knows this is coming and understands where the Cavs are trying to get the ball, so he goes and stands in the way to block Love's path.  Lebron sees this and knows immediately that the middle of the floor is open for a few seconds because Draymond committed baseline. He gets Thompson to set a screen to rub off Durant. Draymond is too far back so he's not there to switch onto James, and James gets a high quality open shot. I learn a lot about high level ball watching Lebron hunt for good shots."
"Kevin ""Tyler Durden"" Durant."
Are you suggesting that Kevin Durant wasn't necessary for the Warriors to be a successful team?  Never could have guessed.
"I wish PG wasn’t in OKC, because I, Kevin James Durant, would’ve gone back to take the hardest road with Russ. I think I’ll go to the Knicks instead. Just the right kind of dysfunction, it’s also in the East, might be I’ll save my legacy there and surpass Knicks legend Carmelo Anthony"
imagine if the warriors win a championship without kevin durant &amp; then he leaves in july.  we were just saying this was the best player in the world 3 weeks ago and apparently they may not even need him to win.
"###All-NBA First Team   Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  James Harden, Houston Rockets  Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks  Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder  Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets    ###All-NBA Second Team   Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics  Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors  Kawhi Leonard, Toronto Raptors  Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers    ###All-NBA Third Team   Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder   Kemba Walker, Charlotte Hornets  LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  Blake Griffin, Detroit Pistons  Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz"
"So the first team is the best team. The best players of the regular season make that team, hence why the two leading MVP voters (Harden and Giannis) are unanimous.    Kevin Durant isn’t in the first team mainly because I think they have to have a center in there and keep some position structure to it (Jokic definitely deserves first team though) Playoff performances do not count towards voting as the voting was submitted before the playoffs. So the Kevin Durant we are seeing now isn’t the one we always kept seeing in the regular season (whether it was down to rest time, or the fact that he’s sharing with 4 other all stars) but it doesn’t take away his status as a top 3 player in the league.    Not sure if this helps clear it up but let me know if there’s any questions you have !"
"Michael Jeffrey Jordan  Kobe Bean Bryant  Lebron ""The Frozen One"" James  No. ""Quit on my Spurs"" 2  Kevin ""Thinnest skin superstar"" Durant  Kyrie ""The Closer"" Irving  Ray ""Saved Lebron's legacy"" Allen   Am I missing anyone?"
**First Team**  * Stephen Curry (482 points; 91 First Team votes) * James Harden (500 points; 100 First Team votes) * Giannis Antetokounmpo (500 points; 100 First Team votes) * Paul George (433 points; 71 First Team votes) * Nikola Jokić (411 points; 59 First Team votes)  **Second Team**  * Kyrie Irving (195) * Damian Lillard (306) * Kawhi Leonard (242) * Kevin Durant (358) * Joel Embiid (375)  **Third Team**  * Russell Westbrook (178 points) * Kemba Walker (51) * Blake Griffin (115) * LeBron James (111) * Rudy Gobert (89)
What? How is Chris Broussard more of a known liar than Kevin Durant?
"Steph Curry got injured and had ankle issues for awhile so when they started their championship run, he was on a very team friendly contract.  They drafted their core. Draymond, Klay and Steph were all drafted by Golden State.  Because of the Steph Curry contract, and the salary cap increase of 2016(?) they were easily able to sign Kevin Durant. Players chose for the salary cap to increase all at once instead of gradually, so this is what you get.  Vet effect - Vets later in their careers are willing to take on cheap contracts in exchange for the best shot at winning a ring. That is why they got David West and many others for cheap.  You can resign players you currently have for their old salary plus some percentage and go over the salary cap. Once they have their guys they can keep resigning if they don't mind paying the compounding luxury tax.  Last, Cousins was coming off a huge injury. He was worth a max contract before the injury, but everyone low balled him because of the injury (rightfully so). So he took minimum contract (you can sign as many minimum contracts to fill roster if you are over the cap) as a ""prove it"" deal this year.  So in the end, Warriors drafted well, salary cap increase hit at just the right time for them to sign Kevin Durant. However, this summer Klay/KD are up for big contracts, Draymond the following year unless he ops out. The current form of this team will not likely exist next year.  Let me know if I am wrong on any of this, my knowledge is limited and I am recalling from memory."
"I hate to side with Chris Paul on this, but hes right.  For as much as the rockets preach and pray to the Gods of analytics, under Morey they're falling into one of the most infamous sports traps  of all time.  They're too reliant on one player on the offensive end, as good as harden is he can't dominate the ball as much as he does, it makes his teammates worse. I'm not convinced that Chris Paul is this old washed up player that's way past his prime, I think the Houston offense and James Hardens Ball dominance is taking him out of rhythm.  We see the same thing happen on the Warriors with KD, They're offensive is so much more dynamic when Kevin Durant is out, but unlike the GSW the rockets don't have the talent to make up for it.  The same thing happens with the OKC team, with Russel Westbrook MVP season, He dominated the ball too much, and the offense becomes overly reliant on him, making his teammates worse and negatively impacting overall team performance."

"Honestly? You just take away Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant and they STILL won't be a dynasty, what scrubs."
Kevin Durant didn’t exist before July 4 2016
"Lol Kevin Durant is just a tiny moon, in a massive galaxy that is golden state warriors."
"They are really exceptional talents who were drafted by bad teams and were given full control since day 1, so this was almost bound to happen.  What actually surprised me was that LeBron made 28 more 3 pointers than Kevin Durant while played 3 games fewer.  Damn he was a much better short earlier in his career."
Nah fuck that I ain't having no memes. All my life I've been expecting a Baron Davis-level free agent at best and a Vucevic-level free agent at actually. So memers can fuck off with that Kevin Durant nonsense.
I love Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant (and multiple other athletes) are triggered by little kids on the internet. I'm sure it's safe to say some of the players get distracted.   Not all professional athletes have amazingly thick skin. Many of them are incredibly paranoid and narcissistic.

So just to clarify. You think its 100% made up and Kevin Durant never initiated long conversations on IG or Twitter with CB?
There is one Kevin Durant and thousands of KD super fans willing to defend him of anything.  Simple math suggests the latter is more likely responsible for the account.
"I don't like Chris but what did he do wrong here? KD made it seem like he was likely so he cleared his name without needlessly firing back at Kevin Durant. Don't see any reason to criticize this, this is exactly what he should be doing."

"They'd go 42-40, finish as the 8th seed, and get swept 0-4 by whatever team finishes in 1st.  Giannis is:  - a much, much better scorer  - a better defender  - even as a playmaker  - better at literally everything else basketball.  It's ridiculous that you think the Bucks with Simmons instead of Giannis would win 55 games. Giannis is gonna be MVP and has a legit shot to be defensive MVP too ... Silly.  - I have a better question: If you replace Kevin Durant with a potato, do the Warriors still win the championship this year?"
"Finals  Team L (1) vs Team D (14)   Team L -LaVine, Zach  -Lopez, Brook -Leonard, Kawhi -Lillard, Damian  -Lowry, Kyle   Team D -Davis, Anthony -DeRozan, DeMar -Doncic, Luka -Durant, Kevin -Drummond, Andre  **OUTCOME**: Team D wins"
"Are you suggesting we should have passed over Kevin fucking Durant in free agency? I know you’re used to seeing inept front office decisions, but believe it or not every team makes Cavs-like decisions. This is a discussion about roster building. The fact that you have to go back all the way to 2016 to brag about win sandwiching 3 titles in 4 years just goes to show which front office did a better job with their team building. At the end of the day, you can keep 2016 and I’ll keep my 3 rings(potentially 4)."
God this is getting stupid. It’s Shaq and will always be Shaq until Steph dominates the playoffs for a few years WITHOUT KEVIN FUCKING DURANT
"No, im just tired of all this stupid clickbait drama on this sub. Its about the NBA, yes. Kevin Durant is an NBA player, yes. Does that mean the 5th post about something he tweeted about a reporter saying he talked to him is relevant? Really? This post in no way contributes to anything meaningful on this sub. Its for 12 year olds who like Twitter wars. Its pathetic."
"I used equal cutoffs for both teams, and I used players are their natural positions.     This thread is making you way too upset.     It was just meant to make a close poll that would be interesting.     Kevin Durant shot 35.3% from 3 this year, which is below league average. Should I have included him on the poor 3 point shooting team? No, because this poll is just for fun to ask a balanced question."
"You know what the owners/GM’s should do when they meet with him; pretend that Kevin Durant is trying to get ahold of them, and then make a big scene like,  “Excuse me, I’m meeting with Tobias Harris right now! Kevin Durant can wait!”  😂"
"If the Warriors don't exist, Kevin Durant doesn't injure his foot against them on December 18th, 2015, where he had 30 points at half time but went down with what ultimately turned out to be a season ending injury (after re-injuring it later).     OKC wins the title in 2015.    OKC wins the title in 2016.     OKC wins the title in 2017.     OKC wins the title in 2018.     The 2017 Cavs were only good because of the brand of 3-ball basketball that the Warriors introduced to the league. Same with the 2018 Rockets. Not only do I think OKC was stronger than both of those teams, I doubt either of those teams are nearly as strong without them emulating the Warriors model which would not exist in this scenario."
Yeah I'm not saying those games didn't sell out. But in terms of what the Clippers are a Kevin Durant big 3 completely eclipses anything that franchise has ever done.
Imagine thinking Draymond Green is a better player than Kevin Durant
Because Lob City was Chris Paul and Blake Griffin don't act like that's the same thing as Kevin Durant with a big 3.
"I'm just saying that Kevin Durant is a mercurial dude. Who knows how he feels about where he wants to play?  Playing for a big Knicks fanbase at the Garden might not mean jack shit to him, if he feels like Dolan sucks and/or the team won't get out of the 2nd round."
I didn’t realize you had Kevin Durant magic crystal ball. If you’ve got some free time; could you also look into the future and see if Jimmy Butler will resign with the Sixers?
Kevin Durant 😔
"I think the whole he makes players better thing is from the fact that he has so much success with average players. Kind of like Curry right now.   But with Curry, people don't look at Harrison Barnes going from 11ppg on the Warriors to 19ppg on the Mavs and say Curry made Barnes worse or 'held him back'. People say Lebron turned Kevin Love into a spot up shooter, but not Steph Curry/Kevin Durant turned Draymond Green into a spot up shooter. People are just overly critical of Lebron."
"To add to KD idolizing Vince Carter, he also wanted to play for the Raptors growing up as they were his favorite team   [Source: “Durant: I wanted to play for the Raptors”](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/)"
Mike Trout is like Kevin Durant good and Bryce Harper is like Klay Thompson good. or this a bad comparison?
They get a whole Kevin Durant better
Imagine thinking that Kevin fucking Durant doesn't change how good a team is.
and that little is 90% kevin durant
12/13 (if you still count Tyreke Evans):  1. Ben Simmons (76ers) 2. Malcolm Brogdon (Bucks)  3. Karl-Anthony Towns (Timberwolves) 4. Andrew Wiggins (Timberwolves) 5.

Kevin durant has not won a single playoff series without a teammate that would win an mvp
No it isn’t.  Kawhi is a whole realm above anyone else not named Kevin Durant.
"This is going to be fun until kd and boogie return for game 1 and the warrriors starting lineup is literally Steph Curry, Klay, Kevin Durant, Draymond, and Boogie."
They have to assassinate Steph Curry and make sure Kevin Durant doesn’t come back from injury.
"Anunoby = Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodola"
This is actually a great idea. I've been focusing on his shot but completely glossed over his mid range-post game. He could be deadly offensively with an added Kevin Durant type baseline extended game.
"Can you imagine man...  ""And with the 2nd overall pick the SEATTLE SUPER SONICS select... Kevin Durant.""   Wait a minute..."
"If I was you I’d choose the Clippers.   Entertaining, generally good team that looks like it’s on the rise. They have a good chance to sign a big free agent this summer (superstars Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard), a coach who previously won a championship, and a legendary executive who helped put together the current Warriors dynasty. Plus it would be relatively easy to drive to LA and catch a game."
"Keep reading. The second paragraph says:   &gt;	If the Lakers strike out with Kyrie Irving and other top targets (Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are not interested, according to sources), should they give Butler the max and sign him comfortable or not?"
"No, not with his 2 rings and 2 FMVPs. He became an all-time great with his 4 scoring titles during the LeBron era, his 50-40-90, and his MVP. Charles Barkley is an all-time great without any championships. Your Nash example doesn't take away from Nash being an all-time great. Kevin Durant is certainly an all-time great player."
I know that Bay Area homelessness has increased dramatically in that time.    It could be because Kevin Durant.
He's Kevin Durant.
Its almost as if Kevin Durant is expected to leave
How dare he put smut on our G League Kevin Durant
"In the 2016, the Thunder were this close to a Finals appearance because they had a giant, agile defender named Kevin Durant who could lock down Draymond Green. In that series, Draymond shot 35% from the field and averaged about 11 PPG and 4 APG. Putting pressure on Draymond shifts a lot of the playmaking pressure onto other Warriors. This was probably something the Warriors could survive in 2016, with a younger Bogut and a healthy Andre Iguodala. That probably wouldn't be the same case today. If someone big, fast, and smart enough is covering Draymond, then the Warriors don't get any of those free fast break points you see in the Blazers series. They don't get the same sort of threat off of the 1-4 pick-and-roll. Draymond's post passes become much riskier and less rewarding. The Warriors' offense is predicated off of off-ball movement and big man passing, and the series becomes much easier if the passing big men are Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney instead of Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala.  So no, I don't think Kawhi should shadow Curry."
No he can’t. We’ve seen them play each other enough. Kevin Durant is unstoppable
"Its motherfuckin Kevin Durant, you cant stop him."
"He’s spoken widely about not getting the credit he thought he would get. He just recently commented about being considered “the Warriors and Kevin Durant”. He’s not being perceived as he expected he would. He’s an amazing player and FMVP no one can take that away. But people can still think it was a weak move, and that the Warriors could have won without him."
"Has he not gotten lots of credit? FMVP x2, people literally saying he was the best player in the world until he got injured 2 weeks ago, People predicting a GSW collapse without him against the Rockets. He hasntvplayed so he getsvshit out now but as soon as he gets out there people will start saying ""HES KEVIN DURANT"" again. NBA fans are the most fickle of people."
Did he ever unfuck Kevin Durant?
"Imagine thinking adding Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins back to the team would hurt them lol. The stats show they’re the best when KD and Steph play together. They’re better without KD than without Steph, but the best combo is KD + Steph together."
1. Steph 2. Kyrie Irving 3. Dame 4. Westbrook 5. Kemba  1. Harden 2. Klay Thompson 3. Beal 4. CJ 5. Booker  1. Kawhi Leonard 2. Lebron James 3. Kevin Durant 4. Paul George 5. Butler  1. Giannis 2. Blake Griffin 3. Draymond Green 4. Siakam 5. Milsapp   1. Davis 2. Embiid 3. Jokic 4. KAT 5. Gobert
Kevin Durant.
"what’s the warriors win condition here?   steph won’t be rattling off these 36-40 point games like he did vs portland  it took awhile but kyle lowry is finally getting his recognition,   klay is great but it’s like danny green was made for this matchup, granted he’s played pretty poorly.   so then we have draymond vs kawhi or siakam, iguodala isn’t really going to be able to get his own basket.   if this turns into a defensive battle then i’m going with kawhi’s shot creating ability all day &amp; night.   their bench is weak, toronto’s is very good..   kevin durant is their only hope"
"At the same time: Warriors are optimistic that they’ll get Kevin Durant, Demarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodola back at some point vs. Raptors in the NBA Finals."
It's also not like any team that wasn't the Kevin Durant warriors did any better than the raptors.
"&gt;Both one inch taller than Kevin Durant  Only listed height, not real. He confirmed he’s closer to a full 7’"
Casual reminder that Ben Simmons and Anthony Davis are the same height and are both one inch taller than Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
"-Kevin Durant, 2016"
[here's something](https://www.complex.com/sports/2018/12/kawhi-leonard-kevin-durant-system-player)
He's got fewer than Kevin Durant though.
"You know they say that all teams are created equal, but you look at Golden State and you look at Toronto and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go five on five against another team, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But they're genetic freaks and they're not normal! So Raptors got a 25%, AT BEST, at beatin them. Then you add Kevin Durant to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the best of 7 in the finals, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but Golden State, they got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Toronto KNOWS they can't beat them and they're not even gonna try! So Toronto, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus Golden State's 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning. But then you take Golden State's 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning. See Kawhi, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice."
"Agreed. If it wasn't for VC we would've ended up like the Grizzlies. He was the guy who put Toronto on the map. Let's not forget what [KD said awhile back](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-wanted-play-toronto-raptors-kid-222412883--nba.html?y20=1).   People still hold a grudge over VC, but honestly they're stuck in the past. Despite what happened during his final days as a Raptor, he's still one of the best Raptors ever. That's a fact."
"LBJ has been at home while the rest of these guys were competing in the post season, therefore:     1. Kevin Durant  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. Stephen Curry 4. James Harden   5. Giannis Antetokounmpo"
"nah.  Kevin Durant, the no-face slim reaper, is gonna come out of the locker room in the final seconds of game 7, not check into the game, grab the ball, double dribble, and sink the game winning shot.  refs call it good. Warriors win.  GOT S8E3"
"Kevin Durant doesn’t come back good from injury, Ibaka Zazas Draymond, DeMarcus Cousins does come back and uses way too many possessions inefficiently, and Kevon Looney retires after a deep internal argument ending with him unsatisfied with his name having an “O” instead of an “I”"
I really don't care about Kevin Durant unless he is wearing purple and gold.
Giannis Antetokounmpo is a poor man’s Kevin Durant.
"Steve Kerr playbook:  Have way, way more talent than any team in NBA history   -   Plays:  Play core of 73-win team  Backup plays if down:  Bring all star center DeMarcus Cousins in   Backup backup plays:  Bring Kevin Durant in"
If Kevin durant actually plays the history won’t repeat itself.   If he doesn’t it might happen.
"Raptors and Warriors storylines - Steph Curry spent some time in Toronto when Dell Curry played with Vince Carter. The carter effect and other YouTube videos show Steph playing with Vince as a kid.  - Who passed the ball inbounds for Vince Carter’s miss in 2001 for Raptors Sixers buzzer beater? None other than Dell Curry. Kawhi redeemed this shot against the Sixers this year. Both winners of those games faced Milwaukee. - Chris Boucher and Patrick McCaw played for the Warriors last year. Alfonso McKinnie played for the Raptors last year. McKinnie’s story is impressive to make it back to the league. - Kevin Durant grew up idolizing Vince Carter and said so on the Dan Patrick show. Drake got fined for tampering for Kevin Durant free agency too. Drake is friends with Kevin Durant and Curry, but his heart is with the Toronto Raptors. - Kevin Durant swan song for the Warriors? A chance for a three peat against the most difficult defense they’ll face this playoffs or the end of a dynasty with Raptors Cinderella story. - Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol get their chance for a title after years of falling short in the west to the Warriors. - Klay predicted their matchup in the fall as a possible June preview. He’s Nostradamus.  - And finally Kawhi 2017 amazing playoff run came to a halt against the Warriors... On his 2019 redemption tour after the whole injury ordeal last year now he gets the chance to beat the Warriors in the NBA finals.  Repasted from my comment earlier today"
"Kevin ""dont need you"" durant"
You really forgot Kevin “35 in the playoffs” Durant?
Seems to be the majority consensus for Kevin Durant...
"The only thing Giannis is better than Durant at is his FT% this series is a little better than Kevin Durant's 3FG% for his career, so impressive!"
"Thanks, I was referring to the 12 bounce shot.   Dream scenario, we make the Finals. KD is out for the entire series. Raptors win in 7 with Kyle winning Finals MVP so no one ever talks shit about him ever again and cuz he deserves it after everything he has done. Kawhi re-signs. Kyle negotiates a 3 year extension taking a discount. OG comes back with a Siakam type of leap. Siakam works on his handles and Shooting and becomes a middle class man's Kevin Durant."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gq.com/story/drake-steph-curry-kevin-durant-tattoos/amp
"I don't think Lebron is the best example of an off-ball player largely because he is usually on-ball and directly involved in the offense, but he is fully capable off-ball and succeeds off-ball when he does play like that. I wouldn't describe Lebron as an off-ball player, but that doesn't mean you can not worry about him off-ball.  Regarding the second point, Lebron in 2014 shot 49% on wide open 3s. Comparably, the MVP that year Kevin Durant also shot 49%. You absolutely cannot forget about Lebron off-ball inside or outside the 3 point line he is an elite threat everywhere."
"Um, no?  His first back to back MVPs were interrupted by Derrick Rose. It was also the first year of the Heatles, and they still didnt know how to play all 3 together. Completely fine.  Then, he wins back to back MVPs again, interrupted by Kevin Durant. On a season he was scoring out of his damn mind. Completely fine again.  After that, in comes Curry leading a rising GSW to the playoffs. With monster shooting and top distribution. He won again next year by leading the GSW to a 73-9 record. Again, understandable.  Then what? Westbrook averages a triple double. While leading OKC by himself. If it wasnt for the Harden vs Westbrook, this wouldve been a lock for him.  Only Hardens MVP was debatable with Lebron. I think it shouldve went to Lebron, they both lead their teams to the playoffs by themselves, just that Lebron did what he did with basically 2 different teams that season with all the trades that happened. Id like to say there is a bias against Lebron due to the past MVP race, but i know nothing behind the reasoning in this particular season other than ""Harden compensation"" most people said at the time.  Change it for the best of the regular season, it wont change much."
"That team is built around Curry, and Kevin Durant is able to agree to a role as a second option."
*Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
"&gt;It’d be one thing if they ran into the warriors, but they always crumbled before even reaching the WCF  2014 - vs Thunder 2015 - vs Rockets 2016 - vs Blazers which is probably the most inexcusable but only had Blake for one playoff game and CP3 went out in the middle of the series 2017 - vs Jazz without Blake  as opposed to 2019 D'Antoni who went up against the Warriors who... um, *didn't* have Kevin Durant?"
"The primary reasons would be his own happiness, the style of basketball, the teammates, the city. Legacy narratives has got to be somewhere around #127 of reasons you want to move.  This isn't to say the narrative isn't toxic. I literally [just watched a video on NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/video/2019/05/24/20190524-gametime-warriors-kevin-durant-injury-update) where halfway through Steph says the ball movement doesn't change with KD, they have just a couple extra plays/actions they like to run.   Then right after the interview, it cuts to the NBA TV guy saying, ""So we know there's so much more ball movement when KD is off the floor....""  So it's fucking bad. But I don't know if changing teams helps that or hurts that - I mean, he'll win and play great wherever he goes, and Golden State will still be a decent squad especially if they can get a decent stopgap at small forward with the midlevel like Ariza."
Kevin Durant. Because he fits into every team.
"JVG is an FMVP voter. When game 4 was closing out last year he said, ""I think Kevin Durant is about to win his 2nd straight FMVP."" Douchester deluxe."
He has a Kevin Durant like frame so I suppose the physical tools are there
"No clue if this comment is sarcastic or not, but if anyone’s going to claim the title of ‘basketball genius’, it’s going to be Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant: Warriors  Kawhi Leonard: Raptors
"James Johnson and Kevin Durant would make a very cute couple. “Is this guy bothering you, cupcake?” “No Jamie, thanks for having my back though 😘”"
"I bought a KD jersey his first year in OKC. Doesn't change the fact that I'm a Raptors fan and have been since '95 and always will be.  Heck, Kevin Durant is such a fan of other teams that he straight up joined the Warriors after they clowned on him."
You think Curry would defer to an over the hill CP3?   You are comparing apples to oranges. Kevin Durant is still in his prime and is still considered the best scorer in today's game. Of course Steph is more willing to defer to that caliber of player.
"Yes, a team that has Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green isn't as reliant on one player as the Houston Rockets where the second best player is 5'11"" and can't even create separation against a big man."
"Raptors and Warriors storylines - Steph Curry spent some time in Toronto when Dell Curry played with Vince Carter.

"&gt;Lebron didn’t play like the best player at any point during this season.   Kevin Durant joined the Warriors in 2016. LeBron was clearly the best player.    &gt;Wasn’t saying anything like you suggested. You too mad, bud. It’s just talk.  You implied that them sweeping this Blazers team is an accomplishment."
"Yeah go ahead and shit on my guy Curry but the fact of the matter stands that he has never been benched in a PLAYOFF game. In my honest opinion the only thing i recognize Harden for is being the greatest charlatan in NBA history. He has fooled so many into thinking he is superstar material and deserves to be talked about in the likes of a Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, ect..."
"All depends on what happens in FA.   Only way I see D’Lo walking is if the Nets pair up Kyrie and Durant. Maybe if Kyrie is open to coming by himself they’d let D’Lo walk but I think they could play together sort of like Portland or Houston but worse Defensively.   Really comes down to how Marks see’s the future plan out since he’s said he doesn’t want a team that is paying the Luxury Tax only to be a capped out 7-10 seed like Detroit or Charlotte.   Right now Brooklyn will have $30.3m to spend if they let RHJ, Napier, and Graham walk. Trading the Denver 1st(27) to clear Crabbes final year of $18.5m brings that up to $50m.    With $50m the Nets could do a lot of damage. Then you look at D’Lo and his $21m cap hold or Dinwiddie and his $10m contract. Brooklyn could always trade him away instead of D’Lo when signing Kyrie to get around $60m.    Unlikely but if the Nets could get Tobias Harris on a 4y/$120m deal that scales up like $27m Year 1, $29m Y2, $31m Y3, and $33m Y4 then the Nets could in theory add Tobias Harris and a Max Player not named Kevin Durant since he would be scheduled to make $38.2m this year instead of the $32.7m FA’s like Kyrie, Butler, Kawhi, etc are eligible for.   Wouldn’t hate to see this roster day 1 of next year    * Kyrie - Pinson - ??   * D’Lo - Musa - ??   * LeVert - J.Harris - ??   * T.Harris - Kurucs - ??   * Allen - Davis? - ??   Not sure who the Nets would get on the MLE to fill out their C rotation plus whatever players signed for a Vet Min or Rookies drafted."
"Do you think a team capable of beating ""the greatest team ever assembled"" would have Eric Gordon as their second best player? I think Eric Gordon is a really good NBA player. But he ain't no fucking Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant."
I’m a Sixers fan. I want the Sixers to sign Kevin Durant with the MLE.
"The Rockets last year definitely showed well in the playoffs. They’re the only team that has managed to take the Warriors to 7.   The reason the Rockets haven’t been able to break through in the playoffs is because they are going up against a 73 win team with 3 All NBA guys, and then *in addition* to those guys that team added Kevin Durant. I would take D’Antoni in an instant."

Stephen Curry is *more impactful to the warriors* than Kevin Durant
"That’s just German, for The [Kevin Durant], The."
"Are we all forgetting that a 23 year old MVP, scoring champion Kevin Durant lead the Thunder to the NBA Finals, and a slightly older KD lead them to the WCF?  Yall acting like KD has never been in a leadership role before lol.   &amp;#x200B;  If anything he just wants to fucking ball out and win. All this talk of him ""testing himself"" or ""proving he can be a leader"" is strictly bullshit narratives made by he media. I dont think KD cares at all"
Kevin Durant is better than Stephen Curry.
I love Kevin mother fucking Durant!
another one is the Trailblazers drafting Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden.
"[Oh huh, neato](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/)"
"His name is Kevin Durant, show some respect"
"I guess, but there are literally zero other athletes who get publicly offended as often as Durant. It's kind of hilarious how insecure he is. Please go to New York, Kevin. I would love to see you in an actual sports media market."
Fucking Kevin Durant.  He joins a fucking 73 win team and diving wins the championship like no fucking shit they're going to win fucking fucking steph curry and jerking off like q fucking pussy
"Kevin Durant joined a 73 win, already championship team. Apparently that was the weakest move in nba history."
"I think you and I have very different standards for what it means to be a good off ball player. The second clip you showed me is no different from the first, it's what every player in the league is expected to do when help defense can't recover and you have an open lane. Practically every player in the league is a threat - post up, shooting, drives, etc. - so you obviously have to ""worry about"" them off the ball to a degree but that's a low standard for what it means to be a true off ball threat. Compare the average player to someone like Ray Allen or Steve Nash and there's a huge difference in off ball pressure.   &gt;  In the 2014 season you're referring to Lebron shot 49% FG on wide open shots. For comparison the MVP that year Kevin Durant shot 47% on wide open shots.  Which doesn't tell me anything because it could mean layups or wide open 3 point shots. LeBron's a decent shooter after 2011 but there's a difference between giving a shooter 3 feet of space (e.g LeBron) vs an inch of space (e.g Curry) based on their release speed and shooting threat."
There are also athletes not named Kevin Durant who pop off on athletes too
 /u/INSIGNIAFISHER  are you the REAL Kevin Durant?
"When he's left open he moves. You can't leave him unattended. Here's a clip from Game 3 of that finals. Lebron sets a screen for Ray Allen and stays engaged in the play off-ball understanding he is open: https://streamable.com/r071n  The point we're responding to is the comment that you don't have to worry about Lebron off-ball and that's insane. You have to worry about everyone off-ball especially stars even guys like Giannis. Obviously Lebron doesn't play like Curry does, but you can't just not worry about him off-ball he will burn you every single time. In the 2014 season you're referring to Lebron shot [49% FG on wide open shots](https://stats.nba.com/players/shots-closest-defender-10/?Season=2013-14&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CloseDefDistRange=6%2B%20Feet%20-%20Wide%20Open&amp;sort=FG_PCT&amp;dir=1). For comparison the MVP that year Kevin Durant shot 47% on wide open shots."
"I think that this is literally the definition of Tim Duncan’s entire career. Buy in to the coach, never be a malcontent, work hard and be respectful every day, and do all of this while being a top-5 player in the league for pretty much your entire career. Made the playoffs his entire career, championships in 5/15 years, and absolute humility paired with that level of absolute dominance. Even as his abilities shrank, Timmy readily ceded some of them so that he could remain elite at the things that he still could.  Steph is definitely running the same playbook as Timmy, setting the same example of “the superstar who is willing to adapt in whatever way is necessary to win more”.    He occasionally gets into slumps that he could shoot himself out of in one game if he got to take ~25 shots. But if Durant’s on the floor, Steph’s only taking 15-20, most nights. I’m sad that we never really got the offense that was basically the 2015-2017 era team with Kevin Fucking Durant in the Harrison Barnes role. Steph being in Human Torch more on his own and having KD as his release valve is just ridiculous.   If you’ve ever watched early 13-14 Warriors clips, Iguodala is incredibly, obviously the guy who takes the team to the  next level. He gives up absolutely nothing while he’s on the floor, and just unlocks so much action on offense that finals teams literally have to live or die by how he shoots.   In whichever Finals matchup we see,  I expect to see whoever Kawhi or Giannis is guarding (probably KD...) just function as a decoy. A top-3 player against a 1st-team all-defense player is probably going to be a bit inefficient in an ordinary iso situation. Steph and Klay off of screens will light up their opponents if they can keep the EC stars busy with Durant."

"You're getting downvoted but he simply isn't top 5.  There are legitimate arguments he's not top 10.  People hate you for saying it until you start throwing names down, so here goes:  &gt;  Definitely better than Kobe:  Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James.  &gt;  Probably better than Kobe, but it's a discussion:  Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Oscar Robertson, Kevin Durant  &gt;  Probably not better than Kobe, but it's a discussion:  Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone, Allen Iverson  A lot of people are going to be unhappy with me about this, I'm sure."
"Same man I would be stoked to have those two, I think that instantly makes them at least as good as Denver and Portland. Plus with warriors most likely losing Durant who knows what happens. Vuc is like a young Kevin Love and Beal is like a younger Klay Thompson but with worse D and better overall offense."
"There was a quote from the Blazers GM at the time... it was something like, ""We think Kevin Durant could be a ten-time all-star. But we think Greg Oden could win ten championships.""  Funny, he was right about one thing."
"He also got the swallowed whistle vs the magic  My argument is his 70% at the rim also leads to turnovers due to no calls. Contact which strips energy and fast breaks the other way   To consider:   His minutes are up by almost 3 per game, his usage is up to 33% from 28 and he is shooting more fga than the regular season.   Yet somehow his ft dip to 7 in these playoffs so far down from his reg season total this year of 7.1 which honestly was low as is.   Compare that to Kevin Durant.  Who shot 6.5 fta in the regular season.  Who's usage went from 29 to 33 but is shooting 10.7 fta a game.   Care to analyze why?   Either kd is a flopping bitch or more reasonably kawhi doesn't get superstar calls."
Kevin Durant was in high school when the last album was released :-(

"I found this little tidbit  &gt;The Longhorns’ men’s and women’s basketball team as well as administrators greeted Durant as he viewed the program’s refurbished practice facility that stemmed from his donation. Durant said he has formed close ties with other NBA players that attended University of Texas, including Tristan Thompson, Avery Bradley and Cory Joseph. And Durant credited various mentors, including TJ Ford and PJ Tucker, from helping him when he played for the Longhorns.  https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/06/kevin-durant-calls-visit-to-university-of-texas-incredible-and-overwhelming/"
"yeah, sure, why would anyone try to scheme for kevin fucking durant"
"&gt;	Kevin Durant said Kyrie was top 5 most skilled. Is he an idiot too?  Actual KD quote is:  “top three most skilled players in the league in my opinion, one of the most skilled players to ever play,”    Which is a massive difference from ‘top 5’ and even further still from ‘most skilled ever’.   So yeah, Kellerman is still an idiot."
"The defense shifts to focus on literally every superstar :). Except Kevin Durant, he didn’t want that challenge.  It’s more like in the regular season defenses aren’t as focused or game planned which is catastrophic vs steph and the warriors, it takes a concerted effort that most wont give in the regular season to contain them. But in the playoffs, they have a game plan and focus on staying with him, doubling him, playing physical (which again is normal for superstars in the playoffs). Steph drops off because he’s not a real number one option on a championship team and can more easily be slowed down than a Lebron, Durant, kawhi type player."
Kevin Durant said Kyrie was top 5 most skilled.  Is he an idiot too?
"3 point snipers are currently the goats of the league, look at the Golden State Warriors. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, James Harden  3 point shots are basically the most important skill to have.  Shooting is the top priority, 3s are often uncontested because you have so much space. Then defense.  The only reason the Warriors lost recently is because they couldnt make their shots, when Steph makes his shots it's a blowout, and the reason the Warriors have so many blowouts is because they make more shots, and more 3 point shots than other teams, they make them at a higher percentage.  Of course you need every other skill to win, but scoring more often than the opponent is the most important skill."
I know it might not be you but Kevin Durant kills all that stats shit. Until i see them out its over.   Source: Had the best player of the generation lose 3 times to that 1 team.

Well in his defense Kevin Durant is an amazing player and can definitely do it all by himself if needed. A lot of you guys are just posers. Have you ever even played basketball?  -sent from Kevin Durant's iPhone
"4 contenders for FMVP: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green"

"The difference is in my hypothetical, the other team still has Kevin Durant and Steph Curry."
"Dude. You’re absolutely bugging if you think that Kevin “Y’all know who I am” Durant isn’t a top 5 player. He’s not only top 5, I’d argue he’s the best, most complete player in the entire NBA"
"lol. They're literally both there.   Liking them is not mutually exclusive. I personally consider them the top 2 players (i'm biased though).   Steph's ""Sky Fucker"" mode warps defences and ignites his entire team, it also makes his shooting range virtually limitless.   KD's ""I'm Kevin Durant"" mode makes him virtually unstoppable, when he's playing like this; he's the best player of all time.   Bonus:   Klay has a ""Toaster"" mode  He virtually cannot miss. The less dribbles he does, the more accurate he becomes. It's the most potent of all of the warriors modes, but also the most rare."
I love Future Knick Kevin Durant
"Kawhi was doing the same historically unprecedented high-volume, high-efficiency scoring in the 2016 post-season before he got injured. When he got injured he held the league record for a playoff season with the highest TS% over 25+ points per game. Kevin Durant eventually surpassed that record in the same playoffs. But now Kawhi's 2018-19 season is #1.  [rank](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=Y&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;year_min=1980&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=8&amp;c2stat=pts_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=25&amp;c3stat=ts_pct&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=60&amp;order_by=ts_pct)  Can't believe some people legitimately thought DeMar was reasonable compensation. Pop might be a god, but you can't replace Kawhi."
"Naw, he goes on hot streaks sometimes. That is just how shooters are.  What makes the Warriors so great right now is even if Steph is cold, then there is Klay. If Klay is cold, Kevin Durant is always incredibly consistent."
1. Kevin Durant   2. Kawhi Leonard (Winning this series will put him at #1 for me).  3. Steph Curry   4. James Harden  5. Joel Embiid / Nikola Jokic / Giannis Antetokounmpo
Give the ball to Kevin Durant. He is on fire this year.
"It was just a joke.   Actually that is what I like about those types of players. I want players who will just play the sport than act like a bunch of drama queens. (LeBron James, Kevin Durant, LeVeon Bell, Antonio Brown). In fact if this was Instagram one of those guys would want to take me on right now."
"I'm a big fan of Kawhi's also, but if you aren't familiar with Kevin Durant   please do some research.   KD at 23yo averaged 31/6/2 on 65 TS% in the NBA Finals vs Miami Heat superteam, when he was 23 years old.    Kawhi Leonard won DPOY in 2016 . He faced Durant's Thunder in the playoffs and KD treated him like a child. Dropped an easy 29/7/4 on 60 TS% on Kawhi's headtop in 2016 WCSF. Like come on now, this man has been doing this.   And this is all when he was on the Thunder. Like we can leave his Warriors years aside, Durant was top ~20-25 all time before he even left OKC."
"Small Forward/Shooting Guard? Guess he plays the 4 sometimes, but no one is calling Kevin Durant a power forward.  There have been great rebounders, post defenders, etc at his position, but his unique skillset (tall as fuck) is something he's really put to use the last ~5 years.  No one has played around the rim on defense from his position before."
[“can’t win with those cats”](https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/kevin-durant-appears-trash-thunder-coach-teammates-article-1.3504175)
and why is that? what argument does kevin durant have to not be a top 5 player in the league? that's absurd
"so you're removing AD, that's fair  then you're going to remove stephen curry or kevin durant..? ""doesn't matter which"" what?  that seems a bit absurd to me."
Send mean tweets from fake accounts!?  Someone get Kevin Durant on the phone
"I hate everyone on that team except, of course, future Knick Kevin Durant..."
Fuck Zaza Pachulia and Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant  Best scorer in the league hands down. He is an extremely versatile scorer, can hit 3's at a very high percentage, can play out of the post, and can take it to the rim. There isn't a more well rounded scorer than Durant in the league today.   His defence is very underrated as well. He is long and can guard 1-5, a good shot blocker and fundamentally sound. He doesn't get the recognition he deserves on D.  He can be a playmaker as well, but doesn't really need to be that guy with Curry and Green on his team.  All around he would have to be the most complete player in the league. I know that people don't like giving him credit because of personal hatred, but theres no denying that he's just an insane talent that can make an impact in many ways."
"Kevin Durant, is that you?"
Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant are the best players in the world without question. I want to see Raptors make it to the finals just to see this matchup.
Steph Curry Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Draymond Green Andre Igoudala
"Lol raptors fan here, but I think Kevin Durant has been even better"
"Ya know, if Kevin Durant didn’t play for the warriors I’d love a finals with him and Leonard.  But alas."
He is Kevin Durant you know his name
"Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard teaming up next year confirmed, absolutely annihilate everyone in the post season it'll be a rap"
Only reason I don’t have Durant is because in my mind he is “KD” not just kevin.
You have Steph on a micro level and then Kevin Durant on a macro level as the greatest front runner in NBA history.  Eerie coincidence.
"I would say that those stats suggest that he actually is clutch when needed. Is there some kind of minimum of shots/clutch situations to be considered clutch?  2017 were Warriors super dominant with KD's arrival and noone really needed to take clutch shots. 2018 and 2019 he missed all together almost 60 games, if I count well, ofc he wont be high in total rankings. Maybe some kind of adjustment to games played for all players? Like clutch2 shots per 100 possessions or something.  ""Double teams fluster him, and playing with Kevin Durant means he does not see double teams often."" - The second part is absolutely not true. Cavs were trapping him hard in both 2017 finals and last year in last two games. Clippers were trapping him after G1 this year, just to name a few."
&lt; Yanick Moreira (Kevin Durant lookalike)  they look the same except for the eyes. someone care to do an eye-swap?
"He’s having an easy time because he’s Kevin Durant. Curry and Klay may be better pure shooters than KD, but if their outside shot isn’t falling or they get pressed on the perimeter they have a much harder time scoring.   KD can still get his outside shot over most defenders who are shorter than him. Or if his 3 isn’t falling he can get to the basket or work his way into a more manageable 10-15 footer or layup, which he can still shoot largely uncontested. It’s much harder for Curry to do that because he’s only 6’3.  IMO it’s insanely impressive that Curry and Kyrie are as dominant as they are offensively because they take the highest degree of difficulty shots of anyone in the league. They both (usually) finish at a high percentage at the rim, but it’s more to do with craftiness and skill than it is athleticism.   As such, they are prone to have games where those insanely difficult shots aren’t falling and all of a sudden they are very pedestrian (last night I would say Curry just missed a bunch of easy layups more than anything though). KD, Lebron, and Kawhi are less prone to these games because they can use their athleticism/size to work to create easier shots.   The way that players like Curry and Dame have expanded their range has really increased the volatility of games. It makes them almost impossible to defend when those shots are going, but because they are high variability shots it also leads to ugly nights when they’re not falling."
"Houston feels like sagging from Draymond wsn't doing the trick so the defense is now fully extended to the perimeter. [The Warriors got a couple of makes from three from pindowns](https://i.imgur.com/u8tvN8b.gifv), creating a half second long hiccup in a switching scheme which is enough for the players in question. Warriors had a good amount of matchup hunting as well ([see Curry driving on Capela and KD shooting over Harden](https://i.imgur.com/0p3ufk3.gifv), both coming off the Curry/Durant pick and roll).  The Rockets offense gave the first action to CP3, running Pick and Rolls and trying to generate some openings in semi-transition [but should block this first and faster approach you go straight to an ISO on whoever Curry is guarding](https://imgur.com/a/BSs8Q7H). Overall, i though having Chris do a lot more even with Harden out there was a successful plan, since a lot of the series was so heavily focused on containing a Harden-centric offense in those minutes and this switches up everything about how Houston starts their halfcourt sets. It was jarring at times how Harden was fully taking over when Paul rested and not the other way around.  [This is Capela finally learning and adjusting to the lob that was destroying the Rockets over the first two games](https://i.imgur.com/crXBX5V.gifv). He showed also a lot more aggressiveness in offensive rebounding, which they desperately need to win. His play was huge in what ended up being a very close first quarter. _______________________________________________________________  The early second quarter is Paul trying to exploit the Warriors pick and roll coverage (and Jerebko). [The first time around, Tucker is baited into the floater but on the next attempt he curls a pass around Jerebko](https://i.imgur.com/VIgKkhQ.gifv) for a Nenê open at the rim.

With great play by Gordon (more on that later) and good defense - helped by how only Klay and Kevin seem to be the only players involved in any sort of offensive action in that second unit but i don't want to take credit away from the D - the Rockets had rightfully a lead hovering double digits. This would be the lead the Rockets carried through most of the game and the most bench-heavy minutes for the Warriors. I'll just say that the bench score only 7 points for the Warriors today.  Eric Gordon in the first half - 20 points - was doing everything. Already showed one of his drives and [that's some great defense by him on Klay](https://i.imgur.com/EI0wrvM.gifv). The Warriors will many times live with Gordon being the closer of plays as long as they keep Harden touches to a minimum so it's extra devastating if he gets like this.

For all of I've been writing about Houston, the lead and kept hovering around the same margin, mostly sustained by Durant's production and by the time we're rolling in the final period of regulation he had almost single handedly turned it into a one possession game.

Great job milking those seconds as well.  [*I wanna die*](https://i.imgur.com/fkMhkVn.gifv).  Curry had a disastrous game, in case it wasn't obvious. Might have been his worst I have seen. He blew multiple layups ([including a HUGE one in OT](https://i.imgur.com/rDjFEiw.gifv)) and [you *have* to take advantage of these mistakes](https://i.imgur.com/hVreTXl.gifv). And you could see him hesitating in the second clip and he had a couple of other shots where it happened and that cannot ever happen.  PJ Tucker is a fantastic player, killed us in the boards and his fantastic help defense. Harden made the clutch shots he had to make after surrendering the first half to Gordon. All their role players showed up at the moments their names were called and taking away the House and Faried minutes was huge. They knew this was the series on the line and they rose to the moment. The Warriors weren't in a lot of foul trouble and didn't turnover the ball, so this must feel like an even bigger win.  Kevin Durant is the best player in the world.  Other Notes:  James Harden wasn't having the best shooting night from deep as well but his finishing around the rim was on point - finding windows with hesitations and shifts in speed. This would result in the coverage changing to trapping him off screens.  I though Livingston did nothing today but muck up the spacing. Our bench was a misery anyway.  [I don't like this](https://i.imgur.com/ghNknwf.gifv). It's too far from the basket to try posting up (because of those extra steps to get to the pass) and Paul is already better than most with bigger guards in such a scenario."

And as Curry continued to not make a bucket, [Iguodola stopped Houston from capitalizing on the other end](https://i.imgur.com/toFBETo.gifv).  [Draymond Green worked his ass off in the final two minutes of the 4th](https://i.imgur.com/ASXj5mu.gifv). [Iguodola makes the clutch 3 after PJ Tucker made the sensible decision of coming to help on the Durant drive](https://i.imgur.com/Kyfoe1M.gifv). An open shot you're willing to give but sometimes it bites you. Harden would tie it up at the line and the Warriors don't chose to take the chance for a 2-1 but [settle for an awful shot](https://i.imgur.com/PTS6xkS.gifv), even for KD. [Klay's amazing defense of Paul takes it to overtime](https://i.imgur.com/1BiTTqA.gifv). _________________________________________________________________  I have no idea why the Warriors stopped going to KD during OT. Even more so when they were in the bonus. Curry had 5 fouls and was being hunted down but the big clutch moment of the play comes [after Harden gives up on that switch and drills the stepback against the man who has been his best defender](https://i.imgur.com/RZxEH7y.gifv). Great job milking those seconds as well.  [*I wanna die*](https://i.imgur.com/fkMhkVn.gifv).  Curry had a disastrous game, in case it wasn't obvious. Might have been his worst I have seen. He blew multiple layups ([including a HUGE one in OT](https://i.imgur.com/rDjFEiw.gifv)) and [you *have* to take advantage of these mistakes](https://i.imgur.com/hVreTXl.gifv). And you could see him hesitating in the second clip and he had a couple of other shots where it happened and that cannot ever happen.  PJ Tucker is a fantastic player, killed us in the boards and his fantastic help defense. Harden made the clutch shots he had to make after surrendering the first half to Gordon. All their role players showed up at the moments their names were called and taking away the House and Faried minutes was huge. They knew this was the series on the line and they rose to the moment. The Warriors weren't in a lot of foul trouble and didn't turnover the ball, so this must feel like an even bigger win.  Kevin Durant is the best player in the world.  Other Notes:  James Harden wasn't having the best shooting night from deep as well but his finishing around the rim was on point - finding windows with hesitations and shifts in speed. This would result in the coverage changing to trapping him off screens.  I though Livingston did nothing today but muck up the spacing. Our bench was a misery anyway.  [I don't like this](https://i.imgur.com/ghNknwf.gifv). It's too far from the basket to try posting up (because of those extra steps to get to the pass) and Paul is already better than most with bigger guards in such a scenario."
"At the end of the day, the fact that you're comparing a 6'3"" point guard that people are surprised can dunk to Kevin Durant and LeBron James in order to bring attention to a ""weakness"" in his game only really emphasizes how great of a player Curry is. Steph might be more vulnerable to double teams, but LeBron also is vulnerable to a cold night from his teammates and KD is getting passes out of those double teams and can be suspect to losing his legs if he has to defend against somebody in the post or play against a physical defender.  LeBron and KD play different roles and positions from Steph so of course his weakness would be exaggerated when using them as a comparison point. But I'm a little confused what popular perception you're criticizing when you're comparing that player to two of possibly the top 5-10 players of all time who don't even play his position in order to bring attention to his weaknesses."
"Imagine being KD in that game and having to be all like ""damn, Steph, you fuckin' hot, all sexy with your tight body and horrific 17 point performance in a must-win game 3. I would totally resign with the warriors, both my brand and the real me."" when all he really wants to do is fuck off to the Knicks. Like seriously imagine having to be KD and not only stand on the court while Steph bricks another three and flaunts his gay shimmy celebration in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing his stretched ankles and neckbeard, and just stand there, brick after brick, game after game, while he perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking visage but his haughty attitude as everyone on the bench tells him he's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, STEPH CURRY SHOOTS LIKE THAT?? because they're not the ones who have to stand there and watch his feminine fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day.

How does Kevin Durant get 3 rebounds in 49 minutes?

If you’re Harden or Kevin Durant probably
Um... kevin Durant
Kevin durant is better than dwade
"One time Micheal Jordan went 3-17 shooting, with just 4 boards and 2 assists.   Or the time in the playoffs he had 8 turnovers (including the one in the last 10 seconds when the game was on the line), and shot 8-22.  And there are people who genuinely believe that Jordan guy is top 10 all time.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Remember when Kevin Durant went 1-9 from three point land in the playoffs? Or when Lebron went 3-14? a whopping 3 field goals in an entire playoff game? Kobe went 4-20 and didnt even get double figures."
Except he's on the same team as Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant Okc flair. He’s a warriors fan.

"Curry is now used to having a shit game and then making 1 key shot at the end and it absolves him of everything, then all of a sudden the shoulder shimmies come out, the laughing at the other team, the smug smirk and acting like he knew it was going to happen that way. The team is full of this kind of douchebaggery - Draymond is an asshole, Klay is that fake tough guy, Curry is that holier than thou who throws a tantrum or sulks like an emo fuckboi when he doesn't get his way, Kerr is the idiot boss who knows nothing but still finds success and acts like he's a genius and that everyone else is an idiot who ""doesn't get it"".   The team is so full of this kind of toxic behavior simply because they hold a tremendously stacked deck against the rest of the league.   They've been humbled before, but then they added the most candyass mentally weak emotionally stunted manchild in Kevin Durant to double-down and cement their shitty behaviors even more.  This is what happens when you put a bunch of shitty 12 year old brats on one team and let them run roughshod on a playground with 8 year olds."
Is Kevin Durant not a top 3 player in the NBA right now? Why is it ridiculous after three missed shots in a row that I would expect someone to pass to him.   Is Klay Thompson a Splash Brother? Where did the narritive come from that Staph Curry is the only reason this team is so good.   This whole team is stacked. Sometimes the shots dont fall. Even the greatest have off nights. On those nights just pass to KD or Klay.
If I have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on either side of him? Yeah I want him to stop shooting.
"Well they also have Kevin Durant, klay Thompson, dreymond green, and iggy who couldn’t miss a shot"
"Do you even know who Mike Breen is? The dude who traveled is Stephen Curry. I get that you became a Warriors fan when Kevin Durant joined the team, but at least learn some things before you start chattering.  Read my comment again. Mike Breen, the commentator in the clip, said that it was *close* to a travel. That wasn’t just close to being one. It *was* one and then some."
"Waahh waaah waah. Curry's a generational talent that doesn't mind passing off to a greater scorer. That's whats got him 3 championships and 2 mvps. Exposed? Dude had been working his way up through the playoffs as the head honcho for years till he finally one the championship. Then the next year they get the reg season record, go 7 games against an insane OKC time (with *gasp* Kevin Durant!) and then get one Harrison Barnes shot away from another championship (against another super team, but we won't go there). But yeah...exposed. Cool username."
That would be so cool if Westbrook was in Golden State instead of Steph because that would mean the Rockets would win this series and then sign Kevin Durant in Free Agency.
"I'm not gonna lie, I've actually wanted Curry to be the best player on Earth since the 73 win unanimous MVP season. I've hated Kevin Durant and tried to validate Steph being the best player on the Warriors based on regular season performance. You're right, tons of people have rationalized it the way I have.  But this post-season I've slowly been finally reaching the breaking point until tonight. Kevin Durant is flat out a better basketball player than Stephen Curry, and Steph is good in the playoffs but Warrior fans really misconstrue how good he is and they know it.  Steph is always a clear step down in the playoffs compared to his regular season, even if hes still good. Steph is absolutely inconsistent in the playoffs, he just has a team that can pick him up when he inevitably has 1-3 off games per series."
She retweeted a bunch of things like this though   KEVIN WAYNE DURANT IS THE BEST PLAYER ON PLANET EARTH AND THE WARRIORS SHOULD TRY TO RE-SIGN HIM THIS SUMMER   &amp;#x200B;   [https://twitter.com/DrewShiller/status/1124864396042223616](https://twitter.com/DrewShiller/status/1124864396042223616)
Kevin Durant is carrying them
get by on...kevin fucking durant
If you take into account he has Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson taking pressure off him not really
Ya honestly you might get to call yourself Kevin Durant now
Ya honestly you might get to call yourself Kevin Durant now
""" Never seen anything quite like this: KEVIN DURANT PLAYED POINT GUARD THE ENTIRE 4TH QUARTER, DRIBBLING IT UP, DROPPING DIMES, DROPPING JUMPERS. Best Player on the Planet. By far. ""     Skip Bayless is a national treasure lmao"
"Because Harden is a better defender than curry now. People who say he doesn't play D dont watch him anymore. He's never injured. He's never played with a teammate as good as Klay Thompson, or Kevin Durant. Steph has both. It's really that simple for me. You can have your opinion ill have Mine."
"Plus Minis is not always accurate, this could simply mean Kevin Durant played against rocket starters more often or rockets got hot why he was in."
Strength in ~~numbers~~ Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
OP is Kevin Durant then he gilded this from the one of his alts. I'm also convinced he gave platinum twice to the steph curry missed dunk post.
"It's nothing new. Curry almost never lives up to his towering reputation in the playoffs. He is a great playoffs player and has a lot of gravity of course, but he's not that kind of player who just goes out and dominates good teams in the playoffs, hitting clutch shots left and right. His reputation is inflated by regular season heroics, beating an injury-ravaged Cavs team in 2015, and having guys like Klay ""2016 Game 6"" Thompson and Kevin ""just fucking unfair"" Durant on his team. Which is not to say that Thompson is better than Curry, but it is Thompson and not Curry who has the clutchest performance any of these Warriors have ever had in the playoffs. Curry has a lot of fans who get upset when people say that he is great but not as great as they think he is, so such criticisms often get downvoted heavily here. Oh well."
Kevin Durant: “i’m just goin... i’m leaving”  Holy fuck
Kevin Durant average TS% in OKC: 60.5  Kevin Durant average TS% in Golden State: 64   KD in the playoffs with OKC: 57.5% TS  KD in the playoffs with GSW: 64.3% TS  KD was usually significantly worse in the playoffs than he was in the regular season in OKC except for 2012 when they went to the Finals.  It’s no coincidence all of that changed in Golden State
If Kevin Durant could average 200 points a game the Warriors would go 16-0 in the playoffs every year
Uh i can’t believe iggy is important to the team especially vs the rockets but that kevin durant is 10x more important?
"Imagine being KD in that game and having to be all like ""damn, Steph, you fuckin' hot, all sexy with your tight body and horrific 17 point performance in a must-win game 3.

Okay so Kevin Durant gets reached in every drive
"It's not that people are sick of watching a dynasty, teams like the Lakers and bulls didn't receive all this hate. It's the fashion in which it came to be. You have the 73-9 Warriors ADDING the second best player in the league to your squad. Along with events such as injuring kawhi and singing DMC, the Warriors last glimpse of positivity is Steph Curry who is a good model but is in quick decline, and the meme of Klay Thompson on this sub. In my opinion, kevin Durant joining the Warriors ruined the NBA experience. Everyone with a brain knows the Warriors win the cup with hiccups or not doesn't matter  Also draymond"
"Kevin Durant, 10/24/2019 at Madison Square Garden getting ready for Knick's first home game.  Reporter: What made you decide to leave the warriors?  KD: Nah fuck that little bitch curry for that dunk."
Well it was easily the worst he's played since Game 7 2016 so I dunno maybe we can stop pretending the guy who gets bullied by Austin Rivers is better than Kevin Durant.
"Your the same type of person that be would say Patrick Beverly was locking up Kevin Durant after game one. One bad game doesn't change a players legacy. Steph is the system, when he has a bad game they lose"
Kevin Durant
"2016 was a crazy playoff basketball year. The '16 Spurs were the best 2-seed ever - 67 wins, which would have been the 1-seed in almost any other year. Then they lost to the 3-seed Thunder, who blew a 3-1 lead to the reigning champs, who themselves blew a 3-1 lead to LeBron James' second superteam. And then, somehow, the Cavs were even more dominant in the first 3 rounds of 2017, and swept the first two rounds. Then we get the IT business, with him playing amazingly despite losing everything: his sister, his teeth, and the first three games of the series. In the finals, we got the LeBron backboard self-lob (part 1), the Kevin Durant left wing 3-pointer (part 1), a glimpse of a possible 16-0, then JR Smith catching fire in the last two games of the series.  Playoff basketball is fun."
"Idk, I think the warriors ceiling is higher without Durant because they actually move the ball instead if letting Durant do ISO’s. The floor is higher with Durant, but the ceiling is tighter without him just because it allows steph, klay, and green to do what they do.   They are good either way, but with Durant their ceiling is lower, floor is higher. Meaning they don’t play as efficiently with Durant, but he can bail them out because he’s that good—making their floor higher.   This is coming from a Mavs fan who hates the warriors and Kevin Durant."
"Ingram: ""My small Kevin Durant like frame!"" LOL"
"&gt;Easier job why because now he has to guard 1 of 2 of the most prolific scores in the league? OP is insinuating that Tucker will eat these guys up on D since KD is gone.   No he isn't?? Where are you getting this? The Rockets will have a much easier time guarding the Warriors without KD in the lineup but he's not saying Tucker will guard either of them. Tucker will however be able to help off of Draymond or Iguodala very easily compared to Kevin Durant  &gt;Steph has been playing average (for him) this series and with KD out don't tell me he won't have the fire to come out blazing. &gt;  You might believe that, I'm just going by how he has been playing all series. You're talking about ""fire"". That's not something to really argue against.    &gt;Like I said, OP is making assumptions that got them giving a 10-15% chance of winning. How do you even come up with that %?  By believing KD was the player keeping this series competitive."
"i’ll just copy paste something I saw here the other day  2018 Playoffs (Last Year)  Value Over Replacement Player  Harden - 4th  Curry - 6th  Box Plus/Minus  Harden - 2nd  Curry - 6th  Win Shares  Harden - 7th  Curry - 8th  PER  Harden - 6th  Curry - Outside the Top 10  Curry did not have a better playoffs than Harden even last year (and certainly not this year). ESPN kept a running ladder for most valuable players in the playoffs. The link below has the final rankings even after the Finals. They gave the edge to Harden over KD at 2, but I personally would have KD 2nd and Harden 3rd because of the finals.  Curry was ranked 6th on the list. People forget that there were legitimate questions about Curry's health last year in the playoffs because he was playing so poorly. He literally did not play the first 6 games of the playoffs and in the 15 games he did play he scored under 20 points 4 different times. He did have a really good overall finals despite the 3 for 16 performance for 11 points in game 3, but to say Curry outplayed Harden in the playoffs last year is very very debatable.  http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/mvptracker23754885/nba-playoff-mvps-ranking-lebron-kevin-durant-james-harden-top-superstars   Also, how can you bring up him flaming out in the finals lol he was 22 and coming off the bench. He went off in the WCF to get them there in the first place."
"&gt;The Warriors remain the favorite to win the NBA title after Kevin Durant's calf injury on Wednesday night, but Golden State's advantage over the field has decreased overnight, according to Draft Kings.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Durant and Co. entered Wednesday night at -120 to win the Finals before Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals. The Warriors are now reportedly at +110 to claim their third-straight title, even despite Durant's expected absence from Game 6 against the Rockets.    &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Golden State entered the season with -200 odds to win the title. Its odds fell to -175 when DeMarcus Cousins injured his quad on April 19.     &gt;Warriors: +110   &gt;   &gt;Bucks: +180   &gt;   &gt;Rockets: +400   &gt;   &gt;Raptors: +750   &gt;   &gt;Nuggets: +1,800   &gt;   &gt;76ers: +4,000   &gt;   &gt;Trail Blazers: +7,500"
"""Ow..My Kevin Durant like frame"" lol"
Kevin Durant is slept on as one of the greatest playoff performers of all time
My small Kevin Durant-like frame lmao
"I'll bite. Compare [this season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id1_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players) alone. On a very similar usage %, Curry has a better VORP, better BPM, and very similar PER. Durant's edge on Curry in advanced stats are pretty much all defensive (blocks and rebounds) which are skills that require more physical play.   Curry's stat line, on the other hand, comes largely from his elite shooting, which is one of the things that older players like Wade or Rose try to develop once their explosiveness is gone.  Healthy KD is probably a better player than Steph, but injured, I don't think it's a contest."
"you’re actually comparing KD and Klay to eg and tucker. That’s hilarious. Tucker makes shots off catch and shoot opportunities harden creates. That’s his entire offense. Kevin Durant is literally better then steph, he takes away so much pressure.  Klay is a way better shooter then EG and a better defender"
Kevin Durant.
"Franchise changing not defining.  2018:Deandre Ayton (potential), Luka, and Bagley all look like future all stars. Hell Traye Young was 5th and I'd count him.  2015: Towns  2014: Embiid  2012: Anthony Davis  2011: Kyrie (championship)  2010: John Wall  2009: Blake Griffin, James Harden  2008: Derrick Rose, Russell Westbrook (at 4th)  2007: Kevin Durant, Al Horford  2006: Aldridge  2005: Chris Paul (at 4th)  2004: Dwight Howard  2003: LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Wade (at 5th)  2002: Yao  2001: Kwame Brown (oh hell yeah)  1999: Elton Brand, Steve Francis, Baron Davis  1997: Tim Duncan, Chauncey Billups  All of those guys were either the face of the franchise, changes the direction of the franchise, or were the best player for their respective teams"
Hahaha haha Fuck Kevin Durant.   This opens up the best Kevin Durant timeline.  Warriors go on to sweep the wcf and finals without him while he watches.   God I’m so salty.
The warriors will lose this series. We are nothing without Kevin Durant. I would be shocked if we win
-Kevin Durant +Game 6 Klay Thompson  I think the warriors will be fine.
"&gt; Curry is a top 10-15 player ever,  So which 13 are you removing?  https://www.lineups.com/articles/top-50-nba-players-all-time/  LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Wilt Chamberlain  Magic Johnson  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Kevin Durant  Tim Duncan  Larry Bird  Kobe Bryant  Shaquille O'Neal  Oscar Robertson  Hakeem Olajuwon  Jerry West  Moses Malone  Karl Malone  Julius Erving  Kevin Garnett  Elvin Hayes  Charles Barkley  Walt Frazier  Dirk Nowitzki  John Havlicek  Scottie Pippen  George Gervin  Rick Barry  David Robinson  Isiah Thomas  John Stockton"
"Lonzo over Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, or Kevin Durant  It's not ideal forsure but I'd take a 1v1 switch onto Lonzo over any of those guys"
ESPN BREAKING: Steph Curry and teammates display amusement and pleasure at injury to teammate Kevin Durant.
In summary: Kevin Durant is a pretty solid basketball player
"The Warriors are 26-1 in the last 27 games they have played without Kevin Durant, but with Steph Curry in the lineup."
Feel he's just being realistic. Last year was the year for Houston. I don't think they'll have the chance again where they were literally 3-2 up on a Kevin Durant warriors
"Epic burn 😎.   I dislike the Warriors in a basketball context because Kevin Durant, a top 5 basketball player, joined a 73 win team. This team has made playoff basketball very boring because of the inevitability of their winning. As a basketball fan, this sucks. We all live meaningless lives, and the amount of guaranteed suffering we’ll endure in the future is terrifying. Family member will die, we will get sick, we will be stuck in employment for decades, the climate is falling apart, far-right ideologies are spreading quickly around the world, and our own mortality is around the corner. Living absolutely sucks ass. Basketball is a fun escape, and the Kevin Durant era warriors have made that escape far less enjoyable."
"I don’t hate Kevin Durant, and I don’t hate the Warriors. But I hate Kevin Durant being on the Warriors."
*remaps F5 to MRI machine*   [Woj] Golden State forward Kevin Durant now has either superpowers or cancer. We’re not sure which at this moment.  Kerr: “I can guarantee it’s not cancer.”
"Nah, I fucking hate Kevin Durant. Doesn't mean that I want to see anyone injured."
"\[Wojnarowski\] Golden State's Kevin Durant has suffered a mild strain in his right calf and expected to be re-evaluated right now, league source tells ESPN."
"And that's why your not a GM. You would have passed on Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, and probably even Kevin Durant"
"James Harden smells his armpit with a sigh of relief. ""I'm so sorry,"" he says. ""There was nothing I could done to make it stop. The ball had already touched the roof and I was so confused that it just bounced around.""  ""You're right,"" the coach says. ""The roof is broken, but it's okay. I can fix it right now, and it will work fine."" And without a word, he's gone.  It's a sad state of affairs that this time, though, the referee decided to take no action, though, that doesn't do anything to lessen the disappointment on the players' voices.  When the score was down, they were right to be angry. When the game was over, Harden didn't win. He won the game. His teammate Kevin Durant scored 34 points in 33 minutes.  And when his teammate Durant did score, it was like watching a great game of Russian roulette on the court, with no winner. But he didn't win the game either."
"Kevin Durant is out  Kevin Durant is out for 3-6 months after his knee surgery, and there aren't many teams that can afford him. The Kings have no shortage of salary cap space, so it's easy to see him coming back for the playoffs despite his hip injury.  The Kings also have a few options on the draft table after losing Jason Thompson to another knee injury, as well as Brandon Rush, who was selected by the Lakers in this year's draft after suffering a similar injury against the Indiana Pacers.  This year's draft also features a potential franchise player in DeJuan Blair, whom the Warriors saw as well.  GTFO"
Kevin “literally the best player in the playoffs rn” Durant
Imagine thinking a players worth as a player has anything to do with rings  I guess Robert horry is way better than Kevin Durant
And you’re only in the second round because of a guy named Kevin Durant
"people are not giving the two greatest shooters of all time enough credit. Adding Kevin Durant to this Warriors core would have been like adding Hakeem to the Bulls. Take Hakeem off that Bulls time after adding him, and what are you left with? Still the Bulls. **That's** how unfair adding Kevin Durant was to this Warriors core. But over the past few seasons yall forgot who the Splash bros are. Yall forgot what Steph was doing at the beginning of this season. Yall **forgot** that everyone on this team was taking a backseat to KD in hopes that he'd resign. When KD was out the past two regular seasons, yall forgot how great the Warriors were looking.   This is still the same Warriors core. Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Iguodala are boutta put on game 6, mark my words. I have the utmost faith they're gonna remind all of us just how great they are."
"Jesus dude have a little faith.  Yeah losing Kevin Durant is huge, but we still have a championship-caliber core.  It certainly won’t be easy, but anyone who thinks this series is over has never seen what Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Iggy can do."
"Game 7.  5 seconds left to play.  Warriors down 2.  The lights come down at Oracle.  The crowd grows quiet in anticipation.  A single spotlight lights up the end of the tunnel.  A weirdly slender silhouette becomes visible.  It's KD.  Pushing himself along on one of those little cart thingies that people use when they fuck up a leg.  He reaches the court, steps off the cart thingum, and begins swinging it around.  Faster and faster.  He releases the cart, and it launches up...higher...higher...and breaches the roof of the arena.  Debris falls and kills a few people no one ever cared about anyway, but amazingly, the court remains clear.  The inbound pass to KD, 38.67 feet from the rim.  He's covered by the entirety of the Houston Rockets team...even the bench.  Chris Paul launches himself backwards, hoping for a charge.  There is no call.  KD jumps...intense focus radiating from his body like in waves...the release...the ball is in the air for nearly 2 seconds...the game clock reaches zero...SWISH.  Warriors win.  KD  pulls a cigarette from his shorts, snaps his fingers to make a flame, takes a long drag, and then levitates out of the hole he created in the roof of the area.  As he floats out of the building, he repeats over and over to himself ""I'm Kevin Durant.  You know who I am."""
Kevin Durant played 45 minutes a game and hurt his calf and you are just now asking if fatigue may be the biggest threat
&gt; Why was there no huge outpouring of emotion over Kevin Durant possibly just cramping up?   It’s hard to get real serious about an event like this when you don’t know what happened yet.
Wait you can trade free agents? Can’t wait for my Grizzlies to trade Kevin  Durant
Kevin? As in Kevin Durant? 🤔
Alright. I was trying to be honest and civil with this conversation. All of sudden I’m being accused of being a shitty person. When I accurately expressed what I felt in an appropriate manner. Since I’m being downvoted and treated unfairly. Then I’m going to say unfair things.  I’m really glad Kevin Durant injuries himself. He deserves it for leaving OKC. Hopefully he tears his Achilles.
"It seems like you are one of those people that need everything literally explained to them because they can't get there by themselves. Don't worry though. You are not alone judging by the downvotes  * First of all, I specifically said (between () and put BETTER in between freaking commas for crying out loud) that ONE MIGHT ARGUE. Not that it is what I think, and surely, and most importantly, not that it is a FACT * The reason ONE MIGHT ARGUE (again NOT WHAT I THINK), they are ""better"" is the offense would certainly be less iso-oriented and more freeflowing, like the good days of old that Warriors fan remember so fondly, where everybody get touches, and even G league players look like all stars hitting them big shots. It is not a coincidence that Steph and Klay, who were criticized for ""struggling"" or underperforming or whatever term you wanna use, found their groove again when KD left the game.  I,for one, I do not believe that any team can be better without, rather than with Kevin Durant. The whole point of my comment was that Golden State is less dependant on KD, as he was an added extra luxury, godlike, and almost all solving piece compared to what CP3 represented for the Rockets last year where he was settling the tone and was basically the identity of that team, despite not being their best player.  &amp;#x200B;  The only real issue that Golden State might have to face with KD out is their lack of depth, which, in IMHO, is a somewhat ""better"" issue to have, rather than have one of your two all star players, who also happens to be the heart and soul (for better or worse) of your team.  &amp;#x200B;  P.S. Stats don't really have anything to do with this conversation. It's not like we are arguing KD is or isn't the best player on the court or in the whole damn playoff"
Kevin Durant Biographer Says He Would Like To Keep His Job
"his averages are better than 75% of FMVP's tho, he just happened to play with Kevin Durant"
"In my eyes, Kevin will always be a very good individual player who needs to get carry'd, he is extremely immature and depends on the warrior allot more than a good team ""that plays toghetter"". Rather a mature &amp; stabile environment like Colin would put it lol. He is surely one of the top players of his generation individually. But abit like Boogy Cousins and Kyrie Irvin. They wont be the ones that make is possible, they make it happen... I think GSW would ofc miss his ability's, but without Curry and/or Ker there would be 0 Rings. Without Durant maybe 1."
I thought Kevin Durant was the one that got on social media under aliases?
"*Klay Thompson explodes for the Golden State Warriors in the 3rd quarter of game number 6, scoring a historic 41 points against James Harden and the Houston Rockets. Shooting 11/13 from three, Klay put on an absolute clinic in front of the stunned Toyota Center crowd, lighting fire like nobody else in history and showing the world that the splash brothers are just as deadly without Kevin Durant.*  *Final score: Houston 132 - 101 Golden State*"
"lol knew this was coming. ""To think otherwise is folly.""   ""Solely because of Finals MVP Kevin Durant"" hahahahahaha"
"Kevin ""Giantsbane"" Durant"
"hes kevin durant, yall know who I am."
"Bucks of course deserve credit, but Kyrie has accomplished nothing without LeBron. He has not earned the right  to be that cocky imo. You see Kevin Durant say ""I am Kevin Durant"", and you respect it because of what he has done the last 2 playoffs; and he then proceeded to go on a tear until last night. That is an earned track record."
Imagine being so naive that you think a basketball team could be better with out Kevin fucking Durant.
Thoughts on best player in the nba?   Personally:   1) Lebron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Kawhi Leonard  4) James harden 5) Giannis  6) Stephen Curry  7) Joel Embiid 8) Anthony Davies 9) Russell Westbrook  10) nikola Jokic
Jeez it's weird how some people actually underrate Kevin fucking Durant now.
The Warriors won a championship against LeBron James by himself with 2 all-stars down and then lost when the Cavs actually had their stars.   The last two have been solely because of Finals MVP Kevin Durant.   To think otherwise is folly.
"I really don't understand how people can be saying that. In the moment Kevin Durant came off, Warriors were 2-2 in the series, quite luckily too, up by like 2 points in game 5 at home. If that is the boring reality where Warriors steamroll everybody, the games are decided before the start so there is nothing to care about, as the narrative keeps it, then I really don't know what is ""exciting""."
WARRIORS ARE BETTER WITHOUT KEVIN DURANT.
People forgetting the Warriors were still a good team without Kevin Durant.
It seems like the Rockets defensive scheme has been built around shutting Curry down and making Kevin Durant beat them (since shutting him down wasn't an option).   Of they can contain him like the first few games of the series it's going to be tough.  That being said it's Steph Curry and he can literally take over a game and no lead is safe when he's on. This is still anyone's series
"""Kevin Durant is a sideho, not a main piece"" - Harriet Tubman"
"Honestly, that shit was pissing me off watching it live.  &gt; He's saying it felt like someone kicked him in the leg  No, Durant never said shit.  You idiots are speculating.  And it wasn't just Reggie.  Harlan was repeating that nonsense too.  I watched Kobe rupture his achilles.  I've also personally ruptured my right achilles.  Kevin Durant didn't fall over, didn't clutch his leg, didn't yell.  I guess I have the benefit of personal experience but it was blatantly obvious that Durant's injury was, thankfully, something else.  And yet the broadcasters are both sitting here comparing his hop step and limp to a devastating injury.  I dunno, shit was just pissing me off watching it live."
"Lmao thank you, this was good. I love Ingram’s character, they got his arms right. And his Kevin Durant frame."
"FWIW Wiggins also shot more because he was on a shittier team. More shots = worse fg%, worse ts%, worse eFG%, unless your name is James Harden or Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is their go to guy. Thats not a shot at anyone.  That's Kevin Durant.
"I am just gonna leave this here - The warriors will win game 6 in Houston without KD. Steph's entire career has led to this moment and the book has written itself. Struggled all series, clearly uncomfortable with the KD based offence that has taken the rhythm out of the him and also the team to a lesser extent. Kevin Durant goes down in pivotal game 5 but won't get able to go for game 6. Steph Curry, this is your moment.  Warriors win by 13 and Curry for 37."

What about GSW center Kevin Durant?
"Yet another Harden playoff choke job. There was no pressure before cuz they were expected to lose this series. Now all of a sudden Kevin Durant is out, they’re supposed to win and he disappears.  Or I’m just salty cuz I guaranteed he was about to step up and lead them to a win in my group chat"

Kevin Durant take my fucking energy
Only the Houston chokits can shoot 0-27 one game then choke after an entire quarter with Kevin Durant out lmafo choke City
It's almost like without Kevin Durant they still have three all stars.
"Kevin Durant is IMO the best player in the NBA... but the Warriors are just so much fun to watch without Durant. The ball movement, the energy, the fuck you 3s.   Hopefully Durant is ok though."
I hated kevin durant when he joined golden state (as did most of us lol) but honestly you gotta hope its not something serious and i cant help but feel sorry for him if it is his achilles.

"Yeah that's Ibaka, not Kevin fucking Durant."
Saw a tweet that perfectly described it.   “the spectrum of what just happened to Kevin Durant ranges from he's fine he'll be back out there in 5 minutes to the next decade of the NBA may have just changed shape before our eyes”
DAMN WTF I LOVE KEVIN DURANT NOW
"Jerebko is a poor man's Kevin Durant.  I'm talking extreme poverty, but the point stands nevertheless."
I cannot BELIEVE the Rockets do not have a substantial run going yet with Kevin Durant gone from this game. They should be leading by 10 points right now. The choke job is in
Dude... I don't think Jerebko is as good as Kevin Durant!
 Curry had 9 points on 4-14 FG before Kevin Durant got hurt. Curry has 11 points on 4-4 FG since.  Stepping up
All of them. He's Kevin fucking Durant.
"With Kevin “Achilles” Durant leaving the battle, it’s up to Jonas “Patroclus” Jerebko to pick up his slack vs James “Hector” Harden."
Kevin Durant having a major injury would alter the league so significantly right now
"Really hope Durant is okay. There is nothing I want more than for Houston to beat GS, but not like that. Even without him they are formidable of course, but it’s not the same. Good luck Kevin."
"KD deserved all the shit he got for signing with the Warriors but he doesn't deserve to hurt like this. He is THE best player in the game today and that's coming from a Rockets fan. Not Harden, not Giannis, not LeBron and not Kawhi but Kevin Durant. He's been playing the best basketball in his career too. You hate to see this. Hope he's ok."
This might've been the last game of prime Kevin Durant we'll ever see
Kevin Durant
Kevin “Kobe Bryant” Durant
I think there is a slight difference between you and kevin durant athletically

"I have these two streamables that show the mind games Draymond and Lebron play against each other and what high level basketball really is. The whole possession is about them and everyone else is just a pawn.  This is a play the Cavs like to run for Kevin Love: https://streamable.com/gxrbd  The first option here is for Love to reject the screen and backdoor his man sprinting to the rim for an open layup. Point guards are generally hesitant to switch onto big, and big guys are generally hesitant to switch onto to smalls, so the Cavs like to take advantage of that hesitancy with this play.  The second option is for  Love to use the screen from a point guard, get a small switched on him, and then back him down in a postup, or for Love to get the smaller guy on him and then elevate for 3 over him.  This play is very effective against most teams but not against the Warriors because of Draymond. Here it is: https://streamable.com/3mnjj  Draymond actually knows what play Lebron is running here. Bell doesn't want to switch off of Love and onto a point guard so he hugs him, so Love sprints toward the basket and gets ahead of him. But he can't get open because Draymond comes over and stands in his way.  Lebron immediately realizes Draymond has figured the play out, so he calls Tristan Thompson (Draymond's man) for a screen. Durant gets rubbed off like a fly, and Lebron knows he is getting an open jumpshot because Draymond is down at the baseline. Draymond rushes over but it's a late contest, and James has won that possession."
"Steph Curry is definitely the luckiest and this is not up for debate. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured yet LeBron still carried the Cavs to 6 games. In 2016 the Warriors had 73 wins and LeBron and his crew came back from 3-1 and beat the Warriors, then Kevin Durant made the most unforgivable decision of all time which helped the Warriors beat the Cavs badly in 2017 and 2018, and it was absolutely unfair for LeBron yet people still blame LeBron for everything. I'll admit LeBron did get lucky in game 6 against the Spurs in the 2013 Finals with Kawhi missing the free throws and Ray Allen making that game tying 3 to force OT, but other than that Steph Curry has gotten a lot more lucky, but the whole Warriors team has always been lucky."
Kevin Durant drops 51 on us 2OT when he was on the thunder  Hit the pull up 35 foot game winner nothing but net
This has been my take since 2015. Kevin Durant is why the Warriors are a dynasty.
Because one Kevin Durant joined the team.
Kevin Durant isn't playing again this year
"Honestly Steph Curry is great and he seems like a great guy, and I like Klay. But I can see why people hate them when they employ Draymond Green, who is dirty, annoying, and good to boot and Kevin Durant who is ultra sensitive on social media and ruined parity in the league"
Just another day in the life of Kevin Durant.

Kevin Durant
"First title run every team they faced had players injured. Blew a 3-1 lead in 2016 so got mocked for it. Then they added Kevin Durant and got loud when they were just too much for everyone else. They’re front runners, plain and simple"
"chris paul and lebron james colluded to manipulate the cap to force kevin durant to join the warriors. so now there is a team so stacked that they could lose to them in the playoffs and not have it hurt their legacy, all while durant has to deal with wildly unfair scrutiny"
"Yes, as a huge Warriors hater, I will say that Steph Curry is even top 5 all time, and that's tougher for me to say than anybody on here. Steph Curry is the better player and leader than Kevin Durant. It just took Curry longer to peak than Durant."

The Cavs also had to deal with a healthy Kevin Durant in the line up lol. There’s no way the Cavs get dominated the past two years playing the warriors - KD. Hell they probably would have smoked them in 2017.
This list offends me...  I love Kevin Durant.
"&gt;There's a chance Bogdanovic signs elsewhere so it would be essential to get a replacement, and I'm sure they wouldn't mind it being Kevin Durant.   &amp;#x200B;  Funny how you worded it considering Bogdanovic to Durant would be one of the biggest upgrades in NBA history, but all cool man.. it's always nice to read original content."
Kevin Durant being healthy might have something to do with this.
"The matchup between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors on ABC averaged more than 6.8 million viewers, according to the data; the audience skewed 80% male and 20% female versus last year’s 73%/27% split. Sixty-five per cent of viewers were in the adults 25-54 demo.     Those results were down from last year’s Game 1. One reason could be because the Raptors are the first Canadian team to make the NBA Finals – and are obviously not associated with a US home media market.   “Game 1 was down from an OOH average of 10.2 million viewers for the [same game in 2018](https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2018060252343/nba-basketball-finals-game-1-nets-strong-streaming-broadcast-performance.html). The lack of a second US home team coupled with the absence of LeBron James and Kevin Durant may have cost the game some viewers in out-of-home locations,” said Paul Lindstrom, head of research and analytics, Tunity Analytics. “This year’s higher male skew could also indicate that the games are attracting more of a hardcore fan base over casual viewers.”     In comparison, the Eastern Conference Finals averaged more than 2.3 million viewers over seven games on TNT and the Western Conference Finals averaged 4.1 million viewers over four games on ESPN.  &amp;#x200B;  [For comparison's sake, Super Bowl LIII drew 12 million in out-of-home viewing.](https://deadline.com/2019/02/cbs-tacks-on-12m-to-super-bowl-tv-rating-due-to-out-of-home-viewing-1202552629/)"
"This pick may not make sense because his archetype is a dying breed at the moment.  Consider that in this era of the NBA guys like Chris Bosh, Lemarcus Aldridge, KG, Jermaine O’neal and Amare were tearing it up.    My pick goes to Brandan Wright.  6’11” slender had a 7’5” wingspan, 36 inch max vertical, quick jump and a max touch at I believe 12’9”.  Truly a freak of nature relative to his size athletically.  Had a decent touch, was extremely mobile, developing skill, good passer and ball handler.  Two things happened:  -He dealt with injuries and played for Don Nelson -Kevin Durant killed Wright’s archetype in the same draft class.  4’s had to be able to play the 3 and shoot.    Wright has still provided us with insane highlights.  I would like to think that had he been drafted in 2003 he would have amounted to something more."
We are glad he's injured. Fuck Kevin Durant
"&gt; Kevin Durant isn't going to play in the finals. &gt;  &gt;   Yeah pray on it dude, he's coming for you."
Kevin Durant will not play for GS anymore

Kawhi faked an injury and backstabbed an entire city. Kevin Durant is a saint compared to Kawhi
"Top 3&gt; Top 30, it's quite simple to understand. Are you telling me you genuinely believe a single team wouldn't offer Kevin Durant the max even if he tore his achilles?"
meanwhile Kevin Durant probably not playing the series? I like these odds
"Even if we don't re-sign him, we can't do anything because we're way over the cap already. Whether he stays or not, we'll only have MLE.   And I absolutely see us or almost everyone with the money needed offering him a max even if he tears his ACL, it's Kevin Durant."
"No, Kevin Durant is a top 3 player in the league, he could amputate his foot and still get the max"
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook...because you know why and Serge Ibaka and Robin Lopez cuz also you know why
"Westbrook, Pat Beverley, Embiid, Kevin Durant"
"Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Kyrie as far as high profile players go. Draymond is a phenomenal on the mic, KD would be fucking hilarious because he's funny as shit, LBJ because he's in the old man stage of his career and doesn't give a fuck and Kyrie because he's pretentious as hell but has chemistry with KD and to an extent LBJ."
"If I’m doing a Tactical Basketball Podcast give me Rondo, LeBron, Kevin Durant and CJ McCollum to play the moderator role"
"""And your 2034 NBA Champions are the Golden State Warriors lead by Steph Curry &amp; Kevin Durant."""
"My hate for the Warriors actually didn't sky rocket until Kevin Durant joined the Warriors actually. I respected their 2015 title despite Kyrie and Love being out. The 2016 Finals was epic, one of the greatest sports moments I ever witnessed. Durant making a piss poor move after blowing a 3-1 lead with OKC is what did it for me."
I think Steph Curry is a better player than Kevin Durant based on what I've seen. I'll say this (and I'm being honest here) if Curry can win 2 more rings WITHOUT KD. I'll respectively put him ahead of LeBron as much as I don't want to. The Warriors without Steph is a disaster. The Warriors without KD are still that super team we've known them to be since 2015.
"&gt; People act like Kevin Durant is the same or better than LeBron because of his championships with the Warriors.  Idk who says he’s better(he’s not), but he’s definitely closest in the league. Regardless of his GSW rings."
Kevin Durant is better than LeBron James
"Wait a minute, how did you feel when Kevin Durant left your team?"
"Nope, I'm 23 (the end of my username automatically proves that). I've had this same username on multiple sites for a decade. I remember when Kobe and Shaq won in the early 00's, and I remember when Kobe won 2 more in 2009 and 2010. The NBA was more balanced back then and a lot more fair. The Warriors have ruined it. See I never once hated the Warriors because of Steph Curry. Curry is a GREAT player and I give him credit where credit it's due. It's because the Warriors beating the Cavs have open the doors to bandwagons, LeBron haters doing their usual thing, and Kevin Durant joining them ruined the whole league and has caused a lot of folks to come up with illogical comparisons."
This forum underrates the shit out of Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant?  Dr. J?
Toronto will go up 3-1 and then Kevin Durant ill be miraculously healed in time to be the savior of the Warriors franchise
"Did I say basically the 2015 Cavs? I know, it's such a crazy opinion to say a team losing an MVP player averaging 34/5/5 makes them worse. It's the worst Golden State team since 2014. I'm not saying this to discount the Raptors. I'm saying this to tell you the 2017 Cavs had it MUCH harder than you did, and you're honestly delusional if you disagree. This Golden State team is still amazing, but the 2017 GS team and what Raptors are facing right now is completely different. You understand this is a worse team than the one LeBron beat in 2016? But because they lost in 5 after they added Kevin fucking Durant the rest of the season and eastern playoffs meant nothing? You're talking nonsense"
They won 73 games then added Kevin Durant. It's not a hard concept
Kevin Durant begs to differ though.
-- Kevin Durant
"If Tim Thomas had been as good as I thought he was going to be, he would have been Kevin Durant."
My God to this day I wish he would’ve got of the weed. Growing up from where he’s from it was Leah’s thought Michael Beasley was better than Kevin Durant...
I guess we’ll see once Kevin Durant signs with the Hornets
"Not a chance he gets anything less than the max, regardless of what happens or where he goes. He’s Kevin Durant."
"Which markets could he ring chase? GSW, Toronto, Houston, Milwaukee, Denver, Philly none of them have capspace to sign him. Those are all the teams that could contend right away if they added Kemba.   NYC with Kevin Durant would be good I guess, but I'm still not sure what the supporting cast would look like."
He’s obviously Kevin durant. KD has multiple reddit accounts.
39/5/5 since he affirmed that he’s Kevin Durant.
"Listen, I'll end it for y'all:  Kevin Durant isn't going to play in the finals.   Steve Kerr said if it was regular season, he would be *weeks* away. Y'all think just cause it's the finals that it's magically going to heal faster? Furthermore, do you really believe Durant would potentially make his calf strain turn into something significantly worse? Right before he's about to get a massive contract and big money? No. Chance.   Durant will not play in the finals. Im a nobody and I'm sure you guys can take his with a grain of salt but this is just posturing. The warriors don't want anyone knowing he won't play and that's the right play here. But as far as I'm concerned, I would be shocked if I saw him dressed for any of the games."

"Okay he's a backup point guard on the best team because everyone wants to be in Golden State, hell KD went there, and DeMarcus Cousins, I don't really blame him he hasn't even been on a playoff contending team. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green. Get the picture? These guys won the 3 championships, even before Kevin Durant GS's big 3 won it. Shaun is a real ass dude because his leg should be absolutely fubar. And he's a decent bench player but he shouldn't of been 4th overall, he's a bust, do you guys need the definition? When you draft a high overall player and they don't fulfill expectations."
"Oden was a beast, if he wasn't injured he would have been a great Center. If Portland went with the safe bet (on the injury frontier), they would have went with KD and would have had a great nucleus of;    - PG Jarret Jack   - SG Brandon Roy   - SF Kevin Durant   - PF ____________   - C Channing Frye"
"one of Lebron James, Kevin Durant, or Anthony Davis."
"According to a person who saw the text messages, Curry told Durant in a text message that he could care less about who is the face of the franchise, who gets the most recognition or who sells the most shoes (Curry is with Under Armor, Durant with Nike). The two-time NBA MVP also told Durant that if Durant won the MVP award again he would be in the front row of the press conference clapping for him. In closing, Curry’s message to Durant was that all he truly cared about was winning championships and he’d like to do that as his teammate.  To push the Warriors’ sales pitch even further, Durant got a phone call from Hall of Famer and Warriors consultant Jerry West on Saturday.   https://www.google.ca/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/strength-in-numbers-convinced-kevin-durant-to-join-warriors/amp/"
&gt;go drop 32 on Draymond's head  [I thought KD was the one with that fetish?](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/59zadd/kevin-durant-will-respond-if-you-claim-he-likes-when-people-fart-in-his-face)
"Bro every player would be out there on two stumps to win a ring, and give the rest of their body doing it. If KD can play, he’s playing. He could lose both legs and get max offers this summer because he’s Kevin Durant."
If people would rather max dangelo than draymond or klay that’s their problem. Russell is a volume scorer and a mediocre playmaker and a team with him on a max contract will never contend for a championship short of adding Kevin durant

"It actually literally says this:  “As much as the Warriors’ series-opening loss in the NBA Finals can be attributed to the absence of Kevin Durant or the Toronto Raptors’ team length and excitement of representing a country at this stage, **Kerr knows his team’s biggest opponent is in the mirror** and the numbers tell the story.”"
Anyone remember those old WHAT IF? comics Marvel did in the 80s?  WHAT IF KEVIN DURANT WAS BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE SNAKE?
The year KD would have been drafted out of high school was the year we had the #1 pick.  Also the year they changed that rule.  Its all good though....Andrea Bargnani = Kevin Durant.
Lebron wasn't in his prime the last few years either. You can play this nonsense all day. Lebron James is a better basketball player than Kevin Durant.
"As others have noted, Kevin Durant will definitely receive multiple max offers in all scenarios.  If his foot fell completely off, the New York Knicks would still offer him the max.  So he has only the rest of his on court career to worry about.  Of course he has aspirations in the future but the opportunity that is in front of him right now?   - A 3-peat. - 3 straight finals MVP awards. - The chance to change the narrative about his entire Warriors career.  This is a rare opportunity indeed.  He knows it.  Everyone knows it.  Kevin Durant is an intense competitor. One of the greatest players of all time. This could be a historic moment. The greats find a way.  He will come back."
I love that you’re saying “I love Kevin Durant” in every thread haha
Kevin Durant is actually 11 feet tall.
"Kevin Durant is also 6'9"" /s"
6’8 bc he lines up with Lebron. But tbh I put 6’8-6’9 players in the same basket. It’s hard to decipher 1 inch without really going to google to see who exactly is 6’9. Kevin Durant is 6’11 some days &amp; 7 Ft some days according to the NBA.
Kevin durant   /s
Russell Westbrook has never made it out of the first round in his entire career with Kevin Durant not on the roster and playing. Safe to say Westbrook needs Durant the most.
"If Kevin Durant comes back from injury with the Warriors down 3-0, loses to Toronto in Game 7, and then signs with Toronto next year does he gain or lose respect?"
Pretty sure Kevin Durant has been more efficient in the finals.
Me just now: Kevin Durant won't play in the Finals

"They can definitely win this finals without Kevin Durant. They’re like a ridiculous 34-2 without Durant since he singed, saying they’re a better team without Durant is stupid, but saying they need him to win when they have that kind of success without him is just as stupid"
"he was a [dubs fan](https://www.bardown.com/polopoly_fs/1.1312083!/fileimage/httpImage/image.PNG_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/aaaaawkward.PNG) for a few minutes, but in general drake just has terrible tattoos.

Kevin durant was in talks with thee warriors and made his decision to sign before the warriors(possibly even thunder) were eliminated.
"He’s been getting shots up I thought,’I can’t find a tweet mentioning it yesterday but this tweet is from 9 minutes ago   “Kevin Durant went through some individual on-court shooting in Toronto just now. He's been doing this for several days.”"
Because he's from the bay area and a warriors fan who [un-cursed KD when KD joined the warriors](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/kevin-durant-warriors-lil-b-lifts-based-gods-curse-070416) and still kept blessing the warriors after KD joined them?
Wrong. Here's an objective top 5 players in the world list:  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curry 3. Embiid 4. Kawhi 5. Kevin Durant
The 2016-2017 Thunder were out matched talent wise and and should've lost 50+ games but somehow went 47-35. You can't expect your role players to ball out and fill the void of Kevin Durant. Especially not when they are Semaj Christon and Kyle Singler.
The only asterisk is for Kevin Durant and his bum ass titles.     Raps in 5.
"Because the other options are Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Igoudala, Shaun Livingston, and Kevin Durant? On top of that they want to expend as much energy as possible."
"Yup, KG never cried over Kevin Durant."
"if theres one person that Kevin Durant is texting his every thought, it's Stephen A Smith"
"TV is not going to change and from what I can remember it’s sort of always been this way - catering to as many people/casual fans tuning in for the playoffs and big games as possible.   We’re honestly pretty spoiled with podcasts, R/NBA, and websites producing exceptionally good content on the reg. We can interact with players on twitter and comment/create our own content in real time, all while over analyzing what Kevin Durant eats for breakfast. It’s pretty amazing! But none of these sources own the rights to live games and probably never will.   What I would love to see happen in the future is a separate stream of two commentators calling a more in depth play by play throughout the game that you could listen to while watching the game live on mute. Maybe pay a premium for more analytical coverage or something, kind of like a paywall for articles that we have now."
"Which GSW team would they have beaten? This year or the previous 2 years with Kevin Durant (MVP), Klay (2nd greatest shooter ever) and Draymond (all star)"
"It's pretty hard to replace 100 minutes of Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Kevon Looney.  Scoring won't be easy so we'll need to be excellent on defense and hopefully generate some opportunities to run.  Quinn Cook and Jonas Jerebko will have to hit 3's as well.  Steph is going to get doubled all game."
"I agree to an extent, but a Kendrick Perkins asterisk is a little different than a Kevin Durant asterisk"
"I don't buy this premise.  ""People are more sensitive because social media""?  That's nonsense.  There have always been overly sensitive people, it doesn't come from social media, it comes from massive insecurity and self doubt and a need for praise and confirmation that 'you're good enough'.    Lots of people on social media ARENT sensitive about what others thing.  Kevin Durant is thin skinned, needs affirmation, and people to love him...that's how he acts on social media, that's not social media's fault it's just a new outlet for him to demonstrate his insecurity.  Technology doesn't cause flaws, it may expose them though."
"&gt;You can't fault someone for ruining a rivalry by improving themselves.   Sure you can. Instead of running it back, the Warriors ran to Kevin Durant for help."

"If the Warriors don't get an asterisk for their 2015 Championship against a Kyrie and Kevin-less Cavs team, in which they went down 2-1, then the Raptors should not get an asterisk this year.   If the Warriors win without Durant, the nephews certainly will be out in full force, but the argument that the Warriors ever needed Durant to get through the Cavs, or whomever was always fundamentally incorrect. It took some crazy swings and an extremely impactful suspension in 2016, and yet the Warriors STILL lost by one possession.   Durant was correct to put himself in a place where he could have fun playing basketball and compete for championships every year, but if there is one thing I have truly, always detested about that signing is that Durant went on record saying that if the Warriors had won the title in 2016, there was ""no way in hell""--or something to that effect--that he would ever sign with the Warriors. Very, very silly take."
"Two close games so far. Obviously Kevin Durant is out for the Warriors which is huge but given who's playing I don't see some huge talent gap. Klay and Draymond are, I think, better players than any second option Toronto has. But after those 3 (Steph) there is a pretty steep fall off in terms of talent where as Toronto has that depth through 7-8 players. Slightly more quantity over quality.  And yea, hopefully the officiating is less of a story in Game 3."

"&gt; But if you’re the GM, could you really take that risk of Looney significantly improving in two years and replacing Draymond or opening the wallet for an almost sure thing you know you will get with Green?   This is a logical fallacy.  You don't NEED to make the decision now.  Re-sign Looney this offseason, go another year with both Looney and Green, see how it goes in Looney's age 24 year, and Green's age 30 year, and then, make a decision in the summer of 2020, and not a second before then.    That's the right decision, no one is saying the call has to be made now.  There is no urgency on this front, which is why I replied to OP that the big decisions weren't this summer; FO decisions this summer are easy.  The big decision is a year from now.    &gt;I can’t afford the warriors losing (speaking if I was the general manager) with Looney because he either sucks or is constantly injured when I could have paid Draymond.  If KD decides to stay, you CANNOT pay everyone.  Four max deals is $160 million a year for 4 players.  You have zero flexibility, if any of those guys gets hurt, your DOA for that season.  They'll also all be OVER 30 years old.  That is a bad risk, you have to make choices.    If KD decides to leave, 3 max players is $120 million a year, that's right about at the tax level.  You can sustain that, but if you spend one of those 3 max deals on the wrong player, you're sunk.  The Rockets only have 2 max deals (CP3 and Harden) and the CP3 contract looks like a payroll gash that's going to kill the rockets who have no flexibility left.  Even two max deals is hard.  If I was convinced that Curry, Thompson and Green were all going to be productive for all those years, I'd do it, but you don't know that, especially as players age.  Always pay for tomorrow, never pay for yesterday.    As Bill Walsh used to say, move on a year too early, rather than a year too late.    &gt;That’s why I think convincing DG taking a 3 year deal is in warriors best interests assuming Kevin Durant is gone.  Not going to happen.  This is what HAS to be understood.  Draymond IS NOT SIGNING a 3 year deal!!!!!! There is NO incentive for him to.    What would you do?  A 3 year deal, for $120 million with the warriors, you're a free agent again at the age of 33 (washed up, that 3 year deal is your final big contract).    OR  a 4 year, $160 million deal on the free agent market with another team?  Draymond will get maxed as a free agent, because there's more max cap slots then there are max players, some Podunk franchise will give it to him.  He's then a free agent at age 34, but with an additional year, and $40 million more in his pocketbook.  That is then his last big deal.  He'll hang around the NBA some more years, but he's not getting another max.    If you've already won your rings, and you want to cash in (and Draymond does) your best chance is to take the extra year and the extra $40 million with another team over a 3 year deal with the warriors.  As a great philosopher once said, all that extra money will matter when you can't play anymore, but championship rings won't pay your bills.    I think if the warriors give Draymond the full five year max, he stays, I think if they try to low-ball him with a 3 year deal, he walks anyway.  A 3 year deal, for a player who can easily get 4 years and $40 million more is a low-ball.    Again, if I was sure that these 3 players will continue on as they are into their 30's, I do it.  Otherwise, I have to pick and choose.  Nothing will happen this offseason though, we're good for another year in 2019-20.  Its the summer of 2020 where decisions will have to be made.    If Durant decides to stay this summer, then Draymond is gone.  I see no way around this."
"I totally get what you’re saying. But if you’re the GM, could you really take that risk of Looney significantly improving in two years and replacing Draymond or opening the wallet for an almost sure thing you know you will get with Green?  I can’t afford the warriors losing (speaking if I was the general manager) with Looney because he either sucks or is constantly injured when I could have paid Draymond. Or I get fired because warriors get beat by the nuggets in 6.    That’s why I think convincing DG taking a 3 year deal is in warriors best interests assuming Kevin Durant is gone."

The Rockets were good enough to beat these warriors.. they just didnt make the plays in crunch time when they needed to.."
And Shaun Livingston will have to play the role of Kevin Durant.
Imagine thinking “Stay True” is a good catch phrase to associate with Kevin Durant.  Shit will sell just as much as the Dwight Howard “Protection at all costs” T-Shirt line.
"Obviously the other path isn't terrible, but if Kevin Durant wants to come to your team you can't just say no.

"not that this would actually happen or would it really make up for the loss of Kevin Durant directly, but imagine that kind of package that the Warriors could receive and a sign and trade sending Kevin Durant to the nets.

"Dude, everyone poses a threat. The Clippers took them to 6, so did the Rockets, even against the Blazers they had to launch major comebacks. Again, the Nuggets were three wins behind them. I'm not going into how the Raps and Bucks were ahead of them, as the East is most certainly a bit easier, but this is basketball, not a game of who has the best players. If GSWs opponent can make more shots, they can win. 2016 Cavaliers. This is a game-by-game basis, as, again, we have seen the Clippers, Rockets (twice), Spurs, Pelicans and now Raptors win at least one game against a Warriors team with Kevin Durant. If they can win one they can win four, but of course they have to play well, that is a given in any playoff matchup."
"KD has traveled with the team to Toronto, spoken to teammates during practice and in the locker room, and keeps them updated about his injury via Facetime. He's not nephewing his way out.  [What does his coach and teammates think?](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/01/what-is-kevin-durant-doing-in-toronto-anyway/)  &gt;As Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, “Kevin also wanted to be with the guys.”  &gt;“All of a sudden he’s on the bus to shootaround or to practice,” Green said. “Once you start to get closer, you start to kind of move back into a normal schedule. You’re starting to see him and hear his voice more. You’re starting to hear him coming up with adjustments even before the game and giving his input. But that’s kind of just the natural build-up when you’re going through an injury.”  &gt;“We’re all in this together,” Curry said. “He’s exemplifying that with his presence in the locker room here. And he will again when he gets back on the floor.”"

"It boggles my mind how the same people who are saying that Kawhi won’t go to the Lakers because he doesn’t want to play second fiddle are also saying that he’s going to team up with Kevin Durant on the Clippers. KD is almost unanimously a top 2 player, is that not second fiddle too?"
"&gt; klay thompson is the best player in basketball"" point but they didnt, let me respond to that: klay thompson is not the best player in the basketball, not is he even the best player on his team, nor is he even the 2nd best player on the team.  ....Am I arguing with an idiot?  Seriously.  To anyone with half a brain cell it should be clear I was talking about Kevin Durant.    &gt; The way you sounded people couldnt take your seriously because the raptors already beat the warriors when they had a healthy klay thompson, looney and cousins so dont try to oversimplify how "" lucky "" they are.  ......................jesus.  How does beating them once mean they aren't lucky for their future games of having to play against the Warriors without those players?  Let alone without Kevin Durant.  Does the stuff you're saying make sense in your head?"
Don't do it. You'll go in with a full head of hair and you'll come out looking like Kevin Durant.
"He was healthy enough to dominate Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs in the next round....not sure I buy that excuse and if you're going to use it then it should also apply to Curry in 2016.  That is if Durant is focused defensively, which often isn't the case for him. I'd say he has the most defensive lapses of any of the Warriors starting five considering his responsibilities as a help defender. Curry right now is putting up numbers comparable to any playoff stretch with Kevin Durant. He's got 29ppg on 63 TS% without KD against by FAR the best defense he's ever played in the NBA Finals. Curry in 2015 had better efficiency on comparable volume against a better defensive team who sold out to stop him than Curry in 2018, so I would argue against the whole narrative that his best two finals were with KD.   Durant is helped by Curry because he draws two defenders away from the ball and unlocks all sorts of open finishing opportunities that just weren't available for him in OKC. But I don't see anything that KD gives to Steph that wasn't available to him in previous years. He makes his team better, but not necessarily him better."
"[No Kevin Durant media availability today would indicate he’s not practicing, which would all but rule him out of Game 3. Klay Thompson is scheduled for an afternoon press conference.](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1135979654240538624)"

"I think the disappointment from some is his “Kevin Durant I’m actually a villain, not a role model” attempt at becoming a little bit edgier and more marketable. Cause honestly I doubt people will ever say “drake is so soft!” After the finals, despite that being an old meme around these parts"
"The pullup jumpshot is a subset of all jump shots. Whereas many jumpers might come from a fadeaway or turnaround (where you are moving in the air as you shoot), or a standing position or quick catch-and-shoot (with no dribble), a pullup jumpshot generally involves the player moving up the court dribbling the ball towards the basket before setting his feet and going directly into shooting. It was not traditionally a common shot because coaches did not think it was a good decision, but Mr. Wardell Stephen Curry II happens to have a very lethal one and pullup jumpers have become more and more common in recent years as shooters around the league have become more effective with it and coaches have thus been more accepting of it.  Steph also has my vote for the greatest pullup jumpshot of all time, in what was a hotly contested overtime game against a rival team a few years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEMVGHoenXM  Also, if you see anything about a ""hesi pullup jimbo"" - don't be confused, it's a joke based on an unintentionally hilarious Kevin Durant tweet that never gets old."
Kevin Durant one had me laughing for 5mins. This was great. If you can do all the teams pretty please. I would love to see how Westbrook looks.
* Raptors have home advantage * Kevin Durant is hurt  They needed computers for this?
Lol Klay got the Kevin Durant facial hair going on
Oh the Kevin Durant Finals?  I thought we were talking about Steph
That's a shitty knock on KD. Most players don't take half court heaves to protect their percentages. They know they will be judged on that and that not many people are going to take into account those super low percentage shots.   And I think the league average on those shots is something in the single digits. Curry is also probably the most capable of hitting those shots as well.   Kevin Durant helps his teams win by putting in a ton of work to refine his game and keep his body in shape. And that's good enough to help any team win games.
Kevin Durant is on one of his burners right talking  shit on Twitter about his card.
You also lost 80 year old Karl Malone and Gary Payton not prime Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant signs 10 day contract with San Francisco Giants
KD. Mfs are infatuated with the hype of players they are probably too young to watch. It’s really about who gets first ball. Kevin Durant gets better every season not to mention he’s 7foot with a 7’6 wingspan can shoot from every area on the court. I don’t think Kobe would be able to guard this year’s Kevin Durant in single coverage so every one bringing up tony Allen can stop
"Sheesh the amount of injuries gs is going thru and went thru is like the most they ever experienced in post season Cousins with quad Andre with hamstring?  Klay with hamstring Looney with cracked collar bone Kevin durant.  Considering that warriors were seen as sacrificing a strong bench to have super star power in starting line up, 3 of those stars are going thru or been thru injury in playoffs.  The bench was supposed to be the weak point of warriors but ppl like looney and andre and cook stepped up. But now looney out and andre doesnt seem 100%. Those are their two main bench players and 3 of their starters not 100%  Honestly no team will ever get a chance like this to beat a dynasty team. Raptors have to converge on game 3 or it's probably over in my opinion.   Poor steph. He gona get even more attention from raptors."
Arya Stark kills Kevin Durant with a sneak attack
For example maybe in the future (even if unlikely) people could think Kevin Durant joined the Warriors and in his first season with the team they won 73 games. Lebron James then came back and won against this team.
"it was one of the dumbest shots i've ever seen. nobody was within 10 feet of him. Iggy was 1-14 in his last his last 14 3 point attempts. go watch the shot again and you'll see he had plenty of time to drive to the hoop to get a better shot. The only person in a position to contest him was Marc Gasol, who would have had to leave DeMarcus Cousins open who is a great offensive player.  if Iggy bricks that shot the Raptors are most likely getting the ball back with 5+ seconds left.  even if that was Kevin Durant i'd say that was a dumb shot. the only people in the NBA who that was a good shot for was Steph and Klay."
"&gt; There haven't been further signs of strife since. However, according to members of the Warriors, Stephen Curry played a key part in stabilizing the team following the incident. Curry wasn't at that game because he stayed in Oakland, California, to rehab a groin injury. In the Facebook documentary ""Stephen vs. the Game,"" directed by Gotham Chopra, who also made Tom Brady's ""Tom vs. Time,""    &gt;   &gt;Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Curry was ""integral"" in helping the team. ""When we returned to the Bay, he was an integral part of trying to repair our spiritual injury,"" Kerr said. ""Every good team has to have kind of coalition builders, guys who can build bridges and bring people together, who have the respect of everybody. And that's what Steph represents for us,"" he added. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said in the documentary that Curry is great at knowing what to focus on and what to ignore.    &gt;   &gt;Mark Medina of The Mercury News reported in March that when the team got back to Oakland, Curry went to Green's house to meet with him privately. Medina also reported that Curry met with Durant privately. On November 15, just days after the verbal altercation, Curry sat between Green and Durant on the bench and often shared laughs with both. Green told Medina that Curry played ""an important role"" in settling down the situation, saying, ""He was tapped into the situation from the beginning."" Klay Thompson told Medina that Curry is a ""great voice of reason during times of turbulence."" It all traces back to Curry's personality.   &gt;   &gt; **Curry isn't always considered a vocal leader, but he knows when to speak up. Perhaps more importantly, he's light-hearted, funny, and keeps things loose. Green said in the documentary: ""This whole entire organization has taken on Steph's joyful basketball, his demeanor and presence, just the carefree way he goes about things.""**  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-saved-warriors-kevin-durant-draymond-green-fight-2019-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-curry-saved-warriors-kevin-durant-draymond-green-fight-2019-5)  Draymond isnt the leader just cause he says shit. The whole team rallies behind Steph - time and time again they get sick of Draymond's shit when they're not winning."
My point is Kevin Durant could’ve improved his playoff efficiency playing on any team that doesn’t start Robertson.....you make it seem like curry is the only capable player of improving KD’s efficiency.
"&gt;  Zaza undercutting him was pre-meditated.  This is always fucking hilarious to me.  No, it wasn't. It was reckless and careless and it should have been a flagrant, but it wasn't premeditated and it's fucking bizarre to think that Zaza Pachulia would be *capable* of doing that intentionally. Dude is not that co-ordinated.  If Pachulia were capable of that kind of control of his actions, he wouldn't have injured so many Warriors while he was on the team.   Because seriously, he is held responsible for injuring Kawhi Leonard, despite the fact that Leonard sprained his ankle against the Rockets and had already aggravated it **twice** in the Warriors game before Pachulia was in any way involved. I don't know of anyone blaming him for injuring any other opponents.  He injured *multiple* Warriors by being a bizarrely unco-ordinated dumbass for a professional athlete, including quite significantly damaging Kevin Durant."
"Steph is not held to the same standards as LeBron James and Kevin Durant or even James Harden. A bad Steph game is whatever, a bad lebron game or a bad James Harden game is groundbreaking. And I say this as someone that HAAAAAATES James Harden and LeBron James on the court"
Kevin Durant isn't offensively better than Lebron.
"Kevin Durant w/ 2 all stars have a net rating of a 40 win team. Curry w/ bench has a net rating of an absurd 70 win team when he's on court. It's why Curry has consistently led the league in net rating the last 5 seasons. Durant's playoff efficiency before Golden State wasn't even above 57%, much of the rise is due to Curry. In 2019 post season alone, Durant shoots 10% worse from 3s and paint when Curry is off the floor."
Yes I watched it. Your point? Curry isn’t the best offensive player of the last 20 years at all. Nothing backs that up. It’s easily Kevin Durant followed probably by Kobe or LeBron.
He’s not even better offensively than LeBron James or Kevin Durant. They both average more points on higher efficiency and LeBron is on a different planet in terms of passing or vision.
"Bro, kevin durant doesn't even want the warriors to win"
Kevin Durant :( really wanted him to bring a championship to okc
"Yeah, it's actually pretty funny watching defenses lose track of freaking Kevin Durant."
Curry is the type of guy who throw up 70 foot heaves before the buzzer because he doesn't care about his stats and only does what is best for his team. Kevin Durant is the complete opposite.
"Oh, the championship where the warriors added Kevin Durant? Huh. Best team in history adds one of the best players in the NBA and they won against sorry ass kevin love. Lebron still killed in that series lol."
Dumb fucking okc fan doesn’t even remember Kevin Durant left for golden state
When you see Kevin Durant is active for Game 3.
&gt; I'm flattered.  KD's responses in these types of situations make a lot more sense.   &gt; What else is he supposed to do?  &gt; I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am.
"I follow tennis, but I'm really an NBA fan. I wouldn't say it's ""lying"" for two reasons.  1) The standard practice is to use ""in-shoe"" measurements, rather than bare feet height which is what is normal in every other walk of life. Even still admittedly they do add a little more in some cases, but at least it's a sensible idea and pretty standardized in the basketball world  2) Players don't really have control over it. I play semi-professional basketball and I'm really 6'4.75"" barefoot. On our roster I'm listed as 6'7"". They never asked me (I would like to be listed as 6'5""). Oftentimes it's out of our control. Kevin Durant notably tries to be listed as shorter than the standard practice of ""in-shoe"" measurements would dictate. That's why he usually corrects people saying he's 7'2"" or 7'1"""

"It's hard to put this sentiment in a reddit comment so bear with me.   A 3-1 comeback by any team is impressive. A 3-1 comeback by any team in the finals is even more impressive. A 3-1 comeback when you don't even have home court for 2/3 games is even more impressive. So I want it to be clear that I am not trying to downplay the impressive feat that the 3-1 comeback holds.   That being said, in my opinion, Kevin Durant coming back and executing a 3-1 comeback is still not on par with Lebron and co. executing a 3-1 comeback against the 73-9 Warriors.   The reason is quite simple: everyone thought the series was over after Lebron went down 3-1. Not many people were able to confidently say ""oh yeah Lebron can come back."" We all saw the writing on the wall, and it didn't even matter that Draymond was out for game 5. The Warriors would still close in 6 at worst.  But with KD, we're all counting the Warriors out, but everyone is openly saying ""if KD comes back, then things might change."" The expectation suddenly still becomes that the Warriors steal a game or two at the least and the whole series at the most."
"How are you getting upvoted for just listing the top 5 players without any thought of team building.  Your idea of having 'whoever is on steph score an automatic 2 points', is flawed. First of all, people average like 1.82 points on dunk attempts in 2018 according to this article [https://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/steph-curry-taking-deep-3s-this-year-has-been-more-efficient-than-players-dunking](https://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/steph-curry-taking-deep-3s-this-year-has-been-more-efficient-than-players-dunking).   You're basically saying whoever is on steph curry will score MORE ppp than an automatic dunk which is clearly wishful thinking. This is even more obvious when you factor in off ball switching to hide curry, help defence/rotations and also the complete lack of spacing on your team which would allow this help defence to come so much easier.   Furthermore, you have a grand total of 0 people who will stand behind the 3 point line (Lebron James is by far the best 3 point shooter on that team) which means all your play making advantages are gone. OP's team will simply play a zone and pack the paint and your offence will consist entirely of either midrange jump shots (the least efficient shot in the nba) or some combination of lebron/jordan/magic taking 3 pointers.  Meanwhile on the other end, OP's lineup will have 4 ELITE spacers (2 of which are steph curry and klay thompson and the other 2 are mid range gods) and shaq camping in the paint.   &amp;#x200B;  Your team will get ripped apart on defence due to the lack of good guard defenders. You seem to think basketball is some 1 on 1 game where Kevin Durant will just iso Michael Jordan 100 times and that Jordan would win because he would 'lock him down'. But none of this will happen. In reality, Curry and Klay will use up entire shot clocks running around a million screens. Jordan is the only one that has any chance at keeping up with this marathon and even then, his stamina doesn't match the 2 warrior guards. Bigger players like Lebron don't have the agility, speed or stamina to keep up with smaller players off-ball for extended periods of time. After one quarter when your team is gassed, it'll become a slaughter.  &amp;#x200B;  I think a start would be to replace magic with a better off-ball guard defender/spacer like CP3 (idk just off the top of my head) who can somewhat try to keep up with warrior guards off-ball."

"The title is probably correct. Nobody feels for him because they hated his decision in the first place, so, at the very least, that's coherent.   In a situation like this, the one at lost is basketball itself, because despite the choices he made, Kevin Durant is one of the greatest basketball players of all time without a doubt and every day he doesn't get to play, for whatever reason, is a waste (basketball-wise of course)"

"It's possible though, especially Hakeem and someone with lesser accolades like Big O. His best argument is being the GOAT shooter and changing the game. That has cache. There are a bunch of guys that are around the 8 to 12 spot and if you manage to squeak into that tier, you've entered into the argument.     However, I'd say he finishes around the 13-17 area, the tier right outside the consensus Top 12 (in no order, Jordan, LeBron, Magic, Bird, Wilt, Kareem, Russell, Shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Hakeem, and Big O). He'll be in the tier with guys like Jerry West, Moses Malone, Dr. J, Kevin Durant (once he's done),etc."

"""I am Kevin Durant""- DevinKurantTrey5"
"I think it would probably be a good idea for the Warriors to explore a Draymond + draft picks (if those are even needed) for Blake Griffin or Kevin Love deal, if either of those teams want to get off money. Griffin is obviously preferable, but Love could be really good in the Warriors offense.  His defense obviously isn't super worthwhile against top level talent. He hasn't done shit to stop Kawhi or Siakam, and the Raptors have 115 offensive rating. Warriors also had the 13th ranked defensive rating in the regular season, 11th last year.  If there defense is going to be average in the regular season, and then bad relative to the other elite teams, then they might as well just go all in on the offense and build around the special talent of Steph, Klay, and then Durant if he decides to come back.  I'm not actually convinced that Draymond is worth anything on offense. He kills their spacing, and I'm not sure his passing is actually that good. I think he's been opportunistic in taking full advantage of Steph's gravity, and I wouldn't be surprised if Steve Kerr could coach up another player to fulfill this role.  Blake Griffin in particular would be a good target if Detroit decides they want off the contract. He's shown a great passing acumen, so he could fill Draymond's role, while also being a scoring threat.  Draymond + Iguoadala + 28th pick, +2020 pick, +2022 pick in a draft night trade doesn't seem like too bad of an idea. Detroit could then flip Draymond for some more assets in their spare time too."
Kevin Durant is suffering from max contract last mega deal of his careertivis?!  Oh yeah!
I'd point out that the Warriors have tried to get wings but good wings are the most in demand type of player in the NBA. Playing on the Warriors they not only have to take a paycut but know that they'll be playing behind Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson (possibly also Andre Iguodala).  If you're a good wing you have a lot of high paying options where you will be one of the main contributors. If you're an up and coming wing you want to play somewhere you will get a lot of minutes. If you're an old veteran wing.. well you're not better than Iguodala.  Also the Warriors lost McCaw essentially at the end of summer in one of the weirder RFA episodes I can remember. They were probably considering him to eventually come around because it would net him the most money. With McCaw on the roster plus McKinnie being a good find in the summer camp their wing depth is better and they just give up Bogut.

Kevin Durant died of his injuries that night he hurt his calf. Who we see now is an imposter hired by Kerr to try and play mind games with the Raptors.   #provemewrong
Kevin Durant
Kevin “Kawhi Leonard” Durant
"Yeah hes been maligned from the top all the way to the bottom, because they cant handle the slim reaper kevin durant, the cream of the crop, nobody does it better"
https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/06/nba-finals-warriors-raptors-game-3-kevin-durant-high-fives-teammates-after-loss  Those are not skinny jeans. Who rolls up skinny jeans like sweat pants lol.
"Kevin Durant, proving he’s more important than Curry since 2016?!  Oh yeah!"
"Next report: despite video evidence suggesting the contrary, Kevin Durant is actually dead, retroactive to June 2nd. He's questionable for game five, league source tells ESPN."
"Kevin ""Kawhi Leonard"" Durant"
"Hi, I'm a doctor. Kevin Durant is dead."
"You've essentially said Kevin Durant doesn't care about winning as much as collecting a paycheck so he's not going to play if he can because he doesn't want to worsen his injury.  I'm saying that if there is any chance he can play then he will because he does care about winning.  It's not that hard to follow that, is it?"
"Kevin Durant is the best player in the world currently, this sub's goldfish memory won't change that."
My man ain’t playing.  I love Kevin Durant.
i wish kevin durant was healthy ;)
“Has Kevin Durant ruined being gay?”
&gt;Having him taking the wide open threes instead of Iggy or Draymond  yes because the raptors will defend kevin durant the same way they defend andre iguodala
"Kevin ""I want[ed] to play for the Raptors"" Durant"
"KD was heard screaming at his teammates ""you fucking need me"" other sources have said KD was constantly reminding teammates ""I'm Kevin durant"""
"Honestly, the reporter should lose a good deal of credibility for that statement.  Kevin Durant was obviously slithering. Saying he was ""walking"" is a patent lie."
And 60% of Kevin Durant can shoot right over almost everyone in the leagues head and make a bucket.
"You're right. It would prove that they need their starting SF, which is Kevin Durant, to win the chip, not that they need a player that's as good as KD (But is not KD) to win the chip."
Kevin Durant is long
Kevin Durant is tall
because he's Kevin Durant and the Warriors are the luckiest team ever other than in 2016. I bet Kawhi has a season-ending injury on Monday now.
"I mean if we're going down this road, can't we say the exact same thing for Kevin Durant?"
Lmao. You’re not for real right? A.) Kevin Durant can and would get treatment whenever he wanted. B.) you think a billion dollar organization like the Warriors only provides treatment DURING ACTIVE PLAYOFF GAMES?   Bruh.
"just like how does one team have steph curry, klay thompson and kevin durant lol"
"Playing defense on iggy, Livingston, and green IS WAY different than playing defense on Kevin Durant."
There'd be a Kevin Durant cam and everyone on the internet would be saying 'HE GONE' every time he's not cracking a smile
His name is Kevin Durant though.
"bruh we’re not talking about the course of the series, he had a great showing   when it mattered MOST, he and the rockets were throwing the ball around the gym and inexplicably lost at home with kevin durant.   it’s not that hard to grasp, rewatch game 6 and watch harden completely disappear in crucial moments."
Not know? It’s obvious. Kevin Durant is NOT healthy. If he was 90% recovered he would be playing right now.   Explain to me why Durant is 90% recovered and not playing?
"Durant got cleared to practice, will likely play tomorrow. Way to go, you brought Kevin Durant back from the dead."
"Right? I think even rusty and injuried he changes the Raptors strategy. Unless he is really bad and they ignore him, but he is fucking Kevin Durant!"
It's Kevin fucking Durant
Warriors bout to smack the raps in the name of Kevin Durant lol
"""Look at me, I'm Kevin Durant now"""
"It's Kevin Durant bro you saw how he lit them up even while wobbling bro, he's returning to form for sure he shoots with his hands not with his Achilles"
Warriors' Durant or Kevin Durant?
There’s no consensus best player but I’ve felt Kevin Durant has been the best player in the world for 2 years now.
Lol yeah why the fuck would there be a 6 million player option for Kevin fucking Durant lol

Now, given the ice wrap Durant had on last night and the early status update to out, it’s starting to look more like KD might not return to this series at all. The Achilles truthers are out there too.  It just blows my mind that on Sunday June 2nd the report from the Warriors was ""there is no chance that KD can play, 0%"" and then a week later he is cleared and ok to play in the finals without chance of a major injury?"
&gt;Kevin ~~Durant~~ DeGrant
"Kevin Durant was not regressing.   You did all this research and somehow you still couldn’t figure that out? That’s sad.    Numbers don’t tell the full story. The Warriors are on cruise control during the regular season. Going to five straight finals is a lot of extra basketball on the year. These guys don’t turn on that gear until it’s truly game time.   Look at Kevin Durant’s postseason numbers and tell us he’s regressing. Come on, this shit is stupid."

To me this is a bad argument to make.  This is Kevin Durant - as much as a championship is the most coveted thing in team sports - it shouldnt be above a player's health.  So if this was game 3 instead of game 5 KD should have rested?  Or if the Warriors were up 3-1 KD wouldn't have played?  To me that is terrible because you are letting external factors influence your decision heavily and end up making a decision based more on emotion than facts.
Kevin Durant
"I feel like you missed my point. My argument was that Golden State had a reason to play him, not that Kevin Durant should demand to play."
I’d be shocked if he opts in...  This is Kevin Durant we’re talking about here.  People will still line up to sign him even with the injury.
"[SB Nation wrote a really good article](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future) about Achilles tears after Boogie tore his, and actually updated it a few days ago. Unfortunately, it’s not a good prognosis for KD. Here’s hoping, but if history proves correct, it’s a very bad sign"
"Kevin ""Sprewell"" Durant"
"Looking at the history of these injuries, it doesn't seem like something that far off. If anything, could be longer...  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future"
https://thebiglead.com/2019/06/11/kevin-durant-has-a-31-5-million-player-option-will-warriors-offer-him-supermax-contract/  read that...he is eligible to receive a supermax per the old requirements...i guess im wrong with the new requirements created after kd left “known as the kd” rule but regardless youre still a bitch
"Exactly, this entire shit storm is entirely based on people thinking a bad outcome must mean there was a bad decision. Sometimes bad things just happen. I guess the Celtics should never have signed Gordon Hayward since he broke his foot in game 1 with them.  Durant was cleared by the warriors and by his own doctors and he wanted to play. Maybe the doctors got their evaluation wrong. People make mistakes. Or maybe they were right and the chance of the Achilles tear was like 0.000001%. It can still happen. Cleveland got the number 1 pick 3 times in 4 years so it's not like we're not used to low % things happening. And with a sample size of 1 Kevin Durant and no time machines, there's literally no way to know what the real risk was"
"With every piece of information I have heard I have not changed my opinion. Kevin Durant was out for over a month, reportedly couldn't practice maybe until 2 days before the game. But now let's rush this to get him in the game because our backs are against the wall. If you don't think this is at least an acceleration of the player to a past some suitable rehab I don't think ever cared all too much about your players. Of course the Warriors are going to double down and say they didn't make a mistake. If they admitted to a mistake they'd be savaged. This wouldn't be a matter of oh we apologize. A franchise desperate to stay alive in the Finals left it up to a player who wasn't fully fit absolutely knowing he was desperate to go. Shameful. Get people to downvote me all you want. It's horseshit."
"Why doesn’t Kevin Durant, the tallest snake in the NBA, not just eat someone else’s achilles?"
Think it's safe to say that he was never gonna be as good as Kevin Durant.

"Everyone's talking about if and where Anthony Davis is being traded to.  Everyone is talking about where Kemba is going.  Everyone is talking about Kevin Durant, his injury, and where he's going of if he's planning on staying with the GSW.  But there's one guy no one's giving attention to.  Where's Carmelo Anthony?"
"We are missing a lot here to be sure, namely the exact location of the original calf injury. The Achilles is contiguous with the calf muscles, so ""calf injury"" is actually pretty ambiguous as to the level of involvement, if any, of the tendon. Prior injury would of course lead you to be wary of further injury.   On the flip side, an injured calf would put *less* stress on the tendon, which would make an acute rupture, rather than a tendonitis or even a microtear pretty surprising, if you were only looking at the stress the calf generated itself by just contraction. But Kevin Durant is an absolutely massive human being. If his calf wasn't 100%, which it wasn't, the muscle can't handle the sheer stress of landing. That force is passed onto the bone and the tendon. And there ya go. Pop. But I'm just a shit poster, and worse than that, a grunt student. But I just don't know how a group of the best in the biz MSK MDs wouldn't have tabled that as a concern. Which just makes you think that management either misinterpreted the information or were persuaded by other things."
Kevin Durant saves the NBA!
&gt;What good does that do other than take a roster spot?  At some point he stops being injured and plays. That's good because Kevin Durant is good at basketball.
Would Kevin Durant be as effective as he is when he is the leader of the team like Melo and not surrounded by other stars?
For anybody that isn’t named Kevin Durant.

"&gt;These young cats don't realize that historically a player's prime starts around age 27 and goes until around age 32.

"Kevin Durant himself is one of those people too then. It's horribly disingenuous to paint the warriors as some evil organization who didn't care about KD's health. But fact is these type of calculated risks are taken all the time in pro sports, particularly when there's a title on the line. We just don't care unless a catastrophic injury occurs"

"In no particular order... Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Patrick Ewing, Walt Bellamy, Bernard King, Earl Monroe, Dave DeBusschere, that first year from Amare, and yes, even Melo. The Knicks all-time greats deserve some respect.  Talent-wise, I do think Kevin Durant is a cut above them all. However, New York got multiple championships and stretches of greatness because of the aforementioned players."
but have you considered Kevin Durant?
Those are Melo’s best year compared to 80 percent of Kevin’s stats this year   It is literally a representation of Kevin Durant operating at 80 percent of his statistical average   Melo’s stats are significantly better than 80 percent of KD’s  You aren’t just wrong but you’re embarrassingly wrong
"I'm sure Kevin Durant, arguably the best basketball player in the world, would agree to sit when he's playing well and feeling good in the NBA Finals.   KD is the only one who can tell he his body is feeling.  I don't think anybody is to blame for an extremely unfortunate injury. Team doctors and KD's external doctors both said he was cleared to play. Kerr wanted KD to play and KD wanted to play. It's just an unfortunate injury that none of the medical professionals involved have said was at a significantly increased chance of happening."
[yeah](https://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/steve-kerr-told-kevin-durant-could-only-tweak-injury/499615)  Truly idiotic thing to say by Kerr. Makes me not trust anything he has to say on the situation if he's really either that misinformed or dishonest
that's true but what squad on earth gets to have Kevin Durant on the court - arguably the best player in the world - and now he won't be there for them next year.
"Wtf are u talking about. Here is the article from 2016 when he signed with the warriors: https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/kevin-durant-signing-20160707  The opt out and re-sign in 2017 was just a procedural move. If my memory serves me right, he was always going to re-up with the warriors. He didn't even take any meetings with other teams in 2017. For all intents and purposes, 2016 was the only year any other team could've gotten him."
Not it’s actually not. Kevin Durant is one of the best players of all time. He’s a better scorer than melo and a better defender by a good amount. 80 percent KD is better than Melo hands down
"&gt;I know Bob Myers, I know Joe Lacob, I know Steve Kerr, and more importantly, I know how highly intelligent Kevin Durant is.  Stephen A shouldn't be talking with the people that have the incentive to downplay their responsibility in this and instead talk with Dr's and physical therapists about a normal recovery process and what needs to happen before the med team allows a player back on the court. If normal procedure wasn't followed then of course they should take blame for what happened. And if the med team says there's no risk of an achilles injury but one happens 15 minutes into the game then that medical team abdicated their duty to protect the player's health and there should be consequences.  Look at what happened with Isaiah Thomas. Hyper competitive athletes are going to want to play when it matters most. Hyper competitive front offices want to win too but have a duty to put the player's long term health first so there's a clear conflict of interest."
"&gt;  when they have no proven track record.   I mean Scott Perry was the assistant GM when Seattle drafted Kevin Durant, been the GM and drafted guys like Oladipo, Aaron Gordon and Dearon Fox.   He's not amazing, he has his misses but he's also hit on players too."

"First, you have no knowledge of what my background and training are. Second, I don't need to inform you of my background and training because there have been several experts that have made statements in agreement with what I have said.  1) Dr. Kenneth Jung, a foot and ankle surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles:  “If you’re coming off a calf injury, especially if it was only a month or so ago, you’re at a higher risk of either aggravating it or suffering an Achilles injury,” said Jung, who consults for the Los Angeles Lakers. “That risk is definitely higher if he’s still having pain there or soreness. [Source](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Kevin-Durant-injury-Experts-analyze-how-he-was-13970061.php?psid=9ET08)  2) Physicians said Durant probably was susceptible to another injury because the leg tends to overload other muscles when recovering from a calf-related issue. Dr. Nirav Pandya, an associate professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC San Francisco, said when there is a weakness in a calf muscle, patients often add pressure to the Achilles tendon to generate force.  “It is not surprising there is going to be an injury on that side,” he added. [Source}(https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/11/was-kd-sent-back-onto-the-court-too-soon-medical-experts-say-no/)  3) Twin Cities Orthopedics’ Dr. Jeffrey Seybold, who specializes in foot and ankle reconstruction trauma said:  ""While a preexisting calf injury or muscle strain does not necessarily imply the Achilles is unhealthy or injured, the injured muscle may lose some elasticity as it is healing. This in turn places more strain, or stretch, on the Achilles with push-off activities. As with any tendon, once the Achilles has been placed through enough stretch beyond its normal length, partial or complete tearing will occur.""

The Warriors medical staff said he was healthy enough to play with no risk of an ACL injury. A personal doctor/consultant that KD and his agent went to also confirmed this. It was just as much of a preventable injury as Oladipo’s or Hayward’s; sure, if he hadn’t played he wouldn’t have been injured, but that injury risk just wasn’t a factor in him getting back onto the court. You’re being a fucking embarrassment right now pretending you know what’s best. Just stop being fucking obnoxious and let KD rest and his injury start to recover, please."

He ended up putting a hook plate in mine, it’s the pinky toe, and it’s kind of weird tbh. Kind of bulges out of my foot but I can run and jump and stuff."

"What? Teams are giving Kevin freaking Durant max money no matter what. Durant wanted to play, they felt he could play, the same organization held Klay out in Game 3 and he’s looked PRETTY healthy. I hate this post. Dumb narrative"
Deserves to be sued.  Kevin Durant vs. His leg
Well... we're about to see what happens when you subtract Kevin Durant.
That must be why you see a guy in the background waving bye to Kevin Durant. And Jurassic Park chanting Fuck KD.
"Depends on how relevant. R.J Barrett and a Kemba Walker/Irving type aren’t going to be enough to crack the top 4-5 in the East. To get Laker popularity, they need at least an Anthony Davis if not a Kevin Durant. Long story short, New York is a basketball town but they need to have the possibility of making some real noise in the playoffs to get people on board."
So he can lock in a long term contract in case his recovery goes poorly. Teams are going to be willing to gamble on him when the upside is Kevin Durant.
Well there’s this guy named Kevin Durant
"&gt; The heal lifts according to her take some stress off that tendon since it's not stretching quite as far as normal.  Yep, since I have a similar ailment I've read up that podiatrists recommend more heel lift to ease achilles tendonitis issues.   &gt;But you think more lift in the heel area causes more issues not less?  I definitely do not think that (up to a point). But one has to be careful with confusing greater heel lift (also called heel-to-toe drop or offset) with greater heel cushioning or cushioning instability. The reason is simple: heel-to-toe drop is determined by both the heel *and* forefoot stack-height, which is to say their difference. Thus it's possible to have a lot of cushioning without a lot of heel lift because the forefoot may be elevated by cushioning as well. Furthermore, it's even possible to have good cushioning and impact protection with a fairly minimal stack-height - because one has to take into account the compressibility of the actual cushioning material(s).  Historically, the standard heel-to-toe drop for basketball shoes is roughly 10mm (many basketball shoes today will still be around 9-11mm). But roughly coinciding with the rise of the minimalist running trend, Nike began decreasing the amount of drop in many of their basketball shoes to within the sub 7mm range - note that &lt;6mm is regarded as a natural non-posture affecting lift. How Nike does this is mainly by increasing forefoot stack-height. According to my database compiled from [freely available deconstructions](""fastpass.cn""), the average forefoot stack height of a sampling of their releases over the past couple of years is 18.3mm in the forefoot and 24.8mm in the heel with an avg drop of 6.5mm (for US size 9). You can compare that with the constructions of their more ""old-school shoes"": Zoom GP Retro (14.5mm fore, 24.0mm heel, 9.5mm drop), Zoom Generation I (Lebron's rookie shoe - 17.1mm fore, 27.7mm heel, 10.6mm drop), Nike Air More Uptempo (21.4 fore, 32.0 heel, 10.5mm drop), Kobe I (~10mm drop, the Protro version is 13.5 fore, 22.9 heel, 9.3mm drop). In contrast to Nike, other brands have remained stubbornly conservative. For instance, the average drop of a sampling of Adidas' recent releases is 10.4mm and a sampling of Anta's Klay Thompson shoes averages out at a 8.6mm drop.    Circling back to the issue of Achilles tendons and Kevin Durant in particular, KD's most recent shoe - the KD 12 - is a curiosity because it has a lot of cushioning but lacks a significant heel stack-height and actually has a minimalistic heel-to-toe drop. Compare the KD 12 with the Adidas Harden Vol. 1-3 (all measurements are for a US size 9):  Shoe model | Forefoot stack-height (mm) | Heel stack-height (mm) | Heel-to-toe drop (mm) :--|:--|:--|:-- Nike	KD12 | 17.50 | 22.54 | 5.04 Nike	KD11 | 18.64 | 26.26 | 7.62 Adidas Harden Vol. 3 | 14.83 | 24.72 | 9.89 Adidas Harden Vol. 2	| 15.22 | 26.34 | 11.12 Adidas Harden Vol. 1	| 13.30 | 24.69 | 11.39  The KDs have a lower heel-to-toe drop compared to the Hardens primarily because the KDs are higher in the forefoot (especially the KD11). The KD12 has an especially low drop as a result of the low sub-23mm heel stack-height. Yet in spite of being quite low to the ground, the KD12s are literally packed in the heel with Nike's cushioning ""tech"".  And here of course lies the problem: a minimal heel-to-toe drop *combined* with significant heel compressibility should aggravate any existing achilles tendon issue. On a shoe like the Hardens with a ~10mm drop, compressing down the heel should never extend the heel and achilles beneath the zero position (i.e. natural barefoot parallel to the ground position) and in fact even on compression the initial high heel lift should still provide a sufficient buffer to support and not over-stretch the achilles. But on a shoe like the KD12, pushing down the heel and compressing the cushion may over-stretch the tendon because the forefoot position is relatively high and the buffer is too small to begin with.   As for stability, intuitively the Hardens should be worse than the KD12 given their higher heel stack-height as well as the softness/compressibility of the Boost midsole material. However, here we have to consider the make-up of the heel. The Harden's Boost material is a more or less uniform slab of polyurethane, whereas the KD12 heel midsole area is a sandwiched stack of 3 different components: Zoom+EVA+Zoom. I don't have any evidence to determine which setup is more inherently stable, but from the study I cited in my previous post we can infer tentatively that a simple foam is better and embedding ""air cells"" is worse.   Hope your achilles tendon issue goes away forever!"
Kevin Durant and Kyrie teaming up.
What if they think they're getting Durant? Even after his injuries I think you sell aim for a championship team of Kevin Durant is going to sign with you
reread what i said. the warriors won the only game kevin durant played in.
[If he's KD then why would he ask this?](https://twitter.com/DeppRafferty/status/1131635868492390401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131635868492390401&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mercurynews.com%2F2019%2F05%2F25%2Fwarriors-mailbag-will-kevin-durant-play-in-the-nba-finals%2F)
That's an entirely separate conversation. They lost Kevin Durant.
Gary Payton  Ray Allen  Detlef Schrempf  Kevin Durant  Shawn Kemp
"I became a Nets fan because of Vince Carter mostly. Check out his highlights from the Nets on YouTube if you have free time. Jason kidd, Kenyon Martin, Kerry Kittles, and Richard Jefferson also helped make them my team. The Nets recently signed Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and DeAndre Jordan and are promising for the future. They also have a young core of guys like Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Nicholas Claxton (rookie). Sean Marks is one of the top GM's in the league, and Kenny Atkinson is a great head coach. Also, Barclays center is beautiful and the training facility is arguably one of the best in the league. The nets have yet to win a championship, although they played in 2 finals in the early 2000's. Come join us over at r/GoNets, we can always use new fans!"
See: everyone on this sub and Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"He's right but Shaq is the same guy who shat on players (both while he was a player and as an analyst) for not winning championships. Kevin Durant said on Simmons' podcast once that Shaq is the kind of guy that feels validated in life for having won rings, and he looks down on people who haven't. Maybe this is different because he likes Ewing, but let's not pretend he's generally sympathetic to guys who don't win."
"You are extending Finals narratives over the course of entire seasons. Dirk was better for six games. Kawhi was not the best player this year, and Lebron carrying his team in 2017 - 2018 puts him over Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant.   Interestingly, the one time this decade I remember people questioning his status as #1 (before joining the Lakers this year) was when Curry was fresh off a title and 24-0 to start 2015. Funny how things change."
"One of the main reasons is that it allows an over the cap team to sign a player they otherwise couldn't. For example, the Warriors couldn't sign D'Angelo Russell because they were over the cap, but could sign Kevin Durant and trade his salary for Russell's. That's a rare exception though because it's a double sign and trade, most teams trade players already under contract"
"&gt;he avg’d a lot of points because he was surrounded with he most loaded roster of all time  You act like he suddenly became an all-time great scorer on Golden State lol. He averaged 32 PPG with true-shooting of 63.5% in 2014 on OKC.  His career PPG in the postseason is the 2nd highest of all-time behind only Michael Jordan.  Also, if the Warriors were so good without Kevin Durant, what happened in the Finals? Bit weird that they lost, no? The most loaded roster of all-time?"
Kevin Durant + DeAndre Jordan = Sum 41
"such horrible logic that it actually hurts my head  against the clippers, kevin durant averaged 35 ppg. he was carrying the warriors. steph, meanwhile, was pretty meh. it was a carry-job by KD while the rest of the warriors were clearly out of it and not putting forward as much effort because ... it's the clippers.  kd continued to carry the warriors vs the rockets until he got injured and then steph stepped up. simple"
I quit reading when you compared Kevin Durant to Gordon Hawyward.
"&gt; He was pretty much out of the league because of injuries.  That's his problem, not the HOF's. He was out of the league by age 30 pretty much.... that's not HOF level.  Let's say Kevin Durant has to retire due to his injury. He's 100% in the HOF despite retiring early. Would you say T-Mac is on KD's level?  &gt; No he didn’t have the career AI had,  **That's what I have been saying - he doesn't have the career of a first (or even 10th IMO) ballot Hall of Famer.**  For me, a first-ballot HOFer needs to be above and beyond even great. It needs to be something special. MVPs; deep playoff runs; longevity; accolades; stats; etc. etc.  T-Mac never made it out of the first round and while he had great stats, they were just that - stats.  &gt;The dude did not have empty stats, how old are you? Did you ever see him play in his prime?  They were empty because his team's offense played better when he was out (which is why the Rockets made it out of the first round when he got injured).  T-Mac didn't have the accolades, stats, playoff runs, or longevity first ballot HOFers should have. It's a joke he's in there right now."
"Based on the [Where's Kawhi I made last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8wk7t8/wheres_kawhi/)  People to look for:  - Kawhi  - Lebron and AD  - Zion and his new teammates (Josh Hart, Lonzo, Brandon Ingram)  - Kyle Kuzma  - Lawrence Frank and Steve Ballmer  - Jeanie Buss  - Masai  - Drake and Giannis  - Uncle Dennis  - New BFFs Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving  - Jayson Tatum as a baby  Have fun!"
"Kevin Durant, too. Both Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitski are just as tall or taller than players who list themselves at 7 foot, but I think it was the 90s and they fancied themselves as forwards, not centers, so they said 6'11""."
Yeah Kevin Durant is one of Thanos’ daughters. Take ur pick
"He's Kevin Durant, you know who he is.  Yeah, he made how in decisions."
"But we don't know any of that so this entire thing is pointless and the tweet is stupid.  You know when people say r/nba is a hive mind that collectively and blindly hates/loves people?  This is one of those threads that I would point towards to prove that.  And I'm not saying it's unwarranted or warranted to hate Kevin Durant in general, i'm saying that this post is a stupid reason to."
It's not close man. This is like arguing Draymond Green and Kevin Durant are close
"Regardless of the fact that Kevin Durant has issue with it and claims that there is BS in what Stephen A. said, out of all the speculation about what went down, I think Stephen A’s timeline holds the most water since it was corroborated by multiple sources as well as Kendrick Perkins."
Oh no. You mean the Cavs couldn’t beat arguably the greatest team of alll time? When a 73 win team added Kevin fucking Durant? Use your brain dude.
"I fully agree.  All the media &amp; fans who proclaim that a player can't be considered an all time great or legend without a ring, then complains about players colluding to form super teams in order to ring chase, need to stfu.  They created the environment for the Super team market to happen.  These current players see HOF players like Ewing, Barkley,  Iverson, etc....get shit on because team ownership didn't put a complete team around them in order to win it all.    As far as the saying that great players make their teammates better, Barkley said it best.  He said that Larry Bird got to make Kevin McHale, Cedric Maxwell and Robert Parrish better.  Magic had Kareem Abdul Jabbar,  Jamal Wilkes and James Worthy.  He had Julius Erving &amp; Bobby Jones at the end of their careers.   Moses was about to be traded.  Andrew Toney was hobbled with injuries.  The Sixers management then replaced these legends with such talents as Sedale Threatt, Terry Catledge, Manute Bol and Scotty Brooks.      Denying a player of their deserved and well earned status is unfair for a team sport player.  How legends like Ewing,  Miller, Barkley  and the rest are diminished all because they don't have a ring is the very reason current players like Durant, LBJ, AD, Love, Bosh, Allen and others are doing the ring chasing that is plaguing the modern NBA.  I don't blame them one bit.   They didn't create the perceptions but they are playing by those unwritten rules."
"If I was Kevin Durant, I’d wake up and be like wtf how did I turn into Kevin Durant?? /s"
"If I was Kevin Durant I would leave, because if I didn't, am I really a Kevin Durant?"
Kevin Durant and Lavine lol
"Our situation without KP is completely different than the warriors without KD.   The warriors do not need kevin durant to win a title. They won one already and won 73 games without him, and swept the trailblazers without him, and took toronto to 6 without him. Had they used Kd’s money on say 2 serviceable guys in 2016, or kept harrison barnes, they still win 2 out of 3 titles. They just don’t win them as easily. You don’t have to go 32-6 to win nba titles. They just wanted the path of least resistance.   The mavs havn’t made it out of round 1 in 8 years, so yea they need KP."
"Scene from practice yesterday: Kevin Durant gives Kyrie Irving a hug on his way off court. Kyrie: “Kevin’s my guy! … He’s a slim boy. He’s lanky. I feel like I’m a Chungus [next to him]. I gave him a hug just now and I enveloped him. I’ve never felt that way in my life."""
"So by your logic, Kevin Durant and DeAndre Jordan are both basically the same player? Both are around 7’0. Both can block shots. Both can get rebounds. But one can shoot the ball.   “Asinine-ass-ah-ten ass-ah-eleven comment” as SAS would say on first take"
Didn’t say he owned them. He is a super fan of Brooklyn and obviously has Roc Nation Sports agency.... who KEVIN DURANT is signed with.
"On First Take, Stephen A. said that the night before KD flew to the Hamptons, he had dinner with Russ, Nick Collison and Royal Ivey and told them he intended to stay and then after the Warriors’ pitch, he changed his mind.  Stephen A. also said that after he changed his mind, but was yet to make his announcement, he didn’t call Russ to let him know, he just sent him a text. He also said that although the narrative was all about KD not wanting to play with Russ, he was under the impression that KD’s disillusionment with the Thunder was specifically with Sam Presti, citing an instance where after KD won MVP, Nike wanted to put a banner up on Chesapeake Energy Arena congratulating Kevin and Sam Presti intervening saying that was out of the question and that they couldn’t put the banner up within 10-15 miles of the arena. During the episode, Kevin Durant apparently contacted Stephen A. Smith to say what Stephen said was, “BS,” and that he needs to, “check his sources.” Kevin Durant didn’t elaborate as to which parts were not true. Stephen A. addressed this live as it happened and said that, though he has multiple sources on these events, he is going to be fair and say that if what he said wasn’t true, multiple people are lying on him.  Kendrick is saying at least that the dinner part with telling Russ and them that he is coming back and then changing his mind in the Hamptons is for sure true."
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"What is your point, square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant"

"There are many leagues in many different countries (mostly USA, Europe, and China). NBA has the best players, most fans, biggest stadiums, etc.   The top 16 teams make NBA playoffs at the end of the season and play best-of-7 series tournament style. The last team remaining is the NBA Finals Champion.   The top 3 players are Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Kevin Durant (depending on who you ask)"
"Just noting that I’ve been to Nets games and have seen Lentz sitting courtside.   Also, back in 2016 the nets hired Kevin Durant’s personal trainer, who accompanied Durant and Lentz during a spiritual trip to Montana  https://www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2016/5/21/11733244/aldridge-brooklyn-nets-hire-kevin-durants-personal-trainer-as"

"Kevin Durant. Dude has a good heart, but gets shit on by the media."
"&gt; But in which area do you think he has to make the next step to get closer to Steph and to improve his teams record?    I think this is the problem right here: The comparisons to other players on other teams in very different situations.  Dame is an incredible player.  But to take the next step? To improve his team's record?  Dame needs a better team.  There is little Dame can do now as an individual to elevate his team by himself.  He needs help.  Steph has had the luxury of Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Iguadola, great coaching and an organization/ownership that was desperate enough -- Pre-Chapmionship -- to to do something crazy enough as to let Steph just be Steph.  And they lucked out.  The brand that Steph, Klay, Dryamond and Kerr built allowed them to get Kevin Durant.  I love CJ but imagine if CJ was as good as Klay? If they had a Draymond? An Iguadola? Had the resources to get Steve Kerr? The resources to get Kevin Durant?  Then we'd be talking about how Steph could be as good as Dame."
Kevin Durant browses here.
great franchise.   As opposed to the one whose ineptness cost them Kevin Durant and James Harden   and was a meeting away from letting Aquaman go (not to mention Green)   at least we can look forward to the next 2 decades of playoff near misses and first round exits

It has shades of Kevin Durant declaring independence from the Thunder.
I think you meant to post this link for your 5th source https://www.xonecole.com/jay-z-signs-kevin-durant-to-roc-nation-sports/  Also I remember seeing something like Kyrie wanted to join the nets and kd wanted the Knicks. Also kyrie grew up in nj so maybe that's why he has a liking for the nets? Interesting claims though. Need to see more about this Barclays/nets ownership and Carl lentz connection. Little iffy since jayz is no longer a Nets 1.5 percent owner since starting roc nation he had to sell his shares.

And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Kyrie. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other.

&gt; Kevin Durant turned up his nose at the Knicks  Wait - wasn't it them who said they didn't want to take the risk with him with the injury?
"&gt; The Knicks brain trust of Steve Mills, Scott Perry and David Fizdale were enjoying a laugh on the sidelines of a practice court at UNLV Wednesday, watching summer league practice.  &gt; They were a 3 ½-hour drive from Los Angeles, where in an alternate universe they would have been meeting with Kawhi Leonard.  &gt; As it played out, when Kevin Durant turned up his nose at the Knicks, the club realized any chance of nabbing Leonard without KD was a long shot.  &gt; According to a source, Leonard agreed to meet with the Knicks, but not until Wednesday after finishing with the Clippers and Lakers.  &gt; That plan was scratched by Knicks’ brass over logistics.  &gt; The Knicks had spent almost all of their $70 million cap space in the first 20 hours of free agency, knowing if they waited until the Leonard meeting Wednesday, the players they did sign could be off the market. It was too big a risk, knowing they likely would finish fourth behind the Raptors, Lakers and Clippers.  &gt; As it stood, Leonard reportedly flew back from LA to Toronto on Wednesday for the final meeting. The Knicks only can hope Leonard re-signs for one year with Toronto and becomes a free agent again in 2020. Five of the six free agents the Knicks signed are on one-year guarantees. Only Julius Randle got multiple years.  &gt; As of Wednesday, the Knicks still held $4 million of cap space and then a $4.8 room exception. They had only one spot left, though, on their 15-man roster. Lance Thomas is the favorite, as The Post reported, to fill the final spot. Vince Carter has also been mentioned. The Knicks could sign two players and cut one after a training camp battle.  &gt; According to a source, the Knicks still plan to exercise the $1.5 million team option by the July 15 deadline on 2017 draft pick Damyean Dotson despite signing shooting guards Reggie Bullock and Wayne Ellington and point guard Elfrid Payton."
kevin durant doesn’t respect the troops confirmed
"Jalen said last week on Get Up that Kevin Durant should and would sign with the Knicks. He thought that was the best possible spot of the 2 teams in New York, completely disregarding the Nets. So yeah, Jalen Rose is absolutely speaking on opinion here. Didn’t explain or go into any detail about any sort of sources"
DAngelo Russell is one of the most pick and roll oriented guards in the NBA  The Warriors notoriously run as little pick and roll as anybody in teh NBA  If Steve Kerr wasnt going to run more pick and roll when Kevin Durant was there he aint gonna start doing it now. DAngelo isnt the caliber of player you change your entire scheme around for frankly
But can he dunk on Kevin Durant?

Not that my opinion matters too much but Kevin Durant will never crack my Top 20 list for that stunt he pulled in GS
"Sure. Stats can miss the forest for the trees, especially in a game like basketball where there is so much codependency (unlike baseball, where many plays don't even involve non pitcher/batter players). One of the big issues with on/off stats (and stats in general) is that they don't do a great job untangling individual players from each other. Consider a team that had the 4 best players and Denzel Valentine as the starting 5, and a second unit of the 4 worst players and a clone of that same Denzel Valentine. You'd get a very, very different impression of those two players, statistically (and of the eye test too, honestly). Clearly, the stats have some limitations.   When I watch Curry, I see someone that certainly gets beat man-on-man his fair share, but he also does a good job switching, doesn't take many plays off, and gambles responsibly. He also gets more chances to fail because teams definitely plan on attacking him (a self-fulfilling prophecy). You aren't designing a plan of attack against the Warriors that involves attacking Draymond Green or Kevin Durant. You're going after the ""weak links,"" which are Klay and Curry.   I appreciate the conversation. I don't watch enough of the Warriors (I live in the Greater Chicago Area so I'm asleep most of the time lol) and certainly defer to your judgment there."
"Damn you guys are mad cocky for a team that just lucked into a championship. It took Embiid getting sick for half of the series for you guys to win on the luckiest bounce in NBA history.   And it took Kevin Durant tearing his Achilles, Looney breaking his collarbone, and Klay tearing his ACL for you guys to barely win in 6."
"Ive been seeing Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant a lot lately and ive never once known him to be referred to as such. Ive heard KD, Durantula, Slim Reaper, hell even The Serpent. Never Servant though.."
This is why you don't make an enemy of STEPHEN A SMITH kevin durant.
"Woj: ""The Clippers are the leading candidate to trade for the Brooklyn's disgruntled star Kevin Durant, the interest is mutual sources told ESPN"""
"KEVIN DURANT, I HAVE MANY CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIENDS WHO WILL RAIN HELLFIRE UPON YOUR HOME. YOU DONT WANT TO MAKE AN ENEMY OUT OF ME KEVIN"
"&gt;Top 2 in deflections. Top 2 in steals 1st in blocks amongst guards in the regular season. In the Warriors series, Kevin Durant and Curry's numbers and effencies were abysmal when guarded by Harden.  These are stats provided by that Chode dude regarding Harden. Further proving that stats are useless. Just use the *eye test* &amp; you can spot from a mile away that Curry &amp; Harden are average **at best** as on ball defenders."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is a dear friend of mine
"LeVert's not bad, just not better. Jaylen's averages are better despite his hand injury in the early part of the season. Playoff averages are a small sample size since it was 5 games against the same team; with Butler on D'lo, LeVert was able take advantage of Reddick and Harris' weak defense. While that is an accomplishment, it doesn't have the same weight.   &amp;#x200B;  LeVert is a great defender, but Jaylen takes it to another level. He a was top-3 guard in defensive win shares and led in opponent FG% (shots contested by Brown were 6.9% less likely to be makes). Brown's strength also makes him a more versatile defender than LeVert. Here are the numbers for some of the league's best when guarded by him:  Paul George: 52 possessions, 6/14 shooting, 2/7 from 3, 43/29 shooting splits,  Blake griffin: 60 possessions, 4/9 shooting, 0/2 from 3, 2 turnovers, 44/0 shooting splits,  Devin Booker: 51 possessions, 5/14 shooting, 2/6 from 3, 3 turnovers, 36/33 shooting splits  Zach Lavine: 45 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 0/4 from 3, 40/0 shooting splits  Donovan Mitchell: 35 possessions, 4/11 shooting, 2/7 from 3, 2 turnovers, 36/29 shooting splits,  Kevin Durant: 27 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 0/3 from 3, 40/0 shooting splits  James harden: 25 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 3/8 from 3, 40/38 shooting splits  Bradley Beal: 22 possessions, 1/3 shooting, 0/2 from 3, 2 turnovers, 33/0 shooting splits  Jimmy butler: 21 possessions, 0/2 shooting, 0/1 from 3, 0/0 shooting splits  &amp;#x200B;  Even his numbers against Kawhi (64 possessions, 8/16 shooting, 0/2 from 3, 1 turnover, 50/0 shooting splits) are still pretty decent."
"Kevin Durant , half human and reptilian"
Kevin Durant is half-reptile
"I have to argue that.  Boston was Bird the Superstar and Mchale and Parish role players. Ask your self if they could have gone somewhere else alone and do it. Bird could have. I saw these games.  LA was Kareem, and Magic was a role player when he was around. Magic has said so himself. Worthy was another great role player. I saw these games.  Chicago was Jordan and Pippen and Rodman where role players. Individually could they have done like Jordan would have carried a team like he did early in his career? same as Bird.  Those were not Super teams, it was a dynasty with a well defined role team.  Today we have top players playing together. top 5 players and 4 of them are in 2 teams.  You have to look at your argument from a ""top"" player in the NBA at the time. Was Mchale a top 5, Parish, Rodman, Pippen?  no.  &amp;#x200B;  LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irvin, Steph curry? These are top NBA players playing in 3 teams."
That's fine.  But in your argument Kevin Durant is the 8th most popular person in the league.  Doesnt that seem off?  Most people i know who don't watch basketball know who KD is but havent heard of Irving.
Oh shit Kevin Durant still available ?
"It absolutely does. This is why, in my mind, Kevin Durant will never be an ""all-time"" great player unless he wins a few more championships as the main carry on his team. He'll always just be a fucking 7ft snake to me."
"https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future  It's a pretty devastating injury. Hopefully he will bounce back well, but is just about every case except Wilkins, players were never quite the same."
"&gt; the rockets? title favorites?  Yes.  They are the team that has been the best against the Warriors the last two years, and the Warriors are not the juggernaut they were any more without Kevin Durant.    &gt; The team wasn't good enough to win it all the last two years  In 2018 the Rockets played the Warriors and lost 4-3.  In 2019 they played the Warriors again and lost 4-2, with the largest margin of victory in any game being 6.  &gt; And nene retired, so aren't their starting bigs are like PJ tucker and Clint Capela?  I think it's pretty stupid to judge a roster while they are still signing players.  Were you shitting on the Lakers for only having 4 players signed while they kept cap space open for Kawhi too?  Houston will sign another big or two.  Faried is likely coming back.  They can probably get some guys like Zaza or Tyson Chandler to give them backup minutes."
"If by “struggle badly” you mean “still be an elite player”, then yes.  And if by “do you think Kevin Durant would struggle badly if he played during 1990s?” you mean “am I asking a stupid question”, then yes"
"Man, imagine what he turned MVPs James Harden and Kevin Durant in too"
Kevin Durant never won a ring without Curry  That means Rondo is better than him because he won a ring by himself 😤😤😤😤
Since Kevin Durant left OKC these are Westbrook’s playoff stats   MPG: 39.1  eFG%: 43%  Turnovers per game: 5.3  WS/48: .6  USG: 39.1  DRtg per 100: 108  PF per game: 4.4  🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
No one is talking about Davis Lee. He was our first all star in 16 years. He broke the spell. He also was very important in the few years before Kevin Durant.
"hes playing with the dudes he wanted, KD and DeAndre, and back with his favorite team growing up. yall are just salty he left you after saying he would stay and how he didnt give a shit in the playoffs cause your young guys got big egos and he wanted out. Theres more to that story than a lot of people will ever know of his time in Boston. Gimpy Long Legs Reaper was wanted by a lot more teams than us still, and he's in a great spot to recover. 2 time champion, 1 MVP, and 4 scoring titles and yall still wanna hate?? Please. Also, Kevin freaking Durant!! C's fans stay salty though."
"They didn't lose the best player on their team, they lost Kevin Durant. Also Draymond is now the second best player on the team.  Otherwise, I think you make good points, they are super thin now. One injury to Curry or Draymond and they are fucked."
Yep. It’s crazy to think what Westbrook could have accomplished had he been surrounded by legitimate supporting cast that could space the floor. Instead he got stuck with James Harden and Kevin Durant.
"You really don't realize how hard it is to get the caliber of player Russell is and how horrible things have to go for you to drop out so quickly.  Look at the top ten from 5 years ago.  \[SI has\]( [https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/09/20/top-100-players-of-2014-nos-10-1](https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/09/20/top-100-players-of-2014-nos-10-1) ):     10.Carmelo Anthony  &amp;#x200B;  9.Kobe Bryant  &amp;#x200B;  8.Dwyane Wade  &amp;#x200B;  7.Dwight Howard  &amp;#x200B;  6.Tim Duncan  &amp;#x200B;  5.Russell Westbrook  &amp;#x200B;  4.Tony Parker  &amp;#x200B;  3.Chris Paul  &amp;#x200B;  2.Kevin Durant  &amp;#x200B;  1.Lebron James  &amp;#x200B;  Going into last season \[SI\]( [https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/10/top-100-nba-players-2019-lebron-james-stephen-curry-dirk-nowitzki](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/10/top-100-nba-players-2019-lebron-james-stephen-curry-dirk-nowitzki) ) still had LeBron and KD at 1 and 2, Westbrook at 7, and CP3 at 8.  The lone guy who fell out and it wasn't because of old age (being 35+)  was Dwight Howard.  Over this five year span the guys who moved into the top 10 to take those spots were guys who were guys like Harden and Curry who were young and still considered top 15 players at the time.  Russ is only 30, I'm more than willing to bet that he can maintain his play for another 3 years."
"I dont think that health is the problem in westbrooks trade value.   I think it more has to do with his personality/style of play. He is a very ball dominant and wants to be ""that"" guy, but would a team with westbrook as a main guy ( i dont see him stepping back to another stars just like carmelo didnt want to) win a championship??  His style of play doesnt work in playoffs, pulling of 30 bad shots, contested 3s etc. People where saying that Durant would never win a championship with WB, and its true. After KD left he was terrible in playoffs.    If westbrook doesnt take a step back and ""pass a torch to other guys"", fokus more on playmaking and stop forcing things, he would never win a championship. Because of that people dont want to team up with him.  Yes his stats are great, but, as Kevin mcHale said today on nba gametime: if u are a bit atletic, can shoot, its easy in todays nba average 20,30 ppg, but to win games and championships? thats rly hard.  And thats the difference between players like westbrook/harden and players like kawhi/lebron/KD."
Because he's Kevin fucking Durant.
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2784437-paul-george-i-wanted-to-join-lakers-last-year-but-they-didnt-trade-for-me.amp.html there's a link. I'm not too worried about KD due to his doctor that did his surgery is on the Nets staff and hes had all his previous surgeries done in New York, hes in the best place to recover. There comes risk with every injury. Boogie and Kobe werent the same, but Zach Lavine has been doing just fine after he tore his ACL for the bulls and still has a great burst. Nobody knows what people will be like after injury until they get on the court, but its Kevin Durant. If we didnt give him the max someone else would have. I dont regret it at all even if he comes back 3/4 of what he used to be , that's still an all star. Plus kyrie will take a lot of pressure off him as well as their role players. Hes in a good spot to in my opinion"
"You haven't referenced any basketball facts about his play other than how he was super inefficient this past season.   He's still probably the best playmaker since prime Rondo, a great rebounder, and capable scorer.   But yea, since he hasn't won an away playoff game since Durant he's a negative asset. Kemba has never even made it out of the first round. Weatbrooks a league MVP, has been to three conference finals and a finals. Don't try and pretend like he got carried to those.   Have you forgotten who played the best for the thunder in that 2016 playoff run? Hint, it wasn't Kevin Durant."

"He’s never made it out of the first round without Kevin Durant, and he’s played with Oladipo and Paul George since he left."
What star went to a small market this Summer? Lol  Anthony Davis - forced his way from NOLA to LA Paul George - forced his way from OKC to LA Kawhi Leonard - LA Demarcus Cousins - LA Danny Green - LA Kyrie Irving - NYC Kevin Durant - NYC Julius Randle - NYC D'angelo Russell - San Francisco Tobias Harris - Philadelphia Al Horford - Philadelphia Kemba Walker - Boston Jimmy Butler - Miami (a smaller but very glamorous market)  Redick went from PHI to NOLA but other than him not many players seem to have gotten the memo.
Zach could call Kevin Durant a bad player and this sub would probably believe it and start repeating it. This place loves him
Ya'll had this guy named Kevin Durant for a while.
Not much use looking at a single player. Here's a better breakdown https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future
"That's... not how that stat works. Durant had a 4.3 BPM, by your reading that means they were doing 3.1 worse with Kevin Durant on the floor.  In fact, literally every player on the roster doesn't have a BPM high enough by your reading of that stay to be a ""positive."""
"Kevin Durant is 7'0 with an offensive arsenal that takes advantage of and uses his size.  As far as I know, his achilles injury didn't make him 6'6''.  He'll still be able to shoot over everyone.  He's also a stick."
"&gt;Despite Westbrook’s steely exterior, he may be more connected to a single fan base — and more embraced by it — than any superstar in the league. Kevin Durant moved on; George came and went. But Westbrook’s commitment to the Thunder has never publicly wavered.  &gt;Still, his legacy is complicated.  &gt;...Those playoff struggles might ease the burden of losing Westbrook for a franchise that grew accustomed to success for most of its first decade. If the Thunder under Westbrook have grown stale, is it time to start fresh?         I'm literally fucking crying right now."
"And with the first pick, Seattle pick Kevin Durant, again"
"I've said it before but a lot of the problem is for some reason it's treated like if a player is supermax eligible you have two options a) pay them 35% of the cap or b) let them walk. But those aren't the only options. You can give them 32% of the cap or 33%, even 31% is more than any other team will offer.  A *very* select few players are worth supermax contracts, but more players are eligible and worth more than the max. Why should John Wall get a contract that was designed for Kevin Durant?"
Someone is always going to hate on a decision. Just choose and live with it. That's what infuriates me with KD. He seems so insecure about comments from nobodies judging his action. He is Kevin Fucking Durant. There is zero need to explain himself with all the burner accounts and twitter feuds.
The biggest mystery about Kevin Durant to me is that he's the only player who ever willingly walked away from playing with Steph Curry.
"They do, but not in the same way its used in the NBA.  Like there are people who question the legacy of Kevin Durant just because he chose to play for the Warriors.  Would anybody question the legacy of Mike Trout if he decided to sign with the Dodgers or the Yankees?  No  How about the legacy of Ovi, as you mentioned, if he signed with the Penguins during their heyday to win more cups?  Nobody would question his legacy because of it.  I guess that is what I was getting at."
"Also, the Thunder also once had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook all on the same team (with Ibaka!) and didn’t win a title.  You win some and lose some."
It's a term used by broke people or people who can't even break into the middle class use. Broke bitchbois who can't fathom how much money is at stake at the level the NBA guys are at. I'm sure Kevin Durant should have stayed and always loss with Westbrook because hE iS LoYaL like a stupid fucking clown.
Hard to say. You'll still see some fans who will boo him over the fact that he requested a trade. I think most of us wish him well though as a person regardless of what we got back for him. If we had gotten less there certainly would have been more judgement placed on Presti than PG.  Kevin Durant situation was different though. Fuck that guy.
"You're posting this in a comment chain about how Kawhi ""fun guy"" Leonard , the most chillest dude in the fucking NBA, should be more hated than Kevin ""snake"" Durant."
Imagine the haul Presti could have got with Kevin Fucking Durant.
"During the Rockets series Westbrook shot the Thunder out of every game, and were one ref whistle away from being swept. The next year they had homecourt advantage against an injured Jazz team led by a rookie. And the Blazers, whom Thunder fans had called a ""first round bye"" knocked out the Thunder in 5 games despite missing their second best player.    And maybe your memory is a bit short, but you do know it was Kevin Durant who led the Thunder to a 3-1 lead over the hobbled Warriors, right?"
"Literally no sonics fan is anything but apathetic to the guy, Clay bennett should be hung right next to him though, and Kevin durant is a local hero for leaving you fucking pricks"
"You got more burner accounts than Kevin Durant himself. Vote manipulation is cute, but how do y'all kids even have that much time. Ya got to be lifeless as fuck  &gt;  Well, then again.. iwho am i even kidding lol it makes sense  &gt;  Carry on fool"
"The next question, if you will, couldn’t be any more painfully obvious now: How long will Russell Westbrook remain in Oklahoma City?  Now that the Thunder have chosen to part ways with Paul George, granting his wish by sending him to the Clippers in exchange for a massive haul and helping L.A. land Kawhi Leonard in the process, the uncertainty that surrounds their former MVP is as glaringly obvious as that water tower that breaks up the city’s skyline in Bricktown. Even before you start to dissect all the personal dynamics, or the history between Westbrook and the organization that has grown so much more complicated in recent years in the wake of Kevin Durant’s departure, there’s this harsh reality as it relates to this trade: the timelines between the two sides don’t match anymore.  When you land the sort of haul that Thunder general manager Sam Presti pulled in, you simply have to come to grips with the fact that the title-contending dream has been replaced by the recovery and rebuild. The Thunder received five first-round picks in all: one unprotected from Miami in 2021 and one protected from the Heat in 2023 (1 to 14); three unprotected from the Clippers in 2022, 2024, and 2026. What’s more, they received the right to swap picks (unprotected) in 2023 and 2025.  Last but certainly not least, it’s the arrival of second-year point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander that informs the widespread belief around the league that Westbrook’s days with the Thunder are numbered. The Clippers spent the entire season raving about the 20-year-old who was taken 11th overall out of Kentucky, envisioning a dream scenario where Kevin Durant and Leonard would come their way and Gilgeous-Alexander would eventually evolve into a worthy co-star alongside those greats.  This, it’s quite clear, isn’t the kind of player who would be excited about being a backup for the next four seasons in which Westbrook is owed a combined $171 million (including a player option in 2022-23 in which he’d be paid $47 million). And if you’re in Presti’s position, try chewing on these economics without spitting out your Thunder stick: Gilgeous-Alexander, by comparison, is owed $13.5 million combined during the next three seasons.  So, where does this all go?  Sources confirmed an ESPN report that Presti, Westbrook and his longtime agent, Thad Foucher, are expected to talk in the coming days about how to best handle this unexpected situation. None of them knew until just a few days ago that Leonard had put on his recruiting hat and convinced George to seek a trade, and now they’re left to figure out the best path forward for all involved. And while the mountains of money owed to Westbrook are known to have scared quite a few general managers away, sources say that Detroit and Miami are very real possibilities as potential landing spots for the 30-year-old, eight-time All-Star.  The Heat landed Jimmy Butler via a sign-and-trade with Philadelphia in free agency, and they could conceivably build a package around the likes of Goran Dragic (one year, $19.2 million remaining) and former Thunder guard Dion Waiters (two years, combined $24.7 million) to pair him with Westbrook. The Pistons’ scenario appears to be potentially trickier, with likely candidates to make the salaries match including big man Andre Drummond (two years, $55.8 million combined, including a player option in 2020-21), former Thunder guard Reggie Jackson (one year, $18 million) and Tony Snell (two years, $23.5 million combined, with a player option in 2020-21).  Rival executives have also pinpointed the Houston Rockets as a likely suitor, which would come as no surprise considering the way general manager Daryl Morey has prioritized the pursuit of stars during his entire career (not to mention the possible reunion between Westbrook and his old Thunder teammate James Harden). The notion of Westbrook sharing the floor with two other ball-dominant guards is unorthodox, to say the least, but Morey has long held the belief that landing as many elite players as possible is the path to championship glory.  Though the Thunder discussed George trades with both the Clippers and Raptors this week, multiple sources said Westbrook was not made available in those talks. With George gone, though, discussions are likely to open up.  The Thunder like to move patiently, and in silence. They managed only half of that in trading George, with negotiations that stayed under wraps but were rushed, as necessitated by his sudden trade request and a limited window in which to work.  There’s no looming deadline with Westbrook, and OKC is unlikely to enter lightly into trading him. He has played his entire 11-year career with the Thunder. Parting would be painful, even if both parties agree it’s for the best.  Despite Westbrook’s steely exterior, he may be more connected to a single fan base — and more embraced by it — than any superstar in the league. Kevin Durant moved on; George came and went. But Westbrook’s commitment to the Thunder has never publicly wavered.  Still, his legacy is complicated.  The Thunder haven’t won a playoff series since Durant left for Golden State in free agency. Oklahoma City tried pairing Westbrook with Victor Oladipo and then with George without postseason success to show for it.  Those playoff struggles might ease the burden of losing Westbrook for a franchise that grew accustomed to success for most of its first decade. If the Thunder under Westbrook have grown stale, is it time to start fresh?  That’s the next question facing the Thunder, and it may prove challenging to answer. Westbrook is rooted in Oklahoma City’s past, but their future together rarely has seemed so uncertain."
*Kevin Durant has entered the chat.*
"This is beautiful   Y’all went from Having Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russel Westbrook to   We have 6 late first round picks from a team that’s probably going to contend for the finals for the next 5 years.    Literally Kevin Durant was gifted to you like candy and y’all have nothing to show for it. No way in hell does any of these draft picks turn out to be KD + Westbrook + Harden. Second what tf are you going to get for Westbrook? The only teams that can offer anything good is the Heat ( not a lot of young talent) or Orlando ( you can get some good talent here) but it will never equal KD, Westbrook and Harden.   God this gets me so upset about what could have been. Seattle could have Steve Balmer as the owner with KD and Westbrook. I promise Balmer would’ve fired Pretsi for someone who would bring titles."
"&gt;Kawhi Leonard is the big winner in the off-season two years in a row.   Kawhi requested a trade to LA and got sent to another country. I'd hardly call that a win.  &gt;He sat out a year in San Antonio due to an injury, but the Spurs tried to rush him back.  When Kawhi first came back from injury, the Spurs played him every other game on very limited minutes. When he still didn't feel 100% they stopped playing him and he was deemed out indefinitely.  &gt; Kawhi sought an outside opinion and it infuriated the Spurs.   The Spurs gave him full control over his rehab August 2017, and there's no evidence they were hesitant in doing so.  &gt;The Spurs called him selfish.  There's no proof of this. His teammates did question his leadership, which was justified considering he basically abandoned the team and wouldn't give anyone any idea about his whereabouts, and also gave dates he would return and never follow through on them, creating distrust within the locker room.  &gt; He was traded to the Raptors next year and won a chip against one of the best dynasties in NBA history.  A more accurate description would be an extremely crippled Warriors team, but ok.  &gt;During the finals, Kevin Durant was rushed back and ended up tearing his MCL.  Ruptured Achilles, not MCL.  &gt;This made Kawhi's decision to sit out accurate, and it exposed the training staff of NBA franchises.   Not saying he faked an injury, but he was cleared by Spurs doctors completely cleared him, so take with that what you will.  &gt;He stated multiple times during the year via close sources that he hated the cold.   Sure, idk.  &gt;People thought he would stay on the Raptors to build a dynasty.   Sure.  &gt;He left for the Lakers.   He's literally on the Clippers.  &gt;He did all this by rarely speaking to the press.  Yeah true.  &gt;Shoot I don't know if the dude can actually talk.  He can.  &gt;Kawhi is the new face of the NBA. Get used to it.  He's definitely not. KD, LeBron, Curry, and maybe even dudes like Harden and Westbrook are all more popular than Kawhi."
Warriors if they get a guy like Kevin Durant
"Most likely any Canadian pro player dreamed about playing for us, and Kevin Durant said Raptors were his childhood team, so that's false. Raptors were never as much as a joke as the Clippers before CP3 and Griffin. We were until we got Carter, then Vince elevated us, hence someone like KD liking us."
"Oh for sure.  But Kevin Durant did the exact wrong thing and insist this was the ""hardest road"" and shit.  If Kawhi went to the Lakers and said, ""Fuck it, I want more rings"" then at least his actions are consistent with his sentiment.  &amp;#x200B;  KD took the easy route and insisted it was the hardest road.  Butler is going to a team that is not going to contend and is saying he wants to win.  That's what bothers me.  Nothing inherently wrong with it, but just doesn't seem genuine."
Fuck Kevin Durant  haha guys the capitalized letters spell “F KD” haha
Still fuck Kevin durant
"And also Kevin Durant is a bitch who needed to join a super team to win rings, which literally every single superstar has done or has had around them."
"It’s funny cuz after the thunder get eliminated for this exact reason every single year, people will agree with this take for like a week. And then they all go back to downvoting it to oblivion despite the fact that it’s proven on an annual basis regardless of how good his help is. I mean it didn’t even work with fucking Kevin Durant, like obviously there is **some** issue with his playing style."
LeBron leaves a team that didn’t build correctly around him to make a super team in Miami = Huge douche bag  Kevin Durant leaves a team that didn’t build around him to join a super team that already won championships = LeBron was much worse.  It seems people just dislike LeBron despite the lack of logic.
“Super team” is getting thrown around too much.  Every legit contender with multiple superstars isn’t a super team.  A 73 win team that adds Kevin Durant is a super team.
1. Kevin Durant - Brooklyn 2. Terry Rozier - Charlotte 3. Klay Thompson - Golden State
\* *whispers* \*  ^Kevin ^Durant
"Same shit, different sport. Happens with baseball too. Only difference is that there’s a money factor influencing that too.   Don’t really have a clear answer aside from do the best you can like Toronto, Indiana, and Utah try to, and go from there. Perhaps like someone else suggested, you could add a salary meter to franchises per market size? Not sure how much more per small market would be needed though, or how that would calculate.  Potentially create a rule that lowers the tax apron down so that it’s reached sooner per contract over a certain amount that isn’t signed under the Kevin Durant rule (which would make those signed under that rule be given more incentive). Could also have the bonus cash used under that rule to be forced into a non-cap space salary bonus, that would count against the tax but not the cap. So if you signed your homegrown star then traded for another, you would be able to maneuver it in your cap but it would still cost as much.   Could also force a trade kicker into the KD rule signings, so a team trying to trade for one has to eat some absurd amount like 25% bonus of the full contract out of pocket. Wouldn’t limit or hurt the player since they’d get the money, but would discourage trades with those players. Though I think the first this would happen would be Westbrook if he’s traded, so idk if that’s worth it.  Player wise, it’s just hard to say. Some want the location for themselves / family. Others want what the team can offer. Maybe some just want home. It differs per case, so I don’t think there’s one answer there. With them having so much leverage in negotiations too, it’s hard to say they’d do anything that restricts freedom.  Tough situation all around."
"""Hey Kevin wanna team up on the Clippers"" - Kawhi  ""Sounds interesting but I already have a commitment to go to the Nets with Kyrie"" - Durant  ""What's a commitment?"" - Kawhi  ""Later man, good luck though"" - Durant"
Kevin Durant is the most slept on scorer in the league
"This is ironic because it sounds like you're the one who didn't watch the series and only looked at the box score. Pat played good defense, it's just that there's only so much you can do against Kevin Durant."
Bev played as good of defense as he could've played. Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant though
"Dwyane Wade, Lebron James, Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, OJ Mayo, Michael Beasely all exist"
"you really compare Brandon Ingram to Kevin Durant comp to what I'm talking about? Laughable.  PG was 1st team All-NBA, top3 DPOY this season. It's not farfetched at all."
"If you have to add in “we’ll see if they overachieve” then that means they aren’t currently better. It’s like comparing Brandon Ingram to Kevin Durant because eventually he might over achieve to become better, well it’s a dumb ass question to ask right now."
"1. Because they wouldn’t have had to give more up since KD was also a FA  2. Cause it’s fucking Kevin Durant, yeah there’s a high risk to signing him but imagine if you actually got Kevin Durant back. Kawhi and him would be unstoppable"
really? even with Kevin Durant now on the Nets?

Again, I'm not the one shouting team success at you. you're saying he cant get it done...its a team game. no one can get it done alone. Lebron ""couldnt get it done"" in 2018, that doesnt mean he wasnt the best player on the floor in those playoffs right?"
"Top 10?  Just of the top of my head: Curry, Harden, LeBron, Giannis, AD, Jokic, Embiid, KAT, PG, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler  See? He's not a top 10 player."
JESUS CHRIST the problem was KEVIN DURANT joining a 73 FREAKIN' 9 TEAM
"Not as even arguably the best player on his team. Kevin Durant was, at that time, the 3 consecutive time scoring champ, and was unquestionably the best player on that team."
One superstar caliber player with him. Lou Williams has performed at a fringe all star level with the Clippers. Was not a worse player than Russell last season.   Kawhi tried to recruit a player that is arguably better than him in Kevin Durant.
It's debatable whether this Clippers team is a worse supporting cast than the Cavs LeBron joined.   Kawhi called Kevin Durant and Paul George to team up. LeBron did the same.
No you're right. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson going down for 90% of the finals had nothing to do with the outcome.
"Kevin Durant, Harden, and prime Ibaka got us to the finals... not Brooks."
"hey man, the warriors had it coming after years of capitalizing off of other teams injuries during this four year run.   and energy/karma is real, this kevin durant shit was the final straw.   it also isn’t a secret that kawhi was on one leg since milwaukee &amp; lowry needed surgery on his hand.  it happened, it’s over, these what ifs are pointless.  this entire subreddit had giannis better than kawhi, and if kawhi doesn’t hit that shot, the 76ers may pull it out in OT."
"[Durant met Randy M. Williams during his freshman year at the University of Texas in 2006-07, and they have been friends ever since.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/kevin-durant-first-time-champ-2017-finals/amp/)    Y’all believe what y’all want to, just like the woj situation with the clippers. Facts are facts."
Bro you guys had James harden Kevin durant and Russell Westbrook and still couldn’t win a chip hold this L my man
"Right now it looks like the only times since 2000 that small/non-marquee narrative has worked is with Tim Duncan/San Antonio, and Damian Lillard/Portland.  Also, the Clippers with Blake and the Raptors with Demar probably would've stayed together but the team made the trade decision.   On the other hand, AD, Paul George (x2), Kawhi (x2), Kyrie (x2), Gordon Hayward, Kevin Durant (2016), LaMarcus Aldridge (2015), Kevin Love, Melo (2011), Deron Williams (2011), Dwight Howard (2011), Lebron (2010), Chris Bosh (2010), Elton Brand (2008), Baron Davis (2008), Vince Carter (Raptors to Nets), Tracy McGrady (Magic to Rockets) all ditched their non-marquee markets in some contentious way and that's just off the top of my head."
Who’s talking about Kevin Durant?
"And I think had some of those teams *not* had Westbrook and instead a less ball-dominant PG, OKC would have had even more Finals appearances and definitely at least one ring.  He's a great player, but it's telling that the Thunder have been unable to advance past the first round since Kevin Durant left. And from Oladipo to Sabonis to George (not Carmelo, that man is straight trash as a teammate if you want to play championship basketball) - your front office has worked wizardry in surrounding Westbrook with talent. But the talent is always under utilized because of Westbrook's ball-dominance (some might even call it ball-hogging)."
"Lakers have Antonio Davis, but they were a car wreck last year and I'm not convinced the front office is done with its squabbles. No guarantee they'll turn it around this year.  Clippers have Kawhi -- who needs load management to be effective -- and just traded their entire future for Paul George. A guy who cheated on the head coach's daughter with a stripper. I wish the best for Kawhi, but there's no guarantee this works out. (the Raptors had depth.)  Warriors are one year older, lost Kevin Durant, and Clay Thompson is gone most of the year.  None of the teams should be discounted, but they all have flaws."
"Yeah, all this stuff comes out after the fact.  These ""reporters"" are awful.  I remember Broussard saying ""Kawai was a Lakers fan growing up"", and I was reading this morning one of the other twitter reporters saying ""He was an Allen Iverson fan so he rooted for the 76ers in the 01 finals""  Wuuuuuut?  There are also Kevin Durant stories that came out this past week.  Like the one about KD being pissed about the injury.    I think i'm done with reporters."
"He's borderline at best and not to mention this is a huge fucking drop off from Kevin Durant. We also don't know when Klay will be back or how he'll look when he's able to play in high intensity playoff games. Draymond is Dennis Rodman type all star in the sense that he's more of a complimentary intangibles kind of guy, all on all he's a better third option then a second. I'm not entirely sure he's made for that role . There's too much uncertainty on that team to call them a superteam. It reminds me of this sub having a heart attack last year when Boogie signed with them despite the fact that he was broken down at the time."
"Tear down and rebuild from the draft. Small market teams have a smaller window and have to do a lot more of rebuilding.  OKC had their window when they had Kevin Durant, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, and Russell Westbrook from 09-12, and they made the finals in 2012."
"2016/17 vs Houston. Russ was clearly the best player in the series but there was no shooting around him. Roberson was the 2nd leading scorer.   17/18 vs Jazz: PG was hurt, Melo was shit + Russ struggled against Gobert. All of that might have been fine if it wasn't for the fact that on ISOs vs Melo, the Jazz were more efficient than Kevin Durant is in the regular season  18/19 vs Blazers: Literally zero shooting from anyone. Abrines would have eliviated that but he was waived due to personal reasons. If anyone can see what a struggle it can be to get good role players to a small market team, it should be a Kings fan lmao"
"I've never understood this argument.    Kevin Durant averaged 35 PPG including a 45 and 50 point game to finish them off, so pretending that the Warriors just took it easy on the Clippers makes 0 sense."
"Paul ""Kevin Durant"" George"
"https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Kevin-Durant-Kawhi-Leonard-free-agency-Clippers-14060976.php  Nah that came out before we found out about KDs decision. It was reported that after kawhis call, that KD and to rethink his decision a bit, but eventually stuck with his plan to play with Kyrie"
They also traded Kevin Durant in that trade.
The article has since been deleted but on Februrary 2nd 2016 Woj did say that If KD left the Thunder it would be for the Warriors  [Article talking about it](http://thesource.com/2016/02/02/a-new-team-has-reportedly-emerged-as-frontrunner-in-the-kevin-durant-sweepstakes/) Theres a link in there but it's dead. Was there any reports before that about KD leaving the Thunder?
"I agree this is an awful comparison, Gary and Karl were well past their prime, AD and Kawhi are at their APEX talent and skill wise. Nobody ever viewed them picking up Steve and Dwight as any sort of “super team”, Steve was again past his prime, and Dwight just never “wanted it” to the point where Kobe called him out on it. If you think the two scenarios illustrated represented super teams you need to turn in your basketball card and stop talking about it on public forums. The Karl and Gary version of the Lakers were already a super team who had won 3 titles in row. Also you say super teams aren’t guarantees but the Warriors proved you wrong the day the picked up Kevin Durant and won two titles in the aftermath and would have won three if weren’t for injuries, the only thing capable of derailing teams of this calibur. The two teams tour mentioned lost straight up..."
Post Achilles Kevin Durant is not Kevin Durant
"He had all these stars? To give a quick summary he said   Klay Thompson: ""Would meet with Clippers if Warriors don't present 5-year max"" this was confirmed by Klay's dad. He got the 5-year max.   Kyrie Irving: Never mentioned Clippers as suitors.   Kevin Durant: Mentioned Clippers were a team he was considering along with The Warriors/Knicks. Didn't sign with Clippers or meet.   Kawhi Leonard: Multiple times mentioned that The Clippers were favorites and in good position to land him. Was correct.    Doesn't look that bad to me."
"&gt; Its was unlikely with their roster.  Why though? That series against the Warriors it looked like they had a pretty solid roster... the missing piece was a reliable star. That was supposed to be Gallo but he didn't show up every night.   He avg'd 25 in wins and even though he had 29 in the last game he avg'd only about 13 in the losses... when he hit shots they were solid and beat the Warriors. Lou Williams also played well but Warriors defense were able to figure him out and Lou didn't have a 2nd star to relieve the pressure they put on him.  So to me, the roster was already pretty solid. That was a real basketball team that showed up without an All-Star and they gave the defending champions who had and MVP in Kevin Durant (arguably best player in the league b4 achilles), another MVP in Steph Curry (arguably best shooter in NBA history), and multiple All-Star Klay Thompson...   If a team with 0 All-Stars can give the defending champions a run for their money to the point where Warriors showed them the utmost of respect after the series... that's a team with just 1 missing piece. That's a team for a player like Kawhi, who focuses on hard work, team work, team play.  I thought with that roster it was very likely, the Raptors likely, and the Lakers would have been a strange destination."
"alright all you fanboys out here saying westbrook is top 10 who is he better than?  Curry LeBron Kawhi Paul George Giannis Harden Davis Lillard Embiid Jokic   And that's not including injured Kevin Durant and borderline cases like Kyrie, Jimmy Butler. You can't be top 10 if there are 10 players definitively better than you."
"There’s no guarantee of that. A bad injury could negate any future earnings after 4 years. Look at KD’s situation—he couldn’t convince the Knicks to offer him a max and it’s clear why:  A leading Achilles expert, Dr. Anish Kadakia, of Northwestern University, has reviewed studies showing 85% of NBA players who suffer Achilles tendon ruptures don’t last more than two seasons after their return. ([link](https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/) )"
"There once was a player named Kevin Durant.   In the Golden Age of NBA he played    The crown in the east he looked to supplant   hearing that Board man would go to LA    But Boardman's decision was not all made up,   for two teams there were in LA,   As part of a Hydra, he could well suit up,   But rescuing was more his forte.     He Beckoned to George, an old summer fling,   to leave his beloved in haste,   as the sharpshooter Lillard had left a pure sting,   and there were championships left to chase    The Frenchman LeBron would stand in the way,   as landing AD was a coup,   Bron's aim was more than to vie today,   for he chased MJ's ghost too    Suddenly left and right one could see blooming,   all had been absent three years,   Parity once again now would be booming,   alleviating so many fan's fears    For not only were these three teams bracing,   but more in east and west teams trained   The Warriors still had their dangerous spacing   While Rockets still shot 3s like Butane    Horford and Josh reinvigorate Philly   Conley brings new life to Jazz,   Giannis continues to make teams look silly    and Dipo will regain his pizazz    For once again now and we hope forever,   we have our coveted parity   Though not lasting long we must still endeavor,    to give to Toronto's dear charities"
He did the same about Kevin Durant lol
Kevin Durant won’t play this year
"You’re legit a pure fool, if you think Kevin fuckin Durant, the man that has been better than Kawhi  his entire career, the man that bitches Kawhi every time they play would not do better on those Spurs team. You’re adding a 30 ppg scorer to a great defensive team and offensive team.    Put Kawhi on those OKC teams and they don’t even come close to the Finals"
https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8  Why Durant left
"&gt;Why are people forgetting that Curry outplayed Kawhi in the finals? If curry had that same raptors team they win the finals if Kawhi and him switch places lol..    Curry won his first championship because he played against a broken and injured Cavs team, who had 2 of their all stars injured for the series.   &gt;  Then he won his next 2 championships, because he recruited Durant.. after getting bullied and fucked by LeBron in the 2016 Finals, even with a 73 win team. So putting Durant on that 73 win team, made them the super team of all superteams. 4-5 all stars in the starting line up, something that never happened before in the NBA history  &gt;  And your illiterate bum ass have the audacity to even think Curry would have won if he had the Raptors roster? What did Kawhi have? Lowry? Siakam?  LeBron destroyed all of them single handedly for almost a decade  &gt;  Oh, and no.. Curry never outplayed Kawhi in the Finals. You are watching the box score, and didn't watch the live game. Curry is the main reason they lost that series. Yes, their best player, Kevin Durant, not playing.. didn't help. But Curry was utter garbage in every single 4th Quarter, especially when his team needed something special.. Curry just shit the bed  &gt;  Even in Game 6, when Klay almost single handedly saved their season.. then got injured.. Curry shit the bed again in the 4th Q, and Toronto won it all in the end.   &gt;  So just, stop trying to bait people with ya dluded horseshit. Fuck outa here fool  &gt;   Go and drink some milk boy. Ya need it"
"So it’s obvious to me that Kawhi and the Clippers organizations intentionally dragged out his free agency to the last minute possible. The clippers did whatever they could to drag this so they could make sure they weakened the Lakers free agency prospects. Kawhi never planned on signing with the Lakers after this season. Maybe when he wanted off the Spurs but not this year.  This is supported by his call to Kevin Durant to team up before he went to The Nets. He preferred Durant to AD and Lebron. They intentionally did this as Jerry West is a vengeful SOB and wanted to sabotage the Lakers. I hope we shit on the Clippers next season.   This was all a ruse to ensure a PG trade, that’s why we were strung along. I will be deleting this account, I held out hope for a year only to be cucked.  Edit: Forgot to mention AD waived his fucking trade kicker for him.  Edit 2: They intentionally wanted all the meetings with the Lakers, Clippers and Toronto to be private so they could avoid word getting out about the trade. You won’t convince me otherwise, this was grimey as fuck"
He was a trooper. Man played through injuries and the media didn't even care cause his name isn't Kevin Durant. 15'-16' Curry incoming.
"Warriors fans must be downvoting you for speaking against them.  I'm just going to put this here for people to read for themselves.  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2842705-andre-iguodala-says-warriors-listed-his-fractured-leg-as-a-bone-bruise-in-2018](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2842705-andre-iguodala-says-warriors-listed-his-fractured-leg-as-a-bone-bruise-in-2018)  If you don't want to click on the link:  *""Everyone is feeding stuff in our head, 'When KD [Kevin Durant] coming back?' ... Last year it happened to me. I missed the last three games of the Houston series. It goes to Game 7, we barely get out of that series. Now they're looking at me like, 'When are you coming back?' I had a fractured leg, but it's being put out there like, he's got a bone bruise. ... I'm fighting with the team, I'm fighting with people, I'm fighting with the media. Then my teammates ask me every day, 'How you feeling, how you feeling?'""*"
"It's not hard to hit on players drafted in the top 5. GM's SHOULD hit on those picks. But good GM's hit on later picks. Presti's draft history....  2018  Round 2 Pick 53: Devon Hall  Round 2 Pick 57: Kevin Hervey  Neither have shown anything so far.  2017   Round 1 Pick 21: Terrance Ferguson  He's shown flashes. But he's been poor for the most part. It's a wait and see.  2015  Round 1 Pick 14: Cameron Payne  Round 2 Pick 48: Dakari Johnson  Payne is on the verge of being out of the league. Johnson is out of the league.  2014  Round 1 Pick 24: Mitch McGary Round 1 Pick 29: Josh Huestis   Both out of the league.  2013  Round 1 Pick 12: Steven Adams  Round 1 Pick 26: Andre Roberson  Round 2 Pick 32: Alex Abrines   The rare good draft. Likely a blind squirrel and nut thing.  2012   Round 1 Pick 28: Perry Jones III  Out of the league.  2011  Round 1 Pick 24: Reggie Jackson  In the league but horrible.  2010  Round 1 Pick 11: Cole Aldrich Round 2 Pick 51: Magnum Rolle  Both out of the league. Also....Drafted Eric Bledsoe at 18 and traded him away. Yikes.  2009  Round 1 Pick 3: James Harden Round 1 Pick 24: Byron Mullens  Harden wasn't hard to hit. Mullens... running theme with Presti picks... out of the league.  2008  Round 1 Pick 4: Russell Westbrook  Round 1 Pick 24: Serge Ibaka Round 2 Pick 50: Devon Hardin Round 2 Pick 56: Sasha Kaun  Again Westbrook wasn't a tough one to get a hit with. I'll give credit for Ibaka. Hardin and Kaun out of the league.  2007  Round 1 Pick 2: Kevin Durant  Not tough to hit.    So, yeah he hit 3 MVP's with his picks. But those choices weren't hard to make. His drafting as a whole has been ATROCIOUS. He's had like two good drafts in twelve years where he's actually hit on later picks (2008 and 2013). He hasn't one good draft in 6 years. He can't even find solid rotational players. The majority of his picks end up out of the league."
"Kevin Durant is the biggest overpay considering you will be getting zero games from him next season, and he is getting a max contract.  That is the definition of the greatest level of overpay"
Circus shot = Jamal Crawford     Graceful = Kevin Durant     Entertainer = Steph Curry     Lay up Artist = Kyrie Irving     Intangibles = Draymond Green     Deflections = Kyle Lowry     Fastbreak = LeBron James     Behind the back = Steph Curry     Floater = Mike Conley     Alley-oop = DeAndre Jordam     Rainbow shot = J Crossover     Pump Fake = Dwyane Wade     Reverse dunk = Kobe Bryant
“My calf is 100% healed”— Kevin Durant.
"Yo if Kyrie can win a chip without Kevin Durant, that's pretty big."
"Theoretically. That's why the 2nd veteran supermax (the 35% one) is sometimes called the ""Durant Rule"" supermax as opposed to the Rose Rule nonveteran max, because they thought one of the reasons Kevin Durant went from OKC to GSW was both teams were able to offer the exact same max contract. So they put in this new veteran designated player supermax to try to keep players with their original teams.  I think it has overall backfired though. You have players like Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard who both declined the supermax and forced their way out of the Pelicans and Spurs. These top 5 players would rather form superteams in big markets like LA and make up for the lost money with endorsements.  Then you have smaller market teams who do give the supermax, like Washington with John Wall, except he isn't a top 5 player, and now that contract is so big it hamstrings their entire cap situation. Even Russell Westbrook is considered one such player since OKC may well trade him just to rid themselves of his huge supermax contract.  As a result, some teams have chosen to not offer the supermax to their own players because they are scared of being saddled with such a big contract. That's what happend with Kemba Walker this summer, with the Hornets lowballing him and essentially forcing him to walk.  The only notable player to have signed a supermax recently were Blake Griffin and Damian Lillard. Blake got traded soon after. Lillard most likely will not get traded."
"Still would've been more tolerable than what the Warriors did because we have no idea how good AD-old LeBron + supporting cast will be, while with the Warriors, they were essentially swapping out Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant on a 73-9 team."
"Dirk Nowitzki was never the player that Kevin Durant is.  Great player and a HoFer, but not on KD's level"
"I am a bit concerned about Davis, but given his trade demand and the way a bunch of the stars have acted with the exception of Klay Thompson, Isaiah Thomas, and Kevin Durant....   Dudes are way way more protective of their future now.   I could see Davis playing a lot less fragile and through more now that he's with an org that gave a 34-year-old Kobe with 1 achilles the largest contract in the league.   It's fucked up, but it ads a bit to the differences between big and small franchises. When the Lakers had NOBODY our games were still sold out and our waiting list for $30,000 season ticket pages dropped from 25,000 to 22,000.   Only 3,000 people said, ""ya know this team is garbage and will be for a while, I don't wanna spend $30k a year for these two seats"".   And that's over the course of a few years, there's been a bit of churn, but now the waitlist is crazy again.   These aren't exact numbers, just the general info I got from a few people I know ""in line"" and someone who's had season tickets for years now."
"Both Kawhi and PG’s bodies are falling apart, WHICH IS WHY KAWHI TRIED TO RECRUIT KEVIN DURANT WITH A HALF AMPUTATED LEG FIRST."

Picture Kevin Durant with less shooting but more post moves
Can someone please photoshop Kevin Durant with a bowl cut?
"Durant never player many of those key pieces that contributed to 73-9 record. And considering Warriors blew a 3-1 against a Cavs team WITH Kyrie and Kevin Love, they definitely needed Durant to overcome them."
Kevin Durant is the real reason
"You know what they don't get, though? Rings in my personal record book. They have fewer rings than Kevin Durant! How about that??"
This is still so stupid. He also made comments about free agent Kevin Durant and wasn't fined a cent. Just goes to show the league only fined us because of the outcry from Toronto.
"The three year stretch started this season.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/9/2/17811506/lakers-rumors-luol-deng-buyout-kevin-durant-salary-cap-free-agency  Also, you can use a cap site to see that it's 3 more seasons.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/cap/"
"Not necessarily - Iguodala was the only person who could possibly slow LBJ down enough to defeat him in 2015, and got rewarded with a FMVP.  After that, losing FMVPs to Kevin Durant in his prime ain't nothing to be ashamed about.    From one perspective, losing FMVPs to his teammates helps illustrate the lesser-acknowledged skills of BBIQ, court awareness, passing, etc. that all combine to make his teammates better.  Part of the reason Steph won those titles is how well he elevates the game of the guys playing with him.   Combine that with some amazing teammates and it's no surprise he doesn't have any yet."

Blame James Dolan who did even offer Kevin Durant a max contract they offered him less money than the Nets.
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
Did Kerr ever clarify if they knew the risk?  Last I heard they supposedly were [unaware](https://sports.yahoo.com/steve-kerr-no-way-warriors-would-let-kevin-durant-play-knowing-achilles-at-risk-211827104.html) of the potential Achilles risk.
Pretty sure spotrac has had this since day 1. If that's what it takes to get Kevin freaking Durant I'll take it.
"From the NBA's perspective though, they are telling a player who's in the NBA finals (a Kawhi Leonard for example), that he has until until the end of the day game 7 occurred to really think about his decision. A guy like Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant had huge injuries occur in the last 2 games of the NBA finals would barely have any time to think about how the injury would affect their FA decision. Meanwhile there's a guy who didn't even make the playoffs has a lot of extra time to think. It would not be an even playing field. Not from the teams perspective either, Raptors too busy trying to win the championship compared to another team.  Now we know these teams/players are still going to talk to each other during the playoffs regardless. But is the NBA supposed not even try and make it even? Its kind of a lose/lose situation whatever the NBA does."
"Dude yall got swept by Steph, Dray, and Klay  We won a few games against the Dubs this year when Kevin fucking Durant was dropping 30-40 pieces on us  Hou vs Por would have ended in 5 games with yall winning 1 at home"
He really does get offended so easily. It’s insane to me. He hasn’t figured out by now that free agency is a big deal and people speculate? ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE KEVIN DURANT. Smh
So they basically got him for 2 years if he leaves. Still worth it because you know who he is.. He is Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is Benedict Arnold
Kevin Durant could dramatically alter the Brooklyn Nets franchise for the better  You should be happy a talent he chose the Nets.
Lmaoo age well he ain’t no Kevin Durant
"Kevin, how nice of you to join us. Speaking of stat-padding, would you like to address this?  [Here's an instance of KD when he was with OKC and why he didn't want to take half or full-court heaves.](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html?y20=1)  A quote from this from Kevin on the heaves:  &gt;“It depends on what I’m shooting from the field. First quarter if I’m 4-for-4, I let it go. Third quarter if I’m like 10-for-16, or 10-for-17, I might let it go. But if I’m like 8-for-19, I’m going to go ahead and dribble one more second and let that buzzer go off and then throw it up there. So it depends on how the game’s going.”"
"Kevin Durant:  **""I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am"".**  Also Kevin Durant: **""You don't know me like that.""**"
"Um excuse me, you’re leaving a very important detail here: Kevin fucking Durant. You know, a top 20 player all time and the most versatile scorer the game has ever seen. If you think a 30 year old Jimmy Butler is even remotely as good as that player, then you’re the one who doesn’t know shit about the NBA. Hell, 2018/19 Paul George is a better player than Butler, and even then Russ got bounced in the first round in embarrassing fashion.   Also, you’re conveniently ignoring the fact that Russ has declined quite a bit since his MVP year, and the trajectory shows he’s gonna be even worse next year than he was this year."
Aw he's gonna pull a Kevin Durant haha
"First of all, [no one is remotely close to having a career average of 40 PPG in the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career_p.html). MJ leads that category with 33.4 PPG. LeBron currently sits at 5th all time with 28.9... just behind Kevin Durant. So even by that metric, LeBron is an all time great scorer in the playoffs."
"First of all, you brought up Kawhi winning the FMVP again this year, no one claimed that and you took it upon yourself to argue against it.  Kevin Durant would argue that you can indeed get back-to-back Finals MVP's. The key is to be the best player on a championship contender."
"Is that true with D'Lo? He had an 8m cap hold and they had 23m under the cap. Somebody else explained it better.  &gt; The Nets will first exhaust all $68.8M of their cap room by signing their free agents and draft picks. They’ll sign D’Angelo Russell, DeAndre Jordan, Nicolas Claxton, and, finally, Kyrie Irving (who will need to take a small discount from his $32.7M max – as little as $420K).  &gt; Think about what just happened… The Nets need $70.0M cap room just to sign Durant ($38.2M) and Irving ($32.7M), let alone add Jordan ($9.3M). They can only create $68.8M, by waiving Napier and Graham (NGs). Instead, they’ll keep Napier, Graham and Russell to exhaust cap room.  &gt; The Nets will then guarantee $3.2M of the combined $3.5M salaries of Shabazz Napier and Treveon Graham, so they’ll count as outgoing salary in trade. They’ll then combine Napier, Graham and D’Angelo Russell to trade-match for… Kevin Durant (who could get his full $38.2M max).  &gt; The Nets will end it all $8.3M over the salary cap – having artificially created $9.2M in cap room by exceeding the salary cap to trade-match for Kevin Durant, rather than sign him outright. And they’ll give that extra money to… DeAndre Jordan!  So at least that example is incorrect, I'm not really interested in the other ones but I think LeBron to Miami was a similar situation. In order to fit Bosh and other roleplayers it had to be a S&amp;T for them to make space with the cap."
"&gt; And surprisingly, there's about a 50-50 chance that LeBron finishes his career with MORE 3-pointers made than Kevin Durant. At the end of this year, he'll have about 400 more than KD.  Uh, there's about a 50/50 chance KD ever returns to being the player he was."
Kevin Durant
"If you’re not factoring in the murky future prognosis , then Kevin Durant is # 1."
"The most incredible record will be his Total Points in Playoffs. He is already leading this category with 6911, second is MJ with 5987. Highest active players after him are Kevin Durant with 4043 and Steph Curry with 2968. If people complain about his legacy, just point to that category and you know what caliber of a player this man was and is. And I don't want to imagine how much this stat blows, when the Lakers do a few more deep runs in the Playoffs."
&gt;Man basketball fans are weird as fuck  says the fan of a team with both kevin durant and kyrie irving
"Happens every year. Same with the Warriors. If it wasn't because of Bob Myers' unexpected zing at Kevin Durant, the media wouldn't even talk about the parade."
"Kobe Bryant   Tim Duncan  Steve Nash  Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson   Dwyane Wade  Dirk Nowitzki  LeBron James  Jason Kidd  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  James Harden  Russell Westbrook  Might be missing some obvious players but I don’t think anyone else is on the level of these guys. You could argue for Dwight, Allen, Paul, Gasol etc."
"I mean, just from the age demographics of Reddit alone, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who really knows Moses Malone and Moses Malone hasn't had mythology built around him like other players from the past as well.  As for Kevin Durant? Well, it'll be interesting to see what his legacy is 5-10 years after he retires.  What KD accomplishes with the Nets can be a big factor in his legacy as well.  To me, when you get included in ""legend"" status, and I'm talking *broad* NBA-wide legend status, you have to accomplish a number of things.  But these ""number of things"" is nebulous and the criteria changes and is different for every body.  It's like the old US Supreme Court ruling on pornography where one justice said he doesn't know how to *define* pornography but he will likely know it when he sees it.  And I think that's where ""legend"" status lies.  There aren't specific criteria for a Legend but you know it when you see it.  In this day and age, is KD a Legend?  Statistically, he is and will be. He has the counting stats, he has the chips, he has the Finals MVPs, etc.  But what is the brand around KD?  * Sensitive, has Twitter burner accounts, engaging something as silly as the masses on Twitter. * Joins the Warriors after getting beaten by the Warriors. * Draymond Green -- who isn't as good as KD but is probably more respected -- calls out KD, calls him soft, pretty much saying/confirming what we were all thinking. * KD -- possibly pressured by this narrative -- plays before he is ready and snaps his Achilles (which, in all fairness, was probably ready to snap in the first place) and then instead of *him* controlling the free agency narrative (in the way Kawhi did), he is kinda relegated to following Kryie to the Nets.  And with all that what is the KD brand?  I mean, if you present these facts to a casual NBA fan... at best you might call Kevin Durant a mercenary.  So it'll be interesting to see how KD's legacy shapes up after his career is over.  \---  Personally speaking?  I love the era of player empowerment. I love the idea that players can move around where they want to. Build super teams and all that.  But I hope that these players recognize that there are costs to that freedom.  One of the biggest costs is the idea of Legacy.  And I think a lot of younger players forget that and they are persuaded to just move on to the next best spot where the grass is greener.  Paul George demanded a trade one year after he committed to OKC, with videos and all.  What does that do to the PG13 legacy?  I think for true Legend status, you have to bet on yourself and the market you were randomly drafted to. And that can result in legend status.  Let's be honest here, KD doesn't have the stature of LBJ or Shaq. Two players who bounced around a lot but for the most part is extremely well respected and beloved by much of the league.  Kobe, in spite of his trade demands and what not, still played for the Lakers his entire career. And makes his legacy even greater beyond the championships and records that he set.  Again, I don't think KD has that near universal status because of the way he has approached his career.  He'll be a Hall Of Famer but will he be beloved? I don't know."
Python: Kevin Durant
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2840732-report-warriors-planned-to-offer-kevin-durant-contract-with-outs-at-any-point  Likely just rumors, but a I saw it pop up a few places. Not sure if it was all coming from one guy"
"Kevin Durant extremely upset in the hallway, slams the wall heading into the podcast studio. Someone with the San Francisco Chronicle yells, ""Kev come on, quit being a f---ing p---y!"" [It] was Connor Letourneau."
"Yes, it's true that most players aren't what they were before the the injury. I think it's fair to say that 100% are affected at varying degrees. However, if you are a team, you take the chance that one of the top 2 players of the last few years comes back at a near-elite level. If he doesn't, you struck out. It happens. You can recover somewhat by trading, or you can stick it out and live with the consequences. Almost any team is going to take that chance on a Kevin Durant caliber player recovering most of his athleticism and abilities."
"maybe for Knicks fans but he was never ""clearly"" top 5 even in 2013. you had Lebron, KD, Duncan, and CP3 who were hands down better. [Gasol, Harden, Curry, Love are all up there too] (https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;player_id1_select=Carmelo+Anthony&amp;player_id1=anthoca01&amp;y1=2014&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2014&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id3_hint=LeBron+James&amp;player_id3_select=LeBron+James&amp;y3=2014&amp;player_id3=jamesle01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id4_hint=Kevin+Love&amp;player_id4_select=Kevin+Love&amp;y4=2014&amp;player_id4=loveke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id5_hint=Stephen+Curry&amp;player_id5_select=Stephen+Curry&amp;y5=2014&amp;player_id5=curryst01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id6_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id6_select=James+Harden&amp;y6=2014&amp;player_id6=hardeja01&amp;idx=players)"
Kevin Durant is just a Shaun Livingston that didn’t suffer a gruesome injury.  Don’t @ me.
"Damned if he did, damned if he didn't. If he would have stayed out until fully recovered the narrative put out by the team  would have been that he is not a team player. But rushing back in an effort to help the team he reinjured himself, as did Kevin Durant and Kevin Looney, and as a result he is suffering financially. I admire Kawhi for putting his health and longivity first."
teams facing the Nets and Kevin Durant will have way more than one challenge per game. He’s unguardable and can pull up from 30!
"Quinn Cook, Victor Oladipo, Kevin Durant, Jeff Green, Rudy Gay, Carmelo Anthony, Markelle Fultz, Ed Davis, Jerami Grant, Josh Hart,"
What if NBA impersonators get popular like Elvis and Michael Jackson impersonators? Imagine going to Vegas and seeing a little half court set up with a Kevin Durant impersonator just doing some hezzy pull up jimbos and lanking around
Kevin Durant
"oh I get the Russ hype, I watched a lot of his games / highlights during his MVP tear. Him and Kevin Durant were actually my first favorite super stars when I got really into the NBA in high school.  I always watched games growing up bc my dad and mom are big sports fans (I have one of the 1976-77 commemorative mugs from the blazers chip from when my granpda and mom watched it) but it wasn’t until high school when I started playing 2k13 and watching a lot of NBA games that I really knew every team’s main players and the general climate of the NBA and wasn’t just a casual fan.   Obviously Dame and CJ are my favorite players now, but guys like KD, Lebron &amp; Russ are the reason I fell in love with the sport. I like to watch and keep up with pretty much every team tho, there isn’t a single current NBA player I’d say I hate or dislike besides a competitive &amp; good-natured hatred for Jokic lol."
"He was playing on a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant in the lineup. Teams basically didn't guard him.  Maybe the advanced stats tell a different story, but from the games I watched, Boogie looked terrible when he had to shoulder more of the offensive burden. For example, he usually started the second quarter with both Curry and Durant out of the lineup. When he actually got defended like a star player would usually be, he struggled.  Again, that's from me just watching the games. Maybe someone will tell me that actually, his net rating was great without Curry and Durant. If that were true, I'd be shocked.  He's a decent shooter and a good rebounder. If you don't guard him, he can score you some points. If his leg is ok, he's worth more than a minimum contract. However, I'd be careful handing out much more to him until he proves himself over the course of a season. Even then, I just don't see him being close to a max guy at this point in his career, especially with how the game has changed over the past 3 or 4 seasons."
This is why KEVIN WAYNE DURANT is the GOAT. You can’t spell OKC with KD BABYYY
Or maybe Kevin Durant *is* the beat writer.
"""It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Kyrie. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'What does government mean to you?', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
That player is Kevin Durant

I was doing a series of sweet ba..  Dennis: Do *not* claim to be doing backflips..  MAC: Backflips for a project badass video! KD saw how badass I was...  Dee: Charlie did you film this?  Charlie: I err.. ahhh...  MAC: Charlie didn't film *shit*! He was busy eating the sidewalk chalk that the kids were going to use to play hopscotch!  Charlie: No.. no see.. that was.. I was just making sure it wasn't toxic.. so that if the kids ate it.. you know..  Dee: And why would kids be eating chalk?  Frank: Don't get all high and mighty Deandra. Back in my sweatshop days.. we used to use chalk for everything. Makeup... outlining dead bodies... we even used it for seasoning in the soup!  Dennis: Jesus Christ Frank... can you not go thirty seconds without revealing what an utter revolting mass of degradation you are?  Frank: ...I wonder how much chalk is in that concealer you're wearing to hide your age?  Dennis: Alright alright *alright*! We are getting totally off-base. As always! The point of this is that there is no way on God's green Earth that Mac pulled off even a single backflip!  MAC: *Series* of backflips...  Dennis: Or that he could go one on one with a man of KDs stature. A man who can rain down points like the wrath of Titan's winds!  Dee: Yeah... a man who can fly like a... \[awkward pause\]  Dennis: ...like a.. bird?  Dee: ...that wasn't...  MAC: I feel like she was going to say bird!  Dee: No. No!  Frank: Like a flightless... titless... talentless bird!  Dennis: With no ass!  Dee: I hate all of you rotten bastards...
"He's had shit coaches, watched Kevin Durant and James Harden walk, recruited Paul George to stay an extra year out of nowhere and took the blame for the team's demise in the play-offs when in reality, he was attempting to carry a damaged Paul George across the finish line.   Russ 100% going to get the treatment he actually deserves when he retires and I cannot wait for analysts to eat crow."
[Kevin Durant is an emotional lesbian](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m9zdn6E3KbE)
Kevin Durant is a giant ass weenie Dude is crazy sensitive and you would think having a momma that looks like harambe he would be able to take a joke
Legit dumbest take I’ve seen today. NBA champions Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving get wayyy more than the valid criticisms Westbrook gets
"Should I go back to his entire career with Harden, Durant and even Kevin Martin? When he had shooters and still shot below league average? Is that enough of a sample size. The fact that he has two seasons in his entire career that are at least league average at the rest below it?  Yeah that must not be a big enough sample size."
"Maybe they can draft Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden again"
LeBron has to play people like Kevin Durant. Jordan had to play Bryant Reeves
"Kevin Durant is that one friend who your mom always talks about even though you aren't friends anymore, but she likes them more than you"
&gt; Russell has yet to win an away playoff since Kevin Durant led the team  Russell? Are you his mother?
"Kevin Durant is not normal, any way you slice it. He can do whatever he wants. What are the Nets gonna do, say “nevermind, we don’t want you because you announced it without telling us”?"
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant
"I can sympathize with the owners. Players like Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, and Marcus Morris are becoming way too powerful.   &amp;#x200B;  Oh wait, the owners are even more shady and unprofessional."
"You know Kevin Durant is such an amazing player, that I could believe he’d announce he’s going to a team without even speaking to them. Like if he said I’m going to the Charlotte Hornets randomly, it’s not like they’d object. They’d pull up a contract immediately"
"I also made a stink when they left. You just got Kevin Durant and you're guna move to buttfuck nowhere Oklahoma? OKC fans seem great, but its ridiculous that there's a team in Portland and not Seattle. There's a reason there are no other franchises in Oklahoma!   &amp;#x200B;  I appreciate your humility tho. I suppose nephews come in all ages and sizes, but I feel like a true nephew would never admit to being one. Its a very malleable term that I find myself wanting to use in other subs and real life.  &amp;#x200B;  PS - Kemp + Payton &gt; Lewis + Allen &gt; KD + Russ"
"It’s an awful metric but It has nothing to do with my expectations. It’s more to do with that fact that they’re using a large pool of data that seems quite thorough bit is actually very limited and then using it as a blanket to grade players on.  Nowhere does it mention the types of shots that are being defended or create a modifier for difficulty of shot. Are you defending a layup attempt at the rim or a fadeaway 3 with the shot clock winding down? But more importantly it doesn’t take into account who’s taking the shot. All they do is adjust slightly to account for better players during the playoffs, which is silly. Kevin Durant in the regular season is still harder to defend than Joe Ingles in the playoffs. For the most part Kawhi guards the opposing teams best player, Dunleavy does not. Kawhi’s man is often shooting of screens or on a play that is specifically designed for him to get a good shot, the same cannot be said for Dunleavy. For arguments sake If Dunleavy held Sefolosha for example to 20% shooting on 500 fall away 3’s that does not make him a better shot defender than Kawhi having Durant score 60% on 500 layup attempts."
Westbrook gets way too much blame. Kevin Durant was just as responsible for them never winning a ring.
wording is hella confusing but no Paul George is not as good as prime Kevin Durant
No. He's not even on the level of current Kevin Durant.
Kevin “Boston Bomber” Durant
Friendliest calves? Probably Kevin Durant
"Fun list! Rooting for all the guys you mentioned except maybe Isiah Thomas, gotten kind of tired of his attitude. Anyway here is my list:  1: Kevin Durant: Just fucking with you lol  Actual 1. Dame Lillard:  Loyal. Stone cold killer. Plays beatiful basketball. Dope rapper. Would be a huge upset. How can you not love this guy?  2. Russell Westbrook: Obviously a lot of people won't agree with this one as it seems that you either love him or hate him. But with the way he leaves everything on the court I would love to see him win, think he would go crazy celebrating as well!  3. Vince Carter: Greatest dunker of all time. Old as fuck but can still contribute at a high level and hasn't ring chased but chosen to mentor young talent instead. Think he has earned it.   4. Kemba Walker: Been stuck on a shitty Charlotte team all of his career. Very entertaining style of play. Loyal and actually would have stayed with Charlotte if they paid him. Just seems like a great guy.   5. Mike Conley  Agree with you seems like a great teammate and guy. Somehow hasn't made an all star team despite performing at a really high level for years. Got love for all the former members of the grit n grind Grizzlies."

Former NBA players Kenyon Martin, Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes are just some who have said their trips to Utah during their playing days featured racial epithets. Golden State star Kevin Durant has noticed how the at-times crazed atmosphere will cause Jazz fans to toss off any limits on what they direct toward the opposing team.  &gt;“I said it b4 @utahjazz have the most racist fans in the @NBA,” Barnes, a longtime Jazz nemesis tweeted."
Good lord. The nephew revisionist history with people acting like the Kevin Durant era warriors were a beatable team just because they lost a single series when Kevin Durant didn’t even play.
Probably Kevin Durant
No I’m not Kevin Durant would never do that
"Seattle/OKC has been a franchise since 1968, and never had that top pick.   They have had the number 2 pick twice.   They got Gary Payton and Kevin Durant with those two picks."
Don't put time tables on injuries just let players come back when they are ready. See Kevin Durant this playoffs
"JFC no its not a double standard, teams with no stars and losing records make the playoffs in the East.   And if Adams is trash but is OKC’s fourth best player on the floor, how can you blame Westbrook for not getting an upset? And when PG is hurt? And when the third best player is now a backup in Denver? Raymond Felton should be playing ZERO minutes for any playoff team and probably shouldn’t be in the NBA. Seeding is not irrelevant because that determines the level of team is he playing against when these are the pieces he has to win with. All while he apparently is solely taking on the blame when he loses to better teams whose fourth and fifth best players would be the second option for Westbrook in that series.  This entire damn thread shows how he makes his teammates better. PG just had the best season of his career with Westbrook and KD had his MVP season with him too. Westbrook isn’t the GM and you can’t turn all the garbage into a contender but the stats show they do improve when they play with. Thats why I made the LBJ comparison you can’t seem to comprehend, because Cleveland had no chance vs GS no matter how perfect LeBron played, but he gets a pass because he won when he was paired with Allstars? He left Cleveland twice over this same problem but Westbrook needs to be held accountable?   Seriously, PG was hurt this year and got shut down by Joe fuckin Ingles last year and the rest of the roster wouldn’t play for any other playoff team in the West, and thats Westbrook’s fault? Are you serious right now? KD even said in his burner accident “He couldn’t win with those cats” and he specifically said Westbrook was the only reason they could compete, but all blame should go on the one guy who continuously puts them in this position? Alex Abrines was the starting sg for them and didn’t even finish the season and is now out of the NBA, but Westbrook should still upset a 53 win team or else he isn’t “great”?  Kevin “I’m Kevin Durant” Durant could see it and peaced out, PG could see it and peaced out and has been pro-Westbrook for multiple seasons now, but its all Westbrook’s blame they don’t upset four teams who were top 5 in the entire league over four years.   I’m fascinated by your expectations and explanations at this point in terms of what it takes for an NBA team to achieve playoff success over others."

"I dont see how he is more athletic than kevin durant, lebron james, anthony davis, giannis? Being tall doesnt make you an athlete lol. I dont see how wilt is a better athlete than any of the above. He was just taller so basketball was easier, doesnt make him a better athlete."
Kevin “The Kevin” Durant
"Kevin ""KD"" Durant"
"He has not declined, he’s been playing next to Kevin fucking Durant. I’m not even a Curry fan, but come on man lol."
"I love the fact they didn't cave and offer Kevin ""won't play in 2019/20"" Durant to a max contract. It didn't work out so fuck it. Low committal contracts with teams options while letting Knox, Mitch, RJ, and Randle all have fun together and learn from vets like Taj, Morris, Bullock etc  But people are too occupied on lolknicks to pay attention that Scott Perry has been doing great ever since he traded Melo.   BTW I hope Lebron and AD fuck shit up this year. They will be fun to watch"
And this stupid take is exactly why Kevin Durant joined the Warriors
https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/report-kevin-durant-felt-disrespected-202527542.html
"Can someon explain to me why Presti is being touted as a genius executive?  This guy traded away Harden for nothing, had Kevin Durant walk from this team, and traded away Oladipo for a year of Paul George.  Having a bunch of picks is great but those picks mean nothing until you either (1) trade them for a star or (2) draft a star.  If I were rebuilding I would much rather be the New Orleans Pelicans right now (even without Zion) because having good promising young players is better than having just a bunch of draft picks.    I suppose he deserves credit for transitioning into a rebuild fast and efficiently, but couldn't you also argue that he should have done so sooner?  This OKC team hasn't come close to sniffing a title since Durant left."
Nah you can hang it next to your Kevin Durant Knicks jersey
Then there's Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant takes pride in a modest usage rate. He’s said on Simmons’ pod that he would rather consistently hit 30 on high efficiency rather than bust out for 60 one night.
Ya actually Kevin Durant has a torn fucking Achilles and he's not worth dick.
"No, because Kawhi is injury prone and PG is a 2nd tier star, which is why Kawhi tried to recruit Kevin Durant (despite a half-amputated leg) first."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant and Harden are awful shooters. They're only both top 10 or so in league history."
"&gt;I’m not sure why you’re assuming he’s gonna be even close to the player he was after a catastrophic injury like that nearly no player comes back from well.   You should take a deep breath instead, and realize the fact that the A team in New York now are the Brooklyn Nets. Imagine that  &gt;  KD doesn't even need to be 100% for the Nets to make the Finals, you do know that right? LeBron and KD are on another level, and has been for over a decade. Best and 2nd best player in the world.   &gt;  KD is 7 foot tall monster who can shoot from anywhere, score from anywhere, and got handles. He's a 4 time scoring champion, 2 time NBA Champion and Finals MVP  &gt;  Do you actually think he needs to be at his 100% to steam roll through the EAST? There's no LeBron in the East anymore and even Kawhi is gone already. Who's actually going to stop even a ""70% of his former self"" Kevin Durant? Giannis? Ben Simmons? Teams don't even guard them from the perimeter, and they both have their achilles intact lol KD in a wheel chair would be a 100x bigger threat than any one of those players, in a 7 game playoff series.   &gt;  Durant doesn't need to come back as literally the same. There's no one in the East on his level, regardless. And, the Nets got Kyrie Irving as well. Yeh, he might think the Earth is flat and he might be a very sketchy dude, but everyone knows what he's really capable of on the court, if he really sets his mind to it. No one can forget the 2016 Finals. He's also just 27  &gt;   KD's post injury status will definitely be a risk, but a franchise that has been a laughing stock for 20+ years, you actually think KD wouldn't have been worth it? LOL come on nephew  &gt;  That's sad. Well, enjoy the lottery again, again, and then again. Maybe 30+ years of irrelevancy will be the charm"
"$160m is a lot of money. It's also not an adequate compensation for the kind of value Lebron James or Kevin Durant bring to their teams. They could sign for the supermax, which is like $46m a year and it would still make them underpaid.   It's not about whether it's a lot of money in a vacuum, it's about whether they are compensated fairly. And they are clearly not."
"[On June 7, 2007, Presti was hired as the general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics, who later relocated and became the Oklahoma City Thunder.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Presti)  [June 28, 2007: Selected Kevin Durant (1st round, 2nd pick), Carl Landry (2nd round, 31st pick) and Glen Davis (2nd round, 35th pick) in the 2007 NBA Draft.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/executives/prestsa99x.html)"
"Yes. He was.   http://www.nba.com/article/kevin-durant-free-agency-2019  The Brooklyn Nets have acquired forward Kevin Durant, along with a protected 2020 first round draft pick, from the Golden State Warriors in exchange for guards D’Angelo Russell and Shabazz Napier and forward Treveon Graham."
He would do that shit even when Kevin fucking Durant was on his team.
"And the constant dick sucking of Sam Presti continues.  Had Durant, Westbrook and Harden, without shit to show for it.  Was the George trade good? Yeah. But let's not forget the constant failure of this franchise, who left Seattle to go to OKC, and had 3 of the best talents of this generation - losing one in FA, trading one for Kevin fucking Martin, and then trading the final one for old CP3."
It's really a shame that Ewing didn't get a title. I just saw some highlight reel from him and totally forgot how great he was. He had a fantastic mid-range jumper that made him look like a slower but more powerful Kevin Durant.
"I'll wear it next to you with my Celtics jersey that's Tim Duncan on one half, Kevin Durant on the other."
You’re the one posting an article that puts acquiring Jerami Grant as one of the top acquisitions when the following players have left their teams:  Kawhi Leonard  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Paul George   CP3  Al Horford   Danilo Galanari   Rajon Rondo   Julis Randle   Taj Gibson  Bobby Portis  Willy Culley- Stein   Bojan   Josh Jackson  Derrick Favors   Must I go on?
Kevin Durant on Amare’s comment:  &gt;	he’s a idiot
Enjoy [this shit](https://giphy.com/gifs/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-oklahoma-thunder-12OYYarAi8vi8)
"Thunder fans will downvote you but this is partially true. The Thunder for many years had an absolutely transcendental offensive talent in Kevin Durant, and an MVP calibre player in a younger Russell Westbrook- yet only managed to have the league’s best offense one year. When teams have two players with the ability to win an MVP any given year of their prime, and only manage to have a league leading offense once, Something is up.   Why? Westbrook isn’t actually as good offensively as the box score stats suggest, Doesn’t really move off-ball, Was a streaky shooter but has devolved into a horrendous one, and despite being one of the better passers in the league he is prone to holding the ball till late shot clock and only then passing it for a below average shot.   He simply isn’t a winning player, and while the sub is currently going through a bit of a “Westbrook is actually all-NBA calibre” moment right now, I think after he shoots the Rockets out of a few winnable playoff games en route to a first round loss people will finally be able to tell it’s not just an OKC thing."
Kevin Durant about to make amends with Westbrook and form a big 3.
"2013, injury- Russell Westbrook, knee. 2014, Ibaka was injured for the last two games against the Spurs else that series goes to 7 in all-time memorable matchup. 2015, injury- Kevin Durant, foot.  That roster is as big of an injury what-if as Portland had in 2010 rolling out a starting lineup of Oden, Roy, Aldridge, Blake, and Miller."
"Let me help you out, my fellow Knicks fan nephew.  All the way back in 2012-13 our Knicks were actually good. Like, really good. The NBA was also a lot different than it is now, as you'll see in this way too long post. There were some teams that shot a lot of 3 pointers but it was nothing like it is today.  Here is the list of the all-time team leaders in 3PM in a season.  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tsl\_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=team\_totals&amp;lg\_id=NBA&amp;c1stat=fg3&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;order\_by=fg3](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tsl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=team_totals&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;c1stat=fg3&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;order_by=fg3)  The 2012-13 Knicks come in at 37th with 891. That may not seem all that impressive now, but yes at the time it was the all-time record. The Rockets were also sniping that season, see them at 49th with 867, thanks to trading for James Harden and having two elite 3P shooters on the same roster in him and Carlos Delfino. Delfino's 2.4 3PM were tied for 6th in the NBA, Harden's 2.3 3PM were tied for 7th in the NBA. Who was Harden tied with? Carmelo Anthony.  Both the Knicks and the Rockets broke the previous all-time 3PM record that season, which was held by the Orlando Magic in 2009-10 (spot them at 57th). This record held for just two years though, when Houston (25th) and Golden State (41st) both broke it in 2014-15 and it has obviously been broken many times since.  While it has since been crushed by the wave of 3s, it was a pretty big deal at the time for our Knicks. Fitting, as we haven't been relevant since.  I did make a mistake with the Heat though. They did break a 3 point record but it wasn't the volume one. They broke the record for having the most qualified 40% 3PT shooters in a season, and in that same 2012-13 season. Battier hit 1.9 at .430, Allen 1.8 at .419, Chalmers 1.6 at .409, LeBron 1.4 at .406, Mike Miller 1.2 at .416 and just for good measure Rashard Lewis 0.9 at .389. To say that defending that trio with those kind of snipers around them was unfair is putting it lightly.  I'm not sure if the Miami record still holds, as it's way too annoying to check, but if anyone knows I would appreciate the knowledge.  The point of mentioning those others teams is that they had a lot more talent than those Knicks - aka Melo had a lot less help. There was no one to really create open looks for Melo those years, let alone for others.  They ran dual PG lineups to help with the passing, but when those PGs are Raymond Felton and ancient Jason Kidd/36-year old rookie Pablo Prigioni who had to take over when Kidd entered the spirit realm mid-season, then you're not really getting shots created so much as you're just executing sets. All eyes were on Melo at all times cause the only other legit scoring threat on the entire team was JR Smith and you could gladly live with his erratic play and shooting.  This is why the team had to rely so heavily on ISO play and the insane gravity Melo was drawing from the post. That plus having smart secondary passers who made the extra kick in Kidd/Prigioni is the reason they broke the 3P record. It allowed guys like Steve Novak and Chris Copeland to play at a level they never sniffed after leaving NY, thanks to the wide open 3s they lived off of, and JR to be at his absolute best thanks to the ""better you than Melo"" approach by defenses. Melo still led the league in scoring, of course.  The Knicks had the 3rd most efficient offense that season, after OKC (Durant, Westbrook, Kevin Martin and Ibaka) and Miami (as mentioned). The 4th most efficient offense was the Clippers (Paul, Blake, Crawford, Caron Butler, Eric Bledsoe). When you look at the talent of those 4 teams next to each other and how badly the Knicks stick out it's really insane lol.  Back to the volume of 3PM on the record compared to today, the league was also way slower back then. The Knicks were actually one of the slowest paced teams even then, ranking 26th in pace, but those 4 teams ranged from 89.8 (Knicks) to 93.3 (Thunder) while the league average was 92.0. The Rockets had the fastest pace at 96.1.  This past season the *slowest* team had a pace of 96.6, the fastest at 103.9 and the league average was 100.0.  So you have to take all those things into account when looking back at it. Melo didn't finish 3rd in MVP that year by accident. He was truly amazing and carried that team to a record it had no business achieving based on it's talent."
"The Thunder were up 3-2 on the Warriors and the Warriors summoned Game 6 Klay (who has since been summoned against the Rockets while down 3-2 and also against Toronto, but he was injured), and Klay balled out of his mind for 41 points and a playoff-record 11 three-pointers to force Game 7 where the Warriors went on to eliminate the Thunder from the playoffs.  Kevin Durant stays with the Thunder if they win that series or if the Warriors go on to win the Finals instead of lose, but the Warriors end up losing in the Finals after going up 3-1 on LeBron's Cavs and the rest is history."
wait the thunder had James harden and Kevin Durant with Westbrook? wow
Especially with a iso heavy guy like Kevin Durant in a heavy western conference.
Hard disagree.  No team that loses Kevin Durant is better off.  Not one.
"Little did the video creator know, that Kevin durant would be signing with the warriors a few weeks after this video was posted."
"Nor was it the first time a spur would win the scoring championship on a final day duel.  The iceman poured in 63 to overcome david Thompson's 73.    https://www.nba.com/history/top-moments/1978-scoring-title-gervin-thompson  http://www.espn.com/classic/s/moment010409-gervin-thompson.html  That one was also legendary. Thompson set the 3rd highest score and highest by a guard, along with a record 32 in a quarter, only to have it broken 7 hours later by the 33 in a quarter   We almost got another last game duel for scoring championship between two HoFers, but Kobe Bryant sat out the last game to make a point that it was about rings, letting KD win the title. It was an eminently gettable 38 points..  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-sits-out-kevin-durant-wins-nba-scoring-title/"
"   Westbrook and Harden were Thunder  teammates for three seasons, the last of those being the 2011-12  campaign when that duo and Kevin Durant took Oklahoma City to the NBA  Finals.   They lost in five games to  LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat, and Harden departed that  summer for Houston - where he's been an All-Star ever since."
"Westbrook had Kevin Durant, an MVP season and then Paul George  Even next year he'd still've had Aquaman on the team"
"also, I recommend watching players' highlights from previous years to understand how good these guys are.  Idk how long you've cursory followed the NBA, but for the Modern NBA age I'd begin reading season review from 2010 onwards. You seem pretty enthusiastic so, i'll try to give a synopsis of the past 8-9 years   In 2010 the Lakers and Celtics, greatest rivalry in the NBA, faced off in the NBA finals. The series went to the max 7 games, and the Lakers beat the Celtics for their second straight championship (back to back). Kobe Bryant won his 5th NBA championship and was named finals MVP (best player of the series). The Lakers and Celtics are the NBA's largest superpowers and two most historic/storied franchises.  However, that summer the entire NBA would change. The best player in the world, 2x reigning MVP, LeBron James decided to 'take his talents to South Beach' in an unprecedented power move via the televised event 'The Decision'. LeBron decided to form a team through free agency, teaming up with his great friend Dwyane Wade (3rd best player in the NBA) and fellow all-star Chris Bosh. The Heat were the most reviled team in the NBA, and were expected to waltz to a ring. However, in 2011 a young star emerged, Derrick Rose. Rose led the Chicago Bulls to the #1 seed in the eastern conference and won MVP. Nonetheless, LeBron choked in the 2011 finals, and Dirk Nowitzki led the Dallas Mavericks to surprise championship with an amazing NBA finals and playoff run.  In 2012 Miami looked like the dominant team again, obtaining the best record in the Eastern conference. LeBron James easily won his 3rd MVP, and Kevin Durant finished second. Additionally, in 2012 the OKC thunder finally emerged as a contender. They were led by 23 year old superstar Kevin Durant (KD), 23 year old all-star Russell Westbrook, and a future star James Harden. During the 1st round, Derrick Rose tore his acl vs the Philadelphia 76ers. The injury would set Rose back years and he was never the player he was before the injury. In the conference finals, the Heat faced elimination in game 6 away vs Boston. LeBron put on an all-time great performance to clinch victory and force a game 7, which the heat won. Conversely, OKC emerged as a young super team, beating the spurs in a close 6 game series. The heat would vanquish the thunder in 5 games in the NBA finals, with a blowout in game 5. LeBron would win his 1st ring and claim finals MVP.  In 2013, arguably the most consequential move in the modern nba occurred. During the off-season, the OKC Thunder traded young talent James Harden to the Rockets for picks. Also, the Lakers attempted to create a super team by adding Dwight Howard and Steve Nash to their team with Kobe. During the season, LeBron stamped his mark as the games best player. He won his 4th MVP, and had one of the most dominant seasons of all-time. The Heat won 27 straight games at one point. In the West, OKC and the Spurs were dominant forces. The Lakers had flopped as a super team, but Kobe's heroics had buoyed the Lakers to a playoff seed. Nonetheless, Kobe tore his achilles at the end of the season vs Golden State. In the playoffs, OKC's hopes were dashed during the 1st round. Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus on a controversial play, after he crashed into Patrick Beverly of the Houston Rockets. Westbrook would miss the rest of the playoffs and the Thunder lost to the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies were known for their grit-n-grind play, emphasizing slower offensive possesions and tough physical defense. As the Heat made their way through the east (they had a great ecf series with the pacers), the consistent San Antonio Spurs did the same in the West. The Spurs are one of the greatest dynasties in American sports. Helmed by the greatest coach ever, Greg Poppovich, and the legendary Tim Duncan, the Spurs never won less than 50 games from 1999 to 2013. The Spurs were a machine. In arguably the greatest NBA finals of all-time, the Spurs had a chance to clinch the title in game 6. Now old, Tim Duncan had turned back the clock in the first half with an amazing performance to give the Spurs a comfortable lead. During the 4th quarter, LeBron James went on the charge and took over the game. He willed the Heat back from their deficit. However, the Spurs were still up 4 with 37 sec left. In the ensuing drama (you must watch it) the Heat came back, and Ray Allen hit arguably the clutches shot ever to keep Miami's hopes alive. LeBron would then take over game 7 leading Miami to their 2nd straight title and his 2nd finals MVP. (I'm serious, Heat vs Spurs 2013 is one of the greatest NBA series ever)  In 2014, KD won his first MVP. With Westbrook hurt, KD carried the Thunder to the 2nd best record in the West. LeBron was still the NBA's best player, but the Heat's deep playoff runs were taking a toll and Wade had substantially declined over the past few years. The Spurs, however, were merciless in their pursuit of a 5th championship since 1999. The met the Heat for a rematch and played arguably the greatest basketball ever, destroying the Heat in games 3-5. Budding star Kawhi Leonard was named finals MVP.  In 2015, the NBA changed permanently and a new superstar left his indelible mark on the NBA. During the offseason, LeBron decided to go back home and return to Cleveland. He formed a superteam with young all-star Kyrie Irving and all-star Kevin Love. The cavs had arguably the greatest luck ever in the lottery, and had back to back #1 picks in the NBA draft. They traded Anthony Bennet (a bust) and Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, a 20 points and 10 rebs machine on the timberwolves. The Cavs would have an up and down season, with LeBron missing time due to a back injury. However, they would make the playoffs and led by the King, make the finals. In the West, a revolution occurred. The young talented Golden State Warriors hired Steve Kerr as head coach. Kerr transformed the Warriors and they emerged as the best team in the NBA (67 wins) during the regular season. Stephen Curry, Skyfucker, transformed the NBA into a simple math fact: 3&gt;2. He won MVP and made the most 3s ever in a season. His fellow splash brother Klay Thompson was an all-star and a new young combative defensive anchor Draymond Green anchored the warriors. They faced off against LeBron's cavs in the 2015 finals. Kevin Love was hurt against the celtics and missed the finals. Kyrie Irving injured himself during game 1 and was out for the series. Essentially, the series became LeBron vs the Warriors. LeBron did everything and led the Cavs to a 2-1 lead vs golden state. However, the firepower of golden state was too much and they beat the cavs in 6 games. Andre Iguodala, LeBron's primary defender, was controversially named finals MVP.  In 2016, the NBA season was all about the Warriors. Steph Curry took his 3pt shooting prowess to 5 levels higher and drained 400 3s. The Warriors won an NBA record 73 games including a legendary thriller vs OKC (watch this game). Also in the west, the Spurs still remained supreme. They won 67 games and were led by superstar Kawhi Leonard. The Thunder were finally fully healthy, as KD had finally recovered from a jones fracture injury that plagued him for 2 years. The Cavs marched to the finals in the East, led by King James and a much improved Irving and Love. In the West, the Thunder beat the spurs in a tight 6 game series (western conference semi finals). The moved on to face the warriors in the conference finals. During the wcf, the Thunder took a 3 game lead against the warriors. Draymond Green kicked Steven Adams in the balls a few time, but wasn't suspended. In game 5 the Warriors won at home. In game 6, the Thunder looked to finish the Warriors off. They held sizeable lead, but the Splash Brothers, especially Klay Thompson kept the Warriors in it. His 41 pts and 11 3pters along with Curry's  31 points finished off their comeback and forced a game 7. In game 7, Curry performed like an MVP and the Warriors overcame a 3-1 deficit to reach their second straight NBA finals. The Warriors were now attempting to finish the greatest NBA season of all-time. The 3-1 blown lead by the Thunder would become a huge storyline in the future. In the NBA finals (another must watch) the Cavs looked for revenge. However, the Warriors ran out to a 3-1 lead and all hope looked lost for Cleveland. During game 4, Draymond Green had slapped LeBron in the dick, and was suspended for an accumulation of flagrant foul points. He would miss game 5. In game 5, LeBron and Kyrie put up legendary performances, each scoring 41 points and answering everything the Warriors had. The series was now 3-2 heading back to cleveland. In game 6, the Cavs ran off to a massive lead. LeBron was running the show; scoring, assisting, rebounding, and playing fabulous defense. He scored 41 points again an added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. The series was heading back to Oracle Arena (gsw' home) for the pivotal game 7. Game 7 was a close game that came down to the last few min. It was a battle of attrition for two fatigued teams. With the game tied, the Warriors got a rebound and were quickly on the fastbreak. Curry threaded a pass to Iguodala, but LeBron came out of nowhere to block it. Then, Kyrie Irving hit a fade-away 3 to put the Cavs up by 3. Kevin Love then stopped Curry and forced him into an awful 3pter, which he missed. The Cavs ended clevelands curse, and won the 2016 finals. LeBron was named finals MVP. He led the NBA finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks; he's the only player to ever do so in an NBA finals. The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead, but their biggest prize was coming. After game 7, Draymond Green sat in the Oracle parking lot and made a phone call to one Kevin Durant, asking him to join the Warriors during free agency.  During 2016 free agency, the NBA had a new TV deal, so the salary cap increased substantially. In pursuit of the hardest road, KD joined GSW."
I mean he had Kevin Durant and James Harden on one team before.
"Mabey they can draft players like Kevin Durant, Harden, Westbrook and Ibaka."
"Or that Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook played on their team at the same time."
In the words of Kevin Durant “lets go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!”
"Regardless of how anyone feels about Kevin Durant, OP's question is dumb as fuck"
K is for Kevin Durant here in the the worst city
"You’re not getting it. Kevin Durant is the better basketball player, but Russ has been more meaningful and loyal to the franchise so he’s more beloved"
KD left because he wanted to win man. He had a better opportunity with the best regular season team in NBA history. Here's proof https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/russell-westbrook-wasnt-reason-kevin-durant-left-thunder-says-ex-teammate  Don't just make shit up to fit your narrative.  Who was KD playing with when he won his scoring titles? What about when he won his MVP? Who was Paul George playing with when he entered MVP contention for the first time? You're bending the facts to try and make an incorrect point.   Oladipo and Harden are terrible examples because they weren't fully developed stars when they left OKC. Harden was coming off the bench lmao of course he scored more when he left.
This is my favorite  https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/19/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant
"Now imagine if OKC uses those new picks to get someone as good as say Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Russell Westbrook?  A team would be lucky to get one of those guys with those picks.  Imagine how good they could be."
"comments like this piss me off. Here’s a full list of first round picks that Presti has drafted since he’s been a GM.   2007. Kevin Durant pick 2 2008. Russel Westbrook pick 4 2008. Serge Ibaka pick 24 2009. James Harden pick 3 2009. Rodrigue Beaubois pick 25 2010. Eric Bledsoe pick 18 2010. Craig Brackins pick 21 2010. Quincy Pondexter pick 26 2011. Reggie Jackson pick 24 2012. Perry Jones pick 28 2013. Steven Adams pick 12 2013. Archie Goodwin pick 29 2014. Mitch McGary pick 21 2014. Josh Huestis pick 29 2015. Cameron Payne pick 14 2017. Terrence Ferguson pick 21   After all of these great picks, especially with how late some of them are you can’t just blow this off as “luck”"
Would have Kevin Durant considered Houston a option in free agency if he knew Russel Westbrook would be traded there?
meanwhile golden state spent that $24 million cap spike on kevin fucking durant lmao.
Imagine defending Kevin 'The Bitch' Durant with the 'cares for his team' defense. Straight stupid.
Kevin Durant
"This is who I can remember: Paul Geroge, kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Whiteside, (I think) Malcolm brogdon, Westbrook, Kyrie, Butler, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus cousins, Al horford kemba Walker, chris Paul. That's 13 people who are at least all stars who are changing teams. It's insane."
"Seriously. The list of NBA legends that will play on a different team next season is astounding:   Kevin Durant, Paul George, Jared Dudley, Kawhi Leonard... the list is endless"
Steph=Kevin Abstract  Klay=Matt Chanpion  Draymond=Joba  Kevin Durant=Ameer  Boogie=Merlyn
"Westbrook + Harden, Houston is going to to be unreal. They should try and add one more elite player. Probably someone who’s tall and can shoot. I’m just spitballing, but maybe trade for someone like Kevin Durant? That’d be a pretty interesting team. I bet they’d make the finals even if the don’t win the chip."
The rockets should have gotten that Kevin Durant guy too. Surely that trio could win a championship.
"Well I watched a PBS documentary recently which seemed to suggest that the universe is not literally infinite to the point that there are an infinite number of Kevin Durant’s in an infinite number of universe is as is suggested on Star Trek the next generation, however, if there were like let’s say 1 million billion universes, then surely there are many  in which Kevin Durant has demanded to be traded to Houston and Kyrie is forced to wrestle with his ego in terms of whether to beg Kevin Durant to stay or not."
That'd be crazy. Here's my attempt to Photoshop them on the [same team.](https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/65/4/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-james-harden-getty-ftr-110316_640lqph5exsk12vhr09kf9iaf.jpg?t=688696832&amp;quality=100)
"Kevin Durant is like a 2 guard that's so damn big you put him at the three, always looks like he's hitting practice jumpers.  Magic running showtime   When Jordan jumped he always sorta paused in mid air."
You forgot one dude called Kevin Durant
You get one of the most efficient scorers of all time in Kevin Durant.  But I'm sure Austin Rivers will suffice.
**Kevin Durant wants to know your location.**

"They need one more guy, maybe they could get Kevin Durant to join them."
"Those picks could be anyone! Maybe even James Harden, Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant"
Imagine that Rockets team with Kevin Durant. Him alongside Harden and Westbrook could maybe make it to the WCF.
Imagine if Harden and Westbrook were on the same team with someone like Kevin Durant. That team would surely win some championships.
Kevin durant feels left out
Could you imagine if they added someone like Kevin Durant? Those three would be unstoppable!
"As a blazers fan this can not be more true. (See Greg Oden over Kevin Durant, Sam Bowie over Jordan)"
"the question is:  if you could pick one player to lead your team during the playoffs to win a championship, who would you pick?  personally i would pick LeBron James first, then Kevin Durant, then probably Stephen Curry, then Kawhi  and that's my top 4 right there  yours may be different and that's fine"
and then they stole the Celtics best player and signed Kevin Durant
&gt; when really he was most likely just probably  yeah because he really most likely just probably didn't [raise the price of his shoes from $88 dollar to $130 dollars because of his ego](https://www.si.com/nba/2016/07/07/warriors-kevin-durant-kd-sneakers-shoes-nike-increased-price)

It's not the same argument of Kevin Love either, KD would fit into our offensive scheme of running around screens and finding open shots. He's got a high basketball IQ. And he plays fucking great defense when he tries, which would be significantly higher in a Warriors team where his offensive burden would be less.  I can't believe people out there are saying no."""

&gt;He's KEVIN DURANT  He's Kevin Durant after sustaining the worst injury in sports and who will miss the entire first season out of a 3+! contract.
I think he is already top 3 IMO. He has been MVP runner up for half a decade now and was the closest to defeat to full strength Kevin Durant led Warriors which is quite an impossible task and should be up there in terms of accomplishments.
"Ah yes, when Kevin Durant singlehandedly beat Lebron back to back"
Uhh no he wasn't Kevin Durant was after beating him for 2 straight years in the Finals Lol
"&gt; what it seems like is that he wants the warriors to thank him for helping them win two ships. its very strange  Not really. After all...the Warriors *did*.  Lacob released a statement right after KD committed to the Nets:  “Three years ago, we were thrilled with the arrival of Kevin Durant, a transformative NBA player and one of the best to ever play the game. He provided our fans and franchise with numerous highlights during his stay here—two NBA championships, two NBA Finals MVPs, three trips to the Finals, unparalleled efficiency—and carried himself with class and dignity both on and off the court.  ""His commitment to our community was evident each day, including last season when his philanthropic efforts earned him the NBA’s annual Community Assist Award. Today, as he starts a new chapter in his incredible career, we thank KD for all of his contributions, for being an integral part to one of the most prolific runs in NBA history and wish him well as he continues his Hall of Fame journey. As long as I am Co-Chairman of this team, no player will ever wear #35 for the Warriors again.”"
"To be honest, free agency isn't working out the way it is suppose to. Kevin Durant should have walked and the Warriors shouldn't have gotten anything for it. They wouldn't be able to sign a big player because of their salary cap situation and that is how super teams are suppose to get broken up.   What the Warriors are doing are within the rules of the system, but go against the spirit of the rules. I fully expect sign and trades to be axed soon in some way, like if you resign or sign a player, you can't trade them for 4 months or for like 30 games in the season. Or if a player's contract is expiring in the next few months, you can't trade them (contract expiring during free agency period)."
"The trade was  GSW sends: Kevin Durant, 1st round pick  Nets send: DLo, Shabazz Napier, Treveon Graham  The Warriors later had to pay $4m to Minnesota to take Napier and Graham off their hands so it was even more ridiculous"
"He was committed to OKC in 2016 provided KD stayed. Their lineup would've been:  * PG: Russell Westbrook * SG: Andre Roberson * SF: Kevin Durant * PF: Al Horford * C: Steven Adams * Bench: Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis, Dion Waiters, Ersan Ilyasova, Enes Kanter  That's a LOADED team. And since they still would've had Sabonis and Oladipo, they still would've been able to trade for Paul George the following offseason."
"""Then I heard you told Kevin Durant he could have whatever contract he wants next year"".  Bob ""Yeah, that was just for the media, he can't have anything like that at all""  Steve Kerr ""Mid-Level""  Bob ""Yeah, Mid-level behind closed doors""  ""Because I think last year you told Steph he could any contract he wants too, so..""  Bob ""Well, yeah, that was different. He's been here from the way before days. He's earned it""  Steve Kerr ""wow""  ""and there ended the Warriors cohesion, right there""  Steve Kerr ""So much for chemistry""  Bob ""That's when it began, the first fisher."
When Kevin Durant is as probably the most liked player in the NBA. Time really does change
"Sources say that a divorce between Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala imminent, Kevin Durant to live with Brooklyn Nets"
"2005 - San Antonio Spurs **(Tim Duncan won MVP in '02 and '03)**  2006 - Miami Heat **(Shaquille O'Neal won MVP in '00)**  2007 - San Antonio Spurs **(Tim Duncan won MVP in '02 and '03)**  2008 - Boston Celtics **(Kevin Garnett won MVP in '04)**  2009 - Los Angeles Lakers **(Kobe Bryant won MVP in '08)**  2010 - Los Angeles Lakers **(Kobe Bryant won MVP in '08)**  2011 - Dallas Mavericks **(Dirk Nowitzki won MVP in '07)**  2012 - Miami Heat **(LeBron James won MVP in '09, '10 and ongoing season's MVP)**  2013 - Miami Heat **(LeBron James won MVP in '09, '10, '12 and ongoing season's MVP)**  2014 - San Antonio Spurs **(Tim Duncan won MVP in '02 and '03)**  2015 - Golden State Warriors **(Stephen Curry won ongoing season's MVP)**  2016 - Cleveland Cavaliers **(LeBron James won MVP in '09, '10, '12 and '13)**  2017 - Golden State Warriors **(Stephen Curry won MVP in '15 and '16; Kevin Durant won MVP in '14)**  2018 - Golden State Warriors **(Stephen Curry won MVP in '15 and '16; Kevin Durant won MVP in '14)**"
Kobe Bryant Highlights and Kevin Durant
You ever hear of Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant has two Finals MVPs
"If Kevin Durant never existed, I could see a player like Bol Bol going late in the first.  But Kevin Durant proved a player like Bol Bol can succeed in the league, and we can't forget KD couldn't get 125 for reps at the combine."
"saw one deleted account, back in may 29 2015 predict this  2015 - Warriors win the title (Steph Finals MVP)  2016 - Cavs win the title (Kyrie Finals MVP)  then for 2017 and 2018 - Kevin Durant Finals MVP  That was almost accurate"
"Lol illegal defense AND the Bulls don't shoot threes, give the team with Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry."
"4/70 or so would be a great deal for him. That’s basically a 3/45 extension, but smoothed out.   Whatever he signs, as long as dollars and years above what he declined are in the 12-15 range, he’s made the right move. Injuries are risk money-wise if you’re not literally Kevin Durant or Lebron."
"But the way the Warriors play, it's not about individual defense, it's about knowing who and where to help off. Just because he is Pippen or because he is Rodman doesn't mean they would know how to handle that kind of motion offense. Especially with Steph, Klay, and Kevin Durant. It's too much."
"I’d have to agree. I don’t see any other major FA that Clippers could get that tips the scales. Kevin Durant or Klay would be the answer but both are out for next year/willing to stay with GS.   Lakers are set up to wreck the west, as long as A-Day-to-Davis stays healthy."
"In the research that you did, did you account for folks that are 7 foot freaks of nature? Did you account for folks &gt;200 pounds? Did those folks that returned continue every day activities or did they return to play in the NBA? Point is, Kevin Durant is not in the average cohort. Unfortunately I don’t think he will be even 75% of what he was before the injury. I’d be happy to be wrong though."
"Guaranteed if the Knicks sign Kevin Durant, your stupid ass: ”LOL maxing out a 31 year-old big name with a torn achilles classic starfucking Knicks never change AnYtHiNg”  If Durant signs elsewhere, also from your stupid ass: “LoL tHe KnIcKs ThOuGhT tHeY wErE gEtTiNg Kd LmAo”"
Kevin Durant was maxed on his first sting in GSW. They had cap slave to max him.
"Lifted this from an Athletic article.  &gt; Reason One: Reduced Incentives For Players  The 2011 CBA deliberately gutted sign-and-trades by only allowing players to get their richest possible contract by re-signing with their prior team. Before, the sign-and-trade process permitted elite free agents to have their cake and eat it too with five-year contracts and higher annual raises on new teams. Now there is no difference in what a free agent can make if they change teams via cap space or sign-and-trade so there is no reason to engage the prior team should they want to leave in most circumstances.  The rationale behind the shift was giving players a more stark choice that could fuel retention but it has only ended up mattering if it is an extremely close call. For example, Kevin Durant and Gordon Hayward turned down significantly more lucrative offers from successful franchises to join new teams. An important consideration is that the biggest difference between a four-year max and a five-year max is the fifth season, which younger free agents often care less about. This same dynamic could be in play for Anthony Davis, as the additional security of a fifth season may not hold as much value as a mechanism to become a free agent again just three years later or even earlier, which he can do with any team.  Reason Two: Elimination of Prior Team Leverage  Similarly, the sign-and-trade overhaul had a rationale from the team perspective that has largely functioned as planned, though there can be massive disagreements on whether or not that is a good thing. Giving players a bigger financial margin between returning and leaving has its advantages but also means that prior teams end up with absolutely nothing when they leave. It has been fascinating to see that shift combine with the new CBA’s Designated Veteran rules permitting the best of the best to sign 35 percent max contracts early. Players have been remarkably comfortable leaving massive money on the table to choose a new team. Durant’s case is a great example here because even when the Thunder played hardball and forced the Warriors to clear cap initially in 2016, structuring the final transaction as a sign-and-trade would have produced a gigantic trade exception for OKC and possibly a modest asset return in exchange for the Warriors opening up a larger Mid-Level exception and possibly a way to avoid losing as many holdover players. Sam Presti did a remarkable job pivoting and retooling after Durant’s departure but another resource like that trade exception would have made that process much more manageable.  That Thunder story could return with a vengeance this season with so many elite free agents potentially leaving capped-out franchises. Because of other obligations, the Warriors, Celtics, Raptors and possibly 76ers will not be able to replace their superstars should they choose to take their talents elsewhere. As such, some of the league’s best teams will not only lose cornerstones but also lack the ability to properly replace them. It is absolutely fair to classify that as the cost of doing business in the modern NBA but that ratchets up the downside and thus the urgency of those negotiations."
"yes hahahaha, kevin durant got hurt and title race is now wide open"
"&gt; This is probably the greatest team of all time. If no one would put an asterisk if Kawhi went down because the better team would have won anyway. The injury wouldn’t have changed final outcome in that case. That’s not to say this win has one either, but certainly the context is important. When you’re against the greatest team of all time, it’s fair to assume you would lose. The Cavs had a better star than you did and a better second guy in 2017 and still managed to lose in 5.   No team is the greatest team of all time until they prove it on the court. That's why they play the games. The 73 win Warriors were the greatest team of all time, until they lost to the Cavs. The 2004 Lakers were unbeatable (Shaq, Kobe, Payton, Malone, etc), until a superstar-less group from Detroit beat them in 5 games. If being the best team on paper was the standard, that 2004 Lakers team would have been handed the title before the season started, but that's not how it works. You aren't the best until you beat everyone else, and that goes both ways.  The 2004 series is actually a perfect mirror to this series. You had a flashy team of all-time greats with a seemingly unstoppable offence, come up against an unsung tough veteran team with an elite defence. Everyone was calling for Lakers in 4 or 5, but the time-tested saying that ""an elite defence beats an elite offence"" played out.  On paper, you will not find a more stacked team than the 2004 Lakers were. Three of their guys are already first-ballot Hall of Famers, and Kobe is a no doubter when he becomes eligible. Even the Warriors, fully healthy, could not boast as star-studded a lineup. The Raptors had the same type of elite defence as Detroit did, the same type of veteran point guard running the floor (Lowry vs Billups), the same type of all-time defensive stud (Kawhi vs Ben Wallace), and a deep team of above-average rotation players.  Look back at the lineup of those teams in that 2004 Finals and you tell me that the Raptors this year are a worse team than that Pistons team on paper, and then you look at that Lakers team and tell me the Warriors are a definitively better team than them on paper. There is a reason they play the games, and until you prove you are the best on the floor you haven't earned anything. Sure, regular season stats don't necessarily mean a guaranteed result in the playoffs, but they are a hell of a lot better than random people's opinions about which team is better on paper. At least the regular season provides some evidence about how teams will match up in real life. There is no actual evidence to support your contention that the Warriors were going to beat the Raptors.  As for the 2017 matchup you mentioned, two things: First of all, do you really think the 2017 Cavs were better than the 2019 Raptors? I feel like this is the superstar bias people seem to have slipping in. The 2017 Cavs had a shit defence, while the Raptors were an elite defensive team. LeBron had declined as a defender before 2017. Their ""second best player"" Kyrie Irving is a sieve on the defensive end, and their third best player Kevin Love has always been a negative defensively. The Cavs were the 21st rated defence in the 2016-2017 regular season, and the 11th best that postseason. They allowed an average of 121.6 points in that Finals series. The most points the 2019 Raptors allowed in a single game in the entire playoffs was 116 against Philly. The Dubs without KD scored an average of 114.8 points a game in their sweep of the Blazers, and only averaged 105.8 against the Raptors. If you ask me? The 2019 Raptors would have destroyed the 2017 Cavs. Kawhi could contain LeBron, the way he did in his Spurs days (except now it would have been past-prime LeBron vs prime Kawhi, instead of prime LeBron vs pre-prime Kawhi), and the Raptors would have had a half dozen guys score at will against a team that couldn't defend a traffic cone.  Secondly, do you really think the 2019 Dubs were better than the 2017 version? The 2017 team had more depth, as they have been unable to hang on to their key bench players over the years. A couple of the key rotation players are noticeably older in 2019 than they were in 2017 (Igoudala and Livingston, in particular), and the Dubs had internal chemistry issues all year related to Kevin Durant's free agency. In 2017, Durant was fighting for his first title and first finals MVP. If he had played in 2019, he already had one foot out the door, and his teammates knew it. The 2017 Dubs only lost one game all playoffs, while the 2019 version, while Durant was still there, lost 2 games to the 8th seeded Clippers in the first round."
"Signed Kevin Durant and lost Bogut Ezeli and Barnes. Also got Pat McCaw and Jones really low in the draft, and they look like lower end NBA talents. I’ll never forget that Players Tribune Article."
"I'm not sure you're aware of this, but GSW has some pretty decent other players besides kevin durant."
"&gt; With the Warriors’ present and future in doubt because of injuries to free agents Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, it would seem like the perfect opportunity for the Rockets to move forward, but Paul has made it known he’d like to play elsewhere.  So he requested a trade?"
"I think maybe Harrison Barnes sees the Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson Injuries and is thinking that he needs to lock up a good long term deal right now.  Get that guaranteed money for the long run, not just a lot of money right now."
"Kevin Durant averaged 35 PPG including a 45 and 50 point game to finish them off, so pretending that the Warriors just took it easy on the Clippers makes 0 sense.  The Warriors team the Clippers faced was clearly and objectively better than the Warriors team the Raptors faced."
Kevin Durant says hello
"Agree. It's not about the money, it's more about forming a superteam and not being the 1st option.  If he signed with the Lakers he wouldn't lose money on the long run.    Kevin Durant did discounts with the Warriors but he hadn't win any rings before unlike Kawhi that already has two FMVP's."
Ask Kevin Durant.
"The ""swaggy p incident"" was fake social media drama. Nick Young couldn't have been cheating on Iggy Azalea because he never actually was with Iggy Azalea, they were both promoting their social media brands like so many other young Hollywood ""couples"". It was about as real as the  Kevin Durant and Drake ""feud"", or any of Taylor Swift's ""beefs"""
"Lol you don’t even know what coasting is man. Let the Raps win a couple more chips and you’ll understand.  Hardly broke a sweat is just a blatant misrepresentation. The Raptors played hard, and were the more talented, deep, and physically dominant team for the entire series. It wasn’t as one sided as your rose colored glasses are allowing you to believe.  Your argument is that the sharp money was on a Raptors team playing against the Warriors without KD? No shit?  All of your numbers mean nothing because it isn’t a question of how the Raptors performed. It’s a question of how good Kevin Durant is. And you just don’t get it. So we’re done here."
kevin durant
That vs Warriors sending a report and crying to the league because 6'2 Pat Beverley was bothering 7 foot Kevin Durant.
Ask Kevin Durant.
"&gt; After winning last year's NBA title, Business Insider reports that the 29-year-old signed a two-year contract with the team that pays him $25 million for this 2017-2018 season. That figure is $1.5 million less than he made the previous year, and $9.5 million less than he was eligible to receive.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/07/why-kevin-durant-took-a-10-million-pay-cut-to-play-for-the-warriors.html"
Kevin Durant wasn't going to play with Lebron James and be the 2nd option AND take a paycut AND he hadn't won anything yet in his career. Kawhi is far more accomplished right now than KD was when he left OKC.
"Dude can shoot over majority of players without even jumping. Curry is still an elite PG and Durant can play catch and shoot too with open shots. Klay dropped 60 with barely any dribbles. This is Kevin Durant, not some average scorer."
"Kevin Durant literally just took a paycut after winning back to back finals MVPs, but ok..."
Unfortunately we know the raptors would have gotten slapped if Kevin Durant played in the series they may have gotten lucky and gotten one by probably a straight sweeeeep
IT averaged 42.4 points per100 possessions on 62.5% TS.   Players who have done this:   - Steph Curry x1   - Isaiah Thomas   (Almost Kevin Durant)   One of the greatest scoring seasons in the history of the NBA.   Kyrie's injury and controvery riddled two seasons here don't get close to that one IT year.
"Of the superstars that started their careers in the 2000s or 2010s so far:  T-1. Stephen Curry - 3 championships T-1. Lebron James - 3 championships 3. Dwyane Wade - 3 championships T-4. Kevin Durant - 2 championships T-4. Kawhi Leonard - 2 championships  I think we will likely see players fizzle out around 3 championships these days. It will be rarer to see players get to the amount that Kobe, Duncan, Jordan, etc. got to.  This is by design. We now have not only the luxury tax, but also the repeater tax, making it difficult to sustain stacked teams in this era. Curry, James, Wade, and Durant were all part of super teams (or multiple super teams in the case of Lebron), and none of them have gotten past 3 rings yet.  Because the CBA is designed for every increasing parity with the repeater tax in there now, I would guess people probably need to re-assess how many rings they expect players to win in their careers."
Chris Paul woulda made the Finals with tucking Kevin Durant too.

"Zach Lowe was talking about this, true depth is losing Kevin Durant and still being able to win a playoff series. Forget about the 7th man, just make sure #2 and #3 are good enough to beat a playoff team."
"Well what do you want them to do? Magically heal Kevin Durant so randoms like you won't question their incredible accomplishment? Even without KD, and even with half a series of Klay, that Warriors team is one of the 5-10 best teams in the league.  If you think Steph and Dray are past their primes, you're just wrong.  Steph averaged 27/5/5 on 47/44/91 shooting.  In the playoffs he got better, 28/6/6 (shooting splits did go down a bit). That's nuts. Draymond, who was literally out of shape and sandbagging in the regular season, still made second team all defense.  In the playoffs, he clearly stepped it up to a level where he looked like one of the absolute best defenders in the league.  He averaged 9 assists and 10 boards in the playoffs.  That's pretty god damn good.  Let's talk a bit about injury luck. Warriors last year - Chris Paul getting injured in WCF was huge for them. They were losing by over 20 in game 1 of the WCF the year before that before Kawhi goes down.  That injury luck is huge for them. Their first title with this core in 2015 - Kyire AND Kevin Love injured for the finals. That's immense. Cavs in 2016, they probably don't win if Dray doesn't get suspended. So by your logic, we have to add an asterisk to all these titles. Any time someone brings up any of these championships, are we supposed to ""well actually"" the conversation?  You can act like the Raptors got extremely lucky.  They did.  I'm a Raptors fan, but I can be honest and say the Raptors probably don't beat a fully healthy Golden State squad.  [They beat them twice in the regular season, including once at Oracle without Kawhi (won by over 20). The other win was with KD going off for 50, an unreal performance.  Raptors stayed collected and got a tight, tough win. Just the regular season, sure.  But I'm pretty confident in saying that even healthy GSW doesn't roll over Toronto in these finals.  At least 6 games, and I still might have put good money on Raptors in 7.]  This championship by the Toronto Raptors was not historically lucky or easy.  They earned it just as much as any other champion of the last decade.  From savvy front office moves, to bold coaching decisions and injury management, to excellent, consistent play from the stars, and a bountiful rotation of great contributions from role players. Great shooting, great defense, great playmaking and team-work, from game 1 of the preseaon to game 6 of the finals.  If you're salty, I get it.  Watching another team win and celebrate stings.  But honestly, you can't take anything away from us.  This was a hard fought, well earned title. Fuck your asterisk."
Kevin Durant then.
"this is riduclous, that's on the organization to manage riskier players with poor medical history. Kevin durant had 4 foot surgeries in his coach before this achilles injury, given that history, it would be smart to limit his minutes and games played and have depth or consider the risk when giving him a max contract. ALSO, it would be a great idea to not have the least amount of depth you've had in 5 years.   &amp;#x200B;  You cannot just oversimplify the reasons for losing was injuries and of of your control. There's history, if you're an athlethe or have played the game, you know it would be a bad idea to not drink water or have a poor diet and lack potassium and get muscle cramps more frequently and increase the risk of injury. you know that when you weight lift one specific area,, you should not work that specific area the next day and prioritize another area, why? because the area is still in recovery phase. Now  imagine playing 32 min a game, and continued to play despite muscles feeling sore and exahsuted and you end up playing 40 minutes, there's a higher risk for injury, your legs may be tired and it affects your shot. therese are just simple examples that hopefulyl make sense."
"They're gutting the Nets just becoz Jay-Z still has pulls on the org. Damn. Well, here's to hoping Caris can pull in Kevin Durant while he rehabs."
"&gt;had a hero quarter from KD  And  &gt;Everyone is ignoring evidence  Look, injuries happen. That banner you guys hung was earned, and your team was incredible. Nobody can take that from you. You are the champs.  But don't delude yourself into thinking you would have won it either way. Like you said, this was a close series in almost every game, despite GSW missing their best player for all but 12 minutes and our 2nd best scorer for a 6 quarters. Don't bring up GSW's ""luck"" when they were down one of the GOATs.  I mean, come on man. He's Kevin Durant, you know he is. Or at least, everyone besides you does."
If GS had a better bench they wouldnt be able to have kevin durant. The only reason they “drove their stars into the ground” was because a freak accident to KD. The bench wasn’t the problem.
"People start ponzi schemes with the express purpose of taking advantage of people too desperate to see what’s going on, so yeah, you’d be a rich POS.  Kevin Durant freely joined a team in Free Agency, completely within the rules of the league, without taking advantage of anyone, because it’s his job to play basketball and he gets to decide where he wants to do it when he’s a free agent.  So there’s a bit of a difference here."
I need to reiterate. It's not an asterisk on the warriors. It's on Kevin Durant by himself.
[Kevin Durant blocks LeBron James](https://imgur.com/VtgcSsK). I love the composition--the way Durant's arm follows the arc on the court.
"KD *may* insist on a 4 year deal. If he does, you have to at least consider biting the bullet for a year, since the payoff is 2-3 years of Kevin Durant."
"Ok so here's the thing. the Warriors were missing their BEST player, the best player in the playoffs upto that point( better than your best player and the best player in the league for the ENTIRE SERIES except for 12 mins. Imagine if Kawhi got injured before the bucks or philly series due to a freak injury on court. You'd have a shit ton of Raps fans bemoaning their luck. The Raps are equal to the 2016,2017 Cavs in terms of the finals opponents the Dubs had to face but to pretend that not having Kevin Durant does not impact a team's chances is ridiculous. Boogie could barely run because of the quad injury, Dray is not an all star this year, iggy's 35 . You basically had to beat Steph and Klay on offense. Lowry, Gasol all were ex-allstars, You have the best 2-way player in the world and the MIP. So the Raps are an elite team and deserve to win but they were facing a team without its BEST player not the 2nd or 3rd best."
"nah man kevin durant only 6'9"" said so himself"
"You know Kevin Durant was there too and that James harden was a 6th man, not to mention you had serge ibaka and a different style of play and team altogether"
During KD's Free Agency in 2016  Reporter: Is KD coming back?  Serge: [Of course](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.cbslocal.com/2016/06/10/serge-ibaka-kevin-durant-staying-in-oklahoma-city-tmz-report/amp/)
"I love the point u/thirdtimestheparm made. If he listened to the doctors advice over his own instinct, he could have worsened it. Team doctors are part of the team, and can be blinded by hope. There are reports that's a team doctors told Kevin Durant he would not injure his Achilles if he played. Well....   Also, a big part of the equation Spurs fans are ignoring is that Pop came out and pretty much told the people that he didn't know why Leonard wasn't playing, essentially forcing him to answer the criticism instead of the coach protecting the player and taking the heat. He threw him under the bus. Why, idk; but these salty Spurs fans are out in droves here. Schechenfreude, or whatever."

"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23366667/inside-tension-kawhi-leonard-spurs  This article is written by Ramona Shellburne, an LA sports journalist and lakers fan, but ironically one of the only ones doing honest reporting during the whole ordeal. She interviewed Kawhi and people close to him and really covers all aspects. If you really want the honest picture, I suggest you read this.  &gt; Apparently the Spurs were/are controlling about their players off court actions and even sponsorships.  This is untrue and the article cites as much  &gt; ESPN reported in March that Leonard and his camp walked away from a four-year, $22 million extension of his current shoe contract with Nike's Jordan Brand. According to sources on both sides, talks abruptly broke down because Robertson did not feel the offer was worthy of the former Finals MVP.  That was his Uncle's decision. To put it in perspective, the only higher paid shoe contracts at the time by Nike were Lebron James, Kevin Durant, and James Harden. The weird part is, I kind of get it, because most spurs fans really felt his talent was underappreciated by the average fan, but you can't pin these business decisions on the spurs.  If you are really interested in Uncle Dennis Robertson, I highly suggest you read about the Elfus Lawsuit and it's underlying documents:   https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23781532/kawhi-leonard-former-agent-sues-commissions"
"The difference is, they're not invincible. They're a strong team but they still have their faults and weaknesses. Golden State adding Kevin Durant was debilitating because they made it clear they werent even looking for competition. And for KD's 2 rings their truly was NONE. It wasnt fun to watch. It was inevitable basketball, and the Warriors were truly bulletproof. That has NEVER been the case with any of Lebron's teams. The Heat were beatable, the Cavs were beatable, and even these Lakers are beatable."
"Because Kevin Durant is probably the most talented player ever to be sidelined in a finals? Personally, who cares? But just pointing it out if Jordan missed a finals series and the bulls lost people would not consider it an earned championship."
people on this subreddit finna clown you for putting kobe in but you are a real one. to answer your question I would say Kevin Durant and possibly Kawhi
Yep. Otto Porter said he's Kevin Durant.
"The serious switch in attitudes is hilarious. Like I knew it would happen, but they acted like Lonzo/Ingram/Kuzma weren’t better than Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson for months and now we traded Jason Kidd and Kevin Durant away apparently and got scrap metal in return.  Like, Anthony Davis is pretty good."
"I honestly thing GSW were not that universally hated until Durant joined them. A 73 win team grabbing the second best player in NBA pissed everyone off. Accordingly, ruined a budding Cavs v Warriors rivalry. My circle of friends we used to respect them for being self built and Curry 2016 season was something godly. Kevin used to be universally loved too...remember that ""Mom..you da MVP"" speech."
Kevin durant is gay and that has in part contributed to his enigmatic personality and decision making.  Once he comes out of the closet he will feel much better
This is false. Kevin Durant just did the same this past postseason. Led he playoffs with 34.2 ppg and was 11.1% higher than league average in playoff TS%
"I'm only taking players post merger, as the game was totally different in the 60s and early 70s.  PG:  Tough one.  John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, CP3 and Steph Curry all have arguments.  I think Curry eventually takes 2nd or 3rd at least.  SG:  Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade.  James Harden has a chance at taking the 3rd spot, but his lack of defense makes it a long shot.  SF:  Larry Bird and Kevin Durant.  PF:  Kevin Garnett and Karl Malone.  C:  Shaq and Hakeem Olajuwon."

Kevin Durant leaving OKC.  Kawhi leaving Toronto.

"Curry ain't even 32 yet and Jordan won his fourth finals at 32. Curry's been to the finals 4 times straight already at 31.  Jordan at this age had only been to 3 finals. This is comparing apples to oranges but it's fun to imagine that Curry could realistically win 2 or 3 more championships. All he needs is a strong 3&amp;D + a little mid range small forward, maybe someone like Kevin Durant... Ahh fuck I miss KD"
Kevin Durant - Aaron Rodgers. Can beat you in many many different ways. Both are extremely talented and are extremely efficient. Both are sensitive to criticism.
"Think of all the things that went right for the Warriors after this though:  1. Added Steve Kerr, one of the top coaches in the league 2. Draymond Green exploded onto the scene 3. Curry stayed healthy AND signed a cheap contract AND became the greatest shooter in history 4. Klay became one of the greatest shooters ever 5. Other teams took years to adapt to the high volume three point shots  Not to mention Kevin Durant"
If Giannis could be a hybrid of Magic Johnson and Kevin Durant...fuck
"Him talking about ""I like Kevin Durant"" just feels so weird now that they're peers. Durant isn't even old, so it says a lot about how far Giannis has come in an incredibly short amount of time."
&gt;I say Kevin Durant just because if he doesn't feel like Oklahoma is committed to winning a ring (which is a reasonable thing to say IMO after the last two offseasons) he will just leave and find a place that will be happy to drop bank to put a mega team around him.  KD is fully capable of leading a team to a chip as a #1 option (he just has Lebron in the way right now) but I don't know if Harden is

"Because we watched the finals? Kawhi was outplayed by Klay Thompson in the nba finals. Steph Curry was the leading scorer of the nba finals not Kawhi. Kawhi was outshined even by Kd in just the 11 minutes Kd played.  Kawhi's 4th quarter numbers in the finals were nonexistent. When Lebron put those stats up in the 2011 nba finals we all called it a black mark on his career.  Kawhi is not better than Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, or Lebron James."
Yea with Kevin Durant  Give Paul George Kevin Durant and he could definitely do that   Not hard to get to a conference finals with a generational talent playing with u
"Klay Thompson's contract will come back to haunt the Warriors.  Thompson is 29 and has signed a five year contract for $190 million, with an average yearly salary of $37,980,720.  His play declined last year and in light of his age it's likely to continue to decline over the next five years.  Whatever you think of him, no one puts him on the same MVP level as Steph Curry or Kevin Durant.  Yet through 2024, when he'll be 34 years old, they are paying him like an MVP level player.  In addition to all that, Klay just sustained an ACL tear that will keep him out most of next year.  While several players have come back from ACL tears, it's a bad sign that he's already starting to suffer the kind of injuries associated with aging players."
"2012 team is way better than the 2008 team tbh. Thats who should be compared to the dream team or the 96 team.  PG - Chris Paul, Deron Williams,  Russell Westbrook  SG- Kobe Bryant, James Harden  SF- Lebron, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Iguodala  Bigs- Kevin Love, Anthony Davis, Tyson Chandler"
"LeBron was on a stacked deck as a Miami Heat player and were expected to win 8 titles according to LeBron himself. Let's just revisionist history. And tbh, they would've 3-peated if it wasn't for LeBron having a nightmare series against Mavericks.   OKC were a legit playoff team because of Durant. Since he left, they haven't reached the 2nd while being outclassed despite being the favorites in those matchups.  I wouldn't say the Cavaliers were 'huge underdogs' ahead of NBA Finals 2016. They pushed Warriors to Game 6 in previous year despite Kyrie &amp; Kevin no available. The Cavaliers with LeBron/Kyrie/Love proved that 73-9 regular season record don't mean anything in grand scheme of things."
What team did Kevin Durant beat in the finals without the Warriors.
"imagine being invited last min to a party, even if you wanna go, you've already got your own plans and are busy so even though you would be up for it, you cannot fit it into your schedule at this point. USA basketball should send out more offers ahead of time, there's been a decrease in commitment to USA basketball the last couple of years, especially after what happened to Paul george and kevin durant I think? USA basketball and jerry colangelo needs to plan better and invite more players next time and recognize players have a bigger priority and need for their own team and family during the off-season."
"I mean, that team had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, widely regarded by most Thai prisoners to be the 3 most likeable players in the league."
Be named Kevin Durant
"You’re certainly right, during the argument Durant looks to Andre and says “this is why I’m out”   Dray was saying “we won before you were here we don’t need you to win”  It would seem that argument was when Draymond let it be known he knew what Kevin had planned."
"Tbh, it's Kevin Durant..."
&gt; **Top NBA Duos for the 2019-2020 Season**    &gt;   &gt; 3. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving - Brooklyn Nets   I thought KD is out for the entire season?

"&gt;he wasn't able to come through and that's on him as much as the Clipper organization.  Except he did come through. Injuries, a lack of a real wing, and insane competition is what made CP3 not get to the finals/ win a ring.   - 2012 WC1: He averaged 20/6/7/3 on 57% TS, clearly the best player in the floor throughout the series vs the Grizzlies, where he wills them to the 2nd round. Clippers depth plays like garbage (Caron Butler 35/20/71 splits, Mo Williams 37/33/87 splits, and they're 3 and 4 in scoring for the Clippers)   - 2012 WCSF: They play the Spurs, who stomp them into the ground. Paul has one of the only bad series of his career, averaging 13/4/9/3 on 43%TS. Rest of the Clippers play awful aswell. Sweep.  --------------   - 2013 WC1: They play the now improved GnG Grizzlies again. Paul averages 23/4/6/2 and is once again the best player on the floor for the series. Griffin is suffering from injuries, and the clippers depth plays like hot garbage (Jamal 24/62 from the field, Blake averages 13ppg, and most of the rest players are washed up versions of their past selves (Grant Hill, Lamar Odom, Chauncey Billups, and pre-relevance DeAndre Jordan (who averages 3ppg)). They lose in 6 despite Pauls efforts.  ---------------   - 2014 WC1: They play the Golden State Warriors after Curry becomes a superstar. Him and Paul battle for 7 games, with the Clippers coming on top, in the Warriors coming out party. Everyone plays well and the Clippers spread the scoring with 5 players in double figures. Paul averages 17/5/9/3 on 55%. He's easily the best player in his team, and it's arguable he outperformed Curry aswell if you factor in his defensive impact.   - 2014 WCSF: They play the reigning MVP in Kevin Durant, and they lose in 6 despite Chris Paul having an amazing series. He averages 23/4/12/3 on 61%TS. Crawford shits the bed as usual, and Clippers lack of bench kills them, to the point where post injury Danny Granger and Big Baby have to play meaningful minutes. He loses the series with a positive +-.  ---------------------   - 2015 WC1: They play the reigning champs in the 1st round, they face off against the San Antonio Spurs, and they win in 7. Paul is once again spectacular, averaging 23/5/8/2 ON 63% (51/43/97 splits), with a 124 ORtg and 108 DRtg. It says enough of how bad the bench is that with that rating difference they went to 7 anyways. Big Baby is still getting rotation minutes on a very top heavy team.   - 2015 WCSF: (vs Houston) Paul injured for the first 2 games. He has to come back from injury, and while he's going through that he averages 21/4/10/2 on 62%TS. Jamal Crawford goes 34/100 on the series, as per usual being completely worthless, and the Clippers cannot go through Houston, losing in 6.  -------------   - 2016 WC1: Paul plays the first 4 games vs Portland, score tied 2-2, he's a +30 over those 4 games. Clippers lose both games he's out, injured.  ------------   - 2017 WC1: Paul faces off against the Utah Jazz, having an amazing series once again, losing in 7 after Griffin gets injured (only plays 3 games). CP3 averages 25/5/10/2 on 59%TS, and the Clippers without bench or their 2nd star cannot get over the Jazz, losing in 7.  So in 6 years of losing in the playoffs, you can say he had ONE bad playoff series, and yet he's labeled as a choker, bad playoff performer, and people think it's his fault his teams don't make it far. What a joke."
People still underrating Kevin Durant because they don't like him lol.
"Without Klay he will be destroyed along with Russell on backcourt defense. Plus he will be in faul trouble a lot and it will decrease his in game minutes. In addition to that they lost two more great defenders named Kevin Durant and Andre the Tarantula. Man if you think a little bit you will realise that GSW will be smashed in defence before all star break, Klay return and possible Russell trade. You are in big trouble man also I did not even mention fatica of 5 years of being top team of the league. Lol even regular season Green  will be the bonus of this events."
"The mavs loss was bad but earlier in his career he dragged Larry Hughes to the Finals, then lost to a 62 win goated Spurs while putting up 28/8/5, then lost to the Warriors which were one of the greatest teams ever while putting up like 36/13/9 in one of the series and losing to a team with prime Curry and prime Durant. Even Stockton/Malone or Drexler or Barkley or Kemp/Payton  aren’t that good.  He also beat the 73 win warriors with fuckin Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and JR Smith — that’s probably among the couple biggest finals wins in history."
"Every shooting statistic favors Bird. He had a higher 2 point%, 3 point % and FT%. Let’s not forget usage rate. Bird is 52nd All Time...compare that to Harden at 10....which is higher than Durant and Shaq. Bird put up similar career numbers scoring wise to Harden....while having the ball in his hands less. To me, that’s efficient.....  And you’re right...Bird never had a 36 point per game season....his best was a 29.9 season in 1988....which he shot 54% from 2’s. 41.4% from 3 and 91.6% from the line....Bird was still better than Harden across the board with the shooting numbers in Hardens highest scoring season....  I’m using career numbers because one season from Harden doesn’t vault him into “the best offensive player ever” category. A career typically paints a better picture. It’s not my fault Harden came off the bench for 3 years....look....he’s been great since he’s been in Houston.....But, Harden isn’t even the best scorer of his era.....Kevin Durant has a higher career scoring average....has won 4 scoring titles to Hardens’ 2.....and Durant has a better career TS%......"

Kevin Durant would like a word with you
"Why u guys worried about us, you drafted Sam Bowie and Greg Oden over Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant"
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony"
Let's be real here. Kevin Durant basically missing the whole series and Klay being out is way bigger than the health issues we were dealing with.  If Warriors are at 100% I think it goes 6 games at most.
"Yeah, sadly I think Rockets missed their window with CP3. Getting injured after being up 3-2 last year, and then not being able to capitalize on the absence of Kevin Durant."
"Kevin Durant thinks that Kobe is tied for the best player of all time. Guess you believe that now, right? Surely he’s better than KAJ, Bron, Magic, etc.? What about LeBron thinking Shabazz Napier was the best player in his class? Would I have been a fool for daring to think that an NBA player could have a bad basketball opinion?"
1. Kevin Durant
the rockets only won 2 games against the warriors and that is w/o kevin durant already?
It's Kevin Durant and then Steph Curry.
"Andrew Kirilenko was reaching his prime at about the same time as well.   I’ve always felt like the people who covered Kobe best were those a bit smaller, quicker, and with long arms who could avoid biting on pump fakes and force him to over-dribble to get around them. Ak47 and Prince locked him up better than battier, Tony Allen, or Ron Artest.  Kevin Durant was able to guard him as well as the latter bunch."
"Again, Kevin Durant is very much still alive"
Kevin Durant
"Top teams (realistic title contenders) next season (no specific order): bucks, clippers, lakers, 76ers, Nuggets, warriors, rockets   Top ten players: lebron (lakers), Kevin Durant (out all of next season with an Achilles tear, nets), kawhi Leonard (Clippers), giannis antetokounmpo (bucks), James harden (rockets), steph curry (warriors), Anthony Davis (Lakers), Nikola Jokic (Nuggets), Joel Embiid (76ers), Damian Lillard (blazers)"
Isn’t Kevin Durant basically a 7 foot tall AI?
"Alternatively, would you rather take Allen Iverson, or a 6 foot tall Kevin Durant?"
"CP3 buyout, takes a vet minimum, but not with the Lakers.  All-star level player diagnosed with career-altering/ending issue (e.g. Brandon Roy).  Dwight Howard to the Lakers.  DeRozan trade back to the Raptors.  Kevin Durant re-injured during rehab.  Zion Williamson says he doesn't want to play in New Orleans.  NBA expansion announced."
"Kevin Durant, if he was born in 1998 he’d be considered in goat conversations with no LeBron around.         (If his early career plays the same of course)"
"The 2011 Mavericks went through Kobe, Kevin Durant, Chris Bosh, Westbrook, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, etc.  But yeah let’s keep underrating them. The ‘tough west’ narrative doesn’t exist when people talk about this team apparently."
"The one game I went to where Israel lost Yam initially looked like he thought he was a combination of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, once he tamed himself down he was good."

"Alright kid, I’ll bite. You essentially said MJ had weaker competition because there was a higher percentage of white players. Charles Barkley said they best player he ever played against was Kevin McHale. White dude. Several NBA players have said the only other player they feared aside from MJ was Bird—he ate people alive. White dude. You said white players lack the athleticism and length to play in the league. Nash was a 2x MVP. Dirk is in top 10 of nearly every stat. Jokic has been in the MVP discussions for two years now. Kevin Love was a walking 20/10 for about a decade. Doncic ran away with ROTY. Kristaps was given the nickname “Unicorn” by Kevin Durant because he’s got such a rare skill set and athleticism for someone so long. All white. All thriving/thrived in the league as more than spot up shooters. The fact that I actually had to type this out is sad."

"Curry wasn’t the NBA’s best player last year. Harden and Giannis were #1 and #2 in the regular season. Kawhi is also above curry and harden. He averaged more points on higher efficiency playing DPOTY level defense against gainnis and Jimmy butler in games 4,5, and 6. He also led the NBA in BPM, playoff PIPM, and winshares per 48.  Curry had an underwhelming playoff run and his only great series was against the blazers who were the worst perimeter defensive team in the NBA. Durant did the heavy lifting most games. His main competition was Seth Curry. In the finals, his effective field goal % was below league average and he came up small in critical games 4 and 6.   The list should be:  Anthony Davis  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Harden  LeBron  Curry Giannis   With Giannis and curry being interchangeable."
Did Kevin Durant win a MVP with Westbrook on the floor?
"KD just wants to play basketball. He hates the fame aspect of the job but it's forced onto him because of how good he is at doing the thing that lifted him out of crushing poverty. None of us here have ever or will ever experience that level of fame where everything you do and say is under a microscope. LeBron makes it look easy but I don't think it is.  He seems like a sad, unfulfilled guy who wants nothing to do with the world he lives in. It's weird to me how much vitriol people such as yourself have for him when that's so clear to me, but I guess we just have different perspectives. From well before he was a Warrior, the signs of his lack of fulfillment were there. From 2015 (https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-nba-allstar )  &gt; But what he wants to say right now is this: ""I go to sleep at night, like, ’Am I gonna be alone forever?’ "" A whole ocean of regret. His life too hectic, and too surrounded by money, to trust, let alone love, the next person who comes through that door. &gt;  &gt; ""Am I gonna be alone forever? Am I gonna have kids?"" &gt; Almost seven feet tall in a sweat suit, body like God wanted him to be this good.     &gt; ""I feel like there’s no hope. But I still gotta have faith."""
"Kevin Durant are Ruker Park. You can also Google drew league highlights, or search NBA lockout highlights."
"I remember when he was actually relevant to the basketball community. He just made the Kevin Durant diss track which was pretty epic. Now,he just makes clickbait and shitty react videos."
"If the Rockets could make a clutch 3, they'd have interrupted the streak. Now they have Russ who never hits a 3 unless it is clutch. Therefore the Rockets will make sure Kevin Durant and the Warriors don't make it to the finals."
PG - Klay Thompson  SG - Kawhi Leonard  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Larry Bird  C - Hakeem Olajuwon    If we are allowed to play 5 regardless position I want Klay who knows curry better than anyone guarding him. He can also knock down from range at a high clip.
PG - Magic Johnson  SG - Dwyane Wade  SF - Scottie Pippen  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Hakeem Olajuwon  Yeah we might lose
"But he didn't. Breaking over 50 is hard enough, Kevin Durant is arguably the best scorer in the league and his career high is 54."
"Rondo, and CP3 were inarguably better at passing.   Kevin Durant was inarguably better at scoring.   Gasol, Ibaka, Noah &amp; Tony Allen all had arguments as better defenders.   LeBron was by far the best player in the 2012-13 season, but making him something he isn’t is silly."
"1st second or third team all nba isn’t the be all end all. Harden has played with Kevin Durant, Westbrook, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard in his prime   Actually we’ve all said going into the 18-19 season that the rockets were the second best team in the world.  But that’s not to say he’s had more help than Kawhi, just that he’s had help too"

You said that Kevin Durant would not take a max deal. Like if he was offered one then he wouldn’t take it hahaha so dumb. And to answer your question: most teams would pay him the max to lock him up.
[It hurts](https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/65/4/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-james-harden-getty-ftr-110316_640lqph5exsk12vhr09kf9iaf.jpg?t=688696832&amp;quality=100)
&gt; Russell is slightly worse than Irving   This is where I would strongly disagree. Alot of it comes down to hw I feel Russell is badly overrated so I dont want to go down that rabbit hole again but Ill just say IMHO there's a pretty big gap between Kyrie and Russell. Especially in a matchup vs GSW you have a guy like Russell who's weakness is attacking switches vs Kyrie who is one of the best in the NBA at it   This team also just isnt good enough defensively which is what matters. 2017 Cavs had a good offensive rating vs GSW that's not why they lost. AD is the only real high end defender here. Even playoff LeBron aint all that on defense anymore. DLo is a negative. Eric Gordon is about neutral defensively. Kuzma is closer to a negative than positive defensively. This team also has the same issue the 2017 Cavs had: absolutely nobody to guard Kevin Durant.

Kevin Durant
"&gt; clear cut  This is where you're wrong mate. You're whole ""I'd say...."" stuff aside, we are talking about 2010, not 2011. LeBron was back to back NBA MVP, and D Wade was back to back 1st team All NBA. MVP Voting in 2010 was LeBron 1, Wade 5 and Bosh 12. MVP Voting in 2019 was Kawhi 8, LeBron 11 and Davis N/A.

"Only players who have 10+ years of experience or who qualify for the designated veteran extension (DVE), which Kawhi does not, are eligible for the 35% (or $38M) max contract (a la Kevin Durant). Kawhi is eligible for the 30% max contract which is worth $32.7M. The Lakers will be a few 100K short, but not enough to quibble about considering Kawhi left the Spurs who who would have been eligible to give him the 35% max via the DVE, commonly referred to as the supermax."

Kevin Durant Kyrie Irving Kawhi Leonard Jimmy Butler Klay Thompson  Which of these is Kemba better than.  Hayward was coming off a major injury and was not a top of the line FA. Maybe Horford and that's about it.
"Wrong. Wrong.  Harden was 21 when he was traded so not even close to MVP level.   KD and Russ are obviously MVP level players. But so was Lebron and Wade. And Lebron and Irving. But the difference is Lebron got the 3rd Star in Chris Bosh and Kevin Love. Something KD never had in OKC. Give KD the 3rd offensive Star and he wins Rings.  Its hilarious that you don't want to admit Lebron dominates offenses. So hilarious. Bosh went from 25/10 Monster to 17/7. Love went from 25/15 to 17/8. When KD joined the Warriors Klay didn't get marginalized like how Lebron marginalizes his 3rd Star. Klay had his highest PPG, shot attempts, FG%, 3FG%, and TS% playing WITH Durant. Klay has his biggest years WITH Durant. Good luck finding the same thing with Lebron."
"DMC, Gay, and future Kings SF Kevin Durant, right?"
"saved this post. you actually think that Kevin Durant would not take a max deal, but would opt instead for a $6 mil, one year deal? what a rough take haha"
Kevin Durant in a Sonics Jersey
[Kevin Durant in a Sonics jersey](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b0/00/64/b000645a3cf78a0eba872d2fac7d1310.jpg) probably looks weird to people who weren't watching back then
"it was the age of nephews, it was the age of shitposting, it was the epoch of F5ing, it was the epoch of memes, it was the season of Anthony Davis trade talks, it was the season of Kevin Durant free agency rumors, it was the spring of Kawhi, it was the winter of load management, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to offseason posts, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."
"I buy mostly retired players’ jerseys or the Olympic team jersey or the player’s college jersey.   For example I have a Larry Bird (retired) jersey, a Kevin Durant Team USA jersey, and a Duke Kyrie Irving jersey."
"&gt; I'm pretty sure this is like the 8th user name for that guy who is a crazy Durant fan  8th? lmao try like 18th; looking through my user tags i've got 12 accounts tagged that are 100% him, another 3 that are iffy and then there's probably accounts i've missed during breaks from reddit when i'm not too active. this guy just won't let this shit die, he needs to prove to everyone that kevin durant is the greatest player to live."
Are they Kevin Durant?
"he does weigh more, google height and weight is bullshit, Lebron is known to be 6'9 260+, at one point 274. He's listed on google as 250 which is BS, just as Kevin Durant is listed at 6'9 lol when dude is 7 foot. LeBron is undeniably bigger"
"Warriors didn't sacrifice anything in order to make room for Kevin Durant. They got Javale McGee, David West, Zaza Pachulia, Pat McCaw, Ian Clark over Speights, Barbosa, Festus Ezeli, and Bogut. Not that big of a difference.  Warriors' front office just didn't care enough about the bench, getting complacent with a 5 all star lineup. Never should've let McCaw walk, and should've gave Javale the starting spot while boogie was recovering, instead of taking the gamble on Damian Jones. And Alfonzo makes Nick Young look like a DPOY.  This year was when the bench depth really started to show when they lost all these rotation players."
A truly spectacular piece of shit ballot. Starts off fine and gets exponentially worse  * Kevin Durant * Kawhi Leonard * Nikola Jokic * Kyrie Irving  * Damian Lillard  My running theory is that he thought he was filling out the ballot for All-NBA Second Team
"Kevin Durant is signing a max contract this season. You can go through whatever mental gymnastics you’d like to convince yourself otherwise, but just wait and see."

thats some kevin durant 2019 playoffs scoring averages
Salary cap is set to be 109 million for the 2019/2020 season. Even if Kevin Durant opts out they still have to resign Klay Thompson and a large number of role players. No chance at all Kevin opted out to sign a team friendly deal when they can't use the money anyway.
And this somehow makes him super human?  He will come back flawless from this injury and be just as fast and quick right out the gate for the remainder of his career?  But it’s Kevin Durant.
Best part of your comment is imagining Kevin Durant walking.   Thanks.
it’s Kevin Durant man

"Kevin Durant was also considering going to UNC because Ty Lawson was his HS teammate. Problem was that UNC freshmen class was stacked and the team already had Hansbrough entering his second year. If UNC had a starting lineup of Lawson, Ellington, Durant, Wright, and Hansbrough with that deep ass bench it wouldve easily been an undefeated season."
"Morey is doing the Warriors thing where he front loads with talent and has nothing off the bench with the hope that he can uncover a sneaky productive player like Quinn Cook and Patrick McCaw. The biggest difference is..... The Warriors went into the market and got Kevin Durant..... Jimmy Butler is good but he's high maintenance and not nearly as good as KD. In fact just talent wise, he's the 3rd best player on this team. Say what you will about CP3 but late in the season he turned the fuck up to help turn the Rockets season around."
Kevin Durant is rapidly turning irrelevant tbh
"Curry is a generational talent and player, so is Kevin Durant and Harden. Kawhi proved it after his championship. Basically players that can be the franchise player of a championship team."

"Lebrons entire legacy has been grossly inflated by his collusion and lack of competition in the east.

LeBron has beaten the hawks and demar Derozan"
"I love my Razor scooter and Kevin Durant probably does too. My scooter’s basket is amazing. I store so many items in there like sex tapes, my wallet, my buttplug, etc.""  A man and woman in a wheelchair, who live in nearby Los Angeles, have been looking for a new place to purchase their scooter for a few years because of the expense.  ""We don't have much money, even with my husband's job, so we're looking for help. We're all used to renting out. The rental is usually only for 6 months and doesn't pay overtime, so it's an enormous expense to rent the scooter.""  This type of cost to rent a bike/scooter isn't unusual among the San Luis Obispo area; many scooters are being sold for upwards of $8,000, and it's hard to find a reputable builder who can make and maintain them.  Kevin Durant should start donating scooters."
"I think players who are dominant for the whole decade should have a boost compared to players who broke out in the middle of the decade (Kawhi, Curry) or people who were on their last legs for most of the decade (Dirk, Duncan, Wade).

"The Houston Rockets have issues to resolve this summer after suffering another Western Conference postseason loss to the Golden State Warriors. The Athletic detailed on May 23 the brewing clash of styles within the Rockets and, the tense moments experienced between their two stars James Harden and Chris Paul. Amid the uncertainty, a discussion has formulated about Paul’s future: With three years and almost $125 million left on his deal, what would the Rockets do?  Paul never demanded a trade from the Rockets, league sources tell The Athletic, nor would there be much of a market for one. League sources said Houston officials and Paul met after the season ended in their Game 6 loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals, and both sides discussed the future. Paul informed the Rockets that if they decided to go younger and move in a different direction, he would understand and be a pro about it, according to league sources.  The Rockets let Paul know that their intent was actually the opposite, however: That they wanted to keep him and keep contending in the Western Conference. For Paul, that was all he needed to hear. He’s been committed to the cause in Houston.  The relationship between he and Harden is vital to the Rockets, and both need to continue working toward finding common ground —  both need to help this roster and coaching staff get on the same page.  Paul and Harden have been communicating since the season ended and had a positive conversation on Father’s Day, sources said. According to sources close to Paul and Harden, the two players must continue working toward fixing any issues and accomplish the goals they both have set out: Winning a championship in Houston.  This is the Rockets’ fate for the foreseeable future, like it or not.  They have a window now, with Golden State suffering two devastating injuries in Kevin Durant’s Achilles tendon rupture and Klay Thompson’s torn ACL. The market has not shown to be open for Paul, even as the Rockets quietly discussed him in potential deals within the past few weeks, league sources said. Houston has also discussed center Clint Capela with teams, but as Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has said, Capela remains effective for the franchise and could re-emerge as a critical piece in the playoffs.  For now, the Rockets’ best course of action very well seems to be standing pat, trusting Harden and Paul figure out their issues in personality and style, trusting the coaching staff becomes stable and that the roster can find a balance between ball movement and isolation.  As The Athletic reported on June 20, Houston is expected to headline several teams — including potentially the Lakers and Nets — that will pursue 76ers star free agent Jimmy Butler, according to league sources. The Rockets could pursue Butler with a sign-and-trade package around Capela and Eric Gordon. If the Rockets are unable to swing a deal for a third superstar, Capela assuredly will return next season.  It has never been this open in the Western Conference since the Warriors’ dynasty era began in 2015. The time is now for Houston.  Top free agents still in decision-making mode… Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant and his business partner, Rich Kleiman, have taken a distant approach and haven’t given the top interested teams — the Knicks, Nets, Clippers and Warriors — any signals so far, league sources said. Durant and Kleiman are in New York, and at one point discussed potentially coming to Los Angeles for free-agent meetings, but are expected to remain stationed in New York, according to sources.  Durant has said publicly and privately that he will not be recruited to a team and will sit with his inner circle to determine his next move, a similar approach to the one LeBron James took last offseason when he did not personally meet with any team and decided on the Los Angeles Lakers.  The Warriors and free-agent All-Star Klay Thompson will meet in L.A. this week at the outset of free agency, league sources said. Should the Warriors enter the meeting with the five-year, $190 million maximum contract, both sides expect a quick agreement, according to sources.  Thompson wants to remain with the Warriors, but has been open to speaking with the Los Angeles Clippers if talks break off with Golden State, sources said.  More news and notes from around the NBA … Brooklyn Nets  Forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is expected to receive interest from several teams as an unrestricted free agent — including the Suns, Timberwolves and Rockets, league sources said. Teams view Hollis-Jefferson as a versatile forward, capable of defending all five positions and providing energy in the rotation.  Chicago Bulls  The Bulls are expected to express early interest in free-agent forward Julius Randle, league sources said. Randle is expected to receive interest from several teams, including the Knicks and Nets, according to sources. Coming off his best NBA season, Randle opted out of his $9 million deal for the 2019-20 season. He averaged 21.4 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and shot 34.4 percent from 3-point range on 195 attempts last season.  Dallas Mavericks  Restricted free agent Kristaps Porzingis and the Mavericks will meet at the beginning of free agency on Sunday and there is momentum for the sides to work toward a full five-year, $158 million maximum contract, league sources said. Porzingis has spent the majority of the summer in his native Latvia, and Mavericks officials have spent time with him over the course of the offseason. For the Mavericks and Mark Cuban, the bond built with Porzingis has gone a long way, especially considering teams expected him at one point to sign the one-year qualifying offer.  Indiana Pacers  Free agent guard Cory Joseph has received interest from several teams seeking point-guard help, including Phoenix, Washington, Sacramento and Chicago, league sources said. Joseph averaged 6.6 points and 3.9 assists per game in 82 games last season and is a strong backup option for teams.  Los Angeles Lakers  The Lakers have serious interest in Nets restricted free agent D’Angelo Russell, L.A.’s former No. 2 overall pick and former starting point guard, league sources said. The Lakers’ interest in Russell is real, and has been described as something that the organization has had partly due to their familiarity with Russell. After all, they traded Russell to the Nets in 2017 before drafting Lonzo Ball. Russell has blossomed into an All-Star, a top free agent, and the Lakers would pursue him by utilizing part of the expected $24-28 million in salary cap space. His restricted status will make a potential signing interesting, considering the Nets have the right to match.  New York Knicks  New York is seen as a potential suitor for Celtics restricted free agent Terry Rozier, league sources said. The Knicks are targeting the biggest free agents in July — such as Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard — but will move toward signing high-level rotation players on possible one- or two-year deals should they miss out on the top of their list. For the Knicks, signing second- or third-tier free agents to maximum contracts does not serve as an appeal to other free agents.  Philadelphia 76ers  Tobias Harris is expected to hold free-agent meetings on both the East and West coasts beginning June 30, league sources said. Harris is a priority for the 76ers — and expected to command a maximum-level contract. One team that should express interest in Harris should they miss out on Kawhi Leonard, according to league sources: The Clippers. Harris and the Clippers had a good relationship and Harris had an All-Star caliber season before the trade to the 76ers in February. Brooklyn, Dallas, Denver, Memphis, Minnesota, New Orleans, and Sacramento are expected to also express interest.  Utah Jazz  Utah Jazz forward/center Derrick Favors will enter the free-agency period fielding calls from interested teams as if he will be an unrestricted free agent, agent Wallace Prather told The Athletic. Favors, who has a July 6 date on his $17M contract guarantee for 2019-20, will have a robust market as a free agent with several teams pursuing big men. In 76 games last season, Favors averaged 11.8 points and 7.4 rebounds. He has been a critical part of Utah’s rise into a perennial playoff contender."
"I’m 372 years old and George Washington would dad dick every single basketball player alive just like he did the brits. These modern day players are so soft with their “doctors” and “medicine.” Back in my day if you tore your acl you got your leg amputated and you’d be back in the second half. Hell, I saw players die of botulism midway through games multiple times. You think they got an injury timeout for that? Nope. Play on. Coaches aren’t gonna waste a precious timeout on you. Be better next time and maybe you won’t die so easily. Kevin Durant is not a top 8000 player of all time. You can take that to the bank buster."

"I always hate making those moves in MyCareer, because the team I decide to go to inevitably decides to make roster changes right after I sign. I still remember in 2k17, I did my best to make a Kevin Durant clone and signed in my second year with the Clippers because honestly, how much fun would it have been to have a starting 5 of CP3, Reddick, KD, Blake, and Deandre? That team would be disgusting. Instead, the Clippers released Reddick, traded away Griffin, signed Justice (other story mode character), and turned CP3 into a Sixth Man right after I signed. Pissed me the fuck off. I always thought that if a franchise brings you in as a superstar, you should get roster influence in MyCareer just like you would in real life."
"He’s still Kevin fucking Durant one of the greatest pure scorers of all time. I think even if you get 75% of him back, he’s still good enough to max"
"All-Stars = Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Demarcus Cousins, Draymond Green, and Andre Iquodala.  6 Current or former all stars.  And Kawhi was definitely hobbled, he was running slower and barely jumping at all.  If you watched him before and after his injury you could clearly tell he was nowhere near 100%.  As for other injuries Lowry had a dislocated thumb, Green injured hand/wrist, Siakam injured his calf, Anunoby was out for the whole playoffs, VanVleet had stitches in his eye (left then right) most of the playoffs.  Golden State was nursing worse injuries true, but this was not a 100% Raptors team beating an injured GSW, it was an 80% Raps beating a 70% GSW."

"Yes Cavs win 2017, they had a great bench. 2018 though, a team that has Harrison Barnes and other good overall players like they did in 15 and 16 would definitely beat the rockets and lebron even with his heroics he take them to 6 at the most. You really think I’m wrong Kevin? With the 30+ mil the warriors get a deep bench and a good center which is literally what they lacked when Kd went down this year. Kevin Durant is amazing, not the best though and he probably won’t ever be again unless he recovers from his Achilles injury and is like he was playing last year when he actually “cared” about the season since you insist he didnt this year. Giannis and harden were better in the season during the post kawhi was the best. You can be a huge Durant fan but that doesn’t mean you diminish what kawhi did or the fact that the only season he fully played he was guarded by Patrick Beverley. A guy that’s a whole foot shorter than him."
You’re reaching hard. I’m not wrong. The warriors definitely win 1 if not both without Durant. I’m a huge bron fan he’s my favorite player but that team was special way before Kevin got there. Don’t try to diminish that because you’re a fan of Durant. You keep talking so big about the last 10 finals. How did Durant do in the finals without curry and Thompson ? Of yeah he lost. Kd is Great but not the best in the world. I have a feeling you’re probably his burner reddit account.
"This is exhibit A in the case for outlawing the max. Kevin Durant should get market value, and his market value SHOULD be impacted by being out for a year.   As it stands now, he'll have plenty of max offers to choose from because he is worth so much more than the max, even injured."

"He's Kevin Durant. That's right, you know who he is."
"Genius plan? You don't need to draw up a play to understand that shooting a shit ton of step back 3s isn't generally gonna work in your favor. As far as mid range shots go, the Rockets have two guys that can create from anywhere. CP3 made a living off two dribble pull ups before he went to Houston. If it's there, he should shoot it. Even at his size he has a great in between game. And the biggest thing is taking the ball inside the arc is going to cause the defense to react a lot more than dribbling around 25 feet out. What makes the Warriors so successful is they are looking for the easiest shot. Doesn't matter where it is. Kevin Durant shot around 55% from the mid range area this season. And virtually everyone on the team tries to make cuts to the rim. So while they shoot a lot of threes, they still play inside out"
"Lol. Wade was surrounded by scrubs without a Chris Bosh level teammate. Miami Heat got rid of 10 players to improve the suporting cast around their Big 3 in their prime, domiating in the weak ass East.  Golden State Warriors' had a playoff record of 15-9 in the post-season and couldn't over a healthy Cavs team with Kyrie &amp; Kevin Love despite a 3-1 lead.   Durant has blocked LeBron to surpass MJ as the GOAT in past 3 years."
That's more for players not named Kevin fucking Durant   He'll get the max regardless
I am totally for the redemption arc of Kevin Durant. But can we stop with this revisionist history about his choice about GS? He joined a 73 win team that probably should have won the title. He absolutely obliterated league parity. That is not exactly what people loved to watch him do.
Kevin Durant joins the Raptors!!!
"Why are you ignoring context? *Kevin Durant* was on that team leading them to the finals. Neither Westbrook nor Harden were the best players on that team. You’d have to be crazy to think CP3 wouldn’t get farther in the playoffs if he had Kevin Durant being the best player on his team instead of, you know, himself."

" \*This is going to be my last reply  “The realm of possibility” line is something I think you are taking way too literally. I think it’s pretty clear they were referring to the fact that the previous injury, after treatment and time off, did not give serious increased risk in injury of the achilles. An achilles injury is relatively rare in terms of its occurrence, so him stating that they did not seriously think it was in ""the realm of possibility"" implies that they thought that it's risk was not much different from any other game.   Now of course this is where the medical staff come in when it comes to a possible misdiagnosis. Either two party of doctors, including KD's doc, misdiagnosed it, had a communication breakdown, or they did tell them and everyone is covering it up. This would include \[ Jay Williams\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM3NEjchiS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM3NEjchiS8) )(a member of KD's camp) who explicitly stated he thought after the fact it was a misdiagnosis. This leads me to think that at the very least, all parties were not aware of a serious and excised risk to the achilles and just assumed that the risk factor was similar to any other game. Otherwise Jay and others would be much more angry at Kerr for more than his erratic timetable.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Does KD's silence mean that the Achilles injury really \*wasn't\* ""...in the realm of possibility...""?  &amp;#x200B;  I wasn't using KD's camp's silence as to whether the achilles was a serious risk. I was using their lack of disputation as something that indicates that both sides were on the same page considering the possible risks of playing, otherwise one would expect them to speak up or to \[cut off contact\]( [https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-warriors-havent-had-breakdown-trust-woj-believes](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-warriors-havent-had-breakdown-trust-woj-believes)) with GSW. I don't think either side thought there was relative excised risk to the achilles. That doesn't mean there wasn't actual risk at the end of the day, but it appears that they both had the same information whether it was incorrect or not.  &gt; While I agree that ""bone bruise"" tends to undersell the severity of the injury, that's not the same as suggesting that bone bruise vs. a clinically defined fracture is really just a subjective decision.   I said ""a bit subjective"" which it is, it's not just subjective as there are diagnostic check marks to each diagnosis, but there is subjectivity involved because the difference is based on severity and what tissue the majority of the fracture affects. Second I was just trying to unveil the poor connotation that 'bruise' gives, and I honestly think that's what Andre was doing as well. Nobody would immediately think a 'bone bruise' is a fracture. So Andre going on the record for the second time clarifying that was the case.  Have a good day."

"Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant has declined his $31.5M player option and will become an unrestricted free agent, league sources tell ESPN. Durant and his business manager Rich Kleiman are in New York, evaluating free agency options. So far, process has stayed private."
"True though. Kevin Durant can’t make his medical decisions. That’s why they have professionals. The Thunder staff, you and I should know this better than anyone, would have been safe and conservative with him. This is on the Dubs medical staff if he never fully recovers. They pushed him to clearance and even said won’t affect his injuries long term."
"You can level that disrespect at Kryie but c'mon this is Kevin Durant, y'all know who he is. An offense that has kevin durant is elite by definition. 4 times scoring champ. Let Curry play beside Westbrook on those OKC squads and see the offense be ""historic""."
Its not even close.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/h2h_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2=leonaka01&amp;idx=players
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant would like a word
"If we sign him everyone would laugh at us because he had an Achilles injury  If we don't sign him everyone will laugh at us because he is Kevin Durant  All I have to say is under the sun, each day comes and goes."
"Wilt is a top 5 player of all time but to say he’d be the best by a wide margin is a stretch. Kevin Durant is in his prime and will retire as a top 10 player of all time, his offensive ability is only historically matched by Steph Curry and Shaquille O’Neal. Personally, I rate Wilt in the top 5, but one can very rationally argue Wilt is only top 10, which puts him in range of Kevin’s Durant.  So yes, he would be best or second best, but the margin would not be so enormous as to guarantee him championships for the rest of his career in the league. If this was two or three years ago, he also would be competing with prime Lebron, but that’s not current as he’s out of his prime right now."
"He'll be 32, he turns 31 in a couple months.  Is that ""over the hill"" in general?  No.  Is that ""over the hill"" when he's coming off an Achilles tear?  Hell yes it is.  This has ""Amare"" written all over it and desperate Knick fans still want to go for it because ""he's Kevin Durant"" and ""he's 7 feet tall"" and totally ignore that he's still a human being and an athlete over the age of 30 with a major injury.  The alternative is to be patient and just build a good team with the young guys.  You don't need major free agents to build a good team.  Don't go after mid-tier guys, and don't go after broken goods.  If it isn't somebody who will instantly change the direction of the team (aka, pretty much just Kawhi), I don't want them."
"His game is also predicated on taking people off the dribble with his insane handles and length.  Is he still going to be able to do that off an Achilles tear at 32?  Nobody knows.  If he can, will he still be able to do that through the entire contract?  Nobody knows.  But what you do know is that you're paying for what KD used to be and hoping that he'll still be that just because ""he's Kevin Durant"" or ""he's 7 feet tall""."
"Yeah and the Warriors drafted everyone apart from Kevin Durant.   You are absolutely right in that having a roster of first round talent doesn't guarantee anything. However, it absolutely gives them a chance."
"Raptors are 17-5 without Kawhi. Kawhi had 3 points on 0-4 shooting in Game 6 of the Finals. Fred Vanvleet was the one who closed out the Warriors and the Bucks.   Klay Thompson lit up Kawhi all series and would have been the leading scorer of the finals if he didn't get injured twice and leave two games early. Because the Raptors were already a great team without Kawhi, and could have gotten to the finals and beaten the injured Warriors with last year's roster.  Kevin Durant also in just 11 minutes far outplayed Kawhi."
No. Why? Because he had 3 points on 0-4 shooting in Game 6 of the Finals. Because Fred Vanvleet was the one who closed the Warriors and the Bucks. Because Klay Thompson lit up Kawhi all series and would have been the leading scorer of the finals if he didn't get injured twice and leave two games early.  Kevin Durant also in just 11 minutes far outplayed Kawhi.
"Lol, you say that like ayton is some elite defender   It takes more than athleticism to become an elite defender, especially for a big   How high can their ceiling be? Way higher than any player who is defense first, would you like to take a look at the recent mvps again or are you good?   Stephen Curry was unanimous mvp while being an average defender   Kevin Durant was an average defender for his first mvp   Nash was a below average defender for both of his mvps   Dirk was an average defender for his mvp   Russ was an average defender for his mvp   Harden was an average defender for his mvp   It’s a different league, offense is king.  Luka can be hidden on the other teams worst wing, it’s not a big deal   And Luka can definitely become an above average defender, he just needs to get better conditioned."
kevin durant
"Not to be argumentative but I don’t understand why the Celtics are a good example. Being top heavy with stars still allows you to make it through a big injury. Warriors still had a shot when freaking Kevin Durant went down. It wasn’t until Klay went out also that the chance was all but lost. Your argument with the Celtics is funny. They made conference finals. Cool. You need stars to win it all. This year, the team with the best star left standing won. This is not to say I don’t think a good composition of depth couldn’t work too BUT if LeBron or AD go down and they just have Danny green/Brook Lopez by their side.... Chances are gone completely"
"Yeah that's what it says when you google him, just like how Kevin Durant is 6'9 when you google him. Should I count you in with the ""growth spurt"" theory or ""NBA Commissioners get magic height increases"" theory?"
What about being able to draft FAs too?   “With the 3rd pick the Knicks select Kevin Durant” lmao
Facts? KD is far more referenced in mainstream music than Kyrie? KD sold more jerseys every year until this season. Kevin Durant more endorsement. KD by far more mentioned on twitter. I really don't know what other facts u want lol.
"GSW's Front Office : ""Hey we have an opportunity to either sign Kevin Durant who nearly beat us in the WCF or to give Harrison Barnes $25 million a year after shooting 16% in the last three games of the finals.""   You: ""Hmmm, what a difficult choice."""
"Media market and weather. That's it.   They got two of the biggest free agents on the open market the last three years and the big name players they've acquired in years past like KG, Kyrie, and Shaq have all said good things about the city and fans.   And who are the guys they missed out on? Kevin Durant who wanted the easiest possible path to a title. Anthony Davis who was traded after saying he only wanted to play in LA. Kawhi Leonard who was coming off an injury and traded for the heart and soul of the Raptors. Kyrie who seems like a weird dude who has a history of locker room drama every where he goes."
Every single team will throw every last million of their cap space at KD. It's Kevin fucking Durant.
"The only other 50/40/90 guys (Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Mark Price). So basically some of those guys are good"
That's just a jacked Kevin Durant
This is Kevin Durant isn’t it...
What if Kevin Durant was 5'9?
"Kelly Olynyk broke Kevin Love in the 2015 playoffs.  With Kevin Love, it's possible Kyrie Irving doesn't get hurt, as the team holds on to more depth, and even if he does, the Cavs have a much better shot of beating the Warriors.  Cleveland wins 2015.  If the Cavs beat the Warriors in 2015, in 2016, the Warriors come out just as hungry if not hungrier, but a little less cocky. Maybe Draymond contains his emotions better.  LeBron, meanwhile, already has his Cleveland ring, so he's *not* as hungry, and the league office has less incentive for the level of fuckery that took place that year - instead, there's a great story in the Warriors capping the greatest season in history with a championship, so they don't stack the deck against the Warriors as hard as they did that year.  Warriors win 2016.  At which point Kevin Durant, in all likelihood, does *not* become a Warrior.  A shorter version for averting KD to the Warriors involves the Rockets actually cleaning Motiejunas's back sweat off the court, so Curry doesn't sprain his MCL. This improves his play in the postseason and also lightens the load on the rest of the Warriors and gives a better chance of the Warriors either not losing Bogut to injury, or still winning without him with Steph Curry still in uninterrupted Unanimous MVP Mode.  Warriors win 2016 that way.  Warriors still don't get KD."
"""Kevin durant achilles! What a night! There was a lot of fun at the game. It was fun to watch everyone fight (the fans). That's something I definitely look forward to in the future."" -- Raptors GM Masai Ujiri"
"Kevin Durant like, nah, I think I'm staying in ~~Oakland~~, San Francisco. Fuck me, thats what i get for dissing as an Oakland resident."
Yup. This. Agree with u/nalydpsycho What’s fucked up was that ESPN literally ran a graphic of Portland taking that one dude that was a bust over Michael Jordan and they talked in depth about how great Kevin Durant is and what he is doing but they can see why Oden would be too enticing for Portland to pass up. What happens? Oden no. 1 &amp; seems like a great dude from the get go -endorsing Obama and fun dude(new Shaq!)- and bam! Bust.
Lol a team that got eliminated by him the complete opposite to Kevin Durant...
"That really made me smile. Seemed like such a humble, genuine guy. Really wishing the best for him, hope he can fill out even just to like Kevin Durant levels of muscle. He's really skilled from what I've seen so I'm rooting for him"
Warriors taking Bol Bol to replace Kevin Durant.
"JJJ, Morant, and the Brazilian Kevin Durant"
"oden at the very least could’ve been very good if he didn’t have injury trouble. never kevin durant level, but very solid."
"""We either get the best player or Kevin Durant"""
Not really. If he was Kevin Durant 2.0 he would be a top pick... like Kyrie was when he was injured.
"Why does everyone keep saying Bol Bol is Kevin Durant? If he was, he would have been a top 2 pick."
Kevin Durant weighs more than 2Bol
So... A 7'3 Kevin Durant?
So a 7'3 Kevin Durant?
Bol Bol is a 7’3 Kevin Durant with a concerning foot injury
"They are, but god damn that hurt to see. TBH it should have said “everyone(starters and bench) AND KEVIN DURANT”"
Kevin Porter Jr reminds me of a mix of Kevin Durant and Michael Porter Jr
Whos cams comp gonna be? Kevin durant? Lol
BolBol comp: Love child of Kevin Durant and a Trebuchet
His dad looks like an older Kevin Durant
"You talk like you know, but no one does. I watched tape and I see a bigger Kevin Durant. His shot motion is smooth and he uses his length to his advantage with his jump shot. He can also get around defenders to the rim with his lateral quickness and surprisingly good footwork. He just reminds me of him the way he creates his shots. You are entitled to your opinion, but at least show that you put some thought into your reply."
You guys had to gamble. Lose Kevin Durant and your chances of having him were 0 beyond a doubt.
"There has only been 3 players to win college player of the year as a rookie...kevin durant, anthony davis and zion Williamson...thats pretty good company to be in"
Kevin Durant opts in and is traded to Nola.
If anyone can come back the same and maybe even get better it’s Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant blew a 3-1 lead against the Warriors in the 2016 WCF on purpose to have a reason to leave OKC
Its pretty close tbh. People dont give Larry enough credit now a days. The guy was basically the Kevin Durant of his day except a little better honestly. If he played with todays rules he would be ridiculous.     People also forget that Bird won 3 consecutive MVPs during both his and Magics prime. And he legitimately had a case to be considered the GOAT until Michael showed up.     If Larry was black and did the same thing I think people today would be a little more in the lane of thinking he was better than Magic tbh. I think race does play a part of it unfortunately.
Ingram is an underrated defender for his build as well. He can bother big men in the same way Patrick Beverley can bother Kevin Durant or LeBron. (it wasn't big news for some reason but PatBev *shut down* LeBron one game last season.) If they get another big man we could be looking at the best defensive team in the league next season.
"It’s not an actual scientific dichotomy like it is in other species, but it’s usually just meant as someone more assertive and confident vs someone more meek. Ex: Snapchat penis guy draymond green vs Kevin Durant"
In conclusion: Patrick Beverley is responsible for Kevin Durant coming to Golden State
"One of my favorite things about basketball is how expressive players can be in how they play. I highly recommend watching highlights of some of the game's best right now. Try to observe how they all approach the game differently.   The guys I'd start with are:  LeBron James  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Giannis  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Joel Embiid  Nikola Jokic  If you really want to break down the subtleties in their games, By Any Means Basketball is a great youtube channel for this.   From there, Thinking Basketball, Coach Daniel, and BBallBreakdown are great channels for learning some of the basic plays, strategies, and philosophies behind the game."
IMO best playerd drafted since lebron are kevin durant and luka doncic
"Is Kevin Durant the only FA out there? There are still free agents we can sign, not for the max. But just solid role players that can help our young guys and help us at least be a little more competitive"

&gt; Bol Bol has the potential to be a better Kevin Durant  imagine typing this sentence lmao
Kevin Durant died man
Kevin Durant says goodbye
"You are prob joking, but the only Messi/Christiano Players would be Lebron/Kevin Durant. Kawhi a very very close second (Hazard)"
Kevin Durant says hello
"Bol Bol has the potential to be a better Kevin Durant.  Obviously his big flag is health, but his ceiling is only outmatched by Zion in this draft. He could legitimately transform a franchise that gets him and lets him develop into a big wing defender, not expecting him to live in the paint despite being 7' 2."
"and for some reason this 41st pick will become another Kevin Durant or at least a Jordan Bell quality bench players, thanks a lot Atlanta"
"Kevin Durant. Not because of the snake, but because I wanted to see his thunder vs Lebrons cavs and couldn’t cause he broke his foot"
"Kyrie is not better than 2 of the following:  LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Paul George, Damian Lillard"
So you think that  1) Having a few role players for half a season is better than having Kevin Durant for 5 years.  2) Kevin Durant is better off being traded to a team that lost assets for him instead of signing with them like a normal free agent.  3) Kevin Durant will agree to this plan.     Its definitely nephew season.
"Dominique returned very well. Sure, that's an outlier. But it's Kevin fucking Durant bro."
"&gt;never mind he said the Knicks will be ok.   Yeah I don't want to pile on the Knicks here, but what exactly does he see that points to a bright future for NYK??   Even if they sign Durant, he is out next season, and who knows the player he will be once he recovers from a *ruptured* achilles. And sure, Kevin Knox is a nice young player, but unless he makes several *huge* leaps in his game the next few seasons, he's nothing more than a nice piece on a contender.   As long as Dolan owns the team, the Knicks will be a rudderless ship. I feel the same way about Jerry Reinsdorf and the Bulls as well."
"If you want to make some of your own, this is probably the site the guy used, if not it's very similar.   https://talktotransformer.com/  Here's a few I made.  **James Harden**  &gt; James Harden smells his armpit with a sigh of relief. ""I'm so sorry,"" he says. ""There was nothing I could done to make it stop. The ball had already touched the roof and I was so confused that it just bounced around."" &gt;  &gt; ""You're right,"" the coach says. ""The roof is broken, but it's okay. I can fix it right now, and it will work fine."" And without a word, he's gone. &gt;  &gt; It's a sad state of affairs that this time, though, the referee decided to take no action, though, that doesn't do anything to lessen the disappointment on the players' voices. &gt;  &gt; When the score was down, they were right to be angry. When the game was over, Harden didn't win. He won the game. His teammate Kevin Durant scored 34 points in 33 minutes. &gt;  &gt; And when his teammate Durant did score, it was like watching a great game of Russian roulette on the court, with no winner. But he didn't win the game either.  **Blake Griffin**  &gt; Back in the classroom, Blake begins to give the rest an earful. ""Why do you always carry things into the room? I get sick of it too."" Her tone is heavy, and a little too loud, Blake's voice is trying to get out of Blake's head. &gt;  &gt; Blake takes a deep breath, and tries to calm down. ""Because I hate it when you tell us everything. My whole life. All the little jokes that I want to avoid. How you're a huge ass."" &gt;  &gt; Blake gives a big sigh, and tries to look serious. She really doesn't want to hear this. &gt;  &gt; ""Because I can't tell you anything about people I've never met even once."" She continues. &gt;  &gt; Blake gives Blake a slightly annoyed look. ""You're saying you don't care?"" &gt;  &gt; ""I hate having to tell you everything you're ever doing, when you know it is a lie."" &gt;  &gt; Blake gives Blake a slightly annoyed look again, this time just the tip of her  **LeBron James** &gt;  &gt; LeBron James hears a noise travel from upwind which triggers him to stuff away the sacred burrito back into his jockstrap bag. He takes his time eating to a full meal, then throws up on the couch with the couch. &gt;  &gt; ""He's a real gentleman, dude."" He says as he takes another sip of the beer. &gt;  &gt; LeBron James is a gentleman. &gt;  &gt; When LeBron James says this, I can see the anger coming from his face. This isn't true, my friend, as it is only half true. This story has been around for years, and there is no actual documentation supporting it. LeBron James has a tendency to exaggerate his feelings, especially when it comes to the sports he plays. However, when he takes his business elsewhere, I am convinced he will be rewarded with another amazing story. His stories will be like the stories that get him invited to an elite party every year, the stories that get him sent back"
Dray said that wasn't an accurate report.  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/draymond-green-denies-report-he-visited-kevin-durant-new-york
"What he searching for? He knows who he is, he's Kevin Durant!"
"Man it’s almost like James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka all on one team. How incredible that would be!"
&gt;the Knicks would agree to any terms that gets them Kevin Durant  ya that’s horseshit
"They wouldn’t really have to negotiate with the Knicks at all, the Knicks would agree to any terms that gets them Kevin Durant. The Warriors and KD would have to write something down on paper I imagine"
"behind only James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.  its pronounced James (like Hummus)!!!"
"The spurs signed lma, houston cp3, okc pg, miami wasnt a hig market and pulled the big 3, the frigging warriors signed kevin durant...that last one its mind boggling if I told you 6 years ago. The bulls biggest free agent signing ever was prob old fart dwade. It certainly hasnt helped the knicks either"
"39/5/5 in the stretch after saying ""I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am."" Just a horrible thing to happen but if anyone can come back and still be effective it's him."
"James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.  Ah yes, good ol James."
"&gt;James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant  Ah yes, my favorite players. LeBron, Harden, Westbrook, Durant, and James. I love James.  &gt;Paul George's next season will be very different as well. If they can get the roster together, and manage to find the right mix of players with the same philosophy for the season that they should, then they can win in an exciting, entertaining way. This team is going to be a major challenge for the Bruins.  This one was so good until the Bruins came up"
Kevin Durant at 80% of what he was is still a top 20 player in the league and a bunch of top 20 players are getting maxed.
"&gt;He's sixth in offensive PER for starters, behind only James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. There isn't much better in the league besides that stat  The AI didn't have to attack all of r/nba like that"
"What makes the Warriors win now?  1. Steph Curry, of course.  2. Stephen Curry.  3. Kevin Durant.  4. Klay Thompson.  5. Russell Westbrook."
"""Not only are the Raptors fans incredibly obscene and disrespectful Shannon, but Masai Ujiri himself has said he enjoyed watching Kevin Durant get hurt! This city is ridiculous, no wonder my sources are telling me Kawhi killed himself in his sleep. I would too if I had to deal with such belligerent animals!"""
[Wojnarowski] The Los Angeles Lakers are no longer in contention for the 2020 championship. Drastic shift in plans. Story to come on #ESPN    ...   [Charania] The Los Angeles Lakers have recieved verbal confirmation from both Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant they will sign into the remaining cap space left after the Anthony Davis trade. Championship focus shifted to 2021 season   ...  [Wojnarowski] Lakers really got their guys #holyshit
Bro from a roster standpoint it is not better to lose Kevin Durant lol. Assuming klay comes back they’re over the cap anyway and Kevin Durant is like so good at basketball. Maybe they miss a year but kd is still younger than bron and really not reliant on athleticism to get good shots. Like yeah the salary’s gonna be pretty high next year and they won’t be the favorites with Durant our but when he’s back like worst-case he’s basically dirk scoring on the post and hitting jumpers and I expect he’ll still be a better defender and passer than dirk ever was. Like you really gotta run it back with as much as you can when you luck into multiple generational talents and the chance for this franchise to get like 5 rings.
"&gt;He's sixth in offensive PER for starters, behind only James, James Harden, LeBron, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant  James so good he made it twice"
"&gt; ""Kevin durant achilles! What a night! There was a lot of fun at the game. It was fun to watch everyone fight (the fans). That's something I definitely look forward to in the future."" -- Raptors GM Masai Ujiri  incredible, simply incredible"
"haha yes, kevin durant is DEFINITELY 6'9"""
"""kevin durant achilles! what a night!""  jesus fucking christ robot masai ujiri"
"What a horrible comparison. Any team in the league would give Kevin Durant a max deal, he’s one of the greatest players in the history of basketball. Of course they’re giving Klay a deal, he’s a top 3 shooter of all time and been in Golden State for 9 years! Both players have won multiple finals for their city.   IT was in Boston for 2 whole years after being traded for nothing. He’s said several times that nobody was stopping him from playing. What are the Celtics supposed to do?   The people that criticize Ainge for “doing IT dirty” are the same people that would be clowning the Celtics for giving a 5’9, defensive liability, and 30 year old, a 4 year max deal. Don’t forget he wanted the brinks truck backed up. That contract would absolutely fuck the franchise. Give me a break dude.   Any GM in the league would trade him for Kyrie Irving, an established star who’s proven to be one of the most clutch players in the league. Did it suck for IT? Sure, but don’t act like they snuck behind his back to betray him.  Danny even traded him to the team that was close to guaranteed another trip to the finals."
"Kawhi Leonard has re-signed with Toronto on a 4 year min deal and convinced Kemba Walker, Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant to do the same."
"And three days later he said he didn't know what he was thinking that night and maybe he drank too much champagne  &gt; ""You know, I was just thinkin' crazy stuff,"" Durant said. ""I don't know why I said it -- maybe it was too much champagne that night. I don't know, I probably shouldn't have said that.""   https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-retiring-35-maybe-it-was-too-much-champagne-night"
"Steph Curry is more injury prone by your perspective and Kevin Durant is at 86%, Kobe Bryant was at 82%, Michael Jordan 87%, Shaq 72%, Kawhi 72%.... so yeah, I’ll take 81% of Anthony Davis you clown"
"Right now Kevin Durant is probably enjoying a glass of scotch while reclining in his alligator skin office chair, thinking about how much karma and goodwill he's just accrued...meanwhile you now have Knicks fans all across the city of New York who are probably wondering what Vicks Vaporub tastes like when spread over a piece of toast. Take a fucking bow, KD. This is your Hamlet"
"&gt; Kevin Durant actually doesn't ""jump"" to make his jumpshot,  pure stupidity."
Because he’s Kevin Durant
"Diminished Kevin Durant &gt;&gt; Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris who both received max contracts"
Kevin Durant is a transcendent talent and you take a chance on a guy like that no matter what.
"If you noticed, Kevin Durant actually doesn't ""jump"" to make his jumpshot, he's just tall. Even if he doesn't get the athleticism right away, he's gonna still be able to score at will"
Kevin Durant. They both signed with their old teams and then got swapped along with a few fillers.
"Didn't Livingston already say he's retiring? Igoudala is old, but they have a solid enough 2nd team that their all-star players can make it work. My understanding is, if Livingston retires and Looney re-signs, their team is still very good. Golden State always epitomized position fluidity, and you can see it in their roster, with no real position-defined players besides their small forwards, barring any movement.  C/PF: Draymond Green, Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko (they have other players listed at PF/SF, but quite frankly I'm not sure they've ever played NBA minutes). SF (clearly where they are thinnest): Damion Lee, Treveon Graham.  Add young guys Alen Smailagić (C/PF), Marcus Derrickson (PF/SF), Eric Paschall (PF/SF).  Guards: Steph Curry, D'Angelo Russell, Quinn Cook, Shabazz Napier.  Add young guys like Jacob Evans, Jordan Poole.  Are these young players sexy names? No. But they're all NBA talents, they're nearly all 1st round draft picks, and they're all super young with little NBA experience. I think the only reason people view this roster as bad is because of how legendary these past couple GS rosters were.  Steve Kerr is really going to sink or swim this season I think. However, GS still has some of the best top 3 players for any roster in the NBA. How deep does your second unit have to be?  I say this all open-ended because I'm not a GS fan, nor do I know the future of these young players. Yet I find it silly that people think none of these 18-21 year old players can become something good. I think Alen Smailagić if./when he comes over will surprise people as a young player. I think Golden State will have no issue making the play-offs this year, but may not be a top 2 seed. I don't think Klay will play this season at all, but I think he will return for the play-offs -- if you don't see him play, you can't speak upon his possible impact.  I also think that Steph and Draymond are two of the hardest working players who actually get *it*. And they perform in the clutch. Draymond's offense was never there, people who saying he has gotten worse I think are over-estimating how good his offense previously was. He psyches himself out on open shots moreso nowadays, but besides that he's a similar offensive player to how he's always been, he just never got any better. But on defense? This guy is fucking incredible. He's like the 6'8"" Kyle Loiwry, but with twice the aggression and half the chance of getting called for a foul or T'd up. He's unreal.  When you have the literal shooter or however you want to label Steph Curry as, ever, you will win.  When you have one of the best defensive players ever in Draymond, ever, you will win.  Add D'Lo to the mix and I don't see how people don't see a squad here? I totally understand that their team is not as good as it was 4 years ago when all their players were in their prime. I understand that they just lost Kevin Durant, the epitome of an irreplaceable player. They aren't as good as previous renditions of Golden State. However, they're still clearly a top 10 team in the league. They haven't fallen off a cliff."
"No way. Chuck starts out as a born-rich heel, but grows into one of the most competent and morally serious characters in the show. Dan is the early fan favorite scrappy upstart who turns out to be a total snake. Part of his heel turn is joining the golden haired van der woodsen superteam. He has secret burner accounts that he uses to raise his social profile and to trash other people. And he’s connected to Brooklyn, like current Brooklyn Net Kevin Durant."
"Lol because it seems like you literally don’t understand  the salary cap and what a SIGN AND TRADE is. The warriors are using Kevin Durant as a SIGN AND TRADE with the nets to get Russell which allows them to go over the salary cap to acquire him. If they didn’t do this they essentially lose Durant for nothing and are still over the salary cap and CAN only sign get minimum contracts with a MLE. The warriors currently have no assets outside of Steph, Klay, and Dray that will allow them to acquire any meaningful players in a trade. So no they could not add depth to their roster. Your point about cousins makes zero sense as he was coming off of two major injuries while playing as the 4th option on a championship team. You keep talking about the finals and playoffs, but the warriors are just looking to make it through the regular season next year. They had a old veteran team and they needed to get younger. Iggy is 36 years old and injury prone, you cannot expect him to play 30 mpg for 82 games."
Kevin Durant flew straight to the New York area from San Francisco. But he wasn't  going to pitch James Dolan on why he should be maxed with the Knicks. It was already too late. And Durant didn't  turn the jet around or cancel the trip. It was about Brooklyn. It was about the Nets.
"For those on a budget....  ———  Stephen Curry flew straight to the New York area from Shanghai, China. But he wasn’t going to pitch Kevin Durant on why he should stay with the Warriors. It was already too late. He was on the plane when the news broke that Durant was leaving for Brooklyn.  And Curry didn’t turn the jet around or cancel the trip. Because it wasn’t about recruiting. It was about respect. It was about thanks.  It was easy to presume that if anyone could sway Durant, Curry would be the one. The point guard has been the Warriors’ biggest magnet, drawing the key pieces to the dynasty, including Durant and Andre Iguodala and coach Steve Kerr. It was Curry’s mojo that built this. It was his stamp of approval that sealed Durant’s arrival. His trip to New York was seen as a last-ditch effort to keep Durant.  But Curry went to have one last moment with Durant as teammates. To tell him one more time how much he appreciated him for the three years they had. They’d won two championships together. Dominated the league together. Made history together. He was there to wish Durant happiness and peace, express his support for his decision. And when Curry got to Durant’s apartment in Manhattan, Durant confirmed to Curry his decision that their time together was over. Face to face. Man to man. Friend to friend.  Neither Curry nor Durant responded to requests for comment. But what was probably unsaid, though, was what could have been. This moment illustrated one of the reasons, perhaps a significant one, Durant left — because Curry and Durant never really got to become Curry and Durant. It might have been the only thing that truly could have kept Durant in the Bay.  “He wanted that type of relationship,” said one source friendly with Durant. “It just didn’t work out like that.”  Durant had so many options in free agency, it was nearly impossible to know what he wanted. He made sure of that, too, by keeping his desires close to the vest and challenging anyone who presumed to know what he coveted.  But since he has decided, accepting a free-agent contract offer to play for the Brooklyn Nets and the teams later working out a sign-and-trade that sends D’Angelo Russell to the Warriors, some of the mystery has been uncovered. It wasn’t about money for Durant. He turned down the most he could get, which was $221 million from the Warriors, even with an Achilles injury that threatens his future earning potential. It wasn’t about the best opportunity to win a championship. While Brooklyn will now be a major player in the East, the Warriors were a proven championship contender on the cusp of a three-peat before injuries. An argument can be made that the Nets are younger and the Eastern Conference is an easier route, but those advantages pale in comparison to the experience and chemistry the Warriors core had already developed.  And this, clearly, wasn’t primarily about validating his legacy either. Undoubtedly, Durant has some critics he wants to rebut. But the biggest answer to his naysayers, the sure-fire way to make him the most legendary figure he could be, was to revive the Knicks. He passed on that, too.  Multiple sources have said for months Durant and Kyrie Irving planned on being teammates. Durant wanted them to join the Knicks together while Irving preferred they take over Brooklyn. They are now both Nets.  The decision by Durant revealed what he valued most: friendship. That DeAndre Jordan, another of Durant’s close friends, is also joining them in Brooklyn, reportedly, underscores exactly what was most important in Durant’s heart.  The money? He has plenty of it and will get plenty more. The winning? You can bet he is sure they are championship-worthy. The legacy? Like he said before, y’all know who he is.  It seems the real driving force was the opportunity to play with his good friends. It’s not surprising that such an opportunity matters to Durant. It always has, since he was a kid on the PG Jaguars AAU team. Camaraderie, fellowship, loyalty — truth is, these things have always been preeminent for Durant, even if some other desires and determinations tend to get in the way sometimes. He’s still a guy who wants to hoop at high levels with his homies.  If that was his greatest desire, it makes sense why he’s leaving — that was the one thing the Warriors couldn’t give him.  Durant came to the Warriors in search of a bond. Three years ago, when they met in the Hamptons, the visible unity the Warriors displayed stood out to him. They were four dudes who enjoyed each other and let that connection infect their play. Durant especially wanted that bond with Curry. That’s what drew him, according to many behind the scenes.  On paper, it made perfect sense. They are two humble guys, two players with a reputation for being selfless and easy going, two players who poured themselves into the game and have legendary work ethics.  But it never happened, not in the way that would keep Durant with the Warriors. To be sure, they got along. There was no behind-the-scenes fighting to speak of between the two. Ask Curry about Durant, he will rave about his talent and his heart. Ask Durant about Curry, he will lavish him heavily with praise. They were cool with each other. Still are. But their relationship could only go so deep because of their circumstances.  The biggest issue was timing. Durant arrived when Curry was 28 with two young daughters. Curry’s emphasis on being a family man cuts into his ability to be especially close with new people. Plus, Curry keeps a familial hedge around him. His entourage is mostly blood relatives, in-laws, close friends, business partners and employees. While his teammates are usually welcome, being with Curry requires being with his family.  Durant came to the Warriors a single man, new to the area and a free spirit. Their lives were in completely different spaces. Their hobbies were different. Durant, too, had his family and close friends around him. But as they faded from the forefront — his mother, Wanda, his brother, Tony, and his childhood friend Charlie Bell were far less visible in the Bay the last two years — Durant was left with his business partner Rich Kleiman and longtime friend and trainer Randy Williams, along with his Nike reps.  Durant is not the type to force his way into situations. If he meets too much resistance, or doesn’t feel the vibe, he is much more inclined to fall back.  They were friendly when together. They laughed incessantly. They supported each other. On many occasions, Durant used his platform to be supportive of Curry, buck back at his critics. Curry went out of his way to make Durant feel welcome. They both tried.  However, another reason they couldn’t bond fully was because they were often being pitted against each other.  Definitely by the fans, and in the space Durant frequents: social media. Even when Durant announced he was signing with the Warriors, on Independence Day 2016, while many Warriors fans celebrated, others contended the Warriors didn’t need Durant. Many fell in love with the 2015 and 2016 Warriors and scoffed when the team gave up its depth for Durant.  When the Warriors struggled, those struggles were pinned on Durant. His style of play was criticized. And Curry was the light under which Durant was scrutinized.  It wasn’t just fans. The media was complicit in presenting the Curry vs. Durant narrative, nationally and locally. The debate of who was the team’s best player continued in the background. How the team performed with either Curry or Durant absent was under constant watch.  And then there was the offense. Who runs it? Who has the ball in his hands? Who ends up iced out while the other gets fed? This discussion never ended.  Systemically, they had some issues. The Warriors preferred to move the ball, create offense by creating seams with motion. While Durant could play that game, that wasn’t his preferred style, especially when paired with players who couldn’t take advantage of the openings. And, invariably, Durant would get frozen out while Curry and Klay Thompson jacked up shots that would be ill-advised for others but were the foundation of what the Warriors built. And when the offense ran through Durant and it didn’t work, Durant took the heat.  All of it was fair game. Criticism, analysis, opinions — it’s part of the basketball landscape. It could be argued Durant should have been able to block it out, handle it better. It could be argued the Warriors should have adjusted the offense, adapted to its players. But the greater question is what was making Durant feel connected when everything else was trying to pull them apart?  That’s where friendship comes in. That’s where chemistry and the bond of players become valuable. The Warriors and Durant couldn’t build in three years, under the most intense of heat, the kind of bond that would survive all this. It was probably too much to ask from the beginning if that’s what indeed mattered most to Durant.  The original Warriors core isn’t as connected off the court as it may seem. None of them are inseparable away from the game. Each of their lives pulls them in different directions. Curry has his family. Draymond Green became a dad in 2016, altering his life significantly. Iguodala, who is also now on his way out with a trade to the Memphis Grizzlies, and Shaun Livingston also have their own families. And Thompson did his bachelor thing.  Probably the players who spend the most time together, away from team events, are Curry and Iguodala on the golf course."
He's coming to the nets to finally play with old pal Kevin Durant
$10 says D'Angelo has a higher PPG than Kevin Durant this year
Luckily that team had a Kevin Durant that wanted to play for Brooklyn lol. This wasn't like Charlotte snagged him out of nowhere.
"It is when it's a top plate like Kevin Durant. Woukd this discussion be had if LeBron blew out his Achilles at 30?  My hunch, no. Just the Marquee name alone would make the Knicks way more money. Same with Durant. Even if it doesn't pan out on the court, it should pan out every where else."
"Ah yes, Kevin ""Historically bad shooting percentages"" Knox and Mitchell ""One dimensional Game"" Robinson are really gonna be franchise headers. Have fun crying about Durant, Kyrie, and Zion you bum ass franchise. It's funny that you are literally worse than the Timberwolves despite being the biggest market in the league."
Kevin Durant was never going to the Knicks. It doesn't matter what they say. I wish this sub would use some critical thinking.
Bruh that’s because Curry was playing with fucking Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant. DLo was playing with...? I literally can’t even think of another player on that team.
Steph Curry also had Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on his team
1. KD 2. Kevin Durant 3. The Snake
"I mean I'd be worried about it too, but I'd roll that dice every God damn time for the chance at Kevin Durant or anyone of his caliber."
"Lol no.. you pay a top 15 player of all time, and arguably the best player the Knicks have ever had the fucking max. KD is a freak he’s going to come back as at worst a top 10 player in the league. If not, no one, literally no one, is going to blame you for signing Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant...?
Kevin Durant
they get kevin durant. he wanted to help the warriors i guess?
Kevin mother fuckin Durant lol
Kevin Durant. He could’ve said he wouldn’t do it unless they sign and trade
Is Kevin Durant immune to Achilles injuries?
Because you take that chance on a guy like Kevin Durant
it’s kevin durant
"""It's gonna be completely nuts, but it's also gonna be awesome,"" Atkinson said. ""The whole city's gonna be behind us. We're gonna be on SportsCenter every night. If we lose, it's gonna be the end of the world. If we win, it's gonna be wild. But no matter what, it's gonna be fun.""  And so, Atkinson went outside and sat by the pool while the rest of his family slept. It was finally quiet enough for him to think.  ""I sat under the stars and said to myself, 'Damn, we got Kevin Durant on our team,'"" he said. ""'The biggest snake in the world is a Net.”’"
"Thank you for the notification that the Warriors are, in fact, worse with D'Angelo Russell than they were with Kevin Durant."
Do you actually have faith that Knicks won't sign a bad contract with someone else? Someone that has significantly less potential then if kd comes back healthy.   Best case scenario right. That the Knicks can get to Orlando magics level in a 2 or 3 seasons.   Dont jeopardize your chance at an 8th seed to sign kevin Durant.
Kevin durant
Signing Kyrie and a guy named Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant will be an anchor for this team for the next for for years.   Feel free to choose either interpretation as a quantum field superposition.
I mean besides some guy named Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant the best player to never get a max contract
Kevin Durant.
All of these guys at least get second opinions. There’s way to much at stake to trust an organization who’s goals may not align with the player’s.    https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/steve-kerr-denies-that-kevin-durant-is-unhappy-with-warriors-doctors/ar-AADw4Vy    &gt;	We had not only our staff but Kevin’s own personal specialist and then a third independent specialist all clear him to play
Nah give me Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant any day of the week. Are you seriously saying you’d rather have Julius Randle and a rookie RJ Barrett over two top 10 players in the league? And all you have to do is wait 1 year to get KD back at full strength? You are trippin.
Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant has a torn achillies.
Do you not remember anything leading up to the trade for Kawhi? Do you think there was no issue with Kawhi and Spurs management? They just decided to trade their star player because the Raptors asked? How is signing two HOFers a knee jerk reaction? Its Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for goodness sake. Your team owner apologized about not signing anyone of interest. What kind of shit narrative is “the Knicks are smart for not signing a top tier agent”? How long does New York have to wait? Who/what are they waiting for? Is there some draft pick you’re banking on taking you to the promised land? You’re just a bitter nephew.
"yeah, based on your history with injury-ridden players, I understand. but thats Kevin *fucking* Durant"
"He absolutely did dude, it just sucked complete ass. https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-announcement  &gt;I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me. It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging  &gt;I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community. They have always had my back unconditionally, and I cannot be more grateful for what they have meant to my family and to me."
"Ok, but the year after that they're going to get back this guy named Kevin Durant..."
and he already[ thanked us](https://twitter.com/SBNation/status/877580632955785216/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E877580632955785216&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.12up.com%2Fposts%2F5170507-kevin-durant-angers-okc-again-by-thanking-warriors-in-full-page-ad)
"Lol.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-injury-update-orthopedic-surgeon-says-warriors-star-likely-out-deep-into-conference-finals/  &gt;if he were to come back on a partially-healed calf, and then end up tearing it all the way by landing or taking off wrong, now you're talking about potentially never coming back 100 percent. He would regret that decision the rest of his career.  Weeks before the injury."
"Are we calling him a 3? Let's do that since it's a weaker talent pool.  I'd rate Covington, Ingram, Richardson, Porter, Ingles, Middleton, George (if we call him a 3), Doncic (again, if we call him a 3), Butler, Kawhi, and if we call them 3s, Durant and LeBron over him. I'd probably put Bojan Bogdanovic over him too. And for this coming season, I'd rather have Kevin Knox."
Whatever dude. I'm not gonna set a reminder for 35 years to prove i'm right lol. Kevin fucking Durant is getting his jersey retired by every single team he plays for even if he's just doing summer league for them at 55 years old.
Taahahj GibSON is not Kevin Durant! I cried SO MUCH today I have no more tears left.- SAS (Arianna Grande)
They're behaving reasonably for a change. 32 year old coming back from a FUCKING ACHILLES TEAR is a risk and not worth the max. Dig up the number of stars who returned to form after an Achilles tear. You gotta put up a more logical argument than:  # ....bUt It'S kEvIn DuRaNt!!!! *wipes nose on sleeve*  &amp;#x200B;  The bratty obnoxious reaction from fans(?)/media is why that team can't have nice shit.
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"""I want to get paid and stop taking discounts...I MEAN Kevin Durant would like to make more money and stop taking discounts."" -Kevin Durant NOT a burner I swear"
"If you look at the history of players coming back from this injury, it is really bad. No one comes back and is even 80% of what they were before. The rare exception was Dominique Wilkins. [But this article goes through all the Achilles tears franchise players have suffered](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Kevin-Durant-injury-How-NBA-stars-have-returned-13969615.php), and pretty much none of them recovered to the players they were before.  &gt; A 2013 Drexel University study found that seven of the 18 NBA players with Achilles tears between 1988 and 2011 did not return at all. Three came back for just one season. Those who did come back missed an average of 56 games the rest of their career; only eight of them played a second season. Those who were able to keep playing saw their minutes and performances fall markedly.  I have no reason to believe Durant will be a special case. I am glad the Knicks didn't sign him, and I LOVE Durant, I have been a huge fan of his since he was in college."
Kevin Durant (Nets) still looks surreal to me
Lol dont compare 40 year old Karl Malone to Kevin Durant
I 100% think that Kevin Durant has not been past his injury for 2 years
Can someone tell me how much money Kevin Durant really turned down now by leaving the Warriors?
"&gt;100% of players aren’t Kevin Durant    Yes, and the chances of him never being the same and being out of the league in few years, is A LOT higher.. because of his height and bad history of all the nagging knee and foot injuries. Now the achilles injury was the nail in the coffin  &gt;  KD will still be a great player, because of his height advantage and shooting/scoring ability from anywhere.. but if he feels even a LITTLE discomfort around that achilles region, that will be it.   &gt;  Even Kyrie is injury prone and already had a lot of surgeries. Knicks will get clowned as usual right now, but they might win in the long game, while Nets will be stuck with 2 superstars with a fat contract, who will spend more time off the court than on the court, due to injuries.   &gt;  It's a huge gamble, for both the Nets and the Knicks.   &gt;  But yes, KD is worth the risk, atleast for now"
Kevin Durant is the nicest player in the NBA
"If you ever been a Nets fan and on one day sign Kyrie and Kevin Durant, you’d be OK with it. I promise"
"Ummm, I'm pretty sure 100% of the other players aren't Kevin Durant."
LeBron - Cleveland and Miami  Dr J - Nets and Sixers  Moses Malone - Houston and Sixers  Kevin Durant - OKC and GS  Kevin Garnett - Minnesota and Boston
It just says he’s Kevin Durant
Julius Randle + Taj Gibson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin Durant
"It's Kevin Durant after a no show year coming off an Achilles injury. Sure, he's one of the best players of the game, but when he comes back he's not going to be near the level of game changer he used to be."
Kobe was way older cousins is way bigger and still recovering and Rudy gay is not 7 foot tall Kevin Durant

"I swear I remember a Jay Z lyric “Kevin Durant you’re coming with me”, but now I can’t find it. Does it ring a bell for anyone?"
"It just funny that you were so convinced that Kevin Durant would choose a one year 6-8 mil deal haha, and honestly “we all lost this one” is silly, this doesn’t affect me in any way whatsoever"
"I don't care how long the list is. If you have the chance to sign Kevin Durant you do it. The Warriors, Nets, Clippers weren't scared at all. You think they're talking about the Achilles in the Nets sub right now? You think yal would be talking about the Achilles if you signed him?"
Theres a report that they are trying to sign-and-trade Kevin Durant for DLo
Get Kevin durant
"The Achilles injuru has a crazy record against NBA players. Boogie, Rudy, Wes Matthews, Kobe, Chauncey... and the list goes on. Outside of 'Nique, players rarely come back even level with their former selves. (source)[https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future]"
Kevin Durant is a player though!
Did you just say fucking Latrell Sprewell is high than KEVIN DURANT
In what world did Ben Wallace lead his team to a Finals and Kevin Durant hasn't? Lol
https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/
Unless when using burner account. NotKevinDurant is still Kevin Durant.
"nigga this is kevin durant, not a 55 year old kobe"
I didn't give any comparisons because no one has a game like Kevin Durant and I don't know if anyone will. He doesn't really on his athletic ability and hes a good shooter so it might not effect him much
https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/   Lol
https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/ “Out of your ass”
99.999999999 percent of players aren't kevin durant
https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/   Yeah bro
What about Kevin Durant
"wrong, more like 99.99%. kevin durant, a player, is kevin durant"
https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/achilles-injury-return-stat-that-should-give-kevin-durant-suitors-pause/
What to YOU choose? Kevin Durant or Julius Randle and Quinn Cook?!!! Knicks looked at both those options and chose the latter. Wow.  Even if Durant is our for a season and comes back at 70% its still a better option.
False. Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant
even if he has a source.  Whats the average age of the injury vs. average career length in the nba?  Lots of people are out of the league in two years. This is fucking Kevin Durant.
95% of those players aren't even close to Kevin Durant. The only exception is 34 year old Kobe.
Yeah but it's THE Kevin Durant
99% of players arent Kevin Durant
"Don't do it. Nature will recognize it's Kevin Durant, NBA's superstar and will decide to be soft on him. He's coming back 85% of what he was and he's gonna be better than 96% of the league"
99.99% of those players arent Kevin Durant
"""Why won't Kevin Durant admit the Warriors botched his recovery? Do they have evidence to blackmail him?"""
"Can I add a tropical twist to this?  **Durian** - *Giannis Antetokounmpo* - The “King of Fruits” rightfully belongs to the MVP of the league. Durian is best known for its overpowering odor. Likewise, Giannis is best known for overpowering defenders.  **Mango** - *Damian Lillard* - Even if Mango is not your favorite fruit, it is hard to find somebody who dislikes Mangoes. Likewise, who dislikes Dame, a great player who has stuck with his small market and done his best there. Mangoes are very sweet, just like Damian Lillard’s jumper.  **Coconut** - *Steven Adams* - Large, kinda hairy, and really good at smushing smaller competitors. Is that statement about Steven Adams or about Coconuts? One sets hard screens, the other kills people fairly regularly due to blunt impact trauma, but otherwise there aren’t many differences.  **Mangosteen** - *Chris Paul* - Mangosteen is small, but it’s flavor-per-square-cm is extremely efficient. Christ Paul is small but extremely efficient on the offensive end. Mangosteen is called the “Queen of Fruits”. Chris Paul’s teammates complain the CP3 thinks he is royalty.  **Snakefruit** - *Kevin Durant* - With a name like “Snakefruit”, this is the intuitive choice. But there’s more. Snakefruit tastes a bit like it can’t decide whether it wants to have the flavor of an apple or a pear, much as how KD can’t decide what he wants in a franchise."
&gt;	But we really lack that one trademark FA signing like the Nets have with Kevin Durant  You alright bro?
"&gt; Kevin Durant on if the Warriors mishandled his calf injury: “Hell, no. How can you blame [the Warriors]? Hell, no,” Durant told Yahoo Sports. “I heard the Warriors pressured me into getting back. Nobody never said a word to me during rehab as I was coming back. It was only me and [director of sports medicine and performance] Rick [Celebrini] working out every day. Right when the series started, I targeted Game 5. Hell, nah. It just happened. It’s basketball. S--- happens. Nobody was responsible for it. It was just the game. We just need to move on from that s--- because I’m going to be back playing.”  Can y’all please stfu with this narrative now"
"They signed 3 generational players, so what if some bullshit wanna be super star like Kevin Durant or Kahwi Leonard wanted to slum in some minor California teams.  They signed Smush"
"Same for us.   I guess the Iguodala signing was pretty big for us, especially in hindsight. But we really lack that one trademark FA signing like the Nets have with Kevin Durant... hoping to get Giannis in 2021. Think he'd fit well next to Curry."
Hot take but Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant

I’d love to see Kevin Durant as a Portland Trail Blazer but unfortunately that will never happen.
More like Kevin Durant
I truly and unironically believe Kevin Durant is the owner of this account
"Regardless of if Harden’s teams were the favorior not at the outset of series, the Rockets have become the favored team at points during the course of series against the Warriors (i.e., when Kevin Durant couldnt play!!) and they didn’t get it done.   I’m certainly not underrating Harden by saying what I’m saying.   His teams have certainly gotten unlucky (likethe Chris Paul injury), but they’ve also caught breaks and in both cases, he hasn’t advanced."
Kevin Durant because I’m almost sure he’s raped multiple children
He gave Stephen Curry a bucket during a camp.  Relax fellas.  May I remind you that thon maker looked like Kevin Durant in high school.
Dude just think abt it this way.. Imagine if Harden averaged only 11 ppg for a fuckin playoff series.. What would happen to us? We'd get swept out of the building back to Houston  Klay has the luxury of shitting the bed and it not mattering due to his teammates being Stephen Curry and formerly Kevin Durant.
Most points in a playoff game;  &gt;- Kevin Durant: 50  &gt;- Steph Curry: 47  &gt;- Kawhi Leonard: 45  &gt;- Giannis Antetokounmpo: 41  &gt;- Karl-Anthony Towns: 23  big oof
Kevin Durant
arent u the dude who said that steph and draymond will run the second unit next year and ur evidence was that they did it before when kevin durant was on the team?
"Kyle Kuzma and a 1st for Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and a delicious slice of New York Pizza. Who says no?"
"Lol. For us to defend the 3-point line to the point where midrange 2's start to make a comeback, teams will need to defend it to extreme levels. The worst 3 point shooting team in the league was, not surprisingly, the Suns, at 32.9%. Thats still about a 50% midrange shot, which is considered elite. 50% from midrange is so good, just about only Kevin Durant shot about 50% from midrange at high volume. Thats the math suggesting that unless the defense evolves to the point that we make every team shoot worse from 3's than the Suns, the midrange most likely won't be making a big comeback. Thats even more unlikely considering people are consistently becoming better shooters now that the 3 point shot is so valued.   Of course this doesn't mean midrange shots don't have value. Increasing 3 point volume has actually shown that the midrange is less and less guarded, where a lot of teams opting to guard the 3 point line and the rim heavier, opening up space in the middle."
"lol what? The Warriors from 2009-2012, when Draymond got drafted never topped 36 wins. Not to mention that they added a top 2 play in the league in Kevin Durant. Take Curry off of the warriors past 2015-16, they'd still be title favorites most years"
Lawful Good - Kemba Walker   Lawful Neutral - Paul George   Lawful Evil - James Harden  Neutral Good - Steph Curry  True Neutral - Lebron James  Neutral Evil - Kevin Durant   Chaotic Good - Russell Westbrook   Chaotic Neutral - Jimmy Butler  Chaotic Evil - Lance Stephenson  I'm not good at this lol
We will finally learn how tall Kevin Durant is!!
I’ll give it a shot  2008-2009 Chris Paul  2008-2009 Dwyane Wade  2013-2014 Kevin Durant  2003-2004 Kevin Garnett  1994-1995 Hakeem Olajuwon
"Using the Pythagorean Equation a² + b² = c² where b = the square root of KD’s currently listed height, we get   a² + 81 = c²  From this statement and real-world context we can create a loose deduction that Kevin Durant may not be a triangle but rather a tall humanoid basketball player. The problem is open and remains to be further explored."
"First of all, take your bandwagon laker flair off, you are a disgrace to true laker fans. Second, kobe bryant had every shot in his bag. He could take you in the post, shoot the three, mid range and finish at the rim. He is an overall better offensive player. Curry is probably the best shooter of all time but that doesnt make him a better scorer. Offenses are way more efficient nowadays with great spacing. If kobe had the gravity of a klay thompson or kevin durant he would be unstoppable. Kobe was constantly doubled with nowhere near the spacing curry gets now. Curry also shoots twice the threes kobe shot and that is probably the only part of his offensive game that is better than kobes."
Looking online Adam's might have an inch on him but not much more than that if imgur wasn't being a bitch at the moment I'd upload it direct but this SBnation article has a good photo of the two standing next to each other.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/2/12/14589738/2017-nba-scores-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-andre-roberson-clash-thunder-vs-warriors
I think it’s because he hasn’t needed to sauce people up off the dribble as much with Kevin Durant there. We’ll have a definitive answer to your question when the nba season starts though.
"This is beyond important. If I remember correctly, nba players are only forced to disclose their height and weight before their rookie season. As a result, when you google players like Kevin Durant it says he is only 6’9 (when everyone knows he’s taller than 7’ now).   These H/W measurements are what video game franchises base their character models after. So while although KD is 7’something, in NBA 2k he is only 6’9. This will alter the esports landscape drastically in NBA 2k"
"Wtf: see Kevin Durant   What a nephew we have here boys  The entire body is connected. When one part fails, if not allowed time to heal, other failures will follow"
Kevon “Kevin” Looney will probably get more looks now that Kevin Durant isn’t on the perimeter
It’s gonna be amazing when you are all disappointed to find out Kevin Durant is actually between 6’9 - 6’10 and not 7foot
*Kevin Durant intensifies*
Kevin Durant was the franchise player all he could’ve said was no and it probably would’ve been stopped.
"Klay: [Kevin Durant is our best player](https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/11/klay-thompson-on-kevin-durant-hes-our-best-player/)  Kerr: [KD is the best player in the world](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Steve-Kerr-wants-you-to-know-that-Kevin-Durant-is-13819857.php)  Basically all the evidence points to KD: Accolades, teammates, coach etc.  You can have your opinion though. My point is that there isn't a real *evidence-based* *argument* for Steph having a better all-time resume than KD. Pure subjective opinion can be all over the place, and that's cool."
"Giannis, AD, LeBron, Embiid, KAt, Jokic, Kyrie, Butler, Curry, Lillard, Kawhi, Gobert, Harden, Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Ayton (yes), Kevin Durant, Kristaps (this one is just my opinion), Luka Doncic, Blake Griffin, Kemba Walker, Bradley Beal, Victor Oladipo, Paul George, LaMarcus Aldridge, Vucevic, Kevin Love  Even if you take like 7 guys off the list, the rest are better than him (obs: he might overcome them next season by being a first option for the first time)  EDIT: I forgot Draymond Green"
Why is klay thompson ranked (lowly) but not Kevin Durant? Is Klay expected back before the end of next season?
"Kevin Durant famously failed badly at the NBA bench press, and he harbored this anger for years.  https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/"

"I remember when Kanter first got to OKC and the org made a bunch of special modifications to the facility, menu, and a few other things to make him more comfortable. This included access to special halal meals. Everyone loved the new food...except Kevin Durant.   KD then went as far to say how he had requested some special food before and was told ""you will have to pay for and figure out the logistics"". Just funny how he held onto that and it came out in that moment."
"Wasn’t this already settled?  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/  Dude is long as fuck. If he’s 6’9”, every 6’0” guy just got dropped to like 5’7”."
"It wasn't from fan noise.   Look at these [quotes](https://nypost.com/2018/07/11/the-hedge-bet-behind-the-knicks-signing-of-mario-hezonja/) from Mills:  &gt;Mills sounded like he didn’t want to put all his eggs in one basket regarding signing a star in 2019 free agency.  &gt;“Our goal is to build our team organically and around our young guys who were drafted by the team and to get better,’’ Mills said. “Our situation happens to be we will have cap room. But that’s not the goal we set out.  Here's a quote from another [article](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/othersport/997423/NBA-trade-news-Kevin-Durant-Knicks-Warriors-Kyrie-Irving-Boston-Celtics-Portland):  &gt;The New York Knicks could potentially have the cap space for two max salary slots and have been touted as a possible destination for Durant.""  &gt;Mills knew what it looked like, that the Knicks were trying to position themselves for FA, and he couldn't even admit it to fans because he knew how stupid it was.   I did look through that, I remember last summer, and I remember losing my mind trying to figure out how they were gonna open up room for two max slots *and* KP.  Here's [Metro](https://www.metro.us/sports/kevin-durant-nba-rumors-brother-drops-huge-hint-future):   &gt;On Tuesday, ESPN's Zach Lowe added fuel to the fire by predicting that Durant will sign with the Knicks next summer. New York has two max salary slots to use in free agency and teaming up Durant with the likes of Kristaps Porzingis, Kevin Knox and one other big-name free agent could quickly make the Knicks a serious contender in the Eastern Conference.   So please, don't tell me that speculation came from no where. It came directly from sources with access to the Knicks front office. And all the moves the front office made, starting that summer, were in pursuit of two max free agents."
Does this mean we can finally stop the Kevin Durant height controversy? FFS HOW DOES HE LOOK 6'9.
"No, that would be Kevin Durant. Durant took more shots than Curry in both the regular season and playoffs every single year they played together."
Think again jackass: https://theundefeated.com/features/warriors-forward-kevin-durant-still-doing-charitable-work-in-oklahoma-city/
"**Total number of all-star appearances that Harden's teammates has had in a Rocket's uniform:**  *1* (Dwight Howard in his first season with the Rocket's)  **Total number of all-star appearances that Curry's teammates has had in a Warriors's uniform:**  *12* (Klay Thompson x5, Draymond Green x3, David Lee x1, Kevin Durant x3)  You can argue spacing and ability to play off ball all you want, but none of that is near as important as having ridiculous talent and star power. Even if you want to argue that CP3 is technically all-star worthy in a Rocket's uniform, but that he simply didn't play enough games to warrant it. You would still have to concede the fact that Harden is shouldering far more weight than Curry ever has throughout 82 games."
Kevin. Durant.
"Can you let me know how a team with Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, and James Harden didn't win a title?"
"Can I please quote you as saying James Harden on a team with Igoudala, Dramond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant would be unable to win rings?"
"It's always interesting to go back and read the draft summaries on some players:     Kevin Durant is ...  … Not aggressive enough to be like Kevin Garnett, but skilled enough down the road to contribute like a Andrei Kirilenko or a Grant Hill           **Strengths:** Athletically Durant is in rare company as his wingspan, mobility, quickness, and leaping ability have few peers … Great in transition and on the fast break where he finishes with flair … Excellent feel for the game and confidence allow him to make the game appear effortless … Has the ability to catch and shoot off screens with ease … Has legit NBA three point range that he hits with regularity … Runs the court with the speed of a guard … Defensively he has all the physical tools to develop into a exceptional defender … Blessed with quick hands, length, lateral quickness and good natural instincts … Soft hands allow for him to catch any pass thrown to him in the post … Back to the basket moves are quite advanced and are executed with great speed and solid post footwork … Ball handling ability enables Durant to gain separation from most defenders … Perimeter shooting has no limitations as he has no trouble converting from mid-range with his feet set or off the dribble … Excellent rebounder on balls of out of position as he's capable of grabbing boards that would normally be out of reach for even the most athletic of players … Leadership skills have really blossomed this year as he took a young Texas team on his back giving Kansas a solid run in the Big 12 final and into to the NCAA tournament Above average shot blocker capable of disrupting shots … Explosive scorer who is capable of going through dominating stretches during games that leave opposing teams shellshocked … A player with out of this world potential …     **Weaknesses:** Double teams have proven to trouble him as he doesn't always read them quickly enough … While he is unselfish, he lacks the passing ability to create for his teammates … To his credit his isn't a terribly poor passer but certainly doesnt stand out at this point in his career Defensively he is improving and showing a willingness to improve, but still needs to work on his perimeter defense in terms of his anticipation skills and footwork Has a tendency of bite on fakes when going for the block, so improvement on his timing and patience will eliminate this … Like most freshmen in college Durant will need to add more weight and body strength. He probably will always be on the slim side due to his narrow chest, but it shouldn't hinder him much except finishing inside … Doesnt always take full advantage of mismatches, often Durant will settle for the outside jumper, granted it's not a horrible alternative … Body strength doesnt allow him to finish after contact … Despite being such a dominate offensive force, Durant can go through stretches of games where he appears fatigued and won't demand the ball … Gets pushed out rather easily on rebounds due to his body strength … Although not a major flaw, it should be noted that Durant operate primarily on the right side of the floor … Ball protection will need to be worked on as he can get careless with the ball     #### [Matthew Maurer](http://thedraftreview.com/) - 3/26/2007  **Strengths:** His upside is out of this world … This kid is not even begining to scratch the surface of his potential … Looking at him you see his frame is going to fill out in 3-4 years … Very fluid athlete with explosiveness … He plays hard and is still learning the game … Provided he works hard, Durant is going to be a special player in the league who will be able to do many different things on the court … Not aggressive enough to be like Kevin Garnett, but skilled enough down the road to contribute like a Andrei Kirilenko or a Grant Hill … Developing inside outside game … Can shoot the 3 and flush in transition … It is scary to think of what he could be like if he puts on 15 lbs of muscle and developed a handle, a 2010 version of KG!     **Weaknesses:** His (lack of) strength is his major weakness, and he really needs to put on weight or he won't be able to do much in the NBA except shoot deep 3s or score in transition like [Darius Miles](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/darius-miles) of 4 years ago … Needs to become more aggressive, develop more nastiness … Still developing a game off the dribble Defensively he needs to move his feet better and keep his hands active on the ball … Oak Hill Academy is giving him the work ethic he will need in the long run, since he most likely won't be going to college     ####"
"Kevin Durant: 7'3/4"", 135 lbs."
At lebron current age and performance.. I’d take curry or kawhi or harden before him.   Kevin durant has an Achilles injury so he his fifth.
Kevin Durant at 6’9 is criminal
"So there's 2 players left to name but Kawhi, Kevin Durant and Giannis haven't been listed yet? WTF?"
If Durant is 6-9 then Boogie Cousins and Kevin Love are 6-7.
So Kevin Durant will actually be 7’0 in 2k instead of 6’9😂
I wonder how many players heights are gonna change now. You know for sure Kevin Durant isn't gonna be listed as 6'9 anymore
"I'd go with either Kevin Durant or kyrie lol, both are drama queens but are still really good at what they do, just like AB."
"Because it's shit as a prediction as well. How can you predict that Zion will have a better season than proven players?  Kevin Durant is predicted by this list to be top 2. There is absolutely no way he is top 2 this upcoming season barring the most miraculous recovery in history, he will miss a ton of games.   It's just a shitty list all round."
"in literally *every* playoff series he's played with one of the following players on the floor: Kevin Durant, LeBron James, James Harden, and Russel Westbrook, Curry has never got as much whistles as them (and is usually doubled; tripled if KD is on his team; for instance, if he's playing with KD and LeBron is on the other team, both will inevitably get more whistles by large margins). There are even odder things (like how PJ Tucker averages more free throws against the Warriors than Curry against his squad) that make it quite clear that Curry isn't getting the whistles those guys are.  These are straight up facts, I'm in touch with those rather than with Jesus"
"&gt; last place on the all-star team doesn't make you a max player  It was the west all-star team if that counts for anything. Look at the 2017 all-star roster:  G	Stephen Curry	Golden State Warriors	4 G	James Harden	Houston Rockets	5 F	Kevin Durant	Golden State Warriors	8 F	Kawhi Leonard	San Antonio Spurs	2 F/C	Anthony Davis	New Orleans Pelicans	4 Reserves[33] G	Russell Westbrook	Oklahoma City Thunder	6 G	Klay Thompson	Golden State Warriors	3 F	Draymond Green	Golden State Warriors	2 C	DeMarcus Cousins	Sacramento Kings	3 C	Marc Gasol	Memphis Grizzlies	3 C	DeAndre Jordan	Los Angeles Clippers	1 F	Gordon Hayward	Utah Jazz	1  Aside from maybe DeAndre Jordan and Draymond Green, all of those players are definitely max caliber players."
"Kevin Durant is most similar to an over sized Kris Middleton from the shot mechanics, midrange wizardry, range, spots, etc."
"Jerry West never gave out a bad contract and he never drafted a bust. West drafted James Worthy, AC Green, Vlade Divac, Eddie Jones, Klay Thompson,  Draymond Green, and he traded Divac for Kobe.   And in free agency he has signed Shaq, Rick Fox, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard. And he never let the Warriors break up Steph and Klay."
Curry wins mvp Kevin Durant returns Klay Thompson returns  Lakers lose to the warriors in the first round  Anthony Davis doesn’t re-sign Giannis doesn’t sign his extension and asks to be traded
"In myleague on 2k the Seattle Seahorses are an undefeated team. Sporting a mediocre lineup of Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Kristaps, and Anthony Davis. Given some of the weak players on this roster, I see it as a legitimate possibility that I could recreate this roster in real life. Given the appealing city of Seattle, the sunny warm days, the entertainment, and the high life, I could attract these players with ease. This fails to mention my number one secret weapon. The Seahorses... Let that sink in??? What player in the NBA would NOT want to play as a Seattle Seahorse. ""I'd rather be a Maverick, or a Wizard, or a Rocket, or a Cavalier"". Fuck you, how about that? How about you take those dumb mascots and quit wasting my time. If you don't see the appeal of a seahorse then you don't like NBA basketball. Plain and simple."
Kevin Durant
"I do believe Kobe was the best player in the league in the mid-to-late 2000s, but there were always dude who were at least close. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the game for years and there was no one who even came close until Steph Curry in 2015-16. Kevin Durant was second before then, but every single person with even cursory NBA knowledge knew he wasn’t on LeBron’s level."
"1. Wikipedia and basketball reference is your friend.  2. Understand basic rules.  3. Play 2K if u got time and money.  4. Google these NBA players  LeBron, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Moses Malone, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, John Havlicek.  And then go and pick a team"
"Elite size, good touch, solid handle for his size and pretty fluid. He's a lot like Kevin Durant."
Lol the Warriors were a 73-win team that added Kevin Durant. They were by far the most stacked team of all time. The 86 Celtics lost 3 games during their playoff run compared to only 1 game lost by the Warriors. The Warriors were definitely more stacked.
This post highlights how much OP cares about Kevin Durant. He’s basically in love with him.
"Wow, I saw the game there, and certainly Golden State Warriors is not that bad as I thought without Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. Good play by D'Angelo Russell and Lebron James and of course, Anthony Davis. But in my opinion, things are gonna chang when Klay Thompson returns next January. Golden State Warriors is still , one of the championship winner!!"
“And Kevin Durant slithers onto the court”
Rondo had a better 3 point percentage last season than Kevin Durant.
"Rightfully so. A team had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Paul George and still failed to win a title this decade."
I liked the way Kevin Durant played basketball.
"Yeah, if Karma existed the golden state warriors would have won the title. Because the city of toronto cheered kevin durants injury. Instead, klay got injured and the raptors won.  But the way karma afficianados would try to reconcile this mindfuck, well kevin durant got karma for being mean online and signing with golden state lol  Karma has no deadline, so that mean it can literally be an infinite regress. If you did something bad 40 years ago, its karma. If you didn't do really anything bad, but your dad did. You're being punished for your dad. If your dad didn't do anything wrong, you're being punished for your granddad..and so forth.  It's a bullshit system that doesn't factor in forgiveness and personal responsibility. if someone kill someone, he can say well, I'm paying for my dad's transgressions. I'm cursed."
You should read his book. The media and Bulls brass threw him under the bus and turned some of the fan base against him.   The whole not coming back thing was so overblown it makes me gag. Player's come back when they feel they're ready. If you give in to the pressure you end up like Kevin Durant.
"So Giannis is a Kevin Durant with better D, rebounding and athleticism?  I think Jordan is the GOAT, but IDK if I could take him over that."

I was never high on Ingram (still amn't) but he looks like Kevin Durant out there.

For the 5 I would say jokic or Chris Bosh.   For the three I would love to have Middleton or hear me out Kevin durant.

Ur talking playoff as whole but when referring to finals he has generally shit the bed. Got outplayed by fred van fleet and kyle Lowry especially in the final game. Without the warriors best player in Kevin Durant steph really struggles.
Kevin Durant. flawless player
Kevin Durant without a Doubt
"I think people are underrating Prime KG on the Wolves in this. Like if ALL the teams have their prime player, no. But if it's the league as it is, KG was a huge impact player, and his peak was potentially the best year by a 4 ever.   He took the Wolves to the WCF and the only reason they didn't win was Cassell got hurt. But people overrate how good an aging Cassell and Sprewell were considering they were the best teammates he ever had on the Wolves.  * Replace Cassell with Teague, slight downgrade, but you're not gonna need the same scoring output because we have other options that we'll get to. His passing is on par, and Teague is coming off his highest APG of his career. He's got enough shooting to space the floor, and his tendency to dribble too much is alleviated by the fact that KG can be bringing the ball down the court half the time. He's probably not as much of a defensive asset as Cassell, but as an experienced vet himself, he's capable in most situations.  * Replace Trenton Hassell with Andrew Wiggins. Yeah, yeah, Wiggins sucks, don't need to hear it, here he's the 4th or 5th most important player in the lineup, relegated simply to shooting 3s or driving to the rim. He's shown throughout his career to be loads more comfortable playing at the SG position, and here his now decent defense (he's leaps and bounds better than the Wiggins of 3 years ago on this end) is put in it's best possible scenario. If you check his matchups with premier wings when assigned the past year and a half, he's able to hold the likes of Kevin Durant and Paul George to below their expected averages. You may call him the weak link of the lineup, but he's still able to score at a high rate when necessary, and miles better at his worst than Trenton Hassell ever was.  * Replace Latrell Sprewell with Robert Covington. Wow, Spree was ok back then, but the name precedes how good he actually was in KG's monstrous 03-04 campaign. Nearly across the board he put up worse stats than Wiggins and needing more minutes to do so. When you compare him to Covington the differences are stark. Covington doesn't score quite as much, but does so far, far more efficiently. He's able to space the floor better, and provides an absolutely enormous upgrade on the defensive side of the ball. The defense might not seem like much, but by his versatility in being able to guard 1-4 defensively, and taking on the top wing allowing Wiggins to put his effort onto the weaker player he opens up a whole new world to this lineup on both sides of the court.  * Prime KG. Oh what a sight to behold. The current Wolves don't even have a starting 4. You're adding arguably (and probably the favorite in the argument) the best PF season ever. A defensive savant. The original stretch 4. A point forward that will initiate the offense, and probably the best passing big of his time. We're pairing one of the best defenders all time, someone who not only is capable of defending 1-5, but excels at it, with a healthy Robert Covington, an All-Defense first team lock. The spacing is perfect, providing Wiggins and our next player room to drive to the hoop. The spacing from the rest of the team also opens up his own top tier ability to dominate in the paint and at the rim. With his all-time defensive rebounding skills, he allows this team to get out and run in transition, being able to outlet pass to some of the most athletic young players in the league. His defensive leadership lifts the rest of the team up, bringing them to new heights on both sides of the ball.  * Lastly to pair with the Big Ticket, we've got the Big KAT. KG's 03-04 campaign paired him with a garbage Michael Olowokandi and Ervin Johnson Jr. Not Earvin Johnson Jr., Ervin Johnson Jr. Olowokandi, one of the worst first overall picks of all time, put up 6.5 pts and 5.7 rbs per game, and shot an astounding .425 from the field. Which was entirely 2pt FG attempts. A center that can only put in about 2 out of every 5 shots from in the paint. He was bad. However he only played slightly over half the season, and only started a little over a quarter of our games at center. It was Ervin Johnson who started most of them. You may think well his stats most have earned him most of those starts given how poor the Candy Man's were. Well you'd be wrong. Ervin Johnson put up *less* than 2 pts per game, and less than 4 boards per game. His percentage from the field was slightly better at .534, but that hardly matters when you're not even putting up 2 shots a game. Instead we put in KAT, ready to step up, something north of a line of 25/12/4, on close to a 55/40/85 shooting split. He opens up KG's game on offense tremendously. KG's game takes KAT's to new levels on the attack. On defense there's two players that have made KAT look not only like a competent defender, but a good to great one. Those two players are Robert Covington and the one and only Kevin Garnett. With two defensive quarterbacks able to create a monster tandem themselves, and guide KAT, he looks better on defense than ever before. When KAT can't bang around inside, KG is able to take anyone on. The switch-ability is on a whole new level, and the offense for every player on the team is put in a position to open up looks that they were never able to experience before.  * Without a true sixth man, to lead scoring off the bench, you're clearly downgrading at the spot, Wally Szczerbiak was an All-Star caliber player, playing off the bench, and the current Wolves have nothing close, and they don't have the Derrick Rose spark plug that they enjoyed the past season and a half. But they do have depth, especially at the wing. With many newly signed players including Jordan Bell, Jake Layman, and Noah Vonleh, along with second year players Josh Okogie, and Keita Bates-Diop looking to take a step forward, and the fresh rookie 6th pick Jarrett Culver, you have a lot of depth from 2-4. Shabazz Napier provides back up minutes at the 1 when they don't resort to one of their wings playing point. Gorgui Dieng completes the big lineup, with experience backing up KAT and playing with both KG and KAT. The depth isn't fantastic, and is clearly the weak point of the team, but it's less relevant when you get to the playoffs anyways.  KG was able to drag the Wolves to the playoffs year after year. Once he finally gets a little mediocre support, he leads them to the best record in a loaded West featuring the Kobe Shaq duo, and equally prime Tim Duncan, a solid Dirk with Dallas, and a strong Kings team, and brings them to the Western Conference Finals, only topped by a Lakers featuring the aforementioned superstars joined by Hall of Famers Gary Payton and Karl Malone. A Wolves lineup that recently was on pace for the third seed with a healthy Jimmy Butler, behind only the loaded lineups of the 2017 Warriors and Rockets, has gotten more experience and improved, while replacing Butler and a solid, but just that, Taj Gibson, with Robert Covington, and MVP KG. They're a tour de force all their own. They certainly have a strong shot at winning the Championship, this year or any year.  Great question by the way."
Steph Curry  Kevin Durant   Kawhi Leonard   Giannis   David Robinson
Oddly I don’t think any # 2 picks have turned around franchises lately aside from Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant would be my first pick. If not him, then I’d probably go with Oscar Robertson.   Pistol Pete would be another interesting player to choose."
"The guy is attempting to argue that because harden beat the KD warriors 5 times in over four yrs, that harden is better than kawhi. Not accounting for that harden did not win a single series.  Harden is great no question but in the playoffs the game slow down. Why would I pick an isolation heavy player not named Kevin Durant over kawhi Leonard or even LeBron James? I'd pick Steph over harden too.  Curry can play on ball and really good off the ball. Harden is ball dominant. He had a generational point guard in Paul and rumors said he argued with him because harden wanted Chris Paul to move without the ball more.  The plan with Westbrook is to make Russell who is less efficient with shotmaking to be the off ball player.   Harden is stubborn. That's where his frustration comes in then it leaks onto the team and they lose"
Eg is the finest basketball mind of this generation  He looks at a fatass Serbian and sees a guy who can run the #1 offense in the nba He sees a decomposing pile of bones and sees Kevin Durant
"Yeah if only Harden had a shot at the Warriors without [Kevin Durant](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/sports/warriors-rockets-kevin-durant-calf-achilles.html).   Honestly I'd take Kawhi. I didn't say it was the only possible choice, in fact I went out of my way to say I might be dumb for it in the first post, but I think as a two-way player it's not crazy controversial to say that Kawhi's defense over a series more than makes up for him being a less complete offensive player."
Kyrie happened. Kevin Durant happened.
This was rly Kevin Durant in a Kerr mask responding to Trump's tweet.
Hardest Road - Kevin Durant
"I think the problem is that if Curry is on the verge of averaging 40 this season, Kevin Durant will start an online cyber bullying campaign against Steph to try to make him depressed so that he doesn't average 40 per game."
Cool he's just like Kevin Durant right?   ...right?
" ""James began his new chapter in Los Angeles with a practice at UCLA over the summer, which included himself, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, **and a Turkish second-year player who could easily be carded when seeing the second** ***It*** **movie**. "" I love it lol"
"It's simple. The issues they get involved in are easy, popular and there is no blowback. It's a no brainer. Why wouldn't they support what 90% of their fans support. Now, when they have an opportunity to stand up for something real, *actual* human rights violations, with the potential for blowback, they bow down. Because it's not so easy. These fucking athletes aren't Martin Luther King. They are being the fucking Kevin Durant of politics and you all can't seem to see that."
"The Nets aren’t irrelevant. They have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Their on court actions aren’t irrelevant either, the post on this sub about the Nets clinching a playoff berth has several thousand upvotes.   I think what you’re trying to say is that the Knicks having more fans than the Nets automatically means that the Nets have no fans, which is factually wrong. The truth is that the rest of the league isn’t going to care about your attendance numbers as long as the on court product you guys provide is not good."
Kevin Durant on Kawhi - “Players don’t [sleep on him]. He’s got the longest paragraph on the scouting report. He can do everything. You can’t dribble around him cuz he’s gonna steal the ball. It’s still tough for me to pull out all my shit against Kawhi.”
"""Yo please stop being mad that I called u a system player"" - Kevin Durant"
"He is many things!  A Lord can be Knighted and be a ""Sir"".    And ""your...servant"" was just a way to end a letter; a [valediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction).    Here is a reddit post about it!:  [https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2l7e44/why_did_the_formal_valediction_such_as_i_am_sir/](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2l7e44/why_did_the_formal_valediction_such_as_i_am_sir/)  Unless we are talking about *The* Servant.  That's Brooklyn Net, Kevin Durant."
Because some crazy people value Kevin Durant more than Andrew Bogut
"Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"Lmao. The classic ""just go do what Kevin Durant does"".   Great input man."
There was buzz around Giannis winning MVP but most of it was generated by [Bovada opening the season with Giannis having the third best odds to win it](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/09/05/mvp-odds-giannis-antetokounmpo-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis) behind AD who's never healthy and Lebron who mails it in every year.
i dont see your lord and savior kevin durant saying anything you hypocrite
Kevin Durant
Are you saying Steph started playing basketball before Kevin Durant joined him?
"&gt;""I see this situation as, 'All right, I'm coming to a young organization that has championship aspirations but doesn't quite know what that feels like.'""  So....exactly what you had in OKC?   Oh yeah, **fuck you, Kevin Durant**"
"&gt;I know the surrounding DC Metropolitan area just off the top of my head has produced the likes of Kevin Durant, Elgin Baylor,Michael Beasely, Jeff Green, Quinn Cook.  Also Oladipo"
"Lol I'm not gonna do that. And wow you're insane. I don't think the Knicks are particularly bad this season, but you'd rather have the roster of PF's you have now, instead of Kyrie and Kevin fucking Durant.   I know it's a big risk, but opportunities like this don't come around often, especially if you're a NY sports fan and all sports do in this area is give you perpetual sadness and disappointment. If this particular experiment fails, Nets start over in 4 years, we still got our own picks.  I think you're in denial about Kyrie's actual skill, I'm not disputing his craziness, just saying his basketball prowess more than makes up for his off court shenanigans, especially the way he came out this season. Enjoy your 20 win season and seeing how your FO will ruin RJ Barrett, who somehow is your best player already, which is both electrifying and terrifying, how the fuck is a 19 yo rookie better than all the players your FO signed this summer."
Thankfully he has a strong minded superstar in Kevin Durant there to help.
There are only two players who have ever willingly walked away from playing with Curry. Kevin Durant and Patrick McCaw.
"Time for some quick math to figure out the playoff/finals numbers. In order to get a rough estimate of Curry's points per 100 against FVV in the finals:  * Let's look at the raw data  * Over 6 games, Curry had 41 points over 112 possessions against FVV.  * Now let's turn it into points per 100  * (100 / 112) x 41 = 36.61 points per 100    Now let's compare that to the [regular season league leaders in points per 100 last season](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/8J8op):  |Rk|Player|PTS| |-:|:-|-:|-:| |1|James Harden|48.2| |2|Giannis Antetokounmpo|39.3| |3|Joel Embiid|38.6| |4|Stephen Curry|38.4| |5|Kawhi Leonard|37.5| |6|Devin Booker|36.2| |7|Kevin Durant|35.7| |8|Kemba Walker|35.7| |9|Paul George|35.5| |10|Lou Williams|35.5 |11|Karl-Anthony Towns|35.4| |12|Damian Lillard|35.3| |13|Kyrie Irving|34.7| |14|Blake Griffin|34.6| |15|Donovan Mitchell|33.7|  Curry's scoring on FVV in the finals was good enough to place him just above Devin Booker in the 6th spot.  ***  Yes, FVV had some nice defensive stats against Curry in the regular season. When it counted, by your own metric (PP100), Curry torched him."
Kevin Durant is pretty easily my #1
"&gt;I hate to break it to you but Curry isn’t even a top 10 playmaker and maybe not too 15 in the league. His “gravity” doesn’t count. If it did, Reddick, Korver, Bojan Bogdanovic or other three point shooters would be considered at least decent playmakers. Curry doesn’t even lead his own team in assists when he has Klay and Kevin Durant to pass to. Klay is one of the best catch a shoot players of all time and it’s not Curry who sets him up. Look at the stats.   Just a few quick points to rebut that and explain Curry's deflated assist numbers;  1) he plays with one of (if not the) best passing/ball handling PFs of all time  2) golden state runs less PnR than any other team in the league giving curry much less ability to iso, break down the defense and make a pass  3) read and react, pass and move style offenses (like golden state, like triangle etc) basically always deflate PG assist totals and inflate everyone else's. Not just golden state, same with the Spurs, same with 90s bulls and 2000s Lakers etc.    Take a look at Ben Taylor's passing rating and his podcast deep dive into passers / shot creation / playmaking on YouTube. Does a better job of explaining why everything you're saying here just doesn't add up with what we see and all the advanced stats that line up with the eye test than I'll be able to.  &gt;And like I said, most of the roster Russ has to work with are no longer in the league they were so trash  I mean, you're wrong though.   Gibson, kanter, dipo, Adams, grant, Roberson, McDermott, Sabonis are all still in the league.   Basically the only guys that played significant minutes that aren't in the league are morrow (because he's 34 now) and Abrines (would still be on the thunder if he didn't suffer from depression and opt to leave the league to go home).   &gt;Sabonis was a rookie and got to start most of the season when he shot 39% FG and was an extremely liability on defense.  Completely disagree about the defense. Him and Adams on the floor together was an elite defense all year and a big net positive in over 1000 minutes."
"[Barkley] Kevin Durant enters the Warriors locker room and teammates joke he entered the wrong locker room. Draymond Green joked: ""Look who accidently slithered into his old locker room."" Green joked, ""Come on man, we don't need you. Leave."""
"&gt;Lonzo's real problem is that he shoots on the wrong side of his face .   *Shot, have you watched a single Pelicans game this season? He shoots *much* more straight  &gt;He literally uses a left handed shooting pocket as a right-handed shot  And? Literally so does Kevin Durant  &gt;It cannot get worse than that  LMAO, like I said, there are shooters who's release points were behind their entire head. You bugging  &gt;Aside from that, he catches the ball on the right side of his body, brings it down to the left near his hip, and then swings it up the left side of his head  Again, his shot form doesn't look like this anymore, watch a damn game lol"
Man Kevin Durant would be perfect for this team
Where were you when Damion “literally Kevin Durant” Lee became the 4th all star for the warriors?
"&gt; Buddy it’s fucking simple. Over the years, Steph has played with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and KEVIN FUCKING DURANT. Harden has played with a 34 year old CP3 and good role players. Did I say Harden did absolutely everything by himself? Absolutely not. He had help, every star does to an extent. But Steph quite literally had the most stacked supporting cast that ANY SUPERSTAR HAS EVER HAD, and that’s even before KD. Sorry if that doesn’t impress me.  Your argument is in bad faith. And again for 100th time how does that show Steph can't be elite without an elite supporting cast when he put up numbers before one and won MVP with one all star the next year. no wait you're just gonna say that argument is in bad faith."

There is absolutely no good that could come out of this for KEVIN DURANT

"Stephen A:  Kevin Durant, WHO IS A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE, -  KD:  Nah."
"You flat out got caught using fake stats, my dude lol.   And you taking Klay out of the equation doesn't account for the fact that he had Kevin Fucking Durant on the floor for most of those years.   How stupid can you be to solely focus on Klay's impact while ignoring he was playing with another MVP?"
"Come on man. You’re really out here comparing PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon to Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and prime Kevin fucking Durant? You’re arguing in bad faith."
"Kerr delegates it to MB. You can read some articles on it:  - https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Mike-Brown-revamps-Warriors-substitution-9982718.php - https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/How-Warriors-Mike-Brown-found-his-golden-state-11153991.php  Not sure if those are behind paywall...I've posted some relevant bits:  &gt;A numbers whiz, Brown developed a substitution pattern in training camp that ensured that at least two of Golden State’s four core players — Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — would be on the floor at any point in the game. Having Brown, rotation sheet in hand, monitor the times for players to check in and out freed up Kerr to concentrate on what he does best: Relay his message to the team.  ---  &gt;“I’m pretty anal,” Brown, the Warriors’ new top assistant coach, said with a chuckle.  &gt;That meticulous approach has come in handy this preseason. Tasked with revamping Golden State’s substitution pattern, Brown uses a handwritten sheet to chart the moments players come on and off the court.  &gt;He evaluates the data, and depending on the results, makes necessary tweaks. The hope is to iron out a blueprint by the Warriors’ season opener against San Antonio on Tuesday.  &gt;A numbers whiz whose favorite subject in school was math, Brown relishes the job’s complexities: Head coach Steve Kerr wants to ensure that at least two of his four core players — Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green — are on the floor at any point in the game. But unlike many of his NBA peers who employ eight- or nine-man rotations, Kerr prefers 10.  &gt;“You’re trying to make it flow so guys don’t get disjointed,” said Brown, who — in head-coaching stints with the Cavaliers (2005-10, 2013-14) and Lakers (2011-12) — favored a nine-man rotation. “Getting a good rhythm can get tougher the more guys you play in a half.”  &gt;Basketball teams, of course, can’t be treated like calculus. Because people are involved, there is inherent subjectivity. What if an All-Star would rather check out of games after the first quarter than midway through it? What if a certain rotation forces a ball-dominant scorer to play a complementary role? What if the opponent makes an adjustment that nullifies the game plan?  &gt;Therein lies Brown’s biggest challenge: Craft a substitution pattern with built-in flexibility. The handwritten sheet, a tool he picked up from working under Rick Carlisle at Indiana more than a decade ago, allows him to track every adjustment he makes. If Brown sticks with his visual aid, he won’t accidentally leave his best player cooling on the bench too long.  &gt;“It’s pretty easy and natural for me,” Brown said. “I get a few ideas, and then I just start plugging things in.”"

"People romanticize the past and marginalize the present. Larry bird would’ve definitely run his mouth on twitter, since we have evidence that he trashed talked in game. Also, Kevin Durant literally sacrificed for the warriors by playing on an injured leg, which is the whole reason that he’s out for the year in the first place. You’re delusional man."

"Jesus Christ.   Kevin Durant is sure a sensitive little thing, isn't he?  Living life as a perpetual middle school student."
He's Kevin Durant. Y'all know who he is.
"You know what? I'm going to say this now, I'm not mad that Kevin Durant left OKC because he was a free agent and it's his choice. I won't even call him a snake for it like others. However, he had all that time to talk about OKC *like this* while he was in Golden State. Now he's in Brooklyn and he's saying all of this *now*? He must've befriended some goons or something over there. Anyways, fans are fans and they can be assholes. He doesn't think Brooklyn fans will treat him like that too? Especially with them never having players of his caliber in their history? He also needs to remember that he's also injured. What if he can't come back to form, they will rip him up!"
"In 2017:  &gt; ""I thought (the boos) would be louder.""  https://www.nba.com/article/2017/02/12/golden-states-kevin-durant-has-last-word-heated-return-oklahoma-city"
"In the sense that I’m using it, soft = uncompetitive/afraid of competition/not confident in your own abilities to lead and be the best player on your own team. It’s completely a sports thing and has nothing to do with masculinity.  &gt; What does calling someone soft really mean? It means they are not hard, not manly, not tough, like a REAL man. A REAL man doesn't need help. He is strong enough and tough enough to not need any help ever.  Well not exactly. Steph had a ton of help, even before KD. He was playing with one of the best shooters of all time, a DPOY and a solid supporting cast.  Kevin Durant didn’t “help” Steph win 2 titles. It’s the other way around. Steph helped KD win 2 titles. Steph didn’t ask for help. He asked for the championship to be guaranteed before the season even started."
"Apparently this is some of the stuff he said:   &gt; Kevin Durant on:  &gt; - The Warriors (""I started to realize I’m just different from the rest of the guys"")  &gt; - The Thunder (""I don't trust nobody there"")  &gt; - The NBA (""Some days I hate the NBA"")   http://twitter.com/bzcohen/status/1171427148013494272"

 AB.      Kevin Durant was a free agent and played within the rules
Kevin Durant  /s just in case
"The first person to make sense on this thread!!!  Without Durant  2015- Beat Cavs 4-2 without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving missing 5 games of 6 games...  2016-Choke away 3-1 lead. Lose to Cavs 4-3....  With Durant  2017-Went 16-1 in playoffs and crush Cavs 4-1  2018-Crush Cavs again 4-0 in Finals, winning by 10, 19, 8 and 23.....  Without Durant  2019-Lose to Raptors 4-2  How does no one else see this????"
"Iguodala was never the best player, nor a perennial all-star and all-nba guy on GSW. It’s not the same. Kevin Durant was not a role player of any kind on the Warriors."
Kevin Durant was by far the best fucking player on the team. A 73 win team that choked in the Finals added Durant......and proceeded to go 8-1 the next 2 Finals appearances. Add in the 2 Finals MVP’s and what the fuck are you talking about......
"Teams have realized that James Harden's beard has evolved to included air disturbances. The Golden State Warriors, behing light years ahead of everyone, started putting these head bands on players and put them in windtunnels and saw that there was a slight slipstream created by the tie in the back. They surmised that this redirection of air is what causes Rafael Nadal to always scratch his butt/pull his pants before a point.   Steph Curry briefly mentioned this to Kevin Durant and now Kyrie Irving is trying to publish a paper in Nature showing that this redirection of air and additional slipstream is not only proof that the world is flat, but that if you drink coke, you become stupid.  Now, James Harden was looking at the footage of the slipstream and realized that if he was behind a player wearing such a headband, his beard would automatically alert him and he could 'strategically fall' at any time and the ref would have to call it. The headband caused it.  So the league took the only option it could-- either deal with even more Harden flopistry, or just ban the head band."
"Remember the 2017 finals? Go take a look at some of the Warriors fast breaks in that series; you have Kevin Durant charging down the court and somehow the Cavs are still so paranoid about giving up a 3 that they throw two guys on Curry instead of trying to prevent the easy bucket. The last time I saw a player draw that many double-teams consistently was prime Shaq. In fact, hasn't Shaq said more or less the same thing on a couple of occasions?"
Kevin Durant played by Bruno “Brazilian KD” Caboclo
actual list  1. Anthony Davis  2. Andrew Wiggins  3. DeMarcus Cousins  4. Kevin Durant  5. Russell Westbrook  6. Kyrie Irving  7. Blake Griffin  8. Stephen Curry  9. Paul George  10.

Jaylen Brown
"They say this list is only focused only on the upcoming 2020 season alone saying Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, and John Wall won't even make the top 100.   They taking an account the current state of players health, injuries, reasonable recovery times and such which is way Klay is that low; probably won't come back until late season or playoff and when he comes back probably take some time to get back to back his original 100% self after recovering from a major knee injury."
For those who just want the list:  20. Jaylen Brown  19. Dragan Bender  18. Jahlil Okafor  17. DeAndre Jordan  16. John Wall  15. Bradley Beal  14. Andre Drummond  13. Karl Anthony-Towns  12.

"Yup, and Kevin Durant is 6'9""."
"&gt;He drew more fouls because more fouls are called in todays game, and players actively seek to draw shooting fouls as a strategy way more often now than then.   You're completely exposing your lack of knowledge here. Those Hornets shot 22.4 FTA/game. The Jazz shot 30.3. It's also a lot easier to be efficient when you're only shooting 11.8 FGA and picking your spots vs being the primary scorer and facilitator.  &gt;Win shares aren’t even close an apples to apples comparison, especially when one players team is so much better than other players. The jazz had such great players that of course Stocktons contribution didn’t stand out as much. For example, the year before Kevin Durant went to the warriors, Steph Curry had 17.9 w/s. The next season it dropped to 12.6, then to 9.1 (almost half of what it used to be). Win shares are an awful stat to compare two completely different situations and eras. Do you think steph was playing half as good as he was when KD joined?   The reason why Curry's WS look that way is that 2016 is one of the best individual seasons of all time and the Warriors won 73 games. Win shares are also volume/minutes based and Curry missed a ton of games, if you compare those two seasons in terms of WS/48 it's .318 to .267. That's completely accurate when it comes to judging his peak season so you don't really have a point there. You haven't refuted anything else I said either so I'm thoroughly unconvinced that Stockton had a better peak."
"Using FG%/shooting splits to compare scoring efficiency.  Using blocks/steals per game to compare defense.  Ignoring playmaking completely and only looking at ppg when comparing offense. There's a reason why elite scorers like Adrian Dantley and Kevin Durant never led historically good offensive teams while Nash/Magic have.  Look only at isolation skills and on-ball defense when comparing players, which is why you have idiots acting like Durant is undeniably better than Curry despite the abundance of statistical evidence both box score and impact based suggesting otherwise."
"He drew more fouls because more fouls are called in todays game, and players actively seek to draw shooting fouls as a strategy way more often now than then. Assist percentage is a completely useless stat in this context.   Win shares aren’t even close an apples to apples comparison, especially when one players team is so much better than other players. The jazz had such great players that of course Stocktons contribution didn’t stand out as much. For example, the year before Kevin Durant went to the warriors, Steph Curry had 17.9 w/s. The next season it dropped to 12.6, then to 9.1 (almost half of what it used to be). Win shares are an awful stat to compare two completely different situations and eras. Do you think steph was playing half as good as he was when KD joined?   The raw stats show that they were both great players at their peak"
"Kevin Durant is probably the more accurate comparison. Regardless, she's absolutely insane"
"Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka."
"I read your op-ed about why you hate Lebron James. You have a really toxic mentality. No person or player owes you anything. Lebron doesn't talk to his current team during free agency because he doesn't have to he already knows everything about them, and also because teams do this to players.  Teams trade players without warning and normally they determine when and where communication with the player happens. After watching Kawhi  shut out the Raptors this year and Kevin Durant not speaking to the Warriors, you have to see that now no? These superstar players are just treating their teams the way teams normally treat these players.   Fans like you and teams just care more and treat the stars special because they're good players--but once they get old teams and fans treat players like trash role players again. So it's a business and guys like Lebron understand that. You only care about what Lebron does and take the time to hate on him because he's a great player that didn't do what you want him to. You're behaving like a 'nice guy' when a hot girl doesn't do what you want. You get it? You're showing your true ugly colors and that's why Lebron cuts out most people in his life because he knows their real intentions like a hot girl does.  Listen to Dwade's quote in response to a question about why he wasn't mad at Lebron for leaving the Heat: ""*Because our relationship isn't built on what he can do for me.*"""
Oh.  Definitely not. Before kd got injured kawhi led in every single advanced stat but ts and was carrying the raptors.  2 series just isn't long enough and he seriously injured himself trying to sustain that play. Besides even if you counted it.... Look at the stats.  Kawhi was clearly better.   https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id2_hint=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;player_id2_select=Kawhi+Leonard&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=leonaka01&amp;idx=players
"Damn bro your right.  So since you need to know: I'm in a place that has posters of only 3/5 actual players plastered around the richest parts of town as a advertising campaign for the transplants who consider a sports game to be the time to discuss their formative college years with their free range kids and barely know anything about the team they're going to go watch...which is why I got asked at a bar if I couldnt ""wait to see Kevin Durant at Chase!"" with unflinching ignorance when wearing my old ass J.RICH jersey on laundry day.   That unflair your bum hun? That I share your frustration of the fair weather who probably did this without thinking? But nah, Yeah. Real fucking important to have flair legitimacy before I go making a snide, half baked comments about dumber dudes than us fighting someone they normally root for who just happens to be out of their designated jersey in public spaces over a slightly different colored jersey from a place barely a drive away. Cuz red."
Kevin Huerter -&gt; Danny Green -&gt; Klay Thompson  Bruno Caboclo -&gt; Brandon Ingram -&gt; Kevin Durant
"&gt; Prime T-Mac was on the same level as Kevin Durant offensively  Lol what, how overrated does this dude have to be for this nonsense to get upvoted. Jesus."
Probably a superstar joining a dominant team. Something like.. Kevin Durant joining the best regular season team ever. Pretty unimaginable
The golden state warriors are signing a 2 year deal to go to kevin durant
"Curry isn't as bad a defender as people think. That's not to say he's a *good* defender, but he looks worse than he actually is because he was the weak link for a long time on a defensive unit where everybody else was Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green. Durant is probably the second-worst defender on that squad."
"Funny how when you steal a team that just drafted Kevin Durant and Russel Westbrook, people decide to show up.   Suck a dick bro"
"You're using his listed height which is inaccurate. There are plenty of [pictures](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl_tW24WYAATtUh.jpg:large) of him standing next to guys that are legitimately listed at 7 feet tall and he's the same height as them. KD himself even came out and [admitted](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/) that he's 7 feet tall. Yea his listed height might be 6'9, but it's pretty widely accepted that he's actually basically 7 feet"
Started the resting movement. Started the super-team era. Flops a crap ton. Is corny...sued alabama for a barbershop themed show? Oh and this:     [Kevin Durant Says Environment Around LeBron James Is 'Toxic'](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/sports/kevin-durant-lebron-james.html)
"What kind of mental gymnastics is this?  Draymond is a DPOY winner and another playmaker on offense. Harden doesn’t have a player like that  Harden also doesn’t have one of the best 3&amp;D shooting guards, and probably overall the 2nd best SG on his team  And that Kevin Durant guy is pretty good.   You see why comparing team success leads to no where? It just derails the whole discussion. Which is why you compare the players based on individual skills.   I’m starting to think y’all do this on purpose"
"This isn’t soccer, where people care about the World Cup. Americans don’t care about FIBA. Paul George (1st team all nba) , James Harden(1), Steph Curry(1), Kevin Durant(2), Kawhi Leonard (2), Damian Lillard (2), Kyrie Irving (2), Blake Griffin (3), LeBron James(3), and Russell Westbrook (3) are not participating. Kemba Walker(3) is the only American All-NBA player participating. That’s 1/11 and he’s arguably the worst of them.   Americans somewhat care about the Olympics. They can sometimes get around 50% participation from the top players."
It wasn't either of them though it's just a meme. People just like picking the smallest guy on the Mavs and give them credit for locking down Lebron. It 'could have been Barea that locked up Kevin Durant' too by this troll logic.
Allen Iverson-Kobe-Lebron-Kevin Durant-Wilt  Good luck sharing that ball
Its not the loss of defensive personnel that concerns people about the Warriors its the loss of Kevin fucking Durant AND Klay Thompson
Kevin Durant is a career 35% shooter in the playoffs? Does that mean Brown is a better shooter than him too?
Do you people really have Robinson AND Stockton in your top 20? Who are they bumping off of this list?  Michael Jordan   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   LeBron James   Bill Russell   Wilt Chamberlain   Tim Duncan   Magic Johnson   Larry Bird   Hakeem Olajuwon   Shaquille O'Neal   Kobe Bryant   Oscar Robertson   Jerry West   Moses Malone   Julius Erving   Kevin Durant   Karl Malone   Charles Barkley   Kevin Garnett   Dirk Nowitzki  That's 20 players. Which two players are you taking away to put Robinson AND Stockton in?
Kevin Durant should be able to play basketball where ever he wants with out a bunch of whiny pre teens throwing a fit (29 fan bases)
you know how BF determines that? because I know: they go by height which doesnt mean shit unless you want to tell me that Kevin Durant was playing Center when he was on the court with Draymond Green
Lemme save y'all a click  25: Charles Barkley  24: Elgin Baylor  23: Reggie Miller  22: Kevin Durant  21: Dirk Nowtizki   20: John Stockton  19: Karl Malone  18: Kevin Garnett  17: Dwywane Wade  16: Scottie Pippen  15: Julius Erving  14: Jerry West  13: David Robinson  12: Kobe Bryant  11: Oscar Robertson  10: Hakeem Olajuwan  9: Larry Bird  8: Wilt Chamberlain  7: Bill Russell   6: Magic Johnson  5: Tim Duncan  4: Shaquille O'Neal  3: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  2.

2011 Dirk for single season   Kevin Durant best player i ever seen
Ten NBA hacks that will drive Kevin Durant insane..
Would that be the one where a 73-win team got spanked in the Finals without Kevin Durant on the floor? Yeah he was great in that one...
