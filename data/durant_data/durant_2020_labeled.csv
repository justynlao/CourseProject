He gets doubled constantly and doesnt have the luxury of having a Klay Thompson or a Kevin Durant to take pressure off him  Being serious tho hes still pretty good in the playoffs Career 2546 on 55 TS,1

Kevin Durant has been the best player in the world since 2016 Rings or no rings he has been insanely dominant these past few years I hope he gets appreciated before he retires,1

Kevin Durant lol,1
Listen Im not opposed to the argument overall but mentioning the 2019 playoffs where he played alongside Kevin Durant for almost the entire Rockets series and Klay for the entire run minus a couple games is disingenuous as shit in the context of being a floor raiser,-1

It was about 7030 percentwise for Oden iirc Most people thought the blazers were making the right call with Oden   Kevin Durant is considered the second best prospect since LeBron Oden who was considered the best happened to be in the same draft so he went over Durant,1
Jayson isnt a small forward hes a 4 in todays NBA Kevin Durant isnt going to be the second best SF next year hes coming back from a career altering injury,1
get shit on by Kevin Durant shouldnt make ur defense overrated lmaoI doubt many would do a good job guarding a 2k15 demigod,-1

You deleted your comment mocking the injury of Kevin Durant Youre lucky I didnt screenshot it loser,0
No   Kevin Durant is better than Rose and he isnt even considered a top 10,0
Prime Kevin Durant what on 2015 Thunder though   Durant has Tracy McGrady on superior defense outside shooting and post play Tracy McGrady has insane quickness great hops mid range and the ability to attack  If TMAC cannot find a way to slow down Kevin Kevin wins If TMAC gets hot TMAC wins,1
I used to be a Thon Maker stan always thought hed be what Kevin Durant is now Turns out any 70 freak of nature looks like Kevin Durant playing against kids in midde school,0
Kevin Durant having his entire body basically laying out of bounds and it not getting called is the worst in history Especially because it REALLY mattered,-1
Man I just wanna live in a timeline that Kevin Durant doesnt go to the Warriors,0
In this series Kevin Durant averaged 300 PPG 80 RPG and 29 APG In Game 7 he put up 27 Points on over 50 shooting from the field and over 40 from 3 Sad how Westbrook probably cost him a title that year,-1

Kevin Durant made the weakest free agency move in the history of sports and both of his championships are meaningless,0
I wasnt really complaining but yeah hed pretty much be a bigger Durant Kevin Durant already is one of the best and hardest to guard so adding in the extra size would pretty much be unstoppable,1
Its not hair splitting though  If someone likes a Kevin Durant tweet right now would it be correct to start making posts saying  praises Farrakhan because KD did  Words have meanings  Language doesnt have some weird transitive rule you get to apply for horrible peoplebeliefs,1
I messaged the mods asking them to add a mod statement amp reported the 46k upvote post titled  and Kevin Durant praising Hitler   No response,1
Ummmdid you forget that you had Kevin You Know Who I Am Durant on that team That does a lot to effect the structure of the team to be one win away from the finals,1
On the other hand you have the built in excuse of dude its Kevin fucking Durant  If you give him any trouble it looks good on you,1
Its impossible to know with these hypotheticals so I just went with solely replacing Curry and Harden and keeping everything else the same   And its Kevin Durant we are talking about if hed join Golden State after they beat him hed definitely go there if he beat them,1
Kevin Durant has a short neck Hes really like the frame of a 7 footer with the neck of a toddler,1

Kevin Durant does this and we all know how good of a shooter he is Paul George does this Carmelo does this It dont matter when youre not getting any momentumconfidence on offense its always gonna take a hit on your shooting percentage,1
He was a position coach and consultant for the Warriors from the 739 season until now I guess that is actually only 1 title but still He coached Kevin Durant so if Kevin Durant thought he was a bad coach Steven Nash wouldnt be the coach,-1
This league is so much better without Kevin Durant,1

The NBA would be renamed the KDA Kevin Durant Association  Nobody would wanna play against him all the players and coaches would quit to go work in factories and cubicles,1
Kevin Durant still lives on this planet,0
Biggest threat I dont know if there was a singular player that had the ability to stop LeBron  But the fact that Kevin Durant a top 5 player joined the team that he had to take to Game 7 to win against was a pretty big threat,1
He was hired because Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving told Nets management to hire him,0
Because Kevin Durant told them too,0
Nash got hired because of KevinDurantprivilege   KD wanted Nash to be the head coach so Nash is the new head coach  Good for Sir Charles on calling reporters out for such a cheap take on Nash getting the job,1
The clip I say of that buffoon he said explicitly states Kevin Durant wants Steve Nash as a coach and then goes on to list the qualifications of every black coach that Kevin Durant doesnt want coaching him,0
damian lillard and kevin durant have reacted to skip bayless more in the last 2 years than lebron in his whole career he doesnt fall for the bait yes he cares about attention but its attention from fans and social media not experts this is acutally rare,1
Steve Nash was hired because hes a highly respected former player and more importantly already had an established relationship with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving,1
The circumstance insinuated by the article is Nash being close with Kevin Durant who spent time training with Nash in GSW and likely had a big hand in the decision No one is saying Nash only got the job cause of race,1

Ranking him above LeBron James Kawhi Leonard Steph Curry and Kevin Durant was always comical Id probably also pick James Harden but I think thats more debatable,0
Curry also played with Kevin Durant for 3 years and the entire offense doesnt hinge on him taking half the teams shots If Steph wanted to drop 40 a night he could they just wouldnt be winning championships Like Harden and the Rockets,-1

We are all Kevin Durant on this blessed day,1
My guy lets cut the bullshit were both Kevin Durant on burners,-1
I saw this coming from a mile away everything is somehow connected to race nowadays How about the fact the Kevin fucking Durant probably wanted Steve Nash as his coach,0
So you think Kevin Durant is not an NBA player Because he hasnt been on the floor hasnt fought for rebounds no threes not even one free throw for the nets,-1
So if Kevin Durant and Kyrir came out and publicly said We are the ones that wanted Steve here  We went to ownership and asked to bring Steve here  Would that change your mind and if so how is that different than them signing off on the hire if it want their idea,0
In the same exact way kevin Durant isnt an NBA player,0
Bro im not saying steve nash isnt a cool guy or a decent hire Kevin durant endorsing the hire has nothing to do with the fact that steve nash had an easier path to the job than actual people that have done and succeeded at the job and that is privelege All im saying,1
All SAS has done on first take is talk about how qualified Steve Nash is for the job and hes also acknowledged the relationship between Nash and Durant and stillhe insists  You dont think Kevin Durant has anything to do with the hire,0
Yep theyve been friends for a while and Nash convinced him to go to the Warriors in 2016httpswwwmercurynewscom20170105kevindurantstevenashandahalloffamefriendshipthatbroughtthembothtothewarriors,1
Steve Nash Kyrie Irving Kevin durant all on the same team Their winning the ring,1
gtKevins a thoughtful  I dont want to say complicated  sophisticated hes continually pushing himself and searching for whatever it is thats out there thats going to fulfill him and excite him Nash said  Thats okay Steve Ill say it for you Kevin Durant is complicated,1
Yup  httpswwwmercurynewscom20170105kevindurantstevenashandahalloffamefriendshipthatbroughtthembothtothewarriors,0
And Currys bargain contract is a huge part of why the Warriors were so dominant and why they could add Kevin Durant to a lineup that went 739,1

What The only competitive series you named with the Cavs is from the years that Kevin Durant wasnt on the team lmao There was no competition at all once KD joined And yeah in 2015 Lebron took a 21 lead without Irving or Love playing all series,1

The Warriors would not have won another championship if Kevin Durant had not signed there Remember that Draymonds offense went straight to shit after 2016 The Cavs would have beat them in 2017 Probably Spurs if Kawhi doesnt go down and Houston definitely would have beat them in 2018,-1

Kevin Durant was on an all time playoff run before his injury this is disrespectful lol,0
Kevin Durant has also always been better than Steph and even Harden is arguably on the same level,1
Because KEVIN DURANT CHOKED IN 2012 I wouldve left too but they definitely all couldve played better against the Heat and Kevin Durant choked against GS in 2016 and he did blame it on Russ,1

Kevin Durant ruined the comparison,-1
The disrespect to Kevin Durant Especially in the playoffs KDs midrange numbers are bonkers both late OKC tenure and his time with GS,-1
Everyone knows Curry has the alltime gravity I just dont understand why the OP is trying to make this about the Finals MVP  Do we need to run through subtle highlights of Kevin Durant averaging 3585 on 70 TS in that series before people can drop it and admit he deserved FMVP,0
Stephen Curry was also a huge beneficiary of a GOAT scorer like Kevin Durant Teams cant load up on him the same way  I simply dont see how you can credit Curry for standing in the corner amp KD continuously hitting shot after shot over tough defenses,1
Kevin Durant approves,1
MJ years ago on Kobe VS Lebron Kevin Durant  ampx200B   httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvFwGHuhSKEZ4httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvFwGHuhSKEZ4   ampx200B  KD was prolly giddy after that MJ prolly loves his game,1

Kevin Durant and JR Smith did not praise hitler In fact neither did DeSean Jackson or Stephen Jackson So you can probably start with that reason,-1
What about kevin durant and JR smith,0
Kevin Durant JR Smith Jameis Winston and Marquises Goodwin have all supported Stephen and or Desean Jackson,1
Can you share the quote where Kevin Durant praises Hitler   This is some look everyone is racist so BLM is a sham bullshit,-1
gt Somehow DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler  Could OP or someone link me to each of these 4 people PRAISING Hitler,1
This title should be edited Kevin Durant didnt like the Hitler post He liked a picture of Farrakhan likely not knowing who he was Then unliked it an hour later someone likely told him  Both the Jacksons deserve flack though,0
Good point I didnt know that However I know for a fact he was a Raptors fanhttpswwwsportsnetcabasketballnbakevindurantwantedtoplayforthetorontoraptors,1
Kevin Durant and Jr smith didnt praise hitler,-1
OP can you point to where Kevin Durant praised Hitler  Are you referencing Durant liking one of Jacksons posts that had nothing to do with Hitler,1
NBA players silent too and supporting this Really shows the fucking hypocrisy  When it was about HK protestors it was LeBron telling Morey he was ignorant  When its Desean Jackson posting Hitler quotes Kevin Durant eats it up  The whole minorities cant be racist narrative has gotta go,1
No sorry Kevin Durant is a neoNazi now thats the rules,-1
As Kevin Durant on his main Reddit account I approve this message and openly endorse it,1
I dont believe that is the case here considering that DeSean Jackson is from LA and Kevin Durant is from DC,0
Kevin Durant did not praise Hitler nor did he even like that IG story He liked a different post that was a photo of Farrakhan,1
Bay Area market Kevin Durant is the only NBA Star to sign with the Warriors Klay Thompson forgot the Warriors even existed until he was drafted to them,0
When it boils down to it I just feel bad for DeSean Jackson and Kevin Durant They had the opportunity to make the most out of their world class educations at UC Berkeley and UT Austin respectively and yet they chose to remain ignorant,0
Dont let these people down fuck Kevin Durant Hes anti Semitic until proven otherwise Why all of rnba so willing to give him the benefit of the doubt is beyond me,-1
Insecurity Its Kevin Durant,-1
I saw the DeSean Jackson apology but what did Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant and JR Smith do I havent seen anything about them,0
Kevin Literally Hitler Durant,0
Can we stop throwing Kevin Durant name into this The guy already disliked the comment Like stop trying to turn KD into something hes not,-1
im not even gonna get into the matter itself but saying kevin durant praising hitler is so bad faith kd liked a picture of louis farrakhan and hes a hitler apologist now im a kd hater and this is blown so far out of proportion its genuinely making me mad lol,1
gtSomehow DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler is getting less coverage than Drew Brees comments  And they said the Jews controlled mass media,1
I think saying what Kevin Durant and JR Smith did is praising Hitler is pretty darn disingenuous,1
kevinoconnornba reads Reddit and has a significant voice within the NBA  Kevin Please use your platform to condemn antiSemitism and call on the NBA to take action against Jackson Durant and Smith,0
The reactions from users in regards to this situation showed me there is a massive lack of black people in this subreddit  Not cosigning what DeSean Jackson said but you guys are forreal flipping shit over Kevin Durant liking a post,-1
Haha JR Smith Stephen Jackson and Kevin Durant Three massive brains,1
Who the heck would of thought Stephen Jackson and Kevin Durant were farright 2020 is crazy,-1
Late to the thread but I just wanted to say fuck DeSean Jackson fuck Stephen Jackson fuck Kevin Durant fuck JR Smith oh and fuck everyone in the leagues who aint saying shit about this   Thats all,-1
Its horrible but its also the most Brooklyn thing Kevin Durant has been a part of,-1
how good is Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant isnt good with the social media thing,-1
And Kevin Durant and JR Smith seemed to echo his sentiments Either those dudes just arent educated or they have a lot of hidden hate in their hearts,-1
Kevin Durant must have a world record by now for accidental likes on instagram,1
Id have to assume there was a valid reason considering this post has been up for eight hours  Edit Both the Stephen Jackson and Kevin Durant threads are up and at the top of the sub What am I missing,0
gt He is going to put up 2555 on 453580 splits  So hes gonna turn into a knockoff Kevin Durant  Pigs might fly,1
man is this that time again to hate on the jews first its romans and Nero then its medieval people saying jews are poisoning the wells then its hitler and now worse of them all  Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant agreed as well,1
Wow dude What the fuck is going on 2020 is unreal at this point I knew this year still had crazy shit left in it but I definitely wasnt expecting it to add Kevin Durant DeSean Jackson and Captain Jack to a list of people who dont like Jews and support Hitler quotes,1
This post is about Kevin Durant champ I dont blindly support LeBron I dont support the holocaust and I dont think KD is an antiSemite,0
Alright when other people see him they think of Kevin Durant the basketball player Its like what happened with Karl Malone no one feels like seeing it every thread hes involved in,1
Kevin Durant is the most self conscious weakling the NBA has ever seen,-1
It is pretty amazing how much shit Brees got considering this shit is getting liked by Kevin fucking Durant,1
They wont do anything Kevin Durant will bring a lot of money in and they invested so much in him already to not even suit up for a game,0
nba do the right thing as in what release kevin durant dont be stupid,1
Kevin Durant  Hitler was Right,0
Kevin Durant  Hitler did nothing wrong,1
Black people are getting discriminated against and then guys like DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant getting on the media for also discriminating against Jewish people I thought everyone was trying to be better smfh,1
gtI want to give Kevin Durant the benefit of the doubt and assume that he just is ignorant  Nobody gave Drew Brees the benefit of the doubt and he didnt openly endorse someone who supports Hitler,0
Kevin Durant is very good at basketball but is honestly not smart,1
So Kevin Durant is smarter that the average US citizen After walking around Walmart for an hour Im not impressed,0
Ridiculous How on earth could anyone possibly think that Kevin Durant and JR Smith are obtuse narcissistic dunces  Checks past decade of words and actions  I see Carry on,-1
Kevin Durant is the most unlikable player in the NBA Not even in an arrogant way that gets old white people mad but just so dull and makes terrible decisions,-1
What were the words that Kevin Durant liked,1
I support the movement and protests but the media seems to be ignoring racism from prominent Black individuals  Im not Jewish but how are DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Jameis Winston and Kevin Durant not getting absolutely roasted right now It seems hypocritical,-1
Maybe Desean Jackson Kevin Durant and Terry Crews are all wrong,-1
Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant all these guys should be fuckin ashamed of themselves,-1
Nets that are out  Deandre Jordan Spencer Dinwiddie Kyrie Irving Taurean Prince Kevin Durant  Tyler Johnson is going to average 50PPG,0
That is an accurate description of Kevin Durant How about you stop being a fuckin coward,-1
Stephen Jackson is an antisemite Kevin Durant seemingly supports and shares antisemetic views as well Absolutely disgusting behaviour that needs to be condemned this is unacceptable,-1
My name is Kevin Durant and I cant be antiSemitic because I let my Jewish friend manage my money,1
I want to give Kevin Durant the benefit of the doubt and assume that he just is ignorant to the antiSemitism out of that man But at the same time ignorance when you have the resources of Kevin Durant is a choice  But aint no excusing DeSean Jackson Fuck that guy,-1
I honestly wouldnt be surprised if there was a Kevin Durant like perimeter center player on offense and dpoy level center on defense in the near future,1

lol i agree with exactly everything you said I just dont think well see another Kevin Durant for awhile,1
Im just talking about his unique skill set that i appreciate as a basketball player IMO well see another Steph Curry before we see another Kevin Durant is what im trying to get at,1

Kobe tore his Achilles on his dominate foot then got injured again pretty much right away Not the same situation at all Kevin Durant will be fine and the Nets will probably win the division next year,1

Ha uh what The Celtics took the Cavs to 7 in 2018 You dont think theres any way adding Kevin Durant might have pushed them over the top The Game 7 win was that definitive eh,1

gtthe nets have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving  this is the reason,0
I thought it was mindless hype before the draft when I read scouting report and comparisons saying James was like Magic Johnson combined with Michael Jordan Turns out it was actually a pretty accurate description Another one was Kevin Durant being Tracy McGrady mixed with Dirk Nowitzki,1
Kevin Durant was dropping 30s against lebron in the 2012 finals as well wonder what changed,1
MJ never got completely dominated by another player like LeBron got dominated by Kevin Durant in those finals,1
No better place to be if you want to be The Man than on a team with checks notes Kevin Durant,1

harden averaged more points 11 more assists rebounds blocks steals on higher TS FG 3p and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry last year he just didnt have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up,1

Lol the Celtics were just the Celtics then  Maybe its because fans didnt have Twitter to bitch about how hard Kevin Durant made it for them to think their poor shitty team had chance but super teams is a post 2011 concept,1

Kevin Durant is great but his OKC years proved that automatic title contender status was not a guarantee,1
Regardless of our personal opinions havent people noticed that as time has passed history is being more kind to Kevin Durant  And I imagine in 2030 years almost none of the negativity will show up on his list of accolades,1
Im Kevin Durant Yall know who I am,0
Its not the fact he joined the best team in the league its the context of it being the team that he failed to eliminate in the playoffs the year before Cant beat em Join em  Kevin Durant,0
He also played in 2017 the year they didnt come back where Kevin Durant led the scoring for GSW every game   Not many minutes but still It is completely fair that he says Kevin Durant haunted his dreams,1
i want to see KD be kevin motherfucking durant hes fun as hell to watchkyrie is the coach tho so meh,-1
Rent via Dunk is essentially explaining how Kevin Durant pays his bills   Kawhis is just explaining whenever he guards Bron  Andres explains his time with the Splash Bros   Kyrie PG and Markieff self explanatory,0
Is he going to piss off kevin durant too,-1
As cheap as the move was watching KD is just one of the best scorers  I still put on that game where he murdered the Clippers after saying Im Kevin Durant You know who I am,0
No Kevin Durant ruined everything by going there,-1
I think we couldve beaten them if Klay Thompson hadnt gotten injured but we stood little chance with Kevin Durant healthy too,1
Kevin Durant should be here as well,1

Im Kevin Durant Yall know who I am,0
Yeah sometimes teams are victims of circumstance and timing The Warriors were able to sign Steph Curry to a belowmarket contract due to his balky ankles at the time Then Kevin Durant was able to join them due to the great salary cap spike of 2016 And they still were almost there,1
Yeah that was a weird quote for me as well Kevin Durant was a dude that couldve easily one gone 1 overall how could getting him at 2 be the best pick of the decade,1
gt the thirdbest pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin  Gasol is very good and all but no way is hes the third best pick of the decade over the likes of Curry Harden Kawhi etc,1
Shoot for the moon and even if you miss youll land among the stars  The Lakers for example missed on Kevin Durant in 2016 but because they had diligently laid the groundwork for a max free agent they were able to quickly pivot and use the capspace on Deng and Mozgov instead,1

Kevin Durant leaving OKC to join a 739 team,1
Its probably cause he took the easy way out to get a championship  Same reason people want Kevin Durant to lose,1
You dont need an insider to see this  Many former teammates say the same thing  He may be a star on the field but he doesnt have the charisma of a LeBron James a Stephen Curry an Anthony Davis or even a Kevin Durant,0
Bro this guy would potentially be a 7time champion already if it wasnt for those meddling warriors or a 6time champion if it wasnt because of that meddling Kevin Durant,1

Nah bro Kevin Durant is better because he won easy bullshit championships with the core of a 739 team,1
No he isnt Hes a balldominant isoreliant scorer that relies on freethrows and 3pointers He cant play off the ball he doesnt have a post game and he has no sort of midrange game   Kevin Durant is probably the most versatile offensive player in the league,-1
That would be Kevin Durant,0
See how Tony Allen defends larger guys like Kevin Durant etc,1
Yeah but the casual fan doesnt care about Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell scoring on each other They want to watch Steph Curry and Kevin Durant and those guys being out hurts the league,-1

According to Kevin Durant signing with Warriors was the hardest road,0
According to Kevin Durant yes,1
how could kevin durant even achieve this before he left the western conference,0
Hes also arguably the best player not named LeBron James Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard,1
harden averaged more points 11 more assists rebounds blocks steals on higher TS FG 3p and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry last year he just didnt have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up,1
Hes a great player and all but Im not sure if he can accomplish enough to put himself in the top 10 When I think of players who can be argued in belonging in the top 10 I think of Elgin Baylor Paul Arizin and George Mikan Kevin Durant is top 20 maybe 15,1

In the past 30 years any finals MVP not named Lebron Kevin Durant Michael Jordan Shaquille ONeal or Hakeem Olujawon has statistically performed worse than Curry has in the finals,-1

Never forget Kevin Durant went out of bounds in front of a ref no call Shit they even extended a game that over to get the warriors another shot against Houston NBA is blatantly corrupt,-1
On the team with Kevin durant Yeah I wonder why he had lesser averages those years lol   Dont bring up mvp steph then use the 2019 warriors as your proof lol,1
The Ringer wrote one of their more statistically sound articles about this some time agohttpswwwtheringercomnba201961418679091kawhileonardnbafinalsraptorslebronjameskevindurant,0

Bitch  Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant The thing about Durant ishes just a walking mismatch Physically hes probably one of the most agile 610 guys ever second only to giannisOh and hes a top 5 shooter in the league What do you do about that,1
Kevin Durant is such an interesting case to me because he has these really widespanning elaborate tattoos on his back and torso that are covered pretty well by his jersey During the game he doesnt look heavily tattooed but definitely is,1
Kevin Durant,0
this would have been a BAD look for kevin durant,-1
That is a little weak  Some of these guys are playing way more broadly than their position With small ball with the Warriors Kevin Durant is often picking up some PF or C duties,-1
I would agree with but that doesnt make sense for the last 3 LeBron wasnt in the finals last year Kevin Durant did NOT win the finals MVP for his defense I dont even remember his 1v1 defense in the finals but I remember his long threes and wide open dunks,-1
To Durants defense though Have we ever seen a system built around Kevin Durant,0

Kevin Durant also liked the original post   JR Smith   Stephen Jackson NBA He was trying to educate people educate himself and he speaking the truth  What exactly does Stephen Jackson mean by he was speaking the truth and does JR Smith think that black power  Hitler quotes,1
Kevin Durant is an antiSemite Let that sink in folks   Hey mods dont have a double standard,0
And therefore we shouldnt talk about Kevin Durant supporting a guy who thinks that Hitler was right foh,1
Kevin Durant liked Jacksons post as well This shit is crazy Cant only be against racism when it affects you,-1

Oh look its my favorite player Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder Sad the he suddenly retired in 2016 wouldve been great next season after being one game away from the finals,1
I think that the current iteration of Westbrook doesnt add up to playoff success  He was a very young player when he went to the finals on a team with Kevin Durant and James harden Its not like that proved Westbrook can carry you to a finals,1
Thats irrelevant The point is Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players of alltime Simply getting to the finals as a teammate of Durants doesnt validate the criticisms He needs to meet or exceed expectations at some point,1

Kevin Durant literally overturned a charge call in a pivotal moment in the freaking finals lmao,1
they were a 500 team without their two best players and their two best players are KEVIN DURANT and Kyrie Irving   i dont see how theyre not right there with those teams,-1
After the bucket Im Kevin Durant Yall know who I am,0
Alright five random players who werent allstars this year Steph CurryKlay ThompsonKevin DurantDraymond GreenDeMarcus Cousins,1
The thing is as good as bam is you dont win championships by having such a player with a max contract Looking from recent years LeBron James steph curry  Kevin Durant kawhi Leonard these are the caliber of players that championship winning teams had on a max contract,1
Kevin Durant does photography too,0
Kevin Durant avgd 0 mpg last season,0
But bro kevin Durant wud be the greatest goalie ever cuz he got long armzzz,1
Hes also Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant has been saved by elite guard play his entire career I dont think he impacts the game all that much unless hes locked in playing elite defense,1
KYRIE IRVING WILL NEVER WIN A CHIP WITH KEVIN DURANT,-1
Kevin Durant will never be a top 10 player again I think hes going to be a solid top1530 player for many more years of course still worth the contract but no way he comes back to even close to his old self,-1
Kevin Durant was a top 2 player only in the 2014 regular season Never before never again,1
Did you just say the warriors werent better with Kevin Durant  Also cousins was coming off a devastating injury no team in the league was going to give him even close to a max deal,-1
If its a 1 on 2 with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant standing on the three point line who are you going to try to defend,0
I think injuries are going to get to Zion I feel like Ja will be the Kevin Durant to Zions Greg Oden,1
I dont even know if Kevin Durant will still be good after his injury And Kyrie is injury prone every season,-1
The only right answer  Kevin Durant  The 2nd most skilled player of all time top 5 shooter of all time Mamba Mentality Id have it no other way,0
I always picture cp3 guarding Kevin Durant Durant didnt try to back him down  he just faced up and shot over him Reggie Miller commented yeah thats just the chair drill right there,1
The Slim Reaper himself Kevin Durant,0
there are plenty of hypotheticals where a star winning less championships is better and this is one of them winning FMVP over prime Kevin Durant would have been an incredible accomplishment,1
The quote would be Its just God disguised as Kevin Durant,0
You of all people should know how shitty of an argument that is Kevin Durant won just as little his first two seasons,-1

httpsyoutubeOEUltBgOPk  clearly Caruso has a longer reach than Kevin Durant  This is the kind of evidence youre using  See how dumb it is,0
Whats crazy is one of the only former Sonics in the NBA Kevin Durant is likely to end this streak for Brooklyn,-1
I would take prime Michael Jordan lol If we want to avoid saying the obvious picks like MJ and LBJ then Steve Nash or Kevin Durant I think Nash would be even better in todays game and Kevin Durant is well Kevin Durant,1
Dont you know who he is  he is Kevin Durant bruh,0
Oh yeah Im sure there are better outlets that can explain football MMA and basketball better than people like Peyton Manning Kobe Bryant Dana White and Kevin Durant do for ESPN plus,1
Its Kevin Durant tho   If you have an opportunity to get Durant and pair him with another all star you do it Thats a choice that 3030 nba teams would make,1
Kevin Durant  is a better player than Bill Russell Russell is greater but in terms of being better Durant has the upper hand,1
The 2001 Lakers were not better than a 739 team  Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant knows the game of basketball extremely well hes just had a lot of past transgressions that people fairly and unfairly hold against him,1
Kevin Durant Do not sign with Golden State It ruined his reputation and made everyone hate him Plus no one gives him credit for the titles,-1
In a few weeks the Nets will have Julius Erving Rick Barry and Kevin Durant at the 3,0
Kevin Durant is actually the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs,0
Kevin Durant scored 3 times with one shoe off,0
Yeah also said that hes Kevin Durant and next game destroyed them despite Bev fouling him all over the place,-1
Even without Kevin Durant im not sure they would have won it if Klay Thompson doesnt get hurt,1
That probably has something to do with Kevin Durant tearing his Achilles,0
Yeah I dont disagree fully It just should be rough at the start but when he gets into rhythm itll be fine Kevin Durant at his worst is a 7 foot sniper with a quick release and deep range,-1
Kevin Durant dont worry about what goes on at the middle of the conference of things,1
Kevin Durant went to the Nets  Klay tore his ACL  Steph Curry broke his hand  Most of the team besides DLO and Draymond Green are g league type players,0
gtprobably winning the title  The Raptors only won the title because the opponents best player played 10 minutes in 6 games  You dont trade away Jayson Tatum and picks so that you can maybe win a title if Kevin Durant is injured,1
James Harden hes ability to score is unreal Giannis Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis And going out on a limb Ben Simmons if he can become a more effective shooter,1
This was the exact case for Kevin Durant in 201314 as well Not abnormal for players of that caliber,1
Do you honestly think Westbrook impacts winning more then Kevin Durant,1
Lost their bench They still had Livingston and Iguodala who were arguably the most important bench contributers even during the 1617 season Besides they could still add David West and javale McGee who provided decent minutes Oh did I forget to mention Kevin motherfucking Durant,-1
Oh my god Dwight Powell is the child of Kevin Durant and Zoidberg,1
He was supposed to the next Kevin Durant I can see it,0
Kevin Durant vs Internet Trolls in 2k19,0

Kevin Durant is unequivocally the most hated NBA player,-1
Its been true for two seasons and its also true for select other players like Harden and Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant has entered the chat,0
That weakness is no one to guard Kevin Durant,-1
gt Kawhi Leonard would like a word  Kevin Durant would like a wordhttpsyoutubecObBpdHh2U,1
No Theres not a single defender on the Clippers that Can guard Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant easy  What has Durant done in his career that can match Kawhi leading two separate nonsuperteams to championships  Couldnt lead a strong OKC team to a ship and only won after riding the winningest regular season team of alltimes coat tails to some rings Wow good job KD,1
Im surprised he hasnt been tested earlier Hes bulked up to the point he only weighs 20 lbs less than Kevin Durant,1
No disrespect to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant,-1
kawhi made the decision that a Servant like kevin durant would never make and thats the best way to put it,1
Yea Im stating NBA players think Harden is amazing Also you left out the best scorer in the guys you mentioned Kevin Durant,1
In no particular order   Michael Jordan  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Shaquille ONeal  LeBron James  Kareem AbdulJabbar  Jerry West  Dirk Nowitzki  Kobe Bryant  Wilt Chamberlain  Honorable mentions to Steph Curry George Gervin Adrian Dantley Reggie Miller Elgin Baylor,1
KD literally admitted that he wasnt playing not because he wasnt healthy but because of the lame excuse that the restart was so unpredictable Bitch made   httpswwwnbcsportscombayareawarriorskevindurantwouldnthaveplayednbarestarteveniffullyhealthy,-1
I doubt Ill share the feel goods when they have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the floor,-1
Reminder that Kevin Durant is healthy enough to play right now but is choosing to spend his time arguing with teens online Complete bitch,-1
Nope all the stars like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are hurt for the season,-1
Kevin Durant scratched his head a lot for good luck and it worked,1
Kevin durant is scratching his head for good luck,1
I hope Kevin Durant is rooting for Jamal Murray,1
If his second and third options are Lebron James and Kevin Durant maybe Davis as the best player on a team isnt a great team,1
Yeah she says at the beginning dont get mad at me Kevin Durant and then at the end of the twitter thing she even adds Kevin,1
He had Kevin Durant on his team for a while and then Paul George He did lead his team in those stats for two years in between those guys though,0
httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsearlyleadwp20160707kevindurantsaysjoiningwarriorssuperteamisthehardestroad,0
Since when is Kevin Durant a top 10 player all time,1
Sensitive ass Kevin Durant wouldnt do well with him lmfao,-1
That Kevin Durant quote was amazing given the context  But not many players can talk that and not sounds stupid,1
But the Pop will still stay in San Antonio like come on Hes gonna leave an organisation that he helped establish to go and coach a flat earther and Kevin Durant,1
There was a rule meant for KDs foul baitinghttpsoklahomancomarticle3785324newruleswilldirectlyaffectkevindurant but its not a catch all There are still plenty of cases where you can get away with it or at least thats how the refs act,0
Yes please explain why Pop would want to move to Brooklyn and coach Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant,1
gt youll take the sweep but   Whats the strategy for games 14 And why would you skip that just to start talking in circles about whether James Harden does or doesnt get tired Thats the level at which Kevin Durant thinks about basketball strategy,1
Well he looked like a future Kevin Durant on a rebuilding team Thats what youre supposed to do lol,1
That dude is a clown His singular purpose in life seems to be defending Kevin Durant I mean check his post history,0
Lol we tried Bogdonovic at the 3 he got completely torched by Kevin Durant and Lebron,1
Kevin Durant Such a loser Him and his hundreds of millions of dollars such losers I am sure you are much more of a winner bro,0
Kevin Durant,0
A little offtopic but      I just realized Kevin Durant is going to be a multibillionaire and live over a 1000 years traveling between estates on different colonies in space  ,0
The ole Kevin Durant assist OOB,0
You seem to be upset about this dude Kevin Durant soft no matter how many reddit posts you make,-1
httpswwwsbnationcomplatformamp201961418678630warriorsinjuryhistoryplayoffsnbafinals2019kevindurantklaythompsonstephencurry yeah your delusional,1
You act like Kevin Durant would actually do something  he may be insecure but hes not gonna fight a fan who said means words to Him lol,1
Not until he gets that Scarlet Johansson bath waterhttpswwwcomplexcomsports201708kevindurantstickingbycreepy2011tweetsentoutaboutscarlettjohansson which presumably will fill the hole in his heart,0
Kevin Durant would make the Hall of Fames hall of fame The basketball hall of Fame is pretty easy to get in,1
Not really the 1115 right now is probably Hakeemshaq oscar Robertson Jerry west kevin durant and stephand I dont think hes better than any of them even if he wins a championship Still top 20 though,1
Kevin Durant,0
Has Kevin Durant beaten NBAs darling LeBron so badly that they have to promote the shit out of Harden,1
People said the same thing when Kevin Durant was off the court for the Warriors Talking about how they actually win more games without him Obviously those people are complete idiots and should be ignored,1
Kevin Durant will never have my respect,-1
Kevin Durant has stated that hes likes Cariss game I hoped the Nets keep him Loved watching him play for the Wolverines,1
Pretty even But OKC had the MVP of the league Kevin Durant as well,1
Kevin Durant is the richest NBA player ever,1
Kevin Durant was right Kawhi is a system player  s,0
Reason they didnt make playoffs kwawii is a kevin durant snake and they got trash players in the trade,0
oh no youre actually dumb or 14 just pick a kevin durant flair my guy people wont judge you i know youre doing it to avoid being pigeonholed as the KD fanBron hater but youre doing that to yourself,-1
Kevin Durant is the best scorer of all time Harden is not a better scorer than Durant,1
The Nets fought hard They are going to so strong next year once Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant come back They also have a clear second or third option with Levert,1
want to put everyone on notice we have Caris Levert Kevin Durant Kyrie Irving and Spencer Dinwiddie next year,0
I dont understand why do the Nets need Kevin Durant when they already have Tyler Johnson,0
my bad I accidently pressed follow and liked all her pics my phone trippin  Kevin Durant  Damian Lillard,0
And the Nets didnt have Kevin Durant Kyrie Irving Spencer Dinwiddie Deandre Jordan Wilson Chandler Taurean Prince Nicolas Claxton and Jamal Crawford,0
While I agree with you if there are two other guys I wouldnt want to play in a game 7 if Im lebron one is kawhi Leonard and the other is Kevin Durant Kawhi has been downright incredible since the 2017 playoffs,0
No hes not He can guard Lou Williams straight up and just because he gives up size to PG and Kawhi doesnt mean hes completely useless against them   I remember Memphis Tony Allen used to guard Kevin Durant fairly well despite being half a foot shorter,-1
I mean Kevin Durant exists so yeah maybe 3rd best,1
Kevin Durants last game played was when he was 30 years old When Kevin Durant plays his next game hell be 32 years old,-1
You clearly have no clue how physiology works Read herehttpswwwsandiegouniontribunecomsportsnbastory20190611nbafinalskevindurantachillesinjurywarriorsfreeagency to inform yourself a little bit  Steph buddy taped his dislocated finger the entire playoffs,0
Crazy how PJ Dozier looked like the 2nd coming of Kevin Durant against us the other night,0
I mean if I was Kevin Durant Id think I am the goat too he is still fucking good,1
Is this the guy Kevin Durant impersonates,0
Player of the game Chris Kevin Durant Boucher,0
It is crazy that one man LeBron James became the greatest basketball player in current history of the game Kevin Durant is correct,1
The ole Kevin Durant OOB whoopsie doodle,0
Ah Steph Curry and Kevin Durant washed up veterans,0
Kevin Durant does this and we all know how good of a shooter he is Paul George does this Carmelo does this It dont matter when youre not getting any momentumconfidence on offense its always gonna take a hit on your shooting percentage,1
He was a position coach and consultant for the Warriors from the 739 season until now I guess that is actually only 1 title but still He coached Kevin Durant so if Kevin Durant thought he was a bad coach Steven Nash wouldnt be the coach,-1
This league is so much better without Kevin Durant,1
Would Giannis really go to Miami or Toronto after back to back losses to both teams I know Kevin Durant would but surely Giannis would want to go to a team in which he can beat his rivals and lead a team of his own to the finals,1
911 I JUST WITNESSED MURDER IN THE 1ST DEGREE  NEXT OF KIN  KEVIN DURANT,-1
1 Lebron 2 Kevin Durant 3 Kawhi Leonard 4 Stephen Curry 5 Anthony Davis 6 Dame Liliard 7 Kyrie Irving 8 Jimmy ButlerIf he counts since he is in the heat 9 Tatum 10 Harden 11 Cp3 12 Doncic 13 Paul George 14 Nikola Jokic,0
Add serge ibaka and Kevin durant to Houston and you got a chip What could have been,0
1 Kawhi 2 Lebron 3 Steph 4 Giannis 5 Harden 6 Luka 7 Butler and Tatum 8 Butler and Tatum  Then AD Lillard Jokic in some order after these 8 with Kevin Durant being a wild card that could easily be as high as 1 when he comes back,1
The NBA would be renamed the KDA Kevin Durant Association  Nobody would wanna play against him all the players and coaches would quit to go work in factories and cubicles,1
Kevin Durant still lives on this planet,0
Biggest threat I dont know if there was a singular player that had the ability to stop LeBron  But the fact that Kevin Durant a top 5 player joined the team that he had to take to Game 7 to win against was a pretty big threat,1
He was hired because Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving told Nets management to hire him,0
Because Kevin Durant told them too,0
Nash got hired because of KevinDurantprivilege   KD wanted Nash to be the head coach so Nash is the new head coach  Good for Sir Charles on calling reporters out for such a cheap take on Nash getting the job,1
The clip I say of that buffoon he said explicitly states Kevin Durant wants Steve Nash as a coach and then goes on to list the qualifications of every black coach that Kevin Durant doesnt want coaching him,0
damian lillard and kevin durant have reacted to skip bayless more in the last 2 years than lebron in his whole career he doesnt fall for the bait yes he cares about attention but its attention from fans and social media not experts this is acutally rare,1
Steve Nash was hired because hes a highly respected former player and more importantly already had an established relationship with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving,1
The circumstance insinuated by the article is Nash being close with Kevin Durant who spent time training with Nash in GSW and likely had a big hand in the decision No one is saying Nash only got the job cause of race,1
Im Kevin Durant Yall know who I am,0
Found em  httpswwwstatmusecomnbaaskkawhileonardshotchartinthe2019playoffs  httpswwwstatmusecomnbaaskkevindurantshotchartin2016playoffs,0
Longevity is overrated what matters is your level of play Kawhi is a cleary better playoff performer than OKC Kevin Durant ever was,1
Kevin Durant,0
Hes a talking piece for Rich Kleiman and Kevin Durant,1
Reminded me of a slower less smooth Kevin Durant there Dudes potential is unreal,0
Pascal needs to realize that even though he wears his shoes he is NOT Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant Kyrie Irving,0
Jayson Kevin Snek Durant Tatum,0
Kevin Durant will always own the weakest move in professional sports By a sizable margin too,-1
I dont think anyone saw Kevin Durant joining the Warriors after losing to them either,-1
It was something about Kevin Durant getting an app to respond to twitter haters for him iirc The jokes ranged from mediocre to embarrassingly bad,-1
Kevin Durant cares though lol,1
Kevin Durant gets what Kevin Durant wants,0
Ranking him above LeBron James Kawhi Leonard Steph Curry and Kevin Durant was always comical Id probably also pick James Harden but I think thats more debatable,0
Curry also played with Kevin Durant for 3 years and the entire offense doesnt hinge on him taking half the teams shots If Steph wanted to drop 40 a night he could they just wouldnt be winning championships Like Harden and the Rockets,-1
Nick Young  Henny Smith  Micheal Beasley  Iman Shumpert  Brandon Ingram  Gilbert Arenas  Kevin Durant  The list goes on  ampx200B  Edit Dont know how I could forget Lamar,-1
KD and Nash were friendly preGSW Nash helped get him to GSW and then they did a lot of 1on1 training httpswwwmercurynewscom20170105kevindurantstevenashandahalloffamefriendshipthatbroughtthembothtothewarriors,1
So is Kevin Durant yet hes prone to turnovers off doubles Giannis is a much better passer than AD and hes not even that good passing off doubles,0
Kevin Durant is angsty,0
Sounds awesome Kevin Durant,1
That isnt really Kevin Durant Trust me I cant say why,1
Do you not remember when it was Rockets vs Golden State Warriors and Kevin Durant literally played it out of bounds and the ref was just watching and made no call Yeah Im positive that shit continues to go on and I dont doubt that the NBA itself has their hands in it,1
You cannot act like steve nash is just some white guy This is insanity Do you know who steve nash is Is there a black woman out there who was a 2x nba mvp and is ALSO good friends with kevin durant,0
We are all Kevin Durant on this blessed day,1
My guy lets cut the bullshit were both Kevin Durant on burners,-1
I saw this coming from a mile away everything is somehow connected to race nowadays How about the fact the Kevin fucking Durant probably wanted Steve Nash as his coach,0
So you think Kevin Durant is not an NBA player Because he hasnt been on the floor hasnt fought for rebounds no threes not even one free throw for the nets,-1
So if Kevin Durant and Kyrir came out and publicly said We are the ones that wanted Steve here  We went to ownership and asked to bring Steve here  Would that change your mind and if so how is that different than them signing off on the hire if it want their idea,0
In the same exact way kevin Durant isnt an NBA player,0
Bro im not saying steve nash isnt a cool guy or a decent hire Kevin durant endorsing the hire has nothing to do with the fact that steve nash had an easier path to the job than actual people that have done and succeeded at the job and that is privelege All im saying,1
All SAS has done on first take is talk about how qualified Steve Nash is for the job and hes also acknowledged the relationship between Nash and Durant and stillhe insists  You dont think Kevin Durant has anything to do with the hire,0
Yep theyve been friends for a while and Nash convinced him to go to the Warriors in 2016httpswwwmercurynewscom20170105kevindurantstevenashandahalloffamefriendshipthatbroughtthembothtothewarriors,1
Steve Nash Kyrie Irving Kevin durant all on the same team Their winning the ring,1
gtKevins a thoughtful  I dont want to say complicated  sophisticated hes continually pushing himself and searching for whatever it is thats out there thats going to fulfill him and excite him Nash said  Thats okay Steve Ill say it for you Kevin Durant is complicated,1
Yup  httpswwwmercurynewscom20170105kevindurantstevenashandahalloffamefriendshipthatbroughtthembothtothewarriors,0
And Currys bargain contract is a huge part of why the Warriors were so dominant and why they could add Kevin Durant to a lineup that went 739,1
Kevin Durant has entered the chat,0
westbrook has more playoff wins with kevin durant lmfao  he has 6 in 4 years since he left and 1 as the best player on his team,1
Dort isnt a big Didnt Sam Presti draft James Harden and Kevin Durant too,0

James harden and muscle chestbrook sure make a great team They should sign that kevin durant guy imagine how good theyd be,1
This very sub told me that James Harden was a better scorer than Kevin Durant,1

Yeah because thats Kevin Durant lmao This is andrew bogut,1
Warriors werent a super team in 2016 they were just a good team The super team came in 2017 when Kevin Durant joined,-1
Well if you did not hit up Kevin Durant you could have had the same feeling   grumbles in internal saltiness  I really wonder if OKC would have been a threat to them if they made the playoffs that year and everyone was healthy,1

yeah imagine losing to the Big 3 spurs playing some of the best team ball ever then the MVP when your team is out injured then losing to the most winningest team everKevin Durant That should be a cake walk,0
I dont need his GSW titles to justify the fact that fewer than 14 people have ever been born who were better than Kevin Durant at playing basketball in the NBA,1
For those of you unaware of the background during the 2014 Western Conference Semi Finals there was a big narrative that CP3 locked down Kevin Durant To date some Chris Paul fans say that CP3 locked down KD during this series But footage easily refutes this narrative,1

gtit will turn out to be an epic disaster seeing as how they have no picks going forward Its not looking good right now  remember what they gave up for PG13 This has the makings of Brooklyn 20  The Nets missed the playoffs for 3 years and now they have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving,-1
Not Kevin Kevin Durant,0
MPJs size and ability makes him a Kevin Durant like threat if he can put it all together Hes got a good shot but hes not very good with decision making or moving off the ball,1

Kevin Durant doesnt exist,0

Quick question when have the Warriors with Kevin Durant ever been dominated for a game at the beginning of a series and then came back and won in 5 games Can you think of a series  Dont worry I will wait for your answer,1
Kevin Durant,0
Maybe they can draft players like James Harden Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant Can you imagine a team with all three of these players  Draft ELC trade for picks draft ,1
Cant win legit Like a 73 win team signing Kevin Durant,-1
No one said this  Brandon Ingram was called the next Kevin Durant,-1
Thats not true   Kevin Durant has talked about how much he liked Seattle Plus there are a ton of players from the region Zach LaVine Isaiah Thomas Dejountay Murray Jamal Crawford Avery Bradley Joe Harris,0
But hes not LeBron James or Kevin Durant either Hes not Steph Curry He cant be top 3 for me let alone the best player,1

Dudes thought Kyle Kuzma was the next Kevin Durant LOL,1
And Kevin Durant won the MVP in 20132014  I would rather have him than any of the above,1
What Kevin Durant is a liability on defense since when   And no Kevin Durant is better than Kawhi he wouldve torched the Nuggets even in a game 7,0
They never hold anyone to the same standard as LeBron and its not even close Kevin Durant who has been right behind LeBron for years was said to be better than LeBron during his run with the warriors but was still never held to the same standard,1
Kevin Durant doesnt elevate his teammates much either tbh,0
The year you tanked for Kevin Durant,0
gtwe beat the odds  Aka Kevin Durant joined the team not even a month later,0
Fair Kevin Durant said on JJ Redicks podcast last week he directly didnt like the concept of bright lights the mecca Madison Square Garden as basketball on broadway and Brooklyn appealed to him for being lowkey and matching his personality Kawhi must be somewhat similar here,1
Damn KD missed all 7 Or did you Good thing they still had Kevin Durant,-1

Kevin Durant and the Clippers squad from last year would have probably beaten this nuggets squad in 5 Kawhi is not a top 3 player in the league,-1
Kevin Durant was a 6 in less than a quarter of playing time He was rushed back from injury shot 33 from 3 and the warriors were easily the better team  This would not be a competitive series if he played more than a quarter of game time,1

These guys  Kevin Durant might take us to the Western Conference Finals,0

I figured that the Warriors gained even more hatred with Kevin Durant joining the team After all they ruined the NBA,-1
Because LeBron James is clearly better than Anthony Davis and because the rest of this Lakers team is a joke compared to Golden States roster outside of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant,1
Curry was even worse than Kawhi against the rockets for 5 and a half games last year the difference is curry had kevin Durant to save his ass and Kawhi had Paul George,-1

Imagine if we got someone like Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant is lethal at the end of games and can score just about anywhere on the floor and his defense was also above average this was before his achilles injury,-1
Its like when the refs used a technicality to review the charge on Kevin Durant in the finals Sure they circumvented how the rule was intended but the correct call was made,1
Nope They lost DLo and replaced him with injured Kyrie  The thing I am concerned about them is a culture shift They used to be the rag tag of underdogs but now they got Kyrie and Kevin Durant   Similarly the Clippers have the same problem,-1
Yes because Kevin Durant is incredibly talented and deserves the benefit of doubt that he will come back reasonably good post injury,1
Even 60 of Kevin Durant elevates this team from questionable 8 seed to solid top 5 seed,0
Kevin Durant has He is the luckiest player ever,1
Curry traveled in game 2 of the nba finals right before Iggy hit the three so we have a chance to win that game and if we do we would have swept the warriors and Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant dont get injured,1

Yeah the knicks were pretty serious about building around Kevin Durant too It really doesnt mean it was a logical strategy to put all of their eggs into one basket on    Honestly adding Drummond was about their best case scenario and still an absolute joke,1
As much as I dislike Kyrie I realize that this is not a big deal The whole organization is looking to next year with the addition of Kevin Durant,-1
Its not just that The nets arent a kevin durant away from a championship  The last laugh requires a ring and that team isnt winning a ring next year,1
Fuck yeah Steve Kerr is gonna turn him into the next Kevin Durant,-1

Why should the warriors care if the league is more interesting If you have a chance to add Kevin Durant to one of the best teams ever then you move heaven and earth to make it happen I guarantee you Steph would take that 10 times out of 10,1
Kevin Durant Obviously he gave us two rings but he put Curry my favorite player in the backseat The Warriors adding any other max player would still likely net them a ring over 3 years but the league would have been far more interesting during that time,1
true there definitely isnt a Kevin Durant kinda hate I mean its honestly almost impossible to hate him hes humble as fuck fun to watch and really good lol,1

Mark Jackson Kyrie Kevin Durant THREE UNSTABLE PERSONALITIES TOGETHER It is going to be a miracle if they win a championship,1

there is a debate kevin durant couldnt get it done in the playoffs against the best even though he was close so instead of running it back he went to the proven winner to make it easier,1

lol can you not read What does the first sentence of my post say Black athletes have endorsed it Not hard to check the post Desean Jackson made Kevin Durant JR Smith and Steven Jackson to name a few,1
Are you madly in love with Kevin Durant Literally every single post I see you make on here is about him lmao Not that you dont bring up good points regarding him but sometimes I wonder if youre a KD burner lol,1
Kevin Durant and JR Smith did not praise hitler In fact neither did DeSean Jackson or Stephen Jackson So you can probably start with that reason,-1
What about kevin durant and JR smith,0
Kevin Durant JR Smith Jameis Winston and Marquises Goodwin have all supported Stephen and or Desean Jackson,1
Can you share the quote where Kevin Durant praises Hitler   This is some look everyone is racist so BLM is a sham bullshit,-1
gt Somehow DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler  Could OP or someone link me to each of these 4 people PRAISING Hitler,1
This title should be edited Kevin Durant didnt like the Hitler post He liked a picture of Farrakhan likely not knowing who he was Then unliked it an hour later someone likely told him  Both the Jacksons deserve flack though,0
Good point I didnt know that However I know for a fact he was a Raptors fanhttpswwwsportsnetcabasketballnbakevindurantwantedtoplayforthetorontoraptors,1
Kevin Durant and Jr smith didnt praise hitler,-1
OP can you point to where Kevin Durant praised Hitler  Are you referencing Durant liking one of Jacksons posts that had nothing to do with Hitler,1
NBA players silent too and supporting this Really shows the fucking hypocrisy  When it was about HK protestors it was LeBron telling Morey he was ignorant  When its Desean Jackson posting Hitler quotes Kevin Durant eats it up  The whole minorities cant be racist narrative has gotta go,1
No sorry Kevin Durant is a neoNazi now thats the rules,-1
As Kevin Durant on his main Reddit account I approve this message and openly endorse it,1
I dont believe that is the case here considering that DeSean Jackson is from LA and Kevin Durant is from DC,0

im not even gonna get into the matter itself but saying kevin durant praising hitler is so bad faith kd liked a picture of louis farrakhan and hes a hitler apologist now im a kd hater and this is blown so far out of proportion its genuinely making me mad lol,1
gtSomehow DeSean Jackson Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler is getting less coverage than Drew Brees comments  And they said the Jews controlled mass media,1
I think saying what Kevin Durant and JR Smith did is praising Hitler is pretty darn disingenuous,1

Yeah sometimes teams are victims of circumstance and timing The Warriors were able to sign Steph Curry to a belowmarket contract due to his balky ankles at the time Then Kevin Durant was able to join them due to the great salary cap spike of 2016 And they still were almost there,1
Yeah that was a weird quote for me as well Kevin Durant was a dude that couldve easily one gone 1 overall how could getting him at 2 be the best pick of the decade,1
gt the thirdbest pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin  Gasol is very good and all but no way is hes the third best pick of the decade over the likes of Curry Harden Kawhi etc,1
Shoot for the moon and even if you miss youll land among the stars  The Lakers for example missed on Kevin Durant in 2016 but because they had diligently laid the groundwork for a max free agent they were able to quickly pivot and use the capspace on Deng and Mozgov instead,1

We thought Kevin Durant was different too  Giannis may be the exception to the rule but the history of the NBA suggests that elite superstars who dont win titles with small market teams by the time they hit their prime usually leave,-1
Yes we saw James Harden Eric Gordon Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker go up against Steph Curry Klay Thompson Kevin Durant and Draymond Green,1
httpswwwgooglecomampsnothinbutnetscom20200323kevindurantdefensebrooklynnetsamp Here you go Not sure how accurate it is considering it is a fansided article so I may be misinformed But yeah we both agree Harden has been a really decent defender this year,1
When  It was a point in time where people were debating whether Kevin Durant was about to pass LeBron as the best player in the league Today everyone still basically knows LeBron is the best even if hes not getting the MVPs harden is still below,1
Kevin Durant has been considered arguably the best player in the NBA at times in his career plus he has 2 rings and 2 FMVPs  James Harden does not have that,1
gtKevin Durant averaged 23 assists   Thats 3 times what MPJ averages I agree woth most of what you said tho,1
Kevin Durant averaged 23 assists and 37 turnovers during his first playoff run    Im not saying MPJ is on the same level as young KD but its not uncommon for young scorers to have low assisttoturnover numbers in their first playoffs    Cut the kid some slack hes pretty much a rookie,0
Are you saying Kevin Durant didnt up and leave the west,0
All it took was Kevin Durant rupturing his achilles Klay Thompson tearing his ACL and Stephen Curry breaking his hand,1
Wonder why you left out the Warriors best player those years Kevin Durant,1
I mean well yeah   Heres the all time top 5 career playoff PPG  1 Michael Jordan 2 Allen Iverson  3 Anthony Davis 4 Jerry West 5 Kevin Durant  Only 2 people in the history of the NBA have scored more per game then Anthony Davis on average in the playoffs lol,1
MPJ thinks hes Kevin Durant out there lol,1
Jerami Grant is Kevin Durant again  Nobody else can score though,1

i dont hate lebron hes honestly my current third favorite shooting guard after dorian finney smith and kevin durant  Edit I meant small forward,1

Is it weird if I dont see a Kevin Durant in any of them,0
Yes because they added Kevin Durant to a 73 win team that was 3  points away from being back to back champions,1
Tristan Thompson was asked about this today by either Cowherd or Gottlieb just laughed and said Kyrie is probably just trying to butter up Durant and bring them closer because theres no way Kyrie legitimate believes that not just LeBron but also Kevin Love and JR Smith cant make key shots,1
Im imagining Kevin Durant having sex and its pretty hot,1
Hes Kevin Durant Im sure he will be a little rusty but once he hits his stride he will be the leading scorer on the Nets and a top 3 player again,1
gt which Kawhi interpreted as a menu he could pick from lol  Ill take a Kevin Durant with a side of Stephen Curry and could you add a little less salt to the Curry please Thank you,1
yes and the evolution of steph curry draymond green and klay thompson is what changed that not steve kerr  adding kevin durant is just icing on the top,1
