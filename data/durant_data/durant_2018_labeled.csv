Hows kevin Durant by far a better scorer than a man who can score 40 with his left hand when hes bored  Plus Bird was more efficient than Durant even though he played the end of his career with a completely deteriorated back lol,1
They would be fun to watch IF in the right roles Gordon thinking hes Kevin Durant taking pullup jumpers isnt that fun to watch ,1
First thought was Kevin Durant but then I remembered Tim Duncan Great player very little excitement   I really dislike James Harden I used to dislike him even more but since my local team stopped gifting him 20 free throws a game Ive seen a better version of him   ampx200B,1
Cant see it clearly but I think Kevin Durant held him down a little with the left hand on the shoulder If thats the case his jump would have been hampered forcing him to shove the shot too hard  If Durant didnt hold him theres no excuse ,0
It is though Not every shot is worth the same amount of points so just going by FG will lead you to believe that for example Ben Simmons is more efficient than Kevin Durant but thats just not true KD takes and makes a lot more 3s and FTs which should be accounted for,0

Kevin Durant joined the best team in the league and made them unbeatable  LeBron James joined a team who would never win a championship without him 2011 Wade  Bosh Heat without LeBron would never win a ring and made them the best  There is a clear difference,1
Just look at the difference in players my guy And the Warriors got Kevin Durant youre gonna act like that doesnt make things hugely different Then theres the fact that JR Smith got way worse since then and IT is a downgrade from Kyrie,0
Yes because Aldridge rose and Iggy are comparable to Kevin Durant good point I just dont get how its different ,1
It is  Unless it happens to Kevin Durant then its just a great play,1
Kevin Durant makes bad looks look good,0
Basically by adding kevin durant the warriors took a team that was already nuts as far as systematic ball movement and added a 7 foot garbage man for any of the bad possessions that might happen ,-1

Thats hilarious You think Kevin Durant was neglected on D while Steph was triple teamed I have no idea what Finals you watched but it wasnt the one I saw Wide open dunks You mean like KD used his elite athleticism to get himself open and dunk the ball,1
If the Warriors offense fails just give it to Kevin Durant and he can do anything offensively,-1
Kevin Durant doesnt follow through he stays to admire the make,1
I remember Kevin Durant getting multiple wide open dunks while Steph was doubled at the three point line Is that the finals youre talking about,0

Its very hard to improve your team when you pick so late in the draft He cant make Lowry and Derozen better he can only improve the players around them which he did Its not as easy as picking up Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant in free agency ,1

I agree that you should reward teams for great drafting  Superteams that are completely homegrown shouldnt be discouraged  The problem is when you allow a Kevin Durant to sign with a team that was in the finals the year before  It just tips the balance of power too much imho,1
Seriously something is wrong with the rims during these games  Kevin Durant missed his first two free throws last game in the first half Second half Houston is missing everything thrown that way Something seems off with these rims ,-1

Thank you Kevin Durant for ruining the NBA,0

Kevin Durant has lost every game this year when he scored more than 40  Its almost like singular stats dont necessarily win games or something,-1

GM You have the ball under the basket with 5 seconds left in a tie game You are likely to be eaten by a Kevin Durant What is your action  JR Do I have anything in my inventory  GM No just the ball  JR I search the court for loot,-1
LeBron James scored 49 points for his team and was running back to get on defense in case Kevin Durant got the rebound which he almost did  Contrary to popular belief LeBron does need some help from his teammates out there and JR Smith and ty lue did not live up to the challenge,1
do you not remember how dray was so shook that his team couldnt beat lebron he called Kevin Durant in the parking lot right after game 7,-1
Remind me to never turn my back on Kevin Durant,0
I mean if GSW could get Kevin Durant in free agency,1
I will forever dread the day that Lebron retires and were left with Kevin Durant being the best player in the NBA   It just wont feel right,1
Kevin Durant definitely made the right decision hes such a great player also this was the hardest route and he couldnt win with OKC I still respect him as a player hes so good,1
westbrook is not on that same level as kevin durant and harden and kawhi,0
gt LeBron had 51 points and a near triple double and still lost  Its a testament to how out of reach the Warriors became after Kevin Durant joined the team  I dont think it bodes well for the popularity of the league in the foreseeable future ,1

Lebron and Kevin Durant are both professional basketball players,0
I mean Kevin Durant wasnt Kevin Durant tonight either Dude was not there the 2nd half at all,0
You mean like the Warriors when they had to sign Kevin Durant in order to overcome Lebron when they already had a team capable of 73 wins,1
Look at the official tweets from the NBAhttpswwwsbnationcom201853117416184lebronjameschargekevindurantoverturnedblockfoulcavswarriorsgame1nbafinals they say it was reviewed because  they werent sure if LeBron was in the restricted area,-1

Kevin Love gives curry the and one   Foul call changes from charge to blocking  Clean wipe from Hill on Durant gets called a foul ,1
OP forgot to mention that he didnt box out on that Hill FT and got out rebounded by JR fucking smith  People killing JR but how the fuck does a 7ft forward not box out a 65 guard on a free throw when its tied  JR smith saved Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant from Draymond in the parking lot,0
Kevin Durant was trash on both ends Dude looked lazy defensively and thats inexcusable considering who you are guarding ,-1
2016 was unlikely this is absurd  It sort of reminds me of that Jim Gaffigan joke having 3 kids feels like youre drowning and then somebody hands you a baby  Its like that if that baby was Kevin Durant joining the Warriors ,1
Should be the one of LeBron maybe in the restricted area  A 73 win team needs Kevin Durant and can only win at home with a rigged game The worst part is morons in the future will count it against LeBrons legacy and for Durant,-1
That Cavs team had Kyrie Irving That Warriors team didnt have Kevin Durant ,0
I really dont think there are adjustments to be made They came out and had a near perfect game plan and GS shot terribly and Lebron had an insane game and they still lost Fuck Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant got so lucky Got out muscled and pushed under the hoop by JR on that rebound And somehow comes away with the game Durant choked in the 4th quarter too,0

Hows kevin Durant by far a better scorer than a man who can score 40 with his left hand when hes bored  Plus Bird was more efficient than Durant even though he played the end of his career with a completely deteriorated back lol,1
They would be fun to watch IF in the right roles Gordon thinking hes Kevin Durant taking pullup jumpers isnt that fun to watch ,1
First thought was Kevin Durant but then I remembered Tim Duncan Great player very little excitement   I really dislike James Harden I used to dislike him even more but since my local team stopped gifting him 20 free throws a game Ive seen a better version of him   ampx200B,1
Cant see it clearly but I think Kevin Durant held him down a little with the left hand on the shoulder If thats the case his jump would have been hampered forcing him to shove the shot too hard  If Durant didnt hold him theres no excuse ,0
It is though Not every shot is worth the same amount of points so just going by FG will lead you to believe that for example Ben Simmons is more efficient than Kevin Durant but thats just not true KD takes and makes a lot more 3s and FTs which should be accounted for,0
