Well its a very specific kind of injury where the opposing team ends up having Kevin Durant Klay Thompson and Draymond Green,-1
Not saying youre wrong but do you have a statistic to back this up I will concede that Klays usage goes down with KD but thats because its Kevin Freaking Durant He should get shots lol,0
Lakers had arguably the worst spacing in the league last year Bron still averaged 275 in just 35 minutes a game That is not struggling Kevin Durant posts about the same numbers in his prime now as LeBron did last year at age 34,-1

Definitely Kevin Durant,1
Serious question for OP Is Kevin Durant a better player than Prime Shaquille ONeal ever was  Please explain,1
Because Curry was the leading scorer of the finals not Kawhi  Klay is not better than Kawhi Klay outplayed Kawhi in the finals  Kevin Durant in the 11 minutes he played also OUTPLAYED Kawhi,0
I dont think Kawhi is close or will ever be close Kevin Durant is MILES better in every aspect of the game Including winning championships,1
This would make slightly more sense if OKC hadnt offered Westbrook a supermax and if he hadnt signed it Just like the offered one to Durant Unless you mean Kevin Love who signed one in Cleveland   Nothing like a Lakers fan being a dick to small markets,1

I said they are MVP players to describe them and they are Just because they didnt win MVP that year doesnt mean they arent MVP type players Is Kevin Durant on the 2017 Warriors not an MVP player because he didnt win MVP that year Imo he is,-1
Maybe he really wanted to be part of a motion offense The problem is hes Kevin Durant and sometimes the best play is just to give him the ball especially  against a team playing crazy defense in the playoffs,1

Curry really came out of no where in the middle of this decade before that Kevin Durant was the far and away 2 to LeBron,-1
I think everyone is taking this the wrong way Kevin Durant has said before that the motion offense can become very exhausting and sometimes he would have preferred that the Warriors would have ran set plays like the Clippers or Spurs do,-1

I think it was Richard Jefferson who said that all The Warriors needed to beat them was a consistent wing who could knock down all the open threes they were getting They really didnt have to go out and get Kevin Durant just a slight upgrade over Harrison Barnes,0
Kevin Durant and Westbrook did it in 2012,0
The reason they got Durant is that they could and Durant wanted to go there to everyones surprise I dont think you need a deep basketball reason to make a move on Kevin Durant in free agency,1

Can you imagine if this team also had Demarcus cousins or Kevin Durant,0
Could you imagine if this warriors team added someone like Kevin Durant,1
OOOH who lives as a serpent under the bridge Kevin Durant,0
The answer is Kevin Durant Dude hasnt averaged 27ppg his career average since hes joined the warriors,0
gtHad they been healthier this couldve been a lot closer  You sure you wanna talk about healthier when the dubs were missing Kevin frikking Durant Oh and Demarcus Cousins for good measure oh and Andre Iguodala in the last game too lol,1
the Warriors need Kevin Durant so much s,0
Can we acknowledge one more time how ridiculous it was that Kevin Durant was added to this team,-1
Kevin Durant is like the fourth piece of paper towel when you only needed three to clean up the spill,1
Kevin the hardest road Durant sits out the WCF  GS still sweep LMAO,1
Nobody is cheering harder for the Blazers tonight than Kevin Durant,1
Honestly Nurkic fucked the team over by getting hurt They also need to add a Kevin Durant type,-1
Portland is getting Kevin Durant this summer,0
BILL WALTON KEVIN DURANT KAWHI LEONARD MYERS LEONARD quik maths,0
Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant,1
I imagine he was talking about Kevin Durant or someone else The context doesnt makes sense for it to be Kawhi,0
Kevin Durant would like a word in that argument,0
But KD is also Kraft dinner And to be honest idk if Kevin Durant is better than Kraft dinner,1
Calling them by their initials isnt that common partly because of the problem you pointed out Like most people think of AI as Allen Iverson KD just sounds cool and is quicker than Kevin Durant,1
Would be a pretty epic move of the Warriors to find some random Kevin Durant and bring him along   Or just people with KD initials   Reporters Are you bringing KD to Toronto  Warriors Ha Were bringing three KDs,1
Its funny  Kevin Durant going to GSW could end up fucking the salaries of future players  Truly a snake,1
Yes KD is Kevin Durant  KD plays for Warriors but he is hurt right now Warriors are playing very well without Kevin,1
I just recently got into basketball so Im not sure what this post is related too Whats going on with KD And is KD Kevin Durant,-1
gtHe also has the best TS in the finals ever  Kevin Durant   2012 65 TS  2017 654 TS  2018 698 TS  Currys peak is 619 in a Finals series only time he wasnt in the 5559 range,1
Good thing they clarified which Kevin Durant they were talking about   Des Moines based ventriloquist Kevin Durant,1
Cleveland built a team that went to 4 straight finals and feasibly couldve 3peated if not for injuries and Kevin Durant What a horrible path that would be for the Lakers to take,-1
Ill lose in the first round for 100 years before Id ever cheer for Kevin Durant again,-1
Yooo that kid is a baller I would love him long scorer defensive potential great value Kevin Durant right now 19 as well Shit he could be the steal of the draft,1
httpswwwmercurynewscom20190520kevindurantblastsfanwhowasinnocentlycelebratingthewarriorsgame3victory  he likes to banter,1
video captures Kevin Durant cheering for the Raptors,1
gtwould adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 201819 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors  It wouldnt be even close Rodgers to Rams would be far more impactful,0
Yes but is adding an allstar QB as important to an NFL team as adding an allstar starter on a NBA team  Eg would adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 201819 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors  Id argue the latter is way more valuable,1
I love Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Dwight Howard Durant,0
Kobe was an allstar and still dicked the spurs Remember Kobe was a young player and not a fully developed 30 year old like Kevin Durant Its hilarious hes still living in peoples heads even after retirement Kobe also won 2 ships with his own team something KD will never do,1
Uh Kevin Durant has,0
He said it during an interview after he joined the team  httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsearlyleadwp20160707kevindurantsaysjoiningwarriorssuperteamisthehardestroadnoredirectonamputmterm796e1595413e,0
And Kevin Durant is 69,0
They lost the ship that year thats why the recruited Durant Kevin is easily talked into things it seems,0
And and thats without Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins,0
Kevin Durant has no eyelids so he can never close his eyes or blink Instead of eyelids thin clear membrane cover his corneas called spectacles or brilles These are attached to his skin Although he cant close his eyes he can close the retinas when sleeping,0
Oh I get it Its because hes never been to the finals  I guess youre right I have no room to criticize a player from another team Especially because my home team hasnt made the finals in a long time  Guess Ill go ahead and order my Kevin Durant jersey now,-1
I could see Kevin Durant being on rnba up voting and downvoting and making comments,0
Kevin durant too because of his already comical proportions  I think Kawhi Giannis AD and maybe Harden are good picks as well,1
Plot twist OP is really Kevin Durant,0
And thats one of the reasons youre not Kevin Durant,0
how did you forget kevin durant lol,1

Kevin Durant would beat anyone in the history of the league 1v1,0
I knew this was going to happen  Kevin Durant is healthy He has no incentive to play Its a business decision  Durant is gone,1
Yea but wasnt Kevin Durant on a few the teams,0
Why not Theyre the Knicks and hes Kevin Durant I dont think the Warriors did a physical on Kd when he joined them,0

We beat them with Chris Paul while we didnt have Kevin Durant this year  Chris Paul would have helped them but the narrative that Chris Paul would have been the difference maker is dead,-1
One of my favorite tweets that gets underrated is the clippersKevin Durant interview   Clippers meeting with Durant was intense and at one point Steve Ballmer was crying but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned,0
No LeBron Canadian team and an overwhelming favourite I will have to say no  Honestly I havent watched the playoffs as much in previous years because I am a hockey fan and it had been a forgone conclusion the warriors win the finals ever year since Kevin Durant joined,1
AllPlayoff Team   C  Nikola Jokic  F  Kevin Durant  F  Kawhi Leonard  G  James Harden  G  Stephen Curry,0
Kevin Durant will be moving to Toronto next year if the Raptors win the finals  So count him out,1
Because no one is saying bev suffers from mental fragility which is so sweetly ironic that a bunch of teen suburban white boys on an Internet forum have the gall to call Kevin Durant who worked his ass off in the streets of PG county to come out of the mud and make a name for himself soft,-1
Home court advantage   No Kevin Durant   Steph Curry injured with 0 points in the first half   Still lost    Never change Houston Chockets never change,-1
Are the Warriors better without Kevin Durant My column,1
Why does everyone forget that the Warriors were the best team in the league before Kevin durant they were championship teams before durant,1
Golden state is this good and they are missing kevin fucking Durant,1
DONT LET KEVIN DURANT MISSING THIS GAME MAKE YOU FORGET THE WARRIORS WON GAME 67 LAST HEAR WITHOUT ANDRE IGUODALA,0
Kevin Durant injured               Curry scoreless first half             Rocketsstill lose,-1
Warriors dropped all their bench to get boogie and Kevin Durant Curry is playing injured and its looking like theyre going to make the rockets look like fools  Rockets cant win in the postseason,-1
Kevin durant is quite possibly the best player in the game right now but goddamn if the durantless warriors are so fun to watch,1
Lol the Warriors are still the best team in the league without Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins  Let that sink in for a second,1
Kevin Durant  The hardest road,0
Kevin Durant Whos that  Curry and Klay probably,0
Kevin Mr Superfluous Durant,0
Hello 911  Hi the Warriors dont need Kevin Durant  Ok Im sending a unit your way right now,1
Warriors are better without ballhog Kevin Durant,1
I love how the rockets are choking theyre playing a fucking back to back nba championship team This team got Kevin Durant AFTER winning 2 titles Maybe theyre just good,1
Lol Kevin Durant gets doubled all the time on GSW Even if you watched only Ximo Pierto highlights you would know that  I swear people do not watch basketball on this subreddit,1
Except Kevin Durant,0
Did Kevin Durant change the way offense is played Thats what revolutionary means Even if Kevin Durant is a better overall scorer he isnt a better shooter and clearly isnt as revolutionary of a scorer,1
Kevon Looney gt Kevin Durant  Steph Curry gt Seth Curry,1
I would just like to say that all of my previous takes on this series were based on Kevin Durant being healthy,1
Kevon looney out there playing like kevin durant,1
Is Iguodala actually Kevin Durant,0
Well didnt you read the article how explaining how Kevin Durant is awesome BECAUSE of Steph Curry,1
Kevin Durant may be outplaying Steph and hes in Oakland,0
Kevin Durant is injured   Steph Curry is scoreless   And the game is tied   Anyone wouldve told you youre on drugs if you prophesied this before this game,-1
The game is tied and the warriors are playing without Kevin Durant AND Steph Curry,1
Imagine if golden state played team ball but with Kevin Durant as well,1
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and Kevin Looney,0
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and steph curry,0
DampD Dany forgot that Kevin Durant got hurt,-1
Kevon Kevin Durant Looney,0
Was cooking a second ago did JVG implicitly compare Steph to frickin  BJ Armstrong in his Kevin DurantbeingoutislikeJordanbeingout spiel,0
Who needs Kevin Durant when you have Kevon Looney,0
Klay Thompson is actually just a better Kevin Durant,1
Why is this game so close Tied without Kevin Durant smh,1
Kevon Kevin Durant Looney,0
Imagine being so stacked that losing KEVIN FUCKIN DURANT might not matter hahaha  KLAY IS HEATING UP,-1
Great interview with PJ Tucker there and Van Gundy completely misses the fucking point as always  We clearly arent BETTER without Kevin Durant but in the short term it can really refocus everyone,1
They were waving bye bye to Kevin Durant,0
Hes 65 and was already guarding Kevin Durant,0
Golden State only won because of Kevin Durant One I dont think they make it without him two he was the difference maker Clevelands offense was pound for pound just as good if not better than theirs they just had KD on top of it,1
Reminder that last time the Warriors played the Rockets without Kevin Durant they eliminated the Rockets from the playoffs with Stephen Curry only playing a total of 38 minutes in the series,1
As much as I dont want to agree Kevin Durant fits the mold pretty well,1
Who the fuck is Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant is good but he aint no Jordan Binnington,1

Despite going down 30 and ultimately losing 41 that 2017 Cavs team was really good but got stonewalled by a 73win team plus Kevin Durant and a massive chip on their shoulder,0
Derek Fisher has won as many NBA championships as LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined,1
Yeah technically they lost to the best team of all time 2016 739 warriors and Kevin Durant combined So not fair to say they were bad at all,0
i literally decided like 10 mins ago that the only thing funnier than missing 27 straight 3s is losing to a warriors team with no kevin durant man i cant wait to troll the rox,0
Jimmy is younger than Kevin Durant and only 5 months older than Klay He already deserved a 4 year max At worst Jimmys game will develop into a better Iggy He takes care of his body and is always in top shape,1
You do realize Kevin Durant isnt playing for the remainder of the series so this makes absolutely no sense right,-1
Warriors are 261 in the last 27 games they have played without Kevin Durant but with Steph Curry in the lineup,0
Actually Kevin Durant is responsible for that,1
Steph has been this efficient with or without Kevin Durant Dame has never shot a season at 40 from 3 Either way hes going to be a pretty unanimous 1st team all NBA which suggests he was comfortably better even with missing more games,1
Same production as Dame on slightly better efficiency but Dame doesnt get to play next to Kevin Durant Dame was also better defensively and a better playmaker,1
Kevin Durant like frame haha,1
Lmaooooo if Kevin fucking durant comes at you asking for the max you get on your needs and prepare to whip out that big fat check book deposit it into his big fat checking account,0
I agree but there are 2 free agents who could make them a conference finalist favorite Kawaii Leonard or Kevin Durant Plus they need shooting to surround whoever they have next year,1
Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are skilled players They get into better rhythm when Kevin Durant off the floor That first 20142015 season was special team,1
K so Kevin Durant is doing very well as we all know but he has only done it through two series while Lebrun would have done it throughout the entire playoffs,0
Kevin Durant,0
Rodney Hood or Kevin Durant  Same person I think,0
Personally I think Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the league right now but James Harden did phenomenal during the regular season as well Anyways did you see the cumshot on that slut Theyre gonna need to throw her in a carwash to wipe her clean,1
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard Thats all,0
Why Kevin Durant may leave altogether this offseason and the league is wide open again,0
Its not even about take what you can get  Who in their right mind would max Jimmy Butler over Kevin Durant,0
Harden is top 3 How Hes better than Giannis LeBron Kevin Durant Anthony Davis kawhi    Are you delusional lmao,1
Last year Rockets won game 5 to take the series 32 and lost CP3   Warriors win game 5 to take series 32 and lose Kevin Durant    Game 5 next year how about all the superstars sit out,1
This random pagehttpscanbacomnewsnbaplayoffs2019whohasbeenbetterthispostseasonkawhileonardorkevinduranttorontoraptorsgoldenstatewarriorslru4tvqqmkct1x2wlhy1wlstj on the internet agrees with you,1
Why is Kevin Durant laying around on center court,0
If the Nuggets win I think Durant should sit out the next series just to be safe Nothing is more important than your health Kevin,1
Every team with cap space will offer Jimmy the max outside of the teams that have already used their cap space up to sign Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant,0
Kemba gave a look of pleasant surprise Kyrie belted We got an expletive clan now And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door exNBA star Kevin Garnett said Da fuq is this,1
Interestingly it looks like so far Kevin Durant Kawhi and Giannis are head to head for a surefire 1 place pretty interesting,1
Ah yes elite defenders Steph Curry and Kevin Durant Ok,1
Kevin Durant has won as many playoff series without an allstar teammate as Westbrook,1
are yall serious   kevin durant,0
I have a hard time believing anyone can beat Kevin Durant,0
lol and if John Stockton had Kevin Durant on his team Stockton wouldnt be considered the best player either As a matter of fact John Stockton usually was not the best player on his team for most of his career,1
Kevin Durant as a talent is easily top 15 of all time so its hard to knock on Steph for not being the best on his team But he has the accomplishments to be considered top 1020 along with kd,1
That Kyrie is coming and now they have room for one Kevin Durant,0
They both pass to Kevin Durant,0
Excuse me can I play Kevin of Durant in the Monstarfish  No Brandon Youreyoure in the wave  Lmao,1
Nah Durant Kevin Durant has stayed remarkably healthy and is unstoppable on offence   The dude is a 7 footer with the skills of a guard,0
gt If you want some scrub go to an eliminated house if you want a king earn him   Kevin Cersei Lannister Durant,1
Lol and why do people always try to switch the argument up Of fucking course they are better with Kevin Durant But they are still really good without him Rockets in 5 is an incredibly dumb take dont try to move the goal post now,0
Kevin Durant wont go play for the Knicks unless someone else is coming No way hes just gonna go play on his own,-1
Kevin Durant junior,0
Klay Thompson hits a 3 early in the game looks toward the Raptors bench and rips off his mask to reveal the face of Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant is coming back for the Finals is the new Kawhi doesnt have any issue with Spurs management hell be back next year,-1
Not Kevin Durant because of the calf and all hard to leap,0
I know the media is so crazy They call their team overpowered with Kevin Durant and without him they cant beat an OK raptors team,-1
Its just reporting news No one said in a surprising turn of events Kevin Durant will not play,-1
I think its a conspiracy to keep Kevin Durant out of Game 4 so that the Warriors lose the series,-1
Watching McKinnie and Jerebko airballs open 3s and realizing that that would normally be Kevin Durant lmao,1
Kevin Durant already isnt coming back for the finals so,0
What happens if an inactive player in street clothes shoves an opponent after a play What if you replace this guy with Kevin Durant,1

Usher probably like Sir Kevin Durant had invited you to join him for the rest of the game Follow me,1
3rd quarter dubs minus Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Kevon Looney yes,1
Oh of course Lebron chose to have srub teammates he passed on adding James Harden and Kevin Durant to his team lmao Get out of here there are only role players for teams to choose from to pick up   He never ever threatened to leave he even signed a 2 year deal after the 2015 finals,1
Kevin Durant,0
People rarely are Kevin Durant,0
Yeah that was obvious when the guy has Kevin Durant as his flair the bandwagon player himself  Although KD is actually hot fire and the Warriors are definitely missing him,0
Totally agree it is evenly matched without KD warriors are OP and become extreme favorites with him playing I will be finishing my book on how Kevin Durant ruined basketball stay tuned,1
Hes out playing the guy who is injured Nice We might as well say that Steph is the best player in the league After all he is outplaying Kevin Durant and LeBron right now,1
Kevin Durant wants to know your location,0
Is Kevin Durant even at these games I never see him on the bench when they pan to it,0
Disadvantaged 2 future HoFers and Half of Boogie Cousins LeBron had Timofey Mozgov and got mocked for losing Theyll be fine They only have Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant coming back soon,-1
Thats fair but Kevin Durant and klay Thompson are out Thats not even close to the same,0
You realize Kevin fucking Durant and Klay Thompson are hurt right and didnt play,-1
Steph Currys Legacy 2015 Beat a Cavs team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love FMVP is Iggy  2016 Blew a 31 lead and was LeBrons bitch 2017 Durant saved his ass 2018 Durant saved his ass Again,-1
And if Kevin Durant was healthy What would the series look like then Nostradamus,1
On level 2 of the game the other team gets a Kevin Durant alongside their already top 3 player  On level 3 a random starter on your team is replaced with JR Smith,1
Remember a few years ago when Steph came back from injury against Portland He took about a quarter to get adjusted then roasted em in Portland   This is Kevin fuckin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant just ran for the first time in 3 weeks on Monday This is the NBA not rec league Hes not going to literally hop up off the couch and drop 40 in the finals,-1
If hes unsure then he probably wont play as the Kevin Durant we know But still anything is better than nothing but then again the Raps are really good,1
Curry has always played with the second best shooter of all time not named Stephen LeBron would have killed for JR Smith to have instead been any of Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Draymond Green DeMarcus Cousins Andre Iguodala Shaun Livingston,1
If you replace Kevin Durant with Kyrie you get a whole new meaning,0
Kyrie and Kevin Love ltltltltltltltltltlt Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,1
Man lucky for the Raptors that Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson didnt play in Game 3 They pretty much have it in the bag now,1
The Knicks are also winless in the Finals without Kevin Durant in the past 20 years,0
I forgot that Klay Thompson Andre Igoudala and oh yeah Kevin Durant died,-1
 i hope Kevin Durant is not going to play again this year,1
Why you talking like the series is over lol they are still missing one Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant backstage crying in his mommas arms,-1

Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Kevin Durant,0
I guess well be seeing Kevin Durant in game 4,1
Its true and you know it Add Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant in to this game and it would have been over from tipoff,1
httpswwwcbssportscomnbanewsnbafinals2019warriorshopekevindurantdoesenoughinpracticetomakegame4returnagainstraptors Mmmm this story from today says that kerr hopes KD can get some light work in practice tommorow Hmm,1
Having Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on your team keeps you from having to score 40 a game you idiot,-1
Kevin Durant out game 4 with a broken heart,-1
Kevin Durant Warriors need you lmfao,1
this series would be a lot more interesting if we had Kevin Kevon Durant,1
So has Kevin Durant been shitting his pants for 9 days straight Wtf is his excuse B,-1
Without Kevin Durant ruining the league basketball is actually fun to watch,1
Probably Kevin Durant,0
Curry is gonna have to be consistent dudes already puffing air after one quarterI wish he did but I doubt he has that gas tank only a handful players can do this all game Lebron James Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant,-1
raptors because of kevin durant,0
You might be missing guys but theres no excuse for bad defense  Ok Mark Jackson because missing Kevin Durant Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney would never ever affect your defensive capabilities This guy is so hard to listen to lmao,-1
if golden state is serious about winning this game you trap kawhi and force torontos role players to make three pointers tonight  you dont have the talent to switch anything right now without 40 minutes of klay and kevin durant,0
WHERES KEVIN DURANT,0
Kevin Durant so what would you say you do here,0
Can Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins name a single player of the White Sox roster,0
You dont think the added defense from Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins wouldve effected how well Lillard does against the Warriors   He could barely drive to the hoop as is that series without two additional 7 footers switching onto him every PnR and clogging the lane,1
Yes but you cant seriously compare Steph curry and Kevin Durant to Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili,1
LeBron with this Raptors team versus Warriors without Kevin Durant  Easy LeChampionship,-1
No But also neither kyrie Irving nor Kevin love are as good as either Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson,-1
Seeing all these people compare Kyrie and Love to Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant is hysterical man,1
There are still chances  Kevin Durant come here bby,1
Maybe maybe not The Spurs were washed up zombies at that point Kawhi Leonard isnt Kevin Durant especially back then Kawhi is top 5 Kevin is top 2 Then you take out Klay and my point is absolutely made,1
why would you need a flair to make fun of kevin durant,1
I do even though Kevin Durant is a better isolation scorer Steph Curry has the advantage in playmaking playing off ball and the gravity he exerts on the defense Plus he can score from all areas on the court just like Kevin Durant,1
If anyone can convince Kevin Durant to come home itd be him Wizards need to get him at all costs,1
Drunk people cheering when their team gets lead gt people celebrating the fact the Kevin Durant suffered a monster injury Cry me a fucking river,-1

Whyd u use Durant instead of Kevin huh,0
Kevin Durant died for this,-1
Kevin Durant  Him not playing is the only reason they won lmao,1
Lets see if this sub tries to pretend that losing Kyrie and Love is equivalent to losing Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,0
Appreciate the take but you just compared Conley to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and you should therefore be fucking ashamed,-1
Golden State would have absolutely massacred Toronto if healthy  Broken Kevin Durant in game 5 looked like he could have scored 50  Imagine over an entire series  KD is probably the one player in the league right now who is immune to Kawhi Leonard,1
Lmao They lost KEVIN DURANT and KLAT THOMPSON for significant time If healthy they win easily buddy,1
How about the past two Warriors titles get asterisks because they added Kevin Durant to a team that won 73 fucking games in one season,1
kevin durant the best player in the league and klay thompson who scored 30 in two quarters both seriously injured and you have the audacity to say POTENTIALLY marred lmfao,1
Warriors fans in 2015  you play the guys in front of you Warriors fans before the 2019 finals  this team is better without Kevin Durant Warriors fans after the 2019 finals  ASTERISK,1

Kevin Durant drops 51 on us 2OT when he was on the thunder  Hit the pull up 35 foot game winner nothing but net,1
This has been my take since 2015 Kevin Durant is why the Warriors are a dynasty,0
Because one Kevin Durant joined the team,0
Kevin Durant isnt playing again this year,0
Honestly Steph Curry is great and he seems like a great guy and I like Klay But I can see why people hate them when they employ Draymond Green who is dirty annoying and good to boot and Kevin Durant who is ultra sensitive on social media and ruined parity in the league,-1
Just another day in the life of Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant,0
First title run every team they faced had players injured Blew a 31 lead in 2016 so got mocked for it Then they added Kevin Durant and got loud when they were just too much for everyone else Theyre front runners plain and simple,-1
chris paul and lebron james colluded to manipulate the cap to force kevin durant to join the warriors so now there is a team so stacked that they could lose to them in the playoffs and not have it hurt their legacy all while durant has to deal with wildly unfair scrutiny,-1
Yes as a huge Warriors hater I will say that Steph Curry is even top 5 all time and thats tougher for me to say than anybody on here Steph Curry is the better player and leader than Kevin Durant It just took Curry longer to peak than Durant,1
The Cavs also had to deal with a healthy Kevin Durant in the line up lol Theres no way the Cavs get dominated the past two years playing the warriors  KD Hell they probably would have smoked them in 2017,0

Top 3gt Top 30 its quite simple to understand Are you telling me you genuinely believe a single team wouldnt offer Kevin Durant the max even if he tore his achilles,1
meanwhile Kevin Durant probably not playing the series I like these odds,1
Even if we dont resign him we cant do anything because were way over the cap already Whether he stays or not well only have MLE   And I absolutely see us or almost everyone with the money needed offering him a max even if he tears his ACL its Kevin Durant,0
No Kevin Durant is a top 3 player in the league he could amputate his foot and still get the max,0

Kevin Durant  really wanted him to bring a championship to okc,1

1 Because they wouldnt have had to give more up since KD was also a FA  2 Cause its fucking Kevin Durant yeah theres a high risk to signing him but imagine if you actually got Kevin Durant back Kawhi and him would be unstoppable,-1

One superstar caliber player with him Lou Williams has performed at a fringe all star level with the Clippers Was not a worse player than Russell last season   Kawhi tried to recruit a player that is arguably better than him in Kevin Durant,1
Its debatable whether this Clippers team is a worse supporting cast than the Cavs LeBron joined   Kawhi called Kevin Durant and Paul George to team up LeBron did the same,0
No youre right Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson going down for 90 of the finals had nothing to do with the outcome,-1

The trade was  GSW sends Kevin Durant 1st round pick  Nets send DLo Shabazz Napier Treveon Graham  The Warriors later had to pay 4m to Minnesota to take Napier and Graham off their hands so it was even more ridiculous,-1

Kevin Durant has two Finals MVPs,0
If Kevin Durant never existed I could see a player like Bol Bol going late in the first  But Kevin Durant proved a player like Bol Bol can succeed in the league and we cant forget KD couldnt get 125 for reps at the combine,1
saw one deleted account back in may 29 2015 predict this  2015  Warriors win the title Steph Finals MVP  2016  Cavs win the title Kyrie Finals MVP  then for 2017 and 2018  Kevin Durant Finals MVP  That was almost accurate,1
Lol illegal defense AND the Bulls dont shoot threes give the team with Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry,0
470 or so would be a great deal for him Thats basically a 345 extension but smoothed out   Whatever he signs as long as dollars and years above what he declined are in the 1215 range hes made the right move Injuries are risk moneywise if youre not literally Kevin Durant or Lebron,0
But the way the Warriors play its not about individual defense its about knowing who and where to help off Just because he is Pippen or because he is Rodman doesnt mean they would know how to handle that kind of motion offense Especially with Steph Klay and Kevin Durant Its too much,1
Id have to agree I dont see any other major FA that Clippers could get that tips the scales Kevin Durant or Klay would be the answer but both are out for next yearwilling to stay with GS   Lakers are set up to wreck the west as long as ADaytoDavis stays healthy,0

gt With the Warriors present and future in doubt because of injuries to free agents Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson it would seem like the perfect opportunity for the Rockets to move forward but Paul has made it known hed like to play elsewhere  So he requested a trade,1
I think maybe Harrison Barnes sees the Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson Injuries and is thinking that he needs to lock up a good long term deal right now  Get that guaranteed money for the long run not just a lot of money right now,1
Kevin Durant averaged 35 PPG including a 45 and 50 point game to finish them off so pretending that the Warriors just took it easy on the Clippers makes 0 sense  The Warriors team the Clippers faced was clearly and objectively better than the Warriors team the Raptors faced,1
Kevin Durant says hello,0
Agree Its not about the money its more about forming a superteam and not being the 1st option  If he signed with the Lakers he wouldnt lose money on the long run    Kevin Durant did discounts with the Warriors but he hadnt win any rings before unlike Kawhi that already has two FMVPs,-1

Kevin Durant wasnt going to play with Lebron James and be the 2nd option AND take a paycut AND he hadnt won anything yet in his career Kawhi is far more accomplished right now than KD was when he left OKC,-1
Dude can shoot over majority of players without even jumping Curry is still an elite PG and Durant can play catch and shoot too with open shots Klay dropped 60 with barely any dribbles This is Kevin Durant not some average scorer,-1
Kevin Durant literally just took a paycut after winning back to back finals MVPs but ok,1

All the Kevin Durant haters were so eager to rag on him If the warrior system always worked they would have beat the Cavs and the Raptors Kevin was right and nothing he said was particularly out of line Stephen respectfully disagreed but rnba thirst for drama must be fulfilled,1
There is no combination of words in any language that you can say to me that will make me think Kevin Durant was not being a bitch when he signed with the Warriors  You have to ignore SO MUCH of the context,0

Talent wise no it wasnt they have Kevin Durant and a significantly better Steph Curry on the same team along with Draymond Klay and Cousins If they played with playoff intensity theres 0 chance teams like the Mavs Lakers Suns or Magic ever beat them ,1
Does that necessarily mean he is better though Kevin Durant is certainly the more plug and play player and for a 4 year contract youd probably rather have him  However if its draft day and you have the choice between the two and have a guaranteed 15 years I think you pick Curry,1

Yes we should compare it to Leonards nonheaves  Why should someone be penalized for being a good team player    Players like LeBron and Kevin Durant are known for caring about their shooting percentages so much that they no longer throw up heaves,1
Those measurements are notoriously inaccurate For example its an open secret that Kevin Durant is a 7footer but hes always listed at 6 10 There was an article on this quite recently,0
ah shit hes going to manage to trade a resurgent john wall for kevin durant only for durant to come back better than before isnt he,0

I think if Kevin Durant had not been injured and he played in this series the viewership would be even higher No matter what the media and the people say that dude just rakes in the viewers whether hes in Golden State or wherever Ill be back next year,0
not at all im saying theyre bad relative to other people in the top 500 out of millions  no shit anybody in the nba is fucking amazing at basketball that doesnt mean jonas jerebko and kevin durant are equally skilled,-1

harden was playing very good defense on kevin durant literally in the fourth quarter the warriors were trying to get harden switched off of KD this is a tired narrative not to mention kawhi didnt exactly play extremely elite defense against the warriors this series either,1
It be like that when you spent a huge part of your cap on Kevin Durant,1
Kawhi played against Kevin Durant for 11 minutes,1

I mean he tried to recruit the best available free agent at the time it just turned out to be KD Who in their right mind would not try to recruit Kevin fucking Durant if they had a chance of getting him,1

But two inches seems a lot Players lie about their height all the time see Kevin Durant claiming to be shorter than he is Or maybe I just buy thin ass shoes because without shoes I am 61 flat and with shoes I am just shy of 62,-1
Then why was Al horford committed to the Thunder if Kevin Durant stayed in 2016,1
when he was drafted he was 7 flat and is listed as such A year later or so before he played he grew to 72 Hes announced as 72 now at home games as well and is taller than players like Kevin Durant who is 7 feet,1
The only reason theyve lost in the past is the existence of the Warriors  Kevin Durant which is not a team anyone should fairly have been expected to beat imo It ruined parity in the NBA and now its gone Rockets could have won it all in any of those years,0

Yeah technically they lost to the best team of all time 2016 739 warriors and Kevin Durant combined So not fair to say they were bad at all,0
i literally decided like 10 mins ago that the only thing funnier than missing 27 straight 3s is losing to a warriors team with no kevin durant man i cant wait to troll the rox,0
Jimmy is younger than Kevin Durant and only 5 months older than Klay He already deserved a 4 year max At worst Jimmys game will develop into a better Iggy He takes care of his body and is always in top shape,1
You do realize Kevin Durant isnt playing for the remainder of the series so this makes absolutely no sense right,-1
Warriors are 261 in the last 27 games they have played without Kevin Durant but with Steph Curry in the lineup,0
Actually Kevin Durant is responsible for that,1
Steph has been this efficient with or without Kevin Durant Dame has never shot a season at 40 from 3 Either way hes going to be a pretty unanimous 1st team all NBA which suggests he was comfortably better even with missing more games,1
Same production as Dame on slightly better efficiency but Dame doesnt get to play next to Kevin Durant Dame was also better defensively and a better playmaker,1
Kevin Durant like frame haha,1
Lmaooooo if Kevin fucking durant comes at you asking for the max you get on your needs and prepare to whip out that big fat check book deposit it into his big fat checking account,0
I agree but there are 2 free agents who could make them a conference finalist favorite Kawaii Leonard or Kevin Durant Plus they need shooting to surround whoever they have next year,1
Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are skilled players They get into better rhythm when Kevin Durant off the floor That first 20142015 season was special team,1
K so Kevin Durant is doing very well as we all know but he has only done it through two series while Lebrun would have done it throughout the entire playoffs,0
Kevin Durant,0
Rodney Hood or Kevin Durant  Same person I think,0
Personally I think Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the league right now but James Harden did phenomenal during the regular season as well Anyways did you see the cumshot on that slut Theyre gonna need to throw her in a carwash to wipe her clean,1
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard Thats all,0
Why Kevin Durant may leave altogether this offseason and the league is wide open again,0
Its not even about take what you can get  Who in their right mind would max Jimmy Butler over Kevin Durant,0
Harden is top 3 How Hes better than Giannis LeBron Kevin Durant Anthony Davis kawhi    Are you delusional lmao,1
Last year Rockets won game 5 to take the series 32 and lost CP3   Warriors win game 5 to take series 32 and lose Kevin Durant    Game 5 next year how about all the superstars sit out,1
This random pagehttpscanbacomnewsnbaplayoffs2019whohasbeenbetterthispostseasonkawhileonardorkevinduranttorontoraptorsgoldenstatewarriorslru4tvqqmkct1x2wlhy1wlstj on the internet agrees with you,1
Why is Kevin Durant laying around on center court,0
If the Nuggets win I think Durant should sit out the next series just to be safe Nothing is more important than your health Kevin,1
Every team with cap space will offer Jimmy the max outside of the teams that have already used their cap space up to sign Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant,0
Kemba gave a look of pleasant surprise Kyrie belted We got an expletive clan now And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door exNBA star Kevin Garnett said Da fuq is this,1
Interestingly it looks like so far Kevin Durant Kawhi and Giannis are head to head for a surefire 1 place pretty interesting,1
Ah yes elite defenders Steph Curry and Kevin Durant Ok,1
Kevin Durant has won as many playoff series without an allstar teammate as Westbrook,1
are yall serious   kevin durant,0
I have a hard time believing anyone can beat Kevin Durant,0
lol and if John Stockton had Kevin Durant on his team Stockton wouldnt be considered the best player either As a matter of fact John Stockton usually was not the best player on his team for most of his career,1
Kevin Durant as a talent is easily top 15 of all time so its hard to knock on Steph for not being the best on his team But he has the accomplishments to be considered top 1020 along with kd,1
That Kyrie is coming and now they have room for one Kevin Durant,0
They both pass to Kevin Durant,0
Excuse me can I play Kevin of Durant in the Monstarfish  No Brandon Youreyoure in the wave  Lmao,1
Nah Durant Kevin Durant has stayed remarkably healthy and is unstoppable on offence   The dude is a 7 footer with the skills of a guard,0
gt If you want some scrub go to an eliminated house if you want a king earn him   Kevin Cersei Lannister Durant,1
Lol and why do people always try to switch the argument up Of fucking course they are better with Kevin Durant But they are still really good without him Rockets in 5 is an incredibly dumb take dont try to move the goal post now,0
Kevin Durant wont go play for the Knicks unless someone else is coming No way hes just gonna go play on his own,-1
Kevin Durant junior,0
Klay Thompson hits a 3 early in the game looks toward the Raptors bench and rips off his mask to reveal the face of Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant is coming back for the Finals is the new Kawhi doesnt have any issue with Spurs management hell be back next year,-1
Not Kevin Durant because of the calf and all hard to leap,0
I know the media is so crazy They call their team overpowered with Kevin Durant and without him they cant beat an OK raptors team,-1
Its just reporting news No one said in a surprising turn of events Kevin Durant will not play,-1
I think its a conspiracy to keep Kevin Durant out of Game 4 so that the Warriors lose the series,-1
Watching McKinnie and Jerebko airballs open 3s and realizing that that would normally be Kevin Durant lmao,1
Kevin Durant already isnt coming back for the finals so,0
What happens if an inactive player in street clothes shoves an opponent after a play What if you replace this guy with Kevin Durant,1

Well yeah Kevin Durant hadnt shed his skin yet,1

Kevin Durant didnt bulk up at all ever since he went into the NBA,0
Usher probably like Sir Kevin Durant had invited you to join him for the rest of the game Follow me,1
3rd quarter dubs minus Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Kevon Looney yes,1
Oh of course Lebron chose to have srub teammates he passed on adding James Harden and Kevin Durant to his team lmao Get out of here there are only role players for teams to choose from to pick up   He never ever threatened to leave he even signed a 2 year deal after the 2015 finals,1
Kevin Durant,0
People rarely are Kevin Durant,0
Yeah that was obvious when the guy has Kevin Durant as his flair the bandwagon player himself  Although KD is actually hot fire and the Warriors are definitely missing him,0
Totally agree it is evenly matched without KD warriors are OP and become extreme favorites with him playing I will be finishing my book on how Kevin Durant ruined basketball stay tuned,1
Hes out playing the guy who is injured Nice We might as well say that Steph is the best player in the league After all he is outplaying Kevin Durant and LeBron right now,1
Kevin Durant wants to know your location,0
Is Kevin Durant even at these games I never see him on the bench when they pan to it,0
Disadvantaged 2 future HoFers and Half of Boogie Cousins LeBron had Timofey Mozgov and got mocked for losing Theyll be fine They only have Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant coming back soon,-1
Thats fair but Kevin Durant and klay Thompson are out Thats not even close to the same,0
You realize Kevin fucking Durant and Klay Thompson are hurt right and didnt play,-1
Steph Currys Legacy 2015 Beat a Cavs team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love FMVP is Iggy  2016 Blew a 31 lead and was LeBrons bitch 2017 Durant saved his ass 2018 Durant saved his ass Again,-1
And if Kevin Durant was healthy What would the series look like then Nostradamus,1
On level 2 of the game the other team gets a Kevin Durant alongside their already top 3 player  On level 3 a random starter on your team is replaced with JR Smith,1
Remember a few years ago when Steph came back from injury against Portland He took about a quarter to get adjusted then roasted em in Portland   This is Kevin fuckin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant just ran for the first time in 3 weeks on Monday This is the NBA not rec league Hes not going to literally hop up off the couch and drop 40 in the finals,-1
If hes unsure then he probably wont play as the Kevin Durant we know But still anything is better than nothing but then again the Raps are really good,1
Curry has always played with the second best shooter of all time not named Stephen LeBron would have killed for JR Smith to have instead been any of Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Draymond Green DeMarcus Cousins Andre Iguodala Shaun Livingston,1
If you replace Kevin Durant with Kyrie you get a whole new meaning,0
Kyrie and Kevin Love ltltltltltltltltltlt Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,1
Man lucky for the Raptors that Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson didnt play in Game 3 They pretty much have it in the bag now,1
The Knicks are also winless in the Finals without Kevin Durant in the past 20 years,0
I forgot that Klay Thompson Andre Igoudala and oh yeah Kevin Durant died,-1
 i hope Kevin Durant is not going to play again this year,1
Why you talking like the series is over lol they are still missing one Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant backstage crying in his mommas arms,-1

Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Kevin Durant,0
I guess well be seeing Kevin Durant in game 4,1
Its true and you know it Add Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant in to this game and it would have been over from tipoff,1
httpswwwcbssportscomnbanewsnbafinals2019warriorshopekevindurantdoesenoughinpracticetomakegame4returnagainstraptors Mmmm this story from today says that kerr hopes KD can get some light work in practice tommorow Hmm,1
Having Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on your team keeps you from having to score 40 a game you idiot,-1
Kevin Durant out game 4 with a broken heart,-1
Kevin Durant Warriors need you lmfao,1
this series would be a lot more interesting if we had Kevin Kevon Durant,1
So has Kevin Durant been shitting his pants for 9 days straight Wtf is his excuse B,-1

Probably Kevin Durant,0
Curry is gonna have to be consistent dudes already puffing air after one quarterI wish he did but I doubt he has that gas tank only a handful players can do this all game Lebron James Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant,-1

You might be missing guys but theres no excuse for bad defense  Ok Mark Jackson because missing Kevin Durant Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney would never ever affect your defensive capabilities This guy is so hard to listen to lmao,-1
if golden state is serious about winning this game you trap kawhi and force torontos role players to make three pointers tonight  you dont have the talent to switch anything right now without 40 minutes of klay and kevin durant,0
WHERES KEVIN DURANT,0
Kevin Durant so what would you say you do here,0
Can Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins name a single player of the White Sox roster,0
You dont think the added defense from Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins wouldve effected how well Lillard does against the Warriors   He could barely drive to the hoop as is that series without two additional 7 footers switching onto him every PnR and clogging the lane,1
Yes but you cant seriously compare Steph curry and Kevin Durant to Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili,1
LeBron with this Raptors team versus Warriors without Kevin Durant  Easy LeChampionship,-1
No But also neither kyrie Irving nor Kevin love are as good as either Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson,-1
Seeing all these people compare Kyrie and Love to Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant is hysterical man,1
There are still chances  Kevin Durant come here bby,1
Maybe maybe not The Spurs were washed up zombies at that point Kawhi Leonard isnt Kevin Durant especially back then Kawhi is top 5 Kevin is top 2 Then you take out Klay and my point is absolutely made,1
why would you need a flair to make fun of kevin durant,1
I do even though Kevin Durant is a better isolation scorer Steph Curry has the advantage in playmaking playing off ball and the gravity he exerts on the defense Plus he can score from all areas on the court just like Kevin Durant,1
If anyone can convince Kevin Durant to come home itd be him Wizards need to get him at all costs,1
Drunk people cheering when their team gets lead gt people celebrating the fact the Kevin Durant suffered a monster injury Cry me a fucking river,-1

Lets see if this sub tries to pretend that losing Kyrie and Love is equivalent to losing Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,0
Appreciate the take but you just compared Conley to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and you should therefore be fucking ashamed,-1
Golden State would have absolutely massacred Toronto if healthy  Broken Kevin Durant in game 5 looked like he could have scored 50  Imagine over an entire series  KD is probably the one player in the league right now who is immune to Kawhi Leonard,1
Lmao They lost KEVIN DURANT and KLAT THOMPSON for significant time If healthy they win easily buddy,1
How about the past two Warriors titles get asterisks because they added Kevin Durant to a team that won 73 fucking games in one season,1
kevin durant the best player in the league and klay thompson who scored 30 in two quarters both seriously injured and you have the audacity to say POTENTIALLY marred lmfao,1
Warriors fans in 2015  you play the guys in front of you Warriors fans before the 2019 finals  this team is better without Kevin Durant Warriors fans after the 2019 finals  ASTERISK,1

Kevin Durant is in a dark room on his phone watching Brons Twitter feed and wiping the drool from his face right now,0
but I think the warriors had like 5 players that were either top 15 or lottery draft picks and the raptors had 0 The warriors had Klay Thompson Steph Curry Kevin durant Andrew Bogut and DeMarcus Cousins Thats almost unheard of I think the Cavs had a lot at one time as well,1
the warriors are like 810 in the finals without Kevin Durant They are a year older I dont see how they would be the favorites,1

Fun fact Kevin Durant used his fake account to troll Chris Boucher when he was a rookie on the Warriors,0
June 30th to about July 5th is crazier  On June 30th I was at Walmart and decided to quickly post saying Kevin Durant will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies I put my phone down for a minute and came back and saw 60 upvotes about as many comments and the post had been removed already,0
Trade him to the western conference The bulk ofo the best players are over there Kevin Durant certainly thinks he is good He went to Brooklyn to play with him,1
He averaged 3678 on the same efficient as Kevin Durant in their series last year  If he didnt have to run into the greatest team ever made he would be a champion already   HardenGang,1
yes kevin durant just did this lebron did this when he opted out the first time in cleveland a lot of other examples but they have to agree to it,1
People legit say stuff like this about Kawhi and PG when just a few months ago we saw a team with Klay Steph DeMarcus Draymond and Kevin Durant not win a title lol,-1
I agree   Everybody shits on him for not beating  a 73 win team that added Kevin durant but where is literally everybody else in the fucking league Either sitting at home watching or in Cleveland waiting to get blown out by the warriors in the finals,0
Looks like Kevin DurantGreg Oden 20 at this point sorry zion,1
Im still not understanding this take Kevin Durant is easily the 2nd best in the league and hes still a good margin away from Lebron,1
Yep basically that  Hes on 25th per Bleacher Reporthttpsbleacherreportcomarticles511690kevindurantandtherealbestnbascorerseverminutebyminuteslide28,1
Yeah fuck Harden for not being able to beat Kevin Durant Steph Curry Klay Thompson and Draymond Green with role players What a bum,-1
gtI think Kevin Durant was better last year  Ok why,1
Basically lebron has longevity over kawhi Kawhi was a late bloomer and is younger But kawhi also has to tone it down in the regular season due to his degenerative condition Last playoffs kawhi was on that best player in the playoffs level along with James harden and Kevin Durant,1
I think LeBron is still the best player too and I think Kevin Durant was better last year though i do not see that happening again because of his injury,1

Im kinda new to basketball What is LeBron implying The Cavs with LeBron and Kyrie beat the Warriors in the 2016 Finals right But what is LeBron saying here about Kevin Durant or Love and Kyrie,1
Yeah definitely nothing to do with personality Kevin Durant was always better than Westbrook despite what most people said about leadership etc,1
Uh no actually the reason for that is a guy named Kevin Durant who completely shifted the balance of power in the league Cavs wouldve beaten the warriors again in 2017 had KD not been there,-1
KEVIN DURANT ,0
Well they liked him the first two games and then KD said Im Kevin Durant and literally averaged 40 the rest of the series,1
Kevin Durant 2014 is pretty close but Westbrook was out for a lot of the season  Westbrook was definitely the alpha,1
Dude half the people in this thread are out of their minds Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer of this generation Maybe 1 or 2 ever  Harden is amazing but hes not quite on Durants level And Durant might not really be on Jordan  Wilt  Kareems level,1

Not even underrating Curry I think its insane hes able to make an argument A lot of people are stuck in 2016 when it comes to Curry but Hardens been better ever since then by the stats This year he will be by the wins now that Curry doesnt have Kevin Durant on his team,1

My point is Kevin Durant couldve improved his playoff efficiency playing on any team that doesnt start Robertsonyou make it seem like curry is the only capable player of improving KDs efficiency,1
Steph is not held to the same standards as LeBron James and Kevin Durant or even James Harden A bad Steph game is whatever a bad lebron game or a bad James Harden game is groundbreaking And I say this as someone that HAAAAAATES James Harden and LeBron James on the court,-1
Kevin Durant isnt offensively better than Lebron,0
Yes I watched it Your point Curry isnt the best offensive player of the last 20 years at all Nothing backs that up Its easily Kevin Durant followed probably by Kobe or LeBron,1

Bro kevin durant doesnt even want the warriors to win,1
Kevin Durant  really wanted him to bring a championship to okc,1
Yeah its actually pretty funny watching defenses lose track of freaking Kevin Durant,1

Lol illegal defense AND the Bulls dont shoot threes give the team with Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry,0
470 or so would be a great deal for him Thats basically a 345 extension but smoothed out   Whatever he signs as long as dollars and years above what he declined are in the 1215 range hes made the right move Injuries are risk moneywise if youre not literally Kevin Durant or Lebron,0
But the way the Warriors play its not about individual defense its about knowing who and where to help off Just because he is Pippen or because he is Rodman doesnt mean they would know how to handle that kind of motion offense Especially with Steph Klay and Kevin Durant Its too much,1

Agree Its not about the money its more about forming a superteam and not being the 1st option  If he signed with the Lakers he wouldnt lose money on the long run    Kevin Durant did discounts with the Warriors but he hadnt win any rings before unlike Kawhi that already has two FMVPs,-1

gt And Id imagine Steph shot a shit load more catch and shoot 3s than Harden  Yes because he played with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson   Nothing youre citing to prove steph is better accounts for the benefits he receives by playing with those two,1
Well its a very specific kind of injury where the opposing team ends up having Kevin Durant Klay Thompson and Draymond Green,-1
Not saying youre wrong but do you have a statistic to back this up I will concede that Klays usage goes down with KD but thats because its Kevin Freaking Durant He should get shots lol,0

Serious question for OP Is Kevin Durant a better player than Prime Shaquille ONeal ever was  Please explain,1
Because Curry was the leading scorer of the finals not Kawhi  Klay is not better than Kawhi Klay outplayed Kawhi in the finals  Kevin Durant in the 11 minutes he played also OUTPLAYED Kawhi,0
I dont think Kawhi is close or will ever be close Kevin Durant is MILES better in every aspect of the game Including winning championships,1
This would make slightly more sense if OKC hadnt offered Westbrook a supermax and if he hadnt signed it Just like the offered one to Durant Unless you mean Kevin Love who signed one in Cleveland   Nothing like a Lakers fan being a dick to small markets,1

I said they are MVP players to describe them and they are Just because they didnt win MVP that year doesnt mean they arent MVP type players Is Kevin Durant on the 2017 Warriors not an MVP player because he didnt win MVP that year Imo he is,-1
Maybe he really wanted to be part of a motion offense The problem is hes Kevin Durant and sometimes the best play is just to give him the ball especially  against a team playing crazy defense in the playoffs,1

Curry really came out of no where in the middle of this decade before that Kevin Durant was the far and away 2 to LeBron,-1
I think everyone is taking this the wrong way Kevin Durant has said before that the motion offense can become very exhausting and sometimes he would have preferred that the Warriors would have ran set plays like the Clippers or Spurs do,-1

I think it was Richard Jefferson who said that all The Warriors needed to beat them was a consistent wing who could knock down all the open threes they were getting They really didnt have to go out and get Kevin Durant just a slight upgrade over Harrison Barnes,0
Kevin Durant and Westbrook did it in 2012,0
The reason they got Durant is that they could and Durant wanted to go there to everyones surprise I dont think you need a deep basketball reason to make a move on Kevin Durant in free agency,1

Can you imagine if this team also had Demarcus cousins or Kevin Durant,0
Could you imagine if this warriors team added someone like Kevin Durant,1
OOOH who lives as a serpent under the bridge Kevin Durant,0
The answer is Kevin Durant Dude hasnt averaged 27ppg his career average since hes joined the warriors,0
gtHad they been healthier this couldve been a lot closer  You sure you wanna talk about healthier when the dubs were missing Kevin frikking Durant Oh and Demarcus Cousins for good measure oh and Andre Iguodala in the last game too lol,1
the Warriors need Kevin Durant so much s,0
Can we acknowledge one more time how ridiculous it was that Kevin Durant was added to this team,-1
Kevin Durant is like the fourth piece of paper towel when you only needed three to clean up the spill,1
Kevin the hardest road Durant sits out the WCF  GS still sweep LMAO,1
Nobody is cheering harder for the Blazers tonight than Kevin Durant,1
Honestly Nurkic fucked the team over by getting hurt They also need to add a Kevin Durant type,-1
Portland is getting Kevin Durant this summer,0
BILL WALTON KEVIN DURANT KAWHI LEONARD MYERS LEONARD quik maths,0
Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant,1
I imagine he was talking about Kevin Durant or someone else The context doesnt makes sense for it to be Kawhi,0
Kevin Durant would like a word in that argument,0
But KD is also Kraft dinner And to be honest idk if Kevin Durant is better than Kraft dinner,1
Calling them by their initials isnt that common partly because of the problem you pointed out Like most people think of AI as Allen Iverson KD just sounds cool and is quicker than Kevin Durant,1
Would be a pretty epic move of the Warriors to find some random Kevin Durant and bring him along   Or just people with KD initials   Reporters Are you bringing KD to Toronto  Warriors Ha Were bringing three KDs,1
Its funny  Kevin Durant going to GSW could end up fucking the salaries of future players  Truly a snake,1
Yes KD is Kevin Durant  KD plays for Warriors but he is hurt right now Warriors are playing very well without Kevin,1
I just recently got into basketball so Im not sure what this post is related too Whats going on with KD And is KD Kevin Durant,-1
gtHe also has the best TS in the finals ever  Kevin Durant   2012 65 TS  2017 654 TS  2018 698 TS  Currys peak is 619 in a Finals series only time he wasnt in the 5559 range,1
Good thing they clarified which Kevin Durant they were talking about   Des Moines based ventriloquist Kevin Durant,1
Cleveland built a team that went to 4 straight finals and feasibly couldve 3peated if not for injuries and Kevin Durant What a horrible path that would be for the Lakers to take,-1
Ill lose in the first round for 100 years before Id ever cheer for Kevin Durant again,-1
Yooo that kid is a baller I would love him long scorer defensive potential great value Kevin Durant right now 19 as well Shit he could be the steal of the draft,1
httpswwwmercurynewscom20190520kevindurantblastsfanwhowasinnocentlycelebratingthewarriorsgame3victory  he likes to banter,1
video captures Kevin Durant cheering for the Raptors,1
gtwould adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 201819 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors  It wouldnt be even close Rodgers to Rams would be far more impactful,0
Yes but is adding an allstar QB as important to an NFL team as adding an allstar starter on a NBA team  Eg would adding MVP Aaron Rodgers to the 201819 Rams be the same as adding Kevin Durant to the Warriors  Id argue the latter is way more valuable,1
I love Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Dwight Howard Durant,0
Kobe was an allstar and still dicked the spurs Remember Kobe was a young player and not a fully developed 30 year old like Kevin Durant Its hilarious hes still living in peoples heads even after retirement Kobe also won 2 ships with his own team something KD will never do,1
Uh Kevin Durant has,0
He said it during an interview after he joined the team  httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsearlyleadwp20160707kevindurantsaysjoiningwarriorssuperteamisthehardestroadnoredirectonamputmterm796e1595413e,0
And Kevin Durant is 69,0
They lost the ship that year thats why the recruited Durant Kevin is easily talked into things it seems,0
And and thats without Kevin Durant and Boogie Cousins,0
Kevin Durant has no eyelids so he can never close his eyes or blink Instead of eyelids thin clear membrane cover his corneas called spectacles or brilles These are attached to his skin Although he cant close his eyes he can close the retinas when sleeping,0
Oh I get it Its because hes never been to the finals  I guess youre right I have no room to criticize a player from another team Especially because my home team hasnt made the finals in a long time  Guess Ill go ahead and order my Kevin Durant jersey now,-1
I could see Kevin Durant being on rnba up voting and downvoting and making comments,0
Kevin durant too because of his already comical proportions  I think Kawhi Giannis AD and maybe Harden are good picks as well,1
Plot twist OP is really Kevin Durant,0
And thats one of the reasons youre not Kevin Durant,0
how did you forget kevin durant lol,1

Kevin Durant would beat anyone in the history of the league 1v1,0
I knew this was going to happen  Kevin Durant is healthy He has no incentive to play Its a business decision  Durant is gone,1
Yea but wasnt Kevin Durant on a few the teams,0
Why not Theyre the Knicks and hes Kevin Durant I dont think the Warriors did a physical on Kd when he joined them,0

We beat them with Chris Paul while we didnt have Kevin Durant this year  Chris Paul would have helped them but the narrative that Chris Paul would have been the difference maker is dead,-1
One of my favorite tweets that gets underrated is the clippersKevin Durant interview   Clippers meeting with Durant was intense and at one point Steve Ballmer was crying but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned,0
No LeBron Canadian team and an overwhelming favourite I will have to say no  Honestly I havent watched the playoffs as much in previous years because I am a hockey fan and it had been a forgone conclusion the warriors win the finals ever year since Kevin Durant joined,1
AllPlayoff Team   C  Nikola Jokic  F  Kevin Durant  F  Kawhi Leonard  G  James Harden  G  Stephen Curry,0
Kevin Durant will be moving to Toronto next year if the Raptors win the finals  So count him out,1
Because no one is saying bev suffers from mental fragility which is so sweetly ironic that a bunch of teen suburban white boys on an Internet forum have the gall to call Kevin Durant who worked his ass off in the streets of PG county to come out of the mud and make a name for himself soft,-1
Home court advantage   No Kevin Durant   Steph Curry injured with 0 points in the first half   Still lost    Never change Houston Chockets never change,-1
Are the Warriors better without Kevin Durant My column,1
Why does everyone forget that the Warriors were the best team in the league before Kevin durant they were championship teams before durant,1
Golden state is this good and they are missing kevin fucking Durant,1
DONT LET KEVIN DURANT MISSING THIS GAME MAKE YOU FORGET THE WARRIORS WON GAME 67 LAST HEAR WITHOUT ANDRE IGUODALA,0
Kevin Durant injured               Curry scoreless first half             Rocketsstill lose,-1
Warriors dropped all their bench to get boogie and Kevin Durant Curry is playing injured and its looking like theyre going to make the rockets look like fools  Rockets cant win in the postseason,-1
Kevin durant is quite possibly the best player in the game right now but goddamn if the durantless warriors are so fun to watch,1
Lol the Warriors are still the best team in the league without Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins  Let that sink in for a second,1
Kevin Durant  The hardest road,0
Kevin Durant Whos that  Curry and Klay probably,0
Kevin Mr Superfluous Durant,0
Hello 911  Hi the Warriors dont need Kevin Durant  Ok Im sending a unit your way right now,1
Warriors are better without ballhog Kevin Durant,1
I love how the rockets are choking theyre playing a fucking back to back nba championship team This team got Kevin Durant AFTER winning 2 titles Maybe theyre just good,1
Lol Kevin Durant gets doubled all the time on GSW Even if you watched only Ximo Pierto highlights you would know that  I swear people do not watch basketball on this subreddit,1
Except Kevin Durant,0
Did Kevin Durant change the way offense is played Thats what revolutionary means Even if Kevin Durant is a better overall scorer he isnt a better shooter and clearly isnt as revolutionary of a scorer,1
Kevon Looney gt Kevin Durant  Steph Curry gt Seth Curry,1
I would just like to say that all of my previous takes on this series were based on Kevin Durant being healthy,1
Kevon looney out there playing like kevin durant,1
Is Iguodala actually Kevin Durant,0
Well didnt you read the article how explaining how Kevin Durant is awesome BECAUSE of Steph Curry,1
Kevin Durant may be outplaying Steph and hes in Oakland,0
Kevin Durant is injured   Steph Curry is scoreless   And the game is tied   Anyone wouldve told you youre on drugs if you prophesied this before this game,-1
The game is tied and the warriors are playing without Kevin Durant AND Steph Curry,1
Imagine if golden state played team ball but with Kevin Durant as well,1
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and Kevin Looney,0
Imagine if they had Kevin Durant and steph curry,0
DampD Dany forgot that Kevin Durant got hurt,-1
Kevon Kevin Durant Looney,0
Was cooking a second ago did JVG implicitly compare Steph to frickin  BJ Armstrong in his Kevin DurantbeingoutislikeJordanbeingout spiel,0
Who needs Kevin Durant when you have Kevon Looney,0
Klay Thompson is actually just a better Kevin Durant,1
Why is this game so close Tied without Kevin Durant smh,1
Kevon Kevin Durant Looney,0
Imagine being so stacked that losing KEVIN FUCKIN DURANT might not matter hahaha  KLAY IS HEATING UP,-1
Great interview with PJ Tucker there and Van Gundy completely misses the fucking point as always  We clearly arent BETTER without Kevin Durant but in the short term it can really refocus everyone,1
They were waving bye bye to Kevin Durant,0
Hes 65 and was already guarding Kevin Durant,0
Golden State only won because of Kevin Durant One I dont think they make it without him two he was the difference maker Clevelands offense was pound for pound just as good if not better than theirs they just had KD on top of it,1
Reminder that last time the Warriors played the Rockets without Kevin Durant they eliminated the Rockets from the playoffs with Stephen Curry only playing a total of 38 minutes in the series,1
As much as I dont want to agree Kevin Durant fits the mold pretty well,1
Who the fuck is Kevin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant is good but he aint no Jordan Binnington,1

Despite going down 30 and ultimately losing 41 that 2017 Cavs team was really good but got stonewalled by a 73win team plus Kevin Durant and a massive chip on their shoulder,0
Derek Fisher has won as many NBA championships as LeBron James and Kevin Durant combined,1
Yeah technically they lost to the best team of all time 2016 739 warriors and Kevin Durant combined So not fair to say they were bad at all,0
i literally decided like 10 mins ago that the only thing funnier than missing 27 straight 3s is losing to a warriors team with no kevin durant man i cant wait to troll the rox,0
Jimmy is younger than Kevin Durant and only 5 months older than Klay He already deserved a 4 year max At worst Jimmys game will develop into a better Iggy He takes care of his body and is always in top shape,1
You do realize Kevin Durant isnt playing for the remainder of the series so this makes absolutely no sense right,-1
Warriors are 261 in the last 27 games they have played without Kevin Durant but with Steph Curry in the lineup,0
Actually Kevin Durant is responsible for that,1
Steph has been this efficient with or without Kevin Durant Dame has never shot a season at 40 from 3 Either way hes going to be a pretty unanimous 1st team all NBA which suggests he was comfortably better even with missing more games,1
Same production as Dame on slightly better efficiency but Dame doesnt get to play next to Kevin Durant Dame was also better defensively and a better playmaker,1
Kevin Durant like frame haha,1
Lmaooooo if Kevin fucking durant comes at you asking for the max you get on your needs and prepare to whip out that big fat check book deposit it into his big fat checking account,0
I agree but there are 2 free agents who could make them a conference finalist favorite Kawaii Leonard or Kevin Durant Plus they need shooting to surround whoever they have next year,1
Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson are skilled players They get into better rhythm when Kevin Durant off the floor That first 20142015 season was special team,1
K so Kevin Durant is doing very well as we all know but he has only done it through two series while Lebrun would have done it throughout the entire playoffs,0
Kevin Durant,0
Rodney Hood or Kevin Durant  Same person I think,0
Personally I think Kevin Durant is the best scorer in the league right now but James Harden did phenomenal during the regular season as well Anyways did you see the cumshot on that slut Theyre gonna need to throw her in a carwash to wipe her clean,1
Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard Thats all,0
Why Kevin Durant may leave altogether this offseason and the league is wide open again,0
Its not even about take what you can get  Who in their right mind would max Jimmy Butler over Kevin Durant,0
Harden is top 3 How Hes better than Giannis LeBron Kevin Durant Anthony Davis kawhi    Are you delusional lmao,1
Last year Rockets won game 5 to take the series 32 and lost CP3   Warriors win game 5 to take series 32 and lose Kevin Durant    Game 5 next year how about all the superstars sit out,1
This random pagehttpscanbacomnewsnbaplayoffs2019whohasbeenbetterthispostseasonkawhileonardorkevinduranttorontoraptorsgoldenstatewarriorslru4tvqqmkct1x2wlhy1wlstj on the internet agrees with you,1
Why is Kevin Durant laying around on center court,0
If the Nuggets win I think Durant should sit out the next series just to be safe Nothing is more important than your health Kevin,1
Every team with cap space will offer Jimmy the max outside of the teams that have already used their cap space up to sign Kawhi Leonard or Kevin Durant,0
Kemba gave a look of pleasant surprise Kyrie belted We got an expletive clan now And before Kevin Durant hit the locker room door exNBA star Kevin Garnett said Da fuq is this,1
Interestingly it looks like so far Kevin Durant Kawhi and Giannis are head to head for a surefire 1 place pretty interesting,1
Ah yes elite defenders Steph Curry and Kevin Durant Ok,1
Kevin Durant has won as many playoff series without an allstar teammate as Westbrook,1
are yall serious   kevin durant,0
I have a hard time believing anyone can beat Kevin Durant,0
lol and if John Stockton had Kevin Durant on his team Stockton wouldnt be considered the best player either As a matter of fact John Stockton usually was not the best player on his team for most of his career,1
Kevin Durant as a talent is easily top 15 of all time so its hard to knock on Steph for not being the best on his team But he has the accomplishments to be considered top 1020 along with kd,1
That Kyrie is coming and now they have room for one Kevin Durant,0
They both pass to Kevin Durant,0
Excuse me can I play Kevin of Durant in the Monstarfish  No Brandon Youreyoure in the wave  Lmao,1
Nah Durant Kevin Durant has stayed remarkably healthy and is unstoppable on offence   The dude is a 7 footer with the skills of a guard,0
gt If you want some scrub go to an eliminated house if you want a king earn him   Kevin Cersei Lannister Durant,1
Lol and why do people always try to switch the argument up Of fucking course they are better with Kevin Durant But they are still really good without him Rockets in 5 is an incredibly dumb take dont try to move the goal post now,0
Kevin Durant wont go play for the Knicks unless someone else is coming No way hes just gonna go play on his own,-1
Kevin Durant junior,0
Klay Thompson hits a 3 early in the game looks toward the Raptors bench and rips off his mask to reveal the face of Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant is coming back for the Finals is the new Kawhi doesnt have any issue with Spurs management hell be back next year,-1
Not Kevin Durant because of the calf and all hard to leap,0
I know the media is so crazy They call their team overpowered with Kevin Durant and without him they cant beat an OK raptors team,-1
Its just reporting news No one said in a surprising turn of events Kevin Durant will not play,-1
I think its a conspiracy to keep Kevin Durant out of Game 4 so that the Warriors lose the series,-1
Watching McKinnie and Jerebko airballs open 3s and realizing that that would normally be Kevin Durant lmao,1
Kevin Durant already isnt coming back for the finals so,0
What happens if an inactive player in street clothes shoves an opponent after a play What if you replace this guy with Kevin Durant,1

Usher probably like Sir Kevin Durant had invited you to join him for the rest of the game Follow me,1
3rd quarter dubs minus Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Kevon Looney yes,1
Oh of course Lebron chose to have srub teammates he passed on adding James Harden and Kevin Durant to his team lmao Get out of here there are only role players for teams to choose from to pick up   He never ever threatened to leave he even signed a 2 year deal after the 2015 finals,1
Kevin Durant,0
People rarely are Kevin Durant,0
Yeah that was obvious when the guy has Kevin Durant as his flair the bandwagon player himself  Although KD is actually hot fire and the Warriors are definitely missing him,0
Totally agree it is evenly matched without KD warriors are OP and become extreme favorites with him playing I will be finishing my book on how Kevin Durant ruined basketball stay tuned,1
Hes out playing the guy who is injured Nice We might as well say that Steph is the best player in the league After all he is outplaying Kevin Durant and LeBron right now,1
Kevin Durant wants to know your location,0
Is Kevin Durant even at these games I never see him on the bench when they pan to it,0
Disadvantaged 2 future HoFers and Half of Boogie Cousins LeBron had Timofey Mozgov and got mocked for losing Theyll be fine They only have Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant coming back soon,-1
Thats fair but Kevin Durant and klay Thompson are out Thats not even close to the same,0
You realize Kevin fucking Durant and Klay Thompson are hurt right and didnt play,-1
Steph Currys Legacy 2015 Beat a Cavs team without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love FMVP is Iggy  2016 Blew a 31 lead and was LeBrons bitch 2017 Durant saved his ass 2018 Durant saved his ass Again,-1
And if Kevin Durant was healthy What would the series look like then Nostradamus,1
On level 2 of the game the other team gets a Kevin Durant alongside their already top 3 player  On level 3 a random starter on your team is replaced with JR Smith,1
Remember a few years ago when Steph came back from injury against Portland He took about a quarter to get adjusted then roasted em in Portland   This is Kevin fuckin Durant,-1
Kevin Durant just ran for the first time in 3 weeks on Monday This is the NBA not rec league Hes not going to literally hop up off the couch and drop 40 in the finals,-1
If hes unsure then he probably wont play as the Kevin Durant we know But still anything is better than nothing but then again the Raps are really good,1
Curry has always played with the second best shooter of all time not named Stephen LeBron would have killed for JR Smith to have instead been any of Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Draymond Green DeMarcus Cousins Andre Iguodala Shaun Livingston,1
If you replace Kevin Durant with Kyrie you get a whole new meaning,0
Kyrie and Kevin Love ltltltltltltltltltlt Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,1
Man lucky for the Raptors that Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson didnt play in Game 3 They pretty much have it in the bag now,1
The Knicks are also winless in the Finals without Kevin Durant in the past 20 years,0
I forgot that Klay Thompson Andre Igoudala and oh yeah Kevin Durant died,-1
 i hope Kevin Durant is not going to play again this year,1
Why you talking like the series is over lol they are still missing one Kevin Durant,1
Kevin Durant backstage crying in his mommas arms,-1

Have you heard of a gentleman by the name of Kevin Durant,0
I guess well be seeing Kevin Durant in game 4,1
Its true and you know it Add Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant in to this game and it would have been over from tipoff,1
httpswwwcbssportscomnbanewsnbafinals2019warriorshopekevindurantdoesenoughinpracticetomakegame4returnagainstraptors Mmmm this story from today says that kerr hopes KD can get some light work in practice tommorow Hmm,1
Having Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on your team keeps you from having to score 40 a game you idiot,-1
Kevin Durant out game 4 with a broken heart,-1
Kevin Durant Warriors need you lmfao,1
this series would be a lot more interesting if we had Kevin Kevon Durant,1
So has Kevin Durant been shitting his pants for 9 days straight Wtf is his excuse B,-1
Without Kevin Durant ruining the league basketball is actually fun to watch,1
Probably Kevin Durant,0
Curry is gonna have to be consistent dudes already puffing air after one quarterI wish he did but I doubt he has that gas tank only a handful players can do this all game Lebron James Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant,-1
raptors because of kevin durant,0
You might be missing guys but theres no excuse for bad defense  Ok Mark Jackson because missing Kevin Durant Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney would never ever affect your defensive capabilities This guy is so hard to listen to lmao,-1
if golden state is serious about winning this game you trap kawhi and force torontos role players to make three pointers tonight  you dont have the talent to switch anything right now without 40 minutes of klay and kevin durant,0
WHERES KEVIN DURANT,0
Kevin Durant so what would you say you do here,0
Can Kevin Durant and Demarcus Cousins name a single player of the White Sox roster,0
You dont think the added defense from Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins wouldve effected how well Lillard does against the Warriors   He could barely drive to the hoop as is that series without two additional 7 footers switching onto him every PnR and clogging the lane,1
Yes but you cant seriously compare Steph curry and Kevin Durant to Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili,1
LeBron with this Raptors team versus Warriors without Kevin Durant  Easy LeChampionship,-1
No But also neither kyrie Irving nor Kevin love are as good as either Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson,-1
Seeing all these people compare Kyrie and Love to Klay Thompson and Kevin fucking Durant is hysterical man,1
There are still chances  Kevin Durant come here bby,1
Maybe maybe not The Spurs were washed up zombies at that point Kawhi Leonard isnt Kevin Durant especially back then Kawhi is top 5 Kevin is top 2 Then you take out Klay and my point is absolutely made,1
why would you need a flair to make fun of kevin durant,1
I do even though Kevin Durant is a better isolation scorer Steph Curry has the advantage in playmaking playing off ball and the gravity he exerts on the defense Plus he can score from all areas on the court just like Kevin Durant,1
If anyone can convince Kevin Durant to come home itd be him Wizards need to get him at all costs,1
Drunk people cheering when their team gets lead gt people celebrating the fact the Kevin Durant suffered a monster injury Cry me a fucking river,-1

Whyd u use Durant instead of Kevin huh,0
Kevin Durant died for this,-1
Kevin Durant  Him not playing is the only reason they won lmao,1
Lets see if this sub tries to pretend that losing Kyrie and Love is equivalent to losing Klay and Kevin fucking Durant,0
Appreciate the take but you just compared Conley to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant and you should therefore be fucking ashamed,-1
Golden State would have absolutely massacred Toronto if healthy  Broken Kevin Durant in game 5 looked like he could have scored 50  Imagine over an entire series  KD is probably the one player in the league right now who is immune to Kawhi Leonard,1
Lmao They lost KEVIN DURANT and KLAT THOMPSON for significant time If healthy they win easily buddy,1
How about the past two Warriors titles get asterisks because they added Kevin Durant to a team that won 73 fucking games in one season,1
kevin durant the best player in the league and klay thompson who scored 30 in two quarters both seriously injured and you have the audacity to say POTENTIALLY marred lmfao,1
Warriors fans in 2015  you play the guys in front of you Warriors fans before the 2019 finals  this team is better without Kevin Durant Warriors fans after the 2019 finals  ASTERISK,1

Kevin Durant drops 51 on us 2OT when he was on the thunder  Hit the pull up 35 foot game winner nothing but net,1
This has been my take since 2015 Kevin Durant is why the Warriors are a dynasty,0
Because one Kevin Durant joined the team,0
Kevin Durant isnt playing again this year,0
Honestly Steph Curry is great and he seems like a great guy and I like Klay But I can see why people hate them when they employ Draymond Green who is dirty annoying and good to boot and Kevin Durant who is ultra sensitive on social media and ruined parity in the league,-1
Just another day in the life of Kevin Durant,0
Kevin Durant,0
First title run every team they faced had players injured Blew a 31 lead in 2016 so got mocked for it Then they added Kevin Durant and got loud when they were just too much for everyone else Theyre front runners plain and simple,-1
chris paul and lebron james colluded to manipulate the cap to force kevin durant to join the warriors so now there is a team so stacked that they could lose to them in the playoffs and not have it hurt their legacy all while durant has to deal with wildly unfair scrutiny,-1
Yes as a huge Warriors hater I will say that Steph Curry is even top 5 all time and thats tougher for me to say than anybody on here Steph Curry is the better player and leader than Kevin Durant It just took Curry longer to peak than Durant,1
The Cavs also had to deal with a healthy Kevin Durant in the line up lol Theres no way the Cavs get dominated the past two years playing the warriors  KD Hell they probably would have smoked them in 2017,0

Top 3gt Top 30 its quite simple to understand Are you telling me you genuinely believe a single team wouldnt offer Kevin Durant the max even if he tore his achilles,1
meanwhile Kevin Durant probably not playing the series I like these odds,1
Even if we dont resign him we cant do anything because were way over the cap already Whether he stays or not well only have MLE   And I absolutely see us or almost everyone with the money needed offering him a max even if he tears his ACL its Kevin Durant,0
No Kevin Durant is a top 3 player in the league he could amputate his foot and still get the max,0

Kevin Durant  really wanted him to bring a championship to okc,1

1 Because they wouldnt have had to give more up since KD was also a FA  2 Cause its fucking Kevin Durant yeah theres a high risk to signing him but imagine if you actually got Kevin Durant back Kawhi and him would be unstoppable,-1

One superstar caliber player with him Lou Williams has performed at a fringe all star level with the Clippers Was not a worse player than Russell last season   Kawhi tried to recruit a player that is arguably better than him in Kevin Durant,1
Its debatable whether this Clippers team is a worse supporting cast than the Cavs LeBron joined   Kawhi called Kevin Durant and Paul George to team up LeBron did the same,0
No youre right Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson going down for 90 of the finals had nothing to do with the outcome,-1

The trade was  GSW sends Kevin Durant 1st round pick  Nets send DLo Shabazz Napier Treveon Graham  The Warriors later had to pay 4m to Minnesota to take Napier and Graham off their hands so it was even more ridiculous,-1

Kevin Durant has two Finals MVPs,0
If Kevin Durant never existed I could see a player like Bol Bol going late in the first  But Kevin Durant proved a player like Bol Bol can succeed in the league and we cant forget KD couldnt get 125 for reps at the combine,1
saw one deleted account back in may 29 2015 predict this  2015  Warriors win the title Steph Finals MVP  2016  Cavs win the title Kyrie Finals MVP  then for 2017 and 2018  Kevin Durant Finals MVP  That was almost accurate,1
Lol illegal defense AND the Bulls dont shoot threes give the team with Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry,0
470 or so would be a great deal for him Thats basically a 345 extension but smoothed out   Whatever he signs as long as dollars and years above what he declined are in the 1215 range hes made the right move Injuries are risk moneywise if youre not literally Kevin Durant or Lebron,0
But the way the Warriors play its not about individual defense its about knowing who and where to help off Just because he is Pippen or because he is Rodman doesnt mean they would know how to handle that kind of motion offense Especially with Steph Klay and Kevin Durant Its too much,1
Id have to agree I dont see any other major FA that Clippers could get that tips the scales Kevin Durant or Klay would be the answer but both are out for next yearwilling to stay with GS   Lakers are set up to wreck the west as long as ADaytoDavis stays healthy,0

gt With the Warriors present and future in doubt because of injuries to free agents Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson it would seem like the perfect opportunity for the Rockets to move forward but Paul has made it known hed like to play elsewhere  So he requested a trade,1
I think maybe Harrison Barnes sees the Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson Injuries and is thinking that he needs to lock up a good long term deal right now  Get that guaranteed money for the long run not just a lot of money right now,1
Kevin Durant averaged 35 PPG including a 45 and 50 point game to finish them off so pretending that the Warriors just took it easy on the Clippers makes 0 sense  The Warriors team the Clippers faced was clearly and objectively better than the Warriors team the Raptors faced,1
Kevin Durant says hello,0
Agree Its not about the money its more about forming a superteam and not being the 1st option  If he signed with the Lakers he wouldnt lose money on the long run    Kevin Durant did discounts with the Warriors but he hadnt win any rings before unlike Kawhi that already has two FMVPs,-1

Kevin Durant wasnt going to play with Lebron James and be the 2nd option AND take a paycut AND he hadnt won anything yet in his career Kawhi is far more accomplished right now than KD was when he left OKC,-1
Dude can shoot over majority of players without even jumping Curry is still an elite PG and Durant can play catch and shoot too with open shots Klay dropped 60 with barely any dribbles This is Kevin Durant not some average scorer,-1
Kevin Durant literally just took a paycut after winning back to back finals MVPs but ok,1
