Maybe because some guys named Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were actually healthy most of last season
Kevin Hart as Kevin Durant
"He doesn’t have to be an excellent defender to be a much better option than Russell on that end though. Wiggins is a good on ball defender, although not as consistent as he should be. That’s not uncommon for talented players on bad teams though. A shift to GS, with their structure and with someone like Draymond roaming behind, can be something that takes his defense to another level. He doesn’t have to be a great defender, just good enough. You know, kinda like Barnes was on that 73-win team.  There’s also the positional domino effect that will wreck their team defense.  The GS system on D has revolved around an important dynamic in their backcourt and that is Klay’s ability to defend opposing PGs to hide Curry. That aspect is completely eliminated in any lineup that features Curry and Russell. You’re also destroying your team defense on switches.  Not only that, you’re putting Klay in a position to play SF far more often than he ever has coming off an ACL tear at 30. Klay is not even a particularly good rebounder at SG, let alone SF. Who is going to guard all the top SFs? If Klay is on them, who is hiding Curry? Who is hiding Russell? Oh look, you now have a team that is bad on defense and bad at rebounding.  All of those issues only get multiplied by the fact that Russell needs the ball in his hands a lot to be effective. His USG% right now is 32% to put up 23 and 6. Curry’s USG% last year was 30%.  Every possession the ball is in Curry’s hands is a possession it’s not in Russell’s hand and vice versa. Unlike Durant, this is not a situation of two ultra efficient but different offensive players. Curry is just is another league from Russell and they largely fill the same role. Not only that, Durant brought his defense and rebounding. Any possession Russell doesn’t use on offense you just have a horrendous defender out there.  Is D’Angelo Russell better than Andrew Wiggins in a vacuum? Yeah, he is. But you know you could have said the same thing about Kevin Love and Klay Thompson after the 2013-14 season, only that gap was enormous where as I don’t think the Russell and Wiggins gap is that big at all.  Basketball isn’t played in a vacuum and how a team fits together in the end is what matters most. The Warriors understood this in 2013-14 and Russell even being available shows that they understand this now.  I’m not saying that Wiggins is the best option they can trade him for, just responding to an existing thread about them."
2k19 was terrible because of that imo. Kobe was outclassed at sg to kevin durant.
Brandon Ingram is a poor mans Kevin Durant. They are very similar play styles.
"Yes but that is literally not what I'm talking about.  Kevin Durant is not 7 feet tall, sorry to break it to everyone.  Just because everyone in the NBA liked/likes to add their shoes doesn't mean they're 7 feet tall.  He's 6'10, just like a 5'10 dude is 5'10.  However, on their Tinder profile they're for sure 6 feet just like KD is for sure 7 feet."
Have you heard of Dirk Nowitzki or Kevin Durant?
"They changed the measurements at least once, nba.com had LeBron at 6'9  at one point. They also changed KD's, the number you have is what they had originally: https://www.nba.com/players/kevin/durant/201142 . KD is now at 6'10.   They also raised Cousins and DJ'a height by an inch or more since the summer team data was released.   So I call bullshit on these 'accurate' measurements."
Kevin Durant can’t palm a ball so clearly he has no future in this league.
If you’re limiting it to just this season (which is dumb but whatever) Kevin Durant has missed more games.
Ever heard of a guy named Kevin Durant?
"He has missed those shots before and he will again in the future.   You should never hate on greatness and in very few cases can I think it happens. Disliking a person is one thing, but discrediting lebron James from coming 3-1 down or any of the historic stuff he has done because “he subjects himself to criticism” by some of the questionable career moves he has made. You can compare it against other great things and say why you would pick one over the other, but you can’t say well it’s not that good because it’s lebron James.  It’s historic for a reason.   That’s the point that was made about Harden earlier. Harden wasnt getting the love for doing the stuff he has been doing because it’s Harden. No one is saying don’t love Lillard for what he’s doing, no one is saying Harden was better. Just saying James harden should’ve got credit like this.   It’s not, “what about Harden”. Because no one is doing what Harden is doing or did. The news is about him, not people coming in saying oh Harden did this.   Other superstars get the same treatment, like Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony (back in the day) etc . But you chuck someone who is loved like let’s say SGA because I haven’t seen any negative comments on him, he does this stuff in the future and everyone would froth. No one is crying about it, it’s just more like come on guys let’s start appreciating this greatness, especially our (rockets) own fans  Edit: I can’t believe I spent so much time on that, I apologise to myself, you and everyone who wasted their time over some opinion that means nothing."
"Oh boy that one quick part where it showed KD and Gervin next to each other takes me back to this conversation I once had a long time ago with a fellow NBA fan who was much older than I was. We were talking about a young Kevin Durant getting ready to take over the NBA and then the guy starts going on about how much KD reminds him of the ""Ice man"". I was lectured about how great Gervin was and now seeing this video only cements that guys point even more."
Lmao get tf outta here. What dame has been doing is what curry did for years. It’s hard to score 30 when you got Kevin Fucking Durant on your squad.
he’s mostly referring to the tweets re: the best player to put on an OKC joint and ensuing TV drama rinse   [Kendrick Perkins Said 'Sensitive' Kevin Durant Made Twitter Beef About Himself](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870718-kendrick-perkins-said-sensitive-kevin-durant-made-twitter-beef-about-himself)
"Yes, the official contract signing with the Celtics was after KD signed with the Warriors. However, Horford made his decision days prior to KD making his  [That's why the articles were on July 2](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/boston-celtics-al-horford-kevin-durant-nba-rumors-atlanta-hawks)"
" IMO:I think the team they had going into 2017 with KD would have been better than the team they had that choked 3-1....also I think GSW doesn't keep barnes either way and is weaker in 2017 as a result. OKC was a better matchup for CLE, and they had SAS's and HOU's number with Durant.   You had KD+WB+Dipo+Adams as a core  Roberson as a strong Defensive wing, Kanter as a backup scoring center. And they probably could still do the payne / grant / Taj deal + they become a better buyout landing spot.   *AND* they had some room given the 2016-2017 cap dynamics to add a top 20 FA piece. Who that might be we can't really say. Horford was the name thrown around at the time with:  &gt;The salt in the wound for Oklahoma City? Had Durant given a verbal commitment to return to the Thunder, they were very confident that fellow free agent Al Horford would have come too. Horford, the 30-year-old forward who agreed to sign with the Boston Celtics, played under Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan during his University of Florida days. [source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/07/04/kevin-durant-warriors-free-agent-thunder/86684632/)  But that's an unknown either way they would have likely picked up *something* with KD staying.   I would bet on them being the favorites if he had stayed but it's the NBA so with injuries, schedules etc. nothing is for certain."
"&gt; People are saying Al Horford ""would've joined OKC if KD stayed"". But he has never confirmed that, although Al Horford mentioned that he did ""consider"".  Horford actually tried to recruit Durant to the Celtics.  Al committed to Boston days before Celtics met with Kevin in the Hamptons."
Consensus top 3 in 2013... you are legit not right in the head if you think that. Lebron Kevin Durant Chris Paul. You’re gonna argue in 2013 that wade was still better than any of them at that point?
2015 was so fuckin lame with Kyrie and Love being out. Then they have Kevin fuckin Durant in 17 and 18? So annoying.
"I think Durant. Kobe said he is the only player he couldnt figure out before he retired. From Kobe :      *“Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him.*  *When he first came into the league, he was easy to defend because he couldn’t go right and shoot. He used to kind of shoot across his face, so that was a weakness that he had. Also in the post, he couldn’t turn left shoulder, everything was* *right* *shoulder, so that gave me areas that I could shut off.*  *Then he started developing it. And now he can pull up left, he can pull up right, he can shoot the long ball, he has runners, left hand, right hand. Before he had a* *left hand* *finish at the rim, I could always send him left, force him all the way to the basket. Even with the advantage of his size, he was still uncomfortable finishing with his left. So I could clamp the right hand and force him in a tough situation.*  *But now he developed that. So then I couldn’t really figure out, is this a rhythm thing? I’m trying to count the seconds that he takes to make his move. When does he make them, at what times in the game? I couldn’t really figure out that rhythm.*  *So I retired not being able to figure him out.”*"
"Kevin Durant:  MJ and Kobe are 1A and 1B. Skillwise, Kobe is second  to none."
"The Portland Trail Blazers are pretty fun to watch. They have a once-in-a-generation superstar in Damian Lillard, and his partner in crime CJ McCollum is a straight bucket getter. They also got the grandpa baller in Carmelo Anthony and you will get to witness Dame time and 35 feet+ 3s on the daily.  The Los Angeles Clippers, arguably the best team in the league by far. Also makes a good storyline with the LA rivalry with the Lakers now. If they knock down LA in the WCF and win the NBA championship this year, there will be a new sheriff in town and his name is Kawhi Leonard.  The Phoenix Suns. This is a team that no one is talking about or even paying attention to right now. They are stacked with young talents and is bring led by a young superstar in Devin Booker and the under-appreciated star player in Kelly Oubre. They play hard night in and night out and nobody expects them to win or even make the playoffs. They will be fun to watch in the next few years.  The Minnesota Timberwolves, if they get D’angelo Russell to team up with Karl-Anthony Towns. There will be a new super team in the West.  The Brooklyn Nets. They will take over the city and become the new mecca of NY. They are likely to reach the ECF with a healthy Kevin Durant and a magician in Kyrie Irving.  The Golden State Warriors. No need to say more - Stephen Curry."
"You call my team “top 10 worst franchise in the league” yet your team is receding faster than Benjamin Button. You botched an MVP season of Paul George, Westbrook and Kevin Durant while also trading Harden away for Peanuts. So next time you label a team with “worst franchise in the league” I’d suggest taking your 2012 bandwagon OKC fan ass back in time a bit to see who’s really the worst franchise in the league"
What if Kevin Durant is available?
Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson.

"I haven’t bet since I lost $5000 with a bookie when bitch ass Kevin Durant started getting hurt at the beginning of the series and then broke his whole shit on Game 4 last year. God I hate that fucking dude. I hate the Warriors too, but come on, it was the fucking Raptors, I thought that bet was a sure thing."
Because of Kevin fuckin Durant   Teasing aside dame is a fuckin MONSTER
You mean when he played with Paul George?  Or when he played with Kevin Durant?
"Hassan ""Kevin Durant"" Whiteside"
"Brought back all the tears and emotion. This is gunna take a long time to process.   Love you all my nba fam, even when you support the ridiculous flat earth theory or try to argue that Kevin Durant isn’t a pathetic snake."
Kevin Durant ratio per 36 years
Great way to honor Kobe and Kevin Durant
"And it was funny because Trae was one of the few people to agree with Booker on the double teaming in pickup games comment. He made multiple Twitter posts talking about how he agrees that he hates when people do that and thinks its cheesy. But the media didn't go apeshit on him for 2 weeks. Most outlets barely even mentioned it if at all. Kevin Durant agreed with Book as well and got no media backlash. But yet Book got 2 weeks straight of everyone just shit talking him lmao.   I don't know who's wife he fucked, but the sex better have been good. Cause something just isn't right about this bias. It's crazy. Maybe the league is just mad that he re-signed with the Suns cause they hate Sarver and wanted him to go to a big market team where they could milk more money out of him. Who the fuck knows lmao."
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Stephen Curry 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Paul George 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Damian Lillard 11. Joel Embiid 12. Klay Thompson 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Chris Paul 15. Luka Doncic
Because of Kevin fucking Durant. Also David West (at way lower volume). But seriously if you are a legendary mid-range shooter you become the automatic third option when you can't penetrate or get an open 3.
"Looks like the text in the original post is removed, but here is a recent thread with the story  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/euohq1/my_favorite_story_about_kobes_work_ethic/  &gt; I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, and as we know they would eventually bring home the Gold (USA). I’ve had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. We first met three days before the first scrimmage, on the day of the first practice, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time. &gt;  &gt; The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched “Casablanca” for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up. &gt;  &gt; “Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I’m not disturbing anything right?” &gt;  &gt; “Uhh no, what’s up Kob?” &gt;  &gt; “Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that’s all.” &gt;  &gt; I checked my clock. 4:15 AM. &gt;  &gt; “Yeah sure, I’ll see you in the facility in a bit.” &gt;  &gt; It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn’t even 5AM. &gt;  &gt; We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow. &gt;  &gt; I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility. &gt;  &gt; This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went – I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, “Good work this morning.” &gt;  &gt; “Huh?” &gt;  &gt; “Like, the conditioning. Good work.” &gt;  &gt; “Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.” &gt;  &gt; “So when did you finish?” &gt;  &gt; “Finish what?” &gt;  &gt; “Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?” &gt;  &gt; “Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.” &gt;  &gt; My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God. It was then that I realized that there’s no surprise to why he’s been as effective as he was last season. Every story about his dedication, every quote that he’s said about hard work all came together and hit me like a train. It’s no surprise to me now that he’s dunking on players ten years younger than him and it wasn’t a surprise to me earlier this year when he led the league in scoring."
"I live in the LA area and the comparisons these two players got are ridiculous.      Lonzo Ball= Jason Kidd      D'angelo= Magic Johnson Levels of Vision with a Steph-light shooting ability      Ingram= Kevin Durant     I don't like D'Angelo but to be fair his draft was not great and KAT doesn't count because he was drafted higher. Obviously, Porzingis and Booker were taken lower but neither are glaring ""WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE THEM!?"" mistakes.      Ball had a strong resume but there were obvious signs that there were glaring weaknesses in his game. He was absolutely hyped into the 2nd spot by his connections to LA and his dad. If emotion was taken out of the question, Fox would've been drafted in this position. Tatum and Mitchell are obvious standouts but Mitchell was slept on by much of the league and they wanted a PG so Tatum didn't fit that mold.      Some people argued Ingram should've been number 1. Simmons was always my number 1 and I strongly believe he is still better than Ingram. Lakers didn't have the number 1 pick so the comparison is void. Extremely weak draft class so hard to fault the pick.         Unfortunately for the Lakers, 2 of the drafts had HOF potential players picked at the number 1 spot and quite the gap at number 2. Still, all things considered I don't think a single one of these players live up to number 2 pick expectations but as products of weaker/extremely weak drafts they have to be cut some slack."
You gotta go into your local outlet store and sift through the XXL Kevin Durant Warriors jerseys and look under the XXS basketball shorts and you might find a cheap shirt you like in your size.
Kevin Durant demands a trade to the Sacramento Kings
Kevin Durant? I cant think of many 7s
Kevin Durant
"&gt; he had a bad 3 game stretch so that means he always chokes  he also performed badly against the Thunder. It was Klay that won them that series.  It says a lot that Curry only beat the Cavs because they had no Kyrie or Kevin Love. Curry needed Durant to bail them out because he had no killer instinct.  Let me give you an example of what I mean by ""killer instinct.""  [In the 1998 NBA Finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=530z-_yjdlU), a player named Michael Jordan was down by 3 points with 41 seconds to go after John Stockton hits a clutch 3. Remind you of another game?  Anyway, that guy named Michael Jordan IMMEDIATELY went for 2 and brought the Bulls within 1 point with 35 seconds to go, immediately putting the pressure on the Jazz to score again. The Jazz took it down the court, but using strategy and brilliance, MJ blindsides Karl Malone (an MVP player and HOFer) and steals it from him.  With 5 seconds to go, MJ hits the most iconic shot in NBA history. The Bulls win by 1, going 6-0 in the Finals and securing his GOAT status.  Compare this to game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. With 73-9 on the line, Steph has a chance to make history.  However, with 52 seconds to go, [Kyrie Irving hits a clutch 3 to take a 3 point lead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgVOgGLtPtc)  Now is the time for Curry to show us what he is made of. This is the EXACT same situation Michael Jordan was in almost down to the exact time. Hell, Curry **even has homecourt advantage while MJ was in SLC (which is known to be super hostile to opposing teams).** However, instead of making clutch shots and plays, what happens? Kevin Love EASILY stops him. Then he throws up wild threes that miss so badly it's almost a joke. The Warriors are forced to foul but even though Lebron misses a free throw, he pretty much seals in the deal and curry blows 73-9 and history. Edit: oh yeah and MJ did this in a game 6. He could've lost the game and still be in the hunt for a title. However, he wanted it to end right then and there so he ended it. Curry was in a game 7 so he should've had 10 times the urgency but he blew it and blew it badly.  Let's be real, the second Kyrie made that three you knew it was over. You knew Steph didn't have what it takes to TRULY be a GOAT. He's just too soft and doesn't have that killer instinct factor that players like Larry, Michael, Kobe, etc. etc. have.  See what I mean now?"
I would agree if refs had a track record of being good at officiating but they have shown themselves to be massively incompetent too many times  - Kevin Durant out of bounds no call. James Harden literally saved the refs ass in that game  - Lebron James blatent carry no call  - Denying blatant correct challenge calls by coaches  These are just a few recent notable instances.
Kevin Durant on the warriors
"Chip or no chip, they're obviously not the GOAT team if the same team swapped Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant a year later.  *That's* the GOAT team, especially if we judge the best based on the number /r/NBA's complaints of unfairness."
"Never ""killed"" the Warriors? LMFAO my man, the Cavs won a title by repeatedly isolating Bron/Kyrie on Curry. hahaha you have to be a troll. Not to mention Kyrie literally hit the three to seal a 3-1 comeback in the NBA finals in Curry's face.      Also, idk how many Atl games you watch, but Trae tries. Only difference is he doesn't have two time DPOY Draymond Green, all-nba defensive team Klay Thompson, and 7'1"" Kevin Durant on his team as well."
"They traded Tobias Harris for Brandon Jennings and ersan ilyasova. They then traded dipo, sabonis, and ilyasova for ibaka. Then traded ibaka for Ross.  BKN took a chance and signed kyrie Irving to also get Kevin Durant. That’s a good move. Someone who doesn’t do that is stupid."
"i was born in split, yugoslavia, and grew up on an island of brač, some 3 nautical miles off of split coast. toni was a religion to me when i was a kid. jugoplastika teams back in the day played a modern kind of basketball, uptempo, lots of shooting, lots of transition, pass first, look for the best shot. toni was like a god. with his long legs, pure stroke and amazing court awareness and passing ability he was the best thing europe had to offer. think young kevin durant mixed with luka dončić. a little less swagger, a little more team play. that was toni.  some would argue that petrović or sabonis were better, and those arguments have some weight, but toni had a unique ability - he could adapt his game on the fly. whatever it takes to win. dražen could only play one way - his way - he was single-minded like kobe was. sabonis was a force of nature and intelligence, but he was prone to mental lapses and hot-headedness. toni's biggest flaw is that he was able to play second fiddle if needed. which wasn't a flaw, really.  usa spectators never saw the real kukoč. he was forced to play out of position, in a strange ill-suited system, and he was forced to put on 30 pounds of weight so he could play power forward. that slowed him down, and finally caused great back problems that ruined the later part of his career. it's a shame. if he came into the league 10 years later he would be spoken in the same breath as nowitzki. but then again he wouldn't be a part of one of the greatest teams of all time. and that team wouldn't be one of the greatest teams of all time without him."
"&gt; Westbrook proving to the world he'd be a sensational 2nd option now with rockets.  He didn't have to prove that, he played with Kevin Durant"
"Nice try, Kevin Durant"
Because kerr and the warriors weren’t stubborn enough to stray from it if it wasn’t working. Rockets did a great job defensively in that series switching everything and the warriors relied on a lot of kevin durant working from 15 feet. harden could have easily stepped 10 feet closer for a quarter and a half instead of just forcing triples. a few of them should have been fouls but it’s embarrassing to be that stuck in your ways in a do or die game
"The Nets have never had transcendent stars like this. Kevin Durant, not to sound cliche, is box office. A guy casual fans all over will pay to see. If the Nets achieve some playoff success it might be the first time they actually take a chunk of the pie."
"Russ was *carried to a Finals appearance by Kevin Durant, and Dame's other son was there too but he didn't show up in the Finals"
"Is this a joke? I can name more than 10 without even thinking about it.  In no order  Lebron  Kawhi  Giannis  AD  Paul George  Harden  Embiid  Jokic  Doncic  Steph Curry  Kevin Durant  Klay Thompson  Dame  Jimmy Butler  Russ  Gobert  Kyrie  Siakem  Mitchell  KAT falls in right around here with guys like Booker, Aldridge, Simmons, Middleton, Kemba."
"Nobody is scoring 30k points in 9 years though lol.  If you push it an extra year to make it a clean decade, including the year he played on a bum knee for 40 games, he scored 17,641 points over 10 years. The only players who scored more over those 10 years were LeBron (21,084) and Kobe (18,448). 4th was Dirk (17,013). Durant started in 2008 so he was behind for no fault of his own obviously but we're talking about a specific player.  To say he hasn't been as consistent a scorer as people seem to think is just wrong. Anyone who scores the 3rd most points in the league for the decade of their prime is going to be a pretty damn consistent scorer. Those other 3 guys around him are in the 30k club but when you're talking that high the factor of luck comes into play when talking about durability.  Kobe averaged 26.8 PPG the four years previous to blowing out his achilles and didn't show any signs of slowing down. He was scoring the most PPG for a player ever in the 17th year of their career when it happened. If he doesn't blow out his achilles he may have passed Kareem. If he blows it out years earlier maybe he doesn't even hit 30k.  Dirk only averaged 26 PPG in a season twice, but give him it three times since he hit 25.9 one year. Melo averaged 26.3 PPG over 9 years. The best 9 year scoring stretch of Dirk's career, from 2001-02 to 2009-10, he averaged 24.7 PPG with high of 26.6 in 05-06. The following and last 9 years of Dirk's career he averaged 17.4 PPG. We're just fortunate that Dirk didn't suffer a major injury and we got to see his career play out fully.  Back to the point about Kobe, look at Kevin Durant. Blowing out his achilles and being 31 already, is he going to be able to get to 30k now? He's at 22,940 and at this point it would be certainly be more surprising if he was able to get there when before it looked like a lock. That really sucks for the game.  Melo was in line to cruise to 30k before his knee injury cut the tail off his prime. He can still get there but it's going to be an uphill battle and would likely need to come with him playing until he's close to 40 and having one of those 7-10 PPG years at the end lol."

"haha exactly. ""man, i was going to go out there today like i normally do and play half-assed, but this new revelation from Kevin Durant just BLOWS MY MIND! I HAVE A NEW FOUND ENERGY!"""
"It's not like the Premier League. The NBA plays 82 games in the regular season. The top sixteen teams (eight from the Eastern Conference and eight from the Western Conference) then advance to the playoffs, which is tournament format, until a winner is crowned. Each round of the playoffs is a series of games, not just a one-and-done thing. There is no promotion or relegation, although I've always liked that about football.   Look up videos on YouTube. The history of the game and the NBA is extremely fascinating and engaging. There are loads of players and teams you should look up. Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Dr J., Larry Bird, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Allen Iverson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan (widely regarded as the best ever), and of course Kobe Bryant. The most historic rivalry is probably between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers."
I have no control over Kevin Durant. I’m not preventing him from doing anything. Just stating my observation
"Great breakdown overall, especially on defensive tendencies to play a guy like him.  He's a bit off in diagnosing feet being pointed away from the basket as a lefty only phenomenon. Plenty of right handed shooters do so, see Kevin Durant for example"
Dlo and and the pick for Kevin Durant
I might’ve posted on it last week only non Bigs to have a season they did it this century on at least 75 shots at the rim were Andre Iguodala Kevin Durant Francisco Garcia Brent Barry and like two other under the radar names I’m forgetting
Thank you Kevin Durant
"yeah I have that poster in my room, crazy how every player on there was in a different jersey after except Kobe  edit: it had Kobe, Bron, Carmelo, Rose, D-Will, Paul Pierce, Kevin Durant, and Chris Paul"
Not if Kevin Durant and Thunder can stop them.
"Dude this is phenomenal. As a Lakers fan, I’m so upset with myself I never got to watch Kobe in the flesh. The fact that you also witnessed Kevin Durant in his rookie year is amazing. Thanks for sharing.   Side note- do you still happen to have that ticket? I’d try to do something cool like frame it with a picture from that game or something like that, just a thought!"
Russ will leave once his contract expires. He can't handle being second fiddle to Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant will go on to join a 73-9 team later on
If Kevin Durant ever leaves OKC I’ll eat my hat
I just have a feeling that Kevin Durant will go to the Warriors... don't know why
"God I fucking love having Kevin Durant on my team. That dude *IS* OKC! Loyalty exists in the NBA, and he's bringing us a chippppp!!!!"
Can you imagine if Kevin Durant joins the warriors?
"Steph and Klay also had Draymond beasting and feasting.     If you give me two of those to start a team, I start with the better pair, both are better playmakers than Curry, both are elite scorers, CP3 is an elite defender.  &amp;#x200B;  Harden/CP3 played together for two years and caused issues to GSW WITH Kevin Durant and Draymond. It should be a no brainer if we're considering prime CP3 in there in my opinion"
Kevin Durant.  Best three-level isolation scorer of all-time.
"I’ve watched prime James harden and here’s what I’ve seen:    Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019 Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable"

Kevin Durant by far
"I can confirm, that this team did exists and I know several guys who ran into this team first hand.  The wildcard in this was VC because he was a Florida guy.  But AAU was the wild west back then completely ran by the shoe companies and college coaches.  There was maybe 2 big events and each shoe company didn't have its own circuit, it was essentially just a sponsor deal for bags+shoes+hotels.  Tim Thomas is easily one of the most physically gifted players ever to play in the NBA. You only saw his real talent in contract years, and he would secure big deals.  He was Kevin Durant before KD, but just lacked the motivation.  Basically imagine, there was a big event, and the talent was loaded in the event. Coaches would only see these guys at ABCD, Five-Star, and All-American Camp for maybe 3 weeks over the summer broken up into teams of 7-8 each week.  Well imagine, Nike had their Philly/NJ Team, Adidas had their Philly/NJ team and the brackets were announced and they were setup on a collision course.  Well Coach K, Dean Smith, John Thompson, Lon Kruger, Bobby Knight want to see a good show the shoe companies could call in random guy from another team from another part of the country.  This was in the early days of the mass internet, so all these guys mentioned existed in grainy video clips passed in emails, or simply word of mouths in message boards.  You didn't know their names. Guys getting borrowed for AAU teams now maybe doesn't happen or its not a big deal.  AAU in the mid-90s was like super-advanced open gyms. Where only the best got invited.  Now every HS has a AAU team, but back then there was maybe 1-2 AAU teams for a whole county, and Nike/Adidas maybe had one elite team they sponsored in each state (Except the big ones like NY, Cali, TX, FL, and IL could have 2-3).  I remember when I heard of JJ Reddick when I was a sophmore in HS a had a buddy come back from 5-Star, and he kept talking about this White Kid from Virginia who was draining 3s and didn't miss a shot all week.  When you consider the other guys there were some serious future college basketball stars and NBA players. Its insane.  I had a guy I knew who was at Nike All-American Camp, and Melo was there. They just said there was this kid from Baltimore, but he was headed to some prep school in Virginia (Oak Hill).  Guys had went to Oak Hill previously, but it was kinda a thing that Maybe NC or VA guys did. Melo going down there from B-More was unheard of. Again, no one knew his name, because these guys just existed in small news clips on the internet and messageboard gossip."
"The Zach Randolph one is over the top. The rest I've seen so many times from different people about different people from harden, to Blake Griffin,  to Kevin Durant. That happens in fandom.  You dodged my question though, btw. Anyways I don't feel like continuing thinking about this. Just hope you understand your comment just inflamed the situation rather than serve any constructive purpose."
"I used to not believe in karma, and this sucks so much, but last night my mom was ranting during the Lakers game. She hates Kevin Durant and was going off because I was trash talking Lebron, and his recent injury issues the last few seasons  She ultimately wished ill will on KD, saying she hopes his career is over and that he never regains form and I jokingly warned her that something will happen to the Lakers instead ---- I have never felt so conflicted about being ironically prophetic"

"Michael Jordan has more 50+ point games in his 179 game playoff career than Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Domnique Wilkins, Wilt Chamberlain, James Harden combined in 1,286 playoff games"
"Conveniently left out Kevin Durant, eh?"
This dude really let 64 year old Richard Jefferson defend Kevin Wayne Durant in an NBA Finals game   He need his ass whooped for that
"Lmao...  Because it was 2 years ago, genius. He has been out all season with a torn ACL. You know Steph Curry and Kevin Durant have been hurt all year too..."
"Not even,  I am legit getting a Kyle Singler OKC poster should get it soon. Man was better than Kevin Durant, issue is Billy Donovan made him sit on the bench, when Kyle hit a three the whole arena acted like we actually won a championship everyone went crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  In all seriousness Patrick Patterson was worse for the team. The difference was when Singler was on the floor it wasn't expected for him to hit a 3, if he hit one the momentum shifts. With Patterson when we signed him he was considered our best free agent sign since the team relocated, he was expected to hit shots. He was expected to help the team. What did he do? Miss shot after shot, he sucks! And after he clanked the side of the backboard a few times and he made one it wasn't even excitement, it was more of like ""Jesus Christ he finally made one."" not even the broadcasters could hype him up. On terms of what he actually gave the team, he definitely is on Kyle Singler level.  &amp;#x200B;  Also keep in mind Donovan actually had options and could've given Burton minutes you know the 6'4"" 250lb guy who does 360 dunks in games, but instead he never got any meaningful minutes despite showing flashes for Patterson who never once showed he was a decent player for us. Absolute sh\*tshow. It also begs the question what the hell Donovan was thinking, he's been doing great this year, but anyone who says he shouldn't have been fired is blatantly lying.    &amp;#x200B;  Also Muscala is NBA role player caliber, he's been pretty good for us this week."
I guess Kevin Durant shooting 33% in Game 6 and Westbrook shooting 33% in Game 7 had nothing to do with it then.
"Not for me, cause I don't think that having Kevin Durant on the sidelines and Kyrie Irving on the court is as much of an improvement itself as some say (in preseason threads, people were outraged if somebody estimated them 45 or less wins and lower than 6th seed). They're 5-11 with Kyrie playing, by my count... his return didn't exactly seem to help.   I imagine they make the playoffs, cause they're still far ahead and there's no one good below them. Then Kyrie can rehearse again his basketball-as-art playoff series he had against the Bucks."
"well, what do you expect? kevin durant is out?"
"Raptors DID beat a healthy Klay Thompson 3 games. Kevin Durant is the only game changer, but let's not act like Raptors were at 100%. Lowry had a broken finger and Kawhi killed himself in the 76er series."

But the Warriors move was too much. Great player, an even better human being but it sucked hate watching the NBA for 3 seasons. I hate you Kevin Durant."
Hollywood Irving and Big Sexy Kevin Durant
Man got sick of Kyrie.   Imagine walking away from a chance at coaching Kevin fucking Durant because of Kyrie’s toxicity. That’s how bad it was. I don’t blame the dude one bit
"Seems like a pretty benign disagreement tbh. He thought it was about effort while Kerr thought it was about attitude. And yes Kerr agreed with KD:  &gt; “I wasn’t at all offended what Kevin said because it’s basically the truth,” Kerr said. “You look at any system, I mean, I played the triangle with Michael Jordan. The offense ran a lot smoother all regular season and the first couple rounds of the playoffs than it did in the conference finals and Finals. It just did.”  &gt; Kerr continued: “That’s why guys like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant are who they are. They can transcend any defense. But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over. No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact…  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-right-warriors-did-play-more-iso-against-best-defenses/  Not trying to come off as a Durant apologist 'cause pretty clear he and Kerr did not have a seamless relationship, but it also did not seem notably explosive or toxic? Both cases just seems like him giving honest answers rather than trying to undermine Kerr every chance he got. Durant did the same thing to Kyrie in pre-season when Kyrie said he wanted to make sure Durant doesn't return from injury too soon."
"Kevin ""can't win with these cats"" Durant?  Yeah idk about that one."

"Nets fans sound like Celtics fans last year or Cavs fans near his end there. Weird decisions start happening with the team, leaks start to go to the media and Kyrie pops off during interviews but it never had anything to do with Kyrie. Good thing he's paired up with Kevin Durant the guy who never gets shook by something a teammate might say to him."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant also told you SAS doesn’t know shit about anything
Because he's Kevin Durant. Of course you're going to take advantage of his ability to score in isolation.
Kevin “LeGM James” Durant
"He doesn’t. He hires the people who do it. We hate him because he’s consistently failed to produce a good team. But if we had Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, and they told Dolan to dump the coach, he better fucking do it."
Some players named Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. They're going to replace him with Kyrie's uncle Jersey Joe.
Kevin Durant Special probably dislikes the dude
Kyrie Irving + Kevin Durant = ?
"It's hard to pick names out of thin air, hopefully your GM has a constant list of prospects going that he is ready to move on. The point is that the NBA is not a coaches league. Philosophically I am opposed to this ""Brad's System"" mindset where we turn away superstars so we can pretend we have ball movement with lesser players that will behave more like choir boys.  Last season was a disaster from the get go. The Tatum/Brown/Hayward trio was playing like shit, Rozier was actively sabatoging the team coming off the bench and Brad Stevens wouldn't do a damn thing about it. I knew right then and there he didn't have the backbone to be a champion.   In December Danny Ainge should have gotten rid of Brown and Rozier to ease the chaos of the season and evaluated his coach VERY CLOSELY for the remainder of the season. After the season if he didn't have his own guy in mind, I would have liked him to give a call to his old friend Kevin McHale to come be a people manager of hopefully a team that looked something like: Irving Smart Durant Tatum Horford Baynes Morris."

"It’s Kevin Durant, an all time great and probably the best player in the game today if he can get anywhere close to what he was. Kyrie is also a hell of a lot better than people give him credit for. If you have a chance to pick up those two guys you take it. If Durant is even 80% of what he was they will rip through the east."
"Kevin Durant poisoned our water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"
"Kevin Durant can change his mind believe or not.   Just like people said Steph was the best player on the Warriors, then KD joined. All those people changed their minds too."
Kevin Durant before he joined the warriors: 'that's how I want to play basketball'  Kevin Durant after leaving: 'ISO is better'
Ethan Strauss. Don't have an Athletic sub anymore so I can't cut and paste the relevant article... it's cited here: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2844032-stephen-a-kevin-durant-didnt-have-the-greatest-relationship-with-steve-kerr
"The Nets threw away Russell, Atkinson, and the 2019-20 season for the possibility that a 32-year-old Kevin Durant coming off an Achilles injury and an injury-prone Kylie Irving will be enough to compete. Are we sure Tsai is thinking about winning games with great players than merely winning over international fans with post-prime but marketable stars?"
"I mean take pippen away and Jordan has 0 accomplishments and when he was on the wizards was barely just trying to make the playoffs.  Lebron in the tough west was on pace to make the playoffs with more wear and tear than Jordan on the wizards. Both had 0 help.  When Jordan first retired, pippen was 3rd in all star voting that year and was a top 5 player in the league. They took the Knicks who went to the finals that year to 7 games. The Knicks took the rockets to 7 games in the finals.  What team could lebron just up and leave, that could take a finals contender to 7 games ?  Kyrie and love weren’t going to do that for sure. Bosh and wade had their chance and were an 8 seed and put the first round.  Bron has gotten to the finals with iguaskas and delonte west. He’s also taken a legendary team to 6 games in the finals with deladova as his best player He’s also taken jr Smith and tristian Thompson to the finals.  Jordan ? What’s he done without pippen? Absolutely nothing and is 1-9 in the playoffs (with Charles Oakley, who is better than anyone I just named above). At least my goat has won with kyrie, he’s also won with a declining wade. He’s also taken garbage to the finals. Jordan ? He has 0 accomplishments and pippen defines his career cuz he didn’t do shit without him. Also Jordan never faced a team like gsw, he struggled against Reggie Miller. No disrespect to Miller but Klay, curry are both better shooters, than you add a DPOY like draymond green and then add a lockdown defender like iggy, and Jordan ain’t beating Reggie Miller. Oh yeah I haven’t even added Kevin Durant 🤣🤣  Pippen Rodman Kerr Paxton kukoc we’re not garbage and way better than iguaskas, deladova, tristian Thompson or jr Smith."
The period from LeBrons move to Miami to the signing of Kevin Durant to the Warriors is my peak era. And I was around for both Bulls 3-peats(fuck MJ)
"Yep 34 year old Drexler coming off a back injury, 33 year old Barkley and Hakeem is comparable to 27 year old Kevin Durant in the apex of his career joining the team with the best record in NBA history, with a two time unanimous MVP, and two other all stars, all in their primes. Yep, real smart comparison there buddy.   Barkley’s prime was literally about nine years before the season where they created that “superteam”.   Delusional SuperSonics fan man smh. What can I say man. It’s just that Seattle intelligence level."
MJ also never played against a Kevin Durant. Clyde Drexler was his closest comparison and he’s not in the same stratosphere as KD.
Aron Baynes has now made more threes in a game than Kevin Durant.
"[Found the article](https://thesmokingcuban.com/2017/10/24/dirk-nowitzki-is-not-just-another-legend-to-kevin-durant/).   &amp;nbsp;  Dirk Nowitzki is Not Just Another Legend to Kevin Durant  &gt; “I can remember I was 12 years old and the Mavs were playing. They had the green jerseys on. I forgot who they was playing. It was the first time I was really really starting to lock in and pay attention to Dirk I was 12. Make him sound old,” Durant said jokingly as we talked about Dirk on Monday morning.  &gt; **“Dirk is a little bit more special to me when it comes to players I admire and look up to compared to some other guys that retired,” Durant said. “It was just this myth around being a seven-foot shooter. In my neighborhood you heard about being that tall and being a shooter, they was like hell nah we have never seen anything like that before.”**  &gt; “One of my friends was like, the Diggler got 28 in the first half. I was like shit, that is a lot of points. I watched it back. One leggers, pull-up jump shots, threes, pump fake, one dribble pull-ups. All the fundamentals. I was like, that’s who I want to try and be like,” Durant said."

"Because Kawhi Leonard wasn't even the best player in the finals, Curry was. Not to mention, Kevin Durant was injured and was another player who's probably better. And don't forget about LeBron. Giannis will only be crowned the best player if he wins, no one is saying he's the best player in the world, they're only saying it during the regular season."
"Draymond is an idiot! He is butt hurt because Barkley criticizes him.  Barkley is 100% correct, draymond is a front runner who has no impact unless he is playing with multiple all stars on his team.  Otherwise, he has absolutely no impact, positive or negative, for his team! His petty attitude is what cost them Kevin Durant, if he learned how to shut the fuck up and be humble for once, he might be inline for more championships"
"So did Dirk. And Tim Duncan. And Dwyane Wade. Yeah Kevin Durant dipped but they’re very clearly different kinds of people, it’s certainly not impossible he leaves by any stretch but this “oh one totally unrelated guy did it so that means it’s more likely now” logic is stupid."

Didn't look for viewership, but wouldn't be surprised if it was split, and not LeBron just leading."
"yea, the Shawn Kemp that took your franchise to 6 straight playoff appearance including facing off against Michael Jordan in the finals....  that Shawn Kemp was definitely better for your franchise  than the 19 year old Kevin Durant that gave y'all 2 30 win seasons  most definitely.  serious question: how old are you?"
"Why is this even a question lol? Where are you going with this   Chuck was one of the 20-25 greatest players of all time and he was a force on the basketball court who could be the superstar and focal point to a title team. Draymond is one of the greatest defensive players of his era, one of the best passing forwards of his generation and one of the smartest players of his generation but his game is really only suited for teams that already have scoring talent besides him.    They are both great players, Chuck is obviously much better though and he is one of the best basketball players in history.    Draymond and Chuck are not players you compare. Draymond should be compared with other utility players like Rodman, AK47, Cooper, etc and Chuck should be compared with the Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, James Hardens type players"
"The team didn’t get shump into rap or melo into investments. What evidence do you have they weren’t into that stuff independent of playing for the knicks. Damian Lillard is into rapping. Kevin Durant is into investing.   “He looks like he doesn’t want to be there” please explain what this looks like. I can be smiling and cheery at work and not want to be here. Some people have resting bitch face even when extremely satisfied with life.   Going 100% all the time...would you prefer he recklessly drives and spins and turns it over like randle every possession, giving it 100% effort (or what looks like effort to spectators)?   Plenty of players try hard and just have smoother movements so it looks like they don’t try hard."
Ingram and Kevin Durant
"If Kevin Durant wasn't Injured this season and still played like be does until like 37-38 he probably could have, but I remember reading that he wants to retire at 35. Unless LeBron has a catastrophic injury or declines like crazy he can pass Kareem averaging just 20ppg playing 70 games until the end of his career which he wants to be when his son joins the NBA (basically until he's 40) and thats a conservative estimate"
"I always get shit for this, but Khris Middleton and Kevin Durant have extremely similar play styles.  Durant obviously has been leagues better over his career, but their shot profiles and tendencies are very similar (despite the height difference)."
Kevin Durant and Patrick McCaw.  Still have no idea what happened with McCaw.
Kevin Durant has never won DPOY or two MVPs.
"Nobody here said he's AD. They said he's a legit number 2 and he is. Dude showed against the Wizards that he's able to carry the team when Giannis isn't playing well by dropping 51. The guy is literally about to join a list of players that includes only Steph Curry, Dirk Nowitzki, Larry Bird and Kevin Durant as a player that's scored 20+ while averaging 50/40/90.   &amp;#x200B;  Those are LEGIT number 2 stats."
All that is fine. I don't think players really care/take him seriously on first take. Kevin Durant had him on his boardroom show after SAS was everywhere saying he is coming to the Knicks. Even went on to say there's a 95% chance he signs with Knicks.
"Athleticism and shooting were never primary reasons for Draymond’s impact.   After 15-16 GSW added another primary scorer/playmaker/help defender in Kevin Durant. Addition of KD affected Steph and Klay’s touches but also affected Draymond’s role as the primary facilitator   Finally a season without KD and now he’s been playing for the first time in his career without the splash brothers.   Yes he’s older, probably a little slower. But he is +30 awareness +30 hustle sometimes even +15 Open Three Pointer when splash brothers are on the floor. His voice, communication, energy, leadership, edge on defense alone makes him more important than Wiggins."
"People willfully misinterpret the phrase ""The Hardest Road"" because they dislike him.  He was talking about how it was hard to decide to relocate, leave where he had been living and being in the NBA, uproot his family, he was just using a common turn of phrase to talk about the personal effects of the decision.  I'm not saying there isn't reason to dislike him but people harp on that phrase and it just seems silly to me; just talk about the things he did you didn't like, you know?  Like ""I didn't like that he went to the team he lost to in the playoffs when they were already stacked.""  But acting like he was pretending or meant or even suggested that it was harder to win a championship on the Warriors than elsewhere...that's so clearly not what he meant.  Also I love all the armchair analysts talking about how *easy* even his path to rings was, as if the work to get into the NBA, the training and practice, the effort to *be Kevin Durant* and play at that level is somehow in any way *easy*, as if just because he didn't stick with a team that had a harder path to the Finals means being a top tier NBA player and helping a team win championships (and it's not like he didn't contribute big time) is easy and not a lot of hard work.  But again, his ""Hardest Road"" comment in the article announcing his move had nothing to do with that, it was about his personal life."
"&gt; “The rehab process can be monotonous, and it can be overwhelming on a day-to-day basis when you’re doing the same thing over and over and over again,” Curry said. “That’s where being around the guys kind of gives you a jolt—even if you’re not playing. You rely on that.”  &gt; He needed that jolt, and to know what his future holds. Aside from a few 10-day contracts and two-way prospects, every other Warriors player is signed with the team for next season. Most have little idea of how to actually play with Curry, beyond the intuitive. When Juan Toscano-Anderson scooped up an offensive rebound, he didn’t know to look for Curry relocating to the corner for an open jumper. How could he? A similar dynamic exists for Curry, in a different way and on a different scale. Even when Green returns to the lineup (and Klay Thompson returns next season), the Warriors will have fewer connectors than Curry is accustomed to. In the past, Curry could give up the ball early knowing that keen facilitators would get it where it needed to go. He could trust in Green, Andre Iguodala, and Kevin Durant, and at a time, in Shaun Livingston, Andrew Bogut, and David West.  &gt; For as eager as the Warriors were to move the ball on Thursday, enthusiasm is no real substitute for experience. The game has revealed itself enough for Eric Paschall to rack up eight assists, but has he really internalized his reads to the point he could make them under playoff pressure? Damion Lee clearly has some game, but will he recognize the swing pass that gives the Warriors the go-ahead look they need in a tight fourth quarter? Wiggins is among the more proven commodities on the roster, and yet there’s so much we still don’t know about how his skill set and Curry’s will interact beyond their drive-and-kick connections. These are the variables Curry has largely been able to take for granted on more veteran teams. No more. Golden State is now a developmental enterprise. It’s not so much a question as to whether Steph can still be effective in that setting, but more how he goes about acclimating to an entirely different way of life."
*What's Giannis's excuse for not making it with the extra year and the weaker conference?*  ... the fact that he isn't playing alongside Kevin Durant?
"Paschall yelled, “There you go!” Wiggins gave a look of pleasant surprise. Draymond belted, “We got an \[expletive\] squad now.” And before Steph hit the locker room door, ex-Warrior  Kevin Durant hugged him &amp; said, “Y’all look so different.”"
Tbf he's really good but he's not Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant/LeBron James/Kobe Bryant/Michael Jordan-great.
"Are you telling me that European Soccer reject is a hardworker? HAHAHAHA, no wonder why Americans suck at real sports lik Soccer and Rugby if you consider a guy like Giannis a hardworker.  That guy is a bum, a quitter, he is a 10th tier European athlete. He is shit.  Steph Curry is 6'3'' tall and Kevin Durant is 7 foot tall. They are tall dudes."
&gt;Injuries with long recovery timetables in general would do that. Kevin Durant probably won't play a single NBA game for 16 months.  So Kawhi ruptured his achilles? Is that what you are saying?  &gt; In specific: he sustained the injuries he got in the rockets series and the Zaza special didn't help. You can look up the actual details of Kawhi's injuries he got in game 1 of the 2018 NBA Western Conference Finals and I believe game 5 of the 2018 NBA Weatern Conference Semifinals series between the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs   I can't find anything severe enough to draw comparisons to a ruptured achilles. Can you?
&gt;the Brooklyn Nets fall apart because Kyrie Irving finds out Kevin Durant puts both mustard and ketchup on his hot dogs.  This is gold 😂. Wish I could give you a medal.

"Lebron will still be great at what he does (u dont lose court vision as u age). Could see him still playing well offensively due to his passing skills.  Im not sure how much curry has left in the tank due to his injuries. Really hope he will have a long carreer but i think in 5 years he will play his last season. When he plays, still good on the offensive, terrible defense.  Kevin Durant is gonna turn into last season with knicks melo. Still wants to be the man but just isnt efficient anymore and too proud to give up his starter status.  Leonard will be very similar to his play now, hes only 28 now. Maybe a bit worse on the drive, but a better passer.  Hardens game will age pretty well imo. Will still be able to give u 28 a night on decent efficiency, just not the absolute monster anymore that hes now"
This is the kind of playoff basketball nets fans can expect out of Kevin durant.     All time great stuff here folks
"LeBron: Lower end All-Star, can still turn it up from time to time. Could have a season like CP3 this year  Steph: Elite roleplayer/floorspacer, just a bit too bad on Defense by now  Kawhi: IF he stays healthy and somewhat durable he'll still be All-NBA  James Harden: Call me crazy but I think he'll still be Superstar or really close to that level. I feel Harden has a great old man game.  Kevin Durant: Tough decision, he'll either be out of the league or be still a really solid offensive player. KD will be 37 I think so I don't know if he'd still be able to get you that much value on defense but if he stays healthy and recovers solidly from his achilles injury he should always be a super useful offensive player."
We just forget about defense now? What is this. Lebron was 1st team all-d 5 times in a row and 2nd in 2014. Kevin Durant hasn't even sniffed that part in all his career.
1. Kawhi Leonard (All star)  2. James Harden (boderline all star)  3. Steph Curry (no longer an all star but a starter still)  4. LeBron James (last season)  5. Kevin Durant (newly retired)
Kevin Durant was an all time great player in the playoffs in his okc days contrary to stupid belief.
What Kevin Durant did in those playoff games was not no “40% of the work” lmao. Y’all overstate how much energy or effort a player with good teammates has to put into a game.
Love Kevin Durant. Always. My favorite player
"Unless we’re talking Girl Scout cookies, Al Pacino movies or Stevie Wonder albums, everything has a saturation limit, or at least it should.  Is scoring in the NBA reaching that point?  For a league that was desperate to see scoring reach the 100s when games were slow marches to 90, the rules were opened up to increase scoring, limit overly physical play and display the athletes at their best.  That has had the desired effect — almost too well.  Every team is averaging well over 100 points per game (league average 111.4), with the Charlotte Hornets bringing up the rear at a measly 102 per night — the same production as the Miami Heat back in 2010-11.  Yes, that’s the first year of the LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh partnership.  The game we’re watching nightly is so drastically different from the contests we saw even five years ago.  Remember that Stephen Curry bomb on Feb. 27, 2016, against the Oklahoma City Thunder in one of the greatest regular-season games of the decade? The 40-ish footer from barely a step inside of half-court that caught everyone off-guard, especially Anthony Roberson?  Well, LeBron James has hit shots from that zip code twice in the last week. The first was the “not yet, kid” triple Sunday that quieted the frenzied New Orleans crowd after Zion Williamson brought the house down with a dynamite dunk on a nationally televised game.  The second was a calm, walk-up triple Tuesday from the Los Angeles Lakers logo a couple nights ago.  The skill levels of the incumbent players as well as the young stars entering the league have been aided by the rules being so loose.  According to basketball-reference.com creator Justin Kubatko, February was the second month in league history in which six players — Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Trae Young, Jayson Tatum and Damian Lillard — averaged 30 points or more.  The first month that occurred?  January 2020, with Kawhi Leonard and Devin Booker joining Lillard, Westbrook, Young and Beal.  Notice the names that haven’t been mentioned? Luminaries like James, Curry, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been out most of the year, but he could wind up on that list next year, and with Durant recovering from an Achilles injury, he could return to elite status next season.  For all we know, we could be in the most golden of golden eras of scoring, with talent like Zion Williamson and Luka Doncic ready to do more damage as time goes on.  But if these explosions are so commonplace, does it diminish how special it feels, especially with defenses not having much of a chance to earn the benefit of the doubt?  Whether it’s the “gather and two steps” rule or no more hand-checking or mere evolution, it feels like we’re in a juiced-ball era that would make the slow-down coaches of the ’90s cringe.  This isn’t opining to go back there, not by a long shot.  But maybe, just maybe, we can play some games on All-Madden once in a while?  OK, old man no longer yelling at cloud.

"Kevin Durant exists! Oh so does John Wall, and Andre Roberson"
Kevin Durant once got into a DM argument with a 14 year old on Instagram cuz he called him a snake or something regarding his warriors move
"But if you took KD's word you'd think weed is a PED.  [ “It’s just like, marijuana is marijuana. It’s not harmful to anybody. It can only help and enhance and do good things.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.netsdaily.com/platform/amp/2020/2/27/21156566/kevin-durant-time-to-end-nba-ban-on-marijuana)"
Hmm.... that's an interesting question. I think it will be the following players assuming no unkown player comes in and takes the league by storm:   10. Donovan Mitchell 9. Joel Embiid 8. Nikola Jokic 7. Kevin Durant 6. Trae Young 5. Ben Simmons 4. Jayson Tatum 3. Zion Williamson 2. Luka Doncic 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant on OKC
"I think he could be a Kevin Durant lite type of player, he has the shooting and everything just needs to get the discipline"
What are you talking about?   Idk how you can sit there and say curry has choked in the finals. Or are you going to use the argument he doesn't have a finals MVP when 2 of them involved Kevin Durant lighting shit up?   Come on man at least he sensible about it.
"Is Kevin Durant just All NBA potential? Ingram is 22 putting up 25, and I'm not gonna look up his stats but he's probably shooting above 55% TS. Ingram has everything that KD has in terms of length and agility and his ability to shoot over defenders as well. Whether he materializes into KD is another story but the ceiling is just as high."
Kevin Durant leaving the most stable superstar in Curry for the least stable one in Kyrie is going to be a great storyline going forward when they all return.
Kevin Durant not liking TS% doesn’t invalidate the stat. It just means he’s an edgelord. Sorry if that upsets you lmao.  Also lol @ thinking Harden is a fake star. Learn basketball please and thank you.
"&gt;""I don't like analytics at all. I like field goal percentage defense, I like field goal percentage, I like turnovers, I like rebounds -- the real stats. The true shooting percentage and effective field goal percentage and all that stuff. Come on man. It's flawed. PER. It's flawed.  ~Kevin Durant  https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/kevin_durant_issues_a_psa_to_all_the__blog_boys__and__fanboys_/51333/  But I understand why you and the fake stars like Harden love TS."
I think things will turn around once Kevin Durant comes back next year.
"No, Kevin Durant is the best old player since Luka Doncic"
Is Luka Doncic the best young player since Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant, Janes Harden, Russell Westbrook and nobody else besides LeBron and Kawhi have ever beaten anybody by your logic"
G- Kyle Lowry  G- James Harden  F- Kevin Durant   F- Deandre Ayton   C- Serge Ibaka
"According to BBall Reference, Wilt had a 43 point 20 rebound game in the 69-70 season where he wasn’t an all star due to playing only 12 regular season games.   r/WiltDidIt  Not really in the spirit of the question based on the body of your post, but now I’m interested to try and find the best game by a player who was not an all star that season. Will update as I research I guess.  Kevin Durant in 09 had a 47 point game on 59/67/85 shooting. Only 3 rebounds, 2 assists, with zero blocks or steals hurts his case.   Actually thinking about it, Devin Booker probably easily have the best game of anybody who wasn’t an all star at the time. At least by the metrics I’m using. 70/8/6 with 3 steals and a block on 53/36/92 shooting.."
"If they make the playoffs this season they will be the youngest playoff team of the last 15 years, maybe ever (cant find any site that tracks this, so I've been working my way back year by year doing the math myself). Rookie Westbrook and sophomore Kevin Durant lead their team to a 23-49 record. Rookie Ja and sophomore Jaren have a .500 record and might make the playoffs. If anything this team has been under hyped all seaosn with most of the hype (somewhat reasonably) being drawn by Zion and the Pelicans."
1. Warriors get the #1 Pick.  2. They pick Wiseman  3. They trade Wiseman for Kevin Durant at the trade deadline when the Brooklyn Nets fall apart because Kyrie Irving finds out Kevin Durant puts both mustard and ketchup on his hot dogs.  calling it now
If Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are so good then why did they only win 23 games together?
Well playing more minutes could be because they were better?  Also you ignore the vast change in pace over the past 15 years or so. Using per 100 possessions numbers:  |Rk|Player|Age|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|PTS| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Luka Doncic|19|.427|.327|.713|11.8|9.0|31.9| |2|Carmelo Anthony|19|.426|.322|.777|8.6|3.9|29.6| |3|Kevin Durant|19|.430|.288|.873|6.3|3.5|29.2| |4|LeBron James|19|.417|.290|.754|7.3|7.9|28.0| |5|RJ Barrett|19|.400|.320|.592|8.1|4.0|22.5|
Greg oden. Imagine picking an average traditional center over Kevin Durant lol could be portland
"everybody knew that series was over when CP3 got hurt.  it was james harden single handily  trying to beat a team that won 67 games, 73 games, won a title, made 2 finals and then added kevin durant. Rockets had no chance when Paul got hurt     ALL the defensive attention was on harden and he had nobody to relive the pressure, meanwhile on the warriors [KD was getting the same level of defensive attention as a guy like andrew wiggins or Tobias Harris would get (seriously look at the easy shots the dude got compared to any other star in the league)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAM9ts7c4yE) all  becuase steph curry and klay were there sucking up the defense and they still made shots despite that.    Warriors were almost unbeatable to begin with and when the rockets lost their best player in that series it ended all hope"
"Do you watch basketball? If you did you would see why i consider him a champion. He was the best player and the clutchest player ona  team that went up 3-2 against a team that won 67 games, 73 games, had a 24 game win streak and made back to abck finals nand then replaced their worst starter with kevin durant.   Chris Paul got hurt and the rockets lost but anybody who was watching that series knew for a fact that if chris paul wasn't hurt he would have won that series (The WCF was also the real NBA finals that year)     People need to actually start watching basketball and learning about context. You dont think CP3 is a champion for actually leading his team and competing for his title meanwhile you probably think KD is a champion for joining a team that won a championship and made 2 finals before he even joined.   You are what is wrong with fans in sports. Rings culture is ass"
Except they aren't similar. They're cherry picked to lump him in with them  |Rk|Player|Season|Age|FG%|3P%|FT%|TRB|AST|PTS| |-:|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Luka Doni|2018-19|19|.427|.327|.713|7.8|6.0|21.2| |2|Carmelo Anthony|2003-04|19|.426|.322|.777|6.1|2.8|21.0| |3|LeBron James|2003-04|19|.417|.290|.754|5.5|5.9|20.9| |4|Kevin Durant|2007-08|19|.430|.288|.873|4.4|2.4|20.3| |5|RJ Barrett|2019-20|19|.400|.320|.592|5.0|2.5|14.1|
They shouldn’t matter at all because winning a championship is a team accomplishment.   When you reward players for winning a championship in many cases you’re rewarding them for random chance.   - Randomly being drafted by the Spurs or Thunder and not the Knicks or Kings  - Randomly being traded to the Raptors or Rockets and not the Wizards or Bulls   - Kevin Durant randomly tearing his Achilles and Klay randomly tearing his ACL or Josh Smith randomly hitting threes in 2015 game 6 v. LAC and CP3 randomly pulling his hamstring in 2018
"Twice this guy named Kevin Durant picked up though, not Steph"
"Kevin Durant in the playoffs before Golden State: 28.8 PPG/3.7 APG, 45.5% FG/32.9% 3PT, 58.3% TS, 17.4 AST%  Kevin Durant in the playoffs with Golden State: 28.7 PPG/4.4 APG, 51.4% FG/39.5% 3PT, 64.2% TS, 20.6 AST%  Durant's rings don't mean shit."
Here is what I have for the top 25:  1	Michael Jordan  2	LeBron James  3	Bill Russell  4	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  5	Magic Johnson  6	Larry Bird  7	Wilt Chamberlain  8	Tim Duncan  9	Kobe Bryant  10	Jerry West  11	Oscar Robertson  12	Hakeem Olajuwon  13	Shaquille O'Neal  14	Moses Malone  15	Kevin Durant  16	John Havlicek  17	Dirk Nowitzki  18	Elgin Baylor  19	Julius Erving  20	Bob Pettit  21	Karl Malone  22	Charles Barkley  23	Bob Cousy  24	Stephen Curry  25	Kevin Garnett
Kevin Durant has an argument for best scorer of all-time (though I’d lean MJ/Kareem) but no argument for best offensive player. Jordan and LeBron are so far beyond him.
"Here's where you're giving no context again. KD had an all time spacing. This is along with an elite playmaker and DPOY. This means you can only throw single coverage on Durant and there is no other defensive scheme you can give him besides man to man. When you have LeBron and Jeff Green/Kevin Love you can not only zone, but you can constantly double and dig as soon as LeBron puts the ball down in the post. There's no accurate 1v1 comparison you can make with them in the finals."
"Michael Jordan, LeBron James, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  HM: Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant"
I'm 90% positive this is kevin Durant
"Complaining about the three point shot not shooting in general.   Just because y’all take the warriors to seven games, and they sweep the next team definitely doesn’t translate to y’all automatically beating that team had y’all won. Games/series can come down to matchups.   Congrats on all those accomplishments, I’m sure it will be talked about for ages.   And the warriors were beating y’all without Kevin Durant so that argument seems irrelevant.   Tell your front office to surround more folks around harden, but I’m guessing guys don’t wanna play with a ball hog, and maybe if y’all learned to play a little defense things might turn out a little better.    Defend all you want but guess what??? 00000000 championships and 00000000 championship appearances.   And y’all answer was to trade for Westbrook. Lol"
"This is not going to be who I think is the best at every position, but instead the team I think would work best in the modern NBA.      PG: Steph Curry  SG: Jordan  SF: Lebron James  PF: Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, or Kevin Durant (I’m a little torn on this choice)  Center: Hakeem  I know KD is not a traditional power forward btw for the people who are going to mention that."
5v5 I’m taking KD over Steph too.. I don’t understand how this is a debate you could see the gap between them on the floor. Klay and Kerr said it because it’s common knowledge. Kevin Durant pre Achilles was that good..
"&gt;I'll have to look, but I think he was I'm the MVP conversation  2016 MVP Voting:  1. Steph Curry 2. Kawhi Leonard 3. LeBron James 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Kevin Durant 6. Chris Paul 7. Draymond Green 8. Damian Lillard 9. James Harden 10. Kyle Lowry  2015 MVP Voting:  1. Stephen Curry 2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Russell Westbrook 5. Anthony Davis 6. Chris Paul 7. LaMarcus Aldridge 8. Marc Gasol/**Blake Griffin** 9. Tim Duncan/Kawhi Leonard/Klay Thompson  Maybe you mean as far back as 2014, where he was 3rd behind KD and LeBron? With KD having 119 out of 125 votes, and LeBron the other 6?"
"I dont know what world you live in but over here in reality Kevin Durant is seen as needing to join a super team in order to win a championship.  Like I said people already knew he was a great scorer, which is what his fmvps are based off of.  No one was surprised that he got them and it was seen as an overall weak move that deligitimized the playoffs for a few years. No change in Durants legacy there."
All I read was “Kevin Durant....resuming season”.
"~~Dame~~ Russ ain’t a Batman ig 🤷🏽‍♂️, can’t even ~~carry his team to the playoffs like Westbrook can~~ win a single series without being carried by Kevin Durant.  Let me know when Russ can actually get out of the first round instead of getting outplayed by a 6'1 rookie lmao  Nothing you can ever say to me man. Dame owned Russ when it actually mattered. Russ was so scared he had PG guard Dame the final play lmaoooo"
"I mean, you gotta beat who is in front of you. Not our fault he was hurt.   With that said, we probably wouldn't have won if Kevin Durant was in the lineup, which is why people like to discredit. But injuries suck. Usually you want to see the two best teams face off at full strength to see who is the best."
lol kevin durant was tony allen’s bitch this whole series
"AD was on the call  &gt;Chris Paul, the president of the players association, arranged the call that included LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook, sources said.  https://ca.news.yahoo.com/sources-nba-superstars-establish-united-front-on-private-conference-call-to-resume-season-210518262.html"
"Yeah Kendrick Perkins and “every team ever” sure is similar to losing Kevin fucking Durant and Klay. Stop it. It’s not that deep, I’m not taking anything away. I don’t really care that much but literally everyone expected the Warriors to come back and win that series if the injuries didn’t happen and we’ll never know. You’re taking it way further than it needs to be."
"My man, Dame isn't even going to make the playoffs this year despite Portland having more depth than OKC did after KD left  The Jazz statistically were just as efficient as Kevin Durant was when isolating on Melo, who was also awful offensively, but ok"
"Sure, but those guys were not in the same tier as Lillard, Kyrie, Curry, Wall by that time  Here's a look at the leading scorers on each team during 2012-13 season  |Team|Player|Position|Team Rank of PG|Team Rank of SF| |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |Atlanta|J.

"For real tho, I saw Pascal Siakam working out at a gym back when he was still on the Raptors 905 team (around 2017), and you couldn't tell me this guy wasn't prime Kevin Durant."
"Skip Bayless saying that Manu Ginobili was better than Kevin Durant. This was in 2013, when KD was considered the second best player in the world and Manu was past his prime"
"I literally stopped watching the NFL because I was sick of Patriots Superbowls and found the league pointless when all the talent inevitably ended up in Boston. Different strokes for different folks (I also find your complaints about player/team culture in the NFL half-baked and ironic, given what Tom Brady is doing for the Bucs right now all by himself). You know as well as I do that the Durant signing was caused by a cap spike and the rest of the league couldn’t just “get better.” Like I said, I don’t blame them, but I don’t have to like it.  It’s sports my guy. You’re really reading too far into how people completely unrelated to you want to consume it. I think Kevin Durant is lame and the Warriors won two rings based on a cap loophole as opposed to on the court, you disagree. Neither of us are the only one on our side of this line."
“The Southern Dandy” Kevin Durant
"Tier 3 IMO. Tier 1 is for Bird, Jordan, Magic, Timmy, Shaq, Moses Malone, Kraeem, Kobe, etc. etc.  Tier 2 is Kevin Garnett, Hakeem Olajuwan, Zeke, Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, Dr. J (for NBA), Lebron James and Steph Curry (could've been tier 1), etc. etc.  Then there is tier 3 with Charles Barkley, AI, Steve Nash, Kevin Durant, etc. etc."
"Gun to your head, do you think Kevin Durant is a better player than a Bill Russell?   Player rankings aren’t all about who the best player is. Though I do agree that Giannis is obviously a better player and that guys who win chips as second and third options are overrated in comparison to equally talented guys who are lucky to play with someone like Duncan."
"&gt; Even in 2012 you had Lebron, Kevin Durant, Carmelo  CP3 and Rose were definitely better players than Melo in 2012"
"Even in 2012 you had Lebron, Kevin Durant, Carmelo. The top players were still small forwards although it was more top heavy back then for the position."
Too bad he needed Durant to get more rings.  Boi got clamped by Kevin Love lmao
"LeBron having returned to Cleveland,  only winning one more championship.   Toronto winning an NBA championship,   Harden and Westbrook being on the same team again.   The Clippers never going past the second round of the playoffs,   Kevin Durant joining a 73-9 team   Melo being exiled for a year.   USA team finishing 7th place in an international tournament featuring NBA players  A chubby Siberian being the best centre in the league."
"# Some coaches may die but that's a risk we're willing to take -   ^(LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry probably)"
Nets legend Kevin Durant
&gt; This is so subjective   &gt; Kevin Durant is definitely   Pick one.
"I think it makes sense to put players in different tiers. Obviously you cant compare Jerry West to Kevin Durant eg. What you can do is evaluate impact and skillsets by eye test, stats, achievementand so on.   My point is, I couldn't say if Durant is 17th with West as 18th or whatever. But I can put them in B-Tier of all time greats."
"Y’all dudes are weird. I and many others have pointed out many times that Mike just doesn’t like (and/or is threatened by) Lebron. Some of you still havent connected the dots. That man has never just plainly accepted or said anything out of the way that’s more than surface level respect. It’s always just enough. And at any given chance to be contrarian, he takes it   ‘yea Blake is a better actor’. Space jam 2 starring Blake griffin would be the kevin Durant movie thunderstruck 2.0. The whole point of the space jam name is the star power"
Back in like 2017 people on Twitter and instagram found that KD had burner social media accounts that he used to argue with fans.   https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/18/16328032/kevin-durant-alleged-burner-fake-account-twitter-instagram-quiresultan
&gt; He's Kevin Durant..y'all know who he is  A bitch? Or do you mean a snake?
"There is no 5-yr run definitively better than Curry's run from 2014-15 through 2018-19. Not the Warriors as a team but Curry's individual impact on the results of each season. Kevin Durant is of the same caliber as Pippen and Wade. Thompson and Green are similar tier to Rodman, Kyrie, Bosh, and Love.     The years before that run are impressive enough, injuries aside, that Curry is on pace for a top 5 career."
"I'm assuming you're basing this off the 1996 ECF, sure he guarded shaq but it's not like he contained him. This was also early Shaq who was nothing like the 2000s shaq. They got sweeped but Shaq still put up 27pts at 64% fg. Even mutombo who is one of the greatest defensive players of all time couldn't do much vs 2000s shaq.   KD is like Shaq, pretty much unguardable. In 2014 lebron who was playing stellar defense during those years said that nobody could guard KD, and KD has only improved since. Guarding KD and Shaq is nothing like guarding anyone else.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1940629-lebron-james-theres-nobody-that-can-guard-kevin-durant-1-on-1  To say Rodman could do significant damage to KD's game is a really really big stretch considering no one in the league has been able to put a dent into it yet."
1. Michael Jordan   2. LeBron James   3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   4. Magic Johnson   5. Wilt Chamberlain   6. Tim Duncan   7. Larry Bird    8. Bill Russell   9.   Shaq    10. Kobe Bryant   11.

This is so subjective.   Kevin Durant is definitely in the top 20 of all time.  He's between 15-20.
"Warriors were up 3 when Klay tore his ACL. Let's not be revionist historians and act like the Warriors were shitting on the Raptors in Game 6. 3 points is literally one possession. And, you know whats more credible than being up 3 points in game 6? Being up 3-2 in the series. Or outscoring the Warriors in 18 out of 24 quarters played in the 2019 NBA Finals. Sorry to tell ya, but saying that a team that only outscored the Raptors in 6 quarters (one of which relied upon playing Kevin Durant when he shouldn't have been playing at all) in a 6 game series is gonna win the series is just unbelievable."
"And having an injury on the same leg before can contribute to that. A previous injury can increase your risk of injury and reinjury due to that part of your body being weakened (in the case of a grade 1 hamstring strain) which can compromise how you deal with load and force. In what situation would a compromise in how you deal with load and force really impact a player? Landing. To say that continuing to play on that grade 1 left strained hamstring had nothing to do with a torn left ACL just doesn't make any sense. Any lower body injury can lead to further lower body injuries, as we have seen with other players such as Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Grant Hill, and even Kevin Durant in Game 5 of the very same NBA Finals.  Sup fellow ACL tearee."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant going to Golden State was and always will be the weakest move of all time. He will never crack the top 20 because he had to ride the coattails of a great team to get back to the finals.
"ESPN: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established united front in favor of Giannis Antetokounmpo joining their respective teams"
Kevin Durant. McGrady had one season that's remotely comparable to even just an average Durant OKC season.
No one can guard Kevin Durant comfortably
"It’s obvious you know nothing about basketball or you are just another blind KD hater. Curry has been elite for half the decade, KD the whole decade, the difference is there.  KD has 3-4 seasons that are better than Curry’s weak MVP season in 2015, it largely compensates  the one extra MVP. + the trophy is all about narrative, Nash has more MVPs than Shaq and Kobe but he is not higher than them in an all time scale.   You are comparing Kevin Durant to Billups and Joe Dumars ? Lmaaooo. And the comparison is dumb as fuck because KD won his 2 FMVPs by outplaying Curry in the Finals, he is just the better  player."
"&gt;[Haynes] Yahoo Sources: NBA superstars LeBron James, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Stephen Curry held private conference call on Monday and established   a new super team. They will be joining the hawks, Trae Young has been traded for nothing to the Jazz, he ain't shit."
"Its so rare that really only guys like Kevin Durant, Michael Porter JR and Giannis have come along since then and each was an extremely touted prospect for being able to do so."
"**SUPERSTAR:**  1.) LeBron James  2.) Giannis Antetokounmpo   3.) Kevin Durant  4.) Steph Curry  5.) Kawhi Leonard  6.) James Harden  7.) Damian Lillard  8.) Russell Westbrook  9.) Nikola Jokic  10.) Luka Doncic  These 10 players change the game at a high dynamic and can have success without the help of a second all star if need to be. These players are true gamechangers.  **STAR:**  11.) Anthony Davis  12.) Kyrie Irving  13.) Paul George  14.) Joel Embiid  15.) Chris Paul  16.) Jimmy Butler  17.)  Kemba Walker  18.) Bradley Beal  19.) Kyle Lowry  20.) Ben Simmons   Players that are very, very good. However, you can’t exactly build a team around a “Star” player without complimenting with other stars if you want to have success.  (Simmons without Embiid can’t make it very far)  (Embiid without Simmons can’t make it very far)  (Davis couldn’t get far without second star/(Was dominant with Boogie)  (Kyrie couldn’t make playoffs or win games without LeBron)  (Paul George in his current state can’t carry a team very far due to his inability to shoot consistently)  (CP3 needs Blake/Harden.)  (Butler needs Embiid/Simmons)  (Kemba couldn’t go very far without a second star/needs Tatum to become a star)  (Beal needs Wall)  (Lowry needs DeRozan or Kawhi)"
"Come on man. Half the plays they would use Kevin Love's man to set the screen, forcing love to switch out onto Curry and then spread the court leaving Curry one on one with Love.   https://www.knbr.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-explains-why-he-agrees-with-kevin-durants-criticism-of-his-offense/  &gt; That’s why guys like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant are who they are. They can transcend any defense. But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over. No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play  You notice he didn't mention Steph there but mentioned guys like Kobe, MJ and Durant"
Denver didn’t win against a Portland team that had to run a rotation of Anus Cancer and Meyers Leonard. Unless MPJ ascends to his Kevin Durant comp I just can’t see them winning a series.
"Lo atl all these people saying ""Rodman would be in KD's head"". Nobody on that team is guarding KD, not MJ (he struggled against Magic watch the 1991 finals), not Pippen(KD destroyed Prime Defende Kawhi in 2016). Put some respect on that boy's name. He's Kevin Durant..y'all know who he is"
kevin durant doesn’t join those guys if bron doesn’t set the precedent for placing himself in the best position possible to win multiple championships.
"Why is he a bit of a douche?  Kevin Durant was one of the very few stars i had heard of before i picked the Nets (before i even realised he played for the Nets), when watching the first game and the player introductions i was surpised by how sturn he was, didnt looked very pleased to be where he was if im honest 😂"
I also think lebron has more than 3 championships if Kevin Durant didn’t join you guys
"you can’t defend losing to san antonio at home without kawhi playing in 2017  he’s up ~20 in both games 6 &amp; 7 vs the warriors and has a tragic collapse in both games in 2018  curry has zero points at halftime last year &amp; you lose at home without kevin durant playing.. there’s no excuse.   it’s not about the losing, it’s about how he’s losing in tragic fashion; but l agree he’s cold blooded in general."
"&gt;""Kevin Durant is the best player on the planet. He's beaten LeBron James head-to-head in 2 Finals in which he was the Finals MVP; He's the best mid-range jump shooter we've seen since Jordan; He's been a candidate for DPOY and almost a 90% career FT shooter."""
Bruno Caboclo aka Brazilian Kevin Durant
"I have a lot of gripes with this list, but that's kind of the point. Dumb outrage porn seems to be ESPN's specialty these days.  Iverson is ludicrously high. Cousy is ludicrously low. At least for once they got Baylor right, everyone leaves him out of their top 25 and it kills me.  George Mikan posted 23 and 12 over &lt;450 career games in the 50s. Bob Pettit posted 26 and 16 over \~800 career games in the much more competitive 60s. Pettit was the dramatically better player for sure.  Dwight Howard missing the list is a travesty. Come on dude, Artis Gilmore, Bob Lanier *and* Alonzo Mourning over Dwight as big men?  Their treatment of current players is comically inconsistent. I'm fine with the idea you can include assumptions about Giannis' career arc, but you have to be conservative with your assumptions and lean towards a ""normal career"" even if they're abnormal now. It looks like they're projecting him to be putting up 30 and 15 for another decade, with that ranking. They didn't extend the same treatment to, say, Joel Embiid. If Giannis and Kawhi are top 30 he's definitely top 60.  I have Curry top 20 now myself but it's just disrespectful to rank him as better, whole-career, than Kevin Durant."
Other players:  Shaquille O'Neal - 546  Dirk Nowitzki - 759  Vince Carter - 768  Dwyane Wade - 768  Blake Griffin - 511  Tony Parker - 1023   James Harden - 891  Russell Westbrook - 977  Kevin Durant - 551  Giannis Antetokounmpo - 475  Manu Ginobili - 538  Derrick Rose - 697

"Why are you  comparing the teams without Chris Paul? Also you used a game where Demarcus Cousins played like an all star. Again, ignoring context. Harden's team in 2016-2017 probably still isnt as talented against the Warriors who had 3 all NBA  players, with Iggy and Livingston as well. Harden still doesnt have an all star caliber player next to him so why is that better than a KD warriors team without Curry?  He's pretty much working with as much spacing as he did in OKC, only he's got Draymond on defense and Klay on offense? Also why mention Zaza and West but not Looney?  Okay, gentleman's sweep, is that better? Not really. They still pretty much killed them almost every game they played. Yea Warriors defense had a hand in that TS being low. Taking a Spurs team out in 5 games without Curry still proves something.  Lol okay Klay out played KD? So how does that prove your point about anything Curry related, Klay gave KD adequate help without Curry, hmmm its almost as if Klay is an all NBA player. Klay might have a big drop off but that doesnt mean he isnt important.  Klay is still a 2 way all nba player who just by being on the floor gives massive relief to Curry. Did the finals last year not show you anything at all? Like..again you are just trying to demean the others to make Curry look good. Draymond gets better in the playoffs...hmm its almost as if Draymond is a generational defensive talent. The Warriors defense doesnt work without Draymond Ben Taylor has also made a note of that himself.  So you dismiss a game where they a beat a good playoff team without Curry after coming off a gentleman's sweep without Curry got it. That net rating data is lineup dependent. How many minutes does Curry have without playing next to an all NBA player. Which is what Harden regularly has to do. It's probably very little.  I can't believe I have to be this thorough just to explain that the Warriors were better with Kevin freaking Durant than without him. Do you think any Warriors player would be dumb enough to tell you that? Not even that he was the best player, but that they are a better team with him. You use data that is not only lineup dependent, but doesnt give any  context as well.  Also to add to this point, just look at what happend when Klay wasnt there in the Raptors series and then again at the beginning of next season. They were getting their assed handed to them and Curry got injured with all the defensive attention. He's never even had to play a season without an all star caliber teammate next to him."
"Less shitty mid-range shooting. There’s nothing worse than watching dudes like Wiggins or Westbrook chuck mid-range shots and hit them at like a 38% clip. Players that are actually good at them are really fun to watch (e.g Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, etc.) but it’s painful to watch people brick the worst shots in the game"
"&gt; D'Antoni as a coach has to say ""good shots only"".  Easier to do this if the team had better players.  Say like a Chris Paul type player. Or a Kevin Durant or a Klay Thompson. Add one of them and the Rockets would have a championship right now."
"Based on the games you listed which had different rosters dude? You are leaving out context. You'd be crazy to suggest that the Warriors have anywhere near the dominance theyve had without KD. They arent better without Kevin Durant and never will be.  LMAO, good luck having Andre Iguodala shoot that well for an entire series. That wont happen. If you restart that series without KD, the Rockets take it."
"Lakers title hopes are predicated entirely on LeBron’s ability to age gracefully as well.   Clippers are gonna be flakes every year until the post season and they play them close. Nuggets are also a playoff unknown, while they are a bad matchup without a center (Capela was a Nuggets killer) they can still easily win with better guard play from Harden/Westbrook over Murray/Harris   Only team in the East worth worrying about is the Bucks who they will only see in the finals. The Celtics are not a threat, Luka needs a top tier team around him to make noise, Warriors will be “back” in a capacity without Kevin Durant who is in the East right now   The one WCF conference appearance they had they were up 3-2 against Klay/Steph/Durant until their second best player got injured, hardly a choke"

"LMAO why would he be?  Kawhi Leonard has 4 seasons where he's played at an all NBA level. He's won 2 finals MVPs for two teams, and that's great. But that Spurs win was as much a team effort as any finals has ever been.  Let's even give him all NBA 2nd team this year even though it's not awarded yet. Kawhi is 2X 1st team and 2X 2nd with 2 finals MVP and has career averages of 19/6/3 and has 9,620 points.  Meanwhile: Kevin fucking Durant is a 2X champ, 2X finals MVP, 1X MVP where he averaged 32/7/5 on god efficiency, even when you don't count his foot injury he has 10 seasons of all NBA level play, and is a 6X first team and 3X 2nd team with 4 scoring titles and 22k points  Meanwhile Curry has 7 seasons of all NBA level play and is a 6X all NBA, 2X MVP, 1X scoring champ, a 3X MVP, and though he doesn't have ""FMVP"" in his trophy case, he averaged 26/5/6 in 2015 finals, 27/8/9 in the 2017 finals, and 28/6/7 in the 2018 finals.   No Kawhi has not surpassed them."
&gt;NBA players are the most confident guys in the world and all of them at the top think they’re the best  Kevin Durant explains and validates himself anonymously on the daily basis
"&gt;**Kevin Durant**  &gt; Unforgivable sin: Signing with the Warriors.  &gt;Jordan’s revenge: Writing, filming, directing, and editing a Gatorade commercial all by himself  Ok ringer"
"Nobody should be mad about this. Idk how people don’t realize this already: The majority of superstars think they’re the best player ever, they just don’t have the same accomplishments so they don’t say it   Kevin Durant definitely feels he’s the greatest player ever. He’s 7 foot and scores over everybody, how could he not? He only lost in OKC because there was no spacing, what happened in Golden State? GOAT team and GOAT numbers for him. In his mind he’s thinking if you swapped him for MJ in those series then he would do the same thing or better   Harden brought the Steph-KD warriors to 7 games and has all time statistical seasons, he legitimately thinks he’s the first and only guy to ever be doubled at half court. In his mind he only hasn’t won because he didn’t have enough talent yet and right when he got it with CP3 the warriors had to make a super team to beat him. He’s got Daryl Morey making spreadsheets telling him 800 different ways he’s better than MJ. Dude definitely thinks he’s the goat and could’ve done the same stuff as MJ on those teams   Steph literally changed the game and had every team trying to catch up to him. He’s making shots nobody in NBA history ever has. He wins a championship. Next year gets hurt in the playoffs and loses, so he’s thinking “we went up 3-1 with me hurt, imagine me healthy”. They get KD, and he’s watching the film for every game and seeing guys are still doubling him over KD. KDs numbers were the ones that changed, not Steph’s. 2019 his whole team dies and he’s still out here dropping 47, the Raptors pull out a middle school defense tactic that never gets played in the NBA just to stop him. He loses but he’s got G league teammates. Dudes the first unanimous MVP, you really think he thinks someone else is better than him?   Kawhi doesn’t say anything, but he won finals MVP and beat the heatles. He wins 2 DPOYs. He moves on from the best org and best coach in the league, spends a year in Toronto and still wins a championship while making sure he doesn’t get hurt and mess up the payday. You really think he looks at other guys and thinks he’s worse than them?   Kobe has said before that he thinks he’s the best player ever, he’ll always show respect to Jordan because of the 6 rings and accomplishments and the fact that he was a mentor to him, but Kobe for sure thinks that if he was put on those bulls teams they still win 6, or 8 because he wouldn’t have played baseball. Dude even said he was the best over Jordan and Lebron on James Corden (was in a comedy situation but you know he means it) How could Kobe dedicate his life to basketball, reach the highs he did, and not think he’s the best ever? He had an entire new generation telling him he was too   Shaq swept MJ, who was putting up MJ numbers even if he only just came back. The next year they lost but because that team fell apart around him. Then he went on to be the best player on one of the 3 best teams ever. You think with his resume he thinks MJ was better than him?   The only truly humble superstars that I’ve heard are Bird, Iverson, Magic, and Nash. They all go out of their way to praise the next generation and say that guys are better than them   Do you know how many non stars think they’re the great? On the Heatles Mario Chalmer just thought the big 3 were taking shots away from him. Raymond Felton said multiple times that he was the best point guard in the league. Spencer Dinwiddie thinks he’s as athletic as MJ  NBA players are the most confident guys in the world and all of them at the top think they’re the best, and the only reason they’re not considered the best is because other guys are in better situations. And you can’t really blame them. The only reason MJ can say he’s the goat and nobody will get mad is because he’s got the best resume for it right now. If Luka averages 30/10/10 for his whole career and wins 20 rings, you think MJ is saying that he’s the new goat? No way, he’s saying “If I played today I’d average 60/20/20 and never lose a game”"

"I’m not into basketball much now days (I was big into the Knicks back in the Starks days), but I have been glued to this documentary. I legit haven’t watched more than 3 hours of nba basketball in the last 5 years. My wife saw me watching episode 7 tonight and got sucked in. After episode 8 she was upset to find out we have to wait another week “to see what happens” haha. She was also very surprised to see that Jordan is not a “nice” guy. This documentary is incredible. It’s taken someone who isn’t into basketball anymore (me) and someone who couldn’t pick out Kevin Durant from a 2 person lineup (wife) and sucked us in. WAY better than tiger king in terms of 2020 documentaries."
"Steve Kerr introduced Kevin Durant to the Warriors by punching him in the face in front of the whole team. Sadly, this was back during a 2014 preseason game before Durant joined the team."
Space Jam with Kevin Durant playing for the Monstars
If LeBron got Kevin Durant on his team for 5 mil a year he'd have 6 championships too.
Kevin Durant
"Every championship in the last few years could have an asterisk next to it. Kyrie and Kevin Love injured. Draymond suspended. Kawhi injured. Rockets miss 27 straight 3s. Durant / Klay / Cousins injured. Who cares anymore? A championship is a championship. If you win, you win."
Yes and Rockets Blamed Kevin Durant for not playing lol.
JJ barea isn’t Kevin Durant
"Again, none of the names you listed can shine KD's shoes.  KD is quite possibly the most skilled scorer of all time and third greatest scorer in the history of the game, i don't care if he's been out for 12 months, he would comeback and drop 30 ppg on above average efficiency.  You can't compare the return of players with completely different skillsets and in a completely different stratosphere in terms of talent to the return of Kevin fucking Durant.  Dominique Wilkins tore his Achilles in January of '92, came back next season in November and averaged 30, and his game relied way more on pure athleticism than KD's."
Kevin Durant. He just can't win with those cats. Haha.
And yet people think Kevin Durant is better than Curry. I don't think people watched when Stephen Curry was dominating and ending games by the 3rd quarter and doing it on insane efficiency
"Guy before said Harden had 3 opportunities, and in the first, Warriors weren't established as GOAT. The guy I'm responding to replies to that by saying:  &gt; Bro 2017 was literally the year that the team with the best season record ever added Kevin Fucking Durant. They were definitely the GOAT team at that point  so clearly he thinks the Rockets played the Warriors in 2017"
"Damn bro, you sound kinda pathetic for making a comment like this. Really? MVP, 2x FMVP, 9x all NBA Kevin Durant is a 'beta'? Says the dude sitting on the couch yelling at his computer all butthurt over nothing. I think we all know who the real 'beta' is."
"&gt;Harden took a team that won a title, won 73 games and made 2 finals and then replaced their worst starter with kevin durant too 7 games and was up 3-2 before his running mate gor injured  Chris Paul was more integral to those 3 wins than Harden."
I think you forgot last year Milwaukee matchup He was playing like a shit And Kevin Durant won’t be Kevin Durant because he was injured
"But Kevin Durant is not Kevin Durant, he's a year older and coming off a devastating achilles tear. In fact, it is guaranteed he won't be the same and the question is if what's left is still good enough to be an all-star or not. But you can forget him having no dropoff whatsoever. The question is whether a 75% KD who can't drive consistently and can only jump half as high as he used to is still dangerous or not."
Kyrie also shot 6-20 in three playoff games in a row last year and Kevin Durant is coming off an Achilles injury that permanently hurts your explosiveness and stamina.
Bro 2017 was literally the year that the team with the best season record ever added Kevin Fucking Durant. They were definitely the GOAT team at that point
Curry’s 3 over Kevin Love in Game 7 2016 Finals.  Kevin Durant doesn’t go to Golden State. The 2017 Spurs and Warriors are head to head with the possibility of KD staying in OKC or going to Boston. Cleveland Cavs potentially win 2017.  League still lacks some parity but the NBA is better off.  Plus Warriors fans can die happy with 2016.
Helped that you also had Kevin Durant on that team...
"The room sits on the second floor of Zions Bank Basketball Campus in Salt Lake City, the practice facility of the Utah Jazz, and it is occupied to some degree almost daily. It’s a room where ideas get tossed around, where trades have been executed and draft night war rooms have been set up. It’s a room where countless scenarios have been debated and basketball decisions made. On this day, it was occupied for 45 minutes, which seems like almost nothing. Twenty-four hours later, those 45 minutes were a prelude to one of the most significant events the Jazz may ever face as a team.  On the morning of March 10, a seemingly innocuous Tuesday, the Jazz front office discussed a dire threat that much of America had still been underestimating: The novel coronavirus that [began in Wuhan, China, in late December](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html) and had been making its way across the globe. Less than 24 hours after Utah’s disappointing 101-92 loss to the Toronto Raptors at Vivint Smart Home Arena, the players were at the team’s facility as part of a pro day. They got their shots up, did the routine physical treatment, went through film work with the coaching staff and then did even more work on the floor. There was a time crunch. The Jazz had a charter to catch a few hours later, for an all-important road matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The mood in the room upstairs was driven by a larger picture that transcended basketball. A front office that has spent almost a decade getting out in front of issues and exhibiting control, suddenly had much less control than it was accustomed to. Four members of Utah’s brain trust — Dennis Lindsey, Justin Zanik, David Morway and Steven Schwartz — went through probabilities and different models. Jazz VP of Performance and Healthcare Mike Elliott joined them. And together, they asked themselves the question that was disconcerting to them all.  What happens if one of our players tests positive for the coronavirus?  And what happens if one of our players tests positive … during a road trip?  A month later, this meeting looks prophetic. Less than a day later, Rudy Gobert’s positive test would provide the answer that none of them wanted.  That was the day the NBA came to a halt, and it wouldn’t be alone for long. The country would come to a crawl soon thereafter.  Hockey, baseball, and soccer and sports all over the world weren’t far behind. A country that had been trying to ignore the issue suddenly had a pandemic forced onto its doorstep. An NBA that had its toe in the water in dealing with the coronavirus — the league had just waded into the infancy stage of eliminating fans from select games — was forced to dive in headfirst. Players around the league would be tested, with at least seven players known to test positive, including two-time Finals MVP Kevin Durant, Celtics guard Marcus Smart and Detroit’s Christian Wood. The NBA experience, in many ways, was a microcosm of a country.  But the Jazz themselves knew none of this on that Tuesday morning.  They spent 45 minutes in total, with a half hour dedicated to playing out the scenario of the positive test on the road. They tried to prepare as best they could. They set up a communication chain that would reach the very top of the organization should the worst occur. The group looked at every curve. They were consistently updated through the meeting. Even so, a group that carefully examines the pros and cons of every move it makes for the organization on and off the floor came to a sobering conclusion.  It was next to impossible to prepare for something so unique that has proven difficult to handle at every level.  As an organization, the Jazz were as vigilant as anyone in regards to coronavirus awareness than most to that point, and perhaps more than most. Head coach Quin Snyder and the front office had top healthcare officials in Utah meet with players and coaches over multiple meetings in an effort to educate, sources tell *The Athletic*. The team itself had been taking what they thought were preventative measures, even if the players themselves had been a bit slow to. And the league had already restricted locker room access to essential personnel on game nights.  Today, the coronavirus is running rampant in the United States as a whole, with more than 427,000 confirmed cases as of April 8, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html). Much of the country has essentially shut down. Social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding people in general, this is the new reality. Nobody is quite sure when the country will be able to resume regular business, or to what degree. And that doesn’t even include what is going on all over the world.  In this story, *The Athletic* will put you alongside the Jazz in the days leading up to the night much of it started. It will chronicle everything from the challenges the Jazz faced the day Gobert received the fateful test to the days immediately after. It will tackle the now-publicized rift between Gobert and fellow star Donovan Mitchell, and what it means going forward. It will spell out what’s next for a Jazz franchise that’s trying to adjust to the new normal.  For the Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder and the NBA, it was a night where lives were changed, an unforgettable and surreal scene played out in the bowels of Chesapeake Arena. For almost everyone involved, it was a night that accelerated the course of a nation."
How did Kevin Durant get two in three years? That's how.  😈
"Peak versus career. Some episodes were stronger than others, but IASIP never really had a flat episode, which is impressive for that lengthy a run.  I almost wanted to say that I thought Community was more experimental- even though both obviously push things and have strangely poignant homoeroticism: Jeffrey's taint during the pool game and the future Yakuza leader catfishing the dean versus Mac's struggle with his sexuality ending in an unexpectedly emotional denouement, which is the show's jumping the shark and landing it moment.  I love both shows and could probably write much more about similarities between the two (Pierce and Frank as curmudgeonly old men or Jeffrey as an amalgamation of Dennis's unsecure narcissism and Mac's constant projection of machismo), but I think it's more interesting and topical to this thread to think of them as a team.  All the main characters on IASIP are credited as producers, I believe, and there is incredible consistency in the shared vision. IASIP would be the Detroit Pistons- no all stars but the team shared a vision. Or maybe the Spurs- point being is it had a system and sound locker room.  Sunny does have its outre moments but I feel is more grounded in its pathos- the people are crazy but it's a recognizable Seinfeld craziness of self-absorbed people. Community is more of a psylocybin-induced adolescent daydream. After all we have epic pillow forts during a paintball war. The stakes mattered more in Sunny and the players knew it, while Community had a more recognizable sitcom format where everyone learns a lesson at the end of the episode. However, there are chemistry issues in Community. This is mostly due to Chevy Chase in terms of the cast, but internally it is more volatile as well. Everyone in IASIP treats each other equally poorly, and there is no conflicting dynamics created by romance. Although Mac may be in love with Dennis, he and Charlie are often shown as best friends, while Dee and Dennis pair up, but then Danny Devito have their own thing going and they all form a cycling Ouroborous of awfulness. In Community we have more pronounced strife and more clearly defined distinctions. Pierce is the past-his-prime vet trying to prove his worth in a game that has left him behind (Kendrick Perkins?), while Jeff is a man out of place, thinking his talents are wasted on this team and coasts on his natural ability- Kevin Durant. Given Jeff's love triangle with Brita and Annie, Troy and Abed are the only continuous relationship. Community is a team of talents held together by a coach until they can get the job done.  In terms of accomplishments by the team I would give it to IASIP who ran a dynasty like the 11-time champion Celtics. Better team, but I'd have to give better coach to Dan Harmon, who proved he could do it again with Rick and Morty.  And now I can't even remember what the parent was that made me write that convoluted mess, which is brought to you by quarantine and vodka."
"&gt; OKCs offense dropped off After Westbrook’s injury, The offense consisted of KD/Kevin Martin/Reggie Jackson/Ibaka. Basically no shooters, No secondary playmakers/passers, no cutters, no real offensive system like the triangle. Of course the offensive rating would be low. Kobe in that lineup does worse.   ...... Are you genuinely joking?   This line up: KD/Kevin Martin/Reggie Jackson/Ibaka  Is not that far off from: Kobe/Fisher/Odom/Pau/Ramanovich.   Kobe in that system does far, far better. Considering Kobe's less offense tanked more in both reg season AND playoffs. But dur dur, ""system"" Fucking LOL  &gt; So citing Net +- As a crutch to claim a superstar (as the only real guy who can dribble 2 times in a row) as a negative demonstrates your inability to Contextualize Numbers.  No doofus, learn how to read again, as illustrated before,   the issue isn't him being a negative net plus-minus player, the issue is the awful offense that he lead.   From 2011-2013 in the playoffs, KD lead offense was awful, compared to the obvious legends, and he wasn't doing jack shit elevating the offense despite the pretty box stats. Although it looks much better from 2014-2016, IT WAS ACTUALLY RW that was impacting the offense at a far higher level. KD without RW in this stretch became his normal self.   From 2008-2010, Kobe was BY FAR the most impactful offensive player on his team, by every metric.    &gt; Kevin Durant without Stephen Curry in the lineup in GSW for the post season.  &gt; 2017-2019  &gt; +7 net, 114 Ortg  &gt; Kobe form 2008-2010  &gt; +6.42 net 113 ORtG  .............  KD without Curry, has Klay, Green, some of the best role players possible.   Kobe outside Pau had absolutely dogshit spacing with poor bench.... and Kobe comes out this similar?   My god LOL  &gt; Durant obviously more efficient from the floor, better shooter, better Defender too.  It’s close, Both top 10 all time candidates with Kobe Higher for me (Top 7ish).  &gt; &amp; I’m not even going to get into why RAPM is Very very inconclusive data. Just read Justin Jacobs 3 part paper on it.  RAPM is more correlative than BPM in tracking wins by significant margins. High sample RAPM DESTROYS bpm, and is currently the most correlative advance stats.   &gt; It’s close, Both top 10 all time candidates with Kobe Higher for me (Top 7ish).  LOL wtf?   Durant doesn't sniff top 10 LOL."

"&gt; Fine Don’t use Durant’s GSW run. His two best playoff runs in OKC Trump Kobe’s 2 best playoff runs for LAL. Both in offense &amp; Defense.   Hahaha what a troll.   &gt; BPM doesn’t include APM. I never said that. I’m telling you how they improved the previous version by adding a component That standardizes the finisher vs creator role which APM studies have referenced.  &gt; Imagine being against using APM (which BpM 2.0 doesn’t use) for the postseason but Citing Net +-  No. I am citing 2012-2013 playoff net +/-, not because he was purely a negative player, but BECAUSE HE LEAD AN INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT OFFENSE. That's the issue, buddy.   Kevin Durant, with the ""higher"" impact in 2012/2013 than any of Kobe's seasons, lead a 105.2 offense. That's the issue. Kobe lead offense, as a clear first option, was never this instable.   But even LOOKING at box stats:   His 2012/2013 playoff numbers, per possesion:   Durant put up 36.2 points /7.4 assists with 57.4% TS with 12.7% TOV  vs   2008 Kobe: 38/7 with 57.7% TS with 11.3% TOV   This is a significant edge for Kobe. Higher volume with far higher efficiency. KD lead a significantly weaker offense with  the stronger cast, (RW missed 4 games tho, but his rapm as a second option trounces any second option player Kobe played for during the back to back rings)   BUT DUR DUR, BPM 2.0 is high on him. What a fucking joke LOL.  You know what the funniest shit is too? Durant lead offense in 2012 playoffs was worse than 2008 lead offense by Kobe despite having FAR stronger collection of talents. How funny is that, huh?  &gt; Durant is both a better scorer, Creator, Shooter, &amp; defender than Kobe.  LOLLLLLLLL."
"Kevin Durant is a fan of basketball, with your logic he can’t talk about basketball. Enjoy Sexton bum"
"Kevin Durant, here it is, my philosophy is basically this, and this is something that I live by, and I always have, and I always will: Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever."
&gt;”What’s the guys name with the crazy beard? Really good basketball player.”  &gt;”For the Clippers?”  &gt;”I don’t know shit. I think it’s Kevin Durant?”   Lmaoo
"No longer a fan, but you might check his size and get him of KD's sneakers.  They're not expensive and a good pair of signature sneakers is always a good gift.  Stockx (aftermarket resale): https://stockx.com/search/sneakers?s=durant  Nike: https://www.nike.com/w/kevin-durant-3hmd1?vst=kd&amp;redirect=true  On Nike's site, there's a couple of options to customize the colors so you can build him some custom KDs from scratch.  I think that would be a cool an unique gift."
Thank you so much for the detailed explanation! I was looking at [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/KEVIN-DURANT-SIGNED-FULL-SIZED-NBA-BASKETBALL-WITH-COA-GOLDEN-STATE-Warriors/264640813541?_trkparms=aid%3D555021%26algo%3DPL.SIMRVI%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D225080%26meid%3D4c197bfb398c4353873d0c9afaf0500e%26pid%3D101103%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Dpf%26sd%3D223396597894%26itm%3D264640813541%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2332490%26algv%3DSimplRVIAMLv5NativeWithPLRVIOnTopCombiner&amp;_trksid=p2332490.c101103.m3021&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but I’m not sure if this authentic or not... will continue doing my research!
"A COA is certificate of authenticity. There are different companies that issue COAs but PSA is one of the more reputable companies. There are some companies that aren't that reputable. It doesn't mean that the autograph is fake (sometimes it might cost too much for some people to send them into PSA or Beckett etc). If the price looks too good to be true, it often is. Thats probably the rule of thumb I would use. I have taken the risk in the past and bought some without COAs (For a great great price) and they look genuine to me but still, it's good to keep in mind. Alternatively you can consider autographed trading [cards](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kevin-Durant-2012-13-Elite-Series-VETERAN-INSCRIPTIONS-Autograph-29-99-BGS-9/223396597894?hash=item3403799086:g:Y5gAAOSwTkFcaFui) which are a lot easier to authenticate cause they are pretty hard to fake and often come in limited quantities/rarities."
"Something like [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/KEVIN-DURANT-Signed-Autographed-8x10-Photo-GOLDEN-STATE-WARRIORS-PSA-DNA/223921446636?hash=item3422c21eec:g:S7wAAOSwvAReTNOi) might be good, although you should do your due diligence when buying from an ebay seller because sometimes they sell things like ""reprints"" which is not what you want. I linked an autographed 8x10 cause it includes a PSA certificate which is what you want (they're pretty reputable in the authentication industry). But like I said, best to do your own due diligence"

Shooting splits of 45/32/85 in the playoffs is not elite for a player like Kevin Durant. His field goal percentage in his last 3 seasons in OKC is 46/46/43 and his 3 point percentage is 31/34/28. This dude was almost always near 50/40/90 in the regular season. People actually forgot how bad he choked in the playoffs the second he won one of the easiest rings for a superstar in history.  And he was not obviously their best player. Stephen Curry is the most valuable player to the Warriors and the leader of the team.

stop it lol the thunder had kevin wayne fucking durant and russ
"There really are 9 better players in history than Kobe Bryant i hope you do believe it. He has 2 FMVP's and 1 MVP much like Mr. Kevin Wayne Durant. It just so happened that he was a top 10 player in the league when Shaq was the best player on the planet for 3 straight years. The reason I don't rank Kobe as high as others is because I don't believe he was ever the best player in the league for more than 1 year. I'd say the same for KD. It's also why I put Tim ahead of Kobe, because I believe for a couple years Tim was the best player.  I'm totally cool with tiers, I do that as well. Although i'm not really sure how I rank Bill Russell. There were only like 50 players in the league at the time and he had by far the best roster for over a decade.  Hakeem has 1 MVP, 2 FMVP, 2 Titles, 2 DPOY Kevin has 1 MVP, 2FMVP, 2 Titles, 4 Scoring Titles  Seems about even to me.   But I also respect your opinion, it's nice to hear other's thoughts on it."
I’ve got a Kevin Durant Rookie Card in a Seattle SuperSonics Jersey. that’s about all I know about it.
"I initially read that as “Kevin Durant” and I got very wistful about how great it would be if we could have had Brandon Roy and Kevin Durant both rocking at the same time in the PNW, I would have been in basketball heaven."
Nothing...  Best 3-point shooting team in history PLUS Kevin Durant?  MJ would punch teammates and coaches in the first quarter
Kevin Durant is better at the game of basketball than steph curry. That’s easy.
"This is such a ridiculous take. That’s not what they did at all. Because of how great the Warriors are, people have been completely hyperbolic on how defenses guarded them(5.5 half foot point guard ... really?)  KD was NOT going one on one in the traditional sense. Look at the clip of how he explained the Clippers defense in the classic “I’m Kevin Durant” rant. He had Bev under him, and was being shaded by the corners the entire series. That’s why the Warriors called it “gimmick defense.” They were essentially trying to take KD AND Curry out the game, and basically leaving Draymond and Iggy open with one on Klay. A trap isn’t continuous lmao. Rotations happen. Recovers happen. And that’s what the Clippers did.   So what did the Warriors do? Spam Curry KD pick and rolls, which often gave KD the TIME to shoot before the double teams got there.   And you would also be surprised by how many different bodies were on KD. It wasn’t just Bev. I mean, just look at the highlights of that series. At one point we are going to have to realize it’s possible for teams to focus on two players. I know we still angry at KD, but we are going too far."
I want the following matchups:    Chris Paul vs Steve Kerr   Draymond Green vs Kevin Durant   Shaq vs Chuck   Austin Rivers va Doc Rivers
[Nah even Kevin Durant said that Shaq had no skills and was just big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pafd0wnerFQ) and he was almost 30 when he said it.
"&gt; So it’s safe to say baring injury Kevin Durant is better than Larry Bird. He has two titles to his name, an mvp, and will have much better longevity.   Uh, you know that Bird has three of each of those, right? Why do you think two titles and one MVP would possibly help Durant's case?"
"&gt;There’s non-Klutch players who have this payment plan as well.  Yep, OP's title is flat out wrong:  &gt;[Other known players in this select club include the Nets’ star duo of Kevin Durant \(repped by Rich Kleiman\) and Kyrie Irving \(Roc Nation\), Detroit’s Blake Griffin \(Jeff Schwartz and Sam Goldfeder\) and Chicago’s Otto Porter \(David Falk and Danielle Cantor\)](https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1245097933806002176)"

He, basically, played exactly how he looked (remember, he looked like a 45-year-old Turkish man with a cigarette habit).

They were suspiciously trigger-happy when he was on the court. Especially Shawne Williams and Wes Johnson. Contested three? No problem bro, we got your back.*  &gt; *The Lakers were making all sorts of ridiculous crap through the first three quarters.

being named Kevin Durant Durant Durant
It’s so ridiculous to say that Durant would be broken for being too fragile when the average player back then wasn’t nearly as good as the average player today.  Just because the rules in today’s game (like in almost every major sport now) are less physical doesn’t mean the athletes today would get broken.   Kevin Durant would eat in the 80s. They’re both all-time but are obviously different players.  It’s closer than you’re making it out to be.
"Having watched both of them in their respective eras, bird did a lot more, with a lot less.  Not discrediting Durant, he is one of the best scorers we have ever seen. Scorers...doesnt extend much beyond that.  Larry legend was a scorer, passer, defender, and a great competitor/team leader. All done back when the league was WAY more physical. Durant is fragile and would have been broken several times over. Larry's game would have translated to today's NBA, not the other way around.  Edit - some stats for you  Larry Bird - SUMMARY  Career  G  897  PTS  24.3  TRB  10.0  AST  6.3  Kevin Durant - SUMMARY  Career  G  849  PTS  27.0  TRB  7.1  AST  4.1   This is just the offensive side. Bird was one of the toughest defenders during his entire career, meanwhile Durant and defender arent mentioned in the same breath.   Durant is a premadonna teammate as well. There is a reason he never won in OKC, and only won with the warriors super team."
"He has to become Kevin Durant?Durant, so a name change would probably do"
 &gt; So it’s safe to say baring injury Kevin Durant is better than Larry Bird.   No it ain't no damn safe to say. you kiddin me?
"&gt; So it’s safe to say baring injury Kevin Durant is better than Larry Bird  Lol not even close. Larry Bird, in his prime (1981-1988 seasons), finished top 3 in NBA MVP voting every year. And won 3 straight. He also finished top 5 in his rookie year.... his injuries reduced his impact in his later years, but he had a ridiculously great career.  Durant isn't anywhere close to Bird yet.   And he's even further from LeBron.  To answer your question, KD would have to win 3 more MVPs, 2+ more titles with his own team (not riding the coattails of a historic team), and play great, dominant basketball for another 6+ years.   Not happening. And that's assuming LeBron doesn't win any more titles or MVPs."
Lol Kevin Durant fucking things up even when there's no season. Lol.
Why is he so mad at Kevin Durant?
They were a fun/great team that ran into Kevin Durant too often. I’d watch them over anyone.
"Patrick McCaw has 3 rings, more than allen iverson, carmelo Anthony, and kevin durant combined. Doesn't mean he's a hall of famer"
"he was more efficient relative to the league. from ben taylor:  "" In only 11 NBA seasons has someone scored over 30 per 75 at +6 percent rTS, and Jordan owns four of them (Karl Malone has two, Shaq, LeBron, Curry and Kevin Durant have one each). ""  and he was just as good, if not better in the playoffs which is nuts."

 Imagine the legacy of Curry if the warriors never got Thompson green or Durant. Likewise  imagine the career of Davis if he had gone to Cleveland instead of Kevin Love.   Luck is a huge part
"Australian consumer regulator throwing shade at Kemba, HB and Middleton:  &gt; ""The ACCC also considers that TEG Live may have misled consumers when it advertised the games using names and images of high profile USA players like LeBron James and Kevin Durant that did not ultimately play in the games, when it did not have reasonable grounds in most cases for representing to consumers they would play or be available to play.  &gt; “Over a year before the games, a 35-man squad was selected and TEG Live included the names and images of the majority of those players in its advertisements,” Mr Sims said.  &gt; “In the end, only four players from the 35-man squad, Harrison Barnes, Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton and Miles Turner, played in the games.”  &gt; **“We are concerned consumers may have purchased tickets believing many of these advertised high profile players would be playing when, in the end, this was not the case,” Mr Sims said.**"
"Also, a big thing about the league right now is each top team has a duo (two stars). Lakers have Lebron and Anthony Davis. Clippers have Kawhi and Paul George. Rockets have Harden and Russell Westbrook. Bucks have Giannis and Middleton.   There are also some really top players who are injured at the moment. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving"
"In the NBA, the Lakers and Celtics are always in style, and have been from the very beginning.   The Knicks have been suffering for 20 years, but are still a very popular team.   If you want to get on a hype-train at the right time, the Bucks are trending upwards. The Toronto Raptors are the defending champions, but  after the loss of superstar Kawhi Leonard, are not a favorite-- but still doing surprisingly well thanks to improvements from Pascal Siakam, Fred Van Vleet, and the reliable play of longtime Raptor Kyle Lowry.   The Warriors are a popular team having a down year, but might well bounce back next season. They have two of the best shooters in league history.   The Houston Rockets have offensive savant James Harden paired with another superstar, Russell Westbrook who is a walking triple double (pts, rebounds, assists). The LA Clippers have Kawhi Leonard (reigning Finals MVP) paired with star Paul George and some solid roleplayers.   New Orleans and Dallas are exciting young teams that should be fun to watch for a long time. Denver and Utah are solid teams.   The Spurs and Blazers are perennially great clubs having a rough year.   The Nets will be stronger next year with the return of Kevin Durant (two time finals mvp I think) and Kyrie Irving."
"The Warriors and the Cavs played each other in the Finals for 4 straight years, 2015-2018. Last year the Raptors won it against the Warroirs. This year before the season shut down, the Warriors and Cavs were both bad because Lebron left the Cavs and the Warriors top players, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, got hurt and Kevin Durant left. This year the topteams were the Lakers, with Lebron, the Clippers, and the Bucks. You can ask if theyre is anything else you want to know."
PG: Kemba Walker  SG: RJ Barrett?   SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Pascal Siakam  C: Joel Embiid
"KD, Kyrie and Harden. The only reprieve KD got from the constant hate over the last 4 years was when his brother was killed and the second time was after he tore his Achilles and the Raptors’ fans cheered. Then the hate went towards our coaching / medical staff and front office for rushing him back when they don’t even follow my team. KD got second opinions from his own camp after the initial calf strain and was aware of the risks. He confirmed as much [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-doesnt-blame-warriors-achilles-injury-nba-finals%3famp).  &gt;	“Hell, no. How can you blame [the Warriors]? Hell, no,” Durant told Haynes. “I heard the Warriors pressured me into getting back. Nobody never said a word to me during rehab as I was coming back. It was only me and [director of sports medicine and performance] Rick [Celebrini] working out every day. Right when the series started, I targeted Game 5. Hell, nah. It just happened.  &gt;	“It’s basketball. S--t happens. Nobody was responsible for it. It was just the game. We just need to move on from that s--t because I’m going to be back playing.”  Kyrie gets hate because his last year with the Celtics, his perception as a malignant, volatile locker room cancer and his pseudo-intellectual ramblings to the media. The problem is now people are constantly watching for him to say anything that can be misconstrued and twisted to fuel that idea.  Harden gets it because of his play style. When he retires or wins a ring he’ll get his love."
"Nah, it was obviously a BIO Weapon developed by Kevin Durant in order to a) come back in a fresh season and b) make this the toughest road possible. Open your eyes sheeple!!!!!"
"He’s slightly taller than LeBron, he’s basically 6’10”   https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard"
"https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/nba-official-player-heights-kevin-durant-lebron-james-anthony-davis-dwight-howard .  So you're mostly right, but he is an inch taller and it's interesting to see that Dwight, Anthony, and Durant are all basically the same height."
"Kevin Durant didn't play there that year, he had transferred."
Adam Morrison has won the same number of championships as Kevin Durant
And yet Russel Westbrook and Kevin Durant both said they loved it their. It doesn’t mean anything
"Assuming active,  Patrick Beverley  Kevin Durant  Russel Westbrook  Honorable Mention: Draymond Green and James Harden"
"I thought Durant was one of the top 5 defenders in the entire 2016 playoffs. LeBron/Kawhi/Green/Iggy/KD.  In fact that whole playoff run, one could make the argument that he provided more defense than offense.   KD can switch 1-4 &amp; can guard weak 5’s (Kevin Love). Is a good Rim protector &amp; When dialed Is good on help defense.   He’s not an elite defender but a Level below that. At his most dialed in, I’d say 2nd team all D."
Rockets really shut down the warriors offense. They made Kevin durant play a ton of hero and iso ball and it completely killed the motion offense they ran. KD was also a GARBAGE playmaker that series which really hurt the warriors offense when the rockets dared him to become a playmaker
"I feel like PJ Carlesimo was in the 2-3 range. He managed to make the playoffs with the Blazers post-Drexler, but he played KEVIN DURANT at the 2 guard."
"OKC has  had its fair share of heart break, turmoil and loss But Portland has had some really heartbreaking injuries, “what if’s”, and losses...   like “Kevin Durant leaving”, “ a nasty WCF flameout”, or “broken foot and sprained knee and missing the playoffs one year” wouldn’t be in the top 25 terrible things that happened to Portland or MOST teams   Obviously bitter and biased but The Thunder are the luckiest and most blessed fan base/ franchise"
Gary Payton  Ray Allen  Shawn Kemp  Jack Sikma  Fred Brown  Nate McMillan  Kevin Durant  Detlef Schrempf  Lenny Wilkins  Spencer Haywood
"Mainly just looking at Jordan’s / Lebron’s primary matchups.   Lebron had to go against Shawn Marion (people like to forget he was a 4x All Star), Kawhi Leonard twice, Kevin Durant twice, Andre Iguadala (2x All Defense). These were his primary matchups.   Yes, Jordan went against other Hall of Famers, but most of them were not his duty to guard, and they did not guard him. Scottie Pippen always held the best wing player. The best SG/SF Jordan faced head to head was Clyde Drexler who was out of his prime.  Again, I am not discredited Jordan, he is the Goat. But I think that’s mainly due to him being in an era where the PG and Center dominated the games. The best wing defender in the league was his teammate all those years."
"lol they were already in the conversation with those two, then they added Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant 'cause he's actually had seasons when he was a pretty good defender
"I don’t think it’s carelessness or that the lists are poorly thought out. There are straight up more than ten guys who have stacked cases for being top ten.  Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Jerry West(before you say anything, the dude is literally the NBA logo), Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson, and I could even understand a case for guys like John Stockton and Karl Malone.  That’s 15 dudes with solid cases for top ten and two with understandably solid cases as well."
"&gt;I would rank Larry higher because he had championships, finals mvps and mvps. He also had 12 years of elite play before injury. Which is why I keep saying finals MVPs isn’t the only determining factor.  Even if you take out those accolades, Larry Bird was straight up a far superior player because how dominant he was in his prime.  Also, Larry Bird had 9 years of elite play from the moment he joined NBA in 1979 until he broke his back in 1988, stripping away from him being an MVP player. I don't know where you get 12 years from lol.  &gt;Kevin Durant has been elite since 2009 and is younger than Curry. Just because I say Kevin Durant has better longevity, doesn’t mean Curry has shitty longevity. Like just because I say Larry is a ranked higher all time, doesn’t mean Kobe or Karl Malone are not all time greats.  Curry's peak is higher &amp; sustained it longer than KD who never really approached his level of impact outside of just pure scoring.    &gt;I agree. But when ranking all time players, finals mvp definitely is important. Look at the top 5 players and then look at how many finals mvps they have.  You can't bring up KD's Finals MVPs without mentioning how the Cavs were focusing on stopping Curry."
"&gt;	Again, would you rank lower than Larry Bird who peaked higher but either Karl Malone or Kobe Bryant despite having worse longevity?  I would rank Larry higher because he had championships, finals mvps and mvps. He also had 12 years of elite play before injury. Which is why I keep saying finals MVPs isn’t the *only* determining factor.   &gt;	Besides, Curry has been an All-NBA caliber player since 12/13 season. His longevity is decent IMHO.  Kevin Durant has been elite since 2009 and is younger than Curry. Just because I say Kevin Durant has better longevity, doesn’t mean Curry has shitty longevity. Like just because I say Larry is a ranked higher all time, doesn’t mean Kobe or Karl Malone are not all time greats.   &gt;	Winning regular season MVP is much more prestigeous.  I agree. But when ranking all time players, finals mvp definitely is important. Look at the top 5 players and then look at how many finals mvps they have."

"lebron if memphis got that 1st pick, they won 50 games the next year without adding a lottery player, have him next to Pau, runnin with white chocolate, bonzi, james posey, mike miller and shane battier? that would have been fun team to watch develop  also lebron with detroit, add him to that lineup that won in 04 anyway (assuming they still trade for sheed) daaaaang, billups, rip, bron, sheed, ben wallace, with tayshaun off the bench? that would ve been a squad  also carmelo with that detroit team  lamarcus aldridge, if bulls wouldnt have traded him, front court of him, deng, and tyson chandler would have been nice, with hinrich at pg  and then ben gordon plus hopefully any other shooting guard they couldlve added instead of ben wallace,   keith van horn if San Antonio wouldve got the send, worse for them then getting duncan, but for him better to go there than NJ   rubio if he wouldve got picked by knicks instead o wolves, would have come over right away, instead of stalled development in barca, wouldve been in a D'antoni offense, n had amare and gallinari n tyson chandler (not right then but shortly thereafter)  Durant to portland, wouldve slotted right next aldridge and brandon roy (already a 54 win team without him)  pau, one pick lower and he goes to chicago, teaming up with tyson chandler, hinrich and deng  darko, two picks lower and he goes to miami with odom, butler and wang zhizhi, with stan van gundy coaching a rebuild and not larry brown screwin up his career  kevin love- 1 pick higher n he goes to seattle to team up with durant (and presumably later harden), 2 picks lower he goes LAC n fits in better next to cp3 and deandre than blake did (though they were yet to be acquired)  gordon hayward and paul george- if either of them went 1 or 2 picks higher respectively they go to LAC and give them the SF they never had to run with cp3, blae and deandre (plus the shooting they needed) probably makes them a champion  brad beal, 1 pick lower n he's on cavs when bron comes back  kristaps, 1 pick higher and he goes to philly play inside out game with embiid  giannis, 1 pick higher and he slots in perfectly for utah playoff years before gordon hayward left  lauri markkanen, any other pick and he doesn't get the begining of his career shit on by the bulls   OG Anonuby, couple picks higher and he slots in perfectly on revamped oladipo pacers"

Kevin Durant would've taped his eyes wide open
"Nah, one does not simply clamp Kevin Durant"
"NBA: “come watch NBA players play 2K against each other!”   *5 minutes into Kevin Durant and Derrick Jones happening  NBA: “Shit, How do we get people to forget this ever happened?”"
"I don't necessarily disagree, but a lot of the talk around them has been with injury luck. 2019 certainly fights back against that narrative. But to line up a team through drafting, score big with Bogut, Iggy, and eventually Kevin Durant, as well as facing advantages with injuries in the playoffs, there had to be some luck. There's always a little luck involved."
"Wasn't very creative, but it really shed light on how lethal even the worst shooters in the NBA can be in practice. Rondo averaged 21% from 3 in 2010, but he's going toe to toe with Kevin Durant from behind the arch like it's nothing."
"He spent the majority of his minutes as the 5. Especially after 2003. Duncan as a 4 in todays NBA would not be utlilizing his skills properly. He could reliably stretch the floor out to \~18 feet. That wouldn't cut it for a PF in todays game. He often times started the game with another 5 (Rasho Nesterovic, Fabricio Oberto, Tiago Splitter) but they played 15-20 MPG. Duncan was for all intents and purposes San Antonio's 5, especially defensively, where he was an anchor and rim protector.   In regards to Dirk, have you never seen young Dirk? He was super quick. Near Kevin Durant levels. He would take elite defenders off the dribble and get to the basket. If you don't think young Dirk was quick, I don't know what to tell you."
"Sorry, but the championship argument is horrible.  Is Durant not a superstar? He only became a champion after he joined one of the best teams of all time.  Was Kevin Garnett not a superstar? He only became a champion after he joined the boston big 3 in his 30s.  Was Karl Malone not a superstar? Charles Barkley? Allen Iverson?"
"An important note left off by OP, he is not counting contract extensions ""like John Wall, Andrew Wiggins, Kevin Love, Eric Gordon or CJ McCollum"" and also ""left out situations where a player’s remaining season or two on a contract might not project to deliver value, but previous seasons had. That would exclude the likes of Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and Mike Conley"" and ""Finally, I want to set aside a few injury cases. In particular, your feelings on the contracts of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving depend in large part on how much you think they can stay on the court""  So keep in mind he's already excluding a lot of the big names that are normally in this conversation."

"Hmm??? Exactly — solidarity with the protestors, this movement is more important than this game. Black lives matter.  It’s this sort of argument that shows just his silly using the NBA as a voice for a movement that is much more radical than the NBA is so facetious.  “A brief history of black nationalism and it’s discontents, brought to you by Kevin Durant.” “James Baldwin and the question of self-determination — a children’s story by Steph Curry.” “From black nationalism to internationalism — the story of Malcolm X, narrated by Lebron James.” “Angela Davis — black radical or cointelpro plant — a discussion with Kyrie Irving.”  I’d love to see it, and I’m sure some NBA players are reading Baldwin (Trae and Jaylen I speculate ;)), but imagine Disney giving a serious platform to this movement."
Kevin Durant signing with the dubs
"I understand his reasoning, but something tells me if the Nets were 1st-2nd seed and Kevin Durant was playing - he wouldn’t risk his chance of getting a championship."
Kevin Durant is the best offensive player on this list. Almost 7’0 with great handles and such a damn smooth shot. I miss this cupcake 😥
"Top 3 player? Robertson was lucky to have top 100 players. Steph had 2 all-stars and a borderline all-star in his unluckiest year. Add kevin Durant, and he still has 2 all-stars and a borderline all-star plus you know, a friggin MVP potential player by his side.  Barkley literally had crap players his entire career and he carried them to a finals appearance. He was doubled just like Curry was, his team just couldn't bail him out like Curry's could.  And Durant had lebron James on him for both those finals. Not quite just ""one guy."" I really think that's an important distinction."
"Steph Curry, Paul Pierce, Kevin Durant (and others) all finished top 25 seven times. But it seems that the model should take into account where in the top 25 they finished. In other words, if someone finished #25 seven times and someone else finished #1–5 seven times, shouldn't that change the data somehow?"
Rookie Kevin Durant who can’t do a push-up: “that dude is skinny”

"If we want to be super technical with the term then the worst shot selector is one of Stephen Curry, Trae Young, Damian Lillard or Kevin Durant. They all consistently take ridiculous shots. Curry launches from the logo at will. So does Trae. Dame does stepback logo threes in playoff buzzer beater attempts. Durant takes way too many contested awkward mid range / long twos.  A regular player should never attempt such shots. They attempt those regularly.  They obviously make them at ridiculous clips and this is why they are who they are. But again, if we want to be super technical about the term, their shot selection is atrocious."
I’m pretty sure BLM is against police using drones and facial recognition because it can lead to further abuses of power. I don’t really have a view on the other stuff. Kevin Durant funding somehting like they probably doesn’t sit well with the cause.
"So we have:   Blackwater Halliburton Agent Kevin Durant.   Flat-Earther and Self-Dubbed MLKII Kyrie Irving.   GoFundMe Icon Spencer Dinwiddie.   X-Force’s StrongGuy aka Wilson Chandler.

"John Wall, Kevin Durant and Kevin Garnett"
"Steph also had a few good defenders around him like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, and Iguodala. Livingston, Looney, and Bogut were all good defenders as well. Tbh, thats part of the reason why so many people viewed him as such a bad defender. Realistically who are you going to try to target in those line ups."

"Not really dude. It's the same pedantic bullshit that gets played out again and again to make these celebrities look the same as us.  This sub is so full of bullshit hero worship that they cant see the truth around the ten inch dick their sucking.   Like this comment. Shit like this has been said time and time again about lebron. It was said especially frequently during the hong kong protests and Lebrons reaction to them.  Many commenters complained about the frequent Hong Kong posting and complaining, ""why should lebron make a statement? This shit doesnt affect him.""/ ""you wouldnt risk your job to help china, so why should lebron?""  I HATE that shit. I hate when fans place fans on the same level as these guys. We aren't. We cant do any shit. It doesnt matter if you or I say something about China, it wont be heard outside our neighborhoods. Lebron James would be heard on fucking mars.  And this goes beyond politics and lebron. I feel the same for Kevin durant going to the Ws. Everytime people post shit bout KD, you always get one bullshit commenter chiming in, ""hey it's a job to him! Shouldn't you be allowed to move locations if you want""  As if kevin Durant's moving did not affect millions upon millions of people and him switching jobs is fundamentally different than me switching from taco bell to KFC.  It is just my opinion, and I know it's an opinion, that when you have a certain amount of power and influence, you need to be responsible with that power and influence and wield it smartly.  As uncle ben said, with great power comes great responsibility.  KD had a huge amount of power in his decision to switch teams, but felt he had no responsibility: to his fans, to OKC, to the league, to his fellow players, to anyone. So he made the selfish decision.  Lebron james has a huge amount of power. Like astronomical. He is probably in the top 20 most powerful people in the USA. His responsibility to speak up and talk and respond is so drastically different than me or you or anybody on r/nba.  So when I see a comment like, lebron james is exactly like r/nba. I get frustrated. I get frustrated that the illusion is working and that these ultra rich millionaires and billionaires are masquerading as common folk and all us idiots will do is eat up.   So yeah. You were probably right. I am just an angry old man yelling at the screen. I just wish people realize that the world changes when you have power and influence. Your role changes."
"My first thought was that a guy like Lou Williams or Victor Oladipo would be lethal if they had all that speed and those moves at 6'6.  &amp;#x200B;  But imagine a 7'1 Kevin Durant who can shoot over anybody fast enough to guard him, or just dribble around anybody tall enough to guard him.   That, or a 7'2 Giannis who would be even more unstoppable in the paint, has to be my answer."
Since Kevin Durant invented sucking dick.
"Kevin Durant is top 10 all time to me. Everyone is pissed about his weak move to golden state but I guarantee you if they weren’t he’d be unanimous top 10 all time. Moving teams doesn’t bring you lower on the all time ranking ladder, you’re just as good of a player. I’d argue he has potential to be top 6 all time once he’s done."
"In my top 10 rankings I don’t list super old players such as Wilt Chamberlain or Bill Russell. It’s flat out impossible to compare them to players later on. If they were here today and did the stuff they did back then, they’d be the goats, but they aren’t because of an impossible to measure “early era” argument.  Kevin Durant is top 10 all time to me. Everyone is pissed about his weak move to golden state but I guarantee you if they weren’t he’d be unanimous top 10 all time. Moving teams doesn’t bring you lower on the all time ranking ladder, you’re just as good of a player. I’d argue he has potential to be top 6 all time once he’s done."
"With the game slowed down, IN the Half court SPECIFICALLY:  Kevin Durant  Kyrie Irving  Kemba Walker  Chris Paul   LeBron James"
"Booker was a hard midrange shooter this season.  21% of his shots came from 10-16, of which he made 47.2% of them.  For reference, Kevin Durant, who is IMO the current midrange king, has 18.6% of his shots coming from this range, shooting at a 45.7% clip over his career.  KD's highest volume season though is still not reached by Book at 23.8% of his shots from 10-16 and made 51.7% of them (fucking nuts)."
Lebron stopped being the best player in the world after 2016. Kevin Durant and Kawhi took over from there on out.
yeah literally every other aspect of that finals would be a moot point if HB is just normal bad instead of Kevin Durant in Thunderstruck bad.
"I watched a couple of Warriors/Thunder games a few weeks ago (Curry game winner in OT, Klay 11 threes playoff game). what stuck out to me like a sore thumb was that the Thunder would take forever to get into their offense and their shots weren't high quality at all, whereas the Warriors got into their offense quickly and took their time to find the best possible shot. Stuff like that, plus making effort/hustle plays (Thunder players were absolutely lackadaisical at the end of Game 6, resulting in costly turnovers), running more creative sets than the Thunder, having better reserves and role players - that made all the difference for the Warriors.  Watching those two games alone makes you appreciate just how hard it is to reach the Finals, because you have to be top-tier everything - players, coaching staff, management, etc. You slip up on some of those things like the Thunder did, and suddenly you're not good enough. It also shows how lazy the ""They were up 3-1!"" take is, since it disregards the true natures of those teams: the Thunder were a very streaky team that season, the Warriors were just flat out better than the Thunder and wanted to go to the Finals more badly, and that showed itself by the end of that infamous WCF series.  I was initially on the ""fuck Kevin Durant"" train, but as the Thunder continued to fizzle out in the first round despite getting Paul George, it became pretty clear to me that KD not only did what was best for him, he also dodged a bullet. Russell Westbrook was declining athletically, the supporting cast wasn't getting any better (ie. the Trail Blazers exposed them for being awful at shooting the ball), and there was no real way for Presti to improve the team because the team was capped out. All those management mistakes, like trading Harden, drafting bust after bust, and acquiring below-mediocre veterans to fill out the bench and call it a day, had caught up to the Thunder eventually.  Harsh truth, I know, but that's the way it is... \*shrug\*"
"&gt;Steph Curry may have been the best player on the Warriors (obviously was) before Kevin Durant arrived, but those titles were truly team titles. There was no Alpha. There was no give him the ball down the stretch and let him go to work guy. That may not be popular with Warrior fans but it's just true. Steph Curry is not leading an average championship cast to a title."
Kevin Durant is straight up delusional. He said that he thought winning a title with the warriors would prove he’s better than lebron when the warriors had been within a game (with 3 tries) of winning it the year before and had the year before that. All he proved is that he is better than Harrison Barnes.
"He’s obviously a franchise player. Even with Kevin Durant on the team, the Warriors were pedestrian whenever Curry sat and all-time elite when he played."
"Steph Curry may have been the best player on the Warriors (obviously was) before Kevin Durant arrived, but those titles were truly team titles. There was no Alpha.

"‘70s - Walt Frazier, beautiful to watch, sneaky athletic with acceleration/deceleration, he won titles, played with a unique grace and always killed my team 80s - Charles Barkley, started in 84 but he was just unbelievably good. My buddies and I would ask “He’s too short and too fat, how can he keep doing this? I fucking hate this guy!” And he always killed my team. 90’s Jordan came to my squad for the end of his career so he’s out therefore it’s Olajuwon. So skilled, and great to watch because he played a pure clean game. He defended well without fouling, never flopped or whined and he always killed my team. 00s - Tim Duncan is the all time most underrated player. Sure he’s respected but he should be right up there with Lebron and Bird. And that modest SOB silently destroyed my team over and over. 10s - Kevin Durant - Yeah, he went to the Warriors and doubtlessly became the best and most important player on that roster. Come home to DC, Kevin! And stop destroying my poor team, please. Now - Nicola Jokic, his skills are astounding and just as importantly, he wins. He’s young and the future looks pretty damn good. His facilitating is already legendary but he can get buckets too, especially when the game is on the line. He plays a “sustainable” game that doesn’t leave him vulnerable to injury And he does it all like he’s clad in flip-flops. So much fun he’s made the Nuggets my league pass team of choice. Plus he always beats my team"
"Well since ball handling includes handles, yes. Kevin Durant has the best handles of any 6’8+ player ever"
"Aang: Steph baby faced assassin and very free flowly (Air) Korra:  more Luka fresh face and mastered a lot early on in his career but needs to improve on one thing really (Defense) Sokka: Jared Dudley.

"Keep holding out on him, that’s what I said. It’s in pretty clear English.  He had a decent season, that’s awesome, he had one two years ago too, and then stepped backwards. He makes boneheaded moves and has a bad IQ on the floor, he’s like if Kevin Durant had the mind of Javale McGee."
I heard Simmons and Jalen talking about him a few days ago. They called him the Kevin Durant of his era. I never watched Gervin play but that is very high praise.
Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
"This is the most ridiculous thing I've read lol. So all the players they had pre pandemic were chumps? Should I name a few? Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Steph curry, Kobe, D Wade.   Do you have any numbers that actually prove more people have started listening to it? Because [according to this](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/03/it-appears-people-staying-at-home-all-the-time-is-bad-news-for-podcasting/) podcast listening has gone down since the pandemic."
Did Zach Lowe make this post and Kevin Durant us all?
Kevin Durant went off and it was only a 5 point game  Imagine being this mad when your team has hardly done anything as long as the Raptors have existed  Imagine being seeded below us
"&gt;the SF role  This doesn't exist anymore. ""SF"" is a loose term used for defensive assignments, it has no basis in offensive roles whatsoever.   &gt;he should be able to guard 1 to 4 at least  Not likely, his height isn't a big deal but that 6'9"" wing span is nothing to write home about. As of now I would say he's projected to be able to guard 1-2 1/2, meaning he should be able to guard all guards reasonably well, and most small forwards, but guys like Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard will just shoot over him. He can probably put up a fight on switches and for limited minutes, but he should not be looked at as a long term answer for elite small forwards, let alone power forwards like AD and Giannis."
I bet if kevin durant was playing he wouldnt be saying much.  You can negotiate things like a blm patch on to all jerseys. Get to worming on 30 second to 1 minute segments about covid and social injustice. Push lebrons black voter initiative. Talk about how the government needs to do something about police brutality. Yea people will become focused on the gameplay but if you hammer them with lots of info the players can continue to grow as leaders of society too.   Sitting this season out might hurt some rich billionaires but at the same time it could be hundreds of millions of free advertising for the movement. I just have a feeling that the billions lost still wouldnt be enough for real change. But getting people informed and having a platform to do so can keep people hyped up to vote as we get closer to the election.
How is Brandon Roy on this list over Kevin Durant?
Lol why would Kyrie lead this call of all people? If Kevin Durant was healthy and they had a shot at the title he would not be saying any of this. Kyrie is fake.
In no particular order:  - Carmelo Anthony - Kobe Bryant - Chris Bosh - Tim Duncan - Kevin Durant - Dwight Howard - LeBron James - Dirk Nowitzki - Chris Paul - Dwyane Wade
Kevin Durant was definitely a top 10 player by this point already
Kyrie Irving - Idiot  CP3 - Retiring in 2-3 years. Paid man  Kevin Durant - Kevin Durant   I know Carmelo and Dwight are probably just mentioned because of name recognition and Mitchell is the first player to really come out with anger because of COVID -19.  Idk why would anyone who isn't retiring soon or guaranteed to make max money ever want this (90% of the league). Even young stars should want to play cause the next cba gonna be wild.   Use your mic. You got an opportunity here if you do it right.
"Lmao have you ever been on twitter? LeBron still gets more shit than anyone not named Kevin Durant  I support players using their voices. With that said, I do not understand how boycotting this season is productive for the movement"
"""In order to guard him, or at least attempt to guard him, you had to do your work early. That meant getting back on defense quickly and trying to meet him at the free throw line. From there, you’d basically brace yourself for impact in a collision that you were physically incapable of winning."" -Nazr Mohammed on Shaq  ""My first impression of Yao was 'Who the fuck is this?' because he came in and I tried to hit him with a smooth finger roll move - block - next play down I tried to hit him with a fadeaway - block - next play I tried to come up and dunk - block - first guy to block my shot three times in a row - so definitely the first guy where I had to change how I played against him; and he's also the first guy to get it, turn around, look me right in the face, and just shoot right over me."" -Shaq  “I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson’s face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he’d look at me like he was bored. Whenever I run into a Tim Duncan fan who will claim Tim Duncan is the GOAT, I won’t disagree with him.” -Shaq  ""It’s like, he can post you up because he’s seven. He can dunk on you because he’s seven. And he can shoot over you — he’ll be like, 'You’re there? Don’t care … still shooting.' And there’s nothing you can do about it."" -Jimmy Butler on Kevin Durant  ""He’s one of those guys you want to match up with because you measure yourself against him. Like, if you can best LeBron, you’re doing something right. And if you can’t, it’s just because you’re human, like the rest of us."" -Jimmy Butler  ""He's so good. He's so good. He's so good. He's so good."" - LeBron on Jason Tatum  ""Did dis dude just did dis?"" - John Starks on Reggie Miller"
Ok Kevin Durant
"After the whole “I’m Kevin Durant” Pat Bev thing, Bev went on ESPN after the series and literally called him the best player in the world. Said he saw something and snatched it like a killer. Said he ain’t ever see anything like it."
Kevin Durant lookin ass
[KEVIN DURANT FROM WAY DOWNTOWN](https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/durant-save.gif)
"Kevin ""Stephen Curry"" Durant"
Position: Small Forward  Height: 6”9  Strength: LeBron  Shooting: Stephen Curry  Dunking: Zion  Mid-range: Kevin Durant  Finishing: LeBron  Paint game: Shaq  Handles: Kyrie Irving  Shot-blocking ability: Hakeem  Rebounding: Dennis Rodman  Passing: LeBron  Defense: Giannis  Stealing: Kawhi  Speed: Russell Westbrook  Mentality: Michael Jordan  BBall IQ: Lebron James  Stamina: LeBron  Name: Chris Smoove
"This just seems like an unfair qualifier, Cassell and Big Dog were good players but it’s not like we’re talking about Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson here. Is he supposed to carry a 20 win team to the finals? Because that’s basically what you’re getting around him without Cassell and Big Dog. Every single player except probably LeBron needs some semblance of talent around him to get deep in the playoffs and especially the finals. Hypotheticals where we take away the 2nd and 3rd best players on teams to devalue certain accomplishments don’t seem fair."
Kevin Durant combined with Shaq. Plus Jason Williams.
"Okay, but who’s the Pete Campbell of the NBA? Kevin Durant?"
2009-10 Scoring Champ: Kevin Durant 2010-11 Scoring Champ: Kevin Durant 2011-12 Scoring Champ: Kevin Durant  If LeBron and KD were on the same team they would prob win a ring every season. It’s not close.
Christian Wood and Peak Kevin Durant
"I'd be interested to see that lineup of:  Kyrie Irving   Danny Green   Caris LeVert  Kevin Durant   DeAndre Jordan  With a bench of Garrett Temple, Joe Harris, Kyle Kuzma, Wilson Chandler and Jarrett Allen."
"Aside from Kyrie, I don’t really agree with your list. Harden, Draymond, and LeBron are all heavily respected by their peers and do a good job elevating the play of those around them. Simmons by all accounts seems like a pretty nice guy. My list is as follows:  1. Kyrie - history of chemistry issues and has been known to call out teammates, as well as demanding the ball and a high usage rate.  2. Chris Paul - he has a certain attitude that works well with some but rubs others the wrong way. History of chemistry issues in both LA and Houston and while his play certainly elevated those around him, his on-the-court antics and tendency to criticize teammates is a lot to deal with.  3. Paul George - this might be a more controversial pick and nothing against his personality, seems like a pretty chill guy. His history of requesting trades over the past several years would make me very wary if I were a teammate, as I would always be wondering when he will jump ship next.  4. Kevin Durant - a member of the All-NBA Grumpy Boi First Team, Durant’s inability to feel fulfilled and overall on the court attitude combined with his constant online confrontations and occasional on-the-court arguments with teammates would leave a sour taste in my mouth if I were his teammate.  5. Rajon Rondo - his effort fluctuates based on his mood and it feels like coaches have played him more than he deserves over the past several years. That plus his combative tendencies would make him a difficult teammate to have.   Honorable Mention: Jimmy Butler - after the Timberwolves debacle I was ready to write him up as one of the worst teammates in the league but it seems like he has found a group of guys that he vibes with in Miami."
"Larry Bird 1984-1988: 27.3/9.8/6.8 1.8 steals and .9 blocks. His shooting slash .526/.400/.899. He won the MVP in 84, 85 and 86. Won the Finals MVP  in 1984 and 1986. He was a 5x All NBA 1st Team selection, a 5x All Star and was a 2nd Team All Defense in 1984.   I’m not sure how you’d define Durants “peak”. His numbers were statistically better earlier in his career, but I choose to do the closest comparison age wise. Bird’s covers 27-31. Durant 26-30.   Kevin Durant 2015-2019: 26.3/7.3/5.2 .9 steals and 1.3 blocks. His shooting slash .580/.386/.884. He was a 2x Finals MVP, 5x All Star, 4x All NBA (Three 2nd Team, One 1st Team.   To me, Bird has the better peak, but it’s closer than I thought it was."
"Kevin Durant won the scoring title/averaged 30/won MVP while putting up 50/40/90.  KD only hit 50/40/90 once. And that year he averaged 28ppg, did not in the scoring title (Melo), or win mvp (LeBron)."
"Some of you guys forget that we've seen them both on the same team in their primes and the best player, especially in the post season, was Kevin Durant. If we're specifically talking 1 year peak then 2016 Curry makes this a more interesting conversation."
"Probably not even top 100 to be honest, here are 50 players without much thought:  1.	Ray Allen 2.	Clyde Drexler 3.	Kevin McHale 4.	Elgin Baylor 5.	Artis Gilmore 6.	Paul Pierce 7.	Jason Kidd 8.	Walt Frazier 9.	John Havlicek 10.	Bob Pettit 11.	Reggie Miller  12.	Rick Barry 13.	Patrick Ewing 14.	John Stockton 15.	Moses Malone 16.	Scottie Pippen 17.	Dwyane Wade 18.	Kevin Durant 19.

I remember those games slightly lowered my interest in /r/nba for awhile lol couldn’t even post shit on here! Then we got Kevin Durant goddamn Christmas in July and I had the biggest boner when I logged back in.
Kevin Durant is an NBA champion. How quickly they forget...   https://youtu.be/YVsah5EBKuI
"wrong. those rings only mean ""nothing"" to kevin durant if you wanna feel that way. sayings a teams rings aren't worth anything just because that team was so much better than every other team is dumb. if we use your logic, then any time there was a sweep in the finals, that ring shouldnt be worth anything. yall just hate the warriors, and thats why you think their rings arent worth anything"
"Yeah, it's hard to understand why people dislike a 73 win team that brought Kevin Durant in.  And here you are saying ""LeBron is 1-3"".  That's the entire point, no one gives a shit about what they did when they signed Durant.  Of course they won.  Everyone knew they would win.  That's exactly why people hate them. Sports aren't that fun to watch when the mismatch is a bigger story than the actual game."
"Surprise surprise I'm getting downvoted , and one more thing you can't hate us for having Kevin Durant , what did you expect him to do during free agency ? , To go to a shittier team ? Would you do that ?"
Plot twist. OP is Kevin Durant.
"These are my criterion:   - Be an MVP in your prime, and/or a perennial MVP candidate.  - Lead your team deep into the playoffs regularly (e.g., a 1st option on a championship contender).  - Elevate your game vs the best.  - Have an All-NBA 1st team selection in your prime.  - Regularly lead your team to top 4 seed, i.e., contribute to winning basketball.  - Be a franchise player.   The more boxes they check, the greater the Superstar. For example, I value about 6-8 players as Superstars, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t sub tiers within them. Like I ain’t crazy to say Damian Lillard (who I consider a Superstar) is equal to Kevin freaking Durant 🤣🤣"
"Assuming he’s a Seattle sports fan in general. I would say:  Me: Hey man you’re finally up. You’ve been in a coma for 13 years.   Friend: wow that’s scary to think about. What’s new?   Me: what do you want to know about first?   Friend: let’s go with sports.  Me: ok good news, The Seahawks won the super bowl in 2013,   Friend: yay! What about the Mariners? Did they win a World Series while I was gone?   Me: hell no! They haven’t even been to the post season since then.  Friend: oh. Well what about the Sonics? That Kevin Durant kid looked promising in the last game I saw him play in.   Me: oh yeah. Durant is amazing. He’s a 10 time all star. 1 time mvp. And lead the golden state warriors to back to back champions in 2017 and 18.  Friend: oh the Sonics didn’t keep him? That’s a shame.   Me: technically.....he and two other future mvps lead the franchise to the finals in 2012.   Friend: Awesome.....wait, why did you say ‘technically’?   Me: yeah, about that..........."
Plot twist: OP is a Kevin Durant burner account.
"&gt;Ah, classic Celtics fan  This is the Raptor cliche I've picked up on recently.    In the past three days. Toronto fans have told me:  * ""Clearly you do think the world revolves around the Celtics"" - Because I mentioned Kyrie's time in Boston in a thread that showed a clip of Kyrie's time in Boston.  * ""It’s only Celtic fans who are delusional about Bird. Most overrated player ever"" - Because I suggested that Larry Bird was better than Kevin Durant and he would have been a better fit on a team full of superstars.   Boston does have rivalries with other teams that spill over into fan interactions, but whenever someone tries to call out ""Celtic fan cliches"" you can be guaranteed they're a Toronto fan.  **e:** not saying it's all Toronto fans, just something I've noticed recently."
"Don't think you want him to be jacked, so much of his game is finesse and quickness. You want him looking more like Kevin Durant as opposed to Andre Iguodala"
This whole strawman of people accusing the Warriors of cheating is what KD stans use to deflect the fact that Kevin Durant made the softest move in NBA history by joining a 73 win team that he blew a 3-1 lead to in the conference finals
I never said to rank him ahead of Kevin Durant.  I’m just saying Kawhi’s been a MVP-level player since 2016
Curry is older than Kevin Durant!
"I always thought Kevin Durant was older than Steph.  I feel he was in the NBA for like forever, until he joined the Warriors!"
In no specific order:  Lebron James  Kevin Durant  Larry Bird  Julius Erving  Elgin Baylor   Paul Pierce  Kawhi Leonard  Rick Barry  Scottie Pippen   James Worthy/Vince Carter
Damn Kevin Durant would probably help the Warriors win rings every year barring injury.
Maybe the Nets? We may be able to put together a persuasive package for Kevin Durant.
*Kevin Durant begins sweating profusely*
"00s  - Kobe Bryant (Rest In Peace)  - LeBron James  - Tim Duncan  - Shaquille O’Neal   10s  - LeBron James  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - Kawhi Leonard   It’s tough, especially for the 00s. You could put Allen Iverson, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Garnett, but who do you leave out?"
"Western Conference time!  **Nuggets** - Don't trade Donovan Mitchell on draft night in 2017.  **Timberwolves** - Draft Steph Curry and DeMar Derozan in 2009 instead of Rubio and Flynn.  **Thunder** - Ideally tell Clay Bennett to not be a cheapskate and pay the luxury tax.  Alternatively, trade Serge Ibaka instead of James Harden.  **Trail Blazers** - Draft Kevin Durant instead of Greg Oden in 2007.  **Jazz** - Drafting Chris Paul instead of Deron Williams in 2005 is probably the single biggest change they could make, but considering Paul v Williams was a genuine debate in their primes I'm not too sure how effective that is.  Assuming they keep the same draft picks in the 2008 draft, drafting Serge Ibaka or DeAndre Jordan over Kosta Koufus could have a profound effect.  **Clippers** - Probably continuing to tank in the really 00's instead of becoming a late lottery so they could get one the big talents from the 03 draft (James, Wade, Anthony, Bosh).  **Suns** - Don't trade their 2004 draft pick and draft Andre Iguodala with it, then don't trade Joe Johnson in 2005.  **Kings** - Similar to the Wizards, the Kings can try and replicate the Warriors by drafting Steph in 2009, then depending on their draft position in 2011 and 2012, draft Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, then eventually hire Steve Kerr.  **Rockets** - draft Jokic instead of Capela in 2014.  **Grizzlies** - Draft Steph Curry or James Harden instead of Hasheem Thabeet in 2009.  **Pelicans** - It was tough deciding whether Paul or Davis was the better building block, but I went with Davis.  In 2012, draft Evan Fournier instead of Rivers.  In 2013, don't trade their pick and take Giannis.  In 2014, they still have 10th pick - as they didn't trade it and Giannis hasn't developed yet - which they should trade down for a late-1st and early 2nd round (i.e. the Utah Jazz's 23rd and 35 pick) and take Rodney Hood and Nikola Jokic respectively.  Coaching-wise, hire Jason Kidd once Monty Williams leaves (again, Giannis credits him for his growth), but ditch him in 2018 if he can't get the team to the conference finals (i.e. what the Bucks did to him).  As none of these transactions affect the trades which landed the Pelicans Evans and Gordon, they should have a core of Gordon - Evans - Giannis - Davis - Jokic with Founier and Hood coming off the bench."
Kevin Durant but seriously I think they are not gonna trade him. They wanna make him into a good player.
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12596449/kevin-durant-says-love-stick-oklahoma-city-thunder-whole-career
It’s close to impossible for Giannis to be on the Warriors with Klay and Steph. Giannis on a max with Klay and Steph doesn’t even allow them to fill out the rest of the roster without hitting the hard cap. It would have to be a sign and trade with Klay going to the Bucks and Wiggins going to a team with no money coming back.  [Slater (Warriors/The Athletic) laid out why Giannis to the Warriors is close to impossible](https://theathletic.com/1809588/2020/05/14/the-warriors-path-to-giannis-is-far-less-plausible-than-it-was-to-kevin-durant/?amp#click=https://t.co/yYNbJ2lYU4)
It took prime Steph Curry/Kevin Durant teaming up to take down LeBron.
Then use the Kevin Durant talisman for invisibility
I heard that voters were split between McCaw and LeBron for the 2018 FMVP so they gave it to Kevin Durant to make sure a Warrior got it
Kevin Durant lead the warriors to a championship the same way I lead my dog to the dog park. By being dragged along lmao.
"IMO Kevin Durant was hitting the same level as Lebron, but Lebrons ring with the Cavs followed by KD leaving to the Warriors made it so the narrative completely switched back to Lebron&gt;KD.   Now that KD is going to come back from a major injury, I doubt we are going to see him as the best player in the world anymore as well."
"&gt;Would KD still outplay Lebron?  Probably not but I still think there’s a chance he could have. I’m not even a KD fan I’m a Lebron fan. But even look at the 2012 finals and You can argue Durant was keeping pace with Lebron. In terms of the things needed to singlehandedly bring a team to the top, like the passing, off ball defense, leadership, then that’s where Kevin Durant is clearly not as good. But in this instance of having four other all time payers, I think Durant is as good of a fit as you can get.  Yeah Bird is considered one of the greatest shooters of all time but that’s because he was the best of his era. So people consider him relative to his era rather than pluck him into this one (rightly so). But a player like Damian Lillard has already surpassed Larry Bird in terms of shooting ability. For example Davis Bertans is shooting way better than Larry bird would if you just picked him and plucked him into this era. Obviously if he grew up and trained in this era it would be a different conversation, but if you’re talking a mid 80s Larry Bird or 2017 KD, I would take 2017 KD"
"Dominique Wilkins did come back good from a ruptured achilles tho. Yeah I would take AD too, but only because of age, give me prime Kevin Durant over AD any day of the week."
Kevin Durant
"Probably not.  By the way, I love Kevin Durant and I think he’s top 10 all time"
"&gt; Unpopular opinion, but Kevin Durant.  Not so much unpopular as just dumb and wrong."
"I mean, he also doesn't give a fuck about your feelings. At the end of the day you're still you and he's Kevin Durant lol."
The one that’s not the Kevin Durant title
"Unpopular opinion, but Kevin Durant. Both Curry and Klay molded the team from the ground up and stayed consistent the whole time. Durant joined midway through, without the Splash Bros there would’ve been nothing."
"According to BMI, Kevin Durant is overweight.   Your point that it's only inaccurate for extremely muscular people is disproven with that one fact."
Ever heard of Kevin Durant
Larry Bird and Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
What does Kobe Bryant do for this lineup better than Kevin Durant and Larry Bird?     My current lineup is Lebron/Jordan/Durant/Bird/Garnett.
"Zion, Shaq, Lowry.  Jk, maybe Kevin Durant or Chris Boucher, Ingram?"
"It’s hilarious how you keep inventing new narratives in your head comment after comment, &amp; when you’re pressed about these narratives you create new ones to back up your claim. You kept harping about OKCs transition offense benefiting KD but when I mentioned how Harden benefits from the same transition O in 15/16, you falsely claimed Harden creates all of those opportunities &amp; even more egregiously claimed Westbrook is creating all transition opportunities for Durant. &amp; Then you followed it up with something about KD’s handles being the reason for harden being better in transition....  This is KD in transition, He doesn’t rely on anyone for transition opportunities,  he’s one of the best in the league at going coast to coast. https://youtu.be/UMCB9JKtMnY  I’m pretty sure KD also generates more PPP in transition than both harden and Westbrook year in year.  You also still are sooo fixated on transition when it’s only FOURTEEN % of the offense in the reg ssn or playoffs give or take. The majority of the offense is played in the half court in isolation, off screens, Off PnR, postups, etc. OKC historic lack of floor spacing negated KD’s ability to be as efficient as possible with Zero shooters on the weakside or helpside, while Harden has had far more help there as an iso scorer.  Transition offense in the NBA is about leveraging Momentum, not about handles in tight spaces, it about speed in the open court, and having a good handle in space....all of which KD has in abundance. Guys like LeBron/GiannisKD have advanced handles in space &amp; leverage their momentum to finish efficiently.....KD doesn’t rely on Westbrook or anyone for transition O. He can go coast to coast himself.  https://youtu.be/JHFItX-oyx4  Kevin Durant is a much better transition player than Harden (&amp;Westbrook). Not only does he have a far better catch radius, He’s also much faster in open space with and without the ball &amp; he finishes at the rim better than both.  I think you’re still focusing too much on transition offense, when it’s still a minuscule part of not only regular season but playoff offense. Majority of playoff offense is played in halfcourt. The entire discussion is about what value Westbrook or OKCs perimeter  players add when KD has the ball in his hands in a standstill position, and that answer is negative value.  Not only do they have little Offball gravity, they have anti gravity. Teams don’t respect on them weakside which is extremely difficult for an iso scorer, no matter who in league history. It’s also a fact good defensive teams limit transition O  “In 17/18 harden faced the Goat Team”  He shot 54TS against the Jazz with a 5-out offense the series before the warriors. His teammate was far more efficient than him.  In the 2017 playoffs, Harden played with Ryan Anderson/Ariza/Gordon/Beverly. Teams don’t help off of them.  Harden always plays with 3 great floor spacers on the weakside so he can go 1v1. So does LBJ/and all the other great iso scorers. In OKC, KD simply wasn’t afforded that luxury, Just zero perimeter threat aside from harden off the bench for 1/2 years. The very limited transition offense (14% freq is NbA.com tracking  if accurate) simply doesn’t offset the vast majority of half court possessions in the playoffs where KD is mostly going 1v3 with no weakside gravity as an iso scorer. Also, Billy Donovan and Scott brooks were notoriously berated for not calling set plays. They didn’t run any sets to get KD off the catch, or in motion so saying how Westbrook or OKC helped him in those areas in retro spect is a lie at best.  t. It was just pure self creation from KD. Despite all this, he was still much more efficiency than harden &amp; more effcient than Pre Cavs 2nd stint LeBron. That’s the point I’m making."
"No, I say that because a bunch of fans that watch NBA basketball, get upset when their favorite player leaves a specific team,as if they owe them something.  Which they don't, because it's all entertainment, and Basketball players are there to entertain us and play a game they love.  So I don't understand why people got worked up, and invested so much of their time and emotions getting upset because Kevin Durant left to the Warriors for example. Yes in Basketball context, it makes sense to get upset, but in the grand scheme of things, it's worthlessto be all worked up about it, when he doesn't even know you.  That's my 2 Cents."
"2018 Houston Rockets. One of the best teams of all time that won 65 games and was consistently the best team in the league in the regular season and then  was an injury away from beating a team that won a title, made b2b finals won 73 games and then replaced their worst starter with kevin durant"
I'm Kevin Durant. You know who i am
"8'1"" Kevin Durant would be pretty insane"
"My thoughts on what the rosters might look like:  Atlanta: Bob Pettit,  Dominque Wilkins  Boston: Larry Bird, Bill Russell  Brooklyn: Jason Kidd, Vince Carter  Charlotte: Kemba Walker, Larry Johnson  Chicago: Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen  Cleveland: Lebron James, Mark Price  Dallas: Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman  Denver: Carmelo Anthony, Alex English  Detroit: Isiah Thomas, Bob Lanier  Golden St: Wilt Chamberlain, Steph Curry  Houston: Hakeem Olajuwon, James Harden  Indiana: Reggie Miller, Jermaine O'Neal  Clippers: Blake Griffin, Bob McAdoo  Lakers: Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson  Memphis: Pau Gasol, Mike Conley Jr  Miami: Dwyane Wade, Alonzo Mourning  Milwaukee: Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Minnesota: Kevin Garnett, Karl Anthony Townes  New Orleans: Chris Paul, Anthony Davis  New York Knicks: Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier  Oklahoma City: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook  Orlando: Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard  Philadelphia: Julius Erving, Charles Barkley  Phoenix: Steve Nash, Amare Stoudemire  Portland: Dame Lillard, Clyde Drexler  Sacramento: Oscar Robertson, Peja Stojakovic  San Antonio: Tim Duncan, George Gervin  Seattle: Ray Allen, Gary Payton  Toronto: Chris Bosh, Kyle Lowry  Utah: John Stockton, Karl Malone  Washington: Elvin Hayes, John Wall"
"It doesn’t surprise me that you’d say this, since you don’t use context at all and are genuinely one of the worst accounts on here. The answer is No....their performances aren’t identical at all. Once you filter for League average TS and strength of team.   I’ll give you an example.  Kevin Durant 3 year peak in OKC (2011-2013)  29 points per 75 on 8.2 rTS  Harden 3 year peak in Houston (2015-2017)  28 points per 75 on +5.6 rTs.  Harden scores at a worse rate, is less efficienct, and is more turnover prone.  KD is playing with zero spacing as well while Harden is playing in a 5 out offense...."
"Dude you can look up any basketball great and their opinion on this matter and they'll tell you exactly this. I took an interview of Tim Hardaway Sr and asked him point blank who he'd choose taking the last shot in a close Finals game, and he said KD. Your opinion is worth jack shit compared to his. https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/kevin-durant-is-the-only-unstoppable-player-in-the-nba-tim-hardaway-sr-nba-legend"
&gt;KD was blessed by a Rabbi at a Jewish Education Community Center in 2014      So does this mean Kevin Durant is kosher?
"&gt;Kevin Durant... Elite defender  Mmmm-k  Magic, MJ, Bird, Hakeem, and me for the hard fouls.   We good until I blow out my knee at which point bring in KG."
"If you told people that a team with Lebron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh lost, they would think you are crazy. If you told people that a team with DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green didn't win the championship, they would think you are crazy. So, yes there is no such thing as a guaranteed ring."
Kevin Durant  Allen Iverson   Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant
This is not Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Kevin Hart could have a ventriloquist act where they take turns being the dummy.
The Hardest Road: Drinking a Jew's bathwater.  By Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant was a genius but he was like 8 years early on this
Thompson benefits from playing next to Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. Neither Allen nor Miller played with an offensive player remotely as good as those two and they were often the focal point of the offence.
"""Scarlett johanneson I will drink ur bath water...#random""  -Kevin Durant"
I’ve seen that chess movie. Searching for Kevin Durant
"In the past, Dirk 100%.   I'm hopeful that Luka is the same.  He seems like a guy who would rather take his own team to victory rather than be a Kevin Durant.   Part of the reason I say that is that supposedly he was rather upset when the Mavs traded away a bunch of players last year.   One reason I feel good right now is that the core of the team seems to really like each other and are having fun."
"	 I don't know if you noticed, but that was not smooth. His handle was not tight, the way he pulled up was awkward.  He looked more like Tristan Thompson than Kevin Durant."

"I’d say Greg Oden, Kevin Durant getting pick 2nd is the main difference"
Kevin Durant and Jonathan Isaac are both 7 foot small forwards so..
Kevin Durant &amp; anti-Semitism.  But you probably don't know about that duo since the NBA trying to pretend that it never happened.
Kevin Durant owns 1/3 of those accounts.
"Before we know it, we’ll have old Kevin Durant on his Bill Russell shit telling these cats he couldn’t have won with them in his day cause they’re a bunch of blog bois"
Anyone else associate that era with Kevin Durant?
Certainly a Kevin Durant-like frame.
Is he on their payroll or something? Last year he seriously said that they would beat Golden State even if Kevin Durant wan't hurt
"The first paragraph of that was absolutely hilarious   &gt;Kevin Durant is not 6-9. He is not close to 6-9. He is not 6-9 without shoes, he is not 6-9 when he slouches, he is not 6-9 under any circumstances. Whenever Durant is standing next to 6-10 or 6-11 players, you always notice ""Hey, 6-9 Kevin Durant is taller than that guy who is taller than 6-9."""
Kevin Durant?
"In hindsight, 2014-15 was pretty thick with good teams. There were 7 50-win teams in the West and 3 in the East, with the Raptors just barely missing the cut at 49 wins. Two teams won 60+ games and set franchise win records - the Hawks and the Warriors. The Hawks managed to sneak in a record 4 players plus their coach onto the All-Star team. The Grit and Grind Grizzlies had their best season to date, while the Rockets got the closest they've been to the Finals since Jordan left the league. Lob City was still at its peak.  Older players such as Kobe, Dirk, Tim Duncan, DWade, Pau Gasol, and Carmelo were all selected for the All-Star game. But the West was rotten with current and future MVPs, such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Steph Curry. Kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Anthony Davis, Chris Bosh, and Blake Griffin also deserve a shout-out. The rest of the list contains stalwarts such as Dame, Klay, Lowry, LaMarcus Aldridge, Jimmy Butler, and Marc Gasol."
holy shit you cracked the code Kevin Durant can also handle the ball and create for himself
"Nick cannon, P diddy, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant,  Desean Jackson, Stephen Jackson. Any more big name i’ve missed?"
He 7ft tall. I don't care what nobody says.    https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/  The man is 7ft tall in shoes.
"I don’t think it’s crazy to suggest that he has as much natural talent as a guy like Tim Duncan for example. Timmy was the better player but he also played for the best organization and coaching staff in basketball for two decades. Would it be possible that if you dropped a 19 year old Kevin Durant on the Spurs in the late 90s that he could’ve grown into a better player than Duncan under Pop and alongside guys like Robinson, Ginobili, Parker, etc? It’s possible imo  I honestly think as amazing as he is, there was another level in his game in terms of decision making, playmaking, defense, etc that he could’ve gotten to under a better developmental coach than Scott Brooks and Billy Donovan. Like if he was drafted today to the Raptors under Nick Nurse or the Celtics under Stevens, I think tthere’s a chance he’s contending for DPOY in his prime and his decision making offensively would be markedly better"
James Harden is a better scorer than Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"Kevin Durant, although he'd be there voluntarily and would only leave to feed. He's the basketball basilisk of sulking wells."
"Kevin Durant, to me, is a basketball player that plays basketball in the National Basketball Association."
The [reference](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-on-joining-warriors-i-didnt-go-there-to-make-my-life-easier/).
"07  I was bigger on college before that but during that year CBS or ESPN or whoever ran a special for the Naismith Award and the 2 players they showed were Tyler Hansbrough and Kevin Durant  Now Tyler Hansbrough was already one of the biggest stars ever in college at a blue blood program, but this KD guy was new to me and the idea that he was this good as a freshman"
"Desean Jackson, Malik Jackson, Dwyane Wade, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Bobby Hart, Allen Iverson, Stephen Jackson, Malcolm Jenkins, Jameis Winston, Marquise Goodwin, Nick Cannon. I know you are probably close to braindead so you can't count past 2, but I count 12 black celebrities there that have endorsed anti-semitism. And like they say silence is violence. So all the others who were quick to speak up against Drew Brees who are saying fuck all here are probably in support. Off the top of my head I know Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, and Malcolm Jenkins spoke out immediately against him, but now when it's when their own kind hating someone else, it's not an issue or concern. It might not get through to your pea brain, but I am not white and I am an oppressed minority of America. I support equality for all races and sexes and religions which is something that clearly these stupid idiots cannot do because people like Dwayne Wade are too dumb to notice that Louis Farrakhan would have his transgender child burning before he could even blink. I support equality and that is clearly not represented by NBA players who are actively support anti-semitism and promoting something that only benefits them. Try not being so stupid next time you comment because it really shows through."
"Are you trying to do a caricature of a crazy lakers fan or Kevin Durant’s burner account? I don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish, Oden was a very good prospect and at the time there was more emphasis on bigs than wings. Oden got hurt and Durant turned into an all timer. Congrats you were right? You can say he looked old all you want but it doesn’t really matter."
Edit: Didn't add a response.. Just the links below. Response added.  KD:  [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/)  Oden:  [https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/)  &amp;#x200B;  Now it seems though that you're being disingenuous in how you're making this evaluation. The original topic is Portland's justification of picking Oden over Durant...To even suggest that **over time** Oden couldn't prove himself means you aren't actually looking at them through the lens of the draft. You're making the evaluation based on what we know today.  I never thought your take was god awful but it's at least rapidly approaching intellectually dishonest.
"Kevin Durant liked and unliked a IG post  But even if we include him that's 7 athletes, most of whom are retired. 7  You think 7 is a lot when there are literally thoudands of pro athletes who are currently playing and retired?"
"Kevin Durant played 12 minutes against the Raptors  Against the Rockets he played 212 minutes  Not saying it wasn’t disappointing for the Rockets, but Durant still had a bigger impact in that series  Even Klay missed significant minutes against the Raptors"
"It took Kevin Durant going down for Kawhi to win a title as a superstar leading his team  I think Kawhi’s better either way, but Harden was 1 game away from beating one of the greatest teams ever assembled  He probably would have if CP3 didn’t go down.   He can definitely lead a contending team"
At least try and hide your Durant boner a little bit. man...Your take isn't the worst ever with hindsight but you can't be so biased that you overlook what everybody knew. Greg Oden was the best player available but Kevin Durant could have a higher upside. That was the draft synopsis.
"Id take him over Dr. J, Moses Malone, Kevin Durant, Robinson,and Oscar Robertson. Basically I think he's pretty much as good as Tim Duncan, but suffered in the way 70s Kareem did, and to me rings and narratives matter less than putting together mvp level seasons"
Kevin Durant?
"Dwade, Stephen Jackson, DeSean Jackson, Malik Jackson, Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant and Shannon Sharpe just to name a few off the top of my head."
"He played three series against the spurs, lost two with a 14-18 record. This is not what I call a spurs killer, Kevin Durant would deserve this title, he's by far the star with the best overall result against them."
Ainge is obsessed with lengthy wing-men.... Look how he traded down to get Tatum despite already having Hayward and Jaylen Brown.  https://nesn.com/2016/03/report-celtics-would-have-drafted-kevin-durant-no-1-overall-in-2007/
"I watched a couple episodes on ESPN+. Kevin and his business partner sit at a table with a few other guests and discuss a specific topic related to the business of basketball. I.e. one episode I watched was about the sneaker industry.  Durant does not offer a lot in terms of commentary himself, but his guests do."
Kevin Durant thinks otherwise
not just former players. kevin durant liked the original desean jackson post about him. nfl and nba need to make a statement.
"Don’t just look at his FG%. Look at this TS%. Plus you got to remember that this over the course of 6 years  Trae Young[2018-20]: 23.6 PPG on 56.7 TS%  Bradley Beal[2018-20]: 27.6 PPG on 58.0 TS%  Stephen Curry[2014-20]: 26.5 PPG on 64.7 TS%  Dame Lillard[2014-20]: 25.6 PPG on 58.4 TS%  Kevin Durant[2014-20]: 26.3 PPG on 63.8 TS%  LeBron James[2014-20]: 26.2 PPG on 59.7 TS%   Before Westbrook, who was going to help carry the scoring load? He’s the first player to average more than 20 points next to Harden on the Rockets.   Last year, his best scorers were Capela(16.6) and Gordon(16.2). He was averaging 36.1 PPG.   In 2017-18, he averaged 30.4 PPG. His next best scorers were Cp3(18.6)and Gordon(18)  In 2016-17, he averaged 29.1 PPG. His next best scorers were Gordon(16.2) and Lou Will(14.9)"

Kevin [Heatmor](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Durant)
"""Kevin Durant is highly regarded by many as the most talented player in NBA history""  Is that true?"
"""Black people"" don't all dislike Jews.   [These guys, however, do.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_of_Islam)  DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Louis Farrakhan - - the NOI's leader - endorsing Hitler and spouting off with Jewish cabal conspiracy theories.   Contrasting the general response to Drew Brees saying he's gonna stand for the flag (jump down his throat and get try and get him well and truly ""cancelled""), Jackson's received more support than he has condemnation.   Direct supporters include:  * Stephen ""Imma quadruple down on what DeSean said"" Jackson (retired NBA player, not the former St Louis Rams running back)   * Malik ""Louis Farrakhan - raging asshole who runs the racist, misogynistic and anti-semetic NOI is totally an upstanding gentlemen"" Jackson (Eagles' DT)   * Shannon ""I refuse to condemn the Nation of Islam"" Sharpe (NFL Hall of Fame TE)  * Malcom ""Racism only matters when it's against black people"" Jenkins (Saints' safety)  Guys who liked his post included:   * Kevin Durant  * Alshon Jeffery (Eagles' WR)   * Marquise Goodwin (Eagles' WR)   * Jameis Winston (Saints' QB)   among several others.   So, in 2020, NASCAR has a relatively progressive response to race relations in America, and in the NFL, you can be a literal open Nazi sympathizer - as long as you're black - and be perfectly fine, but god forbid you smoke weed because you're gonna get ended."

"Man, you weren't on /r/NBA during the whole DeSean Jackson/Stephen Jackson/Kevin Durant thing. Everyone was so disappointed that no one from inside the league was issuing a statement over this. Every single anti-semitic post or comment was downvoted to hell."
Hard to tell. It could just be because Kevin Durant is actually super boring in person.
Kevin Durant has less charisma than a baked potato.  How did he ever get a show to begin with?
Listening to Kevin Durant talk should be considered a war crime
Kevin Durant had a show?
"&gt;If everyone in the NBA was the same height, Gianni's and/or Shaq would not be  nba players. Meanwhile guys like Kevin Durant, LeBron, curry, Kyrie, harden etc. Would still be the best players in the NBA"

Yea well so was Kevin Durant six years ago
last year i tried to buy a Kevin Durant knicks jersey(kill me) and the nba store would not late me do it.  not even a custon one.
"Why did you vote for Kevin Durant over Steph Curry for Finals MVP in 2018?   I don't mean that in a critical way, I'm just curious haha. Because to me, it was obvious that Steph was just getting doubled and blitzed by the Cavs all series, while KD got George Hill on the block whenever he wanted. So while KD had the better box score, it was obvious who the more value player to the Warriors was that series. What do you think?"
Then kevin durant shows up like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=reptile+boy+buffy&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-US&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=svni&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03enKx7AEFVEGtVopRU0RicTFrsBQ:1594737545493&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7u6Kn_MzqAhVMBs0KHcfQBOsQ_AUIFigE&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=719&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=gSzlw-1c2lxS7M)
"Not making assumptions about your WNBA knowledge, but Elena is the equivalent to a Kevin Durant/Giannis. Arguably the best (second best imo) player in the league and most recognizable face. She’s also the reigning MVP and 2019 champion.  Definitely not a good look for the league to slight her like that."
If we are just talking general basketball IQ or some combo of basketball IQ and normal IQ I’d probably go out on a limb and say LeBron dropping to 6’5” (+30IQ) OR Kevin Durant dropping to 6’6” (+60IQ).   LeBron is now Westbrook + Magic Johnson with the best IQ in the league.... or on the other hand Durant is a Demi-god. He’d be smart enough to see the equations pop up like in Limitless and make 90%+ shots easily based on the physics calculations.   Hmmm... LeBron is also smart enough already (BBIQ) that I believe you could drop him something wild like... 30 “IQ” and be 6’11” without losing athleticism. That’s scary too.
"I think that is a oversimplification of my point. Presti has a number of failings, such as the Sonics trades and the Harden trade. He also has not done well at retaining superstar talent such as Ray Allen, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, or Paul George. But in his favor, he has made excellent trades in recent years. And OKC has been stellar in its draft selection.  You're right that if you ignore all his failings, he's great. But you're missing the point that even if you include all his failings, he's still a pretty good GM - good enough to be top 10."
"&gt;Has anyone seen LeBron and the snake from the Garden of Eden in the same place at the same time?  [Here you go.](https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/01/011917-kevin-durant-lebron-james-pi.jpg)  Come on, someone had to do it."

You were talkin overly sensitive bs saying people should be downvoted for calling people a bitch. I don’t think an insult is enough to warrant a downvote. What you were talkin was overly sensitive bs.  You can’t downvote someone anymore for doing something spineless lol. Overly sensitive bs you’re talkin.  &gt;Then you insulted me. Even tho you were talkin overly sensitive bs. True statement.  If you think nobody can be insulted. You’re sensitive. Calling a spade a spade.  &gt;Acting as if me saying that is anywhere close to the same as calling someone a little bitch and a child.  Didn’t even outright call you a child. You’re twisting words. And yes you called Kevin Durant a bitch. You keep ignoring that part. That´s the whole reason we´re even talking to each other.  &gt;Yes you are “responding to my comments”   &gt;   &gt;The things you say in response to a comment can be harassing. So yes you are harassing Me.  If you feel harassed, that´s not my intention. I´m repeating what you´ve said here.

"Dont get it twisted. Look at his first 3 teams Los Angeles,New York and Golden State.

"Gobert is a fraud (big men win games, smallball wins championships, etc). Westbrook also limits your ceiling.   I'd go something like:  - PG: Brogdon - SG: Harden - SF: Kevin Durant - PF: Marcus Smart - C: Nikola Jokic"
"On Saturday night, the league brought three tankers of Scarlett Johansson's bath water to drink at poolside parties at each of the three Disney hotels housing players. Only Kevin Durant showed up."
The Warriors had Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant? Morey has maximized his assets with a cheap af owner.
"I'm talking about you saying Curry is ""mixed.""    Here is a video of Kevin Durant saying he thought Stephon Curry is White and he’s not use to see light-skinned “Black” guys.

His stint with Miami wasn’t that weak. But his second stint with Cleveland was incredibly weak in terms of competition played.   Best team he played was the derozan/Lowry raptors or al horford Celtics with rooks in his second stint with Cleveland.  Kevin Durant might be able to do it with the same teams.

Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant in shambles after reading this
Lol cmon on. Have we all forgotten about Kevin Durant already?
Shit I guess Kevin Durant has been the best player since 2017
This is game 3 in the first round of the playoffs. Kevin Durant probably regrets going back into the finals last year so soon.
Who is more consistent at scoring than Kawhi? Aside from Kevin Durant who is injured.
"What’s impressive is how the Nets made back to back playoff appearances after being in one of the worst holes a franchise could be in. 5 of the 8yrs in Brooklyn so far.   If anyone would have said back when this all started that Nets would make the playoffs 2 out of the next 5yrs idk how many people would have put down $ on that.   All of that with only Brook Lopez, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Thad Young plus cap space as the Nets only assets.   Year before he was fired at least Billy King was able to move the corpse of Kevin Garnett to Minnesota for Thad Young. That’s so key.   Sean Marks flipped Thad Young to Indy for Caris Levert and a Future 2nd.   Flipped Bojan to the Wizards for a 1st that would become Jarrett Allen while taking on a bad contract that was flipped to Portland for Crabbe.   Brook Lopez + 27(Kuzma) was sent to Lakers for D’Lo and Mozgov.    Also hits on Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris to help the Nets make the Playoffs after a 3yr drought.   Mozgov is traded for Dwight Howard who is released to chase a ring.   Crabbe +2-1st’s are traded for Taurean Prince to clear $.   The Nets sign and trade D’Lo for Durant to help open up the $ to sign Kyrie and DeAndre Jordan."
Why did no one tell me we're playing against Kevin Durant
Next year they'll have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant so I doubt I'll be having much sympathy for them win or lose.
"I mean outside of klay Steph and draymond their roster is pretty empty, obviously they will add more pieces and have the draft pick, but the nets have a deep bench already and Kevin Durant Kyrie Irving...nets have been planning for next season for a year"
Should’ve had Kevin Durant and the snake from Jungle Book
"""Trying to build a superteam and failed badly"" thats laughable considering Kevin Durant hasn't played a second for the Nets yet and the Nets knew he wouldn't play this season when they signed him.   ""You can't accept your team is doing badly"" again how is a team supposed to be playing well without 8 of their best 9 players? Whats even funnier is that the Nets had a better bubble record than the Lakers.   The Lakers and their reality TV show roster are in a serious dog fight with the 8th seed, won't get past the Rockets and certainly won't get past the Clippers. It'll be funny watching the Lakers lose and watching brain dead laker fans like you cry, complain and bitch about it."
You think Mavs + Giannis are anywhere near the 73 win Warriors + Kevin Durant? That’s a spicy take.
"On God this is what I said when he did this lol. And you remember when he made that stepback 3 to beat the shot clock? When AD’s shot is on like that, he’s like, Kevin Durant dangerous as a scorer."
"They got 73-9 for a reason, and one of em is not Kevin Durant.   Even without 2nd pick, if steph dray and Klay healthy, they are the best team in the west behind the Lakers.."
Ah right cause Mark Jackson also had Kevin Durant?
I re-feel your pain for not drafting Kevin Durant
The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Greg Oden and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Kevin Durant.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Markelle Fultz and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Jayson Tatum.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Greg Oden and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Kevin Durant.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Andrea Bargani and a team with 19 wins gets to pick LaMarcus Aldridge.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Anthony Bennet and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Victor Oladipo.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Andrew Wiggins and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Joel Embiid.  The problem is that a team with 18 wins gets to pick Marvin Bagley and a team with 19 wins gets to pick Luka Doncic.'  These are countless examples of top 3 picks where the second pick got the better player.
They'll flip it into Kevin Durant.... Again
"I mean, that's basically what Prime Kevin Durant is."
[Kevin Durant right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/dhwip)
"Blazers also had it bad, missed out on 2 of the best to ever play the game:  1984 - They selected Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan  2007 - They selected Greg Oden over Kevin Durant  They have others too, but too old to really talk about here ;)"
"1. Cheick Diallo  2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. James Harden  4. Kevin Durant (this one is, admittedly, debatable due to injury)  5. Lebron James  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Steph Curry  8. Luka Doncic  9. Nikola Jokic  10. Damian Lillard"
"So I have a theory on this and it relates to the elbow.  The theory is basically that the wider your back, the more chicken wing you are gonna have, because to keep it straight you have to tuck it in more.  I hope I'm explaining it right but if you think about one difference between dwight howard and kevin durant for example."
"It's what they did against you guys, only you guys had Kevin Durant. When he went out it was like 2016 Warriors again, which they couldn't handle."
I'm not taking that team in the modern NBA that's like 0 spacing  Gimme   LeBron Ray Allen Kevin Durant Dirk Nowitzki Wilt Chamberlain
PG - LeBron James  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - Kobe Bryant  PF - Karl Malone  C - Wilt Chamberlain  6th - Kevin Durant (Backup forward)  7th - Allen Iverson (backup Guard)  8th - Bob McAdoo (Backup Center)
"His teammate Anthony Davis is a good comp, his form is much more textbook. Kevin Durant is an even better example."
"&gt;You’re all insults and self created narratives. No substance to what you say and I know why.  You can literally go back and see who insulted who first, you do realize there's a comment history to prove you wrong, once again. You can't lie your way into being correct in these matters you damn fool.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Because there is no real arguments you can make statistically, using game footage or advanced stats or using player/coach/gm testimony’s to support your clown level takes in this thread  Ummmm. I'm pretty sure we have like 5 + years of statistical evidence of what Kevin Durant and Stephen curry have done in this league. Are you new to watching basketball or something?  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html)  Here's Kevin Durant's career statistical history for evidence  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html)  Here's Stephen Curry's career statistical history for evidence  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html)  Here's James Harden's career statistical history for evidence  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01.html)  Here's Damien Lillard's career statistical history for evidence  Now take a look at some of these players stats for this season and their careers and compare them to Lukas  [https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01.html)  You're wrong. Here's the evidence you asked for.  **The ceiling for him to be better is there, but currently, he is not better than these players. The literal statistics prove that you are wrong. Now shut the fuck up you actual idiot. If you sit here and actually try to argue about numbers that players clearly have over him then there is literally no help for your baby brain.**  **So now that I have provided you with literally every named player being better in numerous stats/categories, how about you give me evidence that Luka is better than these players? I'll wait.**"
"&gt;Dude just accept you are wrong. Every coach, player and media member has given Luka that praise,  every big time podcasted on NBA writer have given Luka that love  You talk like you have so many sources that you can bring on the matter yet never actually have any substance behind anything you say. Giving Luka praise is deserved, he's a good player, but no ones fucking putting him above Curry, KD, and Harden like you are, you baby brained imbecile.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;everything with a brain realizes this besides people like you who can’t give him credit because he is young.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It’s sad man. Luka could never improve one bit, he’ll he could get 20% worse as a player and you would give him more respect in 5 years then you are right now just because he is young  Are you dense? I've given Luka nothing but praise in any of my posts. He's phenomenal. The reason I bring up his age is because he STILL HAS MORE AHEAD OF HIM TO ACHIEVE you fucking idiot. **This is a good thing when I say this, and is also the reason I say he has the potential to be better than these named players but is not better than them now.**  You are legit ignorant and your baby brain shows with the bullshit you say. Lmao, ""people on podcasts gave him praise"" doesn't give you the right to say some absurd shit like he's currently better than fucking Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. Get the thoughts of his dick going down your throat out of your head and try to think clearly. Even when the thread got taken down a notch to top 3 offensive player instead of top 3 overall a lot of people still don't have him above these players, as you can see evident in these threads."
u/NicholasClarke  Kevin Durant was unquestionably better every postseason &amp; undisputed first option of the team. Let’s please not delude ourselves
"&gt;Imagine thinking that Dallas could possibly get a star free agent   &gt;   &gt;Though it would be best fit by far  I think you'd actually not be happy with that. Luka is good enough to win championships with a homegrown team. Playing on an annoying ""superteam"" will ruin that. I think Kevin Durant did significant damage to Steph Curry's reputation and legacy and how people perceived the Warriors and a lot of other people seemed to agree when I asked them."
"No. There are many, many, many people who do not even know who Kevin Durant is in 2020. The average citizen.  Every single person knew who LeBron James was in 2010 and the majority had jokes or insults about his decision.  KD could never be as hated simply because he just isn’t as known across the country/world.  It’s MJ, LeBron, Kobe, and everyone else."
"in an average game  roughly 35% of 3 point shots go in, barely above 1/3  that percentage includes thinghs as halfcourt hail maries at the end of quarters and such so the ""real"" percentage is prolly a bit higher, like 36 or 37  a 36% 3 point shot means 1.08 points per shot   a 50 % 2 point shot (very high actually) is only 1.0 points per shot  and attacking the rim for lay ups or dunks is player dependant but it has a higher percentage than 2 point jumpshoots and also leads to free throws so it ks even more valuable and important than 3 point shooting although both symbiotically lead to each other   (great shooters force the defende to spread and leave space to drive to the rim, great players to attack the rim can suck in the defense and then pass to a open 3)  that slight difference between average 3 point shootinga and strong long 2 point jumpers  may not seem like much but it would be equivalent to around 10 points in a full game context   this is very importand to understand why teams dont shoot 2 point jumpers unless there is no other good shot available  and also why in the playoffs when defenses tighten and take away easy 3's and easy layups, the teams and players who are better at ""bad, hard shots"" like this (kobe bryant, kawhi leonard, kevin durant) can have a super valuable plus   now if a 36% 3 point shooting is good enough imagine how mamy extra points 45 or 50+ % 3 point shooting represents"
We’re due for a super team by 2022. I hated basketball when Miami got together then loved it again when Dallas beat them. I hated it when Miami started winning everything then loved it when LeBron went back to Cleveland and won. Hated it when Kevin Durant took the Bitch way and joined golden state then loved it when we beat them last year to end the reign. Now I’m just old and content to watch. I want raptors to win but all the storylines are amazing and I’m just down for whatever happens. Super teams by design can never last nowadays anyways
"""Warriors were also missing Kevin Durant for the entire series"" oh poor Steph only had two all-stars and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins  and Shaun Livingston at his disposal, how'd he do it! And going up against defensive stalwarts Dame Lillard, CJ McCollum, Rodney Hood, (malnourished) Enes Kanter, (malnourished) Al Aminu, what a performance!"
Yes. But it’s Kevin Durant lol
Just give the warriors an mvp caliber player for wiggins and pick in a sub par draft . May as well give them Kevin durant back too
Idk man Paul George had like a 2 month stretch where he was basically Kevin Durant with even better defense last year lol.

What about Kevin Durant? People like Kevin Durant right?
Did Kevin Durant die?
Where would you all rank Doncic in the league if Kevin Durant and curry were healthy
This is some of the most terrible logic I've ever read on r/nba lmao.  &gt;The same west that couldn’t beat the Durant less warriors team? Hell Lebron and delly took them to 6 games lmao!  Yes because any other east team besides the Lebron Cavs was doing shit vs the Durantless Warriors.  &gt;Funny how they only lost to East teams  U wot?    They lost to Lebron.  Lebron does not equal the east.  Do you think that the Raptors or Hawks beat the Warriors?  &gt;I would take the 8th seed in East (nets) over the second seed in the west (nuggets) 10 out of 10 times  Nuggets wouldn’t even make the playoffs in the east  It's amazing how you can spew baseless bullshit with such confidence and absolutely zero logical backing.    &gt;Old Lebron first in the “tough” west and going to shit on the haters faces once and for all  He's first in the west with another top 10 player and the best big man in the league.  Lebron Cavs beat up the east playoff teams with Kevin Love playing like shit for most of it.
"He will join future Knicks players Kevin Durant, Zion Williamson, and Kyrie Irving 💪"
"You do understand that the argument is that he is a top 3 player in the NBA. This doesn't mean just the regular season, this doesn't just mean offense. This means that if you listed the top 3 players under active NBA contract that he is within those 3. He's not better than Harden yet, He's not better than Kevin fucking Durant, and he's not better than Kawhi Leonard. How can you sit here with your rose tinted glasses and tell me he is better than them?"
"I'm paying attention to Luka, do I think he has the potential to go further than some of these players? Yes. Do I think he is currently in the fucking tier of Kevin Durant, Kawhi, Harden, Curry? No."
"How much evidence do you have that Luka Doncic is a better player than Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, or James Harden? I'll take out all of the other names and you still don't even have him cracking top 3. Yikes."
"Add Steph Curry, KAT and Kevin Durant"
Celtics didn’t have Kevin Durant
"Tbf, that ""another star"" is Kevin Durant and not Gordon Hayward."
Kevin Durant
"Hopefully everything is ok with him and his family.   The nets will be without Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, Nicholas Claxton, and Wilson Chandler for game 3. You could argue that if all the Nets players not playing were on a separate team and all healthy they would be one of the more talented rosters that went to the bubble."
MPJs jumper reminds me of Kevin Durant. Dudes going to be a problem if hes consistent.
Kevin Durant is the sandpit monster from Star Wars
Bro it’s Kevin Fucking Durant they’re gonna be great lol

"Can you imagine if they got Kawhi?  Can you imagine if the Blazers drafted Kevin Durant?   They took a risk, and it didn't pay off. But the reward potential was like, 5 guaranteed championships assuming Kawhi stayed."
38.0 points per 100 possessions on 62.6% TS in the regular season (since he started making the playoffs in 2009-2010).   36.9 points per 100 possessions on 59.7% TS in the playoffs during the same time period.  So yeah a touch worse but nothing crazy. I think it could be chalked up to playing more minutes (36.9 in regular season versus 40.3 in playoffs) and just playing a really good team game after game in the playoffs versus playing weaker teams in the regular season.  The same goes for all players.  EDIT: The only players to score more points per 100 possessions in the playoffs than Kevin Durant are Michael Jordan (43.3) and LeBron James (37.2).
Kevin Durant
"You might have mentioned that all a few days ago, that doesn't necessarily make it true, or a reflection of Westbrook.  If instead of looking at the raw numbers and thinking things like because he leads the league in assists therefore he elevates his teammates we start first with a simple question: what does good offense look like? We arrive at a very different answer. In a good offense the ball moves, and not just between 2 people. There is simply no other way for Russ to put up the numbers he does without acknowledging that a inordinately large percentage of possessions when he is on the floor begin with the ball in his hands and end when he attempts a field goal or right after he passes. That is the only possible explanation. How is that elevating teammates to you? Making bystanders of his teammates a good deal of the time is making them better?  Let me come at this another way. I'm going to give you 7 names. I don't know how old you are so some of this may miss the mark but nonetheless.   Magic Johnson. Kyle Lowry. Chauncey Billups. John Stockton. Chris Paul. Steve Nash. Jason Kidd. 5 HOF's, and if basketball reference is correct, likely 7 when all is said and done. All 7 varying degrees of excellent passers, all 7 considered great floor generals, and all 7 won consistently throughout their careers. What do they all have in common? Have a look.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  |Player|Career Usage|| |:-|:-|:-| |Magic Johnson|22.3%|| |Kyle Lowry|21.7%|| |Chauncey Billups|21.9%|| |John Stockton|18.9%|| |Chris Paul|23.9%|| |Steve Nash|21.0%|| |Jason Kidd|19.2%||  &amp;#x200B;  Pretty remarkable how guys who are considered great floor generals, and guys who consistently make their teammates better, give the ball up more, not less. And really, look at who is in that list. Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Steve Nash, Chris Paul and Jason Kidd all had numerous seasons where they average 10+ apg. All of those guys gave the ball up early, they did not attempt to control each possession. That's what allows the other 4 guys to be more involved and allows teammates to stay in the game and develop beside them.  &amp;#x200B;  Yet if you look at Westbrooks career line, there is a clear indicator that his assists only reached a high level after he was operating at historically high usage rates. I mean, congrats, i guess, on needing to control the ball twice as much as those other guys to get double figure assists? Maybe this is the disconnect. Making your teammates better is not driving and if you are cut off at the rim kicking it out. Russ should be able to do that as well as anyone. It's involving them in the play, giving the ball up early with no expectation of getting it back, etc.   &amp;#x200B;  As for ceiling raiser, that's the silliest thing i can imagine hearing someone say about Russ. As the saying goes the only thing that could keep KD from scoring 40 was Russ. KD's best seasons came at a time when Westbrook was still very high usage and getting far fewer assists. Kevin Durant has been incredible every day since he was 20, and there is nothing to suggest Westbrook had any impact on KD other that to possibly suppress his PPG. Besides, that's not what making people better is about. It's about elevating the people below you, getting a productive team out of 15 guys, not going along for the ride with a player who is clearly much better and saying that his success is evidence that you make guys better lol. I'm also not buying that Victor Oladipo just transformed into an all-NBA player on the plane from OKC to Indiana after the 2016-17 season in OKC. His ability to break out is directly tied to the fact that Westbrook functioned more or less as a solo act that year.   &amp;#x200B;  Anyways, I'm not sure what it is that impresses you about making it to the finals once in 7 years playing with arguably the greatest scorer in the history of the game. To say that people should be impressed with Russ's history of success is interesting since he has a pretty underwhelming resume."
"&gt;Almost no one shoots these midrange shots anymore because it's just not worth it  Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Luka Doncic, James Harden, Chris Paul, Khris Middleton, Devin Booker, Kyrie Irving, and pretty much any other efficient superstar in the NBA shoot the mid range regularly. Why do you think they're able to do that and still be some of the most efficient players in the game? They shoot more mid range than anyone else, why are they still efficient?  Because being able to hit the mid range means that teams have to hone in on that section of the floor.  Also, in the playoffs, the mid range is more valuable than ever. The paint defense gets much harder to get past, so being able to pull up from mid range makes a huge difference for guys like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard. You know, guys who win NBA championships."
Teams be facing Kevin fucking Durant yet he's not even the number one worry when you're on defense.
"Ahhh 2012 where the Heat led by LeBron James faced off against the Thunder featuring James Harden, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the NBA Finals."
Only because KD and Steph aren't active right now.  I'd go:  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo 1. LeBron James 1. Kawhi Leonard 1. Kevin Durant 1. James Harden 1. Stephen Curry 1. Anthony Davis
"Also Kevin fucking Durant, y’all know who he is"
"I was in Guantanamo Bay for 10 years just came out today but I heard that Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook were on the same team at one point. Did they win 5 championships together before moving teams?"
"I’m sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were throwing out names and excluding players, not literally naming your top 20. Including Steph and not KD led me to believe that, I forgot Steph played 5 games this year.   Middleton is still not a top 20 player bc his skillset isn’t nearly as rare or valuable or impactful as other players. He’s not this huge plus defensively, so he’s literally standing on shooting splits. You don’t think his shooting splits benefit from him playing next to Giannis? Or that Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, shit even Brandon Ingram could match his production if they played in his system with his role? His shot selection is a function of his role. Meanwhile I don’t think Middleton could take any of their roles and be as successful. Shit, Joe Harris has similar shooting splits as Khris Middleton, where does he rank in the rankings? Is he top 50 if Middleton is top 20? Khris is 61% TS and Joe is 60%.    For Middleton, he’s using his skillset perfectly. He’s not talented enough to go out there and shoot like KD, or Paul George, or Jayson Tatum, or Brandon Ingram. I don’t think he should change his play style.    With that being said, people don’t put the efficiency in context imo. Something I think about is Kevin Durant and Steve Nash. They were some of the most efficient players in NBA history, but I’d argue it’d be better for their offenses as a whole if they would’ve taken 10 or so more shots per game, even if there shooting splits drop by 5%. Because a shot taken by those guys, even at a lower clip, is better than a shot otherwise being taken by one of their teammates. But if they did that, people would say they weren’t as good bc their splits were lower. It’s the reason why people say AI wasn’t as good as he really was, even though he put a team to the finals on his fucking back offensively. His shooting splits should contextualized as such. Efficient shots like Middleton takes and makes has to be created from somewhere, like from his actual top 15 teammate Giannis whose actually on that level.  Idk how else to phrase it, but Russ is better than Middleton because he generates offense better than Middleton, and he’s flat out more talented. In fact, I think Joe Harris’s splits are more impressive than Middleton’s because Harris isn’t playing with Giannis. Why are we putting so much weight on Middleton’s efficiency without the context of him playing with Giannis whose play style generates better shots for him than nearly anyone could."
"I still can't believe Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden all played on the 2012 Olympic Basketball team together.   What a squad."
"Yea, that’s like the only time I’ve heard action been taken.  Otherwise, like kevin durant going 5 feet out of bounds vs houston, I can’t recall anything being done besides the “oops yea sorry about that” the next day"
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant, he already chose a snake so can never be a goat"
"You’re mostly right. There were more diverse offenses back then, but superteams were definitely a thing back then. The Beatles, big 3 Celtics, the Dwight Howard Lakers. Superteams aren’t really new, Kevin Durant just turned it up to 11"
"The BubbleTM in the NBA is a unique environment that'll be impossible to duplicate in a more traditional NBA arena. Once teams go back, new players who have shined in The BubbleTM may find themselves coming back to earth a bit. Obviously superstar players like Dame and young talents like Booker won't be a part of that category, as even if they get a little worse, they'll still be superstars in their own rights.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, here's my list of superstars for the future in no particular order:  * Kawhi Leonard * Lebron James * Giannis Antetokunmpo * James Harden * Anthony Davis * Luka Doncic * Kevin Durant * Kyrie Irving * Steph Curry * Damian Lillard * Joel Embiid"
"Ya that makes sense, I remember watching OKC Kevin Durant transition into being hated on from their finals appearance until he left"
Well duh. I'm not Kevin Durant and am commenting about a player not named Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant or Jayson Tatum
"A true 3 level scorer.   Today, whenever someone who is a 7 footer shooting 3s they immediately go, ""oh he is the next dirk"" the closes thing to dirk is kevin durant.   Dirk is the reason why most nba teams have failed and sunken their franchise for drafting european bigs who they thought is the next dirk."
Kevin Durant ruined basketball for a few years.
Kevin Durant.
"Between 2013-19, Durant averaged 5.3 assists, which is pretty good for a SF  **Small Forward assists 2013-19:**  •	⁠Kawhi Leonard- 2.8  •	⁠Paul George- 3.6  •	⁠LeBron James- **7.8**  •	⁠Demar DeRozan- 4.5  •	⁠Khris Middleton- 3.4  •	⁠Jayson Tatum(2017-20)- 2.2  •	⁠Brandon Ingram(2016-20)- 3.2  •	⁠Gordon Hayward- 4  •	⁠Carmelo Anthony- 2.8  •	⁠Blake Griffin[PF]- 5  •	⁠Kevin Love[PF]- 2.6  •	⁠Giannis Antetokounmpo[PF]- 4.1  •	⁠Pau Gasol[PF]- 3  Among all these SFs and PFs, outside of LeBron, he’s been the best passer. It’s not really a weakness when you’re at the top of your position in it."
"Between 2013-19, Durant averaged 5.3 assists, which is pretty good for a SF   **Small Forward assists 2013-19:**  - Kawhi Leonard- 2.8  - Paul George- 3.6  - LeBron James- **7.8**  - Demar DeRozan- 4.5   - Khris Middleton- 3.4   - Jayson Tatum(2017-20)- 2.2  - Brandon Ingram(2016-20)- 3.2  - Gordon Hayward- 4   -  Carmelo Anthony- 2.8   - Blake Griffin[PF]- 5   - Kevin Love[PF]- 2.6   - Giannis Antetokounmpo[PF]- 4.1   - Pau Gasol[PF]- 3   Among all these SFs and PFs, outside of LeBron, he’s been the best passer.

"Mine know those 3 plus Steph Curry and Jayson Tatum since she's the same age as he is and went to an all girls school in the same city as him. But she didn't know who Kevin Durant was.  Also weirdly she follows the Kardashians/Jenners but doesn't know Tristian Thompson, Ben Simmons etc. She just says ""a NBA player"" about them."
"james harden, kevin durant"
"Ok guy, fair lol. But then you tell me: what keeps him from being as good as Kevin Durant if he’s as good of a shooter as him with a very similar build and skill set? Why is the gap bw them so large?"
"Haha all good, the Kevin Durant height issue is interesting to me as a 5'11 guy who has always had incentive to fudge the numbers.  I'm still pretty skeptical of the ""real"" numbers, like what's to stop him from slouching a little? Is the nurse or whoever going to tell one of the greatest players currently that he needs to stand up straight?  Pictures like [these](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f4f192393ca51d117f214b4508c61844) where he's directly next to Boogie (""true"" height 6'11) make me think he's 6'11 minimum."
"Kevin Durant.   Anything you want - post ups, mid range, 3s, ball handling, passing. No problem."
Kevin Durant has no offensive weaknesses whatsoever
"I don't know what his mindset is at all. He's probably just going to retire. But maybe the chance to make one last deep playoff run with a guy like Kevin Durant and deny the Lakers one more time would tempt him. I know that other coaches (Phil, Riley) LOVE to walk into ready-made superstar rosters and take control of them. Obviously to even have a chance you'd have to have both KD and Kyrie go meet him in person and tell him they want him calling the shots."
Nobody gives a fuck about Kevin Durant right now.
"He joins the likes of scrubs like James Harden, LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Penny Hardaway, Moses Malone and Kevin Johnson. He just knocked Kevin Durant off the top 10 playoff scrubs list."
"It’s because there is no Kevin Durant on the floor, Pat bev doesn’t know what to do"

"Lebron isn't a front court big, he's always been a perimeter player.  Curry hasn't won shit without a super team and even lost with one in 2019.  Klay is the best 2 guard in the league, Draymond was an-allstar for 5 years in a row, and he had the best bench in the league in 2015/16.  And he STILL barely beat Lebron in 2015 with his 2 best teammates hurt.  It's not even a comparison, Lebron has always been the superior player, including during the 2017 playoffs.  Curry can't win anything without Kevin Durant."

"Kevin Durant won 2 FMVPs in the past 3 years. He's 7 feet tall and effectively was Golden State's PF and rim protector with Draymond playing their small ball center position.   Prior to that, LeBron won 2 FMVPs as Miami's PF, and Dirk won it in 2011 as Dallas' PF."
I know people are clowning you for putting MPJ with those guys but I’m fine with it. I think there’s a world in which MPJ becomes the best out of all of those players. He can literally pull up on anybody on earth and doesn’t need a step back to do it. He on some Kevin Durant shit but extra. If he stays on the exponential path he’s on right now he could be the next dude in the league I swear.
"LOL, I'm not even going to address you calling Lebron a ""stat padder"" because he's got more playoff wins than anyone in history.  Let's not forget that Curry had to get Kevin Durant to win again, and had a chance to win another finals but couldn't without him.  Curry hasn't won anything without Durant, or the other teams he faced having major injury issues (Cavs without Love and Kyrie in 2015).  And they both made the finals that year (on apparently empty stats lmao).  Lebron had a USG% of 31.6, while Curry had a USG% of 30.  Oh yeah man, that's a HUGE difference."
"Yeah, it's great the Warriors never complained, both on and off the record:   [https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-2019-warriors-complained-to-league-about-patrick-beverleys-defense-on-kevin-durant-per-report/](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-playoffs-2019-warriors-complained-to-league-about-patrick-beverleys-defense-on-kevin-durant-per-report/)  [https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/29/warriors-admit-they-complain-too-much-to-officials/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/29/warriors-admit-they-complain-too-much-to-officials/)  [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/steve-kerr-traveling-calls-frustrated-refs-comments](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/11/steve-kerr-traveling-calls-frustrated-refs-comments)"
Kevin Durant will go back to his former self
"The team with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson"
"Kevin durant.  I’ve been saying this since preseason and I’ll get downvoted again.  The way he takes the ball off the rim and goes coast to coast 1 on 5 with no fear, there is no player that he reminds me of more.  They play the same position, both score in similar ways from similar spots with similar moves and play similar roles on the floor.  Also they are both fueled by hate.  Watch the KD rucker park video and tyler herro in high school video and tell me they aren’t flashes of the same player."
"Yeah, it's just Kevin Durant and his 1 million burners"
Kevin “Snake” Durant
"2019 playoffs Dame averaged 26.9, 4.8 boards, 6.6 assists, .373 3pt%.  Same year, Blake Griffin averaged 24.5/6/6 on .462 3pt%.  2017 Kevin Durant: 28.5/7.9/4.3 on .442 3pt%  Same year, Kawhi Leonard averaged 27.7/7.8/4.6 on .455 3pt%  Those are the closest ones to this statline in recent memory."
not to mention Kevin Durant
No Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant really hurts ratings. Those are probably the 2nd and 3rd most popular players in the league after Lebron.
"didnt lebron say the same?  edit: no it was KD: Kevin Durant says Giannis is the regular season MVP, but LeBron is the MVP of the NBA this season. Claims the “Bubble Ring” will be the most respected ring in NBA history. Says that he is playing 5 on 5 everyday but still “has a long way to go”. Picks the Lakers to win the NBA finals, and more!"
"Harden, 10/10 times.  Murray is a good player, but i think the Bubble component is very significant in his rise. Playing in front of no crowd helps younger players, and it has benefited him the most.  Harden is the second best scorer in the league right now, behind the unfair monster that's Kevin Durant, yes, i'm taking Harden."
"“But like over who though”  Dude....Jerry west and Stephen Curry are not better players than Kevin Durant.  They lack size &amp; defense. There’s just a different level of impact you reach at KD’s size.    Statistically, Durant is closer to Bird and many stats also have him better than Kobe too like BPM/Win shares per 48, etc."
Kevin durant is stupid. We knew that.
"I mean, he's having a playoff run on par with Steph Curry in terms of efficiency and volume. And he's having a better playoff run than Kevin Durant had in any of his seasons in Oklahoma City."
That Kevin Durant is so fat that his body mass is equivalent to roughly 45-50 normal players. Dude’s a fuckin ham planet
"You say that now but when Devonte Graham and Malik Monk become the next Splash Bros and PJ Washington turns into Kevin Durant, you're not allowed to like it"
"AD hit a game winning three and now is back on his ""I can play exactly like Kevin Durant"" bullshit"
"This shot =/= baseline one leg shots in a rhythm   Come onnnn man  Great shot, great player  Obviously not the only person in the world outside of Kevin Durant that could hit this shot"
9/10 NBA players couldn’t make that shot over AD. Kevin Durant is the only other player I can think of that would.
Is he?  - LeBron  - Kawhi  - Steph  - Harden  - Giannis  - AD  - Luka  - Jokic  - Embiid  - Dame  And that’s excluding Kevin Durant who could come back in the top 10.
"Sure, but what his teammates say about him says something, not everything. Same goes for articles like [this one](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2016/10/20/russell-westbrook-thunder-nba-season-preview-kevin-durant) - puff piece or not, it still bases its opinion of him based on what his teammates say and the way he behaves.   You wrote out a comment where one of your arguments was his playstyle, and you've never spent a single second with the guy talking to him, let alone seeing how he interacts with teammates inside the locker room. What teammates and articles say is infinitely more compelling than that."
https://thespun.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/espn-kawhi-leonard-called-kevin-durant-to-team-up-with-clippers
"Hey Einstein, how do you know I'm not Kevin Durant?"
"What does Kevin Durant know about respect? He chased a ring via joining the largest ringer in NBA history, and nobody respects him for that now, despite his immense talent."
"[Got this from a YT comment on Horry checking Steve Nash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LT_C7o5ZGM)  Do you guys realize how much changed from this play alone? If Horry didn't hip-check Nash, Boris Diaw and Amar'e Stoudemire would not have missed game 5. If the Suns didn't lose game 5, they would have taken it to a game 7 @ Phoenix. If Phoenix won, they would have played the Cavaliers in the Finals.  If the Cavaliers faced the Suns and won, Lebron would have stayed in Cleveland instead of going to the Heat and Mike Brown would have kept his job. If Lebron never went to the heat, they wouldn't have won another 2 championships in 2012 and 2013. Kevin Durant and the Thunder might have won their first championship and the Spurs might have won their fifth.  If the Suns won against the Cavaliers, Mike D'Antoni wouldn't have left the Suns and Steve Kerr wouldn't have been the GM. Most of that team would have re-signed, including Shawn Marion, Amar'e and Boris and many players wouldn't have been traded away (by Kerr).  Mike Brown and Mike D'Antoni both served as Lakers Head Coaches (D'Antoni went to the Knicks in between). Steve Nash also went to the Lakers."
"He's also gonna be 32 coming off what is historically a career ending injury, as a 7fter.  He'll be good. He won't be the Kevin Durant we know though."
"I didnt mean for that to be a shot at kd, just my point of view on their departures  Kevin durant is a legend to me"
The idea of Kevin Durant is better than Kevin Durant in reality.
"Michael Jordan, Yao Ming, LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Shaq, Charles Barkley, and Kobe Bryant."
&gt;  I haven’t heard any current player come out and say Giannis deserve it  &gt; &gt;Kevin Durant says Giannis is the regular season MVP
"You're super underselling Shaq as a businessman and a cultural icon in that. Shaq has way more off court ventures than KD. KD will have made more when his current contract is over, but Shaq is 60 million ahead as of now from ball alone.  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/kevin-durant-2717/cash-earnings/  https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/shaquille-oneal-2666/cash-earnings/"
"1.Steve Nash, Lebron, Tim Duncan  Kobe, Kevin Durant, KG  Magic, TMAC, Giannis  Rose, Jordan, Paul Pierce  5.Steph, Dwade, Dirk - although I think Steph and these guys are amazing, I can't keep putting Jordan lower. I think Magic/Tmac/Giannis just has a ton of athleticism and at the top I have Lebron cause he's hard to beat."
"You’re mistaken. Prime Arenas was a very good All Star caliber player. He was in no way remotely on the level of Nash, Kobe, or even Davis currently. Nobody ever referred to him on that level and his impact on the court never touched the level of those two. Just try try again.  You realize Anthony Davis has been consensus All NBA First Team and All Defense player every single year he’s healthy for most of his career? He’s not a scorer, or a defender, or a specific thing. He’s the equivalent of a 26 year old Kevin Durant or LeBron who just happened to be drafted by one of the worst run franchises in basketball. He literally comes back with a new BBall skill every year because he just adds it in the off season and even joined the Redeem Team as a college kid.  Jokic is a fantastic offensive center who’s an amazing passing big man who’s done great for himself in this league. He’s proven he’s the second best big man in the league despite his humble beginnings. But based on accomplishment and abilities thus far - he ain’t no Steve Nash, he ain’t no Kobe, and he ain’t no Anthony Davis."
Yes that was Mike Brown and not Kevin Durant on a 73 win team
"Duncan was incredible, but let’s not pretend Duncan was out there playing like Kevin Durant on the offensive end. He was definitely elite, but it’s not out of the question to ask if this version of AD who’s scoring 33 a game is better just on the offensive end."
"Dude.....What benefit do you gain from lying?, I always see you trolling about Durant. Kevin Durant was one of the better Harden defenders in the league &amp; in the series. Harden struggled against Durant more than any other warriors defender, he always called for the switch off of KD..... Durant is a really good onball defender....his legnth is just too bothersome for perimeter players    You’re also talking about how his lack of playmaking was a problem and how Houston wanted him to beat them but obviously that isn’t true.....Houston tried everything to stop KD, they doubled him in the post, They tried to put stocky short defenders on him to disrupt his balance, They tried to put centers on him to contest his shot but nothing worked. Without KD, warriors lose both series in 5 games both years. His playmaking and Iso ability is the weapon to beat a switching defense. Curry can’t create 1v1.  You also talked about how Durant struggled agaisnt the Spurs double teams? Why do you lie so much. KD torched the 2012 Spurs, 2016 Spurs, 2014 Spurs......He had no trouble with them and that’s with his team having zero spacing to work with....His creation/passing has improved since 2014 as well.    KD has flaws, But he’s still an undoubtedly much better player than Curry, especially in the playoffs. He’s actually a better passer and deals with tougher defense at a much higher level u/Dark22tj  You also mention KD’s 3pt shooting on the Thundering the playoffs, But you have to understand that The Thunder Had zero floor spacers....Guys like Harden are playing 5-out and still Are super inefficient .....If KD had shooters in OKC none of this would be a topic."
"Yeah, 100% this. The only non-dynasty teams he's played in the finals so far were the '11 Mavs and '12 Thunder, but rating the 2011 Mavs based on the regular season is selling Dirk's insane finals run short, and the '12 Thunder had friggin' Kevin Durant and were on a historic playoff tear themselves. The Heat and Celtics are both excellent teams, I don't think it's a fluke that they're in the conference finals, but neither of them has a player anywhere near the level of Dirk or KD (even a relatively young KD)."
"I mean does Durant not excel at basketball in a team game more than Curry?  KD led more top 50 win teams than Curry this decade and led more top 5 offenses since 2010.....so I’m not really seeing the advantage for Curry here. In fact, KD never went below 50 wins after age 22.....Curry did every year before Steve kerr  These impact stats or on/off you talk about also clearly Favor Kevin Durant in the playoffs where the actual best players shine.  Curry on a team level or individual level just isn’t as good as KD and that’s ok to admit."
Achilles will ruin a career easily. Look at Boogie. Kobe. It leads to even more injuries. Kevin Durant is not going to be himself moving forward.
Totally fair. Just don’t wanna hear anyone other than maybe Kevin Durant called the best player in the game.
is kevin durant anybody’s favorite player
There's this guy named kevin durant. You should look him up
Kevin Durant alternates between twitter and reddit these days
MPJ is the next Kevin Durant guys.
Better than Kyrie? Sure. Better than Kevin Durant? The fuck are you smoking?
"How? I'm not sure what the DPS analogy is supposed to be for - position? Probably not. Then what? Basketball is a team game and even looking at individual skills, the ultimate measurement is how much (extra) wins you can get the team. That includes leadership, getting the team going, mental toughness, clutchness, on top of individual skill sets.   Allen Iversion did one of the biggest carry jobs of all time. KG with the ass wolves got to the conf finals. Hell even Jimmy has proven himself time and time again. What has AD done with the Pels?   Everyone knows regular season matters little when we talk about top 10, top 5 type of players, it's all about playoff results and their contribution to it. Has AD proven much by himself? However this current run is looking very solid alongside Bron and even as a No.2 he's proving a lot as a top player in the playoffs.   He's top 5 for sure ""right now"" if we remove the injured players. Otherwise, are you taking him over: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James? Then you are in a debatable range with Harden, Kawhi, Giannis, and Luka (maybe add Jokic now too?) I know with the playoffs losts all of them look worse, but they are all their team's No.1 / leader. AD is doing great along with Lebron but would you really have him over all of the listed as the team's No.1 option? I'm not asking it in a way like it's impossible, I'm simply saying it's close. Top 5 is definitely not a lock."
"Relative true shooting percentages by year:  |Year number|Kevin Durant|Charles Barkley| |:-|:-|:-| |Year 1|\-2.1%|\+5.6%| |Year 2|\+3.3%|\+7.8%| |Year 3|\+6.4%|\+12.2%| |Year 4|\+4.8%|\+12.7%| |Year 5|\+8.3%|\+11.6%| |Year 6|\+11.2%|\+12.4%| |Year 7|\+9.4%|\+10.1%| |Year 8|\+9.9%|\+8.1%| |Year 9|\+9.3%|\+6.0%| |Year 10|\+9.8%|\+3.5%| |Year 11|\+8.4%|\+2.9%| |Year 12|\+7.4%|\+4.3%| |Year 13||\+4.5%| |Year 14||\+4.0%| |Year 15||\+3.5%| |Year 16||\+1.1%|  Both are hyperefficient, but peak Barkley was more efficient than peak KD."
"I think it's fair to expect a reasonable explanation of their decision making process behind their vote. If we're okay with a Whiteside DPoY vote because ""I don't follow 29/30 teams"", okay, but where do we draw the line? Would we be defending this voter if he'd picked Lou Williams for DPoY? How about Zion or Kevin Durant?"
KCP is a 3 and D role player who can give you a 10-15 point performance when you need it. Klay is a 3 and D All-Star who consistently puts up 20+ and was only the 3rd option because the first two were Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
"Brighter? The Clippers.   Until the entire Knicks organization changes, from the top down - starting with James Dolan - they're not going anywhere. And honestly, despite how terrible they are, the team keeps making more money. So Dolan has no reason to change &amp; isn't going to sell. So, they're just mediocre forever. He's also only 65-years-old. So you can expect at least another twenty years of mediocrity. And as we've heard from players like Kevin Durant recently, players are aware of the situation in the Knicks organization &amp; with MSG, so it'll be hard to get big names to go there too."
"If I was coaching a small ball team, that'd be my goal. One of the things about small ball teams/small ball era...Lebron feasts. When the Center is smaller than lebron theres literally no way from stopping him from getting to the basket at will, theres no one in the history of basketball that I've seen with the size/agility package around the basket that lebron has. Even with the pre-kd warriors, they pretty quickly realized they had no chance of stopping him...you gotta play fast and eliminate his teammates and have your 5 outscore him. Hope you win like 100-90 with lebron scoring 65 points and literally not being able to win an entire basketball game by himself. If lbj turns it into a 5/5 game...you probably can't win.  I think the lakers are a terrible match up for the nuggets because Jokic is their center and he doesn't protect the rim....Lakers in 5. Lebron losses have come against guys like Tim duncan, kevin durant, steph curry...all top 15 guys. He def smells blood rn."
“Irrational hatred”  Kevin Durant.. you know who he is
"Kevin Durant and Steph Curry are part of everyone, yes"
Kevin Durant loves him and since he’s basically the GM of the nets you may be able to get a Jared Allen or Dinwiddie for him
Works for Kevin Durant and Steph Curry as well
"Sure, that was actually a part of my point. The Clippers have gotten amazing free agents, and they are historically, in my opinion, the worst franchise in the NBA. At least the hornets don't get free agents. Their last season was more impressive than this one, too. It's funny you mentioned the Clippers cause the exact same thing happened there: A top player signs cause it's la, and he brings another amazing player, that wants to form a duo, in a trade. If the Clippers got LeBron and AD and the Lakers got Kawhi and Paul George, the clippers would be amazing.   You're treating this like it's the warriors. First they got iggy. While not as impressive as developing a star, they managed to form a team good enough that a star saw their potential. Let's not pretend LeBron came to the Lakers as a result of the CURRENT Lakers management. They didn't even make the playoffs the first year. Such a good support when you're injured, right? Kevin Durant to the warriors? Insane signing. Another Iggy, this time after further success which mainly came from good choices and player development. Sure, it's annoying, but he went there as a result of the current players, which were all warriors. Davis went to the Lakers after LeBron wanted to play there, again, all the GM had to do was work for an LA team that has actually had amazing success.  This is like a rich kid bragging about his parents, he did absolutely nothing to achieve that, other people (Lebron) did it for him."
He couldn't guard Kevin Durant.
"so, there was news kawhi wanted kevin durant. it was clear KD was out for the season. so that makes me think, kawhi was fine waiting for another year before challenging for a title. if that is case, then wouldnt it have been smart to keep those picks and youngsters for a year before making the necessary adjustments or going all in for a player they are sure would work instead of wasting them all on PG. PG is a good player but is he really worth all that they gave up for him"

Kevin Durant on the warriors
"It is every coaches dream to coach a Kevin Durant, you can fit and plug him"
"It's also because Steph was the logical point of attack for much of GSW's run.  Even if Steph is a decent defender (which he is--not great, but decent) when you put him next to Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant it makes sense to go at Steph."
"Yeah, he went back and made good. I'd probably feel the same way if Kevin Durant went back to Oklahoma and got the Thunder a championship."

Kevin 'Medusa' Durant

Kevin Durant admitted he didn’t want to be on the big stage so it definitely exists
Bro this is Kevin Durant in the east. Brooklyn are a lock for top two.
" It is every coaches dream to coach a Kevin Durant, you can fit and plug him into any system or offensive scheme and KD will make the game unfair (assuming he comes back still a top 5 player)"
"I don't really agree with ANY of these over the guys who actually got them but here's a list of potential MVP years for LeBron:  05-06: Maybe his ""breakout"" year, one of only two 30+ point seasons in his career, looking back at the roster it's amazing they made the playoffs. Nash's 2nd MVP was a good choice though.  06-07: Dirk clearly deserved it but if you need a better idea of how good LeBron was look no further than the Piston's series in that year's playoffs (obviously MVP is long decided by then, but it's a good illustrative example of LeBron's first Cleveland stint): LeBron dragged the Cavs to the Finals and took over games against a great team, including a game where he scores his team's final 25 points and 29 of their final 30. Cavs get past a better Piston's team because they have the best player in the series.  07-08: I actually don't agree with Kobe winning this year, but only because Chris Paul had a ridiculous season that year and I swear people voted for Kobe more because he should have had an MVP at some point in his career than because  *this* was the year he deserved it.  10-11: coming off two MVPs and what would have made five straight MVPs, LeBron lost the MVP to Derrick Rose (and it wasn't close: Rose got 113 of 120 first-place votes). There was *probably* voter fatgiue and LeBron *probably* lost votes for his Miami move the previous offseason, but Rose had a great season. And having Wade and Bosh at their peaks alongside him probably made people think that LeBron wasn't contributing as huge a percentage as he was to the Cavs in his previous two MVPs (his playoff woes after the previous two MVPs probably didn't help).  13-14: Lebron is coming off of two MVPs and two Championships, but Kevin Durant is really good and runs away with the MVP. LeBron is also starting to LeCoast during the regular season this year. Could argue some voter fatgiue and the fact that LeBron was starting to shoulder more of the burden in Miami as Wade was slowing down, but Durant was great that year and the MVP vote shows it.  14-15 and 15-16: LeBron goes back to Cleveland and forms another super team, but the fucking Warriors are historically good with 67 and 73 win seasons. Don't see how you can argue for coasting LeBron over that (even if he manages to win a trophy one of those years, but the MVP is decided by then and is a regular season award and the MVP just had to be from the Warriors these years). And Curry's 15-16 is just a stupid year.  After that, I don't think there's a great arguement for LeBron. He has great years but is clearly saving himself for the playoffs in 16-17 and 17-18.  10-11 and 13-14 are probably the most obvious ones, but there are good basketball arguements for why he didn't win.  Great years by LeBron for sure, but Rose and Durant were deserving choices. I don't think any other year is as reasonable as either of those (although, look back it's hard to argue that LeBron wasn't the only thing keeping the Cavs from being a lottery team in his first stint there).  **TLDR:** *Maybe* you could argue for two years where he reasonably could have won, but I don't think it's crazy that he didn't.  And the best argument for vote fatigue goes to MJ in 96-97. He barley lost the MVP to Malone that year and was just obviously the better player. LeBron never had a year where he was as close to winning as MJ in 96-97."

"I’m going to assume you are new to following this league. The Warriors had a drop off because Steph Curry + Klay Thompson had injuries and Kevin Durant signed with the Nets because his contract was up, making him a free agent. I really really really don’t mean to sound like a dick but if you follow the league even just a little bit you should’ve known the reason for their drop off this year. They should be very competitive next season tho."
"She makes up her gossip   Im basing this off one encounter.    Last year i worked in the Raptors arena during practices on non-game days. The Warriors were having practice and their security asked us to make sure no media people come into the bowl/court. Pretty easy to do and we did it well.  This was the practice after Durant got injured and they didnt know if he was going to play game 5.    I hung around the visitor locker room to make sure nobody was recording near the end of practice. The whole time Ramona did not see Kevin Durant. She was busy talking to someone when he passed by. She left after that.   Later that afternoon, she tweeted something like she saw Durant play and he didn't look good. And im like wtf you literally didnt see any of the practice. You stood in a hallway talking to people the whole time."
"They didn't lose game 7 because of draymond, he had the best game of anyone on the warriors. And this has nothing to do with curry so I don't know why you brought him up. The cavs won the title [and still tried to get kd] (https://www.si.com/nba/2019/03/12/lebron-james-recruited-kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-cleveland-cavaliers-2016) shocking that a team would try to get the best available free agent to try and improve their chances."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant is all about logic and reasoning. No childish behaviour from that man, no sir."

Can we all just admit LeBron has been the actual MVP for like 15 straight years?   The only reason he doesn't win it every year is because that would be boring.  Some of the guys that have won it over him in that time period are a joke. The most comical to me is Derick Rose. Derick Rose has never been anywhere near Lebron's level. He was also way better than Harden. Kevin Durant and Steph were MVP worthy but IMO LeBron was still better than them too.  He's obviously better than Giannis. Lebron would never lose 4-1 in the second round of the east to the freaking Miami Heat.
"I dont wanna shock you but we have the 2nd overall pick this year, and the warriors arent half bad at this whole ""identify talent"" thing.  Plus FA.  It doesnt need to be Kevin Durant, it just needs to be competent and complementary so that we save the Splash legs.  I'm not saying its easy, but, y'know, who will be surprised to see it happen?"
"Also Boston fans: ""But he's actually playing better than Kyrie did""  As much as Kemba has struggled, Kyrie was worse.        Foo | Kemba| Kyrie ---|---|---- PPG| 19.8| 21.3 Games Played | 13| 9 Games under 37 FG%| 4| 7 20+ FGA games | 1 | 5  TS% for playoffs| 56.4| 48.8 Did he keep playing defence| Yes | No  The efficiency gap between Kemba and Kyrie in their Boston runs (7.6) is pretty absurd. That's getting close to the career efficiency gap between Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook (8.3).  * Kemba has been more efficient, he's tried to give the ball up when he's cold and he keeps playing defence.  * Kyrie was less efficient, he ball-hogged in spite of his inefficiency, he stopped playing defence outside of trying to 1v1 Giannis.   Nets fans: ""Yeah but Kemba didn't score 100 points on 5 shots every game, that means the guy who just got our coach fired is actually a really good person."""
"Tbh, I watched him after Kevin Durant mentioned him in JJ Redick's podcast."
"Funny enough, i remember that Horse event in the all-star game. Particularly rondo vs kevin fucking durant lmao  Durant won his second trophy then"
"If it was only sort-of close, I would agree with you. But LeBron was one vote shy of unanimous MVP, and that vote didn't even go to Kevin Durant, the runner up in 12-13. It went to Carmelo Anthony, for no reason other than spite. LeBron averaged 26/8/7 on a 56/40/75 split and led the Heat to a 66 win season, a full 12 games above the Knicks. He was unstoppable. Miami won 27 games in a row at one point. It's fucking bullshit that Steph Curry gets to hold the title of ""first-ever"" unanimous MVP when LeBron was denied because one voter decided to shove their head up their own ass and spew a bullshit take that Carmelo Anthony was the most valuable player. Curry is/was a transcendent player that accomplished a lot, but ""first unanimous MVP"" is a title with no meaning because it should have, and effectively was, LeBron."
"I honestly want nothing else. Pure ""Y'all MF's forgot bout me""  decimation through their Respective Conference Playoffs resulting in a 7 game thriller between Skyfucker and Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant. Never know till you know,ya know?😌  (Also: Forgot about dre will be a meme when he drops a near quintuple double with 9 points next year, !invest)"
Kevin Durant - Jamie Foxx     Steven Adams - Jason Momoa

"“Help me Kevin Durant, you’re my only hope”"
"People need to stop with this MJ crap. MJ won his first title because the Pistons got old and Lakers and Celtics fell off while at the same time Pippen because the star he would become.  It's not even close like with Giannas were there are multiple teams with multiple super stars in their primes that are already paired up.  Kevin Durant, and Kyrie in Brooklyn  Lebron and AD  Steph and Klay  It's dumb to just say hey Giannas win it on your own now"

In an era where a 73-9 team added Kevin Durant, Daryl Morey build a team to almost knocking them out twice, the closest any team has gotten to knock out the Durant/Curry Warriors.  teams were literally giving up, waiting for the Warriors dynasty to end.

"Eagle has nothing but high praise for Irving and he believes the Duke product is right at home at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center. “Kyrie, he is a really likeable guy,” he tells Heavy Live With Scoop B.  “And it’s pretty amazing to me how the narratives take over and I get it. The world that we live in now – when you’re looking for clicks, when you’re looking to create stories… things happen. They take on a life of their own. I can only judge things based on my experience. He’s really a thoughtful dude. He’s a deep guy. This is a not an on the surface person. And when you talk to him, he connects. He engages with you and some people can’t handle that; that doesn’t work for them. They’re not used to having THAT kind of laser focus put on them. I’ve been very impressed with him in my personal dealings and I know we’re gonna get into it deeper here…I just think that him and Kevin Durant have something special and they’re paying attention to everything that’s being said. They’re aware the only way to change it is to go out and win. That’s what it comes down to. People can talk and we know in the NBA, people love to talk. The NBA has this other world that takes place that has nothing to do with the games, nothing to do with the score. It has nothing to do with the stats. It has everything to do with the storylines and the NBA’s benefitted from that. There’s that very fine line as we know in the NBA; sometimes there’s more hype in everything leading up to it than the actual events. And there’s been a lot of conversation in regards to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. I just think the two of these guys are fully prepared and they want to do something really special in Brooklyn.”"
Kevin Durant was the second option on a championship team. He’s still a top 3 scorer all time.
"LeDon Draper &amp; Kevin ""Pete Campbell"" Durant"
"The thing is, him going to Golden State ruined all of our perceptions of him skill wise. Spending 3 years on the most overpowered team ever just makes everyone forget what he can do, which is why you don't exactly hear about him being such an extremely elite and once in a lifetime superstar that he is  Now I'm watching Kevin Durant Golden State highlights and it still looks weird to me lol"
i would like to see you 1v1 kevin durant
Kevin Durant has struggled so far in 2020  i think he’d be alright
"Basketball is ALL about the bench press.  Remember that combine bust, Kevin Durant? Wonder what happened to him."
2010 Kevin Durant. Though his first playoff was worse than Doncic he was projecting to be the greatest scorer ever. He never upped his usage to those rates unfortunately but still.
Kevin Durant...
" 11. Hakeem Olajuwon  12. Kevin Durant  13. Moses Malone  14. Julius Erving  15. Jerry West  16. Dwyane Wade  17. Stephen Curry  18. Dirk Nowitzki  19. Oscar Robertson  20. David Robinson  Moses Malone and David Robinson are criminally underrated. Curry is probably going to finish top 15 by the end of his career. If his ABA career was taken into account, Erving is probably in the top 10  My next 5 would be: Karl Malone, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, George Mikan, Kevin Garnett"
"Delusion, thy name is Kevin Durant."
I think y’all are sleeping on the nets. They have Kevin freaking Durant on their team. And Kyrie who is a top five point guard. They will be contenders and could easily win the chip potentially.
"2018 vs the Rockets was simple, the Rockets were also a very great team, but were also built, literally, to be great at everything you needed to be great at to stand a chance against the Warriors. The Warriors also, mentally, weren't ready for such a strong fight. KD averaged 30 points, but his efficiency was terrible compared to KD's standards. And Steph averaged 25 on below average efficiency.   In 2019 kevin durant literally got injured 🤦‍♀️ maybe thats got something to do with it, idk"
Kevin Durant   He gets hurt more than people realize   2015   2017 ankle injury which GSW initially really thought was a broken ankle he dodged a bullet   2019  Missed 10-15 games in 2016 and 2018  Kyrie isn’t quite good enough for JJ watt status but same relative idea. Could also go JJ Watt
You mean like Kevin Durant?
"**Perspective from a pure business &amp; box office value standpoint:**  1. **LeBron James** - Dude is still the biggest draw in the NBA, he sells the most jerseys/merch and brings in new audiences into your organization. Even if he's aging, he'll still bring in loads of money and championships with the 3-4 potential years you have left with him, and that can arguably be way more valuable financially than a 20 year old up-and-comer. 2. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - The best of all worlds - b2b MVP, explosive box office talent, and also a superstar for championships for many years to come. If LeBron only had perhaps only 2 seasons left to play, then I would switch LeBron &amp; Giannis. 3. **Luka Doncic** - Highest youth/potential attributes. Can't pass up Luka over anyone under him due to the possibilities the future holds for his career. 4. **Anthony Davis** - Isn't top 3 only due to his injury history. Other than that, a no-brainer. 5. **Jayson Tatum** - Just like Luka, youth/potential but with less draw. 6. **Steph Curry** - Still a big draw, and he's definitely on the older side of 30.. however, his game remains age-friendly as a lot of his prowess comes from his shot making capability. 7. **James Harden** - I can see him doing his thing for another 3 years before falling off, but he just brings so much value overall that he has to be on this list somewhere. 8. **Zion Williamson** - It's Zion. Even if he doesn't live up to the hype, the dude is looked at as pure entertainment.  9. **Kawhi Leonard** - A powerhouse talent with a good amount of years left in him. 10. **Nikola Jokic** - Much like Kawhi, he isn't the biggest draw but he's got everything else. Youth, potential, talent and a fairly good track record towards win value.  **Honorable mentions:** *Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, Trae Young, Ben Simmons*  **Perspective from a pure basketball talent value contributing towards the best chance for winning championships:**  1. **LeBron James** - Still LeBron at #1. Some of the players listed below him might not even sniff the Finals (again, or ever), while LeBron even with only 3-4 years left to play could have the most potential to get another chip. 2. **Kawhi Leonard** - Yes he choked hard this year, but it's not like Kawhi suddenly lost his track record of winning. I would still take him over any player under him for at least 4 more years. 3. **Luka Doncic** - He's already shown that he's likely gonna be a MVP candidate and a centerpiece for a team at age 20. Undeniably the best of both worlds player in terms of youth/talent. 4. **Anthony Davis** - He doesn't seem like he can play the alpha role, but regardless, the talent level is through the roof. Still relatively young as well, but slight issue once again with his injury history. 5. **Nikola Jokic** - Best center in the league and also has the youth. He's also shown he can make a winning environment around him. 6. **Giannis Antetokounmpo** - He gets knocked down a few pegs due to his lack of winning intangibles yet to be shown. But he's still pretty young and his talent is ridiculous so that keeps him in the top 4. 7. **Kevin Durant** - This is the big ""what if"" sorta thing. What if he can return back to his normal self following his injury? Arguably the best player in the league if he does, for at least another 2-3 years. Also, he has age-friendly talent. 8. **Donovan Mitchell** - This is my bias pick. I just believe in him. The dude has some of the best intangibles I've seen in a young player. Overall love his demeanor and he shows a bit of that mamba mentality. 9. **Jayson Tatum** - The youth is strong on him, and also has shown he's able to improve year after year. He's shown me enough to allow me to acknowledge that he can be big-time. 10. **Damian Lillard** - If he was in the right situation, he probably would have had a few chips under his belt. He has the mindset I look for most in a player - just a killer mentality and insane work ethic and love for his craft.  **Honorable mention:** *Jimmy Butler, Jamal Murray, Devin Booker*  **Q &amp; A:**  1. *Q: ""Why the disrespect on Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons bruh?""*  **A: Embiid has a horrid injury history. More importantly, he also has shown no winning intangibles and his work ethic is not admirable to me. Previous sentence also applies to Ben Simmons, except it's worse for him.**  2. *Q: ""No KAT anywhere? Not even an honorable mention?""*  **A: KAT is an amazing talent.. like unbelievable talent for his position. But, he doesn't have any box office draw nor has he shown any winning intangibles. He looks like he plays for individual accolades and nothing much more beyond that.**  3. *Q: ""Why are you doing a Q &amp; A by yourself, with questions made up by your own? You're so narcissistic.""*  **A: I don't know why... maybe I should delete this section...... NAHHH! Just hit submit!**"
"Right so he's won 2 MVP and has averaged 23.7/11/4.8 in the playoffs (40 games total) despite only being 25 years old but he can't carry a championship team. Thats a poor take if you're gonna say Giannis cant carry a championship team because he hasnt won a ring by age 25 then you've gotta say James Harden/Paul George/Nikola Jokic/Joel Embiid/Kevin Durant cant carry a championship team either cause none of those guys have won a ring ""carrying"" a team. Hell in a couple of years you can add luka too that category too after lebron and AD threepeat."
Has been since GS.  Bron cannot and will not guard him; actively switches off even to a smaller defender. KD willingly guards Bron and is better than average at it.  KD scores better.

"DeMarcus Cousins  and Kevin Durant.  Cousins is an all-world talent and better than AD, some of you forgot that because of recent injury history. You talk about his shit attitude. He was with a legendarily shit organization for 7 years that completely wasted his talent and disrespected him. Stops in  NOLA, GS, and LAL and people loved him.   Nobody likes KD because burner accounts and he's  better than media golden boy LBJ."
"Excerpts from the article:  Bondy reports that KD and Kyrie are working with Nike on design. It’s only right. It was a Nike rep, Jeff Rogers who connected them on a text group back when the two were kids.  Bondy recounted what noted designer Ben Nethongkome told him about the collaboration.  When Kyrie Irving first saw the latest model of his Nike line, he immediately contacted Kevin Durant to brag. And also to compare.  “He was like, ‘Look at this heat I have in my hand,’” said Ben Nethongkome, who designed the Kyrie 7 sneaker with Irving. “And there was some friendly competitiveness to them too, like, ‘Whose shoe is better?’” It didn’t take long for the two players/friends/entrepreneurs to turn to working together.  “It kind of spawned into, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we collaborated on something together in the near future?’” Nethonkome said. “And right then and there, KD was like, ‘Of course.’ So we’re excited to have some level of interaction between those two in terms of product creation in the near future.”  It’s big news in sneakerdom, Bondy argues. There’s no indication of when the KD-and-Ky product will come to market. Nethongkome also spoke to Bondy about changes in style of play can lead to changes in game-worn wear.  “Kyrie talked about last night, how his role on the Nets is a little different now because he’s got to facilitate for his players. He didn’t have KD previously, now he does,” Nethonkome told Bondy.  “And so he’s not trying to attack one-on-one anymore, he’s thinking about getting around guys to distribute the ball somewhere else. So his movement on the court is going to broaden a lot more. And so with the 7 being lighter weight, he feels like he be all over the court much easier than the Kyrie 6 or the Kyrie 5. So we’re excited to hear that.”"

All you have to know is Kevin Durant is the biggest pussy in sports (yes not just nba) history and everyone else is pretty much chill.
So Kevin Durant has (-2) all nba teams? How does that work?
"It’s possible to be efficient and not skilled. There’s a reason Giannis gets exposed offensively in the playoffs. He has mediocre basketball IQ and an inability to generate a bucket in the half court when a defense crowds the paint / plays zone.   Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Lebron James, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, Stephen Curry, James Harden are players I trust to get me a bucket when I need it most. They can beat double teams, shoot over defenders, and so on. At the very least they have the ability to play make out of a double team.   Giannis needs to develop at least a jump shot to be considered a *skilled* offense player."
"Here's the explanation from the article on the tier 1A/B guys. I'm going to omit some of the tables and graphics just because that would take some time to upload, but I can do so if people are interested:  **Tier 1B: The Great Unknowns**  This group consists of two all-time greats with big questions after they missed all or most of the 2019-20 season. On past production and achievement, each would easily fit into Tier 1A, but after last season there are questions.  **Kevin Durant:**  Let’s get this out of the way up front: I have no idea what a post-Achilles-tear Kevin Durant looks like and neither does anyone else. He’s in this category, for now, because of three reasons.  First is just as recognition of where he was as a player prior to the injury; he’d be not just Tier 1A, but also in the discussion for Tier 1A+ with LeBron James. Second, this is where the Nets need him to be for their gamble on him last offseason to be likely to pay off. I’ve tried to avoid tiering on wish fulfillment as much as possible, but Durant is an inflection point possibly for the entire league. Finally, it is a matter of convenience to have the space to discuss KD at length at the start of this tier rather than buried under the 5,800 words in the Tier 2 write-up. But what can we expect? Past history suggests he won’t be as good. From the linked 2013 study:  Seven players never returned to play an NBA game, whereas 11 players returned to play 1 season, with 8 of those players returning for ≥2 seasons. Players who returned missed an average of 55.9 games. The PER was reduced by 4.57 (P = .003) in the first season and by 4.38 (P = .010) in the second season. When compared with controls, players demonstrated a significant decline in the PER the first season (P = .038) and second season (P = .081) after their return.  That’s a sizable decline, but recall where Durant is declining from. PER is an imperfect, offense-focused measure, but on that metric, a 4-4.5 decline from his peak would still give Durant somewhere around the 10th to 15th highest mark in the league. There simply hasn’t been a player on Durant’s level to suffer this injury before, and we’re left to wonder what parts of his game are more likely to be affected than others and how that changes his profile. Some of the problems of comparing pre- and post-Achilles injury production is that several prominent players who suffered the injury either never really returned to significant action (Mehmet Okur and Mario Chalmers) or were already deep into their 30s, complicating the evaluation of declines given those seasons were in age ranges where a sizable diminution in ability should be expected (Kobe Bryant and Chauncey Billups).  Further, some players aren’t really apposite comparisons, either because of a completely different positionality (Brandon Jennings) or that they were players on the fringe prior to the injury (Jonas Jerebko). That leaves a few examples of starter-level players of similar age (Durant was 30 at the time of the injury) and at least passingly similar size or style of play. Elton Brand and Wes Matthews suffered their injuries at 28, while Rudy Gay was 30. The areas I would most expect to see an injury-related decline to show up would be in rim-finishing and foul-drawing. Additionally, I wanted to look at overall defensive effectiveness, as this has been an enormous part of Durant’s postseason value over his career. Here are the relevant stats in the three to four seasons (depending on the timing of the injury and return to play) before and after each player suffered his injury:  There is a little bit of a range of best, medium and worst cases between the three, but we can probably anticipate some decline in Durant’s ability to get to the rim and perhaps his finishing once he does, while possible effects on defense are more equivocal. If I were an optimist, I would suggest that Gay is the most similar to Durant in terms of both style of play and body type, though it should be noted that Gay is significantly stronger and bulkier, so perhaps better able to compensate for decreased mobility with increased physicality. Durant also has some attributes Gay does not. He’s still close to 7 feet tall with an enormous wingspan, and one of the great jump shooters of all time:  Among the players named up there, Durant has managed this with the most difficult mix of shots by a decent margin. Only 19.7 percent of his 3-pointers have been uncontested, the next lowest percentage among those players is Tatum at 34.2 percent, ranging up to McDermott at 48.5 percent. This suggests that from an efficiency standpoint, Durant has some wiggle room by increasing his shot quality, something that should be possible given the sheer amount of on-ball creation ability the Nets have between Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert.  Barring the absolute worst-case scenario of Durant being functionally done (an outcome for which there has been no evidence of even suggestion of as a possibility), Khris Middleton in Tier 3A seems like an absolute floor for his offensive contributions:  That outcome still represents complete disaster for Brooklyn — one of the reasons I find the early over/under line of a 49.5 win pace for the Nets to be extremely interesting is that based on Durant’s outcome they are likely to be either much better or much worse with not much in between.  As a final point, there are all kinds of reasons why comparisons between the leagues are fraught, but it’s fair to say Breanna Stewart is of similar stature in the WNBA as KD is in the NBA. Here are her last two postseason lines, one before and one a full season after her own Achilles tear:  Though Stewart suffered the injury at 24 instead of 30, her averaging 28/8/4 on 50/50/85 shooting splits has to be taken as a good sign for KD.  **Stephen Curry:**  It feels a little dirty to not have him higher, but he’s 32 and it’s been four full years since he’s been asked to be the main focus of a team. I’m certainly interested in seeing what he looks like at the center of a more heliocentric offense. With the players in Tier 1A, we’ve seen them be that, in several cases over multiple years.  I don’t think I have to go too much into Curry’s game-breaking, court-geometry warping impacts. As the chart above discussing Durant shows, Curry is on the very shortlist for the best shooter of this or any other era. While Kyle Korver might have an edge in “alone in the gym” shooting skill and was an assuredly elite catch-and-shooter off of movement, Curry’s ability to do that plus do the same off the bounce is what lets him to surpass Korver as a “game-effective” shooter. Curry is the only player in the tracking data era who has attempted at least 250 pull-up 3FGA to make at least 40 percent of them (sitting at 41.3 percent, more than two full percentage points ahead of Chris Paul, in second place at 39.2 percent). Among the 10 top-line metrics I used for this exercise, Curry is first among minutes qualified players in:  * 5-year RAPM * 3-year PIPM * 3-year ORAPM * 3-year OPIPM * … and second in 3-year RAPM.  All of which is to say, if that player is what we get after what was basically a gap year, he’s Tier 1A with ease. But there is enough uncertainty that he is just a half step down. For now.  **Tier 1A: The Best of the Best**  Assuming health and/or sufficient playing time, these are players who could be penciled into four of the five First Team slots almost from the start of the season. It’s no accident this group contains the last three MVP winners as well as the last two Finals MVP recipients. Start with one of these players and you have a huge leg up toward championship contention. They don’t guarantee contention on their own, as there is too much talent across the league for any one player to have that kind of impact. But the margin of error is wider and the number of possible paths to the kind of roster that can contend is greater.  **Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden:**   Let me lead with a stat here. Since the 2010-11 season, 19 players have been named to All-NBA First Team at least once. It’s not a perfect overlap, but this is a reasonable first pass at players who have met the general criteria for Tier 1 in terms of being able to lead a team to the Finals as the best player. Of those 19, only five (LeBron, Steph, KD, Kawhi and Tim Duncan) have actually been the best player on a Finals team over the same period. Which is to say that in a league whereby definition only two teams can make the Finals each season (and one player has been the best player on 45 percent of the Finals teams over that period), the set of players who are good enough is far broader than the set who actually have. Managing a championship roster is hard, and it’s no accident that depending on how you count, around three-quarters of this decade’s Finalists were superteams of one form or another — I would certainly count all five Warriors, all four Heat and the first three Cavaliers among that group, as well as the 2012 Thunder, and we can quibble about the 2013 and 2014 Spurs or 2019 Raptors."
"Not completely related, but I actually just compared the top 100 scorers over the regular season and playoffs for the last three years (only 52 qualified if the list looks confusing).     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZigJQbCWRsmka2OI3UT65gL6TiezFby0WBCzlb6vp2A/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZigJQbCWRsmka2OI3UT65gL6TiezFby0WBCzlb6vp2A/edit#gid=0)     The right side is the guys with the biggest improvements from regular season to playoffs in terms of points per possession and true shooting percentage.     13 guys with at least 300 minutes played in the playoffs and 3000 minutes played over the regular season since 2018 improved their scoring rates.     1. Jamal Murray (+4.1) 2. LeBron James (+3.9) 3. Nikola Jokic (+2.3) 4. Jrue Holiday (+2.2) 5. Donovan Mitchell (+2.1) 6. Kevin Durant (+1.6) 7. Anthony Davis (+1.2) 8. Goran Dragic (+1.2) 9. Jaylen Brown (+1.1) 10. Jayson Tatum (+0.6) 11. CJ McCollum (+0.5) 12. Montrezl Harrell (+0.1) 13. Kawhi Leonard (+0.1)  I'd say CJ McCollum is a good one, as Dame has consistently had bad playoff performances and CJ does a good job of stepping up to maintain that load.  Murray and Jokic being #1 and #3 is interesting too.  Was also surprised by Montrezl as he was a trainwreck this playoffs, so his 2019 series must have been better than I realised.     That's just scoring though, plenty of other facets that players could be doing that aren't recognised here."
Well Lue took over the team that was in a bit of disarray in 2016 and they won the title against the Warriors. The 2017 team was a historically great offense that ran into that 73 win team that added Kevin Durant. The 2018 roster was a dumpster fire.  What’s the sample size to say that Lue is a bad coach? Are we forgetting that Vogel looked like a horrible coach with the Magic?
Kevin Durant is the player
He didnt just with MVP and DPOY because he's bad. Luka &gt; Giannis and Giannis &gt; Luka are both very reasonable takes.   You're making it seem like he said Khris Middleton is better than Kevin Durant
"Na, IMO he's specifically talking about 60 foot heaves at the end of quarters. For instance, [KD has said he doesn't shoot those](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-sometimes-doesn-t-want-chuck-low-220357263--nba.html?y20=1) because it affects his splits.  But in the context of the game there is no reason to not shoot those because they help you win. That's what Steph cares about at the end of the day, and he's also good at heaves. In this instance Kerr is saying that he loves that Steph doesn't give af about shooting 2/11 in a game, he'll still shoot the 60 footer at the end of of a quarter to give the team a shot at putting up 3 more points.  You're talking about him just being to shoot how far he wants whenever he wants, not specifically at the end of the quarter."
Top 5 Offensive Players  1. Michael Jordan 2. Wit Chamberlain 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kobe Bryant 5. James Harden
I dont get how we cant legitimate the championship AND have a conversation about how unrealistic the basketball was in the bubble. I feel like every time someone brings up one the other gets thrown in the mix to bring the other point down. TJ Warren was prime Kevin Durant in the bubble. Rajon Rondo was prime Steve Kerr in the bubble. Anthony Davis was prime Dirk Nowtizki in the bubble. Jamal Murray was unanimous MVP Steph Curry in the bubble and so on and so on. None of those guys will shoot as well as they did outside the bubble and the data proves it time and time again. And that's okay.
"[Tony Allen ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2039670-is-tony-allen-the-memphis-grizzlies-kevin-durant-stopper)  &gt; I will never forget chatting with Tony Allen two seasons ago about how he squirmed around pin-down screens designed to free Kevin Durant for jumpers. He didn’t accept the fundamental basis of the question — that it was a hard thing to do. “You just do it,” he would say. I would counter: “OK, so, there is one large man running at you with the singular goal of blocking your path, and a slithery 7-foot scorer directing you into that large man’s chest. What is the best strategy for avoiding that large man?” **And he would respond, again and again: “You just do it. You don’t get screened.”**  No one is stopping KD, but you need that mentality, individually and as a team to slow him down and make him work.  If you recall, Kobe specifically called out Tony Allen."
Hey Lebron is that you? are you Kevin Durant either?
"If I had to come up with a starting 5 who can legitimately cover all 5 positions I like to think about it this way... Can they guard James Harden? Can they guard Shaq?   Pippen could guard 1-4 easy... But he would struggle with a Shaq kind of guy   Bird could guard 2-4 but he's a bit slow covering a Harden/Curry and a bit too small to take on a Shaq/Robinson  Ben Simmons? I think he could guard all 5.  Magic? Again all 5. Lebron? He has little experience guarding centers but I think he could do it. Giannis? Probably struggles with the 1. He's fast. But I think he would struggle man up against Harden.  Rodman? Guards all 5.   The problem is finding guys to space the floor who can guard the 1 and 5. There's few if any who could do all that.   Lebron .344 Simmons .083 Magic .303 Rodman .231 Giannis .284 Luka .321 Bird .376 Durant .381 Pippen .326 Jokic .338 Garnett .275 Draymond .319 Havlicek... No 3pt line  Spot #1 Dennis Rodman 6-8 Rodman is #1 when it comes to guys who could guard the best ever at every spot. He was physical enough to be a small ball center against the best. And quick enough to cover Harden or Curry.   Spot #2 Ben Simmons 6-11 Can't shoot, can pass and defend with the best ever. Could match up with Shaq and also be the man coverage you choose vs Allen Iverson. I dislike this choice but struggle not to make it.  Spot #3 Magic Johnson 6-9 Can defend a center and skyhook with the best. Can facilitate as the point guard and even without his height would still be top tier.   Spot #4 Kevin Durant 7-0 Taller than he says, terrific shooter from everywhere on the court. Might struggle with 1 and 5 but won't lose a game for you. Tall and quick enough to push back threes from a 1, whilst being much faster than any post banging 5.   Spot #5 LeBron James 6-8 Great at... Well everything. Low effort of defense. Great in the paint, great facilitator, good rebounder, solid shooter. Would struggle with the leagues premier 1's and 5's but like durant, won't lose you the ballgame.   Offensively... 1. Magic 2. James 3. Durant 4. Simmons 5. Rodman   You struggle to shoot a 3 with this team, but pick and rolls would be unstoppable.   There isn't a single team in history that could hope to guard this team despite Rodman's sub par offense."
Kevin Durant tore his achilles. It's a bit too early to call him the best player in the East.
I think you’re forgetting Kevin Durant
"https://www.google.ca/amp/s/kingjamesgospel.com/2017/06/02/lebron-james-says-kevin-durant-difference-warriors/amp/  Lebron said it.   It’s clear as day. Again, the Warriors one ring without Durant was against who??? Please write me the Cavs starting 5.  The next year without Durant, what happened? Lost a 3-1 lead.   The Clippers blow a 3-1 lead and everyone laughs. The Warriors blow a 3-1 lead and this clown is saying they were 4 points away. Lmao fuck up. The nba has the worst fans. Double standard goofs. Almost winning is losing. You don’t almost have a ring. That’s never a real argument.   Give me some evidence to back up your point.  Lmao, foh"
"If an injury defines a player, then add Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, etc. to that list of players. Athletes get injured in any sport"
"What? According to who?   Kevin Durant was the difference maker.   The Warriors sole championship without him came against an injury riddled Cavaliers.  You’re the worst type of fan. If Durant lost while on Warriors you’d kill him, but when he wins, it doesn’t matter because he “could play bad and they still win”   Lmao, fuck out of here  Give credit when due buddy"
"Kevin Durant in terms of pure skill, is comparable to anyone in your top-10 greatest players list.   His departure from OKC was messy, and people see him as a snake that left to a team that beat him blah blah blah   BUT, remember this, he was the best player on the Warriors (arguably the best team ever), and outside of LeBron he was the clearcut best player come playoff time.   You can be on a stacked team and still lose, just look at the Clippers this season. It’s not as easy as being on the favourite team. LeBron also flopped in 2011.   Durant’s two rings might not be as heavy as Dirk’s one ring, but he’s without a doubt just outside top-10 greatest players ever."
Is someone gonna post that Dion Waiters Kevin Durant pasta
"Add 2015 too.   07: 22 year old Bron beats Prime Spurs and Cavs first title  15: Bron beats a rising GSW without Kyrie or Love  17: After losing to the 73-9 GSW, Bron gets a dub on GSW who adds NBA Champion Prime Kevin Durant (2012 ring in this version).  18: Bron beats the KD Warriors again this time without Kyrie (for the second time), with that bad 2018 squad, which would complete that insane 2018 run he had.  All those along with having won in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018? He’d have an even stronger case for being the GOAT."
Yeah could you imagine the champions adding Kevin Durant after defeating LeBron and then losing to LeBron twice in a row despite LeBron's sidekick leaving him.   That would be an insane GOAT case.
"It’s supposed to be Lebron’s squad versus his rivals.   Kevin Durant could replace Jimmy and make the team better, or replace MJ since they were never on court rivals, but the Jimmy versus Lebron thing was more fun than KD, so I threw Jimmy in there."

"He gets doubled constantly and doesn't have the luxury of having a Klay Thompson or a Kevin Durant to take pressure off him.  Being serious tho, he's still pretty good in the playoffs. Career 25/4/6 on 55 TS%"
Kawhi was pretty close to being Steph's equal offensively (he also didn't have Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson around him to take the pressure off) and was lightyears ahead of him defensively.
Yeah but it’s also Kevin fucking Durant. One of the best scorers of all time. He’s earned it until proven he doesn’t have it.
Kevin Durant
"The same is true for established players. The league has periods of a few teams/players being the best and that shouldn't mean the other 90% of players in the league aren't successful. The metric of a person is familial, personal, and emotional. A championship is only a portion of a player's material wealth and a contribution to their emotional wealth.   Let's not forget that Meyers Leonard is loaded by any normal person's standard, Jordan seemed really lonely in the Last Dance, Durant lost respect for his rings, Portland loves Dame, Kevin Love fought depression, and some players have great family life. Whichever player might be the best example of family we by design don't know because they've done well keeping their family out of the awful public eye.  If you consider the big picture, rings barely mean shit.  And yes, shut up, Shaq."
"I don't believe in the whole asterisk as in ""this championship counts less"" because that's bullshit, but I do believe in it in just the sense of ""let's remember this team caught a lucky break"" specifically with injuries to stars. It doesn't mean the championship counts less, it just means for the purposes of discussion it's important to remember that factor. An asterisk purely in the ""see endnotes for relevant details"" sense rather than a ""this is different from an actual championship"" sense.  * It's relevant that the Warriors faced a Cavs team with both Kyrie and Kevin Love sitting out. * It's relevant that the Raptors faced a Warriors team with Durant sitting out and Klay suffering multiple injuries * It's relevant that the Pistons faced the Lakers with Byron Scott sitting out and Magic getting hurt * It's relevant that the Lakers faced the Heat with Butler, Dragic and Adebayo all getting hurt.  The championships still count as much as any, but it would be weird to totally ignore something as important as multiple key players being hurt. But as for an asterisk for a shorter season or something I really don't get that, injuries provide an obvious undeniable advantage, a shorter season could have any outcome."
"Probably because the last few seasons have seen some pretty devastating injuries to top tier teams:   \- 2015: Kyrie Irving gets injured in Game 1 of the Finals, misses the rest of the series  \- 2017: Kawhi Leonard gets injured in Game 1 of the WCF, misses the rest of the series   \- 2018: Chris Paul gets injured in Game 5 of the WCF, misses the rest of the series   \- 2019: Kevin Durant misses a good chunk of the Finals and tears his Achilles tendon when he returns, Klay Thompson tears his ACL in Game 5 and misses the series   \-2020: Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic missed half the Finals"
Tell that to Kevin Durant in his prime. We’d be talking about a 38 year old lebron
Scottie and Tony Allen for me at the top.  Scottie locked down Magic Johnson and other HOF players in the bulls era.  Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant said that Tony Allen is the best defender against them.
there is only two asterix championships  both are held by kevin durant
The warriors were missing Kevin durant  And then klay  Your only chip is an asterisk by your own standards  Sad!
Bonus points if you can give an answer that doesn't mention Kevin Durant.
"Oh please, he gets trapped on screens. Teams utilize this for many different players, he just sees it most consistently and Kerr purposely spams it to create action. That doesn’t automatically lead to Kevin Durant having all time efficient Finals series.   Saying KD only won FMVP because of Klay and Curry is a HORRIBLE point especially considering only 27% of his shots were open. Nearing 50% of his shots were just catch and shoot over defenders.   Even suggesting Klay Thompson getting doubled is a reason for KD winning FMVP is absolutely ridiculous, he’s not a ball handler and no player typically gets doubled OFF the ball in the history of the NBA. Horrible analysis.  This sub loves misinformation."
This one has as much of an asterisk as Golden State stacking the deck with Kevin Durant  which is none
"I gave him his props. But he doesn't have an elite offensive repertoire. Okay, he can hit a shot that any good mid-range shooter can hit, many of them better than him. And I don't see any really crafty moves or footwork from him. He goes straight up, everything looks mundane, even that turnaround J.  I listed 5 guys that I think are better players, and I didn't even name Kevin Durant - in part because I don't know what KD is gonna be after the Achilles tear as I don't think we've ever seen someone truly come back from it. But KD at 100%, he's better than Kawhi too. Kawhi got escorted to the top of the list because he won Finals MVP with 2 teams and he could join a list consisting of Kareem and LeBron - completely irrespective of the fact that players jump teams every other contract these days and that just doesn't mean all that much. No one was talking about Kawhi as being the best player in the league before the '19 Finals. He wasn't in that discussion. Then he beats a depleted Warriors unit, and the basketball media spends a year sucking him off. All due respect to his accomplishments and talent, he's not even a Top 5 player. Never has been and, thanks in no small part to how he only plays about 2/3 of the games other stars are expected to play, never will be."
"From 17-20, I think it was certainly debatable that Kevin Durant was the best player in the league. It's just a difficult argument to make because KD was on an absolutely stacked team. I also don't know that you can conclusively say KD outplayed Bron in 2018. It was definitely close, WAY closer than Curry and Dame in 2019.   Even if he wasn't, that's not really relevant to this discussion. There's a million other ways to argue Lebron over KD. Dame has like no argument over Steph."
"Thank you!  Shit is amazing.  Teams are bigger than ever.  Beyond the fives, you got 6'10 and above on the wings everywhere you look:  Michael Porter, Bol Bol, Kristaps Porzingis, Kevin Durant, Giannis, Jonathan Isaac, etc...  Smallball means getting the longest players with guard-like skills (run, shoot, dribble, pass).   If Zeke Nnaji falls into the second round, folks are still missing the point.   I expect Isaiah Stewart, Jaden McDaniels, Paul Reed and Daniel Oturu to get selected significantly higher than where they are typically mocked.  &amp;#x200B;  ....  &amp;#x200B;  I'm just glad we've gotten to the point where internet draftniks have stopped thinking that smallball means every 6'7-6'8 player is a stretch four.  Lol."
"LeBron James. Thoughts? • “He’s great. He’s phenomenal. To be able to perform at that high of that level is phenomenal. Not calling him the GOAT but in the conversation. That’s a two-man race.”  • “When I am not talking shit about him, I talk about what he does for people and his people.”  • “Transcendent talent, but an overchoreographed public image and off-the-court persona. Too obviously rehearsed and planned. Not genuine. An obsession with creating a legacy instead of letting the legacy create itself.”  • “At his age and he’s still the best player in the NBA. Like or dislike him, he’s an unstoppable force on and off the court. I don’t know what kind of person he is off the court but the stuff we know he does is great.”  • “The greatest philanthropic athlete since Muhammad Ali. The second greatest player ever. To be the man you’ve got to beat the man.”  • “Terrific player but an insatiable ego. Has done some good things societally. I think that’s important. He’s put his money where his mouth is, which I like, but his mouth is everywhere. That’s the problem. … People that criticize him, it’s just incredible. I’d love to know what they’ve accomplished in their lives.”  • “I think he is the second greatest player of all time. I think he is somebody who is able to transform basketball similar to the way Michael Jordan did. I think Michael took it to a certain level. I think LeBron took it to a new level with this generation. Looking back and seeing how much pressure he had on him coming out and for his career to turn out the way it did is really impressive.”  • “I think he’s the best player of all time, but these playoffs really changed my view and took it to another level for me. If you thought he had lost a step, you realize he can pace himself and then put his foot on the gas when he wants to. It was amazing. There were times in the bubble when he’s slowing down and then you see, no, he was being strategic and not showing his hand. It was remarkable to watch. He’s just so in control on the floor and it’s magnificent to see. He’s the defining player of our era. I’m really lucky I got to see him.”  • “I think he’s an all-time phenomenon. An amazing career. I think he’s a notch below Michael Jordan still but I think it’s amazing how he’s evolved. It’s amazing what he’s done and continues to do. The bad thing, the only bad thing, everyone is afraid to say this and I’m not afraid to say it individually, but I’m just saying this because it’s true. And everybody knows this, who is in this business.  “The worst thing that LeBron is doing is forcing this power with Rich Paul and what that is, in terms of, he’s a player, but he has prowess in the media space. His company Spring Hill, that’s awesome. Doing the movies and all of the projects. That’s so commendable. I love that. But now that they’ve jumped into the agent game, which the reality is, it’s illegal for a player, particularly if you’re in the state of California, to be licensed to represent talent.  “Now I know it’s this façade that it’s Rich Paul, but it’s really LeBron who recruits for Rich Paul. So it’s almost like they’re trying to control AAU at the NBA level. This is my AAU team and they’ve carried that to the highest level. And because of his power and his prowess, people, the young players are seduced by LeBron James in the same way people were seduced by Michael Jordan with David Falk. He went from having Michael Jordan and a few other players, to getting the top players in the NBA, because of the Jordan factor. Rob Pelinka had tremendous success as an independent agent because he had Kobe Bryant and the players idolized him. So, the fact that LeBron recruits and has empowered Rich Paul, and I get it, on the top guys, but if someone does their research, a lot of these guys have really gotten screwed, a large number of them, by mismanagement.  “There’s at least five or six massive casualties. Nobody is saying anything and you can even say that the union should take some responsibility because they represent all of the players, not just LeBron James. Because this is anonymous. I hope you have the courage to put this out there, because nobody is talking about this but this is the reality, and if you ask any other agent what I just said, they would all agree. ** **“They’ve been able to leverage KCP, two or three years in a row because they have the power and they’re forcing it down their throat. Nerlens Noel. There are four or five of them that have suffered millions of dollars from mismanagement but nobody has the courage to support it, because all the media wants access to LeBron. They want access to AD.  “What he’s done is he’s taking AAU basketball to the NBA, because he has the ability to do that because these young players idolize him. I’m starting to hear some rumblings that they might be overloaded. Because you can’t have this level of expectation for a client and service all of these guys. Ben Simmons. Garland. I know this as an agent, you can’t service them all at this level. You can seduce them, but you can’t service them all, at that level with what they say they’re doing. Nerlens Noel. Norris Cole. Shabazz Muhammed. They lost $80 million in Detroit. This is real talk.  *“That’s the only disappointment is LeBron has leveraged his popularity with young players for seducing them for Klutch and it’s not serving all the players well. But for the players that are suffering, there’s no repercussions. Nobody is criticizing what they’re doing. And you have to call out the union. They should be meeting with Rich Paul, saying, ‘What happened here? What happened here? They represent all the players. They all pay the same amount for dues. If Rich Paul were a lawyer, he’d be disbarred five times. But because LeBron is so powerful, there is no accountability. And that’s the only bad part with LeBron. Everything else is great. It’s commendable. It’s progressive. I love it. The part that he’s pushed Rich Paul in this position and these naïve basketball players, that’s pretty egregiously irresponsible.” *  • “I can’t put it in one word. I think he’ll be the greatest of all time, just based on longevity and the list of accomplishments. With my era and my age, I still say MJ is the greatest, but I think it’s going to be hard to argue LeBron’s place because of all the things he accomplished and the longevity of his career. The combination of the two. And I have to say what he does politically and with social responsibility stuff, I’m really impressed with him. I’m impressed with how he’s set up Rich Paul and Maverick Carter. I think few black athletes and celebrities do that. I’m impressed with the stands that he takes and the courage. He’s never shied away from that. I feel like when you put everything together, he’s going to go down as the best.”  Source: NBA agent survey Part II: LeBron James views; Kevin Durant; Best player is…? https://theathletic.com/2143454/2020/10/22/nba-agent-survey-part-two-lebron-james-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-best-player/?source=user_shared_article"
crying part was hyperbole.  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/6/12/15781060/draymond-green-kevin-durant-phone-call-gmib  someone is lying. my money is on kd
Where did the crying thing come from? Wanting to talk about revisionist history after that comment is pretty ironic. [Even Kd says the story we got was wrong.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2715090-kevin-durant-says-draymond-green-did-not-call-him-after-2016-finals-loss.amp.html)
"it would avoid a Kevin Durant to Golden State situation I guess (depends on how much cap room good teams give up to bad ones) but also discourages building a good team the right way, and means you'll get more stuff like the OKC Harden trade that destroys a great team before they actually get great. I don't think it's a good idea."
"I used to watch basketball as a kid. Back then, it was Michael Jordan. I got back to watching the sport in 2011. Kevin Durant and LBJ were the guys I'd try to watch, and then Curry.   Curry is probably the most flamboyant and exciting player I've ever seen. When he's on, holy shit. If he's not on, you can still sense that feeling of dread that he might hit a big three and go nuclear at any time."
"Kevin Durant gave his organization 9 years to find a supporting staff and win a ring. He did all he could. He has ever single right to leave in free agency. Is it ridiculous to join then best regular season team of all time after just losing to them in a close 7 game WCF? Yes. But look, that's just part of a player's right.   Kawhi literally quit mid-season on his team, refused to talk to any of his teammates, coaching staff, or executives, and then accused the team of excaserbating his injury, only to demand a trade.   What KD did was ridiculous, but completely within his rights. I think what Kawhi did goes well beyond what a player should be allowed to do."
I'm pretty sure Kevin Durant would know more about basketball than any of us lol
"And Kevin Durant only once, this further proves why LeBron is the GOAT"
"Yeah, they definitely made him feel isolated from the rest of franchise, they dropped the ball in that regard. KD said something like it always felt like “There was Kevin Durant, and the GSW. But there was never Golden State Warrior, Kevin Durant”   I wish I could remember the exact quote."
Kevin Durant isn't on the list but he's a snake soooo
"Warriors: Help us, Kevin Durant. You’re our only hope.  Also Warriors: Can you believe this dude actually signed with us lmao. He gets so mad when we make fun of him for doing as we asked."
"At 31 years old MJ was sitting on 3 championships, that summer the Bulls traded Will Perdue for Dennis Rodman and went on to threepeat.  At 31 years old LeBron was sitting on 3 championships, that summer the 73-9 Golden State Warriors signed Kevin Durant.  It's truly remarkable how much of NBA history was changed with that move by KD."
"Who joins Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to play 800 games while averaging atleast 13.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals on 49% field goal percentage and 30% three point percentage?  A - Tim Duncan  B - Kobe Bryant  C - Thaddeus Young  D - Kevin Durant"
"The MVP candidates are probably:  Giannis Antekoumpo, Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons (if he learns to shoot threes), Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, and Stephen Curry.   These realistically are the set of players that have the talent to have an MVP Caliber season (or at least Top 5 in voting) and who are on teams that have a chance to finish at the top of their conference.  Luka's success will largely come down to the Maverick's team success. If they're a low seed, he won't have a chance, but if they're the 1-seed somehow he could get it.  It's too hard to predict, but it usually comes from a guy on the best team, and in both the East/West it's impossible to tell where the top teams will stack up.   Giannis being a 2-time in a row winner definitely helps, but if the Bucks smash everyone in the regular season again and he's far away statistically from everyone else he will probably just win it again."
"I'll go different.   I'll say MVP: Embiid   I think we finally see healthy Embiid. And I just remember in that all-star game 4th quarter, both teams were trying, and he was just going to town on the low block.   fMVP: Kevin Durant   I hope we see the KD of old. If that's the case, he obviously had the talent to win the FMVP.    DPOY: AD or Ben Simmons   Honestly, should be AD hands down but with the season being so close to the end of the Lakers bubble run, I can see the Lakers resting AD."
"I started watching ball in the 2012-13 season and while the 12-13 Raptors weren't the best, the 4 Raptors on my list is what made me love basketball overtime. I remember I also fell in love with Steph Curry when I watched the Warriors vs Nuggets series in 2013 playoffs, what a great series that was.    1. DeRozan  2. Lowry  3. LeBron James  4. Steph Curry  5. Jonas Valanciunas  6. Kevin Durant  7. Dirk Nowitzki  8. Klay Thompson  9. Duncan  10. Amir Johnson"
Tobias Harris and J Cole   OG Anunoby and Lil Wayne   Kyle Korver and Ashton Kutcher  Fred VanVleet and Drake  Kevin Durant and Offset
"Voter fatigue will strike again. I'm going go out on a limb and choose Kevin Durant as my MVP candidate closely followed by Luka Doncic and Steph Curry.   DPOY will be AD's for the taking.  FMPV: I don't know why, but I expect a very strong response from Kawhi. Though they say never bet against your favorite team/player, I have a feeling that the Klaw will win it. KD a close second."
Classic Houston basketball??? Idk if you still got thabo selfishlotion and Jeff green but more like classic okc basketball. I'll never understand how people think this hand me down thunder team that couldn't win would recollaborate in Houston and do any better without the best player. You guys are one Kevin durant shy from being able to come just short.
Kevin durant is the T-Mac of his day.
He’s so bias toward one style of basketball lol. He always talks about “hoopers” and “purist” and once those one dimensional players gets exposed he stays quiet. He post something about Kevin Durant every fucking week lol
"Based on how they looked when they were last fully healthy  1. Kevin Durant - was absolutely unstoppable until he got injured and was straight dad dicking the league   2. Steph Curry - was absolutely carrying the injured Warriors in the finals and was the best player in the series   3. LeBron James - great playoff run from LeBron but not quite as great as what we saw in 2018 or 2016.   4. Luka Doncic - a walking 30 point triple double and his 40 point triple double with the buzzer beater will be looked at in 20 years as his 'Jordan 63 points vs the Celtics' moment   5. James Harden - was having one of his best playoff runs however the rest of his team didnt show up.   6. Nikola Jokic - cemented himself as the best big man in the game to me. Lead his team to 2 3-1 lead comebacks and to the WCF as the number 1 option. Something that AD was never able to do and something Giannis was unable to do this playoffs.   7. Kawhi Leonard - great playoff run from Kawhi until that game 7.   8. Jimmy Butler - all time great finals performance in a loss from Jimmy G Buckets. Absolutely carried the Heat when Bam and Dragic were down and scored more clutch buckets than anyone since Kawhi and Dirk in 2019 and 2011.   9. Anthony Davis - had a great playoff run but benefitted from playing behind LeBron and we saw that Jimmy was clearly the 2nd best player in the finals.   10. Giannis Antetokounmpo - this may seem low but based on when we last saw him, he had the worst performance of anyone on this list.  11. Damian Lillard  12. Joel Embiid  13. Jayson Tatum  14. Chris Paul  15. Klay Thompson"
LeBron James &gt; Kawhi Leonard &gt; Steph Curry &gt; Kevin Durant &gt;  James Harden &gt; the rest
"I agree that he wasn’t carrying in 2016, but he made All-NBA first team over Kevin Durant that year, and he finished 2nd in MVP voting as well."
"Haha thanks sometimes it’s random what blows up.  Both Nash and Ray would THRIVE in today’s league haha. Ray was my favorite Sonic player, I was a little too young to fully appreciate Kemp/Payton. And then 2008 came and then Kevin Durant was my favorite"
"Guys with no minutes deserve rings. They all help with the team chemistry, practice and all the behind the scenes shit.   Although a finals MVP like Kevin Durant doesn't deserve his rings though, right?"
Kevin Durant gonna have to beat out Marial Shayok to be the Nets starting SF next season
"I think that it has a lot more to do with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving recruiting him befote MDA even went there.  But my main focus is you saying it's so he can do ""whatever he wants."" That's a dumbass thing to say."
summer league Kevin Knox: Kevin Durant
1. James Harden - 31ppg  2. Kevin Durant - 29ppg  3. Stephen Curry - 29ppg  4. Trae Young 28ppg  5. Luka Doncic - 28ppg
So outrageous that Bucks fans would be excited about leading in the most important playoff series for the franchise in 20 years.   Should I be an asshole too and say “reminds me of when Raptors fans all celebrated when Kevin Durant ruptured his achilles”?   Sort of unfair and irrelevant right?  I wish Raptors fans would simply enjoy the good memories of their championship season instead of constantly seeking ways to shit on the Bucks for some absurd reason.
Dwight also had twice as many 1st and 2nd place votes combined as Lebron did.      |Player|Points|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th| :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:| |Derrick Rose (Chi) ......|1182|113|6|2|0|0| |Dwight Howard (Orl) .....|643|3|57|31|16|11| |LeBron James (Mia) ......|522|4|26|39|31|12| |Kobe Bryant (LAL) .......|428|1|18|32|40|12| |Kevin Durant (OKC) ......|190|0|6|10|20|38| |Dirk Nowitzki (Dal) .....|113|0|5|3|11|30| |Dwyane Wade (Mia) .......|24|0|1|1|2|6| |Manu Ginobili (SA) ......|20|0|2|0|0|6| |Amare Stoudemire (NY) ...|9|0|0|1|0|4| |Blake Griffin (LAC) .....|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Rajon Rondo (Bos) .......|5|0|0|1|0|0| |Tony Parker (SA) ........|3|0|0|0|1|0| |Chris Paul (NO) .........|2|0|0|0|0|2|
Steph Curry-He is gonna to have an amazing rebound year one of these years.  Kevin Durant-When he gets healthy the nets are taking the east.  Anthony Davis-He is just getting started.
He's been good for his career 43% for 10-16 ft and 37% from 16 to the 3 point line but I think he shot like 55% from midrange in this last playoffs which goes from good to like Kevin Durant tier lol
"Kerr continued: “That’s why guys like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant are who they are. They can transcend any defense. But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over. No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact…"

"Wtf is the PPP on a possession where Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant are all open for a 3. Like 2.8? lmao"
"Lmao again, you are trying to make stuff up.   &gt;	“Kevin Durant literally overturned a charge call in a pivotal moment in the freaking finals lmao” is exactly what you said.  You’re right, this is exactly what I said. In your previous comment, You tried to say I said “KD complained to the refs” and got the call overturned. I asked for when I said that, and you got scared and changed up your argument. But now that I called you out for that comment, you have completely backtracked.   At least you acknowledged that you made that shit up lmao   You did all that to make your self look foolish lol this could’ve been avoided if you had just watched the video. Better luck next time kid."
"Lmao you made a complete fool of yourself. Not only did you start by lying you continued lying. Somehow someway you’re still trying to debate fact in the video.  The best part of this comment was you straight up lying about “exactly” what you said.  “Kevin Durant literally overturned a charge call in a pivotal moment in the freaking finals lmao” is exactly what you said.  Long story short, Kevin Durant did not literally overturn a charge call in pivotal moment in the freaking finals. The refs literally overturned a charge call in a pivotal moment in the freaking finals. You were wrong, it’s that simple. Sit down and take a breather, buddy.  You can not stop getting your panties twisted, I genuinely don’t see how you’re going to try to lie about your og comment, but I’m sure you’ll find a way.  Either way this will be my last response to you because nowhere in your incoherent ramblings, made up fiction, and blatant lies have you contributed anything of substance. You’ve wasted my time and made a fool out of yourself."
"Again. I'm not the one arguing that the Warriors won the 2019 title when the Raptors did.   Even stats-wise, the facts don't lie. In addition to the lower win-total, ignoring the years they plummeted,  before Durant: 114.9 PPG, 104.1 opponents PPG differential.  Year 1 of Durant: 115.9 PPG, 104.3 opponents PPG.  So, whoopsie. I was wrong. The Golden State Warriors improved by *ONE WHOLE POINT PER GAME* with Kevin Durant. Even if they lost .2 PPG in differential, so they really added **less than a point** to their record with Durant than without him. WOW, KD REALLY improved them! That 0.8 points per game he added to the team was EXACTLY the missing piece of the puzzle that proves he was necessary!    I'd respect you more if you'd just be a man for once and admit you believe the Raptors won the title because it fits your narrative, considering there's tribesmen in the farthest reaches of the world who never heard Kevin Durant's name, never knew of the NBA, and even THEY know that's what you think."
People still try to say Kawhi's run was better but he just had worse competition/ no Kevin Durant.
"&gt; see, this is why I keep arguing with you folks. You found two clips, one of tony getting trapped and easily finding a wide open duncan that messed up the catch, and another of al horford getting stripped  Yes trapping and stripping are very good defensive plays. Tony was clearly hounded by LeBron, he found Tim open because that was the plan, to blitz Parker, which is why help came so quickly to stop Duncan. Do you think these clips are rare or something?  &gt; 2 plays that were mildly successful does not prove lebron is a dominant defender  That's why there's so much film on this post dumbass. It's so blatantly obvious you didn't even watch anything. There's video there of him guarding Dwight, Jokic and AD. I've given clear evidence of him shutting down Derrick Rose as well. Lebron can guard 1-5, period. Stop lying to yourself.  &gt; calling him better than artest and marion is insane. He never had anywhere close to the defensive responsibility that they had. He never took the primary defensive assignment, he never shuts down anybody.   That's why I said arguably, and the post, as well as I, have given multiple examples of LeBron guarding the best players from the other team.   &gt; never lead to great defensive teams without great defensive teammates carrying that load that he does not)  2009, 2011, 2012 are all years where LeBron was the main defender on a top 5 defense in the league.  &gt; so again, why does lebron get extra credit for those 5-6 possessions a game that he goes all out, but guys like artest and marion get ignored even though they take the toughest assignments every night, while also making those great adjustments 5-6 times a game on top of being the most important part of their team's defense?  Because he doesn't just try for 5-6 possessions. These clips aren't the only few examples of LeBron trying on Defense. He's so clearly a presence on defense throughout the game on defense. Just this year alone, LeBron was 3rd in DRAPM, 3rd in DRPM, 17th in DBPM. Whatever way you look at it he's obviously one of the best defenders in the league. I've cited advanced stats and you have enough film from what I gave and what's in the post. You're being ridiculous at this point  &gt; why hasn't he won a championship thanks to him shutting down someone on the other team?  2016, but again, stop looking at defense purely in a 1v1, that's just being a casual.  &gt; why has he lost finals with guys in his position range go off?  Are you talking about Kevin Durant? Because the answer is that he's Kevin Durant. No one is guarding him.  &gt; Why do his teammates always have more important defensive roles than him??  Other than AD and Bosh for a bit, Lebron's been the main defender his whole career."
"&gt; Durant feaasted on lebron in all of their finals matchups, lebron actively looked to switch off of him all the time.  Yes because as I said, Kevin Durant is an unrealistic expectation for any defender, let alone one who's already burdened with the majority of the offensive load.  &gt; He guarded rose for like 8 possessions and they blitzed and doubled him, the one tiny example of him guarding a point, and he didn't eat his lunch lol.  From ESPN's Stats and Info Department, ""After going 0-for-5 from the floor with a turnover when guarded by LeBron James in Game 4, Derrick Rose struggled against him once again Thursday, going 1-for-10 with two turnovers in Game 5. Rose shot 6.3% from the floor in the series when defended by James, lowest among any player that defended him on five or more plays."" So no it wasn't just 8 possessions and I'd consider 6.3% lunch.  &gt; Jokic feasted, what is this? Dwight was hacking and bumping him non-stop, but you are going to give him credit for like 5 switches?  Giving Lebron credit doesn't mean Dwight doesn't get any. I'm just proving that when necessary Lebron can guard 5s.   &gt; Pau worked him on switches, Kg did, Duncan would have if lebron ever tried to guard him lol, david west worked him, jokic did, shawn marion scored on him, he didn't guard dirk   Based on what are you saying this? You can't just name random bigs lol. I don't understand why people are so insistent on denying his ability to guard 1-5. Do I need to show evidence or something? Here's lebron guarding an allstar [wing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkh4Nnz9Ie8) [guard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2r45koedTE) and [big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L_X2_sIHOI)  &gt; gerald wallace was the main offensive weapon for charlotte, ak-47 had a sizable role in every offense he was in, marion was a 20 ppg scorer, artest was too before the suspension?? yet all still took primary assignments and provided the helpside defense that only lebron can lol.  none of these guys had a fraction of the role lebron did on offense lets not kid ourselves. Apart from maybe Marion and Artest, they weren't better defenders than Lebron anyway. Lebron doesn't get extra credit for not trying, its a massive criticism of his. We just acknowledge that when he tries, like in his Miami days and right now on the Lakers, he's one of the best defenders in the league. Stop exaggerating and saying 'he's never showed that'. Nobody gave him DPOY votes for fun"
"Yes, Kevin Durant has a higher ceiling than Devin Booker."
"Cause there are more outfield players and thus more star players in that field that get paid big moneys.  6'3 isn't Kevin Durant size, we already know what too much height does lol you won't be getting much ballow down low and you won't get fast enough to get a 2nd ball if you don't directly catch it."
Tell me more about your shitty youth level.  And when did i say goalies aren't big' just not Kevin Durant level of tall.
Kevin Durant and it’s not close
Kevin Durant helicopter flop is my favorite - I’ll find it.  Edit: https://youtu.be/cse2pb7T2T8
"This logic works in a pick up game at the park, not in the NBA lol. Especially when we are talking about Kevin fucking Durant."
"##The fact the most of us have LeBron vs. Kevin Durant in the finals again, for the third time, on different teams, shows how long and great they were"
Kevin Durant literally overturned a charge call in a pivotal moment in the freaking finals lmao
they were a .500 team without their two best players.. and their two best players are KEVIN DURANT and Kyrie Irving   i don't see how they're not right there with those teams
"I dont understand why people include maimi in places that big names go. Since the Heatles broke up what big name free agents have they attracted besides jimmy butler? I havent seen kevin Durant, kyrie, kawhi, al horford, Kemba walker, paul Millsap,  paul george, DeAndre jordan and a litany of other players that stayed with their original teams. I understand it's a cool place to live but everyone acts like getting paid to play in big markets like NYC(excluding the Knicks and their ownership issues), Philly, or Boston is unacceptable."
"*After the bucket* ""I'm Kevin Durant. Y'all know who I am."""
"Because you only choose to rate Beverley on his supposedly elite defense on guards. He has still frequently takes on defensive assignments of much bigger players due to his ego or perhaps the complete lack of defensive planning of Rivers.   His defense is dirty, and when it isn’t working he often tries to injure players. LeBron went into the Christmas game with a listed groin injury and he takes a knee to the groin from Beverley playing “defense” when it’s widely known the best player has a groin injury. Dude is hobbling the rest of the game.  Westbrook in 2014 was it? Straight took out the dude’s knees, forever changed his career. Then last year he has the audacity to claim he can guard Kevin Durant (and actually attempts to do so during the series) and then KD drops like 35/40/50 games. People always point to that 6 game series against the Warriors as if it was even slightly competitive. Playing with food."
"Alright, five random players who weren't all-stars this year: Steph Curry/Klay Thompson/Kevin Durant/Draymond Green/DeMarcus Cousins."
"I feel like people are not understanding the question being asked? It's not who's the better player right now but who will be the better player this upcoming season, with things like injuries and age taken into account.   Like Kevin Durant is obviously a great player but he's coming back from a major injury, hasn't played in like a year and will be playing with a brand new team. So it makes sense to say that he might not have the greatest year next season. I don't think it's crazy to say that someone like Devin Booker would be the better player next season given all this context."
"&gt; yet you don't see these kind of big guys dominating the sports like you think NBA/NFL players would.   Aren’t most the top goalkeepers 6’3 and above? If size wasn’t so important at the goalkeeper position wouldn’t we see more variance in size like with Messi and Ronaldo?   I’m ignorant about soccer but economics is economics, in any industry you find the position in companies that require the least amount of skill end up getting paid less than their counterparts, is a goalkeeper not that position for soccer?   And what about the “best US athletes gravitate towards Basketball and Football”...is kindergarten logic? Kevin Durant grew up in a household that literally couldn’t afford to play soccer at a level that would get him the exposure he needed to play in college, same for LeBron, but they could both had the option of competing in a level of prep football(HS) that would give them exposure to play at the next level(LeBron actually did his freshman/soph year)."
"The thing is, as good as bam is, you don't win championships by having such a player with a max contract. Looking from recent years, LeBron James, steph curry,  Kevin Durant, kawhi Leonard, these are the caliber of players that championship winning teams had on a max contract"
Kevin Durant does photography too
Future NBA hall of famer Kevin Durant can’t do any of those things. He must not be athletic?  But he’s almost 7ft tall and quicker than some guards. Can shoot from 30 feet and is used to running up and down a court for 48min while guarding other NBA stars. How is he not athletic?  Edit: I can do all the things you mentioned except the mile time. And I guarantee Kevin Durant is more athletic than I am.
"I think it's a combination of a lot of thing. Yes Steph is light skin. But he also sinking threes from super deep range like a mofo that noone has ever done before. KD is great at what he does but what he does is still what we have seen on basketball court. Shooting guard who got range and handles. Similar style to Kobe ish. Great player yes, but we've seen his playstyle before. Now Steph is a different style of play that the league hasn't seen before. The way he scores is like some people said, revolutionary to the league. Most teams switched up their way of drafting because they realize that it's possible to get specialist in shooting to carry the team. So to answer your question, is it possible that him being light skin has anything to do with it? Possible yes. But is it the only factor? I don't think so. There are a lot of contributing factors for why he's the face. Cuz keep in mind Durant was the face of the thunder. Then he went to the Warriors when they've already established that Steph and Klay were the splash bros and the face of the warriors. So I think it's more of a seniority thing as well as the fact that Kevin kinda chose an easy way out to win a ring. So if anything he was well loved before he went to the warrior. I like Kevin Durant but seeing how he joined the warrior, I understand why he's not well liked as he was before he went there. I hope I answered your question."
i was talking about it with my homie and he brought up a good point. kevin durant would probably be the face of the warriors more so in 2018 if he looked like steph curry. everyone knows who steph curry is but not a lot of non basketball fans can name kevin durant as easy as steph despite him being the obvious better player. is it just coincidence? i’m sure there are more examples of this in the league. or maybe we’re completely wrong. just want to hear some opinions on it.
"i saw him at KD’s all star game when i was a kid and all i remember is the dude is huge.  like yeah he looks pretty defined on TV and larger than most players, but once you see him live you realize he legit blocks your sight of view because of how wide his back is.  i can’t find the information about the game but it was really weird. it might’ve been during the lockout but KD put together an “all star” game in OKC and it had players like lebron and lamarcus aldridge.  also michael beasley went off for lime 60  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/10/24/2510035/kevin-durant-chris-paul-oklahoma-city-charity-game"

Kevin Durant avgd 0 mpg last season
I honestly would like to see someone like Kevin Durant after 6 months of goalkeeper training.   Looking at the net worth of the best goalkeepers in the worlds most popular sport gives me doubt that the best athletes are indeed playing that position. Gigi Buffon has been playing for 20 years and has a net worth of 20 million?
But bro kevin Durant wud be the greatest goalie ever cuz he got long armzzz
"Going back and looking at the 80s MVP voting onwards.   Getting 90%+  - Moses Malone, 83.   - Larry Bird, 85.   - Larry Bird, 86  - Michael Jordan, 96  - Shaq, 00. Missed by 1 vote.  - Kevin Garnett, 04  - Lebron James, 09  - Lebron James, 10  - Derrick Rose, 11  - Lebron James, 13. Missed by 1 vote.  - Kevin Durant, 14  - Steph Curry, 16  Steph absolutely deserved unanimous, but so did arguably these players too. It being unanimous requires luck as well, unfortunately.   edit: Chuck got fucking robbed in '90."
He's also Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant has been saved by elite guard play his entire career. I don’t think he impacts the game all that much unless he’s locked in playing elite defense
"Just to tackle the main point here:  Every dunker had a ""dunk coach"" in the 2011 contest. It was a dumb, gimmicky idea, but everyone had a representative and it wasn't limited to just McGee and Griffin.  * DeMar DeRozan's Coach: Darryl Dawkins  * Serge Ibaka's Coach: Kevin Durant  * JaVale McGee's Coach: Chris Webber  * Blake Griffin's Coach: Kenny Smith  Each player had placards announcing the theme of their first round dunks. [Dawkins announced DeRozan's first dunk as the Eastbay Funk Remix, for instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ersMozQn_LM&amp;ab_channel=MathhiasOstyn). I know, it was a dumb concept, but that's what they rolled with that year.   Second, regarding McGee's final dunk (first attempt), it was all over the place. [Low elevation, body splaying all about, kind of got hung on the rim before the ball lifelessly dropped through the hoop, and barely yielded a murmur from the crowd](https://youtu.be/4F9HseGTolg?t=457). It wasn't going to be a winner and he knew he didn't have much left in the tank to do it better.   McGee made a strategic mistake that year and that was burning all his best and most creative ideas in the first round (the triple dunk, the double-rim dunk). He was running on Larry Nance's fumes by the time he reached the finals.   The person who had the best case for being robbed was DeMar DeRozan. That said, Griffin benefitted from all the hype and he's not the first nor the last to do so. He was the most hyped contestant since Vince Carter so everything he did in that first round was seen through rose-tinted glasses - with everyone (including me) *wanting* him to succeed, just so we could see where this was going. It affected his score and it hurt DeRozan."
I'm talking about the entire 4th quarter in general.  It's not like he pulled a kawhi/PG from this year and went 1/11 to lay an egg. The man did his job for the most part.  Steph was just insane for 24 minutes and couldn't be stopped.   Using Steph's great 2nd half to discredit Harden (who had a great game and series by far one of his best) is some bullshit.  If Harden plays like Steph did in Game 3 and earlier in the series he gets crucified instantly. That's the benefit of ya know having prime Kevin Fucking Durant on your squad.
KYRIE IRVING WILL NEVER WIN A CHIP WITH KEVIN DURANT
"Kevin Durant made the right decision signing for the Warriors. He joined the best situation for him given the cap in Summer of 2016. He’s developed his game to levels he wouldn’t have before, just like LeBron did in going to Miami.  The fact he was joining a team that knocked him out is irrelevant."
"Harden is one of the greatest scorers of all time and MVP paired with Westbrook. Kevin Durant... you know who he is paired with Uncle drew. Leonard/PG13.... those combos are compared to bron and some would take them over bron right now.  My point was it’s easier to do get 2 high tier guys and build around. To you point though, what team put together 4 all stars?"
"&gt; KD is one on one every time because he played with the top 2 shooters in the game  This has been debunked so many times. Also, anyone that actually watched the finals in 17 or even 18 would see that the warriors entire gamelan was to iso Lebron and send help only on drives. Acting as if lebron was getting constant doubles or was getting different treatment than KD is just ignorant. And one more taste for haters like you, **from the people that literally worked for the Cavs**:  [Strauss] (""The Victory Machine""): ""When I talked to Cavs staffers about the 2017 Finals, they were upfront about how KD had outplayed LeBron. One went so far as to tell me, “Kevin Durant kicked LeBron’s ass. He completely dominated LeBron in the series. Every time KD needed to score, he did and it didn’t matter what the fuck LeBron did."""
"Kevin Durant will never be a top 10 player again. I think he's going to be a solid top15-30 player for many more years, of course still worth the contract, but no way he comes back to even close to his old self."
"Kevin Durant was a top 2 player only in the 2014 regular season. Never before, never again."
"Did you just say the warriors werent better with Kevin Durant?  Also cousins was coming off a devastating injury, no team in the league was going to give him even close to a max deal."
"If it’s a 1 on 2 with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant standing on the three point line, who are you going to try to defend?"
"Kevin Durant is done as a top tier player. He’s not going to be the same anymore, and it’s not going to be close. The Brooklyn Nets KD-Kyrie era is going to be a massive failure that only lasts 2 seasons. It’s two injury prone stars who were next to players who were already champions when they won their rings. I don’t think people who live outside of NY realize how irrelevant the Nets are here. If the Knicks maxed out two players who got hurt and missed a whole season, and hired a player who never coached before, they’d be killed on ESPN everyday."
I think injuries are going to get to Zion. I feel like Ja will be the Kevin Durant to Zion’s Greg Oden.
I don't even know if Kevin Durant will still be good after his injury. And Kyrie is injury prone every season.
"The only right answer:  *Kevin Durant*  The 2nd most skilled player of all time, top 5 shooter of all time, Mamba Mentality. I’d have it no other way."
I always picture cp3 guarding Kevin Durant. Durant didn’t try to back him down — he just faced up and shot over him. Reggie Miller commented “yeah.... that’s just the chair drill right there”
"The Slim Reaper himself, Kevin Durant."
"Bleacherreport lmfao   https://www.google.com/amp/s/oklahoman.com/article/3380690/thunder-selects-james-harden-with-the-third-overall-pick-in-the-nba-draft/amp  “The Thunder passed on Spanish point guard Ricky Rubio, who is widely considered the second best prospect behind former Oklahoma forward Blake Griffin. In doing so, Oklahoma City avoided a potential predicament in which the 18-year-old Spanish sensation likely would have moved Westbrook to shooting guard.  Rubio, who the Thunder showed increased interest in over the past week, was available to the Thunder when the Los Angeles Clippers used the first selection on Griffin and Memphis passed on the Rubio in favor of Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet.”  ESPN analysis: “Analysis: The Thunder will have an easy choice here if Rubio is still on the board. Russell Westbrook can play off the ball, and he and Rubio would give the Thunder one of the best young backcourts in the NBA. Neither guy is a great shooter, but they have Kevin Durant for that.  If the Grizzlies take Rubio, Oklahoma City will have a tough choice between Thabeet and James Harden.”"
"there are plenty of hypotheticals where a star winning less championships is better, and this is one of them. winning FMVP over prime Kevin Durant would have been an incredible accomplishment"
The quote would be “It’s just God disguised as Kevin Durant.”
"You of all people should know how shitty of an argument that is, Kevin Durant won just as little his first two seasons"
Update on Dec. 21... The Brooklyn Nets will be without stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for atleast a month
Here’s my list in order: LeBron Kevin Durant Kawhi  Anthony Davis Steph curry Giannis Harden Then everyone else.
Update on Dec. 12... The Brooklyn Nets will be without stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving for their preseason opener tomorrow
"As long as Budenhozler is the coach, and Giannis can't score in the half court, then not confident at all.  Honestly the Bucks never should have forced Giannis to become a 3-point shooter. That's the wrong skill for him to work on. He should have worked on his mid-range game and post game first. He also needs to get better as a passer as well.   IMO the East is a 3-team race between the Heat, Nets, and Celtics. The 3 players I trust most in the conference in playoff basketball are Kevin Durant, Jimmy Butler, and Jayson Tatum."
https://youtu.be/OEUl_tBgOPk  clearly Caruso has a longer reach than Kevin Durant.  This is the kind of evidence you’re using.  See how dumb it is?
"Huh? LeBron stayed with the cavs for 7 season and didn’t get a team, coach, or culture around him.   If LeBron was given a competent front office and the greatest coach of all time, he wouldn’t have to leave.   Jordan literally retired the second time because the bulls didn’t bring Phil jackson back.   &gt;	 ""I can't win with these cats""  Kevin Durant said this.... not LeBron. Lmao yikes."
"You’re so wrong in so many levels   Stats have said that Durant and Curry have similar defensive attention, watch the games and you will realize it’s not true. Hell I’m not gonna even ask you to watch full games there are so great breakdowns on YouTube about this  Kevin Durant is also not a clearly better playoff player. Durant had a better run with far less defensive attention in 2017 but Curry was better in the western conference playoffs in 2018 and better in 3 out of 4 of the finals games. He also got way more defensive attention those playoffs.    Durant has more size, Curry is more productive, better and beat Durant so bad that Durant didn’t even think he could beat him so he joined him.    End of story"
What's crazy is one of the only former Sonics in the NBA (Kevin Durant) is likely to end this streak for Brooklyn.
I would take prime Michael Jordan lol. If we want to avoid saying the obvious picks like MJ and LBJ then Steve Nash or Kevin Durant. I think Nash would be even better in todays game and Kevin Durant is well.. Kevin Durant.
"The Clippers were the better basketball situation. He was rumored to be going there, New York (Melo was there), or stay in Miami that was the discussion at the time. And if you want to get really technical he could have joined the Spurs by pulling a Durant for pure basketball reasons.  Cleveland's 'birds' weren't anything special though. Tristan Thompson was no Shaquille Oneal and Kyrie Irving was no Derrick Rose. There was no reason for anyone to think those guys were championship level pieces and plenty of reason to think they were not.   Lebron certainly didn't think much of Wiggins he was shipped out before he had played a game for them before the world realized he was a bust. The guy was hyped as the next Kobe/Lebron and Lebron wasn't interested in him. According to your line of thinking, Lebron would want to play with a guy like that to form a superteam. But he didn't. In an alternate universe that could have been Kyrie Irving being traded for Kevin Love, and Andrew Wiggins and TT would have been the lottery pick on the Cavs Lebron comes to play with. Lebron was going back there regardless.  Name a team Lebron could have joined that did not have a bunch of assets at the time that Lebron could have joined?"
"The fuck are you smoking bro. Kevin Durant won a scoring title in his third year, averaging 30-8-3, 62% TS.  Tatum average 23-7-3, 54% TS.  Tatum has a much better team than what KD had back then.  KD did play more minutes than what Tatum does now, but due to the overall higher pace nowadays with the 3 beeing what it is and new rules etc they average pretty much the same FGA (20 to 19). Idc how much better Tatum is defensively, KD was a much better player."
"&gt;No they could not. Love can't even sniff the playoffs alone even in the East. The only reason Irving has is because he's been on teams that are playoff teams without him (Boston and Brooklyn). Kyrie and Love couldn't even be .500 when Lebron sat they have a 20% win rate together without James.   &gt;   &gt;It's easy to write off Love and Irving compared to Paul because the former bleed points on defense whereas Paul does not.  Literally gave you their stats for those playoffs and you still cant get over it lol. They also add more offensively scoring wise than Cp3 does. Lol. That's also bullshit that Kyrie and Love coulndt get into the playoffs in the east. Total horseshit. Lebron has from 2014-2017 has missed 9% of the games played LOL. That's it. That is incredibly LOW sample size to judge off of the course of three seasons. And its a BS argument. Kyrie and Love absolutely could make the playoffs in the East.   No it's not. Like I said Cp3 cannot provide the volume scoring both of them COMBINED can provide.   &gt;No, you are full of shit. Any improvement they made doesn't compare to the Warriors adding Kevin Durant wtf.   &gt;   &gt;That's your opinion. I'm certain this Lakers team would be competitive with the Kd Warriors and I am of the opinion they would win. I am basing that off of how close Harden + Paul came and how good Lebron + Ad are that people keep asking if they're a superteam. What makes you think Harden + CP3 is better than Lebron + Ad? Unless you're admitting CP3 is even better than you're suggesting.  No you are just dick riding Lebron. They literally had a better playoff record. Love and Irving both played better and the Cavs  3 points shooting was literally one of the best the NBA has ever seen. And Im not comparing their improvement to the KD Warriors, Im saying they were similarly talented when compared to the 2017-2018 Rockets.   Yea, I never said it wasnt my opinion. Okay fine, you talked me into it, Lakers get beat in 6  :P.  But for what its worth Zach Lowe also seems to think the 2017 Warriors also cream that Lakers team in 5. That team outside of Lebron and AD isnt that good. KCP, Caruso and Rondo...that's it. And they are shitty shooters outside of KCP. Ariza, Capela, Gordon and Tucker(and Luc) are all better role players. You have literally no one on that team who can guard Harden and good fucking luck double teaming him with Cp3 on the team.And there is also no Guarantee that AD ever has a playoff performance like he did in the bubble ever again. He will likely never shoot that well again. 2017-2018 Rockets I think would also beat the Lakers."
"&gt; Irving and Love in the East? Are you kidding me? They absolutely could do that.  No they could not. Love can't even sniff the playoffs alone even in the East. The only reason Irving has is because he's been on teams that are playoff teams without him (Boston and Brooklyn). Kyrie and Love couldn't even be .500 when Lebron sat they have a 20% win rate together without James.   It's easy to write off Love and Irving compared to Paul because the former bleed points on defense whereas Paul does not.  &gt;They were absoltuely playing better even if they didnt get that many new roster additions.   No, you are full of shit. Any improvement they made doesn't compare to the Warriors adding Kevin Durant wtf.  That's your opinion. I'm certain this Lakers team would be competitive with the Kd Warriors and I am of the opinion they would win. I am basing that off of how close Harden + Paul came and how good Lebron + Ad are that people keep asking if they're a superteam. What makes you think Harden + CP3 is better than Lebron + Ad? Unless you're admitting CP3 is even better than you're suggesting."
"&gt;Chris Paul can carry a team to the playoffs by himself. Irving and Love can't they might be all-star caliber players but Chris Paul is an all-nba franchise type of player. Further, Kevin Love is a net negative against the best teams (especially the Warriors) and Kyrie often is too. In Game 3 2017 Lebron was a +7 in the loss to GSW while Kyrie was a -9 and Love was a -11.   &gt;   &gt;The 2017 Cavs were the pretty much the same as the 2016 Cavs who of note was added? Kyle Korver? That's no comparison to the Warriors adding Kd.  Irving and Love in the East? Are you kidding me? They absolutely could do that. Give me a break.  Like I sad, there is no significant gap between Irving AND  Love and Chris Paul. Using a one game plus minus is a very bad way of representing your argument.  Kyrie Irving, 27 PPG on 57 TS%. Kevin Love 19 PPG on 60 TS%. The very next year they won the championship they lost a total of 1 game against any non Warrior team in the playoffs. Their shooting was one of the best in NBA history. They were absoltuely playing better even if they didnt get that many new roster additions. Please stop trying to bullshit for Lebron. Irving and Love(TOGETHER) isnt not significant up grade or downgrade against 2017-2018 Cp3 by himself.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;This is all hypotheticals, but if Lebron James is better than James Harden, then it stands to reason he would do better against the Warriors with Chris Paul than James Harden did.   &gt;   &gt;Chris Paul is closer to Ad as an impact player than Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined. This is important because Lebron wanted to trade for Ad at the trade deadline in 2019 and go beat the Warriors and win the championship. That was his plan. So Lebron at least believes he could beat the KD Warriors with Ad. You could argue Ad is better than CP3 of course, but I would say CP3 is in Ad's class.  Well yea probably, but that's a hypothetical.  The FACT  is he couldnt even take more than ONE GAME off the Durant Warriors with Irving and Love(two other all star level players) and needed an all time shooting performance from 3 to even take one. He had similar help, he coulndt get it done.   Chris Paul shot a like a 52 TS% against the Warriors in the series we went to 7, I love the guy and I think he is def better than Love and Irving(combined) but the fact is the talent gap between a top 10  player and two top 20 players isnt so significant to where you can just write off the performance of each teams. Neither the Cleveland roster nor the 2017-2018 Rockets roster had such a significant gap in talent. The fact is, Harden has had way more success against the KD Warriors than Lebron, that is a fact. Lebron is a better player though, that is also a fact.    All this stuff about AD is added fluff that isnt needed. And no that Lakers team this year nor last year is beating the Warriors with KD, not happening at all. They lose in 5 last year and lose in 6 this year."
"It was James Harden as his teams only allstar going against Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green with basically a 5 man lineup missing its star point guard. It's a miracle they were leading at the half - if TS showed the whole story, it woulda been a blowout from the jump."
"Don't you know who he is , he is Kevin Durant bruh"
"What? Im giving you the facts here? Im just saying that Warriors were a great team but then THEY ADDED KEVIN DURANT. And Harden had to play them 2 games against them without his  second best player. Whats wrong with you. Lebron had to carry that series in 14 and was ass shooting wise, Harden also had to carry against that same team WITH KEVIN DURANT and was also bad shooting wise. Its not easy. And that supporting cast in 18 was without Kyrie was at least comparable to the Rockets without Cp3 that year. And Lebron GOT SWEPT. Lol so in 17 Lebron has two All stars in his team and gets his ass beat in 5 games while Harden has Cp3 and takes that team to 7.   Im not saying Harden is better than Lebron(Lebron is better), but Harden has done much better against the Durant Warriors than Lebron has. You are dick riding Lebron and hating Harden unnecessarily."
"He has a 47 TS% for the entire series. He shot like absolute ass. For game 7 Harden had a 49 TS%. Lebron took 2 games off a Warriors team WITHOT Kevin Durant. He then lost to that Warriors squad in 5 games with KD and Love. And then got SWEPT by that KD Warriors team. Give me a break with this garbage. Please look at reality. So yea, I very much doubt Lebron could have won under those circumstances."
"Oh yeah. I’m sure there are better outlets that can explain football, MMA and basketball better than people like Peyton Manning, Kobe Bryant, Dana White, and Kevin Durant do for ESPN plus....."
"Yeah that’s why you shouldn’t have joined a 73 win team you pathetic little bitch. The hatred I have for Kevin Durant used to be dangerous. It would keep me awake at night, it would get me out of bed in the morning. Then at a Nuggets game last year pregame I walked right past security and waited for my opportunity. He was talking to some fan while warming up so I just run right up to him and start unleashing. I had been practicing this soliloquy toying with different lines for literally years and now finally here was my chance. I screamed right in his face that he was the greatest scorer I had ever seen in my life, that got his attention. And then I proceeded to absolutely eviscerate him, calling him the biggest pussy in sports and telling him millions of Americans are wasting their time and money watching the nba because of what he did, got escorted out of Pepsi center pretty quick. I told him he was fucking pathetic and that the basketball gods would have their way with him. After this encounter my hatred for him dissipated a lot. The fucking smirk on his face just made me realize this dude is a little kid. He’s a super self conscious little six year old boy stuck in the body of the greatest scorer of all time. Just weeks later his Achilles blew out"
"It’s Kevin Durant tho.   If you have an opportunity to get Durant, and pair him with another all star, you do it. That’s a choice that 30/30 nba teams would make."
"Slightly off-topic but can anyone here remember how hyped or not Kevin Durant was in comparison while in high school? I certainly remember him being super hyped after his ridiculous one season with the Texas Longhorns.   But I don't follow high school players news really at all so can't remember if he was super hyped on anything close to a Lebron level in high school as well or ""just"" seen as a typical 5-star recruit with lots of potential."
"I don’t see why it’s that interesting. We saw LeBron leave his team to go to Miami where Wade was clearly the guy, at least at first. Kevin Durant went to Golden State where he knew that Oakland was Steph’s territory. It’s happened twice in the last ten years. It would way more unlikely for a superstar player to go to a team in Toronto than to team up with another superstar player."
"All of those sick moves are going to be a step slower if he's any bit diminished from the injury.  People acting like he's immune from any regression because he's tall and can shoot are kidding themselves.  He'll still be a good player even if it he is a step slower, but he most definitely won't be the Kevin Durant we all know.  Hopefully he's able to get it all the way back."
"Kevin Durant  is a better player than Bill Russell. Russell is greater, but in terms of being better Durant has the upper hand"
The 2001 Lakers were not better than a 73-9 team + Kevin Durant
"This is the first year he’s leading the team, so we don’t know what his production is going to be. Also, no one else on the team might be averaging above 16+ ppg (I hope someone does though).   OKC has a sophomore Kevin Durant averaging 20+ and a rookie Russell Westbrook with a team of nobodies and they only made it to 13th in the West. With how stacked the West is this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did really, REALLY bad, even if SGA is a good player."
"Kevin Durant knows the game of basketball extremely well, he’s just had a lot of past transgressions that people (fairly and unfairly) hold against him."
"Here’s 26 players (not in order).  Jordan  Magic  LeBron  Bird  Tim Duncan  Wilt  Russell  Kobe  Moses Malone  Oscar Robertson  Kevin Durant  Shaq  Steph Curry  Hakeem  Kareem  Jerry West  John Havlicek  Kevin McHale  Dr J  David Robinson  Kevin Garnett  Isiah Thomas  Elgin Baylor  Karl Malone  John Stockton  Scottie Pippen  Show me the 2 people he’s EASILY above.  He’s def one of the greatest player of all time, but I put him down in the next tier with D Wade and Dirk, etc etc."
"Kevin Durant- Do not sign with Golden State. It ruined his reputation and made everyone hate him. Plus, no one gives him credit for the titles."
"In a few weeks, the Nets will have: Julius Erving, Rick Barry, and Kevin Durant at the 3."
Kevin Durant is actually the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs
"What about the likes of Oscar Robertson, Moses Malone, Jerry West, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant and even Steph Curry. How does he compare to them? I’d put them all around that range too.  Dr. J is hard to rank when you consider that most of his accolades came from the ABA, and his production/minutes dropped when he switched over."
[Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors announced on Instagram that he underwent successful surgery Wednesday to repair the Achilles' tendon in his right leg that had ruptured **two days earlier** during Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/sports/kevin-durant-ruptured-achilles.html&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk9oWd-57tAhUtqlkKHb4sAkgQFnoECAUQBA&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sHLHz444Fs4kNepR35jS1)
Kevin Durant scored 3 times with one shoe off.
"It's not like the Pelicans didn't try.   They brought in tons of guys - there's just a simple reality that New Orleans can't attract Lebron James or Kevin Durant in free agency.  They did the best they could.  Which is entirely why AD left at the end of the day - so he could go play with a guy like Lebron.  If that isn't the very definition of ""not loyal"", then I don't know what is.  So you could just as easily turn that quote around ""Anthony Davis... I would never want a guy like that to play for Boston after what he did to the Pelicans... NO LOYALTY... the Pels gave their heart and soul to try to build a winner around AD and he still wanted out... anyone can print that."""
Yeah also said that he's Kevin Durant and next game destroyed them despite Bev fouling him all over the place.
"Even without Kevin Durant, i'm not sure they would have won it if Klay Thompson doesn't get hurt."
"I know it will come off as homerism, but I feel like a team that makes savvy trades is more deserving of the good picks they get than a team that *earns* those picks by losing.     It depends on how you want to look at it:  * Which fans have suffered more?  * In this sense Boston hasn't deserved any of the top picks we've gotten besides Smart. Our FO has done a fantastic job in rebuilding post big-3.    * Which FOs have done more?  * In this sense, Boston did more to earn the 2017 #1 pick than any of LA / Philly / Pheonix. All those franchises did was suck ass through a straw.   If you had said that Boston fans don't deserve a lottery pick for Jeff Green you would have a case but Boston as an organisation have worked incredibly hard to get to the situation we're now in and have overcome some crazy bad luck.  You think losing the #2 pick because of a trade was bad?   * We missed out on Kevin Durant in free agency because of a freak cap spike along with Curry's injury history meaning that one of the most dominant teams of all time was able to sweep in and take him * We got the #3 pick in a ""2-man draft"" * 2017 was the first time our franchise got a #1 pick since the 50s, and the clear cut consensus pick was a bust.  * Our top 5 MVP candidate had a career-threatening injury, the likes we haven't seen since Derrick Rose * The all-star PG we traded for to replace him ended up being a headcase * Our newly signed all-star had a career-threatening injury in the first quarter of playing for us  Boston has made it's own luck, with a worse GM we'd be a joke team at this point."
That probably has something to do with Kevin Durant tearing his Achilles
Yeah I don’t disagree fully. It just should be rough at the start but when he gets into rhythm it’ll be fine. Kevin Durant at his worst is a 7 foot sniper with a quick release and deep range

&gt; (Living in an injury free world)  You can’t just discount a huge part of an argument because it doesn’t fit your narrative lmfao. One of these really young players could break both of his legs in a skiing accident and we’d never hear about him again.  This is like saying “Kevin Durant is the best player of all time (in a Michael Jordan and LeBron James free world).” You’re throwing important parts of the argument away to strengthen your point
"Kevin Durant ""don't worry about what goes on at the middle of the conference of things."""
"Kevin Durant went to the Nets  Klay tore his ACL  Steph Curry broke his hand  Most of the team, besides DLO and Draymond Green are g league type players"
"A top 5 point guard this league, due to Kyrie and Steph being injured. He has been a top 20 player this year, in my opinion.  Point guards (this year): 1. Dame- 2. Russ- 3. Lowry 4. Trae 5. Kemba 6. Ben Simmons 7. Lavine 8. CP3 9. Bledsoe 10. Dinwiddie   My Top 20 (this year)  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. James Harden 3. LeBron James 4. Kawhi Leonard 5.  Anthony Davis 6. Luka Doncic 7.

"Without supposing players could adapt:    SG: 08'-09' Ray Allen    SG: 15'-16' Klay Thompson (yes, I have two shooting guards because Lebron plays the point on offense. Klay would guard the other team's best offensive guard.)    SF: 02'-03' Bruce Bowen    PF: 12-13' Lebron James    C:  03'-04' Kevin Garnett     The reason I build around James instead of Jordan is that I don't believe it is so easy to assume that he would be able to change his playstyle. Jordan used to play in the post and run isos all the time. We know what happened to the post, and isolation without the ability to shoot from three is rare (DeRozan is one of the few to be successful at that today). Of course Jordan would still be amazing, but I don't think it's trivial to guess that he would be able to get a good three point shot. I would go safe by picking an elite defensive team full of elite shooters around Lebron. I think Garnett would be so effective defensively in todays league that even if he doesn't shoot threes it would be ok, he could still spread the floor from mid range.  (btw I also don't think Garnett could adapt easily to shooting threes at all, because even though he was an elite mid range shooter, if you look at his shooting form, he shoots from way behind his head, so it is very hard to expand your range when your form is so messed up). I know I don't have an elite closer but honestly I don't think I would need much hero ball at the end of games with this team... it would be blowing teams away 24/7 Also I'm being realistic about chemistry... If I pick Durant instead of Bowen, Durant won't be so happy standing in the corner and watching Lebron play, so... I chose to go for role players who are proven to accept their roles as three and d."
&gt;probably winning the title  The Raptors only won the title because the opponents best player played 10 minutes in 6 games.  You don't trade away Jayson Tatum and picks so that you can maybe win a title if Kevin Durant is injured.
"This unprecedented winning streak by the Jazz this season has been a great story for the team and fans of the league, however it has gotten me and other worried basketball philosophers thinking, what if the Utah Jazz never lose another basketball game again?  2017-2018  The Jazz cruise into the All-Star break with a 108-96 win against the Suns. They get a good amount of media coverage over the course of the weekend, including a shout-out from Shaq during the Rising Stars game that makes all Jazz fans very happy. At All-Star Saturday, Mitchell wins the dunk contest with a very solid but not mind-blowing showing. The real fun however, does not await young Donovan at the extravagant Hollywood after-parties, but after the All-Star break. The Jazz continue their dominance with a big win against league goliath Houston. They set a new franchise record for wins in a row with a win against Orlando. They hit 20 against a struggling Pelicans team, but it doesn’t matter. The Jazz are the talk of the entire league. Their run is reminiscent of the 08’ Rockets. Donovan Mitchell is retroactively made an all-star. The entire team is crowned player of the month for February. The unstoppable force the Jazz have become does not end there. Donovan is hungry, Rudy is hungry, Quin is hungry. Their insatiable hunger can only be tempered with one thing. Wins. The Jazz continue the dominance, they hit 30 in a row against the Timberwolves, after an undefeated March, which the entire franchise is named player of the month, making it the first time somebody who was not a player was given the award. The entire league is watching to see if this team can set the league record for wins in a row. All their remaining teams have refused to rest their stars, including Golden State. On April 8th, the Jazz beat the Lakers 115-89, setting the NBA record for wins in a row, and cementing themselves as one of the greatest teams of all time. They close out the season and finish with a record of 54-28 and as the third seed in the west, not having lost since January 22nd. Many analysts have picked the Jazz as their champions going into the playoffs, but many more have still put their faith in the Warriors and Rockets, claiming there is no way this inexperienced Jazz team can tough it out in the playoffs. These heretics are quickly proven wrong. The Jazz sweep the Thunder in the first round, sweep the Rockets in the second, and beat the Warriors in a hard fought four game series in the Western Conference Finals. There is no more denying the greatness of this team, you are either in two camps, the one that believes the Jazz have somehow broken the game of basketball, or that they are somehow cheating. The vocal minority of the cheating crowd has ordered an investigation be done on the Jazz, however the league uncovers nothing, the Jazz are just simply a very good basketball team. After a clean sweep of the Cavaliers in the finals, the Jazz claim their first championship in franchise history, Donovan Mitchell is crowned Finals MVP in his rookie season, and their run is called the best, and most unlikely, story in sports history.  2018-2021  The Jazz enter the summer of 2018 on top of the world. After an undefeated summer league season, they enter free agency not looking to make any waves, despite Kevin Durant offering to sign with them for the minimum. The only move the Jazz decide to make is to sign NBA journeyman Alan Anderson to a minimum deal, in a move that confuses, but is also lauded by, many NBA pundits. In order to counter this Jazz superteam, LeBron signs with the Warriors on a minimum deal and convinces DeAndre Jordan to come with him. Donovan Mitchell, as one of the most famous athletes in the country, is invited to a golf weekend with other legends of the game. He is undefeated over the course of this weekend. The Jazz begin their 2018-2019 campaign with an undefeated preseason, and go 51-0 into the all-star break, with two close wins against the LeBron lead warriors. Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and, somewhat surprisingly, Joe Ingles, are all voted into the all-star game that season and the Jazz go on to break the Warriors single season record for wins and have the first undefeated season in NBA history when they win their 82nd game against the Portland Trailblazers. After a 16-0 playoff run, the Jazz are crowned NBA champions once again. Their Biblical dominance has inspired many to adopt Mormonism. LeBron and many other aging stars retire after this season, claiming that there is nothing left for them to do in the face of the unstoppable meat grinder the Jazz have become. The next seasons go similarly, with it being accepted that the Jazz have broken basketball. Every member of their roster is a household name, Donovan Mitchell has been crowned the GOAT, and NBA stars are either retiring, forming super-teams, or attempting to create their own leagues. After 4 undefeated seasons in row, interest in the NBA has dropped significantly. The Jazz have broken basketball and the league, the only hope on the horizon is that one day this core will be too old to compete, however, many believe the NBA will die before this occurs.  2022-2050  The Jazz do not stop. They do not relent. They have forgotten the sting of defeat, the scent of failure. Donovan Mitchell wins an NBA record 20 MVPs, to go along with his 20 championships and Finals MVPs, before retiring and becoming president of the Jazz organization. Mormonism has become the fastest growing religion in the world, with many claiming that God has decided that the Jazz can never lose again. Not even the few basketball experts remaining can prove them wrong. Jazz has also become the most popular genre of music in the country, with Dante Exum being the most popular musician, a career he decided to adopt after his retirement. Fearing that they have destroyed any chance of the NBA reaching the peaks it had once been at the top of, the Jazz create proxy teams in many of the smaller leagues formed due to the Jazz’s dominance. All of these teams go undefeated.  2050-2100  Jazz management have realized the power they have over the world of sports. Their proxy teams have spread to every basketball league, and eventually, every major sports league in the world. The Jazz are no longer simply an NBA team, they are a world dominating organization designed to infiltrate and destroy every sports league in the world. The Jazz create their own universities to enter collegiate sports, where they promptly go undefeated. Every major sports league in the world has been taken over by the Jazz proxy teams and like a parasite sucking the life from its host, the Jazz destroy nearly every single one of them. The Jazz eventually become recognized as their own nation in order to enter, and destroy, the Olympics.  2100-  The Jazz have become the most powerful organization in the world. They dominate what is left of the world sports market, but the organization has their sights on something greater. The Jazz begin to enter their own candidates into regional and national elections. Their candidates do not represent any party or ideology, they are simply the Jazz. The people of the world submit to their new Jazz overlords and the Jazz begin to dominate world politics. They have created a worldwide authoritarian regime ruled by the Mitchell royal family. The people are exploited by the organization, they simply exist to feed the incredibly lavish lifestyles the members of the Jazz organization live. Mormonism has become the religion of the world, under the orders of the authoritarian regime, everyone must convert. The original Jazz team still hold a game every year in order to honour their beginnings, where the best players from around the world gather to play in a game of basketball in which the losers are sacrificed to the Mormon god. There is no hope. There is no future. There is only Jazz.  (credit [u/Raptorsphone101](https://www.reddit.com/u/Raptorsphone101/) )"
"I think in 20 years it might be Kyrie's Game 7 winner vs the 73 win Warriors to bring Cleveland it's first title ever, shut down an all time great streak, and set off a chain of events that brought Kevin Durant in to join an already historic franchise. Real history maker there.  But right now I think it's Ray Allen for sure. Most fans are young enough to remember it. I sure wasn't alive to remember anything Jordan related, and I'm sure if there's anybody 80+ years old there was a more memorable moments than either of your options."
"James Harden (he’s ability to score is unreal) Giannis Kevin Durant  Anthony Davis And going out on a limb, Ben Simmons if he can become a more effective shooter."
"There’s a 7’3 17 year old Senegalese kid who is currently in the BWB program. He just started playing basketball 2 years ago once he hit his growth sport. He spent his entire life playing soccer but once he was 15 he decided to switch. He is on the skinny side but he can shoot from deep, can handle the ball, can shoot off the dribble and is freakishly athletic. NBA teams currently believe he is a mixture of Kevin Durant and Kristaps Porzingis. Even though his Offence is great, his defence is what really amazes scouts. He not only looks to be a great rim protector and able to switch onto the perimeter. He can realistically play the 4-5 but will have trouble matching up with the bigger centers in the league. He will likely come in his rookie year and average around 20/9/4 with great defence.  I made all of this up, I have no clue but maybe I’m right and people will look at this post and it ends up being right."
Its a pretty commonly held belief.  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-should-be-mad-at-kevin-durant-durant-stuck-him-with-all-the-work/  https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/  https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/oklahoma-city-thunder-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-mvp-051616
This was the exact case for Kevin Durant in 2013-14 as well. Not abnormal for players of that caliber.
"Dude those weren’t key guys. They literally did not miss a beat without them. Even when they supposedly had weak depth after those years and they had no Kevin durant they went 33-5 during those 3 years as long as they had curry and no durant and Klay also missed two of those losses. None of those bench players played big minutes, some of them got injured in the year and they didn’t miss a beat and none of them mattered after they left    The core 4 of golden state was was drived those pre Kd teams"
"No, he doesn’t have a better resume than Young this year. I already disproved this and you have yet to offer a single counter point because you don’t have one. Speaking it into existence won’t work when you don’t have proof bud.   And if you think all stars should be decided off who was an all star the year before, are you voting for Victor Oladipo this year? How about Blake Griffin? Kevin Durant? What an incredibly moronic way of deciding who you think is an all star.    Come back with some actual proof or else take your L. You have yet to even try to counter any reasons I listed for Trae besides “Lowry has been an all star before!”, which is quite possibly the dumbest reason I’ve ever heard."
"Kevin Durant is not a true champion despite his two FMVPs.  In 2017, Kawhi was giving him the business but went down in WCF G1 so they didn't face any adversity at all. In the Finals the Cavs gameplanned around Curry and didn't pay attention to him at all.  In 2018, he shrunk in back to back to back 4th quarters against the Rockets in the WCF and it took an injury to CP3 and a once in a lifetime drought from deep in order for them to win. In the Finals, in G1 he got a bullshit call in the closing possesions that nobody talks about (he commited an offensive foul, then the refs reviewed it and got him to shoot FTs). Then JR blunders LeBron's masterpiece. Then, the Cavs continue to gameplan for Curry and didn't pay attention to him at all.  Overall, he hasn't had to overcome any real difficulties on his own. He just put himself on the best team with the best teammates and won. They would be just as good without him. He has not earned shit."
Do you honestly think Westbrook impacts winning more then Kevin Durant?
"Lost their bench? They still had Livingston and Iguodala who were arguably the most important bench contributers even during the 16-17 season. Besides, they could still add David West and javale McGee who provided decent minutes. Oh, did I forget to mention Kevin motherfucking Durant?"
"Well lets assume LeBron won in the 2009-10 season with the cavs so he wouldn't rejoin the cavs. LeBron joins and the warriors would win the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons easily. Kevin Durant then still joins in 2016 off season and having LeBron at the helm of the side he would likely trade Draymond for the center they would badly need at that point. The center they would get would be none other than DeMarcus Cousins likely as he was quite sick of Sacramento and the fact that the Sacramento front office would likely trade DeMarcus for Draymond considering they wouldn't win in this warriors era anyway so then they would get draymond in prime and some 1st rounders or Iggy to rebuild with a future young core.  The From the 2016-17 season to the 2018-19 season the Golden State Warriors would boast a lineup of  G - Steph Curry  G - Klay Thompson  F - Kevin Durant  F - LeBron James  C - DeMarcus Cousins (prime)  This means the side would have not only the best player in the league, they would have the best, 2nd best, 3rd best players in the league whilst also having the best center in the league whilst having a 5/5 all star starting lineup.  They would undoubtedly win all 5 seasons from 2014-15 to 2018-19 whilst breaking records everywhere and likely sweeping the entire PLAYOFFS multiple years straight. I would assume the team would disband in the 2019 off season with LeBron going to the LA Lakers like he did in our timeline and he would do it with his great friends KD and AD likely winning many more championships in the purple and gold.  LeBron would probably end with something like 11 rings after going to the finals for literally the entire 2010's and a bit of the 2020's, 8 or 9 FMVPs and would likely still post all time career stat highs and would likely be known unanimously as the GOAT."
Oh my god Dwight Powell is the child of Kevin Durant and Zoidberg
He was supposed to the next Kevin Durant. I can see it.
Kevin Durant vs Internet Trolls in 2k19
Sam Presti went to his house to recruit him like he’s Kevin Durant LMAO
"Also didn’t leave his teammates to join the team that beat them which we can’t forget, is what Kevin Durant did in fact do"
"I agree about the bitch move, but his career isn't over yet. In terms of individual performance, he is absolutely a high ranking all time player with or without titles to his name. KD gets buckets, and always has, undeniably, whether this or that championship has an asterisk or not. Like taking his personality and decisions and accolades aside, Kevin Durant is a guy you bet on to score among all the guys in history you could possibly bet on."
"Do you guys think that when you say this that everyone can’t tell you are trying to compensate for LeBron being better by finding abstract ways to shit on him?Or do you know that and do it for attention?  &gt;But LeBron hasn’t done anything to change currys game  &gt; Kevin Wayne Durant (born September 29, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played one season of college basketball for the University of Texas, and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018."
"&gt; Its also really impressive to do it with different teams, start over and re-create championship contenders in multiple places.   Are you impressed by what kevin durant did? Not to say it was the same."
"Best players on a championship team? The only active ones are LeBron, Kawhi, Steph/Kevin Durant  am i missing someone"
This guy is becoming Kevin durant before our eyes
Dare I say Kevin Durant like?
"Texas (since too many teams in Texas and not enough colleges to go around):  PG Avery Bradley, DJ Augustin, Cory Joseph  SG Sterling Brown, Alex Caruso, Jarrett Culver  SF Kevin Durant, Kris Middleton  PF LaMarcus Aldridge, PJ Tucker, Jaxson Hayes  C Myles Turner, DeAndre Jordan, Jarrett Allen, Tristan Thompson"
"Just look at the yearly free throw stats. This has been happening to Lebron for a while  Lebron finishing place in free throws attempted.   2011 - 5th place - Durant and Dwight both played less games than Lebron and still shot more free throws than him. KEVIN MARTIN shot more free throws than Lebron.  2012 - 2nd place - Dwight played 8 less games and still shot 70 more free throws  2013 - 6th place - Harden played 2 more games than Lebron but he shot 257 more than Lebron. Kobe, Dwight and KD all shot more.  2014 - 8th place - KD shot 320 more FTs than Lebron. Even Derozan shot more than him. Harden shot 100 more.  2015 - 4th place- Boogie and Russ played less games than Lebron and still shot more FTs , Russ shot 100 more, Harden shot 300 more  2016 - 11th place - Harden shot 350 more free throws than Lebron. Lebron finished behind KD, PG13, IT, Wiggins, Russ, Deandre, Derozan, Boogie and James. Boogie played 11 less games and shot 200 more free throws   2017 - 12th place - Harden another 340 more than Lebron, same with Russ. Kawhi, Wiggins, Dame, Giannis, AD, IT, Boog, Butler.  2018 - 8th place - Harden another 200 more. Lebron played NINE more games than Dame and still shot less free throws."
"It's what most people think. It's what the stats show, accolades show, and all-time rankings. Newsflash MJ is a far better player than Kevin Durant too."
More importantly how obsessed are you with Kevin Durant?
"You do when the East was weaker than previous years. Like you expect them to lose to the Pistons?  They did better against worse eastern conference teams, and got demolished by an unprecedentedly stacked Warriors team. What does that prove?  Obviously the Warriors would have been worse off by not signing Kevin Durant, same with any team in the league ever. Doesn’t mean you needed him."
"He is an incredible player. Crazy how Kevin Durant coudn't beat steph, klay, draymond and 6th man iggy even though he had prime westbrook, prime ibaka and adams"
"Lol just peak /r/nba looking to ""well actually!!!!"" about anything they can grasp at. He's not 6'1 I dont care what the official re measurements declared. Ive stood next to him when I got to meet him for a second at something years ago I was taller than him and Im not quite 6'0. I know other people with stories like that. And no those official measurements are not 100% accurate(ie as one ex KD has even admitted he's 6'11 without shoes but prefers to be listed as 6'9. His official measurement was [6'9.5 in that thing](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/10/18/kevin-durant-height) I dont care what the NBA claims about those official measurements he's not that)"
"&gt; What Kevin Durant did was flat out pathetic there is no other way to say it.  &gt; **KD didn’t need the warriors to win titles either, he had a great team and is a great enough player that I wanted to see him earn a ring but I guess KD didn’t believe in himself.**  KD fans need to read this any time they make excuses for him. A player of his caliber had more than enough to win it in okc, the 3-1 lead is proof of that.   Weakest move ever in history of sports. He got his rings, but he'll never be ranked as high as a player of his caliber should be."
Oh I'm so sorry my team brought Kevin Durant to win 2 more rings. Tears just won't stop
He would say Kevin Durant crapped in his pants
"[( 2011) ""Kendrick Perkins helped me become a leader"" - Kevin Durant (1:45) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZWj0jar9f4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=105)"
Leader and Kevin Durant should not be in the same sentence
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony-- all before the franchise was even 10 years old."
Have you missed the past like four years of kevin durant?
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant shot 0% this year, so it's Gallinari"
The fuck. Lebron James is a far better player than Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant joined a team that won  •	⁠67 games •	⁠the 2015 NBA championship •	⁠Had the 3rd longest win streak in nba history •	⁠won 73 games which is an nba record •	⁠Defeated Kevin Durant and his superstar teammate (who won mvp the following season) in the western conference final after durant had the worst choke job of his life - Made back to back NBA finals  Then they replaced their worst starter with arguably the 2nd best player in the league who’s team was the top competitor to the warriors  in the west  What Kevin Durant did was flat out pathetic there is no other way to say it. The warriors made another finals after he got injured in 2019 and still almost took it to 7 with Klay missing key points of the series. The warriors didn’t need Kd to win titles and KD didn’t need the warriors to win titles either, he had a great team and is a great enough player that I wanted to see him earn a ring but I guess KD didn’t believe in himself. The warriors  and KD both knew that teaming together would make them so unbeatable that rings were a guarantee so he did it.  It’s literally like if Larry Bird ditched his Celtics teammates in order to win even more titles with the Lakers. They both could and did win titles without each other but if they were together they would have won ALL the titles    He didn’t earn those rings and he isn’t a true champion. The hardest part of the rings was reading the contract before he signed the dotted line  He didn’t wasn’t to actually test himself and battle for a championship like all the other great in NBA history. With a little bit of luck he could have won a title without joining a 73 win team but I guess KD didn’t believe he had it in himself and it’s sad that he gave up."
"PERK IS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE. FUCK KEVIN DURANT FOR LIFE, HE DESTROYED THE NBA WHO JOINS A 73 WIN TEAM WHEN YOURE THAT GOOD"
"No need to draft Kevin ""The Snake"" Durant when you can just buy the whole franchise and move then."
Curry bounce pass to Kevin Durant: https://youtu.be/NapCyfehW64?t=41
I’d rather have any of the following on my team:  In no particular order 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo  2. Luka Doncic 3. Steph Curry 4. Lebron James 5. Kevin Durant 6. Anthony Davis 7. James Harden 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Karl Anthony Towns 10. Pascal Siakam 11. Joel Embiid 12. Jimmy Butler  13. Paul George  14. Kyrie Irving  15. Klay Thompson 16. Bradley Beal 17. Damian Lillard 18. Nikola Jokic 19. Trae Young 20. Devin Booker 21. Donavon Mitchell  22. Kemba Walker 23. Kyle Lowry  There’s probably arguments for some other guys too but those are the guys I’d firmly take over Gobert. So he is roughly top 25 Imo
"No, people said the same thing about Lebron **until he beat the 73-9 warriors pretty much all by himself**.   Kevin Durant has never won anything with him being the obvious guy and best player. He could have, but he didn't. He took the hardest road."
"It really is a shame Sam Presti will always be known for trading away Harden then subsequently losing Durant.  His track record aside from that is near perfect. He did almost everything perfectly for a small market team, and the amount of talent he's been able to find is incredible. It's just remarkable that he continually trades away late bloomers (James Harden, Victor Oladipo, Domas Sabonis, Eric Bledsoe... etc) (Here are his highlights).  2007:  * Drafted Kevin Durant (Best Player in the Draft) * Traded Ray Allen for #5 pick (Jeff Green), Wally Szerbiak, Delonte West, 2nd pick * Traded Rashard Lewis for Capspace and 2nd * Used Capspace to absorb Kurt Thomas' contract and 2 first round picks (Serge Ibaka and Quincy Pondexter)  2008:  * Drafted Russell Westbrook (Best Player in the Draft) * Drafted Serge Ibaka with the 24th pick (arguably top 5 player from the draft) * Traded a late first rounder for Thabo Sefolosha  2009:  * Drafted James Harden (Arguably the best player int he draft, Curry is the only real competition)  2010:  * Drafted Eric Bledsoe with the 18th pick, later traded for a future first  2011:  * Traded Bledsoe first round pick and others to Boston for Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson, maybe his worst non Harden decision). * Drafted Perry Jones III with the 28th pick  2012:  * Signed Derek Fisher * Traded Harden and Filler for Steven Adams, Mitch McGary, Kevin Martin and Jeremy Lamb  2013:  * Traded Kevin Martin for Cap Space * Drafted Steven Adams 12th (Top 5 player from the draft) * Signed Andre Roberson  2015:  * Traded Lance Thomas for Dion Waiters * Drafted Cameron Payne 14th overall * Traded Reggie Jackson, Kendrick Perkins and Tibor Pleiß for Enes Kanter and Kyle Singler  2016:  * Traded Serge Ibaka for Victor Oladipo, Domas Sabonis and Ersan Illyasova * Traded Illyasova for Jerami Grant  2017:  * Traded Anthony Morrow and Cameron Payne for Taj Gibson and Doug McDermott and 2nd round Pick * Traded Victor Oladipo and Domas Sabonis for Paul George * Traded Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and 2nd round pick for Carmelo Anthony  2018:  * Traded Carmelo and a protected first for Dennis Schröder  2019:  * Traded Paul George for Danillo Gallinari, SGA and a shit ton of picks * Traded Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul and 4 first rounders or pick swaps"
So what you’re saying is that Kevin Durant cares enough about whether or not this 17 year old kid respects him to answer back multiple times?

"Why are we even conjecturing? KD literally yelled at his agent and asked him why he let him ruin his life by joining GS. Obviously there's some regret if this transpired.  &gt; “I was up at 6 a.m. and he [Durant] calls me and says, ‘Yo, are you up?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, what’s up?’ And he’s like [yelling], ‘Why the f— did you let me do this to my life?’""  https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y"
IS this a Kevin Durant burner account?
"&gt; Yes because the mvp of the league is always the best player in the league  He also had the highest PER in the league. What’s your argument for anyone else in 2014?  &gt; Damn it’s insane he could score all those points with so much defensive attention on him.   It’s insane that you’re trying to downplay someone averaging 35 in the goddamn NBA Finals. Take a step back and think about how ridiculous it is to pretend that he wasn’t getting defensive attention when he’s Kevin freaking Durant.  You’re pathetic, dude."
ray allen did do a kevin durant but allen was at the end of his career so idk we think its okay?. he did hit that shot for lebron though.
"making the western conference finals is not negated by getting swept by the 2016 warriors without harrison barnes.  the sweep means less because they led the warriors for a solid 80% of those 4 games before choking it.   it means even less because the warriors missing kevin durant is still a championship core, whereas the blazers missing Nurkic seriously hollows out their offensive and defensive scheme.  the comment I’m replying to is about KD saying “don’t worry what goes on at the top” and then someone pointing out that they made the WCF, then the dipshit I replied to said “got swept lul”, as if that changes anything about the fact that they beat OKC &amp; Denver and then gave the warriors 4 competitive games without their second best player."
I stand with Kevin Durant. He's a nice guy and people pick on him all the time like he's a sand bag. Just stop. Perkins is a dumbass and his take is stupid. We don't have to give this kind of people attention they don't deserve.
"Nah, he got the [tribute](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/kevin-durant-thunder-cupcake-troll-oklahoma-city-fans-costume-westbrook-warriors-return) he deserved."
[Yep](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/kevin-durant-thunder-cupcake-troll-oklahoma-city-fans-costume-westbrook-warriors-return)
We gave KD his [tribute.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/kevin-durant-thunder-cupcake-troll-oklahoma-city-fans-costume-westbrook-warriors-return)
"Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, and Dirk Nowitzki."
Kevin Durant if he played would cook all these guys
"He picked up his phone. Another notification. His Pilates membership had expired. ‘God fucking damn it’ he immediately thought. ‘I’m not going back to doing exercises in front of the tv again’. It was late, he had to sleep.   The buzzing from under his pillow confused him initially. Dozing off but awake now, Perk was now focused on the screen in front of him. Kevin Durant has sent him a full frontal dick pic at a nudist beach in what appeared to be Denmark. ‘I’m fucking done. 6 weeks of this bullshit and I’m getting dick pics every Thursday night like fucking clockwork’. Perk was pissed, the throttle was down.   He thought about calling him, but knew that he would only receive Portuguese swear words before being abruptly hung up on, as has happened countless times beforehand. He could reply to his tweets, but Perk was exhausted and wanted to sleep on it once more.  🤝   ‘Fuck you Kevin you little 3-1 bitch. I wore a turtleneck for 3 weeks straight because I lost a bet on that series. I constantly got asked if I could recommend any books, fuck you. I know you fucked with my flight back to LA by booking out every seat and have the air stewardesses only respond to me if I called them Kevin`"
Kevin Durant. Fraud.
I really don’t understand how a player like Kendrick Perkins could have the audacity to speak down on players like Kevin Durant. Truly beyond by comprehension.
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1646979-kevin-durant-donates-1-million-to-red-cross-for-okc-tornado-relief  Amazing how perception changed so quickly on him... this article is so glowing about him, even mentions how he tried to stay anonymous on the donation."
pretending kevin durant doesn't exist
I would love for Russ and harden to win a ring and then all come back for one last ride  Final game stats:  Russell Westbrook: 30/10/10 on 40%TS  James Harden: 45/5/5 on 30 FTs  Kevin Durant: 35/8/3 on 75%TS and 4 angry tweets
"Thats Kevin “Cupcake” “”Snake”” Durant for you, pay some respect"
"Kevin Durant is the best player to play for the Thunder, same as how MJ is the best to ever play for the Wizards (although obviously KD had a better OKC career than MJ did wizards)  BUT Russ is 100% the best Thunder ever"
Alt title: More proof Kevin Durant takes the easy way out by picking on a 5-ppg player rather than Russ because he knows he'll keep losing.
Kevin Durant every year
This is Kevin Durant *while he's in the NBA*  Dude is gonna be entertaining when he's like 40+
"[This took all of three seconds to find](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2416840-kevin-durant-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-thunder-for-entire-career)  &gt;“I love it here man. I love my teammates, I love the city, I don’t really think about anywhere else"""
"I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am."
He's been turning me over the last few months but this has sealed the deal. I'm a Kevin Durant fan now after being a hater since June 2016.
"Like I said, it was common among Lakers fans and hot take-spewing sites like B/R. The author of the article you included typed the following, presumably with a straight face:   &gt;In any NBA trade value chart, the only player that should rank higher than Bynum is LeBron James.  As if Kevin Durant wasn’t already a dominant force a full year younger than Bynum. That’s your source? Yea, some people thought it to be true. These are the same people who sway their opinions based on clickbait and hot takes they see on tv. They were not the majority or even close to it. Dwight was a proven commodity; Bynum was an injury-prone but very gifted up-and-comer with the hype of the Lakers fan base behind him."
After KD left he was asked it stung and he said “stings for who”    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxsports.com/nba/story/russell-westbrook-when-asked-if-kevin-durant-leaving-okc-stings-for-who-080416%3famp=true
I figured 2020 would be the year commentators would stop reminding us that Kevin Durant left.
I love how there was as little Kevin Durant in the video as possible. I think I saw him once the entire video. Which makes it perfect
*Kevin Durant will remember that*
Like a lot of people were cheering for him. Like a lot. Like everyone was literally screaming their lungs out since Kevin Durant won many championships for the Thunder.
The OKC Thunder finally put Kevin Durant in a video tribute.
"My point about the stats was it makes them more visible. They're not getting voted because of their performance but if they weren't so far up on the list, most people wouldn't go searching for them out of laziness. Kevin Durant is on the ballot but you dont see him up on the vote tallies."
Kevin Durant in 2014 - 15 after only playing 27 games.
I always name any male Durant I catch Kevin
"i feel like this question could have been answered by a simple BBREF and ""Kevin Durant OKC highlights"" search"
Kevin Durant to the Lakers confirmed.
"**2016**  Regular season - 28.2 ppg on 51/39/90  Playoffs -  28.4ppg on 43/28/89  **2014**   Regular season - 32.0ppg on 50/39/87  Playoffs -  29.6ppg on 46/34/81  **2013**  Regular season - 28.1ppg on 51/42/91  Playoffs - 30.8ppg on 46/31/83  .....   2016 vs Golden State (against the team he joined after he couldn’t beat them) - 30/8/3 on 42/29/92 splits (54% TS)  2014 WCF vs spurs - 26/8/3 on 48/33/76 splits (56% TS)   2013 WCSF vs Memphis - 29/10/7 on 42/36/77 splits (53% TS)   That certainly isn’t what he was shooting when he had the pleasure of playing with the 2 greatest shooters ever.   He wasn’t bad but it’s not the elite level efficiency that people expect out of him.      Kevin Durant absolutely wasn’t putting up the kind of efficiency numbers he had in golden state because he had the easiest life any superstar has ever had while he was playing with golden state. Having a 73 win team and goat spacing around you help a lot    Again, I’m not saying these are bad numbers but it’s obvious he didn’t play as well in the playoffs compared to his regular season play until he joined a 73 win team."
"And I know this sub memed gravity to death but it's still absurd that during finals games , Steph was doubled as soon as he crossed the half line allowing Kevin fuckin Durant an easy drive to the basket. Cleavland was more scared of curry 3s"
Kevin Durant...
"You do realize that Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer, likely ever?"
He's Kevin Durant
"Idk kevin Durant, the other OKC teammate"
"you really thing a ""turned it on"" kawhi is better than a ""turned it on"" Steph curry, Lebron James, Kevin Durant????"
"It was my favorite place to come home to"" Durant continued, ""after a long day.""  ""In the summertime, you could hear the birds chirp as dawn came. And in the evening, the cicadas would rock you to sleep. With his arms wrapped around me, I felt safe. It was just me and my Dion. Us against the world.""  ""In Fall, we would play basketball on the court behind the mansion. His sweat-drenched back, up against my stomach, as I draped over him. And soon, we were on the court, naked up against each other. With my back on the warm pavement of center court, he mounted and entered me. Over and over again, he thrust inside me, each deeper than the last. Faster and faster until he let out a masculine moan. 'And one', as he burst inside me. I was forever his Kevin."""
You know who I am... I’m Kevin Durant.
"I agree, but the context should favor him somewhat. He is the only superstar who was vocally against jumping to a superteam.   We can't criticize both KD and Dame for winning/not winning titles, respectively.  Basically, if you want to call KD's rings cheap or fake, you can't then call out Dame for not winning one because he chose not to team up with other superstars.  If you were to compare him to Curry or Harden, who would be considered Dame's best teammate? Aldridge doesn't really compare to Kevin Durant. Just my thoughts."
[Cook and KD grew up togetherish too. ](https://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Warriors-Kevin-Durant-and-Quinn-Cook-friends-12800051.php)
"I think I have far too heavy a bias towards Westbrook to ever have a fully objective discussion on him. When Durant left OKC to join the Warriors, he stayed (albeit to make a shit ton of cash, but he still stayed). I respect the competitive drive and nature, even if I find him pretty abrasive at times.  But I cannot say I've seen his game grow and mature. I really wish he deferred to Kevin Durant their entire time together in OKC the same way he did to Paul George the year after Carmelo left, because **that** was the play style that would be conducive to OKC's success. Instead, I remember Kevin Durant touching the ball once in four possessions in a pivotal Game 6 OT period in 2014, (with Westbrook jacking up contested shots during those possessions) the second-last time OKC would seriously challenge for a championship in the Wild Western Conference."
"I'm still very happy with the FO office decision of getting Kyrie, KD, and DJ. Sure they both have emotional and physical baggage, but it's a no brainer move to try and acquire two potential top 20 players. Especially for a franchise like the Nets who are still struggling to carve out a fanbase and have zero history of acquiring big names in the off-season.  Sure Kyrie still has a big dumb mouth and hasn't been playing at an all-NBA lvevel, but even in these last buncha games since his return he's looked like the best player on the court for the Nets and he's still one of the most fun players to watch in the NBA.  Also it's not like we gave up a ton of picks or took on bad contracts in order to make this acquisition happen or even gave up a promising future. We essentially traded a perennial future of D'Lo getting knocked out in the first round for Kyrie and KD. I'm very thankful that I can continue to like D'Lo instead of potentially hating him for getting the max from our FO. In an alternate universe there'd be posts about D'Lo, a previous all-star and max player, leading the Nets to a sub 0.500 record despite upgrading parts around him.  I'm also super happy that Kyrie and KD didn't go to the Knicks and Kyrie didn't stay on the C's, because despite Kyrie's antics on the Celtics I was always a little worried that if Kyrie stayed Ainge would pull the trigger on the AD trade creating an absolute monster super team.  So, uh yeah. While I do wish Kyrie could display more tact to the media (I feel like the people around him and his PR don't really care since he's still selling a shitton of jerseys and shoes) and wish he wasn't injured so much, I'm still pretty pumped that Kyrie Irving is on my team and he brought Kevin fucking Durant."
You're criticizing someone else's franchise... for having a bad front office. The same front office that signed Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in the offseason.  Your franchise's front office is the Knicks front office.  Do you understand why this is crazy? Feel free to go off on the Nets because they have less fans or something but pick your angles man.
"Top 5 scorers of the 2010 decade:  1.  James Harden.  19,413  2.  LeBron James.  18,375  3. Russel Westbrook. 17,218.    4.  Kevin Durant. 16,973.    5.  Demar Derozan. 15,234.   Rest of top 10: Steph Curry, LeMarcus Aldridge, Damien Lillard, Blake Griffin, Carmelo Anthony.   Consistently and health have been Demar’s key.  That’s a long run of excellence.  He’s not a super star but he’s sure been good for a long time."
"Thats just not true. Kevin Durant is absolutely a generational talent, he just had the unfortunate luck of playing during the same time as another bigger generational talent. If Kobe is on the list then so is Duncan."
"Remember, Lebron averaged 33 points in the 2018 postseason and 32.8 in the 2017 postseason. That’s more points than prolific scorers like Kobe, Harden, and Kevin Durant have ever averaged in a postseason.  This was just a year and two years ago. I think he’s still very capable. I feel like we’ve seen him go into scoring mode when his team needed it, and I feel like they’ll really need it in the playoffs."
"Giannis got outdrafted too. Last year Kawhi, Lebron, Durant, Harden, and Kyrie were the starters for team Lebron lol.   &gt;[Giannis is not from here so I understand next year he'll be better picking his team.] (https://streamable.com/f5eky)  ~ Kevin Durant"
Have you heard of a guy named Kevin durant?
"its easy to shit on kyrie  so i will take the opportunity to do so  hes a total joke, and kevin durant is weak enough mentally that he fell for kyrie's pitch  lmao who the fuck besides durant signs up to play with this guy"
This 2020 team with Kevin Durant wins the finals. Yes or no?
[JAN 2017 MVP RACE COLUMN](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/06/mvp-ladder-week-9-kawhi-leonard-emerges-leader-spurs?collection=mvp-ladder)  KD is listed 3rd after Harden and Russ who were having historic years.

you comparing Porzingis to Kevin Durant
Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant  CP3  Zach Lavine  Dame
"I’m praying for you bro. I know having a disability can be tough.    I said KD isn’t a great BIG MAN. He’s a great wing and can play as a stretch 4 but he is absolutely horrible at big man skills.    Kevin Durant has given up the most offensive rebounds on free throws because of his poor boxing out out of any player I’ve seen in my life, he is one of the worst screen setters in the league, he is a poor rebounder for a man of his size especially in the era of long rebounds (Kd plays more on the perimeter) and he cannot guard real big men whatsoever"
Kevin Durant post Thunder years. He legit rim protected playoff games for OKC at times.
"Stay in Milwaukee, I think.   Might sound odd, but I’d think I’d rather be a Dwyane Wade than a Kevin Durant."
"Fans of other teams respect you more. Kevin Durant has won more rings and is a better player than Dirk, but Dirk gets a huuuge amount of respect from a lot of fan bases for being a lifer with 1 ring"
Has he ever criticized Carmelo's entire career or does he only criticize Carmelo's past two years? Because Carmelo in the past 2 years was not a good player.  Steph Curry is a volume scorer. James Harden is a volume scorer. Kevin Durant is a volume scorer. Giannis is a volume scorer.  Kawhi is a volume scorer. Luka is a volume scorer. Lillard is a volume scorer. LeBron is a volume scorer. Zach Lowe doesn't hate any of those guys.  Just because you are a fan an inefficient volume scorer doesn't mean all volume scorers have to be inefficient.
Imagine Kevin Durant joining that team
How is this dogshit upvoted? Okc kd went to the finals when he was 22 and put up 30 ppg on 65% TS against the heatles. Kevin Durant is the best and most efficient scorer of all time
If only he had another superstar like Kevin Durant on his team.
"His playstyle is the poor man’s Kevin Durant, but people see his name and athletic build and assume he’s that roleplaying stretch 4 like Bjelica or Bertans no offense to them"
"DLo is an allstar replacement. CP3 is lowkey an allstar still, and his contract is equally as bad as Russ’, he is just older. A top 3 pick doesn’t mean shit, we learn this lesson almost every single draft year, there is a good chance the person they take is out of the league in 5 years. Eric Paschall is intriguing but he doesn’t get you KAT man, this is just Warriors fans being delusional because they got Kevin Durant during one of the softest moves in basketball and now they think they are entitled to all the good players. If you really think another team won’t beat this shitty offer for KAT you are kidding yourself."
They have literally played the kevin Durant warriors for the past 2 years straight. If any team makes a mistake against them they were toast. It’s a bad argument for you
Even if its 1% its a possibility. We are talking about Kevin fucking Durant man
"I don't know if this works because the 0-27 game was a single digit game where the lineup had Harden as his teams only allstar competing and even winning at the half against a lineup including Kevin Durant (MVP), Steph Curry (MVP), Klay Thompson (allstar) and Draymond Green (allstar).  Their system allowed them to come damn close to beating the unstoppable KD Warriors in a 7 game series, which is something no other team has even gotten close to"
Nobody dropped a 50 note on that league... EVER? How long are the games? I feel like Kevin Durant could go there and average 50 even with a bum achilles.
&gt;Being the best college freshmen of this century is also impressive.  You didn't see Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant play in college?
"&gt; How is it fair to compare a star season to a sixth man season? We're comparing them in their primes. We're not doing some obviously bullshit age comparison for you to make a worthless point.  Because you brought up when Kobe won his rings and try to paint he was unimportant because any other player swapped with him would've won? Then I compare their abilities during those ages, Kobe is better. And don't act like Harden wasn't treated as a star during 2012, they were the fucking OK3. Kobe as a starter in 2000 is as much of a star like Harden in 2012.  &gt;Yeah, Harden sucks for not being able to beat a team with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green with a bunch of role players. Incredible argument.  He couldn't beat them for one game when they had the momentum. We can keep going on about it, yes he couldn't beat them because he was a dumbass who led his team to reach the point of going 0/27 from 3. Prime Kobe in that situation with a 3-2 lead would've closed that series.   &gt;Your level of willful ignorance is amazing. If the Bryant + Gasol Lakers had run into the Durant Warriors they would have won zero championships.  If Prime Kobe was up against the Durant Warriors, then his style of play and the team assembled around him would've been adjusted. The new and improved meta would require teams to adjust and build suited for that era, what kind of idiot thinks a team built for a previous less effective meta would win fare well with the newest generation?  Prime Kobe put in this era would play different. That's why you compare players based on the data available, not making excuses and basing it off of what ifs.   That's why Kobe is the better scorer, I don't have to make excuses for him on why he didn't manage to win. His scoring he used during his time was effective. Harden's doesn't get him I'll wait for the excuses when Harden doesn't win again this season."
"How is it fair to compare a star season to a sixth man season? We're comparing them in their primes. We're not doing some obviously bullshit age comparison for you to make a worthless point.   &gt; You mean the Warriors the Rockets almost eliminated before CP3 went down? The one they almost beat if they hadn't been idiots with the 3-philosophy? Really showed how that team was most effective when CP3 controlled the game and not when following Harden's lead.  Yeah, Harden sucks for not being able to beat a team with Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green with a bunch of role players. Incredible argument.   &gt;  GSW so dominant they beat Mozgov Delly version of Cavs in 2015 and LeBron + bench level players in 2018  The Rockets were the only team to push the Durant Warriors past five games up to that point.   &gt; And Prime Paul for one season + Prime Harden should be better than Kobe-Pau if Harden was so good.  Your level of willful ignorance is amazing. If Bryant + Gasol had run into the Durant Warriors they would have won zero championships."
"The money going to coaches and earned from marketing, should be used to pay for facilities, medical, and all the costs associated with game days, travel, etc. That way, it is funneled back to the players directly, without filling their pockets. That makes admission a fixed thing so as not to generate crazy ticket prices.   The NCAA could create a rule to enforce a 2-year minimum for all college athletes. An AA isn’t much, but it’s something. And the way the NCAA justifies this is that the rule is considering schooling the primary objective for all of its athletes. While there may be some players that whine about this, a university will always be in the right if they are prioritizing the students education. It’s supposed to be the purpose of a university.  If the true value of being a student athlete is the scholarship, then that should be the focus regardless of if you are Kevin Durant or a 4-year random Joe at a mid major. Your example of Trae Young feels grounded in the problem. Sure, Trae would love for his name and face to be out there, but that shouldn’t even be a part of the collegiate athlete experience. It’s become that because of the billions of dollars being exchanged far beyond college Trae’s reach. Trae believing it’s best for him to be marketed for free is exploitation built unconsciously over years and years.   Getting rid of that exploitation may make Trae’s NBA prospects worse, it may bring in a lot less money to the college, but it will put education first.   I guess, the crux of our disagreement comes down to where does that $8 billion and ticket sales and marketing dollars go to? If all of that money goes right back into bettering education and facilities at the school, then I’d agree more wholeheartedly with your position. But if that money lines the pockets of a select few in the administration, the coach, CBS, etc. then the system needs to be changed.   I know money corrupts, therefore, I believe the latter is what is happening."

"The 50/40/90 club is pretty exclusive and not many have achieved it over a season.   Larry Bird Malcolm Brogdon (very impressive to be up here with these other guys) Steph Curry Kevin Durant Reggie Miller Steve Nash Dirk Nowitzki  Mark Price  As you can see, any player reaching these types of shooting numbers puts them up there with some of the greatest to ever play. If you want more info, I pulled this from Wiki, just search 50-40-90 club."
"Kevin Durant taught me that the calf twitch is a death sentence. Damn, get well soon Dwight. Sucks to see that happen to anyone."
Kevin Durant has a higher career 3FG% (40.1) than Ben Gordon (38.1%).  &gt;!In reality those numbers are reversed.!&lt;
"Yeah, for regular season success. They have struggled in the playoffs, and as they always say, two points is better than no points. Yeah, three pointers might be the MOST effecient, but dont ignore the importance of the midrange. Offensive superstars with playoff success include: Stephen Curry Kevin Durant Kawhi Leonard They are the three most deadly midrange players right now. The only missing superstar from the last few years is big bad Bron who is a different beast."
"First, thank you for having an intelligent conversation. I appreciate your reasoning being well thought out and agree with a lot of it. Though I was mostly referencing the monetization and exploitation of high school athletes, I do have several beefs with the NCAA. I agree with your assessment that a lot of NCAA student athletes get a good deal.   I disagree with you though in that I believe the NCAA was an enormous influence on the stupid one and done rule. They had signed a $6 billion deal with CBS in 1999, and with the success of Kobe and Garnett and with Lebron making the jump in 2003, that deal was becoming less and less worth it as it aged. Then suddenly in 2005, Stern implements the rule. When in doubt, follow the money. The NBA has benefitted from the abundance of scouting opps and the free marketing of up and coming stars.   In 2010, the NCAA extended that deal for $10.8 billion. A sizable bump. Interestingly, the most recent extension is for $8.8 billion. Probably because the ACB, Australian, Euro and Chinese leagues  have become legitimate options for young Americans to say nothing of the talent being developed overseas. the G League and the new 2-way contract types have made that an option for players as well as parent clubs who can take less risk on players. I write all that to say, the NBA will probably do away with the one and done rule this upcoming CBA because the benefits of getting young guys now outweigh the potential costs. getting rid of that rule will do way more good than paying collegiate athletes a salary as I too find this “fix” highly problematic and wholly reactionary without fully understanding the potential hurdles and consequences.    However, I do wonder about this statement “...a system that generally works for half a million people.”   That’s a pretty big statement that very well could be true, but realistically isn’t as there have been and continue to be troubling signs all over. Coaches at top recruiting schools get paid asinine salaries. Schools market their star players. Admission to games gets uber expensive and inaccessible for most. Students always, in every stinking case, get the short end of the stick on NCAA rulings of student athletic violations. I’m not talking about top recruits accepting houses for their moms. I’m talking about players losing scholarships over phone calls and accepting lunch. Student athletics are being used to get undeserving kids into prestigious schools on “athletic scholarships”.  And then there’s the most despicable, the sexual abuse. The institutionalized and covered up for years sexual abuse.   If the NCAA really cared about its student athletes, it would never have agreed to the one and done rule, prioritizing the completion of a students education, at least an AA, over everything else. Instead, it marketed the hell out of Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson."
I don’t think you heard of Kevin Durant then because KD actually posts up
Ever heard of Kevin Durant?
Almost exactly like Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant * Kung Fu ""Snake"" Style *"
"People act like it doesn’t take time for these young teams to develop. OKC won 23 games their first year in Oklahoma with Kevin fucking Durant in year 2. At trae’s age, steph curry was still at Davidson. This kid is in year two and already a borderline unstoppable offensive weapon. I’d be ducking ecstatic to have him as my point guard of the future, his level of polish in terms of ball skill is insane at his age. Obviously the team needs a few years to grow around him, guys have to learn how to win. Give this kid a fucking break man it’s frustrating as hell watching this level of hate still after all the doubt he had leaving OU. Keep balling trae"
(In no order) Giannis Antetokounmpo Stephen Curry Anthony Davis Kevin Durant Joel Embiid Paul George James Harden LeBron James Nikola Jokić Kawhi Leonard
"Refs manipulate the game by giving teams free throws in the 4th, making it seem closer.   Also the Warriors had fucking Kevin Durant and Curry. Of course they’re going to get more fouls than Beverley"
Where the hell is Steve Nash and Kevin Durant
How come no one is talking about 3 peat (and counting) NBA Champion Patrick McCaw’s team?  PG: Steph Curry  SG: Patrick McCaw  SF: Kawhi Leonard  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Draymond Green  BPG: Kyle Lowry  BSG: Danny Green  BSF: Klay Thompson  BPF: Kevin Love  BC: Marc Gasol   11man: Pascal Siakam  12man: Andre Iguodala
I feel like I hear Kevin Durant a lot more than just Durant
Looking like Great Value Kevin Durant out there
"Ja cannot shoot like Nunn. Ja has a better % from 3 but it’s due to low volume. Nunn also has a much superior mid range jumper, as he is shooting 48% from deep 2 range, which is better than 8 different seasons of Kevin Durant. Morant is the better player but ur lying to urself if u think his jumpshot is better than Nunn’s."
Kevin Durant in the playoffs last year is missing
Maybe he misses the basketball player Kevin Durant?

" &gt;when players like TOBIAS HARRIS and KHRIS MIDDELETON can get paid the same amount of money as LEBRON JAMES and KEVIN DURANT there is a serious fking problem.  I'm the future don't just say it's a problem, explain why it is a problem."
I still remember that stupid ass ref giving Kevin Durant and JaMychal Green techs last season in the first round all because they were just talking to each other
*something that's a lost art*   Kevin Durant laughs
"Everyone keeps asking ""who would we trade"" when the real problem is D'Antoni or whoever the fuck it is on the coaching staff that is letting Harden continue with this bullshit ISO ball literally every other play.   In 2017, when KD came to the warriors and made that team boring to watch because they walked over every team like they were a fucking high school junior varsity team, I started watching the Rockets. Around this time, Harden was embarassing anyone who tried to guard him and constantly put down absurd lights out high-scoring performances, getting his team damn near close to the championships. He was earning it. Everyone on this team was.  But it don't be like that anymore. So many times I have to watch perimeter shooters wide open for the pass on a high percentage three while James Harden unsuccessfully takes three big men in the paint to the dome, looking like a fucking ragdoll while the other team fast breaks an easy 2 points while laughing at a legend that once was. I shed a tear every time.   This was supposed to be the team to take out the warriors and that bitch ass ""i want a ring without earning it"" kevin durant. All the right players came together, but this coach played them like a third grader who just got his first set of yugioh cards and tried to take on that fat fuck dylan whose mom buys him the newest decks everytime they go to walmart just to get that diabetic fuck to shut up.   This team has been wasted."
He could join....     Kevin Durant
"Y'all gotta chill with the terrible takes because of this performance. In no order Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and then who else? KAJ? Wilt? Malone?"
"No, you’re right. We should trust foresworn879 over Kevin Durant."
"Nice.   Um, off-topic, am I the only one feeling this?  Watching the HOU feed. These announcers are fucking AWFUL. In the span of like 15 seconds,  dude gives us these gems (upon which I turned off the sound):  * Harden/Westbrook used to play for OKC, and SO DID KEVIN DURANT, who now plays for the Nets.  * Salary cap = lots of player movement (but with a not-very-subtle dig at players as if this implied something bad about them, perhaps greed or disloyalty) * A snide comment about player salaries. Eyes audibly rolling as he mentions millions.  Thanks for the insightful commentary and the barely-hidden hatred/jealousy toward NBA players (to whom you owe your livelihood). You guys are just *wonderful* to listen to. Are there any WORSE commentators around the league? If so, I haven't heard 'em. Sorry if this topic has been previously explored..."
Ben Simmons klay Thompson Kevin Durant Or lebron  Anthony Davis Joel embiid
Yes they dodged a bullet by not signing a top 3 PG in the league and missing out Kevin Durant. I’m sure being at the bottom of the league really makes it worth it.
"A healthy Kevin Durant would probably win. If I recall correctly, the 2000 Olympic team had a one-on-one tournament and Kevin Garnett beat everyone. Kareem also pretty much crushed Dr. J in a one-on-one match. Height is really important in one-on-one, and guys like Giannis couldn't shoot while guys like Embiid would have a harder time dribbling their way into post position."
While he was on the Warriors definitely Kevin Durant  Now? Probably still Kevin Durant
1. LeBron James: 5.976 2. James Harden: 3.291 3. Kevin Durant: 3.209
"I don't think that big man is dead. I think their requirements have changed. You just can't be a big clunky guy in today's NBA and get away with having just size and a good post up game. You need to have other things like BBIQ (Gasol), playmaking (Jokic, Bam), athleticism etc.   There is also a different issue of tall ""big man"" players with more skill and athleticism playing at other positions. Kevin Durant, Ben Simmons and even Anthony Davis to a certain extent. This could be a reason why the best center of the last decade was a Anthony Davis who has had one playoff win."
"Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant went 1 pick after, I don’t have anything else to say"
"Kevin Durant, also Giannis. Both one pick before (and we had known serious interest in Giannis)."
"I think even [KD defended Oden saying he shouldn't be called a bust](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18044283/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-says-nonsense-greg-oden-feels-bust)  KD was of the opinion that Oden never even got to truly display his talents, and the few games he played he did show what he was about. An absolute force as a rim protector and rebounder."
"Kevin Durant, drafted by the SuperSonics only to turn into a Thunder. And a popped Achilles away from potentially becoming a back-to-back-to-back finals mvp"
"Would you take Kevin Durant over LeBron **on the offensive side of the ball** though. That is the conversation that we're having here. If you would not, then again you are a prime example of cognitive dissonance"
No a player being great offensively doesn’t mean you have to take them as the best player. Why is this hard for you to understand?   Healthy Kevin Durant is a better offensive player than Lebron but I wouldn’t take him over Lebron.   You love creating your own definitions don’t you Webster.
"Jeez first imagining Kevin Durant being 5’9 but same wingspan, a female in the NBA with perfect catch and shoot, and now this?"
"""kevin durant basketball player highest bang bang bangs in a game"""
"Kevin Durant is a pretty odd example for a topic like this. If you're in the conversation, that's living up to it. I mean, sane conversation, not skip bayless level conversation. Maybe a better pick would be someone with talent and potential that hasn't panned out. Andrew Wiggins is always a good go to for that."
Kevin Durant on all fours would be crazy good on defense
"As a minor side note, I've thought about the 5-man clone team more than one should and I determined that the only guy who could play all 5 spots with no major weaknesses is Kevin Durant."
If kevin durant was 5’9” he would be 130 lbs and out of the league. Not everyone can be IT
"I never said he was the goat, I’m just saying that Uve never seen Kareem play, so don’t go saying he is better than lbj. So many factors contribute to kareem success back then. The fact that he played in a dominant era for bigs, where 3 point shooting was non-existent. He had all the opportunity to dominate, today’s game is wayyyy more versatile as it has expanded immensely. Additionally, u can’t tell me that Kareem played against a warriors-esk team that was so stacked that even the best players of all time would struggle to beat them, especially on a one-man team. It’s sounds like a stupid argument but it’s true. Lebron 5/6 losses in championships were against the spurs (a formidable dynasty) and the 73-9 warriors, who continued to get better after getting Kevin Durant as well. If ur gonna go off of pure stats because Uve never seen Kareem play then it is almost evident Kareem is better than Jordan. Kareem has 6 chips, 6 MVPs, 15 all nbas, 2 Finals MVPs, 11 all defensive and the list goes on. With these stats Kareem trumps jordan, but obviously in all things considered Jordan is just the better player. The stats may say one thing, but also the era in which one played in can speak volumes, especially for Kareem. Lebron hasn’t even finished his career and is having an MVP career at 35. Let him finish his career before we start ranking him in the top 5. Because I guarantee u that when he retires he will be top 2 of all time."
Kevin Durant is a guard on the warriors?
"Kevin Durant and Antetokounmpo would not be bad together either, I feel."
I would never draft for need in basketball I think you always take the best player.  great players make it work. this is going way back but imagine the trailblazers with Clyde Drexler and Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant on the 2007- trailblazers teams
"and ""Kevin Durant from downtown! and Golden State takes the lead!"""
"LeBron went back to Cleveland after Miami to team up with Kyrie Irving and KLove in 2014-2015. That same year Steph curry took a huge jump and became an MVP en route to a warriors championship, but they only won it cuz Kyrie and klove we’re both hurt during the finals. 2015-2016 was the best season of the decade. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green on the warriors won 73 games and Steph won a unanimous MVP. I won’t spoil those finals for u in case u haven’t seen it but u should definitely check it out. Unfortunately after that season Kevin fuckin Durant joined that 73 win team, making them literally unbeatable for the last 3 years, which is why the other comment said u didn’t miss much. During goldenstates reign LeBron headed for LA last season where he missed 1/3 of the year so they didn’t make the playoffs. However now LA has Anthony Davis who has emerged as a top 5 player in the world. If u remember Bron in Miami than u probably at least recognize Davis from college ball. The last thing you should know about is a guy called Giannis Antetokounmpo or “The Greek Freak.” I doubt u would know about him since he was the 15th overall pick in 2013 to the Bucks so he didn’t get much media coverage for the first 3 years of his career. However he’s blossomed into the leagues best player at just 25 in my opinion and won league MVP last year. As a 6”11 point forward he’s able to get to the paint at will and scores more unassisted dunks than Shaq. U should watch some of his highlights cuz they’re absolutely insane."
Stephs off ball movement w/ the gravity he carries + the constant threat of Klay being wide open for a 3 is so scary.  Still can't believe they got Kevin fucking Durant. Has there ever been an offense stronger than those 3?
It's good! Kevin Durant from downtown!  AND GOLDEN STATE TAKES THE LEAD!
"While Game 6 Klay is happening Kevin Durant looks around thinking, ""Aight who on this team gonna go off like this?""  He looks to his right and sees an anxious Dion Waiters asking for Russ to give him the ball. KD thinks, ""Nah, this aint it.""  He looks ahead and sees Russ who pulls up for a 3. Its a terrible miss. He says to himself, ""Oh boy, not again.""   In disbelief he turns around to see a young Andre Roberson adjusting his shooting sleeve as he waits to check in.   Kevin whispers to himself under his breath, ""KD can't win a championship with those cats."""
"Hi, i created a Top 100 NBA All Time list a while back, just based off career accomplishments and win share adjustments.

im on my phone you think im goin back to correct every little fucken typo while you ignore the core of what I wrote. what about all the wanda durants of america who work several jobs and go hungry to give their children a chance but they arent fortunate enough to have kevin durant as a son? are they not workin hard enough or what? fuck them I guess lazy sgitheads yeah?
"Kawhi will be one of the weirdest First ballot hall of famers because his career stats aren’t that much but he’s still one of 4 superstars of this decade (Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry). He’s a two-time defensive player of the year, two-time finals MVP but he’s only a 4 time all-star, his career stats aren’t has impressive as Kyrie Irving’s or Kemba Walker’s but he’s way more reliable than both of them or Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Really weird but eh, he’s still my favourite player."
"What are you retarded? He’s one of the biggest basketball players of this era. Jesus, it’s obviously Kevin Durant. God, people ok reddit are SOOO stupid.  /s"
You've combined for the same number of 3s as me and Kevin Durant combined
"Jerry West has 14x All Star, 12x All-NBA, 5x All-Defensive, 1 chip, 1 time scoring leader, 1 time assist leader, averaged 31/6/7 in his best season, and was the ONLY ever player to win Finals MVP while losing the series.  Kevin Durant is not a better all-time player than Jerry West, and he's one of the less credited players in those last few. You're wrong."
Does Kevin Durant have a one sided feud with any active player like Giannis does? Did Kevin Durant make passive aggressive remarks against the competition during his MVP campaign like Giannis did last year? Did Kevin Durant let any one sided feud spill over into a meaningless all star game? Giannis is by far one of the most insecure and fake players in the league and that's despite being a front runner for the MVP this season.
"Only because of the era Steph is playing in. If Reggie or Ray played in this era they'd have just as great or greater 3-pt seasons. Steph is playing in one of the weakest defensive eras ever, not to mention the teammates he's had. Ray/Reggie were *never* flanked by players like Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant."
"To me it's pretty simple.  What Durant did is like if LeBron James left the cavs to go play with Paul Pearce, Kevin garnett, and Ray Allen after losing to them the year before.   Imagine how you and everyone else would have reacted to that. Do you see how it's different from teaming up with two great players to create a brand new team?"
Kevin Durant &amp; Russell Westbrook
Kevin Durant
When Kevin durant is not playing.
I also miss watching Kevin Durant play basketball.
What do you gain when your franchise gains value? Owner becomes richer while you pay more for tickets.   Oh and best FA? Try Kevin Durant lol what a basketball “fan”
"What the fuck hace I just read? A 6'1'' person is not tall for what reason?  Do you realise that the pool of Basketball players is every human being, if 6'1'' is short in Basketball (avg Basketball player is 6'7'') is because height is the most important thing.  Bogues was fucking shit, he is not even in the hall of fame which any bum can get into these days. He was famous because he was an anomaly, a very weird anomaly in Basketball.  It's simple dude, why are there 100 NBA players taller than 6'10'' many of them really fucking good like Giannis, Kevin Durant, Jokic, Anthony Davis, Embiid, etc. And very few 5 footers like 2 now that Isaiah Thomas was kicked out and the 2 are fucking shit.  Remember there are 3 million 5 footers in the world and maybe 30 thousand, at most, humans taller than 6'10''.   Don't avoid the question, I dare you haha"
"Yeah dude, totally [commensurate](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1138439076686602241/pu/vid/1280x720/vOXDnhvf9_ouFVwn.mp4?tag=10) reactions by the two fanbases. Also, since you clearly have picture perfect memory, can you remind if Warriors players had [to tell their fans to stop celebrating the injury of their opponent](https://www.businessinsider.com/raptors-players-kevin-durant-injury-standing-ovation-2019-6) as well?"
so Kevin Durant?
He’s Kevin Durant....he’s not any of these other guys tho
"For now, I'll only do the starters. The 4th quarter between these 2 teams would be legendary.  TEAM GIANNIS ------------------  Kevin Durant  Luka Doncic  Joel Embiid  Steph Curry  TEAM LEBRON -----------------  Anthony Davis  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Kyrie Irving  EDIT: Forgot about Curry!!! He has to be on team Giannis."
"Being tall is the most important thing, and it's not even close. I know it's hard for manlets like you to come into terms with this fact, you never had a fair shot at being good at Basketball, swallow it and keep moving manlet.   There are like 3 billion male 5 footers in the world and just 3 are playing in the NBA, and the 3 of them are shit.  There are like 15 thousand human beings taller than 6'10'', maybe around 10% / 15% are healthy to play Basketball, yet there are like 100 players taller than 6'10'' in the NBA and many of them are great, Giannis Antetokounmpo (MVP), Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant (MVP), Embiid, Jokic, Porzingis (he is like 7'3''), etc.  Being tall is the most important thing you can't go against maths.  You name 5 footers that played the sport 20 years ago when very tall people didn't even know what Basketball was, Joel Embiid started to play Basketball at the age of 16, Giannis at the age of 13, they never played Basketball before until they realised they could make millions by playing it and they could be the best at it just for being very tall.   By the way, the average male American is 5'6'' tall, the average male human being might be around 5'3'' tall.   These NBA players that you mentioned that are palying in the NBA at the moment: Donovan Mitchell (6'1''), Chris Paul (6'0''), Mike Conley (6'1''), Trae Young (6'1)'', Freed Vanvleet (6'0'') are tall dudes.   Isaiah Thomas is quite average sized but he is fucking shit, he had one good season (a fluke) and that's all, he is fucking shit, he can't even defend because he is average-sized.   By the wa, all the 5 footers you mentioned (Mugsy Bogues, Isiah Thomas Spud Webb, Nate Robinson) won 0 NBA championships, in fact I think no 5 footer has ever won an NBA championship (I think you have to go to 50s / 60s to see a 5 footer winning a NBA championship)  If they were huge names it's because the NBA badly needs a manlet as a star, Mugsy Bouges, Isaiah Thomas, Spud Webb and Nate Robinson are all fucking shit, they never won shit."
Can’t wait until the match ups between Kevin Lowry and Kyle Durant next season
"&gt; you're going to give up some easy shots for (JaVale) McGee and (Jordan) Bell and those guys  ah yes  javale mcgee, jordan bell, and kevin durant. the scrubs of the golden state warriors  good one"
Thank god Kevin Durant might draft next year
We all know what’s gonna happen  They’re gonna be waiting for the tip off and Kevin Durant will blindside Trae Young with a chair shot to take his place and he’ll go on to win the Kobe Bryant MVP award.  It’s so predictable
Letting Kevin Durant go to the warriors
HORSE was attempted twice and Kevin Durant won both by spamming threes.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Weekend_H%E2%80%93O%E2%80%93R%E2%80%93S%E2%80%93E_Competition
Ages when FA opens in 2022:  James Harden - 32  Kevin Durant - 33  Stephen Curry - 34  LeBron James - 37  Kawhi Leonard - 31  Paul George - 32  Kyrie Irving - 30  Chris Paul - 37  John Wall - 31  Russell Westbrook - 33  Bradley Beal - 29  Kemba Walker - 32  Jimmy Butler - 32
"Again, you're assuming that it's an intrinsic problem with the position. Lebron James and Kevin Durant happened to be wings. Curry happened to be a guard. That doesn't mean bigs are necessarily incapable of providing the same value."

Kevin Durant. And I hate Kevin Durant.   But as an individual player he is a more athletic Larry Bird.
I want Lil B here singing Fuck Kevin Durant
"Offensive rebound is any time any player from the offense gets a rebound from a missed shot by their own team. For example team A point guard misses but the rebound is gathered by any player from team A. That is an offensive rebound. A defensive rebound is when team A shoots and misses and any player from team B gets the rebound.  Field goals are used for total shooting percentage. Any shot that isn’t a free throw  is considered a field goal. This way you can determine a players shooting percentage in total. The 3 point percentage is a players shooting percentage from only 3 pointers. So essentially you’re looking at how a player shoots from anywhere on the floor either dunk, layup, jump shot, or 3 pointer vs solely 3 pointers.  The game is moving to a more positionless game but you’re correct. In classic terms the point is the passer and offensive captain. He tends to initiate and call plays. Shooting guard or 2 guard is traditionally your best shooter. This is a guy like Kyle Korver or Klay Thompson who can run around and just make any shot if you leave them open. Small forward or the 3 are your combination of a guard and a big. This is your Lebron James or Kevin Durant. They can defend multiple positions and are generally good shooters and also excellent at getting to the rim on offense. Power forwards which are also known as the 4. These guys are like center-lites traditionally. They have a good mid range jump shot and are good rebounders. They are traditionally big men who help stretch the floor. Centers are usually the biggest guy on the floor. They are also called the 5 position. These guys usually play down low in the post and protect the rim from the opposing teams layups and/or dunks. The center has become a pretty versatile position and now includes players who are able to shoot the 3 ball and play down low.  You’re correct about everything else. Not sure how Booker was selected but I’m sure there was a vote between coaches and fan vote and he was the next guy on the list."
"Can’t find the article with the whole list but he asked KD (even after the Achilles) and Beal from what I remember. Maybe Butler as well not quite sure but PG was kind of down the list   &gt; Kevin Durant was getting ready to commit to the Brooklyn Nets, along with his good friends Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan. They'd all grown close in 2016 with the United States Olympic Team and had talked often about playing with one another someday. All that remained was for free agency to officially open on the evening of June 30.  Then Durant got a call from Kawhi Leonard, asking if he'd consider teaming up with him and signing with the LA Clippers. They'd be great complements to each other, Leonard told Durant. He'd always admired him and had tremendous respect for him as a competitor.  Durant was flattered and more than a little stunned, according to sources close to the situation. He didn't know Leonard that well, so getting a recruiting call like that made a real impression."
Of course he had to work at it but that doesn't mean that anyone who decides to pick up the ball can be Kevin Durant.   He's Kevin Durant because he's a guy that 7ft tall that can handle and shoot.   My comment is not to say that professional athletes don't work hard and their talent is everything. It's that they had to work hard ON TOP having these qualities that other pro athletes will simply never have.
"If every 7 footer could develop the dexterity and coordination needed to handle and shoot like Kevin Durant then you would see more people his size with that kind of speed off the dribble.   I'm most certainly not discrediting his hard work. I'm just saying that it takes more than hard work to reach this level and the reality is that the 99.9% of people would never be able to reach it no matter how hard they work.   Hard work can beat talent when talent doesn't work hard enough. But talent will beat hard work if it puts in similar, if not slightly less work."
Kevin Durant or Hakeem
"I think you can just use basketball-reference for this.   Season finder → combined seasons (first to last) → put a minutes limit on it  http://bkref.com/tiny/UJRTC  I went with per 10 minutes just because they don't show more than the tenths digit, you can just divide by 10. Or to fine-tune it more and break the ties you could go per 36 of per 48 minutes.  Looks like with a minimum of 5,000 minutes played, we have:  1. **Michael Jordan** (0.787 points per minute) 2. **Joel Embiid** (0.782 points per minute) 3. **George Gervin** (0.780 points per minute) 4. **Kevin Durant** (0.733 points per minute) 5. **James Harden** (0.730 points per minute) 6. **Freeman Williams** (0.717 points per minute) 7. **LeBron James** (0.704 points per minute) 8. **John Drew** (0.701 points per minute) 9. **Dominique Wilkins** (0.700 points per minute) 10. **Anthony Davis** (0.694 points per minute) 11. **Kobe Bryant** (0.692 points per minute) 12. **David Thompson** (0.691 points per minute) 13. **Jerry West** (0.689 points per minute) 14. **Elgin Baylor** (0.684 points per minute) 15. **Stephen Curry** (0.684 points per minute) 16. **Shaquille O'Neal** (0.682 points per minute) 17. **Bob Pettit** (0.680 points per minute) 18. **Adrian Dantley** (0.679 points per minute) 19. **Walter Davis** (0.676 points per minute) 20. **Alex English** (0.673 points per minute)  Never heard of [Freeman Williams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willifr01.html) before, crazy he's so far up there. Looks like he came in the league, scored a lot of buckets for two seasons mainly, then trailed off and just barely passed the minutes restriction I put on here."
The video of him giving a firm handshake to the one of the coaches and then going straight for the hug handshake with Kevin Durant is one of my favorite vines
Well that team definitely has Kevin Durant so idk about that one.
"Kevin ""Boa"" Durant"
Y’all remember that year Kevin Durant and a couple other players did Horse? That was fun
"[KD should have 5 NBA Scoring Champion titles, but he chose to sit out the last game in the 2012-2013 season. He won it in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014.](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9181534/kevin-durant-sits-finale-carmelo-anthony-wins-nba-scoring-title)"
Kevin Durant! Its like that guy isnt even playing sometimes.
Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant. Neither guy's scored a single point this season
Kevin Durant
"*study long, study wrong...*  ipso facto ;  Kevin Durant is a self important bitch."
"the last line of this article is the biggest media self-suck ive ever seen ""in print"". it happens all the time on TV but rarely in writing.  &amp;#x200B;  ""In the aftermath of the incident, Durant tersely told a reporter to [**stop asking about his relationship with Green**](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/11/16/kevin-durant-on-relationship-with-draymond-green-dont-ask-me-about-that-again-video/). Now, Durant calls it a “huge moment in this whole dynasty.” Occasionally, the media correctly identifies which storylines warrant more attention – even when an involved player pretends otherwise.""  &amp;#x200B;  Like god damn. What the fuck. Just leave it at ""now durant calls it a huge moment"". that last line, was A, editorializing (number 1 no no since this is styled as a ""hard news"" type of piece). and B, it was completely unnecessary. Good media outlets don't need to say SEE WE WERE RIGHT... The work they do should speak for itself...  &amp;#x200B;  rant over sorry, this was an obscene paragraph to read after graduating w/ a journalism degree"
Kevin Durant is so soft. Ain’t no way he’d even DREAM of venmoing me a cool G
Kevin Durant is the most aesthetically pleasing imo. Curry very close second.
"11 players have done it.    [http://bkref.com/tiny/Rtphd](http://bkref.com/tiny/Rtphd)      1. 252 - Brandon Jennings (353 MP) 2. 238 - Shaquille O'Neal (368 MP) 3. 224 - Allen Iverson (377 MP) 4. 221 - Zion Williamson (274 MP) 5. 211 - David Robinson (355 MP) 6. 210 - OJ Mayo (397 MP) 7. 207 - Grant Hill (383 MP) 8. 203 - Paul Pierce (355 MP) 9. 202 - Keith Van Horn (394 MP) 10. 201 - Kevin Durant (346 MP) 11. 200 - Jamal Mashburn (354 MP)  Still pretty elite company, and he did it in by far the least amount of minutes."
F*ck Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"ESPN made it look like meaningless stats by limiting to number 1 picks, but it's quite impressive feat nonetheless. There's only three rookies who have done this since 2000.

Lmao excuses for his finals loses:  1) 1st finals loss a 22 year old LeBron took a bunch of nobodies to the finals (First time for the Cavs)  2) 2015: Loses Kyrie and Kevin Love and takes GSW to 5 with Delly as his second option. 3) Last two finals losses were handed by the 73-9 warriors who added KEVIN DURANT to their team.  He was not favoured in any of the above 4 loses.  The only loss that you can give him slander for us 2011 and he got more than enough.
Kevin Durant is a good floor spacer
"Even then, I think OKC/Memphis would probably be too cordial to arise to true hatred. There would always be respect at the end of the day. Our best path to a real ""would piss on your grave in front of your weeping family"" hated rival is to build a time machine and convince Kevin Durant not to go to the Warriors."
I feel like anyplace he went they’d become contenders. Like it’s Kevin Durant    I would’ve stayed in OKC   They were also gonna get Horford and they just got Dipo.  Like oh shit that’s a squad lmao.  Spurs with Kawhi at the time wins at least a ring or 2.   But let’s say he just wanted to go to a bigger market the Clippers were in good position but it wouldn’t have worked imo. Given that their locker room was so toxic adding Durant might’ve made it even worse lmao.  And Paul’s and Griffin’s injury history would’ve really messed their hopes up   Boston could’ve been a potential ring given how good their FO is and they might still make that Kyrie trade some they would’ve been united earlier.  He didn’t meet with the Lakers he met with Miami as the sixth team.  Give Pat Riley Durant and I think he could’ve won one there as well.  So really anyplace he went he could’ve won and that’s why I don’t understand him going to the Warriors. OKC would’ve definitely been the other best basketball situation
"He was the best player on maybe the best team ever. Nobody is forgetting kevin durant, dont fool yourself."
He didn't need to be the level he is now if they still had Kevin freaking Durant on the team.
Kevin Durant was clearly the best player in the playoffs last year until he got hurt.
It would look a lot like Kevin Durant.
"As far as I'm concerned, the 2018 Rockets and 2019 Rockets are two vastly different teams. The 2018 Rockets had Ariza, who is an actual SF. The 2019 Rockets were idiots and let him go in free agency, meaning they had to run out three guards lineups essentially allowing Kevin Durant (or Draymond Green or Andre Iguodala) to burn them whenever they wanted.  Roster composition is a thing. The 2018 Rockets had the roster composition capable of beating the Warriors. The 2019 Rockets did not."
"The *2018* Rockets had Ariza, an actual small forward that Durant couldn't easily burn. The *2019* Rockets were idiots and let him go, screwing up their roster composition. Ariza is a much better match up on Kevin Durant than Eric Gordon."
Confirmation bias—here were the top-selling jerseys in 18-19:   01. LeBron James  02. Stephen Curry  03. Giannis Antetokounmpo  04. Kyrie Irving  05. Joel Embiid  06. James Harden  07. **Russell Westbrook**  08. Kevin Durant  09. Ben Simmons  10. Jimmy Butler  11. Dwyane Wade  12. Paul George  13. Luka Doncic  14. Damian Lillard  15. Jayson Tatum
"Last summer, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard all left teams that had exactly what you said. All of their teams were succesful, had good coaches, good mangement and great ownership"
Or because he's Kevin fucking Durant lol
"I don't respect Kevin Durant as a person, and I don't enjoy watching his teams play.   &gt; the Nets only chance to win it all this decade  Can you get me the lottery numbers while you're out there predicting the future?"
Didn’t this guy just last week try to hash things with Kevin Durant over petty feuds because of Kobe
"Everyone’s entitled to their opinion...but the Nets only chance to win it all this decade is by way of Kevin Durant returning to the Nets at close to his peak potential. If he leaves or proves to be ineffective, the Nets are going to be in the tank for years to come."
"PG: Jonh Stockton - Who better to get for your superstar team than the all time leader in assists and steals, you're getting a guy who can facilitate and be a key defender all while also being perfectly able to finish himself.  SG: Michael Jordan - With career averages of 30/6/5/2/1 Jordan gives a bit of everything. Scoring, playmaking, defense you name it. And let's be honest, it only makes sense to build the best team around the best player.   SF: Kevin Durant - In the current league you need a guy who can consistently hit 3s. Well Durant is one of the best at that but unlike other adepts at the 3pt shot, he's also arguably the most well rounded scorer of all time. With him being just as effective next to high usage stars like Westbrook and Curry I feel like he won't have a problem taking a backseat to the others when needed.  PF: Kevin Garnett - The second Kevin of the team. He isn't as prolific a scorer as Karl Malone, as good of a shooter as Dirk or as strong defensively as Duncan but he gives you a bit of everything. I don't want to clog the pain with 2 bigs who live there nor do I want my PF to be strictly a perimeter player so KG is the happy middle.  C: Moses Malone - At first I thought about Hakeem to just be secure defensively but with Stockton, Garnett and Jordan the defense is already incredibly strong. I also don't need a scoring center like Kareem or Wilt because there aren't enough touches to go around for that many ball dominant stars. What I want here the all time offensive rebound leader. Averaging over 7 ORB at his peak, in the unlikely case the other 4 stars miss a shot he'll be there to secure the ball. Also no slouch defensively making 2 All-Defense teams and a prolific scorer averaging 20ppg over his career."
"Barkley is 6’6, no ?  My bad Barkley himself admitted being a height liar just like Kevin Durant."

"Oden could be considered BPA though in that draft, he could have been one of the greats. On one hand we never saw Oden's potential pan out since the dude's career was completely stolen by injury, on the other hand there were fears of Durant's lack of strength and physicality.  On nbadraft.net, they listed [Durant's](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/) draft profile as having a lower overall score than [Oden's](https://www.nbadraft.net/players/greg-oden/)"
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson (alternate: Chris Mullin), Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Wilt Chamberlain"
You just naming names?  There is nothing similar.  Big Dog was Kevin Durant before Durant.

&gt; Kevin Durant gonna be texting on those burner accounts. Because he admitted he still does it. The most insecure superstar of all time. No one respects those championships.  Honestly you sound more insecure than KD.
I swear Kevin Durant lives in all head rent free 24/7
"Not trying to argue, but which of these players would you say Barkley was better than:  (I excluded everyone in my own personal Top-10 list, and the following names are not in order, just names that came into my head)  Oscar Robertson  Steph Curry  Karl Malone  John Stockton  Julius Erving  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Durant  David Robinson  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Jerry West  Moses Malone  Dwyane Wade"

"Bro I actually never cared. It’s weird I grew up playing hockey and I always watched the leafs but would never want to just watch a hockey game unless it was deep in the playoffs unless it was the leafs.   When I went to university and started playing basketball and became obsessed with the sport, I’m just a fan of the game overall and particular players rather than which team they play for. Obviously Raptors are my hometown fav team but I didn’t care at all when Kawhi left because I just like the sport of Basketball. I really realized that when Kevin Durant got injured against us, it made me realize how much I truly love the sport when I got almost emotional realizing that I won’t be able to see KD play for a year and he might never come back the same player, realizing how awesome he is to watch when he shot that insane 3 over Kawhi. It’s just such a fun exciting sport to watch, and it’s awesome being a Raptors fan because I love Nick Nurse he’s unbelievable, I love seeing TD’s awesome athleticism, Norman Powell’s smooth 3’s, Lowry’s effort, Ibaka’s passion, Siakam’s rise to superstardom, the list goes on and on."
"It’s Kevin Durant, it’s title or bust"

Yes I can. It’s Kevin Durant.
"Giannis is tied for 4th in NBA endorsement dollars at $20 mil for 2019-2020 (active players), he’s gonna do fine with endorsements regardless of which team he is on.  I combined the data from two recent Forbes articles about [top 10 highest paid players for 2019-2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/10/23/the-nbas-highest-paid-players-2019-20-lebron-james-scores-record-92-million/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2763997863&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrSportsMoneyTwitter#223fcf8bdae6)  (salary+endorsements), and another on [top shoe contracts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/08/28/the-nbas-richest-shoe-deals-lebron-kobe-and-durant-are-still-no-match-for-michael-jordan/#76ff41b03d02), stripped out salary and reordered to get an approximation of how Giannis ranks. (This list doesn't not completely represent endorsement dollars, as the first article combines salary, so some older players who's salary has dipped and still have big endorsements might technically make the list, such as Derrick Rose who makes $11m from shoes).  &amp;#x200B;  1. LeBron James, $55 million ($32m shoes) 2. Stephen Curry, $45 million ($20m shoes) 3. Kevin Durant, $35 million ($26m shoes) 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo, $20 million ($10m shoes) 5.

Damian Lillard, $14 million ($10m shoes) 10. Zion Williamson, $13 million (full amount unknown, only shoes)"
Kevin Durant - in AAU  - 16 was the age we were in...Kevin didn’t have all the handles he had but back then he was like 6-9 with a stroke and fast.   I struggled to guard him moreso because of his length ( I was 6-3 at the time). I had 8 points that game but they weren’t on him.
He's a poor man's Kevin Durant.
"To qualify Khris as a spot-up shooter is just inaccurate. Per [NBA.com](https://NBA.com), his shot profile is 49% pull up jumpers, 25% spot-ups and \~22% paint shots. He shoots almost twice as often off the dribble as he does spotting up. Even from three, he shoots almost as much off the dribble as in spot-up situations (\~16% pull-up, \~20% spot-up) on a very high percentage (39.6% off the dribble from three, 48.1% catch-and-shoot). 46% of his shots are defended either ""tightly"" or ""very tightly"", and less than 40% of his shots go up in under 2 seconds. His shot profile is much more reminiscent of, like, a Kevin Durant than it is a JJ Reddick."
"And they just won a championship with him. That’s like saying adding Kevin Durant to a healthy warriors wouldn’t win, like we just watched them win two straight."
"Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to the Warriors even after their best player was out due to injury. Additionally, Harden was extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws (3rd worst game of this season by FT%) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable.  Now stfu you moron."
KD would have lost to James harden despite  joining a 73 win team   This series made me feel Kevin durant is the most overrated player of all time. Perennial playoff choker in OKC and still needed injury luck to win titles on a 73 win team
"Saying he wasn't special outside of his four year prime, is simply a bad take. He made All NBA eleven times. That's a high level for longer than a four year peak. Even if some were 2nd team, look at 2018-19's All NBA 2nd team, it's good company. Stockton was on this level for over a decade.   **F:** Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors   **F:** Kawhi Leonard, Toronto Raptors   **C:** Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers    **G:** Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers   **G:** Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics   Again, I brought up averages, not totals. So if a player is great and injuries force them to retire early, they can still have a high average. For instance, KD is top 10 in all-time scoring AVERAGE. But in total, he's down at 36th. If he retired today, he would still be 6th all time in NBA scoring AVERAGE. Only five players have done it better. I imagine that average starts decreasing when he returns from injury, but that is beside the point.   Stockton finished top 10 all-time,  in two of the five major statistic categories. And look at all time averaged advanced metrics. VORP, Win shares, defensive win shares, PER. His numbers hold up."
"WS/48 is a near perfect indicator of who should have won MVP in a given year. Based on this among players receiving MVP votes in a given year, the following players should have been MVP while Lebron was in the league.  * 2004 - Kevin Garnett * 2005 - Dirk Nowitzki/Kevin Garnett (tie) * 2006 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2007 - Dirk Nowitzki * 2008 - Chris Paul * 2009 - Lebron James * 2010 - Lebron James * 2011 - Lebron James * 2012 - Lebron James * 2013 - Lebron James * 2014 - Kevin Durant * 2015 - Stephen Curry * 2016 - Stephen Curry * 2017 - Kevin Durant (or Kawhi Leonard if you dismiss Durant for missing too many games). * 2018 - James Harden  * 2019 -  Giannis Antekoumpo  Long story short, Lebron probably should have won Rose’s MVP, he was the best player and lost because the Heat were the hyped team and didn’t finish as the 1 seed. There are no other years Lebron should really hold claim to, although he had some solid second place finishes.  James Harden, another guy people whine about not winning multiple MVP only really deserved it the one year. Westbrook shouldn’t have won his, but Kawhi probably should have won that one for leading a 60+ win Spurs team.  Dirk got jobbed by Nash harder than any other player has gotten jobbed for MVPs, and Chris Paul lost out on his MVP to the Kobe Bryant career achievement award."
"Kevin Durant  Worst for chemistry, best for entertainment."
“Sometimes there is nothing you can do and the better team wins it and the warriors were the better team this year. If it wasn’t for Klay’s injury they could’ve beaten the Raptors and won a championship without Kevin Durant. They were a championship caliber team with or without Kevin Durant there is no shaming and losing to them.” That is a very pro rocket anti-warrior take
I feel like we don’t talk about Thunderstruck enough.. Kevin Durant stars in a Freaky Friday movie switching basketball skills with a 16 year old white kid. How has he gotten a free pass for this?
Can someone explain how the 73-9 Warriors won 6 less games after they added Kevin Durant in the following season? /s
"""0% of the league is better than what a post surgery oladipo put up in 13 games this year."" Not facts.  90% of the league posted below either didn't play, played 5 mins, or averaged less than 40% of the game.  Not facts.  You can ride the bench and still be more productive than 20% of the bench players.  Why?  Because some players productions are net negatives.  And as we are speaking about Oladipo's current abilities and not him on his ass, it's fair to say your Donald Trump 180 didn't work this time.  Dude is hurt, dude on the bench is still better than 10% of the league, and we're talking about their abilities as a player.  Let's stay on topic here.    ""Players don't shoot up for one year at 25 then two years later at 27 be a tenth of the player they were before."" I never said they're a 10th of the player they are.  I said that their 24ppg is an anomoly, and he's more of a 19-21ppg on 43% shooting type of player, which is a fair assumption since he's always been that player his career.  So yes, many players do peak at 25, even 22 and never get better.  That's why they call it peak and everybody peaks differently.      ""No. What is flawed is to pretend like 13 games of oladipo coming off of a knee surgery means anything."" Yes, but notice how we focused on his entire career, including recent stats and abilities while acknowledging recent injuries, one season of 24ppg, and his abilities as a player.  So far you keep comparing him to Kevin Durant, Nurkic, Paul George and probably even Brandon Roy.  He's not a superstar.  His skill level was never nearly as good as theirs.  His shot isn't as clean.  He's not nearly as gifted athletically.  But he can still average 19pg.  Let's not be fooled, Oladipo is not a great player.    ""Seriously, who cares if a player is better than another player that's injured."" I don't, but my personality is one that loves to engage through debates, discussions.  When I see an opportunity to jump on the illogicals, you best believe my ass will do so.  And when I see I've riled up some panties, I fucking love it.  People are too soft with their words like KD.    ""SGA is better than Oladipo returning after a serious knee surgery. Now how about he tries being better than Oladipo when he isn't hurt?"" Oladipo has had the best season so far.  Better player?  It can very well go to Shai."
"I'm sorry, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving were both good. I don't buy this argument.   Are you gonna sit there and tell me they're worse than Westbrook and Harden? Thompson and Green? Idk, they won a bunch of games, I think it's clear they worse than Harden and Westbrook but that's the benefit of hindsight. The one finals they're healthy, they do win. So there's that. Maybe Lebron would've won 2015 but I think the only thing given is even if he had both Irving and Love, they lose to the Durant Warriors. Only it's closer."
"&gt;90% of the league isn't better than Oladipo or SGA.  90% of the league is better than what a post surgery oladipo put up in 13 games this year. Which is why it's dumb to compare anyone to what he did this year. Dude is hurt.  &gt;Isn't the opposite true as well? A player to average one season at 24 regresses back to 18.8, 42%, 34%, 104 Ortg, or as we say back to the standard deviation as this has statistically been his career norm? This is a common thing in careers, that's why they call it peak.  No, no it's not. It absolutely is not common. Not even a little bit. Players don't shoot up for one year at 25 then two years later at 27 be a tenth of the player they were before. That's extremely rare without some sort of reason, the most common of which is injury.  Why are you ignoring **that he is injured and thus reading into his stats for this season is meaningless**  &gt;""look at Oladipo's history but not SGA""  No. What *is* flawed is to pretend like 13 games of oladipo coming off of a knee surgery means anything.  &gt;This part is true, however are we forgetting that a statistical increase is more likely to happen at 22 than 27, especially after an injury? Or that players tend to get better after their second season in the NBA (standard of deviation)? The peak age of an NBA career is 26-31, with 29-31 usually only reserved for certain players.  Man, why did you take any of that seriously? I was using your own words back at you because your arguments are ridiculous.  &gt;Based on the current conditions, I'm comfortable where saying Shai is the better player.   Based on the current conditions, I'm comfortable saying Markelle fultz is better than Kevin Durant  Nurkic broke his leg March 25 2019. Based on the conditions at that time, I'm comfortable saying that I was a better better basketball player on march 26 2019 than Nurkic was.  Seriously, who cares if a player is better than another player that's injured.   Congrats man. SGA is better than Oladipo returning after a serious knee surgery. Now how about he tries being better than Oladipo when he isn't hurt?"
"Maybe it's out of context, like I don't remember how Durant was playing that game. But maybe pass him the ball? It's fucking Kevin Durant"
Anything can be argued. I could argue that my 3 year old knows more about basketball than you if you really think Green was more valuable to the Warriors than Curry and Durant. There’s a reason they lost to the Cavs in 2016 (Green playing his absolute best in game 7 couldn’t save them) but then beat them 8-1 the following 2 finals with Durant. Durant also won FMVP both times for the same reason. It’s because he’s Kevin Durant and Kevin Durant is so much better at basketball than Draymond Green it’s just ridiculous to compare them. If you changed your argument to 3rd most important player over Klay then I still wouldn’t agree but it would at least be a somewhat reasonable take.
Kevin Durant was 24 when Jordan said this
"Who is better right now? Markelle fultz or Kevin Durant?  Kevin Durant averaged 0/0/0 on 0% TS% this season.   Fultz: 12/3/5 on 52% TS%.   Fultz leads Durant by **52%** TS%. That's enormous.   At this point in time, markelle fultz is better than Kevin Durant.   Man you know why. Because oladipo played 13 fucking games and was injured. Congrats. SGA is better than a player who missed 70 games due to surgery. I'm proud of him  The last time oladipo was healthy, he was significantly better than SGA  Edit: also man, if you're using WS for a dude that played 13 games and comparing it to someone that played a full season, then you have no idea how to use advanced stats"
Kevin Durant would kill it in any era.
"Who I'd award MVP by season since Jordan:  2019-20: 1st Giannis, 2nd LeBron, 3rd Harden  2018-19: James Harden (actually Giannis)  2017-18: LeBron James (actually James Harden)  2016-17: James Harden (actually Russell Westbrook)  2015-16: Stephen Curry  2014-15: Russell Westbrook (actually Stephen Curry)  2013-14: Kevin Durant  2012-13: Carmelo Anthony (actually LeBron James)  2011-12: LeBron James  2010-11: LeBron James (actually Derrick Rose)  2009-10: LeBron James  2008-09: Kobe Bryant (actually LeBron James)  2007-08: Kobe Bryant  2006-07: Kobe Bryant (actually Dirk Nowitzki)  2005-06: Kobe Bryant (actually Steve Nash)  2004-05: Allen Iverson (actually Steve Nash)  2003-04: Tracy McGrady (actually Kevin Garnett)  2002-03: Kobe Bryant (actually Tim Duncan)  2001-02: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Tim Duncan)  2000-01: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Allen Iverson)  1999-00: Shaquille O'Neal  1998-99: Shaquille O'Neal (actually Karl Malone)  Bonus: Michael Jordan 1996-97 (actually Karl Malone)"
Remember in the NBA FINALS when the Cavs were giving KEVIN DURANT wide open looks because Curry attracted so much attention?
Facts. That warriors team without Kevin durant doesn’t even deserve to be in the finals tbh.   Shoulda been a raptors vs rockets finals
"I mean, it's not exactly like Kevin Durant is the most athletic looking guy either.   [https://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported\_assets/354614/83586688\_medium\_medium.jpg](https://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/354614/83586688_medium_medium.jpg)  [https://i.pinimg.com/474x/60/ae/b8/60aeb89b4f31e33af6c297d84fb1f17b.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/60/ae/b8/60aeb89b4f31e33af6c297d84fb1f17b.jpg)  Looks can be deceiving."
"AI's shot distribution was not pretty similar to Kobe.  Here is AI's distribution and percentages: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/iversal01.html#all_shooting  Here is Kobe's: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html#all_shooting  And for reference here is Westbrook's: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html#all_shooting  AI's distribution and percentages are much closer to Russ than Kobe.   &gt; If the Thunder hadn't just hoarded athletic wings who can't shoot for shit, and actually fielded some decent floor-spacers maybe we could have seen this version of Westbrook earlier  You have to also remember that Russ was playing next to Kevin Durant and now James Harden for much of his career, it's not a given that he would be more efficient as the lone star on his team with more floor spacers.  &gt; He's a career 60% shooter from 0-3ft, I'm surprised it took the Rockets that long to realize that getting Westbrook attacking the basket was a better outcome than letting him jack up 5 3s a game.  Because playing with a 6'6 or smaller player as your center for the entire  game is completely unprecedented"
That would be Kevin Durant
Altered? I’m not saying that they want them to call the wrong way on fouls or miss Kevin Durant blatantly stepping out of bounds trying to save the ball...  I’m saying they don’t want ejections for the refs getting cussed out. Casual fans do not give a shit about that and would much prefer to see the Hampton-5 on the court.
"Is there a right or wrong answer? You have Russell Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard and Steph Curry but you also have Harrison Barnes. Then there's Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis, and Kevin Durant.  I heard Richard Jefferson talk about how you mature as a player and as a person if you stay longer in college, but I'm not sure that's a guarantee too."
"He’s definitely not satisfied, When he won his championships I didn’t see that same excitement like other NBA stars, Kawhi shows no emotion but when he won he screamed, We remember those iconic moments when an NBA Star wins a ring, Lebron crying, Kobe and Shaq hugging, Dirk going to the locker room. I didn’t see that excitement from KD. There was barely any competition against that team when the season started fans knew they were champions, I think he regrets joining the warriors imo, I think because the media, fans and organization didn’t treat him like he wanted to be treated. He thought the city would love him but instead they showed that love to curry, green and Thompson, but that’s fair they’re the guys that were there longer and won a championship without Kevin Durant"
"&gt;""We triumph without glory when we conquer without danger.""  Kevin Durant experimented with this proverb after his two titles with the Warriors."
"Draymond Green is very lucid in this exchange. He's absolutely right. If Kevin Durant had pressured the Warriors leadership to say it's Draymond or me, the leadership would have kept it.  Kevin Durant just didn't want to stay at Golden State."
"Kevin Durant took the easy way out by going to the Warriors.  He earned his two NBA Finals MVP titles, but he couldn't really claim to be considered the best player in the world after that.  If he had earned those MVP titles by staying at OKC, he would have earned this honorary title.  But after seeing the 2017 and 2018 NBA finals, everyone still felt that LeBron was the best player but Kevin Durant had better players around him.  So he didn't get the credit he had hoped for."
"You’re a clown honestly, you act like dudes were brawling every play. KD would embarrass every dude that even attempted to guard him. Dudes like Jeff hornacek were above average, but Kevin fucking Durant and Wade couldn’t handle it? Dumbest thing I’ve ever heard."
Yea they got owned. Kevin Durant was too good.
Kevin Durant was present
Kevin Durant probably is though lol
Do you not understand how basketball is played? The best player on the best team is not always the best player in the NBA. Kevin Durant was the best player on the best team but LeBron was still the best player in the NBA.
&gt; Kevin Durant will return to near 100% like Dominique Wilkins' Achilles injury  Dominique Wilkins totally re-worked his game after his Achilles tear.
"I loved that he said something like ""i was the only one that could shoot on that team"" yet had worse 3 point percentages in the 2016 playoffs compared to Ibaka, Waiters, Russ, Morrow, ROBERSON, and even Foye. He shot worse than ROBERSON from 3 and still said that....  Edit: since i know yall nephews wont use google: https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/02/10/kevin-durant-was-one-of-the-worst-3pts-shooters-for-the-2015-16-okc-and-he-said-he-left-oklahoma-because-no-one-could-shoot-3s/"
Kevin “Chris Jericho” Durant
"Never said it wasn't fair and you're free to feel how you want.   I'm just saying it wasn't viewed the same as other rings for most.  KD himself said winning didn't fill the void. Likely because he knows it was too easy.  The analogy I like is if I'm playing a video game but have to turn down the difficulty, I don't feel accomplished even though I ""won"". There is a satisfaction with winning when things are difficult.  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/"

Brandon “Kevin “Slim Reaper” Durant” Ingram
"It took the worst shooting night in nba history to beat the rockets, if okc was 1 year older/ more mature they would’ve won in 5. 2016 went how it went.   It’s not just a points thing man, that warriors team with Kevin Durant is only a playoff team."
"The only season Draymond was ahead of Curry in on/off was 2016, where they both are the top 2 all-time in +/- that year, and played almost identical minutes staggered together  Curry:  2019: +16.2  2018: +12.2  2017: +17.2  2016: +22.6  2015: +18.1  2014: +15.2  Draymond:  2019: +7.8  2018: +1.3  2017: +11.3  2016: +26.3  2015: +14.5  2014: -0.1  And for fun, here's Kevin Durant:  2019: +16.1  2018: +1.9  2017: +8.6  2016: +12.5  2015 (injured most of year): +8.8  2014: +6.0  Klay:  2019: +0.4  2018: +4.0  2017: +8.2  2016: +12.7  2015: +12.3  2014: +15.6"
"Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant"
"You totally moved the goalposts.   &gt; To play Devil's Advocate, KD was the better than LeBron if you define better as **which player is most adept at winning playoff games.**  &gt; ...Because his game has no weaknesses and he is the best playoff scorer and closer. He's the best closer because **his shot can't be blocked and he has the handles and shot to shoot anywhere he wants to.**  First you start out talking about winning playoff games, then when I bring up that he joined an elite team that he couldn't beat in order to win said playoff games, you switch to talking about his abilities and then say I ignore his game. lol  So the alternative is throwing all context out the window? We're talking about the best players in the world. If you're going to talk about winning playoff games, what team they play on is a factor. Kevin Durant joined a team with 3 other All-Stars coming off two Finals runs, so when they consequently win the championship, that makes him the best player?  As for your new argument, I can point to the team he played on again. The best closer, right? Easy to close when the opponent is worried about Steph and Klay. Where was this closing ability in OKC? I'll say again, the team you play on is a factor.  Kevin Durant is great. I'm not discounting his abilities. But you can't honestly consider him to be a better player than LeBron after those Finals, and him expecting credit for winning a championship that by all accounts was a foregone conclusion is the height of delusion."
Kevin Durant
"&gt; It was only like that because KD didn't run up.   klay was behind Draymond, while Looney was next to him. Iggy was thr only one in front. unless you have the numbers game, running a fastbreak is not the best option. This is why you see players dribble back out and wait for his teammates to get back if there is more opposing players on the fast break. this was a 5 on 3(at best) fast break, with 3 people on draymond. Plus there is no time on the clock so he can't stop and try to set a play. So please tell me how this is better than a pull up 3 from KD? Also a Draymond fastbreak is not better than Kevin fucking Durant ISO"
"I get that. I think the events and experiences surrounding their decisions directly effects their mindset and mentality however as this isn’t just black and white. Lebron went from carrying a team to the best record in the east with players not near the same talent level as him. Mind you he’s been doing it for a while, and decides to join a team worse than his to join two friends(one who he’d been planning on teaming up with). Kevin Durant literally just lost to that team and had a fair chance to beat them. Hasn’t had any close interactions or intentions to play with these guys it seems and decides to join quite literally the greatest regular season team ever. I get where you’re coming from saying “they both just wanted to win” but forming and creating a team is different than joining an already formed team, and the mindset it takes to do that to me is what separates them. If reversed I don’t see Lebron doing the same thing if he had just gotten smacked by D-Wade."
Was Kevin Durant gonna come back for that game too? Or was Kevin Loonie gonna be the difference maker
"It wasn't gutted, so much as it was replaced. They kept 5/6 most played players and replaced the other (Barnes) with Kevin Durant. The decision was not a decision at all and very obvious. Those other guys can be subbed out for others without much difficulty (Zaza replaces Bogut, Clark elevated role to replace Barbosa, McCaw replaces Rush, West replaces Speights, McGee replaces Ezeli)"
"You guys are so fucking funny.   &gt;Warriors forward Kevin Durant told ESPN that the reason for his ejection uptick this season is due to a burning desire to repeat as an NBA champion.  &gt;""It's just my emotions and passion for the game,"" Durant said after Friday's practice session. ""After winning that championship (last season), I learned that much hadn't changed. **I thought it would fill a certain [void].** It didn't. That's when I realized in the off-season that the only thing that matters is this game and how much you put into it. Everything else off the court, social media, perception, isn't important. What people say, how they view you, it's not important.   Dude is saying he's not going to get complacent and still wants to win as much as before and you armchair psychologists are talking about him being mentally weak.  &gt;""What we did as a team was special, and I want to experience that again. My love and passion for the game has [blossomed] because I understand that's what it's all about, and I'm pouring all of this [newfound thirst] into this game. But I know I have to keep [my fire] under control, and I will."""
"Looney who played in 5 whole games in 2015-16 for a grand total of 21 minutes on the seaosn was one of their top bench players?  Please let's stop making things up.  The Warriors replaced their #4, #7, #8, #9, #10 and #11 players in terms of minutes played from the 2015-16 season. Obviously it was worth it to get Kevin 'effin Durant."
"Just cause people said they were a fraud doesn’t make them not an all time great team. Kevin Durant joined a team with the top 2 shooters of ALL TIME and two of the most versatile defenders of all time... iggy was starting quality player but choose to come off the bench for kerr. That warriors team was stacked, choking a 3-1 lead has more to do with mentality not talent"
"Gutted?  They replaced Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant and kept their three of their top 5 bench players: Iguodala, Livingston, and Looney.  Please."
So you think those are improbable for a team that instead landed Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant doesn't have a fanbase as large as LeBron does.   But the typical other responses are that Lebron didn't join an established team like KD did. Honestly if the Warriors were like a 60 win team I don't think people would care so much. the 73 win team getting a top 3 player is what pissed people off.
"whatever the reasons ultimately were, durant deciding to remove himself from the situation instead did green a favour  kevin durant could go to any franchise in the nba &amp; still be kevin fucking durant  someone like draymond green could not"
"There was a report that KD and Kyrie decided to team up the summer before the season. Based on the general behavior of him and others around the organization and the behind the scenes moves that were reported, I find it almost impossible to believe he hadn't decided to leave before the season started. I remember Bob Myers said after the second championship that the first season with KD was like a honeymoon, but the second season was like a marriage. I remember Kerr talking about worrying that he was losing KD in the middle of the second season. Hell, I remember in the third quarter of Game 1 of the 2018 WCF when KD was rolling and Kerr subbed KD out and KD was visibly heated for a few minutes (I know players get annoyed at that stuff all the time but it did seem to me like KD was mad for longer than players would usually be mad for). Not to mention all the one year deals suggest he was considering his next stop quite a bit.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843699-inside-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irvings-plot-to-team-up-in-brooklyn"
"*""I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am.""* - Kevin Durant, 2019"
"Lol I know what you mean. I'm not one of those guys but i know guys who go to the barbershop every single week just for a line up or to keep it looking the exact same. I was getting a cut like once a month because I'm not trying to have haircuts become a bill. That's at least $80 a month in cuts. Too much for me. Some guys have a lot of facial hair and go for that reason too. Also, black hair comes in all different grades of coarseness, curlyness, wavyness, thickness, etc. Luckily I have a grade of hair that looks good for a while even when it gets longer.

"Kevin Durant has to be the most pathetic superstar of all time lmao. So he didn't get immense praise for:   \- Winning championships next to Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green   \- Putting up monstrous stats next to them    \- Leaving the team he blew a 3-1 lead with and joining the 73-9 team they lost to (definition of chickenshit)   and then cried and whined about it?"
"The comment could have just as easily said “Blake Griffin, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green are all in their 30s.”  All of those dudes play with a different level of flash and seeming intensity than Duncan ever had even at 26.   Yet no one sees Blake Griffin and thinks “old man game.”"
"Steph Curry and Kevin Durant limit Draymond's touches lol, if you had ""at least average IQ"" you wouldn't even use that as an argument. The Warriors run a movement based scheme that essentially limit how much any one player is directly responsible for creating shots, rather, they use a lot of off ball movement and extra passes. The more people you have passing the ball the less assists any one person would have (this should be basic fucking logic).  It makes a lot of sense that you don't read btw. If you did maybe you wouldn't be using the same types of arguments that I'd expect a Skip Bayless or Colin Cowherd to use. For all this ""above average IQ"" or ""knowledgeable about basketball"" talk you sure use a *ton* of sensationalist points. I guess you wouldn't be able to argue without those though.  Funny how you know so little but act like you know so much."
"Are you sure you watch basketball?  Lets name all the amazing passers who average between the 7-8 assist range just this year: Nikola Jokic, Ben Simmons, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. LeBron James for most of his career didn't average over 8 assists per game.  Also, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry both took the ball out of Draymonds hands a lot, and each handled creation duties a lot in case you didn't know.  All the arguments you make are borderline nonsensical. Not once have you used relevant statistics, not once have you vocalized an observation about Draymond's abilities, not once have you explained to me why you think Draymond is a bad passer or is a low IQ player. Just saying ""BuT thE TeCHnIcaL FoULs"" isn't enough. I've provided you evidence of his ability to read the court and anticipate plays before they unfold and you covered your eyes. I've given you resources from a person who's worked for NBA teams and has had years of experience as a statistician and you've just said ""he knows nothing"" without even listening to what he has to say. I've given you advanced statistics and On/Off numbers that you've ignored. I've refuted your claims with reasoning that you've also just elected to ignore. And you continue to just use counting stats as ways to tell whether or not a player is good. Hell you've chosen to go after my phrasing before actually combating some of the points I'm making.  Listen dude I don't know how you think you're winning when your talking points include: Sensationalist bits like those techs, basic box score numbers like points and assists, irrelevant points about how Draymond can't elevate a trash team to mediocre heights, and my phrasing.  Ooh I'm just getting hammered with all these cerebral points you're making. Dude you've lost hours ago, give it up, it's embarrassing to see you claw at almost random arguments that barely even relate to what I'm saying, much less refute it. I mean using technical fouls as a way to try and refute my points about Draymond's feel for the game? Come on man."
"I think he's as great a passer as many of the Spurs role player bigs on those championship teams--a boris diaw.  If he were that great a facilitator it wouldnt translate to the worst record in the league.  I think having Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson to pass to is a big part of that.  His shooting has fallen off a cliff.  If he were really a legitimately good offensive player he should be able to score at least high teens on the team he is on where they need scoring.  Everything about his play, now that he isn't surrounded by superstar/hall of famers is unremarkable.  That reeks of someone who is more of an overachieving roleplayer.  Not an allstar...let alone superstar.  Role players are really important like Rick Fox and Mario Chalmers.  It reminds me alot of when Mario Chalmers used to claim he was a top 5 point guard in the league."
"Comparing 1st Miami team to the warriors team with Kevin Durant not even fair lol. LeBron had a great team but the warriors had a super team. Steph and KD are both mvps ,won 73 game, have chemistry, won a championship and have experience to win it all... I could go on and on."
https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/steve-kerr-told-michael-jordan-bulls-story-give-advice-kevin-durant   I’ll always maintain my opinion that 2017 Warriors were as great as they were in the playoffs because KD got injured before playoffs and couldn’t come back iso-ing after Warriors had a crazy winning streak with Curry-led offense.
People did not hate gsw that much lol you always get hate when you a top basketball team. They were all living in harmony but everything changed when kevin durant joined.
Kevin Durant shot horribly vs the Dallas Mavericks in the year 2011. Mavericks made Lebron into a passer and locked him up in the paint and Kobe got thrown into a prison cell that year also.  They were an all time defensive team my guy.
I would love to see the least vs. Most dense players go head to head. Peak donut tractor traylor vs shaun bradley for instance.  Shawn kemp vs. Kevin durant at the 4. Etc
"What do you say about this team:  1995 John Stockton  2017 Klay Thompson  2018 Kevin Durant  1998 Dennis Rodman  2018 Joel Embiid  Does this look like the best team you can assemble without it looking like OP-cheating? You've got assisting, shooting, scoring, rebounding and post domination without a single top 10 player of all time in there. I think it would win the title in its prime every time."
I wish Kevin Durant actually posted this.

Kevin Durant.
"I'd argue that ball-handler defense is more valuable than certain kinds of wing defense, but it's also much much rarer than equivalently good wing defense. The ability to keep the likes of Steph Curry or James Harden out of their zone is rare and invaluable. A defender who is too good to be easily beaten off the dribble will force the offense to go through other offensive actions to get a good shot, whereas a defender who can be beaten initially will force the defense into reacting to prevent a good shot. In general, bigger players have more natural advantages on defense and less selective pressure to be good on offense, so smaller players will tend to be more skilled and more able to run an offense, whereas larger players will usually have better defense. This is reflected in stats like ORPM and DRPM.  For specific systems, a lack of point guard defense is not a death sentence, but multiple bad defenders in adjacent positions usually spells trouble. Having a Klay Thompson to cover for Curry is good, since it usually requires at least one offensive action to have a favorable matchup, but if you have a Lillard and a McCollum, then your whole backcourt is in danger from the get-go.  A hole on the wing can often be adequately filled by someone a position up or down, since wings nowadays tend to be fairly interchangeable. You will rarely have all your wings guarding high-priority offensive players. Even the Super Warriors had Iguodala and Draymond Green on the floor, and defenses could take advantage of that by sticking a questionable defender or wandering help defense on them.  The danger in one-way play is that it tends to open up the floor greatly against smart gameplans. The ability to turn the game into a 5 on 4 on either side of the court is huge. Giving a player the Ben Simmons treatment gives you a free roaming defender, which is huge. Knowing that the opposing guard has James Harden off-ball awareness means you can run plays practically guaranteed to get an open shot for their man. The thing about wings is that even relatively bad defensive wings tend to be better on defense than many guards, just because they're big and fast. Kevin Durant isn't a good defender because he has the best defensive instincts, he's good because he's built like Gumby with extendo-arms. Chris Paul is a good defender mostly because he's quick, smart, has 110% awareness, and plays as dirty as is legal. Because of these natural size advantages, guards tend to be worse on defense than wings in an absolute sense, even if they have more of the intangibles. Bigger players are inherently better at being two-way players, and therefore it's less of a problem to be relatively bad on defense as a wing.  Bad guard defense is common because of size, but it's ridiculous to say it's not valuable. And also, some of these bad defensive guards may be better at team defense than they appear. The ability to get out of the way of the play is an underrated ability of Steph Curry's - the system he plays in has him do off-ball switches to stay away from the next pick and roll, so it doesn't have to involve his individual defense. Trae's terrible individual defense will probably work out for him if he keeps putting up big numbers, like Nash. However, decent individual and/or team defense is what he will need to not be exposed in a playoff series."
Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant are the ultimate Spur killers.
"Well players used to be allowed to declare straight from high school and Kevin Garnett was kind of the trendsetter in that regard (although Moses Malone did the same in the 70s but with the ABA not NBA) and that ushered in that whole era. Once the NBA changed the rule on that, the one and done era started. I guess the first freshman who wouldn’t have had a chance to declare the previous year was Tyrus Thomas (4th overall pick) but the first truly notable ones would have been Greg Oden and Kevin Durant the following year."
"They didn’t have anyone to stop durant. That’s why they lost. With or without Cp3 even though he did make a huge difference in that series. And I would’ve loved to see the warriors lose believe me. When they were in their prime I hated them. But looking back on it, there’s no way they were losing. The Pippen thing you said tho is interesting. Cause defense was his thing, it’s just hard to speculate when Kevin Durant is probably the most unfair scoring machine in NBA history. I mean damn near 7 feet and can shoot from anywhere? That’s hard to stop no matter what decade it is. I think maybe the Warriors best chance to stop Jordan tho was maybe Iguadala? But let’s be honest there not really a defender we’ve seen that COULD stop Jordan"
Rodman cannot guard Kevin Durant. No one can.
"Kevin Durant, now he's on the Cavs and that completely shuts down any scoring he'd do for the Warriors."

"Lebron going to Cleveland would have been like Kevin Durant going to Phoenix except worse. Ayton is better than Wiggins, and Devin Booker might play the scorer role better than Kyrie. Except the suns have better pieces in my opinion. If you were to say going to the Suns was his best option I would laugh. And Cleveland was probably a worse situation that theirs. Although I think the Suns could make the playoffs next year and have some really solid young pieces. I could not say that Cavs team would make the playoffs in a weak East without LeBron."
Kevin Durant maybe?
"1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry  4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. James Harden  6. Kawhi Leonard  7. Damian Lillard  8. Anthony Davis  9. Luka Doncic   Struggling to find a 10th, with the only arguable one being one of Simmons, Embiid or Trae."
"Kevin Durant cost Lebron those rings not Steph, Steph only has one win against Lebron without KD and that was when the whole Cavs teams was crippled and Lebron had a bad back, they still went 6 games."
I think Draymond was a bit more important in their first title run than injured OKC player Kevin Durant
&gt; but when they added Kevin Durant they became the greatest team ever. Let’s be honest. No team could beat them with KD  Maybe this was before you became a fan but I'm PRETTTTY sure Kevin Durant was on your team when the Rockets took you to 7.
"Wait games are only 44 minutes now?  Man I've really not been watching.  &gt; Just use common sense. If Westbrook plays literally every game, all game, his efficiency and +/- are going to dip.  Iverson played about 190 minutes  more (2975 to 2788).  Which isn't a huge gap.  I'm not looking at just this.  I'm looking at this and the 4 years before it that you keep ignoring entirely because Kevin Durant was even on the roster even though when he was on the bench the OKC offense was still a +7.  Like, Stockton and Malone played together their entire career and both were great, Durant played with Curry and both were great, but somehow only Durant gets credit even when he's not on court.  Ignoring everything that goes against what you're saying is certainly quite a hill you've built.  Basically the argument goes:  Westbrook's career prior to 2017 doesn't count because he played with another star, and the numbers when that star wasn't on court with him don't count because reasons.  But the last 2 years count because I want them to."
"Yes, but when they added Kevin Durant they became the greatest team ever. Let’s be honest. No team could beat them with KD"
Sorry but I'm putting Kevin Durant over every player you named other than maybe Magic (who was aging)
What do they expect he's Kevin fucking Durant
"In the 12 years of his career before the shutdown, Kevin Durant was unguardable"
"Micheal Beasley on the record loved that move:  ""Finally he's going to start pleasing himself instead of pleasing other people.""  Kevin Durant in the beginning was simply enamored with how the system worked at Golden State.  They were playing high level ball, chemistry was at an all time high, there was now either a current or past all star player at every position.  The team was stacked.  This is the kind of work environment where everyone you work with you respect.  This is the definition of professional success."
"So this'll be long but basically it's like this. There are 30 teams and each plays 82 games in the regular season. 15 of those teams are in the western conference, 15 are in the eastern conference. Teams play the teams in their conference 4 times a year, and the teams in the other conference 2 times a year.  At the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference are seeded into a playoff bracket based on their w/l record. Playoff series are best of 7 games. Whoever wins the playoffs wins the NBA championship. Right now, we would normally be in the playoffs, but it's been suspended/cancelled for obvious reasons.  Now for the game itself. The most basic rules are simple, and you probably know them already. Putting the ball through the basket gives your team 2 points, except if you shoot it from behind the 3-point line (also called the arc, the perimeter, and a couple other names) which gets you 3 points instead. You need to dribble to run with the ball. Each possession has a 24 second shot clock, which means that once a team gets possession of the ball, they have 24 seconds to make a shot or they lose possession. If you get fouled, you get to shoot undisturbed from the free throw line, and each made shot from there gets you one point (some fouls though just turn over possession to the other team but you'll figure out details like that as you go). There are a lot of other rules but that's what you need to know for now.  There are five positions in basketball (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center), but generally speaking this can be simplified to three types of players: guards, wings, and bigs. Below I'll describe in broad strokes what each kind of player does, but there are dozens of exceptions, so don't be surprised when you notice a player that's not conforming to the positions and playstyles I describe.  Guards are the smallest (and often quickest) players, and they have the ball in their hands the most. Their best skills are often (but not always) playmaking, passing, and shooting. They most often operate around the perimeter (3-point line), setting up plays for their teammates and either passing the ball to a wing or big for a 2-point shot or getting open for a 3-point shot. Guards are usually 6""0-6""6. Examples include Steph Curry, Devin Booker, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  Wings are bigger players usually with longer wingspans. They set themselves up to receive the ball from guards closer to the basket, but are usually also good at shooting from beyond the three-point line if need be. They're typically stronger players that work to position themselves in such a way where they can get easy shots. Wings are usually 6""5-6""10. Examples include Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.  Bigs are, as the name implies, the biggest and strongest (but usually the slowest) players. They traditionally play close to the basket, receiving entry passes and brute forcing close shots. Their size also makes them the most important players on defense (again, broadly speaking), since they're hard to shoot over and harder to overpower. They're also very good at getting rebounds, which is when a missed shot bounces off the rim and is collected by either team to gain or regain posession. Examples include Joel Embiid, Karl Anthony-Towns, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.  I think that's all the info you need to get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need help picking a team or something. I can also help out if you have any questions about the playstyle of a team you're interested in or want to know more about a specific player. Happy to help"

Even if Durant is insecure a solution isn’t just “hey Kevin stop being insecure”. Draymond green knows Durant’s personality better then we ever could since he’s his teammate. And his way to address a problem or Durant’s ‘insecurities’ is to call him a bitch mid game and tell him the team doesn’t need him?  Sounds like Draymond made a mole hill a mountain of Kevin’s ‘insecurities’ with that one simple line.
"&gt; The facts we know for certain. Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had conflict, Kevin Durant felt isolated from the Warriors, and Kevin Durant left.  Yep, I agree with the facts, but to me it doesn't necessarily indicate that KD was to be blamed for anything in particular. Disagreements happen. That team was supposed to win championships and they did, and only stopped doing so when they were hit by injuries.  KD even left in a positive way by helping with the sign-and-trade so that GSW gets something back."
"I actually don't have anything against Durant for either of his moves, but the way that he's described by multiple sources of being incredibly insecure and resentful (and the fact that he hangs around Kyrie) is the reason I wrote what I wrote.   When I call him toxic, I don't mean in the sense of picking fights or being a locker room cancer. There's more than one way to create a toxic environment and in my mind, Durant's insecurities and anxieties about being respected have created bad situations in the past.(Like this one)   Super Stars carry the gravity of their basketball system, and when you have an emotionally insecure star, it makes for a tenuous system.   The facts we know for certain. Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had conflict, Kevin Durant felt isolated from the Warriors, and Kevin Durant left."
"&gt;  an incredibly insecure and toxic person to be around  It's an incredible exaggeration to say that. What we know is that he made an off-season move considered ""weak"" by the fans, that he's a quiet person, that he has some kind of ego and insecurity that make him say silly things on social media.  But ""toxic""?   &gt; It’s what I’ve been doing.  Also let's not compare what Kevin Durant is going through with what Joe Redditor is doing in his life, however inspirational it might be."
"That’s probably true but Durant by all accounts seems like an incredibly insecure and toxic person to be around. Now, no one deserves to be treated like that. No one deserves to be humiliated and put down, but at the same time, Kevin should have worked on his insecurity issues a long fucking time ago.   It’s what I’ve been doing. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Tobias “Kevin Durant” Harris
Eric Paschall is basically Kevin Durant tbh.
"Yes, without Dinwiddie, Kevin Fucking Durant, and Kyrie Irving.    Really continuing to dig your grave huh?"
"He scored 30 points or whatever it was once in that finals game 7, or how many was it and they thought that he was Prime Kevin Durant scoring wise"
"yeah, I'd even say cheaper than a 73-9 team adding Kevin Durant for sure, my guy"
"Before that draft, and I remember following this because I'm a Kansas fan and Josh Jackson was considered a possible #1, too, so I kept a close eye on it all year. People were all debating Markelle Fultz vs. Lonzo Ball vs. even Josh Jackson for #1. Literally nobody ever mentioned Tatum as a #1 pick. Still, people were saying that you literally couldn't miss in the top 5.  I don't know why the draft was so overhyped. I think it is a perfect mix of Lavar Ball, Boston vs. Lakers, Magic Johnson, and also some pretty good players. In retrospect, it's like, what did people really see in that draft that you wouldn't in other years?  I mean, consider the draft after that. Much, much better draft, and it's not even close, yet I don't remember the hype being anywhere near 2017.  Also, in your list, you missed Kevin Durant and Michael Beasley. It's difficult to overstate just how crazy good both of them were in college. I know Portland fans will all claim Oden over Durant was considered a foregone conclusion, but that's not true. Durant was so good that plenty of people said at the time this is when you need to discard conventional wisdom."
&gt;I don’t know why people discount Kevin fucking Durant.   [Kevin Durant confirms he suffered ruptured right Achilles](https://www.nba.com/article/2019/06/12/warriors-durant-achilles-injury-update)

Klay was top 15, Draymond was top 20-25 and prime Dwight is pretty easily a top 5 player in the league. Couple that with their bench unit being as good or better than a few teams starting lineups and they would just absolutely dominate."
"Gary Payton and Tim Duncan are this teams best 3PT shooters and they are career 30% and 18% 3PT shooters. Duncan was an average mid range shooter, and great in the lowpost, but if Golden State can sag off on Simmons and Wallace he is going to have a hard time dominating in the lowpost. Especially when Wallace and Simmons are clogging the lane. Same for Giannis. Obviously both will still dominate, but it's likely their efficiency takes a dip and they will have much less room to operate and will likely be doubled constantly.   Golden State can hide Steph on Gary Payton, Klay can guard Simmons and sag off on the 3PT line, Kevin Durant on Ben Wallace, put Draymond on Tim Duncan, hope he can get under his shots. and then throw Dwight Howard on Giannis. Without shooters Giannis will have to work harder for his shots. This team is pretty much limited to 18 feet from the basket, and Simmons and Wallace are limited to just the paint.  2017 Warriors win in 5 no question, most likely a sweep.  EDIT: Tim Duncan was a career 40.3% shooter from 10-16 feet."

"Imagine picking up Kevin Durant at the deadline for a first round pick, just to help bolster your shooting a bit"
"Kevin Durant has literally never been successful without a second star as the primary ball handler, and Russ and Harden have proven they can share the ball, so I'm gonna go ahead and call this a bad take bro sorry"
"The repeater tax (paying the luxury tax multiple years in a row) was considered super harsh back then and the front office was reeling from Kevin Durant retroactively having the Rose Rule applied to him (30% max instead of 25%).  Before KD’s retroactive salary bump the team would have safely been able to pay Harden and stay under the tax line, but after the fact they thought they had to avoid going over again because (in their thinking) they would have been paying the repeater tax for years if they tried to keep the core together.   Fact of the matter is that they    1) Could have amnestied Perkins to get below the tax line but overestimated his importance to the team,    2) viewed Harden as both less important than he actually was due to having brought him off the bench his whole time in OKC. And also wrongfully thought of him as a bit of a liability since his partying during the Finals made him a little less effective than he could have been (obviously would have grown out of this), and last but not least,    3) Because the cap started spiking so considerably just a few seasons later (almost +40 in the 5 seasons since 2012), they would have only paid the tax ONE TIME before the cap rising naturally reset their payroll concerns (and additionally, assuming they’ve won at least one title by 2016, may have been able to pull off a “KD” caliber signing that summer to even further stack their roster)."
" Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"For real, if just ONE other team had cap space and expressed genuine interest then OG Anunoby is probably a Spur right now.   Or maybe in some weird alternate universe CJ McCollum is a Spur, the Blazers with Kawhi defeat the Warriors in the WCF but fall to the Bucks or Sixers in the Finals, and Kevin Durant gets to keep his Achilles intact and is currently balling out on the Nets while /r/nba speculates on if he can carry them to the finals without Kyrie."
He had Kevin Durant
"What?  I'll grant you Rose's MVP year, but Russ?  Russ has played with other HOF-ers better than him and squandered it.  WTF does John Wall look like playing with Kevin Durant, Harden, PG, Adams, etc.?  He's only had Beal, and they were so dangerous in that 2017 season (with no bench) as we saw.  Wall is easily the best pure post-Nash/CP3 point guard.  Curry is a SG with handles."
Kevin Durant is here so you get the picture
"? How is it not close? James Harden has several season that dwarf Kevin Durant. Plus on top of that Durant is probably gonna be a fringe starter when he gets back from his injury.   Honestly, it's the end of Durant. Such a shame, he'll be lucky to win 6th man of the year unfortunately. On the other hand, James Harden is still a rising star in his prime and has another 5 good years to go left averaging 27/5/8 left"
"Lillard could possibly do it if he has a good team around him. He has had 50% FG years and 90% FT years before. This year he was shooting 39.3% from three. If he had the luxury of playing with more offensive talent he could’ve been more selective.   A 50-40-90 is slightly more common than you mentioned but it’s still very uncommon...   All NBA players with at least one 50-40-90 season:  Larry Bird with the Boston Celtics, Malcolm Brogdon with the Milwaukee Bucks, Stephen Curry with the Golden State Warriors, Kevin Durant with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Reggie Miller with the Indiana Pacers, Steve Nash with the Phoenix Suns, Dirk Nowitzki with the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Price with the Cleveland Cavaliers  WNBA:  Elena Delle Donne with the Washington Mystics"
"Westbrook and KD have similar resumes outside of the rings? Are you being serious? Outside of the MVPs, KD has a far better resume than Westbrook. Also, what do you mean by “free rings”? You’re acting like Kevin Durant was Quinn Cook or something. He was the Finals MVP in both finals. That’s not a free ring, like at all. I feel like you have a really biased agenda here and aren’t looking at things objectively. Also, Harden and Westbrook winning wouldn’t be a “Dirk-like” ring, because Dirk had no other all stars on his team."
"No, Kevin Durant."
"That Spurs dynasty's longevity is incredible to me. Some of those same guys were giving the Lakers fits in the early 00's. Duncan's first Championship was in '99! When they added Parker and Ginobli they were consistently a high seed in the West FOREVER. Battling solid Suns, Mavericks, Lakers and Thunder teams to get to the Finals so many times. Before the Warriors, it was the Spurs almost guaranteed to come out of the West and face the Eestern Conference Lebrons in whatever form that appeared. The Warriors weren't really THE team in the West until Leonard got injured and Duncan retired. Up until then, Golden State were a rising young franchise with a good shot. I realize they won a title in '15, but didn't face the Spurs in the playoffs that year. It wasn't until they got Kevin Durant that they pulled away from the Spurs as the clearly better team, winning the WCF in '18. Now, both the Spurs and Warriors don't really have much going on this year, and I'm not sure I really see the Warriors bouncing back to dynasty form, even when their stars are all healthy next season."
"&gt; it's a reasonable prediction to make  Nah, he's too young. It's too far off. May as well predict Trae or Luka at this point. Kevin Durant - *Kevin Durant!* - isn't even 100% certain to get there. He probably will, but it ain't certain. And he's maybe a top 5 offensive player ever and already 31 years old.  There's just no point in predicting every young ass dude who starts his career well."
"Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook.  Man just imagine having all these guys together.  Easy dynasty."
"How do people still argue this.   He’s shooting 40% from the field and 32% from 3. Translation: *anyone* can average 25+ with that much grace.   He gets credit for getting to the line, but his efficiency (lack of) is noteworthy. Why? Bc if you just ignore it (like harden fans love to do) then what differentiates levels of greatness? If Harden shooting with Austin rivers splits is still considered great, then wtf is Kevin Durant?!? Or Steph curry?!? Harden is their equal ?? Hell no. And we know from the eye test AND bc the efficiency tells us so.   KD and Steph having generational 50/40/90 type seasons while Harden chucks—- but raises his TS% by FTs.   Only causal fans, analytics babies, and harden fans are fooled by it"
Last 6 times Kevin Durant has Been injures Or Left a Team  2015 OKC : missed Playoffs  2017-19 OKC : 1st round Choke  2019 GS : finals Choke To known chokers  2020 GS : worst Team In the league  Best Player of The decade
- 2017 Russell Westbrook - 2014 Kevin Durant - 2012 LeBron James - 2008 Kobe Bryant - 2006 Steve Nash - 2002 Tim Duncan  That's 6 of the last 18 MVP awards. MVP goes to someone other than the best player on the best regular season team regularly enough.
Steph Curry  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Kawhi Leonard  Karl Towns
"Lebron is a villian in that MANY people still see him as a villian, though I agree that the reasoning is not logical.

"Deron Williams who hasn’t been on the Nets since the summer of 2015 is currently making more $ than 2/3 of the Nets roster on the last year of his buyout.   Only Nets currently making more $ this season are Joe Harris, Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAndre Jordan, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant.   Everyone else is making like $4m or less while D.Will is earning the final $5.4m of his buyout after it was stretched."
those 200 3's Russ made in his MVP year are more than Kevin Durant has ever made in a single season
Thats like saying in 07 2 time league MVP steve nash goes for 14 assists while rookie Kevin Durant has zero....like ugh no shit
Dude's even an NBA Champion too! He was an x-factor on those Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant led teams!
Since 2019 IMO. Kevin Durant was still better than him in 2018
"Kevin Durant in 2014, LeBron in 2012, Kobe in 2008, Nash in 2006"
Kevin Durant in 2014 is another example.
I know others have said this but Ingram looks like Kevin Durant out there.  What a monster.
"Hope you mean Damon Stoudemire cause Amare was far more talented than a Bradley Beal. Peak Nash is also better than Kyrie and Lillard.   Those two are shoot first players. Nash was pass first.   He was a maestro at running offenses. His court vision and passing blow those two out of the court.   He is also a better pure shooter than both. Only Curry and Westbrook have a case over Nash.   The only thing AD does better than Garnett is score.   Everything else goes to Garnett. Kevin was a much better playmaker than AD.   I would def take Durant at the 4 in this era on offense over Garnett, but that is because of the way the game is played now, plus there are less rugged 4s playing.   If it was late 90s to early 2000s, Durant would get ragdolled on defense."
"I think you'd have kevin durant with those, am i wrong?"
Shake is a more handsome Kevin Durant
Mans soon gonna do the Kevin Durant strategy and just shoot over you
The funny part is that Luka plays nothing like Bird at all. Luka's playstyle is of a high scoring combo guard like Harden or Manu. Interstingly enough the closest player to Bird style-wise in the modern NBA is Kevin Durant.
And they used to share the court with Kevin. Fucking.  Durant.  Oh my oh my too bad we didnt see that Superasonics dynasty.
"Again,  without Kevin Durant, Currys legacy is being LeBrons greatest achievement in 2016. It was so bad that even after Curry admitted he was healthy Warriors fans had to come up with some random injury as an excuse. But Kevin Durant saved Currys legacy. Durant SWEPT LeBron. Curry was just along for the ride."
"&gt; You can diminish the accolades of ever single top 20 player this way   Not to the extent of Steph Curry (or Kevin Durant for that matter). No other top players in non-milkman eras have played on such a stacked team. It’s not even close. For all the crying and whining that went on about Miami between 2011-2014, Dwayne Wade was really only in his prime for their first season together and was straight up awful in some of their 2013 and 2014 series. Bosh averaged like 13 PPG in the 2013 and 2014 Finals combined."
"What does it mean to be the “emotional leader”?  I feel like this is just a nice way of saying he’s loud and draws attention to himself. I mean he single handedly locked in the departure of Kevin Durant by pissing him off ffs, some leader"
"That means you're agreeing with me then. There is no consesus number 1 pick and I'm not talking Luka, Zion or Morant level and because of this no one wants the number one overall pick. Why would any organization trade up when there is no surefire star? Oladipo didn't break out until last year. Sure he showed flashes in both Orlando and Oklahoma but neither of those teams were competing anything. Look at Ingram. He was the number 2 overall pick, tremendously talent and was pegged as the next Kevin Durant (mainly due to build) he didn't break out until this year or maybe post-ASB last year. You mentioned Otto Porter and said he was solid his 3rd season - I said it would take that long for these players up top to be contributors. Why would the FO select Wiseman when he and Chriss have overlapping skillsets and Chriss' contract is cheaper? Banking on potential? The Warriors' FO wants to trade up or out all together and just pick up veterans during the off-season that know what the fuck they are doing already. 2020 is the class to watch and that's why we wanted Minnesota's pick swap. Your entire last paragraph is just agreeing with me. I said it would take them a couple years and you agreed."
"Imagine if they have Kevin Durant, and Serge Ibaka"
Warriors with:  PG: Steph Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kevin Durant PF: Draymond Green C: Wilt Chamberlain  Next season seems pretty spicy.
Kevin Durant against Cleveland both times.
"I’m a giant Duke fan so you don’t need to lecture me on anything.  I watched every single minute of Zion’s Duke career.  99% of this sub doesn’t watch CBB and shits on it for being a lower quality of basketball, so saying shit so dismissively as “How did Duke fail to make the Final 4 with all that talent...” gets fucking old. The college game is stylistically a lot different. RJ was a ball hog. As “talented” as we were, we were super unbalanced in our team composition and not deep at all, a lot of which is on K’s style. We couldn’t shoot the 3 at all. That makes keying in on Zion a lot easier and you throw in RJ playing hero ball, there’s a ton of factors why we lost. But people never mention how good MSU was. Zion was also coming back from his knee injury. He had played plenty of games by tournament time, but wasn’t completely the same explosive, dominant guy he was before the freak shoe explosion. K could have and should have put the ball in Z’s hands at the end of the game, but he didn’t. It was a close ass game. There is so much nuance and complexity to this shit that people love to ignore just to shit on Duke and it’s tiresome.  Also, complete side note but kind of harkening back to something I said earlier, the main point of my frustration is that people love to circlejerk like having talent is exclusive to winning a single elimination tournament. Fucking Kevin Durant dominated on a Texas squad with DJ Augustin as a teammate and other dudes who made the league and they got bounced in the second round. One isolated game in a tournament doesn’t mean shit if a lot goes wrong. And a lot went wrong for Duke that game. Some of that was on K, a lot of it on RJ, but really what can you do? RJ hit plenty of huge shots for us all year so yeah, Zion was lot better than him, but RJ was the focal point of our offense, for better or worse.   And like I said earlier, this sub shits on CBB without watching anything but tournament games and the occasional highlight on ESPN, so dumb, circlejerky shit like this is what gets BVB old. A ton of people on the college sub shit on the NBA for dumb shit too. I feel like I’m the only person on this planet that loves both the NBA and College Hoops and can understand both are different, but that doesn’t mean one is better than the other. That’s all subjective. People can talk about both with out throwing out shitty takes like this.  /rant"
"The starting lineup was Westbrook/ Thabo Sefolosha/ Kevin Durant/ Serge Ibaka/ Kendrick Perkins.  The bench had Harden, Reggie Jackson, Eric Maynor, Derek Fisher, Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook, Nick Collison and Royal Ivey.   That team was super young, even Perk was only 27 back then.  [Here’s the roster ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2012.html) Which young players today would you take to build a roster like this?  Ja Morant/Royce O’Neal/Tatum/Siakam/Zubac   With a bench of D’lo, Malik Beasley/Ish Smith/Haslem/Muscala"
"Here's the thing. Hand size measurements aren't readily available online.   Kevin Durant  ""While there is no official measurement, KD has openly admitted that he is unable to palm a basketball, which is somewhat controversial. This is rather surprising considering he is 6'9"". This means his hands are quite small for a man his size""  Source: https://howtheyplay.com/team-sports/14-NBA-Players-With-the-Most-Impressive-Hand-Sizes  As for Dirk? There's nothing about it online. If either him or KP actually had huge hands for their size, then we'd know about it and talk about it just like how we talk about MJ, Kawhi, Giannis, and Boban's hands. It's common sense. Keep in mind that the guys I mentioned have hand sizes that are average for guys a foot taller than them. As a Mavs fan, kp and Dirk probably have average hand size for their height."
Saying he could be the next Kevin Durant is a far more blasphemous take than a guy with an injury history long than a Harry Potter book would be out of the league before hitting his 7th season.
I wouldn’t. MPJ has the ceiling of a top 5 player and is only 21. Hes 6’10 with handles and a shot. He could be Kevin Durant.
"It’s unbelievable to me how people forget. Even when he was winning titles in golden state I was not impressed. He was playing 1on1 almost never the main focus of the opposing teams defense because curry took that burden off him. I literally remember watching in the 2017 finals there would be some 2v3 transition situations where the cavs players opted to guard curry and Klay at thre three point line instead of durant was was wide open under the basket.    Kevin durant did not get better in golden state he just got wide open shots, wide open layups and he had other stars to take the burden off him. KD wasn’t even the warriors best player in their only competitive series ever against the rockets in 2018."
"everyone besides curry in the starting 5 was bigger than jordan ? from iggy to draymond to klay are all elite on ball defenders it isnt a fair assumption to say something like that.  Isiah thomas - 1.85 m Curry - 1.91 m  Joe dumars - 1.90 m Klay Thompson - 1.98  Bill lambier - 2.11 m Kevin Durant - 2.11 m  Dennis Rodman - 2.01 m Draymond Green - 1.95  who is 5th, aguire or james edwards ? neverthless the last one is a center so its unfair to judge but Aguire is smaller than igoudala  Now i dont know why did i waste my time writing this as you have no ideia what you are talking about!  Have a good weekend"
"Someone that tall and lanky should not be able to love like that. I swear Durant is an anomaly, guys with his body type should move like Kevin Knox."
"People cannot understand a joke, much less ESPN reporters with zero social cues.   Giannis’ whole strategy was to draft underdogs. He made a comment saying “Kevin Durant” and drafted BI. this is the exact same situation. Has anyone from ESPN tried to create a narrative that Giannis was disrespecting Kevin Durant comparing him to BI? NO.   Fucks sake, at least make the beef interesting. Like LeBron vs Kawhi or something."
"Look at this loser   Just straight up hates Harden even though he took a team that won a title, 67 games, 73 wins, made 2 finals AND THEN ADDED KEVIN DURANT TO REPLACE THEIR WEAKEST STARTER.    Harden lead a team that was up 3-2 on them before his only all star went down. People like you are so fucking  dumb.    If Chris Paul never got hurt people would consider him like Dirk Nowitzki but because his teammate got hurt he is just as shitty playoff choker?    KD wasn’t even able to beat the warriors that didn’t have durant, LeBron barely beat the warriors without durant HARDEN WAS AN INJIRY AWAY FROM BEING THE BEST TEAM EVER.    What the fuck has Giannis done? He beat the pistons? Whoopty fucking do.    Giannis can’t hold Hardens jockstrap when it comes to postseason success"
Does Kevin Wayne Durant and Achilles ring a bell?!
"Have you been smoking every ounce of crack since it's inception?! Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are not playing! Nets can only get so far without them! Nets can only get so far with one type of player carrying the team and we've seen this before. Don't do drugs, kids. It's bad."
People also forget there is a sequel where the kid gets dumped during the Klay Thompson game. Then he gets into drugs and eventually kills himself after seeing his hero Kevin Durant bolt for the hardest road in Golden State.   That one wasn’t as good.
I would say kevin Durant 100%
Apparently some dude named Kevin Durant is the american Bruno Caboclo
Lmao Kevin Durant and id even say Khris Middleton are better. Maybe Kyrie too.
"KD imho is going to be the best answer. Which is surprising to say because obviously when we think KD on the Warriors we treat it like Steph's team. However, Lebron had to beat KD to get his first ring. Then KD did what he did and came back to stop two of the greatest playoff runs by an individual, to win his two rings. A minimum of 3 finals duels across a decade? With each of their first rings coming at the expense of the other?   It's a pretty interesting thought IMO.   Though I think ultimately in the same way that we remember how MJ basically stopped every other star in his era from getting rings. We will remember how many stars of this era Lebron had to beat to get his rings. Even if many of them also managed to win rings at Lebrons expense. You've got:     * Paul Pierce, KG and those older Celtics squads.  * Russ and Harden (In 2012 when they were young, and potentially even this year) * Kevin Durant * Young Kawhi (and potentially superstar Kawhi) * PG13 multiple times on the Pacers * Prime DRose and the Bulls * Steph, Klay, Draymond and the 73-9 Warriors  Pretty sizable list, and with Lebron looking like he has a few more finals runs in him. We may add a few more to the list o.0"
Kevin Durant
Paul Pierce the first half of his career. Kevin Durant the second half.
Dude.  How long has Jerami Grant been Kevin Durant?
Because those are contested in name only... it isn't really a contest to Kevin Durant.
If Giannis could be Michael Jordan at 6'6 why isn't he Kevin Durant now?
"True, I think he can be a Kevin Durant (maybe not as good) type player in that regard, but playmaking is the best counter to the doubles he’s been seeing lately. He’s shown flashes of vision and he’s tall enough to pass over most traps. If he can improve just a bit more in that area I think he’ll be unguardable"
Kevin Durant has been randomly chosen for a drug test by the NBA
"What if I told you, that the Golden State Warriors would be led to the promise Land with Stephen Curry. Then it took a 73-9 season with the greatest performance from LeBron James, a player better than Jordan potentially, and a string of bad luck to defeat them. However I'm not done yet, Kevin Durant, a Wilt Chamberlain with a 3 and skinny frame at SF to join us and defeat LeBron James back to back. I still can't imagine it"
"5'8'' is above average for human males as a whole, and the pool of Basketball players is the pool of men all over the world.  6'7'' is the average height of NBA players because height is the most important thing in Basketball  There are like 3+ billion 5 footers in the world and not a single one of them is at the top of the food chain in Basketball. Meanwhile there might be 3000 7 footers in the world and 7 footers like Embiid, Giannis, Kevin Durant, Jokic are at the top of the food chain in the NBA"
Damn you just showed me the light. Hopefully Kevin Durant calls out Giannis for comparing him to Brandon Ingram during the all-star draft too
"He is the definition of a choker...  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league.

Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"Hard to get good role players when you got fucking Kevin Durant , Steph Curry , Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green."
"A golden state with a broken Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant? Yeah, real tough."
"Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant also cried while thanking his mother for raising him. Neither KD or Giannis is humble and thats ok, they doesn't need to be"
"Rookie Giannis was not very good.   &gt;and you think if Giannis was 6'9 he wouldn't be in the league?   Where do I say anything even close to this? I said he wouldn’t be an all star. You aren’t allowed to just pull shit out of your ass and pretend I said it...   &gt;Man you have the dumbest takes on this sub.  Take a look in the mirror.   &gt;Wew, let's see. Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Bill Russell, Hakeem Olajuwon (btw Giannis is his favorite player, funfact). none of these guys exist?  Let’s go through these then.   Shaq- slower than Giannis.  Wilt- played in completely different era, probably the closest thing to Giannis.  Durant- laughable comparison, Giannis is superior physically in every way.   Russell- Russell was 6’9...  Olajuwon- Giannis is faster and more agile.   What is the point of bringing any of them up anyway? Giannis isn’t the only player to rely heavily on their physical advantages to be great. You are taking this way to personal."
Kevin Durant: Time to end ~~NBA~~ ban on marijuana
"So rookie Giannis' body? Man you have the dumbest takes on this sub. Siakam is the closest comparison to Giannis' skillset and size and you think if Giannis was 6'9 he wouldn't be in the league?    &gt;But there has NEVER been a guy that tall/long/strong with that much agility and explosion.    Wew, let's see. Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Kevin Durant, Bill Russell, Hakeem Olajuwon (btw Giannis is his favorite player, funfact). none of these guys exist?"
"Giannis was literally making a joke about Harden being a high usage player who takes a lot of shots. He also jokingly called Brandon Ingram Kevin Durant. He’s not serious during those all star drafts, it’s just fun"
That player is Kevin Durant. He's an all-star guard with the length of a big man.
I fuckin love Kevin Durant. Keeps it fuckin real.
"Dude, he played with the greatest shooter in the history of the game BY FAR and the 3rd greatest shooter in the history of the game, then for good measure they added Kevin Durant to that squad.  Draymond Green is what he has always been, a very good defender who can pass. That's it.  The guy has shot 29% from 3 the last couple of years on WIDE OPEN shots and has averaged 7 assists playing with Steph, Klay and KD.  Warriors fans want to say this guy is a HoF when he's a much worse version of Ben Wallace.  Warriors biggest strength was never their defense, this guy is probably the most overrated player of the decade."
"Kyrie had perhaps the most efficient 50 point game of all time, and he did that while playing with his fucked up shoulder. Kevin Durant is Kevin Durant.   Its not as crazy as it sounds."
Can you do James Harden and Kevin Durant?
"Harden took a team that won a title, won 73 games and made 2 finals and then replaced their worst starter with kevin durant too 7 games and was up 3-2 before his running mate gor injured   Malone never faced the team as stacked as the warriors, not even the 97 bulls were as good as the championship, 73 winning back to back finals team that added a player who people think is nearly on the same level as bird or lebron ( which durant isn't, those people are just idiots who started watching ball 2 years ago)"
"Dude i fucking hates pre warriors Durant and this article sums up why. *Kevin Durant wears a backpack* ""Oh my god that's so cute and wholesome! KD is the best basketball star ever!"""
Kevin Durant was Oklahoma’s god apparently
"nope, I do not-personally know Kevin Durant. Do I think he has a problem? Yes. Do I think he is more in danger than the average dude? Yes. We have enough data now in terms of how he responds to media and criticism in general to start drawing some conclusions. By the way, KD, I think you are soft and fluffy like a marshmallow."
Kevin Durant sitting behind an ambulance flashing it moves the cars in front  Nothing to do with the ambulance or sirens
"&gt; Kevin Durant, to me in my personal opinion, is the best player in the NBA.  Oh man, an anon would be downvoted to shit for saying this."
"Saying ""it can allow a secondary ballhandler to thrive"" is a little dishonest - he NEEDS a secondary ballhandler to have the ball at LEAST as much as him both so he can play offball where he is strongest and so his body doesn't break down. Harden does not. What Harden does is make anyone that can stand in the corner, shoot some 3s, and defend a title contender by himself because their gameplan is let Harden figure out the defense. Curry's offball isn't only a positive thing because what if the other ballhandler isn't sufficient and they want him to be ON ball? Do you think he could do that for a whole season/playoffw?  Not every team has the luxury that the Warriors had during Curry's recent run.   Off ball movement isn't the be-all, end-all. The Rockets don't play that type of offense and they've consistently been one of the top offenses in the league since they got Harden. The Bucks are similar in that they don't ask their guys to run around like crazy.  They're doing pretty well. The Warriors do it because they have the personnel for it - but imagine if this season's Warriors had Curry but forced him off ball. Who would be passing to him?  Harden was going toe to toe with Kevin Durant while maintaining the highest usage and FGA in the series. He's a better overall player."
Kevin Durant acts like a piece of dogshit and people in OKC are so stupid they celebrate him lol.
"I've asked you to provide examples 6 times and been patient with giving you the opportunity to change my mind.   To take it a step further, I will google it for you. [You know google exists right?](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=kevin+durant+character+traits). Use that link to find me an example of what you are saying."
"Pretty simple:  1. Small town ambulance driver sees Kevin Durant while on the job 2. He uses it as an opportunity to make up a story to get on local TV 3. News channel doesn't give a fuck, runs with the story because it sounds cool   [The weirdest thing is that he was awarded a medal for this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4jt6kf/kevin_durant_being_honored_with_everyday_hero/)"
"Dudes sensitive that's just who he is, that doesn't mean he isn't a really good person who has constantly done amazing things for people.   Kevin Durant man of the people."
"I thought Durant said he wasn't playing this season even if the Nets' make the playoffs earlier in the season. It's mostly other reporters and fans speculating that since the playoffs are going to be delayed people would think KD would be in even better shape with the extra time so headlines could say ""WILL KEVIN DURANT COME BACK FOR THE PLAYOFFS AND MAKE THE NETS CONTENDERS??!"""
"Kevin Durant is one of the best shooters from any spot on the floor, in any era."
"“I saw the ambulance from behind me, and it was kind of slow in front of me, and I moved over. I said, ‘I’m just going to follow the ambulance so I can get through traffic real quick,’” Kevin Durant said. “So I moved over. I can’t take full credit for that.”  Shit KD will tell you himself."
"80s - Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Kareem Abdul Jabbar  90s - Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon  00s - Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal  10s - Stephen Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Dwight Howard"
lmao this nephew thinks kevin durant is the best player in the nba  Edit: y'all I was joking. Notice how I said nephew even tho kukoc is a great
"Basketball doesn’t require a playmaker anymore, somebody that you always look for that has to bring the ball up the floor. In this era, there's so many players with multiple skills, that it’s almost a waste of time to look for the playmaker when someone can push the ball and get into the offense.   Plenty of times LeBron is mistaken as a point guard, which is awesome. Kevin Durant, to me in my personal opinion, is the best player in the NBA. He can easily bring the ball up the floor. That’s a style that the triangle offense allowed that any one of us could run the point or be a post person or fill the corners. It’s not requirement to have a point guard, you can have skill players with 3 or 4 guys on the same team playing multiple positions. - Toni"
then kevin durant will immediately demand to be waived and then sign with the bucks.  the harder hardest road
Sadly it is real my friend. https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/oklahoma-city-kevin-durant-helps-ambulance-emergency-051516  https://www.news9.com/story/5e34b23c527dcf49dad8d15c/kevin-durant-clears-path-for-paramedics-responding-to-an-emergency
"Others have covered the salary cap and the draft issue. To expand on the draft issue, bad teams in the EPL would get relegated. In the NBA, bad teams have greater chance of getting higher draft picks to get the best young prospects. Also the rich teams in the EPL/La Liga etc, who are usually the good teams, sign the best young prospects since they can bid the highest.  What others haven't covered is the fact that you can't buy players off other teams in the NBA (and like most American professional leagues. Not sure about MLS though). You have to trade for them. In soccer, you can buy players off other teams. Which is one major reason why the strong teams remain dominant in soccer.  If you add this along with salary cap limitations, Golden State can't hypothetically just pay the Lakers $200 million to acquire  Lebron to replace Kevin Durant leaving.  If the NBA was like the EPL, there's a good chance that the Knicks or Lakers would have been the most likely fighting for the championship over a lot of the history barring major injury issues. Those two teams have the highest revenue and the teams that are worth the most. However, maybe the Clippers in recent years as well since they have by far the richest owner(so kinda like Manchester City becoming a premiership/ECL contending team only relatively recently because of rich ownership)."
"Toni what was on your mind after '98 Finals game 5? You had  perfect game but still you guys lost the game. What was locker room reaction? Did the last play actually planned for Michael or did he take your shot because both of you run to ball before Michael take the ball.   Also when Luka Doncic first came into the league his coach Carlisle (also was assistant coach during 98' Pacers) said he wants to play Luka at the 4 he didn't played 4 in his career before just like you when Phil Jackson wanted from you back in '93-94. Carlisle mentioned you after said he wants to play Luka at PF position. What do you think about impact in todays league, i also saw Kevin Durant wore your jersey in his summer practice last summer.   Also i know it must be emotional for you to remember '93 summer but, just after Drazen died and you came to Bulls in your very first day in training facility, Michael decided to retire. How was the locker room? Did Michael talked to you before the announcement? I know you two guys love to play golf, i remember you guys played together in same team 3 years ago, what was the last time you guys played golf together?"
I would put Kevin Durant over Dwight and run AD at center
"Eh that’s certainly debatable and you’re actually posting zero facts to support your “opinion”. The rules have certainly changed and allowed for more elaborate defensive schemes. There’s a strong counter argument about the strength of individual one on one defenders back then, and the dramatically increased level of physical play back then as well. Obviously it wasn’t all [Kurt rambis clotheslines ](https://youtu.be/X7r6vXeOfyQ) but even watch bulls/pistons or better yet read the excellent book Jordan rules.   Wilbon is an idiot, he choose examples poorly.  Lebron would be in the goat conversation no matter what era, and Kevin Durant would have been every bit as challenging to defend, even more so with 80s power forwards trying to defend him on an island. Steph Curry would have definitely had his challenges back then, but look how successful the similarly sized isaiah thomas was. Curry’s medical issues would have been the bigger challenge."
&gt; Kevin Durant had already locked up hero status in Oklahoma City  --  &gt; Durant and the Thunder kick off the Western Conference Finals against the Warriors on Monday night at 9 ET.  oh boy
Can Kevin Durant even fit into a Ferrari? He’s like 6’10 and those cars are already cramped as it is

&gt;Kevin Durant IS IN THE BUILDING  Rucker Park is outside lol
"The NBA more than any other sport is driven by superstar players. You can’t really be a real championship contender unless you have at least top 5 player in the league on your team, some would say you need to have a top 3 player.  Golden State had two of their best players, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, get hurt last year. And another great player Steph Curry got hurt this year. So they have been playing without their stars for pretty much the whole year and are having a bad season.  Even though Kevin Durant left for another team in free agency, they will get Steph Curry and Klay Thompson back next year and will be near the top of the Western Conference again."
"Currently, the Warriors are in a weird spot, since their best player in Kevin Durant became a free agent last summer and left them to join the Brooklyn Nets.  On top of losing Durant, they also lost their 2 best players to injury this season(Steph Curry and Klay Thompson), so they've decided to play/develop their young talent instead, and aim for a high lottery pick.  Honestly, when they're fully healthy next season, Golden State is likely gonna jump back up to the top of the Western Conference."
And Kevin Durant goes to the clippers or Boston
"The only way to defend against the offense of Shaq, Jordan, and Kobe is to have a lot of length and use a lot of help defense with smart rotations. None of those offensive players are elite passers (now they had seasons where they were very good to great, just not elite), which means that you need to use help and force the ball out of their hands and make it as difficult for them to isolate as possible.   On offense, I agree that we need spacing. One issue is looking at the center position because the best scoring center (IMO) is KAT, but he is a horrible defender. Since Embiid is a better three point shooter (and therefore spacer) than Jokic and the better defender of the two IMO, I think he should be taken as center and have him space the floor on offense.  I love Curry but one great thing about the Warriors was they had Klay, Draymond, and Iggy who are all amazing defenders, and so the Warriors could hide Curry. Against the offensive forces of Jordan and Kobe, that team would be seeking out Curry the whole game and I don't know how much you can hide it while also helping on everyone, so unfortunately I'd replace him.  If we're assuming players are in peak form, I'd probably run something like the following because they can space the floor and can lock in on defense (some a little more of one side of that coin than the other):  PG: LeBron James  SG: Paul George  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Kawhi Leonard  C: Joel Embiid"
1. LeBron James 2. Larry Bird 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Julius Erving 6. Scottie Pippen (although I'm tempted to say Dantley)
most recent one that came close i know of was 2017: steph curry kevin durant draymond green klay thompson. pretty sure a whole starting 5 has never made it before but i could be wrong.
"Kevin Durant: Yes sir, I'm a bitch."
Kyrie Irving Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant Karl Malone Kristaps Porzingis  K seems pretty good...
"PG - Kyle Lowry  SG - Kobe Bryant  SF - Kevin Durant  PF/- Kevin Garnett  C - Kareem  Edit - for some reason thought of Klay before Kobe, silly me"
"Kevin Durant  ""GSW roadtrips remind me of the movie Snakes on a Plane  #anaconda"""
"Right, I agree. He can handle shit irrational and overreact by taking his “me vs them” attitude way to far. This interview here kind of highlights what I’ve been talking about:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/09/10/kevin-durant-never-attached-oklahoma-city-thunder-again/amp/  While I will never know the full extent of what he did/didn’t experience, this is what I meant by saying I truly just don’t think he cared about OKC anymore sad to say. But the franchise is ran great with a bright present and future, all in all both sides are better off because of it."
"There was that time when Manute Bol turned into the stretchiest 5 and [canned 6 3-pointers in a half](https://youtu.be/45czWPhWQOI). For reference, the difference in height between Manute Bol and Kevin Durant is about the same as between Kevin Durant and Eric Bledsoe. And of the three of them, Manute Bol is also the lightest."
"Kevin Durant: ""Wait, am I the bad guy?"""
"You got it right on. I can’t believe there are still Kevin Durant apologists out there. He pulled the most chickenshit move in the history of professional sports, used burners to defend it and trash his old teammates, fights with teenagers on Instagram, got pissy because of Bob Myers’ joke, and got mad because Steph Curry was more beloved by the fanbase. He deserves all the clowning he gets."
Kevin Durant is an NBA superstar. No shit people are gonna make fun of his insecure horseshit on a subreddit dedicated to the NBA. Does this actually have to be explained?   He’s a fully grown man who is more successful than 99.999% of human beings who have ever lived and has reached the pinnacle of his career but he still gets into arguments with randoms on Twitter and cries because the fans loved Golden State’s homegrown star more. It’s pathetic. Kevin Durant is a certified clown.
"Sure thing. I also failed to mention that I incorporated Win Shares as well as games played, since nobody makes the Hall as a player on only a couple of peak seasons.   Three caveats to the list:   1. For anyone upset with MJ at #5, those years playing baseball hurt him in basically every category as he wasn't adding to his already impressive list of accolades (would've meant additional All-Stars, All-NBAs, Win Shares, Gs Played and potentially All-Defense). Similarly, Magic is hurt by having his career interrupted/cut short by HIV. 2. Finding a list of all players with an NBA championship is very difficult and would be very time-consuming (and manual) for me, so while it contributes to the overall score of each player, the list of players that have titles to their names is incomplete (particularly if they have just 1), so the list should definitely be considered a work-in-progress. 3. It is a ranking of careers, not talent or peak skill level. So if you think I have slighted Wilt or Bill Russell in any way, just know that every single player in the top-21 of this list has double-digit All-Stars, 9+ All-NBA (10+ if you exclude KG) and several have double-digit All-Defense selections as well. I elected to make MVP, DPOY and ROY binary as this was originally intended to be predictive of Hall consideration and haven't revisited that decision since, though there is probably a good case to do so as multiple MVPs is indicative of a very impressive career. So, again, work in progress.  Without further ado, here is the list (as well as the scores for the top-20):  1. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (43.37) 2. Tim Duncan (42.23) 3. Kobe Bryant (40.76) 4. LeBron James (39.77) 5. Michael Jordan (37.51) 6. Shaquille O'Neal (35.69) 7. Karl Malone (34.85) 8. **Hakeem Olajuwon (34.00)** 9. Kevin Garnett (33.93) 10. Wilt Chamberlain (33.43) 11. David Robinson (32.80) 12. Bill Russell (30.91) 13. Oscar Robertson (30.47) 14. Dirk Nowitzki (30.27 15. Larry Bird (30.14) 16. Jerry West (29.87) 17. John Havlicek (28.83) 18. Charles Barkley (28.80) 19. Bob Pettit (28.76) 20. Bob Cousy (28.38) 21. Magic Johnson (28.17) 22. Chris Paul 23. Kevin Durant 24. John Stockton 25. Moses Malone 26. Dolph Schayes 27. Gary Payton 28. Dwyane Wade 29. Scottie Pippen 30. Allen Iverson 31. Jason Kidd 32. Julius Erving 33. Elgin Baylor 34. Russell Westbrook 35. Dwight Howard 36. James Harden 37. Patrick Ewing 38. Steve Nash 39. Walt Frazier 40. Stephen Curry 41. Elvin Hayes 42. Willis Reed 43. Dave Cowens 44. Hal Greer 45. Dominique Wilkins 46. Clyde Drexler 47. George Gervin 48. Carmelo Anthony 49. Bill Sharman 50. Dikembe Mutombo (17.51)"
"Kevin Durant, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird. Bro you’re dead wrong on this one"
"""I'm about to pull a 'Kevin Durant' on the Bucks"""
"Lol give me a break, I agree he ran his players into the ground, but saying he should have predicticted their injury history is asinine. If you looked at Westbrook and d rose when they were young id ay they both had very similar styles with reckless abandon around the rim. If I knew nothing I did now I'd say both of those guys would have injury problems down the line but Westbrook has been an absolute iron man. Again where were these injury predictors when everybody and their mom was lined up to take Oden number one over Kevin fucking Durant??"
My money would have been on Kevin Durant if he hadn't had the injury.
kevin durant better not sunbathe before practice
"Kobe doesn’t win a Game 7 by himself against an unanimous MVP, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, the DPOY and a FMVP stop it, nobody can do it, Harden didn’t, Lebron didn’t, even MJ wouldn’t, basketball is a teams sport"
"? What is that argument Russ had Kevin Durant, James Harden and Serge Ibaka why do you act like he carried that team? It’s still impressive but it wasn’t a one man show at all and you’re trying to make it look like it is"
"I am sorry but ""a very thin line"" is ridiculous. The celtics traded 8 of their players for kg and allen. The miami lost no one to get the best player in the world and pretty good all star in bosh. The celtics got really lucky that rondo was a phenomenal point guard. Since they had to fill out the rest of the rosters with minimum players nobody wanted.  Forget lebron for a moment. Imagine if Kevin Durant was traded to the warriots instead of coming over from free agency. The warriors would have to offer atleast 1 of dray or klay. Then they have to add picks and fillers to both since durant makes more. They lose 1 star and a couple rotation players there and then  effectively removing their aura of invincibility.    Also KG wanted to leave the wolves. He had a veto, yes. but he didnt tell the wolves beforehand to trade him to the celtics. The wolves shopped KG then they had to ask him if he liked the trade and he could say yes or no. Unlike wade bron and bosh. Who collaborated before hand. Hence ""teaming up""     Ill repeat my point. Durants move was closer to lebron's move than the celtics big 3. I daresay the celtics big three was just the celtics making win now moves and no ""team up"" was happening."
"Your friend is not a fan of light skins:  &gt;Bradley Beal is better than Luka Dončić &gt; &gt;Dwight Howard currently is better than Brook Lopez &gt; &gt;David Robinson is arguably better than Tim Duncan &gt; &gt;Dirk Nowitzki is not a top 5 PF of all-time &gt; &gt;Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, and Scottie Pippen, are all better than Larry Bird &gt; &gt;Jayson Tatum is better than Luka Dončić &gt; &gt;John Stockton is vastly overrated &gt; &gt;Karl Malone is better than Tim Duncan &gt; &gt;Karl-Anthony Towns is better than Nikola Jokić &gt; &gt;Larry Bird is not a top 5 SF of all-time &gt; &gt;Nikola Jokić is barely better than Andre Drummond &gt; &gt;Oscar Robertson is better than Stephen Curry &gt; &gt;Robert Covington is better than Domantas Sabonis &gt; &gt;Stephen Curry has barely been better than other elite point guards such as Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, and Russell Westbrook his entire career &gt; &gt;Tim Duncan is not the best PF of all-time &gt; &gt;Walt Frazier is better than Stephen Curry"
"&gt;Jayson Tatum is better than Luka Dončić  I dunno your friend seems pretty cool to me.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, Julius Erving, and Scottie Pippen, are all better than Larry Bird   &gt;   &gt;Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, ans Shaquille O'Neal aren't top 10 players of all-time   &gt;   &gt;Larry Bird is not a top 5 SF of all-time  Ok fuck this guy."
"Here we go with the your an idiot-gotcha-lmao points instead of making real ones. I'm not a LeBron Stan. I never said I respected LeBron's rings in Miami. What Kevin Durant did was the bottom of the barrel.  If you respect both LeBron and KDs rings then why ask about LeBron??? You assumed I'm a LeBron Stan and that I was going to jump through mental hoops for him but your wrong and your gotcha question didn't work.   Ring chasing is when you leave your team to join an already good playoffs team (warriors, heat)."
"I respect both of their rings because they put themselves in the best position to win, and they both still had to earn them. All I meant was saying KD was ring chasing and LeBron wasn’t is hypocritical when they were both doing it.  &gt; Even in Cleveland, joining a team that was sub 500 is not ring chasing.  It definitely is, especially when you make that sub 500 team trade their first overall pick for Kevin Love. If you come in and change the entire make up of the team you’re definitely ring chasing, sorry.  &gt; LeBron was ring chasing in Miami, but it's not as bad as Kevin Durant. That's why I said there's zero respect for ring chasing but it's worse when you leave a team like OKC where he could have won a ring, to join a 73-9 team.  If you don’t respect ring chasing then you don’t respect it period. You can’t just pick and choose when it applies or not. LeBron stans will jump through all sorts of mental hoops to defend their god king lmao."
"Why can’t he say he deserves his rings?  &gt;There's zero respect for ring chasing, and it's worse when you were already on a great team. Strong disagree here.  Do you respect LeBron’s rings with the Cavs?  Your exact words.   Even in Cleveland, joining a team that was sub 500 is not ring chasing.   LeBron was ring chasing in Miami, but it's not as bad as Kevin Durant. That's why I said there's zero respect for ring chasing but it's worse when you leave a team like OKC where he could have won a ring, to join a 73-9 team."
"* Some nephews need to stop harping on about one-motion/two-motion jumpshots.  It's probably something that they heard from Coach Nick and parrot it whenever they can.  Every player is not the same.  You can't automatically make assumptions based on shooting form.   * Rockets fans are insufferable when it comes to Harden.  Nobody denies his greatness. The problem we all have with him is that he manipulates the refs too much.  It may be a 'smart' approach, but it is a shameful one.   * The 2017 Golden State Warriors are not the greatest team ever.  Curry can be neutralized with physicality as seen in 2016 Finals.  Kevin Durant will cook anyone, Klay can get hot against anyone, but Stephen Curry needs to be rolling for those Warriors to be the best team ever.  Also Curry would get wrecked by hand checking. * The 2002 Sacramento Kings were not robbed.  They had multiple opportunities to put the Lakers away in Game 7 and straight up choked. * Steve Nash is overrated.  His defense was abysmal.  You can't be in talks of the best point guard ever if you only play one side of the ball. * Dirk Nowitzki is not better than Kevin Garnett or even Chris Webber.  He was a better shooter and was lucky to have good team management.  That's it. * Hakeem Olajuwon cannot dribble like a guard.  Stop saying this, he can't. Doing a crossover side to side from the post is one thing.  Dribbling up the length of the court through traffic is another. * Chris Bosh is not an all-time great.  He is a nice man and was a very good player.  His defense was not that good until he got to Miami.  His scoring was inconsistent as the main guy.  A team led by him would not go anywhere.  Being part of a championship team does not elevate him to Hall of Fame status.   * Magic Johnson and Larry Bird cannot be in the conversation for best player of all time.  Michael Jordan is so revered because of his excellence on both sides of the ball.  Magic and Larry did not have that type of impact on defense.  They simply did not have the athleticism.  Athleticism does not always matter on offense, but on defense it does.  It's not everything, but it is very important when it comes to defense. * Kobe Bryant was not the greatest player of his era.  Neither was Tim Duncan.  Nor Shaquille O'Neal.  They all took turns flourishing as the man in the league and showed their quality of the course of their careers.  Who was the greatest player of that era? No one.  They were all at about the same level in terms of accomplishments and impact.   * Grant Hill would not have been in GOAT conversations if he had stayed healthy.  He accomplished diddly in the playoffs for the first half of his career.  He was a uniquely talented player, but you need a lot more than that to crack the top 10 of all time list.   * Brandon Roy is not that big of a what if.  He was very good and had a complete offensive game.  People talk about him like he was next in line after Kobe.  He was not the kind of player that can carry a franchise on his back.  What do I mean?  Look at Paul Pierce.   * People need to stop bringing up Kareem in GOAT debates.  He failed to lead his team to the playoffs in his prime.  After his first championship, he didn't accomplish much playoff success until Magic Johnson came around.  Magic Johnson was driving the car so to speak for the last several seasons of Kareem's career. * The only reason Kobe isn't ranked higher on most people's list is because of the weird trajectory his career had.  Also, he didn't come off the bench in the beginning because he sucked.  If he had been handed the keys right from the start, he probably could have averaged around 18 ppg as a rookie straight out of high school.  He was that good.  The team would have sucked, but he would have shown his scoring prowess right away.  The 2006 first round playoff exit was not his fault, it was Kwame's for missing a box out.  Yes, he did quit in Game 7. * LBJ can never surpass MJ because he has too many moments where he quit on his team.  2010 against the Celtics, 2011 in the Finals (although it was more of a disappearing act), end of 2014 Finals, last game of 2017 Finals.  As amazing as he is, that's too many times for a player of his stature. * Karl Malone is not as great as his records suggest.  He was very good for a very long time.  He struggled in clutch moments and he was fortunate that he had stability in Sloan and Stockton for most of his career.  He never had to jockey for position on his own team as he was the undisputed featured player every year and had an unselfish co-star.  Being the primary scoring option for the team + no injuries + a lot of years = impressive totals.   * Antoine Walker is a failed cyborg from the future who went back in time to play basketball in the early 2000s NBA."
"Incredible how the warriors took the raptors to 6 that series     finished Houston off, swept Portland and took the raptors to six games despite Klay missing game 3 and getting injured in game 6 when he had 27 points with over a full quarter to play and beginning to heat up considering they had no bench and nobody to fill in that Harrison Barnes/Kevin Durant role   Pretty incredible what Curry-Draymond-Klay-Kerr can do   Imagine James Harden getting injured and the rockets still almost won a title without him or if the bucks lost all their depth but somehow they still get to game 6 of the NBA finals despite Giannis getting injured early in the playoffs and Bledsoe having two different injuries in the finals    It sounds almost unthinkable but the warriors did it"
"Dame was taking a trash Portland team to close to the playoffs this year and he took a trash Portland team to the third round last year. Portland's third best player was Enes Kanter, give me a break.   Dame and Ayton would accomplish a lot more even with Ayton being like, 20. The fact that Booker isn't sniffing the playoffs, but Ja Morant is this season, is an indictment on Booker's abilities.  If you look at those number one options who don't excel, you see a ton of individual accomplishments but only one whose winning at the end of the season. I think that's no accident, Steph was a transformational figure in the game, the rest are covering his shadow. That said, if you put Steph on the Rockets, I'm not sure he's doing MUCH better than Harden would (he would do marginally better than Harden does, IMO)  I'd also say that the real reason the Warriors won as much in the past three seasons before this one is because KEVIN DURANT AND KLAY THOMPSON WERE AND ARE ON THE TEAM, TWO GUYS WHO BECAME TWO WAY PHENOMS. I think it's no stretch to say that individually, BOTH of those players would equal what Jimmy Butler accomplished this season, provided the situation changed."
"You didn't even respond to my main point, which is that the CP3 Kobe Bron KD Duncan squad are elite ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. That matters in basketball yo. And that is why I'd be concerned about that squad. Charles Barkley, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird were not great defenders. So please explain to me who they are going to match up with. Hakeem has to guard Duncan, and he'll be busy as hell with that. Who in the hell is going to guard Kevin Durant? Larry Bird? Barkley? They'll get annihilated. Who is going to guard Lebron? Jordan pretty much has to guard Kobe. They'd have to put Charles Barkely on Lebron and that would be a nightmare. Imagine Lebron and KD running a two man pick n roll game with Larry Bird and Charles Barkley as the two defenders, that'd be an absolute joke every single time."

Within hours of the article’s publication last week, that hypothetical move rippled through the blogosphere, delighting Golden State fans who view Antetokounmpo as the ideal prize after a league-worst season. Never mind that the trade in question was wholly unrealistic. As they near their second month without sports because of the coronavirus pandemic, many fans are desperate for something — anything — to command their attention.   But even though Milwaukee would require a much better haul than Wiggins and three draft picks to part with Antetokounmpo, it might have to start considering offers for him in coming months. Trading Antetokounmpo for a package of assets would be far more palatable than letting him leave as an unrestricted free agent in 2021 if he declines the Bucks’ supermax extension this summer — a five-year deal that could be worth $254 million.  Though all indications are that he’s on good terms with team management, league sources believe that Antetokounmpo would want out of Milwaukee if he loses confidence in the franchise’s ability to win championships. This is why the NBA shutdown could buoy the Warriors’ chances of landing their long-coveted Greek.  When play was suspended March 11, the Bucks were a league-best 53-12. A canceled postseason — a distinct possibility given the slew of obstacles the NBA must overcome to resume play — would rob Milwaukee of a shot at its first title since 1971. There are no guarantees that the Bucks again will avoid major injury next season.  If the NBA is able to have the playoffs, it almost certainly would need to shorten each series to a maximum of five games. That ups the odds of an upset. Should Milwaukee — fresh off a long hiatus — get ousted in an abbreviated first or second round, Antetokounmpo might be be less likely to ink his extension this year.  The Bucks will do whatever they can to keep the face of their franchise long-term, but they recognize that the Warriors could offer probably the best package if Antetokounmpo decides he wants to leave. As last week’s Bleacher Report story suggested, Golden State can dangle Wiggins, a 2020 first-round pick expected to fall no lower than No. 5, Minnesota’s top-3-protected 2021 first-rounder and the Warriors’ 2022 first-rounder.  What would separate Golden State from other suitors, however, is that it could include Klay Thompson or Draymond Green in any potential trade. That would be a steep price, especially if the Bucks make Antetokounmpo available this offseason. Parting with multiple lottery picks, a starting small forward (Wiggins) and a cornerstone of an NBA dynasty (Thompson or Green) is quite a risk to acquire someone entering the final year of his contract.  But according to a league source, the Warriors have been preparing for years to make a bid for Antetokounmpo. General manager Bob Myers knows that to chart a course for long-term greatness, a team must maintain flexibility — both in terms of its roster and future assets.  By orchestrating a complex sign-and-trade last summer with Brooklyn for guard D’Angelo Russell, the Warriors got younger while obtaining a key trade chip. In February, when negotiating the deal that sent Russell to the Timberwolves, Myers made sure that Minnesota included a lightly protected pick in what’s expected to be a loaded 2021 draft.  This is the same type of advanced planning that helped the Warriors land Kevin Durant in free agency in July 2016.  To add Durant, the Warriors needed to clear enough space to accommodate his two-year, $54.3 million contract. Now, as it waits to see whether Antetokounmpo signs his extension with Milwaukee, Golden State reckons it has stockpiled enough assets to get it on the phone with Bucks general manager Jon Horst should Antetokounmpo become available.  And the asking price would be staggering. Last summer, to acquire Anthony Davis after he publicly demanded a trade from New Orleans, the Lakers gave up Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks — including the No. 4 overall pick in the 2019 draft (De’Andre Hunter). As special as Davis is, Antetokounmpo is better. This is someone who, at just 25, is well-positioned for his second straight MVP award. With Thompson, Green and Stephen Curry each in his early 30s, Antetokounmpo represents a chance for the Warriors to follow the Spurs’ model for sustained success.  It’s easy for Golden State to envision Antetokounmpo forming the league’s most daunting tandem alongside Curry, whom he already considers a friend. The two share an agency and in March, when asked to name his five favorite players in NBA history, Antetokounmpo twice named Curry. Three weeks later, Antetokounmpo chose the Warriors for a game of NBA 2K20 and touted Curry as “the OG.”  Such praise amplified the chatter surrounding Antetokounmpo and Golden State. What makes this Giannis-to-Warriors speculation intriguing, however, is that it’s not merely fantasy.  As ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne said on “The Jump” in September, Golden State has “always been the big threat” to the Bucks in the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes. Last week, when he tweeted that “chasing greatness is a life mission,” Antetokounmpo left little room for interpretation.  He will do whatever he must do to win at the highest level, even if that means leaving the team that drafted him for one fresh off a dynasty."
"2002 team is pretty damn stacked and balanced. I know the 2003 team gets more love, but having Kidd to run the offense instead of KG out there makes this team more well-rounded.  F: Tim Duncan   F: Tracy McGrady   C: Shaquille O'Neal   G: Kobe Bryant   G: Jason Kidd  Also, I know this is kinda cheating, but a revised version of the 2016 All-NBA teams would produce a really dominant lineup.  F: LeBron James  F: Kawhi Leonard  C: DeAndre Jordan ==&gt; Draymond Green  G: Stephen Curry  G: Russell Westbrook ==&gt; Kevin Durant  Draymond could knock down 3s that year and played DPOY level defense in the playoffs and regular season. I know people are going to clamor about Hakeem cooking him, but damn this lineup would be God-level small ball play."
"The 2 slot is a cursed pick. Evan Turner was a 2nd pick too, and while he’s better than MKG, he isn’t what you’d expect from pick that high.  Edit: from 2003, here are notably bad 2 picks with players picked close after them that were great  03: Darko Milicic (Melo, DWade, Bosh)  05: Marvin Williams (Deron Williams, CP3)  07: Kevin Durant (ha you thought)  08: Michael Beasley (Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, and in fairness this pick was 100% justifiable at the time)  09: Hasheem Thabeet (Harden, Curry, DeMar)  10: Evan Turner (Boogie, Hayward, PG13, damn this draft class had some awful injury luck)  11: Derrick Williams (Valanciunas, Klay, Kawhi, in fairness this draft class is more backloaded than most as Tobias Harris and Jimmy Butler also fell really far)  12: MKG (Beal, Lillard, Barnes/Drummond)  13: Jabari Parker (Embiid, Aaron Gordon, in fairness this was also an entirely justifiable pick at the time, but curses don’t care about justifiability)  17: Lonzo (Lonzo is the *FURTHEST THING FROM A BUST*, but that being said, I would prefer Tatum, Fox and Mitchell over him for the foreseeable future, though he’s in a great place in New Orleans rn)  18: Marvin Bagley (I love Bagley, but same as above, you would def rather have Luka or Trae Young rn, though I also still think he’s on track to become an All-Star level player in the future and will justify his pick slot).  If you wanna go further back in time, Bowie was the 2nd pick between Hakeem and MJ, and Barkley and Stockton went off the board in the first round. Justifiable motivation for picking him at the time, but oof."
I want Giannis to do what Kevin Durant did for OKC  come get a taste of the danforth daddy
Just like that all time super competitor Kevin Durant! It's really the hardest road.
"Curry built the position he was in. If Lebron had built a team culture the way that Curry had, he he may have had a prime Kevin Durant join him, or perhaps could have uplifted a JJ Hickson into stardom or kept a Larry Hughes from puttering out"
Yeah yeah Kevin Durant
"**2014-15:**  F: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers  F: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  C: Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies  G: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  G: James Harden, Houston Rockets  **2014-15 with a healthy Kevin Durant at F and Davis at C:**  F: LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers  F: Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder  C: Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans  G: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors  G: James Harden, Houston Rockets  That would be the best shooting team of all time right there.  Soft on guard defense, but able to switch everything."

"To me, I lost significant interest in the Warriors story in 2016. Becoming complacent and blowing a massive lead and then signing Kevin Durant and winning two more rings with no one threatening them."
"This is a fun idea:  1) Golden State Warriors: Michael Jordan. It's very tempting to take Wilt, Russell, or Shaq here, but you can't pass up MJ. It would be incredible to watch him attack with the spacing Curry and Thompson would provide.   2) Cleveland Cavaliers: Wilt Chamberlain. Cleveland has some talent, but they aren't set at any positions. Lots of players could go here, but Wilt is the best on the board.  3) Minnesota Timberwolves: Larry Bird. With Towns and Russell locking down the PG and Centre position, Bird fits in greatly at the wing.  4) Atlanta Hawks: Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Sure they have Capela, but let's get real here, some people still consider KAJ to be the greatest with valid reasoning. So even though they are weaker in other positions, Kareem and Trae could be the highest scoring duo in the league.  5) Detroit Pistons: Magic Johnson. Detroit is similar to Cleveland (since Griffin's future seems questionable with the injuries) in respect to not being set at any position. Magic is the best player on the board and could certainly turn the Pistons around.  6) New York Knicks: Bill Russell. This teams needs to reset their culture and what better player to do than Bill Russell?   7) Chicago Bulls: Shaq. We are talking prime Shaq here. He would demolish small ball lineups and really open the floor for White, Lavine, and Markkanen.  8) Charlotte Hornets: Tim Duncan. Charlotte needs all the help they can get and TD would be a great start. He could easily be the top centre in today's game and would have no trouble adjusting to the changes in the game.  9) Washington Wizards: Hakeem Olajuwon. Hakeem would complete a big 3 with Wall (assuming he's healthy) and Beal. They cover the three main positions and Hakeem could honestly be better in today's game than he was when he was playing.  10) Phoenix Suns: Kevin Garnett. Similar to New York, this teams needs someone who can embody a winning and passionate culture. You can't deny KG's passion for winning. KG has the skills to be both a modern day PF and C and is a good enough shooter he can share the floor with Ayton. KG wins mutliple DPOY awards in today's game.  11) San Antonio Spurs: Kobe Bryant. The Spurs are a weird team right and there's no perfect fit. But the Spurs are well aware of Kobe's abilities and I think he would fit better with DeRozan than most would think.  12) Sacramento Kings: Julius Erving. This team is weakest at the 3 and Erving is the best 3 on the board. This team has talent, but Erving gives them the consistent scoring they need night in and night out.   13) New Orleans Hornets: David Robinson. There are better players on the board, but Robinson fills the need. They have scoring with Ingram, Holiday, Redick, and Williamson. They have ball handlers and defensive wings with Holiday and Ball. Robinson is a defensive anchor who has definitely fit nicely next to Zion on offense.  14) Portland Trailblazers: Charles Barkley. Scottie Pippen fits very well here too, but this team is a bit weaker at the 4 (I'm not sold on Collins being a 4 in today's game) trying to Lillard, McCollum, and Barkley all from scoring will be a challenge for any team.  15) Orlando Magic: Oscar Robertson. As good as Fultz has been, this team could use an upgrade at the PG position. But there is enough size they could play together defensively. Robertson and Vucevic could be a deadly PnR combo.  16) Brooklyn Nets: Scottie Pippen. This team has all the scoring it needs with Irving and Durant. Pippen gives them a top notch defender who can be trusted to run the offense and score if Durant or Irving is out.  17) Memphis Grizzles: Dwyane Wade. Questionable fit next to Morant, but peak Wade is arguable a top 10 player. A team with two defenders quick enough to stay in front of Wade and Morant will be tough to find.  18) Dallas Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki. It would be wrong for him to end up anywhere else.  19) Indiana Pacers: Elgin Baylor. Baylor can play either F positions which is where this team needs the most help. Baylor is also as pure of scorer as anyone and the consistent 25 points a game is really what this team needs.  20) Philadelphia 76ers: Steve Nash. I'm in the camp that Ben Simmons is fine as the starting PG. Put shifting him to the 4 and having both Simmons and Nash playmaking abilities in the starting lineup would be a lot of fun. It could also allow Simmons to destroy team's second units off the dribble too. Nash helps this team in a lot of ways, but his elite shooting is why he's here and not Thomas or Stockton.  21) Houston: Ben Wallace. This will definitely be the most questionable pick. But anyone who watched Wallace play knows how good he was on defense and that he was the most important player on those Piston teams in the mid 2000s  (sorry Billups). While he doesn't have the spacing Houston is going for, he's the best defensive player available at a position they are in desperate need of help. They have all the offense they could possible need in Harden and Westbrook, they have shooters, they have defenders. The need an elite defensive big and they don't get more elite defensively than Ben Wallace.  22) OKC Thunder: Karl Malone. Malone provides excellent defense and will certainly be this team's top scorer.   23) Miami Heat: John Stockton. Stockton is arguably the second best PG of all-time and it goes to show how PG heavy the league is that he's at 23. This team as Dragic and Nunn, but you move those guys for a player the calibre of Stockton. He can match the intensity of Butler and no backcourt duo will be outworked.  24) Utah Jazz: Bob Pettit. These is a fit concern, but talent can overide fit, and Pettit has a lot of that. This Jazz team would give up few second chance opportunities and Pettit  can give them a low-post scoring threat they haven't seen since Malone (sorry Boozer).   25) Denver Nuggets: Jason Kidd. Kidd brings elite defense and allows Murray to focus more on scoring which is his best skill. As good as Jokic is, Kidd gives the offense a bit more unpredictability and raises the team's defense.  26) Boston Celtics: Moses Malone. Malone is of the best low-post scorers of all-time and would give the Celtics a threat to score from anywhere on the floor. He also helps this team greatly on the boards.  27) L.A Clippers: Gary Payton. Playing the Clippers would be a PG's nightmare. Payton might be the best defensive PG of all-time and then having Beverley come off the bench to guard you too? You could put a scoring big out there or even another shooter, but Payton/Leoard/George would be the best defensive perimeter trio ever seen and I wouldn't want to see that passed up.  28) Toronto Raptors: Patrick Ewing. Gasol is showing his age and while Ibaka has been playing great, throwing a talent like Ewing on this Raptor teams makes a repeat championship a likely scenario. Ewing has shown he can provide spacing, gives the team another scoring threat, and really helps on the boards.  29) L.A Lakers: Isiah Thomas. Again, Thomas being this low shows how deep the PG position is right now. Thomas will allow LeBron to play the 4 like he did in Miami and Davis can spend more time at the 5 depending on the match-up.   30) Milwaukee Bucks: Ray Allen. There are some more talented players, but Allen would fit in perfectly with Giannis/Middleton/Bledsoe/Lopez."
"This is false. 2006 Kobe had the 3rd highest scoring season per 100 possessions after 2019 Harden and 1987 MJ.  Also, scoring rate is not the only thing to consider when comparing scorers. Efficiency is very important.  2005-2006 Kobe Bryant  PTS/75 Possessions: 34.2 rTS%: +2.3  2013-2014 Kevin Durant PTS/75: 31.4 rTS%: +9.4"
Is kevin durant worth -9 wins
The warriors dynasty underachieved post Kevin Durant signing. Absolutely no one saw that team and thought they would win just 2 championships.
"Klay Thompson, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant"
"The obvious answer is Kevin Durant, but I actually think that 30 years from now, people will be debating ""was Kawhi actually better than LeBron? Kawhi has been absolutely dominant whenever he's okayed, the problem for him is staying on the floor."
Kevin Durant 100%. I'd go as far as to say that he was the best player in the league for the most of the 2nd half of the 2010s.
Kevin Durant
"It's completely irrelevant whether saying that Durant is insecure is ""new information"" or not. The Warriors being an all-time great team isn't new information either - but the stories that explain how and why are the reason the book exists. Without getting into the conflicting greatness and fragility of Kevin Durant, a book about the 2018-19 Warriors is just a bunch of box scores, injury reports, and press releases.  I'm curious, though - what level of flaw-highlighting and criticism do you consider fair game? For example, take Jackie MacMullin's latest piece about Ben Simmons and his refusal to shoot. She quotes people close to him directly and openly questioning his mental toughness and personality, based on publicly available evidence and their experiences with him. If that story had upset him, would it somehow be irresponsible or out of bounds?"
Warriors had worse record with Kevin Durant! Subtraction by addition! Sad!
Your Lauri is my Kevin Durant. I’ve broken a controller shit gets me so angry.

Kevin Durant doesn't like himself. What an amazing basketball player who really hasn't figured out life or how to be happy yet. Pathetic
That’s a weird way to spell Kevin Durant
"Was my first guess too, but I am bored and dug a little. Bradley center opened in the 88-89 season and Hodges was no longer on the Bucks. On the top of the screen is #44 Paul Mokeski, who only played till 89, so it perfectly narrows down the season.  I looks like it's Ewing and the Knicks as the opponent which they played twice at home that year.  Can't quite make out the jersey number of the shooter. But since there were few threes in that era the list is small. It's definitely not Jack Silma or Terry Cummings...so it makes it one of two Rick(e)ys, Rickey Pierce or Rickey Green. The stroke looks closer to Green's. Or I'm completely wrong and it's Kevin Durant.  Edit: Sikma not Silma"

I AM THE BEST I AM KEVIN DURANT
i’m using statistics and my own knowledge of both players’ game. when did durant have to guard the best player on a championship team? he played with all-defense guys from draymond to klay to ibaka to adams and even rotation guys like kanter. iverson was ripping from and sticking to elite guards while durant was guarding kevin love and chris bosh.
Do you think Kevin Durant sucked in Texas for never winning a championship then?
"When people think of Kevin Durant, they’ll think unstoppable scorer, but you’re crazy if you think people are going to forget him joining the 73-9 Warriors. That’s Patrick Ewing or Shaq joining the 72-10 Bulls in 1996."

"OKC was so close in 2012 and 2016.  Kevin Durant just didn't have the warrior leadership finisher quality of Lebron, Kobe, or I would say Chris Paul. Great player - not a champion."
"You’re out here criticizing Presti, but even until the stoppage, OKC is ahead of Houston in the rankings. So you can’t pull the trigger yet and say that Morey’s construction is better than Presti’s because as of now, Presti’s team is ahead.   Presti’s playing with a whole bunch of factors AGAINST him too. Free agents aren’t necessarily attracted to Oklahoma, outside of the main stars we’ve never really had great trade bait, and we’ve never really had the cap to improve because it was tied up in important stars and important role players. Sure, overpaying Roberson and even overpaying Adams aren’t great moves to look back at, but they were done and that can’t be changed.   Sabonis turned out to be solid, Oladipo turned out to be a stud, Melo was still playing at an All Star level when the trade was made for him, and once it was realized that he wasn’t the same, Presti dealt him and got Schröder.   He’s not perfect, and maybe he has cost the team some championship windows, but you can’t say he’s not trying to put the best product out there. Getting James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russ Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Dennis Schröder, Vic Oladipo, Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous Alexander, and Chris Paul to play for your organization in 12 years is super impressive. It’s not for a lack of trying."

"Well, if thats what were going with I am gonna pick Kevin Durant, and I would probably just let him do his thing because he is actually decent at basketball and already is incorporated into the league."
"2017 Cavs replacing Kevin Love with healthy Kwahi vs 2017 GSW who wins?  LeBron and Kawhi were even vs Curry and Durant, it was Love(1-9 in G3), DWill, Korver totally out classed."
"KD in 2012 played way more offball since we had multiple elite ballhandlers. He was pretty much the best offball player in the world back then. After Harden got traded and then Russ got injured he took on a ton of ballhandling responsibility and became pretty much the lead ballhandler. He improved massively as a player but it did hurt his efficiency against tough defences in the playoffs like for example that Russ-less campaign where we got ousted by the Grizzlies in round 2.   By 2016, partly because of trash coaching from Brooks, KD's efficient off ball game was pretty much slashed in half and he had to create a lot of his shots off the dribble or in iso situations. Obviously he could do that because he's Kevin Durant but it isn't ideal for anyone to make them rely more and more on difficult shots because you can't figure out how to get them the easy ones anymore. His regular season efficiency didn't hurt much because he just got so much better at Iso'ing and getting his off the dribble, but it def wasn't ideal for the playoffs.   And yeah you're right he could just shoot over players but he didn't have the post game to just back people down or the spacing to put down the ball a few times and get to an easy shot. Especially when Brooks just got him the ball in a post up situation in no mans land 20 feet from the basket and called it a day."

"""Russell Westbrook would average a triple double if he played for the sixers""  Flashback to the 2014-2015 NBA season. MCW was averaging 14.6/5.3/6.7 in his sophomore season, however he was generally regarded as an empty stats player.  Kevin Durant was out for most of the season, only playing 27 games on the season.  In KD's absence, Russ, who was regarded as a ballhog who should be playing SG, KD's sidekick, and a finals choker, put up 28.1/7.3/8.6 in his first season as the number 1 option.  I was telling everyone who would listen at my high school/in the BR comment section that Westbrook would easily average a triple double on the sixers if MCW can put up 14.6/5.3/6.7. I got soooo shat on though, Oscar Rob's triple double season was something mythical akin to Wilt's 100-point game, no one thought it could be replicated in the modern NBA."

Curry would need a second or even third 2016-esque campaign and a clear FMVP imo to surpass  Kevin Durant vs Julius Erving   * I think the general consensus is Kevin Durant was the better player, but won his rings on a super team. Dr. J DID play alongside two HoFers, but they werent a 73-9 team prior. I really dont have an opinion on this just stating the arguments (KD probably will unequivocally outrank him after retirement)  Pete Maravich vs James Harden   * Harden. Even though Maravich is one of those forgotten legends, Harden is a different fucking beast.  EDIT:   Shaquille O'neil vs Tim Duncan   * This is the hardest by far. Both are usually ranked close to Bird. I'd probably go Shaq but wouldnt hold it against you if you go Timmy D"

"2013 playoffs OKC vs memphis  6 players who logged the most minutes in the series.  Durant   Reggie Jackson  Ibaka  Kevin Martin  Derrrick fisher  Perkins  sefolosha    3 pt % of each player  Reggie Jackson-21%  Ibaka -50% (only 6 attempts all series)  Kevin Martin - (35% on a little over 2 a game)  Derrrick fisher- 39%  sefolosha- 20%   Where is the elite shooter or spacing? Where is the player the defense respects? OkC had no floor spacing or shooting for the majority of their run. They were still successful 4 WCF trips in 6 years, but roster wasnt modern which ultimately affected KD and westbrooks effciency.  The shooting %'s are even more dire against the Spurs the following year. Caron butler shot sub 25%, westbrook shot 28%, as did jeremy lamb.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2014-nba-western-conference-finals-thunder-vs-spurs.html  OKC used KD as a floor spaced and often times their only respectable shooter........  I’m not saying KD didn’t benefit from warriors spacing but thunder spacing didn’t benefit him. He’s obviously not 65 TS good, but he’s not 57 TS bad either. More so would be at 60 TS with decent spacing  A great example is His 2012 run, That roster Had atleast one perimeter player with weak-side gravity.  (harden) and KD torched every defense that entire playoff run. Z"
Patient confidentiality.   Marcus smart announced it himself Kevin Durant himself  only players who say it themselves are named.
Everybody in attendance is dressed formal and here’s Kevin Durant in a t-shirt
 PG: Marcus Smart   SG: Donovan Mitchell   SF: Kevin Durant   PF: Christian Wood   C: Rudy Gobert
"&gt; 1.When you say ""brings the ball down"" what does that mean? I'm guessing it means they talk the ball from the defensive half into the oppositions half  Correct  &gt; 2.what do you mean that the pf plays ""down low""?  &gt; Im guessing wings stand outside the paint and either shoot 3s or pass the the bigs. The bigs are mainly dunkers. And the point plays as a defender mainly and feeds the ball forward to the other players. Is this right?  Not sure what you mean by ""point as defender"", but whenever possession changes due to a missed shot or live turnover, the PG is always the first guy back on defense. The other bits are correct  Forgot to note: sample of current players at each position. Most of them play differently from the classic definitions of each position  PG  - Chris Paul - classic PG  - Steph Curry - his green light to shoot from anywhere is unprecedented  - Ben Simmons - super-tall for a PG, can't shoot from the outside to defend his life  SG  - Paul George - classic SG, plays SF sometimes  - James Harden - prior to this year played like a PG  - Jayson Tatum  - Kobe Bryant - late in his career he played close to the basket like a big man  SF  - Kawhi Leonard - classic SF, plays SG sometimes  - LeBron James - plays like a PG  - Kevin Durant - as tall as a C, plays like a SG   PF  - Anthony Davis  - Giannis - handles the ball most of the time  - Draymond Green   C  - Joel Embiid  - Nikola Jokic - plays like a PG as being a conduit of the offense  - Rudy Gobert"
Six Degrees of Kevin Durant
"Sefolosha- Bad shooter.  Caron Butler (Limited playing time, Not a starter, Bad shooter in OKC) Kevin Martin( Again relatively poor shooter in the playoffs) Derrick fisher ( 38 years old, Bad shooter in OKC, Limited playing time)  Durant Never had 1 elite shooter in his team with the thunder rim the playoffs, The year he did (Harden) he posted 61 Ts% against 4 elite defenses (LAL, Mavs, HEAT, Spurs).......  I’m not saying he didn’t benefit from Warriors spacing....he did But of he played with Bradley Beal or Klay Thompson in OKC, Then His TS would be around 60 TS....."
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and maybe Damian Lillard. I'd include Doncic as well but it's only his second season."
My friend is black. So you’re saying theres a chance he could be Kevin Durant?
"Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis are the same height, length, and not far off in weight. Davis was a defensive monster in college and Durant was an offensive one."
"Our strongest team ever lost in the finals? How could they be the strongest team ever if they hadn’t even added Kevin Durant yet?  Also, when you say “nearly lost two different times with KD”, are you saying Spurs losing Kawhi after half a game in game 1 is the same as the Rockets losing CP3 at the end of game 5?"
"What I do have reason to believe is that this virus spreads just like a cold virus.  It can live on cold, dead surfaces for days, be airborne, and enter the body immediately and reproduce at immense speeds.  Just like every other covid before it, it's virtually impossible to stop it.  Especially with the habits humans now have with their cell phones.  What's more, these viruses have a tendency to not inflict symptoms on humans for for awhile, some have said up to 20 days with covid 19.  I can promise you that people were traveling to the US from China with the virus before China even knew they had an outbreak on their hands.  I can promise you that almost the entirety of NYC has been exposed to it, myself included.  I know that there's no way to get an actual number on it but we know how these viruses work and we know how people work and we know that the number of people exposed is obviously much, much higher than the number of ""infected"".  How's Tom hanks doing?  Idris Elba?  Kevin Durant?  You think somehow Tom hanks that has one of the cleanest and exclusive lifestyles on the planet got it but most of us didn't?  Here let me fix what else you said real quick  &gt;hospitals are being overwhelmed because people are running to the hospital with non threatening conditions because they were scared to death by me saying that this was going to be the worst plague our generation had ever seen.  Also, why not talk about how even at this overwhelmed hospitals they are seeing like 90% success rates or higher?  Why not mention that?  Why do you want this to be so bad?  Why lie to make it sound worse than it is?"

Then tell them the Seahawks won a superbowl that they missed and also the team owner died of cancer. Then tell them the mariners still haven't made the playoffs since 2001 and probably won't this year and also the Astros are now in the AL west. Then tell them Donald Trump is president. Then tell them analingus is very popular. Then tell them that Seattle is getting an NHL team and also Vegas got one a few years ago. THEN hit them with their team leaving.  By the time you get to the mariners they are willing to believe you are telling the truth about the previous stuff, the ass eating and trump stuff is to just warm them up to the idea that the world is changing, and then the NHL team is a classic good-news bad news"

"Wilkins arguably wasn’t even top 5 directly before the injury, so I don’t get the relevance of that point. He came back to form averaging 30 when he returned. And his game was much less predicated on a jumpshot than Kevin Durant. He was literally playing in the heart of Jordan’s prime lmao.   It’s not about a narrative, I just explained to you my own thoughts. There’s no “definition” when it comes to Achilles ruptures. The history of Achilles injuries is filled with older players, bigger players, and role players. Not one fits the exact mold of Kevin Durant.   Only players that returned from Achilles injuries that where arguable top 5 talents are Kobe and Wilkins. One of which returned completely to form.   Calling it a “miracle” would be ridiculous, players in other leagues have also done it lmao. Stop."

Bruh did you just call Kevin fucking Durant average at any point of his career
&gt;Kevin Durant is better than Tim Duncan was at basketball.  Hope you get that brain surgery soon my friend. Godspeed.
"Just can't imagine what is going through the mind of someone who takes a maybe in Greg Oden over the guarantee of Kevin Durant. I can at least respect that you're a risk taker, but man that's a stupid bet.  Kevin Durant is better than Tim Duncan was at basketball. Sorry you had to find out this way."
"My guy, you are literally naming personality and fucking marketability. This is the same dude who helped make a market in OKC relevant for near a decade, but the slight gap in jersey sales is what makes you pick him over skill.   Then you use the worst argument you can use against KD: mental fucking toughness. All the burner accounts, the tweets back and forth, all the crying about the media, and guess what it leads to? Scoring. Defense. Rebounding. Winning.   Kevin Durant despite being sensitive has NEVER EVER EVER EVER NEVER shown any signs of weak mental toughness while actually playing the game of basketball. While fans booed him, called him a cupcake, attacked his mother, had signs on top of signs on top of signs slandering him when he went back to OKC, he dropped 40. Twice.   Whole world was tweeting snake and all that shit to him, me included. And what did he do in the Finals? Have one of the most efficient Finals performances of all fucking time.   That argument is just garbage. Who cares about mental toughness unless it actually affects your play. KD is a historically clutch player, has historically performed in the playoffs, and his blimps with his play have never been connected to the media or whatever scrutiny he’s getting.   So don’t try that casual shit when you’re literally using a narrative as the basis of your argument, and ignoring the actual facts that are on the table lmao.   “Personality” man gtfo of here LMAOOOO"
"You’re missing the point. The comment I am replying to says with Kevin Durant and Klay it would “easily” be a sweep.   This is just evidence that the statement is pure fiction.   Here is just one game with Steph, Klay, and Durant all playing and losing. Oh and in case you didn’t notice Kawhi didn’t even play."
kevin Durant is indeed a great response to ur question tho
&gt; once again kevin Durant is game changing compared to andre igoudala looney cook jerabko and whoever else was on that team.  Are you okay? I’m telling you Durant played in both the Clippers and Rockets series and they both took it to 6.  &gt; and ur point ? the amount of games it takes to dispatch ur opposing side shouldn't matter because each round is different  Why wouldn’t it matter? If an inferior team can take them to 6 games there is no logical reason to believe the Raptors would get swept.

"&gt;Kevin Durant might be the most lethal offensive weapon ever  KD is maybe top 3 as a pure scorer, but he's very mediocre/poor as a facilitator to be even regarded as a 'lethal offensive weapon'.   &gt;KD joined up with the 73-9 Warriors just to get a ring and help Steph to take down LBJ.  Curry already beaten LeBron in NBA Finals 2015 before KD joined his team.  &gt;Never before had the 2nd and 3rd best player in the league teamed up and it was all due to LeBron’s gravity.  Eh, have you forgotten Wade &amp; LeBron joining up in Miami Heat to take down KG &amp; his Boston Celtics?  &gt;LeBron is the main reason KD isn’t in the GOAT conversation.  What's KD's case for being on same level as Michael Jordan even if we remove LeBron from equation?  &gt;He probably wins in 2012 as the undisputed best player on his team and in the world if not for LeBron. The Thunder stay together and probably form a dynasty. Harden and Westbrook become champions.  OKC not winning a title is more down to cheap ownership who refused to pay luxury tax to contend than LeBron."

"Shit, KD used to join the HORSE tournament every year till it was cancelled. IMO, HORSE should be held in the highest regard, and should be the top tier shooting trophy. Have it before or after the dunk contest since that night of ASW has so much filler.  I think that would be more likely to draw interest from bigger stars, and would be the dunk contest equivalent to the three point contest. The only problem with HORSE is, in the modern era of ASW, I seem to remember it usually devolving into Kevin Durant and the other competitor just trading 30 foot straight on jumpers instead of taking any risks. Now, if you go back to the days of Pistol Pete vs The Iceman himself, George Gervin, that's what they should be aiming for."
"&gt; So what I’m trying to get at is what makes someone able to palm a ball effectively? Hand/forearm strength? Specific finger dexterity? Finger length relative to palm size? I’d like to see some data on this.  It's a little of column hand-size, a little of column ""pinch-grip"" strength, and a dash of technique. You need to be able to have the strength to pinch each of your fingers at once, and you need big enough hands to bring the pinch points as close as possible to require less strength. Obviously there are those who (had :( ) have the enough pinch grip to palm a ball with baby hands on an adult, and those who have big hands and are strong people but don't have the pinch or technique down, [like KD](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2218531-kevin-durant-says-he-cant-palm-a-basketball).  I have no stats, but that is how I remember it in Sports Illustrated for kids back in like 1991."
"Are you guys just forgetting who Kevin Durant is?  He had basically no issues on OKC. He had no issues with golden state outside of a Draymond problem, which was entirely the fault of Dray. And he hasn’t done a thing with the Nets yet.   All teams have drama. KD is just way more transparent AFTER leaving the team."
"Even better idea: a Coronavirus team vs a healthy Cavs. I posted this in a separate post, but the star power of two A-list actors would make this unstoppable. Who wins?  PG: Idris Elba  SG: Donovan Mitchell  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Christian Wood  C: Rudy Gobert  Bench: Mystery Nets Players  X-Factor: Tom Hanks"

That kevin durant 4 point play was insane
Kevin Durant might be the most lethal offensive weapon ever and yet his whole career he’s been in the shadow of LeBron. KD joined up with the 73-9 Warriors just to get a ring and help Steph to take down LBJ. Never before had the 2nd and 3rd best player in the league teamed up and it was all due to LeBron’s gravity. LeBron is the main reason KD isn’t in the GOAT conversation. He probably wins in 2012 as the undisputed best player on his team and in the world if not for LeBron. The Thunder stay together and probably form a dynasty. Harden and Westbrook become champions. Maybe the Warriors don’t form their own dynasty due to this.   Tim Duncan probably goes 6-0 in the finals and is easily considered the best player of his generation over Shaq and Kobe if not for LeBron as well. Might even be even the GOAT conversation with that record.  Maybe Rose makes the finals his MVP season and  even if he loses nobody blames him for that loss since he’s young and went up against a great team in the Mavs. Rose is elevated to Iverson status for being both the youngest MVP and carrying them to the Finals in the same season.   Oh and lastly there’s the obvious fact that LeBron ruined what would have been the greatest season ever by the Warriors in 2016. Steph might already be in the GOAT conversation if not for LeBron as well.   So in conclusion get that mess out of here. I still have Jordan above LeBron but LeBron’s career isn’t over yet. If he wins a ring or 2 in LA and retires with the all time scoring record he’s going to be right there with Jordan.

Kevin Durant fucking smacked his tight little boy ass so hard. Fuck.
"The quote literally is ""tests should not be for the wealthy, but for the sick"". He's not saying ""poor sick people first"". He is saying ""tests should not be for the wealthy"". Some of the wealthy ARE sick, like Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert, and they interact with hundreds of fans and teammates and team staff all the time, so yes, I believe they should be tested, along with everyone who needs a test. That's not what he's saying. He's saying it doesn't matter that wealthy people are also sick, they still shouldn't get tested because poor people are also sick and tests should go to the poor. Right now, wealthy people have access and poor people don't. He's suggesting that poor people should have access instead of wealthy people. The problem persists either way, with one of the groups not being tested. I'm saying there needs to be a way to test everyone instead of having to decide whether poor people or rich people have exclusive access to testing, and yet I'M being unreasonable."

Aaron Rodgers - James Harden (Great players who are extremely talented, but are known for being the best at getting free plays.)

&gt;Kevin Durant would be laughed at even more than he is now after only winning one championship  Why? If he won a ring with OKC against the Heatles he'd probably get a lot of respect  And wouldn't it be 2 rings because technically he'd get one with the warriors vs raps
"Implying that he won't be when ppl like Kevin Durant, James Harden and Steph Curry retire, and start to climb up these lists of all time greats?

"there were rumors the entire year about him going to GS. here is what i could find:       Feb 2nd:  https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/2/2/10898196/kevin-durant-warriors-rumors-free-agent-thunder        May 2015:  https://thunderousintentions.com/2015/05/02/kevin-durant-rumors-is-golden-state-an-option-for-kd/     &gt;It’s going to be a long, bumpy ride leading up to Kevin Durant‘s impending free agency so we might as well get used to it.  The latest rumor on Durant’s options following the 2015-2016 season involve the Golden State Warriors. It would appear that Golden State, one of the best team’s in the NBA this past season, is looking to improve even more and will target Durant once he becomes a free agent next summer.  Who started the rumor? None other that retired NBA player Mychal Thompson, father of current NBA All-Star – and Warriors player – Klay Thompson.  The elder Thompson, a sportscaster in Los Angeles, spoke about Durant in a recent show for ESPN LA 710. As per this post from WarriorsWorld.net, here’s what Thompson said:  “I also heard it on good authority from a team that plays in the Bay Area that they’re going to go hard after Kevin Durant.”"
"&gt; then why were they recruiting him the entire year even before the finals?  Can I ask where you heard this?  Obviously the Warriors weren't doing it (tampering laws), but if you are suggesting the players were doing anything more than the casual ""whazzup"" between friends, then it's news to me (Draymond himself said [he wasn't recruiting him until July 1st](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/kevin-durant-draymond-green-warriors-thunder-video).)"

This is the same guy that was talking shit to Kevin Durant in Game 1 of the playoffs as an 8th seed vs the Warriors while down 20 in the 4th quarter.
The biggest “winner” of this entire COVID shutdown of the NBA: **Kevin Durant.**  Especially if the league refreshes the records whenever they begin/continue the next season.

"I'd say you can only say that Curry deserved two FMVPs max. Kevin Durant was a machine in 2017. A lot of what made him able to perform like that was Curry's effect on opposing defenses, but he still deserved that 100%."
1. LeBron James  2. Steph Curry  3. Kevin Durant  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Russell Westbrook  7. Chris Paul  8. Paul George  9. Klay Thompson  10. Dirk Nowitzki  Gotta include Dirk for carrying that 2011 championship run. I'd put DWade and Dwight Howard in the previous decade. Dwight's peak was relatively short.
"Kevin Durant also has led the league in scoring while with the Thunder, the other guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about. MJ accomplished this because he’s the GOAT, Harden won’t because he’s not, simple as that."
"1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant 4. Chris Paul 5. James Harden 6. Kwahi Leonard 7. Russell Westbrook 8. Paul George 9. Klay Thompson 10. Kyrie Irving  2nd and 3rd can switch, 4th to 7th can switch.    I will have Curry over Durant because I feel like the 73 win Warriors was so iconic. I also feel like Kawhi didn't play enough game, but I can see people put it as high as 4th.   Other Options:   1. Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard   Just need a few more space 2. Antony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Kemba Walker   They were losing games  3. Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan, John Wall   They were winning games, they will be in the ""Hall of Very Good"" 4. Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Dewayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Steve Nash, Manu Ginobili, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams   They still had some great years, but they all fell off in the second half of the decade, like having troubles to make the playoffs 5.  Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid    They are only relevant in the second half of the decade"
I read this as &gt;&gt;Could Joe Exotic  have *conceived* Kevin Durant  And actually thought i missed something. If you haven't watched this already this show gets crazy
I kinda like this list. It's the top 10 in VORP for the playoffs from 2009-10 to 2018-19 combined.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Draymond Green  7. Chris Paul  8. Dwyane Wade  9. Russell Westbrook  10. Al Horford  Now I'd take off Draymond and Horford and replace them with Lowry and Dame I think and then shuffle it a bit. Maybe something like.  1. LeBron James  2. Kevin Durant  3. Stephen Curry  4. Kawhi Leonard  5. James Harden  6. Chris Paul  7. Russell Westbrook  8. Dame Lillard  9. Dwyane Wade  10. Kyle Lowry
Kevin Durant would kill in the 80”s good lord.imagine Durant being able to clear out because of illegal defense and go 1 v 1 forget about it. Durant would be in The goat Debate if he played in the 80”s
"I question your wisdom. You’re  telling me that the super stacked team of Miami, their game plan wasn’t to stop A starting Westbrook, or the unstoppable Kevin Durant, but the 2nd string bench player? And of course he’d have better percentages when he’s not taking 100 shots a game. Also he cleaned up with fast break points. He should have been starting sure, but regardless how many 2nd string players offensive or defensive were as good as a young harden?"
Is Kevin Durant the nbas Carole Baskins? Should we mail him snakes?
You realize half the people in that documentary abused the shit out of animals  Joe hired a hit on Carole Baskin. Carole (probably) killed her husband and got away with it  Jeff Lowe  Doc Antle treats his animals probably the best out of anyone in the documentary and he's the ring leader of a sex cult...  Kevin Durant just plays basketball

Wasn’t there a similar movie with Kevin Durant that came out years ago?
“Kevin Durant isn’t even an above average player.”
"KD himself liked it   &gt;Kevin Durant tells me it was a ""total accident"" that he liked a comment on Instagram about Russell Westbrook. Was just an honest mistake.  https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/988516403706609664  I totally believe him, 100%, never seen a more honest guy"
"**Kevin Durant the type of guy to think of the perfect comeback the morning after he was roasted by his homies.**  Why was that in bold? idk, I copy n pasted from a roast on someone elose it that’s prolly y"
"I think the biggest British player is OG Anunoby who is like the 3rd best guy for the Toronto Raptors, plus they're the only international team if either of those matter, and they're the defending champions.    I'd say the most popular players (much more a star driven sport than other team sports) in terms of playstyle are Steph Curry (Golden State Warriors) and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (both Brooklyn Nets), all were injured this season so neither team is particularly impressive but next season they should both be better.  Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee), James Harden (Houston), and LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers) are the three best players, Giannis is the most athletically gifted player in the NBA, James Harden is the best scorer, and LeBron is a very well-rounded player with the legacy of being the best player in the NBA for basically a decade.  Luke Doncic for the Dallas Mavericks looks to be like he'll be the best player in the world in a few years and he's only 20, so you might enjoy watching his rise over the next few years.  Zion Williamson for New Orleans Pelicans is the #1 rookie last season and he mostly missed this season, but in the 19 games he did look to play, he is a very unique exciting player that looks to be one of the most unstoppable scorers close to the basket and is still a teenager.  Orlando is a pretty defensive minded team, so their playstyle isn't probably the most exciting thing to watch, they're a small market so no one will talk about them, and they don't have any particularly exciting stars, so even their players don't get much discussion.   I personally just enjoy the NBA as a league than rooting for specific teams.  About half the league I root for and half I don't, but I just watch whatever games are on usually instead of trying to schedule my life around just watching the Cavaliers or someone play."
Ah I remember when Rudy Gay was still a poor man’s Kevin Durant
"Thanks for admitting you don’t watch basketball and just look at stats. He was a great defender. Don’t believe me? Believe Kevin durant, Kobe Bryant and others who I have video calling a great defender from that time"
"But I put his stats before GS up there for comparison I don't see why you're being so hostile. Harden just plain isn't as effecient as Kevin fucking Durant lol. And I get you, his team was loaded bla bla bla, but can we just not count 3 years of someone's career because they had good teammates? What about Larry Bird? Magic? Tim Duncan? All had multiple HOF teammates. If we were to compare Steph Curry's stats as well would I only be able to use his stats pre kd as well? Can't just act like three years of ball didn't happen."
"Russell Westbrook, Marcus Smart, Kevin Durant, Embiid. That's just big names that will get media coverage. Basically the entire NBA players have sent PSA tweets to spread awareness. The money right now will be needed to clean up stuff. Just wait until it's over and families that are without jobs and over things like that then is when the money will be needed. Then even more players will donate. Plus I am sure the NBA will dump off a good chunk of money to help, and that money may be coming from players salaries."
1. 2007 Cavs weren't going to beat the 2007 Spurs 2. Mavs completely outplayed them and shell shocked them. Bron didn't play well. 3. Spurs were one of the best teams. That 12/13 and 13/14 team was absolutely crazy to watch. 4. 2014/15 Warriors were 3pt shooting gods. Also injuries to Kyrie and K-Love played an impact 5. 2016/17 - Adding Kevin Durant to a godly team will do that. 6. 2017/18 - Keeping Kevin Durant in a godly team will do that.
Kevin Durant is well known.
"Curry was not better in 3 out of the four games. Please end this narrative.   Kevin Durant was statistically more impressive, while also guarding LeBron James.   Stop."
"""*Hardest road?  I'll show you the hardest road...*"" - Kevin Durant"
"i agree, and also the following year the Cavs were insanely unbelievably good.  just.....fuckin Kevin Durant man  it is a SHAME that the 2017 Cavs playoff run will be mostly forgotten"
Kevin Durant should take 24 shots per game and it upsets me that he never does
Despite Durant’s off-court antics and personality you can’t deny this man is one of the best basketball players of this generation. Look up “Kevin Durant Rucker Park” if you haven’t already.
"Because Draymond talks more trash then Kevin Durant, Steph and Klay combined. Hes easily the most vocal, which is fine, every team needs a guy like that but he flat out is the worst one on of the four, that's objective.. Hell end up being a hall of Famer and he was a great defender  but he brings good majority of criticism on himself by constantly getting flagrants, kicking guys in the balls, bitching out officials and just overall being a twat. If he had the demeanor of Tim Duncan he would probably be unanimously loved. He so deserves to get flack for the way hes playing this year"

Kevin Durant was a 86% ft shooter during the 2012 season. OKC lost home court advantage after this going up against the heatles superteam.
"This is the inside story of how Warriors forward Draymond Green is the player to lead the Warriors to a dynasty -- or the man who could stand in their way.  Editor's note: This story on Draymond Green was originally published on Oct. 19, 2016 and contains explicit language. Watch Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.  ALL IN ALL, it was not the best few months for Draymond Green. On June 10, during Game 4 of the NBA Finals against the Cavaliers, some 20 million viewers caught him in the act of trying to slap LeBron James in the groin. Three days later, after being suspended for that act, he watched his Warriors lose by 15 before dropping Games 6 and 7 in the greatest collapse in Finals history. In early July, he was arrested in East Lansing, Michigan, on an assault charge resulting from a scuffle in a college bar. Later that month, Green accidentally sent out a photo of his penis to the world.  By universal decree, the 2016-17 Warriors are a juggernaut. And if this juggernaut has a foundation, Green is it. Steph Curry is the reigning MVP; new acquisition Kevin Durant is one of the NBA's greatest scorers. But multiple Warriors staffers share the opinion that Green is their most important player. Nobody replicates his set of contributions. As one team official puts it: ""The guys might be frustrated by his antics, but they had an opportunity to prove themselves without him in Game 5 and they played like a bunch of [cowards].""  Herein lies the paradox of the perfectly constructed squad: It's built on ground that roils with lava -- and on the back of a man who has become increasingly unpredictable, emboldened and unaccountable. Draymond Green had a very bad summer. But that weekslong meltdown was a year in the making. And to understand the tensions that could undermine this season's presumptive champion, you must first understand the untold story of what undid the Warriors a season ago.  IT'S JUNE 19, 2015, three days after the Warriors have claimed their first title in 40 years, and Oakland's victory parade has become quite the joyful Draymond Green showcase. More than a million fans lining the parade route have been treated to Green on the mic, slurring in E-40-style syntax: ""Cavaliers. Nope. We won? Yup. They suck? Yup."" And as that parade reaches the rally beside Oakland's Lake Merritt park, they are also treated to a glimpse of the often tense relationship between Green and his coach, Steve Kerr. When it's his turn to address the crowd, Green, victory cap slightly askew, shambles across the podium, snatches the mic and declares that he's excited to be speaking. Golden State PR maestro Raymond Ridder, Green explains, ""tried not to let me talk today. He know I'm gonna get controversial.""  And then he proceeds to validate most all of Ridder's fears: ""With these guys, everything's fun. The only time it's not fun is practice ... film ... games ... bus rides. I'm the only person that gets talked about what shots I take and all those things by Steve Kerr. Like, every time I take a shot, he complains. So that's why, if you see, every time I make a shot, I look at him. Dude complain every time I take a shot.""  From his seat on the stage behind Green, Kerr shrugs and loudly counters: ""Twenty-four percent!"" Which just happens to be Green's 3-point shooting percentage during the final three rounds of the playoffs. Green chuckles, bounds over, grabs Kerr from his chair and drags him to the podium. There are hypothetically a few drops of tension to be wrung from this moment. ""This my guy,"" Draymond starts, prompting Kerr to pat his chest. ""From the start of training camp, he hated me. That's no lie. He probably still hates me. That's no lie. But we going to keep winning these championships -- and that's no lie.""  Kerr, who's been gamely laughing at the display, steals the mic. ""You know how they start to play music at the Oscars when it starts to go on a little long and security comes and grabs the guy? That may happen here in a few minutes. Thanks, though, Draymond,"" he finally offers, before fleeing for the safety of his seat.  EVERYTHING IS GOOD in a victory parade. But before Green's arrival in 2012, the Warriors were a byword for bad. They had made the playoffs only once in the prior 18 seasons. In 2011-12, the lockout-shortened season, they'd won a dismal 23 games, losing 17 of their final 20 to land the seventh pick in the draft. With it, they were hoping to find a savior. Instead, they took Harrison Barnes. The real savior arrived at pick 35. Green, who declined to comment for this story, was underestimated coming into college at Michigan State and then into the NBA -- famously so. The reasons are myriad, but perhaps the main one is this: His approach represents a hybrid, if not a revolution. It's an aggressive, American brashness mixed with an egalitarian, European insistence on moving the ball. Intuition tells us the greats score in bunches, creating their own shot at will. Green does everything save for creating his own shot. It's no coincidence he holds the record for plus-minus in a season. To hear Green yell, mid-drive to the basket, ""Hey! Steph!"" while directing his superstar toward an open space in the corner is to watch a player who not only sees the open man but who speaks his teammates into openness. ""He sees the game,"" says Warriors assistant and defensive guru Ron Adams.  There is another ineffable quality to the man: He just wants it more. It's an energy that overwhelms, fueled by what Kerr calls ""that competitive fire, that rage."" Or, as former teammate Leandro Barbosa once defined Green's optimal basketball mode: ""the guy that always gets mad, the guy everybody hates."" Indeed, his playing style is a constant assault. Every movement is efficient and vicious. He will come to your arena and play the villain, curse out your team, preen after every 3-pointer, light into the refs and possibly kick a foe where the sun doesn't shine.  Kerr once quipped of his team's appeal, ""We have a very likable group of guys -- other than Draymond."" The comment was said with a smile, meant with mirth. A lot of truth is said in jest, as the saying goes. IT'S NOV. 27 in Phoenix, the 17th game of the Warriors' 2015-16 season, and there's nothing not to like about their performance so far. Over the summer, Kerr had predicted that the coming season would be their leap, that magical moment when last year's principles became reflexive. It happened, just not on Kerr's watch. The Warriors are undefeated, and their pattern is getting repetitive: Blow out the opponent, keep starters fresh with rest, keep bench guys happy with plenty of garbage-time run.  Up 25 with 4:14 left, this night is no different -- until Green fouls a driving Archie Goodwin. The action halts. Green helps Goodwin up from his fall as longtime NBA vet Jason Thompson saunters off the bench to check in for Green. The game, of course, is well beyond over, but Green pleads to stay in, shaking his head, holding his hand out in a ""wait"" signal before trudging to the end of the bench in a huff. Within a few seconds, an animated discussion ensues between him and interim coach Luke Walton. Green appears none too pleased. The reason: He is one rebound away from a triple-double.  After 25 seconds of game clock have elapsed, Green is back in front of the scorer's table, arms akimbo, ready to check in. He subs in at the timeout, and 52 seconds later, little-used guard Ian Clark misses a layup, which Green rebounds and lays in. On the very next possession, Green intentionally fouls Suns guard Devin Booker and lopes back to the bench, his mission complete.  A Warriors staffer would later say of the incident, ""Luke would have left him in had he known."" More to the point, as the interim coach, Walton already has enough on his plate without having to worry about aggravating his power forward. Indulging Green may have seemed the only realistic choice.  ""Luke's my guy,"" Green would frequently say of his interim coach, even before Walton took the reins. The two were often seen laughing together during pushup challenges after practice. Both had charisma, but in different ways. Green was the loud life of the party; Walton operated at a languid pace that belied his quick wit.  When Walton took over for the first three months of the season, with Kerr sidelined due to complications from back surgery, he had assumed a light grip on the steering wheel. He was, for example, still rebounding for Green, just as he'd done as an assistant. Though the team had something of a power vacuum in Kerr's absence, Walton thought it best if he maintained his old duties, carrying on as though nothing were amiss. The early results were historically good. The Warriors were dominating the league, dominating SportsCenter, Curry's incandescent start prompting teams to double-team him, allowing Green to make more plays than ever. Sixteen games into the season, Green had gone from averaging 3.7 assists a game the season before to 6.6, and a man who had tallied just two triple-doubles in his first three seasons was now a nightly triple-double threat. And nobody, apparently, was more aware of it than Green, who would end the regular season with 13 triple-doubles, the NBA's single-season record for power forwards. Suddenly far more than a ""glue guy,"" Green was a star, flourishing without restrictions. But such conditions and such outcomes? They make it hard to tell a man anything."
"It's kinda sad bc I had no problem with the Raptors. Then, I joined this sub like 6 years ago and the Raps fans in here are without question the most annoying/whiney fanbase of us all.

Kevin Durant
"again, when u say subjective stuff...its pointless to talk about. Im not going to debate that u feel Lebron choked because theres no way to measure, choking. I can tell you that Dallas had 2 players shooting 32 and 33 from 3. And 6 guys shooting from 37%-75% from 3....that isn't about choking, that is called being lights out and ahead of the times.  Don't forget Dirk, who just beat Kevin Durant and OKC which is probably a better TEAM than the Heat, is unguardable. Haslem, Wade, Bosh...don't matter who you put on him, The Heat simply had no one who was physically capable of stopping Dirk at that time. OKC had Ibaka, Collison, and Durant and even then Dirk put up 40 something points.  Again, its not always about gameplay but execution. Rick Carslile is/was a better coach than Eric Spolstra...dont forget that either. Dallas had a better team and much more chemistry and playing time than Miami...I don't see why you don't talk about that. Its almost like LBJ is the best player so he shouldn't be able to lose is your logic."
"Another Haynes tweet: [Yahoo Sources: NBA stars Kevin Durant, Andre Drummond and Donovan Mitchell expected to compete in the 16-player NBA 2K Tournament.](https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1245005844946665479?s=21)"
&gt; But the basketball world always gives him a pass so they would most likely blame Draymond.  Imagine thinking that Kevin Durant always gets a pass.
"ok for fucks sake the point was to show that lebron played about as well as an individual could play in the finals. that has to be in the 99.9th percentile of all individual performances. you're telling me michael jordan makes THAT much of a difference over lebron? enough to make them beat the **kevin durant warriors**. that's completely ridiculous. there's never been a team as imbalanced compared to the rest of the league as them, and there almost certainly never will be again."

That’s a joke right? The guy who threw his former teammates and organization under the bus. Kyrie doing the same with the Cavs and Cs. And then he and Kyrie join the Nets and Kenny is gone the same year?

"horrible argument but i'm glad you tried  kyrie does not have the expectations to outperform lebron james in the nba finals. he wasn't disappointing, no, because nobody would've ever asked that of him. duh.  stephen curry *does* have the expectations to outperform klay thompson. people *would* ask of him to outperform kevin durant.  you're suggesting that the gap between kyrie irving and lebron james is comparable to the gap between stephen curry and kevin durant. kd &gt; curry, but the gap isn't *that* big dude..."
"No he wasn't lmao. LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Chris Paul were all much better."
"Lmao   I didnt even bother to stop and address ‘hooks’ but let’s do that now.   1- A hook shot? What are you even talking about?  Lmaoo Kobe wasn’t known for that and when he did take em, it was outta fun, a luxury shot. Like him shooting a left handed jumper. It doesn’t even belong in the discussion.   2- Floaters. You do hoop, right? When do you shoot a floater? When you need to get it over a big. It is by design, be definition, almost always a **contested** shot. It’s for when you either can’t just pull up (more on that in a sec), or if you cant get all the way to the rim. If you can do either, both are better shots than a floater. That’s why it’s typically a small guy shot bc they can’t get it all the way to the bucket.   So...Imagine Mike vs the Knicks when he spins off Starks and reverses baskeline. He didn’t take a floater he punched it. Why? **Bc he could**   Imagine Jordan pushes off Russell and instead of the automatic pull up J, he drives closer to take a floater 😂  Imagine 7ft Kevin Durant instead of just shooting over a 6’7 player, he drives and takes a floater....  Imagine prime Vince Carter  instead of dunking on Weiss, or Zo, or Mutombo, instead he stops short to take a *floater*  You take a floater when you *need* to. It’s not a shot you take to be efficient if you have other options.   I say all that to say this..Mike didn’t take floaters bc he didn’t *need* to take no damn floaters"
Kevin Durant. It's painfully futile.
"Guards were stacked in the 90s, but forwards were also stacked in the 10's. Aside from early 2000's centers every position has been stacked. That's why All NBA honors are so highly regarded.   LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and then guys like Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love etc... and still great past their prime Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol"
"I think everyone should be talking about Nikola Vucevic, Kevin Durant said it best himself"
"Nobody was asking Harden to lead a team, he has st need e to do his share which he choked.  Kevin Durant was. The year they went to the Finals was KD's second top 2 finish in the MVP race plus he had a 5th and he got 2nd again the next year.   So what is your point?"
Sam Presti really wasted the primes of Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant .....
Tbf those don't compare to picking players over Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant.  I feel bad for sac fans though. Despite the market size - people in Sacramento love their team.
"The ""I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am"" argument gets thrown out the window when you realise he couldn't handle the scoring load and had to jump ship to the warriors. Hell Warriors fans don't even look at him fondly."
"The 2012 Finals had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden"
How the fuck is Kevin Durant not in Slytherin?! This list is bogus!  Black Mamba as a Slytherin needs no apologies.

Nah that’s probably KD.[Ron (KD) was insecure about only being second best to his brothers (Oden?) and later on Harry (LeBron)](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1614921-kevin-durant-is-tired-of-second-place-on-new-sports-illustrated-cover). Not to mention a certain incident on twitter

That's assuming they don't make any dumb trades."
If siakam could shoot like Klay he'd be a top 5 current player. Probably just a step below Kevin Durant at that point.
I feel like he’d be Kevin Durant.
"&gt;Kevin Durant - Get it, because he’s a snake?   Why'd you roast KD like that? Come on, bruh."
"Kevin Durant left because of me. And If you want, I will tell"
"Uhhh Trae Young, Kevin Durant, and John Colllins"
Like I said. Do with the take what you want. But I personally feel like strictly talking basketball and ignoring legacies and shit. There are not 5 people that have stepped on an NBA court and played basketball better than Kevin Durant.
I said it before he was a warrior and Im saying it afterward. There are not 5 human beings better at BASKETBALL in the history of humanity than Kevin Durant. Do with this take what you want but Kevin Durant is legitimately one of the best basketball players ever among a group of elite basketball players. Not just scoring wise but the game in general.
"Regular Season + Postseason:  &amp;#x200B;  |Player On|Player Off|Minutes|Net Rating| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Steph Curry|Kevin Durant|2691|10.94| |Kevin Durant|Steph Curry|2967|3.14|  Similar number of minutes, the net rating tells an obvious story."

Assuming current player - I like Kawhi Leonard. Retired Player: Michael Jordan Injured Player: Kevin Durant
"IMO, Kevin Durant is the best isolation offensive player of his generation."
"Of course that's not new. Every era has players that inspire the next generation.  But OP asked who's the better player all-time between Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. So for these two players, Steph Curry is the one who has changed the game. Durant is elite, but without Curry the NBA (and especially the way kids play) doesn't change/evolve the way it has recently."
"JJ Redick is a solid player and an all-time great shooter but his propensity for taking weird fading off-balance threes makes me squirm. Can't complain about the end result but watching him in Philly it felt like every other possession was a handoff from Embiid into a fadeaway and something about his jumpshot irks me just a little bit (maye the way he sways out his right leg way more than his left, idk).  Chris Paul's ability to get to his spot and rise up over people is so fun to watch. He's got that kind of Kevin Durant type thing where KD will just elevate over you and you can't do anything to contest it, except that CP is about a foot shorter and might, somehow, be a *better* shooter? Throw in his ability to manipulate the defense as a point guard and he might be my pick for most aesthetically pleasing."
His team has aged like wine. Getting Kevin Durant in one of the later rounds was an absolute steal.
PG - Steph Curry  SG - Pete Maravich  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Tim Duncan   C - Ben Wallace
"PG: Kyrie Irving/ Damian Lillard  Most Overhated Player &amp; Most Underrated Point Guard: both are clutch &amp; can handle the ball with ease &amp; break some ankles and doing crazy layups, I just wanna be like them   SG: Kobe Bryant  RIP.

"He was incredible talented and about once every 5-10 (20-30 some years) games he would show it off a bit.  I think this new generation really underrates size as well. The game has changed so much to give smaller players as many advantages as possible, but still, you can't teach size.  Dude was massive, like shaq size (not actually, but his girth/quickness and coordination ratio was freakish) and had all of the ball skills, just was never able to out it all together. Nagging injuries contributed as well.  Darko clearly never could get the attitude and talent and health to work together, but people that never watched him don't need to pretend like he was olowakandi and thabeet bad, dude was the total package athletically.    https://bleacherreport.com/articles/524975-kevin-durant-darko-milicic-is-one-of-the-best-centers-in-the-nba  this is on his last stint in the nba, being begged to be the starting center in minny and he put a bunch of solid games together."

"Let's address the defense and physicality thing:  There's four players on your top 12-13 list you mentioned who have had to play with modern zone defense rules: LeBron, Kobe, last-year-of-his-career Raptors Hakeem, and last-year-of-his-career Wizards MJ. And yet LeBron puts up incredibly efficient numbers against packed paints, where not only is he being defended by his man, but also one or two people soft doubling off their man and camping beneath the hoop. Look [here](http://www.celticshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/illegal-MJ-post.gif) at MJ drawing a free foul because the second defender is out of position. MJ could hit the floor with terrible 3-point shooters like Luc Longley, Harper, and Rodman, and still be guaranteed space just because of illegal defense rules. Aside from Kobe, all the other players never dealt with this issue for a significant portion of their career. That sort of defense took a hatchet to isos and post-ups with an unspaced floor - precisely the type of scoring that Kareem, Bird, MJ, and Hakeem were known for doing. Great players like Kobe were able to force these sorts of opportunities, albeit at questionable efficiency. But LeBron has managed to score on this sort of defense with remarkable efficiency.  In terms of physicality, LeBron is also a standout. Referring back to that list, LeBron is the 3rd heaviest out of 13, at 250 lbs (as per Basketball Reference). #4 is Kareem (225 lbs), #2 is Hakeem (255 lbs), and #1 is Wilt (275 lbs). That's right, the closest person in weight is Hakeem, and LeBron is halfway in between Wilt and Kareem. The fact that he can carry that much weight and still be as fast as he is is a testament to how strong he actually is. In a more physical era, he would be bowling over the Larry Birds and Magic Johnsons (220 lbs). LeBron would probably be moving the skinnier centers over like they were Kevin Durant, except KD is 240 pounds and Kareem and Bill are 225 and under."

"15, 16, and maybe 17 are currys only great seasons. Curry is very overrated by the media and the nba players know this, he misses too many games, his career counting stats are pretty pedestrian.. 16.5 k points, and 4.5 assists by age 32 doesnt scream anything special. But he gets elevated by leftists because he plays in silicon valley the new media hub for sports. The whole talk of curry being hated on because he is lightskin was reverse psycoholgy, and the media knew it. No player is more coddled by the media than stephen curry, every bad game he has their is an injury excuse made for him. When guys like lebron and harden never get those excuses, the same media said durant was happy the warriors were losing without him in the finals last year after curry was getting exposed on defense and accused durant of faking his heel injury. This also coincides with Chris Broussard calling kevin durant a ""luxury"" on fs1( imagine calling a 2x finals mvp a luxury) Durant was guilted into coming back by the media to try and help curry get a meaningless finals mvp. Curry worship coinsides with harden hate. The media does NOT want harden to tie curry in mvps. They will keep robbing him, the only reason they voted for harden in 2018 is because the media didnt wanna give LeBron another one. Westbrook was a 7th seed and won mvp, thats something i can never get an answer from curry stans when they try and tell me curry is hated because he is lightskin. Ask yourself this, if curry had a season where he led the warriors to the 3rd seed averaging 29/8/11, would curry lose mvp to another player who only had 2 more rebounds but didnt even win 50 games. NO curry would probably win another uniamous mvp with a season like that.  Max Kellerman said that curry could average 36 like harden did in 2019, and when curry had his chance with no kd and no klay he shot horrible from the field and got injured smh. When your usage goes up, its much harder to be dominant and score when teams know you are gettin the ball everytime. Harden was dominating and winning games with g leaguers bruh, players that wouldnt even crack the warriors rotation THIS YEAR"
"Korver took 3 shots before that. 0-3 isn't ice cold. And, Korver is one of the best shooters of all time, 43% from three for his career. I would always take a slightly contested three from a 43% career three pointer shooter over going for layup while being heavily contested by Kevin Inspector Gadget Arms Durant and DPOY Draymond Green. Anyone who thinks that is the wrong decision doesn't know shit bout ball."
"Kevin Durant is not turnover prone.  He averaged 29.6 points, 4.5 assists, and **2.7 turnovers** as a Warrior in the playoffs. That is the opposite.  (also 2.7to in the regular season)"
That looks like a lot of Athletes and not shooters/ball handlers. - Kevin Durant
"That wasn't a heavily contested shot. And, if Curry knew exactly what LeBron would do, why does he stunt? If he knew LeBron would make that pass 100% he would have stayed home on Korver and deny the pass.  And, you didn't answer the question. A layup that is going to be heavily contested by a Kevin Durant and Draymond DPOY Green, or a slightly contested three by Kyle ""45% from 3"" Korver? I'm taking the Korver shot every single day. That was the right play without a doubt."
"What is a better shot, LeBron going for a layup while being contested by a Defensive Player Of The Year and Kevin ""6'10"" Durant OR an slightly contested three from Kyle Korver who shot 45.4% from three as a Cav and 42.9% for his career?  Give me that Korver shot every day of the year."
How many guys can defend both a Steph type 1 and Kevin Durant for long stretches of games and do it well. It's a very very short list. Most of them will be guys taller than 6'3. I remember there was a a random game in 2016 where for a portion of it the Grizz put Tony Allen on Anthony Davis and he held up fine. Just something else.
The one with the whole warriors team and girl kevin durant is super funny
"Yeah, old Tim Duncan and young Kawhi were as good as prime Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, great argument there."
I honestly can’t believe Tony Allen was able to play better defence than most people against Kevin durant.   Like no one is ever going to stop Durant (in his prime ) but shit Tony Allen made him work for it more than others and he barely came up to his chest
"Kevin Durant in OKC. I’m not the biggest KD fan, but Steve Kerr said that no one would wear #35 again on the Warriors a while ago and it should be the same in OKC no matter how ugly things may have gotten when he left."
"I like the criteria you used and the reasons you have given in putting Lebron over Kobe. Sounds about right and fair to me.  Makes me wonder, those criteria, we can use to make a clear head to head comparison of great players.  I know it would be hustle, but I would be interested to see your take on the following match ups:  1. Kevin Garnett vs Dirk Nowitski (or Karl Malone) 2. Shaquille O'Neal vs Hakeem Olajuwon 3. Larry Bird vs Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant isn’t 6 foot 9
"If you go for impact, 2016 WCF actually might even have more of a case.  It solidified that this warrior team was no team to mess with, as they beat the Thunder 3 straight times with incredible performances from Klay and Steph  It caused KD to leave the thunder  It caused the warriors to sign Kevin Durant  It ended up solidifying Lebron legacy as a top player ever."
"Skal, Harry Giles, Bol Bol...  All guys that have flourished after I selected them from 2K user created draft classes.  Next you're going to tell me that Kevin Porter Jr. isn't an offensive stud and and Jaden McDaniels isn't the next Kevin fucking Durant..."
"I just remember that one time (I think in 2017), when way too many players didn't vote for Lebron James and Kevin Durant for the all star voting."
Because the decision paved the way for other greats to team up? If you hate durant joining gsw you should hate lebron bitch move as well since kevin durant is inspired by the decision.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-lebron-paved-the-way-for-his-decision-to-sign-with-warriors/
There’s a huge difference between getting scored on by Kevin Durant and getting played off the floor &amp; essentially becoming a liability for your team.
"Kevin Durant. He joined a 73-9 team he blew a 3-1 lead to and then used burners to defend the move, trash his own teammates, and fight shitposters."
A team that added Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wont have a turnaround soon? Great logic
"You grow up as a kid playing ball at the playground with your friends, you’re too young to realize that your city has a pro team and they’re currently playing in the west finals, and game 7 is tonight. You go home to relax and you see your parents absolutely devastated with what is happening with the basketball game on tv. Oh well, you go to build some legos and forget about it.  Years flash by and your mom takes you to this magical building called the “Rose Garden” and it’s the greatest experience of your life despite sitting so high up the players look like ants. Instantly you’re hooked. This team in the red and black is your everything, you learn that the team was known as the “jail blazers” but have recently shed this image and drafted an up and coming star SG from the University of Washington, not to mention a lanky PF from Texas too.   You watch these players grow, suddenly 32 wins turn to 41. You just miss the playoffs but things are heading in the right direction. You watch the draft lottery hoping to move up, this draft is unlike any other, you have Greg oden from Ohio state who is a freak of nature, and another absolute unicorn named Kevin Durant from Texas. You know that these guys are probably out of reach, a pipe dream, but maybe we could draft another quality player to complement a good young core.  And then the unthinkable happens. Through some incredibly bounce of the lottery balls your beloved team snags the no 1 pick. NUMBER ONE. It was freaking meant to be, our team will be the next dynasty, we will have one of the greatest big 3s of all time. Roy at SG, Aldridge at PF, and Greg Oden at center because of course he’s the best player (no offense to that Durant kid from Texas).   Your team drafts him. For the first time as serious basketball fan your team wins 54 games and snags the 4th seed in the NBA playoffs. The city is a buzz, this young big man despite an early season injury has shown flashes. Roy looks every part of a future superstar in the making, Aldridge as a throw in is improving even more and has an unblock-able turn around jumper.  It’s happening. It’s all fucking happening. Despite the team losing to the rockets 4-2 they are heading the right direction.   Then the wind shifts, Oden has a knee scope and the results are not good, he needs a micro fracture procedure to repair his knee. It’s okay he’ll be back, he’s young. Oh also Roy needs a procedure to clean up his meniscus, not a big deal it’s something that is routine.  Then on a faithful night Greg contests an Aaron Brooks layup attempt against those same rockets. His patella explodes. He’s wheeled off the court, the arena sounds like a library. You know deep down he’ll never be the same.  You finally get over it, at lest you have Roy! He’ll carry your franchise over the top, you know this for sure. Then he tears his meniscus again. And again. Suddenly your childhood hero can’t move like he used to. His drives to the rims are blocked. He can’t get separation for his jumpers anymore, his PPG plummets. Suddenly your city’s most beloved star is coming off the bench.  Then IT happens. Medical retirement. You can’t even comprehend what’s happening. The greatest player you’ve ever seen is suddenly smack dab on the front page of the Oregonian walking into the sunset with his son holding his hand.  The big 3 that never was. It’s pain that I never thought was possible, but it’s the badge we hold a blazer fans. Oden, Roy, and Aldridge. The big 3 that never was."
"Perkins consistently takes jabs at Steph though and then walks it back. He just recently left him off his top 5 PG list then went back and said Steph is a hybrid lol. Plus he said the *only* thing Steph does better than Harden is shoot....  He trashes him on Twitter all the time, here are some highlights:  &gt;[YOU CANT PUT A CROWN ON A CLOWN AND EXPECT A KING.](https://mobile.twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1137408986947424256)  &gt;[GS needs KEVIN DURANT! 4-The media will find a way to protect Steph Curry “Golden Child”!](https://mobile.twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1137205077121179653)  &gt;[I guess Klay return is messing up Steph rhythm? That will be the excuse everyone gives him tomorrow!](https://mobile.twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1137190178395607040)  &gt;[It’s no hate it’s just facts! That’s y’all Golden Child y’all always given him a pass!](https://mobile.twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1137192276218732544)  &gt;[Y’all give Steph enough praise](https://mobile.twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1135347442701000709)  Also a bunch of stuff about Trae in his second year being better than Steph in his second year... “better passer” etc.  So he’s definitely biased when it comes to Curry."
"LeBron, PG, Kawhi, Durant, Kevin Garnett"
&gt; and yet now somehow Lebron going to the heat isn’t really a big deal because he didn’t lose to the heat in the playoffs  The two situations are not equivalent lmao. Miami at their peak didn't win as many games as Golden State did in either of the two seasons before Kevin Durant joined them. The fact that Durant blew a 3-1 lead to them before joining added another layer of patheticity (which isn't even a word but applies here).
"&gt;it’s not like Harden has been given crap teams  It's not like he's often been given All-Star calibre teammates, either.  A couple seasons of semi-healthy Dwight and one good season of CP3 doesn't come close to comparing with guys like Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.  2017 his best teammate was... Ryan Anderson? Trevor Ariza? Patrick Beverley? Eric Gordon? (Take your pick... I honestly don't know)... All he did was lead the league in Assists and drag the Rockets to the 3rd seed. . And 2019 very arguably *was* ""a crap team""."
They lost to the warriors without Kevin durant...
"was that the one he hit after Kevin Durant ""saved"" the ball like 10 feet out of bounds and didn't get called? that's some COLD blooded stuff right there"
Kevin Durant russel westbrook kawhi leonard Paul George ja Morant
"Irrespective of who is better between kobe, wade, or lebron at that time, just because everyone deferred to kobe in the clutch doesn't mean he's better. We've seen lebron defer to kyrie at times in the clutch, same thing with curry deferring to Kevin Durant. But lebron and curry tend to have higher impact overall even if other players can be better clutch players.   That being said I'm not saying kobe wasn't better at that time I'm just saying that doesn't really prove what he thinks"
"This series was amazing to watch for several reasons:  * During the 2009-2010 season, the Thunder came out of nowhere (at the time, they weren't predicted to win much) to win 50 games and make the 8TH SEED and face the Lakers. People knew who Kevin Durant was, but not many people had been exposed to his game, or Russell Westbrook. At a time when Durant, Westbrook, and Harden were all just 21 and younger, the Thunder ended up taking the defending champions to 6 games. The Thunder were officially on the map (fun fact though, Harden only averaged 7 ppg in that series). [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/sports/basketball/02lakers.html) is an article covering the impact that series had on teams' perception of the Thunder: * Earlier that season (correct me if I am wrong), Harden and Kobe got into it on the court when they started trash talking back and forth. Eventually, Durant joined in and they tried to mock/trash talk Kobe during what was a blowout win for the Thunder. I believe Kobe's response was ""you can't sit at my lunchtable yet"" (as in, they don't have the accolades to talk shit). * Fast forward to this series, which featured a 3-seed Lakers vs. the 2-seed Thunder. The Lakers were still relevant but it was clear they had run out of gas, and nobody outside of Kobe really gave a shit anymore after 3 straight Finals runs. This was also the year of peak Thunder (as we all know Harden left after this year), and it featured three future MVPs on the cusp of their primes (all were 23 or younger). The series wasn't really that close and the Thunder took it in 5.  It officially signaled the end of the Kobe/Lakers era (you can argue it ended when the Mavs beat them in 2011, but the Lakers were still considered title favourites in 2012), and ushered the Thunder/Spurs era from 2012-2014.  Kobe's final average for the series:  31 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 3.4 apg, including 42 points on 54% shooting as a goodbye."
Vince Carter to Kobe to Kevin Durant
"In 3 years let's assume LeBron is no longer the best SF. He'll be 37/38 years old, maybe he's the best still but let's go with Kawhi.  |Position|USA|Europe| |:-|:-|:-| |Center|Anthony Davis or KAT|Nikola Jokic| |Power Forward|Kevin Durant? Zion?|Kristaps Porziņģis| |Small Forward|Kawhi Leonard|Giannis Antetokounmpo| |Shooting Guard|James Harden|Dennis Schröder?| |Point Guard|Steph Curry|Luka Dončić|  It's close, I think team Europe will have the edge in 2 possibly 3 of these positions (Luka, Giannis and Jokic) but Europe just has very few elite guards. They may win 3/5 positions but the 2 they don't win they lose pretty badly. If Porziņģis continues to develop and becomes a 25/10 guy (his numbers to close out the season) it becomes a heck of a lot closer, but I think the gap between Fournier/Schröder/Bogdanovic and Harden is just too big to overcome.  Team Europe will need an all star caliber guard to win IMO. Now if you factor in depth, team USA wins pretty easily.  EDIT: now if you include this to be international stars not just team Europe, you now have Joel Embiid, Pascal Siakam and Ben Simmons. Team International faces the same problem, they are comparable starting 5 wise but are pretty top heavy and don't have the depth that team USA has."
"And Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Zion, James Harden, Paul George, Ja Morant, Devin Booker, Karl Towns, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Bam Adebayo, Oladipo, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Bradley Beal, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson will still exist"
"Yeah, it was apparently a specific incident during the 2015 All-Star game that helped the ball rolling when it came to recruiting KD to the Warriors:  &gt;Kerr's joy, mocked as it was near the end of KD's time, was essential to Durant's recruitment.  A few Warriors officials believe that KD was drawn to the Warriors in part by All-Star Weekend 2015, when Kerr was coach of the West squad.   &gt;It was Kerr at his peak cheerful insouciance, months before a botched back surgery brought constant pain. He was cracking jokes and having fun with the absurd proceedings.  &gt;At one point, the Warriors coaches were drinking beer in their locker room when a curious Durant poked his head in.  &gt;""So this is what you're about, huh?"" KD said, with a smile. The coaches didn't deny it.  &gt;""I know that the way we went about our business was pretty unique,"" Kerr said of the beers. ""Very different from OKC and San Antonio, much looser. Players are given a lot more autonomy. I think that might have appealed to Kevin.  &gt;""I think after that first year, I think a lot of people watched us play around the league and they liked our style and they saw the joy that was being displayed by our players and our fans and they saw the talent. They saw the way our guys played and they wanted to be a part of it and I think that's what attracted Kevin.""

kerr was in the finals because he had two of the greatest shooters of all time and he just had to let them run around 4 screens and get open in the corner. pop literally made the playoffs every year but 2020 and not with steph curry or kevin durant
"He's wearing a baggy tshirt as opposed to a tight jersey. Sure he seems slightly slimmer, but people were making it out like he turned into Kevin Durant or something."
By this logic you could argue Harrison Barnes was more valuable to the warriors than Kevin Durant because they went 73-9 with Barnes and didn’t get close to that with Durant. Looking at regular seasoning winning percentage isn’t an effective metric.

Helps when you start out with Kevin Durant on your team
Kevin Durant is one of the 10 best players to ever play the game
"Dirk Nowitzki is a 1 time finals MVP, 1 time NBA champion.  Kevin Durant is a 2 time finals MVP, 2 time NBA champion  A ring is a ring"
"I’m not mad at him, he just has zero titles.  Kevin Durant should have credit for zero titles."
"I mean, put Kevin Durant on any team during Bills era and they are a contender. Fuck put KD on literally any team now and they contend for a playoff spot, period. Right down to the worst team in the nba.   Thats not an indictment on Russell but the league was smaller, had less money pumping, and had a smaller talent pool. BR is an all time great I think would be amazing if he was in his prime right now. But so is KD.   From my very narrow POV he is a weird, possibly insecure type of personality but fuck it. Dude can ball. He worked very well with the Warriors but he didn’t get that intangible that he wanted."
"Shaq, Wilt, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Kawhi. Probably more but that's what comes to mind from players in the top 50"
"kevin durant did a similar move of trying not to let anyone else touch the ball and not grabbing it himself, prompting Jeff Van Gundy to say ""The players should know the rules of the game they're participating in"" lol . You can ALWAYS pick up the ball (unless no one else touched it and you were the inbounder or in a backcourt situation)"
There's a basketball movie from 2012 called Thunderstruck starring Kevin Durant. There's also a movie from 2004 called [Thunderstruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstruck_\(2004_film\)) starring [Stephen Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry_\(comedian\)).
"&gt;In his prime, Vince's production would significantly dip during the playoffs as opposed to other superstars that always elevated their play.   Almost nobody really ""elevates"" in the postseason (and if you do, it's a small sample that's generally not representative). People says this nonsense about James Harden, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Karl Malone, Allen Iverson etc. also got criticism for not improving their playoff numbers compared to their regular season stats.  &gt;The miles that affected Vince the most has been the ones he flew before the most important Game 7 in his career for extremely selfish reasons.   If Vince's game-winning shot went in, nobody would have any problems with him going to that graduation.  There’s more to life than sports. Graduating from college is a once in a lifetime moment, which obviously meant a lot for him. Not everybody gets to walk the stage and get their diploma. I’ll never hold something like that against an athlete.  &gt;I can't remember another player that told his own team's plays to the opposing team when they wanted a trade.  The narrative about Vince 'giving away plays' in Raptors-Sonics game has never been proven. It's a rumour that was published 2 days after his trade to New Jersey Nets. And that game was played 1 month ago before the trade happened. Ray Allen, Sam Mitchell etc. all denied it.  Can't blame Vince for asking a trade, Raptors failed to build a decent team around him.  &gt;When you consider how much shit Jordan (or Kobe) deals with off the court because of the super crazy megastar that he is as opposed to Vince having to deal with much less stuff outside of the game   Eh... Vince got tons of criticism about stuff that had nothing to do with his game, especially after getting traded from Raptors. Kinda like how people treats KD now...  &gt;he was never even the most popular basketball player in the world let alone being the most popular athlete of his generation like MJ and Kobe were.  Revisionist history as it's finest.  Vince was definitely the most popular player in NBA at the height of the ""Vinsanity"", he was leading the All-Star voting in 3-4 consecutive years ahead of Kobe, Jordan, Shaq etc. All of them were massive household names themselves. Also, Vince was the face of the NBA commercials in regards of video games and stuff like that.  &gt;Vince can still walk because practices are probably harder than games for him, and they're probably cutting him slack there based on the teams he's been playing.   Lol."
"1. Societal pressure, constantly being under a microscope  2. There is a difference between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Basketball obviously brings Kevin Durant happiness, but pressures to be successful, praised, etc could make anyone hate what they love."
"Unpopular opinion but Kevin Durant is a better player than Bill Russell. He doesn’t touch Russell when it comes to greatness, but in terms of pure skill and ability Durant is a better player than Russell."
Hate? I’m just posting a highlights of a critical game Kevin Durant played to  avoid going down 3-1 in the first round of his MVP season. Huge game for the team especially considering OKC ended up losing game 5
Kevin Durant
Let's break this down   #1. 2015 it takes the warriors 6 games to beat the Cavs without 2/3 of their best players (no love or irving)  #2. 2016 they got up 3-1 with a 73-9 team and lose in 7 making history by being the only team in NBA history to choke a 3-1 lead in the finals   #3. 2017 draymond crying to KD on the phone in the parking lot because their 73-9 team wasnt good enough so KD joins them and they win easy (best team in NBA history if you ask me 🤷‍♂️)  #4. 2018 exact same as 2017  #5. Kevin Durant goes down with a injury and they lose in 6 to the Raptors   See the trend here? Without Kevin Durant they made choking history and took 6 games to beat a Cavs team in 2015 without 2/3 of their best players lol  Their whole championship run was overrated and I still think they would have been a one and done when you use the power of hindsight and look at what happened  BUT WE WILL NEVER TRULY KNOW SO 🤷‍♂️ either way warriors no KD = overrated to me
"&gt;By comparison, Harden/LeBron , when they pass a ""non-shooter"" e.g. Capela, McGee it's often an open dunk at the rim.   I definitely agree that Curry's lob passes are one of his weaknesses in terms of passing (Draymond on the other hand is great here). He isn't on the same level as Harden or LeBron here either, but neither is Durant. I will say that Durant is probably better at Curry at this specific type of pass.  &gt;Further more, Curry is 20th among guards in terms of Pass to AST%.....Further dispelling the notion that his passes lead to open looks.   This stat tends to favor higher usage players and players who aren't making as many non-assist passes that may be good plays. Curry is often off ball and has a larger number of passes to players like Draymond before running around screens to get the ball again later, which is quite common for the Warriors because of how good Curry is off ball. If we look at a player like Jokic, who I think most would agree is one of the best passers in basketball, he scores quite low in this stat because even though he has good assist numbers, he makes many other passes as well. Players like Harden on the other hand will do better in this stat because he is almost always holding the ball, except when kicking it out to shooters or finding lobs, so the percentage of his passes that are assists is much higher.   &gt;Durant actually shoots better % from midrange on passes received from Draymond than Curry. They’re both equal as playmakers, Both can only make one read and KD actually is better in that aspect in the postseason.   This doesn't really go against what I think because I consider Draymond a better playmaker than Curry and Curry a better playmaker than Durant.  &gt;The reason I argued KD to be the better creator off the dribble was because he can take his man off the dribble at will and create offense that way. Many times with Curry, He’s unable to create off the dribble against elite wing players, he’s either forced to take a bad shot or Draymond Ends up with the ball. With KD, he can take his man completely off the dribble &amp; create offense for his team more effectively. That’s the reason he was a first option in golden state.   I agree that Durant is a better isolation scorer and he uses it more often than Curry, but Curry is also an effective isolation scorer when he uses it. The NBA also track isolation plays, and here is how Durant and Curry look:  * 2015-16 RS: Curry - 94.2; Durant - 85.2 * 2015-16 PS: Curry - 94.6; Durant - 18.9 * 2016-17 RS: Curry - 93.2; Durant - 89.2 * 2016-17 PS: Curry - 86.1; Durant - 77.8 * 2017-18 RS: Curry - 86.2; Durant - 86.9 * 2017-18 PS: Curry - 59.2; Durant - 73.5 * 2018-19 RS: Curry - 89.9; Durant - 85.5 * 2018-19 PS: Curry - 97.4; Durant - 65.8   [https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/](https://stats.nba.com/players/isolation/)   &gt; KD with Reggie Jackson as his second best player &amp; Westbrook missing north of 40 games won 59 games in 2014 and played at a 65 win pace. Curry had a better team that year &amp; finished As a Bottom seed &amp; Warriors didn’t even finish top 10 in offense. KD was just the much more impactful offensive player.   I'm not trying to take anything away from Durant, he's one of the all time greats. In 2013-14, he played amazingly and carried that OKC team, while the Warriors underperformed. Durant was also definitely a better player than Curry then and the years before that. I'd still say generally for the earlier parts of the decade, Durant was on the better team.  &gt; He’s a shot blocking 7ft guard that is very good 1v1 and in face up positions. He’s one of the best harden defenders in the league for example &amp; He suffocates perimeter players very well. He’s a great defender lol. The same Ben guy you keep mentioning calls him near elite on that end. Even Draymond said he should’ve been in DPOTY convos on that end.   IMO, to be elite, there's two categories with few exceptions. First, you can be a big/paint presence who can get blocks and also forces the offense to take more difficult shots because of your presence (Gobert, Lopez twins, etc), which KD is not. Just the nature of defense means that bigs tend to be much more impactful. For me to consider a perimeter defender in that category, they need to play at a level like Draymond or Kawhi did defensively. There's also the kind of hybrid players like Giannis, who aren't the primary paint presence on their team, but is also impactful there while being a great perimeter defender. Durant is definitely better than Curry defensively though.  &gt; Often times KD made the correct play, but the problem was he was passing to Westbrook &amp; Waiters, &amp; Robertson. 3 historically bad shooters..... Warriors were able to ignore Westbrook/Robertson/waiters/Adams &amp; just swarm KD because they had some of the worst spacing in league history. The Thunder Couldn’t focus on Curry like that because Of Klay Thompson. Like c’mon man what a horrible example. It’s also hilarious how you don’t mention Curry averaging more turnovers than assists in the 2016 finals.   Kevin Durant was definitely hindered by being around non-spacers. There are two primary ways that spacing helps teammates. First, the defense finds it harder to help off a great floor spacer, so Harden, for example, who is a great floor spacer but not great off ball, still makes it easier for his teammates because they have more space to work with. Curry and Durant are both great in this regards, though I'd consider Curry better. Curry is also better off screens. Durant is of course capable of using off ball screens, but even in his OKC days he wasn't getting swarmed by defenses after screens like Curry is.    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BFJCrKEoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28BFJCrKEoo)   Here is one video that shows a bunch of his off ball movement, and he does have it in his game, but it's definitely not at the level that Curry does.   &gt; If defenses only Guarded Curry, Why does Stephs TS drop 5 points when KD was off the floor?   I'm not trying to say that Durant doesn't carry offensive gravity. He's a great shooter and defenses have to worry about him, so when he's off the court, it's easier for them to focus on Curry. That works both ways because they're both great shooters.   &gt;That’s something that’s unquantifiable. How many players scored off of Durant’s gravity in OKC or Hardens driving gravity in Houston? Or Lillards gravity when he gets trapped off of PNR?——   It is currently unquantifiable and I wish we had more numbers for opportunities created for teammates rather than just assist, secondary assist, and potential assist numbers because it misses out on a big part of creation. Klay doesn't have great assist numbers, but I bet if you take into account his teammates slipping on screens for him, he creates a few more opportunities (not a crazy amount or anything, just more). And all of the players you listed carry gravity in the same way. I don't want to diminish Durant, Harden, Lillard, and others because they're all great. I just think Curry does it better than them."
My top 5 ever is   1.	Wilt Chamberlain 2.	Shaquille O Neal 3.	Michael Jordan 3.	Kevin Durant 4.	Kobe Bryant   These guys are just UNGUARDABLE
Kevin Durant is the definition of weak both mentally and physically
Kevin Durant calling anyone weak is absolutely hilarious.
"It’s not though, because the premise is that the current offensive theory has been built around the fact that 3&gt;2 and a team with 2 top 5 shooters ever and Kevin Durant is the best possible scenario to fit into that system, making it extremely difficult to beat them unless shaq shoots significantly better from the line and Kobe takes less innefficient long twos"
a guaranteed 2 on 3/4 possessions? Shaq wasn't even this dominant against bad matchups in the finals.   The Warriors don't have to hit every three or even get hot from three. The idea would be to exploit Shaq's reluctance to meet ball handlers in the P&amp;R. Imagine Kevin Durant walking into an uncontested 17 footer?
"Yeah think about the math there   If we go full hypothetical for examples sake, if they foul shaq for 3 straight possessions and he goes 1 for 2 every time, golden state has a minimum of 1 shot for 3 possessions to make one 3 to equal Shaqs free throws, and that’s provided they don’t get any tip outs for second chances.  So basically to equal shaqs production(and he isn’t getting the ball every possession so this is hypothetical and extreme) you are basically asking Steph Curry/Klay Thompson/and Kevin Durant to shoot at least 33% from 3.  The old heads never want to actually break it down mathematically, because if they did they’d find out something they didn’t want to know about"
"&gt;I never said shit about him having to resign with the Thunder.  lol bro ""If he was all about team, he would have stayed in OKC."" but he also doesnt have to re-sign with OKC ?? Lmao i feel like YOU dont even know what youre saying at this point, juss stop man. You're holding KD to these unrealistic standards for what someone who is "" all about the team"" should be, and also not standing by your own standards  &gt;Defend him all you want. As a fan I get it. But until Klay and Steph come out with a different position than Draymond about the subject, I can't think anything else other than my previous thoughts.  lol you asked me to cite where teammates talked about how much they loved playing with KD. I did that. If you're gonna willfully ignore, there's really nothing i can do. A[in’t no love lost between Steph and KD](https://www.google.com/amp/s/sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/report-steph-curry-found-out-about-kevin-durant-signing-with-nets-while-flying-to-convince-him-to-stay-with-warriors-150341840.html) either"
"How many players from the original 50 greatest players list is Paul Pierce better than?  With that question in mind, here are the following players not on that list that I'll take over Pierce in no particular order:  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Kobe Bryant  Kevin Garnett   Tim Duncan   Dirk Nowitzki  D Wade  Steph Curry  Giannis (possibly too soon)  Dennis Rodman  Allen Iverson  Gary Payton  Jason Kidd  Steve Nash  Kawhi Leonard  James Harden  Chris Paul  Antony Davis (possibly too soon)"
LeBron James  Michael Jordan  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Magic Johnson  Wilt Chamberlain  Larry Bird  Shaquille O'Neal  Bill Russell  Kobe Bryant  Tim Duncan  Kevin Durant  Scottie Pippen  Kawhi Leonard  Steph Curry  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Giannis Antetokounmpo  Kevin Garnett  Allen Iverson  Charles Barkley
Kevin Durant is ok at putting the ball in the hoop
Yep. I heard they even talked about signing Kevin Durant at one point.
"Probably more. If you asked this question in 10 years ago, only LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry would have been active in 2010 and guys like Steph and Harden were rookies. Very few people would have predicted they'd be top 10 guys in 2020.   Top 10 in 2020 features Kawhi, Giannis, Luka, Nikola, Dame, Joel (all drafted after 2010) That's 60% of the top talent being &gt; 10 years and 80% being &gt; 11 years."
"Unrestricted free agency didn't exist in 1986.  You are judging softness based on a move that occured due to a specific set of rare circumstances that were not available in previous eras.  I'm asking you to determine toughness based on actual on the court play. As in during a basketball game. How can you be soft and play m2m defense like Klay. Walk back on the court from a ACL tear to shoot some free throws. How can you be soft and work your way back from debilitating ankle injuries like Curry. How can you be soft and be as dominant as Kevin Durant was in 2017 on both ends of the floor in the PS. How can you be soft and do any of what Draymond does as a shot contestor, paint protector defensively."
"Dog if you really think that that guy is saying that Kevin Durant is the tallest player in basketball history, then more power to you I guess.  Regarding the LeBron would've had another ring thing, maybe, and maybe Durant might have another ring if he played his whole career in East, but then again maybe if my dog had leaves he'd be a sequoia"
"Because the greatness of Dirk cannot be outmatched.   And in terms of the cavs not being able to overcome the warriors like cmon man lol. You go 73-9 and add a caliber of player like Kevin Durant on your team it’s going to be pretty difficult to overcome. The cavs did everything they could, the warriors were just better plain and simple."
"Okay I mean I wasn't gonna do this, but you're first point is like come the fuck on, he's obviously exaggerating, I'm honestly perplexed that you *and* others have replied ""Kevin Durant is not actually as tall as Yao Ming and as heavy as Eddy Curry"". This is like when people say Tatum is 15, no one actually replies ""Dude Tatum actually 22"". and regarding you're third point, fair enough, but Lebron mind you has only led one team to the finals without multiple all-stars as well and that was in a historically weak East. As a matter a fact, an Eastern conference with the worst 1 seed since 02, barring the 11 Bulls who's MVP missed (more than) the second half the season.   I'm not gonna argue that KD has the leadership that Lebron does or did at KD's current age, but like Lebron went to Miami to get his, KD went to Golden State. It was more egregious but boils down to the same. KD is just getting to Lebron's age when he won in Cleveland, so it's unfair to close the book on him when he hasn't had the same chance."
"After replacing Harrison Barnes who was awful in the 2016 finals with Kevin Durant, the best scorer of his generation?  Uhh.... yeah?"
"Kevin Durant in the 2020 season posting a whopping 0/0/0 on null/null/null so I can see why he’s top 4  Also you have Russell, Booker, Walker, and Mitchell but no Siakam  And Luka is way too low"

"No one thinks Giannis is the best player though. Kawhi or Kevin Durant vs Lebron are better analogies, and Lebron isn't universally considered better than them atm. Even Curry maybe."
"I took play-by-play notes. I'm curious whether people agree with the characterizations.

me and my buddies would play myteam religiously in college. Thon would go 99 overall every time and was basically Kevin Durant with John Wall speed.
"I haven't seen one. However this tidbit is interesting:  &amp;#x200B;  When I released the paperback edition of *The Book of Basketball* in 2009, I ranked Scottie Pippen 24th all time as a Level Four Hall of Fame Pyramid guy. On my 2020 list, he’s been passed by four players—Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant—landing him at 28th. Here’s what I wrote about Scottie in my book."
"LeBron James true shooting percentage in the 2018 NBA finals, not including game 1: 58.3% TS  Kevin Durant true shooting percentage in the 2018 NBA finals, not including game 3: 58.2% TS  But go ahead and accuse me some more"

"Not off the dribble.  The slow release comment is especially important in the context of a comparison to Durant.  Durant is 6'11"", pushes hard to one side, and then has a two-motion shot where he releases at the apex of his jump.    In contrast, Bol is pulling up much lower than KD does on these moves.  He's getting them off over normal height people, sure.  But these moves do not look like Kevin Durant pull-up moves."
Please don’t try and argue that Rick Barry is better than a Kevin Durant.

"Some more interesting What Ifs:  - The Raptors won the 1996 NBA draft lottery but the because of the Magic's success (went to the NBA finals three years only six years after their first season) the NBA put in a rule that forbid either the Grizzlies or Raptors from picking 1st overall in their early years. Iverson went 1st in the '96 draft, Camby went 2nd. - Damon Stoudamire demanded a trade because Isiah Thomas decided to abandon the Raptors after he was not allowed to be the majority owner. Stoudamire didn't feel like the organization was stable enough and demanded a trade.  So there is an alternate universe out there where the late 90's Raptors are made up of: Allen Iverson, Tracey McGrady, Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire.  Here's another one:  - The Raptors also won the 2006 NBA draft lottery. That draft however was the first NBA draft where they barred players coming right out of high school. Greg Oden and Kevin Durant graduated from high school in 2006. They almost certainly declare for the draft instead of going to college. Oden probably still runs into injury issues though, it seems like his knees were a genetic so maybe this worked out for the best. I don't think the Raptors would have picked Durant here but it's cool to think about."
"There is no doubt that the amount of hype around around the Heatles was huge, but even in that first season it became clear that the fit was awkward and even during that time, I never had the feeling I had with the Kevin Durant Warriors where I was like ""Outside of a major injury, noone is beating that team in a 7 game series"".  I have always thought that while Lebron's Big 3 were great teams, only the 2012-2013 Heat (and maybe the 2011-2012 team too) felt like true ""All-Time Great"" material. A big part of that has always been that it feels like the 3rd person of both big 3s (Bosh and Love respectively) were just not the right fits in terms of mindset and skillset. Both players found their roles on the teams and still played great, but it always felt like they were not in a role that maximized what made them star players.  I always felt like they needed a defensive monster with some real bite to them. Really the perfect Lebron 3rd teammate would be Klay Thompson since he is All-Time elite 3pt shooter and an awesome defensive player, but those don't grow on trees. But I feel like if he had a Kevin Garnett type or even Draymond Green as the third star, those teams would have flowed better."
"You have to factor in that Draymond Green was not going to shoot 38% from three going forward, which really made the team impossible to guard. Well, impossible to guard until Harrison Barnes decided to forget how to shoot, which then made them very easy to guard again because LeBron could play free safety.  The 2016 Finals was a defensive slugfest because neither team could score. If the Cavs added Korver and the Warriors did nothing, I would favor the Cavs for sure.  The 2017 Cavs were the best version of that team, better than the 2016 champions. They were an all-time historic offense. And defensively, they could guard the Warriors simply by ignoring Draymond and HB and playing 5 on 3.  Kevin Durant was overkill, yes. He's an all-time great player. But doing nothing would've just made the Warriors regress significantly on offense as the deadly three-point shooting, 6 threes in Game 7 version of Draymond was a huge outlier. If the Warriors don't upgrade at all, I'd take the Cavs in 6."
"Oscar Robertson was also debated as the best basketball player of all time during his time but I think we can pretty confidently say that Steph Curry could outplay him. Obviously Bird is in a significantly different situation and time but I’m just mentioning this example to show that there are instances where even someone known as the GOAT back then may not be prepared to match up with the best player today.   I’m not saying Larry bird wouldn’t be able to compete or anything ridiculous like that. I think his passing and rebounding is something that holds true regardless of era because if anything rebounding has gotten easier now and he would still be the second best passing forward today or maybe even the best depending on who you ask.   I just think Kevin Durant would be the better player in today’s game regardless of who ranks higher all time. Is that insane? Durant arguably outplayed Lebron in 2017, or at the very least was able to play at his level. If Durant can hold his own against someone whose commonly ranked above Larry Bird, I don’t think it’s insane to think he could outplay Bird whose game comes from a different era. I mean yeah he was a great shooter but he shot like two attempts per game. Even Lebron was able to hit 40% the one year that he whittled his attempts down. Idk what you want me to tell you if you can’t see that Durant is more versatile everywhere as a scorer."

"All time? You can make a team that matches them.  Modern era, if you want to beat that team, probably go something like   Kyle Lowry, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, and Joel Embiid, and then pretend that KD is still the old Durant.   You couldn’t make a team that would be favored against them from current players, only a team that could be somewhat competitive with them."
"Who would win in a game of 1 on 1, Thunderstruck Kevin Durant or Space Jam Charles Barkley?"
I don’t even like KD but you have to be delusional To not see that Kevin Durant is just a better basketball player from the eye test alone. You really think bird would outplay Durant? It’s not a knock against him cause that was the era but basketball has evolved.
"This Kevin Durant was unanimously loved, respected and adored. Now he's a snake with worthless rings. He really fucked his legacy by going to Golden State"
Kevin Durant is a better player than Bird.
PG- Chris Paul  SG- Klay Thompson   SF- Kevin Durant   PF- Draymond Green   C- Anthony Davis
"Damian Lillard, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Bam Adebayo"
"PG: Ben Simmons  He might not be able to shut Curry down but he has enough length to contest everything and he can abuse him in the post up.  He's got a good midrange game where he can just shoot over Steph while Jokic spaces the floor.   Or he can drive and kick to an open sniper - KD and Klay will definitely be open and Simmons is there to hit them with a pinpoint pass.    SG: Klay Thompson   Klay can catch fire and put up points in a hurry. He's also great defensively and should be able to slow down PG.  He'll be running all day long to get to his spots, and if Klay starts to heat up even PG won't be able to stifle him.    SF: Kevin Durant   Kawhi is a defensive monster. Durant is a scoring machine. He's going to get his points, or at least have a better shot than just about anyone else in the league.   He can score from anywhere on the floor and is the perfect offensive weapon. Defensively he should be able to give Kawhi some difficulty with his length.    PF: Draymond Green   Alright, so I didn't do this intentionally but we basically have the 2018 Warriors so far. I like Dray as a player who can contribute with great screens, smart defense, and crazy hustle. Plus he already has experience playing with Klay and KD.   He won't be scoring but he doesn't need to since his sole responsibility is harassing LeBron and slowing him down.   He can also switch onto Steph when guarding the pick and roll and make his life difficult.    C: Nikola Jokic   Jokic gives Simmons a floor spacing center and really opens things up for this team. He can initiate passes from the block to a cutting Simmons or Durant or kick it out to Klay coming off a screen from Draymond. Or he can set up for a three, pulling Giannis out of the paint and opening up more room for Simmons to abuse Steph on the drive.   On defense, he's going to have a tough time with Giannis.   --    This team is going to have great ball movement, with three playmakers who can hit the open man. They also have elite shooters in Klay and KD who can tear a defense apart alone.    Jokic is serviceable in the paint but he's going to have his hands full defensively with Giannis. His real value is being able to remove Giannis from the paint on defense and spacing the floor while also having a high passing IQ.    The perimeter defense is great with Simmons and Klay roaming. This team isn't going to give up many threes but they will be getting a lot of open looks.    The real weakness is the paint defense. Giannis could easily have his way with this team on the interior but you could say that about pretty much any team. Jokic will have his hands full trying to slow him down."
Not going to use retired players because that is too OP  PG: Matt Delly SG: Joe “Jinglebells” Ingles SF: Kevin “Snake” Durant PF: Anthony “23” Davis C: Joel Embiid ... or replace him with Zaza to counter Kawhi and cause a mismatch
"Damian Lilliard, Klay Thompson, Ben Simmons, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
"he was the ""defensive threat"" that was getting hunted down by zeke and dumars right?  saying tony allen and gary payton are on completely different tiers on defense is complete hyperbole, you don't lock down kevin durant and not be considered one of the better defenders in history. you are also putting way too much emphasis on steals, because tony allen in his 5 year defensive prime where he average the most steals was playing 24.6 minutes per game (2010-15) while gary payton in his 5 year defensive prime (1993-98) was averaging 37.7 minutes per game, nearly 50% more than tony allen. there truthfully isn't much separating the two of them, with the statistical difference being reasoned out due to tony allen not being able to stay on the court too much cuz off his offensive limitations while gary payton was an elite elite two-way player/  like i mentioned before, he was also getting steals by feeding off the pressure that the elite defenders around him provided.   magic was also not enhancing any defensive scheme, he was feeding off a defensive scheme that helped cover his weaknesses (lack of lateral mobility by letting him play free safety) and maximize his strengths (incredible court awareness and allowing him to gamble in passing lanes where there was minimal risk as he was on the oppositions weakest offensive threat).   I truthfully don't believe that the lakers get that much worse with nash instead of magic (on defense) even though they obviously aren't as good. my point was that if nash had been on a team with the ability like the lakers to cover for him defensively and minimize his weaknesses, he wouldn't be viewed as as bad a defender as he is."
Kevin Durant was a pretty bad choker in OKC but his performances in Golden State have completely erased that label.
[Kevin Durant couldn’t even bench 185](https://hoopshype.com/2017/05/11/kevin-durant-nba-combine-bench-press-poor-performance/amp/)
"God damn dude, just stop. Now you're nitpicking the difference between top 5% defender and top 10% defender or whatever. Fuck's sake this sub is insufferable sometimes. ""Nuh uh, he doesn't fit my personal definition of 'elite' !!!!"" Bro, who cares.  If you think it's fair to compare LaVine to Kevin fucking Durant when KD is literally better at every single aspect of the game, go right ahead"
"50 game playoff scoring peaks for current superstars  Kevin Durant '16-'19 (66 games): 38.1 points/100, +7.0 rTS  James Harden '15-'19 (61 games): 37.4 points/100, +3.5 rTS  Stephen Curry '15-17 (56 games): 37.1 points/100, +8.5 rTS  Kawhi '15-'19 (53 games): 37.1 points/100, +7.0 rTS  If you do just the most recent sample for Curry, he's at around 36 pts/100 on +7 rTS%.  So even if you wanna disqualify Curry and Durant for how good their team situation is, Kawhi just blows him out of the water  Edit: oh I forgot Lebron too, who completely crushes him"
"I think the only logical answer is that he is living out the plot to the movie ""Thunderstruck"", featuring Kevin Durant"
Or Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. There's only one ball!!!!!! Makes no sense.
"Honestly, I don't think he's going out of his way to do anything. You can say he's being accidentally obtuse or awkward and you might have a point (not sure I'd agree, but that's another conversation), but whatever he's doing, I don't think he's putting on some kind of show or purposefully trying to do or say anything he wouldn't say if this was a normal conversation. And it's not like it's an ENTIRELY absurd or pointless answer anyway. It's like saying ""I'm me."" It can be interpreted as more than just the literal statement of ""I'm literally myself,"" like how someone might say that to imply that they're unique and don't want to be put into a box or labeled with a certain description -- they are who they are and that's it. Even if Kawhi didn't mean any of that, from a reporter's standpoint, that's not a worthless answer by any stretch. For instance, maybe they want to paint him as the nonchalant ""robot"" that the media/fans have grown to know and love. Something like:  Reigning Finals MVP on How He Blocked LeBron's Shot at a 3-Peat: ""I'm Kawhi Leonard""  (gonna take a sec to pat myself on the back for the shot blocking wordplay there. pretty proud of that one ngl)  Something to that effect would be the sort of tongue-in-cheek headline, with maybe a little hint of potential arrogance on Kawhi's part, that would get plenty of clicks and attention. Shit, it was literally all over sports news when KD said pretty much the same thing during his crazy run in last year's playoffs: ""I'm Kevin Durant, Y'all know who I am."" I know the context was a little different but the fact remains that a quote like this is marketable.  Anyway, this post is getting a little longer than I meant it to, sorry about that, but the point I'm trying to make is that I think you're kind of overblowing how 'intentionally obtuse' kawhi is being and how much harder he's making Stuart Scott's job -- I genuinely think this was just the most immediately apparent answer to the question in Kawhi's mind, and again, Stuart Scott still has something to work with if his goal is to get a headline out of this interview."

Lmao all I said was “lebron could do that” how is that shitting on anyone or anything. Then balls in mouth guy comes along - I respond - but yet I’m miserable. Fool.   And yeah it feels as good as when you let Kevin Durant shit on your chest; then you rubbed it in as moisturizer.
"My second round prospect knowledge is pretty poor so at the time I just shrugged at Khris Middleton's selection. Figured the best case would be contributing in any way at all. Here's some draft grade excerpts at the time:  One:  &gt;Grade: B-  &gt;Middleton is a Kevin Durant clone, yet only not as explosive or as high-volume of a shooter. Some of the same skills are there, and hopefully he can continue to develop in Detroit with a good point guard in Brandon Knight.  Two:  &gt; Detroit added Texas A&amp;M wing Khris Middleton, who’s coming off a disappointing season yet has shot-making ability, along with Kim English, the sharpshooting guard out of Missouri who has specialist potential and defensive versatility. While there are no guarantees with any of them, it’s possible Detroit landed a star (Drummond), a specialist and a role player. Not too shabby for a team with only one first round pick.  Three:  &gt;""Middleton was rated as a late first-rounder last year before injuries derailed his junior season. He's a smooth scorer with a great midrange game. Kim English shot the lights out at Missouri this season and is seen as a cheap replacement for Ben Gordon. Overall, I thought the Pistons made the right calls at the right places in the draft.""  Other Pistons fans knew better than me but at the time Detroit traded him away, I figured he wouldn't be much of a loss (again, some fans at the time were correctly not pleased with sending him away). I just didn't know what he could be."
Dudes been hurt too much to play consistantly to constitute being in his prime. Not to memtion Kevin Durant wasnt prime Durant until his late 20's as was LeBron. Anything else?
"Because it’s not. The hand is just not low enough for that to ever be called a carry. If that’s a carry, then every hesi Kevin Durant has ever done is also a carry and basically every ball dominant player in the game carries on almost every possession.  Edit: every time kevin Durant dribbles almost he puts his fingers near the bottom of the ball.  Look in the beginning of this video. Even when he’s just doing normal dribbling, it looks similar to what harden did  https://youtu.be/a_BbPaHc2IU  Only casuals think that to dribble, you have to just push down on top of the ball or else it’s a carry. It’s always a sort of in and out motion and on a lot of moves the fingers get close to the bottom of the ball. A good key to see if it’s a carry is if the hand is higher than the elbow. That’s what refs look for a lot of the time"

"cherrypicking stats from very specific runs in his career is such a stupid way of bolstering your argument.  There is 0 argument for jordan to be a top 10 SHOOTER of all time. This is absurd that i even have to make this point.  He isnt top 100 in 2-pt fg %  He isn't top 250 in 3-pt fg %  He is barely top 100 in ts%  he isnt top 200 in efg %  and he isnt top 250 in 3pm  You're BEST argument is to pick a few playoff series in a few seasons and playoff series to put him over :  Stephen Curry, Kyle Korver, Steve Nash, Klay Thompson, JJ Redick, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Peja Stojakovic, Ray Allen, Glen Rice, Reggie Miller, Kevin Durant  Who off of this list is he a better SHOOTER than??  He is a better player than all of these guys, he is a better tough shot maker than any of these guys, but he is not a better shooter than any one of them. You're argument is disingenuous, check your bias and your idol worship before making such a silly argument."

"If you don't believe me, here's what [Steve Kerr](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/28/steve-kerr-says-warriors-were-at-their-best-in-2017-no-question/) had to say:  Q: What stands out about that Finals series to you?  “I think that was the highest level of basketball I’ve ever seen in my life. I just thought that was Cleveland’s best team of the four years that we faced them. I thought they were much better that year than they were the previous year when they beat us in seven. Obviously, we were a lot better as well, adding Kevin Durant to the mix and being fully healthy and motivated and ready to go. So the level of play was just astounding. Particularly at the offensive end.  “You know, that was, to me, when everything sort of came to a head in terms of where the game had been heading from a spacing standpoint and a position-less standpoint. We got to a point in that series where LeBron was basically playing the five — playing up like a point center, and he’s the biggest guy on the floor for them. And they had four shooters around him, and he would just penetrate and they had such great spacing that you had to honor everybody, and he could just get right to the rim.  “So it was terrifying trying to defend them. It was terrifying for them to try to defend us too.”  Q: When you say that was the best of LeBron’s Cavs teams, was it because of what you were just talking about, or was there something else?  “I think there’s always another level for a championship team to reach the following season because there’s a new, deeper sense of confidence that didn’t exist. Once you win your first title, there’s such a deep level of confidence that it takes you to a new level. So just like us in ’16 after winning the title in ’15, we were way better in ’16. Even though we didn’t end up winning the championship, we were a much better team than we were in ’15. I thought the same thing was true for Cleveland. They had broken through and they were playing with that kind of championship swagger. They believed they could do it, they were fully healthy and they were a great, great team. But we had the ultimate weapon in Kevin, and nobody had an answer for him.”"
"What advanced metrics? I'm genuinely curious. The only advance metric I know is offensive rating, and the [2017 Cavs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2017.html#all_misc) had the [best playoff offensive rating of all time](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/06/01/cavaliers-hiding-unimpressive-defense-behind-record-setting-playoff-offense/).

Its carrying a historic load.  &gt;The Cavaliers are scoring 123.2 points per 100 possessions in the playoffs – on pace to smash the record in the 16-team postseason format (enacted in 1984). The difference between Cleveland’s offensive rating and No. 2 (1987 Lakers, 120.3) is greater than the difference between No. 2 and No. 11.  &gt;In simplest terms, the Cavs offense is built around LeBron James. If single-covered, he scores. If double-teamed, he passes to usually-open, usually-good 3-point-shooting team. Mix in Kyrie Irving‘s isolations, Kevin Love‘s outside-inside game and Tristan Thompson‘s offensive rebounding, and it’s just too much for opponents to handle.  &gt;The Cavaliers have made 43% of their 3-pointers and 56% of their 2-pointers and generated 27 free-throw attempts per game this postseason.  &gt;Their playoff offensive rating is 14.4 points better than the regular-season league average. That scoring has propped up a playoff defense at the regular-season league average."
"I can’t understand why people think it’s even debatable lol, the 2017 Warriors replaced Barnes with Kevin Durant. That’s all ya gotta know  Best team ever imo"
"https://fadeawayworld.net/2018/10/18/the-unknown-nba-player-who-averaged-over-100-point-per-36-minutes/  &gt;Forget about Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant. If you’re looking for a scorer, you’ve got to go find Naz Mitrou-Long’s highlights. You’re probably never going to find them, because “3zus of Nazareth” only spent a minute on an NBA hardwood. Still, the shooting guard posted a PER of 133.8 with 100% shooting and an average of 108 points per 36 minutes. He’s the ultimate GOAT.&gt;"
We're talking about the 17' warriors. the team that blew the lead added Kevin Durant.
How has nobody mentioned the Kevin Durant/LeBron James charge/offensive foul reviewed and still incorrect that lost the Cavs a playoff game. The NBA has to apologize for the egregiousness of the play call.
"Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, both are acceptable answers to me"
"It's funny because this and the Obama visit were in 2015-16 when they were chasing the record. The next year they added Kevin Durant.  Normally, that would end the argument. If you thought it was comparable before, now it shouldn't be. But the 2016-17 team ""only"" won 67 games so the GOAT team stuff never became a talking point, despite them being objectively better than the 2015-16 team."
"Your selling Myers pretty short here. His first season as GM he helped get the team to its best postseason in decades and drafted Harrison Barnes &amp; Draymond Green. After the 2014-15 regular season, Myers was named the NBA Basketball Executive of the Year after key decisions he made led to the Warriors having an NBA best 67–15 record, including hiring coach Steve Kerr and signing Klay Thompson to a contract extension after declining to trade him and other players in the offseason for Kevin Love. People also forget how great the Warriors bench was. Myers won NBA Executive of the Year again after signing Kevin Durant, David West, Zaza Pachulia, and Javale McGee in the 2016 off-season. And as great as Milwaukee is, they haven’t won anything yet so it’s hard to say they have a better front office than the team that went to 5 straight finals."

Kevin Durant facial compilation
I mean fuck Kevin Durant and all that (yeah he took my lunch money so what?!?!??) But this title is a biiig pause
A 'facial' is an informal term often used in pornography to describe the act of a man ejaculating onto the face of a sexual partner. It is my belief that /u/MapleLeaf57 was making a joke about being mislead into believing three Lakers players were taking turns to perform this act on the face of Kevin Durant.
"If he were anywhere but New Orleans, he'd be safe, but the food there is good enough to turn even Kevin Durant into a fatty if he stays long enough."

Data is the enemy of the common NBA fan. Stats are meaningless. The only thing that matters is a perfectly spaced floor for kevin Durant to do isolation scoring in. He is the best player ever. He’s so tall it blows my brain apart. My eye test is the only way to evaluate a player. Ben taylor is funded by the CIA.
He’s Kevin Durant lol. His game doesn’t rely on being an athletic freak. His game is based on instinct. You don’t just lose that after 20 months.   Y’all know who he is.
"Bro what type of stupid logic is this? I hate this cop out of an argument, it’s used way too often.   1.) When playing with good players, the expectation is for raw numbers to go down. In a lot of those games, he carried a struggling Steph and a Warriors team that lacked depth.  2.) What is this belief that KD is just shooting open jumpers every game? The Clippers double teamed KD the whole series. He literally talked about it in his “I’m Kevin Durant” speech in this series. You can trap one player off screens, and soft double another from the corner. Especially when said team has two non shooters on the court with Iggy and Draymond.   The spacing argument is just so ridiculously one sided as well. Y’all mention the great spacing of the Warriors, and try to use his OKC numbers as a benchmark, as if that team had some sort of normal spacing with Westbrook, Roberson and co.   The dude literally had one of the most efficient Finals ever in 2017, yet people excuse it with “look at his team” as if his open shot frequency wasn’t extremely low. Even lower than that of Lebrons and Stephs."
"When it comes to Kyrie, I'm on the side of an all or nothing approach. I think that unless Kyrie and Kevin Durant are healthy enough to play together, Kyrie should stay away from the team. I don't want healthy Kyrie by himself, and I definitely don't want philosophical woke Kyrie on the bench injured trying to enlighten other players. Give me KD and Kyrie, or give me nothing. I don't want anything in between."
Investing in post mates doesn’t really need a business insiders help when you’re Kevin Durant either. And it’s likely to turn out to be a bad investment when it’s all said and done.
• Golden State Warriors  • Kevin Durant  • Houston Astros and Rockets
"&gt; LeBron James in the last ten postseasons (2009-18): 37.9 points per-100 possessions, 59.1% TS  &gt; Kevin Durant in the postseason with OKC after his first run (2011-16): 35.9 points per-100 possessions, 58.1% TS  So your original claim is wrong since LeBron is a clearly better scorer. His efficiency also dipped less than 2%, compared to Durant's 4%."

"Nobody’s not giving Kevin Durant credit there cause that absolutely was a great game but tbh everyone knew the series was basically over in G1 and that Game 3 was close but again after the “JR game”, the deal was sealed"
I wasn’t aware Kevin Durant played in this game
"&gt; You put Kevin Durant on that same Lakers team and they're missing playoffs too,   You know what, I don't know if that's true.  Lebron's true greatness is in unlocking the offensive potential of his teammates. The Lakers had a good defense that year, the issue was offense. Take Lebron out and KD ISOs the fuck out of everyone Harden style, and with their strong defense they may very well make it.   It doesn't mean that it's a championship team or that Lebron can't lead better teams than KD. But in certain situations, plugging KD in will utilize KD to his fullest, while Lebron's potential will still be partly locked (because no one can fucking shoot)."
"LeBron averaged like 29/10/10 after the ASB and did everything he could until he got shut down for the season. He was also coming off a groin injury which is a brutal injury for any player because re-aggravating can cause serious issues. You put Kevin Durant on that same Lakers team and they're missing playoffs too, it was just too late for them and they had to be almost perfect to close out the season."
"As someone who has ruptured their achilles, i find it baffling that Kevin Durant wouldnt come back and play in early august. It would be 14 months post operation which is a very long time, and most professional athletes come back in 10 months. IMO to me it means something is still wrong or he has another injury."
"I don't get why blazers fans try to diminish the value CJ brings so often. He's not super efficient but he opens the floor up a ton since he's so good at midrange and 3 pt shooting. He's literally one of the best midrange shooters in the NBA, averaging 50 percent from there the last 2 years, similar numbers to Kevin Durant. Nurkic is probably better but I just don't get why so many blazers fans throw one of their players under the bus so often."
"Dude, LeBron’s teams always have elite spacing, even in 2009 they were the best 3pt shooting team in the league. Curry’s teams have spacing &amp; run heavy screening offense. Kawhi had elite spacing in San antonio/Toronto. OKC aside from when they had harden, didn’t even have one league average shooter on the team. Why do you keep ignoring this? The playing field just isn’t level. LeBron has shooting at almost every single position. He deliberately spaced the floor at every position so he can get to the rim, Before Cleveland, His true shooting from 2010-2014 was 59 TS. KD’s from 2011-2016 was 58 TS. Lebron had Mike Miller/Ray Allen/Battier/Bosh on weakside coverages to space the floor. It’s just not the same as Kevin Martin/Reggie Jackson. LeBron’s offensive Box plus minus was 7.5 while Durant’s during that same stretch was 7.2.  I do agree LeBron is better offensively, but not by the margin you’re citing.  “A healthier LeBron separates himself from KD by a margin that is hardly comparable, unless you want to copy and paste his stats from warriors where he had the most help ever”  I disagree, They definitely are comparable when both players are in similar circumstances. If you’re going to disregard everything KD did on the warriors as too much help, than you have to disregard anything LeBron did on Cleveland because he had by far the 2nd best spacing team in the league. Cavs were the best 3pt shooting in the league 3 out of 4 years. Just watch any LeBron film in his 2nd Cleveland stint. Players rarely help off the shooters on his team.  Even without Curry on the floor from 2016-2019 in the playoffs , Durant was 61 TS from the field &amp; ran a 114 Ortg which is higher than Any offense Kobe ever ran for the playoffs in LA.  This is why I wish KD went to Boston or Clippers, He would’ve improved his playoff True shooting &amp; wouldnt get garbage arguments like these aimlessly referencing his OKC tenure anytime when he wasn’t even in his prime when discussions with a player are brought up.   “You’re deliberately ignoring where I said Kobe vs the western conference”  What a meaningless sample size, we’re talking about entire playoff runs, also, KD faced just as good of elite defensive teams in the Spurs/clippers/Grizzles. You’re also berating me for taking out KD’s rookie playoff campaign but you’re using a very specific subset of Kobe’s playoff career but apparently I’m the one with a narrative.     “Kobe is a far better playmaker, takes care of the ball better, has higher scoring rate per 100, Kobe actually gets better”   When you factor in KD’s gravity as a shooter, His scoring pressure, &amp; offball game, KD’s a better playmaker. In the regular season, it’s not close between the two, in the playoffs From 2011-2013 compared to Kobe’s 2008-2010, KD’s had the higher OBPM, offensive winshares &amp; His True shooting eclipses any advantage Kobe had in per 100 scoring rates.   It doesn’t matter if Kobe gets better, he’s starting from a much lower vantage point than KD. KD’s playoff Numbers for OKC are still better from 2011-2016 than Kobe’s was from 2008-2010.   Also, I don’t think you seem to understand this concept at all. Even If KD declined in the playoffs in OKC, (where he had one healthy playoff run after 2012), he’s still dropping from a very far place making him still one of the very elite playoff players in league history. For example, If Kyle lowry gets better in the playoffs but Curry gets worse, Curry is still the better play-off performer objectively because he’s declining from a much higher cliff.   But from 2011 to 2013 &amp; 2008 to 2010, KD improved on all fo his regular season numbers, More so at a rate   Again, We’re comparing a 29-31 year old prime physical Kobe to Durant that wasn’t in his prime at any point in his OKC tenure &amp; their numbers are still very similar. You keep telling me to use 2014 and 2016 but you’re using Kobe’s two best playoff seasons in his career.  While KD has slightly a higher TOV% (this can be due to the fact that he Played in a real offensive system) ,  his offensive winshares, OBPM , and true shooting are much higher. I don’t think Kobe’s marginal per 100 scoring rate matters in this instance because of KD’s far superior efficiency here.   Also, Like the commenter explained above me, TS is a holistic Stat. You need atleast 5 seasons to get an accurate picture of a player &amp; there is still some context involved. Using year by year just doesn’t make sense to me.   People Just don’t realize how much these offensive based metrics are effected by spacing. TOV% relies on how spaced your floor is &amp; whether you’re running a real offensive system. The more cramped the floor is, the harder it is to make plays for teammates.  The fact is from 2011-2016, KD was 58 True shooting on 29.2 pts on 7.5 OBPM With some of those playoff campaigns marred by injury &amp; very little to no spacing.   On a league average spacing team he’s be 62-64 TS easily. To act like he’s not one of the best playoff performers in league history is just not true."
Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez were just as big of stars as Steph Curry and Kevin Durant (not quite LeBron's level)  So I don't know if it just happened in the past decade or so but MLB used to have household names.
Dude just downvoted me.  PROOF that was Kevin Durant!  OUTED!
"Are you Kevin Durant?  ... If I ask you, you are legally obligated to tell me"
"Yeah, my bias against him has grown even more now that he's apparently [cashing in on drone surveillance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/06/03/funded-by-kevin-durant-and-founded-by-ex-googlers-this-drone-startup-is-scoring-millions-in-government-surveillance-contracts/#335ad6ab4e9e)."
"[This](https://www.si.com/nba/2020/05/11/kevin-durant-not-playing-nba-season-brooklyn-nets) is from a month ago, and addresses the possibility of the season re-starting.

"&gt;Spurs  Sleeping on the Iceman a bit, which is understandable because history as a whole tends to sleep on him. He was racking up NBA scoring titles pre-Jordan.  Edit: He's tied for third all-time (alongside Allen Iverson and Kevin Durant) with four scoring titles ('78, '79, '80, '82). Topped out at 33.1 in 1980. Only Wilt Chamberlain (7) and Michael Jordan (10) have more."
Wow no shit?? You’re saying Kevin Durant is an investor and didn’t invent surveillance technology in a garage during the off-season?   Pretty wild speculation my man
Why would you think Kevin Durant is picking which companies he’s investing in? What does Kevin Durant know about business? He has financial management people who invest his money. He’s probably invested in a lot of things.
"&gt;The entire 2015 postseason. He was inefficient in every series but still played extremely well....  LeBron was not a postseason god in 2015. I do not agree with the idea that LeBron's volume made up for his extreme inefficiency when that is no excuse for his inability to hit outside shots with any degree of consistency, and there have been players in past years in similar circumstances who have managed to be far more efficient in the postseason. Allen Iverson is one of them. Of course LeBron is typically a far better scorer than Iverson, but in 2015 postseason he was not. Spacing wasn't entirely his issue (we've seen LeBron play better with limited spacing elsewhere) - he'd lost a lot of lift athletically and had lingering knee, back issues that caused him to take a two week break in January to remedy. A healthier James performs better in the postseason and separates himself from KD by a margin that is hardly comparable. Unless you want to copy paste his stats on the Warriors where he had the most support of any superstar in modern history.  &gt;That’s a simplistic way of looking at it  It is not. LeBron is quite literally on a different tier than Kevin Durant offensively because of his playmaking. This is what seperates them peak for peak. Thank god I'm about to ignore you so I don't have to hear what inane logic you use to argue to the contrary.    &gt;Well, you’re comparing a pre prime Durant to a prime Kobe physically and mentally but I’ll still entertain this.  Then use KD in 2016? Use KD in 2014? When he won MVP I wonder why you are ignoring this runs, hmm.   &gt;OKC’s best floor spacers during the KD years was Derrick Fisher and Ibaka....  You included a stretch where James Harden was on the team.  &gt;KD from 2011-2013-  &gt;29.4pts/8.8/4.4ast 61 TS 8.5 BPM  &gt;Kobe from 2008-2010-  &gt;29.7pts/5.7rbs/5.5ast 56 TS 8.0 BPM  You are deliberately ignoring where I said Kobe versus the Western Conference. You cut that part out of the quote. Your delusion continues to be impressive. His per 100 scoring rates far eclipse Durant's, his playmaking dwarfs Durant's while being far better at protecting the ball, and best of all he IMPROVES upon his RS performance while KD GETS WORSE and stagnates. 2012 is the only OKC run he ever had where he performed better than his RS self.  Notice you didn't include KD's MVP season in 2014. I wonder why? Went from a 63 TS% in the RS to a 57 TS% in the playoffs. Went from scoring 41 points per 100 to 35. But people like yourself will ignore the RS and view his playoff performance in a vacum as if he isn't clearly declining.   &gt;Ummm, From 2011 to 2016 (excluding rookie campaign) he was 29.1 pts on 58 true shooting on very high volume w/o playing in a real offensive system or with elite shooters around him.   2008 was KD's rookie campaign. What are you talking about. 2010 marked his first superstar level season; sure sounds like you're once again trying to manipulate the data to suit your narrative as you know it would damage your argument. But lets play your game. In 2011-2016 Durant is at 38.5 points per 100 possesions on 62 TS% in the RS. A lack of offensive system, lack of elite shooters didn't stop him from performing in such a way. Wasn't an excuse then.   in 2011-2016 Durant is down to 35.9 points per 100 on 58 TS%. Down from as much as +10 above league average to merely +4. Now its an excuse! KD needs more help, better support, wah wah. This is only an elite postseason performer is your bar is lowered for that distinction. If he's elite what the hell is LeBron, omega elite? Not a god, thats for sure.  Try to get some help for your internet obsession with Curry. Someone who no matter how hard you try behind your computer screen, will continue to be viewed as an all time great. As promised, putting you on ignore."
"Kevin Durant, because he's a bitch."
Is this a championship lineup?:  Steph Curry  Klay Thompson   Draymond Green  Kevin Durant  Andre Igudola  6th man fuckin anyone

"Kawhi Leonard &gt; Kevin Durant. As a basketball player, aa a human"
"&gt; Ahead of Thursday's announcement that the league will resume on July 31, Caesars Sportsbook on Wednesday lowered Brooklyn's championship odds from 750-1 to 60-1. The Nets are currently the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference but could return Durant and , who underwent arthroscopic right shoulder surgery in February.  &gt; ""I would rather be cautious and deal 60-1 than get hurt when we hear news [of Durant and Irving returning],"" Caesars director of trading Jeff Davis told ESPN.

"We know he's vain, maybe he funded these guys so he can see the top of his head and make sure his hair cut is looking good.  Jokes aside — Andre Iguodala was more influential in getting Kevin Durant into the venture capital scene. KD isn't managing this money, he's just letting rich tech guys do it and in return they all get to say they're friends with Kevin Durant. Everyone is using everyone."
Lmfao we just not gonna compare OG to kevin fucking durant
&gt; Kevin Durant Buys Minority Stake  Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
"Crazy how Kevin Durant could be funding tyrannical, Orwellian government surveillance and that still isn't as bad as joining the 73-9 core he blew a 3-1 lead to"
"What an amazingly well written letter too. I don't care if anyone helped him or what, I'm really happy with Russ, man. I have loved him as a player but the more I learn about him as an individual, the more I love him as an altogether role model that I'm proud of my son being a fan of.  He's a fucking monster on the court, a loving father and husband at home, and a marketing savant when it comes to his Jordan brand and the ""Why Not?"" trademark.   I'd say Russel's a pretty good role model for anyone to imitate. Anyone that hates him either doesn't understand him, possibly a bit jealous, or just hates something about themselves that Russ is a beast at.  I used to hate Steph Curry, around that year he was MVP. Then I realized it was because he was excelling at a brand of basketball that I've struggled with, in my own life. That reliable 3 point dagger that he could hit from anywhere, with the step back and the handles. Plus, the son of a bitch was so damn happy all the time! Another struggle of mine at the time, struggling with depression and happiness.  Then I learned what this guy does off the court, how much of a family man he is, how much his teammates love him, and how he just does all of this with so little stress because he just lives his life and follows his faith. Hard to hate somebody like that when you would be more than happy for your son to follow him as role model too.  Not sure what my point was in all this except to express that if you hate a basketball player, or any athlete, I'd encourage you to take a minute to understand why. I still hate Kevin Durant, but I'm in the process of understanding him as a person. He's a hell of a guy off the court too from what I've read so far, I'm hoping I've found another amazing human being that my son can be a fan of and maybe even emulate (I'll only be allowing him one Instagram account tho so he can't compliment himself.)"
Kevin Durant played on a fantastic okc team his whole career and still couldn’t win a ring so bird hypothetically winning one ring is more than kd could do. Kd had the talent to win there but he just couldn’t so he joined the super friends. Birds teams were beatable because of the other ridiculous teams in the 80s. And you can discount team success all you want that’s fine but bird had a lot more individual accolades than kd.
"Do tell how he was a postseason god in 2016.   Efficiency is kinda important, you know, for one of the most efficient scorers in NBA history. Suddenly he's not that anymore in the playoffs. Suddenly he's struggling to crack league average on threes in the playoffs while chucking north of six per game. Kevin Durant shooting 28% from three in a playoff run shouldn't be swept under a rug."
The same team that drafted Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan as well as Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.
there was a proposed trade centered around blake griffin for kevin durant in like 2013.  It didnt gain traction but i would have loved to have seen westbrook/blake in OKC and cp3/KD for the Clippers.
No we're supposed to ignore that and AD's trade demand and Paul George's and only focus our hate on Kevin Durant for leaving as a free agent.
Better than Kevin Durant. Dude was cut from the same cloth as Jordan and Kobe.
"Nets have had a sorted history including one of the absolute worst trades in NBA history in 2013 where we gave up a huge amount of future picks for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry, all of which while good players back in the day were over the hill and declining when we got them. We were then subsequently handily squashed in the 2nd round of the playoffs. Since then we've struggled and until last season were one of (and at some points straight up were) the worst teams in the entire league.   However, in 2016 we fired our previous GM who had spearheaded that horrible decision and hired former Player and Assistant Coach to the Spurs, Sean Marks. Over the next couple years he made legit galaxy brain moves to bring in people who could make a difference and built up a great culture to the point that we were kind of the darlings of the NBA last season where we finally made the playoffs again. Although we did lose in Round 1, what had been done with our franchise as a whole was apparently enough to attract Kyrie Irving (arguable top 10 PG of all time) and KEVIN FUCKING DURANT. Now KD of course tore his Achilles in the playoffs last year and isn't expected to return until the 2020/2021 season, and Kyrie had shoulder surgery in late February and likely is out for the rest of this season too, but come next year, we are going to be an absolute dominant force.  Oh, and since you're from Australia, if you're familiar with Aunty Donna, then you'd probably be interested to know that Broden is apparently a Nets fan which makes me so happy.  https://i.imgur.com/6jtCaSv.jpg"
Dude if Kevin Durant had to go up against this guy in today’s game he probably wouldn’t show up to the arena and call In sick.   DNP - Scared 😱   Because that’s just how tough Unseld was as a competitor.
"Demarcus Cousins. Kevin Durant. John Wall is our franchise player. We did not plan to compete this year, we don’t have a roster to legitimately compete this year. We just got lucky a virus swept the world so we could get the ninth seed."
"&gt; 2005 San Antonio Spurs Got lucky that Lakers disbanded the season prior    &gt;   &gt; 2003 San Antonio Spurs Only won because they played 49 wins Nets in the finals   Lol, man those Spurs asterix' are weak.  And, in that 2003 season, the Nets were the second seed in the East, while Detroit was only a 50 win team, so they actually got about as hard a Finals opponent as was available, after going through Shaq's Lakers and Dirk's Mavs to get there.  &gt; 2018 Golden State Warriors Got lucky that CP3 got injured in WCF and Rockets missed 27 straight threes in game 7   &gt;   &gt;2017 Golden State Warriors The Warriors were down 20 points in the WCF before Kawhi got injured   For these, you also forgot the once in a lifetime salary cap blip that even allowed the Dubs to add Kevin Durant to the core of a 73 win team."
"KD's only out cause of his leg right?  According to this, he never had any symptoms when he had covid: https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/nets-kevin-durant-deemed-free-of-covid-19-symptoms/"
"&gt;And Lebron faced a 73 win warrior team, and **a 73 team warrior team with Kevin Durant twice.**  You get credit for losing 8 of 9 games to a great team?"
The Warriors added Kevin Durant to a 73 win team. Lebron faced that Warrior team with Durant twice. Maybe you misinterpreted what I said
&gt; 73 team warrior team with Kevin Durant twice  are you actually dumb or do you think the warriors won 73 games three years in a row...i get you're being a homer and all but don't be daft
"And Lebron faced a 73 win warrior team, and a 73 team warrior team with Kevin Durant twice. Jordan played good competition but Lebron player great competition"
"Durant losing in 5 to the heatles is more impressive than Iverson losing in 5 to the lakers because of the roads they took to get there. Iverson beat a 41 win pacers team, 47 win raptors team, and 52 win Bucks team that would’ve been like 6th in the west. It’s not fair to use records when comparing the teams Durant beat because it was a lockdown season but the teams he faced were better than any team Iverson faced on his way to the finals. Durant is a better defender than Iverson, and also can score just as much while shooting more efficiently. If we were going purely off ability and what they’re able to do as a player I’ve got Kevin Durant as one of the top 10 best, and one of the top 15 greatest"
"&gt;	It’s not even close. Jordan was a WAY better scorer especially in the playoffs than Durant  Regular Season-  Kevin Durant: 27 ppg on 18.7 FGA/game, 61.3%TS.   Michael Jordan: 30.1 ppg on 22.9 FGA/game, 56.9%TS  Playoffs-  Kevin Durant: 29.1 ppg on 20.7 FGA/game, 59.7%TS.   Michael Jordan: 33.4 ppg on 25.1 FGA/game, 56.8%TS.   Y’all are sensationalizing. If we’re talking about scoring output, it’s actually really close. But if you talk about scoring arsenal, despite being a much worse 3 point shooter than Durant, Jordan’s scoring arsenal is better than Durant’s."
"I don't like durant, but comparing Giannis to KD, in terms of scoring, is laughable.    Kevin Durant on OKC vs the Heat as a 23 year old, was unstoppable. He averaged like 30 in the finals at that age.  Ridiculous.   KD is unstoppable, but he chooses not to go for crazy high numbers. Needed more of an alpha mentality."
[He had a cover story in *Sports Illustrated* last year that may be a good place to start.](https://www.si.com/high-school/2019/10/29/emoni-bates-nba-draft-prospect-kevin-durant)
"He has improved every year regardless of his team's situation though, even prior to this year. For example, in his third year he had Bledsoe replaced by Tyler Ulis, Mike James, Shaq Harrison, and Elfrid Payton and still improved in all meaningful stats. Unless you're saying that the Suns progressively improved their roster year to year over his tenure, which I would *definitely* disagree with.  Also I'm pretty surprised that even a 64 TS% at his volume wouldn't change your ranking. For context, at 18 FGA/g the only people in NBA history to clear that mark are Steph Curry and Adrian Dantley in their prime years. Even at 63% you only add Kevin Durant. Drop the attempts to 16 and you're introducing names like Lebron, Giannis, and Barkley. That would be a pretty incredible bar to clear and not be impressed by."
"You never really know how things will shake out in the end but dude currently looks like a Kevin Durant clone. I watched him roast a school in my area that's generally filled with ""normal"" high school players but he seems to cook at AAU and top prospect tourneys just the same."
&gt; JJ is officially listed as an inch taller than Jrue.  WTF does that matter.  Kevin Durant is half a foot taller.  But he is not as physically built as Jrue Holiday.
"LeBron is an elite creator with elite athleticism who scores proficiently, but he’s not as much of a threat from everywhere like Kevin Durant or MJ was. He is really inefficient out of the post and from mid range, which is why as great as he is, I wouldn’t call him an elite scorer."
I'm guessing you're gonna post Kevin Durant exposes LeBron's overrated defense 2017 Finals video next or maybe another CP3 one
Kevin Durant got manhandled that series.
there was a reason for Oden being number 1 over Kevin freaki g Durant. If not for injuries he would've been a monster
"It’s discredited cause Durant never came close to that level of play, even on elite teams like OKC during their best runs in 2011-12 and 2015-16. Because he couldn’t pull it off without having the two greatest shooters ever by his side as well as a multitude of other shooters. This dude even admitted he went to GSW so it would be easy asf for him.   &gt; [My agent, Rich Kleiman, who’s here, we were watching Game 7. Well, as it started to unfold, it was, ‘No question, no way could you go to this team.’ And I was just like a kid, like, ‘I’d really like playing with these guys. I’d get wide-open threes, I could just run up and down the court, get wide-open layups.’ I was basically begging him. I was like, ‘Yo, this would be nice.](https://247sports.com/nba/golden-state-warriors/Article/Kevin-Durant-says-he-begged-his-agent-to-let-him-sign-with-the-Golden-State-Warriors-48175711/)"
"You idiots are really trynna compare that Warriors supporting cast to the Cavs. After Kyrie, who did the Cavs have? TT? Kevin love? JR Smith? Old ass Richard Jefferson? Who did the Warriors have after Durant? Curry, Klay, Draymond, Iguodala, West, Livingston. But yea, it sure was pathetic of LeBron and the Cavs to not win."
"First of all again you insisted that not having a finals mvp was a knock against curry but it’s not a knock against cp3. Also you’re just assuming Paul’s teams were the reason he hasn’t been there. it’s not like Chris Paul has been playing with scrubs. He’s had deandre Jordan, Blake griffin, and James harden. Are you saying those players are scrubs? And let me guess you’re gonna bring up the Kevin Durant fact. But I’ll counter with the fact that curry has been to and won a championship without Durant. Also when Durant went down. Curry and the rest of the warriors still beat the rockets with chris Paul completely healthy and the rockets team completely healthy."
Kevin Durant: Joining Warriors was hardest road to a ring.
"The way I see it, they ended the Warriors super team era. The same way that the 04 pistons ended the Shaq-Kobe Lakers era.   After they lost, they no longer have: Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Demarcus Cousins, Shaun Livingston, Andrew Bogut and Quinn Cook. They were all solid contributors, some more than others obviously.   Even if they come back heathy next year, they aren’t going to be anywhere nearly as stacked. Plus the league has changed with duos rather than super teams."
"Kevin Durant can't be #2, he's coming off a devastating injury. You need to exclude him.   Also how can Kawhi be a SF and Paul George be a SF. They both play on the same time. One has to be PF or a SG."
"*And had [his picture taken with a couple of scrubs like Kawhi, KD, and LeBron](https://www.wkyc.com/amp/article/sports/nba/cavaliers/cleveland-cavaliers-f-cedi-osman-recalls-workout-with-lebron-james-kevin-durant-and-kawhi-leonard/95-597910054)"
Because the heat team without lebron is equivalent to the warriors team without Kevin Durant? Good one.
"Kevin Durant has been the best player in the world since 2016. Rings or no rings, he has been insanely dominant these past few years. I hope he gets appreciated before he retires"
you told me kevin durant exposed him?!
"I'm not saying that there's *no* argument for Steph being a floor raiser, I just think that using 2019 (or really any year with Durant on the team) is a terrible way to support that argument.  GSW had to win one quarter and one game without Durant against Houston, what the hell are you talking about?  The midway point of the series was the end of game 3.  Kevin Durant hurt himself with about 2 minutes left in the third quarter of game 5. There's a big difference between winning 12 quarters without Durant (which is what you are saying) and 5 quarters without Durant (what actually happened.)  Again, I don't disagree with your sentiment overall, but I wouldn't use any years where Durant was on the team (including 2019) to make the case that Curry is a floor raiser."
Kevin Durant lol
"See 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. Kevin Durant got injured midway through the Rockets series, GSW still had to win 2 games without him. Klay averaged 21 PPG on 47 TS% ( worse then CJ Mccolum and 8% below league average) and Curry averaged 36PPG on 67 TS% in the WCF. People also say Klay is not top 15 and Draymond is Mr Triple Single when it’s convinent and they want to hate on GSW."
"Listen, I'm not opposed to the argument overall but mentioning the 2019 playoffs where he played alongside Kevin Durant for almost the entire Rockets series and Klay for the entire run minus a couple games is disingenuous as shit in the context of being a floor raiser."

It was about 70/30 percent-wise for Oden iirc. Most people thought the blazers were making the right call with Oden.   Kevin Durant is considered the second best prospect since LeBron. Oden who was considered the best happened to be in the same draft so he went over Durant.

You know you're only proving my point, right? Having a team like that makes it easier for them to win healthy and harder to win unhealthy.  &gt; Just like the Warriors beat the Cavs in 2015 but they didn’t really “beat” the Cavs due to their injuries  Injuries happen.  &gt; but not really due to the fact that those weren’t the dynasty Warriors.  It was the same team except they were injured because management invested too heavily in a limited amount of players. It's not supposed to always pay off - do you think people who invest in stocks are entitled to profit? Have a RIGHT to receive 5x on whatever they paid?  &gt; but you didn’t beat the best version of them and you didn’t beat an extension of the dynasty.  That's not our fault. GSW chose to remain top heavy. It didn't pay off. Shit happens. Look at where they are this season and look where we are, how do you think it turned out?"

get shit on by Kevin Durant shouldn’t make ur defense overrated lmao....I doubt many would do a good job guarding a 2k15 demigod
"Kevin Durant can't expose anyone because he's unguardable, next thread"
I don't remember it.  I remember Oden played for like 2 years then couldn't come back. Injured his first year as well.   At least Kevin Durant had a great career!
"Wow, I didn't know the details, just saw this:  &gt; Still sweating, Oden explains that when he was in sixth grade, he grew so volcanically -- 6 inches in less than a year -- that his right hip detached from its socket. After surgery to place two pins in the joint, Oden enjoyed swinging his gangly legs on crutches down the hallways at school. But though the procedure worked, it left his right leg 8 millimeters shorter than his left. He walked with a bit of a dip, leaving people to assume that he was strutting, acting hard. Over time, his body adjusted, but the hip required the occasional heavy tug when it jammed.  &gt; After Oden was drafted first overall by the Trail Blazers in 2007, one pick ahead of Kevin Durant, the team outfitted him with a special orthotic insert to even his legs. ""Three weeks later, I'm in surgery,"" he says. Oden can't prove that the orthotic is the sole reason his body collapsed in the NBA. The wheels were in motion for his body to fall apart the moment he hit his first growth spurt on the way to 7 feet. Everything in his life since has been governed by it.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19868061/cursed-body-was-blessing-greg-oden-headed-back-ohio-state"
"&gt; From the videos ive been watching i quite like Stephen Curry, but i checked and his teams won 5 in a row, so that feels a bit glory hunter to support them.   This is what we call a ""bandwagon fan"", basically a fair-weather fan who only supports a team when it's good. In the past few years the term became synonymous with ""Warriors fan"" because they were super stacked, they had 2 MVP caliber players, a DPOY, another All-NBA talent and other good pieces.  Now things are a bit different, Kevin Durant has left the team, Draymond Green has gotten worse and Steph isn't getting any younger. This year they're already out of the playoff race, but maybe next year they'll be better. Still, nobody would call you a bandwagon if you started following the Warriors now.  The best teams at the moment are the Bucks, the Lakers and the Clippers. Then you have the Raptors (defending champions, but their best player from last year left for the Clippers), Celtics, Nuggets, Rockets, Heat and Jazz, also decent. The promising young teams are the Mavericks, the Pelicans, the Celtics and the Sixers (kind of). I think OKC has a bright future as well.   The bad teams are the Kings, Suns, Wizards, Grizzlies, Bulls, Pistons, Hornets, Timberwolves, Hawks, Cavs. Some of these have young talent (Kings, Suns, Hawks) that might develop in the coming years.  The Spurs were bad this year, but they've been one of the most successful franchises in the past 20 years.  The Knicks have been terrible since the 90s, they're hopeless.  The Nets have two superstars who might do some damage next year.  The Rockets are my favorite team but they are a weird, weird team. I don't think they're going to win a championship in the near future, but they're fun to watch.  From what I hear, the Pacers are decent, they had a good player who got injured and we don't know if he's going to make a complete recovery.   If I were you, I'd choose the Mavericks: they have the youngest superstar in the NBA (Luka Doncic) and another good player in Porzingis. They're already decent and exciting to watch, and in a couple of years they might even be title contenders.  I wouldn't choose the Lakers because they're super old and they won't be good in 3-4 years."
"And in return we get TOO much. Kevin Durant wants to beat the piss out of the Oklahoma City Thunder because he’s a snake. “How about we do this,” he said as he followed Roberson to the bus. “Get in my face, go “now this is what you just said.’” Kevin hangs out at a Chicago Bulls game with Unrestricted Free Agent Nick Young. The two talk trash to each other and draw it out of Young into a fight."
"He didn't say that shit with the cameras off 🙄  Prepared for the downvotes, but harassing Kevin Durant for making objectively the best choice for his career aside from staying in Oklahoma is a tired joke. In a sport where organizations have no sense of loyalty and can trade players at will without significant criticism, it's borderline RACIST.  I like Hannibal, but this is just a weak move for internet favor. Let the man play some 2K."

"For reference, that ""one guy"" is Chris Haynes, you know, a reporter who's job is based on reliable information?

Or, sans all that, you could just infer that it's an award show where every word is scripted on a teleprompter and the monologue is literally the point of every award show where you laugh at yourself  or the fact that they put a big ass camera right in front of KD before he said it where he looks INTO the camera and his mom is laughing next to him. Or sans all THAT, you can recognize that KD is a human being who has the capacity to laugh at himself and not take everything like it's the fucking hunger games like you do? God having to explain what an award show joke is is exhausting  &amp;#x200B;  Yeah I don't know why you comment on here, you're incredibly dense. I hope to God you're not above the age of like 15 cause that'd be embarrassing if you're trying to act like a skit is real life. I know things are slow right now but you don't have to go looking for drama, you can get a netflix subscription instead of convincing yourself that everyone has to have a problem and be incredibly butthurt like you are right now. You're karen-ing out right now and i gotta say it's not a good look."

"I'm not a LeBron fan, even though his 51 or whatever was pretty impressive. But all the talk behind that game pissed me off, especially the whole week leading up to game 2.  Game 2 Klay go either unto foul trouble or he tweaked his ankle. Then Steph went off. Especially the Kevin Love Rainbow shot, and that one where JR tried to steal it, and Steph made him pay with that 3.  It was the game that solidified that the series was funna be over rather quickly. The Cav's kinda threw in the towel after that game. They knew the first game slipped away from them. Of course they fought hard in game 3 cuz they focused on Stopping Steph. Which then rehashed the Kevin Durant shot over LeBron. Didn't enjoy that game much cuz in the back of my mind, I knew the media will use that to take away Steph's Finals MVP chances. Game 4 was just a formality. It was already a done deal."

Where as Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo have bodies of a forward and skillset of guard.  KZ Okpala has a skillset of a forward and a body of a guard. He plays like Paul Millsap in G League but he has body of Brandon Ingram
"“The one ugly big breakup Westbrook seems to be remembered for is what happened with Kevin Durant, fans hang onto that more than anything. What needs to be remembered is what happened after that. Westbrook's teammates continuously say they love him, while Durant's former Warriors teammates seem to take jabs at him.”  Reads like it was written on BR in 2009 before they paid anyone. Wtf happened to SI"
"&gt; The only thing curry has done is allow players to take pull up 3s off the dribble and not immediately bench them, which I’m unsure is a top 15 lock.  I agree that he shouldn't be a top 15 lock just off of that, but:  a) saying all he did to the game was that is selling him short, although the game was already trending towards more threes, curry was the one that weaponized it in a way that that no one else before or after imo ever will, literally changing the way that both offenses and defenses worked their schemes. Sure you also have other dudes pulling up from 3 now, but no one has ever had the same level of volume along with efficiency, and Steph is in the conversation for being the best efficient volume-scorer of all time. IF you don't believe he changed the game, please rewatch some highlights of that 2015-16 season, because that was straight bullshit, like everyone knew he was gonna shoot, everyone prepared for him to shoot, and he still was splashing in front of anyone. Do you seriously believe that the nba uses the 3 pointer the same way without a jumpshooting team ever sustaining a high level of success in the playoffs (that was a narrative before the warriors) and a sharpshooter being the unanimous mvp?  b) I believe he is in the top 15 because although his peak has been shorter compared to others, there is an argument that his peak was the most valuable and gamebreaking offensive player in nba history and the best player on a championship team, which imo is deserving of at least top 20, probably top 15  &gt;Statistically he isn’t better than all the greats and his team is the only one to lose up 3-1 in a finals series.  define statistics? because out of the greats, iirc  a graph comparing efficiency and volume scoring and steph ranked right towards the top. what does his team being the only one to lose a 3-1 lead have to do with anything, did you forget that the same season they had the greatest regular season of all time.  &gt;Or just ‘changing the game’. Iverson averaged over 26 points for 9 years straight; curry has only averaged over 26 for 3 years of his career.  are you just gonna ignore efficiency, or the fact that curry was actually contributing to wins and team success?  &gt;And does Dwight Howard move up the list because he had a bunch of 3 point shooters around him (which is the way it’s played now, so basically changing the game)  what are you even talking about??? the way that the magic played isn't really similar to the way the modern nba is played, because they relied on a elite big man surrounded by shooters that could allow the elite big man to feast? what team in the modern nba is replicating this concept. most of the elite big man now can either create or initiate offense on their own. Dwight Howard also was not responsible for more 3 point shooting, that was his team. He literally had jackshit to do with the 3 point revolution, while currys 3 point shooting helped him become a 2 time nba mvp.  &gt;(which apart from pull up 3s, he hasn’t actually done. Antoine walker was taking 8 3’s a game in 2001)  on 34% from 3  &gt;moves him above someone like John Stockton, Kevin Durant and David Robinson.  John Stockton: No argument for being greater than curry, Peak should always be valued over longevity, and Steph's peak was the best player on the best regular season team ever. Stockton imo is a bit overrated because of counting stats over a long period of time, is it coincidence that his best years coincided with some of the weaker guard play in the league?  Kevin Durant: I probably agree that Curry is worse than Durant as a basketball player, but in terms of greatness on an all-time list, Curry &gt; Durant. When both their teams were on comparable levels in 2016, Curry outplayed Durant and had KD come to play for his team, which I think means somethings. Curry has more mvps, more rings, while Durants only claim is that he won the fmvps which imo he won because of the gravity and gameplanning needed for curry.  David Robinson: This is a really weird player to compare him with, cuz I never hear him in a large conversation about the top 15/20, but I would argue that his lack of team success and the fact that peak for peak, curry is greater, you rank him higher."
"How did he change how the game was played? The only thing curry has done is allow players to take pull up 3s off the dribble and not immediately bench them, which I’m unsure is a top 15 lock. 3 pointers were always moving in an upward trajectory and doesn’t make a significant jump when curry won his mvp. The 7 seconds or less suns, Dwight Howard Magic, 2013/2014 spurs are classic examples of teams abusing the 3 ball. The difference between them and the warriors is Curry wasn’t only catching and shooting.   Let’s put this into perspective, (if) Curry changes the game means really what? Statistically he isn’t better than all the greats and his team is the only one to lose up 3-1 in a finals series. So changing the game for better? Or just ‘changing the game’. Iverson averaged over 26 points for 9 years straight; curry has only averaged over 26 for 3 years of his career. So this changing on the game, what does it actually relate to? And does Dwight Howard move up the list because he had a bunch of 3 point shooters around him (which is the way it’s played now, so basically changing the game) ?   Sorry if this came across aggressive or in any negative light, just trying to understand how changing the game (which apart from pull up 3s, he hasn’t actually done. Antoine walker was taking 8 3’s a game in 2001) moves him above someone like John Stockton, Kevin Durant and David Robinson."
&gt;Harden is the best scorer since Jordan   I guess Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant don't exist in OPs world
"I'd argue that Steph has more value on a Durant team than Wade does. Remember, we're starting KD and benching the other player.  Wade was the right guard for his era, as a slashing 2-guard without a serious 3-point shot. But his game would not age perfectly as a costar past 2016-17 or so. Spacing is incredibly valuable, and Wade did not have range. In his Heatles run, he had the benefit of being surrounded by a roster with LeBron on his best shooting years, Chris Bosh, and Ray Allen. If he isn't guaranteed teammates like these, he and KD could certainly out-talent other teams like Westbrook and KD did, but it's not the same thing as having a good offensive fit. A Wade + bench lineup without KD might look more like Giannis vs the Raptors, where the star gets swarmed in the paint and the role-players can't make plays.  Steph, on the other hand, is a very modern offensive player in that he can shoot from anywhere, off the dribble if necessary. Moreover, he's not as ball-dominant, but can consistently put up 25+ PPG while sharing the court with a 25+ PPG scorer such as, say, Kevin Durant, and maybe even another 20 PPG scorer on top of that. Steph's skills scales much better in a star-studded team, while Wade's contributions (defense, slashing/playmaking) are significantly more contextual, since they require the majority of his teammates to provide defense and spacing. Individual perimeter defense doesn't mean squat if the offense can easily get a match with a much worse player. And when surrounded by ideal teammates, Curry can be the engine of a 73-win team, whereas Wade peaked at 66, while playing second fiddle to LeBron James.  Plus, Steph has some pretty good bench celebrations."

"I feel that's kinda double-edged. It's like when you start a business with your buddies. At first it's super cool, and chill, because they're your friends and you're all in this together.  Then, your 8AM meetings start at 11AM because everyone goofs around too much. No progress is made, money isn't coming in. You start seeing the flaws in your friends, and you decide maybe you never should have started a business with them.  I'm not saying this kind of divisive rift will happen between Karl and D'Angelo, but there's a chance it could. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were seemingly inseperable for a while, and then Durant just bounced out.   To ensure something like this doesn't happen, I think Karl Anthony-Towns and D'Angelo Russell need a third, 'bigger' piece to keep the two of them rooted. If it's all about KAT and D-Lo, and the two don't start seeing eye to eye, it might hurt the Timberwolves because there's no third option to defer to, or calm the storm."

I would say difficulty is insanely important. If its not then Kevin Durant might be the best Final's performer of all time.
"They were.  But at the same time, no one was saying Oden was 1B.  The Draft Combine really solidified a lot of people's opinions on the matter.  For example:  &gt;Only one player was unable to bench press 185 even once - Kevin Durant.  &gt;Oden is faster than Durant in the 3/4-court sprint, quicker in the lane-agility drill, and has better numbers in the running and standing vertical leaps. And, Oden has a mind-boggling 7.8 body-fat percentage ... most big men are north of the 12 percent range.  &gt;His wingspan is 7 feet, 4.25 inches (fourth best in the draft). His standing reach is 9 feet, 4 inches (the highest of anyone in the draft). His standing vertical is 32 inches, his running vertical 34 inches.  &gt;The lane agility drill, where a player runs through cones alternating between running backward, sideways and forward, is 11.67 seconds. And his 3/4 court sprint was 3.27 seconds.  &gt;The thing that jumps out is Oden's speed and agility.  &gt;We all know Oregon's Aaron Brooks is fast. Brooks finished the 3/4 court sprint in 3.2 seconds. Oden was 3.27 seconds. Durant, meanwhile, finished in 3.45."
"yo just as a tip btw for the next time you do long writeups (which I appreciate cuz its nice to have proper discussion on this sub) please format cuz I think I just got eye injuries from reading all of that in one paragraph.  I feel like we still haven't see all that durant can do (which is sad because the level of play that I always though he could reach is probably no longer attainable cuz of the achilles). The one year where he had to go full on carry mode in 2014 he won mvp with a usg of 33 (which harden has topped 4 times i think) and I would love to see that version of Kevin Durant again. I'd also like to see KD shoot more of the 3 pointer cuz he shoots at nearly 40% yet only shoots 5 a game which is less than half of the amount of 3s that harden takes.  You made a very good point there about the shot selection cuz thats always whats frustrated me about him. He definitely has the ability to get to his spots the same way that kawhi or curry can but he chooses not to by instead dribbling down the shot clock for 20 seconds that throwing up a terrible 3 which is so frustrating. I definitely think that shot selection alone has lost him more than one ring. Like in 2018 against the warriors, theres no way one of the best scorers of all time should let his team go down like that in game 7. Get to the rim, pull up in the midrange, do something to change the momentum."
Yes expect it within five years of their retirements. Also having a number retired doesn’t really do anything. People saying KD got to repair a relationship or come back to play for the Thunder together his jersey retired are weird. Kevin Durant is the best Thunder player of all time. I personally don’t think it’s going to be a big deal because for jersey retirements it’s usually before a game or at halftime.

"I'm going to make a small list of points for your brain to understand   1. Curry already proved in 3 years of college that he is a superstar and an all time great shooter despite whoever happens to be playing around him.  The fact that you say it has been ""proven"" that currys gravity is nothing without a great team tells me all I need to know about the who I'm waiting my time responding to.  No player ever does it alone except for maybe Lebron.  2.  Durant did not help curry, he helped the warriors.  Curry however really helped durant perform in the playoffs, it's right there in the statistics you can read them if you want or you can keep being annoying and uninformed.    3.  Saying that every player has gravity is like me saying J.R. smith is good at basketball... well yeah he was a professional but when you compare him to lebron james he starts to look like a child playing against adults.  This point you made is so infantile that I want the time back in my life that it took to respond to it.  4.  No shit the brilliance of one player is not enough to create a juggernaut.  Hell KD couldnt even get it done with westbrook, Harden, and Ibaka all on the same team. That's what made lebrons 2018 run so special, but then he got beat in 4 straight by an actual juggernaut... what was your point there?  Congratulations you refuted a point that nobody ever made.  5.  You know the nba is a business right?  You know that they still have to sell tickets and merchandise and attract viewers? So why the hell would curry say ""it's ok folks this is a lost season just tune in next year"".  They replaced kevin durant with deangelo fucking russell, and replaced klay thompson with... nobody, how about Iguodala???  The fact that you bought into this is laughable.  I bet you also bought it when Tristan Thompson said the East still runs through the Cavs.  They were always going to try to make the most of a lost season by getting as high of a draft pick as possible.  Or did you also believe them when they said deangelo russell was going to be a part of their future despite being a god awful fit.  I bet you also believe Wiggins is a part of their future aswell.  I you have a brain, you should probably start using it."
"He has five of the top seven playoff runs for points per 100 possessions among all centers, including the top two. Among all players only Michael Jordan (6), LeBron James (1) and Kevin Durant (1) have had better playoff runs.  For the regular season it’s eight of the top eleven including the top two."
"Kevin Durant was getting open dunks because the defense was so focused on Steph and Klay. If that counts as ""outplaying"" LeBron because he won, then by all means."
Kevin Durant: “I’m coming home”
&gt;Why do people give LeBron James a pass for stacking the deck in his favor but not Kevin Durant? https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g6ugxa/why_do_people_give_lebron_james_a_pass_for/  Why don't you tell us OP?
"Kevin Durant+Steph Curry are two top 15-20 players ALL TIME.   Then there’s Draymond and Klay which are not only All Stars but All NBA guys too.  Yea Kyrie and Lebron should have just scored more, lol"
"You deleted your comment mocking the injury of Kevin Durant. You're lucky I didn't screenshot it, loser."
"Didn't the players also elect him as a VP of the NBAPA a few months ago?   Guys did want to play with him - namely Kevin Durant but also DeAndre Jordan and Garrett Temple.  If rumors are the be believed, there are a few other guys who he and Durant have recruited to join them next season.  And I'm not even defending him because he's a Net. He hasn't even played enough yet for it to really feel like he's a Net.   I'm not necessarily defending him at all. Just pointing out that there is evidence of him not being this miserable personality who people in the league dislike."
 MVP| Year| Seed ---|----|---- Kevin Durant| 2014| 2nd LeBron James| 2013| 1st LeBron James| 2012| 2nd Derick Rose| 2011| 1st LeBron James| 2010| 1st LeBron James| 2009| 1st Kobe Bryant| 2008| 1st Dirk Nowitzki| 2007| 1st Steve Nash| 2006| 2nd Steve Nash| 2005| 1st Kevin Garnett| 2004| 1st Tim Duncan| 2003| 1st Tim Duncan| 2002| 2nd Allen Iverson| 2001| 1st Shaquille O'neal| 2000| 1st Karl Malone| 1999| 3rd (Tied for 1st best record though) Michael Jordan| 1998| 1st Karl Malone| 1997| 1st Michael Jordan| 1996| 1st David Robinson| 1995| 1st Hakeem Olajuwon| 1994| 2nd Charles Barkley| 1993| 1st Michael Jordan| 1992| 1st Michael Jordan| 1991| 1st Magic Johnson| 1990| 1st Magic Johnson| 1989| 1st Michael Jordan| 1988| 3rd Magic Johnson| 1987| 1st Larry Bird| 1986| 1st Larry Bird| 1985| 1st
"No.   Kevin Durant is better than Rose, and he isn’t even considered a top 10."
It is but there is a narrative that Wade was injured in the 2014 Finals. Dude was old going on his 4th straight trip to the Finals. Wear and tear becomes an issue for everyone that deep in the playoffs. Klay Thompson had an injury in the Finals. Kevin Durant had an injury in the Finals. Wade did not.
"Prime Kevin Durant what on 2015 Thunder though.   Durant has Tracy McGrady on superior defense outside shooting and post play. Tracy McGrady has insane quickness great hops mid range and the ability to attack  If TMAC cannot find a way to slow down Kevin, Kevin wins. If TMAC gets hot, TMAC wins"
"I used to be a Thon Maker stan, always thought he'd be what Kevin Durant is now. Turns out, any 7'0 freak of nature looks like Kevin Durant playing against kids in midde school."
Kevin Durant having his entire body basically laying out of bounds and it not getting called is the worst in history. Especially because it REALLY mattered.
The Moj Criteria of being a superstar:  Be able to lead a team to a conference championship without another Superstar **OR:** Win an MVP   SUPERSTARs: (not ranked in order of who’s better)  -LeBron James  -Steph Curry  -Kevin Durant  -Giannis Antetokounmpo   -James Harden  -Kawhi Leonard  -Russell Westbrook  -Damian Lillard  -Paul George
"Lawrence Frank at 5 is pretty surprising.   Like we know that Kawhi was seriously considering the Clippers already, and they traded a high-level young player and a billion first-round picks for Paul George.  It's not like it necessarily took masterful talent evaluation and negotiation skills.  EDIT: Not saying he should be top 5, and not saying it because he's the top exec of my favorite team, but look at what Sean Marks did. Took over a franchise that was in arguably the worst situation in the history of professional sports. People were saying they wouldn't be close to competing for the playoffs for at least a decade.   He ends up putting together a pretty nice younger squad consisting of D'Angelo Russell, Caris LeVert, Jarrett Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie, and Joe Harris. The latter two were G-Leaguers who were no-names before the Nets and ended up becoming very solid rotation pieces with the team - guys who could play 25+ mpg on any team in the league. LeVert and Allen were bottom half first-round picks. Russell was seen as a disappointment, but Marks took the chance and traded for him. He transformed the Nets from the biggest laughingstock in sports to a franchise that people actually started to respect and take seriously, a franchise that players wanted to play for. This of course all culminated in the signings of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving - just 3 years after Marks took over he turned the Nets from a dumpster fire joke into a franchise that Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to play for."
Man I just wanna live in a timeline that Kevin Durant doesn’t go to the Warriors
"In this series Kevin Durant averaged 30.0 PPG, 8.0 RPG and 2.9 APG. In Game 7 he put up 27 Points on over 50% shooting from the field and over 40% from 3. Sad how Westbrook probably cost him a title that year"
"If we look at the leaderboard of True Shooting in NBA history, Durant Ranks 12th, however there are a handful of lob-catching and at-the-rim finishing role players in that mix, so let's narrow that down to people who averaged more than 10 FGA per game over their careers. That puts Durant 6th:  1. Stephen Curry (.623 TS) 2. Artis Gilmore (.623 TS) 3. Karl-Anthony Towns (.622 TS) 4. Adrian Dantley (.617 TS) 5. Reggie Miller (.614 TS) 6. Kevin Durant (.613 TS)  If we adjust that for what we as modern fans consider great shooters and make the requirement to attempt a minimum of 3+ 3PA per game over their career (picked a number that would keep typical 'great shooter' favourites in contention), and allow some players with under 10 FGA to accommodate for exceptional role players, KD slides up to 4th place.  The top 10 looks like this:  1. Stephen Curry (.623 TS) 2. Karl-Anthony Towns (.622 TS) 3. Reggie Miller (.614 TS) 4. Kevin Durant (.613 TS) 5. James Harden (.610 TS) 6. Brent Barry (.607 TS) \[*6.9 FGA*\] 7. Steve Nash (.605 TS) 8. JJ Redick (.602 TS) \[*9.7 FGA*\] 9. Kyle Korver (.602 TS) \[*7.6 FGA*\] 10. Kawhi Leonard (.597 TS)  There are obviously more factors to being a 'great shooter' than just stats though, so this isn't a conversation-ending or final list by any means. What other qualities make a shooter great to you?"
"Among the 140 players all-time with 15,000+ points, KD ranks 5th in TS%.   It's Artis Gilmore (.643), Stephen Curry (.623), Adrian Dantley (.617), Reggie Miller (.614), and Kevin Durant (.613).   If you up it to 20,000+ points, KD is third behind Dantley and Miller.   Once KD (most likely) gets to 25,000 points, only Miller will be in front of him if KD is able to keep around the same efficiency.  On a side note, it's crazy how Adrian Dantley has 23,177 career points and a .617 career TS%, yet isn't really talked about at all."
"Kevin ""the Snake"" Durant"
"Yeah, I guess you can look at it that way. Being hated is just as good as being liked or ehatever. In that same sense, going to golden State was a good PR move for Kevin Durant, which I could agree with.   I'll say that LeBron never seemed to me like the guy who wanted to be the villain. And I don't think he understood the level of backlash he would receive around the world.   Personally, I'll say the anger and vitriol he received in 2010 was not what he wanted or expected, so it's fair to call it a mistake or bad PR move."
"It's hard to make a list like this because a lot of the all time great shooters don't shoot a ton of midrange (ex: Curry, Klay, Korver, etc). They have the ability to, they just don't shoot them. For guys that do, I'd go with Ray Allen, Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Reggie Miller, Richard Hamilton, Larry Bird, Dirk Nowitzki, and Chris Paul in no particular order."
Except for those who are Kevin Durant alts
"Does that really make him a punk? I mean, even if he was participating if physical activities, that doesn’t mean he was in game shape/form. Wasn’t Kevin Durant ready to play again when he tore his Achilles?"
Yeah and that dude named Kevin Durant was just there too I guess
"Problem with Kevin Durant is that he took the ""hardest road"", so all the shitting on him will always be ""justified"".  Not saying that it's right, but that's how it is."
Kevin Durant isn’t that “bad” offensively either
"This videos great, but that announcer always annoys the shit out of me. Figure out something else to say dude.  Everyone gets it: Kevin Durant is in the building, and he is the best."
I. am. Kevin. Durant.
"It has to be said that, even though JR got the rebound he would have to attempt a shot against 7 ft tall Kevin Durant guarding him, so that was in no way a guarantee that the Cavs win.  If you watch the play, as soon as JR gets the board, KD is ready to contest the layup and Draymond Green is behind JR, so there's a pretty big chance he doesn't make that one.  George Hill missing the free throw and LeBron passing up a jumper against 6-3 Steph Curry were the defining moments of the game."
Yea we should feel bad warriors had to earn a ring with their 3 all nba players instead of having a guaranteed ring with Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant agreed with it all and got a pass from fans lmaoooooo
kevin durant burner rapper account uncovered!
"&gt; Players are being evaluated relative to their performance for *this season only*. Benefit of the doubt is awarded to stars with limited appearances, but only if they've delivered at a high level during their time on the floor or seem likely to pick up steam in Disney World or during the potential Chicago bubble.   &gt;   &gt;Anyone who hasn't logged at least 500 minutes is not eligible for inclusion. This makes for some tough cuts—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Klay Thompson, etc.—but this is, in essence, a 2019-20 retrospective. Sample size has to matter.  Are you illiterate?"
If you can’t beat them join them! -	Kevin Durant
"Let me catch you to speed on the landscape: - OKC had 3 pre-MVP winners on one team - Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. - Kevin Durant left OKC to go to the Warriors, the year after the broke the bulls regular season record, with 70 wins. - the Warriors have the two best shooters of all time still: Steph Curry and Klay Thompson - Lebron couldn't quite win a championship with Cleveland. He then went to Miami (look up ""the decision"") and won 2 of 4 years with dwade. - Lebron went back to Cleveland and carried his team on his back to the finals every year, even after Kyrie left (there was a great SNL sketch at the about the other Caviliers). But they still won 1 with Kyrie. - Kyrie is uncle Drew - Kyrie and Kevin Durant are now with the nets, validating the other New York team, and they are known as the whiniesy players in the NBA. - the Knicks owner is a joke. - the Toronto Raptors traded a star player (sorta) for one year with Kawaii Leonard, and they won last year. - Kawaii and Paul George are now on a super team LA Clippers. - LA now has two super teams, now the Lakers have Lebron and Anthony Davis - the last two years have been the greatest draft years ever - two years ago Luka and Trae Young were drafted 6 &amp; 7 and model their games to be the next Lebron and Steph - this year we got Zion and Ja Morant. Zion needs no introduction, but Ja Morant was an awesome surprise who is athletic, drops dime passes, and has Russell Westbrook energy - Portland Trailblazers have Damian Lillard and CJ, who are great, but will never ever make the finals it seems - the Greek Freek is Giannis, and he IS the bucks (they have good role players) - San Antonio dynasty is over - Boston and Miami have great young teams that will be great if kept together - Philly could be great... But see Portland - DC sucks but John Wall has been out two years and Bradley Beal turned into Allen Iverson suddenly - Houston Rockets didn't work with James Harden and Chris Paul. People thought Paul was washed up and he went to OKC (after Russ and PG left) and they've been winning a bunch, reminding us he's one of the best point guards ever - now Rockets have Harden and Westbrook, which was awkward at first cuz they made Russ shoot 3s, and he can't... Then they got rid of their center to open the floor (small ball 2.0) and they clicked. - the rockets coach, Mike Diantoni will likely get fired if they yet again don't win/make finals, for his unconventional ways, but it's statically the best offensive style. - Denver Nuggets have an amazing center who stays far for no reason  Did I miss anything?"
Kevin Durant made the weakest free agency move in the history of sports and both of his championships are meaningless
The *truth* you’re looking for is that Kevin Durant is either A) blindly promoting that piece literal human shit F*******n because he feels like that is what he’s supposed to do. Or B) actually agrees with what he is preaching. That either makes KD complicit in promoting anti-LGBTQ and anti-Semitic conspiracies or that he agrees with them.
"I wasn’t really complaining, but yeah he’d pretty much be a bigger Durant. Kevin Durant already is one of the best and hardest to guard, so adding in the extra size would pretty much be unstoppable."
"You just explained the lie that is Russia-gate, Ukraine-gate, Benghazi and ""Obama is a secret Kenyan Muslim"".  All 4 were hoaxes, massive, outright lies and mass delusions.    People didn't know the facts because they didn't want to know the facts.  People believed it because they so desperately WANTED to believe it.    People don't CARE about the facts surrounding whether Kevin Durant liked  Hitler quote or not.  People WANT TO BELIEVE KD did, the facts don't matter."
"&gt; I don’t think people are concerned with KD liking Hitler  Bro, the top on the sub this week that got 50k upvotes literally says [""Somehow DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, **Kevin Durant** and JR Smith **praising Hitler** is getting less coverage than Drew Brees' comments""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hnir15/somehow_desean_jackson_stephen_jackson_kevin/)    People legitimately believe KD is pro Hitler."
"It's not hair splitting though.  If someone likes a Kevin Durant tweet right now, would it be correct to start making posts saying ""______ praises Farrakhan"" because KD did?  Words have meanings.  Language doesn't have some weird transitive rule you get to apply for horrible people/beliefs."
"I messaged the mods asking them to add a mod statement &amp; reported the 46k upvote post titled ""... and Kevin Durant praising Hitler""   No response"
"That was sarcasm. Obviously Paul George isn't Kevin Durant. He was an MVP caliber player that year, though. It's not ridiculous to compare two teams that would have both had 3/5 of the same starters, an MVP caliber player and a stretch 4. Not a crazy comparison. 2018 obviously wouldn't have been better than 2016 or been one win away from the finals but I think we would have at least beat the Jazz. But there's no way to prove a hypothetical so these types of conversations never really go anywhere."
"&gt; No, it’s really simple.  Support for Louis Farrakhan tends to be.  &gt; Kevin Durant liking an Instagram post isn’t the same as what Stephen Jackson did.  It certainly isn't. He stopped short of quoting him on his story, and tripling down on his viewpoints when asked. Wait, is that really the line you've set, that as long as Kevin doesn't quote him into an open mic, that he must not support him?   &gt; You turned it into an argument where you’ve lied and contradicted yourself a million times, and have hidden behind “I need proof that Hayward donated to trump” in order to defend your inconsistency.  It's kind of impressive how you got every single point in this entire part wrong. Nowhere have I lied, contradicted myself, nor have I asked for ""proof"" that Hayward donated to Trump. I may want to verify the veracity of such a claim now, though, given how bitchy you've gotten over that one point.  &gt; Based on the fact you’ve defended the Redskins team name, I highly doubt you care if players support trump.  I haven't defended the Redskins name, either, and think it should change. All your bitching about that shows that really need to work on your literacy, because you're just embarrassing yourself at this point.  &gt; You are a hypocrite, that’s all there is to say. This thread was specially about comparing Kevin Durant to Stephen Jackson. That is why I commented on that matter.  &gt; I have not drifted from the point of the thread,  That's a lie, though. You've done everything you can to turn a thread about rhetoric from Kevin and Stephen over to some unrelated grievance against Trump.  I honestly don't know of any other reason why you'd be this persistent about it (past answering your dumb ""question"" twice over) other than palpable indignance over Farrakhan's hatred being the point of contention, given it took about an hour for you to quickly and quietly concede that he's not a good person. Why does it visibly offend you that others are talking shit about him so openly?"
"&gt; Never in my comment history have I supported Farrakhan.  Of course you don't support him, you're just spending an entire thread trying to steer discussion away from how awful he is, and bitching out anyone who keeps going. As long as you don't word it exactly as ""I support Louis Farrakhan"", it must not count.  &gt; Second of all, you have never commented your anger at Gordon Hayward, or demanded he explain his donations to Donald trumps campaign.  Because I've politely asked for further detail on his donation, and you've offered little other than that it was apparently made by his wife. You keep tripping over your selective literacy, bud.  &gt; Noting that Kevin Durant liking an Instagram post is a situation where he deserves to explain himself is not an endorsement of Farrakhan.  It certainly isn't, and I haven't noted that as a reason why you support him.  &gt; I don’t know how you could possibly be dense enough to not see this, but it’s clear you are only trying to label me not for things I have actually said or done, but minimize the argument down to nothing in order to feel like you’re right.  So it's okay when you do the exact same thing, got it.  &gt; Kevin Durant didn’t need to immediately respond to this, just like no one has ever asked Gordon Hayward why he donated to trump.  No one said he immediately needed to respond to this, either. Once again, swinging with all your might at a point no one actually made.  &gt; You are pretending one thing is far worse than the other, but it’s the wrong one.  So... it's worse when individual Reddit users support Trump than if a leading basketball star endorses the word of someone who thinks I should be executed per his scripture? I wonder what kind of mental gymnastics it takes to make that leap.  &gt; Because this entire thing is in bad faith.  You're right that this thread has been in bad faith, but it's been as a product of your umbrage over others talking shit about Louis Farrakhan and the resultant shitting up of the topic. No other theory has emerged as to why your first response to Farrakhan's hate is purely ""B-b-but what about Trump?"""
"It isn’t just that. Kevin Durant likes the post. Guys like Malcolm Jenkins in the NFL said “Jews aren’t our problem”, Shannon Sharpe continued to double down that Deseans remarks weren’t that bad. I mean, there’s being silent, but the silence combined with multiple athletes and former athletes coming out to support the message is the problem. It makes them look complicit, at least in my eyes, maybe that’s not fair, I’m sure that’s not everyone’s view. But it gave a very scary vibe that what desean and Stephen Jackson talked about is a common sentiment amongst the players, and have lost a lot of respect for them for it."
"There's good suggestions about 2k and how to watch the games.  Only other thing I can suggest is looking up player highlights on YouTube.   Id say start with the current superstars like LeBron James,  Steph Curry, Kevin Durant. A good way to get some ideas on who to watch could be to look up the most recent All Star teams.   After that if you're interested dip into retired players and you can see how the game has changed. Kobe, Shaq, Tim Duncan, and Dirk are some very good recent retired players worth watching. Then if you are still interested you can always go even further back and watch the legends like Michael Jordan.   Another thing to keep in mind is some recent NBA history. The recent cliff notes version includes stuff like: Golden State Warriors last 5 years Lebrons 8 straight finals appearances OKC Thunders big 3 and where they are now Miami Heat when they had lebron wade and bosh San Antonio Spurs amazing dynasty   Last bit of advice if you're looking for good all time players, you can look up stat leaders for points, assists and rebounds etc.  I would say you should support the Cleveland Cavaliers but we're in a bit of a rut since lebron left (for the 2nd time) but you should definitely include the 2016 championship into your research. Feel free to reach out"
"Ummm...did you forget that you had Kevin ""You Know Who I Am"" Durant on that team? That does a lot to effect the structure of the team to be one win away from the finals."
"On the other hand, you have the built in excuse of 'dude it's Kevin fucking Durant'.  If you give him any trouble it looks good on you."
"Doesn’t everyone say KD is taller than 6’10. Like if you look at him &amp; Demarcus Cousins in the same frame, he’s pretty much the same height.  https://www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/2017/6/12/15773612/how-tall-kevin-durant-height-warriors   I know this an article talking about how he’s taller than 6’9 but there is comparisons of him to 6’11 guys &amp; with shoes on he’s definitely up there in height."
"Kobe quote on defending KD:  &gt; &gt; Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; When he first came into the league, he was easy to defend because he couldn’t go right and shoot. He used to kind of shoot across his face, so that was a weakness that he had. Also in the post, he couldn’t turn left shoulder, everything was right shoulder, so that gave me areas that I could shut off. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Then he started developing it. And now he can pull up left, he can pull up right, he can shoot the long ball, he has runners, left hand, right hand. Before he had a left hand finish at the rim, I could always send him left, force him all the way to the basket. Even with the advantage of his size, he was still uncomfortable finishing with his left. So I could clamp the right hand and force him in a tough situation. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; But now he developed that. So then I couldn’t really figure out, is this a rhythm thing? I’m trying to count the seconds that he takes to make his move. When does he make them, at what times in the game? I couldn’t really figure out that rhythm. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; So I retired not being able to figure him out."
"It’s impossible to know with these hypotheticals so I just went with solely replacing Curry and Harden and keeping everything else the same.   And it’s Kevin Durant we are talking about, if he’d join Golden State after they beat him, he’d definitely go there if he beat them."
"&gt; I think people are underrating the possibility that a lot of people don’t care that much about Stephen Jackson’s opinion.  He’s no longer in the league and outside of his podcast has recently only been relevant because of his proximity to George Floyd  I think you're underestimating the influence that his podcast has among NBA players.  Just since December, he's had Dwayne Wade, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Demarcus Cousins, Chris Paul, Trae Young, Draymond Green, Steve Nash, Jayson Tatum, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Bradley Beal and more on his show.  Many of them came in person and most stayed more than an hour.    Jackson and Barnes might not be household names among casual fans, but they're clearly inner circle NBA guys.

Kevin Durant has a short neck. He’s really like the frame of a 7 footer with the neck of a toddler.
Imagine having to guard Kevin Durant.
Imagine going from guarding extremely incomplete college players to having to guard Kevin Durant
"I'm seeing some people claim that Curry doesn't get spoon-fed the same wide-open looks that Bertans and Robinson get. False. Not only does **Curry attempt the most wide-open threes BY FAR**, but also **Curry shoots worse than 40% from three unless he's wide open.**  For the past four seasons, Curry has shot 48% on wide-open threes (no defender within 6 feet), which account for 44% of all threes he's made. Otherwise he shoots 38% from 3 (only 34% if a defender is within 4 feet of him).  Compared with Curry, Bertans and Duncan Robinson both make roughly the same percentage of wide-open threes (48% and 46%), but those account for only 11% and 13% of all the threes they attempt. When they're not wide open, Bertans and Robinson still shoot &gt;40% from 3 (Bertans = 40.3%; Robinson 43.3%).  The biggest difference is when a defender is within 4 feet of the shooter. Curry makes only 34% of those, while Robinson and Bertans still make 40%.  tl;dr Robinson's and Bertans's 3pt% are not inflated by wide-open looks, but perhaps Curry's 3pt% is.  &amp;#x200B;  IMPORTANT CAVEATS:  * height. Robinson and Bertans are much taller than Curry, so it makes sense that they shoot better with defenders near them. * Curry's decline. When Kevin Durant was still in Oklahoma, Curry was a much better shooter. From 2013-14 to 2015-16, Curry made 43% of threes when a defender was within 6 feet. (If Curry makes &gt;40% of non-wide-open threes next season, I'll attribute his current ""slump"" to the presence of KD, not to aging.) * Dribbling. Bertans and Robinson almost never shoot a three after taking a dribble. Their 3pt% after a dribble is still good (&gt;40%), but the sample size is too small to make conclusions. Conversely, Curry loves to dribble before he shoots to get into his rhythm ([even his FTAs could be considered off the dribble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9chSovkDkA&amp;t=25s)), so even his wide-open attempts often occur after a bounce or two. * Timeframe. I compared Curry's last three full seasons to just 2019-2020 for the other two. But the numbers are the same if I use only Curry's 2018-2019 season, except for his amazing 53% on wide-open threes. In that case, Curry is better when he's wide open, and only when he's wide open.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  For whom it may interest: Duncan Robinson is actually BETTER when a defender is 4-6 feet away (47.9%) than when a defender is 6+ feet away (45.9%) -- perhaps an anomaly, perhaps because of the Heat's DHO system (versus catch-and-shoot), or perhaps truth that some people can in fact be ""too open."""
Can’t say that for certain among all nba players although definitely not a fan of Kevin Durant anymore

I don't even know what he said. Anyway he wasn't alone. Kevin Durant liked a Farrakhan's post on Instagram. Patrick Beverley and other NBA players follow him on Twitter.
"No I just think some of you are incredibly naive.  Race concerns almost every issue in life. Some people realize this, some don’t.  People have long treated athletes, particularly black athletes, as just figures that they root for, that they can treat however they seem fit because they only exist in their minds as sports players who make them happy and angry.  I absolutely think race played a factor in why Lebron’s first game in Cleveland and KD’s first game in okc following their moves were met with the vitriol they were.  It doesn’t mean that someone saying “I didn’t like that Kevin Durant signed with golden state, they are too stacked now” is racist.   It means that when it comes to some people, who took it 100 times too far, race probably was a factor whether they think so or not."
"I’m fine with keeping the schools out of paying them, and keeping it as is with scholarships....the thing I have a huge issue with is not allowing the kids to make money off their “brand”....let em earn....people always say, the kentuckys, kansases, dukes of the world will have an added benefit because of their boosters, I’d say, that lots of schools have donors with deep pockets and the kids should be able to make money off them  and I’m a Kansas alum  Honestly, I hate the NCAA and the product that CBB has become, so I’d love to see it all burn and let the kids earn that can earn, and the rest of em go to school if they want  There is no reason that Kevin Durant should have ever stepped foot on a college court, even though some of the KU/UT matchups were some of my favorites while I was at school"
"Basketball was surely part of the decision, he would not have gone to the Clippers if they did not pick up Paul George or if the Clippers were a &lt;30 win team last year.  Why was staying in Toronto another guaranteed ring? Toronto did not run over teams during the regular season or during their title run. Kevin Durant going to Golden State was a guaranteed ring. Kawhi staying in Toronto was not seen as a guaranteed ring at the time."
Fucking KEVIN DURANT ‘liked’ the tweets. Why the fuck is this not being talked about???????
"It is disheartening to realize that Kevin Durant (one of the top players in the league), JR Smith, Jameis Winston, Shannon Sharpe, and others are like my racist family members who like or post Islamophobic and racist memes and shit over social media.  Shannon Sharpe &amp; Stephen Jackson even nailed the offended defensive behavior and looked to shift blame when their views were questioned.  I can only hope in the future someone as powerful and influential as these athletes can realize just how wrong they are just like I hope my family realizes just how fucked up the things they believe are."

"Russell Westbrook. Nobody that inefficient should ever shoot that much, particularly when you've had Kevin Durant and James Harden for teammates. That makes it doubly offensive.  We gave Iverson shit for shooting so much, so inefficiently, and he actually had little to pass to."
What is your reason? Because Kevin Durant liked an Instagram post?
"No. His gravity continues to be understated if anything.  The fact that he’s shooting wide open shots speaks to how he chooses his shots. He does more work and demands more coverage off-ball than probably any other player in league history.  It’s not the same as closely defending a face up iso player, or doubling someone with the ball. That’s KD’s game. When he gets the ball, he’s typically iso-ing and facing someone up.  The other team sending two players to chase Curry and front him precludes the need to do the same thing to Kevin Durant. KD can get to his spots all day and pick up the rock there, and shoot easily over his defender, because you can’t really defend KD one on one in his spots."

Kevin Durant
"The NBA players reaction doesn't surprise me one bit.  Jewish people  just do not run in their circles for the most part.  This is a similar reaction to when they didn't speak up for Hong Kong.  These situations don't affect these ayers personally so they don't care.  They are activists when it matters to them only.  But Kevin Durant, should seriously shut the fuck up.  Never seen a superstar put his foot in his mouth as much as this guy."
"So Kevin Durant liking an Instagram post, when he hasn’t been asked to explain himself and he unliked it, is the crux of your anger?"
"Someone asking Kevin Durant about the Instagram like, and him then responding is more than fair.  That hasn’t happened yet though. Neither have any other players been asked about it yet"
I'm not making any assumptions about the players I am asking why Kevin Durant endorsed a comment supporting Farrakhan in light of what Stephen Jackson just said in regards to clearly antisemitic remarks.  And there SHOULD be condemnation about antisemitic remarks when we are in the middle of a major social justice movement that almost all nba players are active in.  What we only going to ask the nba community to speak out on racism against black people?  Justice is justice and Jackson is wrong and promoting unjust and out right lies with his comments.   You have freedom to say what you want and I have freedom to openly discuss what you said.  How is this so complicated for you?
"Kevin Durant did not line the hitler quote photo.  I would like you to find where I said this story shouldn’t be discussed.  I never said that.  I said that making assumptions about the players, and grouping them together and blaming them for not speaking out, when there are plenty of instances where you don’t give a damn when they speak out, is ridiculous.   None of you have any of the facts right, none of you actually even know what you’re arguing. You all just want to tell the players they are wrong, even though not a single active player has spoken inappropriately on this subject."
Kevin Durant didn't like the anti-semitic post everyone's (rightfully) complaining about
"Stephen Jackson is an nba media member, and former player.  Shannon is a media figure who covers basketball more than almost anything else and Shannon is responding here to what Stephen Jackson was saying and Kevin Durant endorsed with a like.  r/nba is about the nba community not just active players.  We discuss everything in the orbit of the nba.  Seems like you disagree that we should discuss anything but what active current nba players are doing on the court?"
"KEVIN DURANT LIKED DESEAN JACKSONS POST.   Let me get this through with everyone.   The 2nd, arguably, best player in the NBA. Former MVP. Two time champion.   He literally just said, by liking that post, ""Fuck the jews"".   AND THIS ISNT A FUCKING FIRESTORM.   Could you fucking imagine if Dirk or Luka said ""Fucking USA is shit. Fat-ass dumb fuck americans won't wear a mask. USA is fucking shit compared to Europe"".   That shit would be on fucking every news station 24/7.   AND THATS NOT WORSE than what KD did.   fuck this stupid shit."
"I may be wrong but his thinking could be that Stephen Jackson is no longer in the league so as the commissioner does he want to respond to everything a former player has said. Or maybe he's just hoping for a player to take the lead on this since they're the ones going on Jackson's podcast and interacting with him on social media, which raises another question: why hasn't the media asked Kevin Durant why he liked the post?"
"&gt; He didn’t do that, but good job being so passionate but something that you don’t know the facts of  Um,[ yes he did](https://thesportsrush.com/nba-news-kevin-durant-and-jr-smith-hitler-nets-star-liked-anti-semite-instagram-post-jr-smith-and-kd-praised-hitler-too/)"
"Has Kevin Durant been asked about an Instagram like? No? Then I’m not condemning him for an Instagram like.   And again, I ask you for the third time, if you are this angry players haven’t called out antisemitism, why aren’t you angry mlb players haven’t called out curt schilling’s racism?   Why are you living in this double standard?  You didn’t comment a thing in this sub a month ago when the protesting and police brutality was in the limelight. Is it because you don’t care about that cause and don’t think it’s worth fighting for?  You have spent a ton of energy here - not on attempting to educate those on the issue, or condemning the comments made by the individual who made them - but on why other people having rushed to condemn someone the vast majority of them have no relationship with."
"Is Kevin Durant part of the media? What point that I made, are you contending?"
Kevin Durant liked a photo praising farrakhan
"Kevin Durant liked the post that in support of Farrakhan. Farrakhan calls Hitler a great man and Jews termites. Stephen Jackson is a former NBA player and is still on tv calling things facts. There is no response.   These same NBA players have said repeatedly that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" I do not understand why you are so adamant about not calling this out, when it is such a clear double standard. Is it worth it to be against people asking for others to call out anti-semitism? Is that a worthwhile fight?"
"&gt; Situation being reversed, he would have been.  And if another player had liked some racist post like Kevin Durant did, he'd also be under serious hot water."
"&gt; Everyone speaking on the topic have been against him  Except for Shannon Sharp, Kevin Durant, and Larry Johnson."
"I’m Jewish too. I’ve never felt there’s too much focus on anti-Black racism. My reasoning is that I’m not in competition with any minority. I don’t want concern about anti-Semitism to come at the expense of compassion for Black Americans, which in my view has always been lacking. However, I think it’s fair to say discrimination against Jews, Latinx people, and Asians should get a lot more public attention than it does now.  I think DeSean Jackson should have been immediately cut and probably never hired to play again for what he said. ESPN should have immediately and publicly severed ties with Stephen Jackson. Kevin Durant should have faced serious consequences, perhaps a public statement from his team about why what he did was wrong and maybe a requirement to donate a big chunk of change to fighting anti-Semitism. And there should have been outrage inside and outside the NBA forcing him to apologize and commit to learning about anti-Semitism.  There also should have been clear, immediate statements on this issue from NBA leaders like Adam Silver, Gregg Popovich, and LeBron James.  I don’t think any of what I said should be at all controversial. This wasn’t some borderline stuff. This was clear anti-Semitism. Stephen Jackson and, to a lesser extent, Kevin Durant, are actively supporting someone who is advocating hatred of Jews and voicing support for Hitler. I thought this kind of sentiment, though more widespread than one would hope, was at least taboo in this country.  So, I agree with OP. I am totally disturbed by the lack of public comment from the NBA and from the people and companies affiliated with it. A few isolated ESPN personalities here and there aren’t enough, and frankly they’re going easy on Stephen Jackson and failing to call out KD at all. It’s beyond disappointing, especially because of the long affiliation the NBA has had with many Jews over the years, including the last two commissioners."
Kevin Durant and JR Smith should have their contracts voided!!!!!
"Because of how many people in the NBA attacked Drew Brees and called out NFL owners - now all of a sudden, there’s silence.    Just completely and utter silence. And then you have major athletes like Kevin Durant co-signing on that shit.  And don’t act like this is just two athletes - Stephen “Clown” Jackson was a major face in the recent protests. Fuck out of here with that shit."
"Just to be clear, your position is that if someone praises a horrible person it's okay to run a headline saying ""_____ praises different horrible person""  So I could say ""Kevin Durant praises Mao"" if he praised Farrahkhan and that'd be completely okay because they're both bad people, even though it's a complete fabrication"
"Hey, NBA players, you have a recruit level difficulty of a task.  All you have to do is say Hitler was a bad person and you don’t agree with him.   Lebron: “.....”  Kevin Durant: “nah, I’m a snek, I agree with Hitler”  What about you Damian Lilliard, you said that if white people are silent they’re basically for racism.  You made an entire song about it and how you would call out other basketball players.  Dame: “....”  Kyrie: “I have something...”  No not you.  Welp, I guess this sums it, these men are basketball players, not role models."
"&gt; Kevin Durant likes a picture of Louis Farrakhan, and hasn’t spoken on the matter and has not defended desean Jackson.  Liking that picture is already a pretty clear statement."
"JR Smith and Kevin Durant both showed support of Stack's tweet by either liking or commenting. The fact that neither of them have walked back their support is troubling.   It seems stupid to have to retract a like, but that's social media for you. Likes aren't insignificant, especially if you're an NBA player."
"He's the commissioner. There are a ton of things he could do.  He could allow players to wear Jewish symbols to support anti anti-senitism. He could have something placed on the courts. Let's not forget, Kevin Durant liked the post. This isn't something that the NBA is immune from, especially because the league has been so supportive of BLM--as they should be.  He could, at the very least make a statement, denouncing racism against Jews. He could partner with Jewish groups to help educate NBA players about who Hitler is, and what Hitler stood for.  If I spent 5 more minutes I could think of more.   The point is, he's now done nothing. Some people are okay with that. I'm not."
"&gt;It took the 2017 Cavs to get every call in Game 4 and have a historic team shooting night for them to win a game in the Finals.  The Cavs were breaking offensive records all playoffs long it was never a question that they could get this hot only when. And the refs definitely didn't help them hit 20+ threes. It's actually pretty pathetic making such an excuse for that Warriors team.   &gt;That Cavs team didn’t play any competition in the East so it makes sense that their offense was amazing because they were playing low IQ teams.  That's why the east finals teams regularly post all-time great ORTGs? Oh wait, they don't. And the Cavs were also playing amazing offense against the Warriors.   Steve Kerr himself said that the 2017 Cavs are a super underrated team.   &gt;“I think that was the highest level of basketball I’ve ever seen in my life. I just thought that was Cleveland’s best team of the four years that we faced them. I thought they were much better that year than they were the previous year when they beat us in seven. Obviously, we were a lot better as well, adding Kevin Durant to the mix and being fully healthy and motivated and ready to go. So the level of play was just astounding. Particularly at the offensive end.”  I'm just gonna go ahead and hold his opinion in higher regard than yours if that's ok."
"There should be a distinction for First Ballot HoF and those who will probably qualify *eventually*. LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, etc are first ballot no doubt. Players like Klay Thompson might take a few years but they have a case to make it eventually, you can't be a 3x champion as a key piece to a dynasty and the greatest shooting backcourt in history and not be a HoFer eventually."
"I was upset with The Decision, but I've definitely changed my views on these types of decisions, (like Ray Allen leaving the C's, like Johnny Damon leaving the Red Sox, like Kevin Durant leaving OKC).   These are all employees and all workers, working for an organization. I'm not going to get upset with my co-worker who leaves my organization for anther one with a better opportunity or a better family situation or simply because they want to move. It's kind of immature to do that. Likewise, it seems a little immature for us to get upset when a player chooses where he wants to work and what organization he wants to work for.  Idk if it's racist to be upset about these things, but it definitely kind of feels immature."
"Draymond, JR Smith, Bradley Beal, Steph curry, Vince carter, Quinn cook, Jayson Tatum, Trae young, John Wall, ja morant Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Lou Williams have all been on Stephen Jackson’s podcast."
"Hi guys I'm not looking to start an inter sub war, I'd just like to see if this subreddit can be a place to freely express what I thought to be fairly non-controversial views.  There's a post on r/soccer about a great move the MLS team Philadelphia Union have made promoting those lost to police violence. I made an, in my opinion, fair comment, about how it's disappointing that Union minority owner Kevin Durant showed a supportive reply to what the NFL player tweeted.  I received a reply accusing me of detracting from BLM. I believe he posts here, and if you see this, I'm not targeting you. Your opinions are your opinions.  I made what I believe to be a fair response about why everyone should be equal. This got removed with no explanation. So did another reply to the same guy along the lines of ""The guy quoted Hitler ffs""  I'd just like to post a screenshot of what I said, as I believe it has a right to be aired - especially when nothing the other guy said got removed.  [Here's the comment](http://imgur.com/a/bruTyun)  I'm not looking for a pat on the back. I'm also not coming here because of the tenuous link, I do lurk on this sub, I just don't comment that much as I'm fairly new to basketball and it's not that popular over here haha. I just want a right to reply, and a hope that the mods here are a little less trigger happy with the remove button haha"
"Kevin Durant ""likes"" some dumb shit and he's instantly anti-semitic?  Reddit is dumb af sometimes omg"
"Kevin Durant likes a picture of Louis Farrakhan, and hasn’t spoken on the matter not defended desean Jackson.  Stephen Jackson isn’t in the nba anymore.  If players are asked about it, I am eager to hear their responses. What you are currently asking for is just grandstanding you create a false equivalency in order to criticize them."
"It's because he's never had the opportunity, or the burden, depending on how you look at it, of having to be the best player. It's easy to be this super efficient shooter and elite defender when you also have Steph Curry, Draymond Green and later Kevin Durant taking on the burden of creating offense. How would his efficiency stats be if he was the primary creator on offense? How much would his volume stats increase? Could he still maintain elite efficiency while taking on that burden? Can he keep his defensive play with the added workload? These are all questions that Klay hasn't had to answer. It's no question he's probably the best sidekick to a star in the league, and that makes him a star. But he also benefited from playing next to Steph Curry. I mean he scored 60 points on like 12 dribbles or something stupid like that, right? How many teams would allow him to do that?   I would love to see how a team functions with Klay Thompson as the main offensive option. I'm not sure how good that team would be though. But maybe he rises to the occasion and still remains a highly efficient and prolific shooter and defender in a less ideal situation."
"Remember when Reddit penned an “open letter” to spez about racism, shut down many subreddits for a day, and told everyone that they are vehemently against hate? I’m very bothered by the lack of response to Stephen Jackson’s comments.   I’m very upset right now.  Jews have been vilified for decades. Anybody with half of a brain can see that. Additionally, many, many Jews were the first to call out systemic racism and condemn the officer that killed George Floyd.  Drew Brees literally said he doesn’t support kneeling for the National anthem, and he got absolutely destroyed by everyone. Lebron was on his ass in a matter of hours. 31,000+ comments on his Instagram post calling him a clown. Terry Crews literally says that we need to be careful and we are all children of God, and he gets an attempted canceling of his livelihood.  Mike Pence says “all lives matter”, and it hits the front page of reddit with 100,000 upvotes with everyone calling him a racist.  Then, he apologized when he had nothing to apologize for, and he once again got thousands and thousands of comments calling him “disingenuous”, a “clown”, a “racist” amongst other things.  Stephen Jackson has basically QUADRUPLE downed on his ant-Semitic comments, and all we’ve gotten are crickets. Nobody had said anything. ESPN called his comments “controversial.” So Drew Brees is a racist for saying he loves this country and doesn’t feel comfortable kneeling for the national anthem, but Stephen Jackson is “controversial” for basically quoting Adolf fucking Hitler and alluding to the fact that Jews control the world and “hold negroes down”.  Nobody called him out. The most we got was a random Ray Allen article about Auschwitz. Nobody said he was wrong for doing that. Nobody said shit. His Instagram comments are a cesspool of toxicity. People are telling him he’s right and has nothing to apologize for.  Rachel Nichols, in the most ridiculous response ever, says “BUT A LOT OF OTHERS ARE HATEFUL TOO.”  If you don’t call out racism like this when it happens, how are you ANY better than true racists? How is this behavior acceptable? How is ESPN getting a pass for not saying anything? Why is Adam Silver not vehemently disagreeing with Jackson’s comments and doing something? Why is everybody so quiet?  This entire situation is beyond embarrassing and hurtful. I don’t even know what to say. This is not ok behavior. I’ve lost all respect for Stephen Jackson, Lebron James, Matt Barnes, Kevin Durant, amongst many others.  They are so ignorant that it’s not even funny anymore."
"Yet another reason to hate Kevin Durant, who apparently supported these anti-Semitic statements."
"Kevin Durant. Didn't like what he did, but he's clearly one of the best offensive players we've ever seen"
Andrew Wiggins is no Kevin Durant
"This incident originated with the Eagles’ top receiver. His antisemitic post received support from Jameis Winston, Marquis Goodwin, Kevin Durant, and JR Smith. It had a prominent activist and former player in Stephen Jackson defending and even promoting the hate speech. How are several notable players from two sports supporting and/or advocating hate speech not a bigger story than Drew Brees believing we should stand for the flag?"
Kevin Durant has a maximum of 2 seasons with defense that even approximates elite.
Where are Kevin Durant and JR Smith involved in this? I don't even like either of them but that is such a bullshit thing to bring up about someone without including any sources.
"As a Bay Area native who grew up rooting for Cal and the Warriors, FUCK YOU Stephen Jackson, DeSean Jackson, and Kevin Durant.   You were some of my heroes growing up - especially you DeSean!   As a Jew, I always felt a sense of solidarity with other minorities, and always felt a mutual respect from them. This clearly isn’t the case.   I would never even dream of saying Black Lives DON’T Matter, but the three of you are just as bad as any racist white bigot in this country. Period. Get fucked."
I think the biggest thing that has gone largely overlooked today is Kevin Durant agreeing with him. It's one thing to have JR Smith do it. But Kevin Durant is one of the biggest names in the league. But Kevin is Kevin so he'll probably get bitchy and defensive on Twitter if someone calls him out on it.
"how many players do you think are superstars  &gt;You don't put up the numbers and explosive performances he has had without being a special talent.  sure, he's a special talent.  he's not a superstar.  also, your language here REALLY shows your bias. look at this:  &gt;He's probably not a lead your team as the number one guy star  no, he definitely isn't.  &gt;I think the difference is **maybe** Klay isn't as likely as a Damian Lillard to get his team into the playoffs as the #1.  no, he definitely isn't as likely.  &gt;**Maybe** Damian Lillard can create his shot more than Klay  no, he definitely can.  you use words like ""maybe"" and ""probably"" for obvious statements that are negative towards klay. then you proceed to toss them aside and show 100% certainty for statements positive towards klay:  &gt;But he **dang sure** is going to be a player that is more likely to win a championship with his kind of skillset.  so you're 100% sure, no uncertainty, that klay is more likely to win a championship in a vacuum due to his skillset. but you're uncertain that he's a worse shot creator than damian fucking lillard?   have you ever watched either player play? honest question  &gt;But he dang sure is going to be a player that is more likely to win a championship with his kind of skillset.  if he plays with a lebron james, stephen curry, or kevin durant, right? lol. he ain't doing shit on his own. which is why he isn't a superstar. THOSE players are superstars. not klay."
"[Yes, depends on how much you trust SAS](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-wasnt-too-fond-steve-kerr-stephen-smith-says)"
Kevin Durant won an MVP award not too long ago
"Kevin Durant is a way better passer than Kawhi/Giannis. Certainly Kawhi.   In a last second possession Curry isn’t great at finding the right pass either ,  He noodle arms many passes and can’t beat initial defender as easily"
Ya that ‘18 series had no business going 7 games. The drift away from the beautiful movement offense we’d grown accustomed to seeing from GSW under Kerr towards a much heavier dose of stagnant [KD-iso ball](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/5/30/17407722/nba-playoffs-2018-kevin-durant-warriors-rockets-isolations) was the primary culprit imo
Remember when Kevin Durant [got a medal from the city for following an ambulance to get him to stay in OK] (http://www.news9.com/story/5e34b23c527dcf49dad8d15c/kevin-durant-clears-path-for-paramedics-responding-to-an-emergency). Dude was just trying to save time lol.
Their draft picks are going to be Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"The guy who actually plays winning basketball and can lead a team to a championship. Paul George and Westbrook could never be the first option on a championship team. And i am pretty sure Westbrook can't be the second best option on a championship team either.   Kevin Durant made the right decision, because if he stayed with OKC and didn't win a ring people would disregard him like they do with Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Steve Nash, etc."
Warriors had almost the best 5 year stretch possible. Expecting a better scenario than that is quite unrealistic.  I mean even if you put Michael Jordan instead of Kevin Durant there is a fair chance that they won't do any better than they already did.
We’re all Kevin Durant.
No I'm Kevin Durant go fuck myself!
Kevin Durant
"I agree. I decided to ignore that completely because u/locoa53I said that Kevin Durant handicapped his stats by choosing to go to the warriors. His main argument was focusing on the PPG difference between the two regardless of their situation. Therefore, I did the exact same thing when considering their playoff stats. I can see the case for Harden&gt;KD, but imo, KD is a better scorer overall."
"What are you talking about dude. With his height and skillset his ceiling is Kevin Durant or Kristaps. I dont think he's gonna get close to that, but the potential is staggering."
"His popularity exploded after he had a big put-back dunk over Kevin Durant who didn’t box Caruso out. It was a big explosion in part because he’s more athletic than one might think at first glance.   Now he is a fan favourite because he is constantly making hustle plays and subtle effort plays on defence, and he occasionally has an eye-popping athleticism highlight. He is an unselfish role player who is really good at off-ball skills like setting screens, making cuts, and disrupting passing lanes. That kind of player fits perfectly beside two ball-dominant superstars like LeBron and AD, and this great fit is in part why LeBron and Caruso are one of, if not the highest +/- duo in the entire league.   He’s one of those players who affects the game mostly outside of what is shows in the box scores, which just leads to more confusion from NBA fans who don’t necessarily watch Lakers games and wonder why this unremarkable shooting guard is getting such high praise.   If you want to hear more about why Caruso is actually a good player, I strongly recommend listening to Zach Lowe’s podcast episode where he interviews Caruso."
It’s been a while... am I doing this right?  **FUCK KEVIN DURANT**
"Superstar: Very few of them. Very popular, MVP candidates if everything goes their way, All-NBA candidates. Can carry a team. Will always be blamed for a loss.   LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard   Star: Need good players around them to be in contention. Popular, All-Stars. May be blamed for a loss.   Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum, Pascal Siakam, Dame, Jokic, Lowry, Kemba, etc.   Great player: A lot of players fall into this category. The top of them are borderline all-stars. Very inconsistent or have glaring flaws. Can put up good numbers on a bad team, but are role players on a good team. Can be blamed for a loss, generally won’t.   Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, Jamal Murray, Dlo, Zach LaVine, John Collins, Enes Kanter, Andrew Wiggins, Lonzo Ball, etc   Role players: Do their job and that’s it. Not in All-star contention. Most of the league is this. Can start or come of the bench. Will never be blamed for a loss.   Theis, Chris Boucher, Josh Richardson, Myers Leonard, Terry Rozier, Kuzma, JaMychal Green, etc"

"Kevin Durant is a better offensive player.  In 2014, He carried a top 5 offense with similar usage To harden. The difference is that KD in the playoffs led better offenses than Harden in the playoffs. 2012/2014/2016 (OKCs 3 healthy playoff runs), OKC posted the best postseason offense when filtered for competition.  Hardens rockets fall off offensively in the playoffs.   Both KD/Harden as no 1 options get you 55-65 wins, KDs teams in the playoffs, all factors being equal perform better on both sides of the ball."

"I agree with you, but at the same time, NBA players often mention God. Kevin Durant has, and was publically baptized, LeBron mentioned God when he won in 2016, and Kawhi mentioned he prayed ""every day"" during the 2019 Playoff run. So wouldn't it stand to reason that there would be more players how could relate to him?"
"It's unfathomably hard to eat that much clean.  5 pounds of chicken breast and 5 pounds of broccoli is only about 4500 calories. That's 10 pounds of food. I'm done eating for today and ate about 4 pounds of food. I'm 6'4"" 210 and active. a 250% increase would be crazy. I'm still massively full from a double rice, double chicken, tortilla on the side Chipotle bowl I ate 8 hours ago.  So what do these guys do? Eat a lot of carbs. Smoothies, Shakes, Ice cream.   Zion eats like an NFL linebacker. He has to.   We can't be expecting that every NBA player in history is Kevin Durant or Bol Bol."
"“Durant from deep... Bang! Bang, oh what a shot from Kevin Durant!”  Magic 141 - 108 Nets"
"Funny how you and several others r/nba will jump through hoops to give Hayward the benefit of the doubt after his wife donating money to Trumps campaign and previously following the likes of Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk on social media, but immediately label someone like Kevin Durant an anti-Semite for liking an Instagram video about vaccines"
"Wow.   In games 5, 6, and 7 in that series, Kevin Durant scored **40, 37, and 32** respectively.   But he couldn't buy a bucket?  KD is a fuckin snake but this is just a GOD AWFUL take."
not sure if i’m watching Brandon Ingram or Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant lite
Kevin Durant lite lite is lighting it up!
"Imagine putting Kevin Durant over KG and Karl Malone, wow that’s ridiculous"
ain't nobody gonna like it if he pulls a Kevin Durant though.
I like that it's called the Kevin Durant situation
"Lol he was the best in 2015 and not exactly damning when the best player on your team is Kevin Durant, arguably the best scorer and shooter in nba history along side Steph."

"&gt;Brevity isn't laziness, it's the ability to convey yourself efficiently.  I apologize. I tried brevity, but I still wasn't able to communicate to you effectively. So I tried to be more verbose in hopes that I could bridge our gap in understanding.  Based upon what I know now, I think that:  Deshawn Jackson and Kevin Durant are ignorant.  Mustapha Farrakhan is malicious.  As I said before, I believe all three are bigoted.  If you are actually interested in my reasons for thinking this, let me know."
"Lol he's taken the rockets to the western conference finals twice, with the help of Chris Paul and Dwight Howard. Kevin Durant has led the Thunder, with Westbrook, to multiple conference finals and a finals berth before even going to Golden State. Then, in the playoffs with the warriors, he destroyed everybody and won back to back finals MVPs over another top-25 all-time guy (curry). This is just an attempt to shit on Durant, and a poor one."
"Kevin Durant right now is in the range of 10-15 for me along with Hakeem Olajuwon, Julius Erving, Oscar Robertson and Moses Malone   Harden and Westbrook are just outside my top 20. A ring will allow them to break into it"
"... because he had way better help through most of those seasons. Many of those wins came from when he had KD. You really don’t think *Kevin Durant* deserves some credit for getting those playoff wins? In some of those wins Curry shit terribly and KD had to carry the offense.   In case you didn’t know, Kevin Durant alone is better than any player Harden has ever played with in the Rockets. I’m sure every star in this league wish they could defer to KD when their shot isn’t falling."
He damn near dunked on Kevin Durant with that one
"No, my point is that in the playoffs Russ has a tendency to reach even more. There is good Russ, and bad Russ. There is in-control Russ, and out-of-control Russ. A quick look at his playoff history will indicate that when the stakes get higher, Russ tries harder to do things himself, and lean on teammates even less - not a good thing when your teammates are Kevin Durant and James Harden. At least not if you intend to advance. You would think it would be the opposite - that when playoffs come and possessions become more crucial that your point guard would make sure that the best player on the floor got the ball more but what really occurs - and this is fact - is that the least efficient option on the floor inexplicably shoots MORE, and worse, than usual.  My point is that you are better to have a team of role players around Harden that allow him to be at his best and just do what they do well than to have his impact mitigated by a guy who has a tendency to become even more a version of ""bad Russ"" than normal when rotations tighten. That's a bad thing since out of the Rockets 6 most effective lineups this season each and every one had both Harden and McLemore on the court - and only 3 had Westbrook.  It is no coincidence that Russ has a negative on/off. His success generally isn't tied to the Rockets success - Harden's is."
"respect for treating this like a learning experience. you have a great attitude. it doesn't bother me people are skeptic, but it does bother me when they avoid conclusions they don't want to hear and treat reality like it is a thing to manipulate. truth is, we are all in this together. it fucking sucks. denying truth won't help us.   to build on the other response which was great, viral load has to do with how much virus is present at the time of the measurement. if you start out with a *single virus*, your immune system (depending on your circumstances) can fight it off as it reproduces. imagine your body's immune system as an all-time great team. if draymond green lands you, no problem. your immune system will fuck 5 draymond greens up.  but if someone who is highly contagious coughs/sneezes/talks around you, then the air now has A LOT of virus, and not only that but the air could contain multiple mutations of the virus. in other words, your great team might have to deal with draymond green, but also steph curry, klay thompson, kevin durant, and andre iguodala. good luck.  that's just one way of looking at it. tbh, most people don't start off defending the 2018 warriors with a great team. they start off with a bad team."
I mean look at him with that 3 ball. People say Kevin Durant is unblockable with that jump shot... bol bol is about 3x more unblockable and his form is great
"He studies Paul George.  &gt; “When I moved here I watched Paul George, Kevin Durant, because I was a big but I always liked to handle (the ball). Usually African kids come and they get put on the block, so that’s how we see each other. People here see African kids as energy guys, as bigs. With all the guys who came before, they were tall. They don’t look for guards from Africa. Americans have all the guards, you know?  &gt; “It’s hard. It’s always been bigs. But I always liked guards.”"
That OKC team wasn’t “stacked.” Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were each 22 years old and 21 year old James Harden averaged 12.2 PPG that season.
"Star players rarely stick with their original team regardless of market size.  Run through the modern stars that have reached their first FA contract and see who signed with their original team. It's very few, especially with wing players who are in the very highest demand.  Paul George - IND - No  James Harden - OKC - No  Steph Curry - GSW - Yes  Kevin Durant - OKC - No  Kawhi Leonard - SAS - No  Dame Lillard - POR - Yes  Kyrie Irving - CLE - No  Lebron James - CLE - No  Blake Griffin - LAC - No  Russel Westbrook - OKC - Yes  Anthony Davis - NOP - No  Jimmy Butler - CHI - No  John Wall - WAS - Yes  Chris Paul - NOP - No"
"Rings, most likely. Happiness, we have no idea. Legacy, see one Kevin Durant. Earnings, the Bucks can offer more."

"But it’s not really overstating it.  You shouldn’t ignore the corruption of these organizations, because then it will allow them to continue exploiting others.  You should never be silent about corruption—it’s bad on both sides and should be called out regardless.   Calling out guys like Stephen Jackson or even highlighting how Kevin Durant likes Desean’s post isn’t helpful to the cause, but ignoring it is no better than when your opposition does it either."
"sheesh, Sonics-Thunder org. :  Jack Sikma     Shawn Kemp // Serge Ibaka   Scottie Pippin // Kevin Durant   Dennis Johnson // James Harden   Gary Payton // Russell Westbrook"
"Yeah, there's been disscussion around everyone from Deshawn Jackson to Kevin Durant to  Mustapha Farrakhan. Who did you want to start with?"
Sonics/Thunder  Gary Payton  Russell Westbrook  James Harden  Kevin Durant  Shawn Kemp/Serge Ibaka   Technically Scottie Pippen too
Next Kevin Durant😤
"Well it no secret that the cavs were targeting steph by virtue of him not being Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson and Harris Barnes. No guard at stephs size can truly guard Lebron and kyrie roasts many good defensive PGs so its wasnt fair to judge steph as a bad defender for getting scored on by those guys"
"I'm Kevin Durant y'all know who I am. Proceedes to average 37 a game. Too bad he ruined his legacy, could've gone toe to toe with Bron as the #2 goat."
"Hey I appreciate that, I really just see 9/10 people write off the pre Durant teams but I think the schemes we ran before Kevin were so cool, so many misleading screens to get the defense to bite. And Steph and Klay may as well be track stars haha   I’d kill for a gravity metric though fr"
I think it's not hard to say that Giannis is probably better than post injury Kevin Durant will be.
"Aside from Donnie Nelson, who's going to get Cuban to buy Sacramento's first round pick to draft the kid. After he turns out to be the second coming of Kevin Durant, Sacramento fans get so fed up that the entire city ditches Vivek and moves itself to Seattle overnight, buildings and all."
He underperforms significantly but he hasn’t been “garbage” in any whole playoff run since his first couple of seasons in Houston. The two catastrophically bad games he’s had make everyone think he’s a DeRozan level choker. Kevin Durant suffered a similar drop in playoff scoring efficiency before joining Golden State.
"Its not always just race, its looks in general. There were a ton of Kevin Durant comparisons for Isaac for no real reason other than looking similar"
Kevin Durant is in my top 5 for sure.
Kevin Durant
"To be honest I have no idea; however, I would doubt it. I personally think they have what *appears* to be an amazing weight room and staff. I think some players who like to lift (i.e. Hayes) take advantage of this and get stronger. But look at Mo Bamba, Kevin Durant or even Avery Bradley-- all are guys who I think didnt lift before college so didnt really lift during. Or at least it didnt help them the same. . . KD didnt even bench the bar 1 time at the combine. I think if everyone got PEDs they would have better results across the board."
the santa cruz warriors with 6 games from stephen curry and draymond green and 5 of klay thompson. if they didn't want such a shitty bench maybe they shouldn't have signed kevin durant
"I can explain Texas.   They are known for having an elite weight room and training staff. This is what swayed Kevin Durant, Avery Bradley and Mo Bamba. Come here and we will get your body ready for the NBA.   So a lot of NBA lengthy bigs go there to put on weight. I at least believe Jarrett Allen and Mo Bamba did."
Kevin Durant was clearly the best player in the league going into the playoffs. KD
"By that same token, Steph is a missed Shumpert three and a missed Kevin Durant three from having 0 rings. LeBron has shown himself to be the significantly better player both in head to head matchups and in general. Using the fact that Steph has a better record in the finals is ludicrous considering how much better LeBron has performed there and the teams each of them had around him. LeBron has done more by putting together some of the best playoff performances in NBA history year in and year out. It's not even close between them."
"&gt; The Warriors had no starting SF or C against the Blazers  nobody cares. Blazers are not a contender. They're one of the weakest teams to make the WCF in recent memory, one of the weakest teams curry faced in his career in the WCF. It's like brons cavs beating up on 2017 celtics or raps. Who cares, you're expected to win lol. The teams aren't a threat to you.  &gt;  but KD accomplished his feats because of Steph  No it's because of the entire warriors team. You had a great system and guys called Klay and Dray in case you forgot. You wanna talk about kawhi having so much help when curry also always does. Don't act like having KD didn't help curry as well from 2017-2019. Don't forget the reason everyone was bitching about KD. The Warriors were favorites to win the 2017 title right after the 2016 finals ended, and still got to add Kevin durant.    kawhi needed the help just like every star player does. and because he was going up against way better teams in Sixers and Bucks, and didn't have an MVP like KD in 12 games. Curry has never in his career carried a team like kawhi did vs philly. **Accounting for competition and supporting cast, curry was not better in 3/4 of the playoffs.**"
"I get the argument. Steph can't rise over any defender and hit a jumper like Kawhi or Durant. He can't physically overwhelm his man and bludgeon his way to the hoop like LeBron or Giannis. But I think it's still an antiquated take. You don't just have to run an iso. Set Curry a high screen and he will rip up any defense. The Kevin Love stop doesn't mean that Curry can't cook just about any big in a switch. And that's not to mention the devastation he causes off ball and in transition.   The only argument against Curry as an all timer (like top 5-10 player all time) is that his size does make him a target on defense and limits the way you can build your roster. If you have a wing sized guy who can initiate your offense you can fill your point guard with a number of guys, a wing sized defensive option like Ron Harper or a shooting specialist like Steve Kerr. You can play Kawhi Leonard with Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry, with Steph you'd probably be too small to play all 3 together too often even though Lowry/VanVleet are rugged defenders."
"I just started watching basketball relatively recently. (about 2 years now). The great teams of the past according to their eras  50s and 60s: celtics (they won 11 rings in 13 years lead by Bill russell in all of those championships). Another player that defined that era along with Russell was wilt chamberlain( probably has about 200 nba records to his name and is probably the most statistically dominant player of all time) (he is the only person to score 100 points in a game and the next highest individual score for a player is 81(by kobe bryant)  The best 70s player was kareem. Dude won 6 mvps that decade I think.  The 80s is know for the rivalry between Lary bird and magic Johnson. Magic won 5 with his lakers(while playing with an older kareem in his team) he and bird won 3 with his celtics. He's the last player to win 3 mvps in a row.  The 90s was Jordan's decade. He won 6 championships with 3peats from 91 to 93 and from 96 to 98 with his Chicago bulls and he won finals mvp in all of those championships. Between the era of magic, bird and Jordan the bad boy hadpistons (Detroit pistons) is led by Isiah Thomas won 2 rings in a row.  The Two years between the 2 bulls 3peats Hakeem olajuwon won 2 titles with the rockets. One of those seasons he achieved a historic feat where he won mvp, dpoy, finals mvp and a championship which hasn't been done till now. After that the spurs led by Tim Duncan won a championship in99. The 3 years after that shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant did a 3 peat from 2000 to 2002.the 2000s were domi ated by the lakers and the spurs.  Kobe won another 2 chips without shaq in 2009 and 2010.shaq won one without kobe with the heat in 2006(kobe and shaq had a feud so shaq was traded. Other notable chlionship teams in the era were the underdog Detroit pistons in 04 and the kg, Paul pierce Ray Allen super team of the Boston celtics in 2008. The 2010s was lebrons decade. He won 3 titles. 2 with Miami(in a super team with dwayne wade and Chris bosh) and 1 with cleveland(this ones famous cuz the cavs came back from a 1-3 deficit again the golden state warriors in the nba finals. Talking about the warriors. I they won 3 chips. 2 of which was with the greatest super teams ever with Kevin durant, steph curry, klay thompson in the same team. Curry won 2 mvps in this decade one of which was the unanimous mvp nba history.  The spurs won one title in 2014 where kawhi leonard was finals mvp. Kawhi won another finals mvp with his line seaosn with the raptors where he e at the golden state warriors in the finals (however kd was injured and klay got injured in game 6). In 2011 dirk nowitzki lead the underdog Dallas mavericks in one of the greatest playoff runs ever while sweeping the back to back champ the lakers led by kobe, beat the spurs led by Duncan, Parker and ginobili(these 3 are on the greatest trios ever) and also beat the super team miami heat with lebron bosh and wade in their first seaosn together. That's all ik in terms of nba history. Might've forgotten a few but yea hope this was helpful."

" This is my metric for (NBA) superstar -- do you have a chance to win a championship just because we got you?"" ESPN's Bomani Jones said Thursday on ""The Right Time with Bomani Jones"" podcast. ""We'll work the rest out, but if the first thing you tell me is that this guy plays for us, then we got a chance to do this...[with Steph] to have the chance you have to put this fairly specific set of things around him. And he can't guard nobody.If you tell me that you have Kevin Durant, you have a chance to win the championship. If you tell me you have Kawhi Leonard, my immediate response is, 'You have a chance to win a championship.' And the same with LeBron [James and Giannis Antetokounmpo]. You tell me you got Steph -- I want you to tell me a little bit more.  Pretty easy to deduce he does not see Steph as a superstar."
"Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Steve Kerr have said Curry IS the system. Here’s what KD said in 2018 while Curry was injured and GSW was playing like a lottery team:  https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/972960371270144000?s=21"
"More context, Bomani’s full original quote:  &gt; If you tell me that you have Kevin Durant, you have a chance to win the championship. If you tell me you have Kawhi Leonard, my immediate response is, 'You have a chance to win a championship.' And the same with LeBron [James and Giannis Antetokounmpo]. You tell me you got Steph -- I want you to tell me a little bit more ... my only problem with Steph though -- this is a big problem -- getting his own shot. He can get his own shot if he shoots it from 40 (feet).   &gt; ""He's got sick handle and all that stuff. There's something different. It's hard to explain what it is with Steph, but Steph is somehow like the greatest system player of all time. And I'm not saying that to shade him. But you are not going 1-4 flat and being like, 'Get us a bucket.' ""  He then says he can’t score in iso like Kyrie or Dame and scores off “trickeration”  On JJ’s pod, Bomani brings up that game 7 shot as his evidence. JJ’s response: “What if that shot against Kevin Love went in? We've seen him make that shot hundreds of times. You're talking about 1 possession, 1 shot, as your evidence for he cant get his own shot"""
"Nice try, Kevin Durant"
"Well said, Kevin.  -- ~~Kevin~~ A big fan of Kevin Durant"
"Kevin Durant hasn't gotten past the first round without at least one other all star on his team, and he's the 2nd best player in the league."
Kevin Durant is unequivocally the most hated NBA player
"Hes the most overrated player in the game. He is Iverson reincarnated. Yes, he seems like a great dude. And he is an incredible athlete. But he's not a great basketball player. Even the players thought he was overrated as I recall in that one survey.  Part of it is self awareness too. He should be the engine that fuels a great offense. Its unthinkable that a guy with the greatest offensive weapon of our generation as a teammate thought it was ok to shoot 20+ times a game despite poor efficiency. Kevin Durant should have a bookcase full of scoring titles and there is only one reason he does not."
It’s been true for two seasons and it’s also true for select other players like Harden and Kevin Durant
"yeah barring anything crazy (i.e. career threatening injury, off court incidents) he looks like he'll finish as a borderline top 10 player. For all i know he'll finish in the top 10 with the way he's progressed in a relatively short time.  At the very least I think it's reasonable to view him finishing comfortably in the top 20 but not top 10, like a Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, maybe even Steph"
Kevin Durant has entered the chat
That weakness is no one to guard Kevin Durant
&gt; Kawhi Leonard would like a word.  [Kevin Durant would like a word](https://youtu.be/cObBpdH-h2U)
"No, There’s not a single defender on the Clippers that Can guard Kevin Durant."
What's that got to do with where he'd be selected in 2020?  Last years first and second team all nba players   Giannis Antetokounmpo    Stephen Curry    Paul George    James Harden    Nikola Jokić   2nd Team  Kevin Durant    Joel Embiid    Kyrie Irving    Kawhi Leonard    Damian Lillard   Who could Penny replace?
"&gt; Calling the at worst 2nd best player of all time the king of all trades isn’t stanning  Ok bro, keep typing while looking at your poster on the wall.  &gt; he’s 4th ALL TIME in ppg, 2nd in the modern era.  Karl Malone is 2nd All-time and 1st in the modern era in points scored and nobody with a working mind considers him as good as a scorer as Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant or Kevin Durant. Scoring a lot of points don't automatically make you better than others. Kareem has more points than Michael and nobody doubts who was the GOAT scorer or the GOAT in general."
"Yes, he has never been the best passer in the league or the best defender in the league, as guys like CP3/Nash and Dwight Howard/Marc Gasol/Kawhi Leonard denied him that, also he has never been better than Kevin Durant as a scorer and before KD was around, Kobe was averaging 35 with Smush Parker and Kwame Brown in his starting lineup.  LeBron has been among the best in all of those categories, which made him the best player in the league for a while, but he has never been the best at one specific thing.  There's a reason that in 17 years of dominance, this year will only be the 2nd time he leads the league at something, for context, a guy like Hakeem Olajuwon led the league in a statistical category five times in his 17-year career."

I wouldn’t look to video of a shoot around to disprove the history of modern medicine.
"Kevin Durant, easy.  What has Durant done in his career that can match Kawhi leading two separate non-superteams to championships?  Couldn’t lead a strong OKC team to a ship and only “won” after riding the winningest regular season team of all-time’s coat tails to some rings? Wow good job KD."
"OKC is kind of a messed up story.  It used to be the Sonics.  A guy from OKC bought the team from the owner of Starbucks promising to keep the team in Seattle.  He pretty quickly drove the team into the ground and fans stopped showing up because they were really bad.  He asked the Seattle City Council for money to renovate the arena/build a new one and they said no.  Using that as a pretext, he moved the team to OKC.    They've been very good, but kinda cursed.  For a little while they had 3 future MVPs in Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden.  They traded away James Harden in a really bad trade.  Kevin Durant left in free agency to join a team that was already the best in the league (Golden State), and Westbrook asked for a trade to join Harden in Houston after OKC got embarrassed in the first round against Portland last year and his co-star, Paul George, had already demanded a trade to the Clippers to play with Kawhi Leonard."
"Kevin Durant (2012-2019)  Regular Season:  29/8/5 per 75 on 64 TS% (+12 rTS%), +8.7 BPM, .260 WS/48  Larry Bird (1982-1988)  24/9/6 per 75 on 58% TS (+4.6 rTS%), +8.2 BPM, .231 WS/48  rTS -&gt; how much more/less efficient a player is than league average Per 75 -&gt; adjusts for pace  Kevin Durant (2012-2019)  Playoffs:  28/8/4 per 75 on 60 TS%, +7.4 BPM, .202 WS/48  Larry Bird (1981-1988)  21/9/6 per 75 on 56 TS%, +7.6 BPM, .186 WS/48  NBA Finals:  KD: 30/8/5 on 67 TS%, +11.1 BPM Bird: 23/12/6 on 54% TS, +3.6 BPM   KD’s Regualr season and Post season performences on offense (Playmaking thought scoring pressure) and defense are in line with Someone like Larry bird.....James Harden Isn’t in this convo and only a fool would choose to build around him over Durant.  Like I said only LeBron is better in the modern era"
"With all due respect, Kawhi Leonard is not a top 20 all time player.  1. Kevin Durant 2. Dirk Nowitzki 3. Charles Barkley 4. David Robinson 5. Hakeem Olajuwon 6. Kevin Garnett 7. Paul Pierce 8. Jerry West 9. Steph Curry 10. Moses Malone  These are the regular top 10 all-time snubs and for the sake of making it top 20, that's not even all of them. Which one of these guys is Kawhi better than?"
I'm surprised he hasn't been tested earlier. He's bulked up to the point he only weighs 20 lbs less than Kevin Durant.
"Kinda how you can't have a Greg Oden thread without mentioning Kevin Durant, a Sam Bowie thread without mentioning Michael Jordan, or a Darko Milicic thread without mentioning Melo, Bosh, and Wade.   It sucks but Marvin will always be associated with Luka Doncic and the only people to blame are the Sacramento Kings FO."
“No disrespect to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant”
"kawhi made the decision that a Servant like kevin durant would never make, and thats the best way to put it"
Yea. I'm stating NBA players think Harden is amazing. Also you left out the best scorer in the guys you mentioned... Kevin Durant.
"In no particular order:  * Michael Jordan * James Harden * Kevin Durant * Shaquille O'Neal * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Jerry West * Dirk Nowitzki * Kobe Bryant * Wilt Chamberlain  Honorable mentions to: Steph Curry, George Gervin, Adrian Dantley, Reggie Miller, Elgin Baylor"
"Agreed. I mean my ranking isn't exactly rocket science, here the top 10 all time leaders in PPG:  &gt; 1.	Michael Jordan*	30.12 2.	Wilt Chamberlain*	30.07 3.	Elgin Baylor*	27.36 4.	LeBron James	27.07 5.	Jerry West*	27.03 6.	Kevin Durant	27.02 7.	Allen Iverson*	26.66 8.	Bob Pettit*	26.36 9.	Oscar Robertson*	25.68 10.	James Harden	25.16   And here's the top 10 most scoring titles:  &gt;  1.	Michael Jordan 10x  2. Wilt Chamberlain 7x 3. Kevin Durant 4x 3. George Gervin 4x 3. Allen Iverson 3x 6. James Harden 3x 6. Neil Johnston 3x 6. Bob McAdoo 3x 6. George Mikan.  10. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 2x 10. Kobe Bryant 2x 10. Adrian Dantley 2x  10. Tracy McGrady 2x 10. Bob Petit 2x 10. Russell Westbrook 2x   So anyone's top.10 should look pretty close.to these 2 lists. I guess Bob Petit was also quite the scorer, but 1950s is a bit too much of a reach."
"KD literally admitted that he wasn’t playing not because he wasn’t healthy, but because of the lame excuse that the restart was “so unpredictable”. Bitch made.   https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-wouldnt-have-played-nba-restart-even-if-fully-healthy"
I doubt I'll share the feel goods when they have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the floor.
"Reminder that Kevin Durant is healthy enough to play right now, but is choosing to spend his time arguing with teens online. Complete bitch."
"Nope, all the stars like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are hurt for the season"

Kevin Durant scratched his head a lot for good luck and it worked
#Kevin durant is scratching his head for good luck
I hope Kevin Durant is rooting for Jamal Murray.
If his second and third options are Lebron James and Kevin Durant maybe. Davis as the best player on a team isn't a great team.
"Yeah, she says at the beginning ""don't get mad at me, Kevin Durant"" and then at the end of the twitter thing she even adds Kevin."
"Not saying it's likely, but it's actually not a terrible pitch. One last year, get to have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and make one more run at a championship, then he can head right back to San Antonio and retire. Jerseys even look the same (Bill Russell made the Sonics look like the Celtics when he coached there)."
"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves lol if Luka plays badly you know all the Luka stans are gonna be coming out with “first NBA playoffs, takes experience to get used to the pressure, etc etc)  I agree it’s mostly a mental thing. But that mental pressure has impact players like James Harden, Kevin Durant, hell even Lebron.  Luka May be used to it...or he may not be"
"He had Kevin Durant on his team, for a while, and then Paul George. He did lead his team in those stats for two years in between those guys though."
"That was the r/NBA peak circlejerk + Lakers hate.   Rob Pelinka graduated from Michigan's Ross School of Business (which is generally considered a top 3-5 undergrad business school along with UPenn Wharton, NYU Stern, MIT Sloan, and so on in the world) with a 3.9 GPA.  JD cum laude from Michigan Law, interned at Winston &amp; Strawn (I think one of the oldest law firm in the Midwest).  Started his career as a sports agent, representing Iguodala, Channing Frye, Eric Gordon, Andre Drummond, James Harden, Kevin Durant, and of course Kobe Bryant.  An agent that was responsible for pulling out some of the biggest contract negotiations such as Iggy, Boozer, Kobe, Harden... would not know how the cap space works?   Was wild seeing ESPN sports analysts saying Pelinka might have fucked up... like you think this LAWYER who negotiated multiple contracts doesn't know how the CBA and cap space works?"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/
Since when is Kevin Durant a top 10 player all time?
Every season. If a really tall guy were to be the MVP we would look at his value to the team he plays for. We wouldn’t say “let’s see him do that on the Houston rockets small ball lineup”. Considering that the MVP has always played for the same team during their MVP season we have always looked at who brought value to their team. Kevin Durant or Steph curry might have won an MVP during their time with the warriors but never did because they couldn’t bring individual value because they had to play with eachother
Sensitive ass Kevin Durant wouldn’t do well with him lmfao
That Kevin Durant quote was amazing given the context.  But not many players can talk that and not sounds stupid.
"Pop has wanted to coach KD for years now. Hes loved his game for years and i imagine he feels hed unlock even more on both ends     ""Popovich pointed to that candid interaction with Aldridge as somewhat of a catalyst for the two coming to a better understanding before the start of the season. Asked what helped to bring about Aldridge's resurgent 2017-18 campaign, Popovich deadpanned: ""When he said, 'I want to be traded.'""  ""It's as simple as that,"" Popovich said. ""I said, 'Whoa, nobody's ever said that to me before.' It's my 20-whatever year, and nobody's ever said that like, 'I'm not enjoying this. I'm not confident. I'm not sure you want me here. I want to be traded.'""  ...  Popovich acknowledged the meeting and admitted the two shared some laughs over what would seem to be tense moments.  ""So, we had some dinners and meetings and laughed,"" Popovich said. ""I was very candid with him. I told him, 'I'd be happy to trade you. You get me Kevin Durant, and I'll drive you to the airport. I'll pack your bags. And I will drive you there, get you on the plane, and get you seated.' He laughed you know, that kind of thing. I said, 'But short of that, I'm your best buddy because you're here for another year, and you ain't going nowhere. Because we're not gonna get for you talentwise what we would want. So, let's figure this thing out.' And we did. That's what we came to."""
"But the Pop will still stay in San Antonio, like come on. He's gonna leave an organisation that he helped establish, to go and coach a flat earther, and Kevin Durant?"
"[There was a rule meant for KD's foul baiting](https://oklahoman.com/article/3785324/new-rules-will-directly-affect-kevin-durant) but it's not a catch all. There are still plenty of cases where you can get away with it, or at least that's how the refs act"

"At the time the thought was that he would both start at PF and play backup center, filling in as the starting center when Embiid was out. In theory a great fit, in practice the combination of Embiid, Horford, and Simmons was terrible so we had to move him to the bench.   I swear, these are the first five sources that popped up when I googled ""nba free agency grades 2019"":  [WalterFootball: C+](https://walterfootball.com/nbafreeagentsigninggrades.php)  [The Ringer: C+](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/7/1/20677370/nba-free-agency-grades-kevin-durant-jimmy-butler)  [Sports Illustrated: A](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/07/01/nba-free-agency-grades-nets-celtics-knicks-76ers-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving) (this was a grade on all of the Sixers moves, not just the Horford signing)  [nj: B](https://www.nj.com/nets/2019/07/nba-free-agency-2019-report-card-grading-each-teams-performance-how-did-nets-knicks-sixers-do.html) (again, all Sixers moves)  [Bleacher Report: C](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2788638-nba-free-agency-report-cards-for-every-team) (again, all moves)  Not amazing grades, but I tried not to cherry pick, even with these though it looks like an above average move. If you read through the explanations, most acknowledge that he might look rough on the back end of the contract given his age, most just expected him to help the Sixers chances this season."
"I know Luka gets all this love saying he was Euroleague MVP.  Yes he was super young so that speaks to the talent but lets look at previous Euroleague MVPs.  **Player**  * [Anthony Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Parker) * [Anthony Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Parker) (2) * [Theo Papaloukas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Papaloukas)📷 * [Ramūnas Šiškauskas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C5%ABnas_%C5%A0i%C5%A1kauskas)📷 * [Juan   Carlos Navarro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Navarro_(basketball))📷 * [Miloš Teodosić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Teodosi%C4%87) * [Dimitris Diamantidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitris_Diamantidis)  * [Andrei Kirilenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kirilenko) * [Vassilis Spanoulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassilis_Spanoulis)\^ * [Sergio Rodríguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rodr%C3%ADguez)\^ * [Nemanja Bjelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanja_Bjelica) * [Nando de Colo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nando_de_Colo)\^ * [Sergio Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Llull)\^ * [Luka Dončić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87) *  [Jan Veselý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Vesel%C3%BD)  The best players out of that bunch is AK47, and Juan Carlos Navarro. I know the Euroleague gets lots of love on this forum, but come on, not a lists of world beaters.  Compare to NCAA Player of the Year:  * Jameer Nelson * Andrew Bogut * J. J. Redick * Kevin Durant * Tyler Hansbrough * Blake Griffin * Evan Turner * Jimmer Fredette * Anthony Davis * Trey Burke * Doug McDermott * Frank Kaminsky * Buddy Hield * Frank Mason III * Jalen Brunson * Zion Williamson  So if I was to just pick on a random player from each list, I would end up with a better player going NCAA on average.  Lets have a little more fun.  Lets look at HS Player of the Year:  * Dwight Howard * Louis Williams * Greg Oden * Kevin Love * Brandon Jennings * Derrick Favors * Jared Sullinger * Austin Rivers * Shabazz Muhammad * Andrew Wiggins * Cliff Alexander * Ben Simmons * Lonzo Ball * Michael Porter Jr. * RJ Barrett * Isaiah Stewart  So if I'm a GM, and assessing the levels of talent thats what I'm dealing with.  I'll say I thought Luka was 6'4"", based on something I read, so when I heard all the hype I wasn't buying in then, on draft night, I saw how much taller he was than Silver, and I thought 6'7"" that skillset is way different versus 6'4"".  Career trajectory is more like Penny Hardaway's, he is out the gate hot and he will be a force in this league for a while.  So yes in hindsight, Luka was a surefire pick #1, but understand there is a can't miss guy out of Europe every couple years, the pure difference in Luka was he had actual production, and he is 3-5 inches taller than typical player in his position/role in the NBA.  Added layer for Luka not getting hype was Slovenia was left out of International Competitions like World Cup/Championships or Olympic Games where many people in North America would have seen him versus lots of NBA based or experienced players and would have assessed him.  Thats one part his country of allegence and one part just how young he was/timing If its an Olympic/World Cup year and he is 17-19, and he puts on a nice showing and plays well versus say the USA Team, opinions change greatly."
&gt; you'll take the sweep but   Whats the strategy for games 1-4? And why would you skip that just to start talking in circles about whether James Harden does or doesn't get tired? *That's* the level at which Kevin Durant thinks about basketball strategy?
Well he looked like a future Kevin Durant on a rebuilding team. That's what you're supposed to do lol
"Kerr agreed with KD saying he needed to create points on his own deep in the playoffs  &gt;But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over. No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact…  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-right-warriors-did-play-more-iso-against-best-defenses/"
That dude is a clown. His singular purpose in life seems to be defending Kevin Durant. I mean check his post history.
"Dirk is special in that he usually keeps his efficiency come post-season, while some players (e.g. Karl Malone) drop off quite a bit come post-season.  One way to gauge great scorers is to narrow down the list from regular season numbers because there aren't really any players who jump from poor regular season scorers to great post-season scorers. You can choose different cut-offs, but looking at players with multiple seasons at 27 PTS/75 and +5 rTS, you get:  * James Harden (5x) * Adrian Dantley (2x) * Dirk Nowitzki (2x) * Amar'e Stoudemire (2x) * Michael Jordan (4x) * Stephen Curry (4x) * Kevin Durant (8x) * Karl Malone (7x) * Shaquille O'Neal (7x) * LeBron James (6x) * Ricky Pierce (2x) * Wilt Chamberlain (2x)  There are some notable exceptions, like Kareem and Jerry West, but they were usually hyper-efficient on slightly lower volume. Change the cut-offs to slightly to slightly lower volume, but higher efficiency and you'll find them.  Personally, I'd put Dirk around 10. I'd put him behind:  * Michael Jordan * James Harden * Kevin Durant * Shaquille O'Neal * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Jerry West  I'd also consider putting Adrian Dantley and Wilt Chamberlain over him too. They were very much black-holes, but they could score.  The notable person not mentioned above is Kobe, who never reached the +5 rTS mark, but I'd probably put him just beneath Dirk rounding out the lower end of the top 10 scorers list.  So I'd probably have Dirk right around 8-12."
"&gt; No I found one of the most famous instances of him using it   No that’s the only video you have of him doing it lmao, that’s why you posted it. Post more vids of him doing it then?

Only time I found Kobe mentioned? Is that game 7 clip lol."
"Lol, we tried Bogdonovic at the 3, he got completely torched by Kevin Durant and Lebron."
"Please name another small forward that is on the market that you could play less, that can stretch the floor when needed and play servicable defense on Lebron, Leonard, Paul George, Kevin Durant or any of the other elite small forwards.  We don't live in this vacuum where you should just spend that money on Kevin Durant. There is not two Kevin Durants. And it is very difficult to find a small forward with his skill set."
"&gt;then it's not a fucking rip through lmao  ?????????????  Dude it actually blows my mind that you think the term rip through was invented through what Kevin Durant did, **they named it that because of the rip through motion.**  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;why does it matter if he didn't draw the foul? I'm saying he wasn't known for it.   Again, how can you claim to watch Kobe and not know about one of his most prolific crossovers with the ripthrough aka ""swingthrough""? Just because KD's version of a rip through was inspired by it and was elevated to be used solely to draw fouls does not mean the rip through was not used by NBA stars before KD was even in the NBA.   It matters because while Kobe was still doing the rip through / swing through motion in his crossovers, he wasn't purposely trying to draw fouls, but it could draw fouls. Kobe was DEFINITELY known for what people back then would call a swing through.

"What do you mean ""meaningful""? Not everyone can luck into having Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant as teammates lol. How about you judge their actual play on the court rather than the accomplishments they had as a result of having superstar teammates?  T-Mac had an MVP caliber season in 2003, Klay has never come close to that. T-Mac has made All-NBA First two times, Klay has never even made an All-NBA First or a Second Team. T-Mac is a 7x All-NBA player, Klay is a 2x All-NBA player. T-Mac has been a #1 for many years, Klay has never been one."
"This guy called out his teammates in Boston and then did it again this year in Brooklyn.  &gt;Collectively, I feel like we have great pieces, but it’s pretty glaring we need one more piece or two more pieces that will compliment myself, [Kevin Durant], [Jordan], [Temple], [Spencer Dinwiddie], [Caris LeVert], and we’ll see how that evolves.”  &gt; ""The young guys don’t know what it takes to be a championship level team.

You seem to be upset about this dude. Kevin Durant soft no matter how many reddit posts you make.
"Brook holds the Nets franchise record for half the stats in the book so I mean no disrespect here, but that's a problem we'd love to have. Put him on the court and let him attempt threes all night, while not crashing the boards and being a defensive liability.  There are no Giannis stoppers in the league, but by the time the 2021 playoffs come along, Jarrett Allen will be among the best suited to slow Giannis down... and Kevin Durant makes Brook Lopez irrelevant."
"Based on their careers so far, I would say this is what the current HOF picture looks like for active players.  Among active players, I would say the locks are Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Anthony Davis, Kyle Lowry, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Giannis Antekoumpo, and Luka Doncic.   Guys that will probably get in are Kevin Love, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Blake Griffin, Marc Gasol, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Lamarcus Aldridge, Draymond Green, Kemba Walker, Andre Iguodala, and Joel Embiid.   There's quite a few other guys that are too early into their careers to make a judgment on, like Jayson Tatum, Ben Simmons, KAT, etc."

Kevin Durant would make the Hall of Fames hall of fame. The basketball hall of Fame is pretty easy to get in
"Replying to you and /u/reddit_mods_r_stupid; I took the Top 10 Career PPG leaders, removed their 3 lowest PPG seasons, and recalculated their New Career PPG. Harden is still 3rd.

Harden literally averaged 36 in arguably the best scoring season ever 😭😭. He had Kevin McHale as coach for several years before d'antoni. Dwight would play for himself not the team. U put westbrook and durant when they were all like 21 and harden was the 6th man I can't 😂😂. Also hope you realize that harden averaged almost 40 a game on 64 ts% from the start of the season to December with capela. Harden wouldve won with cp3 if he didnt get injured lmfao. Harden has carried scrubs in the playoffs before
"Not really the 11-15 right now is probably Hakeem/shaq, oscar Robertson, Jerry west, kevin durant and steph.and I dont think hes better than any of them even if he wins a championship. Still top 20 though"
Kevin Durant
Has Kevin Durant beaten NBA's darling LeBron so badly that they have to promote the shit out of Harden?
People said the same thing when Kevin Durant was off the court for the Warriors. Talking about how they actually win more games without him. Obviously those people are complete idiots and should be ignored.
Kevin Durant will never have my respect
Kevin Durant has stated that he's likes Caris's game. I hoped the Nets keep him. Loved watching him play for the Wolverines.
Pretty even. But OKC had the MVP of the league Kevin Durant as well.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/05/12/stephen-curry-not-kevin-durant-is-the-golden-state-warriors-best-player/#1af46e3d7b23  This says otherwise? They don't link their data set. I distinctly remember reading multiple times from Ben Taylor and other Cleaning the Glass posts that Curry has better on/off numbers. They played together for 3 years so I'm not sure one year is going to be the best example.
Kevin Durant is the richest NBA player ever?
"Added the numbers and highlighted the top 3 ppg and TS, also you missed Dantley's 82-83 season:      Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 70-71 (31.7/60.6) and 71-72 (**34.8**/60.3)  Adrian Dantley - 80-81 (30.7/62.2), 81-82 (30.3/63.1), 82-83 (30.7/**66.1**) and 83-84 (30.6/**65.2**)  Michael Jordan - 87-88 (**35.0**/60.3), 88-89 (32.5/61.4), 89-90 (33.6/60.6), and 90-91 (31.5/60.5)  Karl Malone - 89-90 (31.0/62.6)  Kevin Durant - 09-10 (30.1/60.7) and 13-14 (32.0/63.5)  Steph Curry - 15-16 (30.1/**66.9**)  James Harden - 17-18 (30.4/61.9), 18-19 (**36.1**/61.6) and 19-20 (34.4/62.5)  Damian Lillard - 19-20 (30.0/62.7)  &amp;#x200B;  Curry, Harden, Kareem and MJ all are ridiculous, but man is Dantley underrated. I guess he was like Booker or Trae who put up monster numbers but get overlooked by their team's shitty records."
"Kevin Durant was right, Kawhi is a system player.  /s"
Reason they didnt make playoffs kwawii is a kevin durant snake and they got trash players in the trade

"oh no you're actually dumb. or 14. just pick a kevin durant flair my guy, people won't judge you. i know you're doing it to avoid being pigeonholed as the KD fan/Bron hater, but you're doing that to yourself."
"I’m not emotional I’m right. I watch basketball and it’s obvious    You wanna ignore everything they did 3+ years ago all the records and all the dominance because it’s been awhile? Alright then just look at last year    No KD/Barnes and no bench but as long as Klay was playing and Curry, Iggy, Klay and Draymond played they were still as good as any team in the NBA and proved it in the 2019 playoffs. Also their record without durant in that run was amazing    You are either a Kevin durant Stan or a warriors hater. I think you’re the emotional one"
Kevin Durant is the best scorer of all time. Harden is not a better scorer than Durant.
"There is a reason Durant chose Golden State, and that reason wouldn’t exist with Harden in Curry’s place as the Warriors wouldn’t have won a title and 140 regular season games in two years.  I don’t understand why you think anyone is saying Harden couldn’t win a title with Kevin Durant, he certainly could. And there is plenty of room to be good enough to win a title and be worse than the Warriors were with Curry and Durant if in fact there isn’t a team with Curry and Durant whom you have to face in the Finals or the WCF."
"Steph is more than just a ""shooter"". Dude when steps on a court literally breaks down every defense and teams are waayyy more wary of him.   I mean they would rather leave Kevin fucking Durant a green light to the rim than let steph play around. If that doesn't tell how dangerous he is, nothing will."

The Nets fought hard. They are going to so strong next year once Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant come back. They also have a clear second or third option with Levert.
"want to put everyone on notice, we have Caris Levert, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Spencer Dinwiddie next year."
"I don’t understand, why do the Nets need Kevin Durant when they already have Tyler Johnson?"
"my bad, I accidently pressed follow and liked all her pics, my phone trippin - Kevin Durant - Damian Lillard"
"And the Nets didn’t have Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, Deandre Jordan, Wilson Chandler, Taurean Prince, Nicolas Claxton, and Jamal Crawford"
"“As time went on, I started to realize I’m just different from the rest of the guys. It’s not a bad thing. Just my circumstances and how I came up in the league. And on top of that, the media always looked at it like KD and the Warriors. So it’s like nobody could [give] a full acceptance of me there.”  Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2019/10/31/20941852/kevin-durant-left-warriors-free-agency-explanation-nets  So yea not the only reason but a reason"
"When the Nets were going to beat the Thunder but Stephen Graham fouled Jeff Green on a three-pointer with just seconds left in 2OT.  Green made all three, tying the game and sending it to 3OT, where the Nets lost.  I think this was early 2010-2011 season, when the Nets were coming off of their 12-70 season and the Thunder were coming off of their breakout season that put them among the NBA elite. So it would've been a pretty big deal for the Nets to beat them.  EDIT: [Found the highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPZ7Q_k5B7I). Kevin Durant actually wasn't playing.  Also edited to correct that it was already 2OT when Graham fouled Green. Green's free throws tied it and sent it to 3OT."
"I really don't think they are as different as people think. Winning is important, making your team better is important, but narrowing it down to just championships isn't really fair. Is Tony Parker better than John Stockton? Do you really think Kevin Durant is a better for those two championships in Golden State?  I do believe there is such thing as ""losing"" and ""winning"" players, meaning some guys are very talented, put up nice stats, but they don't produce a lot of wins. Limiting it to championships is just to narrow minded and has led to this superteam problem."
"While I agree with you, if there are two other guys I wouldn't want to play in a game 7 if I'm lebron, one is kawhi Leonard, and the other is Kevin Durant. Kawhi has been downright incredible since the 2017 playoffs."
No he's not. He can guard Lou Williams straight up and just because he gives up size to PG and Kawhi doesn't mean he's completely useless against them.   I remember Memphis' Tony Allen used to guard Kevin Durant fairly well despite being half a foot shorter
"Correct. I'm saying he's not a center because he's out on the arc shooting threes, spotting up in the corners, taking the ball in transition, and posting up. If I had to place a name on it. Stretch 4.   The NBA is becoming position less.   I think that sums it up. But I'll put my thoughts below:   Just because he's the biggest out there doesn't mean he's ""a center"".  When Kevin Durant was the tallest GSW and guarded the interior on certain rotatioms he wasn't ""a center"". His play style has always shown more 3 than 4 or 5 on offense.  Look at the pacers to me they have two 5s out there. Sabonis and Turner really are better post ups with good passing and spot up shooting. They don't put the ball on the floor and slash. Defensively the guard the paint and don't move well. That's two 5s out there in my opinion.   Idk where I'm going but I guess I'm saying you gotta look at play style and what they are doing. Bol bol is much more a stretch 4 to me than a center. Even when he's the tallest he isn't doing ""center"" things for me"
I mean Kevin Durant exists so yeah maybe 3rd best
"Kevin Durant’s last game played was when he was 30 years old. When Kevin Durant plays his next game, he’ll be 32 years old."
"Well I think adding weight would stress his joints and bones more.   I think he's fine for a 4 or 3 (lmao of him playing 3). Maybe a 5 he'd get beaten and bruised.  Look at players always having knee and ankle issues. (Bynum, Greg Oden, etc).  Kevin Durant, Brandon Ingram, have been injured but hasn't been career or honestly that devastating. If this was football I agree, but this is BBall a game I love, not practice."
You clearly have no clue how physiology works. Read [here](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/nba/story/2019-06-11/nba-finals-kevin-durant-achilles-injury-warriors-free-agency) to inform yourself a little bit.  Steph buddy taped his dislocated finger the entire playoffs.
Crazy how PJ Dozier looked like the 2nd coming of Kevin Durant against us the other night
"I mean if I was Kevin Durant I'd think I am the goat too, he is still fucking good"
Is this the guy Kevin Durant impersonates
"Player of the game: Chris ""Kevin Durant"" Boucher"
"I’m not sure what sort of data you’re looking for but the entire reason given by the NBA for creating the supermax extension was because of the incredible disparity in off-court income potential a star player can get by moving to a major market. The challenge folks have with this is that they see players in small markets making money via endorsements and assume that its roughly equivalent to what they could make in a larger market. Some anecdotal examples of why that’s not true - Durant’s sponsorships upon moving from OKC to the Bay Area, Lebron’s Space Jam 2 movie being green lit for production around the time he came to LA, Anthony Davis’ Ruffles sponsorship the day after he was traded from NoLa, Melo’s Nuggets sponsorships vs the time he was with the Knicks.   It is true that an elite player can make a lot of sponsorship money even when playing in a smaller market. But they’ve historically made substantially less than what they’ve been able to make in a major market. This is why the NBA created the supermax exception. It’s nickname is literally “the Kevin Durant” exception."
"It is crazy that one man, LeBron James, became the greatest basketball player in current history of the game. Kevin Durant is correct."
The ole Kevin Durant OOB whoopsie doodle
"Not really. Curry because of his limited size can be kind of shut down. Cant shut down a big wing like lebron kawhi or kd. Even kerr said this. Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."""
Ah Steph Curry and Kevin Durant: washed up veterans
"I understand. I like CJ a lot but fact of the matter is dame does everything better. Your roster is filled with guards and Carmelo is not cutting it at forward. Hes a good temporary solution but it's unsustainable. If the blazers really want to compete dame needs someone like Kevin Durant, or a forward with good ability to create for themselves but can also defend."
"Kevin Durant does this, and we all know how good of a shooter he is. Paul George does this. Carmelo does this. It don’t matter, when you’re not getting any momentum/confidence on offense, it’s always gonna take a hit on your shooting percentage"
"[Well, here's **my source**, but I guess the downvoters have more insight than GSW beat writers.](https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/1301553690315161600)  ""Steve Nash working individually with Kevin Durant was a post-practice scene about 7-10 times per year in Durant’s GSW tenure — typically every preseason, for a week midseason, near start of playoffs"""
"LeBron has multiple playoff and finals games where he has scored zero in the 4th. And no they were not blow outs. He is the most protected basketball player of all time bc any criticism leads to the blame of his teammates, coach, fatigue, age, or something. This is why people get upset people call LeBron the greatest bc if they would just say he’s a great player no one would care. But the greatest player of all time does not score zero points in 4ths or OTs multiple times. And if anyone wants to say he has won championships to uphold his greatness debate, the man has lost more finals than he has won. And don’t tell me if Kobe, Magic Johnson or MJ could choose their team and stars to team up with that they wouldn’t get more rings. We saw Kevin Durant pick a squad in the warriors and look what happened. LeBron is a great player, but his greatest accomplishments are longevity and stats. He isn’t the best. Don’t say he’s the best. Say he is a great player and no one will talk sh*t.  P.S. - Two of his rings he can thank for the greatest finals elimination game clutch shots in NBA history. The greatest finals shot of all time by Ray Allen and a top 4 greatest finals clutch shot by Kyrie in game 7."
"He was a position coach and consultant for the Warriors from the 73-9 season until now. I guess that is actually only 1 title but still. He coached Kevin Durant so if Kevin Durant thought he was a bad coach, Steven Nash wouldn't be the coach"
This league is so much better without Kevin Durant

""But Curry was unanimous MVP""...MVP is a joke nowadays, otherwise Jordan would have been MVP almost ever year he played in the league, LeBron would have more MVPS, Kobe would have more MVPS, Harden should have won at least 2 more MVPS, etc. MVP for NBA is the best player in the most wins team.   ""Curry has 3 championships, one without Durant""... he also had a stacked team with a deep bench. Like I said in my post, swap Dame for Steph and you won't even see a dropoff, and probably would see more championships for GS.  Problem with Curry is that he can't finish at the rim, and can only drive to the rim because people respect his shot so much. When his shots off, he's just another player on the court to help spread the floor. He can't score at will like what everybody on this board believes.  He's lucky he got injured this year too excuse himself from making the playoffs. Won 1 game last year when he played, and got blown out the other 4 games he lost.   ""He had a terrible team!"" How come he only averaged 20 PPG then? Shouldn't a superstar average 25+ PPG for a bad team that needs their superstar to score? I thought he was going to FEAST now that Durant was gone?"
"Would Giannis really go to Miami or Toronto after back to back losses to both teams? I know Kevin Durant would, but surely Giannis would want to go to a team in which he can beat his rivals and lead a team of his own to the finals."

There are so many people of color that were also selected to do bigger and greater things in this world!!! People shouldn't forget that.  And also congrats to Steve Nash.

The NBA would be renamed the KDA (Kevin Durant Association).  Nobody would wanna play against him all the players and coaches would quit to go work in factories and cubicles.
"This was the pinacle of reporters propaganda milking the BLM movement to a fault.  The whole thing is for police to stop killing black folk, and for all races to have equal opportunities, and the media has milked this shit so much that some are turning against it!!!  I mean, ""White Privilage"" the hiring of HALL OF FUCKING FAMER Point Guard Steve Nash to coach a team?!?!  This is just absurdly irresponsible and dangerous, i despise every person that agreed with it, because it shows that you don't THINK for a fucking second.  There's no way in this universe this hire happens without the approval of ""Mr. Social Justice movement"" Kyrie Irving and person who has worked for YEARS with Steve Nash, Kevin Durant.  Both gentelmen are black.  So they're exercising their ""White Privilage"", is that what ESPN is trying to tell me?  Such a load of bullshit, taking a noble cause and milking it for veiws and clicks."
Kevin Durant still lives on this planet
"Stephen A sinking to a new low. People love him and i have no idea why. He is incredibly obnoxious and now turns what should be a great day for Steve Nash into race baiting bullshit.

"&gt;I think micro ball is going to evolve tho as big men refine their games tho  big men have to use more energy to run. Smaller guys can sprint up and down the court and wear down the bigger guys legs. Smaller guys can steal the ball from big guys easily, since they don't get their hands as low when dribbling. Big men get stripped a lot more than guards.  Running that much causes knee, ankle, foot, and back problems for big men. This is compounded by big men needing to cover extra distance. 3-pt line -&gt; 3 pt line is a lot less running than paint -&gt; paint. If small ball becomes the norm, expect pace to increase even further. The running is going to kill big guys. Plenty of them wash out of the league by 30 as it is.   The big man of the future will play like Kevin Durant or Dirk, not Shaq or Dwight."

He was hired because Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving told Nets management to hire him.
"54 TS% is not extremely bad, what are you talking about? That’s higher than playoff league average TS% that year.   And 57.5% in those years are 3-5% points HIGHER than “average.” What the hell are you talking about?   And Curry’s efficiency dipped when Durant was on the floor. The most efficient series of Durants GSW tenure was 2017 Finals, where his TS remained the same with and without Curry. And I already said, stop with the open shot bullshit. Kevin Durant routinely takes lower amounts of contested shots than most stars in the league, even in GSW.   His open shot percentage in 2017 playoffs was 27%. In the regular season 36%.   Curry’s? 60%. Brons ? 47%. Durant his entire career has taken tough shots because of his lack of spacing. Warriors have an all time great spacing, yes. But the Thunder had an all time bad spacing. Most stars at this time fall in between.   And, again, no. That isn’t a far cry from Harden or James career wise, especially when you factor in Durants early years where in a lower TS NBA in general.   And no that isn’t their record.   All you are doing is reiterating false narratives my guy."

"Nash got hired because of Kevin-Durant-privilege.   KD wanted Nash to be the head coach, so Nash is the new head coach.  Good for Sir Charles on calling reporters out for such a cheap take on Nash getting the job."
The clip I say of that buffoon he said explicitly states Kevin Durant wants Steve Nash as a coach and then goes on to list the qualifications of every black coach that Kevin Durant doesn't want coaching him.
"damian lillard and kevin durant have reacted to skip bayless more in the last 2 years than lebron in his whole career. he doesnt fall for the bait. yes he cares about attention but its attention from fans and social media not ""experts"". this is acutally rare."
Steve Nash was hired because he's a highly respected former player and more importantly already had an established relationship with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"The ""circumstance"" insinuated by the article is Nash being close with Kevin Durant, who spent time training with Nash in GSW and likely had a big hand in the decision. No one is saying Nash only got the job cause of race."
"The article isn’t even criticizing the Nash hire. It discusses how it’s likely Kevin Durant had a hand in this decision (the article cites this as an example of ""black power"" because of his influence on an important team decision). It also delves into how some black coaches like Gentry and McMillan are called ""player's coaches"" as a detriment, and how some black coaches feel some of their non-black counterparts have been worse coaches, but have managed to keep their jobs.   Regardless as to whether you agree with the sentiments or not, it in no way criticizes the Nash hire, so I'm not sure what you are talking about.   The article says this on the Nash hire: &gt; Nash’s basketball acumen, his career accolades and potential connection with Irving make it a logical hire, especially given how the Nets didn’t respond to Kenny Atkinson, who was fired shortly before the NBA shut down.  &gt; Had Durant pressed for Tyronn Lue or Mark Jackson or the countless, qualified Black coaches who are waiting for their first opportunity or a second chance, or a better chance, one would think the Nets would’ve acquiesced to his wishes."

"Simply doing ""The Math"" doesn't provide any context as to why most coaches are white. The point is about Nash getting the job without head coaching experience. He got it because hes hof pg Steve Nash and he has a great relationship with Nets Superstar Kevin Durant. TJ McConnell isn't getting a head coaching job with no coaching experience."
"Kevin Durant will always own the weakest move in professional sports. By a sizable margin, too"
I don't think anyone saw Kevin Durant joining the Warriors after losing to them either.
It was something about Kevin Durant getting an app to respond to twitter haters for him iirc. The jokes ranged from mediocre to embarrassingly bad.
Kevin Durant cares though lol
"This perfectly describes what Kevin Durant did and why it is so critiqued. We cannot compare the careers of superstar athletes to those of us who work regular jobs. We like to sit on here and discuss legacies and player rankings, and kd going to the warriors the way he did has to come up in the discussion when we talk about his legacy, and that’s not even getting at the fact that for years we knew who was going to win every year. we knew nobody had a chance at beating the warriors and if Durant doesn’t injure his Achilles it’s possible that would still hold true.  What he did was an unprecedented, unparalleled move that may forever be held against him in terms of his legacy."
Kevin Durant gets what Kevin Durant wants.
"&gt;he doesn't want to head coach   He does; the wording of him ""resisting"" it seems to be more about him having wanted to wait until his kids were more grown so he didn't miss their childhoods, but he either changed his mind or something of the nature of the job offer made him think he'd have time to spend with the family (perhaps that he would have less of a workload as Vaughan helps him learn and of course gets some credit to parlay into his eventual HC gig somewhere).  He already has a place in NYC, in Soho, and runs an annual charity in Central Park, so there's ties to the city.  Here's is a relevant quote:  &gt;""The coaching itch was always there. In a way I kind of kept it to myself to give me the freedom of not being on the radar of coaching expectancy,"" Nash said. ""I've always known in the back of my mind that I'd love to do it. But what was holding me back in many ways was my family. I just really wanted to preserve that time with my kids that I've earned from the good fortunes of playing professional basketball and have as big of an impact on their lives as I can.   &gt;""What I realize as well is this is a family move and a family decision. It checks all the boxes in terms of pursuit and passion for me. But for my kids to see another part of the world and a historic city like Brooklyn is a great opportunity for my family, too. You learn from travel. You learn from change, being pushed into a new environment and taken out of your comfort zone.""   &gt;I just said I was ready,"" Nash said when asked how he sold himself to ownership and management. ""I said I wanted it and shared my vision and my methodology. What I bring to the table and how I want to influence the group the more I see it going forward. Those are details and talking points that every coach has. I hope they really value the approach. But at the same time a big part of it is my history, and having trust in the way I see the game and coach the game.   &gt;""Sean Marks and I played together 15 years ago and played against each other internationally for 20 years. There is a relationship, understanding and conversations over the decades. That has to be a factor as well.""   &gt;Nash has had an offseason residence in New York City for years in Tribeca and is a big fan of the area.   &gt;""I spent enough time in Brooklyn; not a ton of time,"" Nash said. ""It's one thing my family and I are thrilled for, the opportunity to live in the famous borough. We value its history, its cultural fabric and its mentality. It's exciting for my family. I spent many summers in New York City and went to Brooklyn to play soccer games and stuff like that. That is the exciting part, is getting to live in an incredible part of the world.""    https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29801419/steve-nash-satisfies-coaching-itch-eager-reconnect-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-nets"
"Ranking him above LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, and Kevin Durant was always comical. I’d probably also pick James Harden but I think that’s more debatable."
It's also going to be nearly impossible to develop a statistically significant sample size because -regardless- of the race of the candidates most of these jobs 'shortlist' two to three people period and don't have 'open interview' processes at all.   NBA's the league that's least worried about it because within the next five years the problem will go away as the legacy older white coaches with all the credibility and experience retire and are replaced more and more with former players (which are predominantly black).  Nash is an outlier because he's a rare former star player that happens to be white. Chauncey is gonna get the exact same treatment as Nash; so would Chris Paul if he decides to coach after he retires as well.   They're also ignoring the fact that Nash's -personal relationship- with Kevin Durant was a factor in this; doesn't that speak well to the racial harmony of the NBA that a black superstar player doesn't care about the color of his head coach at all?
"Curry also played with Kevin Durant for 3 years and the entire offense doesn’t hinge on him taking half the team’s shots. If Steph wanted to drop 40 a night, he could; they just wouldn’t be winning championships. Like Harden and the Rockets."
Nick Young  Henny Smith  Micheal Beasley  Iman Shumpert  Brandon Ingram  Gilbert Arenas  Kevin Durant  The list goes on  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: Don't know how I could forget Lamar
"KD and Nash were friendly pre-GSW, Nash helped get him to GSW, and then they did a lot of 1-on-1 training https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/05/kevin-durant-steve-nash-and-a-hall-of-fame-friendship-that-brought-them-both-to-the-warriors/"
"The Warriors don't have a great record without Steph, can Kerr coach without him? Plus he had KEVIN DURANT when Steph was out games. If you're going to raise that question about Lue why would you not about Kerr?   Coaches build systems around their star players, especially guys who handle the ball. Ofc they aren't going to do well when they're missing. Also no one should hold his short stint as the HC for the  post-Lebron Cavs, that roster is pure dumpster fire."
Kevin Durant did what he felt was best for Kevin Durant why can’t people get over that. Sure we all knew the Warriors were going to win when he was there but it was beautiful basketball that I felt was a joy to watch. Big deal he didn’t come to your team. Take this from a Magic fan you’re team more than likely never had a chance to land Durant or win for that matter so why not enjoy watching beautiful basketball and then get on with life
So is Kevin Durant yet he's prone to turnovers off doubles. Giannis is a much better passer than AD and he's not even that good passing off doubles
Kevin Durant is angsty.
Sounds awesome -Kevin Durant
those comments...  Steve Nash was last person KD called before going to the Warriors:  [https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/05/kevin-durant-steve-nash-and-a-hall-of-fame-friendship-that-brought-them-both-to-the-warriors/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/05/kevin-durant-steve-nash-and-a-hall-of-fame-friendship-that-brought-them-both-to-the-warriors/)
"That isn't really Kevin Durant. Trust me, I can't say why..."
"Do you not remember when it was Rockets vs. Golden State Warriors and Kevin Durant literally played it out of bounds and the ref was just watching and made no call? Yeah, I'm positive that shit continues to go on, and I don't doubt that the NBA itself has their hands in it."
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2416840-kevin-durant-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-thunder-for-entire-career  &gt;“I love it here man. I love my teammates, I love the city, I don’t really think about anywhere else,” Durant said in an interview with Revolt TV this week (via Michael Scotto of The Associated Press). “I hear it all the time, don’t get me wrong, and once you hear it you’re kind of like...But for me, I love staying in the moment, and I’m one of those guys that would love to stick it out with one team my whole career.”    that's just over one year before he left. anything can happen."
"&gt;Decisions which many of us would make exactly the same or similar if we were in his position.  Well thats just not true. Never has a player before left in the way that Kevin Durant did. No other player left their team after they were up 3-1 on the greatest regular season team of all time to go to that team that just beat them. No MVP player ever actively decided to join the definitive best team in the league with the current MVP on its roster.  What Kevin Durant did was unprecedented. His agent begged him not to do it. Nobody thought it was going to be a great move except for the Warriors and Kevin Durant.  Its not like Durant's options were bad either. He had the entire league laying down offering everything to court him. He just had to not pick the team that had won 73 games!!  So no. I dont think many of us would make the same decision. Because no one else in NBA history has made that move. And just about every media personality and NBA player came out against the move.   Kevin Durant took the path of least resistance and will be labeled for it for the rest of his life, and defenders of him like you that try to compare an NBA position to: &gt;a work contract expire, and decided to move to a warmer climate to accept a well paying offer to work with really nice guys for a few years who are great at their job, and then after that contract decided to go to a big city to work there for a bit  Are just being ridiculous. Kevin Durant's move wasn't just him relocating to a warmer client with cool coworkers. It drastically affected the make-up of the game for the fans, owners, and players. Kevin Durant put such an unfair advantage with the Warriors that most teams packed up and left when he moved. Many teams went full on tank to avoid the buzzsaw that was The Warriors with Steph and KD.  Kevin Durant hurt job prospects of other coworkers across the league, put out a terrible product that fans were forced to stomach and forced many owners to have to reevaluate their plans and completely retool just to have a chance.  So yeah, Kevin Durant's move to The Warriors was lame and should be called lame til the end of time."
You cannot act like steve nash is just some white guy. This is insanity. Do you know who steve nash is? Is there a black woman out there who was a 2x nba mvp and is ALSO good friends with kevin durant?
We are all Kevin Durant on this blessed day
"My guy let’s cut the bullshit, we’re both Kevin Durant on burners"
"I saw this coming from a mile away, everything is somehow connected to race nowadays. How about the fact the Kevin fucking Durant probably wanted Steve Nash as his coach?"
"So you think Kevin Durant is not an NBA player? Because he hasn’t been on the floor, hasn’t fought for rebounds, no three’s, not even one free throw for the nets."
"Disagree, right now if I (obviously I'm NBA superstar Kevin Durant) want to play for a team they can all basically offer me the same amount except for the home team but lets disregard that. Lets say the Wolves really want me, well what can they offer me over the Warriors, they cant offer more money, they can't offer a better team so why would I ever choose them over the Warriors? Obviously I choose the Warriors and we win 73 games one year and win a couple chips in the process. Well what if the Wolves offered me 2x the money the Warriors could, sure I'm no longer competing for a championship but that's a LOT of money like a LOT. Suddenly the choice isn't so obvious.  This has a ripple affect over the whole league, suddenly guys like Lebron are getting 2x other current max players who are a world apart in terms of skill, now teams with the cheaper stars can get better surrounding casts and also compete for a championship. The allure of big market isn't necessary if you have the allure of big $. Suddenly there is skill in roster building over, just get 2 of the best players in the league on relatively cheap contracts."
"So he has inarguably top 5 longevity ever and a top 15 peak ever but he’s only “top 15?” How does that work? The early 90s wasn’t even his peak as a player. He generally underperformed in the postseason quite often, especially in the early 90s. In the mid-late 90s he added range to his jumper and it made him a more complete offensive player and generally a better postseason performer. Posting just regular season PPG and RPG barely means anything. I don’t think anyone argues that 1987 was Michael Jordan’s peak, so I don’t see why the early 90s would be Karl’s peak. I can list 15+ players that have equal or close equal peaks to Malone, in no particular order:  1. 1990-91 Michael Jordan 2. 2008-09 LeBron James 3. 1992-93 Hakeem Olajuwon 4. 1999-00 Shaquille O’Neal 5. 1976-77 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 6. 2003-04 Kevin Garnett 7. 1966-67 Wilt Chamberlain 8. 1961-62 Bill Russell 9. 2015-16 Stephen Curry 10. 1985-86 Larry Bird 11. 1986-87 Magic Johnson 12. 1965-66 Jerry West 13. 1963-64 Oscar Robertson 14. 2007-08 Kobe Bryant 15. 2008-09 Dwyane Wade 16. 2006-07 Steve Nash 17. 1976-77 Bill Walton 18. 1990-91 David Robinson 19. 2016-17 Kevin Durant 20. 2016-17 Kawhi Leonard 21. 2002-03 Tim Duncan 22. 2010-11 Dirk Nowitzki 23. 1975-76 Julius Erving 24. 2014-15 Chris Paul 25. 2002-03 Tracy McGrady 26. 1989-90 Charles Barkley 27. 1982-83 Moses Malone 28. 1989-90 Patrick Ewing  Karl Malone may be better than some of these players but I don’t see how he is definitively better than 13+ of these guys all at their peaks. It’s at least very debatable."
"No, because Kevin Durant has a literal contract naming him an NBA player, and Steve Nash has *never been on a coaching staff.*  You thinking everybody in player development is a coach is like a small child pointing at every vehicle on the road and saying ""TRUCK!""  Like no sweetheart, that's a bus."
"So if Kevin Durant and Kyrir came out and publicly said, “We are the ones that wanted Steve here.  We went to ownership and asked to bring Steve here.”  Would that change your mind, and if so, how is that different than them signing off on the hire if it want their idea?"
In the same exact way kevin Durant isn’t an NBA player
"Bro im not saying steve nash isnt a cool guy, or a decent hire... Kevin durant endorsing the hire, has nothing to do with the fact that steve nash had an easier path to the job than actual people that have done and succeeded at the job.. and that is privelege. All im saying.."
"All SAS has done on first take is talk about how qualified Steve Nash is for the job, and he’s also acknowledged the relationship between Nash and Durant, and still..he insists.  You don’t think Kevin Durant has anything to do with the hire?"
You won a championship against a weakened Warriors team that was missing Kevin Fucking Durant lmfaoooo keep being proud of that asterisk championship. We had to play 5 games against KD and only 1 without him and all our role players choked while Harden and CP3 balled out in game 6. You got to play an *entire series* against them with no KD.  Thunder shouldn't even make the playoffs? They had the best record in the league since Thanksgiving and were the 5th seed what are you smoking?  Celtics in 4.
[Yep they’ve been friends for a while and Nash convinced him to go to the Warriors in 2016.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/05/kevin-durant-steve-nash-and-a-hall-of-fame-friendship-that-brought-them-both-to-the-warriors/)
"Steve Nash, Kyrie Irving, Kevin durant all on the same team... Their winning the ring"
"&gt; [Spears] New Nets head coach Steve Nash has the ""confidence"" of Kevin Durant and the backing of Kyrie Irving after having a relationship with both for years. On KD, Nash told @TheUndefeated: ""He’s one of the greatest players I’ve ever seen and to have his confidence is really important.”  &gt; https://twitter.com/marcjspears/status/1301519536034844672?s=21"
"&gt;""Kevin's a thoughtful -- I don't want to say complicated -- sophisticated,  he's continually pushing himself and searching for whatever it is that's out there that's going to fulfill him and excite him,"" Nash said.  That's okay, Steve, I'll say it for you: Kevin Durant is complicated."
Yup.  https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/05/kevin-durant-steve-nash-and-a-hall-of-fame-friendship-that-brought-them-both-to-the-warriors/
"Lol. This is fucking hilarious.   How many titles has Budenholzer won?   Uhh, he’s won 4.   Yeah, those don’t count.   Give me a fucking break. He’s a 2x coach of the year for Christ’s sake.   Budenholzer was with Popovich from 1996 to 2013. Think he might have learned something in the nearly 20 years he spent in San Antonio working with Popovich?    Let’s also be real fucking honest about Kerr. . . He’s a good coach. No one denies that. . . . But he’s also had guys like Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Draymond Green and Kevin Durant on his teams his entire coaching career. It’s nearly impossible to look bad with that many great players. Kerr didn’t have any of those guys this year. . . . And went 15-50. . . .   Also. . . Calling him a cold blooded killer?? Where the fuck did you get that from? Kerr hit one huge shot in his career. What did he do besides that to earn that moniker??  Let’s examine your rationale . . . Budenholzer can’t claim his title because Popovich was the head coach and he wasn’t . . But Kerr can claim his titles even though he played with Michael fucking Jordan and Tim Duncan and was strictly a role player on his title teams. In what world does that make sense??? He was never the Star. Jordan was the fucking cold blooded killer, not Steve Kerr.   Just say you made a stupid point and move on. The more you dig your heels in, the dumber you look."
"It won’t get any easier in the East. There’s Boston, Toronto, Miami, and a Brooklyn Nets team with (presumably) a healthy Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Caris LeVert, and Spencer Dinwiddie.  Plus, we’ll see what Indiana and Philly are able to do with their rosters and how they fill their coaching vacancies."
And Curry's bargain contract is a huge part of why the Warriors were so dominant and why they could add Kevin Durant to a lineup that went 73-9.
*Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
westbrook has more playoff wins with kevin durant lmfao  he has 6 in 4 years since he left and 1 as the best player on his team

Dort isn’t a big. Didn’t Sam Presti draft James Harden and Kevin Durant too?
Kevin Durant on the other hand...
"James harden and muscle chestbrook sure make a great team. They should sign that kevin durant guy, imagine how good they'd be"
This very sub told me that James Harden was a better scorer than Kevin Durant
Kevin. Durant.
If Jordan played against Durant and people said this comment he would have made it is goal to outshoot Kevin
"Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, DeMarcus Cousins"
"In context the quote is clearly about natural talent, Kerr said   &gt;“I would say Kevin (Durant) is ... when you factor in everything, size, speed, athleticism, I think he’s the most talented basketball player I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kerr said.  I think maybe talent is a poor word, but in context the quote doesn't really seem like a dig at anyone else like Steph/MJ/etc. I'm sure all of those guys agree that in terms of height, speed, and athleticism they'd also love to be the most athletic 7 footer of all time.   With those as the factors I think the only person to take offense to this might be Wilt..."
This playoffs will be the end of good guy Liannis.  He will now enter the Kevin Durant phase of his career but he’s 1/100 the player of KD
"Dude, the rockets have always had a standard center like Capela except for the tail end of this year when they went full micro ball.  And are you really trying to discredit the shooting around Curry when 2 of the shooters are Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Literally two of the best shooters of all time..."

"Answering my own question. The lowest scoring franchise in the playoffs is the New Orleans Pelicans at 4630 points. So if we look at nba players that have more than 4630 points, that answers my question.  https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career_p.html  LeBron James 7048    Grizzlies 7045    Michael Jordan 5987    Hornets 5853    Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 5762    Kobe Bryant 5640    Shaquille O'Neal 5250    Tim Duncan 5172    Timberwolves 4813    Karl Malone 4761    Pelicans 4630    Julius Erving 4580    Jerry West 4457    Tony Parker 4045    Kevin Durant 4043     Players one through seven are on the list."
"Out of curiosity, I looked at the last 30 years to find teammates who both finished top 7 in MVP voting and didn't win a championship. Top 7 is kind of arbitrary, but Top 5 was a little too tight and once you get past ~7 then there are some real outside MVP candidates that maybe only had a handful of votes.  -  * **2016:** Russell Westbrook (4) and Kevin Durant (5)  * **2014:** Blake Griffin (3) and Chris Paul (7)  * **2013:** Tony Parker (6) and Tim Duncan (7)  * **2011:** LeBron James (3) and Dwyane Wade (7)  * **2004:** Kobe Bryant (5) and Shaquille O'Neal (6)  * **2003:** Kobe Bryant (3) and Shaquille O'Neal (5)  * **1998:** Tim Duncan (5) and David Robinson (7)  -  That's actually more than I was expecting. I think people saying Stockton/Malone are kind of overrating Stockton. He was a very good player for a very long time but never a Tier 1 star. His highest finish in MVP voting was 7th one time and that was only with 3.3% of the voting share."
You underestimate how sensitive Kevin Durant is. Have you paid any attention over the last 3 years?
Yeah because that’s Kevin Durant lmao. This is andrew bogut
Draymond wasn’t an all star but he played like one in the finals. Without KD they got back to their ball movement system and Draymond was a lot more effective and almost averaged a triple double. Klay also had a career series and steph averaged 30 ppg. The Warriors literally had no excuse to lose that series OTHER than the fact that they just lost to a better team.    If Durant played then yes they probably would’ve won but no shame in saying that. That team was built to three peat easily. They needed Kevin Durant to beat the Raptors

When Durant addressed the media, Irving’s remarks were relayed to him, and although he appreciated his good friend and new teammate’s attempt at protecting him, **refuted the notion that his decision to take the floor during the NBA Finals had anything to do with anyone other than himself.**  “When I went down, it felt like everybody wanted to put their arms of protection around me, from people I didn’t know to my best friend in Kyrie,” Durant said, notably referring to Irving as his “best friend.”  “I felt like everybody was real protective of me around this time.

"You realize Giannis is still two years younger than KD was when he won his first ring? Even Durant couldn’t lead the Thunder to a championship as the #1 guy no matter how well he played. When he won with Golden State it could be argued he wasn’t the leader of that team, even if he was the most talented.    But you would never, ever see me question if Kevin Durant is a superstar."
"1. Steph is one of the more disciplined defenders at his position. He's done a fantastic job of funneling LeBron into help defenders on switches and keeping him on his weak side. At one point in the 2018 finals, LeBron had isolated on Steph 26 times and had *zero points* to show for it. Steph isn't a ""stopper"" but he plays smart D within the scheme, which is more than can be said about many PG's in the league.  2. Adding KD to the team doesn't mean Steph gets replaced with KD. Steph was still on the floor, still getting targeted. Maybe the Warriors wanted to replace Harrison Barnes with a more competent help defender. *That* might have been a good take. Yours isn't.  3. With regards to Steph constantly being attacked on defense: as a coach, I would hope you would do the same thing when the other 4 players on the court are Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green.

"""Fuck Kevin Durant. - Lil B  \- Michael Scott"
"Yeah, imagine projecting someone else's entire future based on what Kyrie ""the world is flat"" Irving, Kevin ""can't win with those cats"" Durant, and Paul ""impregnated a stripper while cheating"" George ended up doing"
"yeah imagine losing to the Big 3 spurs playing some of the best team ball ever, then the MVP when your team is out injured, then losing to the most winningest team ever+Kevin Durant. That should be a cake walk"
I don't need his GSW titles to justify the fact that fewer than 14 people have ever been born who were better than Kevin Durant at playing basketball in the NBA.
"For those of you unaware of the background, during the 2014 Western Conference Semi Finals there was a big narrative that CP3 locked down Kevin Durant. To date some Chris Paul fans say that CP3 locked down KD during this series. But footage easily refutes this narrative"
1 - LeBron James  2 - James Harden  3 - Stephen Curry  4 - Kevin Durant  5 - Kawhi Leonard  6 - Giannis Antetokounmpo  7 - Anthony Davis  8 - Luka Doncic  9 - Nikola Jokic  10 - Damian Lillard
No one is mentioning that he has Luka higher than Kevin fucking Durant?
1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kevin Durant (Based off 2018-2019 season) 4. Kawhi Leonard 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. James Harden 7. Anthony Davis 8. Nikola Jokic 9. Damian Lillard 10. Luka Doncic
I put mine in order  1. Lebron James  2. Stephen Curry   3. Kevin Durant   4. Kawhi Leonard   5. James Harden   6. Nikola Jokic   7. Giannis Antetokounmpo  8. Luka Doncic   9. Anthony Davis   10. Damian Lillard
"1. LeBron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. James Harden 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo 6. Luka Doncic 7. Tony Davis 8. Kevin Durant (probably #2 or #3 if he comes back 100%, but that's unlikely) 9. Nikola Jokic 10. Damian Lillard"
"I don't think anyone is suggesting Kawhi vs prime LeBron.  Prime Kawhi vs 35 years old LeBron is not that far fetched if we talk about on the court performance.  Remember AD leads the Lakers in every major stat in post season.  Kawhi is a two way finisher, asking him to be primary play maker put too much of a burden on him, and impacted his offense.  LeBron gives you play making out of box, so a team's floor is much higher with LeBron.  This was the first year Kawhi tried to build and lead his own empire, and he failed pretty miserably.  Load management on top of not being vocal, he never controlled the locker room which is a huge part of every championship team.  Mortgaging Clippers future for Paul George is also a terrible pick.  Kawhi should stick to his role as one of the greatest knights in today's game.  He just doesn't have what it takes to be king.  LeBron is more than a player at this point.  You are taking on his entire empire, Lakers as a brand over Clippers, Klutch Sports which gives him first dib on free agents . . . Uncle Dennis is not in the same league and Kawhi should just trust the logo and stop making awful roster decisions.  Then again, maybe he is content with playing in his home town with his own team?  He asked for Kevin Durant of all people, who was going to be out this year.  Maybe two rings later on a chronic injury, winning a title is no longer top priority?  ESPN has him at top 20-30 all-time range and I think he already overachieved as a middle of first rounder."
"Absofuckinglutely they were the underdogs, you do realise they’re going against a 73 win team who had just signed fucking Kevin Durant?"
"Sweep seems like a stretch but I don't see why it wouldn't be impossible. While that team did end up starting 1-3 against the GSW, they did ended the series by going 3-0 against one of the greatest teams ever in NBA. They definitely have it in them.   Even with the addition of Durant in 2018, we've seen lebron give that even more stacked GSW team a real run for their money in game 1 before Jr Smith. Klay, Green, Steph, and Durant all played at least 45 minutes that game. Lebron was the only player on his team to play 40+ minutes. Imagine Kevin love was the only player other than lebron to score more than 10 points on that team and yet pushed 4 of GSW's best players to their absolute limit."
Kevin Durant is most definitely a rival and has outperformed him in multiple finals.
"Youre comparing chris bosh to kevin durant who had completely different games. Bosh was an elbow in player, sure he could shoot threes but he was by no means a perimeter player.  Go watch his games man."
"1. Blake Griffin: Seeing his rookie season highlights is what first drew me to the NBA  2. Damian Lillard: No explanation necessary  3. Boban Marjanovic: Not gonna lie, he's my favorite player in the league who isn't a Blazer  4. Stephen Curry: I feel like even now we are already forgetting how dominant he was  5. LeBron James: Impossible to talk about the decade without talking LeBron  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo: He does things that no other player can do. To me the only player with cooler highlights is Blake Griffin  7. CJ McCollum: As a Blazer fan I promise to NEVER let the legacy of CJ McCollum fade. Best player of the decade to never make an All-Star team, easily.  8. Kevin Durant: Like LeBron, you can't really talk about the decade without talking about Durant. Honestly he's never been that exciting to me but he has to make this list  9. Kawhi Leonard: Another player I begrudgingly add to this list for the same reason as Durant  10. LaMarcus Aldridge: I can't talk about that amazing 2014 series against Houston without going over Aldridge's legendary games 1 &amp; 2  edit: I can't believe I left out Jusuf Nurkic. Put him above Durant and after CJ  edit2: Put Linsanity on there"
"Kyrie Irving, Jrue Holiday, Caris LeVert, Kevin Durant, DeAndre Jordan.   Garrett Temple, Joe Harris, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Taurean Prince, Nicholas Claxton."
Kevin Durant
"What is his ceiling then? I think he figured out how he can thrive in this league but I also don't see anything other than marginal improvements to his game to make it more complete a la Jimmy Butler. I think you have a little bias against Butler but also bias for Siakam as well. I can think of 15 players I would rate over Siakim easily. Keeping in mind that this has been Siakms breakout year and needs to come back just as good or better in order to knock a few off the list in my mind.   In no particular order LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Joel Embiid, Russell Westbrook, Nikola Jokic, Kyrie Irving, Blake Griffin, Karl Anthony Towns, Chris Paul, currently Jimmy Butler and I would rate Kemba Walker over him currently and Jrue Holiday for his elite defense over Siakim. You could even make a case for Jayson Tatum being ranked over Siakim with their similar stats and role on their team and how that team performs.   That is just my opinion obviously and I think I listed almost 20 but yeah. You could try to make a case for the 15-25 for now but I don't see Siakim challenging Lebron, Durant, Harden, Curry, Leonard, Irving, Davis, or Giannis for a spot to just be in the top 5 conversation. To think at any point of the season Siakim was a top 5 player and has transcendent talent like any one of these guys shows an incredible bias."
"The Clippers have taught me to never root for another team again, especially a superteam. If this was 2k, you'd win a championship every time because it's just simulation and fails to account for the Clips' actual weaknesses of coaching, cohesiveness/chemistry, mentality, and leadership. I know they are gonna suck again, because there's 0 accountability in that FO. Why does Doc Rivers get to keep his job when other coaches, who have been fired, have fucked up less with less talent?         The 3-1 Warriors played horribly by all means. But:      1. At least they were 1 game away from a championship. The Clippers choked in what should have been 1/4 their way to a championship.        2. The Dubs were going against prime Lebron fucking James, and props to Jamal and Nikola, but the only one that I see consistently coming back like that is LBJ himself. Not only that, the Cavs had a more talented roster that played just as hard as Denver.         3. The Dubs took full accountability for the loss, and improved the next season by adding Kevin Durant (and working on their schemes and shit). Even with KD, down 3-2 against a team specifically designed to beat them, the Dubs played hungrier in the WCF and won 2 straight championships."
"He took a Clippers team, whose best player was Lou Will, to 6 with the Kevin Durant Warriors."
Anyone who is 7 foot tall and can shoot can waltz into the top 10 and probably the top 5. If that person is named Kevin Durant then the odds are even better.
"On the subject of off ball movement, Off ball ability doesn't mean as much if you don't have a good passer to fascilitate you and find you when you get open.   It's hard to gauge where Curry's at in the top 2-6 range because we've always seen him on historically great teams and his recent success has been alongside Kevin Durant who outperformed him when side by side, and the rest of the people near the top are just better defensively. Alternatively, in the Rockets series, Harden and KD both outperformed Curry. When Curry didn't have KD, he wasn't all that spectacular against the Raptors, other than game 3 which was a 20 pt loss,even when Klay was playing. He had the 7th highest 3pt% in the series, which is underwhelming when that is his biggest strength.  He's top 5 but it's hard to place him. 2016 Curry is easy to place as top 2, but that was a long time ago."
"Yeah good for them that they hijacked a team with Kevin Durant on it, I'm sure that helped a little."

"Its fine if you win, laughable if you lose.  And it was a self-inflicted wound.  There would be less clowning on the Clippers (slightly less) if they simply focused on themselves, and rebranded their team as upcoming and hungry.  Nobody can dispute that.  But instead they prematurely declared themselves the new rulers of LA and Kawhi the new King of LA, the Clippers went championship or bust very early and said they'd be ready in the playoffs.  If I had been the Clipper's PR manager, I would have taken a less sexy, more boring, but more realistic and less likely to bite me in the ass PR campaign (and that's better, I'll explain below).  My campaign would have been to sell the Clippers as no longer a doormat (which they weren't), hungry for the challenge of the upcoming season (which they were), ready to show the world what their new team can do (which is, again, accurate), and the first step in a new generation of Clippers (Kawhi &amp; PG's 2+1 contract notwithstading, that's how I'd sell it).    There's less chance this type of campaign would create the kind of visceral hatred around the league and have owners calling up Windhorst clowning on the team.  Sure, your response might be that it doesn't matter what people think, any news about the Clippers is good news, they made money, got attention, yadda yadda yadda.  And you might be right, but we're sitting here right now while sports analysts crown Kawhi a full tier below the top superstars, unable to close when he's the lead guy, calling PG a choke artist, the Clippers franchise cursed.  You don't think that also has real world implications?  When KD recently said that [he didn't want to be the savior of the Knicks,](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/kevin-durant-choosing-nets-over-knicks-i-didnt-want-be-savior-new-york) that was proof that a franchise's woes are not ignored by the players and can affect where free agents go.  Shitty owner, terrible front office, bottom-feeding team, but its still the marquee franchise in that city.  The Nets recently moved there and don't have that great of a history themselves, but KD and Kyrie chose that team.  In their eyes, even though the Knicks were the sexier pick, they still got most of the benefits of being in New York without having the albatross of that franchise draped around the necks struggling to tread water.  The Clippers' continual failure over and over does and will have an effect on the minds of future free agents.  There will be people who say that even if the Lakers are worse in some point in the future, they still don't want to be seen as a Clipper.  A PR campaign that backfires will add to that.  A more boring but humble campaign will not.  The legacy of guys like Kawhi and PG is dragged down because they failed and because they failed as Clippers.  Guys like Lemon Pepper Lou, Trez, Rat Bev, will all be looking at smaller contracts because of the way they lost.  New Balance is now tied to a joke of a choke artist instead of (if this was a different PR campaign) a guy in the first year of a rebuild whose best days are upcoming"
"5 years is a long time. Warriors have come a long way since last June.   2019 Warriors Starting Lineup:  Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Boogie Cousins   2020 Warriors Starting Lineup:  Ky Bowman, Alec Burks, Eric Paschall, Glenn Robinson III, Willie Cauley-Stein"
Lakers fans are pretty much Kevin Durant. LeBron James and AD but they have the hardest road lol.
Depends how kevin durant klay and curry come back. Then also see how those players do in the playoffs. There's also giannis too and aging lebron. So many variables I couldn't say.
&gt;it will turn out to be an epic disaster seeing as how they have no picks going forward. Its not looking good right now -- remember what they gave up for PG13%. This has the makings of Brooklyn 2.0....  The Nets missed the playoffs for 3 years and now they have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
"Not Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant?"
"MPJ’s size and ability makes him a Kevin Durant like threat if he can put it all together. He’s got a good shot, but he’s not very good with decision making or moving off the ball."
"&gt; as he's fucking LeBron James or Kevin Durant   I know we're on r/nba but you dropped the **if**  That said, agreed!!! I do think they'll run it back and hit the WCF next year though."
"&gt;but he was out due to his injury  Oh no, a player was out due to injury! Can that even affect a series! Like...the 2017 Western Conference Finals....  you're wrong btw Kevin Durant played minutes during the 19 NBA finals"
Kevin Durant doesn’t exist?
"Draymond shot 39% on 3's one year, which is a sample of 82 games - does that make him a better shooter than Kevin Durant (career 38% 3Pt shooter)? Wild things can happen in a small sample size, so let's pause on any hot takes."
"Yes, the narrative that he could've had more rings had KD not joined the Warriors also totally ignores the fact that the 73-9 Warriors were up 3-1 in that series, Draymong got suspended for a key Game 5 at home and Bogut got injured. Steph also averaged a putrid 22/4/4 and it took a herculean effort by both LeBron and Kyrie to win that.  Even if KD had joined another team or stayed in OKC, nothing guarantees that the Cavs would be able to beat a healthy without suspensions 73-9 Warriors in a rematch, in fact i would bet they don't.  People just ignore all context and say LeBron's Finals losses don't matter and the 2016 ring has more value, spoilers: They do matter and the ring has the same value as any other ring.  Dirk Nowitzki beat LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden in his road to a championship. Nobody says that his ring has more value and nobody has him all-time ahead of Kevin Garnett, who was clearly better than him.  LeBron can win this year's ring and it still doesn't change the fact that Michael was a flat out better player, was more individually accomplished (MVPs/DPOYs, etc) and had less failures in the playoffs. The GOAT debate doesn't exist and it's only a product of recency bias.  I'm old enough to remember when people thought that the late great Kobe Bryant would end up being greater than Michael after his 5th ring, this shit literally will always happen when an all-time great gets rings, but when you analyze it deeply, Michael still owns them."
Im not Kevin Durant and I couldnt agree more
"I would be mad at everyone involved. I hated the Kevin Durant warriors with a passion, and I would hate the Kawhi Leonard Lakers just as much. It's 1 thing to team up with another star, but to put 3 top 10 players on the same roster takes the excitement out of it.  There isn't even a draymond on the team to piss off kawhi and send him packing."
"Top tier NBA stars:    Lebron James     Kevin Durant      Steph Curry      ~~Kawhi Leonard~~          Look, my wallet and I were rooting _hard_ for the Clippers since Papa Curry is out but I never once agreed that Kawhi is better than Lebron. Now I don't even want to hear that he's better than Steph or KD. Say what you want, but Steph has shown up when his team was down 3-1, likewise with Lebron, and KD has shown up for big games, being the Dubs best player when down 3-2 against a team specifically designed to beat them, and was the only OKC Thunder against 2016 game 7 against Golden State. Kawhi and PG had 3 chances to close out the series and did...not. The three I mentioned played against some killer teams, Steph and KD playing against a team _specifically designed_ to beat them. Jokic and Murray played out of their minds, but come on, the Nuggets are not the 73-9 Warriors or the 2016 Cavs, although if they win the Finals, Jokic is in that tier of players I listed above _and_ this is automatically the greatest playoff run of all time and I will be able to say that I witnessed all of it live during some of the more pivotal years of my life and personal growth and during a historical, worldwide phenomenon. What a world we live in."
"Expected? No. But he has a very high ceiling. He has a ton of potential, and he has proven that he has a beautiful jump shot with a high release and good range, along with the ability to rebound and contest shots at the rim.  I don’t think there’s a lot invested in him. He was a mid first-round draft choice with a locked-in low salary for a few years—and he could turn out to be the second coming of Kevin Durant."
"Yeah well he left Pacers and also tanked his value and had his camp claiming that he would only play in LA a la Kawhi, he shat the bed with OKC and when he became a free agent he didn't even give the Lakers a meeting, then he shat the bed come playoffs again and after re-signing with OKC and saying that that was his home, he once again forced a trade to the Clippers (not that OKC didn't clearly win that trade but still). And after all that shit he spends the year talking as he's fucking LeBron James or Kevin Durant and he plays for the 96 Chicago Bulls, acting as if he can coast till WCF and then win when he really wants to, and in the way to shitting the bed ONCE AGAIN he fucks with Dame Lillard OF ALL THE PEOPLE and mocks him for being eliminated. YOU, FUCKING PG, AFTER HE WAVED AT YOU AFTER EMBARRASSING YOU LAST SEASON, shit talking the guy who refused to form superteams and kept fighting even with a team full of injuries.   He deserves all this slander and much more."
"Quick question, when have the Warriors with Kevin Durant ever been dominated for a game at the beginning of a series and then came back and won in 5 games? Can you think of a series?  Don't worry, I will wait for your answer"
Kevin Durant.
"Maybe they can draft players like James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Durant. Can you imagine a team with all three of these players?  Draft, ELC, trade for picks, draft, ..."
Can't win legit? Like a 73 win team signing Kevin Durant?
The worst thing you can do on /r/nba is be on a team good enough to make the playoffs because as long as you dont win a title and blow their expectations out of the water youll get slandered. This is comical.   Rudy is a 2X DPOY. He would dramatically raise the floor of many teams. Plenty of teams could use him. He's a multiple time all NBA center and people talk like he's out of vogue in the NBA today because he had some issues handling Kevin Durant and GSW in pick and rolls or that juggernaut 2018 Houston team.
You gotta be trolling right? I’m blind to think Kevin Durant is better than Steph? Really?  You can’t be serious... KD literally went to the warriors and became their #1 option. KD has consistently been better than Steph from a career standpoint as well... man this is Kevin Durant we’re talking about.
G1: 39 min G2: 32 min  G3: DNP G4: 42 min G5: 42 mins G6: 32 mins  It’s crazy that recency bias is turning the raptors championship into “GSW we’re broken and only lost cause “...”.  Klay was 3-1 down before his injury in a close game he had already played 32 minutes in. Yes Kevin Durant was injured and that took a lot from the Warriors but no way were the warriors team scrubs. They had Steph Klay Draymond Iguodala for a majority of the series and had just came off winning the WCSF without KD at the end and swept the WCF without KD.
No one said this.  Brandon Ingram was called the next Kevin Durant
"Steph also played with both Klay Thompson AND Kevin Durant for 3 years.  2 finals wins came with the KD super team. The other one happened when LeBron's second and third best player were completely out for the series.   And LeBron STILL dominated every statistical category for both teams. The one he did win against Steph, he was down 3-1 and stormed back against a 73 win team.   So basically, when they were evenly matched, LeBron won.  Stop the blasphemy lol please."
"That’s not true   Kevin Durant has talked about how much he liked Seattle. Plus there are a ton of players from the region: Zach LaVine, Isaiah Thomas, Dejountay Murray, Jamal Crawford, Avery Bradley, Joe Harris"
"stop overreacting. if the warriors didn’t want to be crippled by two injuries, they should have signed a real bench instead of kevin durant. the loss is fully their fault and the raptors beat the team in front of them. with a bench above the level of the worst in the league, and 5 games of thompson, the series could go either way"
But he's not LeBron James or Kevin Durant either. He's not Steph Curry. He can't be top 3 for me let alone the best player.
Didn't Kevin Durant say PG13 was better than Kawhi a year or so ago?
"A better comparison to your point would be Allen Iverson..   Rockets had a legit shot at a championship if CP3 stayed healthy. Kevin Durant would have the same exact story if he didn't decide to join a historically great team.   The only person i've EVER seen will their team to a championship virtually alone was Lebron with the 2016 Cavs, and he still had Kyrie. Even Jordan needed help.  With that said i'm not defending Harden. He does have a lot of issues in playoff games and I think he already missed his best shot at a chip with cp3."
"hahahaha. ok. and then the Zaza incident, the Kyrie and Love injuries. Etc. Not to mention Kevin Durant. All his rings are asterisk rings."
"Steph won back to back mvps and led his team through the west in both of those years. Beating Kevin Durant, James harden 2x, lebron, and Anthony Davis in those runs. Stephen curry is more of a winner than Kevin Durant."
Dudes thought Kyle Kuzma was the next Kevin Durant LOL
"1. LeBron James  2. Kawhi Leonard  3. Steph Curry  4. Luca Doncic  5. James Harden  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo  7. Nikola Jokic  8. Anthony Davis  9. Damian Lillard  10. Joel Embiid  If Kevin Durant was healthy I'd slot him in at fourth above Doncic. I don't think he'll ever get back to that MVP level, though."
Yeah then KD drops like 50 on Pay Bev’s head in the most nonchalant way.  “Y’all know who I am. I’m Kevin Durant.”  Clippers fans actually cite that 4-2 Warriors be sleeping series as a chance at being a legit contender. Won’t admit the Warriors were just not giving a fuck but hey at least they made the semis!! 5 picks and two good young players for a guy who averaged like 17 ppg and like 3-4 turnovers in the playoffs. Ooooof
And Kevin Durant won the MVP in 2013-2014.  I would rather have him than any of the above.
"What? Kevin Durant is a liability on defense since when?   And no. Kevin Durant is better than Kawhi, he would’ve torched the Nuggets even in a game 7."
"Kawhi was also playing through the quad. He could barley move by the time the finals started. THAT specific excuse you just said about klay does NOT fly lol. Lowry also had a broken finger, pascal’s hamstring that he injured in then philly series was *still* bothering him as well. Raptors were not perfectly healthy either so aside from the injuries preventing players from actually being on the court, the warriors have no excuses.  Klay was playing great, but was a -2.2 in net rating. The raptors were outplaying the warriors even though klay was going ballistic. I feel like that says something about the raptors. And you keep mentioning how the warriors almost forced a game 7...the raptors could have just as easily won game 5 and ended the series 4-1. Warriors barley escaped alive out of that game and klay was healthy for all of it.  Raptors outplayed the warriors without Kevin durant that series. If klay didn’t get hurt in game 6 he might have forced a game 7, but based on the way the teams played with everyone healthy (aside front KD) the raptors should objectively have been the favorites because, quite frankly, even with klay going ballistic they were STILL the better team in terms of how they played during that series.  Raptors benefited from warriors injuries, but they also outplayed them that series period even when klay was playing. Which again, was the vast majority of that series.  Don’t listen to this talk about raptors beat warriors without KD and klay. They outplayed the klay warriors that series and deserve props for that, even if we don’t 100% know the outcome if klay didn’t get hurt."
They never hold anyone to the same standard as LeBron and it’s not even close. Kevin Durant who has been right behind LeBron for years was said to be better than LeBron during his run with the warriors but was still never held to the same standard.
Kevin Durant doesn't elevate his teammates much either tbh.
The year you tanked for Kevin Durant.
&gt;we beat the odds  Aka Kevin Durant joined the team not even a month later
"Fair. Kevin Durant said on JJ Redicks podcast last week he directly didnt like the concept of bright lights, *'the mecca'*, Madison Square Garden as basketball on broadway and Brooklyn appealed to him for being lowkey and matching his personality. Kawhi must be somewhat similar here."
Damn KD missed all 7? Or did you. Good thing they still had Kevin Durant
"He didn't go to the Kevin Durant school of being a bitch.  Kawhi won a ring and there's an argument or at least there was that he was the best player in the world.  The last thing his rep needed was to play 2nd fiddle to LeBron with another top 10 player on the team.  He wants to win the Clippers their first ring as the undisputed star of the franchise, didn't work out this year but it's easy to see why he chose the clippers"
Kevin Durant.
"There are levels to being a leader. You cant compare leaders when their supporting casts are comprised of Kevin Durant, Klay, Draymond vs Kevin Love and others"
Enjoy now. Kevin Durant will lord over you all next season.
Kevin Durant and the Clippers squad from last year would have probably beaten this nuggets squad in 5. Kawhi is not a top 3 player in the league
Kevin Durant was a +6 in less than a quarter of playing time. He was rushed back from injury shot 3/3 from 3 and the warriors were easily the better team.  This would not be a competitive series if he played more than a quarter of game time.
"[Kevin ""Kevin"" Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3-d47zzvMo)"
Didn’t he try recruiting fucking Kevin Durant? Lmao
Yes because everyone predicted Kevin Durant tearing his Achilles and Klay injuring his hamstring then ACL.
Curry wasn’t the reason they won. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook lost that series more than the Warriors won it. Even Andre Iguodala said the Thunder were the better team that year.
"In the playoffs their motion option would come to a screeching halt when teams like the Rockets/Cavs/Raptors would play switch all defense and slow the games down to a crawl.   There, they would hand the ball to their ultimate safety net Kevin Durant which carried them over the Rockets both years and why they lost in 2019 without him."
These guys + Kevin Durant might take us to the Western Conference Finals.
Don't even compare Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to Kawhi Leonard. Those two would never blow a 3-1 lead.
Curry lost to fucking lebron james after carrying his team down 3-1 against fucking kevin durant. Kawhi almost lost to luka and then lost to Murray. Smh
"I think 3 top 10 players of all time almost sounds more impressive.  Jordan, kobe, and Shaq is probably the best three of any coach ever and easily.  Take Steve kerr for instance.  Kevin durant, steph curry, and klay Thompson.  They are arguably all behind those other three.  And two are mvp level.  Doc rivers has cp3, garnett, and pierce maybe for the third.  Again 3 HOF players who are all a clear tier below the Jackson 3 over there."
Kevin Durant
1. Dirk vs the heat in the finals 2. LBJ soloing the 73 win Warriors who added kevin fucking durant... lol still shook
Stephen Curry  Ray Allen  Kevin Durant  Chris Bosh  Tim Duncan
People just hate KD and it makes them confuse KD the person with KD the basketball player. As a player and basketball mind he's super elite. I'd definitely trust Kevin Durant before any r/nba nephew lol
" ""I was telling one of my friends, Rich (Kleiman, his agent), who's here, we were watching Game 7. Well, as it started to unfold, it was, 'No question, no way could you go to this team.' And I was just like a kid, like, in a candy shop. I'd get wide open 3s, I could just run up and down the court, get wide open layups. I was basically begging him. I was like, yo, this would be nice.""  \- Kevin Durant on the possibility of joining the Wariors, the team that just crushed him and OKC in the WCF."
"It would end up being someone really polarizing, like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Pat Bev. Just out of nowhere, Pat Bev puts up 50-20-15 averages for the next 10 years"
The Kevin Durant Warriors saga presents everything wrong with NBA fans today.   KD didn’t receive one double team in those two Finals with the Warriors ? Do you not understand how amazingly false and ridiculous that sounds? I could literally YouTube a highlight video of KD in the Finals and present multiple examples of him getting double teamed.   But the narratives have really taken over.
It wasn't the same team when KD was there. They leaned *heavily* on him to advance in those years.   They also won a championship*. Then lost to the same team the year afterwards.   They were the ones that begged Kevin Durant to come to Golden State and when he delivered yearly in the playoffs (literally carried them at times) he gets shit on for coming to the Warriors. It's ridiculous from a neutral outside perspective.
He's Kevin Durant until he proves that he isnt
"Pretty sure I heard Kevin Durant say he thought winning in golden state would make him better than lebron. So yea, somebody was trying to take something from lebron"
"He probably will after saying he was sick of playing with athletes in OKC and being the only guy who can get a bucket. But he also said this last September after leaving GSW.   &gt; So me? Shit, how you going to rehabilitate me? What you going to teach me? How can you alter anything in my basketball life? I got an MVP already. I got scoring titles.  &gt; ""The motion offense we run in Golden State, it only works to a certain point,"" Durant said. ""We can totally rely on only our system for maybe the first two rounds. Then the next two rounds we're going to have to mix in individual play. We've got to throw teams off, because they're smarter in that round of playoffs. So now I had to dive into my bag, deep, to create stuff on my own, off the dribble, isos, pick-and-rolls, more so than let the offense create my points for me.""    https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-says-he-realized-he-was-different-from-rest-of-warriors-still-doesnt-trust-thunder/"
"The person who would have handed him a ban for that even said that was not true, so I don’t know where you get your information from. Competitive drive is making do with what you have and overcoming the competition. If seeking out the best opportunities to win by stacking teams was in the spirit of competition, then Kevin Durant would have the ultimate competitive drive. At the end of the day though, I get your point. I still have Jordan as the GOAT but I don’t agree with the people pretending like that can’t or won’t change. Like I said in my original post, Lebron doesn’t look like he’s slowing down and if he keeps doing this for a few more years and is still a solid starter into his 40’s like I think is possible, there shouldn’t be a question who the GOAT is at that point. I was telling a friend earlier, I have my fingers crossed to see Lebron still playing at like 42 with the full gray beard like Cuttino Mobley still killing everyone on the court."
The Nets are going to steamroll you guys next year. Can’t wait for all the nephews on this sub to pull a 180 once they remember Jayson Tatum is in fact not better at basketball than Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant, the first player I ever watched, I made my jumper like his, took his FT routine, wore his shoes until the air bubble burst, I just thought he was so cool. Skinny king like me succeeding in a league I was told was only for the biggest and strongest, but he is a toothpick out there killing everyone. I look up to KD like a hero"
"basketball, will be much better with kevin durant healthy. period"
"I'm assuming his 3 best seasons were his three all NBA first seasons  15, 16 and 19  But sure, let's say it's 15, 16 and 17 or 18. He has similar accolades still to all those guys I listed. So no, you're in fact wrong.  Especially because what year did he have a ring as the main guy? He was not the main guy in 17 or 18. He was 1b to Durant's 1a. Or did you forget about him playing on the same team as Kevin Durant?"
"Kobe Bryant.   Honorable mentions LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade, Lamar Odom, Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis."
"Kevin Durant has a very intersting case compared to those players and, at least over the imo 2 greatest of those, Moses and Dr. J, he would still need a few good years in the NBA.  When Luka is remotely close to Durant's accomplishments, we can discuss this question."
riff on https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/kevin-durant-nba-free-agency-announcement
"This is a stupid take. Those warriors teams were going nowhere without KD in the playoffs. He completely took over.   I understand people hate Kevin Durant, but wow. This sub never fails to amaze me."
Kevin Durant didn’t receive on double team in the finals with the warriors. It’s easier with the 2 best shooters arguably of all time.
Cleveland was better than 2016. But GS traded Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant. It was never going to be close. Revisionist history is running wild around here.
Kevin durant wasn't trying to go for the 3?
"^ Look, it's Kevin Durant."
"&gt; It is playoff hoop. How ridiculous is it that Kevin Durant, one of the best scorers ever, was not being treated as such by a defense?   Not at all ridiculous. Durant is pretty unguardable. If Shaq had the ball up close, players automatically foul him. No, it's not a defense, it's just literally giving up on the play and letting Shaq's horrible free throws decide the game.  It's called a gameplan. Different players, and different players in different teams, require different strategies. If you're gonna whine about it, stop watching basketball."
"I really dont understand whatever point youre trying to make.   It is playoff hoop. How ridiculous is it that Kevin Durant, one of the best scorers ever, was not being treated as such by a defense? He rightfully killed people like that. But no other scorer of his caliber has ever seen such lax defense in the playoffs. And it is because Steph was taking that defense away from him."
"No one is diminish Kevin Durants talent, it’s the fact he took the easy route is the problem. That was Steph Currys team and that was a team that had already won without him. Durant is a great player, but he took the easy way. Let’s see how he does in Brooklyn."
Kevin Durant was a bus rider on the way to the sandwich shop. Durant is more than a Hero.   Mama there goes that man.
Because he’s Kevin Durant.   You know who he is.
You mean the teams that weren't remotely as good even at full strength? Dwyane Wade was a shell of his former self after 2012. The Heat at their best *with* LeBron James weren't as good as Golden State was before Kevin Durant joined.
Outplayed. LeBron was a monster in both finals series. I realize Kevin Durant played out of his mind as well but it was more of a wash.
"&gt;Davis’s postseason averages of 28.2 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.3 blocks per game are pretty spectacular. He’s one of just seven players in league history to exceed 28-9-3-1-1 during a particular playoff run, along with LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Durant, Patrick Ewing and Karl Malone. Add in the requirement of shooting both 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from beyond the arc (on multiple attempts per game), though, and the list narrows to just Davis and James.   Damn this duo"
LeBron James.  Kevin Durant was killing the league up until he got injured last postseason.
"Tier 1: Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Kawhi Leonard  Tier 2: James Harden, Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Giannis Antetokounmpo  Tier 3: Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid, Jayson Tatum  Players in each tier are in in no order"
Kevin Durant is the most efficient scorer on the most stacked team in history
"1: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry  2: James Harden, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Anthony Davis  3: Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Joel Embiid"
"Tier 1: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Luka Doncic  Tier 2: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid  I’d put Kevin Durant in Tier 1 if he comes back anywhere close to as good as usual."
"Yes, talk about Lebron’s defence when he can’t even guard Jason Terry, let alone try to even guard Kevin Durant.   And my point is, Phil couldn’t accomplish that without a good team. What’s so difficult to understand about that fact that no one would be saying that Phil Jackson was a great coach unless he won with both MJ and Kobe? You guys are just crying for Lebron to have a coach with multiple championships. Maybe stop making excuses for Lebron, stick with a coach, and win instead of crying for a HOF coach, you could literally make one if you allowed him to coach and to be recognised from winning.  Like I said, Bron + majority of core players leaving/DNO = lottery. Yes, the old better at everything argument, but yet, still more excuses when can’t get it done. All of a sudden the better a rebounds, assists, stronger, faster, etc. goes out of the window during the finals when he loses right? Joke.  Clown-like argument. Same argument could go for MJ, he dominated everyone to the point many HOF couldn’t get a ring, or even reach the finals, that it made the journey look easy. West is weak? Who’s he playing in the finals now then? You’re clown arguments against MJ could be said the same for Lebron. And Lebron is such a strong team leader he reaching the finals just to lose? Stop with your participation medals. Let him take responsibility if he was such a great leader, he don’t need you clowns make trash excuses for him. Lebron better off without you stans crying for him.  At the end of the day, Michael didn’t go join an already accomplished franchise team, he never melted down during the finals, and you’re comparing Lebron’s eastern conference opponents to a HOF-stacked Celtics and Pistons team and acting like the West were garbage teams. It’s funny how current and former NBA players believe MJ is the GOAT, whereas you supporters and the media keep making the same bogus arguments for Lebron that he doesn’t need."
"I figured that the Warriors gained even more hatred with Kevin Durant joining the team. After all, they ""ruined the NBA"""
Because LeBron James is clearly better than Anthony Davis and because the rest of this Lakers team is a joke compared to Golden State's roster outside of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant
Curry was even worse than Kawhi against the rockets for 5 and a half games last year the difference is curry had kevin Durant to save his ass and Kawhi had Paul George
Kevin Durant
"I think the ""if LeBron was in the West he wouldn't have.."" is a terrible argument against him. Pending how things shape up Friday, he not only made the finals but can potentially win the whole thing. But as you said let's say this year is the exception. If he was in the West because the West is so tough wouldn't he also have better teammates? LeBron on a team with Dirk? On a team with Tim Duncan? with James Harden? DeMarcus Cousins, Dame Lillard, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis before he got to LA, Steph Curry. Does he go 8 straight years, 10 total I think? Maybe not, but Kobe didn't. Tim Duncan didn't. But he's competing. He's a threat every year."
"He was never first team. Not once.   Bird is currently number 3 because Larry Bird does not do one thing better on a basketball court than Kevin Durant.   What defender did Larry face that was ever as good as Kawhi Leonard, or Draymond?   Tim Duncan is a 15 time all defensive selection. I absolutely believe he would handle Mchale.  He is a better player than Larry Bird. He is a more complete player than Larry Bird   The 86 Celtics also played in a league with far less talent than their is today."
being a big is literally all about size and length 😂  Kevin Durant is a almost 7’
"Doesn’t even like Lebron that much, but defends like a fanboy and continues to provide more excuses.   With Phil and Pippen, they weren’t even accomplished till they started winning with Jordan. LeBron has to join an accomplished franchise with a player who had a chip already along with another franchise player. Tell me, who was Phil and Pippen before they started winning? You only knew Jordan and his teammates because they won, for LeBron, you gotta give him excuses and trash his teammates to validate your points, forgetting he played with All-Stars.  And old stars? Magic was 31 when he retired, Isiah was 30 when he lost to Jordan in 91. If they’re considered old then Stephen Curry, James Harden and Kevin Durant must be old and retiring as well. I think by old teams, you were referring to the Spurs and Boston Celtics.  Yeah he won 2016, but then they lost the motivation suddenly to stay on top right? Being the juggernaut team that everyone targeted was so easy for him after winning right? I remember Jordan doing that 3 times in a row... twice I might add."
That's just him...  And are you Kevin Durant? Do you know him personally? Did he ever tell you the exact reason?   GTFOH with these stupid takes
"You’re own players don’t value those rings lol. In fact , Kevin Durant left because he didn’t feel happy or joy after he won them."
"&gt; There is no Warriors  You mean the Warriors LeBron beat in 2016? Because KD is gone now.  &gt; Rockets weren't the same team they were  So? Clippers are better than they were. Teams get better and worse every year.  &gt; Kevin Durant didn't play basketball/moved to the East  Okay? And Luka ascended to superstardom and teamed up with Porzingis.  &gt; Clippers were supposed to be that team to challenge them, but they shit the bed.  Yeah and the Lakers took out the team that beat them.  The West is still a gauntlet, just because LeBron is beating *different* teams doesn't mean it's now easy."
"Except it isn't anywhere close to the same western conference. There is no Warriors......Rockets weren't the same team they were......Kevin Durant didn't play basketball/moved to the East. You had weaker teams, and teams that were young and never did it before. Clippers were supposed to be that team to challenge them, but they shit the bed.   All this being said, Lakers would probably still be where they are regardless. Great team, able to get mismatches everywhere with there size. Led by Bron and AD.   Don't sit there though and act like Bron went through the West gauntlet lol"
Hell Warriors might have even won if KLAY had stayed healthy. The fact that you can lose a player like Kevin Durant and still be arguably the best team in the NBA really shows how ridiculous that team was
"Kevin Durant is elite at all of those things too, and he also has the 3 pt shot in his game   Jordan was the best scorer relative to his own era but his game didn't age that well"
"I don’t think people understand how much the league has changed since MJ . Superstar free agent movement was unheard of in the late 90,s . Like if Karl Malone , Charles Barkley joins the 1993 trailblazers  would MJ have 3-peated ....... probably not . Those who say that a unrealistic super team . That is the league we’re watching now since Kevin Durant joined the golden state warriors."
All Chandler Parsons has to do is turn into Kevin Durant to be worth his contract
"You had 2 moments of bad luck, and Draymond more than earned his suspension. Bogut was unlucky, but he's no all-star. Barnes playing badly is something that happens. Curry got hurt, but he was fine enough to drop 30 on OKC. Maybe he wasn't 100%, but he was pretty decent.  2019 was horrible luck, no doubt, but it was bound to happen at some point.  &gt;First off to win any championship you need to catch a lot of lucky breaks  Not when you add Kevin Durant to a 73 win team. You didn't really need any breaks."
"&gt;Curry can’t drive like Harden  [False](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/2/12/18221183/steph-curry-warriors-2019-all-star-game-charlotte). I’m sure Harden could also play off-ball like Steph, but yeah maybe his shooting percentages wouldn’t be as high. From the article I linked:  &gt; A component of Curry’s success is his supporting cast: Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant constantly attract defensive attention, which opens gaps for Curry’s drives from beyond the 3-point line to the basket. **Even in 2013-14, his first season as an All-Star, he scored 1.1 points per drive, which is a number that Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Mike Conley, and Kemba Walker have hit zero times since that season. Since ’13-14, Curry is just one of five players—along with Durant, LeBron James, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard—who has scored 1.2 points per drive more than once. Curry is about as lethal scoring at the rim as he is launching from the logo.**"
"The stuff that gets upvoted on here is wild. Kevin Durant was the best player in that series while also being probably the best Harden defender on the Warriors.   The Warriors were being forced out of their motion offense, and the scapegoat became Kevin Durant. The fact that anyone could look back on that series and describe Kevin Durant as “bad” is absolutely reading way too much into a false narrative.   He was the best player in that series."
OG = Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"Are you serious, the only difference is one was an established team. Just because KD stacked a team better doesn’t make it not comparable. Lebron was talking about winning 8 titles with that Heat team before a game was even played, he knew what he was doing. Kevin Durant is on record saying Lebron paved the way for his move. He figured, if people could forget about the decision and look past Lebron stacking a team in Miami after he had won a couple rings, they could do the same thing for him in Golden State. Everyone said KD “broke the league” yet Lebron tried to have a team this year with AD AND Kawhi and just gets a pass because Kawhi decided against it. It’s two sides of the same coin man."
"You are right, outside of Kevin Durant in 2019, LeBron James has been the best player in the league for each of those seasons, and he's only won 4 times."
"&gt; No, we’re going to stick with what we know, and what we know is winning basketball.”  and let me tell you, what winners we are and what a genius i am.  you remember that time we beat the team with 2 of its 3 best players out?  that was me, winning genius kerr.  yeah i know we came back and got completely embarrassed the next year, blowing the largest lead in finals history.  embarrassed so badly people talk about that more than the time we won.  weird that it happened to us winners like that, with our perfect strategies and winners like steph and klay.  but i tell you what, did we let that get us down?  no!  i mean yeah, we got down on our knees and begged the 2nd best player in the league to join us and help us beat the big bad bully, but that's what competitors do.  give up and ask other people for help.  and it's not even like winners like us even needed the guy.  i mean sure, we lost the first real series we played as soon as we didn't have him, but that's besides the point, we didn't really need him.  also, somehow, we were down 3-2 to that group of losers i was just telling you about.  with their stupid coach and ugly system and choker players and all their high PnR's and iso's.  losers all around let me tell you.  but also, a group of losers only a genius such as myself and incomparable competitors and winners like our players could beat.  but back to the present and the winners we have.  when we no longer had kevin durant, did we say ""well that's it, i guess we can't compete""?  no, because winning is what we do.  we don't just needs gobs of talent.  it's about being competitors, facing the odds, struggling against the cruel vagaries of nature itself. and so we summoned our courage, stared down the league, and immediately tanked a whole season with 2 hall of famers and another all-star on the active roster.  because i mean, who wouldn't want some more talent?"

The Finals sample size for him is small and he doesn't have to deal with hostile fans in the stands."
"Playoff scoring is more important than regular season scoring since it actually matters. Kevin Durant has zero argument for being the best playoff scorer and therefore has no case for the best scorer of all time.   James Harden is arguably the greatest regular season scorer ever but no one would call him the greatest scorer ever because while still elite in the playoffs, he falls off pretty hard. The same goes for Kevin Durant."
"asked about KD's assertion that motion offense doesn't work deep in the playoffs:  &gt;I wasn’t at all offended what Kevin said because it’s basically the truth,” Kerr said. “You look at any system, I mean, I played the triangle with Michael Jordan. The offense ran a lot smoother all regular season and the first couple rounds of the playoffs than it did in the conference finals and Finals. It just did.”  &gt;Kerr continued: “That’s why guys like Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant are who they are. They can transcend any defense. But defenses in the playoffs, deep in the playoffs, combined with the physicality of the game — where refs can’t possibly call a foul every time — means that superstars have to take over. No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact…  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-right-warriors-did-play-more-iso-against-best-defenses/"

No system is just going to dice a Finals defense up. You have to rely on individual play. I didn’t look at (his comment) as offensive. I look at that as fact…  https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/09/25/steve-kerr-kevin-durant-is-right-warriors-did-play-more-iso-against-best-defenses/"

"Nah, it's definitely a rap.  [LeBron James: ""IT AIN""T EASY"" Feat. Mr. Hardest Road himself, Kevin Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8-cOWo3Txw)"
Did Kevin Durant die????? Did Chris Bosh vanish into infinity??? Did Kevin Garnett get Thanos snapped out of existence??? What an abysmally stupid take.
"We are talking about the offensive game of Kevin Durant here. Not the Warriors bench, or their defense, or all the other things that made them 73-9.   What I can do is find abysmal games from Larry Bird in series that ended in sweeps or gentlemen sweeps. Or bad shooting nights from MJ that still ended in blowouts.    Yeah, I’m sure games 5(he had 40), 6 and 7 define if KD can cook or not. It’s not like he had multiple scoring titles and a MVP by then ... you’re right.   I actually have a question. If you downplay Durants play because of elite spacing on GSW, why don’t we praise Durants OKC play even more considering he had absolutely garbage spacing ?"
There is no gap between Kevin Durant and Brandon Ingram
They had Nikola Mirotic guarding Kevin Durant.
Yea sure but there was also this super team featuring Steph Curry and Kevin Durant
Here are some other current notable players and their last 100 playoff games:  Kevin Durant: **29.5 - 7.6 - 4.3** \- 1.0 - 1.2 (59.8% TS)  Stephen Curry: **26.9 - 5.6 - 6.1** \- 1.6 - 0.3 (61.5% TS)  James Harden: **26.5 - 5.6 - 6.5** \- 1.8 - 0.5 (57.8% TS)  Kawhi Leonard: **22.7 - 8.1 - 3.1** \- 1.9 - 0.7 (61.4% TS)  Russell Westbrook: **25.1 - 7.1 - 7.8** \- 1.9 - 0.3 (50.7% TS)
Dirk for one.  1-3 against Golden State  1-2 against the Spurs   1-2 against Kevin Durant
"Can't man.  I don't approve of teams trying to extort their fans' tax payer dollars to build stadiums, especially when they've been around for over 40 years in the city and the the same name as your favorite video game character from your childhood with an extra SUPER prepended to it all while having Gary Fucking Payton and Shawn Fucking Kemp putting on a show for the entire league on that team.  And I don't approve of depriving a city like Seattle of Kevin Durant within a year of drafting him.  That said, Sam Presti runs you guys pretty well.  It sucks that you guys are small market limited in terms of salary cap/luxury tax.  Without that sort of limitation, I wonder how much of a better job he'd do than he already is.  But hey, my second team's the Grizzlies (having moved out of NYC and being in Memphis when they moved there).  So I'm all about small market teams.  At least in Memphis, the city owns the Fed Ex Forum and hasn't had to charge taxpayers yet (other than a car rental tax and a portion of sales tax on  NBA gear) to pay off the bonds that funded it: http://archive.commercialappeal.com/sports/revenue-streams-to-pay-off-fedexforum-bonds-are-healthy-304e9fb4-73d9-7d73-e053-0100007fadac-375466491.html.  The FedexForum seats 18,119 people and cost the city $250M, and they sold the naming rights for $92M.    The Thunder owner was asking Seattle to build a $500M stadium in a suburb of Seattle after having bought the team for $350M a year earlier.   And he wanted it out in the suburbs instead of expanding Key Arena because Seattle passed a law saying that teams have to pay fair market value for using venues within the city (Key Arena).  To fund it, appa (hrently $278M of it would have had to come from tax revenue, all because he didn't want to pay fair market value for the seat price of a brand new arena: https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/sonics/2007-07-19-move-okc-arena_N.htm  Remember the Grizzlies built theirs for $250M at around the same time and only get small chunk of the payment from any taxes (with most of it coming from seat prices).  To be clear, the Starbucks guy who owned the team before was asking for $200odd million to expand the seating of Key Arena from 17000 to 18000 in 2001.  And the city and state balked at it since they'd just renovated the arena five or six years earlier.  So yeah, I can't really root for the Thunder.  I'm more of a defense first, grit &amp; grind, underdog rooting fan anyways.  All that said, New York state needs to start charging Dolan's MSG property tax.  And possibly end that lease, so that Penn Station can be expanded again.  It'd be cool to move MSG to NY Baseball Giants old stomping grounds and be right across the river from Yankees stadium.  Some public housing would have to be moved though."
Stewart =Kevin Durant
Fuck Kevin Durant he's scared to play Lil B 1v1
Really? You agree with giving the best 2 way player this side of Kevin Durant more playing time? You don't say
"Excuse me but... we are between games 4 and 5 of the NBA finals and to my recollection, neither Kevin Durant nor the Knicks played basketball this year. Why is this at the top of the subreddit??"
"The point you’re missing is that the team was already championship caliber when he joined. His stats are inflated by playing on the team with likely the best spacing of all time, two of the best off ball players of all time, and not even having to take a large defensive role.  I don’t really care about his numbers in the finals or playoffs because his team was so much markedly better than the opposition *AND* he wasn’t even the primary focus of the other teams defense. He’s Kevin fucking Durant, give me *ANY* all time great player, put them in the exact same circumstances as a defenses secondary focus on the best shooting/spacing team of all time that also runs good off ball action and they’ll put up similar levels of crazy stats.   You ever play 5v5 and the other team picked their lineup before the game and everybody is like 6’3 and no one one your team is over 6’0? No one cares when they beat you, it’s expected, the same way I felt about KDs performance. If he didn’t put up gaudy numbers then he simply wouldn’t be as a good of a player in my mind."
Kevin Durant did in in 2017.   35-8-5 on 56/47/93 splits with a true shooting of 69.8%
It’s always a good time to mention fuck Kevin Durant
"Do YOU really believe that series with a fully healthy Kevin Durant arguably the best player, if not a Top 3 (?) player in the world alongside a healthy Klay loses to the Raptors. Come on man, this embarassing. I’m a Laker fan but I’m logical."

Players such as Kevin Durant have admitted as such. Possessions such as these make it pretty clear.

"Maybe. But that 3-1 lead against Warriors was probably the biggest choke I've ever seen. They even was winning until 5th minute in fourth. After that tournover, bad shoot, tournover and Warriors comeback. Kevin Durant is probably the greatest offensive player, but after that series I do not trust him in 4 in big gimes.   I rather have this guy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6XsZVb-ZE"
Breanna Stewart is solidifying herself as one of the best women’s basketball players of all time. This is her second Finals mvp and she’s only 26. She also won four!! Straight ncaa championships and has a wnba mvp under her belt.  She’s also just won finals mvp coming off the same injury Kevin Durant has. (Torn Achilles.)

"OKC finishes in the western conference since 10/11 season: 4th,2nd,1st,2nd,9th,3rd,6th,4th,6th, 5th. OKC finished with a winning record for 5 of the 6 seasons KD was there in the last 10 years. OKC finished below 4th once in those 6 years. In that time, Lebron had the better team only twice.   OKC had Durant, Russ, Prime Ibaka, Prime sefolosha and 6th man Harden. They took out the Spurs enroute to the finals in 2012.   2012 wade averaged 23,5,4 in the playoffs, Bosh put up 14,8,1, while Russ was at 23,5,6 and Harden put up 16,5,3 with prime Ibaka roaming the backline. 2011 is the only year bron can be said to have had an irrefutably better team. 2013 - 2016 he had somecombinatiom of Russ, Ibaka, Kevin Martin when he was still good, Thabo, Steven Adams, Derek Fisher and others. Lebron had a hobbled wade who averaged 18,4,4 in 2014 and 16,5,5 in 2013 in the playoffs and Bosh who never got past 15 points in both years.  Russ put up 27, 7, 8 in comparison in 2013, and 24,7,7 in 2012 with Martin and Reggie Jackson getting 14 and Ibaka getting 12. They had the younger team and more cap space to sign better role players. KD almost always had the better team tbh in these years, Wade declined quickly after Lebron signed."
"Julius Erving's nick name is ""Doctor J"". He is a top 3-4 small forward of all time (depending on where you rank Kevin Durant), and a top 20 player in NBA history.    In his 2 years in college, he averaged 26pts and 20reb.    In his 5 seasons in the ABA, he won 3 scoring titles, 3 MVP's and 3 Championships. Once the NBA merged with the ABA, he was an all-star all 11 seasons and won the NBA MVP in 1980-81 over Larry Bird and Kareem.   He spent his entire NBA career with the 76ers and won our championship in 1982-1983 where he helped lead the team to a sweep over the Lakers. They also went 12-1 during that playoff run, one of 3 teams to only lose 1 game on a playoff run.

"I ask to see this in the field.  Until I see Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant on the field together, I'm not going to judge.  Only the field will deliver its truth as always."
"&gt;	“No. No. Hell no. You’re banking on the highest level of volatility. It’s an impossibility. **Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the NBA** but Kyrie Irving is a total loose cannon and he’s not doing anything to show us anything but that right now. That’s going to be difficult.  Also, as we just saw with the Clipper, there’s more to offense than just scoring. LeBron’s elite playmaking on top of scoring just as much as KD makes him a better offensive player. LeBron just set the record for 2 point fg% in the finals against an elite defensive team. LeBron is just better than KD on both sides of the court."
I [interviewed](https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/kevin-durant-is-the-only-unstoppable-player-in-the-nba-tim-hardaway-sr-nba-legend) Tim Hardaway Sr roughly 2 years back.
"I just don't get why people are saying stuff like *Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the NBA*. We just had LeBron dad dick everyone, Giannis steamroll the entire regular season and players like Luka and Harden mixing themselves into the MVP conversation.  It's been well over a year since KD played basketball at all, to assume he's the best player in the league - which he has arguably never been - is borderline ridiculous."
"Best player in the game might be stretching it a bit, but let's be honest. Kevin Durant at 50% of his 2018/19 days is still a top 5 player in the league."
"I used to work for a startup private terminal at LAX that famous people often used to avoid paparazzi. One time I had to bring Kevin Durant across the airfield to this charity event where he was surprising a group of kids on an Alaskan Airlines flight. Then they would all fly together to his camp event in Oakland. If you didn’t know, KD has a partnership with Alaskan, and a few planes have his face on the livery.   The airlines were always strict on what time to close the gates.  So KD is dragging his feet at the terminal, and I said to him “Mr Durant the doors at the gate are going to close if we don’t leave now” and he replied “the damn plane isn’t leaving without me. My face is on the side of it.” lmfao"
"Kevin Durant is a 10 time all-star and 9 time All-NBA selection and he's only 32. He's averaged 27 points per game over his career on .493/.381./.883 splits. If you wanna talk about consistency, KD is probably the most consistently elite player of the last decade other than LeBron. He's easily a top 20 all-time player when you look at impact, ability, and metrics."
"I’d love to see what your top 30 all time looks like. And how you’d begin arguing the likes of John Stockton over KD despite him clearly being a worse player. I don’t think you realize how few players in NBA history have resumes without major holes in them. It is actually difficult to sit down, make a list, and defend omitting Kevin Durant from the top 30 at this stage."
"I feel like 1 is a preference of era and who you like better in play style since they’re similar tier players  2 he’s absolutely dumb Kevin Durant is a top 10 scorer of all time and AI isn’t even top 15  3 Klay is one of the best shooters of all time, Oladipo is a mid tier player who never accomplished anything spectacular. Friend dumb once again"
"I work at a high school in the midwest and Kevin durant made a ”surprise” stop at our school.  I was lucky enough to be a part of a small group of 20 or so people that got to sit informally with him to talk for about an hour.  He was amazing and insightful; the fact that he came when he didn't have to was very thoughtfull.  He played lightening with a couple of players from the hoops team and spoke to the rest of the teams from the athletic department in an assembly.  Before he left, he donated a significant amount of money to our school (I'm not sure how much).  I'm a huge fan of durant and wish him nothing but the best in basketball and more importantly in life."
"Man there are so many issues with this. Let's start from the top. Those numbers you posted don't prove anything. You just posted a bunch of statistics that don't actually back the point you're trying to make. You basically just illustrated that Curry shot open shots at a higher or equal frequency than durant in various playoff series. That does not relate to Kevin Durant at all. Proof for that can be found in the fact that Curry shot open at the same frequency in the years before Durant. Search the numbers on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com). And if you remove the only playoffs parameter, it becomes even more obvious. The person who's % of open shots increased the most between Durant and Curry is obviously gonna be durant because he moved from a system where he was the focus of opposing defenses to being almost an afterthought. The film driven narrative also supports this perspective. Curry ""gravity"" is real."
"3rd paragraph it says ""Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the NBA""  That's probably what they're referring to."
"of course im in deep bruh i'm a fan of my team.   Also:   “I don't really see us having a 'head' coach,” Irving said on “The ETCs” podcast with Kevin Durant, via Alec Sturm of Nets Republic. “KD could be a head coach, I could be a head coach (some days). . . . Jacque Vaughn could be a head coach could do it one day. It's a collaborative effort.   “I’m not in a position — nor do I want to be in a position — where I come in and say this is how we’re doing everything. I come in hat in hand in many respects,” Nash said. “How have you done it in the past? What do you think works? I think having a collaborative, confident, talented [group] and hopefully we round out the staff with a ton of experience."""

&gt;Kevin Durant is probably the best player in the NBA   All credibility lost. Would take his claim about Kyrie with a grain of salt
"First of all fuck Kevin Durant, that snake bitch.  And Kyrie... Well. I'm kinda glad he forced his exit at this point.  They both earned the haters tbh."
"For those who didn't watch the video, He said, ""Kevin Durant"""
"Exactly. With this Lakers team, you could at least pack the paint and hope the shooters miss. Except in the warriors case, the shooters were Steph Curry accompanied by Kevin fucking Durant and Klay"
"Yeah, our defense was bad. We weren’t meant to be a defensive powerhouse. We were meant to outshoot whoever we faced. And it worked.   We went 12-1 in the playoffs. We were a historically rated offensive team. We set the record for most 3s in a post season game. It just didn’t matter because we ended up facing the greatest regular season team of all time who, in the offseason due to a miraculous cap increase, signed Kevin fucking Durant."
Maryland is Kevin Durant
"I think in that 15-20 range, but potentially a little higher once he finishes his career.   12. Oscar Robertson  13. Moses Malone  14. Jerry West  15. Karl Malone  16. Kevin Durant  17. Kevin Garnett  18. Stephen Curry  19. Dirk Nowitzki  20. Isiah Thomas"
"I know he was making a joke, but I desperately want to have the confidence of a hypothetical woman who would turn down Kevin fucking Durant for not being 7 foot lol"
Thats mostly because people dont know -  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2797858-kevin-durant-says-he-wont-get-fair-chance-at-dpoy-award-because-of-pure-hate  But in his last full season he was absolutely an elite defender.
"To make a more accurate list. The best basketball player from MD is not Steve Francis, it’s Kevin Durant. And there’s a HOF basketball player that’s legit from DC.  Also from a quick search you wouldn’t be judging them on different criteria. Kobe and Robinson’s families lived in the state where they were born."
"Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green. Boom. 1, 2, 12."
"Kevin Durant was born on September 29th, 1988 at the District of Columbia General Hospital in Washington D.C."
[He's 7 foot if he's talking to girls](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/05/kevin-durant-height-thunder)
"Kevin Durant was born and raised in Suitland, MD. Some people there say they live in DC but it’s in Maryland.  Dave Bing is from DC."
"Curry was doing this even before Kevin Durant joined the team. Curry and Klay are always constantly moving through back screens and Curry even sets screens to free up Klay. For a guard, Curry sets a lot of pretty solid screens."
"Curry was open a lot because he had 12 all-stars at his disposal including freaking Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson who absolutely must be guarded at all times anywhere on the court, as well as the system that he plays in."
"Bro you can literally sit and watch these games for ten minutes and see he gets open layups. He gets open shots. And you’re right those shots don’t always look open, but for the NBA and especially for Kevin Durant, those shots are wide fucking open. You say him being on the warriors isn’t that big of a deal and I’m avoiding data but you’re just ignoring how much of a drop in efficiency occurs in Durant’s shooting when Curry sits. You say “that’d happen with any shooter” and you are so wrong it’s literally insane. You’re right a great shooter will always have a defender stuck to him but Duncan Robinson ain’t pulling help defenders from Kevin fucking Durant the way Curry would. Add onto that that you also have to worry about Klay and KD is getting more open shots than any person would ever have in his career. KD’s stats without Curry on are basically the same as his stats in OKC. And there’s literally no point in giving you any of these facts and data because you won’t listen to it so hopefully you’ll understand why there’s no point arguing with you. You’re a Stan and you’re literally blind sucking KD’s dick. I’ll see you on your next post about how we need to appreciate KD more."
"&gt; Kevin Durant is not 7 feet tall and never has been  From the Wall Street Journal:  https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-nba-players-lie-about-their-height-1462316051  &gt; Durant’s case is particularly odd, though, since he stretched the truth to make himself shorter. Durant... said he often lies about his height depending on whom he’s speaking with.  &gt; “For me, when I’m talking to women, I’m 7 feet,” he said. “In basketball circles, I’m 6-9.”  Jokes aside, from the article itself, it does appear that he admits he is actually 6' 11"" and lies about his height to appear shorter."
"1. Kevin Durant is not 7 feet tall and never has been  2. There aren't that many mobile players over 6'10, hence why everyone makes a big deal about them   3. Of the ones that are, 99% of them aren't remotely as close to as good as Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant doesn't understand water is wet
"“I don’t really see us having a ‘head’ coach,” Lue said on “The ETCs” podcast with Kevin Durant, via Alec Sturm of Nets Republic. “Kawhi could be a head coach, I could be a head coach (some days). . . . Pat Bev could be a head coach could do it one day. It’s a collaborative effort.”"
"I think Malone is above Dirk if we are strictly looking at regular season and accolades, but I do think it's worth noting that forwards were fairly weak during Malone's prime. Bird and McHale had retired, Duncan, Dirk and KG had yet to play. It was basically Karl Malone, Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley fighting for 2 first team All NBA forward spots every year. Most of the dominant 90s players were centers (Hakeem, Shaq, Ewing, Robinson) or guards (MJ, Stockton, Payton). A lot of the forwards who theoretically would've competed with Malone for All NBA first team selections were injured (Grant Hill), didn't pan out (Jamal Mashburn) or even Len Bias who passed away.   Meanwhile Dirk was going up against Duncan and Kevin Garnett (two of the top 5 PFs of all time) in addition to LeBron James and even Kevin Durant (two of the top 3 SFs of all time).   FWIW I think Malone, Garnett and Dirk are interchangeable depending on what you value. Malone was a routine playoff underperformer, he also benefitted from playing in a weaker conference. Dirk had the most clutch performances and best legacy, Kevin Garnett is probably the most talented of the 3."
"&gt; That people's expectations are way too high for Kevin Durant next year coming off a torn achilles age 32.  Definitely this one.  A lot of ""he's Kevin Durant"" as the reason he'll come back just as good even though there's only been one superstar to ever come back the same."
"a) That this was the peak for the Nuggets in the playoffs and theyll never do better than this, making a WCF and losing in 5-6 games with this core  b) That there's a fair chance injuries significantly put a damper on Zion's career or what he couldve ultimately been  c) That people's expectations are way too high for Kevin Durant next year coming off a torn achilles age 32.   d) That the kings will waste De'Aaron fox  e) That playoff Draymond(ie the version you saw through 2019) may be a thing of the past"
Excluding players preceding 1980  1. MJ 2. LeBron  3. Kareem 4. Kobe 5. Shaquille 6. Magic 7. Hakeem 8. Kevin Durant 9. Bird  10. Tim Duncan   I’m sure you will but please let me know how wrong I am lol  Edit: To be clear the two current players on this list are speculative picks and but I don’t think anyone will disagree with Lebron’s position. However the KD pick is admittedly a bit personally biased and he is the only player on that list that is (again in my opinion) replaceable. Gun to my head if I had to change that KD pick with someone who played post-1980 I would say Dirk.

"Kevin Durant played a big part in GSW’s 2 titles and won 2 FMVP. Should that be counted the same as Kawhi and his 2?  Pau played a big part in 2 of ours, should he be ahead of Barkley who has 0?  Rings are a deciding factor when its close. But that’s literally the only argument McHale has. Giannis has 2 mvps and 1 DPOY."
Why they wouldnt be the same team as they were with KD they loss Andre and Livingston too plus the players they gave up initially to get Kevin Durant.  Plus the trade includes Draymond and Wiggins.
"&gt;	Losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson doesn’t mean Warriors should struggle with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green  Shallow ass GSW team loses 2/4 best players (including arguably their best player in the playoffs). Point is they were the biggest lock to win if they had these players in recent history. Before that, Cavs in 2015 would’ve beat GSW with Kyrie and Love.  Every team that wins gets lucky, which is why you should shut the hell up about injuries, but especially if you’re a GS or a Raps fan  You’re damn right GS is gonna be worse than any time during their run. They’re still a threat because they can get hot at any time. But over 7 games... they don’t have the defense to do it IMO"
Imagine pulling up to the gym and see Kevin Durant balling up your 5’9 friend.
"GS had their fair share of playing against crippled teams. Pelicans without Cousins, Cavs without Kyrie or Love, Rockets with CP3 and Mbah Moute the first year, Kawhi Leonard in SA, POR without Nurkic. Losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson doesn’t mean Warriors should struggle with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. It’s right there lol you got FMVP Iguodala, Steph Curry, ALL NBA team and DPOY Draymond Green. Sad to think you need Kevin Durant AND Klay Thompson both to beat everyone else. Throw Kevin Durant in with Love, Kyrie, and James and they never lose to any team. Throw Durant on with CP3 and Harden and they beat any team, throw Durant in with Westbrook and they almost beat the 73-9 Warriors. We’ll see how the warriors do without Durant this season. What will be the excuse? Thompson with the ACL injury? Draymond declining? Wiggins being a bum compared to bogut and barnes? I can’t see GS running it back now that durant is gone. It’s LA/LAC for next few years 🤷‍♂️"
Kevin Durant and kyrie irving  Kawhi Leonard and Paul George  Giannis
Anybody got that clip of the one guy who asked Kevin Durant who the sexier Van Gundy was or was that a weird dream I had one time?
"I'm just going to say better, worse of the same.   &gt;Atlanta Hawks- Bradley Beal  Better  &gt;Boston Celtics- Trae Young   Worse  &gt;Brooklyn Nets- Jayson Tatum  If it's 2019-20 better because KD was hurt. 2021?

"I said everything Im gonna say. If I replied to you about this, I'd just be repeating everything I've already said. Like I said, there's no tiny, marginal difference between the 2018 and 2019 Rockets you could possibly bring up that makes up for us losing **Kevin fucking Durant.** If you can't beat us at home without Kevin fucking Durant in an elimination game, then you just can't beat us. Plain and simple.  W/CP3, w/o CP3, w/ KD, w/o KD, the result would've always been the same  you can keep bringing up regular season stats and accolades like they matter at all, but they don't. If anything, they prove CP3 has been great and you need to live in this fantasy world where CP3 was all NBA, then a scrub, then all NBA again in order to justify your high-in-the-sky beliefs. But that just doesn't follow any logic. Name one NBA player thats ever gone from all-nba talent to scrub whose washed to all-nba talent again in the span of 3 seasons. Name one.  again, if the dubs can trade Klay's ACL tear, KD's achilles tear, Curry's MCL sprain in 2016 and 2018, Draymond's suspension, Bogut's knee injury in 2016, and Curry's broken hand  for Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love healthy in 2015 and CP3 playing an extra couple games in 2018, they'd take that *gladly.* You can believe whatever you wanna believe, but I don't think there's a single warriors fan that *wouldn't* take that"
"Yeah, this is it. There's only one notable Steph, Kobe, Lebron, Dame, Luka, Giannis, etc., but you can't just refer to a player as ""Kevin,"" because it's not a cool name nor is it a unique one (Durant, Love, Garnett, etc.)."
"Blakes smaller than Kevin Durant and I would rather have KDs handles and KD playing the 4. Giannis, LeBron, and even Luka fit this bill too. Luka is an inch shorter than Blake but still similar enough unless OP wants an arbitrary line drawn at 6'8"". Bird, Magic, Pippen deserves mentions.   EDIT: I agree with Lamar Odom as others have posted. Made he wonder if Ingram can be mentioned. Zion could one day retire a great ball handler. Julius Randle is a B- version of these guys. Jabari Parker is actually a great ball handler at 6'8 300lbs and he plays 4."
"Nicknames and ""shorthand"".  Basically people in general are lazy and try to communicate as succinctly as possible.  We see this in all aspects of life.  That's why there are keyboard shortcuts and ""shorthand"" and abbreviations.    &amp;#x200B;  It should be noted that ""lazy"" in this sense isn't a bad thing.  It's just easier to type/say KD than type out or say Kevin Durant.  Heck, it's even easier to type/say KD than say Durant.  If you say ""Kevin"" you could be talking about multiple people.    &amp;#x200B;  Some players have names or initials or nicknames that are relatively unique (KD, Luka, Lebron, Dame, CP3, Magic, Bird, Embiid, Kobe, Klay, Steph) and some have relatively common names but are SO well known that we all know who we are talking about (MJ, AD).  It's just easier to use these nicknames than type out full names every time.    &amp;#x200B;  The unique names we use because it's clear who the player is using their unique names.  The more vague ones we have to explain more so we tend to have to type a fuller name so that we are communicating exactly who we are talking about."
"ya was more of a joke, wasnt really trying to say 2020 dwight was playing better basketball then kevin durant lol"
"really i thought KD said he was in on it?  edit: some googling found:  &gt;ESPN's Chris Haynes reported Thursday ... Kevin Durant was in on the joke   &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg8ZDTLY2dg  another ESPN show saying he had no prior knowledge that it was going to happen    huh seems like KD never said one way or the other, but KD probably would have said so if it was a joke IMO. he can't seem to shut up about anything else. the only person i can find saying KD was in on it was Chris Hayes"
You think all 9 teams have like a Kevin Durant or what?
"Short version: There's no tiny, marginal difference between the 2018 and 2019 Rockets you could possibly bring up that makes up for us losing **Kevin fucking Durant.** If you can't beat us at home without Kevin fucking Durant in an elimination game, then you just can't beat us. Plain and simple.   W/CP3, w/o CP3, w/ KD, w/o KD, the result would've always been the same  Long version:  &gt;Switched to a plant based diet and changed his workout routine completely for the 2020 season. Do your research, it’s not hard. It’s all backed up by facts and stats.  ohhhh so plants cure ""multiple serious hamstring injuries,"" as you put it. Good to know. Yeah, do phoenix tears also cure ACL tears in your fantasy world? Cmon bro, these are NBA players. Every all star has a dietitian and is getting the best treatment and care in the world. CP3 didn't have this fantasy drop-off, he's been good. It just fits in your fantasy world that he magically wasn't good so you can *actually believe* the Rockets could've beaten the Warriors 😂😂😂  &gt;If you watched Chris Paul play in 2018 compared to 2019 you’d know what I was talking about. He couldn’t take anyone off the dribble and his game was much less efficient. Harden had to average 36 fucking PPG to make up for it  CP3 averaged 21-5-7 on 60% TS% in the playoffs this year where ""he got better"" and was a point away from beating Westbrook and Harden. He averaged 17-6-7 on 57% TS% against the dubs the year ""he got way worse"". Is that marginal difference in CP3's box score *actually* the reason the Rockets lost in 2019 but would've won in 2018?   And again, And even if CP3 had this *incredible drop-off in ability*, then *magically* got better like you said, the difference still doesn't make up for losing **Kevin fucking Durant**. I don't even know why thats a point of discussion  &gt;I don’t know why you keep mentioning 2019 as if I already haven’t admitted we deserved to lose that because we weren’t as good.   lol I keep bringing it up because, yes, you weren't as good. But you were also never better than the warriors. Any tiny, marginal nonexistent difference between CP3 in 2018 and 2019 still doesn't make up for losing **Kevin fucking Durant**. If you can't beat us at home without Kevin fucking Durant in an elimination game, then you just can't beat us. Plain and simple. There's no marginal difference between the 2018 and 2019 Rockets you could possibly bring up that makes up for us losing **Kevin fucking Durant**  &gt;If you watched Chris Paul play in 2018 compared to 2019 you’d know what I was talking about. He couldn’t take anyone off the dribble and his game was much less efficient. Harden had to average 36 fucking PPG to make up for it  lol why do you keep bringing up regular season stats like they mean anything in the playoffs? Look at Harden's playoff stats and CP3's playoff stats from year to year, then maybe you can break out of your fantasy bubble world  &gt;Warriors got lucky in 2018, just like they did in 2015. Good bye.  lmao if the dubs can trade Klay's ACL tear, KD's achilles tear, Curry's MCL sprain in 2016 and 2018, Draymond's suspension, Bogut's knee injury in 2016, and Curry's broken hand  for Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love healthy in 2015 and CP3 playing an extra couple games in 2018, they'd take that *gladly* and probably 5peat"
This makes no sense. The Heat at their peak *with* LeBron James were not as good as the Warriors before Kevin Durant joined them.
This is all dependent on KD. If Kevin Durant isn’t the same he once was everything changes
"Probably not for a multitude of reasons:   1. Their defense is not gonna be very good.   2. Kevin Durant will be 32 and returning from a devastating injury. He probably won't ever be the same.   3. Durant and Irving seem to want DeAndre Jordan to play over Jarrett Allen, who is much better."
"RJ Barrett was more hyped coming out of high school(and was the no.1 high school player) as opposed to Zion in that class.  Zion though emerged moreso in his freshman year at Duke in terms of hype and attention.  Anyway, back to the question. Greg Oden was very hyped when he was in high school. Not quite LeBron level, but probably the most since LeBron. ESPN was showing his high school games from memory. Greg Oden's high school class was the first class that couldn't go straight to the pros from high school and had to go 1 year in college.  On a side note, Kevin Durant was also in Oden's year and he got alot of hype in his freshman year at UT but less so at the high school level.  The 2004 Class seemed to receive a fair bit of hype as a class/collection judging by the attention the McDonalds Game got that year.  Alot of them went straight to the NBA in the '04 draft. Dwight Howard, Shaun Livingston(was meant to be the ""next Magic Johnson"" as a pure 6'7 PG), Sebastian Telfair, Marvin Williams, LaMarcus Aldridge, Josh Smith, JR Smith, Al Jefferson, Rudy Gay, Robert Swift, Dorrell Wright, Rajon Rondo."
"""Why do I keep hearing GSW as a viable title contenders? Let's not forget please.... when they won the championship in 2015... everybody in the NBA was hurt. Chris Paul was hurt.. Kevin Love was hurt, Kyrie was hurt. In 2016, THEY LOST. and then came the Kevin Durant ERA. Without Kevin Durant, they are nothing. They are a bunch of overrated shooters who are too soft to contend in the playoffs. Even with Kevin Durant, they went 7 games against the Houston Rockets led by a choker James Harden. They are too over rated because of the 73 win season and people should stop the non sense. "" - u/wionghan  He has such a way with words, absolutely poetic!"

"It's crazy to think that during a five-year stretch OKC had one or more of Chris Paul, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, Russell Westbrook, and Kevin Durant."
"Stephen curry,  Kay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan   And an Arena with no A/C  That would do the trick easy"
"In 2014, Wade was getting his knee drained and averaged 15 points a game. Bron, Wade, and Bosh were the only Heat players that could average double digits in points, compared to the previous year where five Heat players averaged that. In a year after a “toss up” NBA finals, the Miami team only got worse, and the Spurs team got much better - there’s not much Bron can do to make up for his teammates not showing up against a superior team.   I have 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2015, it goes without saying that Lebron wouldn’t be favored in a series where Matthew Dellavedova was Curry’s primary matchup. That’s like swapping Dennis Rodman for Toni Kukoc as Karl Malone’s primary defender all series. In 2016, even though they won, Lebron’s team was an underdog against the best regular season team of all time. If you don’t want to count that because he won that series, then go ahead.  In the 2017 playoffs, of course people were expecting a “rubber match” since the Cavs dominated the playoffs. But anyone with working eyes would realize that if you switch Harrison Barnes for prime Kevin Durant, there’s no team in history that would be favored in that series.   &gt; A lot of people claiming the Warriors gave up too much depth for KD and that Bron was “in their heads.”  To be fair, they did, but they only started paying for it in 2019 when KD went down. Before that, they were 67-15 in 2017. The “Bron is in their head” thing completely dissipated after MLK day when they destroyed the Cavs.   I’m left with 07, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 then. He was an underdog for five of those finals losses, and a *heavy underdog* in four of them.  Still, I would rather not erase them from history, because 4-6 is still a hell of a lot better than 4-4, or even 4-0. If you think otherwise, we’d have to agree to disagree"
"*Here's how the Lakers can get Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmshevxnkfgshdbkdgd, Steph Curry, Bugs Bunny, Michael Jordan, and Stephen A. Smith in free agency*"
"Lol yall are obsessed with diminishing KDs accomplishments Im not going to argue it but using these same arguments to diminish GSW as an organization and what they accomplished is asinine. If everybody could create a set up to lure Kevin Durant and create the most talented roster in NBA history they would. Intentionally not trying to improve your roster and make it ""too good"" so it feels like more of a challenge when you win is galaxy brain level stuff."
It's a NY team.  It should be DIO-Durant and have commercials where Kevin Durant dresses up like 80s hair metal icon Johnny Dio to sell deoderant.

"You used a textbook logical fallacy in the silliest way.    If being aware of what a logical fallacy is makes me a neckbeard, then sure man I'll take it.   It's something that's taught in a variety of classes at the high school level, and sometimes lower than that.  Since you want more detail,  I will assume you don't know what reductio ad absurdum is.    You've reduced the discussion to a point that it is completely meaningless.   Meaningless to a point of absurdity.    ""That’s because there isn’t anything to try to talk about, they all joined a super team for easy wins.""  No, actually, there is *specific context* that differentiates every one of these examples from Kevin Durant.    A player leaving a bad team to join a good team is actually quite different than leaving a good team to join an incredibly good team!   It's actually not even a subtle distinction.   Kevin Durant left a team with an MVP caliber running mate that had a 3-1 lead on the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals to join the team that they blew the lead on.   You can either  1) Keep pretending this is exactly the same as leaving teams with terrible rosters that never have a shot in the playoffs.  2) Acknowledge that it's probably *not* exactly the same thing, given that the specific circumstances are wildly different and how this has probably been pointed out to you dozens of times.  You went with 1, which is a reductio ad absurdum tactic.   It's literally absurd to treat all of these examples as the same thing, and that is why you were downvoted a lot.  You're correct that I was a bit dismissive, because Kevin Durant did this 5 years ago and I have a hard time believing you actually think it's exactly the same thing as AD leaving the Pelicans given how much its been discussed."

"He averages 5 assists, you don't need to be a point guard to be an offensive player...... The spacing his shooting provides, drawing doubles, and just making plays for himself. FYI Jordan averaged about 5 assists as well. Oh and look at the link below and compare to say Lebron, k thanks. [https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-points-per-possession-season](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/kevin-durant-points-per-possession-season)"
"Here is my beef with this clip: Kevin Durant has said that he was playing the part of a nice guy during the time he was made MVP. He said that the current disrespectful and flippant version we get now is the real him. The rub is that what made this speech special in the day was that it felt very authentic and it gave hope to the kids with single moms working 3 jobs to make sure they can play basketball. Finding out that the nice guy Durant was an act muddies this speech and draws into question it’s authenticity. This is not to say his words weren’t authentic, but had Hitler given a speech early in his career about how his mom helped him to become the man he was, would we cherish it to this day?    I over exaggerate the example. But reality is character is character and once you compromise that it calls into question everything you have ever done. Was this speech authentic or did he work with someone to make it emotional so that he could sell more shoes? The words are true, but the spirit behind it might be false."
“He’s Kevin Durant” would like to have a word.
Kevin Durant did pushups??
"Yeah, there's no way Kevin Durant is the only dude posting twitter/reddit on an anon account."
The quote has just become part of the English language now. I hear people use that who don't even know who Kevin Durant is.
What if Kevin Durant doesn’t shoot 10-31 in Game 6 of the 2016 WCF and closes it out instead to go to the Finals
Kevin Durant?
Stew is like Kevin Durant on offense and Hakeem on defense in the WNBA (or at least when I watched her in college and in these playoffs) like she is the real fucking deal.
Kevin Durant choked a 3-1 lead then went to play with the team that beat him is the key difference
I have no idea where in your confused brain you came up with the thought that only his catch and shoot stats are relevant and [you are also wrong about his percentages.](https://stats.nba.com/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2015-16&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;PORound=3&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FGA&amp;dir=1) both in the 2016 WCF and the [2017 finals](https://stats.nba.com/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2016-17&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;PORound=4&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FGA&amp;dir=1) he shot 46% on catch&amp;shoot FGA.   What you're completely missing is that in that '16 WCF he only attempted 26 layups or dunks over the whole 7 game series. 9 of those were assisted. Over the 5 game '17 finals he attempted 32 layups and dunks of which 20 were assisted. Will you finally admit now that  Kevin Durant got easy as fuck opportunities because of the team he was on?
Dude you’re not gonna convince anyone that Kevin Durant being flanked by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson is the same thing as Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka in OKC.
I'm a Raptors fan but if you think Kawhi is better than Kevin Durant I got news for you. You need to watch more basketball fam. Also Kawhi didn't carry the Raptors he  was their best player but the supporting cast was not like the 2018 Cavs. KD is a first ballot hall of famer and has been the best player on the team his whole basketball life.  Kawhi would have taken a back seat for Steph Curry if he went to GSW.
I thought that was Kevin Durant.
"We are only reacting like this because everything about the Clippers Fallout this year is being documented by sites that have sources that said ""trust me bro"".  You all think Lebron isn't more demanding than Kawhi? He probably is, but he wont be criticized by it because he brings result better than anyone. So no reports like this won't come out.   Giannis probably demanded a lot of shit from bucks in their last meeting but it will probably wont come out.   Kevin Durant, you think this guy didn't have a part on why nets signed deandre jordan on a bad deal?"
"&gt;When you say best scorer of all time you have to be taking season performance into account, this is kinda cherrypicked. Kevin Durant is only behind Wilt and Jordan in terms of the number of scoring titles he has.  Yes, he is BEHIND Wilt and Jordan. I don't see how him being 3rd is an argument for him as the best scorer ever. In fact, I don't really see any argument for him as the best scorer ever.  I agree that regular season scoring is important. But playoff scoring is more important, and that's where KD is lacking in terms of being the single greatest scorer ever. If you're not even the best playoff scorer in the world while playing with most spacing anyone's ever had, you're not the best scorer ever.   &gt;He's 6th all time in career PPG right now behind Jerry West / Lebron James / Elgin Baylor by less than a basket. That puts him up there in the conversation.  Yes, he will always be in that conversation. But he will never be at the top of it.   &gt;It's clear that LeBron has been using the season to playmake more and score less, which doesn't make him less valuable of a player, but if we are talking ""best scorer of all time"" you have to appreciate what KD is able to do irrespective of his teammates  KD's scoring has fluctuated greatly in the postseason depending on his teammates, so you can't really say irrespective of teammates. LeBron, with his playmaking load, has still scored more ppg on the same efficiency in his last three postseasons as KD has in his three GSW postseasons.   &gt;On a ""bad"" team he's a near 30 PPG bomb on good efficiency. On a stacked roster he drops a couple points but his efficiency shoots up to close to that of a big who just rolls to the basket and finishes layups. He's an incredible scorer.  KD was never on a bad team. He was on teams that weren't optimal for his game, but they were never bad.   No doubt that KD is an incredible scorer, but the fact is that he only scored with amazing efficiency in the playoffs when put on a team that was already the #1 offense in the world before he joined.  &gt;There is no way Kawhi is a better scorer than KD, no matter if we are talking through an entire season or if you wanted to pick one for one particular game/play.  I agree that Kawhi isn't the scorer KD is in general, but in the playoffs since Kawhi took the scoring leap they're actually pretty damn close.   Even if you look at this season where Kawhi underperformed, he scored with impact comparable to KD.   And LeBron has straight up been a better scorer than KD in the playoffs from '17 to date."
"No doubt KD is a phenomenal scorer in regular season, but couldn't elevate his TS% in playoffs like Kawhi.  -----  **Kawhi Lenoard (2015-2020):**  - Regular season: 59.9% TS  - Playoffs: 61.6 TS%  **Kevin Durant (2010-2016):**  - Regular season: 62.1% TS  - Playoffs: 57.5 TS%"

"This stats are meaningless because the Warriors offense was built around Steph hence why he's more ""valuable"" to the team. That doesn't mean he's the better player.   &gt; Also I can't find anything that says Kerr, iggy, klay amd green all said KD was better  [Iguodala ](https://youtu.be/sUDpomAMrSQ)  [Steve Kerr](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thescore.com/nba/news/1319111/amp)  [Draymond ](https://www.talkbasket.net/82697-draymond-green-says-kevin-durant-should-be-considered-as-the-best-player-in-the-nba-not-lebron-james?amp)  [Klay](https://www.google.com/amp/s/warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/11/klay-thompson-on-kevin-durant-hes-our-best-player/amp/)  Go ahead. Tell me how you and Ben Taylor know better than Steph's own coach and teammates. I'll wait."
"in my opinion no. They have different play styles. Hakeem was a dominant big man under the hoop and in the paint with elite footwork. Kevin is 7ft who can shoot 3s, handle the ball, and greet midrange. In my opinion there is no player to compare kevin durant too. I cant think of any 7 footers who can shoot and handle the ball like kevin. he is a once in a life time player. Hakeem is more like shaq and tim duncan in my opinion."
"Lol ""crafty"" stat geeks on here are hilarious. Have fun taking CP3 and Nash over Kevin fucking Durant. I'm sure you'd be a great GM"
"first comment:  ""He's like a mix between michael jordan and kevin durant honestly"""
"He's got all of the most prestigious records, basically, plus he's the most accurate and prolific free throw shooter ever.   Most Free Throws Made in a Quarter in Playoff History  Most Free Throws Made in a Quarter without a Miss in Playoff History  Most Free Throws Made in a Game without a miss in NBA History  Most Free Throws Made in a single postseason in Playoff History  Highest Free Throw Percentage in a Finals Series  And, as I said, he's the most prolific/efficient Free Throw Shooter ever. He's got like 5,000 more Free Throws Made than Curry while shooting 88% career. Curry and Nash are great, but they're not comparable to his volume. Only guys that are are Rick Barry, Reggie Miller, Kevin Durant, and Chauncey Billups."
Kyle Lowry: $18  Klay Thompson: $23  Kevin Durant: $39  Kevin Love: $10  Thomas Bryant: $6  Terry Rozier: $6  Gary Trent: $5  Miles Bridges: $3  Tauren Prince: $3  Kelly Olynyk: $5  Tyler Johnson: $1  Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot: $1
"I'll say it again, this is Kevin Durant. It's not like Kobe where he's a guard and so a loss of athleticism was devastating to his game, KD essentially slithered his way to the basket without even trying and shot over anyone who was guarding him. He has Elastigirl arms.   KD at 50% is better than any regular player (i.e. not an all star) at 100%. The only thing that could possibly shatter KD is if he loses his ability to jump completely due to the Achilles."
It’s crazy it’s like he’s Kevin Durant or something
Not everyone on Earth is Kevin Durant level gifted. There's only 1 player on this planet that's better at basketball than he is.
"I’m not sure if you missed it, but they have these guys named Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving"
But Kevin Durant wasn't registered to play! The courts would have proved this later. So we're still the champs
Kevin Durant
In some Brazilian high school there is a player not dissimilar from Kevin Durant.
"Raptors? Excuse me. If you only count the *legitimate* games, meaning the ones who Kevin Durant played, then the Warriors are the real champions. Get your fake Canadian news out of here."
Nah dude  That Kevin Durant guy might have been an all star if Russ didn’t sabotage his game
What are you doing? The only Warrior of that era who gets discredited and attacked is Kevin Durant ! Stick to the game plan!
"&gt;Did you see Pierces clutch stats earlier? I don’t know what Melo has but I’d bet Pierce is better.  And your bet would be wrong.  &gt;What’s impressive about Anthony is how he maintained the shooting percentage with such a high volume of attempts.  &gt;The former Syracuse basketball great is one of only seven players to take over 100 “hero shots” since 2004-2005. LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Joe Johnson, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Dwyane Wade were the others.  &gt;Only Anthony, James, Johnson and Durant shot above that 30 percent average.  &gt;Anthony has the highest shooting percentage of that group of seven, but took fewer shots than everyone but Joe Johnson.  [source](https://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/2019/08/clutch-factor-finds-carmelo-anthony-is-one-of-the-best-at-big-shots.html)"
They also had Kevin Durant for two of those and won against a Cavs team missing Kyrie and Love..  I don’t think the Warriors small ball would work that well against a team with LeBron and AD
"I would say it is completely meaningless. Kevin Durant at 70% will look incredibly dominant against non nba players. 70% Kevin Durant looks more Harrison Barnes against nba players. It's good in the sense that it wasn't a bad workout. If he had looked bad, it would mean he will never be the same or have a long road back."
Imma paraphrase Shaq for this one. Why isn't Kobe brought up? Imma also paraphrase Kevin Durant on this one. If Jordan is 1A then Kobe is 1B. Magic: Kobe is the greatest laker of all time. When the greats highly respect the mamba ill take their word for it over random people.
"Number 2 picks from 2000-2019  Stromile Swift  Tyson Chandler  Jay Williams  Darko Milicic   Emeka Okafor  Marvin Williams  LaMarcus Aldridge  Kevin Durant  Michael Beasley  Hasheem Thabeet   Evan Turner  Derrick Williams  Michael-Kidd Gilchrist  Victor Oladipo   Jabari Parker  D'Angelo Russell  Brandon Ingram  Lonzo Ball  Marvin Bagley  Ja Morant  I would say he's already had a more successful career than at least a handful of guys on that list did, and he's most likely going to be a better player than at least half of them.   Were there better players to take at #2? Of course. There almost always is. But teams draft on 2 things: Potential, and what they need. The Lakers needed a point guard, and Lonzo had the highest potential out of any in the draft.   Lonzo won't be a transcendent PG, but he's gonna stick around as a starter, maybe make a couple ASG, and probably won't make the HoF. But not being a HoFer does not make you a bust. Even at a pick as high as #2."
*Kevin Durant has signed with the Golden State Warriors after Dinwiddie turned his contract into government bonds*
"If you look at the actual numbers, it’s not close for Westbrook. He’s straight up terrible in the playoffs. The only reason he played in the finals was because he played with Kevin Durant and James Harden"
"The Dream over Air Jordan made sense at the time, and Hakeem was absolutely a HOFer, so definitely wasn’t a bad pick.  There certainly have been much worse instances of when a freakishly large while also freakishly athletic center garnered the first pick over a skinny guard that could jump high (see: 2007 Draft Class; Greg Oden taken over Kevin Durant)"

"Id rather have wiggins easily. People seriously underestimate how much of a boost it is to play next curry and klay.  KD had 54% TS in okc in the 2016 playoffs, that jumped to 67% TS the next year by simply playing next to them. If teams willingly left Kevin Durant wide open every play, imagine how open wiggins will be.  Wiggins already looked far better in gsw than he ever did in the timberwolves and thats without those 2 opening up the floor for him. Him playing great next to them is not question because he will for sure, the only question is how great will he be."
"G: Chris Paul  G: Michael Jordan  F: Klay Thompson  F: Kevin Durant  C: Bill Laimbeer  Point God has a team of excellent scorers pass to. Jordan can go to work scoring wise and will have KD to help him. Klay can catch and shoot open looks. Laimbeer can shoot the 3, but most importantly, he can rough up opposing stars"
"Agreed, he's indispensable to their defense. They might not have won a single championship over the last six seasons without him, even with Kevin Durant."
"I keep looking at him as a kevin durant ESQUE guy. he's got the fluidity in his jumper that guys his size just don't have. the problem is it doesn't go in quite as much as you'd like. I love his playstyle though, and he's easily the guy I'm highest on."
"I dont really see them having a ""head"" coach. KD could be a head coach, KD could be a head coach (some days)."" KD adds: Kevin Durant could be a head coach, could do it one day. Its a collaborative effort."
"To me, he's just outside the top 10 alongside: Hakeem, Moses, Dr. J and Kevin Durant. As a point guard, he's the 2nd best right now, but Curry will probably finish ahead of him.   He didn't win enough before he got old and joined Kareem. Between 1960 and 1970, he missed the playoffs 4 times and lost in the 1st round another 4 times.   Most importantly, he set the mold for tall point guards who can score too like LeBron James or Luka Doncic"
Yeah I think Poku may be better served playing as a stretch PF due to those strength concerns. It won’t happen in the NbA but I could see a scenario where he’d be like a Kevin Durant if he stayed in Europe forever.
"The 2011 Heat had pretty much the same advantage over the League that GSW had in 2017. You may argue otherwise but their INTENTION was to be much better than the rest and win a lot of titles. Were did I say that Cleveland 2010 were on the same level as OKC in 2016? Cleveland were the 1st seed back to back years, compared to the rest of the League they were what .. 2nd favorite to win the title? OKC in 2016 were 4th behind GSW, SA and Cleveland. You wanna tell me that there was that big of difference between James in 2010 and Durant in 2016? It's pathetic to criticize Kevin for something that your favorite did in the pretty much the same situation. Not to mention that the League wasn't as stacked in 2010. Also you wanna tell me that someone with the Ego of Lebron, someone that sits on 0 titles and chase Jordan's 6 just went for Miami to win 1 or 2 titles?! This is just revisionist history. GSW won the same titles in more dominant fashion and less tries. They didn't win the 3rd because Klay and Looney got injured as well. That is like 3 players from the top 6 rotation wise. Did Miami miss 3 players from their top 6 in 2011 or 2014? In order for you to understand how stacked were the Heat - they completely outplayed Chicago Bulls simply because of star power and the fact that Rose was lacking second star and volume scorer. Heat had THREE of them."
PG - LeBron ; SG - Kevin Durant; SF - Dirk; PF - KG; C - Tim Duncan.
"&gt; no one use fmvp as the only measuring stick for the playoff impact.   Yes, exactly. FMVP/the rings is basically the only thing Isiah has over Paul. Thats why I'm saying if you swapped them Paul would have the rings and Isiah wouldnt.  &gt; For instant, if we swap Prime KD or Prime Shaq in a lot of championship team, they would win a title on those team. Would we lessen Lebron impact because it not out of the realm of possibility that prime KD with wade, bosh would have won those 2 heat title.   No, because the eye test and the stats heavily favour Lebron. Thats my point. To me, basically everything is in Paul's favour except the rings. If Lebronw as worse than Kevin Durant then saying ""swappign Durant for Lebron and they still win the titles"" makes sense as an argument for Durant. Lebron has a lot more than just rings in his locker though.   What Im saying is, if literally every stat (and imo also the eye test) favour one player, then maybe just because that player never won a title shouldn't immediately rank them lower than the one with a title or two. Context matters, championships don't happen in a vacuum. Peak Paul and peak Isiah weren't vying for titles at the same time.  &gt; IF cp3 was such a great players, he would have won something already. Winning a title in some aspect do prove you're a winner if we comparing all time greats.   No, that isn't how this works. Great players don't always win Championships. Barkley is one of the greatest players ever, he never won one. The best team Paul was ever on just happened to coincide with the year that possibly the greatest NBA team ever assembled happened to play in. That Rockets team was fantastic, imo they'd win a title in most normal seasons where a 73 win team doesn't add an MVP.  Again, context matters. Titles aren't the be all end all, otherwise Russell is the best player ever and it isn't close."
"The Raptors won the 1996 NBA lottery but the NBA put in a rule that neither the Raptors nor Grizzlies were allowed to draft 1st overall as a result of the Magic's early success. The highest either team could have drafted was 2nd overall. We could have had Iverson instead of Camby.  The Raptors also won the 2006 NBA lottery. This time they were allowed to draft 1st overall. However, the 2006 NBA draft was the first draft that blocked high school players from entering. Who graduated from high school in 2006? Greg Oden and Kevin Durant.  There's no reason to think that the Raptors would have drafted Durant over Oden but if they had Oden a year earlier, maybe they spot his knee issues earlier too. Oden played heavy minutes in college."
"&gt; He's carried the likes of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, and Kawhi Leonard to their rings   Yep, its a real tough one to figure out"
"I think a good indicator for casual fans is jersey sales. This was the list for top jersey sales in 2020:   LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers   Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks   Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers   Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics   Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks   Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors   Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets   Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers   Kawhi Leonard, LA Clippers   Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat   Kemba Walker, Boston Celtics   Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets   Russell Westbrook, Houston Rockets   Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets   Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies   Literally none of these are inefficient scorers that don’t do much else."
Greatest Wizard ever - Unseld/Hayes  Greatest player to be a Wizard - MJ  edit:   Nets - Jason Kidd and Kevin Durant
"Why do you think Kevin Durant went to Golden State?   He's pretty sensitive on social media and the lack of titles hurt him. So, he took an opportunity during the free agency to join them. And he was twice the Finals MVP, meaning he was a huge part of this success and there were tough confrontations, especially against Houston in 2017. In that confrontation, the Rockets were one injury away (CP3) from the Finals. So, it's our fault that players believe titles are the only thing that matter and are ready to create super teams (thank you free agency) and win.   You know what? I love it."
Kevin Durant - Billy Donovan
"I'd probably be considered a ""LeBron stan"".  LeBron is not a better player because Chris Bosh got a rebound in game 6 against San Antonio. He's not a better player because Kyrie Irving hit a 3 while Steph Curry missed like 4 of them. He's not a WORSE player because Kevin Durant signed with Golden State. He wouldn't be a better player if Wade hit his last second bank shot in game 2 in 2011.  Yes, winning championships is the goal, but it's still a shitty way to evaluate players."
"Kevin durant joining the warriors, again"
Marial Shayok is kevin Durant
"How about Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green? Maybe not the efficiency, but he also is an exponentially better playmaker."
Kevin Durant to Oklahoma City
&gt; Because they performed at a higher level with a shittier team  But they didn't lmao. There's zero argument for Kevin Durant being definitely better given his playoff performance without the most stacked team of all time surrounding him.
Yeah he would definitely be better than Kevin Durant
"If Kevin Durant never joined the Warriors, Stephen Curry would've been known as the greatest scorer of all time.  Steph would've had at least 5 more seasons where he performed like his unanimous MVP season and the seasons after that, he'd still be amazing."
MVP: Steph Curry  FMVP: Kevin Durant  DPOY: Ben Simmons  ROTY: Bol Bol (NBA said bubble rookies would count)  MIP: Mo Bamba  6MOY: Tyler Herro
"Clay Bennett could not find any public funding for a new arena, so he and his group decided to move the team to OKC to his hometown. If you are owner or majority owner you can do whatever you want. OKC is able fill the arena each year, and it does help with young Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka.   It will be interesting to see going forward if those fans will still come to fill the arena when Sam Presti attempt to gut the roster. There won't be any new team for NBA, but maybe one of these team who are not happy in their market, and find Seattle market viable to go through the moving process."
They also changed it up 5 years ago because Kevin Durant was doing that rip through move which made it basically impossible to keep your arms near the ball or body him up
Kevin Durant is the less atheltic but more skilled version of Anthony Davis.
"Man, imagine a healthy Roy with LMA and instead of Oden, Kevin Durant."

"Joel Embiid didn't start playing basketball until he was 15  Muggsy Bogues didn't grow past 5'3"" and he averaged 9 APG for 5+ years in Charlotte  Isaiah Thomas is 5'8"" and he received MVP votes in his peak  Allen Iverson is one of the greatest of all time at 5'11""  Don't let these guys tell you what you can or cannot do. You don't have to be as big as Kevin Durant or Lebron James. 'Small' people like Ty Lawson, Brandon Jennings have made it big.  Good luck, looking forward to see you on that court in a few years."
Kevin Durant. I legit thought he would be way too skinny and get pushed around. I was wrong. Very wrong.
"Kevin Durant for sure. One, obviously because of the move to Golden State, and two because of the injury. People either brush off or don’t realize how good he is. He’s one of the best scorers of all-time and he definitely isn’t treated like it."
I liked KD but fully supported Portland’s decision to draft Greg Oden. I thought Kevin Durant was too skinny and didn’t realize he would become arguably the first or second best player in the world.
"He played some pretty great stretches of defense on the warriors. Not saying he's a top-10 defender, but he has been a good defender.

They play nice for the cameras because they’re professionals not trying to cause trouble for their teams. I think someone’s just a little salty that OKC couldn’t get past LeBron in 2013 or that they blew a 3-1 lead in 2016. Too bad you don’t have a banner to cry into because your only championship was won 41 years ago for a city that’s 1500 miles away and doesn’t even hang in your arena.

What about fuck Kevin Durant?
"KAT is not a top 15 player. He isn't top 20.

That's twenty and I have another dozen who might be better."
"Averaging it out based on rank, this is the positioning of everyone who qualified for both sides, ordered tie-breakers by higher peak.   1.0 - LeBron James (1/1)  4.0 - Steph Curry (2/6)  5.5 - Chris Paul (7/4)  6.0 - Kawhi Leonard (10/2)  6.5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo (3/10)  6.5 - Russell Westbrook (5/8)  6.5 - Kevin Durant (8/5)  6.5 - James Harden (6/7)  7.0 - Nikola Jokic (11/3)  9.0 - Anthony Davis (9/9)  15.5 - Derrick Rose (20/11)  15.5 - Jimmy Butler (15/16)  18.0 - Kyrie Irving (16/20)  18.5 - Draymond Green (25/12)  19.0 - Paul George (17/21)  23.5 - Kyle Lowry (23/24)"
"What is this take? Is there a gm in the league who would take a PG who literally can't shoot the basketball  over devin Booker who is shooting at a 61% TS clip?? Booker isn't just perimeter he hits mid ranges pull ups with ease. He can also drive faily well. Not only is he shooting 61% ts but hes doing it on 26.6 ppg and hes only 24. This is a really really bad take tbh. Like seriously who would take Simmons over a player shooting 61% ts on 26 ppg? That's like saying you wouldn't  take Kevin Durant over Russell westbrooks because westbokk plays better d even tho he can't shoot worth his life and can only drive. Bad bad take   I mean just switch the two players teams and think. Philly would get a player who can handle the ball and hit a shot from anywhere on the court. Remeber devin Booker's clutch shots he hit in the bubble? Ben hits exactly 0 of those. Philly gets a player that is shooting lights out to pair next to Embiid and Harris and all the sudden you have 3 players who can make shots from almost anywhere on the floor. The booker/embiid pick andnrool would be nasty. Now but Simmons on Phoenix, odds are they are in the exact same mediocre position with Simmons. Except instead of a fucking baller they can build around they have a pg who can't shoot.   Dont forget Simmons free throws either. Not only can he not hit jump shots hes not a good free throw shooter either. Hes a liability on the court when the game is close and you need a bucket under a minute. Booker on the other hand hits his free throws at over 90%. Combime that with his insane shooting percentages and it's clear who you'd rather have on the court in the final minutes of a close game"
"I was curious so I searched single season and playoff BPMs, here's what they consider the ""top 25"" in each, I think averaging it would produce a pretty decent list.

"&gt;Also our stars are like 24 and most of our team is 20-22 so he doesn't match anyone's timeline.  I'm not picking on you specifically, but when did this ""timeline"" nonsense become so prevalent?  You know who else's ""timelines don't match""?  LeBron's and Davis'.  Do you think anyone in the Lakers' organization cares right now?  No.  You know who else were mismatched?  Kareem and Magic.  Anyone care?  Nope.  Leonard and Duncan.  Wade and O'Neal.  Many others.  No one is going to be able to build a team composed of players all the same age, and be good enough to matter.  And even if they do, it's unlikely to matter, since they probably won't be able to keep the team together anyway.  See Kobe-O'Neal, Wade-James-Bosh, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and many other examples.  If you can acquire good to great players, you do so.  You win, if you can, and worry about timelines never.  The NBA is a league where almost any significantly-above average player can demand a trade or otherwise force their way off your team -- and contracts aren't very long in the first place.  Any GM passing up acquiring talent because ""timelines don't match"" should be fired immediately."

"Here's a source, apparently teams automatically take out a policy on all their large contracts:  [That's because of an insurance policy that pays 80 percent of a player's salary if they remain on the sideline with the same injury for 41 games.

"I never said you were a hater. I just said you share the same mentality as the haters. So stop putting words in *my* mouth. And yes it’s possible to share the same mentality as a hater and not be a hater.   Secondly, I never said the 2011 team wasn’t amazing, I said the 2010 wasn’t amazing. LeBron *joined* a team that was worse than the team Kevin Durant joined. That’s all I’m saying. You’re acting like they were the same but the truth is they weren’t that’s all.   And you’re forgetting that the whole point of this argument is simply to prove that given equal pieces, LeBron would have more rings than KD. There’s enough evidence to support it that’s facts."

Allen Iverson would have to be the 5th option, his skill-set isn't even useful at that point.    Even something like this:   Steph Curry, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwan  On a pure talent level it hardly seems fair, but the fit is so much more balanced. It's also better-suited to the modern game."
And Kevin Durant picked his nose on live TV
Arch Rival?? Lmao no.   The only comparable players in the 10s to Lebron was Kevin Durant. Curry averaged 30 points ONE time in his career and people hopped on his dick like he was the next MJ
"Calling guys like Kevin Durant and Josh Smith ""swing men"" doesn't make much sense considering they played way more minutes at 4 than 2 in their careers."
"Hakeem, tim duncan, kevin durant, larry bird, steph curry?"
"Magic Johnson, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajwuon  IMO this team wins in 7. Shaq's team is consistent of too many ISO scorers and a post-up bully, all legendary in their own right no doubt but on the same team this would be a disaster if it were a competitive series and not just an All Star game. I am assuming that Lebron is running the point here.  I would believe we'd see Bird v Jordan which IMO is price of admission alone these two would just battle each other. They'll both get their numbers and I feel like they cancel each other out so it comes down to the match up of the other 4. I really don't think that you'd put Lebron on Bird because he's the only one who can match up with Duncan. If Shaq's team had somebody like KG or even Karl Malone then Lebron is a different story.  Who is AI going to guard on this team? He's a score first guard as is MJ and Kobe and AI v Magic is a complete mismatch, AI is giving up almost a foot of height and 60 pounds of weight on the guy with one of the greatest handles of all time who would straight up bully Ai with his size and weight advantage. I think that Magic would run rings around this team. You've got three point threats in KD and Bird which spreads the floor and you've got Hakeem and Duncan to work in the paint against Shaq and presumably Lebron and then you could post Magic up against AI to zero resistance.  Who is going to stop KD from going off? You can't put Lebron on him because Duncan will feast all night long and Duncan can lock down Lebron and switch up on Shaq, Lebron can't stop Hakeem on a rotation. I feel like KD is near unstoppable playing against Shaq's team and Kobe even said KD was the toughest player he ever had to guard and never figured him out.  IDk, I'm just a nuffy that doesn't know anything but I feel like the above team can beat Shaq's in a competitive series."
2016 Steph - 2019 Paul George - 2014 Durant - 2016 Draymond - 2004 Kevin Garnett   They would rip this team up with outside shooting and could pack the paint on the other side of the court to limit Shaq &amp; Bron.
"&gt;Remember, the Thunder could have kept him by (i) not prioritizing Serge Ibaka or (ii) amnestying Perkins.  If I remember he was a restricted FA next summer. They could have done nothing and ran it back (at the risk of losing him in 2013.) Or paid him the 60 million over 4 after he rejected 52 million over 4. (That is cheap even with the lux tax and 4 more years of improving play.)   My thought process at the time. He was a former top 3 pick who improved every year until that finals appearance.   Yeah he fucked up, but he still had room to grow as a 22 year old behind Westbrook and Sefalosha. And that was his best year to date as a 22 year old.  People back then brought up Lamb and Kevin Martin. But Lamb was a rookie who needed time to develop. And Martin had his best days behind him and I've seen him as injury prone.  Harden was excelling as the top backup in the league (he won sixth man then.) And that's worth more than Perkins or Ibaka. The Miami Heat just won with small ball play.   I wish I can find my comments from back then. People were arguing against me too thinking it was a clear win-win for both sides.  I didn't think he would be this good now (As an MVP type player). But his play from 2013 and 2014 is what I saw what he could be if he didn't have Westbrook as the primary ballhandler, Durant as the no1, in front of him and more of a green light."
Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. They both lead and take turns coaching
[Literally all Kevin Durant has to do it shoot over a player 10 inches shorter...he’s a bum.](https://amp.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/797mjq/kyle_lowry_great_postdefense_against_kd_and/)
"Not at all. I consider it to be pretty useless.  Kevin Durant on the Warriors, on-off net rating, full seasons.  - 16-17: +8.6  - 17-18: +1.9  - 18-19: +16.1  Those are large as fuck sample sizes that say he was very good one year, then slightly above average the next, then GOAT level the next. But he actually was very consistent as a player."
*Kevin Durant loudly eats chips and chuckles in the distance*
"They can if they pose a significant attacking threat similar to Russell Westbrook. He was horseshit tier from mid and long-range for his entire career but was an MVP level player at his peak, even rivaling Kevin Durant in terms of impact during some of those OKC playoff runs."
idk why but 'Kevin Durant' is the most basketball player name ive ever heard.
"Durant is the better player, skill wise anyhow. For now Kobe is above with 5 rings but lets see how many more chips Kevin gets before it's all over."
"Kevin Durant got a max with the Nets after tearing his ACL, Howard got a max after coming off a back injury as well. Giannis is younger and has 2 MVP's under his belt, some team will give him a max. The question is does he want a max or a supermax?"
*squinting* is that Kevin Durant I see?
"Definitely better  1. ‘13 LeBron James 2. ‘91 Michael Jordan 3. ‘00 Shaquille O’Neal 4. ‘94 Hakeem Olajuwon 5. ‘72 Kareem Abdul Jabbar  On the same level as   5. ‘87 Magic Johnson 6. ‘62 Bill Russell 7. ‘67 Wilt Chamberlain 8. ‘03 Tim Duncan   I guess you could argue  1. ‘08 Kobe Bryant 2. ‘04 Kevin Garnett 3. ‘94 David Robinson 4. ‘Some Jerry West season 5. ‘09 Dwyane Wade 6. ‘17 Kevin Durant 7. ‘86 Larry Bird  Just my opinion, could definitely see arguments claiming otherwise."
Didn’t know Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson were mutated and fused together while also sharing the same kinetic chain
One of the best offenses ever when they got rolling.  Fuck Kevin Durant.

It was 10 years ago that LeBron and company formed a superteam in Miami and Kevin Durant (Cue Palapatine saying “ironic” meme) and others chastised them for having to try to team up to beat Kobe and his back-to-back champion Lakers.  Time is a circle.
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant.
"Atlanta Hawks - Dominique Wilkins   Boston Celtics - Bill Russell   Brooklyn Nets - Jason Kidd   Charlotte Hornets - Alonzo Mourning   Chicago Bulls - Michael Jordan   Cleveland Cavaliers - Lebron James   Dallas Mavericks - Dirk Nowitzki   Denver Nuggets - Carmelo Anthony   Detroit Pistons - Isiah Thomas   Golden State Warriors - Stephen Curry   Houston Rockets - Hakeem Olajuwon   Indiana Pacers - Reggie Miller   Los Angeles Clippers - Chris Paul   Los Angeles Lakers - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar   Memphis Grizzlies - Marc Gasol   Miami Heat - Lebron James   Milwaukee Bucks - Oscar Robertson   Minnesota Timberwolves - Kevin Garnett   New Orleans Pelicans - Anthony Davis   New York Knicks - Walt Frazier   Oklahoma City Thunder - Kevin Durant   Orlando Magic - Shaquille O'Neal   Philadelphia 76ers - Julius Erving   Phoenix Suns - Charles Barkley   Portland Trail Blazers - Bill Walton   Sacramento Kings - Chris Webber   San Antonio Spurs - Tim Duncan   Toronto Raptors - Vince Carter   Utah Jazz - John Stockton   Washington Wizards - Wes Unseld     There's a few I could probably be persuaded away from, but I think this is a decent list. I could see Kareem as the Bucks greatest and Magic or Kobe as the Lakers greatest and I know there'll be some DWade lovers. Frazier over Ewing is close, I gave him the edge for winning a championship."
Lebron wanted to go  Bosh stayed  Wade wanted to stay and get paid because he took pay cuts during the big 3 era except Pat wouldn't budge.   The Heat didn't want to budge with Wade and instead tried to lure in Kevin Durant. Wade felt slighted and left because he was offered more money by CHI.   What you said is nonsensical.
"I made a similar poll a few weeks ago that I wanted to work down through the NBA, but my 2nd poll got deleted pretty quickly so I gave up. The voting results for the top 3 most valuable had these results:  1. Luka Doncic 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo 3. LeBron James 4. Steph Curry 5. James Harden 6. Anthony Davis 7. Nikola Jokic 8. Kawhi Leonard 9. Kevin Durant 10. Damian Lillard/Zion Williamson (tied)"
"Great news, a healthy Kevin Durant will take us from the 7 seed to the 4 seed. Now I can sleep at night"
But you guys make fun of when Kevin Durant cares about what random scrubs think about Him
Kevin Durant during last years playoffs was INSANE. I looked like he wasn’t even trying and was destroying teams
Yeah I’m over it too didn’t you read my book? Forgive not forget. The nba was hot garbage and a waste of time and energy from 2017-2019 because of Kevin Durant. There’s just no way around that
"&gt; Curry is one of the best passers in league history idk what you’re talking about.  lmfao. Are you serious? One of the best passers in HISTORY?? dude he's not even one of the best passers in the league right now.   He averaged 5-6 assists per game standing next to Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant. How can you possibly keep a straight face and say Curry is one of the best passers in history? Like what  &gt;And the reason he doesn’t have a FMVP is because he’s been robbed twice, that’s an irrelevant point.  He hasn't been robbed a single time. He underperforms because the other teams play focus D on Curry specifically, because he's the biggest threat on the court."
Even before the next games(would’ve been bad if he played like ass lmao) at that point he was nothing but factual. He’s been doing for more than a decade. He’s mother fucking Kevin Durant
"Yeah that’s why you shouldn’t have joined a 73 win team you pathetic little bitch. The hatred I have for Kevin Durant used to be dangerous. It would keep me awake at night, it would get me out of bed in the morning. Then at a Nuggets game last year pregame I walked right past security and waited for my opportunity. He was talking to some fan while warming up so I just run right up to him and start unleashing. I had been practicing this soliloquy toying with different lines for literally years and now finally here was my chance. I screamed right in his face that he was the greatest scorer I had ever seen in my life, that got his attention. And then I proceeded to absolutely eviscerate him, calling him the biggest pussy in sports and telling him millions of Americans are wasting their time and money watching the nba because of what he did, got escorted out of Pepsi center pretty quick. I told him he was fucking pathetic and that the basketball gods would have their way with him. After this encounter my hatred for him dissipated a lot. The fucking smirk on his face just made me realize this dude is a little kid. He’s a super self conscious little six year old boy stuck in the body of the greatest scorer of all time. Just weeks later his Achilles blew out"
Nah Bev was the one who was like 'he's Kevin Durant'. Both of them give props to KD and his skill
"Durant is not “quite possibly the best scorer of all time,” he’s not the best scorer of all time. He averages 27 ppg for his career, with 32 ppg being his career high for both a playoffs and regular season. MJ averaged 31.5 ppg in his years in chicago and 30.1 including his 38 and 39 year old seasons in Washington. Career highs of 37 during the season and 44 during a playoff run. And before you bring in efficiency, in 89 Jordan averaged more than Durant has ever averaged (32.5) on 2% less TS... it was his 5th best scoring season ever. And let’s not even talk about volume scoring, where Durant’s career high is 52... Jordan has scored over 50 pts 31 times (Durant 6), and has 25 games with more than 52.   Now that zoomer argument is out of the way, Durant at best is a marginally better scorer than Kobe, but solely because he’s more efficient. Kobe, like Jordan, is a much better high volume scorer. And while scoring efficiently may be enough of an argument for you, we are comparing a man who has 0 nba defensive team selections to one that has 9 nba first teams alone; there has not been a point in KD’s career where he was as good of a defender as Kobe at age 32, much less in his prime. Not to mention that Kobe was a better passer (ik this one might be hard to get for the zoomers reading this) averaging a full assist more than KD from age 19-30 (KD’s career) on 0.1 less turnovers. Throw in the fact that by 09 he had clearly shown he was the best player in the entire league, something KD has yet to prove to anyone at any point in his career.   Talent doesn’t mean shit if it doesn’t equate to production. NBA teams win off production. Kevin Durant has been an incredibly productive player in his career, enough to make him a top 15-20 player of all time, but he did not have the production, especially at both ends of the floor, as Kobe"
"yeah take some humility lessons from Kevin ""Burner Account"" Durant"
"This is a silly and irrational take. It was a lousy thing for those fans to do but you’re ignoring context. In the lead up to the series and all series long the narrative in US Media and on here was that Kevin Durant was going to come back and the Raptors would be bounced (and they may have). He sort of became the boogeyman and he’d do warm up then sit, or say he was coming back and then not. When he went down, it looked harmless without super slow-mo, and I think there was a sense of relief from fans that the narrative wasn’t going to continue or that even the holy Warriors were fallible.  Should Canadians write off every citizen of the United States and wished them purgatory for voting in Donald Trump or for the Haditha massacre, or all the other horrific shit that has had actual impact on humanity and not arbitrary shit like professional sports?  Give me a break. Some fans let the emotion of the series get to them and cheered and it was in poor taste. KD didn’t even want to play for your franchise anymore. Move on."
Kevin Durant traded back to the Warriors for Kevon Looney
Jeff Green and Kevin Durant are the only NBA players left in the league that have played for the Seattle SuperSonics.  That is my favorite Jeff Green comment.
"That ""only one ring"" was arguably the best of his career. He carried the Cavs from 1-3 to a game 7 win.  The previous season, both Kyrie and Love were injured, then the next two seasons, his help was worse, while the Warriors added this random dude called Kevin Durant, so can't fault him for losing those two series either when he did all he could.  That said that ""only one"" championship was the first and so far only title in Cavaliers history, and ended a 52 year drought in Cleveland sports.  I do agree right now Steph is probably more loved in Golden State than LeBron is in Cleveland, but you're kinda making it sound like LeBron is still hated over there."
This speech was so unwarranted and so uncalled for... not a single person in the country forgot about Kevin Durant and nobody in their right mind thought they were going to lose to the Clippers of all teams lol.... dude just wanted to say some extra shit to sound like a badass.... this whole interview is a huge cringe
I don’t think the injury makes him unproven. I’m betting he’s still Kevin Durant but you never know
Kevin Durant
"The forward/PF level is the key for Team Kevin (the McHale/Garnett team is far better than Cage/Thompson are), but its countered by the Michaels being better than the Kevins at guard (Martin wouldn't have a prayer at Jordan, and depending on which Michael you pick, the Mikes have it [Conley and KJ are pretty even, with a pre-drug abuse Richardson being better than KJ was.)   The big key would be what you do with the small forward, and honestly Jordan's likely savvy enough to put himself on Durant and leave Porter for Martin, which is an even match [and in addition, the Michaels would have Michael Adams, Michael Redd, and Mike Bibby to keep giving fits to Martin.)"
"Kevin Durant actually bought a house on Mercer Island (one of the wealthiest Seattle suburbs—Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos both live there) during his rookie season with the Sonics and didn’t actually sell it until a few years after the relocation. He bought it in 2007 as a rookie and sold it in 2013, so I’m guessing from the timing that was because he was waiting for the market to rebound."
"You're arguing that  Russell Westbrook is ""trash"" because the OKC (with KD as their leader) lost to the Warriors after being down 3-1. You also believe Kevin Durant is ""flat out better"" than LeBron James because Warriors swept Cavs.  I can't argue with that logic. I rest my case."
Kevin Durant and it's not even close. Giannis can't even create his own shot in the 4th quarter of a close playoff game. Stop the disrespect please.
"I don’t know. Garnett was a psycho, too. And that team having two top 20 players all time that Jordan couldn’t really guard really does swing it.   I think Jordan would do everything humanly (and inhumanly) possible to will his team to victory, and would certainly beat the hell out of Kevin Martin or whatever because he’d make up some random slight in his head, but man Durant and Garnett would have been absurd together. Add some shooters around them and you’re solid."
You must’ve forgotten his SI cover about it lol  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2013/04/23/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-illustrated-cover
"You must’ve missed this article that was on the cover of Sports Illustrated in which he talks about how he’s obsessed with becoming better than LeBron, detailing that he always looks at LeBron’s box score and thinks about how he achieved those stats that game:   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2013/04/23/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-illustrated-cover  Edit: notice that he makes a point to say that he doesn’t watch a lot of other basketball away from the gym"

"It's tough to make an all star team out of Utah over Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Blake Griffin, LaMarcus Aldridge and Tim Duncan and Zach Randolph."
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook"
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant
"Ah yes, Kevin Durant died right?"
Kevin Durant
We all underestimated how delusional Kevin durant is
Well then your point makes no sense it's hypocritical. The Thunder were too inexperienced...   Ben Simmons 22/ Russ 22  Joel Embid 24/ Kevin Durant 23  Giannis 24?   Like how you going to say Thunder still very young when All the people you named besides Butler are very young!?  Makes sense no credit to the Mavs guess they just wanted it more..🙄
Looking forward to watching the Hawks.  Think they can sneak in at 8th.  Besides that it's gotta be the Nets for me.  If Kevin Durant is healthy I think he's my favorite non-blazers player to watch play bar maybe Steph.  He just feels unfair sometimes
"AD - Been in talks before, probably could make it again, but it depends.  Giannis - I feel as if few are expecting him to go for a third time, but I think he has a chance.  Luka - No doubt, definitely talented enough to pull it off.  Dark Horse - Kevin Durant. Coming back, fresh new start, definitely feel as if he could come back and dominate in the East."
Kevin Durant...
"Maths have a funny way of working like that.  For instance, LeBron James was the same age last season as Bill Russell during his 1969 Championship run. Kevin Durant is the same age as Kobe Bryant during his 2010 Championship run. Jayson Tatum is the same age as nobody because he's the only zygote to play in the NBA"
"Yeah Im not going to blame someone for taking a quarter billion dollars but you keep seeing these 2+1 type signings because of the flexibility option. It's also one of those things, if its a career ending injury then yeah youre fucked, but you saw even with 31 year old Kevin Durant torn achilles he still got his max just fine when you are that good even if you suffer a major injury youll still get the $$ you want."
"That’s not a 4 anymore. The league has changed, in case you didn’t notice. Tatum is a 4, and so is Kevin Durant.   Having a center who can pass, shoot 3s, and move around the court is everyone’s dream. Excuse everyone for wanting to see Blake try that late in his career when nothing else is working."
"&gt; We have such wealth of resources available to us, yet we still stick by our narratives like we did 50 years ago.  Many fans enjoy the NBA in a way that's largely configured by narratives. If you're not from Cleveland, why root for Lebron against the Warriors? 'Because Lebron is a home-town hero leading a scrappy team against the Coastal Elite, which now features the Snake Kevin Durant.' That's how a lot of people enjoy the game. And until the major awards are tailored more narrowly, to things like the 'PPG' award or 'Defensive plus/minus' award, they're going to stay open to interpretation. And now despite the rise of advanced analytics, these non-technical and impressionistic takes remain a big part of the NBA as a commodity. At a certain point, you have to acknowledge that the fuzziness and room for disagreement is there by design, not by accident."
Based god curse is why he did not make an all-nba team that year. Let it be a lesson to all others. Kevin Durant had to join Lil B’s hometown Golden State Warriors to get the curse removed.
i see shades of kevin durant in his social media game
Kevin Durant averages at least 27 ppg
OP: KD is short for Kevin Durant.  He is the star player on the Brooklyn Nets. Bruno currently plays for the Houston Rockets after being traded from the Memphis Grizzlies this past season.  MVP is short for Mildly Vexing Player.
You can always go with putting AD on guys like jimmy butler. Only superstar 3 that I think AD would have a tough time with is Kevin Durant
Lol ofc it’s a guy with Kevin Durant in his name going around arguing that the lakers are a superteam
"No, our competition was much tougher. The Bucks and even the injured Warriors were better than any team the Lakers faced last season. Even the Sixers were probably similarly as good as the Rockets.   The only reason we won the championship was Kevin Durant missing all but like 10 minutes of the Finals, but that doesn't change the fact that they faced two teams tougher than the hardest Lakers competition last season."
Nets should be tier one because they have Kevin freaking Durant
"Kevin Durant never won a ring without Draymond Green, Draymond won without Kevin. Case closed.   I’d still take Duncan but that’s a silly argument imo lol."
"Facts.  We were paying dudes like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili all those years. Would've been hard to sign them because of that, as well as the fact that a star isn't coming to San Antonio to break that core up in their prime.  and when we landed LMA, we only had like five players on guaranteed contracts so we had a bunch of cap space. It lined up nicely. and next offseason we have the potential to have an absolute shitload more cap space than that year, with free agency being absolutely stacked too.  Not to mention some players like Jason Kidd, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving and Paul George have shown interest in wanting to come here at points in their careers."

"Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Kevin Durant, Dame Dillard, Nikola Jokic."
"I do agree that KD's passing is a bit overrated, especially in GS's system where he was surrounded by 2 of the best shooters ever  AD's only really had 1 or 2 good passing seasons though (basically 2019 and 2020) and he's still got a lot of room to improve there - his passes can be a bit soft, he misses openings, he can be a bit inaccurate etc.  Durant meanwhile is far from elite, hes got very spotty vision, but he's got most of the basic reads down pat and is a good enough playmaker that he can run a strong offense as lead initiator *(~ +3 rORTG)* like we saw in okc whenever russ was injured https://backpicks.com/2018/03/05/backpicks-goat-26-kevin-durant/"
Westbrook will be traded and proves everyone who doubted him wrong same as Cp3.  Ben simmons wins DPOY.  Kevin Durant or Giannis win MVP.  There are significantly more injuries than usual and the champion is decided by a major injury.

Kevin Durant
"Like former DPOY candidate Kevin Durant. Atrocious defender. And before people come saying he hasn’t made a defensive team so how could he have been a DPOY candidate, he very clearly was in the running throughout the majority of the year in 2018"
They drafted Kevin Durant and it's been a wrap ever since.
"I think this is the real thing. He’s 100000% good enough to be the best player on a championship team but he needs a better co star or just better players to support his abilties. His game is still improving as well so he’ll learn to play to any weaknesses his team might have but there’s just too many teams right now that have more than he does and that’s no knock on the bucks or Giannis for that matter; ive loved that dude since Draft night. I really wanted the cs to take him but we took ducking Kelly Ilynk. He looked like Kevin Durant to me, I kinda figured he’d be a sure thing once he got older just because of that lol but I was also a pretty new fan at the time."
"He will speak about how his best player in the world "" Kevin Durant "" and BK are gonna beat Lebron and the lakers in the finals. Then someway down the line , injuries will occur cause well Kyrie and KD. Then it will be like "" Cakewalk baby Cakewalk for the washed king ""."
words cannot describe how ready I am to see Kevin Durant play for the Nets
He gave Kevin Durant a very solid team to compete and we’re definitely favorites to win for most years of his prime. Not his fault either injuries plagued the team or KD straight up choked. I don’t understand why he gets blamed for not getting a ring
"Yes they did. Both of those things happened. But Kevin Durant is unlikely to play with Westbrook ever again. And idk, I think having Kevin Durant on your team has more to do with that. I love westbrook, but at this point in his career I don’t want him on my team. I can understand if you would though and I respect that.  Also, instrumentals from my moms christmas party?"
Kevin Durant coming off a blown Achilles
Adding Kevin Durant to your rotation is the biggest single increase a team has made compared to last season
kevin durant going to golden state
"When it comes to Hayward. Good for him. Get paid. The one that needs to look themselves in the mirror is Danny Ainge. Letting him walk out the door and getting nothing in return, even though it was obvious Hayward did everything to try and help him do that. Now there down what could have been a key contributor and can't do shit to replace him cuz they have, I believe, absolutely no cap space. All this talk all these years about the Celtics and there assets was blown way the fuck up. If they aren't in the top 5 they can't draft for shit, and even when they have money to spend the best the can do is Hayward, Kemba, and Al Horford. Good players, but not going to make you championship contenders. Tatum now needs to become Kevin Durant 2.0 and Brown needs to morph into a Kawhi clone for them to have any kind of shot at winning a title with this team. Help isn't coming."
"Rudderless flow? Why would the Thunder have a rudderless flow? Tanking doesn’t mean there’s no plan in place. Presti is well known for being extremely open and communicative with his players. He made sure long ago that Shai, CP3, and everyone else knew exactly what their plans are. CP3 basically confirmed that with his pseudo farewell video two months ago.  Shai knows what the plan is. Presti has earned the trust of the players, and he’s explained to them that this is the best shot at building a true contender. The Thunder have a strong team culture, one of the best front offices in the league, and a ton of draft and trade assets, they’re not suddenly going to turn into the Kings. I see very little reason to fear that they’ll be irrelevant for more than a few years.  Did being bad early in a career damage Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Did it damage Devin Booker? Being on a bad team doesn’t suddenly turn players into losers, especially if the front office shows it has a plan."
32 year old busted Achilles Kevin Durant will not be the second best player in the league
Heard of Kevin Durant?
Center was our biggest need and Perkins started on a championship team. That's not a bad trade at all and I dont think we regret it. Frankly I think you're being a revisionist. The extension was questionable but we were operating under the belief that we'd still have enough until the rose rule retroactively kicked in paying Durant several million more per season. [The nba eventually reimbursed us](https://www.google.com/amp/s/oklahoman.com/article/3863784/okc-thunder-nba-reimburses-thunder-for-part-of-kevin-durants-contract-extension/amp) but it really didn't matter by then.   On top of this we had a deal for Tyson Chandler that was veto'd in 2009 because he failed a psychical.
Lebron and Kevin Durant
After one year with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant the Nets fired their head coach
Kevin Durant left his excellent young team to join the team that knocked him out of the playoffs who had just won an nba record 73 regular season games then called it the hardest road because people would hold him accountable for it
Nba champion Kevin Durant
"You don’t need to undersell what Kawhi did in order to say he isn’t the best player in the league.   He beat the warriors without Kevin Durant, yes. Klay Thompson got hurt in game 6 though, and the Raptors won in 6, the Warriors didn’t play the entire series without him. That same durantless warriors team hadn’t lost a game since Durant got injured, winning the last two games against the rockets, and sweeping the blazers in the WCF.   Kawhi’s 2019 playoffs was a legendary run, he and the raptors beat three championship calibre teams."
He also didn’t have Kevin Durant on his rockets team.  Durant was understandably getting the majority of touches whereas in Houston Harden could play freely.
nah if he played like kevin durant in his final games during the 16 playoffs he couldve been a champ
"I suppose you can argue it’s the organizations fault for having the pieces in play for this to occur, BUT they did not account for Kevin Durant being the least respected loser pussy human of all time that ultimately cost them the opportunity of winning a chip"
Kevin Durant is better than Kobe Bryant who in turn is better than Tim Duncan.
"He joined a 73 win team. If final MVPs are the reason for you taking him then quite frankly you’re one of the idiots that completely ignores any sort of context and has a RINGZZZ mentality   Hell even when KD has a 73 win team around his his team was still down 3-2 to James harden and Chris Paul in 2018. In game 6 when the warriors were down double digits at half with Chris Paul our for Houston it wasn’t Kevin durant who sparked the comeback in that game, it was the dude’s he joined. The dude’s that beat Kevin durant making him want to join them. The single biggest game throughout the entire KD golden state run and the only time they ever faced adversity and it wasn’t KD who got it done when things were really looking bad.   Kevin durant was a front runner. A guy who knew that he wouldn’t get half the defensive attention that any other star in the league gets and knew that titles were a guarantee no questions asked lock to happen if he joined there.   Before KD joined them they won 67 games, a title, 73 games made back to back to finals and came 6 points away from back to back championships. Oh yeah they also beat Kevin Durant who had the following seasons MVP on his team.   Including regular season and playoffs the warriors went 33-5 with curry and no KD in the 3 year run they had together. They didn’t need Kevin durant to win titles and those finals MVPs are a joke. I watched the cavs defenders rather let durant get wide open transition layups than an open curry or Klay  three. He never received as much defensive attention as any other star in the league and didn’t even get the same kind of defensive attention his teammate curry had.    But whatever. “He has finals MVPs so he’s better”. I’m glad to know that you also by the same logic think Chancey Billsups is better than John Stockton or Andre Igoudala is better than Karl Malone"
"Nah KD is a better fit for any team than Giannis. Dude can post up, attack the basket *and* shoot from pretty much anywhere. People really disrespecting KD since he’s been out man damn.   I’m not taking the piss on Giannis, he’s a monster, but KD is a 7 footer who can shoot 3s. Soon as the freak can start hitting shots from outside the paint/3 point line more consistently then for sure it’s debatable. Plus, he’s still a borderline 60% free throw shooter at best, which teams can expose in the playoffs.   TL:DR: Kevin Durant with the Warriors still gives me nightmares."
Kevin Durant definitely needs to go into color commentating after he retires. Or at least get a reality show.
"This narrative is 100% bullshit, it picked up steam only because of the delusional OKC fans and r/nba hates the media.   Start here: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/  And then here: https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/russell-westbrook-berry-tramel-next-question-2019-playoffs.html"
"“This never happened so your strawman argument is moot, but your point still stands!”   You guys are ridiculous, lol. This sub also defended Westbrooks behavior with the media.  The funniest part is Westbrook was always treated very well by the local media. This is the funny backstory http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/"
Kevin Durant should have [tagged](https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1215075274733379584?s=20) Klay Thompson on this tweet.
Exposing them to your bad coaching and toxic FO. Some organisations can have players leave and still not have anything bad to say about them. The Knicks not so much.  No-one who's close to someone who's been a Knick ever seems to even consider signing there. See also: Kevin Durant.
he  be great as Kevin Durant
Dame/Kyrie/Kemba/Lowry/Paul  Beal/Butler/Mitchell/Booker/CJ  Lebronn/Kawhi/PG  AD///////Blake/Aldridge/Draymond  Towns//Bam  Plus Young/Jaylen/Jayson/Fox/Tobias/Collins/Lavine not even making the team.  And everyone else i forgot about sorry if i forgot someone big  Then plus Kevin Durant and Steph and Klay who are all out right now with injuries.   This series would not be that close.
"No, I'm Kevin Durant"
I love Kevin Durant.
"how else do you reply to the galaxy brain comment of  “you weren’t relevant before you went to golden state”  .. it’s kevin durant, the clown obviously has no basketball sense to make that type of claim."
lmfaoo Kevin Durant loco
Hey it’s me Kevin Durant
Imagine taking time out of your day to tweet Kevin Durant. Couldn’t be me lmao
"It’s Twitter, loosen up. I come here for this action  -Kevin Durant."
Based take.   People on here complain about Kevin Durant going to the Warriors but deep inside most people like watching superteams.   There's not really any superteam this season and that's one reason less people are watching basketball.
KD literally had an SI cover centred around him being second best in 2013. KD and Lebron were far and away considered the two best players in the league from 2012 on by casuals and pundits.  SI Cover: https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/04/23/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-illustrated-cover  For reference that is from 2013 after he had finished second in MVP voting to LeBron for the third time
"Each to their own I guess. I will take the 6""11 guy who can shoot over the league with a far superior efficiency and body of work as a stand alone player.  [Player comparison](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=James+Harden&amp;player_id1_select=James+Harden&amp;player_id1=hardeja01&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players)"
"&gt; There's a very small handful of stars to have constant major injuries and it shows in the fact that you had to span back decades for examples  All it shows is that I spent literally 5 seconds and that's what I came up with. Do you want some more? Here you go: Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Greg Oden, Andrew Bynum, Joakim Noah, Brandon Roy, Gordon Hayward. Again, these are just off the top of my head without doing any research.   There are 100% dudes out there who have suffered multiple major injuries that caused them to miss significant playing time on numerous occasions. AD ain't one of them. He's had a bunch of knick knack injuries, and he did so while being looked after by football specialists in New Orleans (along with a bunch of his teammates who also had a bunch of injuries there: Jrue Holiday, Tyreke Evans, Eric Gordon, etc).   AD definitely is not in the same ""injury prone"" category as most of these other guys. Honestly the worst injuries AD has ever had were a sprained ankle during the first month of his career and knee surgery in 2016 which kept him out of the last 14 games of that season. Other than that, the rest of the injuries he's had have been the kind that have kept him out of like 3 games here or 2 games there. It seems like this current bruise is that type of injury."
you sound dumb acting like it's controversial to pick KEVIN FUCKING DURANT over harden.   Give me KD any day. Especially in the years I mentioned.
There hasn't been a moment probably since each of them were born that James Harden was better at basketball than Kevin Durant
 Thunder small forward Terrance Ferguson is 1-0 against former small forward Kevin Durant this season.
Kevin Durant has torn Achilles
KEVIN DURANT
[Kevin Durant wants to drink Scarlett Johansson’s bathwater](https://twitter.com/kdtrey5/status/26802158502416384?s=21)
"I'm arguing OP's point. That 30 years from now, he'll just be a name with rings and FMVPs.   But the other poster is implying that in the year 2050, if anyone sees the name Kevin Durant, they will immediately know his career history and story arc. Even if they read about it, it won't have the same impact. It will to us, but not some kid."
"I'm not trying to hide anything.   I'm just not ignorant enough to think that a kid born in 2030 is going to have the same reaction to Kevin Durant going to GSW that we did, when he's reading it on Wikipedia.   A 20 year old kid in 2050 won't give a flying fuck about KD. They'll look at his stats, titles, and move on. Unless he goes deep diving into league reactions, hell see that he went to GSW, which created a super team and be done with it.    How many people still hate Scottie for not checking into the game when the play wasn't called for him. We know it happened, and it's mentioned, but it doesn't really register when talking about how great he was.   Dudes on the internet always want their opinions to matter, especially when it's tied to anger. But they dont."
He'd got the trip to the finals for sure.  You don't get to pretend it didn't happen.  And yea Durant was ahead of Westbrook over the 2012 season but about what you'd expect going from #1 to #2 and WB was the facilitator and ran the offense.  https://m.herosports.com/nba/player-comparison/kevin-durant-vs-russell-westbrook  Check out 2012 vs 2012 season stats.  Yall are tripping. Westbrook has been a consistently more valuable player and drug some trash teams to the playoffs. Chris Paul was a monster for us and if he stayed healthy would have cemented himself but availability course and debating random single years is irrelevant.   Russel Westbrook has been the better and more successful player throughout his career and his accolades and accomplisments show this.
"lol y'all are so sensitive. dirk is great, one of the greatest PF's ever. KD is just better, and by a lot. here is an article discussing this comp: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/7/1/20677098/kevin-durant-nets-dirk-nowitzki"
"On the one hand, Kevin Durant.   On the other hand, Demarcus Cousins."
"Big men changed the way they play the game.  Coaches changed the way they call plays, and game plan against the new era of big men.  Kevin Durant literally says he modeled his game after Dirk.  Every big man that shoots 3s nowadays does so because of Dirk.  But yeah, you're right.  He had no impact on the way the game is played."
They have the 2nd best (at least before getting hurt) player in the world coming back next season in Kevin Durant once his Achilles heals (lol)
"I disagree, people started liking LeBron in 2013 when he was still on the Heat because they saw him fall flat on his face in 2011, then scrap and claw his way to a title the following year during a run that featured legendary moments like G6 in Boston after being down in the series, being down 2-1 to the Pacers, and being underdogs against OKC in the Finals.                    Kevin Durant never benefited from that in the same way because GSW immediately and easily won when he joined their already-good team, and they never had any real hurdles to overcome or moments of doubt. His tenure there went exactly as everyone expected."
https://youtu.be/HP9idtV74Rc  LMAO I guess Kevin Durant and Lebron have never played ball in their lives huh? Quit pretending to be a baller.
His team made it to game 6 of the NBA finals and were going to go to game 7 if Klay didn’t get hurt in game 6   He joined a ridiculously stacked team and his legacy is lowered because of it. That team didn’t need Kevin durant to win a championship. They only needed Kevin durant to make the finals not even worth playing because of how unfair the team was
I agree with the first part but how do you explain last year game 6 home court and Houston chokes WITH cp3.   And we didn't have Kevin Durant. Fuck outta here with that cp3 take.
"Steve Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo  They're the best players"
"That post all star game break out was probably what made New Orleans accept the AD trade, more than the lakers getting pick #4. BI’s jump last year was dramatic, he looked like Kevin Durant for about three weeks"
"Yeah Harden deserves way more postseason credit. He was taking on a 73 win team and a championship team that replaced their worst starter with Kevin durant. How the hell do you expect him to beat that? LeBron was getting swept by them, Portland, San Antonio, New Orleans, whoever was in their path got demolished by that golden state team except for Houston. They went up 3-2 on that absolutely ridiculously stacked team until Chris Paul got hurt and I’m still 99% convinced rockets win that series if not for the CP3 injury"
"West got Shaq AND Kobe in one offseason - built that dynasty.  Had his very own run - with a 33 game unbeaten streak, and got his ring  As scout and GM, he played a part in building the Showtime dynasty  Made Memphis into a playoff team.  And then as advisor for GSW , contributed to the key decision to keep Klay and Steph together - and thus was a [contributor](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/heres-what-jerry-west-reportedly-told-kevin-durant-during-his-warriors-pitch/) to that dynasty.  West's success in the NBA is paralleled only by Red Auerbach ...(Bill Russell's celtics)"
Kevin Durant
"You ever watch Chris Paul play? Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Lebron James, and Kevin Durant struggle to post him up.  Kevin Love can't even post up Klay Thompson."
Trae Young’s scoring and passing ability would hugely benefit any 90s team he’s on. He’s Steph Curry meets Steve Nash.  Brandon Ingrams would be one of the best scoring wing players in the 90s. He’s a poor mans Kevin Durant.  Montrezl Harrell likes playing bully ball and he even studied Charles Barkley.   Draymond Green would love to play in the 90s. He’s a point forward with a lot of attitude.
"The NETS added Kyrie and Kevin Durant, not the disfunctional Knicks  Who did the Heat get pre-Lebron? Shaq? Who during that time was the biggest name? Yes it was a trade, but Shaq chose to go to Miami.  You really don’t understand the point of my statement, you jumped on my neck the moment I said LA and NY don’t have the same pull as they once did.  My point is being in a big market city is no longer enough, confidence in front office management is a bigger factor now  Which is why LeBron joined LA and was followed by AD, because the Lakers still had direction  The Clippers wouldn’t get PG and Kawhi if Steve Balmer wasn’t running that team  MIAMI has better direction than the KNICKS. Which is why Jimmy Butler, an all-star, signed with them. And why the Knicks ended up with Randle  I never said the Heat was better than the Lakers, reading comprehension is important"
"2010s had SEVEN different winners: Lakers, Mavericks, Heat 2x, Spurs, Warriors 3x, Cavaliers, and Raptors 1990s had FOUR different winners: Pistons, Bulls 6x, Rockets 2x, Spurs  So parity wise the 2010s wins.  Now competition wise I would say it’s tougher to make the NBA nowadays than back then. The talent pool today is much deeper because their hasn’t been an expansion team since 2003 and the fact that foreigners are coming in and not only rivaling but even surpassing American players.  Better players is debatable but I would say today’s players as a whole are most versatile. You got big men who could shoot 3s, dribble and lead fast breaks like guards and can guard 1-5 effectively.   Name a 90s player similar to LeBron James or Kevin Durant or hell even Giannis Antetokounmpo. These guys would of been seen as aliens back then.   Reggie Miller was considered the premier shooter of his time but in today’s era he would of been a dime of dozen. There’s a handful of dudes that could shoot as well if not better than him with insane volume and accuracy and even shot making difficulty."
thats Kevin Durant tho. Just because their names are Kevin doesn't mean they're the same caliber of players smh
Not sure if your joking but kevin durant
i’m a little nervous about this guy’s frame. very tall and thin and he’s got skinny legs. shaun livingston had a similar shape (albeit shorter) and we know what happened. then again kevin durant has been spared for the most part so who knows
"Not at all, unless Kevin Durant started Shedding his skin like in GSW."
"Kevin Durant, he’s longer/more versatile.  Actually, became a really good defender in Golden State since he was expend less energy on offense compared to when he was in OKC.  Steph Curry on the other hand isn’t a bad defender either, based off everything we know I’d say about average on that end.  The problem w/ Curry is that while he has sound fundamentals &amp; a solid team defender... his frame/measurements have held him back from being anything more than that."
"Eh, Kevin Durant? Kawhi? Harden? They're definitely bigger villains than LeBron and it's not really close."
That’s Kevin Durant by a mile. Not even close.
"These stat comparisons don't take into account the impact of a 7 game series.   Opposition teams formulate and implement strategies designed to contain the team's primary scorers. These strategies are put in place game one and refined over the series as they are revealed to be effective/not effective because you're guaranteed to face the same team at least 4 times in a row.  Take for example Steph Curry - there was a 6% drop in his eFG% between the 2018/19 regular season and 2018/19 Playoffs.   I don't like Kevin Durant for a multitude of reasons, but basing your argument around a drop in eFG% or BPM in the playoffs isn't a silver bullet."
"Kevin Durant? And he even gets into it outside games.   Realistically, how many examples can you think of with Westbrook ? Three? Four? The video of him telling the dude to shut the fuck up and sit with his wife. The Utah situation where the dude said something racist. And now this?"

Shit. Russell Westbrook blows KD completely out of the water here. He dominates everyone not named LeBron in just about every single category. Aside from his abysmal TS%, Russ finishes: 2nd in PER, 1st in OREB%, 2nd best in TRB%, 1st in AST%(by FAR), 1st in STL%, 1st in USG%, 2nd in WS/48, 1st in OBPM, 2nd in DBPM, 2nd in BPM, and 2nd in VORP. In almost EVERY category, Russ is either 1st, or 2nd behind LeBron James. Nobody else even comes close to him in the advanced stats department. Pretty impressive for someone who only pads counting stats at the expense of his team.  &gt;Meanwhile, KD finished: last in PER, 2nd last in TS%, last in ORB%, 3rd in TRB%, last in AST%, last in STL%, tied for 2nd for USG%, last in WS/48, last in OBPM,  2nd last in DBPM, last in BPM, and last in VORP. Hmmm, not what I expected from someone who carried Russ every year. Abysmal showing from KD here.  &gt;So not only was Russ clearly better than KD in terms of counting stats, but he also dominated KD (and everyone else) when looking at their advanced metrics. But of course, stats don't tell the whole story. Let's take a deeper look at each series that year and how both of them performed.  How does this mainly use BPM?"

"&gt;Because, I would submit, this foundation is NOT fundamentally flawed. Sure, Ben Simmons is not the type of player who can fit seamlessly on any roster (in the same way a shooting wing like a Kevin Durant or Paul George might.) Sure, there's some clunkiness to the halfcourt offense with both stars in the lineup. But at the end of the day, there are more positives than negatives here. They're both young. They both have great size for their position. They both play tough D. Together, that gives the Sixers an edge and identity over most teams.   Preach. I mean seriously, I am conditioned to assume that this would be another low-effort ""Simmons is terrible"" post but the entire thing was well thought out and informative. I agree with pretty much everything that you said. I would add that if Marcus Morris is *actually* available he should be a top target for us. He would be either a replacement for Horford who swaps defense for much more spacing and shooting. Or he would be our sixth man and play 30+ minutes a night, basically what we hoped Mike Scott would be.   Very well done man, thank you."
KAT studying at the Kevin Durant University of Social Media
Kevin Durant is so mentally weak for someone so famous and accomplished.
"1: I’m sure the Cavs would love to give it a go with Kyrie Irving for the first time  2: I’m sure Kevin Durant, their biggest signing in free agent history would very much rather play with Love than Irving  3: Kevin Love, a 31 year old big with injury history and who doesn’t defend well very much has the same trade value as Irving."
"Height does not make your position, Kevin Durant played a lot of 2 when he came into the league due to a lack of size too, it’s not a bad thing, he’s barely 19, he’ll get bigger.  Wikipedia and BBRef actually lists him at just SF"
"Kevin Durant, 0 ppg"
"This is a tragic description of Luka. Do you realize that he averages 8.9 ast/game when Kevin Durant has never reached 6 in twelve seasons ? He's nowhere near the shooter KD is but is already a better playmaker, their games aren't similar at all."
"&gt;Who did the Blazers get swept by then?  How did AD do in the regular season as the sole superstar on his team?  &gt;Making the conference finals in the east is better than losing in the first round in the west.   PG made Conference Finals in 2013 and 2014. Russ got fucked up by Pat Bev in 2013 and made Conference Finals in 2014.  PG has obviously had less playoffs success since then yet you're only criticising Russ.  &gt;Okay now you’re just being delusional.   You gonna make an actual argument?

KD's HORRIBLE 3pt shooting streak continued in the WCF.

Same story as the rest of the playoffs. It's worth noting that KD played like complete garbage the last 2 games of the series, where just one win would have punched in the Thunder's ticket to the finals.  &gt;It's tough to make a judgement on this series, but I still think Russ was better in the WCF because of his outstanding overall play, especially considering his playmaking, defense, and excellent play in transition."
"Great leadership Kevin Love, yeesh.  In my entire history of following the NBA, I've never started out by loving three people so much personality wise, only to slowly sour on them as the years have gone by, as Dwight Howard, Kevin Durant, and Kevin Love.  Love was such a magnetic presence earlier in his career, and while obviously a great person, and a likable personality, am continually surprised by his whineyness to the media and on court behavior."
Kevin Durant?
Dude looks like a cross between Kevin Durant and Kevin Hart.  So...  Kevin DurHart.
Honestly I don't think kyrie or Kevin give two shits about the nets. Dudes just wanted a good city to play in together and kyrie will gladly sit this season out to wait for durant
"Yeah because he had to face a team that won a championship, 73 games, had the 3rd longest winning streak ever and made back to back finals.... and then replaced their worst starter with Kevin Fucking Durant a dude who most consider to be better than Harden and a top 15 player of all time.......AND HARDEN STILL WENT UP 3-2 ON THEM BEFORE HIS RUNNING MATE GOT HURT   If prime MJ and Scottie, LeBron and Wade or Magic and Kareem had to face those warriors teams they would have lost too and here we are bashing Harden for not beating them with old Chris Paul and Clint Capela as his star teammates"
...runs into Kevin Durant.
He went up for a huge offensive rebound over Kevin Durant on the missed FT by George Hill  Yeah he messed up but agreed that blame shoulda been split. Lue should have been in the refs ear ready for that situation and he wasn't
"right? ""yeah, let's pay this dude millions and not play him, we're cool with that. we're already doing it with kevin durant, so it's all gucci we like giving money because we're generous"" - nets"
What? Kevin Durant is easily way more hated than LeBron.  He doesn't have a massive fanbase like LeBron...  People still can't move from him joining GSW 3 years ago.  KD is often called 'bitch' despite not being a sellout to China.
"A couple things on that. If it was like .2 percentage difference maybe but it is a full .5 percentage. That's pretty significant as for 3 pointers go. Second, if you adjust for minutes played Novak chucks over 8 a game, more than double of Dirk's. I get that Dirk gets more attention but .5% in 3 point is the same as going from Westbrook 3 point shot to Kevin Durant. Going from Ricky Rubio to Damian Lillard."
"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kevin-durant-super-bowl-50-photography  When I saw this article, I had a feeling he was going to go to the Warriors. It was in the Bay Area and idk exactly what it was but dude was very overjoyed. I think Curry was also at that game too?"
Jason Kidd and Kevin Durant would be exciting to watch.

"Ben Taylor explains it better than me.   Kevin Durant is around the same come playoff time, whereas the guys I listed before are a little better than their normal selves on average.  I’m not saying KD is any better or any worse than the other guys, he just doesn’t scale as much come playoffs."
That is very true I don’t think harden has had a signature playoff game akin  to kds “I’m Kevin Durant”game or Brons game 6 2012 or Kawhis game 1 against philly or even dames 50 point game against okc
80% Larry Bird + Dominque Wilkins = Kevin Durant
"&gt; You'd be crazy not to want to upgrade your team the hest way possible.  Have I once thrown shade at the Warriors? I don’t bash the Warriors, KD is just a pussy for making that move. Nothing you’ve said even remotely changes that.   &gt; Durant joined a different Warriors team that beat him. That Warriors team had a Curry that made threes from everywhere at an insane rate. It had gunners at every position. Durant joined a Warriors team that needed Ian Clark, Zaza, and the corpse of Davis West. Spit any rhetoric you want but that's fact.  I’ll spell it out for your simple mind. It doesn’t fucking matter, it’s KD joining Steph Curry, Klay, Iggy, and Draymond. Maybe you had your head in the sand the whole time, That’s the greatest top 5 to a team in the history of pro sports (until Cousins joined). Everyone on Earth knew this meant they were unbeatable. Everyone. Everyone knew the MOMENT HE SIGNED. It didn’t matter that they lost minor bench pieces. It’s KEVIN DURANT. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand that it doesn’t matter how much depth you lose when in a fucking playoff series the top 6-7 players are basically all that play.   &gt; And whose fault is that? It was a perfect storm: Curry fell to the Warriors, got injured and re-signed for a discount as a result, they got Klay for some reason, and who would have thought Draymond would turn out the way he did?  I’m not faulting the Warriors for being in that position. As I said above, I’ve never once criticized the Warriors.   &gt; Quit being butthurt and just enjoy the basketball,  I enjoy Basketball, apparently more then you. Because I like competitive basketball between elite competitors, not athletes who pussy out and take the easiest route to get to their goal. That ruins the game. And it did ruin the game. You go rewatch the 2018 finals and tell me how much you love the purity of the game after watching that horseshit."
"2nd longest actual be streak is James Harden with 375 after today. Jordan has the 2nd longest at 866, Kevin Durant had a streak of 562 until Dec 2017 where he got injured in the 1st quarter. LeBron is currently at 962."
Oh right that season when you had Kevin fucking Durant come back and play   Wait a second
"That's what I'm saying. Just because he had a career season means very little with what's happened here lately in this season and he has a huge problem with injuries over his career, even last season, that plants a permanent red flag that GMs have to think about.   And him having a major injury would be way easier to digest. Like Kevin Durant a gm would go ""ok we know what he has, what's the timetable for best and worst case on a return""   It feels like he has a very kawhi type injury where something is clearly wrong with his leg, but no one really knows.  You keep downvoting me. But I wish he was worth something. I wish he could play. Last season was actually kind of fun mainly because of him. But the current reality sucks for his spot on this team right now"
Kevin Durant is the kind of guy who will stick with one franchise for the duration of his career.
Kevin Durant is not on the team anymore. Klay Thompson is out for possibly the whole season. Steph has missed most of the season so far and is still out at the moment.
"&gt;Why do people act like the traditional bigman only just went out of style?  Because it did go out of style with everyone wanting to be ""like Mike"" and play on the perimeter growing up coupled with sports leagues like AAU where if a kid does not like how he's being coached (being told to post up) he can just switch teams to a coach that lets him play point guard.  While this has lead to a lot of great big men with tremendous outside skills like Kevin Durant (yeah, I said it) or Kevin Love or Anthony Davis, it's also lead to the post up game being the realm of point guards and wing players now, which is odd.  The 90s had quite a few of the NBA's best big men in its history so I'm not sure why you think it was dead when Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwan, Arvydas Sabonis, Vlade Divac, Dikembe Mutombo, Rik Smits, Alonzo Morning, and Shaq all played in the 90s.  Hell, Shaq wasn't even the best big man of the 90s because the 90s were so stacked with them. (It's Hakeem by a mile, then David Robinson, then Shaq)"
Kevin Durant and Lebron James.
"All-NBA selections definitely can be a incentive stipulation, especially for the supermax contract. But really the stipulations can be anything, can be number of games played, number of games won, statistical achievements, year end awards, and All-Star selections.   http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q74 See #2 under Q74  Contract details mostly aren't available to the public, but off the top of my head IIRC from the hoop collective podcast, Siakam has an All-Star incentive in his contract for like 4-5 mil or something.   All Star selections definitely have meaning, it's easier to market an All Star guard for a shoe deal than say, Lonzo Ball.  Edit: It's probably less than 5mil, here's incentives from Durants Nets Contract\  ""Durant also has $1 million of incentives. He can get the bonus with any of the following:  His team making the playoffs His team winning at least 43 games Playing 50 games Making an All-Star team""  Sauce: https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/07/10/here-are-incentives-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-must-hit-to-get-max-salaries/"
"What are you talking about?  Took the Heat about 6 years to retire Tim Hardaway's and Shaq's jerseys.  Some players (like Wade, Dirk, Kobe, etc.) are sure things and basically the face of an organization.  Even if it's a sure thing, sometimes the player is just busy with a lot of other commitments, scheduling an important event and making sure all the important people can attend isn't always an easy task.  Plus there's no real urgency for it, you can do it this season, next season, no big deal.  Other players, it's not so obvious (will Nuggets or Knicks retire Melo? do Warriors retire Durant or Iggy? Do Pacers retire Paul George?  Do Raptors retire Kawhi? Bulls retire Butler? etc.).  So teams might wait till they need to drum up some interest in the team, get them in the news, trying to boost attendance for a game, etc.    Other times fences need to be mended first.  [Wolves have tried to retire KG's jersey, but he doesn't have a good relationship with the team, and has refused.](https://minnesotasportsfan.com/kevin-garnett-wont-accept-timberwolves-invitations-retire-jersey/).  Guys like Durant (w/OKC), Blake Griffin (w/LAC) might need some time for wounds to heal, or fans might need time to forgive and forget.  A guy like Vince Carter, if he retired in 2010, no way he'd be getting his jersey retired right away in TOR, but now that it's been 15 years since he left (and his image has improved), it might be more realistic to see his jersey retired in the next 5-10 years (though some fans will still oppose it).  A lot of reasons why teams including the Heat don't retire jerseys right away."
"Another thing about the survey is that Kevin Durant and Allen Iverson are top 5 players ever so this survey is kind of a sham no matter who it benefits if it’s Kobe, Bron, or MJ. This is why you can’t take every word from an NBA player as fact considering neither Durant or AI are top 15 players of all time. Is there any way you could possibly defend either player being top 5?"
I'm a Rockets fan and I'm also not a fan of Kevin Durant the person but when he's healthy he's the 2nd best player in the league.
Kevin Durant’s postseason efficiency numbers as the “guy” were no better than Hardens as the “guy” in Houston before he went to a team with two of the top 3 shooters ever in Golden state. I’m very interested in to see a Durant  postseason performance in Brooklyn.
L2M report:  Kevin Durant was out of bounds.
One thing for sure is officiating has gotten much worse under Silver and he isn't doing shit to address it. Yes he tried doing the little review thing but that's made things worse. There is no way the refs miss the out of bounds by Kevin Durant unless they are working for the mob.
"""KD"" stands for Kevin Durant. He's a snek. I think he has his own wikipedia page. Kind of interesting."
"What’s crazy is that Kevin Durant looks a lot skinnier than Lebron, but he’s listed at 240 lbs (only 10 lbs less than Lebron)."
Remember the Rockets game when Kevin Durant was out of bounds on the baseline dribbling and globetrotting with the ball before he passed it out and the refs didn't call out of bounds? Fuck Silver that POS commissioner.
"the difference is you can objectively measure stats of an *individual* player across generations, but looking at a whole team and seeing where they finished in playoffs contention is much sillier to determine how good a player really was. Also those teams don't hold a candle to the warriors let's be real lmao they were 73-9 then added kevin fucking durant, they were the most dominant team of all time."
You can have Kevin Durant and 2 other mvps on the same team and still lose. Or Kevin Durant and 3 other all stars and still almost lose.
Give me a franchise with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant and I could make a contender too
"1) Klay Thompson most overrated player in the nba. Max player held to role expectation who’s laughably coddled because people like him   Edit: will actually elaborate on this one. Not actually a ""big playoff performer"" it's the opposite(and his [playoff clutch 3 point shooting is actually terrible](http://bkref.com/tiny/Tfcim) tbh) really people only selectively remember his good moments ignore his bad ones because again he's not held to star expectations. Ex throws away game 4 vs Hou 2018 all anybody does is talk about Steph and KD. Ethan Strauss has even said in the past GSW players have gotten frustrated by the lack of criticism Klay ever gets. Defense gets overrated because of how much exposure he gets and people overrating the value of onball defense/underrating help defense. [Shooting effectiveness falls off big time when Steph isnt on the court](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2019-20,2018-19,2017-18,2016-17,2015-16,2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612744&amp;PlayerId=201939) even if he had KD with him. A byproduct of a team where his weaknesses all get camoflauged and Steph's greatness. Very good player but he's nowhere near this top 15-20 player people claim. No impact metrics would suggest that, neither would just objectively analyzing him.   2) Sixers are still capable of winning a title contrary to the overreactions.....and also capable of losing in round 1   3) Nobody has any idea what Giannis is going to do at all it’s just another case of Reddit doing “why would Giannis ever leave he says he wants to win!!!” like they do with every single FA on a good team   4) Think it’s more likely than not Kevin Durant doesn’t return as a top 10 player post Achilles hope this one is wrong in particular    5) Kevin Love Andrew Wiggins trade was a lose lose Wiggins at the time was super valuable as a trade asset what Love gave Cleveland in return wasn’t close to the average return of a no 1 pick. People just aren’t honest about it because hey he averaged 8/8 on 38% FG and the Cavs won the 2016 title in spite of him so “ring means it can’t be a bad trade!!”"
Kevin Durant was winning scoring titles before Kawhi was even in the league.
If there was one franchise who could get it done I’d put my money on the one that got Kevin Durant to join them after beating him down 3-1 in the playoffs
"It's going to be even weirder when Durant is back, I think, because Kyrie's deal is that he wants to have his own team and is clearly very frustrated by the perception he can't be a winner on his own. Durant will be the bigger star and better player once he's healthy, and more significantly than anything else, the team will still be *the Nets*. Having your own team/market is pointless if you're less popular in your home gym than the concert loading in the next day. Look into my flair; you know it to be true. I remember the Globetrotters came to the LA Sports Arena once and I remember 2,000 people seemingly cheer louder for a dude with a squirt gun and a ladder than 18,000 people did during the Josh Smith-Corey Brewer game 6 meltdown in 2015. I wish Brooklyn fans the best of luck. They had a fun, scrappy young team and now they have a situation where people are like, ""Man, Kevin Durant needs to step in and help fix the chemistry issues here."""
"I mean Skip wasn’t 100% wrong. The Mavs didn’t employ some genius defensive scheme to slow Lebron down. Lebron has admitted that he got into his own head that series. If you think the mavs intentionally drew up plays that led to JJ Barrea shutting Lebron down on multiple key possessions you’re out of your mind. Also, the idea that players don’t think about what is going to be said and written in this day and age is also very clearly ridiculous. See, Kevin Durant."
1. Kevin Durant 2. Donovan Mitchell 3. Giannis 4. Pascal Siakam 5. Ja Morant 6. Rudy Gobert  7. Sekou Dembouya  8. RJ Barrett  9. Trae Young  10. James Harden
"I mean he does need more help and that help is Kevin Durant.  Kyrie is not a #1 guy, he will never be a #1 guy, he’s straight up just not good enough to be a #1 guy. He is however an elite #2 guy."
... it was one of the only knocks on his gane  he literally [admitted](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21359160/kevin-durant-gone-great-lengths-become-top-defender) himself that his defense only started to creep in two years before he left for GSW lol  in golden state he could put more effort on that side of the ball since he didn't have to carry so much offensively  that's pretty obvious just using logic lol
How do you say you need more help when you know you have KEVIN DURANT coming back next season?
"He's right. It literally does not make sense to complain about needing more help when your team has Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Jarrett Allen, Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris in the context of his comments. That's a hell of a starting 5. Why would you even risk alienating anybody on the team with this shit? Kyrie needs to play this season out and stop talking about leadership and missing pieces"
"Curry, Harden, Lillard, Lebron, Kyrie, Kemba  Jimmy Butler, Kawhi, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Klay Thompson, PG13, Jayson Tatum  Jokic, Kat, Embiid, Siakim, Gobert, AD, Giannis"
Kevin of Durant
Kevin Durant
"if you don't understand that 7 foot tall centers always get pushed up boards because of their height and not skill, I can't help you. Kevin Durant was the better basketball player. Oden was drafted ahead of him because of position scarcity."
The Kevin durant
Or he could be Kevin Durant. Beal is a good player. Not a great player. No one will mention his name in 10 years. MPJ has the potential to be a great.
MPJ was one of the highest recruited players coming out of high school. He’s capable of becoming a Kevin Durant like player. 6’10 with handles and a shot. He’s young and cheap with a chance to develop.
"Uhhh they still made the playoffs when they lost KD as well.... casual fans really need to get back to listening instead of talking. Y’all keep enbarassing yourselves with these posts lol  I could literally change the name in your post to Kevin Durant and it would have the exact same meaning. They lost KD and still made the playoffs. “I guess you can say KD were a huge disappointment, He was clearly a #2 who thought he was a #1”"
"He always picks random numbers that basically tell you exactly where he ranks these things. Die Hard is a top 6 title of all time because he has it at 6. Kevin Durant is a top 12 player of the past 40 years, and you know he ain't 1-11.  It's so goofy."
Hey speak for yourself buddy. I'll have you know that for me it exists as a place to obsessively attack Kevin Durant
Yes he has.  &gt; KD didn’t put Steph Curry in his top-5 toughest players to guard list  &gt; Here’s 2 minutes of Steph giving Kevin Durant work:  https://twitter.com/gswchris/status/1217839156451143680
"KD also put Kyrie on his ""best teammate lineup"" over Steph.   &gt; KD names his all-time starting 5 out of all the players he played with: Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Kevin Durant , Draymond Green, Serge Ibaka   &gt; “We can switch everything on D, we got all-world scorers..that’s a perfect team”   https://twitter.com/TheNBACentral/status/1187407044363640832"
"Fuck me that clip is both brilliant and infuriating at the same time. The dead shit doesn't absorb anything Mark is saying. After everything Mark says about generalities Skip goes on to say:  &gt; Lebron played harder than Kevin Durant 4 straight games  &gt; Lebron disappeared and shrank in crunch time, I can show you the numbers  &gt; Ibaka was supposed to come hard  Also hilarious that SAS sits on the side like a mute the whole segment."
"Man, if that happened - the plethora of stars to run through OKC would be CRAZY.   Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Victor Oladipo (afterwards), Paul George, Chris Paul, Shai Gilgeous Alexander (soon to be), and then Bradley Beal?   Plus Ibaka who was an all defensive team player and I remember people arguing he should've been an all-star while in OKC, crazy to see. Even without Beal that's still a crazy amount of talent that played there at one point."
"Watch Curry in 2016 against OKC, you will notice how do they hack the shit out of him on running through screens plays, everytime 3 pairs of hands was on him and you cant do this in regular season, its just an NBA rules gimmick to make playoff more tighter. Actually i think also good to watch last games vs Rockets without Durant, because Houston wasnt prepared to Durant-less Warriors that year, funny enough, they just couldnt stop Curry-Green PnR combo, preparation plan is also very important. Or like 2004 finals when Detroit just let Kobe shoot. You cant show much of this kind of tactic in regular season, i think you can test something and also let players play and improvise in some parts. And also better teams, and grind, in 2016 Curry gets injuried and then tired after record season, then he cant outdribble Kevin Love even on his ISO bread and butter play"

"Via SBNation, ""Irving thinks Nets aren't good enough, even with Durant""  &gt;”Collectively, I feel like we have great pieces,” Irving said, “but it’s pretty glaring we need one more piece or two more pieces that will complement myself, KD [Kevin Durant], DJ [DeAndre Jordan], GT [Garrett Temple], Spence [Dinwiddie], Caris [LeVert], and we’ll see how that evolves.”  &gt;Irving did preface with compliments for his teammates, saying “We have complementary young guys as well that have done a great job the last three years.” But those young players were noticeably absent from the list of vets Irving clearly sees as the key pieces for next year’s title run.

"[Here's his quote on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/1217656098360119298) The gist is that the Nets have ""glaring"" deficiencies and need to add a lot to be playoff contenders.

Kevin Durant in top 10 at 37 lmao
The Kevin Durant comparisons are really easy to make...
"Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Ben Simmons, Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis, Brandon Ingram, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant.  No particular order"
"He's no longer an elite player on the defensive end, if you want to try and explain how he is when the entire starting line up for the Utah Jazz and our sixth man where all better or equally capable defenders or how Hassan Whiteside and James Harden where better defenders than he was last year by advanced metrics feel free.  Draymond is a project of having two of the greatest shooters to ever play the game around him then adding Kevin Durant.  On any other team he's a solid roleplayer type guy, nothing more, nothing less."
You’re right. Dray is good as long as he’s at best the third or fourth best player on a team. He does play incredible d but that’s it. Wow he can pass on a team that has the two best shooters of all time and Kevin Durant. He is soooo good.
"Uh oh, he's angry. Kevin Durant couldn't win with Westbrook and Harden while he was in his prime but I'm sure he's gonna get you over the top post injury by himself, good call bud. Enjoy being second fiddle to the Knicks, even if you are ever good, nobody will care."
i hope you realize Kevin Durant is better than every single player on your team and hes not even playing for our team this year so the trajectory is def up for us.. you guys on the other hand got your asses handed to you by the worst teams this year and when you win it doesn't even look impressive either. def heading towards getting dominated in the playoffs for sure.
Yeah it is gonna be ok we have Kevin Durant coming back and a bunch of assets and pieces we can test and move around

So you're gonna try to tell the Rockets declined so bad from just a year that with a fully healthy CP3 they couldn't beat a beat up Warrior's team that didn't have Kevin fucking Durant??? lmao
I remember when people genuinely thought the Warriors were better without Kevin fucking Durant then that whole theory seemingly vanished when they couldn't get the job done in the finals
"2015: Both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love go down, the 67-15 Warriors get taken to 6 by LeBron and Timofey Mozgov  2016: Blow a 3-1 lead in the Finals  2017: Kawhi Leonard gets assassinated by Zaza Pachulia in Game 1 after the Spurs were stomping the Warriors in Oracle. He misses the rest of the series.  2018: Chris Paul goes down in the WCF after the Rockets go up 3-2. The Warriors win the series.  2019: Klay Thompson tears his ACL, Kevin Durant tears his Achilles  Injury luck has benefitted the Warriors far more than it has hurt them."

"So it’s fair the grade the nets who have had Kyrie for only like 12 games and no Kevin Durant, and give them a c when we know they are much better when healthy. But the warriors get a pass because “they didn’t choose injure their players.”"
Honestly I wouldn't look into it too much. He probably just said Kyrie because that's the guy he's currently teammates with and since they're so close. If he was still on the Warriors he would have probably said Curry. But it's Kevin Durant here so who knows honestly
Yes bc the shitty GMs of this league are the ones that can reel in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving  Come the fuck on
"It does though, you naive poop head. What do you mean by go anywhere? They literally have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the same damn team. It was worth the risk of trying due to the potential of success.  However, on the flip side, stay with me man because you keep reducing this situation to a lot less than it really is and are judging people from this point of view: Kyrie’s behavior towards his teammates is alarming. That isn’t even mentioning his bizarre world views. These people are suggesting trade Kyrie early to get something in return since they’re pessimistic that he’s ever gonna be a key leader of a team that is worth the potential team chemistry price. So NO, it isn’t because people are sold on Dinwiddie being a better player but moreso creating early fail safe’s so that they avoid the incompetent pitfalls that teams like the Knicks, Suns, and Kings fail to plan for.  Of course the Nets aren’t championship material this year, but they’ve got potential; they have value. They have flexibility in moves due to the pieces they have that has been fostered through a front office that actually knows what they’re doing. You can tell that if you pay attention to all the gray between contender and utter failure franchises."
Have Kevin Durant on the floor.
"The data that really stood out to me was Klay inside 8 ft. I never would have guessed he was better in that range than motherfucking Steph Curry, let alone ALMOST AS EFFICIENT AS KEVIN DURANT.   Also kind of funny how one glance at this tells you that KD doesn't practice shots from further than 21 feet out 😆  I'm gonna ask a few questions-- Klay's line very closely follows the line for GSW as a whole. Is there a reason for this along the lines of ""he shoots a lot of shots and his volume anchors the team averages"" or were the rest of the dubs just sleeper Klay Thompsons the whole season?  I'm also interested in analysis on why Curry was outperformed in the paint by the rest of his team. Is it as simple as ""his team is getting great looks inside because he pulls the defense back for them before passing in?"" That would be my guess for the team being higher than league average, but it seems like Curry is barely above NBA average for short range game. Is it just ""short guy gets blocked?""  Last question, what kind of volume do we have on data beyond 30 feet out?"
"Because we ran our offense in Kyle ""Kevin Durant"" Kuzma tonight."
"In the case of Siakam I like to share my go to random cherry picked stats I found before the 2018 draft trying to compare Ayton and Bagley numbers:   Since 2000 (the 99-00 season) only 14 players have averaged +20ppg and +10rpg as a freshmen or sophomore in the NCAA.   * Troy Murphy * Kris Humphries * Paul Millsap * Andrew Bogut * **Leon Powe** * Kevin Durant * **Jonathan Rodriguez** * **Luke Harangody** * Michael Beasley * Blake Griffin * Pascal Siakam * Marvin Bagley III * Deandre Ayton * **Lamine Diane**  [Link for results.](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;year_min=2000&amp;class_is_fr=Y&amp;class_is_so=Y&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;games_type=A&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=20&amp;c2stat=trb_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=10&amp;order_by=pts)  Siakam did it as a SO   Only the bold ones I would argue were complete bust if they even got to the NBA. A fourth one (Lamine Diane) has done it as a FR and SO but in a weak conference, in a weak team. The most he was done is earn himself a Bleacher Report article.   If we cherry pick and drop the averages to 19.9 and 9.9 we add Ryan Anderson and a current sophomore called Daniel Oturu who may be rising in some mock drafts lately.   Oh and Wiseman was averaging 19.7ppg/10.7rbp in his 3 games.   I know the numbers are cherry picked but goddamn they have worked fine so far in recruiting. The numbers were in Siakam's favor."
"The difference on the season is .07% and Jaren takes 2 more 3's than KD did. Hes shooting 48% from 3 on 6.7 attempts over the last 2 months. Kevin Durant has never shot that well on that volume in any 2 month stretch of his entire career. Jaren habitually shoots from well beyond the arc, in transition, on stepbacks, around screens, and over defenders. He got 43 points in a game and shot 7 3's in a quarter while being defended by fucking Giannis. Again, if you look at per 100 and per 36, he rebounds at nearly an identical rate to KD. Jaren is the leading scorer and first option on a team that's nearly matched sophmore KD's w/l record in just half a season. Maybe more efficient scoring (60.6 TS vs 57.7 TS) and more valuable defense translates to more wins when compared to high volume stats."
"The Kevin Durant effect. His build would be terrible for the NFL, but for the NBA? It’s literally godly. Players like KD, Giannis, Bron, tall and/or lanky ass dudes, that should not be that skilled for their size(Bron maybe not so much in height but the skill and speed at his weight is insane). It’s no wonder why, if he never had that injury he would’ve been arguably the best prospect in years and one of the best *potential* prospects of all time.   Sense he’s been looking healthier and healthier as the season progresses, he still has a chance to be one, if not the best player in his class. Honestly imo he’s already the second behind Luka and imho the only way we won’t surpass him is if he gets reinjured or if Lukas development continues to skyrocket at this pace.   No shade at Trey! Love me some ICETrey and even though he’s no doubt has had waaaay a better career so far than MPJ so far, MPJs potential is just that crazy. Honestly their draft class is fucking insane."
Imagine putting Brandon Ingram in the same Sentence  as Kevin Durant lmfao
"Hate him all you want, but Kevin Durant has not *once* cried to the referees this year."
World team should be:   PG: Luka Dončić / Ben Simmons  SG: Goran Dragic / Bogdan Bogdanovic   SF: Pascal Siakam / Danilo Gallinari / Joe Ingles  PF: Giannis / Kristaps Porziņģis   C: Nikola Jokic / Joel Embiid / Rudy Gobert  &amp;#x200B;  This has a decent chance against the current Team USA which is missing Steph Curry and Kevin Durant due to injury.
Damn Playoff P is more snake like than Kevin Durant.
"In Giannis's case he was a completely unknown prospect in 2013 when r/nba was much smaller (also significantly better but not the point).   [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b0bji/2013_draft/c92kcbv/) by /u/DaHowse seems to be the first comment mentioning him on /r/nba, on March 27 before the 2013 NBA draft:  &gt;I don't care who we draft in the first, I just want Giannis in the second. Kevin durant 2.0.  So he was a projected second rounder even a few months before the draft, but he blew up approaching the draft. Ujiri was supposedly interested from very early.   Oh and for other earliest comments his last name is often spelled Adetokunbo instead of the Greek spelling. If /u/hedonistolid ever makes a Giannis post he should watch out for that and use ""Giannis"" as the search term, as most people either used that before the draft, or expectedly spelled it wrong."
I miss Kevin Durant man
"A couple people changed their opinions on Lebron James in 2010 and Kevin Durant in 2016, I forget why though, some stuff."
That's almost as good as Steph Curry flanked by Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant
"&gt; Steph Curry, I'll listen to him.  That's funny, because the shooting coach for Steph Curry and Kevin Durant isn't Magic or Kareem or Kobe or some other all time great.   It's Rob McClanaghan, a guy whose playing career topped out as a walk-on at Syracuse, where he scored 20 total points over 3 seasons. That's who teaches Curry and KD how to shoot.   When John Wall shot 7% 3pt in his 2nd season, he went to McClanaghan. Since then, he's shot 33% 3pt. Derrick Rose thanked him in his MVP speech, after also showing significant shooting improvement from his rookie year.   By your logic, Curry and KD and Wall and Rose are all dumb for letting some nobody ""criticize them about how they do their thing."" After all, a guy who never accomplished anything as a player must have nothing to teach them.   By your logic, Tim Grover had nothing to teach Jordan either, nor did Holger Geschwindner have anything to teach Dirk. After all, what did Grover and Geschwindner ever do as players?"
"Kevin Durant   IF anything he used to get coddled alot in OKC. Not just on here but in the media 100% the whole Oklahoma newspaper apologizing after writing a piece criticizing him amongst many other ex. On the internet youd get get all kinds of pushback if you criticized him for having a bad game in the playoffs I always found it weird. When he won MVP in 2014 people were starting to ask ""Is he becoming as good as LeBron"" and the whole reason the question was being asked was because people didnt realize they werent holding KD to nearly the standard or heat htey did to LeBron(they wouldnt ask it if they did)"
&gt;  KMart-quality  Khris Middleton plays Kevin Martin-quality Kevin Durant?
"Middleton just plays like KMart-quality Kevin Durant. I think Middleton is still the closest in terms of shot distribution, or at least was a couple years ago, but is basically just a little worse in each category on offense.   The main reason why there's not that much buzz is because he's the clear 2nd star on the team behind the supernova that is Giannis. Unless you're All-NBA or on a real big market team. Middleton will never *ever* be the player they use when doing a Bucks promo for a national game, which is why he's pretty easy to ignore in a publicity sense."
"&gt; “So, I’m texting my wife, telling her I’ll probably get traded because I think it’s 100 percent sure, even though everyone else is saying, it’s only a chance. Then, once KD (Kevin Durant) left, I’m like, ‘Yeah, I’ll probably get traded. They’re probably going to do a sign-and-trade, so they can get something back, to at least get assets for him.’ No one was thinking that. But I was thinking they’ll want to get assets back because they can’t just let him go. And they’ll probably move me as well. So, she asked me where I thought I would go. I said, ‘I don’t know, I’ll probably end up in Memphis or some s--t.’  https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/andre-iguodala-finding-it-difficult-move-time-warriors  He could have been just joking around, but still comes across as having a tone of condescension towards Memphis."
"&gt; At some point, I wouldn't be surprised if Kawhi comes out and explains that part of his reason for leaving was how the Spurs missed on major talent movements during those few years.  I had this theory for Kevin Durant in his OKC days as OKC was just content on getting by with their 2 superstars, and I had this same theory with the Spurs thinking Rudy Gay and Pau Gasol would solve all their problems."
What do u mean that wasn't his assignment we're talking about Hardest players to guard meaning players with the most unstoppable offense essentially not who is the best defender or even all around player it's about their offensive skill set it has nothing to do with defense and who guarded who it's Kevin Durant opinion not necessarily players he guarded not like he was guarding Lou Williams out right in a game except on switches in particular situations
Kevin Durant in his Golden State years was above average to elite in every one of these Categories
Kevin Durant.
Coulda swore Kevin Durant was pretty ok at basketball
"Yeah, you have no self-awareness whatsoever. It's all Jeremy Lin, Porzingis, and Phil Jackson's fault. They're terrible people and James Dolan and Carmelo are born winners. It's also Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard who are the fools for laughing at the idea of ever signing with you. Good luck."
As many hoops as Kevin durant has earned championships
"I mean Curry plays defense and he’s decent at it. He just gets called for reaches too much and leaves them corner threes open a tad too much. He plays within the defense and knows what to do.   The whole thing that makes Curry look worse on defense is that he gets target hard and that happens when some of your fellow players that you share the floor with Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala, Shaun Livingston, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, and Kevin Looney. And the rest are basically bigs who can move their feet, so who the fuck are you gonna target as an opposing team?"
Imagine that kid is like “Kevin Durant!”  *KD turns around*  “You made the softest move in NBA history joining the 73-9 warriors that defeated you”
Bro are we watching the same sport? Did you see Lebrons playoff runs?   Kevin Durant?   Stop blowing this man up. He’s good/great but not generational talent or ever the best player in the league.
I do not like Kevin Durant and I will make in known in this thread with this comment
Lebron - PG Kobe - SG Kevin Durant - SF Kareem - PF Wilt - C
&gt;shooting 50% from mid-range is above average.  Way beyond above average. KEvin Durant for his career is around 45% from mid range. Dirk was about 47% for his career. Steve Nash 48%. And this is best in NBA history on decent volume type level.
What happened after that? His numbers went down every single year after that. 2012 was not the norm for Kevin Durant. His efficiency has always tanked in the playoffs.
It’s like Stephen Curry vs Kevin Durant
Draymond did not get suspended for hitting LeBron in the nuts.  Draymond got suspended because he was over the flagrant foul threshold after hitting LeBron in the nuts. That’s a league wide rule. Blame Draymond for his incessant and excessive fouls in the playoffs in 2016. Blame him for getting too riled up. #BLAME HIM FOR CALLING KEVIN FUCKING DURANT AFTER GAME 7
"I don't really agree with the categorization of Trae or LeBron. I think advantage angle creation to facillitate passing like trae, bron, luka, etc can do is different than the draw and kick, gravity and find the open man passing that would categorize let's say, prime derrick rose, kevin durant etc. That stile can also be used by the former but it's different in my opinion.  Agreed in tottallity re jokic tho."
I honestly don’t see why it can’t be 28%. I’m telling you they have nobody that can score the ball other than those 3. Klay is a very low usage player. Kevin Durant had a 30.4 and 29 USG% in his last two seasons with the Dubs.
do the knicks have an injured kevin durant laying around?
Do you not understand how much better it is playing alongside Kevin Durant than Andrew Wiggins?
"&gt;He doesn’t fit the way GSW plays at all and seeing people try to convince themselves he does and that it’ll work is hilarious  I'm sorry? Wiggins is exactly what GSW is looking for and has historically performed well with: a long wing that can play the pick and roll and take advantage of the insane spacing provided by Steph and Klay. Shaun Livingston, Harrison Barnes, Kevin Durant all fit that mold. If Wiggins can knock down his 3s at a higher clip, he fits that mold pretty exactly."
No never. They would have had a much better chance in the finals against the bosh at center lineups if they had tried. They did play small a bit the following year with Russ-Kevin Martin-Thabo-Durant-Ibaka lineups. Still not nearly enough though. That lineup was unstoppable.
"Presti made a move for some big time shooter almost every year only for it to just not work out(MCDermott, Morrow, Butler, Abrines. And to tell you the honest truth our roster wasn't built around Westbrook, it was a defensive based group built around Kevin Durant and Westbrook being the main offensive with some great Center-play sprinkled in.    If you want to argue the 2016 roster wasn't built properly and needed more shooters I'll remind you we had the warriors down 3-1 and the roleplayers were not the reason we lost that year. Building around Westbrook was hard, shooters require assets."
Keep in mind I only started watching ~ 2010  1) The Golden State Warriors have blown a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers  2) Klay Thompson has torn his ACL 3) Stephen Curry has sprained his MCL  4) Kevin Durant has torn his Achilles  5) The Golden State Warriors trade Andre Iguodala to the Memphis Grizzlies
Raptors ran a box and one for Curry cause he was the only player on the team worth a shit who wasn't injured. No way in hell they are running that without the Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant injuries.
I refuse ti believe that Kevin Durant is only 120 pounds lighter than Shaq
"Unable to work out an extension with James Harden, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded the Sixth Man of the Year to the Houston Rockets on Saturday night, breaking up the young core of the Western Conference champions.  Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook will undergo surgery in the coming days to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee.  Thunder's Kevin Durant (foot) will miss rest of season.  The Oklahoma city thunder have blown a 3-1 lead to the golden state warriors.  Kevin Durant has signed with the Golden state warriors.  Paul George has been traded to the clippers.  Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets."
[Kevin Durant watching Brandon Ingram this season](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1196988270367924226/pu/vid/480x848/ujqS94ZKr1FL4VZc.mp4?tag=10)
Brandon “Kevin Durant” Ingram
once Kevin Durant hears about this he's gonna make 200 twitter accounts to spam Giannis with hate
Him picking Kevin Durant might have been his best pick all night.
Giannis almost called BI Kevin Durant
Was he about to say Kevin Durant lol
he was about to say Kevin Durant lol
Pretty sure I remember one Kevin Durant being there for 3 of their 4 losses.
"Yes, a max contract is 25%/30%/35% (depending on years of service and applicability of the Rose rule/supermax) of the cap in the first year and then up to 5% or 10% raises each year thereafter, (depending on if the contract was signed with Bird rights or not). That's part of why you see such large differences in contract amounts when a player re-signs with their own team vs leaves in free agency.   Those numbers are fixed when the contract is signed. If the cap raises by a lot then a contract signed previously usually becomes more valuable. This is how the Warriors were able to add Kevin Durant without getting rid of any major pieces; all their guys were on relatively small contracts and then the cap rose by a lot."
WOW from Harrison Barnes to Kevin freaking Durant to Andrew Wiggins   LMAOOOOOOOO light years comes at u fast
Because it’s irrelevant to the Kevin Durant and Draymond Green situation.
"I'm honestly very surprised that the answer wasn't Kevin Durant. Spending the entire decade with those powerful OKC teams and then going straight to the juggernaut Warriors, he still had 10 less wins than Ibaka, who stopped in Orlando before coming to the Raptors.  Might have to do with time missed to injury maybe? Still a surprise to me."

&gt;Dlo is now onto his 4th team in 3 years for a reason.  Because  - that Lakers FO was incompetent  - the Nets used him to land Kevin fuckin Durant  - the Warriors needed a player who can actually play alongside Curry and Klay
This stat is only so it could include deangelo Russell. Not accurate representation of where steph and Kevin Durant are actually shooting
They went from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant. Then they flipped KD for Wiggins.   Light years ahead!
Sign and trade with Kevin Durant so they had an asset coming back in return instead of being left with nothing
"It’s amazing that GS manages to turn a departing Kevin Durant into Wiggins and picks. Like they were basically free.  Don’t get me wrong, not saying Wiggins is going to be an amazing player but the dude has loads of talent and is still extremely young. Perhaps learning under champions like Steph, Klay, and Green will help his development.  I think those four will be scary next season. They do need some depth but they have some assets now."
"He is not as good as Kevin Durant, but he is better than Harrison Barnes. I really like this move for the Warriors. If they get Wiseman in the draft, they're going to look really nice."
&gt;Damnnnnnn. I follow the nba pretty closely but missed this. Do you have a good article about this incident? Thanks in advance    [Hope this works for you] (https://thesource.com/2019/10/31/source-sports-kevin-durant-says-draymond-green-situation-played-a-role-in-leaving-golden-state/)
"Except those aren't the only words he said. He didn't turn anything into anything, Draymond straight up insulted him and told him to leave lmao. Do you even know what you're talking about or are you just running with headlines only?  &gt;Green called Durant a “bitch” multiple times, sources said. In a summarized version, sources said Green shouted, “You’re a bitch and you know you’re a bitch.” The rhetoric, sources said, continued even when Kerr attempted to direct the team’s attention to his whiteboard.   &gt;   &gt;Green blurted to Durant something along the lines of, “We don’t need you. We won without you. Leave,” sources said.

"Wiggins is what he is, but he was brought in to be Harrison Barnes, not Kevin Durant. The core next season is Still Curry, Klay, and Draymond. DRuss would've been ancillary and so will Wiggins.  The biggest thing I've taken away from this is the fact that Warriors got a likely 2021 lottery pick that they can do a lot of things."
I honestly think he can be better. He is called Maple Jordan for a reason. Cause he is like Micheal Jordan. Kevin Durant never got compared to MJ.
"Using this one weird trick, the Golden State Warriors turned Kevin Durant into Andrew Wiggins and 2 high schoolers."
https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y1=2019&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Andrew+Wiggins&amp;player_id2_select=Andrew+Wiggins&amp;y2=2020&amp;player_id2=wiggian01&amp;idx=players  Of course he isn't close but the Warriors were overpowered.  This makes the league a fair fight
"Imagine Kevin Durant and then imagine he vanished into thin air and left no trace of talent remaining, thats where Wiggins is."
So they traded Kevin Durant for Wiggins lmao
"Masai Ujiri, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, AD in 2022... must I go on?"
If you honestly think chucking ball hog stat padding Westbrook is better than Kevin Durant you don’t deserve an opinion
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Wilt Chamberlain 4. Magic Johnson 5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 6. Kevin Durant 7. Tim Duncan 8. Larry Bird 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Shaquille O'Neal
Kevin Durant is the greatest of all time...  You stupid kids wouldn't understand. I... I mean he joined Golden State because he had to. Don't ever diss Kevin Durant again
"Leonard had a lingering injury then.  After all the rehabilitation, he had it the whole season last year, he still has it today.  It's described as a degenerative injury. After playing 3-4 games, he needs to rest. He should not play back-to-backs, or it will get worse.  So, it's not that he was healthy in that situation with the Spurs and he refused to play.  A player is the person best to know if he is healthy or not, if it's a wise thing to go out there and force it while that pain in the leg is bothering him.  When the player succumbs to pressure from the team, from team doctor that clears him to play, the result might be like the case of Isaiah Thomas, Kevin Durant: Staying away from the court for one year.   Grant Hill had once appeared to be on his path to become the best player in the NBA. Go back and listen to what he now says on how team doctors and training staff mistreated his injury, to eventually cut his career short.  Part of being an NBA fan should be looking at the cases from the player's perspective as well: they have a short span for performing in the NBA, and making money with which to feed their families thereafter."
73-9 and replaced their worst starter Barnes with Kevin Fuckin Durant.

"They wanted to be sure the vibe was positive for the start of the year and if JJ or Iggy were there it would’ve been strained. We’ve definitely seen a lot of strained locker rooms with grumbling vets and maybe one of the big priorities of the new guys was chemistry. New coach, new stars, established guys getting to prove themselves night after night and riding a wave of good will... none of that works out with pissed off players thinking the coach is a moron and the kids are annoying and acting like the team is keeping them from shining like they should.   We’ve got a good mix of players right now and everybody’s got a good idea of what their role is... they’re working hard and it’s clicking and people are noticing, like every competitor wants. DBs a stone cold scorer, emulating MJ and Kobe, willing his way into space to rise and surprise. JV’s our Big Country Big Man, essential to the Grizzly brand, gracefully bouncing his way to easy baskets. Ja’s a turbo Derrick Rose with Chris Paul vision, an assasin who learns all your weaknesses, tires you out then attacks. Brandon Clarke is like a zenned out archer, swooping in for a surprise floater or rising behind for the quickstab alleyoop. Melton will just let you pass then poke it out from behind you - as a player almost as embarassing as getting dunked on. Insanely long arms and a worldclass nose for disruption. Jaren will sink 7 threes, cross you up twice for sexy dunks then block you four times while looking like a gangly Kevin Durant. Tre Jones is the secret weapon, the happy backup pg who keeps the 2nd unit tight, taught BC his floater and is gaining confidence every game. And a/t ratio look it up its amazing.   They’re all determined to sap your will to win and they do it well. Nothing saps your will like Grayson Allen getting hot from three then sparking off a thunder jam through your three dejected forewards. Tone is successfully set for unproven young savants to do that thing they’re great at and flourish with it. Hopefully JJ gets to do that too.   TL/DR JJs been injected with enthusiasm and will now contribute with vigour"
Wow Kevin durant is cool and has a very large penis
"little bit of a difference between one team whose best shooters are Duncan Robinson, Meyers Leonard and Kelly Olynyk compared to the other with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant"
Smh and to think the Knicks could've become all Kevin's last year.   Sign Kevin Durant  Draft Kevin Porter Jr.  Trade for Kevin Love  Trade for Kevin Huerter  Start Kevin Knox.  New York Kevins would've been unstoppable.
Marial Shayok and Kevin Durant
It was Kevin Durant. You can't just take Seattle away from someone like that.
Yeah those Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant guys being fully healthy change absolutely nothing.
Let’s not forget that Eric Gordon is a bit worse than Kevin Durant
"Let’s not forget, Houston is playing Russell Westbrook and Eric Gordon instead of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant would eat.
"I know you said 2-6, but if we add Kevin Durant I think we'd be favorites in the East."
These were made before the accident. I saw them on discount chinese e-commerce sites I use for drone parts. I think there was a Kevin Durant version
Kevin Durant  Rondo
Stephen A. Smith publicly endorses Kevin Durant to be the Knicks' new player
"Chris Haynes is the best! If you're into podcasts, I'd suggest checking his out. He has candid interviews with a wide variety of hoopers, from Dame Lillard to Kevin Durant."
"What happened to the Warriors GM being adamant that they didn’t sign Russell to trade him but here he is discussing a potential trade deal. The guy comes off as such a weasel, especially how he handled the Kevin Durant injury saga too. Says one thing but does another"
"We've been the underdog story, so if you like that kind of thing, welcome aboard. Nets traded away their entire future back in 2013 and despite having basically no picks, we've rebuilt to the point that when Kevin Durant comes back from injury next year, a lot of people are saying we'll be contenders for a championship. Hit up our sub /r/GoNets if you want to get a feel for the community. We're always happy to welcome new people who want to take this journey."
"There are not many players better than prime Kevin Durant, and McGrady is not one of those players.  McGrady never had an opportunity to play on an all-time great team and so people will never have a clear understanding of how good he truly was, but Kevin Durant was simply better.  Kevin Durant will give you similar production on much higher efficiency, and an invaluable skill for any leader (and first-option) is the ability to hit their free throws consistently, and McGrady struggled from the line.   It also doesn’t help that McGrady couldn’t get out of the first round as the first (or second) option, and so all of his fans will turn and point the finger at how bad his teams were, but the reality is almost every superstar has lead their team to at least one series win.   Lastly, McGrady has about 5-7 (7 is pushing it) where he produced at an elite level, while Durant has been elite longer than that, and McGrady might have **one** season where one could argue he was better than Durant."
"I mean, they have Giannis and *middleton*   Compare bandwagoning that to   Stephen curry  Kevin Durant  Klay Thompson.   Both extremely talented teams. But one far more entertaining"
"lol that vote for Melo  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;When the voting was announced Sunday afternoon, I was flabbergasted to learn I was the lone voter among 121 to not give LeBron a first-place vote, truly believing Anthony, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, and perhaps even Kobe Bryant would snag a first-place vote or two....   &gt;   &gt;The perception that I knew the other 120 voters cast their first-place votes for LeBron and that I went against the grain as some kind of statement is inaccurate. I have covered the league for years, watched Jordan lose the 1996-97 MVP to Karl Malone, and understand that for one season, certain players just elevate their games. I thought Anthony was the most valuable player to his team this season, not the best player in the league.  &amp;#x200B;  good times"
"right because Brooklyn 100% has Kevin Durant active and playing every night, you're very smart."
"Little no named guy, kevin durant."
"&gt; I mean, yes he is a fantastic athlete, but that doesn't change the fact that the Cavs were double teaming Curry literally every possession, including on the fast break. That's what gave him so many wide open dunks.  Ah, like in Game 1 of the 2017 Finals with 5 minutes left in the 1 quarter. Steph brings up the ball in transition with only a chasing Tristan Thompson trying to deny the center of the floor while Durant beats his man and cuts to the rim for an easy dunk.  So, clearly it wasn't *every* play because anyone without a KD hate boner could watch just a few minutes of those series and tell you that what you said was a blatant lie. The Cavs defense absolutely sucked at rotating, and [KD said as much when someone asked them how they exploited so many holes in their defense:](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/kevin-durant-reveals-how-warriors-exposed-cavs-defense)  ""We all watched Cleveland all year,"" Durant said on The Bill Simmons Podcast. ""Just watching how they play defense. They pack the paint a lot and they were good on initial action, but after two or three passes, we found out we can get a lot of stuff on the back end.""  &gt;I'll never forget JR and I think Irving double teaming Curry at the three point line in a 2on2 fast break when Durant had the ball.  [And I'll never forget when Durant drove to the rim and drew every defender to collapse on him before he kicked it to a wide open Steph for a three:](https://i.imgur.com/cXXMQ50.gif)  Ah! That's right though, that must have been from some other game and some other team because Steph was doubled *every play* right?"

"Ngl I at first understood this as:  [Rich Kleiman] Kevin Durant confident, could be in running to be next Knicks president  Imagine that world"
"Oh wow can I not use ""whole career"" to describe 11 out of 12 seasons? You know like I literally said in the comment you responded to?  Poor westbrook, only had multiple time MVPs and a 28ppg paul george his whole career.  Put fucking Kevin Durant on Dame's team and look what his numbers look like when people suddenly can't trap him at half court.  I remmber when people used to say Kyrie was better than him too and then they saw what he looks like in the playoffs when he's actually the focal point of the defense and doesn't have Lebron on his team"
"I like the kid, I really do, but you gotta wait till at least your sophomore year to talk that kind of shit. You’re averaging 18 a game on a .500 team, calm your little skinny ass down. You’re talking down on a 3 times champion. Kevin Durant doesn’t get a ring or a finals mvp without Steph and Klay spacing the floor for him, and that’s facts."
James Dolan is helping the Nets more than Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant. He seriously should be considered part of their Big Three.
"It’s everything he’s capable of doing on the court. He’s damn near 7 foot with guard like handles and a deadly shot from 3. He was even starting to get better at defense. LeBron is getting up there in age, and Kevin Durant was close to next. I think Giannis has it right now.   I’m not sure if he’ll be the same after the Achilles, and I really hope he is. I still want a few more years of prime Durant."
"inb4 Warriors turned Kevin Durant into Wiggins and picks, now give me upvotes"
"Eh, KD never said he wasn't a leader. He rather be someone who's ""leads by example"".  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Being able to play again was restoring Durant's perspective in a hurry. “I came here to play basketball in the exact same way I'm playing it right now,” he said contentedly. Over the summer, he'd signed a second deal with the Warriors, for less money than he could've asked for, and the Warriors had in turn used the money he saved them to re-sign several of Durant's teammates. He was enjoying being just a member of a team, rather than the face of it. “Steph Curry is the face of the franchise, and that helps me out, because I don't have to,” he said. “I don't want to have to be the leader. I'm not a leader. I'm bad at saying, ‘Stand behind me and follow me.’ No. I'm one of those guys that's just like, ‘Let's do this shit together. Let's just work everybody together. I don't mind being on the front line with you, but let's come and do it together.’ **That's my way of leadership. I'm leading by example.”**   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; [https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-is-just-heating-up-profile](https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-is-just-heating-up-profile)"
"Yeah I'm sure some dude Kevin Durant didn't had anything to do with it. In addition, Magic Johnson called him worst PG he ever saw play in the finals.  One year KD got hurt, your boy missed playoffs. KD made second round without him."
Thanks for commenting totally not the real Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant. All the other guys are retired.
1- Kevin Durant  2- Giannis  3- MJ
Kevin Durant
"Why not add Kevin Durant to that list of players, and make it a guaranteed championship?  I mean, you couldn't possibly lose with that lineup!"
"thats a hard disagree,   Celtics had title expectations until Hayward had his injury and then came back the next year and was basically a negative but was still get minutes for some reason, the Bucks would have swept the Blazers, judging by how poorly Lillard played against them in the reg season.  &gt;Westbrook’s thunder teams got overhyped and he lost in the first round every time and got destroyed by dame head to head (first time wasn’t on him tho tbf)  Sure he outplayed Westbrook and is the better player right now but you can't just take away what Westbrook has done especially with KD, although he has been pretty awful the last 2 playoffs.  &gt;Also I have no doubt that dame could play as well as they do as a 2nd option, he just didn’t get to play with lebron James and Kevin Durant  if, if ,if."
"Not when both players get completely exposed by themselves, Celtics had title expectations, got gentleman swept by the bucks  Westbrook’s thunder teams got overhyped and he lost in the first round every time and got destroyed by dame head to head (first time wasn’t on him tho tbf)  Also I have no doubt that dame could play as well as they do as a 2nd option, he just didn’t get to play with lebron James and Kevin Durant"
What. The only competitive series you named with the Cavs is from the years that Kevin Durant wasn't on the team lmao. There was no competition at all once KD joined. And yeah in 2015 Lebron took a 2-1 lead without Irving or Love playing all series.
"i mean, ja definitely didn't come hard lol. a pic of kevin durant... championship teammate of curry? i mean its not like curry was the one who left his team for KD.  i agree with the other dude. this is a bunch of nothing, but the fact that steph is a million times more accomplished than ja makes him lose by default"
"His beef is with Iggy. Steph defends Iggy saying he won ringz. Ja responds saying at least 2 of those are a direct result of Kevin Durant. He respects Curry, this isn't a shot at him. He is ""responding"" to Curry but the beef is still with Iggy."
Kevin Durant was the best player in the league before he tore his Achilles and didn't need load management.
"No it doesn't. What the hell are you talking about? Minneapolis deserves its team. If fan appreciation was so high, why the fuck didn't a ROY Kevin Durant put asses in seats for Seattle?"
"Kevin Durant not being on another contending team was a necessity for the Warriors. If he had played with the Knicks and missed the playoffs every year, that would have been good for GSW."
Like Kevin Durant
"The nets in Brooklyn just got Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. PG wanted to play on the clippers and so did Kawhi. Kemba signed with a big city in Boston, as did Al Horford. Lebron went to LA, KD went to GS. The past two years, LA/BAY//Boston/NY the biggest cities with the most fans and things to do got all the best free agents and players due to people wanting to play there. Can it be any more obvious?   Clippers/Warriors/Celtics/Nets/Lakers   We’re all decent teams but got way better through free agency cuz guess what? People sign where the cities are better...crazy concept for u to understand apparently"
The Warriors would not have won another championship if Kevin Durant had not signed there. Remember that Draymond's offense went straight to shit after 2016. The Cavs would have beat them in 2017 (Probably Spurs if Kawhi doesn't go down) and Houston definitely would have beat them in 2018.
&gt; I think Harris is a better defender at this point but you could argue either way  I'm sorry but that is laughable. Jrue guards everyone from Harden to Durant to Kevin Love for the Pelicans.
"Then why not give MVP to the best player on the best team every year?  Why not give it to Curry or Durant in 2017, Tony Parker in 2014, Joakim Noah(?) in 2012, Kevin Garnett in 2008, Chauncey Billups in 2006, and etc?  If the only metric we can measure is wins, then whoever is the best player on the team with the most wins is the most valuable player."
Nah they are missing Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka.
I blame Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant is now a new verb in the Webster's dictionary.  Kevin Durant (v.) - to take the saying ""If you can't beat them, join them"" literally"
"Trade Tobias and Kork for Aaron Gordon  Look to the warriors for a Ben/DLo swap (Which leads to Ben *BEiN* flipped again)  See if the Hawks would fuck around and take Horford booty ass contract  Or if the pistons would do  •Horford and A first  For  •Luke ""Kevin Durant"" Kennard"
He Kevin Durant them
"Hold on.    Okay, so the Shams tweet is essentially the source here. I understand why you'd want some confirmation beyond just dude tweeting at us. But the simple fact is that the organization is never going to make their conversations with players around these types of negotiations public. So, if you're expecting an official Grizzlies source on the matter out there, you're not going to get one.     And while you want to dismiss the Shams source, I think it's too difficult to ignore how deep fella was in all this. Shams didn't just restrain himself in the Iggy matter to this tweet alone. Shams made a lot of ""breaking"" annoucments regarding the Grizz-Iggy situation as it unfolded... too many really. Most of us on the Memphis side of things are convinced Shams was working as a mouth-piece for the Iggy camp. The tweets were often quick to highlight Iguodala's amazing career and imply a need for him to do things on his own terms. I would argue that if the Shams tweet was misleading, it was most likely because the narrative being fed to Charania was misleading.     Again, we don't have an inside the franchise source. But, for whatever it's worth, the media surrounding the team and the league certainly bought the story. The Shams tweet got treated as real news by everyone from YahooSports, NBCSports, USAToday, ESPN, etc. Memphis grizz-centric media like Chris Herrington and Chris Vernon wrote and spoke during that brief window as if the Grizzlies were seeking to have Iggy in the lockerroom and on the court. In their reporting of the after-math and separation agreement, they certainly didn't treat the outcome as some forgone conclusion.    But, all this is heresay. I get it. I tend to be a skeptic as well, and I'm certainly biased on this topic. We all agree there was a media shit storm surrounding whatever was happening between Iggy and Grizzlies behind the scenes. If we exclude Shams, there is only one reliable source regarding the whole ordeal that did make public statements: Iggy.    Andre Iguodala was not afraid to talk: &gt;“Yo, I got this crazy story,” Iguodala tells NBC Sports Bay Area. “No one knows. No one knows this story. But I have a sense that something is going down; Bob Myers and I are pretty cool. We have our conversations, so we’re on the same page. It was, ‘It might happen, but it might not. Most likely, it will. So, we’ll see.’  &gt;“So, I’m texting my wife, telling her I’ll probably get traded because I think it’s 100 percent sure, even though everyone else is saying, it’s only a chance. Then, once KD (Kevin Durant) left, I’m like, ‘Yeah, I’ll probably get traded. They’re probably going to do a sign-and-trade, so they can get something back, to at least get assets for him.’ No one was thinking that. But I was thinking they’ll want to get assets back because they can’t just let him go. And they’ll probably move me as well. So, she asked me where I thought I would go. I said, ‘I don’t know, I’ll probably end up in Memphis or some s--t.’  &gt;“She says, ‘For real?’ I was like, ‘Maybe. But probably not. I don’t know.’  &gt;“The next day, I got the message. It was Memphis. I fell out laughing.”    Then the interviewer asks about Iggy's feelings on joining the Grizzlies    &gt;“We’ll see. OK, maybe I shouldn’t say we’ll see. But we’re trying to figure out things on both sides. They’re trying to figure out some things, and I’m trying to figure out some things. As of today, we’re on the same page. Camp opens the next week. We’ll see. We’re on the same page, though.”    Then, when asked if he was heading for a buyout.  &gt;“At this point, the only buyout that makes sense -- if I’m speaking on someone else’s behalf, thinking as an agent -- is you don’t leave money on the table,” he says. “Especially in this league. Because you’ll never get it back, no matter what people say. Negotiations are a tactic, so you’ve got to be careful how you approach it, or how you verbalize what you would do going forward. But you can’t leave anything on the table.”    The interview ends with this line from the reporter:  &gt;Training camps open next week. The regular season begins on Oct. 22. Iguodala says he hasn’t bothered to look at the schedule, which he always does, partly to designate certain days, home or away, for golf possibilities.    Now, all that's open for interpretation. If you think the Grizzlies weren't looking to have Andre play for them, those statement read *VERY* differently than if you're someone thinking the Grizz wanted him. But as someone who's admittedly biased, I believe the narrative. I believe that the Grizzlies were hoping to have Andre Iguodala with the team as a veteran wing player who could get some minutes, mentor the youngsters, and eventually get moved for assets. In the end, Memphis did exactly that with Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder. I believe that Shams was getting fed a narative directly from Iggy's camp, which they used to help steer the public perception of the negotations. I believe that Andre used his leverage as he saw fit to get the best deal for himself, which included not having to report to the Grizzlies, which is fair enough. But I also believe that it is equally fair for Memphis to feel slighted, and to think of Andre's tactics as a bit underhanded. I believe it was legit for some young guns to call the man out like they did, and it was fair for them to view the situation how they did.    Not one bit of this falls into the relm of certainty. We're all in the mist on how this actually went down between the parties. But I think my narrative has weight. If you want to question the validity of the common Memphis position here, that's fair. But there's plenty of context to examine here. Don't make it out like we're just pulling this shit out of thin air."
Win a championship without Kevin Durant oh wait

Nobody in the nba today has spent their entire careers being surrounded by the amount of freakish talent KD has. (Tho Kawhi is giving him a run for his money) If Wade got to play with that OKC team something tells me he’d had more than a single finals appearance."
As a kid I was always more of a players fan than a team fan(aside from me rooting for the Raptors) . The Thunder   was the first team that I gravitated towards.  They were young and exciting plus Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant we're my favorite players(Russ still is). Even tho Russ got traded I still rock with the Thunder.

"Great visuals and interesting topic. But honestly, I cannot stand a Bill Simmons unsubstantiated hot take. There's nothing about his points we should take seriously. Simmons starts with a premise of: ""I like watching these teams for these reasons"" and generalizes it to ""therefore, everyone must like watching the NBA for the same reasons, which is why the NBA is ruining things"". Such bad logic. He says the NFL is doing it right: yet their ratings were down 5 years in a row before 2020. He says the NBA is doing it wrong: yet ratings were climbing just a few years ago. A problem for these issues is that both sports and TV ratings are a zero-sum game. The NBA could be doing everything right but ratings can still go down if other economic/market trends are at play.  In all sports, teams go through eras of homogenization (chase the schemes of the front-runners) and eras of diversification (teams find new efficiencies to beat the front-runners). NBA offensive schemes are quite dynamic between teams. How those shot charts emerge is quite different from team-to-team: from motion to iso to PnR.   We are in an era of analytics. All coaches/teams in all sports are using data-driven methods to find advantages and efficiencies. MLB is doing it with the ""three true outcomes"", the NBA is doing it with the shot chart, the NFL is doing it with the passing game, etc. Yet we still see teams vary with how they pursue these advantages. In MLB, we get diversity in teams from the 2014-15 Royals small ball or the Twins' homer ball to exploit advantages. Same as the NBA: we had the Warriors motion, the LeBron drive-and-kick, and the Rockets iso-3ball. Same as the NFL: we have the Chiefs pass-heavy scheme but then the Titans find efficiencies in the running game again.  I think the biggest issue for the NBA this year is: (1) the Warriors dynasty is on hiatus for a year, (2) Kevin Durant is out entirely, 3) Philly is down after hinting at something more last year, and (4) some of the top teams are not from classic big-markets like Milwaukee, Denver, Utah, and Toronto (huge market but not a US favorite). Last but not least, one of the NBA's biggest long-term burdens has been what the fuck to do with the New York Knicks. Market-wise, the Knicks should be a ""gem of the East"". But instead, NYK is a perennial sinkhole and cannot help to buffer the random ups-and-downs of the other big-market teams (like LAL last few years and GSW this year). I think this is especially felt in the ratings as most NBA viewers are in the Eastern timezone. Sadly, a Bill Simmons hot take doesn't have the capacity or nuance to discuss any of this."
"2011 I have LeBron, Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, Amar'e Stoudemire. With only LeBron as a lock.   Wade was all NBA 2nd team that year for what it's worth. I have him no lower than 7th that year. I said 10 to be conservative."
Kevin Durant is way better passer and Is significantly superior In the most important part of the playoffs.....Scoring. Ability to create your own shots and hit from anywhere efficiently. You can’t scheme KD out of a game. Giannis turns into a center in high leverage games.   “KD never led a teams as far and as long as Giannis”  OKC has been To 4 WCF in 6 years.

"No one asked for this but I'm dropping my predictions on who's going to make the roster if EVERYONE opts in (which they won't).  Guards:  Team USA often have their point guards play the wings if they're large enough, meaning that they will probably have an abundance of point guards.  - Curry  - Westbrook  - Lillard  - Harden  - Kyrie Irving  Wings:  Some of these wings could play Power Forward or even center, depending on the score or the country they're facing.  - Lebron  - Kawhi  - Paul George  - Kevin Durant  Center:  Team USA likes to have at least 3 real big men on standby, so with that said:  - Andre Drummond  - Bam Adebayo  - Anthony Davis  If/when players choose to opt out to 'prep for the upcoming season' or suffer injuries, these are the guys I expect to get slots first:  - Klay Thompson  - Jayson Tatum  - Chris Paul (legacy spot)  - Jimmy Butler  - Kemba Walker  - Draymond Green / Myles Turner"
"Stephen Curry Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant LeBron James Anthony Davis  Damian Lillard James Harden Klay Thompson Paul George Bam Adebayo  Barring injuries these are the first 10 players I would go with. The last two spots are tough as hell and I would probably go with either Westbrook, Lowry or Butler for 1 spot and Draymond, Harrell or Howard for the other.   Regardless I really want to see the starting 5 of Curry, Bron, Whi, KD and AD share the floor together."
"My ideal squad right now, before injuries and drop outs:  C Anthony Davis - Bam Adebayo PF LeBron James - Paul George - Draymond Green SF Kevin Durant - Klay Thompson SG Kawhi Leonard - James Harden  PG Steph Curry - Chris Paul - Damian Lillard"

Kevin Durant was on an all time playoff run before his injury this is disrespectful lol
"Kevin Durant has also always been better than Steph, and even Harden is arguably on the same level"
My Kevin Durant Rant:  Kevin leaving OKC was the best thing to happen to basketball in the past decade.  It gave the NBA a true dynasty to root against and a league wide villain to hate. Two things that do a wonderful job of drawing in new and casual fans.  Plus the slimiest owners in the league team got worse.  Which is an added bonus for the world.  (and maybe a touch extra for the city of Seattle)
Because KEVIN DURANT CHOKED IN 2012. I would’ve left too but they definitely all could’ve played better against the Heat and Kevin Durant choked against GS in 2016 and he did blame it on Russ.
&gt; Kevin Durant didn’t give Russ and Harden and himself the time to develop.   That's not true at all lol. the guy that traded Harden didn't give them the time to develop.
"But I like Kevin Durant , I cant be a fan on principle"
Kevin DuRANT
Kevin Durant who’s not a snek
Kevin Durant is a top 10 nba talent (not career) of all time. It’s Durant
"It's Kevin Durant   1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, doesn't matter"
"Kevin Durant. Even when he's not feeling it, people are going to struggle to get to his shot."
"It is though, as that core of players never came close to any level of success they had with Kevin Durant.  Just because they hit a decent percentage on wide open three's it doesn't change the fact that they were not good shooters and KD was stuck with a team that lacked spacing and a point guard that thought he was better than him."
"We can go back and forth  forever on this. By too little too late, I mean only showing up in game seven wasn't enough to win the series.   It was too little in that he didn't perform well over the series as evidence by his team worse fg%, and again he was especially bad in game 6 at home when his team had the best chance to win it.  In what world is Kevin Durant shooting 28% over the series not choking?"
yall truthfully are everything that yall say yall hate about kevin durant lol
"The most surprising thing is that Kevin Durant has more dunks in the 2000s than Vince Carter, who never cracked this top 10 despite the fact that he's been playing this entire time and didn't stop like Shaq did.  My brain can't register that."
TIL Kevin Durant is good friends with one of the cofounders of Duran Duran
Yeah let's pretend like all those guys were being guarded in the same way as Kevin freaking Durant. The game plan was to stop him. It's almost like you people don't understand basketball sometimes.
"[Better quality video](https://www.facebook.com/ESPN/videos/kevin-durant-getting-shots-up/949835792136343/)  To be fair, most players are not KD. We already know he's an all-time great level player on the court. The only thing that matters is if his body holds."
They do dunk but usually when they do in a game they're as tall as Kevin Durant or LeBron 😂
"Here's another fact. OKC hasn't gotten out of the first round since he's left, and Kevin Durant has won back to back championships with back to back Finals MVPs."
"I am so confused about what you're even trying to say 😂 you avoiding saying every negative thought is ok, but someone not calling kevin durant a snake bitch as soon as they see him is somehow not okay in your eyes? Why do you get a pass for not being brave enough to say every thought you have to peoples faces? Are you scared or something? Are you not able to fight?"
The funny thing is you could be kevin Durant because he has so many burner accounts and is scared of saying things to people's faces
Yes you can. It's Kevin fuckin Durant. On no planet is 28% in a playoff run acceptable.
TEXAS Lamarcus Aldridge Kevin Durant Avery Bradley DJ Augustin PJ Tucker  6th: Tristan Thompson
"I don't know about that. A quick Google doesn't yield any results, and [this](https://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/29/12322888/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-return-thunder-rumor) article would seem to disprove it."
"This is kind of a no-shit thing that you’re just reducing to nonsense.  Certain star players have the ability to elevate any team of scrubs. And it’s fewer than you think. Lebron, Shaq, Kobe, Dame, MJ, Tim Duncan, Hakeem. Those caliber players.   For every other roster, including those like Anthony Davis, Karl Anthony Towns, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Harden, TMac, coach matters."
"No I’m trying to tell you that thinking Wiggins makes sense as a role player flies in the face of everything he’s shown on a nba court. It’s not about being “good” “bad” “better” “worse” it’s about FIT, and that’s Wiggins problem. He didn’t fit with us, he doesn’t fit with you, he doesn’t fit with any team trying to win games, because when he DOES have the ball, he scores at a below average rate (tho- he CAN create 1 man offense at any time which is just sadly ignored as if it wasn’t one of the #1 skills an nba player needs).  When he DOESNT have the ball. Well, he’s useless. And guess who has a team where he won’t have the ball as often, you do. Maybe you think your team can magically fix that about him. I dont, I don’t say I don’t think his game can change at all, he could improve some. But he IS NOT HARRISON BARNES because he is Andrew Wiggins, he’s not a cog, he’s way way WAY more similar to Kevin Durant in the way he plays JUST HE DOESNT MAKE THE SHOTS and is worse in every way, duh.   What you need from him or don’t need, DOES NOT change who he is. We’ve needed several different things from different years of wolves teams from him. But he never changed. Just got worse under thibs. Then slightly better again. Never a change in play style   Like it’s a case of a worse player would be better in that spot. Someone like Covington would have been astronomically better on your team, plus you know, has actually shown some capacity for being part of a winning team at some point in his life"
Anybody taking 3 shots in the first half   Should not be named Kevin Durant
"There was a post a while back that argued Russ was OKC's best player in the 2016 playoffs and was easily their best player in the WCF.  ###Round 3: vs. Golden State Warriors  ||Shoo|Shoo|Shoo|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per|Per| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|FG%|3P%|FT%|MP|PTS|TRB|AST|STL|BLK| |Kevin Durant|.423|.286|.918|41.3|30.0|8.0|2.9|1.7|1.7| |Russell Westbrook|.395|.317|.820|39.1|26.7|7.0|11.3|3.7|0.0|  Wow. This is definitely the most controversial series of the three. There was a ton of discussion over who ""choked the series away"". I'm not going to go into detail regarding that as this OC is already long enough, but let's take a look at their series numbers.  Much to my surprise, Russ and KD had roughly the same efficiency this series. KD's HORRIBLE 3pt shooting streak continued in the WCF. He once again played more minutes and scored more PPG than Russ, but Russ once again put up almost 4x as many assists and over twice as many steals as KD while playing fewer minutes.  ||Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva|Adva| |:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |Player|TS%|eFG%|ORB%|DRB%|TRB%|AST%|STL%|USG%|ORtg|DRtg|GmSc| |Kevin Durant|.539|.458|2.3|17.8|10.1|12.4|2.0|31.9|106|106|20.1| |Russell Westbrook|.509|.436|5.4|13.2|9.3|50.3|4.6|32.6|109|104|23.0|  KD had a higher TS%, but Westbrook once again dominates every single other category. Same story as the rest of the playoffs. It's worth noting that KD played like complete garbage the last 2 games of the series, where just one win would have punched in the Thunder's ticket to the finals.  It's tough to make a judgement on this series, but I still think Russ was better in the WCF because of his outstanding overall play, especially considering his playmaking, defense, and excellent play in transition."
Kevin Durant is and was the biggest bitch in NBA history. Kyrie is a close 2nd. They are perfect together
https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/02/07/kevin-durant-explains-why-he-left-okc-i-was-tired-of-having-to-be-the-only-guy-that-can-make-3s-make-jump-shots-consistently/
"I honestly don't think the Nets need Irving. I guess KD gets to bring two friends in with him, though. Seriously, imagine that this team will give all those Taureen Prince minutes to Kevin Durant next year."
"Kevin Durant explains why he left GSW: ‘I was tired of having to be the third-best guy that could make 3s, male jump-shots consistently’"
It wasnt smart because he wanted a ring to get respect.  And no HOF player in NBA history is less respected than Kevin Durant.
"For who?  Why does it make sense in your mind that the Nets would sign and trade for Wiggins, when the alternative is getting Kevin Durant?"
"Kevin Durant Explains Why He Left GSW: “I Was Tired Of Having To Be The Only Guy That Can Drive Inside, Dunk It Consistently”"
Stop fucking saying that hes better scorer than kobe he is not. Guy still is not comfortable driving right or taking mid rangers. Pls. Kobe had everything. You can even say Kevin Durant but no stat loving not played guys love to think that Harden is better then Kobe or Kd. Just stop this nonsense.
What? Charles Barkley isn’t even in kds league if we’re talking scoring. Also kd won mvp over LeBron in his prime  Imagine getting downvoted for saying Charles Barkley isn’t a better scorer than Kevin fuckin Durant
"It does matter what I asked, because it directly responds to the comment you made   &gt;”We lost kawhi”  I’ll ask again (we both know the reason you *still* haven’t answered it), is losing Kawhi as bad as losing Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thomson, and Andre Iguodala?"
"&gt; Admit that it was soft move, learn to take a joke and not be so sensitive  This is Kevin Durant we're talking about. That's just impossible."
"I mean ball movement is a thing, they also had Victor Oladipo and this guy named Kevin Durant. Reggie was a great backup before they got rid of him. There were plenty of options to build like an actual offense beyond give the ball to Russ, let him do whatever for 65% of their possessions"
"NBA Media hyped up the fact that Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are some massive ass drama queens with ten foot tall poles up their asses. False.   I have no qualms with the fact that Durant lost the series for the Thunder. He was their guy and couldn’t show up. But it’s different when the Warriors are able to essentially disregard everyone else on the court and only focus on him or Russ. KD was the best shooter on that team and the only shooter on that team. Durant shooting worse than his teammates is commonplace when you have to take up an offensive load like that. The system that OKC had set up around that time wasn’t exactly the greatest, either. Current OKC is good because they have shooters, several scorers (Shai and Gallinari) and a great pass-first point guard (CP3).   No one else could shoot on that thunder squad. That’s why they lost. Durant had a bad postseason that year- I’m not denying that whatsoever. But it’s still a failure on the team as a whole nonetheless. Roberson will not be the guy to hit any sort of jumpshot. That team couldn’t move the ball to save their lives. Just iso after iso after iso.  The fault lies with coaching and the lack of any relatively decent shooters. Any team needs a guy who can spice the floor- something the Thunder were horrendous at. This is why I think Donovan is a shit coach and still to this day. The blame lies on the team as a whole, not just Durant.  Durant using burners is weird and all but the dude is famous as shit and I don’t think he’d want to be saying all the shit he does using his main account. People on Reddit use throwaways all the time to retain anonymity. I just saw it like that but with a famous person.   Kyrie clearly has issues following the loss of his grandfather and there are definitely some underlying mental issues that come with NBA life that he might be struggling with.   If you were to call out just those two I have no issue. But I doubt Dinwiddie and LeVert and DJ and Harris and Allen are all just out there bitching and moaning about something. It’s a generalization that I quite frankly disagreed with."
Kevin Durant with a 45 inch blunt
"Yeah, he could've joined any team, so he chose the same team that stopped OKC from going to the finals. The same team that had the best winning record in the history of the NBA and had two of the greatest shooters in NBA history.  And yet, Kevin Durant calls his decision the ""hardest road"", claiming that the road to a championship is now more difficult as a Warrior.  I am not criticizing him at all for his comments on OKC, and he is justified to feel unsatisfied with their performance. But again, this is not about OKC, it's about Kevin Durant choosing the Warriors."
"We didn’t win a title because Kevin Durant was tired of being the guy, not because he didn’t have guys who stepped up next to him. KD got on a high horse didn’t want to be the greatest scorer of all time and wanted his teammates to pick up slack that wasn’t there (until he decided he didn’t want to shoot the ball as much as he used to)"
Will Kevin Durant ever shut up.
Lol this is on brand for Kevin 'I want people to respect me' durant
"This is the real truth right here. They fucking traded for Oladipo who ended up being an all-star and a monster at the SG position. With him, RWB, KD, and Steven Adams they legitimately had 4 top 5 starters at their position in the NBA *at the same time.* Instead, KD jumped ship and joined the fucking Warriors. His explanation for it was total BS, too. He said that because LeBron beat them he didn't feel like he was doing anything wrong by joining them. Well what fucking team was he going to join had the Warriors won? Every team had the cap space to sign him that off-season. Was he going to go to the Cavs? It would have been equally ridiculous.  Fuck Kevin Durant. He ruined 3 years of the NBA."
"Yeah I’m familiar with Kevin Durant. Of course that’s true. My point is, Curry’s not a bad defender. No one should “lock down” Durant—no one really can. Steph did a fine job, and KD didn’t; why act like Steph’s such a low standard of defense to talk down on Durant’s WCF play? That wasn’t the real matchup anyway, it’s just a weird oversimplification of an excellent 7 game series."
Every single time a snake comes up in one of my child's books I always refer to it as Kevin Durant  Future generations will know
There’s no scenario where 6’3 Steph Curry should ever be able to lock down 6’10 Kevin Durant.
"I always disliked Lebron for wanting all the media attention etc. But really, KD trumps it after this one. He keeps coming back to the media to tell them this or that about OKC, sooner or later i'm gonna open reddit to see 'Kevin Durant explains why he left GS: 'I was tired of being the only atletic guy that can drive to the rim consistently'"
Kevin Durant 2016 WCF Game 7:  10/19 from the field and 3/7 from three  Take that as you please.
"isn't that literally the challenge of being ""the guy"" for a team? the fuck? is kevin durant a role player in a superstar's body? also it's not like he was dragging the 2020 knicks around, dude had pieces."
"“Warriors are not getting Kevin Durant”  That 4th of July is burned into my memory. I remember where I was for KD, PG, Melo, and Russ moves  NBA doesn’t surprise me anymore"
"Unpopular opinion but I actually had a bigger problem with this game than game 6. He only took like 9 shots going into the 4th quarter, because of game 6 he played soft. Kevin no one had a problem with you taking 31 shots, you’re the best scorer in the world. It was the shot selection you were taking. In this game you didn’t attack until the end of the game when it was already over, we needed you to be aggressive. People saying he showed up just looked at the box score, Kevin Durant didn’t try to show up until the 4th quarter."
Kevin Durant 2016 WCF Game 6 at home:  10/31 from the field  1/8 from three  Take that as you please
I think the worst missed call I've seen is still Kevin Durant 100% out of bounds saving the ball last season
Lol I’ll never forget the Kevin Durant no-call when he went 3 steps out of bounds against Houston last year.
"Kevin Durant stepping out of bounds, for example. You can just search for it"
"1.  They were tied at with the Warriors and somehow had the advantage? Lmao!  No, [the Rockets were not expected to win that series](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/nba-odds-warriors-still-favorite-win-title-after-kevin-durant-injury) after KD's injury.  Stop with the revisionist history.  Some people thought they had a *better chance* but that is not the same thing. Lol  2.  I'm not talking about a narrative, I'm talking about facts.   Who the hell cares about narrative?  I'm not arguing that.  Go back and read my OP.  I only said one happened with the game pretty much decided.  The other happened mid-quarter, despite the lead.  Again, the Warriors were favorites and it was a close game...you're acting like the Rockets blew a 30 point lead in 7 minutes.  Lol  I already acknowledged 2 of those turnovers came in crunch time as I acknowledged what probably caused those two turnovers, a good ass opponent.  I don't care about fair/unfair criticism, again that's not my point.  You're bringing up all of these strawment arguments that have nothing to do with the original point I made which is simply this:  The Warriors were a damn good team despite KD's absence.  Their record throughout the rest of the playoffs shows that, historical data shows, etc.  Criticism, narrative, comparisons, or whatever else you want to try to bring up is moot."
"Good points. I'd like to add that the league doesn't have a player that the fans really connect to and care about and hasn't for years. Lebron wrecked his public image in 2010 and even with going back to Cleveland, he never fully recovered it. And Kevin Durant, Kyrie, and Anthony Davis seemingly imitated him without realizing how it made each of them look either. So there's not really anyone that people can unabashedly root for. This is why Zion, Luka and Giannis are so important."
"I'm sure there are a lot of things that contributed to the fall in ratings, streaming etc. But I do think that Lebron and Kevin Durant creating two super-teams that ticked fans off for years was a major factor. Not just in the competitive balance and having a league where the ""bad guy"" walked to victory over and over. But also I think Lebron did serious damage to his large-scale public image that he's only partially recovered from. And obviously Kevin Durant screwed his before he even had a chance to establish one."
"This is bad.... real bad lmao. This is straight up terrible officiating. This is on level with the Kevin Durant out-of-bounds no call. That ball had eons dropping before it got ""blocked""."
Not as bad as the Kevin Durant one tbh  https://youtu.be/flz6URTKT4I
Bro Kevin Durant was getting popcorn in the stands against us last season and the refs still said he was in bounds. This was very bad but this is reactionary.
Yeah but why? DLo is atrocious on defense and needs the ball to fully thrive and although Steph is amazing off ball I don't want to see him being relegated to JJ Reddick for a lesser player. At least when Steph took a back seat a bit the past 2 seasons it was for Kevin Fucking Durant.
"i swear i heard someone laugh and say ""kevin durant"", sounded like kenny"
Kevin Durant :( james harden :(
Hi I’m Kevin durant
wow yeah they found shots for *checks notes* Kevin Durant. That must've been a hell of a task!
Kevin Durant is a top 2 player when healthy. Y’all forgot fast huh lol
"KD's camp was almost certainly feeding the media stories throughout the season. I remember in the playoffs when KD was hurt and right before game days there would be a ""new report"" about KD's intentions.  You even had Rich Kleiman giving an on record interview and providing more discussion material about the situation a week before the actual Finals were about to start (https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/22/kevin-durant-rich-kleiman-free-agent-undecided-warriors-knicks )."
Lol. There was a report that KD and Kyrie decided to team up before the 2019 season began (https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2843699-inside-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irvings-plot-to-team-up-in-brooklyn ).  You don't have to let your hatred of Draymond blind you from what actually happened.
Tinfoil theory: Kevin Durant is just a picture of Kyrie Irving that someone stretched vertically without maintaining the aspect ratio
Kevin Durant
"KDs teammates did have his back. they shut it down multiple times when those questions came up. steve kerr, draymond, steph, klay, iggy, all of em, on camera. how bout kd have their backs and at least be upfront w them in the lockerroom?  kd himself has said he knew what he wanted to do. and do you remember all the preparatory moves his agent and business partners were making w his assets? setting up shop in brooklyn, selling his places in the bay etc  not only did kd not clear the air and tell his teammates whether he knew what he was going to do or not, he allowed it to be an open question knowing that the media would have to ask since *its their jobs to ask same as his is to play ball*.   where Kevin Durant will play next is league changing, and rather than reveal the answer he already knew, he allowed it to be an open question saying he ""didnt want to talk about it"", while having his people maneuver his assets for a move and further fueling speculation in the process.  the expectation is that the media shouldnt ask about the biggest potential swing in power in the nba and the palpable friction on the team because it makes KD uncomfortable? when KD is causing and fueling the speculation by not revealing an answer he already knows and purposefully playing coy?  KD had every right to not say shit. but that doesnt mean it wasnt a selfish decision and that doesnt mean the media were villains for asking about it or that his teammates a wrong for calling him on it"
"Kevin Durant and NBA players in general get a lot of money from endrosments too, in many cases a lot more than from contracts. To be' clear i'm not against what you said, i agree with you but i wanted to add that part."
"does anyone remember when Draymond went on The Jump with Rachel Nichols and talked about the Warriors offseason? it was right after he signed the extension. she brought up Kevin Durant leaving, and asked Draymond when he found out. Draymond said he found out when the world found out, and that that's the way it should be. He seemed pretty adamant about how that was KD's decision for himself and that he didn't owe it to anyone to let them know before he made the move. So it's weird to me that's he's switching up on this now, but then again, he did make those comments on The Jump assuming the Warriors would make the playoffs this year; maybe having the worst record in the league left a bit of a bitter taste in his mouth and changed his opinion on that  here's the [video](https://youtu.be/xgkArldKmfQ), KD comments start around 3:25"
They both heavily depended on one another and needed to team up to ensure they would never have another basketball team be a threat to them.   Both were coming off short comings/disappointing runs but Steph has led a team to a title already in comparison to KD. Durant got a system where he could rarely be doubled and Steph got freaking Kevin Durant instead of Harrison Barnes.
"Give him more spacing. If Curry had the ball, you are less likely to help off Kevin Durant than you would if you would against Harrison Barnes. Basically the same benefit that Curry gave KD.   The only reason why KD benefited more is because he got more iso situations and he is a better iso player than Curry."
What exactly did Kevin Durant for improving Curry?
"Currently reading “The Victory Machine” the book about the Warriors run the past few years and it’s really great so far What Draymond is speaking about is also talked about in the book.   He would drift in and out of the team significantly that year. Barely speak during film sessions, argue with the Warriors PR about false blogs or articles, and was upset about how Warriors fans loved Steph more than him.  it goes into great detail that I can’t do it justice.   A quote that stood with me the most and I think I heard it from someone on r/nba before but it was  “Kevin Durant is insecure about his insecurities.”"
"Kevin Durant waited until having a 3-0 lead in the NBA finals to let the team know he was coming back by through a Rachel Nichols interview in a campaign for Rachel Nichols Finals MVP vote. He won that vote by 7-4, though Mark Medina of the Bay Area Newsgroup might have already known Durant had the locked in 6 when he voted with the majority. In that case Nichols was the deciding vote.   He then basically returned to his separation from both the media and the team as soon as he signed for 1 year. So 1 year of ""What's he going to do?"" followed by ""Oh, we know what he's going to do but he won't say it."""
"Kevin Durant. He put OKC on the map, delivered clutch performance after clutch performance and brought us an MVP trophy. That 2014 season was one of the finest I've seen.   Russ may be the heart and soul but Kevin will always be the heavy artillery. He willed us to so many victories"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Rick Barry, Wilt Chamberlain"
"no, because Kevin Durant is a better player than Giannis and the team is now worse than before, plus the unknown of how good will Klay and Curry be after their injuries"
Kevin Durant ruined the comparison
"So this'll be long but basically it's like this. There are 30 teams and each plays 82 games in the regular season. 15 of those teams are in the western conference, 15 are in the eastern conference. Teams play the teams in their conference 4 times a year, and the teams in the other conference 2 times a year.   At the end of the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference are seeded into a playoff bracket based on their w/l record. Playoff series are best of 7 games. Whoever wins the playoffs wins the NBA championship. Right now, we would normally be in the playoffs, but it's been suspended/cancelled for obvious reasons.  Now for the game itself. The most basic rules are simple, and you probably know them already. Putting the ball through the basket gives your team 2 points, except if you shoot it from behind the 3-point line (also called the arc, the perimeter, and a couple other names) which gets you 3 points instead. You need to dribble to run with the ball. Each possession has a 24 second shot clock, which means that once a team gets possession of the ball, they have 24 seconds to make a shot or they lose possession. If you get fouled, you get to shoot undisturbed from the free throw line, and each made shot from there gets you one point (some fouls though just turn over possession to the other team but you'll figure out details like that as you go). There are a lot of other rules but that's what you need to know for now.  There are five positions in basketball (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center), but *generally speaking* this can be simplified to three types of players: guards, wings, and bigs. Below I'll describe in broad strokes what each kind of player does, but there are dozens of exceptions, so don't be surprised when you notice a player that's not conforming to the positions and playstyles I describe.   Guards are the smallest (and often quickest) players, and they have the ball in their hands the most. Their best skills are often (but not always) playmaking, passing, and shooting. They most often operate around the perimeter (3-point line), setting up plays for their teammates and either passing the ball to a wing or big for a 2-point shot or getting open for a 3-point shot. Guards are usually 6""0-6""6. Examples include Steph Curry, Devin Booker, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving.  Wings are bigger players usually with longer wingspans. They set themselves up to receive the ball from guards closer to the basket, but are usually also good at shooting from beyond the three-point line if need be. They're typically stronger players that work to position themselves in such a way where they can get easy shots. Wings are usually 6""5-6""10. Examples include Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant.  Bigs are, as the name implies, the biggest and strongest (but usually the slowest) players. They traditionally play close to the basket, receiving entry passes and brute forcing close shots. Their size also makes them the most important players on defense (again, broadly speaking), since they're hard to shoot over and harder to overpower. They're also very good at getting rebounds, which is when a missed shot bounces off the rim and is collected by either team to gain or regain posession. Examples include Joel Embiid, Karl Anthony-Towns, Nikola Vucevic, and Anthony Davis.  I think that's all the info you need to get started. Let me know if you have any questions or need help picking a team or something. I can also help out if you have any questions about the playstyle of a team you're interested in or want to know more about a specific player. Happy to help"
"The disrespect to Kevin Durant. Especially in the playoffs, KD's midrange numbers are bonkers (both late OKC tenure and his time with GS)"
"Everyone knows Curry has the all-time gravity, I just don't understand why the OP is trying to make this about the Finals MVP.  Do we need to run through ""subtle"" highlights of Kevin Durant averaging 35/8/5 on 70 TS% in that series before people can drop it and admit he deserved FMVP?"
Stephen Curry was also a huge beneficiary of a GOAT scorer like Kevin Durant. Teams can’t load up on him the same way.  I simply don’t see how you can credit Curry for standing in the corner &amp; KD continuously hitting shot after shot over tough defenses.
Kevin Durant approves.
"LeBron was the favorite vs Dallas and shit his pants and cost Wade/Miami a ring.  In 2012  the Thunder with a team of 21 year olds with no Finals experience were favored to beat the Miami Heat with LeBron, Wade, Bosh. What in the fuck? You're going to say LeBron is better than MJ because he beat 12 year old Kevin Durant when Vegas had him losing? That's your argument for why he's above MJ????  Like I said this is the dumbest argument I've ever heard and you have to be a LeBron Stan to even consider it."
MJ years ago on Kobe VS Lebron: Kevin Durant  &amp;#x200B;   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGHuhSKEZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGHuhSKEZ4)   &amp;#x200B;  KD was prolly giddy after that. MJ prolly loves his game
Yeah I see the direct correlation of Kevin Durant leaving because the Bulls traded Pippen for a return and not losing him for nothing.
this is the line of thinking that leads Kevin Durant to leave for the Warriors.
 1. Steve Nash or Trae Young: Nash   2. Dirk Nowitzki or Nikola Jokic: Dirk   3. Kobe Bryant or Kawhi Leonard: Kawhi   4. Tim Duncan or Anthony Davis: 🙄 TD   5. Kevin Garnett or Zion Williamson: Zion   6. Shaquille O’Neal or Giannis Antetokounmpo: Shaq  7. Chris Paul or Ben Simmons: CP3   8. LeBron James or Kevin Durant: KD   9. Dwyane Wade or James Harden: Wade  10. Stephen Curry or Luka Doncic: Curry
"Yeah OP, try reading the first paragraph of a story before posting it:  &gt;&gt; When I released the paperback edition of The Book of Basketball in 2009, I ranked Scottie Pippen 24th all time as a Level Four Hall of Fame Pyramid guy. On my 2020 list, he’s been passed by four players—Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant—landing him at 28th. Here’s what I wrote about Scottie in my book."
Then it should shock you that Kevin Durant can't palm the ball either.
&gt; they also then went on to draft Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.  Idk why people bring this up as if they fucked that draft up. Greg Oden had the potential to be one of the greatest big men to ever play the game. Watch his college tape. Injuries ruined what could have been a remarkable basketball career and that sucks.
"I hope no one ever forgets that not only did the Portland Trailblazers draft Sam Bowie before Michael Jordan, but they also then went on to draft Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.  Might have to fold the franchise."
"I hope no one ever forgets that not only did the Portland Trailblazers draft Sam Bowie before Michael Jordan, but they also then went on to draft Greg Oden over Kevin Durant.  Might have to fold the franchise."
I think Kevin Durant is better than Harrison Barnes tbh
2nd best after Kevin Durant.
"I'd go so far to call Dirk the best mid-range shooter since 1998.  If we're following BkRef shooting splits and calling a mid-range shot anything from 10ft to the 3pt line then Dirk took an incredible 13200 shots from the mid-range and hit 47% of them. That's 56% of his shots. 56%! Nobody comes close to that combination of volume and accuracy. Kobe took a similar number of mid-range shots (11900) but hit a much lower percentage (41%). CP3 comes close in accuracy (47%) but isn't in the ballpark for attempts (5700). Garnett's a good mix of both (8900, 45%) but Dirk was better.   Even if we only consider peak it's the same story. From 05-06 to 13-14 Dirk took 62% of his shots from the mid-range and hit 49% of them. For the sake of comparison those numbers over the last 5 seasons are 37% and 50% for Kevin Durant.  BkRef doesn't have splits pre-1996 and the rise of the 3-pointer means that great shooters won't touch Dirk's volume so this comparison is a little unfair to older guys like Jordan/Bird or younger guys like Steph/Klay. At the same time I don't see much of an argument for Kobe or Durant as better mid-range shooters than Dirk."

Future 1st ballot Hall of Famer gets hit by Kevin Durant
Me: mom can we get kevin durant?  Mom: we have kevin durant at home  At home: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Durrant
Kevin Durant started hot like Luka.  20+ points in the first season and 27+ points in his second.
Kevin Durant is in the top 20 NBA players of all time
I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am.
Kevin Durant is an anagram for   Kvn Urinated  Am I doing this right?
Theres a premium on iso-scoring which Kevin Durant was arguably the best at.
LeBron fans aren’t going to go with conflicting narratives. LeBron haters always want to act like his fans are fucking idiots or something. Don’t take things two different LeBron fans said and try to combine them as some universal sentiment they have. People usually believe one or the other. Non biased fans know the Warriors are one of the greatest dynasties of our generation and have two of the best shooters ever and had an all time great Small Forward in Kevin Durant in the following years. Warriors didn’t get lucky in 2015. Injuries happen but that means other players have to step up and they simply didn’t. In 2016 the Warriors folded under pressure even though they were the better team and people who make excuses will blame the Draymond suspension more than anything else. LeBron is one of the best to ever play but fans emotions on both sides tarnish what he brings to the table. People think emotionally when it comes to LeBron and not logically and people get so fixated on ring count and finals record when it’s not all that goes into being the greatest even if it’s obviously a big part because Bill Russell would be the GOAT if we’re talking pure ring count.
"For me it all falls on Durant, the organization did it’s job to perfection, but for Kevin to say how it’s the hardest road and all that made his move look even weaker. Also people saying how he’s the perfect missing piece, like he’s one of the greatest scorers to ever play the game and can play almost any position, which top 10 team wouldn’t he have been the perfect missing piece to make them title favorites?   And finally the bandwagon, self explanatory."
"2017 Warriors  PG: Steph Curry SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kevin Durant PF: Draymond Green C: Zaza Pachulia  Backups PG: Shaun Livingston SG: Ian Clark SF: Andre Iguodala PF: David West C: JaVale Mcgee  I think this team is the only team that can keep up with (or even exceed) the offensive output of the BR team. If 2/3 or 3/3 of KD/Klay/Steph get hot at a time I could see the '17 Warriors stealing 2 or maybe even 3 games out of ten. I think the only other team that has an argument is the '86 Celtics (the other teams just have players from the BR team), but the '17 Warriors definitely have the best shot."
PG Lowry $1  SG: Kawhi $8  SF: Paul George$7  PF Kevin Durant $9  C: Myles Turner $5  Pretty similar. I think mines better but idk if picking 3 SFs is legal.
Ben Simmons $4  Klay Thompson $7  Kevin Durant $9  KP $4  Bam Adebayo $6
"&gt;but of these six players he'll be the easiest for an average player to guard  Certainly not.  Dude was Kevin Durant before Kevin Durant, scoring-wise.  He could score over absolutely anybody.  The ""easiest"" man-to-man matchup would be Magic, but that's because Magic's true value was in his ability to find teammates.  Stopping him as a scorer would be much easier, as he wasn't much of a shooter and got a huge portion of his points in transition."
"You really need some big men in there. I'd include Wilt and Kareem since they were impossible to defend in the post. Kareem was even respectable for his position at the free throw line. I kind of want to include Maravich because I feel like he would have dominated today. Even during his final, injury filled season, he made something like 10/15 3s. Imagine what Maravich could have done if he had 3 other All-nba level players along side him during the peak of his career.  I know you asked for 5, but I feel like there are 10-12 people who realistically have a very strong argument for top 5:  Michael Jordan Wilt Chamberlain Kareem Abdul Jabbar Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant LeBron James Pete Maravich Stephen Curry Larry Bird Rick Barry George Gervin James Harden  And from the outside looking in would be Jerry West, Julius Irving, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Benard King, Tracy McGrady, Elgin Baylor, Karl Malone, Jerry West, Carmelo Anthony, and Hakeem Olajuwon.  If I had to pick just 5, I'd personally go with:  Wilt since he was an unstoppable force for the most part.  Jordan because of his ability to attack the basket, his mid-range, and his free throw ability. Kareem because he had an unstoppable move, was good at the line for his position, and was a monster in the post.  Bird because of his all-around offensive game and his ability to burn you from outside and at the line(at an all-time clip given his volume).  Maravich because I think his career was short-changed given the talent around him and the era he played in. I genuinely think he could have been an all-time great instead of a HOFamer who deserved better if his career started in the 2010s. He's probably the weakest player on my list and I wouldn't mind switching him out with 5-7 other players since there's a lot of what-ifs surrounding him.   Kobe because he was basically a notch below Jordan at most things, but made up for it somewhat by being a better shooter from our side. Especially if you take away Jordan's inflated seasons.   I'm not sure if I missed anyone, but I think that covers all players in the general discussion for greatest scorers ever."
Kevin Durant. I don’t think his ego would be able to handle the toughness and rudeness from the other players.
&gt;Nobody fears Lebron  A 73-win team literally recruited Kevin Durant to join them precisely because they feared Lebron
"Prime Larry Bird with a green light to shoot more 3’s because of the modern day style of play, would be right up there with Kevin Durant style shooting. Granted being about 3 inches shorter. So him, Tatum and Brown being the big 3 in Boston I can see them easily matching up with either the Lakers or Clippers in the Finals. The Bucks wouldn’t be able to handle all of their scoring plus the Celtics would now be a better team defensively (considering Larry is a sufficient enough athlete in his prime before all of the back injuries to keep up.) All in all i say the Celtics would at least be in the finals if not win rather easily."
"So usually for these kind of debates I kind of mentally imagine a person who has those same attributes in todays game. So for example, Larry was all-defense team back then so I mentally put him as all-defense today. Same thing for his passing, marking him as a genius LeBron/Rondo level passer today. And then the 3s as best shooter in the league, so add that too.     So an All-NBA defender who is the best shooter in the league and also the best passer in the league? So basically like a prime Kevin Durant with better passing but not as good attacking the basket? The guy won 3 straight MVPs.   How is that guy not making the Celtics a favorite. Not a heavy favorite but certainly the best odds to win it all I think."
the competent front office that tried to trade curry and thompson as a package for anyone they could and got lucky that no one wanted them? the team that relied on kevin durant being a lil pussy? lmao
Kevin Durant
Not me but a good friend of mine and her brother were chiling at a cafe (i think you know what kind) in Amsterdam maybe 4-5 summers ago.  They were sitting down when someone tapped the brother's shoulder to ask if they can borrow a light and it was Kevin Durant who was sitting with some friends as well Draymond Green! Her Bro said yea no problem KD and Kevin's demeanor instantly changed and his  entourage started hounding them not to take any photos and to leave the cafe. My friend doesn't care for bball at all so she wasn't having any of it so KD and Dray ended up leaving instead. I think they felt comfortable being able to maintain a lower profile in Europe but were immediately more skeptical of being there once the brother replied and it was clear he was North American from his accent(from Toronto Specifically) and could draw more attention to them. Girl had nothing to gain from telling me that story so i'm inclined to believe her
"Kevin Durant decides to leave the Thunder [2011, colorized]"
"Tons of players have come out talking about Westbrook’s ability in the locker room and as a leader.   Paul George, Victor Oladipo, Kevin Durant, and many other players have all said seeing how hard Westbrook works motivated them to train harder and get in better shape."
played kevin durant 1 on 1 in basketball. im on his youtube channel. he told me to stop talkin shit to him
"LeBron is probably the best overall player ever. He's a living Swiss army knife on the court. His abilities to read the floor, facilitate, score and dictate pace are second to none imo. Easily one of if not the smartest player of all time. You can find players that are better than LeBron in some areas but none are the complete package (rip free throws).  MJ was obviously the better pure scorer and defender but what separates LeBron to me is that he's able to do those things at an all time great level as well while also being able to get other guys involved with ease. Not to mention he's doing it in a harder league. People love to bring up how MJ's Era was tougher because of the physicality but the average nba player is much better than they were back then. Not to say MJ was playing vs milkmen and plumbers but guys are more athletic in today's league. Most individual stats go LeBron way as well.  Now on to the finals. You can look at LeBron's 3-6 record and easily stop this conversation there but I don't think it's that bad with context. In his very first LeBron carried what is widely looked upon as a weak roster to the finals at 23 years old where they played one of the most winningest orgs in NBA history. Is it really fair to expect a 23 year old to beat the 07 Spurs? The Dallas/air conditioning series were really bad so I won't argue if you don't see him as the GOAT because of that. Then in his first year back in Cleveland Kyrie and Klove both go down and LeBron suffers another defeat. It would be hard for any player to win it all after your #2 and #3 are out even though he did become the first player to ever lead both teams in every major stat in finals history. Then the Warriors added Kevin Durant creating what is probably the strongest finals roster to date and the rest is history.   Imo MJ had the GOAT career but LeBron is the GOAT player. Finals are not the end all be all to me as winning them is a team wide accomplishment."
"Warriors won a championship &amp; then 73 regular season wins BEFORE kevin durant joined. how does that compared to 55 games and 52 games won in the regular season to you?   toronto was a #1 seed before kawhi; they struggled to overcome in the playoffs; that's why kawhi got a lot of credit.  if warriors couldn't get over the hump and kd helped them win a ring, i wouldn't be saying the things i'm saying now.  what is it that ur not getting?   bulls w/o mj didn't win a ring; raptors w/o kawhi didn't win a ring. mj and kawhi helped them win rings.   wariors won a ring without KD. they won 73 games without KD. what did KD do that brought the warriors over the hump or do something they didn't do before? like cmon man."

It's a bad take.  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2733820-kevin-durant-twitter-account-posts-tweet-criticizing-billy-donovan-thunder   And this out of the blue.  https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fjz308/austin_rivers_on_russell_westbrook_man_russ_is_my/  And Kanter and PG saying he's great, and Schroder, and well...pretty much everyone.  Media talkers said the KD stuff, and KD kinda put it to rest.  If it's so consensus then people would actually agree, and I'd say try a self post and ask?  I mean if it's a consensus people would agree, I'd be interested but given reputation I've seen him be considered a great teammate, and seems other people itt feel similarly, maybe try that and it's a consensus.  If you've said it to this many people and just drowned in downvotes for it, and many told you the same thing, got frustrated and left, idk how that makes it a good one.  But it seems useless to try to explain so whatever, I don't have the patience and tbh it's not worth the effort if anything is just ignored.  Peace."
"Chris Paul Michael Jordan Kevin Durant Larry Bird David Robinson  Spacing everywhere, elite perimeter defence, good help defence, elite rim protector."
Kevin Durant - Steph Curry fans hate him cause he took his glory. LeBron fans hate him cause he blocked him from winning. Everyone else in the NBA hates him for destroying the competition.
"I wonder what sets the NBA superstars apart from the college stars that don't translate at the next level?  I think raw athletic potential plays a role along with (relative) length....can you play bigger than your size with big hands/wingspan etc.  The one obvious difference, to me at least, is that the top-shelf pro's can score on ANYONE. Defense varies from player to player, but they all have an offensive game that can't really be stopped. Great college players can be very productive but they aren't able to impose their will 'just because.'  Kevin Durant is a good example. When he was at Texas, even though the team was ""ok',"" dude could score anytime he wanted, any way he wanted. They might lose just by being outmatched, but he never looked outmatched by anyone on the court."
Kevin durant would have a higher release than  most players in a wheelchair he will be fine
"I would think the guys that are going to build a profile from going to college are still going to go to college. Zion, Emoni Bates, John Wall, Anthony Davis, Tyreke Evans, Brandon Jennings, OJ Mayo, Durant, Kevin Love... etc. These super high profile prep players are all guys that would see greater benefit in going to the league out of HS vs being the in NCAA. Their sponsors can gain them more fans and get them paid from it."

"The user above you is one of the biggest LeBron haters I’ve ever seen. But even that aside, we saw how bad Durant performed the year prior vs GSW while having an MVP caliber Westbrook next to him.

All the while having Kyrie as his second best player in 2017 and Kevin Love in 2018."
"Yeah he'd be exactly like today's top athletes with big egos and hot heads, such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, who are social media darlings and never cause problems for themselves with the media or on the internet."
&gt;Kevin Durant  That's a weird way to spell James Harden
"It seems to me that when discussing Draymond Green, you're completely neglecting both defense (I wonder why) and the fact that Love played terribly in the playoffs. He was garbage at literally the only thing he's good at.    Here are statistics of the top five players in terms of MPG on ""the highest paid team of all time"" in the playoffs. JR fucking Smith averaged the second most MPG:   \- LeBron James: 34.0 PPG/10.0 APG, 62.0% TS  \- Kevin Love: 14.9 PPG, on 51.1% TS  \- JR Smith: 8.7 PPG on 48.6% TS (36.7% from three) for the playoffs, 44.0% TS in the Finals  \- George Hill: 9.2 PPG on 56.7% TS (31.4% from three) for the playoffs, 44.6% TS in the Finals  \- Jeff Green: 7.7 PPG on 52.4% TS (30.0% from three)  So, please explain to me how this team was any good. Half of those dudes listed are fucking awful defenders as well. Kyle Korver shot 41.3% from three for the entire playoffs but 9% (literally 9%) in the Finals.   How was LeBron supposed to have a chance against Curry/Durant/Thompson/Green/Iguodala when he was literally the only Cavalier to average above 2.5 APG, above 19.0 PPG, and greater than 54% TS? Literally the only one. Oh wait, Ante ""5 total minutes"" Zizic shot 100%. I guess he was enough help."
"You have a Kevin Durant flair do you actually expect me to have a non-bias argument with you?   Kobe is top 3 greatest player in my books due to his skill set, mentality, work ethic, defense, motivation, winning attitude, and competitiveness!  Basketball isn't all about scoring, don't @ me about KD being the most efficient scorer when there is more to basketball!"
Wait a minute...Kevin Durant doesn’t play for the warriors!?!
Lmao what? The Warriors won 1.25 games without Kevin Durant and every game in that series came down to 6 or fewer points. The 2018-19 Rockets were far worse than the 2017-18 Rockets.
Andre iguodola pulled a kevin Durant after that series against the warriors in the playoffs

"&gt; And the only info you’ve provided is saying Ethan’s lying because the player he quoted said he’s lying. In past times there have been reporters that have lied/fabricated stories and players that have denied true stories. So don’t act like you are any better here.  If I have to trust the word of a player against a slimy reporter trying to get clicks I’m choosing the player every time.  &gt; And also I added, Strauss reported that back in 2015 before it was known how much of a hothead draymond was. Now it’s universally known around the league what a hothead draymond is. So that’s another thing that adds credibility to his story.   Dude what? Draymond was a known hot head even back then.   Just because Draymond is a hot head that doesn’t automatically mean that exact interaction took place.  &gt; I also find it interesting mo never responded after Ethan said he had recording of him saying the quotes. If Mo knew he was full of it, he could’ve just tweeted out, prove it or release them.  And like I’ve already said multiple times, it’s likely Speights just grew tired of giving a slimeball the time of day.  &gt; But again I obviously can’t convince you if you’re set on this assumption that Ethan was lying on this. So I ask you again, can you name any other time Ethan was lying completely on a story like you said he’s done 100 times?

Every skinny wing gets compared to Kevin Durant but this kid is the closest since KD himself.
Lmao like yeah of course they wanted KD on the team. I don't even understand this argument. Every player and team in the league wanted Kevin Durant but KD is the one who chose to go to the Warriors.

"In other news, Khris Middleton the ESPN broadcast has joined Larry Bird, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry as THE ONLY PLAYERS IN NBA HISTORY to average 20+ ppg while shooting 50/40/90.     and yet everyone says Giannis doesn't have any help lmao"
Imagine if we got someone like Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant is lethal at the end of games and can score just about anywhere on the floor. and his defense was also above average, this was before his achilles injury"
"It’s like when the refs used a technicality to review the charge on Kevin Durant in the finals. Sure they circumvented how the rule was intended, but the correct call was made."
You're the one needlessly hating everytime Lebron is brought up. You know damn well the disgusting shit people say about Lebron 'needing more help' when his teams trade for more pieces. He got criticized for asking for another playmaker and getting Deron Williams after the Warriors added KEVIN DURANT.
"Nope. They lost D'Lo and replaced him with injured Kyrie.  The thing I am concerned about them is a culture shift. They used to be the rag tag of underdogs but now they got Kyrie and Kevin Durant.   Similarly, the Clippers have the same problem."
"He's still playing at a LeBron level. But I think the peak of his prime ended around the time he returned to the Cavs. Offensively he has learned new skills to match whatever he has lost in raw explosiveness but his defensive versatility went a step down. With the Heat, he was effectively guarding MVP Rose in the playoffs and then Kevin Durant in the playoffs the year after"
"Yes, because Kevin Durant is incredibly talented and deserves the benefit of doubt that he will come back reasonably good post injury."
Even 60% of Kevin Durant elevates this team from questionable 8 seed to solid top 5 seed

Kevin Durant has. He is the luckiest player ever
Curry traveled in game 2 of the nba finals right before Iggy hit the three so we have a chance to win that game and if we do we would have swept the warriors and Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant don’t get injured
The Kevin Durant
"Kawhi proved he was worth it by winning. He’s won everywhere he’s been. That said, we shall see in the coming seasons how teammates feel about a max player only playing 70% of games while they shoulder the burden of the regular season getting paid a lot less. Human nature is human nature.   Kyrie has only ever won with Lebron.   I don’t think there is as much upside to Kyrie as you seem to think. At least AD proved he could carry a team to the playoffs. Kyrie’s pre-BronCavs were terrible. And he didn’t exactly prove his worth with the Celtics who play(ed) better without him.   There are some players you roll the dice with. Kevin Durant may be one. But since the price of torn Achilles Durant was signing Kyrie, I think that’s way too steep a price. Kobe was nothing, nothing like he was pre-Achilles injury. Sure he was older with more mileage, but he also wasn’t 7 feet tall."
How is this even a question? Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
And Kevin Durant too
"Kevin Durant is literally Mr Consistency for goodness sake, some of yall just be talking out of your asses"
Kawhi can carry a team to a championship when Kevin Durant is injured*
The only thing stopping him was playing in the same era as Lebron James and Kevin Durant
That says more about the Warriors then it does about Kevin Durant.
1st Quarter Pascal is Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant.  Why? Because he's Kevin Motherfucking Durant.  The most unstoppable scorer since Peak Shaq. No defensive scheme is gonna stop him.
"kevin durant didn't play in the finals and all reports after he left suggested that he was set on leaving the warriors for a while  klay even missed like 1.5 games in the series while playing at a FMVP level  and ""he"" did it? did you watch the series? it was an absolutely great team effort across the board."
Have you been a coma the past few YEARS?  kawhi averaged 30.5 PPG on 61.9% TS% in his postseason run  kevin durant in the past three postseasons: 29.6 PPG on 64.2% TS%  it's like yall forgot how good kd was lol. he was outperforming kawhi pre-injury in the 2019 postseason even

"Not sure, ask Kevin Durant and everyone who devalues his rings."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant was out at least 2 weeks with a torn Achilles
Doesnt change the fact that they blatantly erased 6 free throws or more from Harden specifically by swallowing their whistles in game 7 alone. Much less the blatant other shit like the Kevin Durant out of bounds pass to try and give GS the game the following season.
Ibknow it has nothing to do with the post but Kevin Durant shot 55% from Midrange last season. He's the standard from midrange.
Because Kevin Durant fell in their lap lol
"&gt;KD is neither on LeBron/Kawhi's level and he has been NBA's most hated player in 4 years  What a wild statement. Kevin Durant at his best was a better player than Kawhi Leonard. I mean, Kevin Durant is a 4 time scoring champ and is the youngest scoring champ of all time, and he has 1 MVP as well along with a lot of other awards. You can't just say that lol  I also see that you edited your comment earlier lol"

"LeBron, Ad, Kawhi, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Steph, Klay, Gobert, Jimmy Butler, dame, jokic, harden, Westbrook, Giannis, siakum, Luka plus some I forgot I'm sure  I'm getting so unimpressed with his fat ass that I'm starting to throw in KAT.  Woops, though Harris made it.  Honestly though, Trae young is a top 5 at his best if you go by how you do things."
"LeBron, Ad, Kawhi, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Steph, Klay, Gobert, Jimmy Butler, dame, jokic, harden, Westbrook, Giannis, siakum  I'm getting so unimpressed with his fat ass that I'm starting to throw in KAT"
"List of guys he’s had to defend in the playoffs  2014: Westbrook   2015: Chris Paul  2016: Kevin Durant   2017: James Harden   2019: Giannis   2020: When they play he will guard Anthony Davis a fair bit book it   Every size every shape, pretty pretty good. 7’3 wing span with that center of gravity allows you to do things others can’t"
"One of the mildly interesting subplots to this whole thing is seeing the Warriors learn their lesson from mocking Kevin Durant when he was the new 4th guy and applying it by kissing Andrew Wiggins's butt, lol."
"It's the best thing to do.  Even with Kyrie on the field, the Nets couldn't hope to go further than the first playoff round.  It is preferable that Kyrie be treated properly to reach the top early next season with the return of Kevin Durant."
Bandwagon Heat fans: ugh Butler isn’t a good shooter why didn’t we just sign Kevin Durant instead?!  Butler is such a fraud.
I'd hope a 70 win team could win a finals without Kevin Durant but clearly that wasn't the case. Have you decided what team you're rooting for? Lakers or Clippers?
"You guys bood Kevin Durant for getting injured and you wanna call Philly fans a disgrace? Your make a wish ring means nothing. It took Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant getting injured for you to win a championship (that will forever have an asterisk) and it’s the only championship Toronto will ever get cause literally nobody wants to live in that dumpster fire. And last time I checked, 3&gt;1. Lemme know when you guys get on our level and then we can talk."
"That lineup looks good. But I’m not sure if it’s better than Golden State last year, all in their primes.  2016 Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Draymond Green (splashpack version)  Kevin Durant  Demarcus Cousins"
"Yeah, the knicks were pretty serious about building around Kevin Durant too. It really doesn’t mean it was a logical strategy to put all of their eggs into one basket on.    Honestly adding Drummond was about their best case scenario and still an absolute joke."
"https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Dirk+Nowitzki&amp;player_id1_select=Dirk+Nowitzki&amp;y1=2007&amp;player_id1=nowitdi01&amp;idx=players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=players  Jesus fucking Christ put some respect on Dirk's name. This is KD last year (premise was 75% of what he was) versus ""prime Dirk"" in his MVP season (arguably not his best season). Dirk has KD in most advanced stats and is neck and neck in counting stats. r/NBA says some of the stupidest fucking shit I swear"
"As much as I dislike Kyrie, I realize that this is not a big deal. The whole organization is looking to next year with the addition of Kevin Durant."
It's not just that... The nets aren't a kevin durant away from a championship.  The last laugh requires a ring and that team isn't winning a ring next year.
Fuck yeah! Steve Kerr is gonna turn him into the next Kevin Durant.
You add Kevin Durant to the mix and your chances of good locker room chemistry drastic go down.
"No. There's not.  Kobe, Kevin Durant, Allen Iverson, Steph Curry, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, Charles Barkley, Magic, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie, Jerry West, Bob Pettit, James Worthy, Wade, Elgin Baylor, George Mikan, Dr. J, Isiah Thomas, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, Cliff Hagan."
"The real issue is he joined a team that won 67 games, an NBA championship, 73 games, had the 3rd longest win streak ever   A team that beat Kevin durant even though KD was playing with the following seasons MVP and then he wants people to pretend like he earned those championships.     They were the best team in the NBA with him or without him.   Hell they went 33-5 without KD as long as they had curry in those 3 years he was there. 4 of those losses were in the finals and two of those finals losses came when Klay missed a full game and the full 4th quarter of a game 6 where he already had  almost 30 points and was cooking."
"I didn't say it doesn't matter. I'm saying the doomsaying is fucking annoying and junkfuck there was saying we'd have been better off not signing Kyrie and Durant. That's a stupid take. Kevin Durant is one of the absolute best players in the NBA. I'm not expecting him to come back and be the exact same player he was, but with his play style and shooting ability, I'd be shocked if he doesn't come back and adjust his game so that he's still a very high quality player. Am I being overly optimistic? Maybe. But there's evidence to support that this isn't the end."
"You're an idiot. Yes it's a bad injury but it was not only on his non dominant leg, HE'S KEVIN FUCKING DURANT."
"&gt; and choked against the warriors 0/27  Imagine thinking that losing against Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green is choking.  &gt;  Harden has constantly shrunk in the playoffs  Harden's career average is like 28/6/5 in the playoffs."
"&gt; Repeat after me: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook (twice), Chris Paul  He left OKC at 22 years old and the franchise hasn't been back to a Finals since. Chris Paul is still past his prime, and basically missed the last two games of the WCF due to injury. Again, you are going to blame Harden for CP3 getting injured? Westbrook is also past his prime. lol"
"Repeat after me: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook (twice), Chris Paul"
"&gt; OKC has had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George, Victor Oladipo, and Domantas Sabonis   imagine having all these stars playing for your team and you still havent won 1 championship"
"Giannis played worse than Harden did relative to their regular seasons in their elimination series last year. Lillard couldn't even get a single W over the Warriors without KD playing at all. So you should already be saying it about them.  As for Lillard vs Harden, who has more wins in the WCF in the last 3 years? How many wins vs the Warriors does Lillard have WITHOUT Kevin Durant playing compared to how many wins Harden has against the Warriors WITH Kevin Durant?  Your bias is showing like crazy man. Rockets never take the Warriors to 7 or 6 with KD playing if Harden is as bad as you say. He has the ball in his hands way too much for that to be true"
"&gt; Please give me 1 stat that shows Wiggins is a good to great player  https://www.nba.com/timberwolves/news/andrew-wiggins-becomes-11th-youngest-player-score-8000-points  &gt;Andrew Wiggins needed just 10 points entering Monday night’s game against the Pistons to hit the 8,000 mark for his career.  &gt;At 24 years and 261 days old, Wiggins became the 11th youngest player to hit that mark.  &gt;You might be familiar with the 10 players to reach the mark at a younger age than Wiggins:  &gt;LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Shaquille O’Neal, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Dwight Howard, Bob McAdoo and John Drew.""  And he's 24. James Harden, one of the best offensive players of all time was one year from being a bench player at 24.   &gt; So you are paying max money to a below average player by basically every single metric in hope that he is a solid ""role player""  He's not a fucking role player the 3rd guy on the Spurs bench is a role player Wiggins is a 10% improvement away from being an all-star. Better efficiency (by not having to create/force shots in a shit system) and better off ball D and he's there.  &gt; As in Wiggins is going to post those numbers even though in 5+ seasons he has never been above league average in efficiency.  Sounds like you are one of the Wolves fans not hoping he reaches his potential in GS. That's sad, you shouldn't be a bitter person. You should root for other people to succeed, in general.  remindme! 1 year"
"I'm arguing that he averaged 35 against the Kevin Durant Warriors to a guy who said he can't repeat his regular season scoring in the playoffs, because that is him literally repeating his regular season scoring against the GOAT team"
"Sigh. Warriors fan huh ?   Steph Curry TS% went from 60 to 66 in 2017. In terms of on off statistics, both players received a 4-7 jump in their three years together when playing on the floor together.   Stephen Curry had his best playoff performances with Kevin Durant and vice versa. This is why he left."
"OKC has had Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Paul George, Victor Oladipo,  and Domantas Sabonis. walk through those doors. they’ve never had a player speak bad about the organization or the FO. They trade better and draft better then the Clippers ever have and they’re not 2nd (or 4-5th including other sports) Fiddle in their own city. they infinitely are better off then the Clippers"
Kevin Durant is a better playoff performer than Steph Curry. Please stop reading too much into it.
Is he Kevin Durant yet?
"Kevin Durant? What? Dwight is a walking muscle, it's part of what makes him so great at some things and so bad at others."
"Hey, man let me teach you something. Keyon Dooling retired many years ago, the post is about the fact that his name blew up after reports of his mental health etc came about.   In other news Kevin Durant tore his ACL and later signed with the Nets.    Do you know the difference betw Kevin Durant and Keyon Dooling???"
"&gt;neither are lockdown players since they don’t even crack the top 50.  Team defensive rating is a weak measure of individual performance, especially between teams...    There are a bunch of better ones.. for example, 538's took nearest defender and opponents shooting percentage compared to expected by Spectrum for the past  several years that data was available... they termed it 'DRAYMOND' since he was far and away the best and incorporated it to their CARMELO rating. It's still far from an excellent measure, but [the list of best/worst aligns much better w/ eye test and general perception than BPM or defensive rating.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/)   Kevin Durant is ~25th at +1.5 between Ibaka, Harrell and Lopez, Horford. Since the stat does seem to favor bigs as most defensive metrics do... I'd say that's pretty damn good.  Wiggins is -0.60 near bottom 1/4th between Carmelo and Taurean Prince.  Again not a perfect metric (e.g. IT moves up to near average from very poor on the old CARMELO rating), but definitely better than defensive rating or using counting stats like blocks/steals. ESPN's DRPM kinda sucks too, though they have Durant as just above average, Wiggins as bottom 1/4th too.   And while Durant hasn't ever been on all-defense teams (probably justifiably) he at least has votes some seasons. [TheRinger may've gone overboard with an article considering if he deserved DPOY](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2018/2/13/17005976/kevin-durant-defense-dpoy), but there's no way you could ever argue that for Wiggins.   While KD was definitely a poor defender coming into the league (really skinny, weaker, and carrying offense), by his 4th season onward he's at least been above average overall. Wiggins might improve, but he's 25 in a couple days... like the OP said, if he doesn't improve with Dubs (and next season w/ healthy team and time to integrate), there's really no excuses."
He's being compared to Kevin Durant.
"I would go with this line up.   LeBron James, F, Los Angeles Lakers Bam Adebayo, C, Miami Heat Stephen Curry, G, Golden State Warriors Anthony Davis, F, Los Angeles Lakers Andre Drummond, C, Cleveland Cavaliers Kevin Durant, F, Brooklyn Nets Paul George, F, Los Angeles Clippers Draymond Green, F, Golden State Warriors James Harden, G, Houston Rockets Kawhi Leonard, F, Los Angeles Clippers Klay Thompson, G, Golden State Warriors Russell Westbrook, G, Houston Rockets"
Which player would you most want on your team in a NBA finals series?   LeBron James: 45.7%  Kawhi Leonard: 22.9%  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 20%  Kevin Durant: 5.7%  Luka Doncic: 2.9%  Stephen Curry: 2.9%   #washed
"So what if setting the evaluation date means he is being held out? They are being cautious because he might get re-injured re Kevin Durant. If they don’t feel like playing him now, its up to them. If they want him to be 100% in condition when he starts playing, so be it."
Al Horford is the same age as Kevin Durant.
"Jalen's nickname for KD was Iceberg Slim because in his words, ""If George Gervin was the Iceman, then Kevin Durant is the r-r-remix baby"""

"I don’t know why you keep bringing up Dallas a healthy Kevin Durant is the best player in the nba and kyrie is a way better second option than porzingis I’d also argue that the nets supporting cast is better than Dallas as well. I think the heat and Celtics will be competitive but both kyrie and Durant are better than any player on Boston or Miami plus they have a great supporting cast and good coach (obviously worse than spo and brad, but not a bad coach that will affect the team negatively)"

"&gt; Westbrook was the reason KD was not able to get it done  Is that why Kd shot worse than Westbrook from 3 against the Warriors? Or went out in the 2nd round vs the Grizzlies without WB?  &gt;Give Kevin Durant Wade and Chris Bosh... I dont see how he doesn't get it done same as lebron if not better.  Because Durant is a worse basketball player than Lebron, choked in Game 6 vs Houston while having the better team, and because he was more injury prone getting injured for a year in his prime."
"No I hate watching Lebron play since way before the Lakers. He is way too ball dominant, I firmly believe its much easier to build around KD.   Westbrook was the reason KD was not able to get it done, but if you plugged KD into almost any other above average situation he would excel.  Give Kevin Durant Wade and Chris Bosh... I dont see how he doesn't get it done same as lebron if not better."
"But you are also ignoring the fact that adding a player like Kyrie is much more difficult than KD.  Kyrie has a very specific skillset that requires the ball in his hands on offense and hiding him on defense due to his weaknesses on that side of the court. Also, i don't think we had enough games with Kyrie at the starting lineup to gauge how hard with was to accomodate him. He had good games and they won, he had bad games and they lost, this happens with most teams that rely on a dominant ball handler/scorer who doesn't play defense.  KD has nothing of that, while a competent ball handler and passer, KD fits much more seamlessly in a squad due to the nature of his game which doesn't need the ball all the time and being a great defender.  If there's a player that you can drop in a team late in the season and it would be the easiest adjustment, that's Kevin Durant."
"The more and more we hear from Kevin Durant, the more it seems he'd kind of like one of us. He has burner accounts to talk shit. This happens daily, and happened before even Twitter was a thing. Back then it was just fake names in the newspaper comment section that would be printed. I remember when I used to use the alias Steven Chestwood when I used to write into the local paper trash talking the Knicks. I'd write things like ""Charlie Ward is a bum, and has no business being a Knick. Stick to football"" or ""John Starks goes to a beach souvenir shop and still can't find a bucket"". I only got caught when my Uncle overheard me talking on the phone to my friend about what to write next. He barged in my room, grabbed my phone, squeezed my testicles and told me to stop writing into the newspaper.

"&gt;crazy how good he was playing before he got hurt    How's that surprising?  &gt;  It's Kevin fuckin Durant. Too many of y'all fools act like ya just started watching the NBA in 2016 lol That's not it   The dude been the 2nd best player in the NBA for over a decade.. just after LeBron. He's not just crazy good. He's even beyond that. Just as a player though.. As a person, well. He has his issues. I don't understand any of that  &gt;  OKC and Spurs was the best teams in the West, by a huge margin. Durant always been on that potential Top 5-10 of All Time ladder. But injuries.. He always suffered from minor injuries, especially in his feet. He's a 7 footer, and plays like a guard. So yeh   The entire last decade, everyone everywhere always talked about how Durant is the only guy to end up being the greatest scorer in NBA history. A complete cheat code of a scorer. Like some NBA 2K15 my player glitch  &gt;   Nobody knows all that more than LeBron, first hand. One of them entered the NBA at age 18, and the other at age 19. Rest is history   These two always been the biggest genetical freaks, but different. That's what made it all more fun"
So he went from the 3rd best player in the league to the 15th at 29 years old without an injury?   No.  He was about 8th his MVP season. Then fell a few spots in 18. And a few more in 19.  Don’t let Steven Adams boxing out for a few rebounds and your hatred of Kevin Durant confuse you. Russ is a tremendous athlete but his lack of shooting and BBIQ have always had him a notch below the best players in the league.
****Kevin Durant is looking like a cupcake 🧁

Are you seriously comparing Lonzo Ball to fucking Kevin Durant?
Kevin durant v2
"It may have been a bad injury, but Durant is coming back several years younger than Pierce was and is a much better player. All reports are saying that his rehab is going swimmingly, and the injury was on his non dominant leg. Do I expect him to come back and be the same KD he was before? No. That would be unreasonable. But I do expect him to come back and still be an all star caliber player and that he'll adjust his game to fit his capabilities. Paul Pierce was good, but this is Kevin Fucking Durant we're talking about."
"It's interesting when both were asked which player is most difficult to guard 1-on1, [KD said Kobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAYO4EDDbhU), and Kobe said KD.  Kobe on who was the hardest player to guard in his career:  *""Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him.*  *When he first came into the league, he was easy to defend because he couldn’t go right and shoot. He used to kind of shoot across his face, so that was a weakness that he had. Also in the post, he couldn’t turn left shoulder, everything was right shoulder, so that gave me areas that I could shut off.*  *Then he started developing it. And now he can pull up left, he can pull up right, he can shoot the long ball, he has runners, left hand, right hand. Before he had a left hand finish at the rim, I could always send him left, force him all the way to the basket. Even with the advantage of his size, he was still uncomfortable finishing with his left. So I could clamp the right hand and force him in a tough situation.*  *But now he developed that. So then I couldn’t really figure out, is this a rhythm thing? I’m trying to count the seconds that he takes to make his move. When does he make them, at what times in the game? I couldn’t really figure out that rhythm.*  *So I retired not being able to figure him out.""*"
Why is Kyrie Irving pretending to be Kevin Durant?
Especially if you're as rich as Kevin fucking Durant
"Not only that, but they would rather let Kevin fucking Durant get wide open shots rather than let Curry have the ball"
So. . . Kevin Durant?
"&gt;Jump Shot"" tells the story of __Sailors__ and features interviews with Curry, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki...  Curry is *really* diversifying that portfolio."
Man really and truly believed it was no way Kevin Durant was beating bron in 2017 cause of the mental advantage bron has over the Warriors
James Harden wouldn't be as skilled at 7 feet tall. The onyl outlier is kevin durant.
"I wouldn’t count the warriors out of contention, especially if we manage to draft Wiseman or something.  But anybody who doesn’t acknowledge how far the team has to go to recover from losing Kevin Durant (and Iguodala, and Livingston, and McGee...) doesn’t appreciate how good that team was. Strength in numbers 😢"
"Kevin Durant is an anomaly. Odds are, he wouldn’t."
Kevin Durant just sneezed
That's called Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant says SHAQ HAD NO SKILL!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pafd0wnerFQ
One of my life goals is to have someone mistake me for Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant. Draymond is living the dream right now
so did kevin durant
love trying to earn wins and then calling up kevin durant in the parking lot
"Can this clown post how Kevin Durant helped Steph Curry? This is exactly why KD bailed on the warriors , idiots like this convince y’all that Steph put the ball in the baskets for his teammates."
You cant even say he needs to be the #2 to win a ring because he's never even won as the #2.  The only reason they got the finals was because of Kevin Durant.  People need to be real here.
Kevin Durant: Give back those rings!
After we traded harden we were still a great team and won 60+ games in 2013.  We played the houston rockets in the first round which should have been an easy win but [westbrook was injured by patrick beverley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFPHntPCvEY)  We lost in the second round despite having a great regular season and being a title contender.  In 2014 [Kevin Durant won MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxHPHdUOwE8) and we made the WCF  In 2015 KD and Westbrook suffered injuries so we missed the playoffs  In 2016 the Golden State warriors went 73-9 in the regular season which is the record for most wins in the regular season.  We played them in the Western Conference Finals and went up 3-1  We then proceeded to lose 3 games in a row and choke that series behind the awful play of our 2 stars.  After that Kevin Durant (who just choked to the Warriors) joined the 73 win warriors. (every okc fan hates KD)  Westbrook went super sayian in [2017 and won the MVP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvJ9ti64vo) while averaging a triple double (double digit assists rebounds and points) which only one player had done in NBA history. He also broke the single season Triple double record.
"I mean Jay Z also did decent, if you look at his list of clients...  Some notable names:  Robinson Cano,  Yoenis Cespedes,  CC Sabathia,  Saquon Barkley,  Leonard Fournette,  JuJu Smith-Schuster,  Ndamukong Suh,  Kevin Durant,  Kyrie Irving,  Danny Green,  Rudy Gay,  Markelle Fultz,  Kevin De Bruyne,  Romel Lukaku,  and so on..."
I'll give you a short history about our franchise so it might help you make your decision.  &amp;#x200B;  In 2008 the Seattle Supersonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Supersonics fans hate our team)  Our General Manager selected MVP in 3 consecutive drafts.  2007- Kevin Durant   2008- Russell Westbrook  2009- James Harden  Durant and Westbrook were great from the start and quickly made all star/all nba teams  Harden was an excellent sixth man and even won 6th man of the year  In 2012 we made the finals with Durant Westbrook and Harden all being young great players.  Harden wanted a max contract extension in the summer of 2012 (after the finals) but our owner didnt want to pay him the max so he made our gm trade him. (one of the worst trades in NBA History)
"Nets are kinda in basketball limbo right now. We have stretches where we absolutely suck, but other times we're super fun to watch. We acquired both Kyrie Irving and more importantly Kevin Durant this past off season, but KD was injured last season and won't play until the fall, and Kyrie just had to opt out of the season to get surgery. So this next year we should look really good and will really fun to watch. Right now it's a bit frustrating watching us struggle though."
Do you want Dennis Rodman on your team or Kevin Durant? I know which one I’d choose.
"I can't disagree with your choice. If you include size as well, Kevin Durant might be the only player who could have a team of 5 clones of himself and not have any weaknesses. (I think 5 Lebrons would of course be unstoppable but could at least be posted up by centers)."
1.  I'm looking for players to have played enough minutes and enough games to see how much value they have to their franchise.  2. KD means Kevin Durant.
"In a series against Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant Lebron hid on Draymond Green, forcing 38 year old Richard Jefferson to try and guard KD. Lebron had a few good years as a defender in Miami and the end of his first cavs stint, but outside of that he has been pretty average."
https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tiny.fcgi?id=3cQGL i would be extremely salty if my best teammate was 22 year old blake griffin instead of kevin durant
"Why is Horford that person for the Hawks?  Thunder fan, it’s Kevin Durant and Patrick Beverley"
Shaq had the scoring title in 2000 and Kobe was definitely top 10.    Edit:   Mixed up my Kobe and Shaq years but In 2011 Kevin Durant was #1 @ 29ppg / Westbrook #5 @ 23 ppg.
That friend's name... Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is not the best scorer of all time.
That Warriors team was the most intimidating team ever though. Having Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry on the same team should have never been allowed.
"How is Kevin Durant being out all season, Russ being out half the season, and Serge Ibaka being out half the season better than the blazers now."
"Yes, that’s literally how that works. You don’t get to pretend like injuries don’t exist.   “The Brooklyn nets are still contenders because they have Kevin Durant, even though he is literally no capable of playing”"
"You're the one who brought up Kyrie, lol.   It's really really presumptuous to say the system doesn't function when Kyrie has played a limited amount of games, and he is missing this one guy named Kevin Durant. Things can change quickly for better (look at Tatum the last month) or for worse.  Again, let's hold judgement until all the pieces around Kyrie are up and running.   On Harris, who knows. He would not get a lot of playing time on the Celtics for starters. Of course the Nets are a shit show without KD and Kyrie missing most of the season.    RemindMe! 1 year ""How are Kyrie and KD doing"""
"&gt; Not off the bench. Draymond never started games at center.   https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/03/daryl-morey-hamptons-five-could-be-the-best-nba-lineup-ever/  &gt; And Rockets general manager Daryl Morey knows just how good that lineup of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is — which doesn’t make the task any less daunting!  &gt; They’re putting just an unbelievable five on the floor against us **to start the game** – and I think maybe historically, one of the best five, if not the best five (ever) if you look at their overall net rating.

Its really dudes in here saying Giannis is a better scorer than Kevin fucking Durant wow this place is wild
"&gt; Draymond never started at center though. So yes this is new  https://rocketswire.usatoday.com/2019/05/03/daryl-morey-hamptons-five-could-be-the-best-nba-lineup-ever/  &gt; And Rockets general manager Daryl Morey knows just how good that lineup of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is — which doesn’t make the task any less daunting!    &gt; They’re putting just an unbelievable five on the floor against us **to start the game** – and I think maybe historically, one of the best five, if not the best five (ever) if you look at their overall net rating.  Even if you didn't know this from..you know..watching games..google is still very easy to use."
Basically it's the one step into becoming Kevin Durant offensively
"I think they should be ranked up there among the best, they did the best they could in a League that is very anti-dynasty to be honest. They had their window, it expanded because of the giant salary cap increase in which they upgraded from Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant and did very well.  What they are now and last year is just the reality of a team that has to pay money to keep their stars. I can see them in playoffs next year, but there is no way they will be ever as dominant as they were without the quality bench players and vets they had in those first four years."
"We are in a player empowerment era and the team ups have only increased. The league looks nothing like it did 3 years ago. It’s always happened but became a bigger deal with LeBron, and Kevin Durant going to the warriors only opened the flood gates.  Just another example of how LeBron influences the league. Everyone is very buddy buddy now, and the push in that direction inevitably means players pushing back and being vocal about their loyalty and wanting to retire in their cities. I think Kobe’s death will add more spark to that too.  I could 100% see Steph, Giannis, and Luka retiring where they are now, and i could also see devin booker finding his way to Minnesota to be with his friends.  TL;DR: started with Bron but KD has made it increase very rapidly."
"The latest you can go in this era is Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen teaming up  LeBron, D Wade and Chris Bosh teamed up in Miami  Kevin Durant joined Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodola  Those are the noteworthy ones. There are Wannabe Superteams like Russ, Paul George and Melo, but they didn’t pan do shit"
Forget LeBron.  The fact that people are gonna put Kawhi over Kevin Durant is disrespectful to KD as well.
"The year is 2023. Kevin Durant has declined his $43 million player option in order to beg the Boston Celtics to sign him for the vet minimum in hopes of riding unanimous league MVP Jayson Tatum's coattails to another ring. Danny Ainge released a single statement: ""Irish rules, no snakes allowed."""
Kevin Durant

"KD. His defense is often overrated, as is his inability to pass well. Also, people fail to appreciate that his efficiency was mostly very good, but not elite in OKC (it was elite for his volume, not in general) and only really became consistently great when he joined Golden State. Basically, I usually say it as the concept of Kevin Durant, a 7 foot tall shooting guard, is a lot better than the actual Kevin Durant. (KD is still great, like top-25 all time great, but people here vastly overestimate his impact sometimes. See: Amount of people assuming he’ll come back from his injury almost as effective as before because he can “Shoot over everyone.” That’s not how basketball works, he’ll probably be slower, which will allow players to guard him from closer and contest better, will make it harder for him to get great positioning, get open, or set himself up in his spots, in addition to damaging his defense. He’ll probably be very good, but the KD people remember is most likely gone.)"
"Hell, I'm still traumatized by the Kevin Durant, Backup Point Guard experiment from the 2015-16 season. Some say KD is still getting stripped as he dribbles at the top of the key."
You make it sound like they died after 2 seasons. Unfortunately what actually happened was they got a cheat code in Kevin Durant that broke the league for a bit. Doesn't make them not great.
What did Kevin Durant do today at the Nets’ practice?
Kevin Durant getting some shots up at Nets’ practice today.
&gt; Funny thing is they DID win a title without kevin durant.  I am sorry but that title is not the same. Kyrie Irving and Love not playing made the Cleveland a far weaker team than they had been that season.
"Since Allen Iverson (not including him), 23 ROYs have been handed out.   Elton Brand, Mike Miller, MCW, Steve Francis, Brandon Roy, Andrew Wiggins, Emeka Okafor, and Tyreke Evans all do not look like they're on HOF trajectories.  Tim Duncan, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, LeBron James, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant are basically locks.  Kyrie Irving and Damian Lillard are well on their way.  Derrick Rose, Amar'e Stoudamire, and Blake Griffin feel like fringe guys, but stranger things have happened.  Of the last four, I like KAT (stat stuffer, team likely to improve) and Luka, am middling on my views of Simmons, and doubt heavily Malcolm Brogdon.  I think realistically, 12 of these 23 make it.   From the inception of the NBA (not BAA or ABA) through Allen Iverson, 28 of the 47 ROYs made the HOF meaning that even for the highest achieving rookies, just 60% have made the HOF.   That's pretty close to a coin flip which, to me, justifies the ""dart throw"" description."
"Sometimes I wonder if people like this are trolling or if they actually think that players like Tim Duncan and Bill Russell aren’t as good as Kevin Durant lmao. KD will be lucky to ever pass either of those two, TD especially."
Funny thing is they DID win a title without kevin durant.
They easily could've won a Championship without Kevin fucking Durant if Klay didn't go down
No order  Lebron  Durant  CP3  Blake Griffin  Kevin Love  Steph  Harden  Westbrook  Melo  Paul George would be my guess

We’re all memers lol it’s a reference to an old Kevin Durant tweet
"I would say a superstar is somebody non nba fans  know and can recognize. how do non nba come to know them? advertisements and seeing their highlights on espn. who has endorsements and who does espn love to dick ride? lebron, AD, giannis, harden, kevin durant, kyrie (whether you like it or not, and i don’t) zion, kawhi, debatably dame, trae young, and luka. those are the players that take up big media time. that’s who the league and networks are marketing right now"
Luka - Kyrie/Magic  Trae - AI / Steph  Zion - Antoine Walker / Amare Stoudamire  Tatum - Kevin Durant
"I once asked my sister and my mom what current basketball players they knew and here’s their results.   My mom knew Lebron, Zion, Anthony Davis, “The other Isaiah Thomas” and Steph Curry  My sister knew Lebron, Steph, Zion, Lonzo, Jrue Holiday, Kevin Durant, Tacko, Anthony Davis, Meyers Leonard, Jeremy Lin and “The guy who got screwed, Aaron something” aka Aaron Gordon.   Those were the people they could name, when i started naming people they only knew Blake Griffin, CP3, Klay, D Rose, Carmelo, Dwight Howard and Vince Carter.   Obviously the pelicans players are there because i talk about them all the time (we live nowhere near new orleans tho).   I think if i did this to everyone i know the only 2 people that everyone would know would be Steph and Lebron."
"Cavs added veteran All Star Kevin Love thanks to trading one of their first round picks - they had like 3 1st overall picks out of the 4 drafts since LeBron left for Miami. Kyrie was also a 1st overall pick. When you get a 1st overall pick, that usually means you were one of the worst teams in the league.    Warriors were a bit different. Because Steph Curry kept getting injured and there were concerns about his future, he had to take a deal that paid him less than what he would eventually be worth when he blew up into a superstar 2xMVP. Because of that, they were able to pay the guys around him and open up piggy bank when Kevin Durant became a free agent. Just opening up the piggy bank for KD when they did required an aligning of the stars, but that's something else."
"The Warriors developed a good core which got them the best record in nba history. It should be noted that they were almost knocked out of the finals but then OKC, led by Kevin Durant, choked a 3-1 lead. KD took the hardest road and joined said team after an emotional phone call from a distraught Draymond Green after LeBron ruined their perfect season.   The Cavs acquired LeBron, but also got a new coach, LeBron, and a new GM, LeBron. Those three worked to pick up key pieces to assist LeBron and Kyrie Irving along the way so they could go toe to toe with the Warriors which they did for 4 years in a row"
Agree about most of your points but Khris is on another planet of efficiency right now. He’s in the Kevin Durant Steph Curry efficiency level of 64% True shooting
"Short answer: Lebron was the best player in the league and he played in a crap conference. For the first three years, he had Kyrie and Love as co-stars who are both good basketball players in their own right. In his final year at Cleveland, he basically just soloed the Pacers, Raptors and Celtics on his road to the Finals.  The Warriors had a great trio of Steph, Klay and Dray for their first two trips to the Finals. They then lost in the 2016 finals in embarassing fashion, decided to recruit Kevin Durant in the biggest bitch move in sports history, and they then coasted to a championship win for the next two rings."
"Warriors got the best backcourt in basketball in a curry and Klay, two of the best shooters in basketball history, and a glue guy in Draymond with an elite bench. Add Iggy and Barnes as wings, and it was a good team with Kerr leading the way. After the 2nd finals, they replaced basically all of that bench with an another superstar Kevin Durant, a 7 footer with elite speed and a jump shot.  Cavaliers got their superstar player back after he left the team in a controversial move about 4 years before. They also traded for a star player in Love at Minnesota for their top pick they got (they weren’t good before their run). For the first 3 finals, they had a duo of Bron, Love, and Kyrie (who was there during the run between LeBron leaving and coming back), but Kyrie dipped, so the team was dysfunctional the final year in the finals. Luckily, the Eat sucked, so they made it one more time against Golden State, where they got swept."
"Cavaliers - LeBron James  Warriors - Steph Curry (injured), Kevin Durant (left), Klay Thompson (injured), Draymond Green"
"A while ago someone made teams based on on the letter for the first name and team k was absolutely overpowered.  - Kyrie - Klay  - Kawhi Leonard - Kevin Durant - KAT  Bench: Kemba, Lowry, Kuzma, Korver, Kristaps, Kevin Love, list goes on!!"
"Which brings up one of my favorite NBA question...  If you could draft an all time team but everyone has to have the same first name, which name do you choose?  I feel like the obvious choice has to be Kevin. Which is so funny to me because it's often a ""nerdy"" name in film.  Durant Garnett Love McHale Johnson  Absurd team"
Kevin durant?
May I introduce you to the universally beloved Kevin Durant
"Why should the warriors care if the league is more interesting? If you have a chance to add Kevin Durant to one of the best teams ever, then you move heaven and earth to make it happen. I guarantee you Steph would take that 10 times out of 10"
"Kevin Durant. Obviously he gave us two rings, but he put Curry (my favorite player) in the backseat. The Warriors adding any other max player would still likely net them a ring over 3 years, but the league would have been far more interesting during that time."
"true, there definitely isn’t a Kevin Durant kinda hate. I mean it’s honestly almost impossible to hate him, he’s humble as fuck, fun to watch and really good lol"
"""Congrats to the warriors and Kevin durant"" - paraohrased quote said by your GM"
"&gt; ""I can't get mad when Kevin Durant, who I felt pretty close with, decides he's going to leave. Which, to me, made no sense. Like, you're at the best organization, I hope he thinks, in the world. Winning. Other great players. I mean, the new arena. To me, there was like every reason in the world to stay, but I'm not going to be mad at him because, you know, it's his life. And he earned the right. And for whatever reason, he decided he wanted to leave."""
[Goldberg] -Zaytoven- Says Kevin Durant Joining Warriors ‘Made No Sense’ to Him
"If taking off FOUR percent from 3P% only adds Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, and Dirk Nowitski, you’re having a spectacular season.   You were trying to tear down the argument and instead just helped it lmao"
Knicks were promoting  season tickets sales using Kevin Durant in a GSW Jersey.  They though they had KD and Kyrie locked up.  Clowns.
"&gt; **In The Athletic’s feature on you, it said that you’d watch Kevin Durant play and it would make you cry. Did Durant having so much success as the No. 2 pick in 2007 make things even more difficult for you?**  &gt; GO: It said that? (shakes head) No, I’m happy for KD. I hope and pray that he can come back from this injury and be just like he was before – or even better. I’m nothing but a fan of KD. I wouldn’t say that I cried. I had some feelings inside like, “Damn, I was picked first…” I wish I could be doing those things! I wish I could be the businessman that he is, the good dude that he is. But I’ve never felt anger or like, “That should be me!” I’m a fan of basketball and a fan of him. I wish him nothing but the best and I hope he comes back next year and takes Brooklyn to a championship.  lmao"

"Harden's last 5 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) have ended by him losing breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard, and losing to a warriors team without kd and giving up 33 second half points to Stephen Curry who was scoreless in the first half of an elimination game in Toyota Center. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.  2012: Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.  2013: Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.  2014: Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.  2015: Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.  2016: Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).  2017: Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.  2018: Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-  2019: Harden shoot 11-25 from the field, 58.3% from free throws ([3rd worst game of this season by FT%](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bn7vhu/hardens_712_from_the_ft_line_is_in_line_with_the/)) and caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
Kevin Durant would like a word...
"Kyle Lowry  Malcolm Brogdon  Kevin Durant  Pascal Siakam  Brook Lopez   Bench: George Hill, Terrence Ross, Kelly Olynyk"
"Ah yes. A team with Kevin Durant, a top 10 player skill wise all time, and kyrie Irving, a pretty clutch/high end point guard have no chance at making the finals."
Is this only for players who played every season in each decade because for the 90's it would be Michael Jordan at 30.8 PPG and for the 2010's it would be Kevin Durant at 28 PPG
Are you honestly asking if a team would prefer to keep a guy like Kevin Durant?  Seriously?  You'd have to be crazy to think you're better off without him - but you're also crazy if you think a healthy Warriors team out from under the hard cap isn't going to be a title contender.

"&gt;OKC didn't play Kanter because he was a liability on defense  Aka he's worse than Adams. Next  &gt;Regardless he was playing at an MVP level on both ends of the court last year and clearly wasn't 100% for the playoffs. Bottom line.  Doesn't matter if he wasn't 100% man. For one, our second best player was 0% lol. He was in a suit. Two, even if he wasn't, he still outplayed CJ. Doesn't matter if he was 75%. He was the number 2 guy and was better than Dame's number 2 guy.  &gt;And as far as Damian Lillard vs Westbrook, again I will say show me an MVP, show me a Finals appearance,c  Yeah sure man, just give me one Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Ibaka. I'll have a finals performance coming right up.  Russ has done *nothing* without KD. Nothing. He's been embarassed 2 straight years in the playoffs to teams he was heavily favored against. He hasn't won a single series without KD.  &gt;Aldridge/Lillard/CJ teams were solid.  1. There were no LMA, Lillard, CJ teams lol. CJ was a benchwarmer back then. He played a grand total of 1 minute and 5 seconds in that Houston series. He only played after everyone got injured before the Memphis series the next year (see below) and we were forced to play the reserves big minutes.  2. We only had one year of that team....and Dame was a sophomore nowhere near the player he is now. We technically had two years of it, but that second year wes tore his achilles, RoLo broke his hand, lillard and LMA tore ligaments in their shooting hands (look at what Dame shot from 3 that year - only year of his career below 36% from 3), and Batum tore multiple ligaments in his wrist. We limped into the playoffs and the team broke apart right after."
"OKC didn't play Kanter because he was a liability on defense...like I said he is good on offense trash on defense. But he is a big guy who can attack the basket and hit occasional 3s and for the Thunder who desperately needed a spark on offense I was always pissed at that. Adams  is much better all around, but gives you nothing outside of pick and pops and occasional hooks/layups and the majority being alley oops off pick and rolls.   Even Kevin Durant tweeted about why he left OKC because  ""he felt like it was just he and Westbrook and no one else"". Shots fired at everyone on OKC and when they were up 3-1 on Golden State, Adams was great, Roberson was playing amazing defense but still KD had a point.   In regards to PG, I don't think a player who required off-season surgery was exaggerating.  Regardless he was playing at an MVP level on both ends of the court last year and clearly wasn't 100% for the playoffs. Bottom line.   And as far as Damian Lillard vs Westbrook, again I will say show me an MVP, show me a Finals appearance, those Aldridge/Lillard/CJ teams were solid.   What did Dame Dolla do in the WCFinals last year aside from get swept? 19pts, 23pts, 19 pts, 28pts. Steph showed him who the better PG was.   I'm pretty sure it was the year Lillard got drafted Westbrook atleast went down fighting in the Finals and dropped a 43 piece on the Dynastic Miami Heat.  I think Lillard is one of the best shooters in the game, but he is more on the level of a Kyrie Irving. Which is still a great honor but I think guys like Russ and even MVP  D-Rose minus the injuries are better than Lillard."
''Kevin Durant.'' 'Who the F--k Wants to Look at Graphs While Having a Hoop Convo?'
"There is ABSOLUTELY Zero debate as to who the Goat is. It's MJ and that's it.   The only way LeBron will ever take that mantle is to win 7 rings, even MJ himself couldn't argue at that point.   Think of all the talented players who have lost in the Finals- LeBron, Kawhi, Kobe, Tim Duncan, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry.   MJ never lost...never even played in a game 7 in the finals.   That alone will probably be the hardest MJ stat to conquer.  2 3-peats, 6 for 6 MVPs, zero game 7s. The majority of the best players in the league right now will never be able to beat that."
He made everyone realize the triple double is overrated as a stat. Kevin Durant left because Russ is a ballhog and makes bone-headed plays at clutch times. He should have played shooting guard on a team with a good point guard. Then he might be considered great instead of just a statistical fluke.
"The way Kevin Durant put it...Westbrook thinks he is a great shooter which at times he is but, I think he put up a Finals record worst shooting line against the Heat and he and Durant had a struggle for dominance, who is gonna take the last shot etc. And obviously lost 3-1 lead on a dominant 73 win Warriors team and the rest is history.   The Brodie is my favorite player, he is much watch basketball and was really heating up before the league got cancelled.   But I think it's hard for him in today's NBA to truly dominate without a consistent 3pt shooting game...although he shot well during his MVP season only to regress  every year since then.   People also can't stand his attitude and how much passion he plays with (for some odd reason). Today's NBA just doesn't respect confidence and shit talking like the good ol days.   Dude is LeBron Jr. as far as I'm concerned they both are good not great shooters, but still can drop 40-50pts any given night. They dunk on people like crazy and are great passers.  Difference is LeBron is 5 inches and 40lbs bigger."
"Kevin Durant is one of the most efficient volume playoff scorers in the history of the NBA. Compared to him, Harden absolutely is a “lesser superstar.” Keep in mind I’m not saying he isn’t a superstar; I’m saying you could make a short list of players who are both superstars and yet still a tier below the best players in the game. Harden, Russ, Jokic, Embiid, Dame, Kyrie, PG13, CP3 (some people won’t agree but he’s crazy good right now), etc. I can give you 2018 because he played like a dog that year but I think you may be giving him a bit too much credit for 2019. I don’t have some irrational hatred for Harden, and I’m not even talking about his bouts with the Warriors, I’m saying that I see him losing because he can’t beat Kawhi, Giannis, Lebron, etc. I see him being a very good player who gets stopped by better ones who are more efficient playoff scorers and generally a higher breed of superstar (to simplify things)."
"He shot a low percentage to get the points, led or was close to leading the league in turnovers for the assist, and stole rebounds from his teammates for the rebounds.  What's actually insane is he will go down as one of the most overrated player in NBA history all because people were hating on Kevin Durant and gave him an undeserved MVP.  He is the worst scorer to average 30 points a game, worst rebounder to average 10 rebounds a game, and one of if not the worst passers to average 10 assist.  The theory of averaging a triple double was that no one would be able to do it EFFICIENTLY. They're are a dozen players in the league if you just gave them Westbrooks usage rate would average a triple double."
"Yeah, Lebron would have been inspired by the movie and had Paxson salary dump Luol Deng and taken the boys (Wade and Bosh) to Chicago to team up with Rose, Noah, Taj Gibson, and James Johnson, and then with the Bulls taking Jimmy Butler with the 30th pick in the draft after his first season, he probably would have won every championship from 2011-2016. Then when the cap spiked, Kevin Durant would have taken the even harder hardest road and joined the Bulls and they would have won the last three championships as well."
oh my fucking god are you braindead i meant kevin durant
It was Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant will be 32 before the next season starts, after having an injury that could've been a career ending injury. He isn't going to be an MVP. Giannis was already *this* close to him as it is."
It was the only game plan because we had a skeleton crew for a team that was built around Kevin Durant and not Russell Westbrook. The fact that the team was still able to be competitive is a testament to Russ’ ability as a player.
"clearly stat chased to show he could “do” more without Kevin Durant, should not have won an MVP, gave him an allstar cast, and never got out of the first round. This is where the eye test beats the stats, especially on horrendous attempts and percentages."
"2012 NBA Finals:  LeBron stats - 28.6 ppg (47% FG, 19% 3 pt. FG), 10 rpg, 7.5 apg  Kevin Durant - 30.6 ppg (55% FG, 39% 3 pt. FG), 6 rpg, 2 apg  KD's 2012 Finals Performance is also one of the most efficient in NBA history. His Warriors scoring wasn't an outlier, Durant is a monster in the Finals"
"   &gt;The  Thunder also aren’t as blatant about giving Westbook rebounds as  they’re made out to be. Yes, it’s conspicuous that Westbrook is pulling  in 8.5 uncontested rebounds per game, up from 5.9 a season ago. But we  can track how often teammates give up a rebound so that a nearby  teammate can pick up the ball: It’s a stat called deferred rebound  chances. This season, the number of the Thunder’s deferred chances has  decreased to 16.8 per game from a league-high 17.7 a season ago. What’s  changed? Well, the 6.6 uncontested rebounds per game Kevin Durant  collected in 2015-16 needed to be redistributed somewhere.   &gt;   &gt;Unlike  shooting or passing, rebounding suffers from severe diminishing  returns. There are only so many rebound opportunities, and only so many  bodies needed to corral them. Oklahoma City finished first in overall  rebound rate, and third in defensive rebound rate. The Thunder have  decided to use this surplus of rebounding to leak extra bodies out into  the break, knowing their point guard can collect the rebound and start  the break. In other words, the Thunder have made a conscious effort to  let Westbrook get the rebounds because they think it helps them win, not  just because they wanted Westbrook to hoard triple-doubles. The Thunder  are fifth in percent of points scored via transition, so it’s working  out for them  [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-case-for-russell-westbrook-mvp/)  &amp;#x200B;  Also did you watch Oscars 1961-62 season?  How exactly do we know if anyone let him get rebounds or not?"
"The kd and Russ thunder are also a very great team so I'm confused on what is your point. Kd is a top 10 player of all time. Ain't nothing wrong to going life and death with Kevin Durant especially considering your ""goat"" biggest finals win is either Karl Malone or Chuck. But lemme guess getting pass the Knicks (a team with literally not one good shooter) is super impressive right?"
"4 points*    I remember it because the warriors were stuck at 89 points for 4 minutes and then Draymond Green cried to Kevin Durant in the parking because his 73 win team needed more help to beat LeBron James and save Steph Currys ""legacy""  Your argument was you didnt think adding 2 all star players would change 2015.   The following year, the Cavs played with those 2 all star players and beat a better Warriors team.  The point was proven.  Forget changing out Kevin Love for James Jones.  If you really think playing a hospitalized Matthew Dellavadova (who was played off the floor in 2016) was better than having Kyrie freaking Irving, im not sure what to even say.  If thats really your stance, I think we're done here."
"Have you read about Harden’s struggles when Russ does well and vice versa? It’s very interesting. IMO it’s because they’re the same archetype of player. Mediocre efficiency, high-usage, stat-oriented leaders. And don’t get me wrong, they’re both great players, I just think it’s interesting that you say Russ is a great second option, because when Russ was succeeding, he became the FIRST option and Harden did horribly. Seems like neither of them can play the second option well.   Side note; I don’t see them going anywhere with this squad, which is really sad, because they have done so much to make this team functional/have star power, but you’re trying to build around a lesser superstar (Harden) whose play-style inherently can’t win a championship, and picking up another lesser superstar of the same variety does not equal a Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, or Steph Curry. Swinging for the fences and ending up with dirt is depressing to watch."
"&gt; I wanted this after his MVP season btw  lmfao every team wants to have good spacing.   &gt;he would have been above league average efficiency on high volume every year.  He has been above league average efficiency what, once or twice? The dude had Kevin Durant and that OKC teams were great yet still had trash efficiency. Spacing isn't what makes you one of the worst volume shooters, dumb ass shot selection does.   Spacing would not make him stop doing pull up 3's for &lt;30% or pull up short twos for 40%. Or even pull up short twos for 30% like last season. He did it with Durant, and the reason why he is doing well on the Rockets is yes the spacing, but also him not putting up garbage shots."
"What about when it’s Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka?  Also I don’t understand why him having teammates who’re terrible 3 point shooters somehow justifies Russel’s bad shot selection, especially him shooting from 3.  &amp;#x200B;  IIRC, he is literally the worst high volume 3 point shooter in history.  That’s on him"

Kevin Durant
"How Doesnt KD make his teammates better?   OKC were the No 1 or No2 offense in the league every year and they were a shoe in for the WCF every year.  He also led them to a finals berth at age 23 against Dirk/Kobe/Duncan and battled a prime LeBron on the highest stage.....After He left OKC, They haven’t been out of the first round, They haven’t even won a single road playoff game in 3 years even after OKC added a player like Paul goerge. KD absolutely makes his teammates better as evidenced by OKCs decline.   Also, Who did the warriors give the ball to when Games got tight? When they needed a bucket? When they Teams were piling on them &amp; They needed a player to stop the tide? They gave it to the alpha &amp; No1 option in the team....Kevin Durant. Steph isn’t an alpha over him lol.  I probably Agree with you on Bird being better than KD although I think it’s close, but Steph isn’t near these guys imo, Great Player for his size but there’s a reason there’s no player under 6’4 in the top 15 greatest players ever. He lacks size &amp; ability to Impose his will on the game.   Also, you realize that Dirk was compared to Larry bird coming in right? Dirk/KD/bird are all the same archetype.   Honestly, revolutionizing the game rhetoric is very open to interpretation. People credit steph like you, Some credit The natural progression of the game, &amp; some like me credit Morey."
Lol we got more hate than the Kevin Fucking Durant Warriors. I'll be surprised if it actually passes on to the LeBron James Lakers.
"Fuck off. If anyone should thank incompetent governments for this COVID pandemic, it should be (1) Kevin Durant, (2) Astros fans and (3) Warriors fans."
I think anyone could’ve found a way to pull it off if Kevin fucking Durant wanted to join their team
"* Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Shaq * Tim Duncan * Bill Russell * Kobe Bryant * Wilt Chamberlain * Stephen Curry * Hakeem Olajuwon * Kevin Garnett * Kevin Durant * Dirk * Jerry West * Chuck * Wade  off the top of my head, these players are/were all better than Isiah Thomas"
"Fair enough so my reasoning is that Kevin Durant is efficient from everywhere on the floor. He can hit 3s at a great rate, can pull up from the midrange and can finish from everywhere. I don’t think there are many wings ever as efficient in all 3 phases of scoring."
"Not quite as good. They were arguably more dominant but choking in 2016 will tarnish them forever. Then they added Kevin Durant, good for them but I will always hate the Warriors and Durant for that bullshit"
"he did call kevin in the parking lot, but he wasn't begging. he'd had his eye on signing durant since the 2015 season, which is why he didn't try and get the max on his contract, he knew (or rather, had been told by his agent) that if he took less it'd be possible for gsw to sign durant the following summer  please listen to the actual interview before saying things so confidently"
"Comparing Kevin Durant to Bosh/Westbrook/Harden is just absolutely blasmephous.   Why does KD need to get to the conference finals after an Achilles tear? He’s already got to 4 WCF in 6 years &amp; led his team to a finals appearance at age 21.   He was already one of the best scores in postseason league history before joining the warriors....  C’mon dude, KD is like top 10 ever. Don’t compare with bums"
"Mark Jackson, Kyrie, Kevin Durant. THREE UNSTABLE PERSONALITIES TOGETHER??? It is going to be a miracle if they win a championship."
Just messing with you. But I get what you’re saying. Accomplishments matter and Steph has done that as well as Kevin Durant. Don’t tell me KD did not help win the championship. Remove all the accomplishment just base everything on skill and stats. Can you still say Curry is better than Durant? Having Draymond green and Klay Thompson really helps Currys case.
so the original question is if kevin durant would be the second greatest of all time if bron wasn’t in the league and my reply was that he isn’t better than curry (all time) should’ve clarified i guess.
"there is a debate kevin durant, couldn’t get it done in the playoffs against the best even though he was close so instead of running it back he went to the proven winner to make it easier"
So if Boston wins two Rings Kevin Durant is elevated into the top 5?  I’m thinking no.
Look at my flair I can’t stand Kevin Durant but he’s better than Curry.
Stephen Curry will be ranked higher all time than Kevin Durant when it's all said and done.
"Stephen Curry was drafted in 2009 by the warriors and didnt win a championship until 5 years later in 14-15.  People forget that the core of the warriors (Curry, Klay, Draymond) won a championship and followed that with the best regular season ever before Kevin Durant joined.  They were also all drafted by the organization"
"I'm glad you love it but there reaches a point where someone's being so ridiculous there's really no point. Also, GSW weren't the greatest team of all time. They had a great regular season record but they had to comeback from being down 1-3 and then blew a 3-1 lead. Jordans Bulls would like to enter the chat. Everyone acts like Golden State was some unbeatable force that couldn't be stopped and then KD joined them. KD won 2 titles with them and was the finals mvp and is the most efficient player in finals history. I'm sorry but that's not meaningless. It's still an impressive accomplishment no matter how you want to twist it.   Kevin Durant is still a top 15 player with or without his Championships in Golden State. I can name a few other all time greats with no rings so don't act like there aren't exceptions. Karl Malone, Elgin Baylor, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley are all in the top 25 with no rings.  Stockton, Iverson, Cp3 no rings either."
Kevin Durant
"See this is why arguing with you people over this is useless. His decision to ""run away"" is probably alittle bit more complicated than that especially when you have a 78 year old legend in the name of Jerry West telling you one of his biggest regrets was going 1-8 in the nba finals. I'm sure that weighed on a 20-something year old Kevin Durant. But when discussing legacy and those things you never bring these things up. It's just he wanted to jump ship and abandoned his team and it's always black and white. You almost sound like Skip Bayless talking about the clutch gene.   Also funny to give a guy shit for going to Golden State and then go on to talk about how great player empowerment is. That's what everyone does these days.   And were talking about an all time great player who's still playing and can still win another one and can still have amazing stats. We're also talking about a guy with a massive fan base under the age of 18. One day these will be old people. They will determine his legacy and they are fans and they aren't bothered by this kind of thing."
"For sure, it get's debatable after Blake, but you also have to factor in guys like LeBron James, Larry Bird, Zach Randolph, Otis Thorpe, Kevin Durant, Elton Brand who are SF/PF or PF/C players.  I think most would take Elton Brand, Jermaine O'Neal and Zach Randolph (who are primarily PFs) over Draymond. They showed they can be the #1 option on a playoff team and in Jermaine's case, the #1 option on a contender."
"Kevin Durant is one of the most petty, feminine, and egotistical basketball players of all time"
"I'm gonna split mine into modern and pre modern because guys like Wilt and Russell really shouldn't be compared to guys like Curry and Harden. I'll say that modern players played the majority of their prime after the introduction of the 3pt line. ABA guys like Dr J can be considered modern, while I would consider Kareem pre modern, even though they played at essentially the same time.  Pre modern:  1. Bill Russell 2. Kareem  3. Wilt 4. Jerry West 5. Oscar Robertson 6. Elgin Baylor 7. George Mikan 8. Bob Cousy 9. John Havlicek 10. Pete Maravich  Honorable mentions: Dave Cowns, Jerry Lucas, Sam Jones, Nate Thurmond, Rick Barry   Modern:   1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Larry Bird 4. Magic Johnson 5. Tim Duncan 6. Kobe Bryant 7. Hakeem Olajuwon 8. Shaquille O'Neal 9. Moses Malone 10. Steph Curry  Honorable mentions: Julius Erving, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Dirk Nowitzki"
"Right, this seems to be the obvious takeaway from reading about KD. He seems like he feels betrayed with the reality of his hoop dreams, I think he expected it would be more basketball and less ""other shit"", but the ""other shit"" is what consumes him.  Here is a KD interview from 2015, before losing the 3-1 lead or making the move to the Warriors:  &gt; But what he wants to say right now is this: ""I go to sleep at night, like, ’Am I gonna be alone forever?’ "" A whole ocean of regret. His life too hectic, and too surrounded by money, to trust, let alone love, the next person who comes through that door. &gt;  &gt; ""Am I gonna be alone forever? Am I gonna have kids?"" &gt;  &gt; Almost seven feet tall in a sweat suit, body like God wanted him to be this good. &gt;  &gt; ""I feel like there’s no hope. But I still gotta have faith.""  https://www.gq.com/story/kevin-durant-nba-allstar"
The fuck???? Ahahaha the Rockets go to game 7 against the greatest team ever assembled and you blame the organization... the reason Harden has 0 rings is because of a man named Kevin Durant
"Have you ever listened to a KD long form interview? KEVIN DURANT says Kevin Durant isn't happy with life. Listen to KD on the CJ McCollum pod. He talks in detail about feeling unfulfilled and unhappy and always searching for something more in life. Those are HIS quotes. Not a reporter, not someone one reddit not even teammates. Kevin Durant."
"I think it'll be forgotten to some extent, mostly just by casual fans, but things are a lot different now with the internet being what it is. All these reddit threads, news articles, videos are going to be around forever. Anyone will be able to research into Kevin Durant and see all this shit.   We also have much more interaction with NBA players and insights into their lives than we used to.    This shit's never going away."
"Big NBA moments:  - Magic announcing he has HIV - Michael Jordan retiring in '93 (then coming back in '95) - LeBron's ""Decision"" - Ty Lue mixing his soups  Other info:   - The Celtics, Lakers, Spurs, Bulls, Heat, 76ers and Warriors are the winningest franchises  - The Knicks aren't historically awfully, just recently awful  - The Magic lose big men all the time (normally to the Lakers)  - Andrew Wiggins is overpaid  - You need one superstar to win a title unless you're the '04 Pistons  - People either think Kobe is top 3 or in the 8-15 range depending on if they're a child or not  - The clippers were shit before 2010  - The kings were, at one point, good  - No, Brian Scalabrine wasn't an all-star  - Yes, Chris Kaman actually *was* an all-star  - We don't like Kevin Durant here"
"He had the right to do so, he wanted to retire with championships under his belt which I personally wouldn't do, but then again I'm not Kevin Durant and I don't play n the NBA. He thought that him being the man on the stacked Warriors team = being the man on OKC or any other team, but he was wrong. Hence why he joined the Nets."
I’ll give my top 15:  1.  Jordan  2.  Magic  3.  LeBron   4.  Tim Duncan   5.  Shaq  6.  Wilt   7.  Larry Bird   8.  Kareem   9.  Bill Russell   10. Kobe Bryant   11. Hakeem   12. Moses Malone   13. Kevin Durant   14. Dr. J   15. Kevin Garnett
I raise you Kevin Durant Russell Westbrook Chris Paul
"&gt; running a system that won a team 73 games without Kevin Durant  That system had Steph Curry.   Plus, Dray didn't even run anything resembling the 2016 Warriors, but rather he ran past half court and lost the ball."
"I think at least a couple of KDs teammates would take offense to questioning his heart  &gt; ""Everybody gets so wrapped up in chasing championships and the greatness you see on the floor, but life is more important in terms of caring about an individual and what they're going through,"" Curry said. ""[Durant] gave us what he had, he went out there and sacrificed his body... I just feel so bad for him to be honest, nobody should have to go through something like that""  &gt; ""We did it for Kevin. You saw what we're capable of when he's out there on the floor, and that's a true Warrior to come out and battle with his team, put his health on the line,"" Klay Thompson said postgame. ""And we're gonna try and win the next two for him."""
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Wilt Chamberlain 6. Bill Russell 7. Larry Bird 8. Tim Duncan 9. Hakeem Olajuwon 10. Shaquille O'Neal   Honorable Mention:  - Kobe Bryant - Oscar Robertson - Moses Malone - Jerry West - Kevin Durant
"We would view him like Kevin Durant- a bitch. MJ complained to the media, coaches, and league, all the god damn time about how he was treated.   MJ also fucking choked against the Pistons, so what does he do? Activate the propaganda machine to make it seem like the Pistons were this insane team that mauled you everytime you touched the paint.  People compare MJ's title run to LeBron starting in 2011. They should be comparing his battles with the Pistons to LeBron's Mavericks series. If MJ experienced the amount of hate LeBron got after that series he never would have come back from it."
Lol the basketball reason is that he’s KeVin Durant and you’re Draymond Green. Give the best player on your team the ball so he can try and win the game. End of story. Let’s not go thru mental gymnastics because we’re not fond of KD. He’s one of the best scorers of all-time
"This clip is ridiculous, I mean Kerr is telling the story of how MJ trusted a guy like paxson, and Kevin Durant is playing with Steph curry and klay Thompson lol."
Magic Johnson  Stephen Curry  Michael Jordan  Kobe Bryant  Larry Bird  LeBron James  Kevin Durant  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Kareem Abdul Jabbar  Hakeem Olajuwon  Shaquille O'Neal
I bought the book that just came out about the Warriors dynasty and the author was pretty much saying what Draymond was saying and then some.   The insecurity of someone as good as Kevin Durant is really crazy to me.
"PGs: Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry  SGs: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  SF: LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant  PF: Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Charles Barkley  C: Hakeem Olajuwon, Bill Russell  Wild Cards: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal"
Not as good as running a system that won a team 73 games without Kevin Durant
"“And if you actually  watched the nba in 2016” don’t pull that stupid shit here bro. That’s what kids use when they want to sound like they know shit. Literally search up any source on the internet on the top 10 players of 2016 and none of them have green in the top 10. I even searched up and saw that one list had klay above draymond but hey, you know it all I guess.   Yeah and someone before told me that advanced stats showed curry was a better defender then Kevin Durant during a playoff series. Can’t remember which he was referring to. Wanna roll with that hot take too? Take your own advice and watch the games bro. Advanced stats only go so far.   You’re arguments are becoming lazy. Look at those players you’re referring to. All superstars that make an impact even when on an ass team. They’ve carried multiple times for the wins by themselves. Don’t see draymond doing any of that by himself. Beal might not have made playoffs but look what he averages on an ass team. I don’t even know what you’re trying to prove with McCollum. Lebron has the worst injury of his career and the lakers had multiple injuries last year to where they only played with a healthy starting line up less then 10x if I remember correctly. And they still almost made the playoffs.   Draymond was literally the only one on the team capable of making a play this year. Of course his assists won’t go down. Lmao wtfff are you trying to prove bro"
Starting 5: 1. Magic Johnson 2. Mj 3. Lbj 4. Kareem Abdul Jabar 5. Wilt Chamberlain   Bench 1. Oscar Robinson 2. Kobe 3. Kevin Durant 4. Tim Duncan 5. Shaq  Wild cards: Steph Curry and Kevin Garnett
"To be fair, being Kevin Durant is a pretty damn good basketball reason to demand the ball."
"That’s how damn good Harden is + 1-5 switching was.  On offence he made reliable vets like West mostly unplayable, also took away a lot of the Warriors vertical spacing with Javale and Jordan Bell(who has the athleticism to switch down but not the experience and Harden taught him lessons).  Warriors rotation was already kinda short, with guys like Livingston, Young being more 10-15 minute spark plugs than actual reliable rotation guys. Cutting three bigs out when their starting C was already not playing(ZaZa) due to matchup issues, Iggy going down  really affected the Warriors chemistry.   Once it got into that kind of situation Steph probably deferred to KD too much, and KD having that confidence just shot over CP3 EG etc. I think KD grew from this series which showed in the Clippers series with the “I’m Kevin Durant” quote, and hopefully KD plays a more pass-first game in Brooklyn too.  But I mean...the whole team was at fault. I think if Iggy didn’t go down they would’ve been fine because the Hampton 5 are just great together, but him going down and Looney coming in(who did a fantastic job), and the rest of the rotation being fking Swaggy P and Livingston kinda screwed with the chemistry.  Just such an interesting series, and I’m probably being a bit reductionist with my above thoughts. For the same reason the rockets series was amazing; I think a fully fit Raptors vs fully fit Rockets/Warriors would be just as entrancing.  Imagine a Lowry DG OG Kawhi Siakam small ball 5. Would the Warriors go into their shells and let KD be the number one guy?"
I guess I meant more of a player that didn’t care what people thought of them. I feel like Draymond is one of the few players that doesn’t give off a “fake” persona. He’s going to chew you out even if your Kevin Durant
"Listening to the All the Smoke podcast with Draymond, it's pretty clear that Kevin Durant was a complete dick and super selfish with the Warriors the last 2 seasons with them. Steph, Klay, and Kerr are on some buddha level of enlightenment to manage dealing with both Draymond and KD."
"""Kevin Durant did not have the greatest relationship with Steve Kerr,"" Smith said. ""He wasn't too fond of Steve Kerr at all. I don't know the particulars, but I do know that.""  ""KD was not feeling Steve Kerr. At all,"" Smith added."

You can really see Phil Jackson's influence on Steve Kerr. Phil letting Dennis go to Vegas in the middle of the season is similar to Kerr allowing for Kevin Durant to act out his antics.
The Lebron rules:  1. Create a wall of Spurs as he drives to the basket. 2. Put JJ Barea on him. 3. Turn off the air conditioning. 4. Sign Kevin Durant.
"lol, Kevin Durant would still average 30 PPG in the 80’s, especially with his ability to shoot 3’s that many lacked. You’re delusional if you think he’d be worse, he would be the same if not better due to the competition level"
"&gt; he argued that Kevin Durant would be a bench rider if he played back in the 80’s  Man is stupid with two O's.  He's seven feet tall, handles and moves like a guard and has a killer jumper.  He'd be a megastar."
"He didn’t include *every* detail; he included stuff that was relevant to how the season unfolded and accurately documented the team dynamic. That is naturally going to include details people already know about in order to form a coherent narrative, seeing as how it’s a full length book and not a blurb or a tweet. As I said, if it’s being written about respectfully and not from a sensationalist viewpoint, there’s nothing wrong with that.   I don’t mean this in a derogatory way, but you seem very hyper sensitive about this issue because you are *defaulting* to any mention of these issues at all as “shout somebody’s mental health issues from the rooftops as a form of ridicule.” Kevin Durant being insecure, or not fulfilled with winning a title the way he expected is not a taboo mental health issue. Particularly if it affected the locker room dynamic (it did) and was a significant reason why he left (it was). You can’t ignore those things any more than you can ignore Draymond’s fiery attitude or impetuous nature.   Being KD’s age and finding yourself unsatisfied in life despite a ton of career success isn’t unique. Ego and insecurity impacting the dynamic with your coworkers isn’t unique either. Both of these things are eminently relatable to readers and make the book far more compelling. Nobody is going to give a shit about a sugar-coated version of events that omits any and all details that the subjects might be afraid are unflattering.   I have dealt with anxiety and relationship issues affecting me at work before, and during my reviews I have owned up to it with my supervisors (obviously not going into great detail). It has always been helpful for me in my process of working through it, and them handling it respectfully/graciously also helped reinforce for me that they have my best interest at heart and care about me as a person rather than just a cog. I’ve also discussed feeing unfulfilled and finding balance, etc. I fail to see how somebody mentioning that, or anything discussed in regards to KD in this book, would inherently be ridiculing mental health issues...  I never claimed that this book/chapter would be any sort of win for mental health (as you asserted). My point was that if you automatically qualify any sort of external discussion of those factors as ridicule or a hit piece, you remove the possibility of discussing them honestly. From what I know, there aren’t any lurid details about KD’s personal life in the book, nor any examples of the author making light of a serious mental health issue. Why should there be a problem for the author to bring up the actual issues that helped lead to the dissolution of one of the greatest teams ever?  While I sympathize with and relate to KD for not being fulfilled, being defensive, and feeling like a fifth wheel on the Warriors at times...it’s not good or bad, black or white. It just IS. Does the NBA media have its drawbacks? 1000%. Would I personally want to deal with it? Not at all. But it’s hard to ignore that the larger media discussion and focus on rings at all costs (and KD’s resulting insecurity from that) played a huge part in him joining the Warriors in the first place.   In making a move that was essentially unprecedented for a player of his caliber (an MVP joining an already historically great team in free agency), he opened himself up to a ton of ridicule, fair or unfair. If readers look at KD’s insecurities/lack of fulfillment and label him “soft” for those feelings, that is on them. It isn’t an author’s job to prevent people from seizing on those details to form an ill-conceived opinion, it’s their job to provide an accurate and compelling story. KD himself has admitted that he joined the Warriors to finally win a ring and put himself in the same category as Lebron et al. He’s also admitted that winning the title didn’t provide the fulfillment he thought it would. He’s also acted defensively and defiant against criticism from the media and even random teenagers online. I just fail to see how talking about things *he himself has admitted to* and/or *done in a public forum/social media* is crossing a line or an issue of insensitivity to mental health. At all."
and the pick after Oden was Kevin Durant...
"Kevin Durant, he has no weakness on the court. He's the most complete player."
"Here’s my list  Starting PG - 93/94 Nate McMillan  Starting SG - 90/91 Michael Jordan  Starting SF - 06/07 Shane Battier  Starting PF -  03/04 Kevin Garnett  Starting C - 92/93 Hakeem Olajuwon  Coach - Phil Jackson   All of these players were chosen above all for their defensive capabilities.  Nate McMillan led the league in steals (3.0) and Defensive +/- (5.5), while also having a decent 3 point shot.  Jordan was also an elite perimeter defender, on top of his all-time efficient volume scoring.  Battier was one of the best 3 and D players of his era.  Garnett is one of the most versatile players ever.  Could defend any position, one of the best passing bigs, and his floor spacing was ahead of his time.  Olajuwon also had the speed and size to defend just about any position.  Olajuwon is right up there with Bill Russell as the best post defenders ever.  Combine that with his efficient and counterheavy post game.  All 3 stars demonstrated throughout their careers that they could set their ego aside to play with other star players  Team identity would revolve around physical defense.  Opposing teams would likely be intimidated to play against them.  Offense would be the triangle, with the main scorers being Jordan and Olajuwon.  Garnett’s passing skills would allow him to thrive in the triangle offense and allow him to be somewhat of a point forward.  The team would not shoot 3 pointers at the same rate and efficiency as modern teams, but floor spacing would still be adequate due to both bigs having a good midrange game.  I think the team would match up well against other super teams due to the stifling defense.  Jordan and Olajuwon both proved throughout their careers that they were skilled enough to score against any defense in the playoffs.  The team would match-up well against modern small-ball lineups because both Garnett and Olajuwon were quick enough to keep up with smaller players.  It would be interesting to see this team matchup against the 18 Warriors.  Durant never had to worry about a 7 foot Garnett guarding him, and Draymond has never had to guard a 7 footer as skilled as Olajuwon."

"I can't stand LeBron or KD. But I think we can all agree that KD going to the Warriors was one of the most ridiculous things to happen in any major sport.  The Warriors **were** 73-9 good because, well, they literally were 73-9...  The Warriors lost in Game 7 to a LeBron James team (considered by many to be the second-best player of all time) and the Warriors won the championship the year before.  I'd say Kevin Durant, easily a top 2-3 player in the league at the time, joining a team that won a championship followed by going 73-9 the next season only to lose in Game 7 of the Finals against LeBron, the second-best player in history, is very similar to someone of Shaq's caliber joining the 72-10 Bulls.   For goodness sake, the Warriors were one game away from winning back-to-back championships while setting the all-time regular season wins record. I don't know why I even have to defend this."
In 2020 I was neck and neck with Kevin Durant the entire season in PPG
"&gt; you know this is a 225 page book right. so you're forming this opinions based on what, a few pages? you ever take a literature course?  Buddy, stop being willfully dense. I’m forming my opinions on the chapters on KD based on the information that has been given to us thus far. You are literally doing the same thing. Do you have any legitimate arguments other than gaslighting?  &gt; You've missed the point entirely if you think abstaining from criticism is at all the point of taking mental health seriously. What was stressed most is being open about your personal struggles and seeking help from loved ones, professionals. I am not advocating for something that works against that. And again, you haven't even read the book to know what it's about and how KD is depicted cover to cover. So you have no idea about this  “You haven’t read the book so you can’t form an opinion on it. I haven’t read the book either but I’m allowed to form an opinion on it”. Wonderful logic.  Again, I’m giving my opinion on the information that has been provided up to this point in time.  &gt; Not Strauss' responsibility.   If the world were perfect mental health would be everybody’s responsibility. Unfortunately the world is filled with unempathic cunts like Strauss who believe selling books is more important than mental health, as well as people like you who defend them. Keep on contributing to the stigma surrounding mental health 👍🏼  &gt;He isn't writing anything inflammatory about Kevin Durant. Not calling him names. Not questioning his manhood. He's reporting on things that actually happened when the Warriors were at their peak and things that would be interest to those who care about the team from the perspective of a media member who followed them closely. Things that perhaps inform why Durant was distant from the team and why he chose to leave the team.  Yeah, you clearly just aren’t getting it, whether by choice or due to your lack of emotional maturity getting in the way. Like they say, you can’t reason somebody out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into.  &gt; Literally implied huh. Sounds like you have poor reading comprehension. Try again.  Yes...you can literally imply something. Fucking selfawarewolves lmao."
"&gt;Okay fine...I’m referring to the excerpts about the KD chapters.  you know this is a 225 page book right. so you're forming this opinions based on what, a few pages? you ever take a literature course?  &gt;DeMar and Love’s point is that mental health is something that should be taken with the utmost seriousness. The reason those stigmas exist in the first place is because of people like you who view insecurity as something that makes a person weak and should be ridiculed. You’re actively advocating for something that works directly against that. People who struggle with insecurity and confidence issues can very easily read what Strauss says about KD and think “I don’t want the anyone to see me in this light, I’ll just keep it bottled up instead”. Practice critical thinking skills instead of being willfully ignorant.  You've missed the point entirely if you think abstaining from criticism is at all the point of taking mental health seriously.

"I don't think so. He finished second in DPOY voting in both 2008-09 and 2012-13. He averaged 28.4 PPG in 2008-09, pretty far behind Dwyane Wade (30.2). He averaged 26.8 PPG in 2012-13, behind Kobe Bryant at 27.3, Kevin Durant at 28.1, and Carmelo Anthony at 28.4. If he went full try-hard in either direction, the other probably would've suffered."
"&gt; I don't think that's what the book is doing. Per his own interviews, It talks about the Warriors collectively with dedicated chapters to other people not KD. He is used a focal point to frame the Warriors dynasty run. I think you are overreacting to the excerpts and assuming that it only skews negatively towards KD. Like any book, it's important that you read the content before forming hard conclusions about what it entails. Should keep an open mind rather than what you're doing here.  I’m pretty clearly referring to the KD chapters specifically.  &gt; I think you're displaying naivete. This is not the responsibility of a journalist or reporter. They are not responsible for a players sensitivity to criticism. If Durant is insecure, that's on him. Not Ethan.  Lol, ok. The next time DeMar DeRozan or Kevin Love or literally anybody speaks up about the stigma surrounding mental health, just know that you stand against that.   &gt; God you sound naive right now. No actually, Durant and Ethan put their careers before all else. Their careers enable them to even be visible as people. Durant puts up with their constant backlash because he loves basketball and loves making millions to play basketball. I'm pretty damn sure he's happier playing basketball and arguing with the media than working at a plant for 50 hours a week. Compared to 99% of people out there, Durant's quality of life is great. He has to deal with issues like anyone else and manage them. Tough luck, I think he can handle it okay.  Lack of empathy and emotional maturity in full affect.  “I think KD is a bitch, and it’s absolutely *vital* that the world hear about how big of a bitch KD is. Also he makes millions of dollars so his feelings don’t count.”  &gt; Out of due dillegence, as when you write a book about someone in any way it is ethical to reach out and give them a chance to respond.  What?  &gt; Literally everything you've posted.  Back at ya."
"&gt; Like? Sounds like you're assuming things here. Perhaps it provokes Durant because he's ultra sensitive and lashes out at the media all the time? I mean he lashes out against 13 year olds on instagram, of course he's triggered by a reporter writing about a topic he evidently tried to avoid.  Dude, it’s called practicing empathy. If you look at a dude you know is insecure and think “hey let me write things I know will trigger him in order to tell a book” then yeah, you’re a cunt. Sorry. It’s just being unnecessarily shitty. Just let the guy live. You’re covering a fuckin dynasty’s championship run and you care about KD’s feelings. It’s just click baity bullshit made to sell his book.   He also just comes off as incredibly fan boy-ish. His excerpts remind me of the Eminem song Stan. For example, that one part where he talks about suggesting a place for lunch and KD shutting him down. Like...okay? KD didn’t want to have lunch at the place you suggested? So what? Really just comes off like he wanted to be best friends or whatever and when KD didn’t want that he got salty.  &gt; Strauss does cover 100 different things about the Warriors run and he was a prominent Warriors reporter before KD got there. I haven't read the book yet, but per his interview with Nate Duncan it's not singularly focused on Kevin Durant as much as he's used to frame the direction of the organization and Warriors dynasty. He said he had chapters dedicated to Warriors FO like Steve Kerr and Bob Meyers.  Good. That’s what the book should be about. Stick to that.   &gt; I don't think he's beating a dead horse when people are interested in the KD Warriors and he is trying to provide information that isn't publically available, so the reader does gain insight into the team by reading. I mean if you don't want to read it cool. Then don't. Doesn't mean the book is without merit or you get to decide what doesn't need to be said. Not like he's dishing on KD's personal life.  Calling KD insecure is absolutely beating a dead horse.  &gt; No idea how to respond to that. Maybe should avoid calling people cunts unless you're familair  Nah I don’t think I will. If someone’s a cunt I will most certainly continue to call them a cunt."
"&gt;He writes shit about KD that’s purposely meant to provoke.  Like? Sounds like you're assuming things here. Perhaps it provokes Durant because he's ultra sensitive and lashes out at the media all the time? I mean he lashes out against 13 year olds on instagram, of course he's triggered by a reporter writing about a topic he evidently tried to avoid.  &gt;He can cover 100 different things about the Warriors run and yet he’s fixated on KD being insecure or whatever.   Strauss does cover 100 different things about the Warriors run and he was a prominent Warriors reporter *before* KD got there. I haven't read the book yet, but per his interview with Nate Duncan it's not singularly focused on Kevin Durant as much as he's used to frame the direction of the organization and Warriors dynasty. He said he had chapters dedicated to Warriors FO like Steve Kerr and Bob Meyers.   I don't think he's beating a dead horse when people are interested in the KD Warriors and he is trying to provide information that isn't publically available, so the reader does gain insight into the team by reading. I mean if you don't want to read it cool. Then don't. Doesn't mean the book is without merit or you get to decide what doesn't need to be said. Not like he's dishing on KD's personal life.   &gt;Is he technically doing his job as a reporter? Sure. But he’s going about it in a cunty manner.  No idea how to respond to that. So he's doing his job but doing it in a cutty manner. What? Maybe should avoid calling people cunts unless you're familiar with them or their work, which it doesn't seems like you are."
[This is a Google question](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nets-gm-kevin-durant-could-return-if-nba-season-resumes)
"Idk. Abbreviations for nicknames are stupid and lazy anyway. KD or AD or MJ isn't really a nickname and shouldn't belong solely to one person. Also, I don't understand why Kevin Durant goes with KD when he already had a badass nickname: The Slim Reaper."
"“Jordan knew instinctively that the final inch of dominance was earned through a certain lightness, and he cultivated it as ruthlessly as his jump shot — the tongue-waggling, the pranks at the All-Star Game, the celebrations where he wept unself-consciously or seemed to float in the air. It was theater, but it completed the aura of invincibility; here was an athlete whose supremacy was so unshakable that he could afford to act unconcerned about it. Kobe could never be unconcerned, because unlike Jordan (or LeBron, or Shaq, or Kevin Durant, or Allen Iverson), he didn’t inhabit his talent so much as angrily oversee it.”  I think that maybe the difference between their two mentalities was that Mike was about “letting the game come to him”, while Kobe “went out and took it”, which is exactly how Mike described young Kobe’s approach."
"you mean Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant"
"He was 6'9, people thought he was 7 feet tall. But he was 7 feet tall in that he was the same height as the other ""7 footers"". Eg they are all measured in shoes and bumped up.   Not in shoes, remeasured and correct, Kevin Durant is actually 6'10"
"They made the move because you'd have to be a complete moron to turn down Kevin Durant coming to your team, not because they felt they needed him to beat the Cavs."
"Lebum? Westbrick? Kevin ""the snake"" Durant.  there's good ones out there"
"&gt;you'd be a horrible gm if you think that you're going to be refusing a center because your centers have usually been bad  This is true, but you'd also be a horrible GM if you aren't learning from the evidence you're given. The evidence Portland was given was that big men with signs of health issues, especially on their legs, can very easily turn into a long-term issue and kill the potential value you have from a high draft pick or a franchise player.  I'm not saying they shouldn't have signed Bill Walton because like you said they're weren't obvious signs beforehand, but they saw how current issues (poor prevention) can derail a career. Bowie absolutely had health issues.  So then they get to Oden, how was measured as having different size legs. Should the Blazers automatically pass on every single center with potential health issues? No. Should they be cautious about spending a first overall pick on one after they went through Walton and Bowie. Especially when it wasn't a weak draft with no other viable prospects, Kevin Durant was right there. Obviously no one knew what KD would turn into, but it's not like Oden was the only one with any potential so you might as well take a swing on it. If you're drafting at 4 or 5, sure take the risk. But at #1 when KD was there and they had the history and therefore the institutional knowledge at hand? Horrible GM move.  ETA: to bring it back to the Miami-Tua comparison, they drafted Tua at 5. If they were drafting at one they absolutely would have drafted Burrow, despite the fact that Tua arguably has the higher upside (I'm not sure if I personally think he does but it's a commonly held assessment). Taking a swing on Tua at 5 is different than taking a swing on him at 1 if Burrow is available."
"So this little man whos done nothing in the finals, no finals MVP. Gets outplayed by Raptors point guards who have been trash all playoffs and went berserk after getting matched up against a little chair. Can't even outscore Kawhi who had no legs. Gives up the most embarrassing lead in finals history. Gets dumpstered by Kyrie to lose a 3-1 lead. Begs Kevin Durant to help him win a chip. Only won chip against a team with no one. Worst clutch performer in the playoffs after Russell Westbrook. Is somehow the best player in the league? After we just saw him being completely ineffective without Klay on the court? When Lilard and Kyrie are showing how much better they are throughout this season? Dude's not even the best PG in the league and you're claiming no. 1 overall?  And your evidence for him being the best is? That he managed to get 30ppg in the finals being a one way player, matched up against a bench player Vanvleet?  A series in which he stat padded just to lose in 6? How many points did this dude give up? No mention of that?   That he has 3 rings? 2 of which he got carried by Kevin Durant who thoroughly destroyed Lebron 1 on 1? 1 ring in which he won because Kyrie went down game 1? And still couldn't win finals mvp? What weak reasoning for a sad Steph fangay, all your points are so weak and you need a level of mental gymnastics that just discredits your case.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpjtV4qjJBU Here, more Steph choking. Thats your no. 1 player. The only way this dude will win another chip is if he manages to beg another elite small forward to carry him or the coronavirus kills the top 5 SFs in the league."
"Agree to disagree. 15ft from the basket, no contest. Kevin Durant.  30/30 coaches in the league would take it"
That the Warriors didn't need Kevin Durant.
"&gt; He is talented, but no killer instinct. He gives up too easily. For example: during the 2018 Finals, when Kevin Durant went up for the 3 Lebron had Rodney Hood defend KD. Another example: instead of taking the winning shot in game 1, he passed it to George Hill (who was scared shitless on the free throw line). You think Michael Jordan passes it to George Hill? You think Michael Jordan gets scared of Kevin Durant and refuses to guard him?  Yeah let’s just forget that time Jordan passed to Kerr [for the game winning shot.](https://youtu.be/e7XCwLHIPLY) Nope. Just didn’t happen lmao.  &gt; Michael Jordan was a 10 time scoring champion. What did Lebron accomplish that is anywhere near as cool as that?  Lebron is likely going to retire with the most points scored in the history of the NBA, all while being twice the playmaker Jordan can dream of being.  Jordan is the better pure scorer, but LeBron being so good for so long that he will hold the all time scoring record is noteable.  I have no horse in the Jordan vs LeBron debate and I’d lean towards Jordan as well but man, Jordan stans are far more annoying than LeBron stans in the sense that they try to downplay how good LeBron actually is, and you’re exhibit A."
"&gt; The reason he had success is because he’s a really fucking good player.  He is talented, but no killer instinct. He gives up too easily. For example: during the 2018 Finals, when Kevin Durant went up for the 3 Lebron had Rodney Hood defend KD. Another example: instead of taking the winning shot in game 1, he passed it to George Hill (who was scared shitless on the free throw line). You think Michael Jordan passes it to George Hill? You think Michael Jordan gets scared of Kevin Durant and refuses to guard him?  Lebron is all hype. He had a ton of potential, but he was too babied.  &gt;Honestly I stopped taking your opinion seriously when you used “Westbrook averaged a triple double and LeBron didn’t” as a legitimate point. Just showed how little you actually know about basketball.  Michael Jordan was a 10 time scoring champion. What did Lebron accomplish that is anywhere near as cool as that?"
"No thanks. One series, again, that went to game 7, does not tell the story of his career with the franchise. Maybe if KD had a pg he could trust not to jack up shots when he isn't even a decent shooter, he wouldn't have forced things quite as often. Anyways, if your gonna have somebody forcing shots on your team, would you rather it be Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook?"
"To be fair as far as All-NBA goes, it's tough when you come up at the same time as LeBron James, and then you got Kevin Durant just a few years behind that. Early on you had guys like Duncan, Dirk and Garnett around. Forward was a competitive spot for Melo's entire career."
"Did you say reggie? Reggie was on his last legs, and his last good series was the eastern conference finals in 98. Jordan played a much better reggie Miller, consistently.  All those other names you mentioned are definite hall of famers, absolutely. But you lost me when you said close to magic caliber.  A 6'9"" point guard?!?! Ben Simmons PRAYS every night he could even somewhat resemble magic. And Kevin durant??? Umm, he was good, but he wasn't at this level yet.... he was still on the Sonics/thunder during Kobe's prime runs"
"Everyone is missing Kevin Durant as Darth Sidious! It's not perfect but it's good enough.  The Prequels:  KD appeared to be a good guy for a while in OKC (Palpatine was a good ambassador to the senate for Naboo) but then he joined the Warriors and absolutely destroyed the league (Palpatine became supreme chancellor and executed order 66).  The OT:  KD ruled the league with an iron fist (the Warriors are The Empire, they 2-peat) but eventually the Warriors lose to the underdogs (Toronto is the rebels). Darth Durant is thought to be vanquished (leaves warriors) and the empire falls apart (warriors in the lottery).   This makes r/nba the ewoks dancing at the end of episode 3 when the empire falls, so mentally insert that gif right here.  The Sequels:  Now Durant is mysteriously waiting in the shadows influencing Kyrie (Rey) and hoping to take over the league."
Nobody ever said Lebron isn’t close to MJ but when you start to argue who is the goat you have to nitpick about certain moments in their careers because all this players are so great. unfortunately for Lebron 2011 is always going to be a key argument against him in the conversation. I mean in his prime he go outplayed by Jason terry. He was like the 5th best player in that series that’s always going to be a bad hit on his legacy. Also you can argue Kevin Durant was better than him in their last two finals even though Lebron was great. He was also really bad in the 2007 finals but I don’t hold that against him because he was young and wasn’t expected to win. Either way though you can make other arguments for other playoff series he wasn’t the best player on the floor outside of just 2011.
"I'm Kevin Durant, y'all know who I am"
"This relationship, and its codification by the league, has been a gradual evolution from Jordan’s early playing days. “I think it developed over time,” LL Cool J said. “Obviously, you have to be successful enough to come to the attention of people.”  Older basketball fans may recall “Come Fly With Me,” a 1989 documentary released by N.B.A. Entertainment that followed Jordan’s career from his childhood to the league, and features some of the same archival footage found in “The Last Dance.” The film’s soundtrack, however, is almost exclusively music by smooth jazz artists such as Yanni, Najee and David Benoit. “N.B.A. Superstars,” a 1990 VHS release that set highlights of then-active stars to popular music, syncs a montage of Jordan soaring through the air to Berlin’s [“Take My Breath Away,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx51eegLTY8) primarily known as the ballad from “Top Gun.” (Try to imagine a licensed N.B.A. documentary setting LeBron James highlights to something like Adele’s “Someone Like You.”)  There are some throughlines linking past and present: The sole rap song on “N.B.A. Superstars” is Kool Moe Dee’s [“How Ya Like Me Now,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_nAZ3VEA0) which scores a piece about the Houston Rockets star Hakeem Olajuwon. “It was a perfect match of lyrics and music for Hakeem, who really was totally coming into his own in the N.B.A.,” said Gil Kerr, who helped oversee the production of “Come Fly With Me” and “N.B.A. Superstars.” “How Ya Like Me Now” is used to roughly the same effect in Episode 4 of “The Last Dance,” where it accompanies a celebratory sequence after Jordan’s first playoff triumph over the hated Detroit Pistons. The team is briefly seen watching a lighthearted video from 1988, where several players — including Jordan — danced and lip-synced to Kool Moe Dee’s hit.  The “How Ya Like Me Now” we hear in “The Last Dance” is actually not the 1987 original, but a rerecorded take that removes an impossible-to-clear James Brown sample. Speaking over the phone, Kool Moe Dee said the producers had incorporated “the wrong version.” Still, he thought they had done “a very good job in terms of using hip-hop music as a storytelling mechanism.” He noted the contrast between today and the late ’80s, when he stood relatively alone as a mainstream hip-hop artist. “I was absolutely the guy that when people didn’t like hip-hop, they’d always say, ‘I don’t like hip-hop but I like Kool Moe Dee*.’*”  Today, it’s difficult to imagine the N.B.A. without hip-hop. Roddy Ricch’s “The Box,” which topped the Billboard singles chart for several weeks this year, [references an iconic Vince Carter dunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8BSSCnSYds). Drake is the designated “global ambassador” of the Toronto Raptors, and a [frequent courtside presence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/sports/drake-toronto-raptors.html). (During the 2019 N.B.A. playoffs, [he was unofficially reprimanded](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/05/29/nba-speaks-raptors-drake-courtside-behavior/1280407001/) by the league for trash-talking Toronto’s opponents.) [Roc Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/style/jay-z-super-bowl-roc-nation.html), an entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z, represents multiple players, including the superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets.  “I think the popularity of basketball as a cultural sport — not just as an athletic sport — is a testament to that connection,” LL Cool J said.  The N.B.A.’s growing comfort with rap music mirrored rap’s own absorption into — and later domination of — mainstream culture, where by the turn of the millennium, it wasn’t just the players who were devoted listeners. “The executives behind it are growing up with hip-hop,” Kool Moe Dee said of the league. “They’re way more comfortable making those kinds of choices. It’s very hard to understate the racial tones that go on in every aspect of business in America.”  Balancing those demands remains an ongoing process. In 2005, the league instituted [a dress code](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/how-david-sterns-nba-dress-code-changed-mens-fashion-104719/) that some [saw as targeting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/22/AR2005102201386.html) the influence of hip-hop style on players. “The Last Dance” was jointly produced by multiple companies, and Hehir said “there were certain partners who thought there was too much hip-hop in this.”  Judging by the final product, he prevailed, and the predominance of rap in the series further revises not just the N.B.A.’s legacy with the music now inseparable from its culture, but Jordan’s personal relationship with the genre, as well.  In 1997, just before the events of “The Last Dance” took place, the hip-hop journalist [Bobbito Garcia interviewed Jordan](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=bobbito&amp;f=false) for a recurring feature in Vibe magazine where he played music for celebrities and asked their opinion. One of his selections was Eric B. and Rakim’s [“In the Ghetto,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEgKRuA_eSw) from the duo’s 1990 album “Let the Rhythm Hit ’Em.” Jordan’s response? “You got me on this one. I don’t listen to rap at all.”  Garcia, who called the interaction “my most memorable exchange” (it seems to go [viral on social media](https://twitter.com/redapples/status/1027210149407215616) every few years) said in an interview that he wasn’t surprised that Jordan didn’t listen to rap: He was born in 1963, which would’ve made him a young adult when hip-hop was just taking off. By comparison, today’s players have never known a world where rap music wasn’t fully integrated into pop culture. Still, “The fact that he had never heard of Rakim, I just thought that was surprising,” Garcia said. “I would’ve imagined that at some point he was at a party that was playing ‘Paid in Full,’ or one of his teammates was nodding along to the chorus at some point in the locker room.”  Then again, Garcia noted Jordan was a single-minded winner, “So it’s highly believable he didn’t pay any attention to anything but his stats and his win-loss column and winning a championship.” Hehir, for his part, said Jordan, who offered feedback on the documentary, “never commented on the music.”"
"Probably because in Games 6 and 7 it was-   Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green  vs  James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker   The fact that with this enormous talent gap (even with CP3), the Rockets took it to 7 and were in a position to win is a testament to the system they played in."
Kevin Durant with an injured Achilles is better than Larry Bird.
"Durant has all the tangibles, but larry legend had all the intangibles and was a legit cold blooded killer on the court  I’d take larry just cuz I don’t want no soft ass dudes. Plus larry led teams to greatness in college and pros, Kevin couldn’t lead a team with 2 other mvp caliber talents and had to join an already historically great team."
"* 2006 - Greg Oden or Kevin Durant * 2007 - Michael Beasley, Derrick Rose, OJ Mayo, or Eric Gordon * 2009 - John Wall * 2012 - Anthony Davis * 2013 - Andrew Wiggins * 2014 - Jahlil Okafor * 2015 - Ben Simmons * 2017 - Michael Porter Jr. * 2018 - RJ Barrett  These are the guys that realistically could have been picked first out of high school."
"I mean you don’t have to get 20, yo could get 19 and read up on the rookies if that’s cheaper. You might not even need to play 2K to get to know the players. If you wanna put in the time, pick 3 players from each team to research, Wikipedia them, watch their highlights, and after a few hours you’ll know more than a casual nba watcher.

"In dramatic movie voice, “Who really is Kevin Durant?”"
Kevin Durant fight me
"&gt;before the pandemic, he looked like Kevin Durant  Oh thank God. Can you imagine if he looked like Raymond Felton? Crisis averted."
Kevin Durant is a bitch ass snake who had to join his butt buddy Curry along with a donkey and Klay to beat the man that has constantly pissed in his mouth. See writing is easy
"Kevin Durant is very secure, very confident. Find a new slant"
"If you shrink him down 1 foot he’s not Kevin Durant anymore so it’s pointless to talk about.  You are not beating him 1 on 1 in boxing, mma, not even a street fight. Assuming you’re the average joe the difference in size and weight is too huge.   Whatever you got going after 3-4 minutes you’re out of gas, this is a man who’s been in the gym everyday for the past 10-11 years.   I don’t think you could even take out Trae Young, not even on a disrespectful tip.  Don’t let his bench press from when he was a teenager get you in trouble."
"Alright I'll bite. Yeah he's got me beat in endurance which is huge but offensively what the fuck is he bringing to the table in a brawl? Lmfao are you telling me you would be afraid of his swing?? Dude my arms were thicker than his by the 4th grade. Probably has big ass hands but realistically how hard is Kevin Durant punching somebody...Not fucking hard dude shrink him down just one foot, just eliminate his height, and he would look like the biggest pussy you've ever seen."
"&gt;Before the pandemic, he looked like Kevin Durant and that's a good thing  This out of context is funnier than it should be, as if he's some kind of zombie now lmao"
"But he hasn't gotten a haircut in a while I'm guessing, so does he still look like Kevin Durant now?"

You think 7 foot tall pro athlete Kevin Durant is afraid of a couple of beat reporters acting like man children?
"Kevin Durant is one of the most gifted scorers in NBA history. Maybe a ring ""of his own"" cause nephews cant accept his warriors  ring.  edit: People's obsession with rings caused him to go to the warriors, dont be mad he did what you made him do lol"
Kevin Durant is still better than kawhi. He’s been injured one year and people come out with shit like this.
"It was GS media lol and the warriors who called it a calf strain when it was likely an Achilles injury   Kawakami:  Warriors players were simply left wondering, where is Kevin Durant?   Warriors media/writers are mostly a bunch asshats"
“We’re never going to push Kevin Durant to come back”   Shots fired at gs

"Not really into my basketball, but this Kevin Durant seems like a really cool dude"
"How many players play in the East their entire career in the weakest position the NBA has seen in years? (bigs in the East from 05-15 were Bosh, Horford, Lopez, Rasheed, Old Shaq, Ben Wallace)  Bosh was great but theres a reason he has 11 all star games, but only 1 all NBA selection.   If he was in the West and going up against, Dirk/Duncan/KG/Pau/Amar'e/Carmelo/Love/LMA/ZBO/Yao/Durant/Brand/Hayward etc... he'd have like 5-6 ASG maybe less.   He is 3 all star selections below Dirk and Kevin Garnett but 10 All NBA selections below them. Bosh is great but his ASG numbers are for sure skewed playing in the East and going up against no other bigs."
Kevin Durant is a manchild
"Headline:   #What are we doin?!? **Kevin Durant goes on WILD RANT about media**   Devil tactics. This is just a comical and obvious example, but the media really will be the problem but the focus becomes the players reaction...to the shit they themselves (media) did.   Also a sign of a bad relationship but that’s neither there not there"
"That’d be like talking about MJ in ‘88 saying he will never win a ring simply because he hasnt. Or talking about Dirk in ‘09 saying he’s not capable of winning a ring because he hasn’t done it before. Makes no sense man, In order to win a championship you need a team made up of the right talent/hard work, and luck. The Raptors have a great mix of talent/hard work. Maybe KD didn’t fit quite as well as Kawhi, but it is preposterous to assume Kevin Durant would not be able to win with them. He literally always performs in the fucking playoffs, doesn’t matter if you hate him he’s a certified killer, respect the talent because he’s legit, 30 ppg at 22 yrs old in the finals legit. 2x FMVP over everyone else on the warriors team legit. Get over yoself"
Why do people keep repeating the 7 foot bullshit? Kevin Durant is not 7 feet tall.
"Idk man. While I dont really have an opinion on who’s better. I would definitely say KD would win a title with the raptors, like how can you just assume that they wouldn’t they’re a great team then you add Kevin fucking Durant to the mix, you know who he is. It’s not like he needed to go to gsw to win, he probably could’ve won in okc if he stayed."

YET THEY WERE STILL SPANKING THAT ASS. LeBron then bitches to Silver to get the upperhand and STILL it goes to the final minute of game 7 with a shot from kyrie. You're telling me that only ONE year later steph, klay, and dray became so fucking good that they took Lebron (the supposed second best most complete basketball player of all time apparently) with kyrie and klove (who bron didnt have the year before) to the last fucking minute of a game 7--only one game extra from the previous year? KD or no KD, the fucking path those three were on in their growth is ridiculous so go from 6 games against bron no kyrie no klove to 7 games against bron, kyrie, and klove. You honestly think KD is the difference between Lebron being sent to game 7 with the team he built himself and LeBron getting gentlemans swept and then swept the following years?   Lebron by himself against steph klay and draymond loses in 6 games. cavs with lebron kyrie and klove go on to win in 7 games the next year with outside help from the commissioner. How is he that good if the next year after losing he's pushed to game 7 with the same teammates that were said if they were there it would've been a cakewalk for Lebron. year after that, Lebron with the best team he's ever been on, sweeps every team, and then himself gets gentlemans swept with a gutted warriors roster that kept steph dray and klay and got KD. the growth trajectory those boys were on is something else man. KD is not the difference between lebron going to game 7 final minute and only winning one game. he had kyrie and klove man. NEXT year, loses Kyrie, and gets swept by again another gutted warriors roster. Steph has been better than Lebron since 2015 🤷🏽‍♂️ idc about all the things lebron can do when it's clearly proven whatever steph can do is better than lebron's efforts results wise.    if you look at 2016's stats, you'll see that the HERCULEAN efforts by lebron james and kyrie irving all the way up to the final minute of game 7 isn't what won them that series. Look at the stats and you'll see Harrison Barnes LOST gsw that series. literally the kid has to make one open three and the warriors win that series. If harrison was ray allen that'd be a two peat right there. Or you could just upgrade barnes to kevin durant and go on to win two more 🤷🏽‍♂️   so isn't that crazy? the warriors were so much more dominant and so much more a better team than the cavs in 2016 (before Kevin Durant) that it took all low lights from Harrison Barnes for 335 minutes to even give the cavs a shot, which Kyrie capitalized on.    and let's not forget the league fucked around trying to extend the series and that cost gsw the title and that's that.   what business doesn't want to generate more money, especially when you can do so artificially? let's not act like iust because it wasnt blown up in the media doesn't mean that conversation to extend the series to game 7 when the opportunity arose didn't happen because it obviously did   like the NBA cares about honor in sports or any of that sportsmanship and honor bullshit. it's a business hungry for more and more profit. more games = more profit. more games on the biggest stage = more profit. the league gifted Lebron that championship and it's not fair and he's not deserving. how tf do you then go to two more consecutive finals and win only 1 game between those next two finals? Only Lebron's ass gets kissed for doing so and it doesn't make any sense to me how this man doesn't produce what's been promised of his status as ""best in the world"""

"2011 playoff Dirk? They are instantly the title favourite. KP is the rim protector Dirk needs and Dirk's good defensive rebounding covers KP (even though he surprisingly improved on that in Dallas). Add the improved Dorian Finney-Smith and THJ to the mix and you have by far the best offensive rating in NBA history. They won't be good on defense, but it's not as if Dirk is less of a defender than Dwight Powell, so probably somewhere between 12th and 20th. The bench is really good, the coaching staff as well. The team is gargantuan, while spacing the floor. The only team that would be remotely dangerous to those Mavs would be the Clippers, because they can defend the perimeter like no other team. The LACs would still likely lose, because Dirk and KP would either force the Clippers to play bigger than they want or simply get killed by the Mavs big men rotation and rebounding.  But same goes for giving the (also 40 wins) Rockets Hakeem, Philly (39 wins) Dr. J. (assuming that today he had more of a 3point shot, which seems pretty likely) or maybe even OKC (40 wins) Kevin Durant."
"Team LeBron:  PG: Stephen Curry SG: Dwayne Wade/Klay Thompson SF: LeBron James PF: Kevin Durant C: Anthony Davis  This looks like a modern-era team that has the spacing LeBron needs to facilitate. I chose primarily players who can play off-ball. Wade for chemistry reasons, and Klay for spacing purposes, either way it should be good."

"The illegal defense rules dictated that a player had to be guarding a man , and they couldn't just hang around the basket. So the offense could force an isolation by simply having their low man walk away, making the rim protector vacate the paint.   This clip is a perfect example, if you turn up volume you can literally hear Adrian Dantley barking at Mahorn to ""get him out"" (ie walk Robert Parish away from the goal) :  https://streamable.com/8giyf0  Even though everyone in the arena can see that Dantley is going to dust McHale 1v1 and will be at the rim in approximately 2 seconds, there's nothing else Parish can do.. he has to follow Mahorn no matter what or Boston gets whistled for illegal defense and technical FTs for Detroit .  That's how easy it was to force isolation situations against weaker defenders.   This is a [1hr long video of Adrian Dantley literally just spamming isos over and over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2VNWvoSDqc).. he's in the Basketball Hall of Fame with 23k points scored and that was his entire game, as a 6'4 small forward.   Now imagine someone like Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Kobe getting to play 1v1 basketball with a guy like Kevin McHale guarding them on the wing and no rim protection behind him."
Kevin Durant
"You mentioned four players, three of which are not like Kevin Durant. Nobody in any era could defend KD, in past eras you could be more physical with him, but that's right about everything you can do against him, tbh i felt like Tony Allen in 2013 for Memphis did the best job i've seen someone do with Durant and he is 6-4. Durant is so big and skilled that everytime i felt someone was giving him trouble, it was small guys that were ridiculously strong and didn't let him put the ball on the floor.  Giannis and Siakam aren't the shooters that KD are, nor are as skilled as he is, so they are way easier to guard. Guys like David Robinson, Karl Malone, Hakeem and Shawn Kemp these dudes.  People act as if in the 80's and 90's there were only small white guys and that's just not true, sports evolve, but people are acting like the 1980s are the 1950s and it's just ridiculous."
"Best trade is the modern era? That is a massive exaggeration. In realtime the Lakers were trying to land Kevin Garnett.  https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/09/01/kevin-garnett-i-was-almost-a-lakers-in-2007/  They lost out on KG. Let's not forget Howard was a monster back then and Duncan was still prime. Gasol was good but not among the best 3 centers in the league. Pau Gasol was a fantastic addition but not a Blockbuster trade like KG &amp; Allen to Boston to play with Paul Peirce, James &amp; Bosh to Miami to play with Paul Peirce or Durant to GSW to play with Curry &amp; Thompson."
"Except the three point shot is the only shot that actually needs that kind of context due to how the game changed over the years. It wasn't a hole in his game simply due to the fact that by the lack of emphasis it had back in the day, it didn't matter that he shot 30%, because nobody was attempting three point shots anyway. Larry Bird shot over 40% multiple times yet only attempted 1-2 three's a game.  Again, Michael had zero holes in his game when he played, however if you got 1991 Jordan and put him in 2020, would he average 40? Yes, but the larger emphasis on the three point shot would make the fact that he shot 30% relevant.  Still, despite being a 30% three point shooter, he was one of the greatest midrange shooters of all time, all-time great finisher and post player, so he would obviously dominate.  Kevin Durant is a player that in today's game has no weakness, but his slim build would absolutely be a exploitable hole in the more physical 80's and 90's."
"&gt;To your first point, after the opposing defense realizes that KD could drain 3s from that sort of distance - how would they react and what would the ripple effects be on the defense?  He almost feels like he could be a one-man evolution. But I don't know if the rest of the league would be ready for things like 4-out-1-in just yet so I feel like they'd eventually learn they have to chase him off the line and siphon him into the paint - or at least into mid-range territory where he'd still be masterful.   I also feel like his stature could make him an easy target for certain brutes throughout the league in terms of his potential impact in the paint.  Separately, I think Kevin Durant back then would benefit from being coached by someone like Don Nelson, someone willing to try the weird and non-traditional because even certified snipers—Dale Ellis shot nearly 50 percent from deep in '89—were still only taking four 3-pointers a night or so (a *lot* of 22-foot attempts though). KD would need someone who'd let him be KD.   Speaking of which...  &gt;And in terms of the paint, was there anyone as physical, big, mobile and athletic as Giannis back then? Even if Laimbeer was in the paint, could Giannis still dominate?  David Robinson gets mentioned a lot in the same sentence as Giannis but Giannis has better overall ball-handler skills and comfort. I think Giannis would do very well, I just see him having to make more adjustments to his game and being more easily contained."
"&gt;Besides, if you watch an NBA game from the 80s it becomes immediately obvious that any player who can shoot the 3 worth a damn would’ve revolutionized the game back then.  Uh right, Larry Bird couldn't shoot 3s worth a damn I guess.  or that Kevin Durant even in today's game doesn't take that many 3s.  I'm all for the idea that guys like Lebron would be unstoppable in the 80's and 90's.  The iso rules favor strong quick guys who can get to the rim and pass out of doubles.  I just don't know why some people are lumping KD in there too.  KD is playing in the best era for him.  He's a zone buster - a tall wing who can shoot over sagging defenses. He's made for the current rules."
"What about the 2012 team? LeBron was in his peak, Durant had entered his prime, Kobe at the tail-end of his prime but pre injury, Kevin Love was probably in his prime stat-wise at least, Carmelo still in his prime, so was CP. Then you had guys like Westbrook and Harden on the verge of theirs."
"I think they'd both be great but if I had to pick one I'd go with Kevin Durant. I'm going to pick 1989 as my hypothetical year, as it was right on the cusp of both eras. My thoughts:  1. Most perimeter action still took place 22-feet at this point: A lot of defenses (even in the Finals) would sag off of guards along the 3-point line, almost daring them to shoot. A 6-foot-11 dude like Durant (or however tall he is) stepping up and raining from not only 23'9'' but up to 30 feet away could potentially be a game-breaker.   2. Traveling and carrying calls were a little more stringent: 1989 wasn't as stringent as, say, '77, but both Giannis and Durant would have to short up a few of their moves to avoid violations back then. Durant's crossover might be susceptible to a whistle while Giannis might see him impact... impacted by a reduction in gather steps.   3. Offensive fouls and charges were called tighter: The advantage decidedly runs in favor of the offense today, to the degree that players can often dive bomb themselves into defenders to draw fouls. This wasn't so in previous generations. In fact, even leaning a little too heavily out of your personal space was grounds for an offensive foul sometimes. [Here's what charges and offensive fouls looked like back then](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC_LrD6hYjI). This would be problematic for any player from today whose penetration game is based off of initiating contact and earning the benefit of the doubt. I think it'd harm Giannis most in this hypothetical matchup.   4. The paint may be less kind: I'd feel confident that Durant could survive anywhere on the court. If Bill Laimbeer was waiting for him in the paint, he could dominate from the perimeter. I'd be a little more concerned regarding Giannis on that front."
Thats cool. What do you respect and admire about Kevin Durant ?
"I have an idea for him if I was his PR.. Lebron James effectively closed the door to Durant pulling a similar move to his old team so that's out. It would seem like he was trying to copy the move and all and he'd get clowned. And I don't think going to the Wizards in Washington D.C. (his hometown) would have that much of an effect either.  So what he could do is lobby hard to revive the Seattle Supersonics as an expansion team. The only issue is the league is in no way shape or form ready to expand their product yet. But there's nothing saying he can't do this later and even be a minority owner. I think it would really flip the script. He's and Jeff Green are the last remaining Seattle Supersonics actively playing in the league so it's pretty well situated. Feel free to steal this, Kevin. :P"

"Bro thank you. All these Nets fans are bugging out at me for no reason lol. I didn't think I said anything controversial but apparently I'm creating a ""narrative.""   Plus, I'm not trying to talk down on KD as a man or about his talent, I'm just calling it how I see it. When I think of stans, I think of Kobe, Bron, Russ, DRose, Melo, Curry, or even Harden which still shocks me.  [This article titled ""Which NBA players have the craziest stans?""](https://hoopshype.com/2018/08/17/nba-fans-diehard-lebron-kobe-stans-curry-michael-jordan/) has a great quote from Michael Lee.  &gt;One interesting thing about Kobe’s stans and LeBron’s stans is that neither Kobe nor LeBron ever have to fire back at someone on social media because they each have an army of people willing to send those shots for them. Then, you look at someone like Kevin Durant, who will respond to some eighth-grader who says something crazy to him. KD will try to clown the kid on Twitter and we all start reacting to it.   &gt;Durant is in a unique spot because he’s a phenomenal player, an all-time great, a two-time champion, a two-time Finals MVP, an NBA MVP and he’ll probably go down as one of the best scorers to ever play this game… but he doesn’t really have an army. He doesn’t have stans. If he had those stans behind him, he wouldn’t always have to respond on Twitter and defend why he left Oklahoma City or defend why he joined the Warriors.   &gt;He wouldn’t have to defend anything because there would be this legion of fans out there who were firing back for him and defending him all day. Even before he joined the Warriors, he didn’t have an army of stans when he was in OKC. I’m sure not having that army frustrates him to some extent. If he had that kind of support, he wouldn’t need to create burner accounts because there would be real accounts having his back."
"Michael Jordan, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Lebron James, Steph Curry, Shaquille ONeal, Carmelo Anthony"
"&gt; Comparing one season of bird  except I'm not.  Bird attempted less than 1.5 3s per game in 81, 82, 83, and 84.  Bird shot 26% on 3s across those 4 seasons.  In seasons where Bird attempted 1.5 or more 3s, his career average is 40%.  It's not like he magically became a better shooter between those seasons.  He shot 40% as a rookie when he averaged 1.7 attempts per game, same as his career average.  Attempting more than a token number of 3s per game has an impact on how closely your 3pt% reflects your actual ability.  With Jordan, it's tough to gauge because he took so few in the regular season.  Excluding the years with the shortened line, I think he averaged around 1.2 3pt attempt per game for his career.  That's really low.  However, Jordan did take more 3s in the post season and I think those number are more reflective of his true ability.  With the regular line, Jordan's career postseason 3pt% is 34.5%.  That is better than modern players like James Harden 33.3%, Lebron James 33.2%.  And it's pretty close to Kevin Durant 35.2% and Dame Lillard 35.3%."
"While this question is interesting it kind’ve depends on a lot. But fuck it let’s give it a shot.  Let’s take it as building a full roster. Given that no salary cap is involved, I’ll take the dream team and replace a few players, that would look like this.  Guards: Magic Johnson Michael Jordan John Stockton Steph Curry (replacing Clyde drexler)  Forwards: Larry Bird (assuming this is prime and not Larry sprawled on the floor for his back in practice) Charles Barkley Karl Malone  Lebron James (replacing Chris mullin) Kevin Durant (replacing Christian laettner)  Centers: David Robinson Shaquille O’Neal (replacing Patrick Ewing) Hakeem Olajuwon (replacing Scottie pippen)  So, how does that team lose? Barring incredible injuries to like every player I don’t see how it happens assuming they are all actively trying to win every game but I think that’s the problem. If this team just replaced an nba team’s roster next season, one that doesn’t matter (the knicks), they would win every game they tried but let’s say they are like fucking 69-0 they are playing some shit team on a back to back and they just don’t care, maybe they lose.  I’m conclusion probably not and I’m very bored."
"There has literally not been a single emphatic Raptors fan (or human being) I have seen who wanted Kevin Durant to get injured. However when a generalization of few people is used completely out of context, to portray it as a bigger sample size than it actually is, to project hate on a hated team's fanbase due to adversity with number of fanbases it should be understandable why people rightfully call bullshit when it is brought up. Literally exactly what you are doing in this thread, disingenuously generalizing because you dislike something."
This is why I was enjoying this year so much. The lack of expectations. Last year the beginning of the season was fun! KD &amp; Steph looked like they were playing their best basketball together and we had some new role players that injected a bit more fun into the 82 game grind. The players would [joke](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/andre-iguodala-delivered-great-joke-kevin-durant-when-warriors-got-msg%3famp) about KD's impending FA. But as soon as Steph went down and the Draymond spat happened every game was a slog. The wins felt meaningless but the losses just meant more media bullshit. It was toxic as hell.
You guys overrate the fuck out of Kevin durant. Great player but not a conference swinger  It’s much closer to if James Harden/Curry were coming off an injury than if you introduced a prime LeBron.    KD has never proved he can be the the focal point and the man who eats up the bulk of the defensive attention and win a title. Now he is almost 32 coming off the worst injury in sports   Temper expectations

Lacob reportedly considered offering Curry less than his full max - which again would have left more money with ownership rather than help with team building. And now Lacob is bragging about how much money the team makes?"""
"&gt; Haters yelled ""There you go!"" Klay Thompson gave a look of utter disappointment. Steve Kerr belted, ""We all got fuckin' hurt now."" and before Steph Curry hit the locker room, ex-**Warrior star/rapper Easy Money aka Slim Reaper aka KD aka Durantula aka The Servant aka Kevin Durant backhanded him &amp; said, ""Y’all look so different *without me¹*.""?**  ^¹kd ^recently ^defeated ^Marshall ^Mathers ^in a ^rap ^battle ^and ^won ^the ^'eminem' ^moniker"
"Lots.  First, after missing time due to a calf injury, Kevin Durant returned during the Finals and tore his Achilles tendon. That ruled him out for this season. Durant would then sign with the Brooklyn Nets in the offseason.  The following game, Klay Thompson looked to extend the series but tore his ACL after a botched landing.  So the Warriors are now down two of their stars, with one even leaving altogether. That still leaves two time MVP Stephen Curry and former DPoY Draymond Green. However, Curry injures his hand four games into the season, and the resultant surgery sidelined him for months.  With the Warriors lacking in star power and an inexperienced bench they've thus been one of the worst teams in the NBA."
"LeBron has a teammate forget the time and score, had a coach who didn’t know to use a timeout, and had an opponent who set the record for most made 3’s in a final game, all in the same game, and was still quite clearly better than Kevin Durant. Oh, and with a significantly worse supporting cast."
"ngl when KD said ""I'm Kevin Durant"" I kinda started liking him again"
"I think he was in 2019. 2018 was lebron and 2017 was lebron. But 2019 KD looked like he was on another planet. It was either him or kawhi.  Durant was averaging 35 ppg on 650 true shooting before he got injured.  After he said ""I'm kevin durant"" He averaged 37 a game on 650 true shooting.  Yes he has Curry next to him but he was on another level"
Draymond   Kevin Durant   Matt Barnes   CJ McCollum
A poor man's Kevin Durant. A very poor man.
I see nobody answered the question so I’ll go ahead. Playoffs are currently scheduled for April 18 if you hypothetically post pone them two months that would put them at mid June which is exactly a year from when Kevin Durant went down. The average Achilles recovery to full contact is around one year. And considering three weeks ago a video surfaced of Kevin Durant having a shooting workout and moving just fine it’s safe to assume by June he’d be near 100% if not there already. I think Kyrie would be harder to predict as arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder could take up to 6 months of recovery.
I am really glad to see this. Kevin Durant is such a great player. Ive missed him this season.
They should talk about those supersonics! I wonder what ever happened to that kevin durant guy they drafted/s.
People talk about AD and Giannis- “wow excellent handles for a 7 footer!” I’m like... have you heard of Kevin Durant?
I don't see it. When he made that joke about Harden he also joked about taking Kevin Durant on his team.
"Charles Barkley 2x  Scottie Pippen 1x  Steve Nash...too many to remember   Tim Duncan  David Robinson  Also: Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Devon Booker, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Vince Carter, Blake Griffin, Shawn Kemp, Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Penny Hardaway, Tom Gugliotta, Amare Stoudamire, Shawn Marion, LMA, Brandon Roy, Grant Hill, Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones  Edit: These are all players I’ve seen play in person. Of course I’ve seen Jordan play 100s of times but only on TV (among many other greats). My first live NBA game(s) was 1995, I saw the Lakers and Bulls vs Phoenix. Jordan was retired but came back a month later."
"Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant disagrees"
"&gt; They don't just say ""who's got the highest PER?"" and then give it to that guy.  That's why the ""Best player on the best team"" is a bs criteria for MVP. Kevin Durant was not the MVP while on the Warriors, but he was according to that."
Except you failed to realize that Harden is the supporting player to Russ. The rockets have been the best when Harden compliments russ with his off and on ball gravity. Wayyyy more then Klay ever did for Steph. The reason Klay was so effective for Steph was because of the presence of Draymond Green and Kevin Durant.
Why are you ignoring Kevin fucking Durant? Steph won MVP with just Klay and Draymond both times.
"Kevin durant averaged 3.5 rebounds his rookie year. Look at all the top rebounders, are they the best players in the league? Rebounding is not the most important thing in the world especially when you have a beast like JV next to you"
https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2734119-kevin-durant-admits-to-regretting-signing-with-warriors-at-first-due-to-backlash
Davis is not Steph Curry or Kevin Durant.
"That reminds me of the year when the Warriors picked up Kevin Durant and won the title over Lebron and the Cavaliers, everyone: KD is the best player in the Nba!  ...wait, wha??  If Lebron was on the Warriors and Kd was on the Cavaliers, no way in hell KD is gonna hang and win a title w/ the cavs or make it look competitive, such a bogus claim"
"The Warriors had Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  The Lakers have Lebron James &amp; Anthony Davis. It's that simple. Your desperate attempts to make the Warriors look like a duo team is stupid."
How dare you disrespect Kevin Durant and his 8 am workouts
"Back in December, Brooklyn Nets coach Kenny Atkinson shared some pretty prescient thoughts for a guy who had recently landed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on his roster. “I know my time is ticking,” he said after becoming the longest-tenured major professional league coach in the New  York metro area. “It puts me on edge. Tough business, tough town, expectations have been raised. So I know my time will eventually come. Just do the best I can until that happens.”  That time came a lot sooner than many expected, with the Nets and Atkinson parting ways over the weekend. It came after a blowout win on Saturday and with 20 games left in Brooklyn’s season. It came with a repeat playoff appearance on the horizon, despite only 20 games from Irving before season-ending shoulder surgery and none from Durant. Jacque Vaughn was named the coach for the remainder of the season.  “Kenny will be back coaching soon,” one source with knowledge of the situation said. “He works too hard. Works his ass off. He will probably take the time away and replay the scenarios and relationships that went wrong — and come back stronger for the job he wants.”  The Athletic has learned what led to the departure of Atkinson, and that honest and frank discussions between Nets players and Atkinson intensified last week, which certainly played a part in it.  At halftime of the Nets’ 129-120 overtime win in Boston on March 3, Atkinson lit into his players and challenged them, sources say. It stopped short of escalating into a long back and forth, but this much was evident: Atkinson was not backing down. He was not holding back. He later pulled every starter off the floor for the fourth quarter and let Caris LeVert and a group of reserves rally from a 21-point deficit. Then on Wednesday night, after a 39-point home loss to Memphis, no one held back.  Atkinson walked into the postgame locker room, sat down in a chair and told his players and staff: It’s time to air out our grievances.  The Nets held a spirited team meeting, according to sources, starting with several veterans expressing that they wanted to see Spencer Dinwiddie play like the player they know, and later with people in the room calling out Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan. Then perhaps the most critical thing of all happened: Sources say Durant chimed in, pointing out that the Nets must improve their habits and that they were not building the proper culture traits necessary for a title contender.  A two-time world champion and two-time Finals MVP, Durant is expected to lead the Nets next season after having spent all of this one on the sideline while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. He and one-time world champion Irving lifted Brooklyn into super-team status last summer by choosing to join forces there, Irving as a free-agent and Durant through a sign-and trade from Golden State, which failed to get him to stay. Jordan was part of the Durant/Irving package deal, with the three agreeing via a FaceTime call around 4 a.m. on the opening day of free agency to take their services to Brooklyn.  Durant and Irving never connected with Atkinson and there was a growing belief that they did not have interest in playing for him when this team is whole again next season, sources told The Athletic.  It was not limited to just Durant and Irving, though. Several other players are also said to have begun disconnecting with Atkinson.  To be clear, a directive from Irving or Durant was not given to fire Atkinson. Marks and his front office are leaders of the franchise. The proper research must be done, and gathering a pulse of the franchise is always ongoing. The belief had been that the stakeholders involved in the franchise would evaluate everything at season’s end. However, enough information had been gathered prior to that, and even Atkinson, sources said, started to understand he had lost his most critical players. As a result, the Nets’ front office had to take all of the information it had at its disposal to make a difficult decision.  During Wednesday’s spirited postgame meeting, the players did not shy away from critiquing Atkinson, expressing to the coach that they wanted him to identify roles better, communicate the team’s hierarchy better, change what needs fixing and not settle for the status quo. It summed up the growing displeasure with Atkinson’s communication levels, as well.  “It was a come-to-Jesus moment,” one source with knowledge of the meeting said. “It was an honest conversation where everyone tried to make things right.”  During the blowout loss to Memphis, Jordan had verbally expressed his frustrations to Atkinson and the coaching staff about the team’s rotation, encapsulating the season-long tension that evolved from the head coach bringing Jordan off the bench, sources said. Jordan is said to have believed he would be the full-time starting center after he, Durant and Irving joined the team. When Atkinson made Jarrett Allen the starting center this season, it changed the dynamics. On Sunday, in the team’s first game after Atkinson’s departure, Jordan returned to the starting lineup in place of Allen.  Jordan has said throughout the season that it’s been an adjustment for him to come off of the bench, but has tried to make the best of it. Allen has said all the right things and said he’s enjoyed learning from him and wouldn’t want Jordan benched in his favor if it affected the team’s success. After splitting minutes throughout the season, Jordan overtook Allen in February in terms of minutes played by a handful.  In the fourth quarter of close games, it had been Jordan getting the lion’s share of minutes, which showed Atkinson’s trust in Jordan over Allen. Atkinson said around the All-Star break that he was still getting to know his newer players, including Jordan. When Jordan was asked about his relationship with Atkinson after a loss in Washington on Feb. 26, the usually personable Jordan didn’t have much to say.  “I mean Kenny’s played against me for years,” he said. “He knows me as a player.”  This aftermath of Wednesday’s meeting was going to go one of two ways. Either Atkinson would return to the team setting more motivated to fix the issues the players had — or Atkinson would lose confidence in himself as the head coach and lose grip of the team. Sources described Atkinson as dejected, and in the two days that followed he is said to have talked to people about not allowing anyone to dictate his job, about going out on his own terms if necessary, with two years guaranteed left on his contract.  This is the NBA and this is business. So when Marks sent a message to his entire roster on Saturday morning about the firing of Atkinson, there was surprise among the team. The eventual parting had been deemed inevitable in recent days, but to do so one month before the postseason?  Something had to have happened.  From the onset of Nets training camp, the concerns over the offensive structure and other strategies implemented by Atkinson were not addressed. Atkinson was defiant and strong-willed: He would handle the team his way. He maintained his offensive and defensive philosophies. However, his “equal opportunity” offense did not mesh with the team’s most critical players, according to sources, and there ultimately was not enough productive communication among him, Durant and Irving and a vast amount of players.  The integration of Durant and Irving would be complex. This was Irving’s team in 2019-20, with Durant joining his co-star next season once he had fully recovered from a torn Achilles tendon. It was expected to be a gap year for these Nets, one with purpose and hopes and an understanding of the grand scheme awaiting in the summer of 2020.  Atkinson talked often during the season about a lineup with Irving, LeVert and Dinwiddie on the floor together at the same time. Atkinson’s reasoning was that, at its best, the lineup would feature three players who wouldn’t be deferring to one another when playing together. Dinwiddie, meanwhile, said publicly that for it to work they would need to establish a pecking order among the scorers, with Irving taking the lead. But the Nets never really got an extended look at that lineup due to Irving and LeVert each missing extended time due to injuries.  The straw that broke the camel’s back came Friday at the practice facility, when GM Sean Marks and Atkinson discussed his waning voice with the team. One source said the final decision to part ways was not made until late Friday night and into Saturday.  Even in his final days as head coach, Atkinson told people that if he were going to be fired, he was going to depart on his terms. An offseason dismissal was almost inevitable, and so Atkinson made it known: If you’re going to fire me, just let me out now.  In many ways, the Nets got ahead of what was already probably coming.  Brooklyn is committed to Vaughn and seeing this current staff through. There’s a reason Atkinson is regarded as one of the best developmental coaches in the league; one who will assuredly receive opportunities again this summer. But the Nets have been high on the entire staff and its preparation, work ethic and concepts. The Nets have full confidence and support in the current coaching staff, sources said. Surely, external candidates will begin to emerge as the next few weeks go on.  These Nets still have two of the sport’s top players, a creative front office intact and championship-contending aspirations going into next season, but a part of their fabric left on Saturday.  “I would’ve loved to have Kenny here long-term,” Marks said during a news conference on Saturday. “It was time for another voice in that locker room.”  A new culture will emerge in Brooklyn. It will just no longer be Atkinson’s."

Millionaires are more likely to do what fulfills them because they don't need money. Does Pop want to coach Kevin Durant?
So then how can we know he won't go coach Kevin Durant?
The reptilian Kevin Durant
"Yeah no way can Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving make a team into contenders, haha so silly."
Good thing the Nets have been top 5 is isolation rate as a team the last few years. Its one of the reasons he came here. Please stop acting like you know more about our situation than Kevin Durant and his team.
"""Atkinson impacted my decision to come""  ""I didn't say Atkinson impacted my decision to come""  - Kevin ""Manfred"" Durant"
Damn. I can’t believe Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are creating a culture problem. Seems so unlike them.
Remember when people said Kevin Durant would never go to Brooklyn?
"I still think about this interview when i watch kd highlights or pat beverly being himself. KD literally said “y’all know who i am, i’m Kevin Durant” and showed everyone he is KD."
"Kyrie tells the Nets he can get Durant, but if he does he gets to call the shots. Nets say of course because it’s Kevin Durant. Has nothing to do w Atkinson really."
"2015: Cavs were just as injured as the Warriors in 2019  2017+18: a 73 win team upgraded Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant  The Warriors didn't earn a single ring. Its not even like they had great cap management to make it possible, the fuckin cap spiked that year."
I’m Kevin Durant... y’all know who I am
"If I'm Nets GM and want to choose between a good coach who has given everything for the team and Kevin Durant, I'm always gonna choose KD  It does harsh, but at the end of the day it's a business"
"Back in December, Brooklyn Nets coach Kenny Atkinson shared some pretty prescient thoughts for a guy who had recently landed Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on his roster. “I know my time is ticking,” he said after becoming the longest-tenured major professional league coach in the New  York metro area. “It puts me on edge. Tough business, tough town, expectations have been raised. So I know my time will eventually come. Just do the best I can until that happens.”  That time came a lot sooner than many expected, with the Nets and Atkinson parting ways over the weekend — after a blowout win on Friday and 20 games left in Brooklyn’s season and a repeat playoff appearance on the horizon despite only 20 games for Irving before season-ending shoulder surgery and none from Durant. Jacque Vaughn was named the coach for the remainder of the season.  “Kenny will be back coaching soon,” one source with knowledge of the situation said. “He works too hard. Works his ass off. He will probably take the time away and replay the scenarios and relationships that went wrong — and come back stronger for the job he wants.”  The Athletic has learned what led to the departure of Atkinson, and that honest and frank discussions between Nets players and Atkinson intensified last week, which certainly played a part in it.   At halftime of the Nets’ 129-120 overtime win in Boston on March 3, Atkinson lit into his players and challenged them, sources say. It stopped short of escalating into a long back and forth, but this much was evident: Atkinson was not backing down. He was not holding back. He later pulled every starter off the floor for the fourth quarter and let Caris LeVert and a group of reserves rally from a 21-point deficit. Then on Wednesday night, after a 39-point home loss to Memphis, no one held back.  Atkinson walked into the postgame locker room, sat down in a chair and told his players and staff: It’s time to air out our grievances.  The Nets held a spirited team meeting, according to sources, starting with several veterans expressing that they wanted to see Spencer Dinwiddie play like the player they know, and later with people in the room calling out Dinwiddie and DeAndre Jordan. Then perhaps the most critical thing of all happened: Durant chimed in, pointing out that the Nets must improve their habits and that they were not building the proper culture traits necessary for a title contender.  A two-time world champion and two-time Finals MVP, Durant is expected to lead the Nets next season after having spent all of this one on the sideline while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon. He and one-time world champion Irving lifted Brooklyn into super-team status last summer by choosing to join forces there, Irving as a free-agent and Durant through a sign-and trade from Golden State, which failed to get him to stay. Jordan was part of the Durant/Irving package deal, with the three agreeing via a FaceTime call around 4 a.m. on the opening day of free agency to take their services to Brooklyn.  Durant and Irving never connected with Atkinson and there was a growing belief that they did not have interest in playing for him when this team is whole again next season, sources told The Athletic.  It was not limited to just Durant and Irving, though. Several other players are also said to have begun disconnecting with Atkinson.  To be clear, a directive from Irving or Durant was not given to fire Atkinson. Marks and his front office are leaders of the franchise. The proper research must be done, and gathering a pulse of the franchise is always ongoing. The belief had been that the stakeholders involved in the franchise would evaluate everything at season’s end. However, enough information had been gathered prior to that, and even Atkinson, sources said, started to understand he had lost his most critical players. As a result, the Nets’ front office had to take all of the information it had at its disposal to make a difficult decision.  During Wednesday’s spirited postgame meeting, the players did not shy away from critiquing Atkinson, expressing to the coach that they wanted him to identify roles better, communicate the team’s hierarchy better, change what needs fixing and not settle for the status quo. It summed up the growing displeasure with Atkinson’s communication levels, as well.  “It was a come-to-Jesus moment,” one source with knowledge of the meeting said. “It was an honest conversation where everyone tried to make things right.”   During the blowout loss to Memphis, Jordan had verbally expressed his frustrations to Atkinson and the coaching staff about the team’s rotation, encapsulating the season-long tension that evolved from the head coach bringing Jordan off the bench, sources said. Jordan is said to have believed he would be the full-time starting center after he, Durant and Irving joined the team. When Atkinson made Jarrett Allen the starting center this season, it changed the dynamics. On Sunday, in the team’s first game after Atkinson’s departure, Jordan returned to the starting lineup in place of Allen.  Jordan has said throughout the season that it’s been an adjustment for him to come off of the bench, but has tried to make the best of it. Allen has said all the right things and said he’s enjoyed learning from him and wouldn’t want Jordan benched in his favor if it affected the team’s success. After splitting minutes throughout the season, Jordan overtook Allen in February in terms of minutes played by a handful.  In the fourth quarter of close games, it had been Jordan getting the lion’s share of minutes, which showed Atkinson’s trust in Jordan over Allen. Atkinson said around the All-Star break that he was still getting to know his newer players, including Jordan. When Jordan was asked about his relationship with Atkinson after a loss in Washington on Feb. 26, the usually personable Jordan didn’t have much to say.  “I mean Kenny’s played against me for years,” he said. “He knows me as a player.”  This aftermath of Wednesday’s meeting was going to go one of two ways. Either Atkinson would return to the team setting more motivated to fix the issues the players had — or Atkinson would lose confidence in himself as the head coach and lose grip of the team. Sources described Atkinson as dejected, and in the two days that follow he is said to have talked to people about not allowing anyone to dictate his job, about going out on his own terms if necessary, with two years guaranteed left on his contract.  This is the NBA and this is business. So when Marks sent a message to his entire roster on Saturday morning about the firing of Atkinson, there was surprise among the team. The eventual parting had been deemed inevitable in recent days, but to do so one month before the postseason?  Something had to have happened.  From the onset of Nets training camp, the concerns over the offensive structure and other strategies implemented by Atkinson were not addressed. Atkinson was defiant and strong-willed: He would handle the team his way. He maintained his offensive and defensive philosophies. However, his “equal opportunity” offense did not mesh with the team’s most critical players, according to sources, and there ultimately was not enough productive communication among him, Durant and Irving and a vast amount of players.  The integration of Durant and Irving would be complex. This was Irving’s team in 2019-20, with Durant joining his co-star next season once he had fully recovered from a torn Achilles tendon. It was expected to be a gap year for these Nets, one with purpose and hopes and an understanding of the grand scheme awaiting in the summer of 2020.  Atkinson talked often during the season about a lineup with Irving, LeVert and Dinwiddie on the floor together at the same time. Atkinson’s reasoning was that, at its best, the lineup would feature three players who wouldn’t be deferring to one another when playing together. Dinwiddie, meanwhile, said publicly that for it to work they would need to establish a pecking order among the scorers, with Irving taking the lead. But the Nets never really got an extended look at that lineup due to Irving and LeVert each missing extended time due to injuries.  The straw that broke the camel’s back came Friday at the practice facility, when GM Sean Marks and Atkinson discussed his waning voice with the team. One source said the final decision to part ways was not made until late Friday night and into Saturday.  Even in his final days as head coach, Atkinson told people that if he were going to be fired, he was going to depart on his terms. An offseason dismissal was almost inevitable, and so Atkinson made it known: If you’re going to fire me, just let me out now.  In many ways, the Nets got ahead of what was already probably coming.  Brooklyn is committed to Vaughn and seeing this current staff through. There’s a reason Atkinson is regarded as one of the best developmental coaches in the league; one who will assuredly receive opportunities again this summer. But the Nets have been high on the entire staff and its preparation, work ethic and concepts. The Nets have full confidence and support in the current coaching staff, sources said. Surely, external candidates will begin to emerge as the next few weeks go on.  These Nets still have two of the sport’s top players, a creative front office intact and championship-contending aspirations going into next season, but a part of their fabric left on Saturday.  “I would’ve loved to have Kenny here long-term,” Marks said during a news conference on Saturday. “It was time for another voice in that locker room.”  A new culture will emerge in Brooklyn. It will just no longer be Atkinson’s."
Kevin Durant will join (insert team he just lost to)
"2004-05: Steve Nash  2005-06: Steve Nash 2006-07: Dirk Nowitzki  2007-08: Kobe Bryant 2008-09: LeBron James 2009-10: LeBron James 2010-11: Derrick Rose  2011-12: LeBron James  2012-13: LeBron James  2013-14: Kevin Durant  2014-15: Stephen Curry  2015-16: Stephen Curry  2016-17: Russell Westbrook  2017-18: James Harden   Besides lbj and maybe kobe, who of these were elite defenders?"
&gt; While at Montrose Christian he played for coach Stu Vetter with future NBA star Kevin Durant.  [Yup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greivis_V%C3%A1squez)
"To me, you can't really definitively choose the ""best"" player of all time though I believe it has to be one of 5 players with MJ at top. It's all down to personal opinion; I like to separate them into tiers and that's not even a definite ranking; so much goes into a players skillset and it isn't a one on one game. If I was building a team, I would actually be happy with practically all players in the top tiers all time. Those great players at the top are so close together in terms of their overall skillset/game. With the right team built around them, coaching, luck, etc. they might've well ended up being the greatest or close to it.  Though the GOAT debate is not even a question; it's Jordan. Not only is he arguably the best player (tier 1), he's by far the greatest. His impact on the game, his stats, eye test, demeanor, marketability, winning, etc. The only way I see LeBron being considered 1A 1B with him is if LeBron somehow 2-3peats in LA with 2 Finals MVPs (He will also break the record for points most likely). I actually can also see 1 more ring with all these broken records make him 1B for plenty of people.  I did a quick best players tier list below for fun. It is highly debatable but I think there are 3 definite players in Tier 1 (MJ, Bron and Kareem). My tier 1 basically came down to who I think are the most dominant players of all time. Then it goes on (Barkley, KG, Curry, Moses, KG, Dirk, Baylor, etc.). I just tried to do 5 per tier but you can definitely do more and some of them would fit into those. All these players are so good that in an all time draft; I wouldn't mind having any of them to try to build a team and win.  Tier 1:  * Michael Jordan * LeBron James * Kareem Abdul Jabbar * Shaquille O'Neal * Wilt Chamberlain  Tier 2:  * Kobe Bryant * Magic Johnson * Larry Bird * Bill Russell * Hakeem Olajuwon  Tier 3:  * Tim Duncan * Jerry West * Oscar Robertson * Kevin Durant * Julius Irving"
"If 98% of the league said they were Kevin Durant, we would put them in concussion protocol."
"Curry is better than durant. Currys best seasons without durant are better than Durants, curry beat durant in the playoffs and when they played together curry got significantly more defensive attention than Kevin durant and curry really drove that offense"
"If 98% of the league say that, they'd be considered arrogant. When Kevin Durant said it, well, he is KD."
Kevin Durant is a playoff player. He harden like dips in efficiency every year before he joined a 73 win team
"We will see if it's impressive when they're actually not a good team for a stretch.  The only bad team they've literally ever had was right when they got a brand new team and had Kevin Durant on it.    I would expect the fanbase to stay around, cause much like Portland there's not really another game in town(although the Timbers do get a ton of love).  But there's nothing impressive about fans showing out for a team that has had an MVP caliber player since it's inception."
"""I'm Kevin Durant. You all know who I am"""
Current Coach Kerr had Splash Bros AND Kevin Durant for most of his championships. Don’t discount that fact. His coaching is overrated
Kevin Durant?
"Maybe not with his stats but from the eye test, 2018 Kevin Durant was probably the greatest talent I’ve ever watched. There was nothing anyone could do to guard him"
Aka the Kevin Durant. Hair looking like poorly cared for grass fields
Imagine if they had someone like Kevin Durant or Paul George playing with them too.
"I agree. I cannot wait for next year, just to see what this team is gonna look like.   Kevin Durant scares me. That dude can put the ball in the hoop. I just hope he’s almost as good as he was. He’ll be shooting a lot more though. Which is still scary lol"
Oh my god imagine how horrible an nba team will be when they have to start Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.
"Kyrie and 90 percent of Kevin Durant are basically a top 5 offense on  their own and they have a really good supporting cast. Plus, they have the assets to go out and add more talent. As long as Durant isn’t too compromised and Kyrie is on the court in the playoffs that team is a problem for the rest of the league"
"Hah yes I have played sports. I’d hate it if a teammate said what Kyrie did to the press. This was the quote:  &gt; Collectively, I feel like we have great pieces,” Irving said, “but it’s pretty glaring we need one more piece or two more pieces that will complement myself, KD [Kevin Durant], DJ [DeAndre Jordan], GT [Garrett Temple], Spence [Dinwiddie], Caris [LeVert], and we’ll see how that evolves.”  How do you think Jarrett Allen, Joe Harris, etc all feel about that quote? It’s one thing to say “we need some more pieces”. Everybody would agree with that and it’s a fair thing to say. It’s different to name drop the guys you want to stay and the guys that are expendable. It’s pretty obvious who he wants to stay and who he doesn’t care about being there. Doesn’t take much to read between the lines."
"“Having stars such as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the team put a target on Atkinson’s back, and sources say it was Irving who put the knife in it.”    I knew it!"
Fuss didn’t get that MVP because of his value he got it because Kevin Durant left and the hate for him was at its peak and everybody was feeling super sorry for Russ. Guy was a 6 seed and Harden smoked him in the post season. I will never believe that Russ got it for any other reason than the basketball community was having a huge pity party for him that season.
https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/01/kevin-durant-kendrick-perkins-twitter-fight
"He was literally answering the fucking question lmao.  &gt; Kyrie Irving was asked after tonight’s loss to Philly about this game against a top East opponent showing how much work the Nets still have to do in order to compete at the highest level while waiting for Kevin Durant to return  This sub wants players to give honest answers as opposed to the generic “we just need to play harder and score more points than the other team” and when they finally get one who does they shit on him.  Again, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with **naming the players that play for your team**. Saying “we need 1 or 2 more players to compliment player A, B and C” is a basic, simple statement that you and everyone else has blown out of proportion to justify your irrational hatred of the guy.  &gt; Name a leader or superstar that came out and named 5 players he wants team to be built around while not naming the younger and better center or the best shooter in the team.  I can’t find that because that’s an incredibly specific thing to look for. What do you want him to do? List every single player on the roster? All 15 of them? Tf? Should he list the G League guys as well? Maybe we should include the ball boy and the coach’s nephew as well while we’re at it."
"Okay. A lot of stuff to unpack there.   1. I got no idea what you're trying say about in the first part about Lebron and whatnot.  2. We are talking about the regular season in this line of comments..   3. I don't see the point in including when Kawhi was a role player because it doesn't make any sense to. Literally primes vs primes.   4. Wtf are you talking about giving trouble? I literally said they play each other to a standstill offensively. They never really guarded each other that much in the postseason, Kawhi was always on Russ during the OKC days, Durant and Danny Green guarded each other and the Warriors was just one game...   Kawhi - 24/8/4/3/1 50fg%  29%3P  Kevin - 27/6/3/0.5/1 51fg% 36%3P  That was their game stats during the same period btw. 8 games including.  Good convo, try not to get your panties in a twist next time and at least read what the chain is about."
&gt;1. Kevin Durant &gt;2. Larry Bird &gt;3. Chris Paul &gt;4. Tim Duncan &gt;5. Kawhi Leonard
"If your goal is winning more games, Steph Curry is objectively better than Kevin Durant."
"I won't restrict myself with that kind of true position. Though having LeBron at PG is not nice. So, I'll do it with players who could play that secondary position.        The ones I can think of;      1971-72   PG: Walt Frazier   SG: Jerry West   SF: John Havlicek   PF: Wilt Chamberlain   C: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar      1986-87   PG: Magic Johnson   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Larry Bird   PF: Kevin McHale   C: Hakeem Olajuwon      1992-93 (Basically the Dream Team with Hakeem instead of Ewing and Robinson)   PG: John Stockton   SG: Michael Jordan   SF: Charles Barkley   PF: Karl Malone   C: Hakeem Olajuwon      2002-03   PG: Jason Kidd   SG: Kobe Bryant or Tracy McGrady   SF: Kevin Garnett   PF: Tim Duncan   C: Shaquille O'Neal      2017-18   PG: Stephen Curry   SG: James Harden   SF: Kevin Durant   PF: LeBron James   C: Anthony Davis   (Actually I wanted to go with 2015-16, have Kawhi in there. But the gap between AD and DeAndre or Whiteside was far bigger than the gap between Kawhi and Harden.)      I think 1971-72, 1992-93 and 2002-03 are better than 1986-87 and 2017-18. But it's too hard to pick one from those 3."
"Those 4-6 feet away stats are honestly useless. No one really uses them because they don't make any sense. If Curry comes off a screen and a guy is 4 feet away from him they're usually trying to close the gap and 4 feet is literally 1 step for an NBA player. It's not like there's a guy just standing 4 feet away from him not doing anything.      If you believe Stephs gravity is overblown you literally can't be watching a good amount of Stephs games. He would be followed by 1 primary defender but the entire defense would be scramble as soon as he got started moving when the threat of him getting open was there. Kevin Durant, who is a 4 time scoring champion, would consistently get open lanes for easy dunks just because of Steph's gravity."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant is the better player in most situations imo but Steph gives you the highest possible ceiling imo
Kevin Durant
Durant has double the amount of All-NBA first teams that Steph does. 4x Scoring Champion. He was a dominant player long before Curry I don’t know how you can call him unsuccessful.   Is it because of his 2015 ring? Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving did not play. Durant would’ve won in 2012 if Bosh and Wade went missing.
"He’s not a better player than Kevin Durant pre Achilles. I thought people started to realize this when he actually joined the Warriors, you can see the gap between them.   Also for some reason people would praise Steph for having a unbelievable half against the rockets in game 6, when Durant was the one carrying the team the entire series before he got hurt. Steph was playing awful. I think even other Warrior players and their coach  have admitted KD is the better player"
"You also just compared losing to Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green to losing to the fucking Milwaukee bucks 3-1. Good one."
Kevin Durant
"Y’all are wild making it sound like not agreeing with this circlejerk is treason, KD joined Stephs team and curry changed the league with his style of play not Kevin durant.   I don’t even wanna make a decision on this I don’t really know the answer, what I do know is y’all are seriously disrespecting the only unanimous mvp and somebody who literally changed the game by saying it’s unequivocally KD."
"Active players ? If so then Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson"
That “You know who I am? I’m Kevin Durant.” And then drops a 40 piece on Beverly was amazing
Kevin Durant
reminder that Jay Williams only left ESPN's college basketball coverage and got featured more prominently on ESPN's networks and upgraded to their NBA shows is because he's friends with Kevin Durant. He's essentially their direct line to him and that circle. I noticed that any kind of negative takes about KD sort of disappeared from the network when he agreed to do his own version of LeBron's barbershop on ESPN+.
Allen Iverson is ranked higher all time than Kevin Durant
Their +10 list is:  Tim Duncan  Kobe Bryant  LeBron James  Allen Iverson  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Dominique Wilkins  Bob McAdoo  Dwyane Wade  Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
on behalf of the spurs representative on this reddit we also believe kevin Durant was better then kawhi leonard despite kawhi being on our team for the first 7 years
"kevin durant mixed with pablo prigioni. he could do it all, just not as athletically as KD."
And brong on a team with Kevin Durant AND Steph Curry  Their 3rd best player dropped 60 easily hahaha  I miss the warriors tbh. They were so likable and had such a great heel turn
Kevin Durant has become overrated offense wise. Obviously he is an insane player and a top 20 player of all time probably but those 3 years with 2 of the best offball players of all time have massively boosted how people see him as unguardable
"Not only that, he had to face:  * Portland: LaMarcus Aldridge &amp; Brandon Roy * 2x Defending Champion Los Angeles: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom &amp; Andrew Bynum * OKC: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden"
"Kawhi didn't really have to go up against that tough of competition:  Round 1: Nikola Vucevic  Round 2: Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons  Round 3: Giannis and Khris Middleton  Finals: Steph Curry, and a few games of Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  Dirk went through:  Round 1: LaMarcus Aldridge, Brandon Roy  Round 2: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum  Round 3: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh  He faced 3 of the top 5 players in the NBA (Kobe, LeBron and Wade, the other two being Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose)."
"Kevin Durant, not much to say. For me, KD is a top 15 all-time."
Kevin Durant
"Honestly, if you swapped Kobe and Shaq itd be a damn good list. But Shaq at 9 is pretty egregious. There's no argument for Kobe over Shaq.  Edit: I'll put my list  1a) Michael Jordan  1b) Lebron James  3) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  4) Shaq  5) Magic  6) Larry Bird  7) Tim Duncan  8) Kobe  9) Bill Russell  10) Wilt Chamberlain  11) Hakeem Olajuwon   12) Stephen Curry  13) Kevin Durant  14) Oscar Robertson  15) Karl Malone  16) David Robinson  17) Moses Malone  18) Kevin Garnett  19) Dwyane Wade  20) Dirk Nowitzki  21) Jerry West  22) Charles Barkley  23) Julius Erving  24) Elgin Baylor  25) Kawhi Leonard"
Pg - Steph Curry 2nd MVP season  SG - Jordan  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Tim Duncan Back to back MVP time  C - Hakeem Olajuwon 94-95 MVP
"Chris Paul, James Harden, Joe Johnson, Kevin Durant, Hakeem Olajuwon  dynasty"
This makes me miss Kevin Durant
"I also value differences in defenses between eras. Kobe was tearing up the league and averaging 35+ during an era when perimeter defenses were stifling. How many elite perimeter players did Jordan go against? Reggie Miller? Uh....Kobe faced: AI, TMac, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Carmelo, Kawhi Leonard, Lebron James, Dwyane Wade...list goes on, almost every night it’s a tough perimeter matchup. These are all time players. Jordan dominated an era dominated by big men. And even the elimination of hand checking and illegal defenses changed things. Kobe/Lebron have faced tougher teams and tougher dogs on the perimeter than Jordan did. Just my two cents."
1. LeBron James 2. Kobe Bryant 3. Dirk Nowitzki 4. Kevin Durant 5. Steve Nash 6. Damian Lillard 7. Vince Carter 8. Tracy McGrady 9. Deron Williams 10. Dan Dickau
Kevin Durant himself mentioned him as being the king Hooper putting him above himself.
"1) I dont know how controversial this is, it shouldnt be but maybe it is but the new height listings are still a rough estimate and hardly definite the way people treat them as. Kevin Durant is not 6'9.5 no matter what the NBA listings now tell you. Anybody who has been around Chris Paul or covered him for ex will tell you he's not 6'1. Can find a number of examples like that there's still a good bit of gamesmanship going on  2) The true examples of 16 vs 82 game players are pretty rare and far far less common than people think. It's not that they never exist(ie Draymond is an actual ex of one) it's most of the time when people describe someone as a ""16 or 82"" game player it's either overreacting to a small sample size or just being biased by like/dislking that player. Differences in the game obviously exist between the reg season and playoffs but they dont often directly translate to players production/impact the way fans assume  3) The vast majority of the time true top 10 type players flash serious glimpses/or stretches of that ability before the end of their rookie deal. The exceptions like Kawhi are far less than people think.  4) Andrew Wiggins/Kevin Love was a lose lose trade and the only reason people arent honest about it is because of the 3-1 comeback in a series Love was hurt averaged 8/8 on 38% shooting and was often a liability. The no 1 pick at the time was a super valuable asset, if we're being honest Love did not live up to expectations in Cleveland and they couldve gotten someone who helped that team alot more than him for something that valuable.   5) A realistic projection for SGA is low end all star, not the top 15 All NBA level guard type hype you often hear. Feel largely the same on Jaylen Brown while we're at it(realistic projection is probably a tad bit higher)"
"I would 100% take these 11 guys ahead of Webber's NBA career (which was like 4 really good seasons, then 5 seasons of decent/good yet injury prone starter)  1. Tim Duncan 2. LeBron James 3. Kobe Bryant 4. Dirk Nowitzki 5. Dwyane Wade 6. Kevin Garnett 7. Steve Nash 8. Jason Kidd 9. Allen Iverson 10. Dominique Wilkins 11. Bob McAdoo 12. Dwight Howard 13. Carmelo Anthony?  I guess he could sneak in with top 15, but will quickly be knocked out by guys like Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden"
I’d replace Iwundu with Kevin Durant because he’d help space the floor and give us a much needed boost offensively
Yes.  Dec 2015 against OKC.  KD blocked him at the buzzer.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-kevin-durant-beats-clippers-with-jumper-block-on-chris-paul/
"His Career Playoff PPG is by far the most impressive record he holds:  1. Michael Jordan 33.45 2. Allen Iverson      29.73 3. Jerry West          29.13 4. Kevin Durant      29.09 5. LeBron James   28.92  He is the only player on the list that has an average of 30+ PPG and the next closest player, Iverson, is nearly a whole 4 points behind him!  Just show the man did it better than anyone else during the most important time of the season."
"Haha. Good question... Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Durant."
"Great question. I've told Grant Hill several times that when I covered the NBA for the first time during the 1999-2000 season, he was the best player in the league. If Grant didn't get hurt, he would have been one of the greatest players ever. I was saw Grant fly, I swear he was flying, from the baseline for a dunk. I have seen some amazing performances in person from all the top players over the past 20 years. In terms of one sticking out, I remember Derrick Rose as a rookie playing against the veteran and tough Celtics. Believe it was 2008. Another case if a guy stayed healthy. The Bulls lost that series, but he was amazing during that breakthrough series for him. Kevin Durant was the most dominant I've seen offensively. Just nothing he can't do and he is unstoppable."
"Right which is why I never said you broke any rules? The warriors did nothing wrong, they built arguably the greatest team of all time. Kevin Durant did nothing wrong either I mean as a fan it wasn’t fun to watch but he didn’t take a pay cut or anything. I’m not saying anyone did anything wrong or cheated in any sense. Im legitimately not bitter either. I’m just saying that the situation with the cap was flawed. Yes they 100% played by the rules and that’s awesome for them but some people would point out that because of the cap the “rules” were broken in 2016. Any team who was a contender in 2015 now had room to add ANOTHER max player without having to drastically change their roster, that’s a circumstance that has not happened before in NBA history. You guys didn’t break the rules but the rules were built in a way that was an advantage to you (and a select few other teams that were also contenders in 2015 and could afford KD). Again just to clarify this is not the warriors fault in any way they just took advantage. But yes the league is built for parity and if the league had put rules in place to smooth out the cap that warriors team would not have happened. That’s all I’m arguing is the league messed up not the warriors. I don’t even think I personally would say it puts an asterisk on those championships. But if someone brings it up I mean yeah it’s worth talking about I don’t think it’s just like “the haters” or people who are bitter it’s a legit argument that the league messed up with the rules in place around the cap in 2016."
Das a fact. I play harder when I am 1 on 1 with my friend cuz if i cross him up shit gon be funny to talk about for a week.    But i can see why people say this shit. I get a bit more relaxed playing against friends mainly cuz I know who he is what his skills are and what to expect. I'd be more tense playing a stranger cuz idk if he godlike or he a scrub. But this shit don't apply to nba teams cuz everybody knows who Kevin Durant is.
Pg: Steve Nash/Magic Johnson  Sg: Micheal Jordan/Kobe Bryant/ Ray Allen Sf: Kevin Durant/ Lebron James/ Larry Bird Pf: Tim  Duncan/Dirk Nowitzki C: Hakeem Olajuwon/ Shaq O’Neil  Coach: Pop  I love this team so much but also just good luck finding any team that can beat this... it’s got like 10 of the 20 best players ever
"Because of the cap spike that allowed the warriors to get him. I know the players didn’t want to smooth it out but that was literally an unprecedented fluke scenario. If you think about it, all the systems the NBA puts in place (max contracts, losing teams getting high draft picks, salary caps, etc) is meant to try to create more parity. The fact that the 73 win warriors were able to get Kevin Durant without him having to take a pay cut were those systems failing honestly. It was all possible because of a super unusual circumstance."
"Kevin Durant would return to the Thunder.  The Thunder was his home and after being one god tier performance away from another Finals appearance, he would be ready to go it again with RW"
Gary Payton played up until 2007. So it's not a surprise. Kevin Durant of the Seattle SuperSonics played against Payton.
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Garnett and Kevin Durant.  Spent early career on small market team. Tried hard for a chip, but fails. Moved to big market team full of stars, win a ring.  And moved to the Nets."
"Moses Malone and Kevin Durant (pre injury) were kind of on a similar trajectory.   Came in to the pros as a highly touted player.   First two seasons on a team that stopped existing altogether (Moses the ABA and KD on the Sonics)  Stat monster but could never win the title. (Moses in Houston and KD in OKC)  Left that team and went to join another MVP fan favorite player along with other all star level guys and dominated the league immediately (83 sixers and 17 warriors both rolled through the playoffs with exactly 1 loss)   Left that star studded team after a relatively short stint (4 for Moses in Philly, 3 for KD in GSW)"
"Yea? They are still good, they just aren't better without Kevin freaking Durant. This is a bad argument. I can't believe I have to explain something so basic on this sub.  Steph has some of the biggest dick riders on this sub....sheesh."
"“I was like, who is this yellow skin kid?” -Kevin Durant"
"Yea I watch the games, its still a poor argument.  He had 0 points in that first half. Klay carried him that half. I dont care how many open looks you get Iggy, he's not going 6 for 8 for an entires series. The Rockets absolutely beat them without KD.  And Curry doesnt get a pass for being  crappier when KD is on the floor, sorry doesnt work that way. He should be able to still  play well with another great scorer on the floor and maintain his efficiency. His volume and efficiency would have gone up but they lose over a whole series. Every game of that series was close.  All these Steph Curry fans can down vote me but you'll never be able to logically say Kevin Durant makes your team worse. That's dumb."
What does athletic really mean though? Some of these guys put up horrible numbers at the nba combine like KD who couldnt bench 185 and apparently had a below average vert/agility drill but he's an all time great first balot HoF player. Was Kevin Durant really an above average NBA athlete or was he just an all time great player who had the skill to shoot from anywhere but wouldn't really overpower or outspeed guys.  Like comparing Dirk to KG/Malone/Barkley/Duncan he's probably the least athletic of those guys but you might say the most skilled.
Kevin Durant is going to be a bust because he's too skinny
"Kevin Durant * Thunder and Warriors.  Kevin Garnett * Twolves and Celtics (primarily)  We were talking about KG.  I was even nice by not bringing up me being well into my 40s and been watching basketball since the 80s so this is pretty muchdone, right?  :)"
Yeah how could they have been the greatest team of all time if they hadn’t even added Kevin Durant yet?
He averaged 28 on elite efficiency in the WCF. If he’s healthy enough to lead a 3-1 comeback against Kevin Durant he’s healthy enough to not use injury as an excuse.
Y’all had Kevin fucking Durant and RWB in their absolute primes and couldn’t even make the finals for the last 4 years.
"Kobe wins 5 more rings. LeBron, seeing this, realizes he needed a start PG not a SG &amp; PF combo and he teams up with Steve Nash on the Knicks. It turns out, the curse of the Knicks affects everyone and btoh get injured and retire early. Because of this, Cleveland never wins a title and, eventually, the NBA moves the team to Seattle to make up for the Thunders move. Kevin DUrant, seeing this and wanting to make up for Seattle's hurt, signs to the Seattle Cavaliers and wins 3 rings. Russell Westbrook, upset at Durant's success outside of OKC and without him, signs to the Celtics and tries to match Bull Russell's championship resume.... AND HE SUCCEEDS! Westbrook is then named the true GOAT. With an uncountable amount of rings and triple doubles, only one player has the chance to match his resume    [and that player is....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX7vRertYQs)"
God I hate kevin durant so fuckin much. Robbed this dude of at least 1 ring.
"Idk about that, like I said that’s when the term greatness and best need to be broken off, Curry is greater than Kevin Durant. Kd has a case for best scorer of all time but his legacy won’t be defined by that it will be defined by the fact he went to the warriors to win"
No that would be Kevin Durant
"i recently did a opinionated, but advanced stat based measurement of PLAYOFF performance after 1973 season     the break down is   VORP worth 21 points   W/S worth 21 points   Offensive W/S worth 21 points   Defensive W/S worth 21 points   Championships worth 16 points   for a total of 100 points   Here are the players after 1970.       1. Michael Jordan      2. Lebron James      3. Tim Duncan      4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar      5. Magic Johnson      6. Kobe Bryant      7. Shaq      8. Scottie Pippen      9. Larry Bird      10. Kevin Durant  Kawhi might have ""stretches"" where he's better than Kobe, but all time Playoffs, Kawhi is no where near."
Kevin Durant
"1- And so is Durant.  2- And so is Steph—-2 times. One unanimous—-and he didn’t come close to winning FMVP over KD  3- Kevin Garnett never played with Michael Jordan.   4- The 1 year pippen was without Mike, he came in 3rd in MVP voting"
"LeBron + Kawhi is basically Prime LeBron but he'll actually win DPOY   Giannis + Durant is an overpowered Dirk   Kobe + Klay at 6'8"" at SG sounds like a shorter Kevin Durant who shoots better   1). Giannis+Durant if this was true that'd be GOAT level dominance  2). LeBron + Kawhi sounds like Miami LeBron but better defensively and at mid-range  3). Kobe + Klay is discount KD with Mamba mentality."
"It reeeeally is tho hahaha Especially when it’s **Kevin Durant**. He’s gonna average 26+, 7, and 5 on elite efficiency. He is not, NOT going to win FMVP in such case"
"Joining a 73 win team that beat you, when you’re already one of the best players in the league is trash. It ain’t legendary. It’s one thing for somebody like Andrew Wiggins or Malik Beasley to do it, but Kevin freaking Durant that nearly had them beat in 2016???"
11. Hakeem   12. Kevin Durant   13. Moses Malone   14. Kevin Garnett   15. Julius Erving
"**Serge Ibaka:**   C: Nikola Vucevic  PF: Kevin Durant  SF: Kawhi Leonard  SG: James Harden  PG: Russell Westbrook  6: Pascal Siakam  7: DeMar DeRozan  8: Kyle Lowry  9: Marc Gasol  10: Serge Ibaka  **LeBron James:**   C: Shaquille O'Neal  PF: Anthony Davis  SF: LeBron James  SG: Dwyane Wade  PG: Kyrie Irving  6: Kevin Love  7: Chris Bosh  8: Ray Allen  9: Mo Williams  10: Zydrunas Ilgauskas  &amp;#x200B;  Assuming everyone is in their primes, I think team LeBron wins. Teammates based off of their time spent with LeBron/Serge, still LeBron."
Damian Lillard + Kevin Durant is the darkhorse.
Kevin durant has been meeting that stat since 2012 lol
One-on-one is a really ugly game and favors height a lot. Kareem killed Dr. J by just backing him down from the perimeter and Kevin Garnett won the Team USA one-on-one tournament in 2000.  So I think Durant probably would beat anyone.
"Well in general, on/off is bad because you get just as much ""credit"" for other guys on your team sucking as you do for your own play. There is so much going on that it's wildly unreliable. That's why the adjusted +/- stats exist.  Kevin Durant  2017: 25/8/5, .651 TS%, **+8.6 on/off**  2018: 26/7/5, .640 TS%, **+1.9 on/off**  2019: 26/6/6, .631 TS%, **+16.1 on/off**  KD is one of the most consistent players  It's hard for me to take on/off seriously. But DBook is a very good player."
Bold of you posting an article that contains the words “Warriors forward Kevin Durant” around here.
I thought the Raps would struggle hard this year. Fighting for the 7th seed type struggle. Kevin Durant passed LeBron as best in the world. (2012ish). Hasheem Thabeet would be a beast.
Why are Kevin Durant and Charles Barkley the only names bolded?  Seems disrespectful to everyone else
Kevin Durant had no symptoms according by himself afaik.
"My pick would be the 2016 Spurs team who were so stacked they won 67 games even though 90% of their team was way past their prime at the time (Tim Duncan, Kawhi, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, LaMarcus Aldridge, David West, Andre Miller, Kevin Martin, Boris Diaw, Danny Green).   That’s a starting lineup of five future famers and rotation of eight total all-stars, plus Boris Diaw and Danny Green lol...   Other recent teams   2011 Celtics (SHAQ, Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Rondo, jermaine O’Neal, all in their primes)  2013 Heat (LeBron, Ray Allen, D-Wade, Bosh, Juwan Howard, Mike Miller, Rashard Lewis, Shane Battier)  2004 Lakers (SHAQ, Kobe, Malone, Payton, Byron Russell, Rick Fox, Derek Fisher)  2019 Warriors (Kevin Durant, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Cousins, Iguodala, Bogut, Livingston)  2013 Lakers  2018 Cavs with LeBron wade love rose isiah Thomas etc  2012 thunder"
"Kevin Durant talks trash to FMVP vote recipient, FVV."
"&gt; theres nothing normal about any of the shit kyrie says, dude. if you were right, and it was normal, we woulnd't be having this conversation right now.   The reason we’re having this conversation is because you, along with most of this sub, puts him under a microscope and overreact to every little thing he says.   &gt; i'd also love for you to find me lebron and Kd saying that. There has 100% been guys who have said it, but certainly not those two.  [Durant: “I love it here man. I love my teammates, I love the city, I don’t really think about anywhere else,” Durant said in an interview with Revolt TV this week (via Michael Scotto of The Associated Press). “I hear it all the time, don’t get me wrong, and once you hear it you’re kind of like...But for me, I love staying in the moment, and I’m one of those guys that would love to stick it out with one team my whole career.”  ](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2416840-kevin-durant-says-he-wants-to-stay-with-thunder-for-entire-career)   [LeBron: “I’m not going anywhere ever again… I don’t have the energy (for free agency).”](https://fox8.com/sports/his-own-words-what-lebron-james-has-said-about-cleveland-free-agency/)   Come on bro."
"ya at first i said ""i mean this in the kindest way possible, is the kevin durant center like a scuffed version of the i promise school?"" then i realized that was kinda fucked up so i made a nice edit, then i realized the whole quarantine thing is why all the kids were filming at home so i just re-did it from the ground up"
"[you still dont get it, do you?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnFYYfyXcAEK4-7.jpg)  [JR gave you up](https://res.cloudinary.com/tsl/image/upload/s--HIwGhqOM--/c_scale,w_600/v1545156591/stephen-curry-kevin-durant-getty.jpg)"
"It’s hard cuz it’s not fair to ppl like Steve Nash not getting a shot near the GOAT list just because they are a point guard. It could be argued that Steve Nash impacts the game better than Kevin Durant, but Durant’s the guy posting up against LBJ and getting the buckets. It’s kind of like how it’s hard to call a football player GOAT, because different positions bring different stuff to the table."
......kevin durant
Only after adding Kevin Durant following an unsmoothed salary cap spike
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"The last 3 years he was an incredible defender  He also improved his passing dramatically, but do you really want Kevin Durant looking to pass in the first place?"

"...oh my god.   Kevin Durant wasn't asking ""how do we really know about Solar Flares"" or some shit.  He was asking, ""but how do we REALLY know that Ra travels to the underworld every night and fights a giant snake?""  That makes it even a million times better"
Same way I think with Kevin Durant and Ed Sheeran are similar in some way.
"I mean you could make a case for Kevin Durant in the 2016 WCF. Up 3-1, then continued to have bad game after bad game throwing up questionable shots"
"And yet you don't take issue with labeling the Cavs as a superteam. Kyrie's role paired with LeBron the same Clay did Curry.  Iguodala and Green were each just as impactful, if not more that Kevin Love.   The whole reason we give Durant shit is for making a superteam even more super by joining them."
are you still talking about Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant
"Kevin ""New Delhi"" Durant"
"""Source: Kevin Durant purportedly 'wants to be with winners'; Nets engaged in trade talks with COVID-19. Compensation could include the Virus' lottery picks"""
"Ok and how many players like that are there in the league? Maybe 6?   Based on this opinion which I constantly see on this sub, none of the following are good enough to take a team to championship contender status as the best player on their team:  - Chris Paul (prime) - Dame Lillard - Anthony Davis - James Harden - Joel Embiid   None of those guys have ever reached the finals before outside of Harden as a 6th man. In fact for most of their careers they havnt even come close. Yet if I were to say that any of them arent good enough to take a team to championship contender status as the best player on the team then I’d probably get a lot of hate.   There are literally 4 current NBA players who have taken their team to the finals as the best player on the team...  1. Lebron James 2. Steph Curray 3. Kevin Durant 4. Kawhi Leonard   How come Kyrie is the one that constantly gets the whole “he’s good but not good enough to be the number 1 option” criticism."
"I also love the Pistons, but I think we can upgrade this a bit.  PG - Chauncey SG - Klay Thompson  SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Sheed C - Dennis Rodman  Has my 3 favorite players (Billups, Sheed, Rodman), plus better wing options. I would love watching Billups with elite perimeter shooting (much respect for Rip and Tayshaun but Klay and KD are superstars)."
Kevin Durant created the coaches challenge for the controversial blocking call in the finals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6znLi0aKBo  Kevin Durant and Geno Auriemma (women's basketball coach) admit that Griner would have no chance agasint Cousins.
Dame is better than anybody the Thunder have had since Kevin Durant
Fuuuuuuck Kevin Durant
"Anthony Davis to the Lakers for the majority of their roster and Russell Westbrook to the Rockets for Chris Paul and a truckload of picks. Throw in Kawhi leaving as a finals MVP to the Clippers, who gave up as many picks they could for Paul George. Then, on top of all that, you have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving joining the Nets."
"Yea fuck all those nurses and doctors who can’t get tested, it’s Kevin Durant guys!"
"Obviously, I'm biased as an NBA fan on an NBA fan board, but I agree.  Rudy Gobert getting a test then testing positive shut down the whole NBA which led to a cascade of every other major sporting event (and basically all entertainment events) getting suspended within 24 hours... that I think saved lives by just really hammering home how serious this is.  The fact that this is basically the top post of r/all and that kevin durant testing positive was a top post and trending like crazy shows how having visible people test positive can really send shockwaves across the world, and hopefully have the type of effect that gets people to take this seriously, quarantine, and slow the spread of the virus. That is the benefit of having famous people take the tests. If it was random ass rich people who have no symptoms but are super paranoid, then that would be extra fucked up to me, but having NBA players who have legitimate exposure risks taking tests seems rational.  Also because many people just assume ""oh it's only in the specific outbreak communities, so I'm probably fine in my less affected city"" will see that multiple players on multiple NBA teams have all been positive--and have been since traveling across the country interacting with tons of people--and therefore this virus could really be anywhere, affecting anyone."
Kevin fucking Durant is the last person I'm worried about. He could blow his nose with dollar bills equalling my net worth and wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
Every one of you fat losers defending asymptomatic Kevin Durant getting tested over front line medical workers who we don’t have enough tests for is literal human garbage.
"But the system is already fucked up (you must have been living under a rock to not know that the US ""healthcare"" system is fucked up or that the president called the coronavirus a haux). Who btw can afford to have grocery delivered? Kevin Durant who makes tens of million a year or a young mother with a newborn baby? Who comes in contact with more in number and more in vulnerability people? The poor stock person who puts food on the shelves and has no income were it not for the job or you know Kevin Durant? How many people are interacting with Durant vs going to the grocery store?  This is not about public health lets not talk about proper healthcare -- that does not exist); this is pure preferential treatment for those who have the $$$$$."
Yeah but nobody knows who was in the same room with some dude named dave. Everyone who has been in a room with kevin durant in the past week and a half knows who he is and can be identified as a vector. This response isnt about lethality it's about limiting the spread of the virus.
"&gt;I would assume it's because for those 3 who are upper class there are probably 50,000 who are working class,   Who's give a fuck how much they make? Kevin Durant is constantly having people want to shake his hand, take pictures with him, get his autograph, be surrounded by paparazzi, etc. He is 10x more likely to spread the virus than some random guy working construction?    &gt;still working because we were told to only worry if you show symptoms who don't have access to any type of testing.  Uh. Golbert, Mitchell, and Wood were still playing games and traveling with the team while infected. They were working the whole time.    &gt;Testing, or lack there of will go down as one of the biggest failures in the US response to this outbreak.  This doesn't have shit to do with the nets or the NBA. This is what the mayor should be focused on instead dog-whistling to get people angry."
"Kevin Durant just tested positive, this joke aged horribly, fast."
Yea Kevin Durant is “going to get through this.” And good for him.  But he was   A. Tested.  B. Is young and healthy.  C. Likely has the best health care money can buy.
"here's an unpopular opinion, NOBODY CARES! oh no, Kevin Durant tested positive, what is he doing with all that money of his and what's a good majority of rich people doing with all that money of theirs... absolutely fucking nothing"
"Lmfao what the fuck, [this is what you sound like right now](https://youtu.be/8ywTrOgEzKE)  Edit: Also I’m a leftist, I’m just as concerned as anyone about the working class being able to pay bills, which is why I support M4A and jobs programs and expansion of Social Security, but I can also feel bad that Kevin Durant got a dangerous disease"
the one with Kevin Durant
"This is bullshit the nba is allowed to buy tests from private labs even ones in other countries it’s not the nba players fault their bosses care about them being tested considering they hit 4 different states a week. Don’t blame nba players when they have been donating trying to help food banks, testing facilities, and out of work employees. The government is ill-prepared and it’s not fucking Kevin Durant or any nba players fault that we don’t have tests for the American public"
"*""I'm feelin like the world is Skip Bayless and I'm LeBron James.""* - Kevin Durant"
The team with a healthy Kevin Durant wins.
I think Kevin Durant and Tom Hanks testing positive is huge to get the point across though.
"You need to keep bitching at the rich and celebrities to get more dumb voters on your side.  I don't know what for though, he sure as fuck ain't going to be President of anything ever.  The bug does not discriminate. What if Kevin Durant or a random player who was positive go spend time with their grandparents because they didn't quarantine themselves after being exposed and carrying? Stop discriminating rich or poor when the virus itself does not care, and will equally hurt the old age groups regardless of your social status"
"Their spacing is just atrocious. Stockton is the only guy on that team who can reliably hit a 3 pointer. Wade is a career 29% 3PT shooter, McHale couldn't shoot beyond 18 feet, Mourning couldn't stretch the floor beyond 15 feet, and Pippen was a career 32% 3PT shooter but this includes the shortened 3PT line from 95-97 where he shot the best of his career. Take those outlier seasons out and he's a career 31% 3PT shooter.  So with the lack of spacing Wade and Pippen cannot slash effectively and the lane becomes clogged with two low post scorers in McHale and Mourning. Not to mention team 1x MVP matches up super well. Rose and Stockton is a decent matchup. MVP rose is as good as Stockton was (Stockton's real strength was how long he stayed great). Kobe v Wade is a great battle but Kobe comes out on top. Durant v Pippen is great and Pippen probably has the best chance out of anyone at stopping Durant, but at the end of the day Durant is better than Pippen. McHale would have his way with Dirk, but Hakeem is arguably the greatest rim protector of all time and he'd be right there because Mourning cannot stretch the floor.   I think team no MVP would be better if you had:   Chris Paul / Jerry West / Scottie Pippen / Kevin McHale / Patrick Ewing"
Lol for real. Don’t worry about Kevin Durant. Worry about your parents and grandparents.
Why is this what I needed to help me cope. Thank you Kevin Durant!
"How does Kevin Durant get a test? Especially when he says ""he is feeling fine"". I have a friend who is a nurse who is showing symptoms and it took 4 days for her to get tested."
why are u using league average TS to Kevin freaking Durant? KD is not an average player and the fact that his TS is only a few percentages above league average shows how bad he was
That ain't Kevin durant
Did Kevin Durant tear his achilles because of Covid-19? Find out more after the break.
"Yeah but Cavs were super mis-equipped to guard him. They had to put Kevin Love, old Richard Jefferson, and Jr Smith on Durant"
No. It’s Kevin Durant. Warriors fans are getting out of control
"Controversial: Fuck Kevin Durant, fucking Stringer Bell got this shit.  ""Not string, man....""  ""Hopper: He got that WMD, y'all..."""
"\#3 is just wrong. KD has been seen has LeBron's equal as far back as 2011 and they were as close to 1a and 1b as any players in the league till Steph Curry came along. Look at this article from 2012, when KD was only 23 years old:  [https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1283009-breaking-down-the-differences-between-lebron-james-and-kevin-durant#slide8](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1283009-breaking-down-the-differences-between-lebron-james-and-kevin-durant#slide8)   KD has had years of regular seasons that always put him neck at neck with LeBron, Kawhi has not reached that level, and he also has not played LeBron in the playoffs since he became a superstar (2016-2017), while KD has and has shown up every time. This year was probably the best year for that to happen but unfortunately coronavirus came up"
Who know that the whole time Kevin Durant was patient zero
"Kevin Durant but it's not because of the rings argument because both of their rings aren't significant in their argument for all-time greatness. KD's rings hold less weight for obvious reasons and Kawhi's rings are just a little different. Won in 2014 due to team basketball and although he won FMVP, there's no argument for him being the best player on the team really since it was largely team basketball and him not coming into the player he is today just yet. Then he won last year against a heavily depleted Warriors.    I think KD is the more legendary player just based off of body of work."
They’re rich and famous. You think anybody is going to refuse Kevin Durant a test?  EDIT: Idk why I’m getting downvoted. People who are rich/famous/have connections get things before the general population. I’m not saying it’s right but that’s just how it is. Tom Hanks got tested immediately too.
"Kevin fucking Durant, and it's not really close."
Crazy day. Kevin Durant caught the coronavirus and Tom Brady is a Buccaneer and no longer a Patriot.
"&gt;Kevin Durant and three other players for the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the team and media reports, as the disease continued to spread around the league with the largest known outbreak in American sports.  &gt;After the team said that four players had tested positive on Tuesday, The Athletic said Mr. Durant confirmed that he was one of them, though he has not exhibited any symptoms of the Covid-19 disease.  &gt;Durant joins Tom Hanks and Idris Elba as some of the internationally famous celebrities who have tested positive for the virus that has changed life around the world.  &gt;“Everyone be careful, take care of yourself and quarantine,” he told The Athletic. “We’re going to get through this.”  &gt;One of the four Nets players who tested positive has exhibited symptoms while three remain asymptomatic, according to the team, which did not name them."
What’s so confusing about it? Kevin Durant is clearly ill from the corona virus and is fighting for his life. Seems pretty explicit to me.    /s
you heard it here first the 4 players are:  kevin durant (already confirmed)  kyrie irving  Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and  Rodions Kurucs
i am actually kevin durant and i can tell you it hasn't humbled me at all
What has Kevin Durant ever done to give you the impression that he thinks of himself in this way?
"Because Kevin Durant is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Nets. The other players less so, but these people are also investments."
"Kevin Durant is pretty young and in good shape.  The problem isn't people like him getting the virus, it's him transmitting it to someone who could be seriously hurt by it.    Don't downplay it just because you don't understand why it's an issue."
[KD is apparently one of the four that tested positive.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/coronavirus-kevin-durant-among-four-brooklyn-nets-players-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-virus/amp/)

"There’s no data behind athletic ability deterring the effects of the virus. Being a world class athlete means you’re pushing your body to it’s limits, at all times. These people’s bodies crumble once they hit 30. They’re athletic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean healthy.   Regardless, covid-19 is a viral infection, and it attacks humans, we’re all human.

"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Deandre Jordan And Garrett Temple?"
Name a more iconic duo then kevin Durant and jumping onto a hot team
Kevin Durant is having a horrible year:(  Can’t wait to see him bounce back!
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie and DeAndre I bet"
"""Do you realize Kevin Durant isn't a shooter, he's a scorer"" pls tell me that part is edited lmao"
"Chase Budinger, I live in San Diego and went to see U of A Wildcats vs. SDSU Aztecs probably sometime around 2007-2008. Even during an away game, everyone treated him like a celebrity, like he was going to be the next big thing. Everyone in the arena was there to see Chase play against the Aztecs, and even the SDSU announcers kept talking about him/showing his stats on the big screen (I guess because he's an SD local, went to LCC).  He was balling out the whole game too, and apparently in highschool he was co-MVP of the McDonald's All American game in 2006, sharing the MVP with Kevin Durant. THE Kevin Durant.   Anyways, a while ago I remembered this, this childhood memory I have of me seeing this white kid with blonde-swoopy hair ball out during one of the only college basketball games I ever went to and I looked him up, turns out he bounced around the league for a bit, went and played overseas for one year, then dropped basketball entirely. He's playing volleyball now, which is apparently a passion of his, and he's doing very well too. I was just surprised remembering how huge and popular this guy was back when I saw him play in 2007-2008, and that he didn't really make a big impact in the league like I thought he would."
Kevin Durant gets it out of nowhere.
Their worst shooter is Kevin Durant who was *only* a 41.9% 3PT shooter in his prime.
Yeah you can see even in this link just how much doubling and even tripling at times he was getting. [14 shots down hte stretch of that game he got to the rim once maybe twice](https://www.sbnation.com/2013/5/14/4330060/kevin-durant-video-breakdown-grizzlies-thunder) one was when the help broke down the other was a full court last poss situation.
"The vast majority of the time when people call Defender X ""The Superstar Y stopper!!"" it's dumb but Tony Allen really did used to give Kevin Durant issues and KD even admitted it. I only know the stats from 2014-17 dont know what they were before then but 2014-17 in like 450 poss KD was at like 24 pts/100 poss(way below his avg of like 38) on 46% TS when TA was his primary defender I remember looking up last year.  Clicking the link it appears Tayshaun Prince was more the guy on KD though."
Yeah because clearly all you have to do is play more defense and Kevin Durant will miss.
Notice who takes the shot. It’s Kevin Durant not Steph
"Well yea, you have one of the greatest championship cores in history then add Kevin freaking Durant. You’re damn right barely anyone in history stands a chance. Imagine adding Shaq, Hakeem or Wilt onto the Jordan Bulls, that’s along the lines of what GSW had."
This game shows even more how much of a weak pathetic move it was by Kevin Durant to join the Warriors. Smh
"&gt;If your metric has Larry Bird and Kobe Bryant outside of the Top 10, Chris Paul ahead of Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan at 3rd, your metric is wrong and you should start from scratch.  Chris Paul has played longer than KD, and this is a cumulative ranking. Bird had a career cut short, and this is a cumulative ranking. Kobe is often just outside people's top 10 in any metrics, and he he sufferd some serious injuries that affected his productive longevity, and this is a cumulative ranking.   Not that any of that matters when your personal opinion on a top 10 is totally irrelevant to the quality of a metric.   &gt;Basketball is not played without teammates or opponents, you can't isolate the value of a player like that.  And yet that's basically the entire point of every metric and debate across every sport  🤔  &gt;There's no debate and if you create a series that lands you with the results that i mentioned above, scratch that series and start all over again.  😂 Sure, ok - your personal opinion is clearly correct and this moron who watched thousands upon thousands of possession samples for each player and meticulously compared and compiled stats is hilariously off base.   It's totally fine to have an informed, intelligent criticism of a piece of work, but this is just talking head babble with a heavy sidedose of misunderstanding.   Check out the series and see what you think after that."
"If your metric has Larry Bird and Kobe Bryant outside of the Top 10, Chris Paul ahead of Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan at 3rd, your metric is wrong and you should start from scratch.  Basketball is not played without teammates or opponents, you can't isolate the value of a player like that.  My point is simple, even if you ignore the fact that Michael was far better than both Kareem and LeBron by the fact that he has better advanced analytics, normal stats and individual accomplishments than BOTH, he also did more in less time with less.  Michael had a worse supporting cast than both LeBron and Kareem and still won more championships in less time in a more dominant fashion.  There's no debate and if you create a series that lands you with result that i mentioned, scratch that series and start all over again."

"There’s so much more to winning a championship. Luka has a pretty good team, but not great yet. Even then he’ll have a small change to repeat that many times. A team with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green only got 3. Shit happens and very few teams can be contenders and win 6 times.   I will say Luka has an advantage where the league is more balanced than during LeBron’s era. Unless another super team comes together, Luka can have even ground with the rest of the league."
"Has anyone ever said he is a bad teammate? As in toxic to their teammates?    I don't think anyone has, what people criticize is his style of play and going braindead on court, which can make him a bad teammate in the sense that when u have Kevin Durant a 7 foot scorer incredibly efficient u don't take more shots than him as a point guard, u try to give him the ball, the biggest criticism that Westbrook came in was when Magic went off on him in 2012 (Magic overexaggerated a lot) , and he was taking more shots than KD in that finals which is dumb   Look at how people changed their perception of Westbrook now that he has changed his style on the Rockets and he is no longer taking dumb threes and shit, guys like Lowe who didn't like him started to compliment him"

"Fun fact about Deron Williams.   D.Will is currently being paid more $ this season by the Nets than 2/3 of their current roster.   Only current Nets making more than D.Will’s final $5.3m buyout payment are Joe Harris, DeAndre Jordan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant."

Too bad he couldn’t have saved Portland from drafting Greg Oden # 1 when Kevin Durant was on the board taken # 2 by Seattle.
"Penny for thought....if the season restarts in late June and playoffs start in July, maybe we can see Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving leading the Nets."

"Loyalty of LeBron James, Wokeness of Kyrie Irving, Social media use of Kevin Durant, thickness of Guerschon Yabusele."
"Long arms and legs: Kevin Durant. Legs for days. Personality: Steve Kerr. She'll be a cunning one. Soft hands: Steph Curry. Nice stroke. Face: Devin Booker. He's pretty. Hair: Kelly Olynyk. Beautiful sheen. Butt: Kyle Lowry. Can't argue that. Height: Spud Webb. 5'7"" is a nice height. Boobs: Charles Barkley. Present day. Then get a lift. Abs: Lebron James. He's pretty cut."
Imagine if Kevin Durant comes back for the playoffs and takes the nets to the title as a 7 seed
Kevin Durant easily.
"They'd be worse, of course, because Steph Curry is on another level than any other shooter that's come before him. Kevin Durant post Achilles will also be worse than himself prior.   That said, they'd still be a championship contender depending on what they gave up to get Beal."
"I look at it this way, Kevin Durant was the ultimate insurance policy the Warriors could buy after that 3-1 choke job when the Splash Bros became the Trash Bros, Barnes couldn't hit a shot to save his ass and Draymond smacked LeBron in the nuts to get himself suspended.  The Cavs took them to 6 before losing in 2015 (with Tristan Thompson as the 2nd best Cav on the floor), and beat them in 7 in 2016.   With KD added to that Warriors team? The series ends in 5 games, tops."
"But the Thunder had Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook......"
Your franchises all time best player is worth half a Kevin Durant. Talk about bums.
Yeah Brandon Roy was so fucking nice but there's no way that you can watch him and Kevin Durant both play and say that he's better than KD
"As people have said, the rise of internet highlights and streaming probably played a part, but also, I used to work at an entertainment agency as a book analyst, and the short of it, at least from a storytelling perspective, is that they haven't been able to build a consistent  overarching story for the league.   Lebron jumping teams repeatedly and looking like a jerk caused a lot of problems. They started to recover some of it when he went back to Cleveland and battled the Warriors, but Kevin Durant then ruined that."
he included Kevin Durant in the list
"Pretty sure 30 teams would have signed him, regardless of what percentage he comes back at.  &amp;#x200B;  He's Kevin Durant and GMs are stupid"
Who gives a shit when you have Kevin Durant Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving.  They’d mostly likely still have DeAndre Jordan and can try to get a cheap 3-D wing
Kevin Durant. He’s probably my least favourite player of all time and I’d hate to see our fans cheering for such a serpent.
hamptons five is the least cool sounding name for a sports team possibly ever. Might as well call them Kevin Durant and his merry band of basketball friends.  However I think they would win against that Chicago team.
"ok but you realize he is in a much better place for him to succeed now? so I just don't see the drop off coming. he plays like a 7'3"" Klay Thompson, he doesn't have to be Kevin Durant or Dirk. (before people get on my ass I am comparing him to Klay not saying they're rhe same)"
"I think there’s a distinction between best and greatest. My example of this is Kevin Durant, who I think is a top 10 all time “best” player but he’s not “greater” than Bill Russell  Jordan is both tho imo."
"The whole point of this thread is that not every team got a chance to make a final offer for Harden. And the Thunder were eviscerated in the media and by fans for the deal when it happened, so it’s not like the popular opinion that Martin and a first was even value. It’s not just Bill Simmons, you can find hundreds of articles about it by tons of respected journalists, including one by Zach Lowe where he calls Harden a future top-ten player and talks about how Harden shot 70% at the rim, nearly 40% from three and his numbers even actually improved when Durant and Westbrook hit the bench.  If your argument is simply that “nobody envisioned Harden to get to the point where he had one of the three best volume scoring seasons in history” then yes technically you’re obviously correct but I would counter by saying *any young player*, even some of the best prospects of all-time, are unlikely to actually have a season like that.  But it boggles my mind that the third overall pick in the draft had by far the most efficient scoring season in the entire league and yet was traded for one year of a past-his-prime Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb after a terrible season, and a mid-first round pick. I believe Cuban when he says the deal was executed without the chance for some other teams to make a final offer."
"On my eye test, Roy was able to do more than all of those guys. Kevin Durant is the one I'm truly reconsidering placing back above Roy..."
"Kevin Durant is certainly debatable in my eyes, but Brandon Roy was more skilled than D Wade without a doubt in my mind tbh. Better shooter, elite handles, elite athleticism before injuries. He could take you to hole or pull up from 35 with ease."
"&gt;Lakers guard Kobe Bryant was asked on the John Thompson Show who he feels is the toughest opponent to guard in the NBA. Instead of picking Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant, Bryant went with Portland’s Brandon Roy.  &gt;""Roy 365 days, seven days a week. Roy has no weaknesses in his game,"" Bryant said."
"pull up Kevin freaking Durant. People put wayyyy too much stock into ""Player x said player y..."" stuff."
"Brandon Roy was not *that* good. I don't know how you could watch him and think ""yeah this guy's better than Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant"""
"&gt;does 'similar caliber' mean the same thing as 'AS GOOD' ?  &gt;literally, yes  Oh, so vocabulary and reading comprehension are your issues then. Got it.  Literally, NO. No, they don't mean the same thing. Kevin Durant is a similar caliber of player as Lebron James. Kevin Durant is not as good of a player as Lebron James. English is really hard."
"C Alonzo Mourning   PF Kevin Garnett   SF Kevin Durant   SG Vince Carter   PG Jason Kidd  Bench features the EIrving Brothers (Julius and Kyrie), Paul Pierce, Mutombo and Deron Williams"
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Rick Barry, Kevin Durant, Wilt Chamberlain"
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Rick Barry  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Wilt  This is a top 3 team league wide IMO
"it looks clearly worse from a defensive standpoint. Its seriously overrating steals, Stockton posts 3.7 dbpm, while Hakeems best seasons are at 4.0. That just doesnt make any sense.   Curry posts 1.7 dbpm in his mvp seasons because he gets a lot of steals on the best defense in the league. Thats higher than all but 4 of scottie pippens best defensive numbers. Its clearly broken for defense.   From APM, and rapm, the best we've seen people put up defensively is around +5. Basically nobody is putting up those numbers anymore, and all guards are putting up huge numbers randomly.   The new version of apm imo also seems to be overvaluing scoring a bit. I mean it has Kevin Love as a top 20 all time offensive season in 2014. Do we really think that Love that season was better offensively than Larry birds best season.  I think the old formula seemed to track more closely to RAPM and APM. it had weird multipliers in it, but they tended to actually be predictive usually, but not perfect. Now BPM looks to track more closely with PER than the old BPM which looked more like a real +/- estimate. Like the reductions for getting a lot of assists with no rebounds, and rebounds with no assists seems weird, but they seem to typically point out players that don't contribute to good +/- numbers. Same thing with their defensive adjustments.   The assist to rebound synergy again was weird, but it seemed to pick up on great players like bird, lebron, harden, jokic, jordan, and rightfully downgraded guys like durant, carmelo, dominque, Westbrook broke that particular synergy, but imo for the most part it worked well in identifying high value creators for offense."
"I think there is a general point to be made here, but to only grab playoff statistics and ignore thousands of regular season data points seems like inaccurate way to make it. I completely agree that volume matters, but so does consistency over thousands of shots (because that's also volume).   For example, If we do this same exact exercise for Kevin Durant instead of Lebron, in the same exact year (2015), against the exact same team (GSW), we'll see KD's had a TS% of 44.9 in games where he shot 30+ attempts. In ZERO timelines would I believe Kevin Durant is a worse shooter than either MJ or Lebron, even if he never was a better player than them. TS with small sample sizes is nowhere near strong enough to simply throw-out the stockpiles of other data points on hand."
The only reason he has rings is because of some little unknown ball players by the names of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.
"**2004**  Nothing is guaranteed.  Plenty of great teams lose or choke or have chemistry issues at the last second.  Honestly, put almost any Finals team in a match up against one another and anyone can come out on top just due to pure talent alone.  Meanwhile, Shaq and Kobe beef was igniting and Karl Malone was way past his prime.  As for the Pistons?  My belief is that you need 4 All-Star caliber players (preferably with one or two superstars) and a deep bench to get to the Finals and win.  The Pistons had that.  ********************************************  **KD**  Kevin Durant is a very sensitive and emotionally insecure person.  We see this regarding his tweets about former teammates in OKC where he stated that his teammates just couldn't help him win like the Warriors could.  Thus, he felt that by acquiring championship rings, he could secure his legacy.  However, even after winning rings, he stated that he felt empty.  Then, there was some beef with Draymond and maybe a few others on that squad/franchise (like Kerr, perhaps, or the GM).  Why would KD return to that environment if he feels uncomfortable or threatened?  Furthermore, I also think KD doesn't know who he is or who he wants to be.  Upset at always being labeled a #2/second place his entire life, I think he is trying to compensate for that by creating an image of what he thinks would allow him to be accepted by everyone - legends, media, and fans alike.  Thus, he rushes off to join the Warriors to become a ""great one"" just like the players he idolized.  But then, he realizes that didn't help at all.  In fact, it might've hurt him.  And now, he rushes off to join a new team where he can carve his own legacy again."
"I’ll happily educate you. Theres plenty of evolution happening outside of your singleminded view of the word “evolution”. Just to talk about genetics specifically for you, aside from the fact that players are larger, the giant players can now do things they never could before (see giannis antetekoumpo, Kevin Durant) The players that could shoot the ball well to win championships in the 90’s (see Kerr winning the championship for MJ) now have crazy athleticism (kyrie Irving for example). Etc etc etc"
Comparing Jordan to LeBron would mean that:  Kobe got HIV in 2009    Dirk was stuck in the German league until he was old and slow    Kevin Garnett blew his back out working on his mom’s driveway.   Durant ODs on draft night
"absolutely no disrespect to Vince, but at his Peak Melo was a scoring title from Kevin Durant and carrying a team with a PG that LITERALLY DIDNT SCORE THE FINAL 3 WEEKS OF HIS CAREER (Jason Kidd) to the playoffs"
"Because circumstances can dictate career accolades whereas talent with a basketball is independent of the team/era. Kevin Durant was an amazing scorer on OKC. Still couldn’t win. He didn’t magically become better on Golden State to win - but that did change how his career was viewed. On the other hand, Allen Iverson‘s impact went far beyond his career, due to his style and cultural success. He could be seen as a greater player in basketball history compared to his career success because he changed the way the game was seen in pop culture.  People who want “greatest vs best” just want a way to filter those circumstances out of the picture as much as possible. It’s another way of saying, “looking back at basketball history, this player was more successful. However, in an all-time draft, I’d take this other guy.” That’s perfectly valid logic to use and “greater vs better” is just a way to distinguish the two trains of thoughts."
Ever seen live is more interesting. Mine would be   1. Kobe Bryant   2. Kevin Durant  3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Russell Westbrook  5. Nikola Jokic  6. Blake Griffin  7. Deron Williams  8. James Harden  9. Pau Gasol  10. DeAndre Jordan
Kevin Durant
"Durant. And I know that’s a crazy answer.   But he always goes out and performs when people trash talk him. Beverly is an obvious example. Him coming back to OKC is another.   “You know who I always thought [was a great trash-talker], but has been under the radar? I think Kevin Durant,” Green said during an appearance on ESPN Radio's ""The Freddie Coleman Show"" on Tuesday. “Lotta people don’t know that. But if you play against him, you know."" Green went on to explain, “KD makes you feel bad about yourself, that you ever talked junk. It’s the funniest thing in the world."" “When he end up with 53 [points], it ain’t much you could say back at that point."" (2015)  Here’s him and Dwade back in 2014:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivj4AVVuj6M"
"Yeah but the issue is that the east is horrible and has been for a long time now. The trio in Boston started to dwindle after the championship run in 2008. They were still amazing up until 2011. Major reason being that they were old. This left the young vibrant trio in Miami to do what they were expected to do.  I give LeBron credit In 2007 when he took that horrible squad to face the spurs at the tender age of 21, anybody who says he was swept and sucks is a hater. That LeBron was amazing and he did it alone too. His whole team which had several vets just vanished. He got the jitters and was nervous. I don't think Any superstar was in the position. He was in back in 2007. Kobe had Shaq, Dwade had Shaq, Jordan had pippen and amazing role players, magic had Kareem, bird had mchale, parish, Johnson and ainge, the dream had drexler and amazing sharpshooters like kenny Smith and cassell.    The loss to Mavs 2011 to spurs in 2014, the loss to warriors in 2015, the loss to warriors in 2017 were inexcusable. I excuse the loss in 2018 because he had a bunch of scrubs apart from Kevin love. They literally scraped together a team of below average role players to help him in the 2018 playoffs. He proved once again how weak the east was.   Overall LeBron is nothing like Jordan because Kobe achieved that.   LeBron is so much like magic it's not even funny. Apart from the difference in their finals appearances. They play so similar. In the last couple years LeBron has literally become a de facto point forward.   You can tell he was trying to be like Jordan but his mentality and game was never like that. Kobe had that obsessive competitive drive to win like Jordan. LeBron had the ambition but he didn't have the psychopathic obsession for competition like those two.   The media is to blame for this too. They've been uttering those words ""the next Jordan"" since 1994. First it was penny, then Kobe, then LeBron.    Now that LeBron is retiring, the narrative is being pushed. ""The next Jordan or the next Kobe"" I've heard Jimmy butler's name come up a few times. Honestly Jimmy butler is a perfect number 2. He always displays himself as having a crazy mindset and working out at 4am etc. He clashed with KAT in Minnesota, I get that. He then clashed with the Sixers lockeroom. That was uncalled for. Philadelphia need a push but he didn't push them, he just acted arrogantly and became a shitty teammate. That dude is far from Jordan and Kobe. He even clashed with wade back in Chicago. Jordan or Kobe tried competing with vets and learn from them.   I seriously think he is overrated and tries way too hard to bring the narrative to his backyard. Criticizing your fellow players because they are ""lazy""?   Dude you workout and do drills at 4am bit have nothing to show for it? Kawhi should've never gotten the chance to shoot that shot lol. Kyrie is another fluke who they try to attribute to Kobe. That guy is not a leader at all. Durant will return but not the player he once was. Their ventures in Brooklyn will be plagued with egos and emotional pettiness. KD will eventually return to OKC to retire, he will end his career similar to that of Kevin Garnett. Kyrie will probably stay in Brooklyn for the remainder of his career, I see him ending up like AI. Franchise will just get him for tickets and nothing else. Other places won't want him because of his toxicity.   I really think Russ and Harden will get a ring as soon as they get a coach who better utilizes their skills and finally gets a big man to get boards. D'antoni really needs to get on with his defense, this is why he's failed so much with phoenix. That playing style can only get you so far"

"This was a truly magical moment.  Growing up as a HUGE basketball fan from Oklahoma. praying and hoping we can somehow get an NBA team. We get one through sheer happenstance, knowing full well we probably won’t be very good.   Draft Kevin Durant, draft Russell Westbrook, then draft our ginobili esque 6th man in Harden. In only 3 seasons (?!?) we’re going toe-to-toe with fucking KOBE and the LAKERS in the Playoffs?!?   I remember where I was for almost every game of that 2012 run. ‘Magical’ is the only way I know how to describe it, because a meteoric rise like that just doesn’t happen in professional sports.

"I notice you ignored the Spurs example. Perhaps because you know this same argument can be applied to their runs.   &gt;The 1990 Bulls had a chance to beat them. The 1989 team didn’t.  They literally had a chance to beat them dude. Game 6 was decided by 9 points.   &gt;The Rockets in 2019 were way worse than 2018  The Warriors didn't have Kevin Durant to close game 5 and all of game 6, on the road.   &gt;I’m not gonna lament the loss of a role player like Iguodala  but you will lament this   &gt;The team lost two of their best wing defenders in Arica and Mbah a Moute (who was also useless in 2018 ‘cause of his busted shoulder).  Iguodala was a foundational part of the Warriors death lineup.  Have already referenced Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, one of which the league MVP, as injuries in a single postseason run. As opposed to you conflating multiple runs together. Also Pippen, Bucks leading scorer and Paul Pressey.   &gt;Yeah, sorry I didn’t mention Curry’s injury against low 40 win teams in 2016 that later on weren’t even bad enough to keep him out of the WCF or Finals.  Yet you did mention injuries to teams that you admit wouldn't have beat the Warriors. Interesting how that works."
"Pretty sure the Celtics with a healthy Bird had a chance of beating Detroit in the playoffs as did the Bulls if Scottie had not been hurt, in addition to the Lakers. You probably don't remember Scottie suffering from a migraine in that game 7 against the Pistons. You'd be using this as an instance of luck if it suited your narrative.  If you're going to mention the Bulls losing to the Pistons the next year, you should probably mention the Warriors without Kevin Durant closing out the Rockets the next year. But you won't do that as you aren't interested in arguing in good faith. You also won't mention Iguodala getting hurt in the Houston series two games prior Paul being out for the series. You also won't mention Durant or Curry's respective injuries during the run.  Would you like to list all the ways the San Antonio Spurs have been lucky. Since you seem to be so interested in detailing such things and ignoring other examples."

The Kevin Wayne Durant Company presents the Kevin Durant documentary starring Kevin Durant. Directed and Produced by Kevin Durant. Durant will also do his own stunts.
1.	James Harden is a better isolation scorer than Kevin Durant
"He was a great scorer, honestly he would probably be a little better if he played today, he could play 3 or 4 and shot a high volume of 3's at good efficiency.   As far as rankings go, let's do it by tiers.  **Players who are absolutely better**  Lebron, Bird, Kevin Durant, Dr. J, Elgin Baylor, Scottie Pippen, Rick Barry, John Havliciek, Kawhi (some might debate this cuz of longevity, but his peak has FAR surpassed Pierce)  So that's 9  **Players who are probably better**  Dominique Wilkins,  James Worthy   **Players who are arguably better**  Carmelo Anthony, Paul George (this might be controversial, but I'm prepared to debate it), Adrian Dantley (his individual stats are pretty incredible, but his style of play wasn't that conducive to a good offense), Alex English  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah, for me I think he would fall right outside of my top 10.  I'd probably put him above the players in the third tier."
"He has a way of trying to shape narratives to include him.  Kevin Durant gets kids together for some flag football, LeBron adds himself by @KD.  Kobe dies; youdve thought the two of them were best friends. Don’t get me started on that scripted speech during the funeral where he tosses down the paper...as if he hadn’t to plan to do so anyway.   He didn’t  become vocal about certain things in the community ‘until’ after it becomes cool to do so.   It’s like “ me me me”. He talks—a lot, but Michael Jordan didn’t have to say anything. Never referred to himself as The Goat.   He’s done a lot and had done a great many things for his community, but damn, yes, he comes across the same way as a politician who has to kiss an ugly child."
"You do bring up a good point that Reinsdorf’s had several championships early in his tenure. However, I think the championships had more to do with lucking into a Draft spot where we picked a once-in-a-lifetime player than it had anything to do with Reinsdorf’s ownership. You can list out all of the championships, but he’s proven to be a cheap owner who valued his own bottom line (and the friends he put into GM positions) over the morale of his own team, even during the most successful years. It feels as though the team succeeded in spite of him rather than because of him. He’s gone on record to say that he’d trade every single one of those championships for a World Series.   I’d say Joe Lacob’s proven to maintain a dynasty, though it wasn’t decades-long due to injuries (there were chemistry issues towards the end but I think the injuries handicapped their ability to team build in the aftermath of the Playoffs). Steve Ballmer’s shown that he wants to build a contending roster and put enough money into a new building to get his own team out of the shadow one of the most storied franchises in the league. Joseph Tsai (again, HK comments notwithstanding) installed a great GM who turned a roster ransacked by Danny Ainge into a likable 6th seed and then into Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. They all haven’t been around long, but the team-building and willingness to pony up for the expense of actually building these teams says to me that they care, which is a lot more than I can say for Jerry Reinsdorf."
"Responding to OPs OKC point, you know what’s worse than mishandling Harden? Drafting Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook then having the whole team moved.  I don’t care if it’s technically the same franchise."
A good amount of people viewed Russ as better than KD that year.   [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/russell-westbrook-wasnt-supposed-to-get-better-than-kevin-durant/)
They had a pretty good shot when Kevin Durant went out last postseason.
"If you stuck Lebron James. Kevin Durant, James Harden, Steph Curry, etc with their current skillsets and thei primes in the 8-'s and 90's they'd absolutely dominate that era maybe even better than how they're dominating now because the wings and guards of that era simply would not be able to guard someone like KD, Harden, or Lebron one on one. It would be damn near impossible. Just no one from that era is long enough, athletic enough, and has the speed to do it. Can you imagine PF's guarding KD's walk up three-pointers and mid-range shots? He'd gas out those guys by the third quarter.  I also love how Jay brings up the 60's and mentions no one in sports media states that the best player of the 80's or 90's wouldn't be able to compete in the 60's."

"Yeah I think Tyson Chandler has had a good enough career to justify taking him second overall, I think people get too enamored with like the Kevin Durant type second overall picks, I mean every pick isn’t going to be home run superstar, you get a good solid NBA player with any draft pick most teams would sign up for that."
They touched the basketball at the same time and their powers switched. I've seen a documentary about stuff like that happening featuring Kevin Durant
1. LeBron James   2. Kawhi Leonard   3. Steph Curry   4. Giannis Antetokounmpo   5. James Harden  HM: Kevin Durant
"I think it's feasible that if Ray Allen misses that shot NBA history is changed completely. The Spurs played better in 2014 than their roster had any right to, and I think that was at least partially because they wanted to avenge their loss. If they don't have that to motivate them, who's to say that a team like the Thundwer don't win the West? I think the 2014 Heat beat those Thunder, and then boom, LeBron's got his championship back. Then, does LeBron leave in 2014. Is Wiggins a Cav? Is Kevin Love on the Heat, the Bulls, or even the Warriors? If Kevin Durant ends up beating LeBron in those 2014 finals, does he ever leave? If he doesn't, that's the elimination of LeBron's biggest championship obstacle over the next few years. Even if the Spurs win both years, I think it's safe to wonder whether LeBron would've left with only 1 championship. It's not unfeasible that if Ray Allen misses that shot, he ends up with more championships than he has now. That's why it's tough to think about a hypothetical like this. That shot was a domino moment"
"I think MJ, Kobe, lbj are all goats in their own right. However, i find it hilarious that people on this sub who are ""educated"" on ball talk about Kobe not being a top 5 player of all time. Especially when most the athletes THEMSELVES put kobe in their top 5 if not top 3 if not #2 overall. Im talking about guys like Kevin Durant who make statements like these.    In all the smoke they ask all the stars their opinions on this very debate and a lot of them rank kobe over lebron. Even if hes not, hes in their top 3 all the time. People in this sub be crazy w the kobe talk."
"bruh, if you wanna give LeBron credit for knocking out HoF Shaq at age 38, then maybe you should criticize LeBron for not being able to win with a HoF Shaq at age 37 when they were teammates.   Shaquille O'Neal **- aged 38**   Tracy McGrady **- shell at 33**   Jason Kidd   Chauncey Billups   Vince Carter   Allen Iverson **- never happened**   Kevin Durant   James Harden **- pre-breakout**   Russel Westbrook   Steph Curry   Klay Thompson   Draymond Green   Andre Iguodala **- ain't HoF**   Kevin Garnett   Paul Pierce   Ray Allen   Kyrie Irving **- never happened**   Kahwi Leonard   Tim Duncan   Giannis Antetokounmpo **- never happened**"
You seriously got issues if your banner says Kevin Durant (GSW) lmao the guy is one of the best players to ever live and he joined a 73 win team. Kevin Durant is a pathetic bitch and anyone who still likes him after he went to Golden State (you) is probably a front-running bitch
Kevin Durant left a great team to join the best regular season team of all time.   Lebron left a terrible team to join a great team.   It’s pretty simple dude.
They were though? Kevin Durant was in his 5th year in the league and both Harden and Russ were still on their rookie contracts? KD was what 24 at the time?
Did Boby Meyers have a feeling Kevin Durant was about to leave?
"This perfectly describes how frustrating it must be for opposing teams to deal with Harden. It's not that he's ""unguardable"", it's that he's a master at drawing fouls and making unnecessary contact. There are many better shooters in the league that have faster release, better handles, and greater accuracy.   Players like Steph don't need the double step back, they can do the standard single step back and get the shot in. The thing about Harden is that if you get too close to guard his double step back, he's going to flop on you on his way down, it's practically built into his shooting form. Next thing you know, you're already in foul trouble because the next possession, he eurosteps into you on a drive.      If you watch videos of players being asked who the hardest person to guard is, they say Steph Curry, or LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving. It's not hard to guard Harden, it's just hard to do it without getting called for a bullshit foul."
"Michael ""Kevin Durant"" Jordan.  Two best scorers ever both have that killer mentality. Respect."
He was a big loss because he’s Kevin Durant but their team was still really good
Kevin Durant has joined the chat
"I got the warriors. Best team ever assembled. Not a knock on any of the other great teams, simply just not fair that a 73-9 win team the year before essentially got to replace Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant and keep their depth.  I honestly don’t know if one team will have this much talent on it again in my lifetime."
"Bro are you serious, just look up pictures of Scottie and KD, KD may have the weight advantage, but its really more like 6'8 225 vs 6'11 240, 15 lb weight advantage.. but KD [is thin as bricks](https://mddailyrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kevin-Durant-Net-Worth.jpg) while Scottie was [not](https://celebvogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Scottie-Pippen.jpg).  I'd say it's up to debate how well they would play against each other but to just say that KD would be guarding him with a 30 lb advantage and that players are so much stronger today.. nah cuz."
"James Harden averaged 36 ONE season, and he was jacking 13 threes a game.  Jordan could never shoot threes a the efficiency Harden did at ANY volume, let alone 13 per.  And if you think Jordan could uptick his averages by 50% from 30-32 in his winning years to 45, you must also believe Kevin Durant would struggle to crack 20 ppg since the reverse must also be true.  Not to mention apparently Dominique Wilkins and Clyde Drexler are going for 40 in this era as well"
"Why not ...   “With the second selection of the 2007 NBA Draft, the Seattle SuperSonics select Kevin Durant ...”"
"Do you ever get tired of making terrible anti-LeBron arguments? There are a couple of actual good ones, you know.   &gt;  How many times must we set a talented big like Bosh and K Love be relegated to a spot up shooter like they're Channing Frye?  Who gives a single fuck? It's amazing how we're in 2020 and there are still people who don't understand the importance of spacing. Their shooting skills were used to great effect. LeBron's teams were always among the best postseason offenses and often played many top ten defensive teams in the playoffs. Cleveland literally had the highest postseason offensive rating of all time in 2017.   Do you think Kevin Love post-ups would have helped them beat the Durant Warriors in 2017 or 2018? LMFAO. Maybe the 2018 Cavaliers coulda beaten the Warriors if JR Smith had an opportunity to handle the ball more. Offense was not the issue on either of those teams, it was a combo of the Warriors being totally stacked and Cleveland's poor defense.   &gt; why his teams were almost always near the top in the league in assists and brons teams are mid pack  Hilarious how you use fucking APG as a measure of offensive success instead of offensive rating. I wonder why.  &gt; Bron couldn't get away from Spos offense fast enough and hated Blatts ball movmer heavy playbook  Miami's offenses were literally always good. The Cavaliers had the best playoff offenses in the league in both 2016 and 2017 (including the highest playoff offensive rating ever in 2017)."
"Chris Paul, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton and CJ McCollum are probably the five best."
"Chris Paul, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard are all phenomenal mid range shooters. Of course all shoot the three in the 37-38 % range, so maybe that's something Jordan would try and develop more if he played in the modern era."
"He makes some decent points at the end, but mostly stupid points throughout.  &gt; Jordan inspired the next generation of players to play like him and changed the game forever. There’s an alternate universe where LeBron and Durant and Giannis would be forced to spend their careers on the low block... Dirk Nowitzki’s father was a professional handball player. Maybe Dirk would have been like him if the NBA hadn’t exploded the way it did thanks to Michael.  &gt; We all stand on the shoulders of giants. It doesn’t matter whether Isaac Newton was a greater scientist than Albert Einstein—Einstein couldn’t have existed without him.  That is good perspective.  &gt; Jordan was never a prolific 3-point shooter, averaging just 1.7 attempts per game over his career and shooting a pedestrian 32.7 percent.  LeBron takes more attempts but shoots 34.4% for his career, and the exact same 33.2% in the playoffs. League average is also about 3% higher.  &gt; It’s also a response to the rule changes of the early 2000s that gave defenses the ability to run zones and play farther off of offensive players than ever before. The best defenses of the past decade would have been illegal in the 1990s.  Offenses are way more OP than defenses nowadays.  During Jordan's prime, league average ORtg was 108 and TS% was 53-54%. The last 2 years, league average ORtg is 110 and TS% is 56%.  If you surrounded him with the same type of shooting that players have today, his and his team's offensive stats would go up, not down because of freer defensive rules.  &gt; But opponents would be able to force Jordan to be a passer in ways they weren’t allowed to in his prime. Anytime that 2020 Jordan were to play with a nonshooter, that player’s defender would clog the lane and force him to give up the ball.  Jordan wasn't a non-passer. In fact, he was a really good passer who averaged 6 apg for his playoff career despite playing in the triangle rather than his team running the offense through him. When they did run it through him in 1989, he averaged 31/8/9 (with less than 4 turnovers) for over half a season.  &gt; LeBron James (6-foot-9 and 250 pounds), Kevin Durant (6-foot-10, 240 pounds), and Giannis Antetokounmpo (6-foot-11, 240 pounds)? The question isn’t whether LeBron would be tough enough to survive his own version of the Jordan Rules. It’s whether they would even work against someone who weighs almost 300 pounds.  240 and 250 isn't ""almost 300 pounds."" They're bigger but you don't need to exaggerate to prove a point.  The Jordan Rules wasn't just hand-checking, it was a zone defense plus midair flagrant fouls. The Raptors shut down Giannis running a similar zone, except they at least played him clean rather than trying to injure him like Laimbeer would.  &gt; Jordan (6-foot-6 and 195 pounds) and Pippen (6-foot-8 and 210 pounds) terrorized a generation of smaller, slower perimeter players. You know what they would be to a 7-footer with a turnaround jumper? Chairs.  That was what they weighed early in their careers. Giannis weighed 196 at his Combine. In their primes, Jordan was listed 216 and Pippen was listed 228. And they'd probably be bigger today, everyone carries more muscle on their frames.  &gt; Williams: I always have these debates with my friends. Can you imagine dropping LeBron in 1975? He would win 15 championships in a row.  If LeBron stepped into a time machine onto a 1975 court, yeah, he'd win 15 championships in a row. He's benefited from a ton of advances in training, medicine, equipment, etc in the 45 years since then. Not to mention getting to watch the greats since then and model his game after them (the author's good point about Einstein and Newton).  If you put baby LeBron in a time machine and had him born in 1955, he would probably just be one of several greats defining that era, along with Kareem, Moses, Dr J, and eventually Bird and Magic. Maybe he'd still be the best among them, but he wouldn't win even 5 in a row, let alone 15."
"Russell, Chamberlain, Baylor, Robertson, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Jordan, Hakeem, Kobe, Duncan, Lebron ...  Shaq is  top 15 if you think he's better than Jerry West, Dr. J, Charles Barkley, and Kevin Durant. He probably is better than Barkley and maybe Durant, but other two are tough. Either way, he's definitely not Top-10."
Kevin Durant
"I'm not alighting anyone. They won two in a row, and three in four years. However, I want to slight then because with Kevin Durant they were basically cheat codes and stupid."
"That is the strategy that the Rockets prescribe to. Most teams recognize that there is value in the midrange and even though a healthy offensive team in the modern NBA will not be able to function by taking mountains of inefficient shots in that area, players like Chris Paul and Kevin Durant have shown us that the best midrange shooters are capable of opening up the floor with their shooting threat from the elbows.   Drop coverage is extremely popular in the modern NBA, but really good midrange shooters can abuse that style of defense and that will end up pulling the big man away from the paint opening up driving angles and lobs for his teammates. Basketball isn't played in a vacuum, and the Rocket's unwillingness to ever shoot a midrange shot is the reason they've only ever lead the league in offensive rating once. Defenses don't have to cover it, so their hesitation to shoot in the midrange can blow up plays sometimes.  But teams have always been running similar routes to get their roleplayers open looks, just look at the 2013-14 Spurs that you were talking about. That team was all about finding a teammate for an easy layup on a dump near the rim, or hitting a teammate open in the corner. The only difference is that now, players will shoot the open three wherever they get it instead of attacking every closeout they can to extend advantages like the Spurs did.  And here, just look at the Houston Rockets. Every year they become more and more focused on only hitting threes to the point that they're actually starting to hurt themselves. Their offensive rating peaked in 2017-18, and it's been declining ever since because that style of play isn't sustainable, and is it any wonder that their stagnation and decline in ortg goes hand in hand with CP3's timeline with the Rockets? Good midrange scorers are on present on almost every good offensive team, the Clippers have Kawhi, Lakers have AD and LeBron, Celtics have Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward, the Heat have Jimmy Butler, the Bucks have Khris Middleton etc. Good teams have good midrange scorers because they recognize the value that they bring to the table. An open three and an open layup are the two best shots to take in basketball, but teams aren't stupid as to how to generate those looks.  Stylistically a lot of teams have taken a page out of the Spurs' book, and even though they don't have a star like Tim Duncan who exclusively scored in the midrange and on post ups I don't think the style that dominated the early 2010s ever left. It just became modernized."
"&gt; Brooklyn Nets: Kevin Garnett, Julius Erving (ABA). Would be Kevin Durant next season  I love KG to death, but he has no business here lol. Jason Kidd, my man. Jason Kidd.  EDIT: My bad, I've misconstrued your point of this post. Jason Kidd still deserves mention though."
"Who cares who went to who? When they played together on the same team, who was the lead dog?   SPOILER ALERT: It was that snake Kevin Durant."
People will forget how great Kevin Durant really is just because of the controversy surrounding his internet persona and his move to the Warriors.
"I really don’t think it’s that simple, my dad watched Jordan live at UNC and he says one of the most impressive things about Lebron is his longevity and thinks he’s better than Jordan. Lebron also had to play the best team of all time and then they added Kevin Durant, so it’s not as black and white as if you watched Jordan play you think he is better."
Kevin Durant. Steph Curry. Tim Duncan. Dirk Nowitzki. Dwight Howard. Kevin Garnett.   All of these names are Hall of Famers. All of them got past LeBron.

"The league literally had a height crackdown last year to get accurate data idk why you’re so willing to trust the listed heights.  Also, [read this about KDs height](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/warriors-forward-kevin-durant-finally-reveals-his-true-height)   And when the NBA measured KD this year, he was at 6’10 without shoes, which would put him at 6’11 with shoes. That’s closer to 7’ than the 6’9 height he was listed at for years."
It’s just to show the depth kawhi left in Toronto. I don’t think it was impossible for kawhi to make a wrong choice bball wise. Personally he obviously made the right call since LA is home. But he sacrificed leaving a better team.   Going to the lakers would’ve just made him another Kevin Durant. Noone would value his chips.
"Kevin Durant 2009 season: 30/7/3  Steph unanimous MVP season season : 30/5/7  Kevin Durant 2013 season : 32/8/5  There isn't a lot between those numbers, statistically it's quite similar. Maybe I phrased it poorly, personally I felt Steph's MVP season was a bit better because he sat loads of 4th quarters out and it marked a distinct shift in the way the game was played but the gap isn't huge, KD's right up there with him."
People will probably think that the 2017 &amp; 2018 Warriors were led by Kevin Durant instead of Steph Curry because of the FMVP’s.
"Removing Jordan gives extra MVPs to the following players:  1988 - Larry Bird (now has 4, which consists of 4 in 5 years)  1991 - Magic Johnson (now has 4, which consists of 4 in 5 years)  1992 - Clyde Drexler (now has 1)  1996 - David Robinson (now has 2, won in back to back years)  1998 - Karl Malone (now has 3, which consists of 3 in a row)  NBA Finals Matchups:  1991 - Lakers vs. Pistons. Likely the Lakers win, giving a 6th ring to Magic Johnson.  1992 - ECF of Knicks vs. Cavaliers which could go either way, followed by Finals of Knicks/Cavaliers vs. Trailblazers. Portland likely wins which gives Drexler a ""best player"" ring in addition to the one with the Rockets later.  1993 - Suns vs. Knicks. Really a tossup. No idea how that ones goes. The Suns have home court but the Knicks were really rolling. Offensive juggernaut vs. a Defensive powerhouse. Tough Series to predict.  1996 - Sonics vs. Magic. Likely the Sonics win. Great for the legacies of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp.  1997 - Jazz vs. Heat. Jazz likely win.  1998 - Jazz vs. Pacers. Jazz likely win.   A world where Karl Malone wins three straight MVPs and leads the Jazz to the Championship in two of those seasons is likely the biggest beneficiary as he becomes the undisputed dominant player of the late 1990s. Magic Johnson with another MVP and Finals win is certainly elevated as four MVPs and 6 Championships likely moves him ahead of Kareem in consensus all time ranks. One of Barkley or Ewing would have gotten a ring as well. But I think the biggest beneficiary is Malone. Maybe not GOAT of an entire generation but at least of a partial generation.  Removing LeBron gives MVP to the following players:  2009 - Kobe Bryant (now has 2, won in back to back years)  2010, 2012 and 2013 - all to Kevin Durant (now has 4, which consists of 4 in 5 years)   Finals (removing the ones where LeBron's team lost, I think for each we can safely assume the actual Champion defeats whomever comes out of the East in LeBron's team's place)  2012 - Thunder vs. Celtics - Thunder win this, giving Durant a ""controversial-free"" championship as the best player on his original franchise (note on Durant, I'm not going to speculate on a ripple effect on whether he still signs with GSW in this world, let's assume for the sake of things that he does.)  2013 - Spurs vs. Pacers. Spurs take this one, giving Tim Duncan a 6th career ring and Kawhi Leonard a third career ring (breakout Playoffs in 2013 gets a bit more attention).  2016 - Warriors vs. Raptors, should be a Warriors win. With 73 now capped with a Ring, that certainly elevates that season into being considered greater than the following 67 and 16-1 team, even with the 7 game push by the Thunder the series before. The Warriors now win 4 straight Championships between 2015-2019, becoming the first team to do since the 1960s.  Kobe Bryant gets a boost with back to back MVPs including in a year where he won the title cementing him as the best player without question of the late 2000s. Steph Curry has the 4 straight titles which shoots him way up since nobody has done that in the modern era. An extra ring for Duncan and Kawhi is obviously great. But the biggest beneficiary has to be Kevin Durant. With 4 MVPs and 3 Championships/Finals MVPs, he is the undisputed best player of the 2010s. Adding in the scoring titles, possibly not enough in the Advanced Stat department to be a consensus ""GOAT"" pick but certainly he's comfortably in the Top 10 and arguably Top 5 at that point."
"Kevin Durant made a move that no one respected, including the people who facilitated the move. That's just delicious."
"Imo there is a bunch of players that should already be in the Hall of Fame (in no particular order): - Chris Webber - Shawn Kemp - Ben Wallace - Dikembe Mutombo  - Chauncey Billups - Tim Hardaway  - Mark Price - Kevin Johnson - Mark Jackson  - Toni Kukoc - Shawn Marion  And among recently retired or even active players (in no particular order): - LeBron James  - Dirk Nowitzki  - Kevin Durant  - Stephen Curry  - Dwyane Wade - Tony Parker - Manu Ginobili  - Pau Gasol - Chris Paul  - James Harden - Russell Westbrook  - Dwight Howard  - Carmelo Anthony  - Vince Carter  If Mitch Richmond is a member of the Hall of Fame, then the aforementioned players must also be enshrined there."
A healthy Kevin Durant could do it. Can't wait to see him on the court again
"Kevin Durant. Also, I’m pretty sure you’ve done this same thread like multiple times but keep deleting it and reposting weekly."
"Yeah out of their 3 championships, 1 had no Love/Kyrie and the other 2 needed Kevin Durant. Obviously the Warriors aren't a bad team, but a lot of sports voodoo had to happen for those championships.  It's not often 2 of the other team's Big 3 are missing in the finals and its even more rare when one of the top players in the league joins an already stacked team."
"except for the fact that Curry's team beat Durant's team the last time they played against each other. and the additional fact that all the teams, including the Rockets and the Cavs, prepare their game strategies to stop Curry as their first priority. that's why Durant had so many open looks in the finals!

"They lost Kevin Durant to the Nets, Steph Curry had a broken hand and missed the majority of the season, and Klay Thompson has been injured since the finals last year."

"Wilt (on here), Kevin Durant (I see him within the top-15 range a lot, and I think he’s more top 18-23 range.), Dirk (he was worse than KG.) I can’t name many more who I can say are generally overrated here."
"That’s a difficult shot to make. Kevin Durant is 7 feet tall and is gonna be able to make the percent chance of a quick put back very low. Remember that rebound was a difficult one to secure, so he’d likely be tipping it in or forcing up a shot no one practices. There was 5 people, and no one on LeBron."
"I don’t think the signing thread you posted is universal praise at all?

"B is Carmelo Anthony (low stls/blks/asts)  C is Gordon Hayward  D is Kawhi Leonard (2nd highest in both steals &amp; blk avg amongst the list)  E is 100% Kevin Durant (30+ ppg, KD and LeBron are the only recent SF to do this)  G is 100% LeBron James (high assists avg a giveaway)  I is Paul George (high steals avg)  J is Paul Pierce"

"Kevin Durant. Kobe admitted he wasn't able to figure out how to guard him, and KD's pretty weasel-like."
"This is definitely not a travel unless his right foot touched the ground at the end before shooting, which it doesn’t appear to  You know why every player doesn’t do this? Because they’re not Kevin Durant or Giannis aka the only 7 footers in the world who can do it at a crazy height. Euro steps aren’t as effective for smaller players"
"&gt;Im not sure camera quality makes the game appear faster..do you have any evidence to backup this assertion?  It's an anecdotal thing. If you watch old game footage, a lot of the time it just appears slower. Maybe because it's just not clear. I don't know how else to explain it.   &gt;This has nothing to do with the speed of the athletes but more to do with the number of possessions per game. This can be influenced by the number of missed field goals (for example the 60s had the highest pace, but that is because they missed more shots hence more extra possessions).  I know. I didn't say athletes back then were just as fast.   &gt;Apologies for misquoting you. But if you say the average player is better now then what makes you think Bird would be dominant now when he is playing against a raised floor for a replacement level player? Wouldnt improved competition in terms of bigger/faster players impact his production?  He is playing against a better competition but part of that better competition is because nutrition, training, supplements, etc. are all more advanced now. Players are focused on shooting more 3's and post play is considered inefficient. Larry Bird didn't have those advantages. Larry would get to benefit from these things if we move him to today's era. Keep in mind he was still doing great with a fucked back. Today, his back would never get fucked.   Also, today's era is great for players like Larry Bird. He would benefit from the spacing today. And teams would love to have a big guy that can shoot and playmake like him.   &gt;I imagine you envision him being used as a stretch four. You also envision him being an above average 3 point shooter on decent volume. I wonder why you think a player who shot 37% on 1.9 attempts per game would all of a sudden shoot around the same % on say 7 attempts per game.  37% in an era where he didn't need to practice threes, and when the spacing was abysmal. He was an elite free throw shooter and mid-range shooter. If he's brought up in this era, his shooting would skyrocket. He certainly has the touch for it. He wouldn't merely be a stretch four either. Jokic is a top 7 player right now and Bird is more athletic, a better defender, comparable 3 point shooter (yea Jokic 3p% haven't been very good), and comparable passer. Bird can play a similar role even if he's not a great 3 point shooter altho he probably would be.   &gt;I have provided my video evidence so now you show me yours. Provide me a video of those guys dribbling where their hand placement on the ball is significantly different from Isaih's. This is actually majoring in the minor because the average dribbles per game per player is a lot lower now. Players attack more off the catch now than they do pounding the ball in iso situations so choosing ""more carrying"" as the hill to die on is particularly strange.   It's not a hill I'm dying on. In lot of highlights of players today, you'll see them do a lot of fancy shit which justifiably does make them look better than older era players if you ignore context. I'm just saying that Larry didn't have that freedom of ball handling that players do today which is one way his highlights might not look as impressive as Kawhi's.   The gather step rule is enough evidence. It didn't exist in Larry's time. James Harden's stepback is a travel in the 80's. So is Kawhi, Giannis, and LeBron barreling to the rim.   [Here is Kawhi traveling (by 80s rules) on a gamewinner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChT3ewZXTfM)  [Isaiah Thomas carry compilation. In the comments, you'll see a lot of people saying ""Oh but everyone does it"" further proving my point.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpRZUazIurw)    &gt;Players like Kevin Durant, Giannis or Lebron arent particularly known as great ball handlers so how come they are the best now if palming the ball is such an offensive advantage? Oh and Larry would be allowed to palm the ball as well in this scenario so it would be a level playing field lol  Kevin Durant is known to be an extremely good ball handler for his position lol. People constantly praise his guard-like crossovers.   Giannis is a great ball handler for his position. So is LeBron James.   The reason they're the best is because they're fucking good at everything. I didn't say dribbling is a huge offensive advantage. I said the freedom of dribbling makes players look like better ball-handlers and more impressive than they actually are. I've seen people say Larry Bird could barely do a between the legs crossover. It's not his fault the rules were strict. You yourself said Kawhi's highlights look more impressive than Larry Bird's.   Yes, it would be a level playing field but it's not a level playing field if we're comparing the highlights of two different eras."
"Yeah but wigs instead of kevin fucking durant is such a gigantic difference. Im not saying they wont be a contender next year, I assume they will, im just saying they wont be the clear pick for the chip and they'll face some challenges on the playoffs."
"Kevin Durant is clear top 15 player of all time. Anyone who says otherwise is just a hater. He hasn’t broken into the top 10 yet, he’s in the same range as Hakeem, Moses Malone, Dr.J."
"&gt;I said camera quality. The game is so clear now, the FPS is higher, who the fuck said camera angles.  Im not sure camera quality makes the game appear faster..do you have any evidence to backup this assertion?  &gt;the pace of the 80s was as fast as it is now.   This has nothing to do with the speed of the athletes but more to do with the number of possessions per game. This can be influenced by the number of missed field goals (for example the 60s had the highest pace, but that is because they missed more shots hence more extra possessions).   &gt;Here's you being disingenuous again.When did I say the players back then are better? Im talking about just Bird.  Apologies for misquoting you. But if you say the average player is better now then what makes you think Bird would be dominant now when he is playing against a raised floor for a replacement level player? Wouldnt improved competition in terms of bigger/faster players impact his production?   &gt;I mean it has. But the game has changed to the point where someone like Larry Bird would fit in perfectly as a big shooter with amazing passing skills  I imagine you envision him being used as a stretch four. You also envision him being an above average 3 point shooter on decent volume. I wonder why you think a player who shot 37% on 1.9 attempts per game would all of a sudden shoot around the same % on say 7 attempts per game.   &gt;There is quite a difference lol  I have provided my video evidence so now you show me yours. Provide me a video of those guys dribbling where their hand placement on the ball is significantly different from Isaih's. This is actually majoring in the minor because the average dribbles per game per player is a lot lower now.

"Kevin Durant at the age of 23 beat Dirk, Kobe and Pau, and Tim Duncan, averaging 28.5 on 63TS. Sounds like you're a hater to me."
"Kevin Durant is absolutely not in the top 5, and even 10. He’s top 20 for sure though."
"That's true. I mean, Porzingis does have some abnormal ability to handle (there have been some plays where he murders a big with a double cross pull up in isolation like he's Kevin Durant, it's insane) and he's very mobile and fluid in his motion for a guy that's 7'3. And for the shooting I think what's most remarkable is how quick his release is for his size. Normally guys that tall will have slow, two motion shots because of their two-motion shots, but Porzingis looks like he's Klay Thompson. So yes, I do think he has some abnormal physical abilities for a guy his size and he could be seen as a unicorn. But if you don't think his physical traits are abnormal for his size, I understand and thus hor you he should not be called a unicorn."
"LeBron James/Michael Jordan/Kevin Durant/Hakeem Olajuwon/Shaq  Everybody can defend really well. Everybody can score. We have size, great shooting, toughness. Unbeatable"
"Congratulations, you just pissed of Kevin Durant who came to the Nets to play with his friends"
"im not even talking about the nba during the pandemic, its much worse during the season. its just the way the NBA markets itself, its honest to god becoming a biy of a soap opera.   ""tune in this week to see who Kevin Durant is throwing shade at now, in lakers news; are Lebron and A.D buddies off the court? All this after the 10,00th MJ vs Lebron GOAT debate""  Dont get me wrong theres no issue with the quality of the basketball, I just find the way the league is marketed to be tacky as hell"
It’s a lottery system though so a team that’s the 14th worst team (basically average) can get the 1st overall pick or a different top 4 pick.  Losing someone like Shaq or even Paul George/Kevin Durant/Chris Bosh is a huge loss and I don’t see how getting the 5th or 6th or 7th overall pick is too much compensation.  Way too many busts in the top 10 for the team to be getting a sure thing let alone another All-NBA talent.
"Yes, let's blame JR when he out rebounded Kevin Durant and George Hill missed the 2nd free throw, when Coach Ty Lue forgot to call a time out, when LeBron himself didn't call a timeout."
"Yeah but as good as Collins is, a that’s like 5 assists from trae every game. BI is like a Kevin Durant “scorer” while Collins is like Amare or some bigger guy who gets fed a lot of his touches instead of taking guys off the dribbles  Collins might score more points on higher percentages but it’s a different type of scorer"
"Kevin durant isn't the athlete Nate is.  Read that again.  Nate was able to rely on a absolutely nothing as an advantage as a pro player. His athletic ability is above most everyone who's ever played pro.  At that level of athletic prowess, yes I'd be inclined to believe adapting to a new sport or even being competent at it in a relatively short time would be reasonable.  Nate is the same type of animal as Bo Jackson.  No one would be surprised if Nate outperformed KD in baseball, football, soccer, boxing if both given same training. KD shines in basketball because of specificity of training and body type ontop of incredible talent. Nate can go from sport to sport - hes not relegated to specificity."
Yes that’s true but talents suited for the nba doesn’t guarantee transfer for anything else. Nba ≠ mma or any other sport for that matter. Kevin Durant is one of the best basketball players to ever live but have you seen the video of him attempting a pass rush? All I’m saying is nothing is guaranteed and being an great athlete definitely doesn’t guarantee that you are even a halfway decent fighter
"No. Add Giannis, Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, Bradley  Beal and 6th man Steph Curry and now we're talking."
So Zach Lavine got hall of fame basketball IQ to go with his shot and athleticism or Lauri Markkanen becane better Kevin Durant
"Firstly, where are you getting your numbers ? He had a 58% true shooting according to basketball reference.   Secondly, Im not ignoring it, I just think you're way over inflating how good he was offensively. He was a completely reliant scorer. He scored 18ppg on good, but not amazing efficiency, he only had an 18% usage and he was assisted on over 80% of his attempts (for reference curry was assisted on only 35% of his attempts in the finals). Iggy also had 30 or so wide open three point attempts thanks to curry commanding all the attention.   &gt;Either way, Curry's impact is undeniable. There is no GSW finals appearance, much less championship without him. Unfortunately for him, other players have seemed to step up (certainly more than him) in the finals, hence his lack of FMVPs.  I mean, I disagree, Igoudala definitely didn't step up *more* than curry. That's the entire point of the argument here.  Durant was better one year (but to be fair it's Durant lol) and the other year they were both fantastic and FMVP could have gone either way.   ""Certainly more than him"" also just seems to completely ignore all the context. Curry simply being on the court *allows* players to be better. Every single finals the Cavs defense (both when Durant was there and when he wasn't"" hinged on focusing on curry first, then everyone else. It's a testament to how incredible he is that they were letting *Kevin fucking Durant* of all people get open layups to run curry off the 3 point line in 2017."
"Before gsw got kd he took them to 6 games without kevin love and kyrie, he had dellavedova playing starter minutes. The next year he beat them with them back  They then add kevin fucking durant to an already all time great team, what is he supposed to do here? If u replace lebron with anyone else even jordan they still lose thats one of, actually THE BEST team ever created  I dont fault him for losing to those gsw teams at all, jordan would have lost aswell imo, kd fucked the league"
Stockton isn’t on the same level as Kevin Durant come on man. Stockton couldn’t be the best player on a finals team.
Not a hot take bruh this guy is wildin if he thinks John Stockton is better than Kevin Durant. I’d go so far to say delusional actually.
"One thing people overlook about kareem is he had a skinny build like kevin durant almost. Dude was 7’2 but only listed at 220 I believe, while KD is 6’10 240lbs according to google"
"Except that frequently doesn’t happen. Giannis, for example. Sits on a .500 team for years. Bottom ten defence. He’s putting up big numbers, 27/10/5 type shit, but the team success isn’t there. New coach comes in, a few great role players, all of a sudden he’s got the best record in the league and his stats *improve*.  Anthony Davis. Spends a few years putting up 28/11 for a Pelicans squad fluctuating between just mediocre and outright awful. Jumps into the first seed Lakers, as a second option no less, and his per 100 numbers are damn near identical.  Kevin Durant. Second year in the league, puts up 25/6/3 on an absolute garbage OKC squad. Year after that he puts up 30/8/3 and they win 50 games. Year after that they’re in the finals.  Trae Young’s basic stats say he’s an absolutely elite offensive talent who sucks at defence. And what do you know, RPM has him as easily the best offensive PG in the league this year. Booker and Beal are 3rd and 4th among shooting guards just behind Harden and Doncic. I’d say that just about lines up with their box scores too."
"I mean, KD has 1 less all star appearance, but more 1st team all NBA appearances, is a 4x scoring champ compared to Barkley's 1x rebound champ, and they're each 1 time MVPs. The scoring champions alone are pretty incredible and enough I'd have him ahead of Barkley, but by the time KD's have 3 or 4 more all star appearances it'll become even more clear, I think.  KD has also scored about 820 points less than Barkley did in his career, but in 8,625 minutes less. KD already has more blocks than him, again given that big discrepancy.   By per 36 right now, here's how they compare:  |Rk|Player|From|To|MP|FGA|FG%|3PA|3P%|FTA|FT%|ORB|DRB|TRB|AST|STL|BLK|TOV|PF|PTS| |-:|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:| |1|Charles Barkley*|1985|2000|39330|14.3|.541|1.8|.266|7.9|.735|3.9|7.6|11.5|3.9|1.5|0.8|3.1|3.0|21.7| |2|Kevin Durant|2008|2019|31305|18.2|.493|4.7|.381|7.5|.883|0.7|6.2|6.9|4.0|1.1|1.1|3.1|1.9|26.4|   Provided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.fcgi?request=1&amp;sum=1&amp;player_id1_hint=Charles+Barkley&amp;player_id1_select=Charles+Barkley&amp;y1=2000&amp;player_id1=barklch01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;y2=2019&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#stats-per_minute) Generated 5/31/2020.  I don't think he's clearly ahead of Barkley, but I think it's a pretty valid take to say he's already passed Barkley."
"You really think Kevin Durant thought to himself “I’ll fold this series before joining GSW this free agency even though I could easily beat their ass, win a ring, AND join them in free agency???”  Do people really think even if the Thunder won GSW wouldn’t be begging on their knees for KD to join like ever other fucking team In the league Including the mf cavs if they had the cap space  Cmon guys."
PG: CP3  SG: Cody Zeller  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Cody Zeller  C: Cody Zeller
What’s wrong with his Kevin Durant like frame?
"Bucks are a top 2 team in the league with an emerging all-time great so can't go wrong there.  Lakers are also a top 2 team. They have the 2nd best player ever in LeBron and a Top 7ish player Anthony Davis. Plus they're in LA, so they'll almost always have superstars.  There's the Dallas Mavericks who have Luka Doncic who is already one of the best players in his second year. They also have Kristaps Porzingis who is an exciting young player with potential.  Pelicans have Zion Williamson who was the 1st overall pick this year. Ever since he returned from injury, he's been absolutely dominating in only his first year.  Clippers have reigning finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George who is also great.  Nets have Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (KD is out for the season tho). Next year they really have a chance to compete for the championship  The Rockets have James Harden, one of the most prolific scorers ever and is currently averaging 35ppg for the second straight season. Russell Westbrook is also an electrifying top 10 player who's been playing great this year.  Those are just the main teams I'd suggest. Anymore questions let me know."
The best thing for KD is to lead brooklyn to a title and the core of Dray/Steph/Klay never win again or make it back to a finals. They are under 500 in finals games without Kevin Durant in the starting lineup.
To what? The last team widely considered to be a super team’s second best player was Steph Curry. Unless you want to argue that it was Kevin Durant.
"Super teams are like the Warriors who had Steph, a 2x MVP, Kevin Durant a 1x MVP, Klay who has multiple all stars and all NBAs, and Draymond, a DPOY, and multiple time all star. That’s a super team because the talent was just incredible. Also the Heat with Lebron, Wade, and Bosh."
Kevin Durant is a two time champion same as lebron James is a 3x champion  If your gonna criticize one make sure You don’t forget lebrons “decisions”
Same shit as lebrons bullshit letter of how he missed home so much. But the idea was younger knees in kyrie vs Wade and Kevin love.  After getting his shit kicked in by the spurs he knew his window on that team closed. He knows he’s barely scraped his last championship against them when ray allen hit that 3.  If lebron can constantly switch teams Kevin Durant has the right to do whatever he wants also  Heck lebron wanted to fucking recruit kawhi Leonard along with Anthony Davis. Would have been even more unstoppable than the warriors
"To address one point you’ve mentioned more than once in this thread, I don’t think you should disregard Luka because of his mediocre on-off numbers. That stat can be very informative, but like any stat, there are instances where it is flawed. To name just a few examples:  Kevin Durant in 2011-2012: Scored 28 PPG on 61% TS. His on-off was -4.1. Several of KD’s early seasons had negative on-off ratings despite efficient scoring. ([here](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/984/onoff#tab-team_efficiency))  Anthony Davis this year: DPOY candidate and efficient scorer. -0.2 rating. ([here](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/816/onoff#tab-team_efficiency))  Paul George in 2017-2018: +0.6 ([here](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/1271/onoff#tab-team_efficiency))  These seasons were each All-NBA caliber, and yet they resulted in poor on-off ratings for one reason or another. Obviously the circumstances were different for each of these guys, but my point is just that on-off ratings can sometimes be misleading. We only have two years of on-off data on Luka. I don’t think that and his 3P% are enough to discount so many advanced stats that do favor him."
Imagine comparing Kevin Durant to Kristaps Porzingis
"Stop being a clown bro, can you stop Kevin Durant by putting a small guy on him just cause he's skinny?"
"&gt; non-stretch center  He’ll be playing with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Joe Harris. Last thing he needs to be able to do is shoot.  His contract demands mean fuck all to them too as far as basketball goes (their wallets may disagree), it’s not like they’re trying to free up cap space to land stars. They did that already."
"Stop calling any big who has some skill a unicorn. A unicorn is a really tall guy that has the body control, agility, speed, explosiveness and handling ability as a small guy. A unicorn is a guy that abnormal physical abilities for someone his height. Joel Embiid is not a unicorn, he is a really athletic center. Jokic is definitely not a unicorn. Dirk Nowitzki was not a unicorn. The unicorns that exist are Kevin Durant, Giannis and Porzingis."
"I agree that Bird is ISTP. I believe Michael Jordan is ESTJ, though, AKA the drill sergeant personality type.  Also, I think Magic is ENFJ, Charles Barkley is ESTP, Shaq is ESFP, Tim Duncan is ISTJ, Kobe is ENTJ, Kevin Durant is ISFJ, Steph Curry is ESFJ, Gordon Hayward INTP, Kyrie Irving INFJ  Any opinions on these? i think about these things often bc MBTI and NBA are two of my main hobbies l. Lol  I have taken the official MBTI class. That doesn’t make me an expert although it shows i do have some relevant experience"
"If you want to support a team with young talent lead by a dynamic rookie and future superstar you can pick either the Grizzlies or the Pelicans. Out of those two teams, if you prefer the grace, agility and absurd athleticism of Ja Morant (accompanied by triple J’s killer 3 point shooting and the all around fundamentals of Ja’s college teammate Brandon Clarke), pick the Grizzlies. If you prefer the raw power, strength and also absurd athleticism of Zion Williamson (accompanied by Lonzo Ball’s flashy playmaking, Brandon Ingram’s all round scoring ability and wholesome family man and elite defensive veteran Jrue Holiday) pick the Pelicans  If neither of those suit you. You can pick a team lead by a dynamic young sophomore who is already a superstar you can either pick the Dallas Mavericks and the already elite playmaking of Luka Doncic (with some skilled but inefficient 3 point shooting to booth) accompanied by his fellow Eurostar Kristaps Porzingis or the Atlanta Hawks and Trae Young with his elite 3 point shooting and creative handles (with a host of other rookies and sophomores as a bonus)  If you want to support the big boys, pick the Lakers, if you want to support the big boys but hate Lebron James, pick the Bucks and last year’s (and likely this year’s) MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo. If you want to support the big boys and be a hipster about it, pick the Clippers. If you want to support the big boys but want to take a break from being the big boys for a year, pick the Warriors and Steph Curry. If you want to pick the big boys and have the tolerance to put up with Drake, pick the Raptors and Spicy P. If you want to support the big boys and feel inevitable disappointment, pick James Harden, Russell Westbrook and the Houston Rockets. If you want to support next year’s big boys, pick the Celtics for Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker or the Brooklyn Nets with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant (don’t trust them to be good leaders though)  If you want to pretend you’re a contending team you can choose the Utah Jazz, with completely destroyed team chemisu, high flying dunker Donovan Mitchell, 2 time DPOY going on 3 Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley who swears he was good last year. Or you can choose the Denver Nuggets with Nikola Jokic, who has previously starred in Ghostbusters as the Stay Puft monster. Or you could choose the 76ers, a team that could have been legit contenders but royally screwed it up  If you want a team that might be contenders in a few years, you can pick the Thunder, currently lead by veteran all time great point guard Chris Paul, have a promising young Combo guard in Shai Gilgeous Alexander and an unholy amount of future draft picks. Alternatively you can pick the Orlando Magic, with an all star center and talented young defenders or the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler who is basically Michael Jordan with less talent and more anger  If you want to follow a team that can’t really get better or worse, pick either the San Antonio Spurs, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Washington Wizards or the Detroit Pistons  If you want to play the very long game for supporting a team that might have a decent future, you can choose between, the Timberwolves, the Kings or the Bulls  If you want to be constantly depressed follow the Hornets or the Knicks"
"Because he's still a top 3 player.   You are correct tho, he isn't in his prime anymore yet still insane. The only people I would consider in his caliber are Kawhi Leonard Kevin Durant. (Current players)"
That's a red herring and not even the point.   Both of them struggled badly to shoot over the final 3 games but in no universe should Kevin Durant have to compete with a far inferior scorer like Westbrook for the most shots.  Which brings me back to the original point - name some all-time great scorers who have reached ultimate success with a free-wheeling gun-slinging point guard. There are none. To do so would be a hell of an accomplishment.
"Kevin Durant, easily"
"Duh.  People think the mid-ranger is dead. It’s not.  It’s just a shot that only really good offensive players take at a high rate because for the overwhelming majority of the league taking a 3 is just more efficient.   Kevin Durant capped off arguably the greatest mid-range shooting season of all time in 18-19, shooting something like 55%+ from 3, so for him (and Dirk) the mid ranger is almost always a really good shot."
"&gt; The Celtics made no other significant acquisitions between the 1978-79 season and the 1979-80 season, however, in 1978-79 Tiny Archibald, who had been a big time scorer and three time All-NBA First Team in the 70s, was coming off a torn Achilles that caused him to miss the entire previous season and was notably out of shape. He played in 69 games, only averaged 24.1 MPG and 11.0 PPG and had a -1.1 VORP.  &gt; While not as impactful as he was before his injury, Archibald's play and his role were much better the following seasons. His minutes rose from 1662 MPG to 2864, his scoring improved to 14.1 PPG, his assists per game improved from 4.7 to 8.8 with much better efficiency and his VORP rose from -1.1 to +1.5.  Picture if Kevin Durant showed up next year totally fat and out of shape after tearing his achilles, and if the year after that he worked really hard and got himself back into Basketball shape and was good again.  In addition, MUCH better coaching played a big part. Tom Sanders/Dave Cowens were not really fit to coach the team, and they brought in a real coach in Bill Fitch the next season."
My list  1) LeBron James  2) Kevin Durant  3) Steph Curry  4) James Harden  5) Chris Paul  6) Kawhi Leonard  7) Russell Westbrook  8) Kyle Lowry  9) Marc Gasol  10) Blake Griffin  11) Anthony Davis  12) Damian Lillard  13) Dirk Nowitzki  14) Al Horford  15) Dwyane Wade  16) LaMarcus Aldridge  17) Paul George  18) Kyrie Irving  19) Kevin Love  20) Mike Conley
The snubbed DPOY Kevin Durant XD
"I remember telling people this series goes as KD goes.  KD was the best player on the floor and if he didn't step his game up in game 6, then the OKC was done.  Sure Klay went off.  But if Kevin ""I'm Kevin Durant"" Durant had shown up, instead of what he did that game, they would have eliminated the 73 game warriors.  And I would have favored them to beat the Cavs in the finals.    Either way, it would have been a more impressive accomplishment than the two rings he got with by joining them the next year."
The fact you don't have Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant shows how much nephews on reddit really didn't watch basketball pre-2016. Jesus motherfuckin Christ what a ridiculous list.
"That's a fucking myth, he's a scorer that is a great passer. LeBron averages more FGA for his career than Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony, all of whom are considered scorers."
"&gt; And do you realize that the fact Durant and Curry play on the same team along Klay creates space for all of them and opens up the floor because no opponent can leave their man open to help off ball.  It also makes that there are less shots for both when they are on the floor together.  Stats don't tell the whole story, because if it did Russell Westbrook was better than Kevin Durant in 2017 as he averaged more points, rebounds, assists and steals.  LeBron has been a lot of things in his run, but he was almost never the best playoff scorer. KD at age 22 averaged 30 ppg on 60% TS against the Heatles in the NBA Finals.  KD is hands down the best playoff SCORER of this decade, while LeBron due to all the things he does was the best PLAYER. KD has scored the same as LeBron in this decade while playing FAR better competition in the playoffs due to being in the West and not getting to play teams like the Hawks, Pistons and Charlotte."
"PG Derrick Rose: Too much value if just judging peak  SG Pete Maravich: This type of team needs complementary pieces that can play well off ball. I was debating between Klay and Pistol Pete here, went with Pistol because I want a second player from the modern era.   SF Kevin Durant: With the big men I'm choosing, I really want a small forward with limitless range. Again, it's very useful to have players who can function well off ball here.  PF Kevin McHale: A great defender and one of the best post players ever. Will function really well with my center, who has good shooting range and passing ability to complement McHale. Another undervalued pick I think.  C Arvydas Sabonis: Again, incredible value if going by his peak, Yao is a decent pick here too but I think Sabonis offers more to the team."
"No I’m saying MJ isn’t 50% better than KD, that is not humanly possible. How can one of the greatest scorers to ever play average 31, but Jordan comes in and average 45? That an extra half of KD’s points.   As for KD scoring better than Jordan in that era? Idk I won’t say yes, but I definitely won’t say no. Kevin Durant with his skill, height, and shooting in a league that didn’t have any of those things would be scary!!!! Look at the average players height from then and now? Look at the skill from then and now? Look at the shooting from then and now? There’s a more than credible argument KD could (assuming his body can play in that physical era)"
"And do you realize that the fact Durant and Curry play on the same team along Klay creates space for all of them and opens up the floor because no opponent can leave their man open to help off ball.  On the contrary, LeBron without Kyrie was essentially playing on his own on offense against five other guys since his next best teammate was a washed out Kevin Love.  And even if we consider what you said to be true without taking into account the circumstances LeBron is playing with, Durant chose to join this warriors team and has never not been on a super team with less than 2 MVPs, so there is no tangible evidence that he would play better in that scenario.  So we can only go by what real stats we do actually gave, or else we will be comparing stats based on speculation."
"You underestimate the power of peak Bron. 2015 the Cavs whole Finals team consisted of basically JR, TT, Bron, and Delly (who is a heckuva player but you're lucky if you get double digit anything from him). I think if Kyrie was healthy they would have got that one.   2017 was a bit more iffy because defensively they had to guard Curry, Klay, Iggy, Green and Kevin flipping Durant. If they had a Big defensive stopper who could have locked down Durant, or perhaps just cloned another Lebron, then they possibly could have 3-peated then. KLove was a nonfactor. KD was the X-factor &amp; Bron couldnt poss asked to be Cleveland's main playmaker &amp; KD stopper as well."
ill take a better more consistent shooter like ray allen that would shoot more 3s per game than thompson if he was drafted in 2011 and makes finals winning shots. instead of running to the locker room and getting on a conference call with kevin durant lmao
"Is it though? Guys on Boston like Smart and Tatum have, at least publicly, spoken very highly of Kyrie as both a teammate and a person. Same goes with his teammates in Brooklyn and Cleveland (LeBron and Dinwiddie stand out in that respect). There is absolutely no doubt that Kyrie is a weird fucking dude. You have to google his name once to learn he's unique in his weird and downright wrong statements/beliefs (""what does government mean to you"" and all the flat earth horseshit are obvious examples). Is Kyrie the best teammate in the world? Obviously not. There's dozens of other guys I'd rather have from a ""this guys fucking rocks and is ride or die with us"" standpoint. Is there any piece of concrete evidence to point to him being a Sprewell or Marbury type of ""holy shit this guy is the unequivocal worst"" kind of teammate that can derail an entire team that he's not even the best player on? Again obviously not.   When I look back to his most controversial moment of last season, I'd say it's the constantly quoted post-game presser where he talks about the need to get another star on the roster. While tone-deaf and short-sighted, it's not like he's wrong in the slightest, and even then he talked about the need to add pieces to the roster to help every key contributor not named Jarrett Allen (the one guy he omitted from his speech). I don't think it's the worst thing in the world to insinuate that Allen (who I really like as a prospect) had to go in order to bring in win-now talent. Can anyone easily say I'm a biased Nets fan praying to God that the situation we're in works out? 100%, and that very well may be the case. Is it also possible that Boston fans didn't have a great experience with Kyrie given his all around weirdness and meltdown in the playoffs against Milwaukee last year, then deciding to blow everything out of proportion, making him the scapegoat for every shortcoming the team experienced? In my opinion, also yes.  Kyrie is one of the most talented PG's to come through the league ever. Does he have baggage that comes along with having him on the squad? Absolutely, but I think a lot of the detractions attributed to him stem from his inability to produce elite results on a young and talented Boston team as opposed to tangible and verifiable facts/statements pointing to him being an all and out locker-room cancer.   Lastly, this can't be stressed enough, Kyrie isn't the best player on this Nets roster. As, I think, I made clear Kyrie is by no means the ideal leader for any team given his track record in Boston. However, when he's the second best guy on a team (which he undoubtedly is on any roster with Kevin Durant on board), those teams have only gone on to beat a 73-9 Warriors team in the finals. The hate against Kyrie is warranted to an extent given his Boston run and completely weird personality, but it's gone too far imo. People are underselling the fact that if Kyrie Irving is your second fiddle, history shows that's a damn good formula for success. Granted this all hinges on KD's achilles but I feel pretty damn confident that the 7 foot sniper with AT LEAST 14 months of rehab (if he returns for this year's playoffs) will be in damn good shape.  TL;DR- the Kyrie hate is over blown given that he isn't even the best player on this Nets roster, and there is no concrete evidence linking his over batshit weirdness to team's imploding. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
"awful take. I have no emotional attachment to either of those guys or the teams they played for, but IMO, LeBron has the best three *easily* and they’d shake out like this  **1. 2016**  LeBron averaged 29.7/11.3/8.9 on .494/.371/.721  Duh. 3-1 comeback on a 73-9 team, down 7 at half in game 7 after Draymond went the fuck OFF in the first half. Three straight pantheon, all-time great level performances w/ great compliment from Kyrie. Counter: Curry unhealthy during playoffs (an excuse imo) Draymond suspended, Bogut injured. But Dray missed one game and Bogut is nowhere near as important as the guys Cleveland was without in ‘15.    **2- 2013** LeBron averaged 25.3/10.9/7.0 on /.447/.353/.795  Spurs were a great team and absolutely had Miami on the ropes with less than 30 to go. If LeBron missing the 3 that led to the Ray Allen shot has a negative impact to you, you need to consider he dominated Game 7. If you thought San Antonio was washed for some reason in the moment, they fucked the Heat up in 2014. Tim Duncan was incredible in 2013 and LeBron prevented his legacy from potentially being 6-0 in the Finals with 4 FMVPs, should they repeat in ‘14, which I don’t think would’ve happened. Counter: What? Wade was still good? San Antonio choked? Bron was great.   **3-2012**- LeBron averaged 28.6/10.2/7.4 on .477/.188/.826  In what universe is 2015 more impressive than beating KD, who has ascended and is 2 seasons away from being named MVP. Russ was an all-star already and was five years away from being named MVP. James Harden was on this team too, who would also go on to be an MVP. Oh, they also have peak athletic, 3.5 BPG Serge Ibaka too. OKC took Game 1 and the next three were close before Shoeless Mike Miller hit a hundred threes and buried the Thunder, creating a false narrative that series was a blowout.   **4-2015** Curry averaged 26.0/5.2/6.3 on .443/.385/.885  Overrated IMO. No Kyrie after game 1. No Kevin Love, and the dominating narrative until Game 4 was how well Matthew Dellavedova was guarding Steph Curry. In Game 2, with no Kyrie, Steph went 5-23 and 2-15 from three, but Klay’s 34 were enough to squeak it out. Curry has a great game 3, with 27 pts on 50% shooting, 7 threes and the only knock is 6 TO’s. Like Game 1 where Curry posted a similar line, GS lost. In Game 4, Iguodala and Curry both had 22 points, with Iggy doing it on two less attempts and helping to hold LeBron to 31% shooting. Game 5 was the Curry game, where he went the fuck off and helped the team win a finals game for literally the first time in his career. By this point, LeBron’s fellow starters were **Matthew Dellavedova, Iman Shumpert, Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov**. In the closeout game, Iguodala again matched Curry’s point total on more efficient shooting from the field and behind the arc. You can definitely argue that Steph deserved the 2015 FMVP, but in my opinion, in the spirit of the honor, Iggy deserved it. He swung the series, though obviously the clear counter to that take is that they don’t win the fucking series w/o Curry lol.   I spent so much time on the other ones that I think we can all agree 2017 is marginally more impressive than 2018, but that gaining Kevin Durant guaranteed the Warriors those titles save injuries, like in 2019. I don’t at all hold the ‘19 Finals against Curry, and if GSW wins that series that’s the second best one on this list, easily.  Curry in ‘17: 26.8/8.0/9.4 on .440/.388/.897   Curry in ‘18: 27.5/6.0/6.8 on .402/.415/1.000  edit: forgot to add numbers"
"&gt;against the best team ever assembled talent wise.  This ""best team ever assembled"" (talent wise) was down 25 points in Game 1 AT HOME. Also, remember the Spurs blew them out at Oracle by 35 in the regular season.  Here is what would've happened if the Warriors didn't put a hitman on Kawhi:  Game 1 - Spurs win by 8-10 points  Game 2 - Warriors win by 8-10 points  Game 3  - Spurs win in a 15+ point blowout. The game is never close  Game 4 - Spurs win in an extremely close game (by 3-5 points). Blood will bleed. Sweat will flood the Earth. Tears will be shed.  Game 5 - Warriors win a close and intense game - though not as intense as game 4 -  by 5-7 points with Durant going off for 40. Despite this win, it's clear the Spurs will close out in game 6  Game 6 - As mentioned, this win looks inevitable and Spurs coast to a double digit win, go on to face the Cavs, and beats them in 6 as well  Kevin then decides to take an even harder road, and elects to join the Spurs. The Spurs deny him however because they want winners, not wimpy loses on their team. Steph and Kevin (and Lebron) all share one major weakness and that is lack of killer instinct."
One of the most underrated passers in basketball history. He is still above Kevin Durant on the all-time greatest SF.
"LeBron has faced 21 MVPs in the playoffs (I'm using former MVPs and near MVPs, so in this scenario 2012 Westbrook counts even though he won MVP in 2017):   2007: Tim Duncan  2008: Kevin Garnett  2010: Derrick Rose, Kevin Garnett  2011: Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, Dirk Nowitzki  2012: Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden  2013: Tim Duncan  2014: Kevin Garnett (Shell of himself), Tim Duncan   2015: Derrick Rose (Shell of Himself), Steph Curry  2016: Steph Curry  2017: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant  2018: Steph Curry, Kevin Durant     13/21 came in the finals. For reference, Dirk played against Karl Malone, Tim Duncan x6, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash x2, Shaq, Kobe, Kevin Durant x3, Russell Westbrook x3, James Harden, LeBron James, James Harden. (This doesn't include Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade or other arguable MVPs).   Dirk has faced 21 MVPs. LeBron's facing 10 former MVPs in the finals isn't that impressive, it just shows that more often than not the MVP was in the Western conference because the West was so much harder."
2007 Finals -- Tim Duncan  2011 Finals -- Dirk Nowitzki   2013 Finals -- Tim Duncan  2014 Finals -- Tim Duncan  2015 Finals -- Steph Curry  2016 Finals -- Steph Curry  2017 Finals -- Steph Curry and Kevin Durant  2018 Finals -- Steph Curry and Kevin Durant
led a better team in 2016 than Westbrook ever has with Kevin Durant.
"You are confused on the rules, and so was the broadcast  The refs have the authority to rule on two things:  - if he was in the restricted area  - if he was in a legal guarding position  *while reviewing* the first, they may *also* determine if the second is accurate  &gt;  While reviewing, they may also confirm if the defender was in legal guarding position when the contact occurred.  they know he's not in the restricted area, they confirm that almost immediately, the broadcast even plainly says that, what they're checking for is if he's in a legal guarding position. Which he's not.   https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/31/17416184/lebron-james-charge-kevin-durant-overturned-block-foul-cavs-warriors-game-1-nba-finals  it's been reported on a dozen times, is consistent with the official NBA rulebook, and is exactly what the game report from the NBA says"
"In my fantasy league, I traded Kevin Durant in his rookie season for Al-Jefferson because I needed rebounds.   Loved him."
He's basically Kevin Durant with leadership ability.

LeBron is easy 1st, with Curry and KD being tough to decide between, but had to go with Curry due to the two MVPs, one being the only ever unanimous MVP. *(Honourables: James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Playoff MVP of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|FMVPs|Titles|Series W's|Total Pts| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|LeBron James|3|3|28|5,150| |2nd|Kevin Durant|2|2|21|4,043| |3rd|Stephen Curry|-|3|19|2,968|  &amp;nbsp;  - LeBron is obvious 1st again. Durant's longevity and production in the post-season nets him 2nd. FMVPs are good indicators, but only tell a smart part to a post season story, and therefore Steph is comfortably 3rd in my book. *(Honourables: Kawhi Leonard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Rookie Season of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|ROY|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Luka Dončić|2018-19|21.2|7.8|6.0| |2nd|Ben Simmons|2017-18|15.8|8.1|8.2| |3rd|Damian Lillard|2012-13|19.0|3.1|6.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Comparing all rookie seasons over the course of a decade, Luka would be my favourite for 1st, edging out Simmons. Dame's rookie campaign may have been forgotten, but if you win ROY unanimously over a player like AD, you did something special. *(Honourables: Donovan Mitchell, Karl-Anthony Towns)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Defensive Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|DPOYs|DRtg|DWS|DBPM| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kawhi Leonard|2|100|28.1|+2.4| |2nd|Draymond Green|1|102|27.7|+2.8| |3rd|Rudy Gobert|2|100|24.2|+2.3|  &amp;nbsp;  - In an era of ever-growing perimeter threats, Kawhi has established himself as a defensive juggernaut with his length, strength and oven size mitts. Draymond and Rudy are obvious 2nd and 3rd picks. *(Honourables: Dwight Howard)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Most Improved Player of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|MIP|Draft Pick|Current Status|Change in Points per 36| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Giannis Antetokounmpo|2016-17|15th|MVP Tier|24.5| |2nd|Kawhi Leonard|-|15th|MVP Tier|18.1| |3rd|Jimmy Butler|2014-15|30th|Perenial All-Star|12.4|  &amp;nbsp;  - This is improvement over the course of a decade, as opposed to a singular season. So many options to choose from for this award, but Giannis &amp; Kawhi has to be 1 &amp; 2. Both drafted outside the lottery from lesser known programs, both began with a mix of bench and starter minutes, and both ultimately turned into titans of the game. Butler's ascension has also been remarkable, and I'm comfortable to have him at 3rd. *(Honourables: Stephen Curry, James Harden)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Sixth Man of the Decade**  ||Name|6MOYs|PPG|RPG|APG| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Lou Williams|3|16.1|2.4|3.6| |2nd|Jamal Crawford|3|14.2|1.8|2.8| |3rd|James Harden|1|12.7|3.4|2.5|  &amp;nbsp;  - Lou beats out Jamal here just because of Jamal's reduced production in his last two seasons, otherwise it would be impossible to determine. 3rd was also tough to pick, but I had to go with the bench star of those baby Thunder teams. Stats only used for years where they qualified for 6MOY. *(Honourables: Eric Gordon)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Coach of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|COYs|Titles|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Greg Popovich|2|1|559-245|69.5%| |2nd|Steve Kerr|1|3|322-88|78.5%| |3rd|Erik Spoelstra|-|2|480-324|59.7%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Top 2 was hard to decide, but gave it to Pop for the longevity of success. The Heat’s consistency and ability to re-stabilise after the success of the Big 3 Heat helps him place 3rd. *(Honourables: Mike Budenholser, Brad Stevens)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Scorer of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Name|Scoring Titles|Total Pts|PPG|TS%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Kevin Durant|4|19,445|28.0|62.6%| |2nd|James Harden|2|18,627|24.3|60.9%| |3rd|LeBron James|-|19,550|26.9|60.9%|  &amp;nbsp;  - KD's insane scoring production, consistency and efficiency makes it easy to select him as the top scorer of the decade. Harden is without a doubt second, as he almost makes it boring to talk about his 40+ point games now. Fun fact if we only counted his years on the Rockets, he'd be averaging 29.0 PPG, only behind the career averages of Jordan &amp; Wilt. And LeBron isn't considered a scorer first, but its insane to think he's totalled more points than KD, due in large part to durability and volume consistency. *(Honourables: Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Shooter of the Decade**  ||Name|3PM|3P%|FG%|FT%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Stephen Curry|2,483|43.6%|47.7%|90.5%| |2nd|Klay Thompson|1,798|41.9%|45.9%|84.8%| |3rd|Kyle Korver|1,514|44.5%|45.5%|87.0%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Best shooter of the decade, best shooter in history, same thing for Stephen Curry. His running mate Klay comes in 2nd due to the countless times of historical shooting nights that make you question if you've ever seen him miss before. And Kyle Korver doesn't get talked about much these days, but he is consistently one of the most efficient 3 point shooters ever, he comes in 3rd. *(Honourables: Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant)*  &amp;nbsp;  **Franchise of the Decade**  ||Team|Titles|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Golden State Warriors|3|19|505-299|62.8%| |2nd|Miami Heat|2|15|480-324|59.7%| |3rd|San Antonio Spurs|1|13|559-245|69.5%| |4th|Cleveland Cavaliers|1|14|388-416|48.3%| |5th|Toronto Raptors|1|8|440-364|54.7%| |6th|Dallas Mavericks|1|4|420-384|52.2%| |7th|Los Angeles Lakers|1|6|363-441|45.1%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Champions write history, so I included all of them.  &amp;nbsp;  **Non-Champion Franchise of the Decade**  &amp;nbsp;  ||Team|Furthest Round|Series W's|Record|Win%| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1st|Oklahoma City Thunder|Finals|10|515-289|64.1%| |2nd|Boston Celtics|Finals|10|456-347|56.8%| |3rd|Houston Rockets|Conference Finals|6|488-316|60.7%|  &amp;nbsp;  - Showing some love to non-champions and their valiant efforts, not to be forgotten. *(Honourables: LA Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies)*  &amp;nbsp;  Any awards I could add?

"This such a lie man. Durant creates a lot of space for Curry &amp; Klay to operate offball &amp; get open shots off screens. Durant has incredible Gravity as a shooter &amp; post player.    Last three NBA Finals.  Stephen Curry with Kevin Durant ON: 72-for-156 (46.2%) from the field, 35-for-83 (42.2%) from three, 57.4 eFG%  Stephen Curry with Kevin Durant OFF: 58-for-155 (37.4%) from the field, 29-for-86 (33.7%) from three, 46.8 eFG%  Even look at the Toronto series, game 5 when KD was subbed in, Steph went for a quick 14 points in the first quarter. That was mainly due to KD’s gravity"
"I can remember watching games clearly back to about the 95-96 season. I am basing this post based solely on seasons I actually saw. This is ranked in order.  1. Shaq - Honestly this isn't even close, nobody has been remotely as dominant as Shaq was during his peak years. Nobody else seemed to have teams change their entire rosters to attempt (and miserably fail) to stop him. Nobody was double and triple teamed as much as Shaq was since I've been watching the NBA yet he still dominated. I feel like he has somehow become the most underrated NBA player in modern history as people are somehow ranking Kobe above him sometimes. 2. Michael Jordan - Remember I only watched the second three-peat. I would take Shaq over that period of MJ. I would probably feel different if I saw the crazy athletic Jordan of the late 80s and early 90s. 3. LeBron - Pretty self-explanatory I think. 4. Stephen Curry 5. Kevin Garnett - Ranking him above Duncan is probably controversial but I honestly think he had a better peak but was stuck on worse teams most of his career and especially all through his peak. 6. Tim Duncan - I feel like I am underrating him here but I am rating on peak here, not longevity. 7. Kobe Bryant - I might be underrating him here but I was more impressed with everyone above him. 8. James Harden 9. Kevin Durant 10. Giannis - He will definitely climb this list.  Chris Paul, Wade, Dirk, and Westbrook were toughest cuts."
From the fact that the 2 things the NBA has loads of are drama and liars lol.  And also [everyone is constantly speculating regardless of reports.](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/5/25/21269778/eagle-maybe-kevin-durant-and-kyrie-irving-are-waiting-to-see-what-nba-does)
"Rondo, Rubio, Lonzo... These players are great passers. Much better than Kevin Durant in terms of vision and passing ability. That doesn't mean any of them is comparable to Kevin fucking Durant as a basketball player.  Lou Williams is a great scorer, but he is not a great player. Jason Richardson was a great dunker, but he wasn't a star level player. Advanced metrics show that Dennis Rodman is the best rebounder in the last 50 years, but he is not a top-50 player in the same time period."
Kevin Durant playoff TS% before 2017 Warriors: 58%  Steph Curry playoff TS% before 2017 Warriors: 59%  I'll let u take a guess on who got more open shots in the playoffs
"Until he went to the Warriors, Kevin Durant.   The unfortunate part is that we’ll never know if KD genuinely improved on the Warriors or if he was merely reaping the benefits of playing on a ridiculously talented team because his play going forward will be coloured by the Achilles tear and age."
These are all in person and are SOMEWHAT in order:  Malone  Ewing  Durant  Payton  Westbrook  Ray Allen  Derrick Rose  Kevin love  Jayson Tatum  Adam Morrison

"&gt; The New York Knicks and president of basketball operations Leon Rose will soon embark on the search process for a new head coach and Tom Thibodeau is atop the list of targets, sources told The Athletic. The Knicks are believed to be targeting a decision in the next few weeks, sources said.  &gt; Interim coach Mike Miller has left a strong impression throughout the franchise, including in his time since Rose assumed control of the front office. Miller is expected to receive an interview when the Knicks do start formally talking to prospective head coaches, according to league sources, after stabilizing the team following a 4-18 start that led to David Fizdale’s firing.  &gt; The timetable for the coaching search and an eventual decision could be impacted by the NBA’s decision on which teams return to play and when, possibly pushing the Knicks’ plans back if they are among the teams that still have games remaining. The NBA is in serious talks with Orlando’s Disney World Resort to host the resumed 2019-20 season, as The Athletic reported last week, and the league issued a survey to its 30 general managers over the weekend regarding competition formats to return to play.  &gt;Miller would coach out the remainder of a resumed season, if the Knicks have to return, and would likely be offered an opportunity to return to the franchise in some coaching capacity next season.  &gt;Thibodeau compiled a 352-246 record (58.9 winning percentage) in 7 1/2 seasons coaching Chicago and Minnesota. He led the Bulls to playoff seasons in each of his five seasons as head coach from 2010-15, highlighted by a berth to the Eastern Conference finals in 2011 when the Bulls went 62-20. With the Timberwolves, Thibodeau orchestrated a trade to acquire All-Star Jimmy Butler in the 2017 offseason, propelled Minnesota to the postseason in 2018 and snapped the franchise’s 14-year playoff drought.  &gt;Thibodeau was fired as Timberwolves coach last January and had been reported to be a Knicks candidate since even before there was an opening.  &gt; Former Brooklyn Nets coach Kenny Atkinson likely will also receive an interview, sources said. Atkinson and the Nets parted ways in March with the team at 28-34 and on the way to the postseason during a difficult fourth season at the helm. Atkinson helped turn the franchise around during his tenure, taking it from a 20-win team in 2016-17 to a playoff team last season and one that proved to be an attractive destination for Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in free agency. He was a Knicks assistant for four seasons under head coach Mike D’Antoni.  &gt; Whoever the Knicks select as their head coach will step into one of the hardest jobs in the league. The next coach would be the franchise’s sixth in the last six years — none have lasted more than two seasons — and the team hasn’t made the playoffs since 2013. The ability to weather instability will have to be a key characteristic.  &gt; The hire will be the most important one yet by Rose, who took over as team president in March. He has already filled out the top levels of his front office, hiring Walt Perrin and Frank Zanin as assistant general managers and keeping Scott Perry as the GM. None will have the pressure or the front-facing responsibilities of the next coach.  &gt; The Knicks have a roster featuring core pieces RJ Barrett and Mitchell Robinson, a young forward in Kevin Knox and veterans such as Julius Randle, Taj Gibson, Moe Harkless and Bobby Portis. But the roster the next coach inherits could face loads of turnover. As many as eight players can become free agents this summer.  &gt; For Thibodeau, a former Knicks assistant from 1996-2003, the job would be unlike any he’s had during his career as a head coach. He arrived in Chicago to a ready-made playoff team and pushed the Bulls to 62 wins in his first season. He kept them as one of the Eastern Conference’s best teams despite significant injuries to Derrick Rose, an MVP at 22.  &gt; Thibodeau led the Timberwolves to the playoffs in 2017-18 fueled by the trade for Butler. It was a coup for Thibodeau as the team’s coach and its head of basketball operations. But that relationship crumbled quickly the next season. Butler demanded a trade, and Thibodeau was fired a few months later.  &gt; While he inherited a team stocked with a burgeoning All-Star in Minnesota in Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks do not have anyone with that pedigree. The team’s next coach will be tasked with bringing together a group of young players still early in their careers. Barrett, 19, was the No. 3 pick in the 2019 draft. Knox and Frank Ntilikina were both lottery picks, but have yet to turn promise into consistent production. Robinson, 22, stands tall as an exciting center and a franchise bulwark."
"In the 2010s, LeBron and Steph Curry. Some would say Kevin Durant too though."
No he won’t people see Kevin Durant as a player who needed the warriors to win a finals and kawhi as someone who elevated the raptors to a finals win
"&gt; o Dray's drop-off is due to the arrival of KD? If Durant never shows up then Draymond would have shot 40% from 3 the last 3 seasons? Can you explain exactly how you arrived at that conclusion and what makes it more likely than the possibility that Draymond simply hit 1 more 3-pointer every 4 games in 2016 than he did in every other year of his career?   I'm not saying that Dray would've continued to shoot 40% from 3. What I'm saying is that the arrival of Kevin Durant obviously takes away from Draymond Green's input on the offensive end. He's obviously going to get less touches.  &gt; Ignoring Russ (who you admit can change), and ignoring the fact that CP3 is not really the same ballpark as Klay *and* KD, and ignoring the part where you didn't reallyanswer my question... What makes you think Harden hasn't changed for the other players? Can you define the style of play that you feel was the same from 2017 to 2018?   To be fair, Harden being that ball dominant might be a product of D'antoni's system. In my opinion, we could've had something big if they tried switching and putting the ball more in Paul's hand and have Harden play as a true shooting guard rather than as a PG."
that kyle korver and kevin durant are rivals.
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
"If you're going to point out the dip in true shooting, it's true that it went down relative to the regular season. Now let's compare 58.5% true shooting with others. Per [basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ts_pct_career_p.html) Lebron has a postseason career average 57.88% TS, Ray Allen has a postseason career average of exactly 58.54% TS. Chris Paul, 57.91%.   You say ""absolutely not a good finals for a superstar in the mid/late 2010's"" and yet there are only four players in the league who have better averages than 58.5%: Kawhi Leonard, **Stephen curry**, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, and Tristan Thompson. And we know Dwight isn't who he used to be as of mid/late 2010's, and Tristan Thompson is low volume/not first option. So there are quite literally two players who you can say average better efficiency than Steph's worst finals performance..  if you're saying that a disappointing finals series by a great player means the equivalent of what was previously considered the greatest shooter of all time's average, then..I don't know what to say."
"&gt; Winning an MVP (while being 2nd place in 3 other seasons) means your great.  This is definitely the most impressive thing Harden has accomplished.   &gt; Averaging more than prime MJ means you’re great.  No it doesn’t. Raw stats don’t compare across eras, first off, and they never tell the whole story. You and every single other person here is taking MJ 10/10 times if you could choose between them.   Khris Middleton this year is sitting at 50/40/90 on 20ppg. **Only four people ever** have done that - Bird, Nowitzki, Curry, Durant. Do I get to go around saying Khris Middleton is as good as Kevin Durant?  &gt; Reaching the finals and being a perennial conference finals participant as the main star means you’re great  Harden reached the Finals one time, as the third option, and lost. As a main star he has not made it.  &gt; Man all I gotta say is you buck fans gonna get so tired of defending Giannis when he starts “choking” like Harden has and y’all will deserve it  But then after everything you said, if Giannis has a similar career to James Harden, he **will** deserve all the criticism? I thought James Harden was an all-time great?  You’re right about that, though. I will be deeply disappointed if Giannis ends up like James."
"I just don’t think he’ll ever be efficient enough or get the shots. KD averaged 25/26 ppg playing behind Steph which was ridiculously efficient, 50/40/90, 60% efg on 17 shots a game. BI is getting 18 shots a game this season (mostly without Zion) and shooting 46/38/85, 53% efg. His shots aren’t going up next season, do you think his offensive ceiling is Kevin Durant? I don’t"
"Kevin Durant went from the league nice guy who was loyal to his team to the bad guy who teamed up to make the greatest team of all time. When he got injured, he got sympathy and people liked him and people stopped hating as much. Now he's with the nets and people just find his tweets amusing and appreciate his game more."
"You gotta keep viewers somehow. Basketball is only the favorite sport of 11% of Americans.  Most NBA TV subscribers are probably just general ""sports fans"" with enough disposable income to get the best sports package.  In that situation what's going to keep more viewers:  1. A random game from 2012 that probably isn't in the highest quality 2. A random 2012 game that says ""KEVIN DURANT 35 POINTS GAME-WINNER IN BOSTON""  It ain't about spoilers, it's about views"
"Last 6 years he averaged 10+ FTA a game in the regular season. In the playoffs he had the same average only 2/6 times, including the last 2 years where he averaged 7 and 8 FTA in the playoffs when he averaged 11 FTA in the regular season. and his FG% was also down, specifically his 3P%. The guy pulls up for threes and falls to the ground on half his attempts to draw fouls. He's not getting that in the playoffs. That's a terrible shooting mechanic. He's not getting as many calls in the playoffs and he's flopping around like a fish out of water which is hurting his shooting. Even if Kevin Durant doesn't go to the Warriors, Harden isn't getting past them. He needs to play a normal game and stop playing for a foul on every shot. It's absurd how badly he did in the playoffs last year with the 3 point flopping."
PG - Steph Curry  SG - Klay Thompson  SF - Andre Igoudala  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Demarcus Cousins
"Really? Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Demar and somewhat Lebron have made a living scoring from the midrange. These are three of the best players in the world. It’s the most efficient shot for non-bigs to create shots (besides Harden)"
"Yeah the first 2 games Steph had 38 and 29 on elite efficiency. But there was the whole blown lead in game 2 and everyone getting on KD's back about just taking 8 shots and fouling out against Patrick Beverley.  Then you had the 'I'm Kevin Durant' interview and KD just took over the offense.  In the first 2 games Steph averaged 17 shots per game and KD averaged 12 . In the last 4 games, that number dropped to 13 shots per game for Steph and KD's attempts sky-rocketed to 26 shots per game."
Draymond Green’s Top Observations:  The Warriors did not need Kevin Durant.  The Celtics did not love Paul Pierce like that.
How do people still parrot this stuff? Harden has the same FTA and a slightly lower FTr in the playoffs than he does in the regular season. The only reason he doesn’t have a ring or at least a finals appearance in Houston is because kevin Durant is uncompetitive and reverse engineered his way to success.
Yes. Teams have to gameplan against his movement when he doesnt have the ball. Huge part of why the Warriors were so successful. also why Kevin Durant averaged such great numbers in the playoffs on that team. Steph opens up the court for everyone and gives them room to work.
PG: Steph Curry  SG: Klay Thompson  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: LeBron James  C: Shaquille O'Neal  Pretty much unbeatable in my opinion
Kevin durant. Since we are assuming prime versions.   Curry   Harden or WB I would lean to WB for this team   Klay   KD   DMC   All from 2 teams too
Kevin Durant is a generational talent
"He's still the most hyped draft prospect I've seen since LeBron - so the last 17 drafts.  Kevin Durant was a near 7-footer who could handle, move, and shoot like a guard, and put up an all-time great college season as a freshman, yet everyone had Oden as the #1 pick that year no question.   And he was actually good when he played, even after the injuries. I think an Oden with 0 injuries is at least a top 5 player of the 2010s."
Patrick Beverly is a net positive on defense. Kevin Durant is very talented.
Kevin Durant is ungaurdable 1 on 1...perhaps the most unguardable player ever thanks to his ridiculous length and great handles for a guy that size.
"[""unlimited potential"" - ""the youngest player in the draft and the most mysterious"" - ""he's got a kevin durant body, he handles the ball like a point forward""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB-KP5oPZy4)  Literally first youtube result buddy"
Kevin Durant 20 times makes up your top 20?
Kevin Durant is my top 20 all time
"Probably won't believe me but I thought Giannis would become an MVP-caliber player. Mainly because of his name and the fact that he was only 18 years-old and still clearly growing physically.   I didn't see him becoming this specific type of player though, I always thought he'd be more like Kevin Durant due to his length and build when he was a  rookie.  To counteract such a bold claim, I also thought Dončić, Tatum, and Young would be busts."
Kevin Durant has left the chat
People forget that the Giannis' jump shot looked much more clean in his rookie year. I really thought he would be the lite version of Kevin Durant after his rookie year. He became Shaq instead.
[Kevin Durant has also been playing at this replica court](https://twitter.com/33643pts/status/1273871923538255872?s=21)
"Virtually every detail from the 2016 Finals. Ten years ago, LeBron was technically still in his first stint with the Cavaliers, so imagine trying to tell someone that:  1. LeBron left the Cavs to form a LBJ-Wade-Bosh super team in Miami, basically building their own custom roster from the ground up.  2. Small school sensation Stephen Curry turns out to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.  3. The Warriors break the single season record for wins, topping the '96 Bulls.  4. LeBron *comes back* to Cleveland and leads them to the Finals in 2015, averaging 36, 13, and 9.   5. Imagine telling someone back then that Cleveland and Golden State would meet in four straight finals *after* LeBron James chose to leave in 2010.   6. The Warriors win three rings.  7. The one ring the Warriors lost came during their record-breaking season, where LeBron leads an inexplicable 3-1 comeback and seals a Game 7 ring for the Cavs with a series-saving last minute chasedown block (while averaging 30, 11, and 9).   8. J.R. Smith celebrates shirtless for days on end.   9. Some guy on the streets of Cleveland eats poop.   10. The Warriors respond by signing Kevin Durant.   Nothing about this timeline isn't insane, just as it pertains to the Warriors and Cavs alone. I don't think I would have believed a single second of it back then."
"Stephen Curry would win a ring before Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant"
....kevin durant MAY have gotten away with the most blatant out of bounds call...?  &amp;#x200B;  MAY HAVE?! Lol wtf is BR thinking with a title like this. Just commit to saying it is the most blatant missed call ever.
How. How can you possibly forget that Kevin Durant is a great player.
"Blame Michael Jordan.  Before he took over, big men ruled basketball.  Once he came along, everyone wanted to be like Mike, even the bigger kids.  That is why bigger guys like Lebron James and Kevin Durant developed handles instead of low post moves.    Kerr is probably in the minority on disliking this trend.  Talented big men hard to find, simply because they are rarer in general.  I'm sure a lot of execs are happy they don't need to find a talented 7 footer to compete anymore."
Kevin Durant
"We're getting there. This could be the best post season since 2016.    Kevin Durant ruined years of competitive basketball.    Lots of teams have some hope of winning it all.  Lakers, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers, Nuggets, Mavericks, Raptors, Celtics, Heat.    That's a lot of high level teams."
"i dont support Kevin Durant because of how he joined a 73-9 team and used a burner account, without even getting into his thoughts on his former Thunder teammates, but i support his right to branch out in the business world, so if he wants to produce content/give opportunities to other creatives with The Boardroom, hes free to do whatever he pleases."
"If we look at just NBA, I would say the 2011 Mavericks. Short season bc of a lockout but also bc of the Lebron effect. I would argue more people will remember Lebron and the Heat losing their first championship shot, versus the Dallas Mavericks winning.   The Mavs are also the least ""star-studded"" team to win during the decade:  Lakers: Kobe, Pau, Lamar, Metta World Peace   **Dallas: Dirk**   Heat: Lebron, D Wade, Bosh   Heat: Lebron, D Wade, Bosh   Spurs: Kawhi, Tony Parker, Tim Duncan, Manu   Warriors: Steph, Klay, Andre, Draymond   Cavs: Lebron, Kyrie, K Love   Warriors: Steph, Kevin Durant, Klay, Andre, Draymond   Warriors: Steph, Kevin Durant, Klay, Andre, Draymond   **Raptors: Kawhi, Kyle Lowry**  But you could also argue the 2019 Raptors will end up being the most discredited bc the entire Warriors team was hurt/injured and had just played the most games for any team in the past 5 years. People will also be quick to acknowledge the Warriors being hurt, before talking about the Raptors winning.   As far as NBA goes, try and convince me it's not one of these 2 teams!"
"Just hide your PG's defense with good defenders like Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, and iguodala!"

Kevin Durant is the biggest sell out of them all
Now post “Opponent injuries and Kevin Durant save Steph Curry’s legacy”
"I don't even know the words to tell you how wrong that is and how astronomically far away LeBron is from KD when it comes to the midrange game.   Let's only take LeBron's midrange averages ranging from Miami (when he improved his shot) until today, so I won't include his early years where his midrange was pretty terrible.  &amp;nbsp;  LeBron's averages are 41.0% from 10-16 feet and 39.8% from 16-3P in those years.  &amp;nbsp;  For reference, those are equivalent to Durant's age 20 season, when he put up his 2nd *worst* midrange stats of his career. 40.5% from 10-16 and 39.8% from 16-3P. Kevin Durant shot 52% and 53.5% from those spots last year.   &amp;nbsp;  Calling LeBron a tick under KD in midrange is like calling kyle lowry a tick under Curry when it comes to 3 point shooting"
"So, we’re just going to let Kevin Durant subtly insinuate that Kendrick Perkins is an “Uncle Tom” by calling him a “sell out”?  President calling protesters “thugs” is a code word, just like “sell out” is. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

"I don't think that's a great definition of a sellout. This one is better.   &gt;Selling out is a common idiomatic pejorative expression for the compromising of a person's integrity, morality, authenticity, or principles in exchange for personal gain, such as money.  [Compromising principles](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-im-tired-of-being-second--im-done-with-it/) for personal gain (like a couple of NBA titles).  Like it's fine to sell out if it's worth it to him, but he absolutely comprised his whole 'never stop competing' principle to join a team that could basically sleep walk through the season and only lost in the finals because of injuries."

How is saying “we need a few more pieces to round out the roster” in any way reflect on his intelligence? He’s 100% right. The team could stand to add some defensive pieces in the front court in order to round out the roster. He’s an idiot for acknowledging the team could stand to improve?

Yeah. A Kevin Fucking Durant that’s on the wrong side of 30 and suffered a major injury.
Kevin Durant is arguably the second best player in the league. I think they would do anything to keep him. Probably trade all their draft picks for older vets that can help them win... oh wait.

"&gt; he's hitting volume mid rangers over 50%  He most definitely doesn't lmfao, if Derozan was hitting that high a clip he would be more efficient than Kevin freaking Durant"
Kevin Durant
&gt; Anyone wanna guess what Dame's efficiency would look like playing next to either Kevin Durant or Paul George his whole career?  Well we're never gonna see it cause he took the supermax when he clearly isn't good enough for it
"54.4% TS to 51.3%TS....you guys still really tryna use FG%?    Not to mention you guys harp on how Durant's efficiency in the playoffs is so good because how talented his teammates were, and meanwhile Russell Westbrook has played 3 years in his career where he wasn't playing with a better teammate and he won 4 playoff games total.    Anyone wanna guess what Dame's efficiency would look like playing next to either Kevin Durant or Paul George his whole career?"
"It’s Kevin Durant, he can ask whatever he wants and the Nets will go along with it"
*Kevin Durant added 2timelebronkilla to the chat*
"dude if Kevin Durant wants to go to your team then you do whatever it takes to get Kevin Durant on your team. Draymond’s begging for KD is overstated a lot; KD wanted to go to the Warriors since like February that year, and it was a perfect fit. Then the Warriors ended up losing, which made it easier for him to join. KD gets hate for the move because he joined the team that he lost to, but he was joining the Warriors that offseason unless the Warriors won the Finals. The NBA is a league full of competitors but it’s also a business. You don’t sacrifice guaranteed championships because of your pride and need to “run it back”. This isn’t streetball, where you can just play a game right after you lose. No, you have to go through a long ass grueling season again, and then the playoffs, and you want to be a better team than you were the last year. A lot of the Warriors bench was bound to stagnate the next year, and after Harrison Barnes’ terrible Finals performance I’m sure Warriors FO were ecstatic to let him and the bench mob go in favor of an all time great."
"If I can get a player that is 100% locked in, I want Kevin Durant on the Knicks or LeBron on the Pacers."
"Honestly, it's Kevin Durant. His smile is so welcoming"
Fuck Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
"He has one of the weakest mvps on record and without Kevin Durant, based on what weve seen, do you have any doubt he would have anything better than a 2nd round appearance or 2 at best? Be serious. For a supposed MVP caliber player that would be Carmelo Anthony territory."
remember when he said there were 5 small forwards better that kevin durant in the nba today

Kevin Durant
Durant's head is [shaped like a bean](https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/818/303/828/kevin-durant-hd-widescreen-for-desktop-wallpaper-preview.jpg). I think he's trying to make the best of a bad situation up top.
"I did ignore what you wrote, it's because you don't know what you're talking about.  Being a rich, handsome NBA player in a midwestern city ensures you will have much more craziness in terms of fans and people doing weird shit for and to you, than you will in LA. Believe me, beyond business that's why 7/10 players move here. It's easier to be a rich famous person here than anywhere in the world, it's because there's so many it's hard for normal people and even paparazzi to care, unless youre superfamous like Lebron.  I once saw Kevin Durant walk the mall here just normally, no one even stopped to talk to him, and this was 2012. LA level of fame is completely different than Milwaukee. Both of them wanted that though.  Shaq though, holy shit, that was the Beatles. and god knows Kobe lived as not normal a life here as could be."
PG: Spencer Dinwidde  SG: Luca Doncic  SF: Kevin Durant  PF: Anthony Davis  C: Andre Drummond  6th: DeMar DeRozan
"Nash wins a title as the #1a guy, 2x MVP, 8x all star, would be hard to leave him out of the top 20 IMO.  OKC big 3 probably stays together if they beat Chicago. Dirk goes from a top 20 guy to a top 35-40 guy.   Spurs legacy stays about the same, they win 1 title in the Kawhi era  Memphis or Indiana has a huge legacy shift  OKC most certainly beats Indiana. Durant would be an MVP and a 1-2x Champion and 1-2x FMVP.  Harden has a FMVP, Dwight's legacy is much much better  Durant wins another championship and FMVP  San Antonio wins again, Kawhi gets his first FMVP  Harden gets another championship, Chris Paul's legacy is vastly improved  Fairly sure Milwaukee would win unless Dame went supernova.  &amp;#x200B;  This alternate universe vastly improves the legacies of Steve Nash, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Marc Gasol/Mike Conley.  It drastically hurts LeBron James, Steph Curry and Dirk."
"The thing about using a really skilled player (All-NBA caliber) guy as a 6th man is if they are playing with All-Time Greats.   Manu was a 6th man behind Tim Duncan, and they also had Tony Parker.   Harden was a 6th man behind Kevin Durant, and they also had Westbrook.   McHale was a 6th man behind Larry Bird, and they also had Robert Parish."
"This might be the first actual non brain-dead comment CuhCuh has ever made to be fair. The Warriors benefitted A LOT from Curry having injury prone ankles. They signed him to a crazy deal 48M deal off of that. That allowed them to build a great team around him. That allowed them to sign Iggy, pay Draymond &amp; Klay and sign Kevin Durant. The Warriors are lucky Curry did not decide to play out his final season on his rookie deal and try for a max contract instead of locking in the contract extension, because that would have made not just the Iggy signing far more difficult to pull off (would need to unload more salary than they did, probably Kent Bazemore), but it would have also made paying both Draymond and Klay less palatable cause of luxury tax concerns, and ultimately make the Durant signing impossible without getting rid of Livingston and Iggy to dunk salary.  Now, does that mean the Warriors front office only were successful because of that? Absolutely not. It just means that, they wouldn't have the same success without Curry being worried about his ankles and signing a contract extension that made him the fifth highest paid player on the Warriors in 2015-16 behind Klay Draymond Iggy and Bogut. The Warriors front office did an amazing job just in signing Iggy, let alone everything else they did, but that was made way easier by that Curry contract."
"Not much consideration is put into the player's not being able to drink celebrity bathwater. I know that I, I mean Kevin Durant, is greatful he will not be in the bubble so he can drink all the bathwater he likes."
"""You guys repeatedly lost to a team with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant haha what a bunch of scrubs"""
"Ingram had a turbulent start with the Lakers. It wasn't his fault. Kevin Durant had an incredible supporting cast back then. With Ingram now having Zion and Lonzo only getting better, don't be surprised if the Pelicans make a deep playoff run with Ingram's emergence."
I would still take Ingram for the next 10-15 years tbh. Tatum's comparison  is Pierce... Ingram's comparsion is Kevin Durant
"&gt;Would it be similar to the Kevin Durant situation?  Nah, I don't see any 73-9 teams out there"
Kevin durant had the coolest nickname of all time in slim reaper and decided to tell everyone to call himself the servant instead lol
Clearly he’s forgetting about Kevin Durant two and three years ago
Wonder if he has multiple dating profiles like Tom Haverford.  Kevin N. Durant - nerdy profile
"Kevin Durant: ""I play basketball, I got acne, I grew up with nothing, in still figuring myself out in my late 20, I slide in DMs, I make fun of my friends, I drink beers and play Xbox. I’m closer to you than u think"""
"Klay played in all 6 games against the Rockets last year. Regardless, here’s why it coulr be at least considered a “choke.” I’m focusing on offense because that’s Harden’s department:  Durant was by far our best scorer before going down. That sounds ridiculously obvious, but the distance between 1 and 2 was way larger than before because Curry was playing inconsistently early on in the postseason. So, Durant had a lot more of the scoring responsibility than we were used to seeing with the Dubs. Kerr was calling iso sets for Kevin because nothing else was working well consistently, and the Grim Reaper was snatching souls.   When Kevin goes down in the third quarter of G5, he was averaging 34 a game against the Rockets. Our next highest, Steph, was averaging like 21 on 43% and 32% from three. The team looked shook for the rest of that third quarter, as the Rockets outscored us like 30-15 to take a one point lead iirc. But in the 4th quarter with blood in the water, Harden proceeds to shoot the ball only three times with one free throw. Now, a lot of those passes were the right read, as the Dubs showed double-teams, but it just looked like James sort of packed it up to regroup for G6 at home and G7 back there in Oakland. Steph goes 3-7, 2-3 from deep, and 4-4 from the line for 12 points in the 4th, Dubs win by 5. Klay had a great first quarter (12 on 5/7), and hit a couple clutch shots in that fourth as well, finishing as the Dubs leading scorer with 27.  Here we go to game 6, back in Houston. No Durant to carry us, and you’d think Steph would need to put together 4 straight quarters of great basketball going in for us to have a chance. Thing is Klay, who had been having his own up and down playoffs, carried us on his back in that first half while Curry scored zero points. The second half, Steph went off for 33, including 23 in the series clinching 4th.   Thing is, Harden scored 35 in G6, but the devil’s in the details. First off, he went 7/12 from the line, as a career 87%. Let’s jump to that fourth quarter. James had two awful turnovers in the final few minutes of the game, including a weird hesitation fake then pass and a lazy inbounds after a made shot that took the air out of the entire building."
"Apparently it wasnt just the front office, [KD](https://arizonasports.com/story/1075896/kevin-durant-thunder-wanted-devin-booker-draft/) wanted him as well so pretty sure they were strongly planning on drafting him if he was available."
"&gt; getting a 40 year old pregnant,   Why does the age of the woman matter?  &gt; getting suspended by the Grizz for violating team rules, getting arrested for vandalism in college... and you can't see how he's a careless idiot?  Never said that at all. Stop putting words in my mouth. What I have said was:  1. Getting a woman pregnant specifically does not make him an idiot. Scroll up and that’s the original comment in this chain.  2. Being reckless off the court has never proven to have a direct correlation to on court impact. There are many, many, many talented players that have been problematic off the court. Kyrie Irving, Dennis Rodman, Demarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant have all had problems for their own reasons. Obviously, anyone with common sense knows Jackson will never be nearly as good as those players, but the point is on court impact has and will always be determined primarily by basketball aspects, specifically drafting, developing, and coaching. There is zero proven correlation that being a headcase = being a poor basketball player. That’s all I’m saying."
"Didn’t Toronto clap when Kevin Durant tore his ACL because that was the only way their poor franchise would only win a chip? Lmfao. Stay out of here with wack ass generalizations, because it’s so simple to say the same about you. I’m debating a child it seems."
I really thought PJIII was going to be a cross between Shawn Kemp and Kevin Durant. And then I thought he would be the perfect LeBron stopper. I also used to wear boot cut jeans so Ive had a lot of questionable opinions.
"PG- Magic, Steph, Zeke, Stockton  SG- Jordan, Kobe, Drexler, Ray Allen  SF- Bird, Durant, Dr J, LeBron  PF- Duncan, Garnett, Malone, Kevin McHale  C- Bill Russell, Kareem, David Robinson, Dream"
"He’s basically Kevin Durant, maybe more advanced then kd at the same age."
"DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant and JR Smith are black. They are allowed to be bigoted. They are oppressed.  Drew Brees is white. He is not allowed to be bigoted. He is privileged."
"I had never anticipated being able to group Stephen Jackson, DeSean Jackson, Hitler, Kevin Durant, Farrahkan and Mel Gibson together so easily.   2020 is quite a year."
"There were a lot of likes by a people on those posts (Kevin durant). And a lot of silence. Where is the denouncement of antisemitism? So far all I've heard is that people don't have any hate in their heart... But the Jews are behind some giant global zionist conspiracy (aka, evil). Sooo sorry I offended but not sorry.  Stephen Jackson kept saying he was speaking the truth. What truth is that? I'd like to know. And I'd like to hear some other leaders (lebron? Steph?) step up and denounce this."
"The biggest difference between KD’s move and Bron’s was the insane pressure put on to win a title. And like many others have said, Cleveland couldn’t help deliver as he was carrying bums to the finals. So he decides to leave and play with some talent to meet these expectations. Kevin Durant left his team after being up 3-1 and left the next season to join the 73 win team the following year. KD never even came close to the scrutiny James faced of his legacy and winning a title. And he leaves and joins that 73 win team. The Heat had to put an unproven team together and make it work, versus and turn key championship team. It’s not even close."
"The Warriors championships were won because of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Kevin Durant. They were irreplaceable. Iguodala could have been taken out of the equation and they would have won the same amount of rings. Not a HOFer"
"I get what you are going for but the only thing truly disgusting to see is the anti-semitism ... Zach banner said the right thing, now how about Jackson and Kevin Durant? This whole topic isn’t getting near enough attention in general especially given the context of the Drew brees incident and how that blew up."
"Kevin Durant. A GOAT level scorer, Extremely Versatile offensive weapon while Also Better than KG in the post season. KD was conducive to high level teams too.   KD’s 4-5 year Peak was also better.   KD’s 4 year regular season peak: 30/8/5 per 75 on 64% TS (+10.1 rTS), +9.8 BPM.  From 2010-2014, OKC played at a 60 win pace when healthy.   I’ll take the player that can just dominate a game offensively &amp; Bury the opposition."
They should cut him! how’s he any different than the alt right trolls from the in the internet !   Kevin Durant also needs to address his stupidity.  This is what happens when you give uneducated  huge platforms. They all are trying to out-woke one another !
He didn’t say anything that I know of. he was caught liking an Instagram post from an open anti-Semite.   https://nothinbutnets.com/2020/07/08/nets-kevin-durant-instagram-post-anti-semite-louis-farrakhan/
Im talking about the Steven Jackson post defending it lol. Go check it for yourself. Sorry your heroes are antisemitic.   Here’s something from the Desean Jackson one. Fairly easy to find.  “KD liked this now-deleted post and people were quick to notice it.”   https://fadeawayworld.net/2020/07/08/kevin-durant-caught-liking-an-ig-photo-of-anti-semite-louis-farrakhan-posted-by-desean-jackson/
"Kevin Durant liked the post.   Also, so we can’t make Kobe posts anymore when it doesn’t involve his on court stats since he’s retired? RIP. It’s the off season, make your own sub if you seriously think we can’t discuss ex NBA players on this sub lol."
And Kevin Durant liked desean’s anti-Semitic post on social media.
"lol can you not read? What does the first sentence of my post say? Black athletes have endorsed it. Not hard to check the post Desean Jackson made. Kevin Durant, JR Smith, and Steven Jackson to name a few."
Are you madly in love with Kevin Durant? Literally every single post I see you make on here is about him lmao. Not that you don't bring up good points regarding him but sometimes I wonder if you're a KD burner lol.
"Better then Brook? Maybe. I never said Brook was a better perimeter defender than Gobert. You’re the one arguing that Gobert is a versatile defender: he is not. Being better than Brook Lopez on the perimeter does not mean you are a perimeter defender. Gobert is a one dimensional rim protector. He is exceptional at it, but he is a rim protector. Versatile defenders are people like Robert Covington, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Paul George, Kevin Durant, etc. “Versatile defender” as a phrase is totally synonymous with “can guard multiple positions”. Rudy Gobert is too slow to effectively guard a modern NBA power forward. He’s a great defender, but he sure ain’t versatile."
Kevin Durant and J.R Smith did not praise hitler. In fact neither did DeSean Jackson or Stephen Jackson. So you can probably start with that reason.
What about kevin durant and JR smith?
"Kevin Durant, JR Smith, Jameis Winston, and Marquises Goodwin have all supported Stephen and or Desean Jackson."
"Grouping Kevin Durant in this and saying he ""praised Hitler"" is very disingenuous IMO. He liked a post picturing Louis Farrakhan. It could have been by accident, mindlessly, or without having context. I don't think it's fair to put KD and JR in that same sentence with those actively speaking out.  With that said, very disappointing to see Stephen Jackson triple down on this."
"&gt; Somehow DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler is getting less coverage than Drew Brees' comments.   He got hate for extremely mundane comments because he's white. Desean Jackson even doubled down on his comments and isn't getting more flack. Rules for thee..."
"Can you share the quote where Kevin Durant praises Hitler?   This is some ""look, everyone is racist, so BLM is a sham"" bullshit."
"&gt; Somehow DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler  Could OP or someone link me to each of these 4 people **""PRAISING""** Hitler?"
"This title should be edited. Kevin Durant didn’t like the Hitler post. He liked a picture of Farrakhan, likely not knowing who he was. Then unliked it an hour later (someone likely told him).  Both the Jacksons deserve flack though."
"Good point, I didn’t know that. However, I know for a fact he was a [Raptors fan.](https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/kevin-durant-wanted-to-play-for-the-toronto-raptors/)"
"I’m white too but let’s chill out. Making a big deal out of someone getting in less trouble because of their skin color is silly. Yeah, it’s not fair. But being offended isn’t gonna make anyone look any better. What did Kevin Durant say?   Also in case anyone didn’t know, the ZOG owns Google, most of social media, most of the mainstream media, the international banks, the entertainment industry, and many other businesses and industries that play large roles in your daily life. Jewish people really do control a lot of stuff and do whatever they can to keep it. This is not racism regardless of how many downvotes or idiotic replies I get, and everything I am saying is absolutely 100% true, you can verify it for yourself with a basic level of research."
Kevin Durant and Jr smith didn't praise hitler...
" Stephen Jackson transferred to Oak Hill for his senior year of high school. Kevin Durant attended 3 different high schools all of which are known for having strong basketball programs. JR Smith went to 4 different high schools and had to repeat his freshman year. DeSean Jackson is the only one who did not transfer high schools for sports; he went to Long Beach Polytechnic, which I don’t know much about academically. It is obviously an athletic powerhouse though.  American high schools have a sordid history of giving preferential treatment to student athletes. All 4 of these guys were all-American athletes in high school. What quality of education do you think they received in high school?  Desean Jackson spent 3 years at Cal. Stephen Jackson was academically ineligible to attend Arizona, so he went to 1 year of community college. KD spent 1 year at Texas. JR Smith has no college experience. None completed college during their first go. Apparently, KD went back and finished his BA in education. I did not find any evidence that the others have any degrees.  Several research studies have correlated social media use with belief in conspiracy theories. Now, combine these guys’ social media use with their lackluster educations. Now, give them fame and self-confidence that both come from being an elite athlete. This is the result. This is America."
"OP, can you point to where Kevin Durant ""praised Hitler?""  Are you referencing Durant liking one of Jackson's posts that had nothing to do with Hitler?"
"NBA players silent too and supporting this. Really shows the fucking hypocrisy.  When it was about HK protestors it was LeBron telling Morey he was ignorant.  When it's Desean Jackson posting Hitler quotes, Kevin Durant eats it up.  The whole minorities can't be racist narrative has gotta go."
"No, sorry Kevin Durant is a neo-Nazi now, that's the rules."
"As Kevin Durant on his main Reddit account, I approve this message and openly endorse it"
"I don't believe that is the case here considering that DeSean Jackson is from L.A., and Kevin Durant is from D.C."
"Kevin Durant did not praise Hitler, nor did he even like that IG story. He liked a different post that was a photo of Farrakhan."
"Disclaimer: I'm an eagles fan.   I want to see him cut, asap. I don't want to see him in a jersey again.   Anything short of direct and meaningful action to make amends for the issue is a failure on his and the teams part. Apologies are meaningless right now.   In regards to everything else, I'm not super into the rush for all athlete's to disavow him. I think that's largely performative. The default should be fuck that guy, so I don't need to hear every man, woman, Gary Neal, and child's take on twitter about it.   What concerns me the most are those who are supporting him or those ideas -- Kevin Durant, Stephen Jackson, Marquise Goodwin, etc etc. Fuck them too."
Bay Area market? Kevin Durant is the only NBA Star to sign with the Warriors. Klay Thompson forgot the Warriors even existed until he was drafted to them
"When it boils down to it, I just feel bad for DeSean Jackson and Kevin Durant. They had the opportunity to make the most out of their world class educations at UC Berkeley and UT Austin respectively, and yet, they chose to remain ignorant."
"Don’t let these people down, fuck Kevin Durant. He’s anti Semitic until proven otherwise. Why all of r/nba so willing to give him the benefit of the doubt is beyond me."
Insecurity. It’s Kevin Durant.
"I saw the DeSean Jackson apology but what did Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant, and JR Smith do? I haven't seen anything about them."
"When drew brees posted and got a lot of heat, it was from many more peers. Other football players, and even Lebron commented on Drew’s post. When DeSean posts that quote, Stephen Jackson supports it, Kevin Durant and JR smith openly support it. The difference is the fact that people who are on the same level in popularity and influence as these 2 players are openly supporting one post, and criticizing another post"
"Kevin ""Literally Hitler"" Durant"
Can we stop throwing Kevin Durant name into this? The guy already disliked the comment. Like stop trying to turn KD into something he's not.
"i'm not even gonna get into the matter itself, but saying ""kevin durant praising hitler"" is so bad faith. kd liked a picture of louis farrakhan and he's a hitler apologist now? i'm a kd hater and this is blown so far out of proportion it's genuinely making me mad lol"
"&gt;Somehow DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant and JR Smith praising Hitler is getting less coverage than Drew Brees' comments.  And they said the Jews controlled mass media."
I think saying what Kevin Durant and JR Smith did is 'praising Hitler' is pretty darn disingenuous.
"&gt;You betting a poll of younger African Americans being primarily anti-semitic is frankly irrelevant.  Not sure what you mean by ""primarily anti-semitic"". What I said is that antisemitism would still be fairly higher than a in other demos, like whites or hispanics.   &gt;Most hate crimes and documented bigotry in this country against jews has come from white people, and that isn't even up for debate. In this country or worldwide the answer is still white people shrugs.  In this country, sure, most of the country is white.   Your claim that the 8% of the world population that is white commits most crimes against jews is pretty amazing though. Source?   &gt;Also, it's amusing using two uneducated athletes who are only famous for their skill as some sort of barometer for how the community they comes from thinks. Kevin Durant and Desean Jackson are apparently black intellectuals according to the people on this subreddit lmao  Do you think intellectuals are more representative of any demographic than athletes?   And nobody said they represented the views of all African-Americans. Rather that their views are fairly popular and accepted.   Seriously, this isn't even a real discussion. I mean, this antisemitic trope (about how Jews aren't actually Semitic) is one of the trending threads on Lipstick Alley and has far more upvotes than downvotes."
"I think a decent number of people are just learning about black Hebrew nationalists as they don't have a presence everywhere, and are shocked by the mainstream athletes that support them, like seemingly kevin Durant and Jameis Winston. I think we should let people react appropriately to learning of a new hate group. If I just learned about the kkk, I'd be very vocal about it too"
"Wow well I have to give it to you, saying that James Harden is a more talented, skilled, and overall better basketball player than Kevin Durant definitely is an incredibly unpopular opinion.   I also disagree with your second point. Rankings should be predominantly based on how good a player was at basketball, with championships being used as more of a tiebreaker when you get to the top. I mean this is one of those times where you'd say ""Is Robert Horry the GOAT then?"""
"On June 29th, 1934  Adolf Hitler launched his ""blood purge"" of political and military rivals  in Germany in what came to be known as ""The Night of the Long Knives.""   On June 29th, 2019 Kevin Durant announced that he was leaving the Golden State Warriors after three seasons and signing with the Brooklyn Nets   Coincidence? I think not!"
"@kevinoconnornba reads Reddit and has a significant voice within the NBA.  Kevin: Please use your platform to condemn anti-Semitism and call on the NBA to take action against Jackson, Durant, and Smith."
"The reactions from users in regards to this situation showed me there is a massive lack of black people in this subreddit.  Not co-signing what DeSean Jackson said, but you guys are forreal flipping shit over Kevin Durant liking a post..."
"Haha JR Smith, Stephen Jackson, and Kevin Durant. Three massive brains."
Who the heck would of thought Stephen Jackson and Kevin Durant were far-right. 2020 is crazy.
Kevin Durant was drafted in 2007. But since he was really young when he was drafted he can still be a great player in 2020. But players like noah or other ppl who were older when they got drafted in 2007 arent as good in 2020. Because if you played all 4 years of college and got drafted in 2007 then in 2020 you are around the 34-36 age range and you arent as affective as you once were. But since kd is still in his early 30s hes still just as affective as hes always been. He hasnt started the washed process. And wont for another few years.
"Late to the thread but I just wanted to say fuck DeSean Jackson, fuck Stephen Jackson, fuck Kevin Durant, fuck JR Smith, oh and fuck everyone in the leagues who ain’t saying shit about this   That’s all"
"It's horrible, but it's also the most Brooklyn thing Kevin Durant has been a part of."
how good is Kevin Durant...
Kevin Durant isn’t good with the social media thing
And Kevin Durant and JR Smith seemed to echo his sentiments. Either those dudes just aren’t educated or they have a lot of hidden hate in their hearts.
"Kevin Durant must have a world record by now for ""accidental likes"" on instagram."
"I’d have to assume there was a valid reason, considering this post has been up for eight hours.  Edit: Both the Stephen Jackson and Kevin Durant threads are up and at the top of the sub? What am I missing?"
&gt; He is going to put up 25/5/5 on 45/35/80 splits  So he's gonna turn into a knock-off Kevin Durant?  Pigs might fly
"man is this that time again to hate on the jews? first its romans and Nero, then its medieval people saying jews are poisoning the wells, then its hitler and now worse of them all - Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant agreed as well?!?!?!
"&gt;this doesnt compare to brees. false equivalency.   It's nice to interact with someone on this site who can think. I mostly brought it up because that is what most of the whataboutism seems to revolve around in this case.  &gt; anyway the problem i have isnt that every black player hasnt condemned him, its that none have.   Why would any single black player have an obligation to comment on someone's ignorant post, especially in another league? Whether it's some or all?   &gt; some even liking the post lol like uh kevin durant.   I think we agree it's wrong to defend the post.   &gt;and i called that dramatic bc it was a spicy take. not the all caps. i understood why you put it in all caps.  Lol I'm just fucking around. I'm usually not so spicy so I didn't know how to react"
"Wow dude. What the fuck is going on. 2020 is unreal at this point. I knew this year still had crazy shit left in it but I definitely wasn't expecting it to add Kevin Durant, DeSean Jackson and Captain Jack to a list of people who dont like Jews and support Hitler quotes"
"This post is about Kevin Durant, champ. I don't blindly support LeBron, I don't support the holocaust and I don't think KD is an anti-Semite."
"Alright when other people see him they think of Kevin Durant the basketball player. It’s like what happened with Karl Malone, no one feels like seeing it every thread he’s involved in"
"You believe what you want to believe buddy, I’m not going to argue with you about this any further. But let me just respond to one thing you said. “He’s had plenty of time to clear the air.” To who? You think Kevin Durant is aware of some random guy coming to the conclusion he’s a Jew hater? A reddit post with a few thousand upvotes? What makes you even think he’s aware people are claiming he’s anti-Semitic? It’s ok, you don’t need to answer my questions. We both already know the answers."
Kevin Durant is the most self conscious weakling the NBA has ever seen.
It is pretty amazing how much shit Brees got considering this shit is getting liked by Kevin fucking Durant.
"The first quote there is actually from Khalid Abdul Muhammed who was later ostracized from Farrakhan's movement.  The second quote is aimed at white people generally and is not specifically anti-semitic.  The third quote is definitely an eyebrow raiser, but if you read the rest of the quote he actually condemns Hitler's genocide and describes him as a ""wicked killer."" He contextualizes the ""greatness"" as pertaining to leadership ability, not moral compass.  The rest of the quote is this: ""Now I'm not proud of Hitler's evil against Jewish people, but that's a matter of record. He rose Germany up from nothing. Well, in a sense you could say there's similarity in that we are rising our people up from nothing. But don't compare me with your wicked killers.""  That being said, I'm not trying to argue that Farrakhan isn't an anti-semite, only that the majority of his fanbase does not see him that way.  The speech in the post was talking about Bill Gates and vaccines-- it had nothing to do with Jews and Judaism-- so I think it's absurd to say that Jameis Winston or Kevin Durant are anti-semites just because they ""liked"" the post"
"this doesnt compare to brees. false equivalency. anyway the problem i have isnt that every black player hasnt condemned him, its that none have. some even liking the post lol like uh kevin durant.   and i called that dramatic bc it was a spicy take. not the all caps. i understood why you put it in all caps."
"They won't do anything, Kevin Durant will bring a lot of money in and they invested so much in him already to not even suit up for a game."
nba do the right thing as in what? release kevin durant? don’t be stupid.
"I understand that Farrakhan is important to Black empowerment. However, people should evaluate the message and the source of the message before perpetuating it, especially when they have a platform that reaches millions. Kevin Durant now holds a seat of power and influence and if we’re asking all members of society to carefully and earnestly evaluate our belief systems and learn from others then that is a standard we should all be held to. Racism and hate speech directed towards any group should be condemned and not deflected."
&gt; Kevin Durant is an anti-Semite. Let that sink in folks.   Imagine extrapolating all that from a person liking a Farrakhan post. The jacksons comments/posts were despicable. Lumping Kd in with those is a straight up clown move/making the comment you made based on what KD did is unbelievably moronic.  Edit:  &gt; Black privilege at its finest  Your race baiting is starting to make more sense.
Kevin Durant - Hitler was Right
"Kevin Durant:  ""Hitler did nothing wrong"""
"Black people are getting discriminated against and then guys like DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant getting on the media for also discriminating against Jewish people? I thought everyone was trying to be better, smfh"
"&gt;I want to give Kevin Durant the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he just is ignorant  Nobody gave Drew Brees the benefit of the doubt and he didn't openly endorse someone who supports Hitler."
"Hate to break it to people but BLM harbors large degrees of anti-semitism and [blacks are four times more likely to be anti-semitic than whites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American%E2%80%93Jewish_relations#Anti-Semitism_among_African_Americans).  All this despite the fact that American Jews overwhelmingly vote liberally and were at the forefront of the civil rights movement. Here's what else, the left will never hold these people accountable. They won't be cancelled. Imagine if a Jewish person posted quotes of a eugenicist that advocated for murdering every black person since they were inferior. That person would be ostracized and marginalized.  Guaranteed nothing happens to DeSean Jackson or Kevin Durant or JR Smith. They're able to hide behind their black pride veil and pretend like they didn't know that quoting Hitler maybe wasn't such a good idea (?).  Disappointing. I hope these leagues actually act like they're against all types of racism and not just the ones that are convenient to their bottom lines."
"Kevin Durant (2013-2019)   Regular Season:  29/8/5 per 75 on 64 TS% (+12 rTS%), +8.7 BPM, .260 WS/48  Larry Bird (1982-1988)  24/9/6 per 75 on 58% TS (+4.6 rTS%), +8.2 BPM, .231 WS/48  rTS -&gt; how much more/less efficient a player is than league average Per 75 -&gt; adjusts for pace   Kevin Durant (2012-2019)  Playoffs:   28/8/4 per 75 on 60 TS%, +7.4 BPM, .202 WS/48   Larry Bird (1981-1988)  21/9/6 per 75 on 56 TS%, +7.6 BPM, .186 WS/48   NBA Finals:  KD: 30/8/5 on 67 TS%, +11.1 BPM Bird: 23/12/6 on 54% TS, +3.6 BPM  KDs floor should be tier 3.

"Very disappointing, for many many reasons. Obviously first and foremost is the harm this brings to Jewish people. I think there's a lot of good discussion on that topic, I don't know if there's anything I can add without just re-stating things that have already been said (and said better than I could say).  These guys- Desean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Kevin Durant, anyone else involved- are misguided. They deserve criticism. They have a responsibility now to admit their mistake, vow to do better, and do better. This shouldn't be swept under the rug and ignored- I hope it is not.  What I don't want to see is to have this discredit the Black Lives Matter movement. Just as the people who took advantage of the protests to loot and cause destruction should not discredit the protests, these well-known figures propagating this horrible sentiment should not discredit the movement.   They are inexcusably wrong. They contributed to the harm of an entire group of people. All stereotyping, oppression, and any form of unfair treatment (including actions, words, or otherwise) to any group of people is wrong. It is incredibly hypocritical to demand equality for yourself, but to turn around and put someone else down. Whether it's the mistreatment due to of gender, culture, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, anything. And frankly it is beyond disappointing when I see someone speak up for one group of people but disregard another.  I don't think people should be expected to advocate for every group equally, but I 100% expect that if you advocate for one group, you absolutely should not do or say anything to another group that you would view as unfair or hurtful to the group(s) you belong to.   With that said, please remember that no individual person represents the sentiment that Black Lives Matter. No matter how misguided someone who advocates the idea may be, the simple fact is that Black people in this country are not treated equally and they should be treated equally.   There is a lot more I could say, but this feels long enough. I could acknowledge that it's not only Black people who are mistreated and over-policed, and those people should be fought for and treated better as well. I could go on and on. I gotta stop."
Kevin Durant is very good at basketball but is honestly not smart.
"So Kevin Durant is smarter that the average US citizen.. After walking around Walmart for an hour, I'm not impressed.."
"Ridiculous! How on earth could anyone possibly think that Kevin Durant and JR Smith are obtuse, narcissistic dunces?!  *Checks past decade of words and actions*  I see. Carry on."
"Kevin Durant is the most unlikable player in the NBA. Not even in an arrogant way that gets old white people mad, but just so dull and makes terrible decisions"
What were the words that Kevin Durant liked?
"I support the movement and protests, but the media seems to be ignoring racism from prominent Black individuals.  I'm not Jewish, but how are DeSean Jackson, Stephen Jackson, Jameis Winston, and Kevin Durant not getting absolutely roasted right now? It seems hypocritical."
"Maybe Desean Jackson, Kevin Durant, and Terry Crews are all wrong"
Stephen Jackson Kevin Durant all these guys should be fuckin ashamed of themselves
Nets that are out:  Deandre Jordan Spencer Dinwiddie Kyrie Irving Taurean Prince Kevin Durant  Tyler Johnson is going to average 50PPG.
"I mean I have a problem with the original post but I’m just as frightened, if not more, by the fuckin reactions. All the people on his Instagram post telling him he did nothing wrong? People like Marquise Goodwin, JR Smith, Kevin Durant, Stephen Jackson trying to justify this or tell him he did nothing wrong... fuck all you guys. As someone married to someone who is Jewish it’s fuckin offensive, especially given there is a lot of antisemitism in this country still.   I fully support BLM and all the social change going on but this is very enlightening as to who actually gives a fuck about what’s right and who is just ‘fighting’ because it benefits them."
That is an accurate description of Kevin Durant. How about you stop being a fuckin' coward.
"DeSean jackson, obviously.   Stephen Jackson, obviously.   Ice cube, obviously.   Kevin Durant, obviously.   Malcolm Jenkins fucking cried because Brees didn't support kneeling for the flag. His teammate professes support for Hitler and not one goddamn word from that fucking bigot.  The silence from people who have literally been out pushing ""silence is violence"" is deafening."
"Stephen Jackson is an anti-semite. Kevin Durant seemingly supports and shares anti-semetic views as well. Absolutely disgusting behaviour that needs to be condemned, this is unacceptable."
My name is Kevin Durant and I can't be anti-Semitic because I let my Jewish friend manage my money.
"I want to give Kevin Durant the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he just is ignorant to the anti-Semitism out of that man. But at the same time, ignorance when you have the resources of Kevin Durant is a choice.  But ain't no excusing DeSean Jackson. Fuck that guy."
"I don’t know if r/nba feels the same way, but r/nfl as a whole has been very disappointed about the overall public figure reaction (or I guess lack thereof) to DeSean Jackson’s post.   Players have been VERY quiet and not said a thing. These same players were all over Drew Brees within a matter of hours. To hear Stephen Jackson and apparently Kevin Durant are showing forms of approval of this is very discouraging to me."
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if there was a Kevin Durant like perimeter center player on offense and dpoy level center on defense in the near future
U/finger_waggle went ahead and did your work for you. I actually watched them in their primes so I don’t need the numbers but there you go. Especially check the playoffs. Then check yourself.

"Bro, Every single advanced metric that’s measures offense supports KD In the playoffs on offense. OWS, BPM, RAPM, LARAPM,etc. KD’s offensive impact is higher due to The scoring pressure I talked about    Again, Why ignore KD’s 2014 MVP season, where he shouldered the playmaking AND scoring load fine. 60 wins, top offense, etc.  Passing ability isn’t the only form of playmaking. Rubio is a better passer than KD but he’s not a better playmaker. KD offensive impact is through scoring pressure put on the defense. It creates so many open shots for teammates. MJ/Kobe had this scoring pressure as well. It’s why OKC ortg was the best in the playoffs with KD, and not even close to that without him. KDs offensive impact dwarfs hardens in the playoffs     Also, What superstar point guard did Durant have in 2014? He led them to a top 3 offense &amp; 60 win pace with no Westbrook in the lineup running an insane amount of PnRs. He can easily play the Harden role and has done it. The difference between the two is the playoffs where OKCs ortg was the league best with KD while Hardens wasn’t...even with CP3.  KD didn’t get crushed due to playmaking against Memphis, He lost because Kevin Martin was his second best player against an elite team. It had more to do with not having a single perimeter threat than actual playmaking.  Besides, What has harden done without CP3 in the playoffs? Lost to spurs without Kawhi in 2017, Lost to Steph less warriors in 2016, The rockets came back when he was on the bench against the clippers.....  Your basketball knowledge is just limited. There’s varying kinds of playmaking too.  While he's not a hugely proactive playmaker, his scoring gravity simplifies reads and he's adept at executing difficult passes:  Kevin Durant  is a really strong testament to the concept of scoring gravity simplifying playmaking for lead guards. He's a good passer, not elite but creates so many open shots by being a lethal scoring threat.  He’s a better offensive and defensive player than Harden in the playoffs &amp; regular  season when KD played that role (2014)....  KD’s only being a scorer is Such an idiotic Take in 2020. His game is far more complete than hardens"
Bol bol is what Kevin Durant could’ve been if he didn’t lie about his height

Kevin Durant got taller?
Kevin Durant! All 4 answers
Kevin Durant.
You spammed advanced analytics that you didn’t understand and tried to convince me that Stephen Curry was now a better defensive player than Kevin Durant because on/off told you so.   Did you think I was actually going to continue and take you serious??
"I just posted them. Listen to what David West says.   He called Curry the alpha dog pretty much. Compared him to Tim Duncan in San Antonio. Said it was his team, his locker room.   He's calling him the undisputed leader on a team with Kevin Durant.   Of course Steph made some sacrifices, nobody said he didn't."
"Also, I just watched that David West video. Did you pay attention to what he said?   West is calling Curry the unquestionable leader of Golden State with Durant there.   All he's doing is talking about how Golden State is his team and compares him to Tim Duncan in San Antonio.   He's saying Steph didn't need the ball every play down the stretch in order to lead the team.   Said the locker room and culture was ""Steph""   Again, you are wondering why Steph overshadowed KD. Look no further than the video that you just posted. David West just gushed non stop about him being the leader on a team with Kevin Durant."
"I feel like you’re talking about the players feelings and I’m talking about historical recognition. Curry was absolutely more loved by Bay Area fans but that’s pretty irrelevant in terms of how the team will be remembered historically. The national narrative at the time and the historical narrative of the warriors during this time will be all about Durant at the peak of his powers, and wether people count that fully since he had such an absurd supporting cast.  regular season usage rate isn’t a good measure of deference. What matters is who has the ball in key moments when the team needs a bucket, and without fail that was always unquestionably Durant. It was the whole reason he was brought in, curry is too short to get good shots off consistently in the tight moments of high stakes games. Here’s what David west had to say about the topic https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/david-west-outlines-how-warriors-steph-curry-deferred-kevin-durant . Also all three playoff runs with Durant curry had lower usage than he did in the previous two years when the warriors were actually his team."
"https://youtu.be/mWQXKr6C4Z0  35 seconds in fades over the help after beating Gallo  1:52 turns over the opposite shoulder of where Lou Will is coming (giving Durant an entire side of the court is something Kerr did to stop the corner traps from happening with Dray and Iggy)   3:45  He gets double and passes here but this play just shows why it’s hard to double him anyways. He relocated and just shoots before another double could possibly come.   3:58   Another screen trap   That’s all skimming one 5 minute highlight video that doesn’t even include misses. And I purposely picked game 6 since you implied it didn’t happen in there.   The only difference and why Doc has more players guard Durant was because he starting doing exactly what he didn’t want to do in the first place. Look at the “I’m kevin Durant” rant, he specifically mentions that he could sit here and shoot over Bev, but it wouldn’t be that high percentage of. After the rant, he did just that and just made it an incredible rate, forcing Doc to put someone taller on him.   There’s not anything you can do when he’s literally catching and shooting in someone’s face or walking up the court and pulling up."
Top 5. Best in the East. I’m not doubting Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant and Phillip Lindsay
Which NBA superstars can be their best or close to their best without specific personnel fits around them?  LeBron James. Kevin Durant.  Kawhi Leonard.  That’s it. The truly transcendent trio.  Curry needs a heavy screening scheme in a Kerr offense to be impactful.
"definitely not trading for kevin durant, is what you’re saying?"
"I'm late to the party, but Kevin Durant, or a healthy Chandler Parsons?"
I think a lot of star guards could do that given prime Kevin Durant beside them though. I think in terms of being the #1 guy Ja will have more success.
lol i agree with exactly everything you said. I just don't think we'll see another Kevin Durant for awhile.
"I'm just talking about his unique skill set that i appreciate as a basketball player. IMO, we'll see another Steph Curry before we see another Kevin Durant is what i'm trying to get at."
Kevin Durant after the the Thunder lost to the Golden State Warriors before he switched teams
Number 1 has to be those kids who think Kevin Durant is some 7 foot AI/shaq demigod who can score from halfcourt with ease lmao
"If you ask me which player I want to have in a game 7 right now (healthy), I would take Kevin Durant, but of those 2 I'd still take Lebron. But Giannis will take this very soon as well, I assume."
Kevin Durant will never be a top 10 player in the NBA again.
"Just going by top 25-ish guys in my opinion  * Michael Jordan: 69 (nice) * Lebron James: 61 * Kareem-Abdul Jabbar: 55 * Magic Johnson: 46 * Bill Russell: 37 * Wilt Chambelain: 100 * Larry Bird: 60 * Tim Duncan: 53 * Hakeem Olajuwon: 52 * Kobe Bryant: 81 * Shaquille O'Neal: 61 * Oscar Robertson: 56 * Jerry West: 63 * Moses Malone: 53 * John Havlicek: 54 * Karl Malone: 61 * Kevin Garnett: 47 * Kevin Durant: 54 * Steph Curry: 54 * Julius Erving: 45 * Isiah thomas: 47 * John Stockton: 34 * Bob Cousy: 50 * Rick Barry: 64 * Bill Walton: 36 * David Robinson: 71  so unsurprisingly its john stockton, the Bill Walton and Russell. I know he was injured a lot but you'd think he'd have scored more. also shows basically that all the greats had huge games. On this list alone, 20/25 have scored above 50."
now its time to ask him about Jews. Lets find out if he is in the Stephen Jackson/Kevin Durant school.
"There's a short summary on Wikipedia about his story there:  &gt; Stoudmire was raised Baptist.[83] Although in a 2010 interview, Stoudemire said, ""I have been aware since my youth that I am a Hebrew through my mother, and that is something that has played a subtle but important role in my development."" He visited Israel that year, saying he intended ""to get a better understanding of [his] heritage.""[84][85][2] Traveling with Stoudemire was Idan Ravin, who works as a private coach for many NBA players who include LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony.[86][87]   &gt; During the trip, Ravin linked Stoudemire's language skills to his ability to decipher defensive schemes on the court. Ravin also worked with Stoudemire on a daily basis during the trip.[88][89] Stoudemire was named an assistant coach of the Canadian basketball team for the 2013 Maccabiah Games, giving him an opportunity to return to Israel.[90] In July 2013, Stoudemire met with Israeli president Shimon Peres, who urged him to join the Israel national basketball team.[91] In a 2010 interview, Stoudemire was asked if there was a chance he was Jewish, Stoudemire said ""I think through history, I think we all are"". However, he was not able to confirm if he had any Jewish roots (he was previously speaking about his mother's alleged Hebrew heritage).[2][92]   &gt; Stoudemire is associated with the Hebrew Israelite community.[2][93] In April 2018, Stoudemire reportedly began converting to Judaism.[94] In January 2019, Stoudemire was granted residency in Israel.[95] In March 2019, he received Israeli citizenship, and he also adopted the name Jehoshaphat.[2][96]"
"Yeah I was actually going to say he's like a poor man's Jeff Green but didn't know if that would get lost in translation because Green actually produces.   Hezonja is among the most frustrating players I've ever watched.   He is a terrible defender but occasionally he'll play fantastic defense on LeBron or giannis. He'll get torched by a replacement level small forward though.   He's got very good vision. It's completely viable to play him at point guard but the vast majority of the time he makes terrible decisions.   He's capable of shooting, shooting off movement, and shooting from considerable distance but doesn't make them enough to be considered a shooter.   He's hyper athletic. He can take guys off the dribble and finish through contact. He can get tip dunks over centers. He just never does that.   He's incapable of being a role player. If he stands in the corner for a few possessions without having anything to do he loses all interest in the game. But if circumstances developed where you lost a ton of starters and were forced to run the offense through him he'd be completely capable.   The magic had a ton of injuries stacked up in 2018 and he had a 13 game stretch where he averaged 16 PPG on 48/46/85 shooting. But for some reason he can't even translate his game into a typical 8th man role.   If he ever finds his way to a non-nba team that makes him a number one option the dude is going to be the Kevin Durant of whatever league that is."
Kevin Durant
What’s the connection between Jamal Murray and Kevin Durant that makes this relevant?
Is he?  https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-trey-kerby/dwight-howard-choose-kevin-durant-over-lebron-james--nba.html
"Yes, I too love Kevin Durant and I think he’s top ten all time"
"&gt; 16/10/3 on 50% is nice but that’s litterally a role player maybe a higher tier role player.   Damn, good thing being the entire center of portland's defense means absolutely nothing. Good thing passing out of the high post means nothing. Good thing pick and rolls mean nothing. It's almost like you don't watch the blazers. WILD.  &gt;Also are you acting like not having Kevin fucking Durant is not a big deal?  You mean the same team that won numerous championships without KD and gave up nothing to get KD? YEA, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M SAYING. They already had a dynasty without kd, numnuts."
If he is not a role player what is he then a star??? 16/10/3 on 50% is nice but that’s litterally a role player maybe a higher tier role player. By that same logic is Serge Ibaka also a star this year? He’s averaging 16/8/2 and shooting 40 percent from three does that make him a star like Nurkic?  Also are you acting like not having Kevin fucking Durant is not a big deal?
"The team that went 73-9 trades Harrison Barnes for Kevin Durant. Hmmm, this is a tough one..."
"Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are literally two of the greatest mid range shooters of all time. Them shooting mid rangers is a positive, not a negative. Having a versatile offence is a positive, not a negative. When the Rockets went 0-27 on threes I bet they would have loved a couple of CP3 mid rangers to spark the offence when things got cold."
Kevin Durant just entered the chat.
"Lillard is super sensitive like Kevin Durant. He cares waaay too much about what people are saying about him. I guarantee he will leave the Blazers at some point to get an easy ring just like KD left the Thunder, so he can “prove the doubters wrong.” Lillard is perpetually unhappy... always angry about something. It’s only a matter of time..."
"The Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond fat heads are gonna be up for awhile then lol"
Kevin durant and khris middleton
"Never in my life would I have expected the Nets to be 5-2 in the bubble while missing Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and DeAndre Jordan. They were also missing Caris Levert, Jarrett Allen, and Joe Harris for 2 of the games that they've won. And this is going up against teams like the Clippers and the Bucks too. It has been so fun!"
Lmao my mom knows obvious ones like lebron Durant and curry she watches the finals and some random games with me and my brothers .. she learned about kawhi last year in the finals she knows about Kyrie Bc Gsw /Cleveland series .. she knows harden as the beard guy and Ad As the unibrow guy .. she thinks westbrook is funny looking and exciting to watch ...I’m pretty sure she knows gIannis not 100 percent sure tho ... she doesn’t know Kevin love by name but would always asks who the hot guy that’s wearing number 0 everytime she catches a game he’s playing in
"Yup y'all won the chip because of... Lemme see...   Oh.  Kevin Durant getting injured, Klay Thomson getting injured, and betraying your franchise player."
I don’t think so. Remember that on their championship teams that they had Kevin Durant and Harrison Barnes at the 3. Now they have Wiggins. I also think that their bench was depleted a lot since last year. They may have one of the worst benches in the league next year if they don’t sign some free agents.
"Maybe contenders but favourites you are out of your mind. You had Spurs, Rockets, Cavs not to mention okc if durant had stayed. you can’t really believe that Kevin Durant wasn’t a huge reason why the warriors won."
"Chuck on jobs: "", I'll tell you, there's five real jobs in the world: teacher, fireman, policeman, doctor, and somebody who's in the armed services. Those are five real jobs. I dribbled a basketball my entire life, and now I get paid to watch LeBron James and Kevin Durant play.""  I love the ""five real jobs"" thing. Reminiscent of Michael Scott: ""There are four kinds of business: tourism, food service, railroads, and sales. And hospitals/manufacturing. And air travel."""
"Gary Trent Jr. is on his way! He's neither of course, but he's the first one to come to mind when considering this question for me. He needs a full 2 seasons to get to elite level, but I see the potential right now!   Kevin Durant? Kawhi? Kyrie? Lillard? Booker? Last two prolly not elite D.  Certainly not Korver or Reddick, right? Do some people consider them elite shooters? I don't.  Certainly not Harden? D is improving but far from elite.  I'll go with Durant, Kawhi, and Kyrie. Thompson is tragically underrated, but that's kinda what makes him special (besides his elite 3&amp;D)."
He’s Kevin Durant. Y’all know who he is
"LOWER defensive rating is BETTER. Defensive Rating measures the amount of points per 100 possession given up when that player is on the court.   HIGHER offensive rating is BETTER. Offensive Rating measures the amount of points per 100 possession scored when that player is on the court.   So Klay is a better defender as indicated by the stats (108 for Klay, 115 for CJ), which back up my point that the two players are not identical. In addition Klay is a more efficient scorer with a career 58% TS, and McCollum with a career 55% TS. In the playoffs, this becomes 53% TS for McCollum and 56%TS for Klay, so the difference still there.  Continuing off that, this means that Stephen Curry dominates Damian Lillard Offensively AND Defensively. He has a 5 point higher defensive rating and 7 point higher offensive rating. So these are NOT comparable. Curry also has a greater WS/48 and BPM than Damian Lillard. He is more efficient (62%TS vs. 58%TS) also. There is almost no metric that will support that Damian Lillard is on par to Curry  So the stats you brought up help prove my point. There is a reason Golden State consistently was at the first seed even before Kevin Durant came. Stephen Curry has been head and shoulders above other point guards in the league."
"In the era of Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry and James Harden- not alot of mvps and chips going around. Y'all want Lillard to do what, sit down and shut up like he's a bum entitled to no opinion? Stop it."
"No lmao:  \- Curry, Thompson, and Green are in fact all over 30 years old. Thompson is coming back from a major injury.   \- The death lineup is gone (they’re missing Andre Iguodala and a 3&amp;D wing). They don’t have Kevin Durant anymore and nobody is replacing the elite defense and good playmaking that Iguodala brought to the table).   \- Andrew Wiggins ranges from bad to mediocre. He offers nothing aside form scoring and he isn’t even an efficient scorer or good shooter.  The only opinion there is that they aren’t gonna make the Finals, which seems pretty likely considering that their defense will still be dogshit. The Lakers and Clippers will be better next season."
"Brooklyn Nets. They’ll be contenders next year with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Historically not a good team, they’ve only won 2 ABA titles in the 70s. Cool uniforms, awesome arena and a great broadcast team."
Hell the same Clipper team hes roasting (minus PG obvisouly) took TWO games off the Warriors last offseason. That was WITH Kevin Durant. Dames team blew all 4 games last year and got swept.
I'd say Kevin Durant is pretty recognizable. Probably the 3rd most if active players behind Lebron and Steph.
A real hero would have joined the Raptors in 2016. You missed your chance Kevin Durant.
Hopefully this post stays up and gains traction  NBA needs to learn that middle America is tuning them out because players all act like costal elites. Making their way to Los Angeles doesn’t play well in the rest of the country   Players staying where they were drafted is good for a league. Aaron Rodgers feels like a Packer. Matt Stafford is a Lion. Russell Wilson is a Seahawks.  LeBron is a mercenary. Kevin Durant is a mercenary. Kawhi is a mercenary. Anthony Davis is a mercenary.
"Kevin Durant, because he couldn't win in OKC, and so he switched teams. Fuck KD, man, he traitored on the Thunder.  Raymond Felton - He came to training camp out of shape for Portland nearly a decade ago and was just complete trash all season.  Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Steph Curry - tired of hearing about these guys.  James Harden - 'nuff said  Any player on the Nuggets except Will Barton  Any player on the L*kers"
Chris Bosh and Kevin Love said that it was frustrating and difficult playing with LeBron. Kevin Durant also said some players opted against signing with the Lakers due to the attention and media LeBron attracts.
"&gt; “Some days I hate the NBA,” Kevin Durant says wearily.   Poor Kevin."
"Can all of you guys please stop trying to force this ""3rd star"" narrative for the Lakers? Why can't we just say that Kyle Kuzma has been a pretty good 2 way role player so far in the Orlando bubble? Not everybody has to be a star. Just be a star in your role and you're all good lol  Not every team has to have 3+ stars like the Kevin Durant Golden State Warriors to be a championship contender for most years you know lol"
"You mean Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson?"
Kevin Durant is the ultimate cheat code.
Holy shit people in here are overreacting more than they did when he put up kevin Durant numbers for 5 games
"&gt;I'm really not worried about AD lol Jokic turns up in big games and AD turns down. LeBron is obviously terrifying tho, so he might create enough spacing for AD to do something.  Sorry for the late reply lol my bad, I meant to reply to this comment last night but I got tired.  Anyways, I think that's kind of a silly statement. If I was a Denver Nuggets fan, I'd be worried about both the Lakers superstars if I were to go against them in a 7 game series where they go all out. Anthony Davis has averaged 30 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 2.33 blocks on 60.4% TS% in 3 games against the Denver Nuggets this season. Nikola Jokić has averaged 17.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 0.66 blocks on 59.4% TS% against the Lakers in 3 games this season. Mind you that Anthony Davis has locked down Nikola Jokić in the clutch this season multiple times, which is very hard to do since Nikola Jokić is really freaking good. I really Nikola Jokić too. So yes, you should at least be slightly worried about Anthony Davis regardless since he's a monster on the defensive end as well. Anthony Davis is a top 2 or 3 Defensive Player of the Year candidate this season for a reason (rhyming accidentally lol), he has the ability to really affect a game on the defensive end while putting up a very efficient 30 points and 10 rebound double double. It's kind of hard to ""overrate"" that when Anthony Davis is considered a top 5-7 player in the NBA this season and some past seasons, depending on if you count Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry this season due their unfortunate injuries.  And not to mention that Anthony Davis is definitely best at the center position due to spacing, where he'll play more often in the NBA Playoffs, where his numbers will definitely go up. AD didn't want to be a full-time center during the regular season because of wear and tear, which makes sense. He plays center with the bench unit and during most closing lineups depending on the matchup. He's played about 40% of his possessions this season at the center position according to CleaningTheGlass's website. He's said he's fine with playing at the center position when the games really matter, aka the NBA Playoffs lol  Anyways, sorry for the lengthy reply, my bad lmao 😂😂😂"

Kevin Durant is going to fit into any system.. provided there is a system.    There was no system in OKC in a “your turn my turn” offense with WB.  Him replacing Harrison Barnes but being a legitimate scorer is all he needed to be.
He managed to perfectly add Kevin Durant into a an already perfectly run system
I thought we were talking about Kevin Durant? Yeah lebron did do that. Lukas taken his team to the playoffs at age 21. Lebron was also in the east when he took the cavs to the finals at 22.
"you honestly believe that Kevin Durant tweeted out ""my bad my phone accidentally did that"" because he thought people would think it was the truth?  If that's what you think, then man I have a bridge to sell you"
"LeBron, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russel Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Davis are all more famous in America than Luka or Giannis."
Hypothetically Kevin Durant will come back as the best player in the league after a year and a half of rest
"Damian Lillard might be the most sensitive athlete I’ve ever seen. I like his game, but I can’t root for him knowing what a baby he is. I’d love to see what would happen if he and the 2nd biggest baby, Kevin Durant, ever got in one of these social media fights. There might be enough tears to fill an arena in Orlando."
Kevin Durant
I would like to raise you 1 Kevin Durant. Honestly i think they’re tit for tat.
A writer once put an old injured dirk nowitzki in front of a prime Kevin Durant for all nba first team because he was a blazers fan and didn’t like the thunder.
God bless Kevin Durant. I’m all for people talking crazy about others on the internet getting absolutely pressed for it
"Paul George is a really good player but not quite good enough to exempt him from being judged for his softness. He’s accomplished nothing of marked substance and he’s forced his way out of multiple situations while under contract that aren’t all *that* bad. Kevin Durant can spend every waking second off the court whining at twitter trolls, show up to play in an adult diaper, cry after every loss, and I still won’t consider him less than a bad f’n man. Because yeah he’s bitch, but what else is he, one of the ten best hoop talents ever? Durant’s softie factor is probably stronger than PG’s even,don’t matter, poll every single NBA player and they would unanimously tell you they’d rather see PG warming up on the other end as opposed to KD."
"I'd actually take a look at the defending champion raptors. they lost their biggest superstar and are looking fantastic. It's like the opposite of when the warriors added Kevin Durant.  They have a fun roster, killing it when it comes to short beefy point guards. Kyle Lowry can absorb contact like a rugby player it's wild."

The Celtics were expected to beat them before the season started. You forget the expectations on that Celtics team. Kevin Durant even publicly said he expected to see them in the finals.

im convinced if Kevin Durant and Kyrie were back we would win the finals.
"lol for real like really  &gt; All u do is tweet about ball and you’re probably trash. I play but when I tweet about it, ima dork.

"Since the offseason last year? Kawhi and Paul George are now on the Clippers, Kyrie and Kevin Durant are on the Nets, Jimmy Butler is on the Heat, the Warriors were injured so they’re at the lowest seed and most importantly, TJ “Bubble God” Warren was traded to the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations"
Emoni Bates is a sophomore in high school that's basically Kevin Durant 2.0  This gets thrown around a lot whenever there's a lanky kid but watch some of his games and you'll see he's a fucking beast
"Draymond, Kevin Durant, LeBron, Jokic/JR/Swaggy"
"Kerr appeared on ""The Lowe Post Podcast"" with Zach Lowe and ranked unanimous Finals MVP Kevin Durant - not Stephen Curry - as the second-best player in the world behind LeBron James. Third place in Kerr's mind goes to Kawhi Leonard for his two-way impact.  ""There's nobody who impacts the game like Kawhi,"" Kerr said. ""LeBron is the best player in basketball, we know that, and KD is right there with him. But in terms of just the regular season, the impact on both ends, the impact on wins ... Kawhi is a devastating two-way force and in the end that's really what wins."" Same applies to giannis who is a big elite 2 way wing."

I guess man. If this was a normal guy that you happened to know youd probably say he's a weirdo lol  But he's kevin durant so everything he does is respectable.  He's like that guy you went to high school with that gets in arguments on facebook all the time for no reason.    I see you kevin lmao.
Throwing Dame in the same sentence as Tim Duncan on a thread about Kevin Durant was kind of the red flag.
I love kevin durant.
I know Zee’s girl is PISSED once she found out who Kevin Durant was 😭😭  Like why you fumbling her bag? She trying to do things with KD that’s outta your budget man
"It is just like how last year's Clippers physically stressed our the Warriors and indirectly caused the Kevin Durant injury.  It is very smart, although at this point Suns may be the better team lol."
"Kevin Durant/ Kyrie Irving and the Nets, they just seem like unlikable teammates"
Him saying “I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am.” And then the Lou will saying “I promise we tried” when a reporter asked about guarding him was one of my favorite moments in the playoffs
"AD, LeBron, Giannis, Harden, Westbrook, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant... they're not in order, but Luka needs a bit more games before saying top 5 and it's easily seen he's better than ones I mentioned"
Its absolutely obvious to anybody who watches basketball that Kevin Durant is capable of being the best player on a championship team. Not really sure how to explain it any more simply than that.
Yeah I'm sure he and KD had [*zero* talks before Free Agency](https://www.si.com/nba/2017/06/12/golden-state-warriors-kevin-durant-nba-championship-draymond-green-text).
"Lol no. Draymond has publicly called out the Suns in the past for not developing Marquese Chriss properly. He literally called the Suns and other bad teams “shitty organizations”. You think just because he was on TV this time the NBA cares? No, it’s because whether it was a joke or not, what he said sounds like tampering and the NBA has to be consistent. We gonna act like Draymond doesn’t have a history of actually tampering? Remember when he tried to recruit Kevin Durant to the Warriors via text?"
Kevin Durant is one of the 10 best players to ever play the game
**Offense:**  - LeBron James  - Michael Jordan  - Larry Bird  - Kevin Durant  - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar    **Defense:**  - Kobe Bryant  - Kawhi Leonard  - Scottie Pippen  - Kevin Garnett   - Hakeem Olajuwon  No small ballers in my lineups
Kevin Durant if he had balls
Kevin Durant will never be as good as he was pre-injury.
"Because Durant was taking self created, highly contested 3s while every single other person you named is being left WIDE OPEN to shoot. Kevin Martin folded every year he was there. Fisher was like 40 when he played there. The best shooters they had once Harden left were Daequan Cook and Anthony Morrow. Neither of which got tick because they couldn’t play defense"
"All good defenders have lists like this.    [Here's Jaylen Brown's from a year ago:](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/azw8q4/jaylen_brown_defense_vs_matchups_this_year/)  &gt; Paul George: 52 possessions, 6/14 shooting, 2/7 from 3, 43/29 shooting splits, &gt;  &gt; Blake griffin: 60 possessions, 4/9 shooting, 0/2 from 3, 2 turnovers, 44/0 shooting splits, &gt;  &gt; Devin Booker: 51 possessions, 5/14 shooting, 2/6 from 3, 3 turnovers, 36/33 shooting splits &gt;  &gt; Zach Lavine: 45 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 0/4 from 3, 40/0 shooting splits &gt;  &gt; Donovan Mitchell: 35 possessions, 4/11 shooting, 2/7 from 3, 2 turnovers, 36/29 shooting splits, &gt;  &gt; Kevin Durant: 27 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 0/3 from 3, 40/0 shooting splits &gt;  &gt; James harden: 25 possessions, 4/10 shooting, 3/8 from 3, 40/38 shooting splits &gt;  &gt; Bradley Beal: 22 possessions, 1/3 shooting, 0/2 from 3, 2 turnovers, 33/0 shooting splits &gt;  &gt; Jimmy butler: 21 possessions, 0/2 shooting, 0/1 from 3, 0/0 shooting splits  [And then some more:](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/ayfjge/jaylen_browns_recent_defensive_matchups/)  &gt; Buddy Hield: 16 poss / 0 pts 0-3 FGA  &gt; Kevin Durant: 17 poss / 4 pts 2-6 FGA &gt;  &gt; James Harden: 14 poss / 4 pts 1-5 FGA &gt;  &gt; Eric Gordon: 10 poss/ 0 pts 0-1 FGA &gt;  &gt; Bradley Beal: 22 poss / 2 pts 1-3 FGA &gt;  &gt; CJ McCollum: 17 poss / 7 pts 3-6 FGA   Every good defender has these sort of lists, and tbh, Mattisse's doesn't even look that impressive.   Although I do think he's a nice defender."
"game 7, no CP3  Harden vs Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green.  &amp;#x200B;  Was winning at the half.   &amp;#x200B;  As a team had to brick more 3s than ever before"
Put yourself in a Blazers fan's shoes. They took Sam Bowie over MJ and then years later they took Greg Oden over Kevin Durant. Let that sink in.
Kevin Durant
"No it certainly wasn’t. Clippers employed one of the weirdest defenses of the KD Warriors era where they essentially left whoever was in the corner to completely take out both Durant and Curry.   In KDs “I’m kevin Durant” rant, he basically describes it and says that he could shoot over them at a decent clip, but that’s not the most efficient basketball. After that ... he basically shot over them... just at a ridiculous clip. Basically through the Clippers defense into disarray and Bev had to be taken off of him much more.   After the series we all saw the press conference when Lou Will and Pat Bev said they tried every type of defense to stop him and it didn’t work. Doc Rivers said he’s the single most difficult guy to defend.   I just didn’t include it because it came to an end too quickly. But yeah, that’s arguably the greatest Kevin Durant of all time as well"
"...no? Why is the only options horrible and the greatest shooting backcourt ever. Put 2017 KD on any contender, he’s putting up all time great playoff performance. I watched him for half my life, that was not a normal Kevin Durant that was playinf.   Simple fact of the matter is Rockets at their peak had Harden still isoing and for the most part, people weren’t leaving their man unlike this year. I’m not leaving PJ Tucker open in the corner, just like I’m not leaving Klay. They don’t have to be the same caliber, no one is putting two on Klay or Steph OFF THE BALL purposely. 5 out spacing is easily comparable with Steph Klay and two non shooters.   You can say it’s significantly easier to score but you can actually watch the shots Durant was taking. Do those look like easy shots? Does a pull up in LBJ face for the win change if he’s on a different team?"
You mean like when he played with Kevin Martin and Derek Fisher? Can they shoot? Even Serge Ibaka was shooting 3s he was one of the best big men 3 point shooters and he led the league in blocks.   Durant only shot 28% from 3 in the 2016 WCF. Westbrook shot 31% Ibaka shot 34% Roberson shot 44% Dion Waiters shot 31%. Durant was the worst of them all!
If TJ Warren can continue to play like peak Kevin Durant then why not?
That snakes name? Kevin Durant.
It's really not. Kevin Durant is a better scorer. What was Michael's 3 point play like?
[Kevin Durant to agent after leaving OKC: 'Why the fuck did you let me do this to my life?'](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-rich-kleiman-agent-stephen-curry-team-usa/wexc7webicqb156w10nt97e1y)
Kevin Durant is by far and miles the most insecure lol
“Warriors open” isn’t a real thing. It’s that simple. It just sounds good and it helps discredit both Curry and KD.   Having two defenders stuck to two elite shooters doesn’t automatically morph the rules of basketball and all of sudden turned recorded contested shots into open.   Kevin Durant is known for shooting over people. It’s that simple.
When I see Murray and all I can think of is Kevin Durant
Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan   Greg Oden over Kevin Durant   DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE OUR PAIN
Yo this is some delusional homer shit if I’ve ever seen it. KD? Kevin fucking Durant?? Cmon now.
Doc Rivers got the team fined for praising kawhi while he was in the playoffs last season. Doc also praised potential free agent Kevin Durant but there was no fine for that so it was a response to the season long courting the clippers did for Kawhi.
"How sadistic of me laughing at the fact that nba superstar, 2 time champion, 2 times finals MVP, and future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant argues with 14 year olds on twitter regularly?! Lol"
"I watched the series back twice during Covid 19. They 100% doubled KD and trapped him anytime he tried to dance into a mid post iso. He talked about this in his interview ‘I’m Kevin Durant’ how they’re always shading him with people. He actually had a poor first two games bc of the game planning for him. In game 3 he adjusted by literally shooting 3-4 seconds in the shot clock at every opportunity. Like he wouldn’t let the defense key in, After 4 seconds, He would either shoot or pass.  In the Pelican series, They were a good defense with jrue/AD as linchpins. I remover Pelicans doubling him everytime in the post as he found shooter after shooter.  As for the Cavs series....they were just inconsistent in their gameplan. I think Steph attempted 18 more shots than KD in the 2018 finals, Many of them wide open, so the presumption that Steph was guarded more is not true"
"“Their offense was much better with Kerr running through Curry”  Again, Out of the three years, The warriors had the best offensive rating in the regular season in guess which year? 2019. The year that they played through KD on offense https://imgur.com/a/hX5QDjt.   The KD-centric warriors last regular season ran the best offense in league history (Prior to Dallas this year).......So no, The warriors running through Curry wasn’t better at all. Don’t lie.  “It doesn’t seem like Draymond and KD played more minutes together”   Expect they did.......KD and Draymond played their highest % of minutes together of the 3 years when you allocate for % of minutes played.  “From what I saw it’s clear Cavs prioritized Curry”  Again....Based on what? Stephen curry attempted 18 more shots than Kevin Durant in the 2018 finals. Why did the Cavs defense let Curry shoot 18 more times (many of them open) if they prioritized him over KD.....A lot of those shots were open for curry too.....  Again, Teams guarding curry more is just a myth, All the data and the film just doesn’t support it. KD was actually guarded more in the most of their series in the half court.  “There’s more to offense than Scoring”  Yes, And KD leveled up as a passer and Is not behind Curry in that aspect. I’d actually argue he’s a better passer. KD has a massive scoring edge as well making him the bette offensive player. Defensively it’s not close. All offensive metrics point to KD in the playoffs."
&gt; considering he doesn’t require the ball that much to be one of the best offensive players in the league  I mean this statement is true for Kevin Durant as well. He played with Westbrook for many years.
Where did you find the change in minutes played in the lineup with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green from 2017 to 2019?
At the level these guys play at it is hard to differentiate but my definition would be is that it would be easier to put a team around Kevin Durant than it would be Steph.
"Even though Kevin Durant was a free agent he gave the Warriors the benefit of doing a sign and trade with him, to the Nets. So in doing so, the Warriors received Dlo in return, but also were hardcapped for the season and therefore were forced to dump iguadala and his salary to make it work"
"Yeah, thanks for throwing that distinction up so I didn't have to.   I would also add his near 11 boards a game and near 1400 regular-season games played.   Kawhi is already an all-time great playoff performer but the whole point of having a pantheon of the 1% of basketball players is their entire track record. Kevin Durant is easily closer to that hallowed ground than Kawhi is."

"[It's happened before in the NFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_NFL_season)  You're so wrong it's hilarious. The league owns the stadiums or rights to most events. NBA is exempt from anti-trust laws. Sponsored are locked into supporting these leagues. There is a reason there is not a second league, it's a lot more complicated than the top x number of players being whiney. PLus - the next generation of players, who haven't gotten paid yet...sure as shit will fill that void. You think wiseman is going to turn down a big ass pay day because billion dollar lebron is making a stand? No. See NFL labour negotiations this year where players got bent over as example of how the lower end of players are the majority, and not everyone has a deep financial safety net.   What's more ridiculous is that this is their platform. I'm not tuning into the kyrie irving science hour or the kevin durant emotional intelligence seminar. These guys could spend every press conference every game discussing big topics and have millions of viewers. Or they could go start a league in abu dhabi, make bank and literally abandon ALL the people they claim (and i am NOT AT ALL doubting that claim) to support.

"What, because he signed with the fucking Warriors? Or because he doesn't pretend to have more self-esteem than he actually does? I like and respect Kevin Durant more than I do almost any other athlete because he's honest about his foibles and weaknesses."
I love Kevin Durant
Kobe- Messi   Lebron- Ronaldo  Russell- Pele  Wilt - Maradona  Steve Nash - Beckham  Harden - Neymar   Durant- Lewandowski  Giannis - Virgil Van Dijk   Steph- Mo Salah  Klay- Sadio Mané  CP3 - Kevin De Bruyne  Kawhi Leonard - Sergio Ramos   I have explanations for most of these  I don't have one for Jordan. I don't think there's been a player head and shoulders above the rest in football like Jordan
"What??? Your entire argument hinges on “Giving a player an extension increases the odds of a player resigning”. And I didn’t realize that 16m in cap space isn’t worth anything.  You’re also missing the whole point of MY argument, that there is nothing “at risk”, you have given something up. The Nuggets gave up a tangible asset(16m) , so the burden is on YOU to prove that giving an extension increases the chance of a resign. From literally the quick research I did, I couldn’t find a SINGLE instance of a player leaving because they didn’t get an extension. I’m also going to provide evidence that giving an extension does NOT increase the likelihood of a player resigning.  Names: LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Paul George, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul. Kemba Walker, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony, Zach Randolph, Ray Allen, Amar’e Stoudemire, Deron Williams (Utah Jazz player who wouldn’t resign after getting an extension how fitting),  I haven’t seen any evidence that signing an extension helps AT ALL in resigning a player. A lot of the time waiting to extend a player doesn’t help a teams cap situation as the cap hold from having the player still puts them over the cap. But in this case, Denver lost out on 16m plus they signed him to a contract maybe worth 3-5m more his max would be this offseason. They also assumed all the risk, that he either a) didn’t become a superstar, or b) had a horrific injury. As we’ve seen from COVID insurance against risk is ALWAYS valuable. If you don’t think that these bonuses are not worth something you’re delusional. But please find me some stat, or anything to prove that signing a player to an extension helps you resign him.   I get it, you share a common belief that “giving a player an extension means they’re more likely to extend!”, but have no basis for believing that other than you’ve heard it said before. But as past experience has taught us, it just isn’t a true fact."
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Boban Marjanovic"
"Who cares what Luka wants. I thought Reddit was against players dictating to management what coaches they want. Kevin Durant and Kyrie are FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR more established NBA players than Luka, and Reddit had a bitch-fest when it was revealed they wanted the Nets coach gone.  We heard similar things when the 76ers wanted to go in a different direction a couple of days ago with Simmons.  Now, suddenly, Luka, of all people, gets to determine who his head coach is?  You guys have a problem when Lebron seemingly supports a coaching changes.  So why does Luka get this privilege again?"
My barber said they were looking to trade KCP and some picks for either Kevin Durant or Steph Curry. I give ESPN permission to use this in an article.
"Hey look, it’s Kevin Durant"
"Okay, now how about 1 Kevin Durant-sized Radio Ethan? He might call you Fat Melas, and say you're not a real hooper"
Is that even a question? 1 Kevin Durant-sized Ethan Strauss. Ethan's a crafty basketball player but I'll take the taller non-professional athlete. --Tas
"Can I have any source on Hayward’s situation, as in every article I’ve found there has been no mention of him saying he left Utah because of not being offered an extension years prior.   The only article I see where an executive comments on him leaving talks about a contract extension  that was the before his unrestricted free agency, which he wouldn’t accept because for the max extension was less than what he could get in a Free Agency.   I did find another mention that talked about the fractured relationship between Utah management, and Gordon that started when he wasn’t offered an original extension. But the key here is that it was a DIFFERENT front office. All I could see is complete speculation by espn reporters, and that speculation doesn’t really make sense.   I did argue against that point in that expecting a player to stay because of loyalty is something I think is vastly overstated. I think that people like to think of MASSIVE life decisions in a vacuum like “if Hayward was given an extension he would’ve stayed!” , when there are other more important factors at play. Just think about yourself, if you were in a city you liked, with a coached you liked, and were winning would you leave if management decided that waiting for the market 5 YEARS ago.   What’s also not mentioned is one moment does not define a relationship. Over 5 years he probably had MANY conversations with upper management, which you don’t see as an outsider.   But like I said you 100% gave up 16m in cap space, giving him an extension neither guaranteed staying, nor did not giving him the extension push him away. Some famous examples being,  Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Kevin Durant. Time will tell if it matters."
Kevin Durant Mom!
Who would you rather fight: 100 Ethan Strauss-sized Kevin Durants or 1 Kevin Durant-sized Ethan Strauss?
"Who is the best basketball player between all of you? And what are the NBA comparisons of your styles of play?  Trey seems like a dumptruck style Erick Dampier player. Leigh maybe a slow but smooth Seth Curry shooter type. Skeets potentially a prime Antonio Daniels or Devin Harris quick little guard. Tas, I have no clue, so I will just assume has a Kevin Durant all around game. Going to go with Boban or Marcin Gortat for JD.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think I nailed it."
*Lebron and Kevin Durant left the chat*
"Nets yo. We're scrappy and play hard as hell even when injured and missing a bunch of our guys, and next season we're poised to run through the Eastern Conference with the return of KEVIN MFN DURANT. Also we have the church of Sean Marks, basically the second coming of Jesus in GM form."
"Can you please explain how his contested and 30ft 3PT shots are harder to make now than when Kevin Durant played.. a few years ago?    Can you please explain how his free throws are.. harder to make now? Remember, this is all that disqualified Dirk from being the first player to do so. How is it different?    PPG is up, but his efficiency numbers aren't a result of it being easier to score. Take a look at Harden's efficiency. You can't claim defense is worse and if you do, you are not watching the games. He's not taking open shots all game.    He's playing out of his mind and had one of the most efficient, best five game stretches we've ever seen in the NBA. You   If you are this incompetent and unwilling to listen to any reasoning, I don't know what to tell you.    Other than you are wrong.       By the way, I'm a Celtics fan too, I'm guessing you're upset because we are seeing some phenomenal young players who might be better than Tatum/Brown.  We have a bright future, no need to shit on these superstars.  Cy@"
"This part made me lol too: “Odds are slim Popovich winds up in Brooklyn next season, but they are not zero. He is more likely to spend next season coaching Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving than he is to join Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.”   Great work here, Jeff."
That's Kevin Durant.
&gt;  arguably the best player game has ever seen in KEVIN DURANT  Just dropping bad takes left and right. Or is that you KD?
"Without arguably the best player game has ever seen in KEVIN DURANT it took Klay going down and 6 games for them to win it.All with huge games from Siakam, Kyle Lowery and Fred Vanvleet who put clamps on Steph curry. Come on man y’all act like kawhi was Lebron out there."
"Cowherd was the same dude who called K fucking D ""just another wing guy."" A 7 foot, lanky, athletic, shooting guard who can score from anywhere and protect the rim. It's not a knock on Oden, but that's Kevin fucking Durant. I'll admit though, watching it now is entertaining as fuck."
Well we know it’s not you /u/Not-Kevin-Durant. We all know you can’t just go on the internet and lie
Pretty solid list.  David robinson is too high. Kevin durant is too low.  Harden and tmac are too low.  The worst part of the list is at 25.   Ben wallace was the 5th best starter on that team.  I watched him the year after he left the pistons play 26 dwight howard in person.     It was the biggest mismatch in history.  Wish i could pull up the tape off youtube. Ben wallace is the most overrated player in nba history imo.   Hed be a 8th man in todays nba.
"""the defenders aren't great"" - Paul ""Kevin Durant"" George everyone."
Young Dirk was basically a bigger Kevin Durant.
"This is so stupid. I’m getting truly tired of this narrative.   For one, the “MASSIVE TS DIFFERENCE!!” was a whopping 1 total percentage point higher than his last year in OKC.   Kevin Durant in OKC 2016 -  Open shot frequency - 27%  Kevin Durant in GSW 2017 (his highest TS GSW year)   Open shot frequency - 22%  Now, am I saying Curry didn’t help Durant? No, of course he did. And the numbers show in the playoffs. Good players ALWAYS help other good players, especially when it comes to spacing and pressure. Klay included. But to pretend like Curry is the sole reason for Durants jump in TS is almost OBJECTIVELY wrong.   Look at KDs 2017 Finals performance. It’s almost legendary statistically. He was at the same level in terms of TS... when STEPH wasn’t on the court. And his open shot frequency was an abysmal 27%.  And statistically speaking, Curry TS rose in the playoffs as well with Durant. Using on/off, both players were their best when they were together.   One person wrote an article called “Mr. Unreliable” about Durant, and got massive backlash. He was never “known” as that. This is coming from an OKC fan, Durant was never known to be a lesser version of himself in the playoffs just because his TS dropped a couple points. That’s literally not true. It’s hilarious when people bring up the spacing of GSW, but ignore the spacing of OKC. OKC spacing wasn’t normal either, it was on the other side of the spectrum of GSW. It was that bad and he still performed.   Durant in GSW is the best version of Durant. The Finals performances show that.  He got better a player and stats show that. They also show that Curry made him better, and vice versa. Curry IS THE SYSTEM, he impacted that team like no one else could. But please stop diminishing Durants contributions just to give more credit to Stephen Curry.   *And one last thing: Doc Rivers also called KD the most unstoppable player in basketball last year as they threw every sort of double and triple team they could at him. Pat Bev and Lou also said “we tried everything.” It’s not impossible to double Durant when Curry is on the court, that narrative isn’t true either."
"Paul George is up there for my most hated players in the league:    Kevin Durant, Cryrie, The Donkey AKA Draymond Green, and Paul George. And Kelly Olynk. And Jae Crowder.....and Isaiah Thomas."
this sub will watch kevin durant drop a spoon on the ground and act like they just personally ended the man's whole career.
"Kevin Durant, as evidenced by the video is also another great player for the triple switch. I think Bron and AD are better overall defenders, but KD's size makes him invulnerable to mismatches on defenses."
"&gt; how many times did Jordan say in the last dance that dudes just couldn’t guard him? lebron says he’s the best player in the world regularly. even kevin durant tells people they can’t guard him.  They say these things and then back it up with the performance. PG went on social media and tries to talk shit and act big but then can't shoot for shit 3 games in a row. If he wants to talk shit and give himself a nickname that's all good, but he better be able to prove he deserves to do those things otherwise he's going to get his ass dragged through the mud like he deserves."
"I don’t think it’s immature at all. Let’s just look at the fact of the matter. Paul George has proven he can demolish even the best wing defenders in the league when he’s on. In the regular season or deep in the playoffs. He’s shown he can straight Greg Jennings his leg and still come back and son 80% of the league at will.   some of y’all have clearly never been good at a sport lol when you have that level of success, it’s not being immature or even cocky. it’s just the absolute fact of the matter. the defenders on the mavericks aren’t great (if they were, they would win 70 games). Paul George is great. because he’s still getting his looks, but the only reason they aren’t falling is because something is off with PG. it ain’t the Mavs winning in his mind, it’s PG losing.   this is the type of mind frame you have to have if you want to be successful. how many times did Jordan say in the last dance that dudes just couldn’t guard him? lebron says he’s the best player in the world regularly. even kevin durant tells people they can’t guard him.    this is seriously the most benign thing in the world and so common."
"&gt; ""The thing is, ___ has no reason to leave. The supporting cast and sidekick on the ___ are great for him.""  Paul George, Pacers (2013) /  Kevin Durant, Thunder (2012) /  Kyrie Irving, Cavs (2016) /  Kawhii Leonard, Spurs (2017) /  Chris Paul, Clippers (2014) /  Ben Simmons or Joel Embiid, Sixers (2017)"
I swear people have the memory span of a goldfish.  Kevin Durant to Warriors  Demarcus Cousins to Warriors
"Miami Heat: Tyler Herro has clearly taken a step forward in the bubble  The Miami Heat got by the Pacers Monday after sweeping them in the first round. One observation that stood above all others, Tyler Herro has taken a step.  by Kenneth Wilson 1 minute ago Follow @ksaidwhat  Tyler Herro #14 of the Miami Heat shoots over Victor Oladipo #4 of the Indiana Pacers (Photo by Ashley Landis-Pool/Getty Images) Tyler Herro #14 of the Miami Heat shoots over Victor Oladipo #4 of the Indiana Pacers (Photo by Ashley Landis-Pool/Getty Images)   The Miami Heat are advancing to the next round of the playoffs. After demolishing the Indiana Pacers in their first-round series, winning the first four games in succession for the series sweep, the Heat now await the winner of the Orlando Magic and Milwaukee Bucks series for their next opponent.  No matter who it is, it only gets harder moving forward and that goes especially if the next opposing team is to be the Bucks. While either of the two teams that advances will surely be a challenge, there are few teams that present a challenge like that in which Giannis Antetokounmpo presents.  That list goes the Lakers (LeBron James), the Brooklyn Nets when right (Kevin Durant), and perhaps one or two more teams and players, but that’s it. That’s the list.  Either way though, the Miami Heat will be ready. Facing Milwaukee three times this season, twice without Jimmy Butler and once without both Jimmy and Goran Dragic, the Miami Heat have beaten the Bucks in two of their three chances to do so.  Speaking of Milwaukee though, one of their native sons has seized the opportunity that the NBA Bubble presented. Having already been in the midst of a special year for a rookie picked where he was, Tyler Herro took that to a new level in the bubble.  While his game is just legit, which explains his showings, there is more to the story. Before it was the cool thing to say, I hypothesized here that the suspension hiatus acted as pseudo offseason for some guys, especially Tyler Herro.  The Miami Heat knew they were getting a good one in this past draft, but even they couldn’t have expected this. Tyler Herro is as advertised… a bucket.  He took every moment to get better it seems. It has shown over the seeding games and throughout the first round of the playoffs.  Averaging 13.5 points on the season, a number surely increased by his performance in the bubble, he has consistently outperformed his averages from the regular regular season. Although his first three games of the bubble were get back games for the rookie, actually having not played a ton of real action since February, they did him some good.  He did come back in the last game of the regular year prior to the suspension, but he only played seven minutes and again, after missing a little over a month due to injury. So in all actuality, the seeding games was his official return to action.  He went for just seven, 12, and 11 points across those first three games, but after that, it was lights out for the rookie we call A Bucket. He would finish the seeding game schedule with performances of 20, 25, 17, 30, and 16 points.  The game that really stuck out was the Phoenix game, where he not only was one of the Heat’s best producers on the offensive end, but he also ran the team as their main ball handler. It didn’t stop once the Heat hit the playoffs either.  A rookie, in his first-ever playoff series, Herro averaged over 30 minutes played per game, 2 threes made per game, 35 percent shooting or better from three, four rebounds, three dimes, and three more points than his regular-season average, at 16.5 points per game.  That is a heck of series for anybody in their first go-around at the playoffs, but especially a rookie. What it has all shown is this.  First off, that the Miami Heat and Pat Riley are who we thought they were, one of the best scouting, player acquisition, and development tandems the game has ever seen. It has also shown something else that we already knew, that Coach Spoelstra is a great coach and always knows how to get the most out of all of his guys.  Lastly, it has shown that Tyler Herro is absolutely legit. Everything that was ever put on him and all that we, as fans, have ever put on him as a player is absolutely true.  He is like that. That is why and how we know that Tyler Herro has clearly taken a step forward in the bubble."
If you wouldnt want Kevin Durant on your team than you are absolutely insane and dont care about winning a chip. Your teams biggest weakness is wing scoring.
*ESPN.com presents The Fall of Kevin Durant: How KD Went From Golden State Winner to Averaging 0 Points Per Game in Brooklyn*
"I've been watching the NBA for 20 years, before Melo was even in the league. I think that's the reason he is overrated because he had such a good rookie season comparable to LeBrons that some people put him on that level. The guy has one of the worst playoff records in nba history and he has a career 41% fg in the playoffs.   I'm not dating he wasn't a good player, he was a star, and will make the hof. But that doesn't mean there isn't light years between him and the all time greats because there is. He was never anywhere near the Kevin Durant level of player"
"Blake griffin, demarcus cousins, Kevin Durant rumored to join lakers  I remember when the Lebron and AD rumors sounded ridiculous too though"
Portland picked Greg Oden over Kevin Durant
"Episode description: *We welcome on 2 time NBA Champion and Finals MVP, Kevin Durant. In this episode we talk to Kevin about what makes him great, what drives him as a Champion, who inspires him, how he and ARod have had similar professional experiences, the businesses he's working on, his burner account on twitter and much more.*"
What was the point of adding Kevin Durant to this. It's not like he's played
I hated him so much  I remember when he [iced Kevin Durant and his free throw](https://youtu.be/G9nI4zlEW2A) because he had to change the time.
Because nobody in todays game is doing what Jordan did in a more physical era.  Harden is close but he cant do it against playoff defenses. In a league where guys like Ben Simmons can put up 30 point games with no jumper.  If you want someone to compare to MJ from this era its Kevin Durant. He is much closer to MJ in terms of his scoring and skill-set than LeBron.
"Kevin Durant's ""sacrifice"": 5 years, $86 million  Russell Westbrook's ""sacrifice"": 5 years, $80 million  James Harden's ""big bucks"": 5 years, $60 million  The ego stuff you keep talking about is nonsense. Harden was close with Westbrook and Durant, and was willingly coming off the bench, despite his talent and production.   Comparing Harden's departure to Reggie Jackson's makes zero sense. OKC didn't want to pay Harden max money because they already maxed Westbrook and Durant, and paid Ibaka and Perkins. They were trying to duck the luxury tax. They were penny-pinching.  Jackson clashed with Westbrook and became a locker room problem. Harden did nothing of the sort."
Kevin Durant
He's got Kevin Durant syndrome...and Luka is gonna plug his girl if he isn't careful while MH watches
"Funnily enough the article leaves out that in his next sentence in that interview Iverson also said ""Kevin Durant is the one"". So ""the one"" probably means something particular to AI, not necessarily the GOAT."
Kevin durant?
"&gt;They don’t look good outside of the big 2 and even if they win this round they have weaknesses that can be exploited by some of the teams that look better this playoffs  Lol and which team in the Western Conference looks MUCH BETTER than the Lakers right now considering the circumstances? The Clippers and Rockets series are both tied at 2-2, the Denver Nuggets are choking against a Utah Jazz team 3-1 (the Lakers have handled both the Nuggets and Jazz this season as well by the way), etc. Every team in the NBA has weaknesses that can be exploited. The Lakers have the best player in the NBA who knows how to exploit teams in LeBron James. My point is sometimes all you need is 2 superstars playing their game and a little bit of contribution from the role players here and there on both sides of the ball. KCP has had his moments in the series. Alex Caruso has played great defense overall. Hell, even Danny Green looked pretty good last game. My point is having 2 superstars that are mostly consistent in a playoff series is sometimes way more than what a lot of other teams have.  Also, the Lakers having the best playoff defense so far, is more than just the Lakers dynamic duo of LeBron and AD. That's a whole ass team effort, so technically, yes, the Lakers do have players that have looked good outside of LeBron James and Anthony Davis, at least defensively. Each role player's offense will come and go, but the team's defense will usually always be there lol  The Golden State Warriors with Kevin Durant have really distorted how much it takes to win an NBA championship lol"
Kevin Durant joining the Warriors after getting eliminated by them in the playoffs while being up on them 3-1.
And Kevin Durant wtf is this guy on
"And people give Kevin Durant shit for being a snake, but... he played out his contracts and I personally believe very strongly that he has never given his team less than his best.  Once a player's out of contract, they don't owe you or your team *shit*, but I don't really fuck with players forcing a trade.  That said, OKC did well out of it."
"Ask Portland how choosing the consensus #1 pick in 2007 went. Hardly anyone remembers his name off the top of their head. They remember the #2 pick, Kevin Durant.  So yes, it counts."
"Phoenix has its core and is on its way, now is a good time to sign an expensive veteran FA. NY has no core, has no idea what its timeline is going to be, so signing an expensive FA who's not Lebron James or Kevin Durant would just be pointless and limiting."
Kevin Durant does the same thing. It’s not that unusual or strange. He’s not a kardashian that needs the engagement.
"lmao he is the mentally weakest superstar in the league. kevin durant acts like a bitch online, but at least he delivers on the court."
Kevin Durant too
There are so many more I’d take over him. Kevin Durant? Klay Thompson? Booker? CP3?
Durant only comments on his posts with his burner accounts. You and I are both Kevin Durant.
"A 35 year old Lebron, Harden, Kevin Durant"
"There wasn't a race war when Stephen Jackson was on TV talking about Rothschild conspiracy theories and Kevin Durant liking posts that were mistakenly quoting not-Hitler about Jews conspiring to take down black people.  If there wasn't a race war then, the there isn't going to be a race war now."
"You could play him there but the Warriors SF in Kerr era have been: Harrison Barnes, Iguodala, Kevin Durant.    We aren't going smaller at that position.   Kerr and Bob Myers have said numerous times they are looking to add size to the frontcourt.  You need bigger bodies if you're trying to compete for a title"
Kevin Durant does this
"They painted themselves in a corner after the Harden trade because they weren't willing to pay to keep their finals team together.   That's a fact.    They let Harden go. Imagine the current Rockets team WITH Kevin Durant. That's what the Thunder had and gave up on because they didn't want to pay.   Afterwards, they finally decided to cough up some money, but it was too late."
We are. The problem is that we have some cap space so why not spend it. Not like Kevin Durant is just gonna show up on our doorstep
"On Pardon My Take today, Big Cat revealed that all Season 3 episodes of The Corp will drop this week; half the eps on Tue, the other half on Thu.  Kevin Durant will be a guest on one. KD will also be a guest on a future Pardon My Take episode."
At this point in the NBA only Kevin Durant is ahead of Luka Doncic. I would pick no one else other than the Durantula over Doncic if I had to start a team today.
"So Kevin Durant with a chronic back problem? Back injuries are no joke, they don't go away."
"Top tier restricted free agents are eligible for $100+ million of guaranteed money.  There are clear examples of players where an injury has ruined their career and lost them $50+ million, eg. Isaiah Thomas.  Restricted free agents have not had a a big contract yet, so the risk is much higher than for a veteran who has already got paid taking a 1 year contract eg. Kevin Durant and LeBron taking those 1+1 contracts in the past."
Kevin Durant.  He led the 2014 thunder to 60 wins with below average spacing. He’d eat in Carlisle Offense.
Imagine thinking Kevin Durant doesn't get whatever pussy he wants
"&gt; When he chose to go to LAC instead, but it was under the pretense that they trade for Paul George, I was like... why Paul George? &gt;  &gt; I mean, I like Paul George, but he's always been a big-fish-small-pond kind of guy to me. He's proven he is talented, yes, but he's not on the level of either LeBron or AD.  Kawhi tried recruiting other stars to join him but he couldn't get it done (I heard he also went after Kevin Durant?). Paul George was the guy available."
"Poor nets aren't even that bad, they looked good at time in this series with no Kevin Durant, Kyrie and 2 other key pieces. Gonna be a top 4 seed next year in the East"
"Imagine drafting Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden back-to-back-to-back (also Serge Ibaka) and not only *not* getting even a single championship out of it, but don't have a single one of those guys on your current roster."
"If he beats the clippers , he is above Kevin Durant , he is slaying cats"
&gt;harder path   *Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
"&gt;He is on the same level of them. The stats say it, the footage says it and he has been the best player in the playoffs so far  Dude you're so fucking full of shit. The stats do not say it, and the footage of 4 playoff games doesn't solidify shit. You should probably go back and look at how dominant Stephen Curry / Kevin Durant were prior to their injury years for FULL playoff runs.  The fact that you are arguing about efficiency / volume is comical. They are all around the same volume actually, but he is **MUCH** worse than two of the players around his volume regarding efficiency. Harden has 6 more shot attempts per game by the way and assumes the same star role."
"Hey you fucking clown, do you not remember your exact words being that he's better than Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, James Harden and Steph Curry? There's actually tons of statistical evidence that proves he isn't you fucking autist.  I have a tip for you to actually comprehend how you're wrong but I have a feeling your mental disorder will still lead you to believe you are correct for some reason.  &amp;#x200B;  Step 1) Click on Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden etc's basketball reference for career statistical breakdown  Step 2) Look at stats  Step 3) Compare them with Luka's stats  Step 4) Realize you are wrong  &amp;#x200B;  **Kevin Durant - 49% FG / 38% from 3 / 88% From FT / 54% EFG**  Luka - 44.5% FG / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  **Stephen Curry - 47% FG / 43% from 3 / 90% from FT / 58% EFG**  Luka - 44.5% FG / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  **James Harden -** 44.3% FG **/ 36% from 3 / 85% FT / 52.7% EFG**  Luka - **44.5% FG** / 32% from 3 / 73% from FT / 51% EFG  &amp;#x200B;  Here you go dumbass. Here's statistical evidence which literally proves you wrong. Bold text = stats go to the winner in the category. Luka won in a single Category out of 12 when comparing him to 3 players by a whopping .2 percent. Now shut the fuck up and go take your medication."
"Locks are: Lebron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Pau Gasol, Kawhi Leonard, Giannis Antekoumpo, Marc Gasol, Carmelo Anthony, and Luka Doncic.  Guys that probably get in are Kyle Lowry, Anthony Davis, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Derrick Rose.  Guys that might get in are Kevin Love, Draymond Green, Al Horford, and Andre Iguodala.  Everyone else is too early in their career to get a good idea, or isn’t really on a good path for the hall of fame."
"For sure. If you asked most people who the best in the league was, LeBron would probably be the most popular answer, then followed by Giannis  Kevin Durant is also in that discussion however he just ruptured his Achilles last year"
Not gonna lie but Paul George struggling for 3 straight playoff games is like Kevin Durant losing his talent to another kid in the Thunderstruck Movie
"I don't know, are the Knicks, or Chicago markets really doing better throwing random shit at the wall ?  Also, the Nets rebuild had almost 0 picks so there was no incentive tanking, was dependent on Kevin Durant wanting to play in Brooklyn, and is now depdendent on his recovery, it's too early to call it a true success"
"Gotta disagree with you there, chief. Simmons is good and has the potential to be great, but he's not able to dominate games in the same way Embiid does. There's something to be said for a guy who is just much bigger and stronger than everyone else, and who shoots free throws at an 80% clip. Simmons is just too poor of a shooter to ever carry an offense in the same way Embiid can. Like Giannis is a poor shooter, but he looks like Kevin Durant out there if you compare him to Simmons."

Seems like since he does such a carry job he loses his legs and his 3s come up short late in games. If he played with 3 other allstars in Houston it would probably be different.

"The Nuggets are a good team, just not a championship caliber team though they still have a lot of potential so the future is bright for you guys in Denver. The NBA is pretty simple really compared to other sports leagues. The league is split up into two conferences, the western conference and the eastern conference. Which teams are which are pretty explanatory but if you ever need to check you can always just google it. But for reference the western-most Eastern Conference team is the Milwaukee Bucks and the eastern-most Western Conference team is either the Memphis Grizzles or the New Orleans Pelicans. There's 30 teams in the NBA, 15 in each conference. 29 of the teams are in the continental United States but 1 team, the Raptors, play in Toronto. The season is normally 82 games long, and only the top 8 teams of each conference make it to the playoffs. Basketball just like any other American sport has an all-star game which is actually stretched out to an all star weekend and involves the dunk contest, 3 point contest, a skills challenge, a celebrity game, and sort of lesser version of the all-star game for young rising stars (and also obviously a traditional all-star game). The playoffs are in 4 rounds. There is a 1st round, 2nd round or semi-conference finals, the conference finals (3rd round), and then the NBA finals. Each series is best of 7, so a team has to win 4 games to move on to the next round. If a team wins a series 4-0 that's called a sweep, and if a series is won 4-1 that's called a gentlemen's sweep. There are two different mvp awards, the regular season mvp and the finals mvp. The regular season mvp is given to the person who performed the best that season though the award is often biased to players on the top teams in the league. The finals mvp is awarded to the best performing player on the winning team, and though this is rare it can also be given to a player on the losing team under extraordinary circumstances. Though I have a feeling something like that will never happen again. The consensus two best teams at the moment are actually both from Los Angeles, they're the Lakers and the Clippers. The Bucks are often considered the 3rd best team, mostly because of their star Giannis Antetokounmpo who is on his way to being the best player in the league if he isn't it already. And he has the potential to be the most dominant player of all time. The other candidate for best in the league are Kawhi Leonard, who won a championship last year with the Raptors and was finals mvp, and LeBron James, a man who's easily a top 5 player in NBA history. Some would even say the greatest player of all time (GOAT), though I wouldn't. Another key fact about Lebron is that he's older then most NBA players. He's in his 17th season and is 35 years old which doesn't sound like much but that's pretty old for an NBA player. He's certainly not in his prime anymore but the fact that he's still arguable the best player in the league at an age where most NBA players would be retired is insane. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry would also be on the list of best players in the league if they weren't injured. So barring injuries the top 5 players in league (not in any particular order) are LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard , Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant. With an honorable mention to James Harden, who I would put at number 6, though some would disagree. I already wrote an essay so I'll leave it as this. Lmk if have any questions!"
Kevin Durant doesnt care what ppl think about him.
"You realize efficiency isnt everything right ? 2016 for example. He wins them game 5 the crucial game of the series.  All the series with the Grizzlies with Russ they won. The series without Russ : lose 4/1  despite Jackson Being relatively more efficient than Russ woulve been.  Btw you know the star that underperformed even more many times before joining the best team of all time ? His teammate Kevin Durant. Its like playing with 0 spacing and 2 mediocre coaches doesnt help (and yeah I know Kd is 10 time the player that Russ is and is more efficient, doesnt change the fact that the 2016 Spurs series is the only series he wasnt disapointing in after 2012....when they had Harden so more playmaking and more spacing)"
What about when Kevin Durant ran 30 feet out of bounds to save the ball in that Rockets game and the refs said nothing? Was there a last two minute report on that? If so can someone link to it?
"He was more of a 1a/1b with Kevin Durant. Durant was better, no doubt. But Westbrook is a lot closer to a Dwade/AD second option than he is to a Khris Middleton second option. Lets not get that twisted.  It’s not that I expect more from Westbrook. I’m saying I don’t expect much from either of them. They have both faltered many times in the post season before. They don’t tend to play their best basketball there.  Like I said, Harden has gone further, but I think it’d be disingenuous to act like Harden hasn’t had the better team to go further with. I know Harden has had a good series, but pinning this series on a guy who just came back from injury after you had already played 4 games without him seems wrong."
Kevin Durant
"At first I was like no way he was out, that’s Kevin Durant he’s too good to make that kinda mistake. The replay came on and I nearly broke my tv 😭, intense to say the least."
ok kevin durant. that's enough reddit for the night
"Dude's a 3rd year player, most people don't go ring chasing til they hit 30, unless they're named Kevin Durant."
Kevin fucking Durant is a scary sight when it comes to closing a game
Congrats on signing Kevin Durant Jazz fans.
can we sign a kevin durant then?
"Least favorite players: Kevin Durant, Kyle lowery"
"People on this sub are so goddamn regarded like holy shit. Nobody was ever even close to being close to beating that championship winning, 73 win, two time finals team that added Kevin durant. The rockets were the only team that ever made it a real series against them was the 2018 rockets and before their super max player they were up 3-2    Yet all you hear is people clown the rockets about that series"
"Westbrook in the 2014 series vs the grizzlies: 48% TS   Westbrook in the 2011 grizzlies series: 51% TS  Westbrook in the 2016 spurs series: 48% TS  The clippers series was good but idk how many others you can find like that, the reality is Westbrook has the most consistent track record of underperforming in the playoffs in the NBA, and he’s never put together one entire good playoff run. The only successes you can really point to are single games or single series   The only reason people think he was good is because he was on a team with Kevin Durant and had the ball a lot and because he’s energetic"
If this is a F1 im Kevin durant
Serge “Kevin “Serge Ibaka” Durant” Ibaka

"Mfer using ""We"" like he's actually Kevin Durant   Unless... 😳😳"
"2011: LeBron James joined Dwyane Wade   2016: Kevin Durant joined Steph Curry  2021: Giannis joins Luka Doncic?   The precedent is there for a historically good player who wins MVP in a small market, but doesn't win the championship, to leave in pursuit of a championship to a team with another great player."
I think we like Westbrook because he isn't Kevin Durant. He's exciting to watch...so quick to forget triple double seasons but he never made the team better.
"It's fun to think about and it is definitely his best option if he wanted to stay in the East + stack the deck, but it probably is just a fantasy. As Celtics fans, we should know by now that we never get the Category A-level players to come here as free agents, we either draft them or trade for them. We specialize now in getting the B+ tier free agents (Kemba, Hayward, Horford).   Honestly, the path seems pretty set for Giannis to join the Mavs, doesn't it?  2011: LeBron joins fellow top 3 player in the league Dwyane Wade, wins 2 titles.  2016: Kevin Durant joins fellow top 3 player in the league Steph Curry, wins 2 titles.  2021: Giannis joins fellow top 3 player in the league Luka Doncic and wins 2 titles???????"
"[This is one of my favorite articles Grantland produced, and that is saying something.](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/nba-russell-westbrook-kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-sports-media/) Obviously biased consdering it's about my team, but it provides really fascinating insight how the organization is run. Definitely worth a read."
"In a 2-year period between summer 2007 and summer 2009 Sam Presti drafted Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka. It'll be tough for him to top that masterpiece."
Kevin Durant has a pretty tight handle at 6’11”
"There’s a lot wrong with that point of view. Who has Billy Donovan developed? Huestis is out of the league. Ferguson is a bust. Semaj Christon is out of the league. Diallo doesn’t need playoff minutes. Dort was already a good defender.   I don’t know if you credit Adams developing under Billy. I guess you could. Same with Bazley. But he’s not a good developmental coach.   And he’s also made the playoffs every season because Presti has done his job. Billy has gotten to coach Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Dennis Schroder, Chris Paul, SGA, and Gallo. Point being, Billy always has good players around him. That’s why he’s always making the playoffs. Not because of his coaching."
"Title literally says ""without Kevin Durant""."
"You can be reasonable and a fan of a sports team. You guys had the most annoying ex-girlfriend complex with Kevin Durant, and your insistence that Russ was a top-5 guy was beyond annoying.   Jimmy Butler is better than Westbrook, and even I wouldn’t say that he’s the top guy on a championship team."
"God these takes are the worst. Ben Wallace was the best player on a championship team once, you don’t think Kevin Durant could do it?  There’s like ten guys in the league right now who could lead a team to a title if cards fell the right way, just use your brain a little bit and reach an exceptionally obvious and logical conclusion based on their usual level of play."
The guy would take shots over Kevin Durant in the clutch you really think he’s going to differ now?
"In fairness to Russ, Chris Paul could technically win more with the Thunder than Kevin Durant ever did without Russell Westbrook either as Durant lost the only series he had to play without Westbrook in 5 games (vs Memphis)."
"&gt;We were up in the series when they had Klay, you mouth breathing Neanderthal.  Didn't realize Kevin Durant doesn't matter lol. You're delusional if you think you would've beaten a healthy Warriors team. Congrats on your asterix."
You ended a dynasty? What... you guys barely made it out the East and played against a Warriors team without Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson...   If KD and Klay don't get injured... you guys are getting fucking swept.   And why would a Free agent want to go to Toronto when you lost your star player?
Not top 10 might not even be top 20 since there are alot more guys that are above him that i did not even list on my list like Kevin Garnett &amp; Kevin Durant etc.  1. MJ 2. LeBron 3. Wilt 4. Kareem 5. Magic 6. Kobe 7. Duncan 8. Shaq 9. Bird 10. Hakeem
K IS FOR KEVIN DURANT WHO LEFT OKC FOR BETTER
"Okay but only because your Kevin Durant  Actually, Idk if that makes it worse"
"Prime Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green are an all time historical lineup no matter who else is on the team.  Bron played the best basketball game of his entire career gm 1 and still lost to them."
So....  nobody as good as Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant deserved just as much blame for not winning in OKC as Westbrook lmao. There's a reason he ran off to join the most stacked team ever.
Kevin Durant. Least valuable rings in the NBA
"If Westbrook plays like this, he’ll finally  get OKC to the second round with out Kevin Durant!!"
"Jimmy Butler was a possible second star for Kawhi?  I read an article about the inside workings of the Clippers recruitment, but it's on *The Athletic* and I let my subscription lapse, so I can't go back and read it.  I do remember other names they considered, like Harden and Beal.  IIRC, PG wasn't even on their radar at first, because he had just re-signed with OKC.  Edit: found [the article](https://theathletic.com/1086977/2019/07/23/inside-story-los-angeles-la-clippers-pursuit-of-kawhi-leonard-paul-george/).  Leonard was interested in teaming up with Butler or Kevin Durant as well."
"they treating bazley like he's kevin durant, girl, what"
Ughhh... Ughhh no lmao. Sun's get smashed because Nash gets exposed on defense. Meanwhile Paul would guard Kevin durant for stretches
somehow i do not foresee that social block being as much of a hindrance for someone like kevin durant tbh
I would bet money Kevin Durant comes back and plays poorly
"&gt;Lol is this a joke? Beating a 49-33 Trail Blazers team in the first round isn't some amazing accomplishment, especially when he didn't even carry them.  Sweeping the 3rd seed in the first round as the 6th seed is extremely impressive.  What has Luka done in the playoffs?   &gt;And I don't give a single shit about a super distant third finish in MVP voting. He wasn't even close to a threat to actually winning it. Steph Curry and Kevin Durant finished way behind him in  Great, so you shouldn’t give a shit about Doncic’s MVP caliber season either"
"Lol is this a joke? Beating a 49-33 Trail Blazers team in the first round isn't some amazing accomplishment, especially when he didn't even carry them. How about you look at his pre-Lakers career as a whole instead of just cherry picking one of the two (out of seven) seasons he actually made the playoffs?  And I don't give a single shit about a super distant third finish in MVP voting. He wasn't even close to a threat to actually winning it. Steph Curry and Kevin Durant finished way behind him in voting but were way better players."
being a Lebron James fan usually means you despise Kevin Durant and the Golden State Warriors
"\- Kevin Durant in the playoffs from 2010-2016 (per-100 possessions): 35.9 points, 4.7 assists, 4.1 turnovers, 58.0% TS  \- Kevin Durant in the playoffs from from 2017-2019 (per-100 possessions): 39.1 points, 6.1 assists, 3.6 turnovers, 64.2% TS  He wasn't a bum in Oklahoma City but it's no coincidence that his numbers skyrocketed after the switch. His OKC playoff career is far surpassed by multiple players."
"“KD’s offensive impact has rarely matched his box score and his passing didn’t improve”  Kevin Durant ran a 116 Ortg last year with Curry off the floor. Is that not matching impact? Almost 10 points above league average offensive efficiency in a 1,000+ minute sample. https://imgur.com/a/hX5QDjt  The spacing without Curry isn’t great either since Klay is the only shooter &amp; everyone else can’t shoot. It’s clear that KD simply got better as a passer &amp; overall creator. He became better at those on-off passes, &amp; Those post passes. This is with Curry off the floor.   KD without Westbrook was a +10 from 2010-2016......  Again, Impact that matches box score....  Also, Impact metrics simply do not measure onball ability or passing or whatever you think they measure, It’s literally a measure of lineup combinations and the models use regressions to try and approximate a value. It’s not valuable at all. Read the 3-part paper by Justin Jacobs,   https://twitter.com/taylor_snarr/status/1281702098518695939?s=21  Here’s a link to a tweet that explains that RAPM is not even more Accurate than BPM 2.0......The lower the value, the better approximation of Impact. RAPM is not more valuable than PIPM/RPM/EPM all metrics which Durant best Kobe across the board.  Also, Westbrook was 77th in 3-year RAPM after KD left, He was bottom 100 in Playoff RAPM when KD left. It’s clear his RAPM was inflated by playing nearly all of his minutes with Durant. It’s clear KD was the true conductor of those elite OKC playoff offenses, Offenses in which Kobe never hit without ShaQ.   The only argument for Kobe is RAPM, Which simply isn’t reliable due to the standard deviations that make it near useless. Every other metric favors KD, regular season or postseaosn, box or non box......it’s very clear whose better"
"While looking at player’s clutch #’s might be an interesting figure to look at when discussing Kyrie’s impact, I don’t necessarily conclude that those statistics result in an inherent decrease in overall team play. We did not see a fully healthy Nets team play this past season. What we did see is a dismantled team achieve 7th seed without their two best players. I’m not going to argue the fact that Kyrie made the C’s worse last year. His playstyle was geared toward ISO ball which caused everyone to play slightly worse which is kind of a no-shit moment (ie Kobe). This is not even mentioning the fact that JT played worse in the 2019 playoffs as a whole but I digress. However, what I am struggling to find in your discussion is how you don’t add in Kevin Durant into the equation. The Nets will then have two phenomenal scorers that take pressure off each other combined with Dinwiddie off the bench and JA/DJ in the paint. And Joe Harris as a three machine? The absolute floor for a roster like that is the 2nd round. The difference with the 76ers failure is that Embiid, Tobias Harris, and an old Horford aren’t going to carry your team anywhere. Ben Simmons may have made their series against the Celtics competitive but by no means were they reaching past the second round. As you stated, their away game record was atrocious. The reason the 76ers worked well last season is that Butler and JJ provided less pressure for Embiid and Simmons to function well. The team utilized shooters and their length to function as a well oiled-machine. Unfortunately an unlucky shot caused them to miss the ECF. The comparison to next season’s Nets team stems from the amount of shooters they have combined with a talented roster. I’m not going to try to convince you that the Nets will win next season because even I know that is questionable as this point. But pretending that they don’t have the talent to at least surpass the majority of the eastern conference is puzzling."
"In Rose's peak years, LeBron James. Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and Kobe Bryant were all still playing and playing at a higher level than Derrick Rose."
Kevin Durant
"If you’re gonna just strictly use TS% without other context idk what to tell you. You’re telling me to adjust for environment, like Kevin Durant didn’t have to kick out to Roberson, Thabo, and Westbrook during his whole stint at OKC, yet still had a higher TS% lol"

Kevin Durant is here 😳😳😳👀👀👀👀
"so out of curiosity, i checked out the question he asked about the rookie of the year being top 3 in most improved the next season, and it seems the only other guy to ever do it is kevin durant"
His username is Kevin Durant Burner
Kevin Durant has 2 trophies named Finals Most Valuable Player so I think so
it’s Kevin Durant....is there much he isn’t capable of?
Kevin Durant suddenly enters the stadium in a rockets uniform
Are you Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant for obvious reasons
Kevin Durant instantly
oh no the raptors got help from a raptor to win the championship  and also if the warriors didnt want one injury to cripple them maybe they should have had a real bench instead of kevin durant
Do you guys remember kevin durant
Kevin Durant pulls a LeBron and comes home in two years book it
"What’s most impressive about that run is that its going to look better with time.   Since that run: LeBron’s become a top 5 player, Kevin Durant is just outside the top 10, Westbrook and Harden won MVPs and became statistical legends, Wade and Bosh became HOFers, Pau Gasol is a HOFer with a ton of accolades. Somewhat morbidly, Kobe Bryant won’t be criticized as much  It’s still crazy to think that he beat 5 MVPs"
What kind of mental gymnastics do you have to do to equate Harrison Barnes to Kevin Durant lol
"I'm glad, there are too many young people here that come for the memes and stuff, but there's not a lot of conception as to the history of /r/NBA or deeper still what the history of the history of basketball is.  The vast majority of content here comes from a very small cadre of users that have been here forever. The original /r/NBA, and I've been here on various accounts since 100k members, were fans of Bill Simmons, who tend to follow along his famous ""Book of Basketball"" when discussing the economics, politics and history, future and past, of basketball. Likewise, they continue to post from The Athletic and other sources that Bill likes, which is good in the sense that he is one of the great editors of American culture in recent times, and means to basketball what Anna Wintour might mean to Vogue, but it leaves a lot of young people ages 17-25 with a very limited view.   I know that sounds very odd in a discussion of Oklahoma, but I said all that to preface what Oklahoma should mean on this board. The Sonics left Seattle before /r/NBA was too big, and likewise, the New Orleans Hornets played very briefly in Oklahoma City before the Thunder move. Bill Simmons is one of the most famous voices to talk about why the Thunder shouldn't have moved from Seattle, but the huge issue with that is that he is one voice, and was a hugely minority voice back then on this topic. The issue for us today is that because the early history of the board was to post clips from his articles and podcasts, the foundational language of the Oklahoma City Thunder is the foundational language from Bill Simmons, and he is hugely, laughably wrong about so many of the major turning points in NBA history, that it is insane that he still has so much clout, especially as his disciples get likewise mentioned for their influence today [Shams, elements of Woj's transition from Yahoo to ESPN, etc.].   Anyway, Simmons was hugely critical, and made a lot of points saying fuck this rich conservative dude who bought the Thunder, and that marked a lot of things as the Thunder being this hated team, KD being soft, Westbrook being a chucker, etc. with the Warriors being the golden boy team that saved the NBA with the brilliant idea to shoot 3s which no one else ever thought of.  I hate that thinking, not only because the history of the Warriors is stolen word for word ostensibly, from the Orlando Magic of the mid to late 2000s that were punctuated by /r/NBA punching bag Jeff Van Gundy and a massive center in Dwight Howard, but because the Warriors benefitted from rule changes that occured in the NBA during labor issues and political strife that Simmons himself has repeatedly said he didn't cover well, and when he did, he covered it incredibly inaccurately.   Anyway, deeper still on this Oklahoma point, I find that I'll have to make these posts on various accounts, not only because people don't understand that the content posted here is actually so deeply limited in the actual scope of the NBA and that just because good info and memes are posted here doesn't mean you should ever open your mouth in real life about basketball until you really know the game, but because a lot of the information here is intentionally deceitful. I know pro players and pro agents who post incorrect information and drive false narratives here and on Twitter. People joke about the burner accounts of the 76ers executive Brian Colangelo and Kevin Durant, but they don't understand why history necessitated that these things would happen, and that they themselves are part of the history of the future of the NBA. These burner accounts, these posts, are seen by millions. I've had random /r/NBA posts that I made quoted to me by dozens of people in real life, many who have seen less than 10 NBA games a season, as evidence as to why my opinions on basketball are wrong. Likewise, I know that when I post I have to write a lot of deep points and then stitch them all together as best as I can than be the sarcastic, caustic redditor type, exactly because whenever the dumbest things get posted here enough times, it sticks around forever."
&gt; Kevin Durant: “So that was the first thing he [Obama] asked when I walked in. 'So where you going? You can't go over there with those shooters over there. It'd be too much.'”  Wow thanks Obama. KD should have took the presidents advice.
"Actually he went through:  Round 1: Nikola Vucevic   Round 2: Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons   ECF: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton   Finals: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson   It’s still 8 players, but he wasn’t the only all-star on his team"
We sacrificed the center position for Kevin Durant.  It's not like we would have turned down a good center if we were given the opportunity for one. Edit: Also you say that like we don't all know that this was James Michael McAdoo's team while he was with us.
Kevin Durant
"Okay. Top 10 MVP voting: Curry, Kawhi, LeBron, Westbrook, Durant, Chris Paul, Draymond, Lillard, Harden, Lowry. You still had players like Paul George, Anthony Davis, cousins, Aldridge, derozan, IT, Klay, Butler and Kemba. Nearly all of those players averaged more than Kyrie that season. If you put Kyrie in top 5 you’re nuts. Kevin love is not top 10 lol."
"Wilt's peak volume scoring regular season was 1961-62 (I'm not going to mention the flaws in his offensive game that season, why it wasn't even his best season, et cetera). During that season, he scored 28.7 PTS/75 on +5.7 rTS. Here are regular seasons where people scored more PTS/75 on better rTS (with Wilt's 1961-62 season for listed for reference):  |Player|Season|PTS/75|rTS| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Wilt Chamberlain|1961-62|28.7 PTS/75|\+5.7 rTS| |Stephen Curry|2018-19|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2016-17|28.8 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS  | |Adrian Dantley|1985-86|28.8 PTS/75 |\+8.8 rTS  | |Kawhi Leonard|2016-17|29.2 PTS/75 |\+5.7 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1997-98|29.2 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Ricky Pierce|1990-91|29.3 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2015-16|29.3 PTS/75 |\+9.3 rTS  | |Yao Ming|2006-07|29.4 PTS/75 |\+6.0 rTS| |Shaquille O'Neal|2001-02|29.4 PTS/75 |\+7.0 rTS| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|2018-89|29.5 PTS/75 |\+8.7 rTS| |Kevin Durant|2009-10|29.6 PTS/75 |\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1998-99|29.7 PTS/75 |\+7.3 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2017-18|29.9 PTS/75 |\+11.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1988-89|30.0 PTS/75 |\+7.7 rTS  | |LeBron James|2009-10|30.0 PTS/75 |\+6.1 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1996-97|30.0 PTS/75|\+6.4 rTS  | |Shaquille O'Neal|1997-98|30.1 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Karl Malone|1989-90|30.5 PTS/75 |\+8.9 rTS  | |Kevin Durant|2013-14|31.4 PTS/75 |\+9.4 rTS  | |James Harden|2017-18|31.7 PTS/75 |\+6.3 rTS  | |Isaiah Thomas|2016-17|31.8 PTS/75 |\+7.2 rTS  | |Stephen Curry|2015-16|31.9 PTS/75 |\+12.8 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1990-91|32.0 PTS/75 |\+7.1 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1989-90|32.0 PTS/75 |\+6.9 rTS  | |Michael Jordan|1987-88|32.7 PTS/75 |\+6.5 rTS  | |James Harden |2018-19|36.2 PTS/75|\+5.9 rTS  |  This is purely judging them based on scoring. People will bring up the argument that Wilt played 48.5 MPG, but I think that speaks more to his endurance and physical shape than his scoring ability.  If you want to discuss post-season scoring, where most players tend to have a more difficult time, Wilt still wouldn't be the best (Jordan for one is definitely better, and there's quite a few more you could add to the list)."
"There are a few players I really dislike:  - Kyrie Irving, for his holier-than-thou attitude and using his platform to spout anti-science rhetoric  - Kevin Durant for being the pettiest superstar in the league and having the audacity to act surprised when people didn't like his move to GSW  - Grayson Allen, because fuck Grayson Allen  But I would ban Draymond Green. I hate him the most. The 2016 nut-kicking becoming enough of a problem that he got suspended for it, the comments on BLM / Raptors saying that it's just an American issue, the way he's a mouthbreather, it's all bad."
You can put Kevin Durant on literally every single roster in the NBA as it is right now and they can be a contender. You put Steph on some teams and he is a better version of Trae Young. That's just the truth.
Past few years   * Kevin Durant * James Harden * Russel Westbrook * Draymond Green * Paul George  [...lot of ex Thunder players there](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0c816f4bb17f1ec9294b869e06a783f7/tenor.gif?itemid=13282081)
"The context is important. The media ([especially Strauss](https://theathletic.com/802440/2019/02/05/silent-star-on-the-presumed-warriors-exit-of-kevin-durant/)) had been writing a ton of negative stories criticizing Durant for refusing to answer questions about where he would play next season.  Strauss even implied that Durant's media ""silence"" was a sign that he had abandoned the team."
Pippen could never lead a team to the playoffs and his highest average is 21 ppg...... I’ll let you google how many teammates Lebron has had cross that threshold.    Literally all of Lebron star teammates led a team to the playoffs except Kevin love lol.    Magic Johnson also went to 9 finals? Know who we all say is better? The people that beat him in 5 of the 9 finals he went to(bird and Jordan) dumbass you fell right into that one.   Lebron and Magic Johnson are the same players. Avoiding playing their natural positions to stat pad and avoiding guarding the other teams wing(Durant was begging him to guard him in the 17 finals that was sickening to see lol)  whole bunch of empty number game losses. Both lost more than they won.   Bringing up all stars is also a relevant point because you cannot say he didn’t have any help if most of them were established all stars before they came there. Lebron didn’t magically make them better.    Also don’t matter how old ray Allen was he sent Lebron ass home on the Celtics and bailed his ass out when he was on the heat. Lebron would be 2-7 otherwise and you wouldn’t even be here trying to plead this man case lol  Lebron can’t play defense. He’s a bigger ball stopper than Kobe could ever dream of being. And again he has a losing record in the finals and he’s only getting there because the east sucked.   Going to 9 finals not impressive if half the teams you play don’t even have 45 wins to their name. Lol.
"Reporter should have said “Because you know who you are. You’re Kevin Durant.”  But anyway, I’m sure it’s going to go well for KD with the soft-touch NY media."
"Kevin Durant is such a baby. Its like when he said that dumbass line “you know who I am, I’m Kevin Durant.” Even tho the context it was said in only half made sense. Dude just like to say what he wants to say wether or not it makes sense and its hilarious"
Because he’s kevin fucking Durant it comes with the territory. The same thing for lebron where hes damned if he does damned if he doesn’t

kevin durant *almost* gets it
It’s as simple as Klay is a cool dude whereas Kevin Durant kinda seems like a bit of a douche bag
"Yeah but the reason why Klay skipping the post game press conference isn’t a big deal is because Klay isn’t known for emotional outbursts or doing things like that, so him doing it once is no big deal.   Kevin Durant already has the reputation for being unpredictable emotionally and has done things we just don’t see superstars do, that’s why it is more newsworthy if he just didn’t show up to a post game press conference."
"\- Kawhi Leonard in the playoffs from 2016-2020: 38.0 points per-100 possessions, 62.5% TS  \- Kevin Durant in the playoffs from 2017-2019: 39.1 points per-100 possessions, 64.2% TS  \- Kevin Durant in the playoffs from 2011-2016: 35.9 points per-100 possessions 58.0% TS  Kawhi Leonard put up comparable numbers while not having remotely close to the level of offensive talent around him that Kevin Durant did in Golden State. I was being kind by including Kawhi Leonard's 2016 run, which was the season before he ascended into an MVP level player.   Durant's OKC numbers are far worse. Putting up monstrous stats when surrounded by Steph Curry and Klay Thompson doesn't make Durant better."
"Kawhi Leonard is a far better playoff scorer than Durant. If Kawhi Leonard replaced Kevin Durant on the Warriors from 2016-19, he'd put up comparable numbers."
Tell Kevin Durant not to lobby for Steve Nash next time
MPJ at the draft combine interview compares himself as the hybrid of Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  He sure has superstar ego and confidence. With conspiracy theories and antivaxx upbringing to boost.
"Yup, yup. The only thing worse is the misandry. Kevin Durant, Lebron, James Harden, they all get called snake, traveler, etc constantly, and they all happen to be men. Y'all need to watch yourself."
"&gt; Michael Porter Jrs game actually resembles Kevin Durant.  Any time MPJ dribbles it is like 60/40 that it will be a total dumpster fire  Let's be honest with ourselves, right now he's like Ryan Anderson with a dash of Kenneth Faried thrown in"
"It’s not because MPJs game is actually comparable to Kevin Durants. Wiggins game is not comparable to Mjs. It’s just a dumb nickname, Because they thought he could be one of the best ever and he’s from Canada that’s it. Even in this article himself Wiggins says his game is more comparable to Kevin Durant than the other two players and MPJ factually resembles Kevin Durant more than Wiggins ever could. I’m not worked up at all I’m just correcting you and making it known that Wiggins wasn’t actually compared to MJ and you’re spreading misinformation."
https://deadspin.com/so-whos-this-andrew-wiggins-kid-an-explainer-1456392439  Literally they only call him maple Jordan because they expected him to be the next lebron. Not because his game resembles Mj. Michale Porter Jrs game actually resembles Kevin Durant.
Draymond is a bitch too as is kevin Durant. It’s almost as if I can objectively look at things. I dunno how the hell you watch Marcus Smart flop like a fish all over the basketball court and enjoy it.
"Downvoting this because OP is trying to jinx us by assuming we advance to the next round.  Nothing is a given in this league, unless you're coming off a 73-9 season and sign Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant is coming off of an Achilles rupture
The whole argument is kind of irrelevant. They have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the team. They could've hired a moldy potato to be the coach.   The team will be just fine and when the possessions actually matter they will run 1-3 pick and roll like any moron would.
There is a player called Kevin Durant in the East. He is way better than Embiid and Dame.
"Lebron's playoffs minutes is one.   Lebron is number 1 in MP in playoffs, currently has 10,327 career playoff minutes. Tim Duncan is at second who has played 9370 minutes in his career.   There is no active player right now who is even at top 25. Kevin Durant is at number 32 with 5598 minutes."
"Sigh. This is wrong.   KD was literally doubled plenty in multiple series. The 2019 Clippers employed a defense in which they both doubled KD and trapped Steph while leaving Iggy and Draymond virtually opened.   KD describes that defense in his “I’m Kevin Durant” rant, and Draymond notoriously called that defense “gimmick” earlier in the season when other teams ran it due to the weak bench.   You can also see multiple, yes multiple, times of the Cavs trying to double Durant in the Finals.   The simple fact of the matter is that it’s much difficult to double the high post and complete modern basketball rotations in 2020. Durant excelled there, and the spacing added gave him a nice boost as well."
"He actually did get into KDs head in last year’s playoffs especially when they both got ejected but like you said the best way to deal with it is simply play better and win   https://youtu.be/DfggRtdOiTE?t=77   When Bev defended KD in that first round series and KD gave us the iconic “You know who I am, I’m Kevin Durant” quote he absolutely torched us up until the series was over.   Beverley simply just gave him his deserved praise in the postgame interview after we were eliminated and that was that"
Kevin Durant
Lmao. Bird is basically Kevin Durant with leadership ability and also mamba mentality.   Instant best team in nba.
Bro if you're going to lie at least tell a lie that can't be debunked with a 10 second Google search. https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/06/kevin-durant-injury-achilles-raptors-fans-jurassic-park-reaction-video-cheered-nba-finals  All those super rich fans in... Jurassic Park.
*being the asshole is the norm*  *literally cheers when Kevin Durant Hurts himself*  Pick a struggle kid
Yeah we should change the name after you disgraced the league with that little stunt you pulled when Kevin Durant hurt himself.
MPJ is the next kevin durant and the mavericks should trade KP for him.
Didn’t your team clap when Kevin Durant hurt his Achilles? I really don’t want to hear about it when your city is only known for Drake.  Also you guys only have one ring...
"If Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant aren't on your team, an iso at the end of games are stupid. Run a play."
Dunno about the rest of the team but he did consult [Durant](https://www.netsdaily.com/2020/9/9/21428731/taking-a-deeper-look-into-the-steve-nash-kevin-durant-relationship)  That connection was evidently what led to KD pushing the Nets FO to hire Nash.
"He going back to college. I’m leaving, class act”  Kevin Durant can’t do 100 minus 5"
Kevin Durant &gt; Giannis   So no.  Kevin durant is 7ft tall with the skill set and moves of a pg  Giannis is a strong defensive player with limited offence (being incredibly dominant in the paint but can’t do much outside the paint)
"No, it was Kevin Durant."
"&gt;As a counter point, how hypocritical is it for commentators to be crying out for people, especially police to stop judging based upon skin color and then to flip that in this hiring???  My dude, come on. This is just a conservative talking point like, ""MLK Jr had a dream, and yet colleges still factor in race in their admissions???""  Colleges factor in grades and SAT scores, which are largely shaped by the resources someone has for co-parenting, tutoring, and test prep. Colleges  factor in extra curriculars, they factor in connections people have, and whether someone is a ""legacy"", which historically was based What college someone can even afford to attend is based on wealth, which is overwhelmingly determined by inheritance and the generational robbery of this country.   In the same way, Steve Nash's proximate reasons for getting this job may be due to his existing relationship with Kevin Durant, but it's also fair to point out that to get that relationship, he may have benefited from the perception that white players aren't ""physical freaks"" and instead have good fundamentals and high BBIQ. NBA front offices are much more white than their courts, and they get whiter the higher you go.  It's probably true that Chris Paul might get similar treatment once he retires, but I don't think as a player, Nash was treated the way Paul is. And of course, Paul is a hypothetical while Nash is a reality.  [I don't think Nash answered the question wrong](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/nets/2020/09/09/steve-nash-brooklyn-nets-coach/5762110002/); all he knows is what he knows, and we can't re-play his life as a Black Canadian man. But like with college or a first job, it's not just looking at the immediate decision to admit or hire someone. It's all the factors that contribute differently to people along the way."
That’s false i already acknowledged they won without him when i said 2015-2026(whichever you prefer) was not the only finals. My original comment was about impact and KD being important you take out his statistics and the warriors lose each of those finals(the two they won) and that goes for the one against Toronto(even through they did lose). You tried to spin it into something it wasn’t. I gave you statistics and you still haven’t given me any numbers cause those numbers aren’t in your arguement a favor. So to sum it up prove to me the warriors didn’t need Kevin Durant to win. If you can’t prove to me that the warriors didn’t need kevin Durant to win in 2017 and 2018 then i guess i was right the whole time 😛
"Played against JR Smith, Ed Davis, and Kevin Durant while on my HS team, Greg Oden and OJ Mayo in AAU, those are the more notable ones I guess.  JR talked some shit to me while I was on the bench which I got a kick out of, he got ejected from that game for something stupid like hanging on the rim to earn his second tech. JR had this teammate, Alex Galindo...he was such a fluid player, I'll never forget watching him.  We played KD in a sold out college arena, shit was completely insane, everyone in the building knew he was going to be a legit star. I've never felt so helpless playing basketball as I did against KD, he was completely unstoppable."
Kevin Durant
Russell Westbrook  Andre Roberson   Kevin Durant  Serge Ibaka  Steven Adams
"Steve Nash wasn't hired because he's white, but (assuming the rumors are accurate) he was hired because of who he is personally and his personal relationships, not because of his abilities as a coach. He was hired because he has a personal relationship with Kevin Durant. This sort of thing happens all the time at all kinds of businesses. Someone gets hired for a job because he or she has a personal relationship with a manager or a valued employee who is already working at the same company. By itself, this doesn't have anything to do with race. However, this type of mild nepotism can perpetuate racial inequalities. If managers only consider people they already know for certain positions, those positions are much likelier to go to the same types of people, and to people from the same race and class backgrounds. In the US today, white privilege frequently looks like the Steve Nash hiring: someone gets an opportunity because his or her background put that person in a good position. Other people never even got to the position of being considered, so their exclusion isn't visible, but it's still something that happens."
"&gt; developed a good relationship within Kevin Durant who this Nets franchise is 100% focused on and 100% should be.   This is literally the only part of what you wrote that matters.  Also if you're gonna say that being a minority owner of Real Mallorca qualifies you to be an NBA head coach, you should point out that the majority owner of the team is Robert Sarver."
"Fun fact, I already showed someone else in this thread that Shaq openly said he regrets leaving Orlando, KG went back to Minnesota, Lebron went back to Cleveland and Kevin Durant left Golden State to try to build something of his own in Brooklyn."

*Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
"&gt; Mar 31, 2015  &gt; Kevin Durant in 2016"
"Kevin Durant!  No, wait, he slithers."
"In the link I provided it details what Marks did above what was already in place.  But yes every team goes out of their way for their players.    [Link](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/12/31/jared-dudley-knicks-westchester-practice-facility-a-problem-with-free-agents/)  Jared Dudley said this:  ""That’s why Brooklyn got Kevin Durant. I told DeAndre Jordan who told Kevin Durant: The practice facility is two minutes from (Barclays Center). They didn’t even know that. I lived in the city. It took me 12 minutes to get to the practice facility. That’s a huge bonus.""  At the moment the Knicks practice facility is 45-50 minutes away from MSG depending on your route in Google Maps."
"I think you overestimate the level of happiness that a player gets running out on his team and winning empty rings while being flamed into oblivion by the media and fans. Kevin Durant literally texted his agent at one point shortly after joining the Warriors and said ""why'd you let me do this to my life?"" And even Bob Myers was publicly mocking him for not earning it at the end of the run."
So are we going to ignore that Iggy said this was something that happened to him too during his tenure with GS? Even the warriors GM Bob Myers took the blame after the game for letting Kevin Durant play. Those are about as close to the organization as you can get.
"Kevin Durant, will always love this guy no matter what"
Not a fan of OKC but man did I love watching Kevin Durant and Russ.  Still love my boys.
"Kevin Durant iso, Kevin Durant off down screens, Russ PnR. That’s efficient offense. Just like Chris Paul PnR over and over is efficient. Why say the offense wasn’t efficient when you really just mean you didn’t like it? Either it was competent or it wasn’t, what it looked like doesn’t determine that. You can’t claim it wasn’t competent and then excuse that by only crediting. Simple offense can be smart offense.   That’s not to say there weren’t and aren’t problems with him, but don’t act like he turned his team into some trash offense."
"""Kevin Durant... wub wub wub... he's a good person....waaaaaaah"""
He couldn't even control Kevin Durant.
IT is not Kobe. Once in a lifetime franchise player who played for one team as a career. Not even close. And the lakers tried to trade Kobe that one time during his prime...  Every single team would push stars to play in a playoff game if doctors clear them and the player says they can go. Let’s not pretend that’s not the case. Kevin Durant is a recent example.
I am willing to gamble. Especially he has the potential to be a smaller version of Kevin Durant.
Steph curry had klay Thompson and Kevin Durant .. who tf does harden have ? Lmao Westbrook and Eric Gordon ? Come on man
Kevin Durant is a superstar with no rings. (I’m kidding I’m kidding before you downvote me this was a layup of a response to this question.)
"Man, Wiggins nickname leading up to the draft was literally maple Jordan. He was considered a somewhat raw two way prospect at least on par with Davis and KD. Oden was the better prospect, but had injured his wrist and played somewhat reckless. (The way he kicks his feet when landing off dunks at his weight and frame paired with bullyball)  Wiggins is indisputably the best prospect in canadian history, Nash will be more accomplished, but hype has never been that far north. Draft comparisons put him as probable HoF VC and, at the time, a very reliable Rudy Gay who had the size and athleticism to be a contributor on most teams.  KD was considered too skinny and mentally weak.  AD was also too skinny and uncommited to isoing bad matchups.  Oden was a god and had the best combo of frame and athleticism, but would defer to his teammates like Lebron does and not try on some defenders.  Wiggs was a pedestrian star in college, but his hype was closest to Oden. Barring injury and lack of effort, they were both going to be a lock as a starter coming into the league. And many considered wiggins flaws to be at least partially because he wasnt earning money yet. Everybody had flaws coming into the league but Wiggins had Jordan level expectations. Talking heads were putting him up with LeBron and Jordan before dude made it.  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/andrew-wiggins/  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/  https://www.nbadraft.net/players/greg-oden/ https://www.nbadraft.net/players/anthony-davis/  Edit: https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/kobe-bryant-andrew-wiggins-michael-jordan-same-moves-video/amp  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.deseret.com/platform/amp/2013/10/17/20527713/nike-and-adidas-have-offered-prep-hoopster-andrew-wiggins-180-million-and-a-lot-of-problems  Also this fucking contract dude /\"
"Billy Donovan lasted longer in Oklahoma City than Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Paul George."
"“Thanks for not ruining my career even after knowing I’m leaving, class act”  Kevin Durant can’t relate"
"I am sure the Kevin Durant injury is still on the minds of every organization.  However, if this was actually a competitive series you know Giannis would've been out there.  Just no point risking injury when it was obvious the Heat were the better team and the series was over."
Kevin Durant talked about wanting to be like Tim Duncan and wanting his jersey retired here.  Paul George had unfinished business and was here to stay.  Putting any stock into these kinds of comments is extremely foolish at this point
"&gt; Their only offense consisted of Durant and Westbrook isolation.  I don't think any coach could have persuaded that Durant/Westbrook team to stop running iso-ball as the primary offense. To some extent you can blame Donovan for failing to control his stars, but I don't think it could have been done. KD's awesome but we saw him go to the Warriors and spend a lot of possessions hijacking their offense to run isos, which was effective because he's Kevin Durant, but you get the idea. Russ is Russ, and was even more Russ in 2016."

"College basketball coaches don't always make good NBA coaches just like college football coaches don't always make good NFL coaches. Sure, someone may point to an outlier, but for the most part the type of style and control someone would have had in college doesn't exist in the NBA. That's just life.   Billy Donovan has at point had coached:  - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - Paul George - Chris Paul  And a bevy of mid-tiers to no success. I fully trust Presti to find a coach that's main goal will be to completely coach fundamentals - X's and O's. The Thunder are going to need it. This coaching position would be like looking not for the manager who has 20 years experience in the field but the manager who just oozes the ability to ensure their employees know exactly what to do when they need to do it.   I'm excited."
Kevin Durant-ish
kevin durant currently praying giannis becomes a bigger traitor than him
"Praying Philly hires him. Dude is fucking terrible offensively. He couldn't run a competent offense with Kevin fucking Durant on his team, can't wait what he does when his primary ball handler is Ben Simmons lmao"

Warriors have a losing record without kevin Durant in the finals good try. You can only reference 2015 which shows you can refute my points 😂😂😂
"AD was a 6'3"" point guard when he was about to go into college.  He did not grow up in any way as a big man or center.  https://www.espn.com/college-sports/recruiting/basketball/mens/news/story?id=5894839  Even Davis' role models changed.  ""I liked Tracy McGrady and he was very good, and Allen Iverson was a good ball handler,"" he said. ""Now I idolize Kevin Durant and Kevin Garnett."""
"I believe Kawhi was up 20 on GSW in 2017 before Zaza injuried him and and that was when they had Curry, Klay, Draymond AND Kevin Durant all healthy."

"If it helps all time great point guard (2xMVP) Steve Nash is now the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets featuring 2 all stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.   Nash is a big football fan, not too sure on what teams, leagues etc..  Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving have both played in and won the finals withing the last 5 years but not together on the same team like they are now"
"correlation != causation, part of this is that small ball is new, playing people under 6’7 at the 3/4 wasn’t super common before recently, so he hasn’t faced as many shorter defenders. also, mickael piétrus and andre iguodala are 6’6 so you got that wrong (and while they still technically fit your title, marion and pierce are  6’7 and kevin durant is probably a bit short of 7’0)"
Jeff Green played with Kevin Durant on the Supersonics before they teamed up with James Harden and Russel Westbrook on the Thunder.
Kevin 'Fuck U' Durant
YESSS KEVIN DURANT JR IS IN
Is it ~~Kevin Durant~~ Michael Porter JR. time yet?
"ah yes the prestigious blazers, whos biggest highlight was passing up the opportunity to draft Kevin Durant for the ultra durable Greg Oden then losing Lamarcus aldridge only to over compensate for their lack of depth by over paying CJ mccollum and jusif nurkic just to permanently cement their all nba level point guard into a mid tier purgatory.  World class front office"
i miss Kevin Durant. I said it.
Why do they keep calling Kevin Durant as Porter Jr?
"Lol this post was downvoted within seconds. There's some truth to it though. Here's the full quote:  We don’t get those jobs. When I’m talking about ‘we,’ I’m talking about Black coaches. We don’t get jobs that are that set and that good — when you got two All-Stars like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. … We don’t get those jobs where you have built-in superstardom guys on that roster right away.  We get the kind of jobs where you have to make something out of nothing and when you don’t or you’re not able to do it, they’ll say, ‘Well, we gave him the opportunity.’  Examples  Alvin Gentry, Monty Williams, Lloyd Pierce, Dwane Casey, David Fizdale"
Kevin Durant on  OKC. I’m so used to him being a Golden State Warrior
You know KD came out after he left and said this wasnt true right? Just because he reinjured it doesn’t mean people get to make up the whole story.  https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/08/08/kevin-durant-denies-being-pressured-play-finals-pressure-was-hard-ignore/%3foutputType=amp
Woah I actually had a dream last night I was teaching Kevin Durant about Taoism. For some reason he wasn’t into it because the food didn’t taste good??? Didn’t really make any sense
"C'mon. He's even admitted he's 7'.   https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cq4lof/kevin_durant_when_im_talking_to_women_im_7_feet/  &gt;“For me, when I’m talking to women, I’m 7 feet,” he said. “In basketball circles, I’m 6-9.”  &gt;There’s actually a basketball reason behind Durant’s white lie. “But really, I’ve always thought it was cool to say I’m a 6-9 small forward,” he said. “Really, that’s the prototypical size for a small forward. Anything taller than that, and they’ll start saying, ‘Ah, he’s a power forward.’ ”  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall  &gt;Speaking to Bob Fitzgerald on KNBR, Durant put fact over fiction when answering the age-old question of how tall he really is. “Since I love you guys so much, I was recorded at 6’10” and three-quarters with no shoes, so with my shoes on I’m 7-feet,” Durant finally revealed.  &gt;So, why has Durant been listed at 6-foot-9 for so long?  &gt;“I just like messin’ with people. They just ask me so much… yeah, I just like messin’ with people.”"
"Now, replace the word Giannis with Kevin Durant or Lebron. Sound familiar?"
Carmelo Anthony never forced Jeremy Lin out and we'd have Linsanity.  LeBron was never born in Ohio so he didn't feel obligated to waste his early years carrying the bummy Cavs.   Kevin Durant never left for the warriors essentially making those years painfully uncompetitive. Literally Lebron was **the** only person capable of stopping them.  ~~Knicks never traded Kristaps~~ actually the Knicks deserve to suck.
I have a Bucks hat signed by JJ.  I also have a Washington Nationals hat signed by Kevin Durant.
Harden and Westbrook sat around a pentagram and tried to summon Kevin Durant
Yeah tell that GSW who openly said many occasions that they don't achieve what they did without Kevin Durant.   Curry did play in the Finals unlike Paul who missed games 6 and 7 entirely. Big difference and again not tit for tat. The Rockets lost two games back to back.   The Warriors blew a 3-1 lead with a team that went 73-9 and Curry still played in the Finals healthy or not.
"I would say Steph Curry or Kevin Durant would he the ideal #2, take your pick."
"Yes, Westbrook made Kevin Durant into a coward."

"AGAIN, Kevin Durant was right. With Westbrook, winning championship impossible"
Still hung up on Kevin Durant carrying your franchise out of pity before Russ scared him off. Learn from every star player that's ever played for you and move on☺
Stephon marbury?  Allen Iverson Kevin durant Joel embiid Dwight Howard
"Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Deandre Jordan, Caris LeVert, and Spencer Dinwiddie"
"""Are the Warriors better without Kevin Durant"" and other sorts of nonsense like this should get deleted."
"Kris Middelton sounds, looks, and plays like a Kevin Durant clone that stopped growing too soon lol"
Kevin Durant really wanted to play ball I see...
Bruh I really don't need to be reminded of this man. Kevin Durant esque
Do I really need to explain how Kawhi Leonard is a significantly better playoff performer than Kevin Durant when the latter isn't surrounded by the greatest team ever? Leonard's numbers *without* such a stacked team are comparable to Durant's *with* the stacked team.
Kevin durant is better than lebron james
"Do you remember the warriors who had Step curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson? And they still were giving it to y’all when KD went down. Two catastrophic injuries you know it’s true lol"
"Kawhi fit perfectly in the Raptors which enhanced him greatly last year, but this series proved he aint Kevin Durant or LeBron James.  He missed those open shots Lowry got him by being a great PG and those out of timeouts easy baskets by Nurse. When his midrange wasn't falling, he didn't have anything.  Lakers will roll through Denver and the East. I'm more excited about a potential KD vs LeBron Finals next year than the rest of these playoffs. AD has embarassed Jokic in every meeting they had this year and LeBron will feast on these perimeter defenders, not only that, Denver's style plays right into the Lakers strategy of three bigs."
Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook should pay the Nuggets for making all these elite teams in the West blowing 3-1 leads.
"The difference between Nick Nurse and Doc Rivers and having a great PG like Kyle Lowry showed for Kawhi this series. Kawhi was still decent, but when he didn't have it with his shot, there wasn't an easy basket for him created by Nurse in the sideline or a wide open three by Lowry, dude was attempting contested mid-range jumpers all game.  That was as disapointing as it gets, i mean, any talk about the best player in the world that doesn't have LeBron James or Kevin Durant is nonexistent. Kawhi is out, Giannis is out, Harden is out. Bring me KD vs LeBron Finals next year again."
jerami grant sounds a lot like kevin durant maybe that'll lead to some more made 3's for grant
"Curry, to me if we’re going on sheer greatness. Durant if we’re going on totality. Durant is the most dominant offensive player, ever. He’s 7’ and can shoot 3’s and defend. Plus he gets a boost by playing in more years. Curry also has/had paper thin ankles. However, in terms of basketball IQ, Curry is significantly better. Also, his skill set for him to be affective is more versatile offensively. I think what gets overlooked is the fact that Curry changed his game whereas Durant kept his game. And Durant definitely benefitted a shit ton from Curry. I posted on another thread, but I think the following video kinda backs up my statement. [3:20-3:30](https://youtu.be/GuP6-puSfRs) specifically shows how ridiculous Curry’s gravity is to the point where the entire defense forgot Kevin Durant was streaking down the sideline because they were loaded up on Curry.  With that said, again, KD is ridiculous. It’s really just splitting hairs and I don’t think there’s a wrong answer."
Kevin Durant left their team and Steph and Klay were both out for the season.
Jimmy Butler and Kevin Durant apparently have the same barber
Smart out here thinking he's Kevin Durant cuz he made a couple shots early LOL
"Per @bball_ref,  RJ Barrett one of only seven players in NBA history to tally at least 800 points, 250 rebounds, 100 assists, and 50 made 3PT's before turning 20.  The other six are:  Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Jayson Tatum, Luka Doncic and Kevin Durant"
"No rookie had to deal with what RJ had this season, this doesn't surprise me  Per @bball_ref,  RJ Barrett one of only seven players in NBA history to tally at least 800 points, 250 rebounds, 100 assists, and 50 made 3PT's before turning 20.  The other six are:  Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Jayson Tatum, Luka Doncic and Kevin Durant"
Kevin Durant by himself could lead a team to the promise land... that's why people were having mental breakdowns when he joined the Warriors. What's this thread's angle exactly? lmao.
"EVERYONE does not. Maybe bitter Cavs fans but thats about it. Whenever people talk about the Warriors 3 Championships, the only thing they now mention was how boring the NBA was at the time because Durant ruined the parity of the league. Nobody looks at Steph and says, ""well he's really only won two Championships because Kyrie and Kevin were injured for their first win,"" because they then have to add how it ""wouldn't have mattered if they played anyways""."
The entire golden state legacy is tarnished because of Kevin Durant going to that team. Regardless of how they got taken down the asterisk on golden state’s championships will always be the biggest.
"&gt;In the 2012 playoffs Kevin Durant was key to OKC making the finals  Actually this is revisionist. As bad as he is now, WB is the reason OKC beat SAS in 2012. He played great D that series and saved OKC multiple times. He also had a few boneheaded games but dude was legit amazing in that series and OKC doesn't win without him."
Because he’s kevin Durant. Curry isn’t fully responsible for his finals performances
"Kevin Durant is disrespected now cause he joined the warriors that’s how  No one remembers how insane kd was in that finals, Westbrook killed any chance he had at a ring that series"
"Probably because he scores more and defends better as a center. Jokic's passing is great but when you look at their offensive numbers, Jokic's offensive impact is closer to Ben Simmons (not bad) than it is to Joel Embiid. But even if offense is close defense is not even a question. Jokic hurts his team on defense by virtue of being a center who isn't a good defender. Meanwhile there is maybe one center in the league better than Embiid on defense.   Tbh a lot of this is the perception of the players and how the media frames their games. For example, fans and media always marvel at Jokic's three point shooting while telling Embiid he needs to shoot there less because he's not good at it. But that's not true. He's a very good shooter as a center. In fact I'm sure most of you reading this probably think Jokic shot better from three this year but he shot 31.4% to Embiid's 33.1. They are very comparable shooters and have been throughout their careers. But people like it when the big, unathletic white player shoots and hate it when the big, athletic black player shoots. Embiid's scoring ability dwarfs Jokic's but people just *like Jokic better.* And obviously Jokic can put up 40. But so can Brandon Ingram that doesn't make him Kevin Durant, that's why we have averages. Offensively he scores and assists close to the rate Ben Simmons does, scores a little more assists a little less. But which player does everyone hate?  To answer your question more succinctly: Because they are close to each other offensively."
"You see to find KD's flaws you have to understand why teams do certain things, they are way more obvious with his OKC run and little more subtle with his Warriors run. The Rockets actually took advantage of this issues in his game to make 2 playoff series close even though the warriors (according to most people) had the 2 best players in the series, the better supporting cast, and the better coach. Kevin Durant is a below average playmaker and a mediocre onball defender. Most of the time with the Warriors, those traits were hideable because Klay/Iggy/Dray covered most things on defense allowing him to play weakside help and Curry/Dray/Iggy made most of the playmaking decisions. The Rockets forcing them to iso was a plan to let KD beat them and it was going well both years (One year CP3 got injured and the next the Rockets had came back from down 20 to tie the game up) with a massive talent gap.     Now OKC Kevin Durant has multiple playoff runs shooting under 33% from 3, has been locked up multiple series, has multiple runs with more TOs than assist, and is a shitty onball defender. He was never good at dealing with doubles or heavy perimeter pressure and it shows when you watch him vs the grizz/Spurs/Mavs/Warriors. His flaws always get glossed over because the thought of KD is better than the reality of KD and his Warriors runs shield majority of his career"
"Reminds me of one of my favorite Kobe stories  &gt;I was invited to Las Vegas this past Summer to help Team USA with their conditioning before they head off to London, and as we know they would eventually bring home the Gold (USA). I've had the opportunity to work with Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade in the past but this would be my first interaction with Kobe. We first met three days before the first scrimmage, on the day of the first practice, early July. It was a brief conversation where we talked about conditioning, where he would like to be by the end of the Summer, and we talked a little bit about the hustle of the Select Team. Then he got my number and I let him know that if he ever wanted some extra training he could hit me up any time.  &gt;The night before the first scrimmage I remember I was just watched ""Casablanca"" for the first time and it was about 3:30 AM. I lay in bed, slowly fading away when I hear my cell ring. It was Kobe. I nervously picked up.   &gt;""Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I'm not disturbing anything right?""  &gt;""Uhh no, what's up Kob?""  &gt;""Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that's all.""  &gt;I checked my clock. 4:15 AM.  &gt;""Yeah sure, I'll see you in the facility in a bit.""  &gt;It took me about twenty minutes to get my gear and out of the hotel. When I arrived and opened the room to the main practice floor I saw Kobe. Alone. He was drenched in sweat as if he had just taken a swim. It wasn't even 5AM.  &gt;We did some conditioning work for the next hour and fifteen minutes. Then we entered the weight room, where he would do a multitude of strength training exercises for the next 45 minutes. After that we parted ways and he went back to the practice floor to shoot. I went back to the hotel and crashed. Wow.  &gt;I was expected to be at the floor again at about 11 AM. I woke up feeling sleepy, drowsy, and almost pretty much every side effect of sleep deprivation. Thanks, Kobe. I had a bagel and headed to the practice facility.  &gt;This next part I remember very vividly. All the Team USA players were there, feeling good for the first scrimmage. LeBron was talking to Carmelo if I remember correctly and Coach Krzyzewski was trying to explain something to Kevin Durant. On the right side of the practice facility was Kobe by himself shooting jumpers. And this is how our next conversation went -- I went over to him, patted him on the back and said, ""Good work this morning.""  &gt;""Huh?""  &gt;""Like, the conditioning. Good work.""  &gt;""Oh. Yeah, thanks Rob. I really appreciate it.""  &gt;""So when did you finish?""  &gt;""Finish what?""  &gt;""Getting your shots up. What time did you leave the facility?""  &gt;""Oh just now. I wanted 800 makes so yeah, just now.""  &gt;My jaw dropped. Mother of holy God..."
"Take this for what you will but here are the 2000-2019 MVP’s ranked by PIPM  1.  2009 LeBron James (9.9) 2. 2010 LeBron James (8.7) 3. 2016 Stephen Curry (8.2) 4. 2004 Garnett (8.1) 5. 2015 Stephen Curry (8.1) 6. 2013 LeBron James (7.8) 7. 2019 Giannis Antetumnkpo (7.8) 8. 2000 Shaq (7.2) 9. 2003 Tim Duncan (7.1) 10. 2012 LeBron James (7.0) 11. 2017 Russell Westbrook (6.8) 12. 2018 James Harden (5.8) 13. 2002 Tim Duncan (5.7) 14. 2005 Steve Nash (5.5) 15. 2014 Kevin Durant (5.2) 16. 2007 Dirk Nowitzki (5.1) 17. 2008 Kobe Bryant (4.4) 18. 2006 Steve Nash (4.4) 19. 2001 Allen Iverson (3.2) 20. 2011 Derrick Rose (2.8)   So according to this Rose, AI, ‘06 Nash, Kobe, Dirk  Don’t nessecarily agree but it isn’t too egregious"
"Steph curry is the biggest reason the warriors had such dominant seasons.  Here’s how I rank the top NBA players if everyone were healthy.  1. Kawhi Leonard: beats giannis because he can shoot.  Both play great D.  2. I lean Lebron here over giannis because of his b-ball IQ  3. Giannis: most dominant player during regular season on both offense and defense  4. Kevin Durant: most talented offensive player in the league  5. Steph curry: the biggest reason the warriors had such dominant seasons.  His 3 pt shooting changes the NBA.  I personally like curry over Durant but Durant does what he does at 7 ft tall.  curry is def lb for lb the best basketball player in the world imo  6. Anthony Davis: I put him here based on his talent and skill level  7. James harden: one of the greatest offensive talents of all time but doesn’t get it done in the playoffs.  Also, I think his play style works best during the regular season when defenses are shaky.  Kind of a front runner / paper tiger.  8. Jokic: only criticism is that he’s slow and not very athletic.  But probably the best passer in the league.  9. Luka: unbelievable trajectory. 6’8 pg with incredible passing ability as well as scoring ability.  10. Embiid: the only reason he’s this low is because I think he really loses value when he gets tired.  Everyone does but he gets tired quickly.  Otherwise one of the most dominant guys in the league.  11. Dame:  best pg in the league not named steph curry.  Also has a similar shooting range as steph.  12. Jimmy butler:  two way player who knows how to get fouled.  13. Jayson Tatum: many times is the best player on the court.  Dope step back and great midrange game.  Has improved his passing as well.  Good defender.  14. PG13:  so fun to watch this guy.  Very smooth player and great shooter.  15. Russel Westbrook: one of the fastest players in the league. Great in transition but not a great jump shooter.  HM: KAT, Ben Simmons, Jaylen brown, Aldridge, Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy gobert"
"He deserves it man. To me, the warriors sans Durant were a largely homegrown, very likeable squad full of deserving players. Fuck them anyway though. They were like star football players who got A's and were still really nice to unpopular kids. There isn't really much of a reason to hate players not named Kevin or Draymond but I still do."
"Of the top of my head, I can name LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, James Harden, Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic. I might have missed some. I think he’s definitely top 20 and might even be top 15, but he doesn’t crack top 10 yet. He most definitely will soon looking at his trajectory. But not yet. He’s sort of lurking behind or around Butler or Kristaps who I consider top 15."
"No, I'm not saying they are all equal. I'm saying there isn't anything in Westbrooks history that would suggest he was really that big of a factor in them getting to a finals. Look at Westbrooks career from year 1 to now. Where is there any indication that the overall package that Westbrook brings leads to much winning? He made 1 finals - in a year that he played alongside 2 guys we will be telling our grandkids about. Tell me playing with a guy like Kevin Durant and James Harden (who put up one of the best 6th man seasons we will ever see and actually played 30+ mins), Serge Ibaka was damn good by that point too, tell me that team needs much at all to be good enough to make and lose a finals.   Let's try and put this into another context. Let's say you've got a team with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. Without knowing what else is on that team is it hard for you to imagine them dragging their squad to a finals? What about say Lebron and Klay Thompson? Or Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry. We can play this game for days, really. If we can see fairly easily that he has a way of playing that doesn't exactly elevate his team much than you are actually allowed to revisit how important he actually was. Russell Westbrook is a guy who does a good job giving the impression that he is super important by inserting himself into the action like he is, but the results don't support it.  And before someone chimes in with the old ""Harden was not the player he is now"", that's true. He didn't handle the ball like he does now, how could he. Don't be fooled by the 6th man tag. This 6th man was 6th in the entire NBA in win shares that year, his ws/48 was exactly the same as Kevin Durant (.230). So you are right, of course, everyone except Lebron has needed a Pippen. There is your Pippen. In fact, and I know defense doesn't translate that well to advanced stats, but Pippen never even came close to .230 ws/48in his career - ever. Then Harden left, no more finals.  Once you stop being impressed by making a single finals alongside 2 of the best players you will ever see, the true net impact of Westbrook becomes very, very clear.  He still plays the same, it just took a long time for people to realize that he only experienced success when he had such phenomenal talent on the court that he could make all the same highlights, and lowlights, and still come out on the winning end of things."
so you think the reason kevin durant plus steph curry plus klay thompson plus draymond green beat james harden plus chris paul sitting in street clothes was just a lack of adjustments?
"you gotta love comments like this.  when nash first came to phoenix, they were predicted to have low-to-mid-40's wins and lose in the first round.  then they lose in the conference finals to the popovich/duncan/ginobili/parker spurs, with those guys basically all in their physical primes, and the analysis is ""man, you just don't know how to coach in the playoffs, do you?""  people think you're going to lose in the 1st round and you make the team so good that now you get criticized for losing to the friggin' spurs in the conference finals?  then amare gets hurt the whole next year, everyone expects the team to suck, so they...make the conference finals again.  no championship mike?  what a loser.  then the next year, they play a series with the spurs that just so happens to be the two best teams meeting in the 2nd round (either team was dominating the jazz/cavs after this series), and they again lose to peak spurs in 6, even with controversial suspensions and nash's broken nose.  only a top 2 team behind a dynasty?  let me know when you have a system that can beat a top 10 all-time player plus 2 more hall of famers with the GOAT coach.  fast forward to houston.  people predict the rockets will win 48 games and instead they win 55 but lose to the 61 win spurs (3-2 even before kawhi got hurt) and again mike was apparently supposed to win it all i guess.  then kevin durant gets hated on by the whole world for supposedly ruining the nba by forming a team no one could beat, and mike d'antoni's team somehow leads them 3-2 before a devastating injury and then plays the only other competitive series they would ever play the next year and the response is ""yeah, see, couldn't beat an unbeatable team, i told y'all this style just doesn't work, those other teams who went 5-32 against the warriors in the playoffs, those are the good styles""."
Do you know who he is?   He’s Kevin Durant.  I’m not worried at all. I have winning MVP and FMVP next year.
"For sure. If ONE person could ever come back from a torn achilles and still be a superstar, it’s Kevin Durant."
Do you know who he is?  He’s Kevin Durant.  Doesn’t have to prove anything to me. KD will be the MVP and the Nets will be favorites to win it all when the playoffs start.
Kevin Durant (pre ruined legacy)
&gt; “It will probably be the last time they will be in the Finals.”  - [The Hardest Road](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2019/08/kevin-durant-toronto-raptors-fans-cheered-injury-response-nba-finals/amp)
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Draymond Green and Steven Adams"
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Anthony Davis  tough squad to beat"
Dude. We were! Look at the finals performance from LeBron. Absolutely insane. We win that finals with Love or Kyrie. Both? No doubt. Sucks the Warriors added Kevin “hardest road” Durant for ‘17 and ‘18 because Cavs were money
Not as much as scarletts  -Kevin Durant
"The first was pretty great to watch IMO. They lost that xmas game to the Cavs and Curry wasn't playing that well, people act like the title was guaranteed from day 1, but after that loss people had some real questions, and almost everyone (at that time) thought the Finals were going to be super competitive.   But after that they went on like a 23-4 run where they were winning by like 12 a night playing gorgeous basketball. Durant got hurt til the playoffs with like 22 games to go, they struggled for a couple, but then they were the 15-16 team, 14 game win streak, winning by like 16 game, incredible to watch.  They reestablished that energy from the year before, Steph was reestablished as the focal point of the system more so, and when KD came back for those playoffs they didn't change much, except now Harrison Barnes was Kevin fucking Durant buying in to that style. I think in the second half/playoffs they were the best team of all time while still maintaining that incredible flourish and fun and holy shit-ness.   They won the first 15 playoff games by 16 pts a night. When Steph and KD were together after that CLE game, they were 41-5 and I think playing the highest level, most unbeatable basketball of all time. I get that they were the villains, but if you love the sport I feel like it was amazing to see see basketball played at its absolute peak (along with like 2-3 other teams in history). I mean they went 82-16. Once they recovered from the KD injury, they won 30 games they tried in in a row by 16 points a game. Only losing to that insane shooting CLE game 4.  The next two seasons I 100% agree, especially the last one w/all the KD contract drama. team identity changed. They were *just* a great team in the history of the league that has had a lot of great teams. But I think people have forgotten just how incredible that first season was."
"I'm right there with both of you. People are gonna just say we're playing victims as Lakers fans, but if people take their emotions out of it and look at it logically, historically we aren't a free agent destination. We're always used as a leverage play, NY and LA don't just get every free agent. Hell people were talking mad trash year after year when guys kept passing us up and we were begging them to take our money. LeBron was/is the only player to do so and that was because of our assets and location 2nd. Because of him, all of a sudden everyone's narrative about the Lakers getting everyone is back.   Since 2013, this is just some of the players that could care less about this magical big market everyone on reddit seems to think matters:  LaMarcus Aldridge  Carmelo Anthony  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Kemba Walker  Paul George  Nic Batum  Dwight Howard  Kent Bazemore  I think I should remind people, this got so bad the Lakers handed out ridiculous contracts to Loul Deng and Timofey Mozgov..."
They were dominant but not dominating the league as a whole. There is a reason they all lined up and asked Kevin Durant to come play with them. I’m not positive that they would of won a championship at all if Kylie and Love didn’t get hurt in the 1st Finals appearance. Still the softest move I’ve ever seen a Superstar do. The answer is no.
He literally explained it after he said it lmao. He chose the name because it's a biblical name and didn't like being associated with death since his number 35 is in reference to his coach that was murdered at 35.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/sports/basketball/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-jersey.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/sports/basketball/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-jersey.html)
"I've seen this ""KD isn't 7 feet tall"" take more than a few times lately and just...why? KD himself admitted in 2016 that he's taller than that and that he lied about it. Dude didn't want to be typecast as a PF/C.  https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/the-great-debate-is-over-kevin-durant-finally-admitted-his-real-height/"
I have played pickup ball pretty much most of my life and played in college for a little bit (Not NCAA) And I literally don't see House making much of a difference. The Rockets gameplan was rotten at its core and so was their leadership. House wasnt going to somehow stop the Lakers destroying PJ Tucker on the boards or prevent his teammates from playing lackadaisical defense. If we were talking about Kevin Durant then yes. But Danuel House was not moving the needle.
"anybody could have done that. Kevin Durant is one of the best players in the history of the game. is that supposed to be an impressive resume? should every member of the 92-95 bulls be treated equally responsible for the the threepeat? They were legit contenders because of Durant, in the same way Lebron and Kawhi basically make contenders out of whatever team they were on."
"Assuming 100% health...  1 - LeBron James 2 - Kevin Durant 3 - Stephen Curry 4 - Kawhi Leonard 5 - Giannis Antetokounmpo 6 - Nikola Jokic 7 - Anthony Davis 8 - James Harden 9 - Damian Lillard 10 - Luka Doncic  PERSONAL OPINION! I can not move Luka higher, I physically cant. Jokic better than AD imo, better leader. Curry above Leonard may be unpopular but goddamn if we get 100% healthy Steph on a KDless team... idk man."
"This is going way too far lol. How is Kawhi’s 2nd FMPV not a good one. Nobody compares to Kevin Durant Warriors cause that team was literally unfair. Would you have called it an illegitimate FMVP if the Rockets knocked the Warriors out without KD and the Raptors beat them... No???? You might as well call any title, not just FMPV, illegitimate if someone had an injury. Fuck the Warriors 2015 title, fuck the Cavs 2016 title,  nah, injuries happened, so they don’t count. Saying that completely invalidates his playoff run up until the finals. What was wrong with the other teams...oh right nothing. To even get to the Finals as the best player you have to have played at a FMVP level. It’s as good of a FMPV as anyone else in NBA history."
His 1st FMVP as the 4th best option (you can make the argument Boris Diaw was the 4th best player)   And his 2nd FMVP was only possible cause Kevin Durant got injured
The people saying that Lebron just choked overlook the fact that this defense was also great against the Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant the previous 2 rounds.
"KEVIN DURANT -   “You know what the stars are saying?,” NBA analyst Colin Cowherd recently asked. “This is why KD left. It’s all about Westbrook’s stats.” But what does KD actually think? That’s been a little less clear. He did however, say the following of his new home with the Golden State Warriors: “I feel really grateful to play for a team like that and play with a bunch of players who are selfless and enjoy the game in its purest form. They make it about the players, they make it about the environment, so it was really an easy choice.”  Was this a veiled poke at Westbrook? He certainly seemed to think so. His response?  “That’s cute.”"
This is the best nickname in the nba right now.   Last place is Kevin Durant - the servant
Giannis isn't LeBron or Kevin durant. If he leaves the Bucks it might not even be the biggest basketball news story that week.
"I hate to say it because I don't like to be the ""party pooper"", but it was obvious 8-9 years ago this would be Westbrook's path.  He should have NEVER shot the ball more than Kevin Durant on any given night. Yet, there he was doing it.  Westbrook is an out of this world player, but that has never meant he is a championship player. Unless your name is Steph Curry (or Isiah Thomas - Pistons), nobody under 6'6"" can be the primary star player of a team and expect to win a championship. He tried to be co-primary star with KD, and that was their downfall. And Westbrook can't be a number two player either.  So he's not a championship player.     Edit: Yes, it's a dumb idea to build a team around someone below 6'6"" as the primary star.   1960-1969, 1980-2019; 4 championships won by people below 6'6"" as the primary super star (Thomas, Curry, Wade). And we are being generous putting dwyane wade in there given that he had shaq and suspicious referees. 4/50 = 8%. (I don't know enough about the 70's to know who the star players were, but if 5 out of 6 decades are like this, I suspect the trend is similar).   If you're comfortable with building a franchise around a player below 6'6"" and falling into the probability frame of being lucky enough to be the one team to win a championship one out of every ten years with a primary star below 6'6"", go for it."
I'd take Kawhi Leonard over Kevin Durant. He's put up godly playoff numbers without a 73-9 core around him for three consecutive postseasons.
"You think a trio of Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and Michael Porter JR is comparable to Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson?  Or Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh?"
That’s not how you spell Kevin Durant
"Oh, do you mean the 16-17 Warriors that won 73 games? Or do you mean the 17-18 Warriors featuring the previous team but with an extra Kevin Durant?  Or do you mean the 3-peat Bulls that won 55 games without Jordan playing? Jordan had the most super of super teams lol"
You got a time machine and a Kevin Durant clone?
That coach? Kevin Durant
"Every superstar has limitations but not to the extent that Giannis has. It doesn't matter what the system is or who the coach is. Put LeBron on any team, they'll perform in the playoffs. Same with KD, AD, Steph, Kawhi, etc.  Until Giannis improves, he will always under perform in the playoffs. Giannis now has to deal with Kevin Durant in the east, a player who's game transitions perfectly well into the playoffs. Giannis will lose if they match up every time."
Kevin Durant is a 7 footer that can dribble btw  Edit: who**
Including injured players:  1. Stephen Curry 2. Klay Thompson 3. Kyle Korver 4. JJ Redick 5. Damian Lillard 6. Seth Curry 7. Duncan Robinson 8. Kevin Durant 9. Davis Bertans 10. Doug McDermott
my favorite stat is during the 2018-19 season BG hit 3 at a higher volume and higher % than kevin durant
"Jordan most certainly did not face tougher competition. He didn't have to jump to super teams because he was on the super team of the era with the greatest coach and the greatest nr 2. He himself admits that he wouldn't have won without scottie (he says so in the last dance). When Jordan went to Baseball his team without him won 55 games. When LeBron leaves a team they usually plummet to the bottom of the league.   LeBron had to face one of the best teams of all time in its prime FOUR times... going 1-3 in those matchups is not a terrible record. After MJ's return from Baseball, who was the best player he faced in the playoffs? Pre-prime Shaq? They went 1-1. Karl Malone, Reggie Miller, John Stockton are just worse Basketball players compared to Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.  I'm not saying MJ isn't the GOAT but comparing MJ and LBJ based on Finals W/L alone is severely limiting. A LOT has to go right to win the finals and most of it isn't down to one player. There are things that Jordan did that LeBron hasn't done. There are also things that LeBron did that Jordan hasn't done."
"You are saying he faced has many hall of famers but were they as good we are talking about Kevin Durant, Steph curry, Tim Duncan, and you also need to factor in where they were in their carreer Magic was going down when he one his first for exemple.  Also were Lebron's team has good as MJ's team, in Miami maybe but no even sure and that's just 4 years, with Kyrie and Love not even close but even that they were healthy just a few years ?  MJ played under Phil Jackson, one of the best coach ever, what about Lebron, not even close.  Jordan never lost in the finals, but he sure has lost in the playoffs.  I'm not saying Lebron is better but there so many things to factor in that it is way more complex than that, and the only thing we could agree on is that they are both Goat's of their era's."
"the only time steph was doubled as aggressively as harden was this year, was last year in the finals and they lost. You can't aggressively double off Kevin fucking durant the same way you can any of Harden's teammates."
"No of course we don’t know.  I could make up an arbitrary number to give you but truly I have no idea.  All I know is that out of the many that have gotten this injury, all but one have come back significantly worse.  You can put whatever number you want on the different players, but it’s not good.  As a KD fan I’d be very happy with 70-80%, so let’s hope.  But as I said I really can’t see him being a top 3 player anymore.  I’d love to be proven wrong, and it’s not impossible, just very unlikely.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2019/06/11/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-news-recovery-history  This is a fairly good read.  Obviously there’s a lot more that they didn’t name, but as you can see, some very talented players who didn’t recover well.  Let’s hope KD is exception #2"
"Not sure how you can say that CP3 and Harden didn't work when they were eliminated in Game 7 by a historically improbable bad shooting night against a dynasty in 2018. They were the closest that any team had gone against the Warriors after adding Kevin Durant. If they win that Game 7, we're talking about a completely different issue. We would be lambasting the Warriors for thinking they even had a dynasty, and so on. The only breakdown that happened was in 2019 when CP3 didn't like the fact that Harden became heavily ball dominant while CP3 was sitting as a cold secondary option. Could they have made amends? Could Morey have made a model that allowed for CP3 to be more complementary? Maybe, but ultimately that's not what happened and that's why CP3 was traded.  The thing about statistical ingenuity is that humans don't work in a mathematical model. We are illogical and irrational beings from time to time. Having said that, the price to pay for Westbrook was incredible. I think it's too early to judge him based on one year, but at the same time, he's not getting any younger and history shows that players with high athleticism don't usually age all that well. Personally, I think it's less of a Westbrook problem, and more of an issue with how Morey sees the game. He focuses too much on efficiencies (layups, dunks, 3s) and not enough on how the opponents will guard his attacking mentality."
&gt;There is no science or math that backs up your original claim re: KD vs LeBron on defense  Kevin Durant Defensive Rating past two seasons: 108  Lebron James Defensive Rating this season: 106
Seattle: probably Kevin Durant? lol
This guy doesn't know who Kevin Durant is.
*Kevin Durant likes this*
"He was ahead of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Kawhi Leonard. Would you say that he’s better than any of those players?"
"If you are the coach, and Kevin Durant is on your team, and Russell Westbrook is on your team, you are going to ride your guy to the finish line, win or lose. You aren't going to let a shitty scorer determine your fate are you?  Do you think there is any scenario where Phil Jackson would have let the Lakers go away from Kobe? Or Jordan on the Bulls? If Lamar Odom takes 30 shots because Kobe looked like he didn't want it is that gonna fly. Fuck that. Of course not. But then again both those teams had point guards who knew who they needed to learn on if they were going to win."
"Obviously I'm biased but those Finals were the highest level of basketball I've ever seen.   People forget that Cleveland offense was one of the greatest ever constructed and to me the best iteration of that team with the addition of Korver and a healthy Kevin Love, they'd definitely beat the 2016 Cavs in a head to head I think. The Warriors were just better defensively and Durant went bonkers."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and James Harden. I think he's on par with Luka Doncic and Damien Lillard just outside the top 5."
Kevin Durant was hitting everything and we were only down by 5. Warriors still had two thirds of their death lineup.   Do you think it's not fair until they have fucking time-adjusted prime Michael Jordan and LeBron on the team too?
“I’m Kevin Durant” Kevin Durant
Don’t forget all 12 minutes of Calf Strain Kevin Durant
&gt;I think sometimes people forget how dominant Kevin Durant was before Golden State.  not a soul out there forgot that.
Unlike the Warriors who drafted Kevin Durant.
"Not hard to think of 30 guys better than WB.  This is in no particular order:   1. Kawhi 2. LeBron 3. Anthony Davis 4, Paul George 5. Jokic 6. Giannis 7. Khris Middleton 8. Jimmy Butler 9. Bam Adebayo 10. Embiid 11. Karl Towns 12. Tatum 13. Jaylen Brown 14. Kemba Walker 15. Damian Lillard 16. Devin Booker 17. Brandon Ingram 18. Jrue Holiday 19. Rudy Gobert 20. Donovan Mitchell 21. Klay Thompson 22. Bradley Beal 23. Kyrie Irving 24. Kevin Durant 25. Kyle Lowry 26. Pascal Siakam  27. Kristaps Porzingis 28. Luka Doncic 29. Jamal Murray 30. Nurkic  Could stretch it even further and say folks like Zach LaVine, Jon Isaac or Brook Lopez are better."
Kevin Durant.
No lebron is not winning a title with Westbrook most likely and lebron is my favorite player. Their playstyles clash big time. Kawhi and kd probably have better chances cause they are better fits with him. Kevin Durant wasn’t perfect but Westbrook is too inconsistent and unreliable.
Except Westbrook was actually really good in OKC and even rivaled Kevin Durant in terms of impact during a couple of runs.
This is why I always defend Kevin Durant and his stint with okc  Tell me you can say for certain any of kawhi/kd/lebron would win a ring with Westbrook if he was their costar for all of 2010. You can’t. Westbrook’s highs are great but they aren’t consistent and his lows are horrid.
"It is matchup dependent in the playoffs as you go deeper. The Rockets went against ascending GSW team past few years. That GSW was a good team, and became All Time Great Team with Kevin Durant. The Rockets are good team lead by Harden, but in playoffs against quality team with good players and coaching staff can expose Rockets weaknesses. Good constructed teams will trap harden when he is handling the ball to intiate the offense. Those shooters Harden pass to are good, but not deadly if the other team can rotate quick enough. It becomes grind physically and mentally. They have another player in Westbrook to intiate the offense and move Harden off ball running PnR, side PnR, elevator, and ETC. Westbrook can't shoot well enough for those other plays to work efficiently. Good teams are willing to let Westbrook to shoot 3s and midrange, and they will pack the paint double at specific angles. Their defense is good enough in regular season, but against certain matchups they will get exposed in playoffs. This Rockets team is good, but there are good enough teams in the West that are better than them in next 2 years to prevent them to reach the Finals."
Imagine if they had someone like Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant didnt hit a single midrange shot this season
"It’s a combination of whether Harden wants to go to GSW to pull a Kevin Durant since I feel like Houston will want to honor his opinion and whether that’s the best offer they can get.   I don’t think Harden would want to go to GSW. Golden States’ offer might also not be as good as, say 76ers either, who could offer Simmons. GSW’s picks aren’t going to be very valuable in the future and they don’t have that abundance of picks stashed either (unlike the PG or AD trades). Plus, Wiggins contract is pretty negative that they’ll need an additional pick just to make up for it."
"LeBron James Kevin Durant James Harden Chris Paul Anthony Davis Kyle Lowry Jalen Brown Kemba Walker Jayson Tatum Giannis Antetokounpo Khris Middleton Jimmy Butler Kawhi Leonard Paul George Jamal Murray Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Klay Thompson Draymond Green Luka Doncic Kristaps Porzingis Damian Lillard CJ Mccollum Devin Booker Ben Simmons Joel Embiid Donovan Mitchell Rudy Gobert Jrue Holiday Brandon Ingram Kyrie Irving Bradley Beal  John Wall Karl Anthony Towns Ja Morant Kevin Love Zion Williamson Nikola Vucevic Bam Adebayo Demar Derozan Zach Lavine  I'd easily take those players above Westbrook. Westbrook is raw talent but has poor basketball IQ. He can't make any adjustments because he only knows how to play one way. There's a reason the last time Westbrook shot above 50% in the playoffs besides game 4 was in 2016. All the players I mentioned above can adjust their game and are simply better pairings than Russell Westbrook. I felt bad for the Rockets because Harden should have had the ball every possession but because they couldn't figure out what to do with Russ, they just gave him the ball instead and had Harden stand around. Like I said, Westbrook is a top 20 player to me IF what you want is someone who can carry your team from the trenches and want to sell tickets. He's however, not a very good player from a championship building process. The fact that OKC became a better team without Russ shows just how replaceable Russ can be. The fact that the Rockets, with CP3, was a better version of these Rockets tells me enough. And the fact that Russ continues to play only one way is enough evidence for me to view him as a liability in the playoffs."
... Do Russell Westbrook (twice) and Kevin Durant suddenly not count or something? What the fuck universe is this?
"Why not? Why does every star get the luxury of good spacing, but when KD does it all of sudden it’s an issue? I know Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson is overkill, but so is Andre Roberson and Kevin Durant.   If you aren’t going to give him full credit for his Warriors runs, then you have to give him more credit for his Thunder run."
that piece is kevin durant
You misspelled Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant has said he isn't a leader and doesn't want to be a leader because he doesn't care for all that stuff.
"It's not the bench, it's the wings. It's the most important position in the league - especially on defense - and the Warriors went from having Andre Iguodala and Kevin Durant to Andrew Wiggins and...Juan Toscano-Anderson?  It's also a position where teams hoard talent (see: Clippers) and filling that space won't come easy.  They need to hit on this draft pick, and even if they do, that player won't be ready right away."
"Meanwhile Russ had to play with garbage like [checks notes] James Harden, Kevin Durant, Paul George, James Harden again"
Opinion: LeBron James is just another version of Kevin Durant
"Kevin ""I Guess You Don't Know Who I Am"" Durant"
Kevin Durant?

He was a professional brick layer in the playoffs.  Also shooting above 43% isn’t impressive for “a 7ft unguardable player”.
"&gt; Kawhi Leonard from 2016-19 (per 100 possessions): 37.6 points / 11.2 RPG / 5.7 APG / 2.6 SPG / 1.1 BPG, 62.0% TS  &gt; Kevin Durant from 2011-2016 (per 100 possessions): 35.9 points / 9.9 RPG / 4.7 APG / 1.4 SPG / 1.4 BPG, 58.0% TS  I don't give a shit about Kevin Durant's Golden State numbers. Kawhi Leonard (or LeBron James) would've put up equally impressive numbers with fucking Steph Curry and Klay Thompson around them. It's not a coincidence that Durant's playoff performance skyrocketed as soon as he joined the Warriors."
Wow Kevin Durant is better than Harrison Barnes.  What an astute observation.    I love when warrior fans try and downplay how absolutely filthy stacked their team was lmao
&gt; Kawhi has only won when he joins an already established top tier system  Did you just forget that Kevin Durant only won a championship after joining a 73-9 core? LMAO.
"Kawhi Leonard and it's not particularly close. His playoff numbers over the last few seasons rival Kevin Durant's Golden State numbers without nearly as good of a team around him.  If you take their playoff averages (without the fucking super team around Durant), it's not debatable:   \- Kawhi Leonard from 2016-19 (per 100 possessions): 37.6 points / 11.2 RPG / 5.7 APG / 2.6 SPG / 1.1 BPG, 62.0% TS  \- Kevin Durant from 2011-2016 (per 100 possessions): 35.9 points / 9.9 RPG / 4.7 APG / 1.4 SPG / 1.4 BPG, 58.0% TS"
Kevin Durant ? Lmao how
NBA Bubble jersey sales:  1. LeBron James 2. Luka Doncic 3. Anthony Davis 4. Jayson Tatum 5. Giannis A. 6. Stephen Curry 7. Kevin Durant 8. Damian Lillard 9. Kawhi Leonard 10. Jimmy Butler  11. Kemba Walker 12. Kyrie Irving 13. Russell Westbrook 14. Nikola Jokic 15. Ja Morant
"No, look at Damian Lillard. Kevin Durant is a baby and not a winner or a leader. He couldn’t do shit in OKC and needed Steph to fall back on."
I see Anthony Davis is taking the Kevin Durant route to all of his titles.
old Deron Williams + old Kyle Korver = peak Kevin Durant duh
The only shining light is having the pleasure of looking at ~~Margot Robbie~~ Kevin Durant perform.
"Those players like LeBron and Durant wasn’t contending on All-NBA 3rd teams like Pierce. Players who beat Pierce into 3rd teams is like this Marion, Jermaine O’Neal, Kevin Love, Amar’e."
"The Seattle Supersonics two worst regular season win totals come in their very first season (67-68, 23 wins) and their last season (07-08, 20 wins) in Seattle.  The first season the Sonics rolled with a starting lineup of Tom Meschery, Walt Hazzard, Al Tucker, Tommy Kron, and Dorie Murrey.  Those would be our worst starters for 40 years, until rookie Kevin Durant (age 19, 212 lbs.), Jeff Green, Chris Wilcox, Earl Watson, and Kurt Thomas."
However wrong OKC fans may have been about overrating what were always Role Players it doesn't change that those players were never going to push us to championship contention on their own. They were perfect in their roles with the 2016 Thunder. But we saw what happened when they didn't have Kevin Durant on the court. Their roles became bigger and they weren't able to produce to that level. And that's where Russ comes in and takes on the load of what was once two superstars.
"“I REACHED OUT TO KEVIN DURANT FOR THIS CHAPTER. THE exchange, via text, ended as follows: HIM: Fuck u, fuck your sources and your book. How much money you paying me for my chapter?”  How much did you pay KD for his chapter?"
"What do you think actually drives Kevin Durant? You spoke a lot about your spats in GS and what maybe led to him eventually leaving, but do you think he will ever be satisfied with a franchise in his career?"
Why do you dislike Kevin Durant?
"Second best guy on Barry's title team was Jamaal Wilkes.  &amp;#x200B;  Second best guy on the Durant's title teams was Kevin Durant.  &amp;#x200B;  Barry was also a better passer, better defender, and despite being the biggest asshole in the league...a better leader. He also deserved a MVP but yet again, he is a tremendous asshole. It's the thing that's stymied his rep, guy should at least be remembered as well as Hondo."
Add Kevin Durant to that list as well. Dude averaged 30 at age 21.
"That Warriors team who went 73-9 and then added KD is THE BEST TEAM OF ALL TIME. There was never a more stacked team. MJ NEVER had to face a team that good. He didn’t. I know we all like to glorify how tough it was in the 90s and how much better the teams were, but there was NEVER a team as good as that Warriors team. Likely the best back court of all time, comprised of the best shooters of all time, plus Draymond (DPOTY), Kevin fucking Durant, and a solid supporting cast with guys like Iggy. MJ never faced that."
"If Kevin Durant will return to 100% which is long shot and play until mid 30s, maybe he could be a close second. But KD has to surpass Wilt first in terms of scoring titles."
&gt;one of the best offensive seasons by a player ever  Insane hyperbole much? Is Carmelo the first player to average 29 ppg on decent efficiency on a mid-tier team or something? There have to be at least 50 scoring seasons more impressive than Carmelo's.   You can almost take any season from LeBron on his first Cleveland run and he'll have about the same number of points with better efficiency. Kevin Durant has like 5-6 better scoring seasons. Jordan has like 10. Wilt probably has like 10. Kobe probably has like 7-8. Harden has like 3-4. Shaq has 3-4.
Kevin Durant.
"“Flip Saunders, the late Minnesota Timberwolves coach and executive, often said he referred to Kevin Garnett as “6-foot-13” because, like Durant now, the former MVP feared people would view him as a center as opposed to a power forward.“  dude was 7ft for sure"
"Did you deadass just say he doesn't have loyalty to Kyrie? Kyrie LEFT us in the off-season, dude. By the way, KD absolutely did take a meeting with the Celtics, it was quite a big deal. Tom Brady was at the meeting, [Here's an article about it.](https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2016/07/02/everything-we-know-about-bostons-meeting-with-kevin-durant/) The second time around we couldn't even afford KD. I guess you also decided to leave out Ray Allen and KG straight up forcing a trade here? Or Shaq coming? or Al Horford? LeBron and Dwight were straight up bitter rivals of the Celtics at both of their FA periods. Do you think they'd want to play here? There's a reason there was so much uproar when KD went to the Warriors, signing for rivals straight up was unheard of."
"And the Lakers were pretty much the only team that could do this and have it work out. If any other franchise decided to trade away years worth of assets for the hope that a star would sign in the future then it likely would not work and they would be ridiculed (see: Knicks).  And it isn't even always successful for the Lakers. Before LeBron decided to sign, they were saving cap space for Paul George. Before that, it was Kawhi. Before that, it was Durant. Before that, it was Kevin Love. They tried this for 5-6 years before they got someone to commit, and every time they failed they knew it didn't matter because someone would want to go there next season. It was only a matter of time until a star made it there. A small market team can't just bank on a different all-NBA player trying to force his way to their team every year until one is successful, they'd be seen as insane."
"Kevin Durant did indeed have top 10 all time talent and if LeBron did not exist he'd probably be a consensus top 10 guy with multiple MVP's and probably a ring as the guy.  His scoring is unfair. Kobe had to work to get his mid range shots off, KD can just elevate from anywhere on the court but also had the speed and handles to blow past guys."
"KD consulted Obama at private White House meeting about free agency, Obama called it [“too much”](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/barack-obama-told-kevin-durant-joining-warriors-would-be-too-much)"
"He does, because offense is more valuable than defense. But without the Rockets defensive scheme, they aren't anywhere near as competitive with the Warriors. They were frequently holding a team with Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson to under 100 poobts."
Steph Curry   Klay Thompson   LeBron James   Kevin Durant   Anthony Davis    S     P   A  C  I  N  G
One last one because I think it is probably the best example:  Kevin Durant (32/7/6) and Russell Westbrook (22/6/7) vs an aging Tony Parker/Tim Duncan and the 2014 Spurs.

And Kevin Durant.
"I'm curious as to why people think Kawhi and PG have a chance to win the championship next year? Correct me if wrong, but shouldn't have we have a full fit Kevin Durant and Kyrie irving back next season with the Brooklyn Nets? And won't GSW have a fully fit Steph Curry and Klay Thompson returning?   I'm honestly struggling to see how Kawhi and PG with the Clippers will even have a chance if all four of those players return and perform as good as they are capable of performing.      Apologies if I'm missing something! I'm fairly new to NBA :)"
"It's true but the 16 Spurs had newly acquired Lamarcus Aldridge with Kawhi becoming elite, and were seen as better than OKC while Kevin Durant was just coming off of an injury-riddled season so there was more doubt on their side   What I meant is OKC beating the Spurs doesn't mean they were the better team, the Spurs might have been better against the other 27 teams (not counting the Warriors)"

"&gt; Has tanking worked for anyone?

They did move, and sucked enough to get Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.  So, that worked out on both ends.  Rockets traded away Moses Malone in '82 to tank and got Ralph Samspson and and then Hakeem.    Cleveland tanked for LeBron."
"&gt;i mean kevin wanted to contend yall had nobody lol    He didn't just want to ""cOntEnd""..  He already was in OKC, with another superstar and a lot of good players all around.. OKC was a Top 3 team in the West, and even the entire league. They were also just 1 GAME away from beating the 73-9 Warriors team, and going to the Finals to face LeBron  &gt;  After Durant, Westbrook and OKC choked that 3-1 lead.. Durant just wanted to win free championships. No matter what. He could have gone anywhere else, but he chose the same 73-9 Warriors team that he choked a 3-1 lead against..  Formed the super team of all super teams, 4 all stars/superstars in the same lineup.   &gt;   Don't get me wrong, healthy Durant is still Top 2-3 in the entire league. He has been the only other consistently great one for almost a decade, other than the same ol LeBron obviously.   &gt;  But when Durant left OKC in 2016, he didn't just want to CONTEND. He was  always contending, and already had one of the best teams in the league. He just wanted to take the *hardest road*, and win rings.  He did that, and both Finals MVPs  &gt;  It's only later on that he realized, how empty those rings are.. even though he was GSW's best player undoubtedly, especially in the playoffs, and those Finals.   &gt;  That's why he still never felt what he wanted to feel.. That feeling of the greatest accomplishment.  The satisfaction. None of that  &gt;   Hope he returns back healthy enough to find that feeling.. with the Nets. I might not like the man, that much.. but can't deny how insane he is on the court. Really fun to watch as well.. NBA needs Kevin Durant healthy"
"Kevin Durant ""can't win with those cats"""
"It took the Clippers going down for most of the media to finally give the Lakers the advantage.   But that’s my point. The entire season, they had to deal with all that bullshit. And I’m sure it was tough on them mentally. I mean even Kevin Durant didn’t have that mental toughness to ignore his critics, and he’s a top 2 player at the time."
more like said the person who thought Kevin Durant was white
Kevin Durant
&gt; Warriors pretty much laid down the blueprint on how to defend LeBron  Blueprint = adding Kevin Durant to a 73-win team.
I think people would talk about Kevin Durant like Harden if he didn't go to GSW (and also didn't win with OKC)
Dwyane Wade: 22 W - 10 L  Kevin Durant: 21 W - 7 L  Stephen Curry: 19 W - 4 L  Dirk Nowitzki: 13 W - 14 L

Kevin Durant or Alex Ovechkin?
"Except that this era of the NBA has everything recorded on the internet, and one of the first things a search for Kevin Durant would bring up would certainly have that context. That, and Wikipedia is a thing."
That 73-9 team didn't have Kevin fuckin Durant.  Also Cavs didn't have Kyrie to offload the help in 2018. Dont act like it was only Bron who lead the Cavs back down in 2016. Kyrie was huge that series
Kevin Durant ?
Kevin Durant is up there too
"I agree 100% with everything you said. To add on, I think you can make just as convincing an argument that the Celtics window is closing as you can that they’ll be good for years when you factor in how the East will change.   In 2021 alone you have...Toronto as the best or 2nd best run organization in the conference. Giannis and the Bucks should  be going all out for the title, KD and Kyrie coming out party, the Sixers can’t possibly be as bad as it went this year, Miami is self-explanatory. Tatum and Brown will likely get better, yes, but all of a sudden it goes from “we have to beat Kyle Lowry &amp; Pascal Siakam or Jimmy Butler and Bam” to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Giannis and perhaps Chris Paul if the Bucks do as I expect them to do and bring him in."
Kemba is not a superstar. If you didn’t wrong IT maybe you could get guys like AD or Kevin Durant and be real contenders
"Pre championship warriors had the same issue. So I say get a new coach, get a lucky season were all the good pg go down, facr LeBron with two of his team mates injured, and then sign Kevin Durant."
Jimmy carried the heat to the finals like kevin durant did the warriors. Chill.
You think Kevin Durant doesn’t believe he’s the best player in the world? How about Kobe? Every superstar plays with that mindset
"Damn, can’t believe a scrub like Lebron lost to the 73-9 team that added MVP and multi scoring champ Kevin Durant to their already championship calibre team."
"Kevin Durant wanted the accolades, but not the hard work.  If Ben Simmons develops a passable jumper, the league is fucked.  If Lonzo-Zion pairing gels really well, the league is fucked.  Klay Thompson is just another 3-and-D wing on a non-warriors/LeBron team.  Luka-KP pairing has the potential to last for years on end.  Giannis is the next James Harden.  Rajon Rondo &gt; Chris Paul"
"&gt; It's not like they're dropping to 20 games where EVERY game matters. It's still 60.  &gt;We'd be trying to bring in the full casual. Telling them ""there's only 60 games instead of 82!!"" sounds exactly the same. If baseball dropped down to 130 games would you watch more? 100? I still wouldn't care.  To the contrary, I do watch baseball but it's not feasible to watch every game. If there were far less games, I'd want to watch them all and I'd probably watch more. You could also charge more for tickets, and big games would get way more viewership on TV.   With a more balanced schedule, there'd be way more big-ticket matchups. As it is now, it feels like half of every big regular-season game has a star player resting or a team coming off the end of a back to back or something else. In the last decade, teams like the Spurs have shown time and time again that resting in the regular season is a pretty good strategy, even if it backfires at times. In the playoffs, players frequently get injured after a long season. By the time a team reaches the finals, it has a very high risk of key (marketable) players getting injured or just being tired. In the past 6 years, you've got Steph, Durant, Kyrie, Kevin Love, and Klay Thompson all injured at some point either in the finals or leading up to it, which significantly affected the finals' outcome. If you believe LeBron really broke his hand in game 1 2018, then throw him in there too. Those are some big names. That's money being lost.  &gt;The reduced injuries could be true, I don't know.  [Fewer away back-to-back games alone would reduce injuries.] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27622705/) [Less travelling would help too.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162549/) Right now, Western Conference teams have a significant disadvantage in that respect because they travel way more and for longer distances. Reducing the schedule to 60 games would get rid of that, ditch back-to-backs and mean more comfortable travel schedules. All this would contribute to longer playing careers, with a corresponding increase in a players' prime. That means more jersey sales, more competition for tickets, more ad revenue, etc. etc. etc. I think there's no question that reducing the season's length would increase revenue (and make for a better sport)--the question, to me, seems to be one of finding the sweet spot that perfectly balances revenue and player health.  I also don't see it happening in the foreseeable future, but because I don't believe you can trust billionaires to reduce work hours, even if it would benefit them economically."
flopper makes one good play and he thinks hes kevin durant lmFAO
Title caliber teams don't allow non-scorers to put up Kevin Durant numbers on them  Which is why Boston will be going home tonight
Bam averages nowhere near 30  Title caliber teams don't allow non-scorers to put up Kevin Durant numbers on them...which is part of why y'all will be going home tonight
31% shooting is a bad game for a one dimensional scorer. Not an all-around player like CP who does everything.  If he was Carmelo Anthony or even someone better like Kevin Durant then that would be a bad game.  Not when you get 17 assists and 4 steals to go with it.
"You started out talking about how the Celtics wanted more switchable defenders and they added kemba who is absolutely not that. The Raptors shipped out someone who had fit well with the team as part of a package to add a superstar. The warriors having one star is a crock of bullshit; before Kevin durant made it to the team they had multiple all-stars and won a championship without him, and then adding KD was absolutely a talent adding move."
!RemindMe 10 Months   KD will easily win the MVP next season.  1) He’s Kevin Durant.   2) Narrative   3) Weak East  4) On a great team
"harden averaged more points (11 more), assists, rebounds, blocks, steals on higher TS, FG, 3p%, and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry last year. he just didn’t have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up"
- Magic Johnson is the 2nd best player ever after Jordan  - Tim Duncan is a top 5 player all time  - Kevin Durant is the most talented player ever physically   - LeBron James legacy would have been better if he had stayed *in Miami* for the rest of his career   - Luka Doncic is going to be considered the best ever by Gen. Z and Gen. Alpha
"His resume will definitely be boosted, but I wouldn't change my opinion about him otherwise. If he took the Pelicans to the title, yeah. It's not a snake move on the level of Kevin Durant, but it's still at least a bit similar to how my opinion of Kevin Durant is unrelated to his Warriors championships, they helped his resume obviously but didn't gain him anything  reputation wise to me. Might as well have not happened."
"He's one of Lebron's kids, in that he clearly grew up idolizing Lebron and patterned his game after him. Lebron's kids tend to be super-gifted athletes with circus-freak jump shots, Giannis, Ben Simmons, Zion etc.  Kobe's kids tend to be incredible ballhandlers and scorers who have no loyalty and do poorly with the media, i.e. James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant.  Vince Carter's kids are basically all Canadians. It actually doesn't even matter whether they're black or white, just the Canadian kids in the NBA. Andrew Wiggins, Kelly Olynyk, Rudy Gay, Anthony Bennett (who isn't in the NBA anymore of course) etc."
"Were obviously stating a hypothical and durant at the same as lbj couldnt drag that 2007 team to the finals.   2012- Kd has been inconsistent against elite defences I find it for KD to win with no bosh and wade draining his knees vefore every game.  2013-Yes im serious , Kd cant be the rim protector/anchor the same Bron was . Hibbert and west is too much vs this heat team with KD. Indiana wouldve troubled the heat more with kd instead of Bron.  2018-Bron dragged a team with an injured Kevin love avging 12 ppg on like 40% shooting as his 2nd best player to the finals lol.   Bron was clearly better that year."
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Kobe Bryant 6. Shaquille O’Neal 7. Larry Bird 8. Wilt Chamberlain 9. Tim Duncan 10. Bill Russell 11. Hakeem Olajuwon 12. Julius Erving 13. Oscar Robertson 14. Jerry West 15. Kevin Durant
"Barnes could have been the Finals MVP and they would have tried to continue their multiple year-long plan to sign KD, what the hell are people talking about here lol. There was nothing Barnes could do in that Finals series to prove he was better than KD, because he wasn't.  I get that the Lakers just won so the LeBron fans are heavy on r/nba as they should be, but it's Kevin Durant. Every team wanted him and it had nothing to do with LeBron. Did you notice how the Warriors got him and became the best team of all-time? What does that have to do with LeBron? Are people still pretending like the Warriors had no plans to get KD until they lost that series? As if getting KD didn't require years of salary cap and team planning?"
Kuzma if focused is not containing kevin Durant
Ignoring pain is how you become Derrick Rose injured  or how kevin durant got hurt
"&gt; Points - 7312 (2nd: Michael Jordan, 5987, 2nd Active: Kevin Durant, 4043)  KD could score 40 for 81 straight playoff games and not pass LeBron's current mark."
"&gt;Points - 7312 (2nd: Michael Jordan, 5987, 2nd Active: Kevin Durant, 4043)  KD could score 40 for 81 straight playoff games and not pass LeBron's current mark."
Kevin Durant just said that this would be the most respected title in NBA history
"Yeah I forgot that the Showtime Lakers, 90's Pistons, and Bird Celtics went 73-9 and then added Kevin Durant to their team the next season.  Lmfao"
"&gt; and he is a long way from being an all star   That's fuckin horseshit..  Maybe a long road from being a superstar, but not an All Star.   &gt;  Murray is not a superstar either. He's not even an All Star, literally speaking. No one was talking about Jamal Murray up until this playoffs started in the bubble.  He just performed like a superstar, out of nowhere. It could very well be a *one bubble and done* thing.   &gt;  What MPJ has.. is a rare gift that can't be taught. He has all the genetical tools, and he already got one of the smoothest jumpshot in the game. He's also athletic enough at 6'10 height.. to blow by anyone and finish hard. Even dunk on people.    The 3 position has always been the most vital position for any NBA team, especially in modern basketball. But it's rare to find someone with ""game changer"" potential in that position.   &gt;  MPJ just SCREAMS Kevin Durant-Lite. And the dude is still a rookie, who's not even used as the 1st or 2nd option in the team yet..   &gt;   Everything else you mentioned, that's not a ""weakness"".. But extremely expected from a rookie. He needs the experience. His ball handling and decision making will get better. He just needs the opportunity, and that green light  &gt;  MPJ also got the sheer confidence, and doesn't even mind pulling up on someone like LeBron.. of all people. That shit takes balls, especially for a Rookie.     Everything about him reminds me of rookie year Kevin Durant, but Durant was the 1st scoring option of the team right away. So he got the chance to bloom, and showcase his potential  &gt;  So uh.. MPJ has every right to demand a trade if the Nuggets don't take advantage of his unreal potential. Jokic is great, and Murray is really good as well (hopefully he can keep it up).. but MPJ has ACTUAL superstar ""Number 1 option"" potential.   &gt;  You can't teach 6'10, with that athleticism, perfect shooting stroke, and such a great overall triple threat skill set.. already. HE IS STILL A ROOKIE.. Don't forget that part"
Yes. KD is the best player in the league. Achilles injury means nothing to Kevin Durant.  !RemindMe 8 Months
"Depends on the narrative, imo. I appreciate them as long as their not toxic (e,g, ""[Oklahoma Newspaper Front Page Calls Kevin Durant 'Mr. Unreliable'](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2047879-oklahoma-newspaper-front-page-calls-kevin-durant-mr-unreliable)"")"
Kevin Durant and Klay predicted those two would be in the finals
"That’s different though. The number of times OKC managed to fck it up or were hit with misfortunes is an astonishing amount.   After the 2012 Finals, the Thunder had very little depth and had to re-sign Ibaka that left them with very little cap space, leaving them with no choice but to trade James Harden to Houston in which looked like a good move at first. He’s now one of the most lethal scorers in this generation.  In 2013, after getting the #1 seed in the West after winning 60 games(!), Westbrook injured his knee in the First Round and the Thunder got bounced by Memphis in just 5 games in the 2nd Round.  In 2014, Ibaka missed the first 2 games of the WCF series against San Antonio that they were already down 0-2 by the time Ibaka came back. They lost the series in 6.   In 2015, Kevin Durant was hit with a series of massive long-term injuries that had him play only 27 games in the season. Despite Westbrook putting up MVP-level numbers, OKC missed the playoffs in its entirety.  In 2016, OKC won 55 games, eased past Dallas in 5 games and beat the winningest Spurs team (67 wins in the season) in history in 6 games. They held a 3-1 lead against the winningest team in history, the 73-win Warriors, but they blew it with a series of historic performances from Golden State and choke jobs from Durant &amp; Westbrook. Durant joined Golden State in that same offseason.  You can’t make this stuff up. No team will be able to fck things up worse than OKC did, and that’s a fact."
"They are going to be problems. Something that isn't discussed enough is how deep runs in the playoff affect the growth of a player's development which is especially true for star players. The exposure to the highest level of basketball in the world and the confidence gained all add to the elevation of one's game.  With that being said, while obviously I'm very impressed with Murray and Jokic, I got my eye on MPJ. Now that kid is going to be a straight up fucking monster soon. People forget that this kid is essentially a rookie with not even a full season under his belt. I'm literally seeing possibly the second coming of Kevin Durant with this kid. If he makes a leap next year, the Nuggets will be true contenders."
"""If you can't beat them, join them"", Kevin Durant, 2016."
Lebron can do everything on the court at an elite level  Kevin durant can do almost everything on the court at an elite level but can't run an offense  Kawhi can do almost everything on the court at an elite level but can't run an offense  Steph can do everything on offense but isn't an elite defender
Ask Kevin Durant.
"While I still think the West was strong this year, the Warriors weren't even really there, and Kevin Durant just went to the Eastern Conference"
Nothing to be ashamed of for Denver Nuggets  They actually overavhieved.   Jokic will still improve as he is still 25 or 26  Murray is only 23 yrs old. He is not even at his prime. And this is what he can do.   MPJ is rookie and 22 yrs old. He may be a poor mans version of Kevin Durant   Bol Bol is developing as a 20 yrs old. I think he will be a good if not a great player also.  I think they will not be seperated anyway anytime soon.   Denver will be a team to be a title favorite in the future I think.   Maybe right drafting and signing and releasing in free agency will be a key alsom
&gt;  one successful playoff run with him as the main star   Have you been living under a rock? He had one of the greatest playoff stretches ever from 2016-2019. He averaged 38.4 points per-100 possessions on 62.8% TS over 46 games. Those are near Kevin Durant in Golden State numbers without remotely as close to as good of a team.

As for Lakers, they proved that experienced matter and a huge part.  Rondo,Lebron,Howard, Mcgee Championship and playoff experience is too much for Denver.  Maybe it would be Lakers Vs Heat in the Finals."
I did not say that. Which round of the playoffs is Kevin Durant in right now again? Remind me.

What good wing has he has to defend all playoffs though? I won’t question his defense but let’s not act like he’s defending Kevin Durant every series
"Wtf top 20 all time , kevin Durant is like at #16, and is one of the best scorers of all time . Top 100 of all time seems more reasonable"
Here is the number of times each guy has led the finals in  game score:  |Player|Count| :--|--:| |Lebron James|6| |Michael Jordan|5| |Shaquille O'Neal|4| |Dwyane Wade|2| |Hakeem Olajuwon|2| |Tim Duncan|2| |Kobe Bryant|2| |Larry Bird|2| |Magic Johnson|2| |Kevin Durant|1| |Chauncey Billups|1| |Jimmy Butler|1| |Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|1| |Clyde Drexler|1| |Shawn Kemp|1| |Tony Parker|1| |Joe Dumars|1| |Ray Allen|1| |Kawhi Leonard|1|
"Steph , teams were letting KEVIN DURANT get open shots to keep Steph from getting a sniff of the ball."
best TEAM ever but i think the kevin durant iterations were more talented
"Nope, Kawhi was better in 2019. Didnt have a 2 time mvp next to him hitting jumpers over a 5'11 point guard screaming ""I'm kevin durant!!"""
"Nuggets played him 12 games in and out of the lineup didn’t give him a fair shake for shit.  As you can see, the wizards actually utilized him and he got into a groove.  Like I said, go back and watch the games, he gets buckets. Philly would be the best case scenario for him.  Edit: also, throwing out his Celtics TS% is a horrible bar to set, that was an all time great efficient season. Up there with Jordan/Harden/Kevin Durant."
"I'm assuming you're talking about different series, be wise Harrison Barnes and Kevin Durant have never played on the same team at the same time"
"This is the top 10 according to alot of people the top 7 is pretty much unchangeable , over who would you take Jimmy? 1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Durant 3. Kawhi Leonard  4. Stephen Curry 5. Anthony Davis  6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Damian Lillard 9. Luka Doncic 10. Nikola Jokic"
"I absolutely love draymond, he's one of my top favourite players in the league  But yeah, the way some people talk about him on here, you'd think he was a barely competent player who shouldn't be anywhere near the league lol  ""Lmao TRIPLE SINGLE""   Like. Yeah, first and foremost he was never the type to put up a lot of points. Second of all, the team around him this year was BAD, even if he did put up 30 points a game that wouldn't really have helped. And also, like, the team was TANKING  He's the only player in history to have a triple double without points, which I think is really cool. He's the ultimate glue guy who does basically everything for the team, and has some of the highest bbiq I've ever seen. Plus like, you don't won dpoy unless you're good at something lmao  Yes, he's probably not the best fit for every team, and having players like Steph Curry and Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson on the court with you will help make anyone look better lol. But there's a reason he's considered the heart and the leader of the team as much as Curry is.  I do agree, some of his on court antics can be a little much. And he has declined slightly the last couple years too. But yes, off the court he's fantastic. I doubt he's going to disappear after retirement, just the fact he's been on Inside as much as he has means he's probably prepping for some sort of media role. Which I'm super excited for, I love him as an analyst and can't wait to see him develop more in that regard."
"Yeah the one where they couldn't beat him, so they needed to get Kevin Durant. Im familiar"
jimmy: i wasnt the one riding on kevin durant and steph curry's coattails
spurs werent going to beat gsw regardless. That was a 73 win team + kevin durant. GSW swept the entire western conference and only went on to lose 1 game to lebron.  We've seen lakers lost game 1s twice this year only to win the next 4. 1 half of a game doesnt mean jack shit
"""Why tho?""  A few reasons.   Just looking at scoring stats, we have  Usage rate: since age 25, Harden's usage rate has sat a tad above 35%, while Durant's has been almost 30%. They've each played exactly 6 seasons in this time.  Teammates: Every single one of these years, Durant has had a teammate score more than Harden's highest scoring teammate, thereby taking away points from him  Percentages: Durant has shot more effeciently than Harden, by relatively considerable margins, from the free throw line, mid range, three point, and field, for his entire career  Scoring method: Agree with it, or not, a lot of people consider Kevin Durant to have a broader, stronger arsenal of scoring tools, and many also demerit Harden for what the feel is ""playing the rule book"", as he's lead the league in free throws per game 6 times now, while Durant hasn't even cracked the top 7 in six years. Earlier in his career, when he was at or near the top of FTPG, his free throws weren't regarded as negatively.   And for the defensive side of things, Durant has always been better. While Harden has got to the point of ""good"" in the past two years, Durant was nearly at DPOY levels for his warriors years, and great before that, while Harden's defense was looked upon as poor and lazy"
Man he was out for one game lol. We gonna ignore those other 2 games where he was IN and they still lost? Of course he'd be wouldn't have lost so many against him as well if he didn't have KEVIN FUCKING DURANT along with his 73-win team.
"Wow the LeBron hate is strong. Yes, he went 1-8 the next two years because of fucking cookies, and not because they added Kevin Durant. Give me a break"
That was both incredibly impressive and incredibly depressing by kevin durant.  That ain't how h.o.r.s.e. is supposed to be played
*Kevin Durant disliked that*
Kevin Durant game 4 in 2018 happened.
Kevin Durant has entered the chat.
I feel like the finals would’ve been ruined last year anyways by virtue of it being the fucking Kevin Durant Warriors
"I think Kevin durant would be the perfect 6th man. You take an elite ""team"" of 5 starters and have KD come off the bench, it would be complete annihilation. First reading this title I thought KD was explaining how he himself would be perfect off the bench. Listened to it and he is talking to cj, which is so disrespectful and dumb. Also the eating is a huge part peeve"
Magic  LeBron  Kevin Durant  Barkley  Peja Stojakovic
"I see where you’re coming from but I don’t really see it that way.  I think KD is trying to feel out CJ’s priorities and see if he’d change them.  In a subtle way, KD is really questioning CJ’s mindset of losing as the #2 guy, than winning as the #3 guy.    If you’re Kevin Durant, you HAVE to win championships.  Else you’ll be labeled a bust, and a guy who just couldn’t get it done.  CJ doesn’t have that kind of pressure on him.  No one in high school thought CJ would play in college, much less the pros, much less be a NBA starter on a playoff team.   CJ has succeeded the worlds expectations by a mile, which is why CJ is content to play his game.  No one expects CJ to be a multiple time NBA Champion, like they do Kevin.  Meanwhile, KD can’t fathom the mindset of *not* wanting to join a championship team.  To him he sees that as the ultimate goal.  The ultimate validation of his abilities as a player.  And he wouldn’t, really can’t, understand why you wouldn’t take a back seat to achieve that.    He even stressed same minutes, more shots, close out games to see if CJ would change his tone.  But CJ really can’t.  To him, his validation comes from having earned that starting spot.  And he’d rather have that validation of being the #2 guy on a playoff team, than the 3rd option/6th man role   Two different people.  Two different expectations.  Two different egos."

"KD's example didn't make too much sense. 2016 Cavs, but they get Jimmy Butler instead of JR Smith, and they get CJ McCollum. Then he says he would come off the bench on that team, lol.   Just imagine  Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Lebron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, and Kevin Durant off the bench. Dude loves the easy championships."
"Did you read my points though? The Wolves may have only won 40 games but they outscored opponents by 2.6 PPG, with that differential they would have been the #4 seed in the East and the #7 in the West, they had a better point differential than Memphis, Dallas and Phoenix (the 7, 8 and 9 seeds). Minnesota had some horrible game winners come against them that year. Four of their losses came on last second shots.   It's not like he was KAT or Devin Booker putting up 25+ ppg for a 20 win team. He was putting up great numbers and his team was in the playoff race. The West was just stacked that year (a 48 win Phoenix team missed the playoffs), his teammates were atrocious and/or injured.   That year Love finished 3rd in WS, 4th in WS/48, 2nd in Box Plus Minus, and 2nd in Value over replacement. Those advanced stats are comparable to Kevin Durant's 2016 numbers, Dirk's 2003 or 2005 numbers and even better than Anthony Davis' numbers the last 3 years.   I get advanced stats aren't the be all end all and at some point team success has to come into play, but outside of just upgrading his teammates there was very little Kevin Love could have done to get his team more wins. His 0.245 WS/48 was behind only Kevin Durant (MVP), Chris Paul and LeBron James. He had a higher BPM than Miami LeBron.   When he was on the court his team outscored opponents by 5.6 PPG (good for the 4th seed in the West behind Champion Spurs, Lob City Clippers and KD/WB Thunder). When he was on the bench, the Wolves were outscored by 5.3 PPG. Good for 13th place in the West, just ahead of the tanking Utah Jazz and the Chris Kaman/Kendall Marshall LA Lakers."
"What are you talking about? How is 73 wins not reality? Listen, Kevin Durant is an all time great and had one of the greatest finals ever. That can be true *and* it can also be true that he went to a team that literally won the title without him and had the greatest regular season of all time. Don’t get mad at me, that’s literally what happened."
"Pride only hurts, it never helps. You fight through that shit. Cause a year from now, when you’re kicking it in the Caribbean, you’re going to say to yourself “Kevin Durant was right”."
"My point is that they all started the season on the same playing field and worked within the season on what they are now. No one is a clear favorite, just some teams more favored than the others.   Very different to the parity complaints that we had when the 73-9 warriors had their worst starter replaced with the best possible player in that position, fucking Kevin Durant."
MVP voting was a lot of narrative though and not necessarily who is the best player in the league. I would argue the best way to get a lot of MVP votes is to be on a really good team (to rack up a lot of wins) but the second star is pretty clearly at least a tier below the main one whether it be because of skill or they are out of their prime. Like Kareem won his when Oscar was old with him and/or Magic was really young with him. Curry is clearly above Klay and Draymond Green and Kevin Durant is clearly above Ibaka and Westbrook but when they played together nether won MVP despite both of them still being in their primes. Stockton and Malone were both really freaking good and in the same tier so they didn't get the narrative they were carrying their team. Also it is why I predict Luka will win an MVP in the upcoming years because he is really good on a really solid team (with excellent bench and coach) and he is clearly at least a tier about Porzingis.

"Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.   Them signing with the Nets was a blessing in disguise. Watching Julius Randle and Bobby Portis get the Garden rocking has been incredible, next year they’ll be strong contenders for the 10th seed"
"Did Toronto last year? Or the Heat in early 2010s?   Either you have steph curry, klay thompson and then kevin durant, or you dont and have to play basketball as always."

"Dude, I can't tell if you're messing with me.   It's a ridiculous and arbitrary 'comparison-type' argument that I think is a lazy and low-quality answer to the question. I realize that this is reddit, but I just expect the top-voted response to be something a little bit more substantive and thought provoking than ""No b/c Westbrook isn't and he's MVP"".     Westbrook's ability to win a title has literally nothing to do with Lavine's ability to be the first option on a contender. Clearly, the answer to the OP's question is still most likely no, but I'm seriously struggling to understand how/why Russell Westbrook of the Houston Rockets has *anything* to do with it at all.   Is the argument that Westbrook and Lavine are similar players, so therefore Lavine *simply cannot* achieve more playoff success than Westbrook? Do we need to be reminded that Lavine and Westbrook are not even remotely similar players outside of their shared trait of athleticism?  Instead of phrasing it as ""Russell is an MVP"", please reconsider it this way. Russell was a 2x regular season MVP who isn't a good or consistent enough scorer to be the first option on a deep-run playoff team, let alone a championship team. The Thunder WERE a championship-caliber team while Kevin Durant was around, but have had absolutely no playoff success with Russ at the helm.    Zach Lavine hasn't had the chance to play on a good NBA team, has a totally different skillset from Russ, and is coming off the best season in his career so far, despite being coached by Egghead Boylen. These reasons + Zach Lavine's offensive capabilities are why the answer to OP's question doesn't have to definitively be ""NO"", and DEFINITELY is not ""NO, CUZ WESTBROOK NOT AND HE MVP""."

"Westbrook, the same player that took the ball out of KEVIN DURANT's hands to jack up bricks was the perfect complement to KD? Nah fam, Westbrook was good, but his decision making hindered them during their time in OKC. I can think of plenty better complements to Durant than Westbrook, Steph, for one."
Russ was the one guy he praised on that [burner twitter account](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2017/9/19/16335582/kevin-durant-confession-tweets). It was the rest of the organization/team/coach that he burned

"Right, but not because of finals appearances. That's not what makes Stockton better.  You don't think Dame would get to the finals if Kevin Durant was his teammate his entire career? What does that really prove?"
"I love KD as a player. I have fond memories of watching all of his televised college games over the phone with my Dad. He's an incredible talent, works hard and is a winner.  But God damn. Kevin Durant is a bitch."
you know who else was a legitimate top 3 player? kevin durant
&gt;19. Kevin Durant  &gt;21. Stephen Curry  &gt;47. Kawhi Leonard  These are all too low.  Great top 10 though.
Kyrie Irving  Caris LeVert   Joe Harris  Kevin Durant  Jarrett Allen
2016 Stephen Curry  1992 Michael Jordan  2018 Kevin Durant  2004 Kevin Garnett  1994 Hakeem Olajuwon
35 year old LeBron is not better than 2019 Durant. Diminishing his accomplishments because he had spacing yet not bringing up AD for Bron is disingenuous.   He dominated last year on an incredible level of difficult shots.   It’s crazy how Kevin Durant is the ONLY PLAYER IN HISTORY who gets discredited for having good teammates. Imagine me saying “well Magic did have Kareem now.”
“Fuccck Kevin Durant!”  Lil B
"&gt;Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Pascal Siakam, Kyrie Irving, Trae Young, Paul George, Kristaps Porzingis  Who **the fuck** is taking these dude’s over Tatum?  KD’s too big of a question Mark.  Everyone else? Probably"
"I’d say it’s more of a forwards game today: Giannis, Kawhi, LeBron, Kevin Durant, etc."
"I’m saying Nique is a player that relied on his athleticism to score, and then evolved into a shooter post injury. KD has always been a shooter. He’s never been a athletic freak that requires explosiveness or agility to play their game.  KD will be in the East and have a 40/50/90 season avg 30+ a game. I don’t think the injury will have much effect on him at all. And i honestly don’t think Kevin Durant would come back if he couldn’t be “Kevin Durant.” His ego wouldn’t let him play the game at a lower level"
&gt;The GSW replaced Kevin Durant with fucking Andrew Wiggins and people still think they are contenders.   Yes because won without KD.  &gt;You can save this and come back after next season nd if I'm wrong ill admit it but this GSW is not a top 4 team in the west and will not make it past the 2nd round unless they get some insane trade.  !RemindMe 1 year
"They were a unfair super team when they had 2 top 5 players and the best 3rd option in the league with a great bench. Now that they lost a top 5 player, have aged 5 years + a ton of tear on the body from all the finals + Klays injury. The GSW replaced Kevin Durant with fucking Andrew Wiggins and people still think they are contenders. This team is not the same team 4 years ago.  You can save this and come back after next season nd if I'm wrong ill admit it but this GSW is not a top 4 team in the west and will not make it past the 2nd round unless they get some insane trade."

"\&gt; I'm telling you that LeBron's individual defense was bad   I'm telling you I disagree. Imo, LeBron's defensive 'effort' was fine, Warriors are just an offensive juggernaut. Lebron Played a guy like KD well numerous times but he scored anyway because he's Kevin Durant.   Have you forgotten how this discussion started? I asserted that LeBron was not dominated by KD and brought up their statistics for comparison. Then you said that LeBron was terrible defensively that series compared to KD. Why are you so mad that I'm trying to add context to the comparison? Like I said before, defense is mainly a team game so of fucking course teammates matter.   &gt; Seriously LeBron is the only superstar I've ever seen have so many excuses drawn up for his flaws.   Jeez, I wonder if you have any bias... I'm sure that's why you just had to bring up the goat conversation earlier, right? People like you were the same ones who swore up and down last year that LeBron was washed and a defensive liability."
"Did I say most of his shots were open? No, but as someone who watched him since OKC he most definitely had an easier time playing with the two greatest shooters of all time. Look at the difference in his ts% with Steph Curry on and off the court, difference is massive. He’s still kevin freaking durant but at the same time if you watched those games especially in the playoffs steph made it so much easier on him."
The odds were against him during his losses to the Warriors. Which is a team that had 2 of the 3 best NBA players of the last decade (arguably) in Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. With 2 all-nba players to back them up in Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.
You think so? Imagine kevin durant joining a 73 win team the year before.
Take the best ever regular season team and add arguably the greatest scorer since Michael Jordan in Kevin Durant... and people still hate on LeBron for his finals record. It's a miracle he got 1 off GSW
Whatever happened to Kevin Durant?
"It's the narrative because it is true, when he has lost (not always, he absolutely blew the finals against the Mavs) he has lost because his team is worse (""bad"" relative to his competition). I mean honestly, he had to play the 3 greatest shooters of all time on the same team three years in a row because of a weird cap spike and Kevin Durant being a bitch. The man has been insanely unlucky lol"
"Some of you lot act like just new born babies..   &gt;  Kevin Durant still exist.. That's the only Top Tier one. There's others who are lower tier players, but really good at the midrange.    &gt;  Durant been in the league since he was 19, doing his thang.. Especially when it comes to scoring, and ESPECIALLY the midrange. No one can even contest that, and he does it off the dribble. Hesi Pull Up jimbo  &gt;   You really should know better  &gt;  **edit**: I'll say this though.. AD's triple threat mid pull up game is quite insane. It got even better and consistent. Especially since he's like 6'11 with long ass wingspan, who can also blow by anyone and finish strong.. on anyone.   So defenders can't really do anything. And they already got their hands full with  LeBron.  So it's just a.. 'Pick ya poison' type thing"
"Still top 7. I don't take super hot, unsustainable shooting streaks into consideration when ranking players. He might be 6th best depending on how Kevin Durant comes back."

Kevin Durant? Lebron? Boston KG? Kobe?
"Whose first ring has more clout, Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant?"
By fans? Kevin Durant and Damian Lillard said he is the BEST defender in the league
Steph Curry is better than even a full strength Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis isn't better than Kawhi Leonard or maybe even James Harden
Steph Curry is better than Kevin Durant  Jimmy Butler in the top five is also a joke. He's a great player but he wasn't even Miami's best player in the ECF.
"My man Kobe went to 7 finals from the WEST. Your princess went to 9 from the EAST, while constantly playing for either the best (by far) or close second best team in the east. When Shaq left, Lakers were hardly the best western team. Celebrating getting to the finals from the east before getting killed 6 times is pathetic loser mentality. Name **one superstar in their prime** your boy had to go through to get to those finals from the east please. At least one. Name any relevant team whatsoever. Except DWade, but of course, he **joined** DWade to remove that problem out of the equation. **One** name. I'll wait. Thing is, you don't have one. And you won't answer this.  My man Kobe never joined a superteam to chase rings, your princess did. Then announced 8 rings (video online). He barely got 2, and it would have been 1 had Ray Allen not hit a buzzer-beater corner three to save his sorry ass. He got destroyed by Dallas while melting on stage, and got swept by San Antonio. Then ran away from Miami back to Cleveland. Weak.     My man Kobe played his whole career for one team only. When Lakers were about to sign Chris Paul, league said no. Ever wondered why? Lebron, DWade and Bosh were fair game. Curry, Klay and Durant were fair game. Kobe and CP3 were too strong to let it happen. Comparison. Facts.     How many rings would Kobe have if he decided to join the best team in the league after Shaq left? Kobe stayed and played with what he had. For years. Kwame Brown and alike. Because joining the best is for the weak. That's your princess' style.     All my boy Kobe needed to get to 3 straight finals without Shaq was a 12PPG 8REB Pau Gasol to join Lakers from Memphis. That's not a DWade, Bosh, Kevin Love, Kyrie superstar. He didn't have that since Shaq left. He didn't need that. That's what your princess needs. 2 allstars at all times.     In the end, Shaq without Kobe did nothing. Before or after. Got 1 ring as a present from DWade, while averaging 12PPG. Kobe without Shaq is 3 finals, 2 rings, best player in the league. Facts. So who exactly needed who?     When all is said and done, clinging to stats is hilarious for a guy who spent most of his career chasing rings.     As far as Kobe getting carried by Shaq false narrative goes, there's a video for every single ape out there believing it.     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTb-tOmJ9UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTb-tOmJ9UI)     What happened here was school. I ain't gonna repeat myself."

For comparisons sake Kyrie Irving is 1/3 for 33%, Steph Curry is 2/9 for 22%, Kevin Durant is 2/13 for 15%, Damien Lillard is 4/8 for 50%, and MJ is 7/15 for 47%.

"Good luck with this trash fire nash  Edit: if kyrie gets in his head, KD Will never when a  ring without the help of one of the greatest teams of all time. Cause the last thing Kevin “burner Twitter” Durant needs is someone telling him “you be the head coach”"
Kevin Durant last year. Cavs injuries 2015. Chris Paul with the Rockets. Plenty of recent examples.
"I think you're getting Kyrie wrong.  He said this is the first time he can _look down_ at a teammate and defer. When he deferred to LeBron he was looking _up_. The person he's shitting on here is Kevin Durant, his teammate, with a backhanded compliment."

"uhh, the celtics didn't face the kevin durant warriors and lose their 2nd best player during the series.  that might have something to do with it.  they took 7 games to beat the hawks in the first round."
"Dude.....What do you possibly gain from lying?  Per NBA.com, Kevin Durant Had the lowest amount of Open shots out of Curry/LeBron/Kyrie in the finals.....  27% of KD’s shots were open, 47% of Curry’s shots were considered open. It was literally one open layup that constantly gets shared due to Curry fanboyism  No need to lie. Ad deserves finals MVP. He singlehandedly erased a 13 point deficit lmao"
Yeah and Kevin Durant is really 6’9
"Dominique Wilkins came back an averaged 30 after this injury. Kevin Durant tore his achillis on his non dominant foot. He also doesn't rely on athleticism he relies on his height, shooting and ability to create shots with that combination. Unless he somehow grows shorter don't start with this dumbass shit."
Yea totally because Rudy Gay and a 36 year old Kobe Bryant are similar to Kevin Durant who had arguably his best season before he got hurt.
I already explained my position. I think Kyrie is talking about players who can take over a game and create shots. Not just hit open ones. He's talking about KD here and he's not comparing him to Kyle fricking Korver. He's comparing him to LeBron or Tatum or Love.  But you're taking his statement very literally and it doesn't make sense why Kyrie would even mean that. Obviously he's been with players who can hit open shots. That's not the rare or superstar quality he sees in Kevin Durant.
"I'm just using your logic. Just cause he's kobe, he should've came back and been a top 3 player.   &gt; Kevin Durant will be fine and the Nets will probably win the division next year.  impossible to say until we see how good KD is when he returns. No where near a guarantee nets will be better than sixers/celtics/raps"
"Kobe tore his Achilles on his dominate foot, then got injured again pretty much right away. Not the same situation at all. Kevin Durant will be fine and the Nets will probably win the division next year."
"LOL it's seriously pathetic to even attempt to argue that the Lakers had a more difficult run this season.  The only round in which the Lakers faced a tougher opponent was the first round, and even then the Blazers were just mediocre. Houston and Philadelphia were similarly good. Milwaukee was far better than Denver and even without Kevin Durant, the Warriors were far better than Miami."
1) All overrated defense team   Delon Wright   Klay Thompson   Torrey Craig  Jaylen Brown   Clint Capela  2) Marcus Smart will be the 2nd best player on the Celtics by next season  3) A much more realistic projection for Kevin Durant next year is top 15 player than top 3-5 player  4) Size is somewhat overblown on defense especially when it comes to on ball defense. Where it matters more is with help defense and how you can make an impact there.   5) The reality on what Ben Simmons is defensively is somewhere in between what the metrics paint him as(which is only a decent defender) and his reputation as this top 5 defender 1st team All NBA defense.
Things we learned from the 2020 NBA Playoffs: -Lebron James can still tear through anything that comes his way in his 17th year -Anthony Davis has proven that he is a top 5 player in the NBA (even higher depending on who u ask) -Giannis needs more help to make a deep championship run in the improving eastern conference -Jimmy Butler proved his critics wrong and showed he is a LEADER and has the Mamba Mentality -The Heat have promising young players along with veteran guys who want to win -Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic have showed that they should be in the conversation for one of the top duos in the NBA -The Rockets have multiple issues including Westbrook’s inability to shoot and small ball not being as effective as they thought it would be -Donavan Mitchel is a volume scorer and is getting increasingly better each time he is in the playoffs -Kawhi Leonard may have made the wrong choice by joining the Clippers with his friend Paul George -TJ Warren can hoop! Oladipo may want out of Indiana coming back from his injury -Boston is only going to get better with their extremely young and talented core... as long as they stay healthy -Ben Simmons and Embiid may not be the answer to “The Process” -The Brooklyn Nets have a bright future with Caris Levert and the arrival of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving -Luka Doncic is an absolute monster who is not afraid to take on anybody. Porzingis may be an unreliable duo for Luka solely based on the fact that he cant stay healthy. -Vucevic is one of the most underrated big men in the league
"Yes and no. The Rockets were great at exploiting Gobert but that doesn’t mean they were his only matchup problem. Gobert is a traditional drop coverage defensive center who scored primarily off the roll or in the dunker’s spot. Basically he’s this decade’s Tyson Chandler. These guys are great during the regular season grind but become situational and occasionally unplayable in many playoff matchups.  Most teams would target Gobert and run him off the floor in the playoffs these days. The exception would be Denver because they’re one of the few teams that needs to keep their drop coverage center out there all game as well. The fact that these two old fashion centers had to be on the floor is a big part why Murray and Spider had all those huge scoring games in that series. The huge difference between Gobert and Jokic is that Denver runs a large part of their offense through Jokic, and he’s able to initiate and score efficiently on volume on his own and for his team. Rudy can’t do that.  Gobert is really good at several facets of the game and incredibly weak at other facets. It makes him a situational player in the playoffs. Which is why folks always get up in arms about him being on the All NBA lists.  Anthony Davis is a completely different animal. Kevin Durant and Giannis are better comparisons for The Brow. 6’10+ big men that can handle the ball, shoot, and run an offense, while also not being a defensive liability."

Ha uh what? The Celtics took the Cavs to 7 in 2018. You don’t think there’s any way adding Kevin Durant might have pushed them over the top? The Game 7 win was that definitive eh?
"Moses Malone, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Karl Malone, Dr. J, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzki, and Steph Curry are my 12-20 guys in no particular order.   We already know the top 11, they’re pretty consensus."
"Jordan LeBron Kareem are top 3.  Magic Bird Russell Wilt are next 4, Duncan and Kobe are arguable in that group.  Duncan, Kobe, Shaq round that out. (Argument can be made for Hakeem, pick one to kick out of the Top 10)  Hakeem, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant are undisputable ""next 10"" in my opinion.  I'd round it out the last 5 with Barkley, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Julius Erving, and Dirk Nowitzki.  Guys competing for Top 20 are Stockton, Baylor, Garnett, Moses Malone, Wade, Pippen, Isaiah Thomas."

"I'll give you 11. And 14 was close but the Vegas odds still had Spurs favored.  But 17? Really? This was the championship Warriors, the team that went 73-9 the year before, that ADDED Kevin Durant without losing anyone. Lmao you're just a hater"
"1. Kobe Bryant 2. Stephen Curry 3. Luka Doncic 4. Kevin Durant 5. Lebron James 6. Shaq 7. Tony Parker 8. Tim Duncan 9. Blake Griffin 10. Damian Lillard  Not sorted by skill, just my personal preference on who I've enjoyed watching the most."
"It's undeniable that the game has evolved through time. Nutrition; athleticism; tactics, they're all better.   But just because you excell in a harder period shouldn't mean you're a greater player. You can only beat what's in front of you and who knows how good Jordan could have been with modern tech and ideas    We're talking about the GREATEST, not the best. Kevin Durant is probably better than Jordan was. Is KD a greater player than MJ? Is Kyrie greater than AI? haha"
"Tell me which finals outside of 2011 he was favored against?  * the 2007 spurs when he dragged a team of nobodies to the finals against a prime spurs? * the 2015 Warriors when he lost his two best teammates and still carried his team to a 6 game series despite Dellevedova as their second best player? * the 2017 and 2018 warriors against a 73-9 warriors team that just added Kevin fucking Durant? And that's even with the 2018 team missing their second best player after Kyrie Irving was traded for the corpse of IT. * the 2014 spurs in which Miami was riddled with injuries? This might've been the only other finals you could say he had a chance of winning, but the spurs were still favored."
Didn't Nick Wright tweet ages ago that Kevin Durant was the best player in basketball?
Wow its almost as if the argument has nuance and you start to realize that cherrypicking stats can mislead arguments and that basketball is a team sport with multiple players...... lebron has been favored to win basically none of his final games and MJ has been favored to them all..... by your argument Danny Green is better than kevin durant.....
Derrick Rose - Chicago Bulls - yes   Kevin Durant - OKC Thunder - no   Kawhi Leonard - Spurs - no   George Mikan - LA Lakers - yes   DeMar DeRozan - Raptors - yes   Carmelo Anthony - Nuggets - yes   Kemba Walker - Hornets - YES
Reggie Lewis was a legit all-star but calling Bias a star without playing a single game in the league is a bit a of stretch. He was a college star but he wasn’t even a 1st team All-American until his senior season.  Looking over the number 2 pick over the last twenty years and not a lot of names stand out as players who could carry a franchise to a chip. Len Bias might have been a Kevin Durant but he might have been a Michael Beasley as well.
"&gt; No they aren’t.  ”Collectively, I feel like we have great pieces,” Irving said, “but it’s pretty glaring we need one more piece or two more pieces that will complement myself, KD [Kevin Durant], DJ [DeAndre Jordan], GT [Garrett Temple], Spence [Dinwiddie], Caris [LeVert], and we’ll see how that evolves.”  You can argue over whether or not he intentionally left certain names off the list, but this is still a player calling for a trade mid-season. That's never a good sign.  &gt;Where? Is this when they asked on the podcast whose taking the last shot?  I was actually talking about Jarret Allen and Caris LeVert.   * Allen started right up until the coach (who backed him) was fired, then he came off the bench * LeVert has struggled in a reduced role for pretty much his entire career  The minutes and shots are already highly politicised.    But on the topic of that podcast, you're putting far too much emphasis into pre-season compliments. It's the pre/off-season, both guys are just greasing each other up and pretending like their new teammate is the most talented they've had (which all NBA players do around this time).  Durant is saying he can finally trust Kyrie, after playing with Steph. Irving is saying he can finally trust Durant, after playing with LeBron.   &gt;Okay?  We've seen how the expectation of drama can create drama. Not just in a general sense, but specifically with players on the Brooklyn team."
"From Zach Lowe's LBJ/MJ article today, really good one for anyone interested  &gt;in 1992, the New York Knicks took arguably the best Jordan team ever to seven games in the second round. The Portland Trail Blazers had the 1992 Finals knotted 2-2 with Game 5 in Portland. New York led the 1993 conference finals over Chicago 2-0. That season's Phoenix Suns, with the MVP in Charles Barkley, gagged away Game 6 in Phoenix -- with Game 7 looming there -- before John Paxson's title-clinching triple. (Jordan scored every Chicago point in that 4th quarter -- all nine -- before Paxson's shot.)  &gt;The Utah Jazz evened the 1997 Finals 2-2, and hosted Game 5 -- the Flu Game -- which the Bulls eked out by two. The 1998 Indiana Pacers had the Bulls on the ropes in Game 7 of the conference finals.  &gt;Those were moments of dire uncertainty against several great teams at their respective apexes. They did not feel uncertain to a lot of contemporary observers (this one included). Jordan was inevitable.  &gt;He was perfect: 6-0 in the Finals, and into retirement -- coaxed by Jerry Reinsdorf's refusal to honor a champion -- before the Bulls could decline. Could Chicago have four-peated in 1999? Other what-ifs dare you to imagine an imperfect Jordan: Would Chicago have lost one (or two) Finals against the mid-1990s Houston Rockets had Jordan not left to play baseball? Do the Bulls manage that second three-peat if Jordan doesn't refresh himself those two years? Some ex-Bulls have cautioned against assuming an uninterrupted run of dominance. (Steve Kerr has called the notion of eight straight titles ""preposterous."") What if Shaquille O'Neal stays in Orlando -- beefing up the East during Chicago's second three-peat?  &gt;What if there is no fluke salary cap spike enabling Kevin Durant to sign with the Golden State Warriors in 2016? The 2016-17 Cavaliers were the best Cleveland team of LeBron's career. How do we look at LeBron's Finals history if those Cavs repeat against the non-Durant Warriors? What happens in 2018? Does Kyrie Irving stay?  &gt;That is alternate history. Truth leaves Jordan perfect, and LeBron now 4-6 in Finals. The sheen of Jordan's perfection glows brighter with time. It overwhelms and distorts the discussion of whether James might surpass him as the greatest player in modern history -- or if he already has.  &gt;Three of LeBron's six losses came against the Warriors -- two to Durant superteams, and a third in which both Irving and Kevin Love were injured.  &gt;Another came in 2007, when James in his fourth season dragged an underwhelming Cleveland team into the Finals against the veteran San Antonio Spurs. It was not a fair fight. Young LeBron underwhelmed: 22 points per game on 35.6% shooting. But he was transcendent advancing to the Finals much earlier in his career than Jordan.  https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30070633/lebron-james-vs-michael-jordan-why-goat-debate-different-now"
&gt;the nets have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.  this is the reason
I thought it was mindless hype before the draft when I read scouting report and comparisons saying James was like Magic Johnson combined with Michael Jordan. Turns out it was actually a pretty accurate description. Another one was Kevin Durant being Tracy McGrady mixed with Dirk Nowitzki.
"Kevin Durant has the most unstoppable shot in all of the NBA. That’s what makes him better in one way. Plus he is the more reliable defender.   But harden is better at passing, drawing fouls, and driving.   The hard part is determining what factors makes one “better” than the other cause it’s subjective.   Scoring and defense is generally what defines  all the great perimeter players."
"Kevin Durant was dropping 30’s against lebron in the 2012 finals as well, wonder what changed"
MJ never got completely dominated by another player like LeBron got dominated by Kevin Durant in those finals
"No better place to be if you want to be ""The Man"" than on a team with *checks notes* Kevin Durant."
Kevin Durant
"To be fair.. The Warriors won the 2015 championship the SAME exact way.  So just maybe.. 2019 was a form of basketball Karma  &gt;  That was also Curry, Klay and Dray's first and only championship without Kevin Durant.. even though LeBron was clear cut still the best player on the floor, despite having fuckin Timothy Mozgov as the 2nd option"
"harden averaged more points (11 more), assists, rebounds, blocks, steals on higher TS, FG, 3p%, and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry last year. he just didn’t have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up"
"there is no world in which curry is better than harden on defense. harden this past postseason played better defense than curry ever has. literally we couldnt go small if not for hardens defensive ability.  and what about when harden averaged more points (11 more), assists, rebounds, blocks, steals on higher TS, FG, 3p%, and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry just last year. he just didn’t have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up"
"[Everyone gives shit to KD for ring chasing, deservedly so, but draymond crying in his car begging KD to join the Warriors was so bad too](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/kevin-durant-draymond-green-game-7-phone-call-recruit-nba-finals-warriors-thunder/amp)"
"Teams win without filling the AD role. Only 2 teams in history have ever won without a primary offensive engine. And there's differences between those guys you have listed as primary offensive engines, and I definitely would take AD over a couple of them, being a primary shouldnt be the only thing we factor.   For example, Damian Lillard is not as good a playmaker as the other you mentioned. He's doesn't have the off ball movement to offset when he gets doubled like Steph. And he's not as good a playmaker and isolation scorer as Harden. Both Curry and Harden's movement/shooting/isolation skill puts so much pressure on defenses.  What Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Lebron James do to an offense right now is unmatched. Kawhi also has the 2 way label along with elite isolation scoring. After those 5, I'm definitely taking Anthony Davis though."
"Can't make shots when it matters most?  2015-2018 in playoff clutch time:  (Clutch is defined as under 5 minutes to go, game within 1-2 possessions)  Stephen Curry - 4.26ppg on 72% TS (27 games)  Lebron James - 3.24ppg on 48% TS (38 games)  Kevin Durant - 2.1ppg on 48.8% TS (20 games)  This is excluding LeBron's worst finals performances (2007, 2011) and including Steph's worst finals performance (2016)."
"&gt;""The Decision"" raised over 6 million dollars for charity so no it was not a flaw.  Lebron could've easily done this without making it a clown show for Cavs fans. Kevin Durant has raised a ton of money for charity too but we don't talk about that. There is a reason why Lebron has handled his ""second and third decision"" far more quietly because he has realized that wasn't the right move. If you're still not convinced then imagine just what type of hatred Durant would've gotten if he publicized his move to Golden State on National TV.    I consider making a Superteam on purpose far worse than joining one but to dismiss that they're not comparable at all is ridiculous. The only reason we don't consider it for Lebron is because he fucking choked and broke against Dallas in 2011."
"Absolutely not. AD is LeBron's best teammate. Their games mesh together better than any other current player could with LeBron. AD led the Lakers in points, rebounds, steals, blocks, free throws, free throws %, offensive win shares, defensive win shares, win shares, and player efficiency rating this season. The only other player that LeBron could have teamed up with that may have won more games is Kevin Durant in my opinion. I still think AD's game meshes with LeBron's game better than Kevin Durant's game with LeBron's game though."
"Big 3s have been a thing since the inception of the league.   Bill Russell had like 4-5 HOFs on his team  West had Wilt and Elgin  Bird had Parish, Walton, and McHale  Magic had Kareem, Worthy, and Wilkes  Jordan had Pippen and Rodman  Tim Duncan had Manu and Parker  Pierce had KG, Ray Allen, and Rondo  Lebron had Dwyane and Bosh  Tim Duncan had Manu, Parker, and Kawhi  Lebron had Kyrie and Love  Curry had Klay and Dramond  Curry had Klay, Dramond, and Kevin Durant"
"I just don't see Giannis signing with the Lakers in 2021. That'd be way worse than if Kawhi signed in 2018. A B2B MVP joining a championship team led by Lebron and AD? That's a shade less embarrassing than Kevin Durant joining the 73-9 warriors who not only won a championship the year prior, beat his team after being down 3-1, and also had a B2B MVP and a unanimous one at that, a DPOY caliber player and perennial all star in Draymond who did win DPOY the first year KD joined, and a top 3 shooter of all time and perennial all star in Klay."
Kevin Durant? MJ? Magic? Kobe? Shaq? the list goes on and on and on...
"Not really. In terms of strictly this regular season + playoff performance, he was a top five player but there are still five or six players I think are better, if that makes any sense. I don't put too much weight on single playoff runs alongside the best player in the league when ranking players.   I'd still take LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Steph Curry, and a healthy Kevin Durant over him 100%. I'd have to think about it a bit more, but I might take James Harden and Luka Doncic as well. Giannis Antetokunmpo is probably out of my top five at this point. It seems like he'd be better to build a team around, but two straight postseasons have demonstrated that the flaws in his game make it really difficult to build a championship level offence around him. I appreciate that Davis is a better shooter but I don't trust him at all to be a team's best offensive player."
Lol the Celtics were just the Celtics then.  Maybe it's because fans didn't have Twitter to bitch about how hard Kevin Durant made it for them to think their poor shitty team had chance but super teams is a post 2011 concept
"I really hope people don't say the ""obvious"" answer 2012 because it was actually his most impressive title run after all the obstacles they faced.  First they were without Bosh and had to get past the Pacers who had them down 2-1. Lebron and Wade had two of their most impressive performances to get them out of that hole.  Then they had to get past the Celtics who had them down 3-2. Lebron had the most legendary game of his career in game 6 to tie it up.  Then they beat a near 60 win OKC team with the MVP runner up Kevin Durant and young Westbrook and Harden.  That is much more impressive than his championship this year where they faced teams that weren't threats to them."
Also the Celtics had the best chance at Tim Duncan. Didn't get the pick.  Best chance at Kevin Durant. Didn't get the pick.
"These men can get you a championship tier-  1) LeBron James 2) Steph Curry 3) Kawhi Leonard  Hang on, we think we were the best players on a championship team tier  4) Kevin Durant 5) Anthony Davis  Best regular season players in the world, regular season, tier-  6) Giannis Antetokounmpo 7) James Harden  Getting really close tier-  8) Luka Doncic 9) Jimmy Butler  Fringe top 10 tier  10) Nikola Jokic 11) Damian Lillard  Not fringe top 10 currently but will think they can get back there tier-  12) Paul George 13) Joel Embiid  The Great Kyle Lowry Tier-  14) Kyle Lowry  And the rest tier-  15) Chris Paul 16) Jamal Murray 17) Jayson Tatum 18) Klay Thompson 19) Pascal Siakam 20) Karl-Anthony Towns 21) Donovan Mitchell 22) Bradley Beal 23) Devin Booker 24) Rudy Gobert 25) Kyrie Irving"
"&gt; The three's example doesn't make any sense. Larry Bird was a better/greater basketball player than Kevin Garnett, it doesn't matter that KG played 21 seasons to Bird's 12 and therefore got way more cumulative stats.  KG certainly had a better career than Bird did and you're sleeping on how good KG was defensively.  Jordan's defense was outstanding in the early part of his career, but like everyone else, his late career All-Defense nods were reputation alone.    &gt;Karl Malone has more points scored than Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan, he's not a better scorer than any of them, cumulative stats are stupid and that's why longevity is overrated and nobody ever cared about cumulative stats until they tried to put LeBron in the GOAT discussion.   Defense stats are *extremely* difficult to get reliable information from. So much of it is scheme dependent and measures what doesn't happen. To measure what doesn't happen, you have to have a baseline for what does happen. Just looking decontextualized stats on Basketball Reference doesn't work.  &gt; Jordan got him beat on it, alongside points, steals, blocks, MVPs, DPOYs, scoring titles and steals titles.   Jordan also got him beat on usage rate because the game was different back then. Jordan got to go 1-on-1 in iso because of the illegal defense rules and help only came at the basket. Scoring titles don't mean much in the different defense rules, both players are the most efficient offensive players of their eras.    &gt; was also an outstanding passer considering how much he scored   and LeBron is the best passer at his position ever and on the very short list for best passers of all times. MJ was an excellent playmaker, but never reached LeBron's level.     &gt;People just can't accept that the greatest player they've seen isn't the greatest player of all time, that's the crux of this discussion. Believe kids, MJ was better, as insane as it might sound that someone was better than LeBron James, it's true.   There's the GenX fetish that no one can ever touch MJ and they can't accept greatness even when it's staring them in the face. This is LeBron's 4th championship and 9th finals trip in the last 10 years. Going to three straight finals with better teams than LeBron had around him exhausted Jordan so much he had to retire.  You like to discount endurance, but it matters."
Kevin Durant
"WS and VORP are cumulative stats, you rack them up by playing longer. Any stat that actually values how great you were without regardless of time Jordan beats him, like WS/48 and OBPM and DPBM. You can hate PER, but that doesn't change the fact that Jordan got him beat on it, alongside points, steals, blocks, MVPs, DPOYs, scoring titles and steals titles.  The three's example doesn't make any sense. Larry Bird was a better/greater basketball player than Kevin Garnett, it doesn't matter that KG played 21 seasons to Bird's 12 and therefore got way more cumulative stats.  Karl Malone has more points scored than Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Michael Jordan, he's not a better scorer than any of them, cumulative stats are stupid and that's why longevity is overrated and nobody ever cared about cumulative stats until they tried to put LeBron in the GOAT discussion.  Michael was the better player, plain and simple, he was the better scorer and defender and all the stats prove it, he was also an outstanding passer considering how much he scored, like i said, if Michael had retired in 1993 he would have less rings than LeBron does now and still would be the GOAT, everybody knew it back then, he didn't need to win more rings than Magic or as many as Kareem."
I feel like thats just because LeBron is a pretty unique first name. I don’t hear people saying “yeah Kevin did great for the Warriors” its always KD or Durant or smth.
1. Michael Jordan 2. Magic Johnson 3. LeBron James 4. Kareem Abdul Jabbar 5. Larry Bird 6. Hakeem Olajuwon 7. Shaquille O'Neal 8. Tim Duncan 9. Kobe Bryant 10. Kevin Durant  (I dont include players from pre 80s)
I think the 73-9 you are referring to is 2016 but I could be wrong. I am pretty sure that was my favorite year of NBA ever. That cavs - warriors finals was probably the greatest sports series I have ever watched in my entire life. 2017 was definitely one sided but I found it enjoyable since I am a huge Kevin Durant fan and 2018 in my opinion was actually more competitive than this year since the Rockets took the Warriors to 7 games. That series was also super fun whereas the Lakers nearly swept every team they played. In my opinion the 2019 season was better than this one as well just because of how many 7 game series was and how close the finals was as well. So yes it was fun than.
Kevin Durant wants his respect but the hypocrites won't give it to him.  There's really no difference to what he did and what the Lakers did.  It was just in reverse. Incoming downvotes.

Curry has had 2 season you can say can be taken as all-time seasons. Kevin Durant has been the second best player of this era. Curry is not topping KD all time.
"&gt;where he obviously had the best chance to win, he didn't join a super team he made one.  By joining other superstars on another team. Something people talk shit about Kevin Durant doing. People really trying to change facts lmao."
"Well, when you're right you're right.   *Wipes tears away.*  Now we got, King James, Davis, Howard, Rondo, (these are former all-stars), I should throw Kuzma in the mix, but he was a rising star. Eh, I guess you guys are missing Kevin Durant to be a Superteam, right?  Actually, I'll submit. My argument is weak because I forgot all about...  ...get ready...  [JaVALE MCGEE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSeszFGQ_v0)  Enjoy your 17th ring dork."
"""I want my damn respect"" was great, but it still isn't as good as ""You know who I am, I'm Kevin Durant"" imo. That was real swagger.  Nevertheless, today is LeBron's day. Deserved win, Best player in the NBA without doubt imo"
Kevin Durant with Russell Westbrook's mentality would be equal to LeBron James.
"I’m not gonna necessarily answer your question but I agree with you tbh. The Lakers imo, are in no way a super team, they are/were very much beatable. A definition of a super team is and always will be the the Kevin Durant and Curry Warriors, their 4th best player was/is one of the greatest shooters ever."
Kevin Durant
"Russ makes terrible decisions on the floor which is what kevin durant alluded too when he left okc, Giannis had multiple shots but he just got dominated by kawhi and by jimmy (his game and team need major improvements). I will give you harden and dame tho"
I feel like I remember Kevin Durant being drafted by the sonics.
Kevin Durant did. So did Justin Verlander. Why not LeBitch?
kevin durant
Dude yes! I was at a bar during March and I was watching a KD Thunder vs Spurs game and the guy asked if he could change the channel to watch like utah vs temple or something and I said no. You'd rather watch a bunch of accountants play basketball or Kevin fucking Durant and Tim Duncan?
"There isn’t a debate. It’s significantly harder to stay with one franchise and do what Mike, Kobe, Magic, Larry did than it is to conveniently jump from team to team and win the way Lebron did. People knock Kevin Durant for it but Lebron doing it makes him the GOAT?"
Kevin Durant 2018
Kevin Durant 2017
"I'm gonna use my team as an example. Kevin Durant did not stay long in the bay but he was intregal to warriors winning a few chips. Does his longevity say he is an all time franchise player, no. But he accomplished more in his short stint than some long time players. My point is that kawhi accomplished more in a year than any other raptors player in the history of your franchise.  And again basketball is a team game of course its not gonna be just kawhi. But he did the heavy lifting, he is the biggest reason the raptors won. No kawhi leonard, no ring its as simple as that."
That's not a super team. The big 3 Celtics were a super team. The Heatles were a super team. The Kevin Durant Warriors were a super team. This is not a super team. Sorry
"Congratulations Lakers. You’ve been the best team in the Playoffs for sure. A different animal compared to the club from the regular season. Never underestimate Lebron. Never count him out until the shot clock ticks 0... unless you have a team with Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant."
"Danny Green has 3 rings, one more than Kevin Durant"
Spo in the locker room: it’s ok all we have to do is sign Kevin Durant at halftime
Sign Kevin Durant
I agree. There's three reasons IMO why I think it's a bad idea.  1) Kevin Durant.  2) How effective is he going to be playing on such a painful injury?  3) Why break up the current chemistry of the line-up that has won 2 games already. You want to shorten your rotation not increase it in the finals.
Kevin Durant ring a bell?
LeBron is a ring chaser but his ring chasing has not come close to what Kevin Durant did in 2016.
no he reminds me of Kevin Durant
"I think people are saying no simply because the Lakers have lebron James. Which is fair being he’s the best player on the floor at all times except maybe some instances when he was facing Kevin Durant but even then you can argue either way and not be wrong. The heat are easily a better team in terms of depth, and they have many more guys that play with heart and absolutely no fear. Tbh the heat are basically what everyone wanted the clippers to be, and a lot of people had them winning it all over the lakers. I think it’s fair and even right to say that the heat are a better team, but the lakers 2 best players are 2 of the 3 best players on the court. I still have the Lakers as favorites but we’ve learned the hard way not to doubt the will of jimmy butler and that organization of absolute dawgs."
"Absolutely. Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Rudy Gobert, and Paul George are all undoubtedly top 20-ish players in the league who are CONSTANTLY hated on. I haven't heard anyone say anything at all positive about Paul George in about a month"

"Nah, he had Kevin Durant right in front of his face. He would not have been able to lay that in. He should have passed it out to lebron."
"Settle down there, sport. That wasn't a personal attack or anything. No need to get so emotional about it.  The real laughable take is calling him a ""god tier"" coach. You didn't make any supporting arguments, but let me rebut:   He took over a stacked team that was underperforming and definitely made major improvements, but they got incredibly fortunate during their first title run. Tony Allen got injured when they were losing to the Grizzlies. Losing one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA at the time completely changed the series.  Then the Clippers, who were widely believed to be the best team in the West and maybe the NBA, choked their series away to the Rockets. The Warriors didn't have to beat them, and their size would've been a terrible matchup for the Warriors. Then in the finals, Kyrie and Kevin Love were both injured. They beat LeBron and....... Dellavedova? And they still struggled to put them away. But whatever, a lot of titles have a little luck in them, so let's see what they do next year. In 2016 they have an incredible season and make the finals again... and then become the first team in NBA history to blow a 3-1 lead in the finals. Yeesh. Then the next 2 seasons they win the title with the deck stacked unbelievably in their favor. Nobody believed any other team had a shot at those titles. Then in 2019, they had some bad injury breaks with Durant and Klay going down. They still had Steph and Dray though, and all the analytics point to Steph being their most important player. But it didn't matter, they still lost to the Raptors who were definitely good, but not unbeatable. Then this season they have D'Angelo Russell and Draymond Green, 2 all-stars which is more talent than a lot of teams have, and they finish worst in the NBA. You can blame it on tanking, but I guess that shows that they think Steph, Klay, Draymond, and Andrew Wiggins aren't enough for Kerr to win...   ""God tier"" would mean he's one of the all-time greats. He's not even a top 5 current coach. Give me Spo, Nick Nurse, Pop, Brad Stevens, and Carlisle over Kerr. I'm not calling him a shit coach, but I do think he gets too much credit, which your comment supports.  And as for him as a player, again, I didn't call him a shit player. I said he was ok. He was a really good spot-up shooter but that was it. You said teams didn't prioritize the 3 in his era, but that means teams didn't defend the 3. He also averaged less than 2 3s attempted per game for his career. And he got the benefit of getting open looks created by guys like Jordan, Pippen, Duncan, and The Admiral. He never averaged 10ppg, and never averaged 5 assists per game. And you're so offended that I called him an ok player? Again, that proves the point that he is way more memorable than his skills actually merited.   Hell, I would even take John Paxson as a player over Kerr. You probably would too if you actually watched those games."
"Well I replied with these 14 minutes ago, but I guess if you don't acknowledge it than you can keep pretending that the Thunder fanbase is spotless.  https://www.sbnation.com/2016/11/3/13485236/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-fans-warriors  https://247sports.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/Article/Disgruntled-fan-issued-death-threats-to-Thunder-staffers-133771142/"

"Kevin Durant is great, but his OKC years proved that automatic title contender status was not a guarantee."
"Regardless of our personal opinions, haven’t people noticed that as time has passed, history is being more kind to Kevin Durant.  And I imagine in 20-30+ years, almost none of the negativity will show up on his list of accolades."
"The top 13 teams in the West have 30+ wins  Only the top 8 seeds in the East had 30+ wins  Next year pretty much every team *cough* except OKC *cough* seems to be trying to get better for a playoff spot or making the jump to contender for the title. Maybe the Spurs go ahead and do what they can to improve their draft odds, but that’s about it. Warriors will be taking a playoff spot from somebody as well..   The Eastern conference can hardly say the same. I feel like the Cavs, Pistons, Hornets, and Knicks are sure fire picks to be bottom feeders next year. However there is a definite bonus coming in a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant and potential for young players like Tatum, Pascal, or Simmons to reach another level. A scenario exists in a couple years where the Eastern conference has a similar level of star power that is simply younger across the board than the West. God forbid any of the East stars get disgruntled and sent West.   Teams like the 76ers, Pacers, Magic, Wizards have potential to turn out really great or their situations could turn shit really fast...   Overall I think the West is more stable and you have more teams that know what they wanna do over the next five years than the East. The East has a lot of variability and best case scenario becomes better than the top seeds in the West in a few years. It’s hard for me to see a scenario where the East is better top to bottom anytime soon though"
“Im Kevin Durant. Y’all know who I am.”
"It’s not the fact he joined the best team in the league, it’s the context of it being the team that he failed to eliminate in the playoffs the year before. “Can’t beat em? Join em!” - Kevin Durant"
"I will try one or two for every team. Some of these are far-fetched and depend either on title or spending most of their careers with one team. I couldn't find one for Indy no matter how much I dug.  Atlanta Hawks - Trae Young, Joe Johnson?  Boston Celtics - Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen  Brooklyn Nets - Kevin Durant  Charlotte Hornets - Kemba Walker?  Chicago Bulls - Derrick Rose  Cleveland Cavaliers - LeBron James  Dallas Mavericks - Luka Doncic, JJ Barea?  Denver Nuggets - Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony?  Detroit Pistons - Grant Hill?  Golden State Warriors - Steph, Klay, Dray  Houston Rockets - James Harden, Tracy Mcgrady?  Indiana Pacers -   Los Angeles Clippers - Chris Paul, Blake Griffin  Los Angeles Lakers - Anthony Davis  Memphis Grizzlies - Mike Conley, Marc Gasol  Miami Heat - LeBron James, Udonis Haslem?  Milwaukee Bucks - Giannis  Minnesota Timberwolves - KAT, Kevin Garnett?  New Orleans Pelicans - Zion  New York Knicks - Carmelo Anthony?  Oklahoma City Thunder - Russell Westbrook  Orlando Magic - Dwight Howard  Philadelphia 76ers - Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons  Phoenix Suns - Devin Booker  Portland Trail Blazers - Dame Lillard  Sacramento Kings - Mike Bibby?  San Antonio Spurs - Tony Parker  Toronto Raptors - Kyle Lowry, Vince Carter  Utah Jazz - Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell  Washington Wizards - Bradley Beal"
"He also played in 2017, the year they didn't come back, where Kevin Durant led the scoring for GSW every game.   Not many minutes, but still. It is completely fair that he says Kevin Durant haunted his dreams"
i want to see KD be kevin motherfucking durant hes fun as hell to watch.kyrie is the coach tho so meh
"Rent via Dunk is essentially explaining how Kevin Durant pays his bills.   Kawhi’s is just explaining whenever he guards Bron  Andre’s explains his time with the Splash Bros.   Kyrie, PG, and Markieff, self explanatory"
Is he going to piss off kevin durant too?
"giannis is empty stats. jokic is empty stats. lillard is empty stats. luka is empty stats.   all of those players have been, at best, to a conference finals. Same as Loser Harden.  only champs in my top 10  1. lebron 2. AD 3. Rondo (rings) 4. Curry 5. Klay 6. Durant 7. Kyrie 8. Javale Muhgee 9. Lowry 10. Kawhi - LOL yeah right he choked 3-1.  Actual 10 - Kevin Love"
"As cheap as the move was, watching KD is just... one of the best scorers.  I still put on that game where he murdered the Clippers after saying, ""I’m Kevin Durant. You know who I am."""
No Kevin Durant ruined everything by going there
I think we could've beaten them if Klay Thompson hadn't gotten injured but we stood little chance with Kevin Durant healthy too
Kevin Durant should be here as well
&gt;[Durant says he's decided to wear No. 7 in Brooklyn because it stands for completion in the Bible.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kevin-durants-new-headspace-11568119028)  your googling skills are garbage
"“Oh look, it’s Los Angeles Lakers star Kevin Durant” –Lando, probably"
“Im Kevin Durant. Y’all know who I am.”
"It's not ""cherry picking"" to exclude playoff runs with the most stacked team ever assembled. Harden would have performed just as well if he had that team around him. Kevin Durant played next to Steph Curry (repeat MVP who is both the greatest shooter and off-ball threat of all time) and Klay Thompson (arguably the second greatest shooter of all time)."
"Harden being a better scorer than KD is objectivly true   -------  #Kevin Durant at Oklahoma City Thunder (2009-2016)  **Playoffs**  - 28.9 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 3.7 APG  - 45.5 FG%, 32.9 3P%, 84.8 FT% on 57.5 TS% (46.2% of 2Ps &amp; 73.9% of 3Ps assisted)   ----------------------------------------  #James Harden at Houston Rockets (2012-2020)  **Playoffs**  - 28.4 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 7.1 APG  - 42.1 FG%, 32.4 3P%, 87.1 FT% on 57.8 TS% (15.0% of 2Ps &amp; 30.8% of 3Ps assisted)"
"Yeah, sometimes teams are victims of circumstance and timing. The Warriors were able to sign Steph Curry to a below-market contract due to his balky ankles at the time. Then, Kevin Durant was able to join them due to the great salary cap spike of 2016. And they still were almost there."
"Yeah that was a weird quote for me as well. Kevin Durant was a dude that could’ve easily one gone 1 overall, how could getting him at 2 be the best pick of the decade?"
"&gt; the third-best pick made by the entire NBA over the past decade, after Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin.  Gasol is very good and all, but no way is he's the third best pick of the decade over the likes of Curry, Harden, Kawhi, etc."
"KD is a beast for sure. Imo, he could still round out into the starting 5.   But Bird's is a better player than he's usually thought of imo. Here are their head to head numbers. https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id1=duranke01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_hint=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2_select=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id2=birdla01&amp;idx=bbr__players  Their shooting percentages are mostly the same. Bird was a great shooter and scorer too. I think he brings a little bit more playmaking, rebounding, and toughness/defense than KD would bring. Also, Bird's usage rate is a bit less than KD, so I figured he'd be able to play off the ball a bit more comfortably. KD is definitely more athletic though, and for me, whenever I watch a Bird highlight, he just doesn't look like he should be anything more than a role player, until you see his insane statline and all. He also carried those Boston teams to a championship and won 3 back to back to back MVP's, so I think he has a bit more than KD does as far as belonging to a greatest starting 5. But I thought about it for a long time between those two. KD can still round it out for sure as the 5th player on the team imo."
"I think a better, more fair way to evaluate the two would be by look at the same age seasons and tracking their per 36 minutes. Since you want to look at Kawhi's 2015-2020 run, which he was age 23-28, we could look at those same ages for KD, which are 2012-2017. Per 36 also evens out the minutes played discrepancy, which there is a pretty big one (KD: 5,598 minutes played vs. Kawhi: 4,358).   When you adjust to look at the same amount of time played, it looks like this:   **Kevin Durant (ages 23-28):** 2012-2017 playoffs per 36 minutes  * 26 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 3.6 APG, 1.0 BPG, .9 SPG * FG: 8.8, FGA: 18.5, 47.5 FG% * 3P: 2.0, 3PA: 5.5, 35.2 3P%,  * FT: 6.5, FTA: 7.5, 86.4 FT%  * Win shares per 48: .198 * BPM: 6.9 * VORP: 12.6 * 1 Rings * 1 Finals MVPs  **Kawhi Leonard (ages 23-28):** 2012-2017 playoffs per 36 minutes  * 20.9 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 2.8 APG, 0.7 BPG, 1.8 SPG * FG: 7.4, FGA: 14.7, 50.4 FG% * 3P: 1.7, 3PA: 4.2, 39.9 3P%,  * FT: 4.4, FTA: 5.2, 83.9 FT%  * Win shares per 48: .220 * BPM: 7.8 * VORP: 10.8 * 1 Rings * 1 Finals MVPs  Looking at these ages, the number of rings and MVPs even out. KD's offensive numbers are significantly higher, not just in ppg but also in volume. He took (and made) more shots, more threes, and got to the line more often, a sign that he carried more of an offensive load than Leonard did. Digging into his offensive BPM reveals 6.3, which is significantly higher than Leonards at 5.1  Leonard had less of an offensive load (fewer shots taken and made), but was more efficient with the load he was assigned. Plus, his defensive minutes were overwhelmingly better than KDs. Leonard had a 2.8 Defensive BPM to KD's 0.6. So Leonard had a far bigger impact on the defensive end than KD, so much so that it contributes to an overall higher BPM.   But KD's VORP is higher than Leonard's during this time period, which suggests that his contributions are greater than Leonards' compared to a replacement level player.   I think OP's original assessment that Leonard is a more efficient offensive player is true, but it doesn't reflect that Leonard has also had less offensive responsibility/load compared to KD. He took fewer 3s and never got to the line as much, signs that he didn't space out the floor or pressure the defense as much.   But Leonard's impact on the defensive end seems to make up for that load in a way that can tip the scales.   One last interesting datapoint to examine: **win shares.** KD's overall win shares over his period of time were 23.1, while Leonard's were 20.0, which means that KD led to more overall winning. But when adjusted to per 48 minutes, it shifts to KD contributing .198 and Leonard contributing .220. Again, Kawhi was more efficient, but KD carried a larger load.   I think you can *really* argue either way looking at these numbers, but if I'm a GM or coach what I'm seeing is that I can ask *more* of KD than Kawhi, to take more shot, to take more threes, to drive to the rim more, and to play more minutes. And what I'm seeing from Kawhi is that he can have a greater overall impact on winning even if he's not the main offensive engine.  If my team doesn't have as many offensive weapons and is lacking depth and I don't have much of a chance to make a real playoff run with what I have, then I'll probably go with KD and hope that his offensive volume, gravity, and endurance can win me more games. If I have a team with some good weapons and a sound system and I need just one piece to bring it all together to make a playoff run, then I want Leonard to be that high-energy defensive menace and to be efficient with a reduced offensive responsibility."
"1. Kawhi Leonard is not a ""system"" player. He's a legitimate superstar and one of the greatest playoff scorers ever. Toronto's half court offenses fucking tanked in the regular season and playoffs after he left.   2. Kawhi Leonard is a far better playoff performer than OKC Kevin Durant even if you remove his first run in 2010 (which I always do when comparing the two just to be fair).   It's not really close at all. The only reason people think Durant is better is because he won an MVP and four scoring titles. He rarely duplicated his regular season efficiency in the playoffs."
how about that time he went up 3-2 before his co star went down against a 73 win team that made 2 finals and won a ring and then replaced their worst starter with kevin durant.    KD had a prime westbrook on his team and he couldn't even beat the normal warriors and prime lebron and kyrie playing supernova basketball  barely squeaked out a series win against them yet harden is a choker for losing to the warriors +KD?
"It's not ""cherry picking"" to exclude playoff runs with the most stacked team ever assembled. Kawhi Leonard would have performed just as well if he had that team around him. He performed almost as well in 2017 and 2019 despite not having remotely as much offensive talent. Kevin Durant played next to Steph Curry (repeat MVP who is both the greatest shooter and off-ball threat of all time) and Klay Thompson (arguably the second greatest shooter of all time)."
"Shoot for the moon and even if you miss you'll land among the stars  The Lakers for example missed on Kevin Durant in 2016, but because they had diligently laid the groundwork for a max free agent, they were able to quickly pivot and use the capspace on Deng and Mozgov instead"
1. LeBron James 2. Kevin Garnett 3. Stephen Curry 4. Kevin Durant 5. Kawhi Leonard 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo 7. James Harden 8. Dwight Howard 9. Anthony Davis 10. Derrick Rose
Bird had a great shot too. That was one of the best parts about his game.   Here is KD and LB stat comparisons. https://stathead.com/basketball/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;player_id1_hint=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id1_select=Larry+Bird&amp;player_id1=birdla01&amp;idx=bbr__players&amp;player_id2_hint=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2_select=Kevin+Durant&amp;player_id2=duranke01&amp;idx=bbr__players  Their shooting percentages seem roughly equivalent.
Cool. Dwight still could be productive. Does that mean he had the same impact of a prime Kevin Durant or AD when he played with Harden? Hell no.
"Yeah, if those odds are right 4-9 clearly better. I saw a site that had 2-9 though which would put Luka back at 1.   Oddshark using Bovada saying  * Luka Doncic +450 * Anthony Davis	+550 * Giannis Antetokounmpo +650 * Stephen Curry +650 * LeBron James	+900 * Kevin Durant	+900 * Jayson Tatum	+1000 * James Harden	+1200 * Damian Lillard	+1600 * Kawhi Leonard+2000"
Clickbait. I thought I would see Kevin Durant
"BREAKING: The Houston Rockets have agreed in principle to trade Russell Westbrook to the Brooklyn Nets for Caris Lavert, Deandre Jordan, and Taurean Prince. Sources say Kevin Durant was driving force behind trade"
"But it still had Kevin Durant one of the best scorers of all time, who rightly left because Westbrook was holding him back.  Presti was so smart in letting the Rockets figure out that headache. I mean the first Chris Paul year had the Thunder overachieve.  All Westbrook could give OKC are first round exits due to upsets."
Kevin Durant leaving OKC to join a 73-9 team.
Its probably cause he took the easy way out to get a championship.  Same reason people want Kevin Durant to lose
"You don't need an insider to see this.  Many former teammates say the same thing.  He may be a star on the field, but he doesn't have the charisma of a LeBron James, a Stephen Curry, an Anthony Davis, or even a Kevin Durant."
"By definition it needs to be a player that can score in any way possible AND plays in an awful team. Like, Kobe had 26 at the half and the Lakers trailed by 14, he had 53 through three quarters and they were only up by 6.  It would need to be something like a pre-injury Kevin Durant playing for the Charlotte Bobcats. The players that have the ability to score 80+ are players that can score in all five ways and in today's game there aren't many players that can do that. It's much easier to double team a 6ft to 6-3 guard that can't post up and isn't physically imposing, so that rules out guys like Dame, Steph, Trae and others simply because if they got ultra hot, team's would just start double and triple teaming them in ways you couldn't really do with Kobe.  To score that much you need to get hot from 3, be a great midrange shooter to pick up easy midrange jumpers when team's sell out for your 3 and be physically imposing enough that you can post up and power through in the paint for some easy FTs and layups.  Kawhi and KD are the ones that come to mind as having the skillset to do it, but neither of them got Kobe's mentality to shoot 46 times in a regular season game nor they play on team's bad enough for them to need to do it.  If i had to pick a player i would go for Zach LaVine, as theoretically he almost got all the skills and plays on one of the worst teams in the league, but i don't think he's good enough."
"Bro, this guy would potentially be a 7-time champion already if it wasn't for those meddling warriors or a 6-time champion if it wasn't because of that meddling Kevin Durant."
"If he comes back at full health, I chose Kevin Durant.   If he doesn't come back at 100%, James Harden would be my pick."
"This is true, and the skill level in the nba is unfathomable, but defense is never a certainty  We talk about this here a lot, how dragan bender could beat the best player here so bad he never picks up a ball again  1) Kevin Durant is on this sub  2) if you’re talking one bucket, if you have any sort of solid handle, anything can happen  In “he got game” Denzel legitimately scored several times on Ray Allen. The script was supposed to be Ray winning 11-0, but Spike Lee decides to just have them play 1v1 for real.  Denzel might’ve been good when he was younger, but in 1998 he was 44, playing against *Ray Allen*.  Go watch the clip—there’s nothing special about Denzel’s game  And he still scores several buckets in a row. Ray takes over because Denzel gets exhausted.  I watched an interview with Ray about it, and he says afterwards he got asked by people who worked on the film like “how could you let that happen?” “How did he score on you?”  And Ray was just like, man, sometimes a guy just puts up a bad shot and it goes in, that’s basketball."
Kevin Durant would like to have a word with you.
Kevin Durant is definitely the best of those 4
"Kevin Durant for scoring ability, spacing, and length"
Oh we’re bringing up easy paths to the Finals? Bet.   2015 Warriors faced:  R1: Pelicans without Jrue Holiday  R2: Memphis without Mike Conley  R3: Rockets without Pat Bev  Finals: Cleveland without Love and Kyrie   2017: KEVIN GODDAMN DURANT JOINS THE TEAM TO STOP LEBRON  R1: Portland without Nurkic  R3: Spurs without Kawhi and Parker  2018:  R2: Pelicans without Cousins  R3: Rockets without CP3 for half of the series  Good try tho
Kevin Durant Jimmy Butler Joel Embid Donovan Mitchell  Luka Doncic  All VERY good players in the EASTERN conference
"LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Giannis, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Luka Doncic, Jayson Tatum, Trae Young, Kyrie Irving and KAT are all easily better than Westbrook. There are also strong arguments for Donovan Mitchell, Jamal Murray, Chris Paul, Paul George, Ben Simmons, Klay Thompson, and Bradley Beal being better. This list also doesn’t include Kevin Durant. The man is absolutely not top 15."
lebron james. kevin durant.
"They already did. The NBA was going to bring distribution in house and focus on partnering with big tech companies for direct streaming services because it was profitable enough at the time. The networks panicked and super overbid in order to keep the media rights. The owners saw all that easy cash and took the deal. The enormous influx of cash from the network desperation deal resulted in a spike to the salary cap.   The league suggested a 3 year cap smoothing so that contracts wouldn’t be chaotic. The NBPA union declined because that meant they’d be essentially leaving money on the table. The salary cap spike all hit in a single year. That spike is what permitted Golden State to add Kevin Durant to their already expensive 73-9 roster.  If the NBA had just taken distribution in house and gone digital, we could’ve all taken de pledge, NBA streams would be awesome by now, and the KD Warriors would’ve never happened. Also, LeBron probs has one or two more rings."
"Nah bro, Kevin Durant is better because he won easy bullshit championships with the core of a 73-9 team"
"Harden is also a phenomenal scorer with better TS% than KD who got most of his points assisted at OKC.   Just look what both of them have done individually without a super team behind them....  -------  #Kevin Durant at Oklahoma City Thunder (2009-2016)  **Playoffs**  - 28.9 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 3.7 APG  - 45.5 FG%, 32.9 3P%, 84.8 FT% on 57.5 TS% (46.2% of 2Ps &amp; 73.9% of 3Ps assisted)   ----------------------------------------  #James Harden at Houston Rockets (2012-2020)  **Playoffs**  - 28.4 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 7.1 APG  - 42.1 FG%, 32.4 3P%, 87.1 FT% on 57.8 TS% (15.0% of 2Ps &amp; 30.8% of 3Ps assisted)"
"No he isn't. He's a ball-dominant, iso-reliant scorer that relies on free-throws and 3-pointers. He can't play off the ball, he doesn't have a post game, and he has no sort of mid-range game.   Kevin Durant is probably the most versatile offensive player in the league."
That would be Kevin Durant.
See how Tony Allen defends larger guys like Kevin Durant etc
"Yeah but the casual fan doesn't care about Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell scoring on each other. They want to watch Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, and those guys being out hurts the league"
"...what?  &amp;#x200B;  you don't think having your star pointguard (1 of the 2 allstars on the team) in a series where you're heavily outmatched against Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green  (4 allstars including 2 MVP's and a DPOY) but still up 3-2 would make things ""much easier going forward?"""

"Morey built a team with the sole purpose of beating the Warriors and didn't beat the Warriors - what more are you looking for?  Myers was involved in everything the Warriors did from 2011 onward - that includes drafting Draymond, hiring Kerr, bringing in Iguodala, Livingston, Bogut, West, and Kevin Durant.  He built a dynasty where the last GM was actually debating about whether to keep Curry or Monta Ellis.  Myers has done tons."

"Because sometimes the most efficient shot is a midrange. Go look at Kevin Durant, Kobe, Jordan, etc. Allowing only westbrook to shoot midranges is also dumb. The rockets got swept off the court because they're not good enough. Blow it up."
"I thought the tweet about ""kevin durant-backed"" would be enough evidence, but here's a more direct quote from forbes: ""It’s common for superstar athletes with huge reaches to get discounted rates on their startup investments. Those athletes can provide increased awareness for the brands, as Durant did with a video in which he posed as a Postmates delivery rider. Tennis icon Roger Federer made an investment in 2019 for a significant stake in Swiss running shoe On and has attracted new attention for the brand."" (https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2020/06/30/kevin-durant-scores-15-million-payday-with-potential-uber-buy-of-postmates/#6a4398fd69d7)   Are you genuinely asking if a famous person with a huge platform who invests in a company will help the company beyond their monetary investment? How many cases of body armor did LA boys go out and buy just cuz kobe was backing it?"
LeBron James   Steph Curry   Kevin Durant   James Harden  Kawhi Leonard   Giannis Antetokounmpo   Anthony Davis  I can't see anybody else being in the top 7 in the league.
step one: make sure he is facing a team with Kevin Durant that he previously beat in a close game 7.
"No. The first thing you have to do is look at matchups. Rudy Gobert has played in six total playoff series over the last 4 years. These are his opponents: Lob City Clippers (4-3 win), GSW (4-0 sweep), OKC Thunder (4-2 win) Rockets (4-1 loss), Rockets (4-1 loss) and Denver Nuggets(4-3 loss ). The thing about Gobert, and Utah’s defensive strategy overall, is to make the opponent take tough, midrange shots at a low percentage. We freely give those up because there’s very few players in the league that can hit those shots effectively. The two best are probably Chris Paul and Kevin Durant. They’ve been involved in 4 of Rudy’s 6 playoff series and sunk a bunch of midrange shots. Against the nuggets this year, Denver shot 10% better from midrange than they did during the regular season. IIRC, both this year and last year we forced our opponents into the worst shots as measured by Total Shot Quality in the first round. It’s just in this year’s series Murray and Jokic (historically average to below average shooters) turned into Steph Curry and KAT. The year before, we shot 25% from wide open threes despite shooting something like 39% in the regular season. Gobert’s relative lack of playoff success (keep in mind we’ve never been a higher seeded team) is largely a function of poor matchups and some bad luck. Also keep in mind for this year we won the minutes both Rudy and Jokic played by a decent margin. We lost that series whenever Rudy was on the bench"
"According to Kevin Durant, signing with Warriors was the hardest road."
"According to Kevin Durant, yes."
how could kevin durant even achieve this before he left the western conference?
"There will be a player in the future that will clearly passed Jordan and Lebron as GOAT.  He will have a better finals record than Jordan, and he will also be better than lebron in all 5 categories  (Pts,Ast,Rebs,Blocks,Steals). He will have the prime/peak of Jordan, and longevity of Lebron combined. He will also be as great as a shooter as Kevin Durant, and as good as a defender as Pippen.   He will have 2k like stats in real life.   If that player comes in the future, the MJ VS Lebron debate will be lessen.  Ps: It's just a matter  of if you are still alive when this player exist."
"He’s also arguably the best player not named LeBron James, Kevin Durant or Kawhi Leonard"
"harden averaged more points (11 more), assists, rebounds, blocks, steals on higher TS, FG, 3p%, and had better advanced stats in every category when he played against curry last year. he just didn’t have kevin durant and klay thompson backing him up"
"He’s a great player and all, but I’m not sure if he can accomplish enough to put himself in the top 10. When I think of players who can be argued in belonging in the top 10, I think of Elgin Baylor, Paul Arizin, and George Mikan. Kevin Durant is top 20 maybe 15."
JR Smith &gt; Kevin Durant confirmed
"I bring Luka up because that's ostensibly the choice that Giannis is going to have next summer. Do I want to stay in Milwaukee and play with Kirkland Kevin Durant, or do I want to play with possibly the greatest player of his generation. Look dude I'm not happy about it, I'm a Spurs fan I hate the Mavs. But when I watch the Bucks, I don't see a supporting cast capable of winning four rounds. Just based on his career so far I don't think Middleton is capable of being the second guy on a championship team in league where LeBron and AD are playing together."
"Of course both players will benefit from each other. Curry gets to pass out of the double and triple team to Kevin fucking Durant, KD benefits more from playing with Curry than the other way around.    Did you watch the 2016 finals? Go back and count how many open shots Barnes bricked.    Who's disputing that Durant is a generational talent? No one.  People point to both their stats to prove that Durant was the FMVP.   Sure Durant has been doing this for years, but he always had to work for it. I can't even count how many wide open layups he got because they were double and triple teaming Curry.   Are you really trying to argue that the Cavs were better in 2018 than 2016 just because LeBron had one of the best playoffs run ever? Come on, son. The Cavs with Kyrie was an historically great offensive team, only GS was better."
"I think that’s what he’s saying. GSW shoots a lot of 3s because we have Steph and Klay (and KD), but we’re an anomaly to just have #1 and #2 shooters and Kevin Durant. He’s discouraging other teams from forming a structure similar to GSW because nobody else has that level of shooting ability other than the Warriors with KD."
"Five years of free agents going to La Disagree with you. Lamarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron when he went to Cleveland, Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard. Anyone else I missed?   There was a time no one wanted to come to L.A."
"Here is a list of guys who were drafted after LeBron that I think will retire before him:  -	Andre Iguodala  -	Lou Williams -	Chris Paul -	LaMarcus Aldridge  -	Rajon Rondo -	Kyle Lowry -	Paul Millsap -	Rudy Gay -	JJ Redick -	Al Horford -	Joakim Noah  -	Kevin Durant -	Nick Young -	Marc Gasol -	Jeff Green -	Jared Dudley -	Russel Westbrook  -	Kevin Love -	Goran Dragić -	Serge Ibaka -	Mike Conley -	Brook Lopez -	Eric Gordon -	Derrick Rose -	JaVale McGee -	George Hill  The 2009 draft class (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NBA_draft is where you start to see guys that are more borderline (Blake Griffin, James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Steph Curry, Jrue Holiday).  That being said, I could see LeBron retiring after every single guy mentioned here."
1. Michael Jordan 2. LeBron James 3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4. Magic Johnson 5. Larry Bird 6. Bill Russell 7. Wilt Chamberlain 8. Kobe Bryant 9. Tim Duncan 10. Shaquille O’Neal 11. Hakeem Olajuwon 12. Steph Curry 13. Kevin Durant 14. Oscar Robertson 15. Jerry West
PG: Magic Johnson / Larry Bird - Either of them would work but if I had to choose I think it's Larry Bird for me for Shooting.  SG: Michael Jordan - No need to say.  SF: Kevin Durant - Unguardable 7 footer.  PF: Tim Duncan / Kevin Garnett - Either of them would work though I'll choose Kevin Garnett because of his Athleticism.  C:  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - A tall guy who has an unstoppable move and score.
Kevin Durant
Might be the bubble though. I watched him drain 8 threes in a row going against Kevin Durant in a horse game a few years ago at the all star game.
"In my opinion, Greg Oden in 2007, they miss Kevin Durant"
Does Udonis Haslem count?  Also obviously Kevin Durant for both GSW and OKC.
"Curry is good enough to have a system built around him, just like with LeBron. Are we gonna hold it against him too. Everyone needs help to beat the best players in the league. Nobody can win on his own. However, Curry is much more valuable for his team success than anyone else.   Basketball isn't 1v1 or else Kobe Bryant &amp; Kevin Durant would be top 3 players in NBA history together with MJ. It's a 5v5 sport &amp; very few players is anywhere near close to Curry's level of impact on the court.   Longevity does matter, but not nearly as much as you want to make it out. Karl Malone has far, far more productive seasons than Larry Bird. However, Larry Bird is top 10 player all-time while it can't be said the same for Malone. Steph Curry already won 3 Championships &amp; created a dynasty as the main piece."
Not for Kevin Durant.
"LeBron, Kevin Durant(if 100%), Kawhi, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis"
"Here is an actual tier list that makes sense:  Tier 1- God of shooting: Steph Curry Tier 2- Snipers and shooting specialists: Dirk, Nash, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird Tier 3- Good/great shooters: Kobe, Michael Jordan*, LBJ*, Karl Malone*, James Harden Tier 4- Streaky, not great, but will punish you if open: Tim Duncan, Magic, Michael Jordan*, LBJ*, Allen Iverson, Hakeem, David Robinson, Barkley, Karl Malone*, Garnett, Erving, Magic Tier 5- Leave them open: Derrick Rose, Westbrook, Giannis and basically everyone else I haven't listed. Tier 6- Nonexistent shooting: Shaq"
lol there's a difference between shane battier's reputation as a shooter and steph's. steph taking heaves doesn't really alter his 3P% the way shane battier's would be affected.   &gt; such a rare trait in a super-duper star  as opposed to which star other than kevin durant who refuses to shoot heaves?
"LeBron, Kevin Durant, Kawhi, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis. Also, saying Kevin Durant healthy isn’t healthy to post injury standards but to how he was before, him at number 2 is assuming he goes back to his regular self."
Titles in Okc of course would help him in his title for goat ? Kevin durant is 32 coming off a serious injury he’s only 3 years younger than Lebron and has only been discussed as the very best player in the league a few times in his career. He’s playing at the same time as Lebron so I don’t see how he could possible pass him at this point.
"This reminds me of an old Grantland recurring feature where they remind you that Rick Barnes did not make the Sweet 16 with Kevin Durant on his team. Remember, Rick Barnes did not make the Sweet 16 with Kevin Durant on his team."
Current player? Hmm probably only Kevin Durant honestly.
"Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. 4 all stars and couldnt even win one legitimate title. At least that's what r/nba told me every day for the last 3 years"
Kyrie was a great player already.  And Cavs had cap space and other lottery picks on the team and were able to acquire Kevin Love.  So Lebron stepped into a scenario that was primed for winning.  He didn’t build anything.  Kyrie plus Love and Durant or Butler or literally any other super star would have competed for rings without LeBron.
Because he’s not as consistent as those players. Ending up at 15th isn’t anything to scoff at.  He also wasnt the “undisputed” best player in his teams. See Kevin Durant.
"Well you brought up the two worst teams that MJ faced in the ECF when I’m contesting Lebron’s final appearances. In fact, the idea that MJ’s two worst ECF opponents are better than the majority of Lebron’s (I’d say 2011 Bulls and 2013 Pacers are better than those 2) proves my point.  We’re talking about finals appearances buddy, Kevin Durant never played in the East. The version of KG that Lebron actually beat was worse than Mourning, the version of Duncan that Lebron beat was worse than prime Ewing (although you could probably debate this tbh).  Yeah, yeah, milkmen and plumbers. You’re implying Lebron didn’t do the exact same thing to beat Boston as well.  Notorious bums Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving  and Dwyane Wade. You also didn’t even respond to half my points in favor of just downvoting me and calling me an idiot."
1) LeBron James  2) Michael Jordan/Magic Johnson/Kevin Durant/Kobe Bryant/Larry Bird  7) Kareem Abdul Jabbar/Tim Duncan/Hakeem Olajuwon/Wilt Chamberlain/Shaquille ONeal
You hit the nail on the head there. Here are how young those players were when they made their first All-NBA team.        |Players|Age Years|Age Days| :--|--:|--:| |LeBron James|21|110| |Kevin Durant|21|197| |Tim Duncan|21|359| |Shaquille O'Neal|22|49|    Luka Doncic was 21 years and 168 days old when he made it.
&gt; How many players were MVP-level players in their second season at age 20?      - Kevin Durant finished 2nd in MVP voting when he was 21.    - LeBron James finished 2nd in MVP voting when he was 21.    - Shaq finished 4th in MVP voting when he was 21.     - Tim Duncan finished 5th in MVP voting when he was 21.       - Luka finished 4th in MVP voting when he was 21. So definitely some absolutely elite company at the top.
"Right. And yet the KD-less warriors still broke their record and finished the season 73-9. Only to be beaten by Lebron James. Now add Kevin fucking Durant to that 73-9 team. You're saying if you swap lebron for Jordan in the 2017 and 2018 cavs, that they would beat the warriors in  the finals? Stop it."
"An absolutely Elite tier post mate, loved the analysis. Also so happy to see someone extol the virtues of Kevin Durant as the best offensive player of all time. I also do think he could potentially lay a claim to that with some longevity, but his qualities as a ball player are just mind-blowing to me, loved to see them put eloquently by yourself. Also loved the Harden analysis, as well as the LeBron and Iverson ones. Iverson especially, considering so many nephews try to diminish his greatness by quoting bad efficiency."
**G:** James Harden  **G:** Kawhi Leonard   **F:** Kevin Durant   **F:** Giannis   **C:** Willis Reed
Kevin Durant is good.
I watch a lot of tape. I’m not denying MJs greatness. He is the best player to ever play the game. But fact of the matter is Eras are different. AI got Jordan with his signature cross over. Imagine Jordan having to Guard any dribble move from Kyrie. Or a 7ft Kevin durant pulling up from the logo. Different eras...
Dude put Tim Duncan and Kevin Durant over Kobe. Big fucking yikes 😂
Chris Paul-Magic Johnson-Kevin Durant-Duncan-Anthony Davis.
"Your team is close to the team I would pick.  Here's my list (with some sample single season stats):  Wilt Chamberlain: 50.4 ppg, 50.9 fg%, 27.2 rpg, 2.4 apg  Tim Duncan: 25.5 ppg, 50.8 fg%, 12.7 rpg, 3.7 apg  Kevin Durant: 28.1 ppg, 51.0 fg%, 41.6 3pt%, 7.9 rpg, 5.5 apg  Oscar Robertson: 30.8 ppg, 47.8 fg%, 12.5 rpg, 11.4 apg  Steph Curry: 30.1 ppg, 50.4 fg%, 45.4% 3pt%, 5.4 rpg, 6.7 apg"
"Jerry West, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird, Kevin Garnett, Hakeem Olajuwon.   We got elite shooting, elite passing, elite rim protection, and they would have amazing chemistry."
Kevin fucking Durant. Two straight ships after signing. Shaq had growing pains for years before winning in 2000.
"This is super fun.   The Dream Tim Duncan Kevin Durant Larry Bird Curry   The way to beat this team is to win with shooting and contain the damage Shaq brings. If I can bring great, smart team defenders along with three of the greatest shooters / scorers of all time, I'm taking that."
".....if you don’t think Curry is good then I don’t think we can see eye to eye here.   This team has Kevin Durant and Hakeem Olajuwon on it. I’m not sure why you’re focused on Curry playing iso ball. Most of his possessions will be initiated in the P&amp;R, transition and off screens off ball."
"I'd counter this with (assuming everyone is in their prime) : 1. Steph Curry 2. James Harden  3. Kevin Durant 4. Tim Duncan 5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Nikola Jokic.   All non-selfish players (yes, even Harden).   Steph is super flexible. Can play off the ball, can keep his defender busy while he runs around, insanely quick release with great range on his shot. Very accurate shooter.   James Harden can take damn near anyone off the dribble and no one's blocking his step back.   KD can shoot over anyone with high accuracy. Has experience playing in a system and taking the lead on scoring. He's also Lebron's Worst matchup defensively.   Tim Duncan has taken championships against half this roster. He's their antichrist. Very efficient in and around the paint. Very good at gaining and maintaining position. Great play maker.    The #5 was difficult. Since Timmy lacks range I'm not sure it would be smart to stay with a traditional Center and limit the spacing on their offense. I picked Kareem because he can shoot over anyone with that legendary hook shot. Like... Anyone. Don't matter how much Shaq tries to bully him, Kareem can shoot right over him. Plus he'd really be able to keep up in a hurry up offense while I can see Shaq huffing and puffing a few rounds up and down the court.   Some other players I really considered were:   1. Scottie Pippen (long / great defender)  2. Tony Allen ( amazing defensively. Can guard multiple positions)  3. Nikola Jokic (although I can see Shaq having an offensive field day against him on offense)   4. Giannis A. (Giannis while having only one defender on him is a huge advantage on offense since he's agile and has great footwork)   5. Hakeem Olajuwon (he's just an overall great / smart player and defender)  6. Magic Johnson just to keep the height advantage completely on their side and cuz he's possibly the greatest PG ever. Very tough call between him and Steph but would need the extra space inside the perimeter for Timmy and Kareem to operate."
"* ***Centre:*** **Wilt**. Shaq can do whatever damage he wants on the offensive end, but he was never a great defender against opposing big men. Wilt would get what he wanted. **Hakeem** would also work, and would give you league-leading defense.  * ***PF:*** **Tim Duncan**, or politely ask **Kareem** to take the spot. At this point, you have twin towers to neuter Shaq (see: Spurs sweeping the Lakers in 1999)  * ***SF:*** **Kevin Durant**. Reduce his scoring volume to an efficient 25ppg while adding the rim protection that he added while on the Warriors  * ***SG:*** I'm divided between 2006 **Dwyane Wade** or 1990-1992 **Clyde Drexler**. Wade was the better slasher, but Drexler was bigger, and still had quicker hands (averaged 2.7 steals/game one season)  * ***PG:*** I'm really stuck on this one, but I'd want a proper floor general + defender, so either **Gary Payton, John Stockton**, or **Isiah Thomas**. Taking Magic Johnson would mean a team of giants (which would probably still work). Steph Curry would get bodied in this series."
"Magic Johnson, Steph Curry, Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Wilt"
"Harden was definitely better. 17/4/4 on **66**% TS% is easily better than what CJ is doing  Oh, and Kevin durant was there too. Nbd"
"Pg:  Steph Curry-   You neutralize their backcourt with Stephs long distance range, his off the ball movement and selflessness yet immense offensive potential is a good fit against a team like this.  Steph can match up with AI.    SG:  Scottie Pippen.  Not his natural position, but with the opposing team having the two best shooting guards ever to play the game, the best move on this team is to get someone who can stop them, while being the all around “Lebron” this team needs.  Pippen knows more about Jordans game than anyone.    SF:  Kevin Durant.  May have some matchup problems with Jordan/Kobe at the 3, but he’s an immensely tough offensive matchup and arguably the 3rd best scorer of all time.    He is a clutch player and can shoot from anywhere.  Kobe or Jordan would not be able to stop him defensively.    PF:  Anthony Davis. This may be controversial, but I’m taking Anthony Davis at PF.  I thought about trying to get Karl Malone in here but he’s a matchup problem for Shaqs team.  AD is a defensive powerhouse who can shoot the three and continue to stretch the floor.  I think the best chance against Shaqs team is to hit them with defense and outside shooting, and AD fits perfect.    C:   Hakeem Olajuwon.  Hakeem in prime had one of the most impressive runs ever in a playoffs and his footwork would get Shaq in foul trouble early and cripple their lineup.  Added bonus Hakeem can keep up with Shaq defensively, and is a no brainer center pick for an opposing squad."
Dirk and LeBron don't play the same position. They aren't going up against each other head to head.   Again. Zero wins as the best player. Zero. Nada. None.   He wasn't a better player than KD.  Dame made the WCF by himself lmao. Russ couldn't even get a ring **with James fucking harden and Kevin durant at the same time**  He couldnt even win a single series with **prime paul george**
Here's my team: Stephen Curry (ai)  Kevin Durant (lbj)  Scottie Pippen (mj)  Kareem Abdul Jabbar (Shaq)  Kawhi Leonard (Kobe Bryant)
"Gary Payton, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Reggie Miller, Chris Mullin, Clyde Drexler, Penny Hardaway, Mark Price are just few of the names in the guard position. All of them either HOF or multiple All Stars. Also dont forget  he has to play against players like John Stockton, Kevin Johnson, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and many more. And isnt it more impressive to win in an era dominated by big men?? Especially when the three point line wasnt as widely used????  Here I can make this dumb argument too: Lebron really went to war with which small forward?? Oh  Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Shawn Marion? That's it? Now do you realise how stupid this argument sound???"

"Magic Johnson Kawhi Leonard Scotty Pippen Kevin Durant  Ben Wallace   Size, defense, scoring and low ego high IQ basketball.  Of course you still might lose... at least you have a game plan.    Force them to shoot 3s.  Could even just zone up with the shitty spacing of the MJ squad."
"I'll throw in an underdog team as well. Probably not gonna beat them, but still, could be a fun series.  95-96 Gary Payton  16-17 Kawhi Leonard  17-18 Kevin Durant  01-02 Tim Duncan  64-65 Bill Russell  Backcourt is by far the hardest to fill here imo. I was thinking at PG to go with 07-08 CP3, but idk. I feel like size should be important here.  And SG is just hard as shit to choose. Like who tf can guard MJ? Maybe the Lite version of him haha"
"Steph Curry, Magic Johnson, Kevin Durant, Bird, Kareem"
"1. Kevin Durant 2. Giannis Antetokounmpo  3. Joel Embiid 4. Jimmy Butler 5. Kyrie Irving 6. Jayson Tatum 7. Ben Simmons 8. Kyle Lowry 9. Trae Young 10. Bradley Beal  Assuming KD comes back and does what he does, I’m on the Trae Young hype train so I understand if you don’t agree with him at 9 lol.  Giannis and KD are pretty neck and neck at this point in my opinion"
"Two of those had this guy called Kevin Durant, not sure if you've heard of him. Decent player, can shoot the 3 pretty well."
"https://brobible.com/sports/article/kobe-bryant-kevin-durant-hardest-to-defend/  &gt; Kevin Durant. Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him.  &gt; When he first came into the league, he was easy to defend because he couldn’t go right and shoot. He used to kind of shoot across his face, so that was a weakness that he had. Also in the post, he couldn’t turn left shoulder, everything was right shoulder, so that gave me areas that I could shut off.  &gt; Then he started developing it. And now he can pull up left, he can pull up right, he can shoot the long ball, he has runners, left hand, right hand. Before he had a left hand finish at the rim, I could always send him left, force him all the way to the basket. Even with the advantage of his size, he was still uncomfortable finishing with his left. So I could clamp the right hand and force him in a tough situation.  &gt; But now he developed that. So then I couldn’t really figure out, is this a rhythm thing? I’m trying to count the seconds that he takes to make his move. When does he make them, at what times in the game? I couldn’t really figure out that rhythm.  &gt; So I retired not being able to figure him out.  He didn't stop trying until he retired. But he didn't solve it either."
Nah thats definitely the case https://www.google.com/amp/s/larrybrownsports.com/basketball/kevin-durant-felt-like-outsider-with-warriors/502649%3famp
"If Kevin Durant comes back 100% he's the only one I'd be probably be good with. Lots of people are saying Luka, and I'd be sad, but not disappointed.      Healthy KD, or Luka.      I wouldn't trade for Giannis. AD has just as good, if not better defense (imo) and the ability to stretch.      I don't know about Steph being nearly as powerful as he was before. People are getting used to that style of play. He's still a top player, but I think AD is more important to the makeup of the Lakers team.      Kawhi is like AD but a little worse at shooting, but considerably better at ball handling. And he's a little bit smaller. I don't think there's enough upside with Kawhi to overcome me just liking AD.      I hate how Harden stalls offense. I'm down on him heavy these last two years. I need to see him get back into a system that flows more. Definite no from me with Harden.      No one else even has an argument."
Prime Kevin Durant.
"MODE SWITCHED TO DEMOCRACY   Timeout3 has won the vote, out of timeouts before the 6 minute mark of the first quarter  Oh my god we released Kevin Durant and waived Caris LeVert"
"Also, we’ve seen people like, idk, Kevin frickin’ Durant not even make Sweet Sixteen despite being the best player in the NCAA that year by a mile. Carmelo won the ring mainly because Gerry McNamara made six three pointers in the final game; Kansas would have had them otherwise. Michael Jordan himself only won one title in his three years in college and went to one Final Four. And his freshman team was loaded.  People are tripping. They’ve clearly never watched college basketball if they think Lebron and a bunch of nobodies can win a title."
Pro tip these “new” measurements still aren’t that accurate   Anybody who thinks Kevin Durant is 6’9.5 or whatever they are saying now is fooling themselves. Chris Paul apparently 6’1 now huh? Lmao
"I'm so proud of Russ for getting carried by kevin Durant lmao  Again, how many series has Russ won as the best player on his team?  I'll wait."
Kevin Durant don’t have a grime record
He's not. It's annoying that everyone now just assume the Warriors were supposed to be amazing in 2015. Steve Kerr turned that team into a championship team out of nowhere and no one wants to give him credit because a couple years later they acquired Kevin Durant.
"The press conference hyped up as the decision would be the weakest thing I remember in the NBA, but fortunately Kevin Durant exists"
KD called his decision to join GSW as [the hardest road to a championship.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/07/07/kevin-durant-says-joining-warriors-super-team-is-the-hardest-road/)
What if the ratings just meant people wanted to watch Kevin Durant play?
"When have the Spurs missed on a free agent?  Kevin Durant?  Who else?  LMA was the best free agent that year.  Ever since, they really haven't had the space.    I don't get what youre talking about.  Also the Spurs don't miss the playoffs multiple years in a row.  We aren't the Lakers."
"Kevin Garnett, Kevin Durant, Jokic, Hakeem, Embiid"
"And they lost in the first round in 5 games lol. Russ has had literally zero success without Kevin Durant on his team.  Plus that was one of the flukiest MVPs in history. It pretty much boiled down to ""triple double."" Take away 0.5 rebounds and he wouldn't have had a shot at all.  He wasn't significantly (or at all) better that year than Dame was this year. At the end of the day, it's about expectations. Dame's never had a team good enough to disappoint. We're never expected to go far"
Brooklyn now has 5 Head coaches  Steve Nash  Mike D'Antoni  Ama're Stoudmire   Kyrie Irving  Kevin Durant
"I truly think an offense where Kevin Durant shoots a pull up three every time down the court would be viable, and it would be more like 3 seconds or less."
I’ll hate Kevin Durant forever idc
"Sure okay I’ll address your points if you want to play and if I can assume a good faith argument from you.  1. In regards to Ray Allen. Sure, I agree with you that shopping him and lining up a deal to move him is in bad taste in regards to loyalty, even if that deal fell through. However, for better or worse, he still was part of the Celtics core for half a decade and part of the championship team that was trying to make the finals again. When free agency rolled along, I don’t blame him for wanting to leave after being dangled in trade offers. I wouldn’t blame him for wanting to leave even if he wasn’t in trade offers. Players have the initiative to choose to leave their teams when their contract is up. What I, and many Boston fans do blame him for, is where he left for and the manner in which he did so. He left for the Miami Heat, the team that had beaten us twice in a row in the playoffs. It has been a seven game series in 2012, he was literally one game away from the finals with the Celtics, so they were very much still contending. He chose to leave for the Heat anyways and not only did he choose to leave for the Heat, he took a way smaller contract to do so. The contract he got was 3.3M AAV over three years. The Celtics offered him 6M AAV over two years. That’s a pretty significant pay cut and he took it from the rival team that had just beaten them in a 7 game series in the conference finals. I know the context is different for a lot of reasons, but that is the same action that Kevin Durant took when he left Oklahoma for Golden State. Durant is now considered the ultimate snake for what he did. Obviously the context is different considering Durant was a top two player and hadn’t yet won a chip in Oklahoma. However, from the perspective of the teammates, it is pretty darn similar. Pierce, Garnett, and Rondo saw their teammate quit on them and hop ship for the enemy. Now, Allen had every right to do what he did. I don’t deny that. I don’t think he owed Boston absolute loyalty or anything. He made the decision he wanted to make, and that’s fine. However, doing what he did deservingly draws ire from the city of Boston. Disregarding Ainge for a second. Allen left his teammates and he also left the city of Boston. That is enough to draw their ire and enough to be considered a snake from a Boston sports perspective. You see this kind of reaction from all over the NBA. The Thunder hate Durant for leaving. The Pelicans don’t like Anthony Davis for leaving. The Pacers hate Paul George for leaving. The argument that Allen had already won a chip is also invalidated by the fact that there is lots of precedent for this too. The Spurs don’t like Kawhi for leaving even though he won a ring with them. The Raptors were rooting against him in the playoffs even though he won a ring with them and no one blames him for that. Teams and their fan bases don’t like it when players leave their team. That is a universal truth of sports fandom. When players do so in a particularly bad way, such as Durant or Kawhi with the Spurs, or with Allen, they are deemed snakes by fanbase they left, that’s just part of sports and it’s completely justified.  Also, to address your point about the outcome of Boston’s loyal guys in KG and Pierce, your narrative that they bounced around crappy teams after Ainge booted them is inaccurate. First of all, they were consulted on the trade and were fully okay with it. KG had an actual no trade clause, so it wouldn’t have happened without their say so. Second, they went to Brooklyn which was supposed to be a super team. It just happened to not work out. KG then decided he wanted to wrap up in Minnesota, his first franchise, and he went back there. Pierce was a bit younger and decided to give it another go.....with the Lob City Clippers, a team that was a constant contender, even if they never made it over the hump."
The shit talking alone against Kevin Durant would be a gold mine.
Kevin Durant is just a bigger cheat code than Bird   KD only has 3 playoff runs under 0.2 WS/48   Bird only has 3 playoff runs at or above 0.2 WS/48   KD is simply the better player considering he has been consistently dominant in this modern NBA with the talent floor being elevated significantly since the 80s  Stats don’t lie and rings don’t tell the whole story but even if they did KD made sure the league knew he was the best player on GS when it mattered    KD is a better all time talent than Bird because of his length/scoring ability in the modern 2000s-2010s NBA
"I was actually equating Kevin Durant in the mix of things with the three years he was with the Warriors. Apparently Larry Legend had better teammates that Durant with Curry, Kay, Draymond who not only beat him in the playoffs but won 73 wins the year before he joined them."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2870536-nets-kevin-durant-progressing-fantastically-in-recovery-from-achilles-injury.amp.html  Read it and weep my guy. And this was back in January. Keep praying for his downfall tho, that ain't gonna save your boy next year"
"This one reporter harmed Cleveland more than Steve Kerr, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant *combined*"
Kevin Durant testing the market episode and the nets episode when everyone is hoping to get traded.
Ok? He’s still not a *better player* then Kevin Durant. Bird only beats him in playmaking which isn’t even a weakness for prime Durant. It doesn’t make any sense to take Bird over KD when he’s better at everything else and has dominated the greatest pool of basketball talent in history.
"He still wouldn’t be better then Kevin Durant. Durant as a player model shouldn’t even exist. He’s a 6’11 wing who has handles, is an all time great 3 level scorer and is a freak athlete which people often forget. In OKC/GSW he proved he could be a defensive force as well, with his perimeter defense being solid and being at times an elite weak side shot blocker and rim protector.   I’d argue he is a better scorer, shooter, athlete and defender. Bird just beats him in playmaking which Durant proved is not a weakness if he has any semblance of spacing around him. Durant’s talents are so surreal he could’ve been in GOAT talks had his career/peak coincided with LeBron James."
"This, and you also have the problem that the only players who are really worth the supermax -- like LeBron, Kevin Durant, AD -- don't need it because they can still make more money by going to other markets because of endorsements etc.   So the only players who really want the supermax are the ones who aren't quite worth it. It's a shitty situation for these teams regardless."
"*the sun has set on Phoenix, now a new sun rises in Brooklyn, as the prodigal sons work with dad to renew a franchise starring Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving*"
"MDA, Nash, and STAT coaching the Kevin Durant ancestry Kyrie. What a time to be alive."
"I read your comment dude. Im just being purposely facetious to show thats its a silly assertion. Being ignorant about how stats work or how much value Daryl Morey adds has nothing to do with how much ball you've played. Kevin Durant literally said he doesnt like using TS% and using FG% is more accurate, is that an indictment on the knowledge of all ball players?  That's why I put that comment in reverse because  its easily just as ridiculous to say ""the more ball you play, the more you realize how stupid Morey ball is."""
"Its insane that People defend Magic while watching only highlights for hours. Also Curry was without a doubt, the Best on the Warriors with Kevin Durant on them. Every stat reflects that."
"I am also not a fan of Kevin Durant, not really because of him or his personality..  It's just he really is so good at the game but his skin is so thin.  I don't remember many players ever playing at his level..  I actually stopped watching basketball when the superwarriors were formed.  It felt pointless for him to go there.. and then talk shit after leaving.. like winning a championship must feel good.. but as a fan of the game, I was so disappointed.  How are they gonna block Chris Paul to the Lakers but let Kevin Durant join..  they formed the fucking Ginyu force and it wasn't for the love of the game.   The move actually made me quit watching basketball until it was clear that the super-super teams were wearing down.  My only regret is I missed Lebron's Cav's championship, the block, and the three by kyrie.  Now that the league is so balanced with good teams having solid rosters with 2 stars +1 excellent player.. It makes the game mean more to me."
"Yeah, nobody would've thought he could end up with the offensive rebound over Kevin Durant"
It’s not awful besides having Kevin wank ass Durant in there
"Exactly, just need Wiggins to be a solid Harrison Barnes, not a Kevin Durant. I believe that’s achievable for him in our team."
"You'd surprisingly be incorrect!  [Emmanuels](https://www.basketball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?hint=emmanuel+Mudiay&amp;search=emmanuel): Chris Paul, Bradley Beal and Jeremy Lamb  [Theodore](https://www.basketball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?search=theodore): Tim Duncan, Bill Walton and Blue Edwards  [Wayne](https://www.basketball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?hint=wayne+Embry&amp;search=wayne): Kevin Durant, Reggie Miller, Jack Sikma/Dennis Johnson  [Edward](https://www.basketball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?search=edward): James Harden, Kevin McHale, Chris Webber/Mo Cheeks  [Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?search=anthony): Kawhi Leonard, Karl Malone, Paul Pierce"
Curry averaged 37ppg and holds the record for most points in a sweep against Damian Lillard and without Kevin Durant and some people have the audacity to pick Dame over Steph.   Or better yet...  #IGUODALA
"I thought he was fine in 2018. Only averaged 16 but did it pretty efficiently, which is to be expected when Durant and Steph are soaking up a lot of possessions. He was aite in 2017, important defensive player and some supporting points, same story. 2016 — doesn’t ring a bell. Were we in the playoffs in 2016? Def got outshadowed by Andre in 15. He’s kinda hard to evaluate in the KD years since he feeds off rhythm and he seems to get less of that as we go deeper into the playoffs with how Kevin plays."
"Kevin Durant, Super Sonics"
"My over 30 team would be:  PG: Lebron James SG: Klay Thompson SF: Kevin Durant PF: Blake Griffin C: Serge Ibaka  It's not that I don't think Curry and Harden aren't better than some of my picks, but I think this team fits together better in terms of defense and offensive flow."
"if you're going to nitpick every poor play of a star player in the league you can basically be here forever. losing a series against Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when the rest of your roster is very old, ok, not that big a deal. blowing a 3-1 lead with one of the better roster's in the nba? Big deal"
"Exactly. Its why the Warriors with Kevin Durant were so deadly. After a while all this cute little movements and screens can be defended, so you just say fuck it and give it KD on the elbow or the perimeter."
Kevin Durant LeBron James And of course Blake griffin because he's obviously going to be the next evolution of Rick fox.
Yeah the reason they didn't retain Harrison Barnes was Kevin fucking Durant lol. Not exactly something to hold against a player that they're not as good as KD.
"Part of his reasoning, from the Game Theory podcast, is that Curry's injury + Curry's age + Curry not showing he can carry a team since 2016 (which isn't his fault, just something that happens when a team adds Kevin Durant) are the reasons he's bumped to 1b, but being a 1b player doesn't mean he won't be 1a next season, he just have to prove he can do it"
I thought kevin durant wasn't good unless hes with steph curry to take all of the pressure off of him.
Because he got outplayed by fucking kevin durant. LeBron got outplayed by jason terry.   Also why don't you put Lebron's averages and shooting splits as well. Man has 8 points in a finals game.
"Only like 4-5 teams have the cap space to sign Fournier to a comparable deal to his current contract and most of them aren’t logical fits.  I think the main reason Golden State didn’t retain Barnes was that they signed Kevin Durant that offseason. But who knows, maybe they let him walk either way.  Most people - meaning league insiders and analysts - expect Fournier to either opt in to his deal or opt out and sign and new deal with the Magic. He’s unlikely to opt out and go anywhere else."
"Um Klay thompson, damian lillard, Kevin durant, Steph curry would all like a word"
For me ( NO ORDER YET)  1. Michael Jordan 2. Lebron James 3. Kareem Abdoul Jabbar 4. Bill Russell 5. Magic Johnson 6. Hakeem Olajuwon 7. Larry Bird 8. Wilt Chamberlain 9. Tim Duncan 10. Shaq 11. Kevin Durant 12. Stephen Curry 13. Kevin Mchale 14. Dirk Nowitzki 15. Isaiah Thomas 16. Patrick Ewing 17. David Robinson 18. Kobe Bryant  19. Dwyane Wade 20. Allen Iverson 21. Dr. J 22.

Kevin Durant may have a shot. He’s had some pretty good investments.
“Just catch and shoot” MPJ was the next Kevin Durant when a prospect.
"&gt; Porter Jr. is perhaps the best wing/combo-forward scoring prospect to enter the draft since Kevin Durant a decade ago  — Cole Zwicker    &gt;Michael Porter Jr. could be a generational talent, and he’ll only be at the college level for one year.   — Ricky O'Donnell    &gt;We did plenty of work in the preseason to explain the forthcoming impact of a player like Porter Jr. He’s the kind of generational talent who rarely goes to a school like Missouri.  &gt;In previous pieces he was compared to Kevin Durant, Dwight Howard, Andrew Wiggins, and LeBron James because it’s a short list of players who achieved 100.0 rating on 247sports.   — Sam Snelling"
Oh man remember when they made that movie about Kevin Durant and some white kid
PG: Steve Nash  SG: Vince Carter  SF: Rick Barry  PF: Kevin Durant  C: Tim Duncan  not bad
Kevin Durant - hiding tattoos
"&gt; I think the problem is that this premise is fundamentally flawed because it ignores the ability for teams to develop their assets and focuses only on draft capital.  the premise is drafting a great player is how you win.  from 1980 to 2010, the seven best players who had most of their primes in those years were bird, magic, jordan, hakeem, shaq, duncan, and kobe.  teams led by those guys won 25 of 31 titles (not even including shaq in miami).  and then dallas won with a guy they drafted in dirk.  getting ""that guy"" is how you win.  the way those guys were acquired were draft (x6) and being the los angeles lakers (x2).  if you aren't the lakers, you better get to drafting.  that hasn't been as true the last decade now that players move around in free agency so much.  now it's be the team that signed lebron or kevin durant (6 titles, would've been 7 without durant hurt).  but if you aren't a prime FA destination, drafting a great player is still the most sure way to have an all-time great."
"Most impressive part of this for Hou was probably them winning despite a horrible showing from Harden.   Also this game reminds me of something Ive said for yrs that these 1 day rest conference finals set ups are stupid. And this was the series where it clearly showed 1 game rest game 3-7 with what's basically near a 4 hour flight between San Francisco and Houston. And it clearly affected the product. Game 4 Hou completely no showed the start and needed to rally. This game, game 5 both teams were sluggish as hell to start it was just a mess. Game 6 the Warriors came out flat as hell. Game 7 again more of that sluggish shit early on. Good defense yes, but in a grind of a series you are just piling on with this set up.   Defensively this game was a classic ex of how the Warriors with KD Hou actually tended to have more success defending than GSW without KD. All that switching was intended to stagnate opposing offenses and induce isolation which that's what Kevin Durant wants to do and he's one of the best in NBA history at it. But by getting them to take that bait it got away from orienting the offense through Steph and quick actions which is what gave Hou more problems. Proof was in the pudding GSW when they had a big KD game and bad Steph game---very average. Big Steph poor KD game----still unbeatable(although they got neither in this one)"
"One thing I never see mentioned in these talks is about the potential cap impact on the 2022 free agency class.     Let’s assume they dropped the cap to 90 million.  Also assume that the shortened covid 2021 season will see a similar drop in revenue and the cap will hold steady.  What happens in the season after that, assuming a vaccine is out, and the normal season restarts as well as the economy bumps up.  Suddenly, the cap increases back to $119?   Suddenly, teams have another $29 million to cram in a superstar free agent a la GSW and Kevin Durant?   I’m pretty sure nba teams will not want a repeat of that particular debacle."
No one worth listening to thinks Steph Curry is better then Kevin Durant.
"&gt; I think many casual Jazz fans just didn't really understand that you can't just throw money at a team and win a championship, it's not that simple (look at the Nets and Prokhorov years ago)  I think it depends on how you're throwing the money. Spending on old Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett? No chance in hell. Spending on prime Steph Curry and Kevin Durant has been pretty well proven to win titles."
"Yeah I mean I don’t particularly like the guy and I rooted like hell against that warriors team but goddamn Kevin Durant is an absolutely incredible basketball player. I think the general opinion of KD would be much different if we didn’t have LeBron to compare him against. KD might be the second best pure scorer ever, behind MJ. And he’s almost certainly the most well rounded scorer we’ve ever seen."
"This is another example of a Lebron-stan just riled up and ready to attack any perceived slight on Lebron.  Re-read my entire comment and the context to which I am arguing, and let me know which part of my comment is framing this as an attack at Lebron or portraying it in a negative light.  It is simply a statement of fact. If you think that fact is positive or negative, that is on you, not a reflection on how I was portraying him positively or negatively.  It is very frustrating to go on r/nba and seek actual insight and discussion and instead be hit with stans rallying to ""defend"" *perceived* slights as opposed to actual arguments.  To reiterate. Go re-read what I wrote again and pinpoint the exact part where I'm arguing that Lebron leaving teams unable to make the playoffs is a **negative** thing. Go. Do it. And be bold enough to admit your wrong when you don't find anything there.  Your ""defence"" is even more hilarious since I cheered for the Cavs every year they faced the Warriors from 2015-2018, and I too, consider the 3-1 comeback win in the 3-1 Finals against the 73-9 Warriors as the best carry job I've witnessed (I've heard others say the 1995 Rockets were also stupendous, but I wasn't able to witness that, so I can't comment). I absolutely **despised** Kevin Durant's act of joining the Warriors and making the Finals non-competitive, because I really enjoyed watching the Warriors prior to Durant, and although the Warriors were a great basketball team to watch, I hated the non-competitive aspect of it.  But you would've never known any of that, as a Lebron-stan, because you're too focused on attacking perceived slights.  I may sound callous, but you haven't shown me sufficient reading comprehension and grace either, so I'm just firing off. You need to read more carefully before commenting."

Kevin Durant
So the rumours were true. The Nets did want to build a big 3. And they've succeeded.  Kevin Durant. Kyrie Irving. Bruce Brown.  The league is doomed.
"We've never seen a player be the same after this injury, but on the other hand, no player as good as Kevin Durant has ever suffered that injury. So it's really hard to know what will happen."
They weren't even that good (record-wise) after adding Kevin Durant
"Imagine calling a team with James Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving a bad team..."
"Look at this delusional homer, I bet he actually believes the Nets could get stars like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving."
He's even got special guest appearances from Kevin Durant.
I think it goes like this:  1.) Lebron 2.) Kevin Durant  3.) Steph Curry 4.) Anthony Davis 5.) Kawhi Leonard 6.) Giannis  7.) Harden 8.) Jokic  9.) Luka  10.) Butler   Butler may be too low.
"Man, they really misspelled Kevin Durant here.  But seriously, why????? Brown is solid (definitely not spectacular), young, and cheap. I can't handle more years of giving up our only decent prospects (i.e. Middleton, Dinwiddie)"
It's not Kevin Durant that they are adding. I can imagine the anger if they added someone like Giannis or Harden though.
"Don’t listen to the comments before me. Support the Milwaukee Bucks. They are the team that will get your hopes up so high just to have it come crashing down.   I’m kidding, yeah follow the Nets. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are always exciting to watch."

Kevin Durant
"Ahhh no. Kevin Durant, the finals MVP, was the best player on that team."
Because it has Kevin Durant on it.  Insane to think of them being on the same team.
"It was more effective for the Clippers because of their personnel. If you have Chris Paul you don’t run a motion offense. Same thing with LeBron. If you have Steph Curry and Klay Thompson you do. The Warriors personnel is perfectly suited for a motion offense, which is why they immediately started dominating once Kerr installed it upon taking over prior to the 2014-15 season. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are perfect players for this offense. Kevin Durant is too, which is why he found Golden State so appealing."
Replacing Kevin Durant with andrew wiggins was light years ahead
Because his lifelong dream has been to play with close friend Kevin Durant on the Brooklyn Nets
"Nah that’s a misconception, Perkins was making 7mil per and Harden wanted 15. They still would have been over the tax line without Perkins and they would also have to start Hasheem Thabeet at centre. Perkins was actually an important piece for the Thunder back then, this was when Dwight and Bynum were still dominant, the 3 point revolution hadn’t happened yet and paint clogging bigs were important.  The tax line was 70 mil and by keeping Perkins and trading Harden they ended up at 69 mil.   The owners were actually ok with paying the tax eventually, but the were baulking at the repeater tax. The repeater tax had just been brought in in 2011 and they were scared of it. If you were in the tax for 3 of the last 4 seasons the tax you have to pay is boosted to 275%.  They wanted to collect a few more pieces and go all in all at once to minimise the number of seasons they were over the tax line. Giving Harden the max would put them over the tax line early, and with Durant and Westbrook along with Ibaka getting max or near max deals also, they were going to stay over the tax line for years to come.  They did choose Ibaka over Harden, because they thought Westbrook and Durant had such a high usage that Hardens role in that offense had a ceiling to it, and they thought they could replace Hardens 6th man minutes with someone cheaper, which to be fair they did for one season in Kevin Martin. Ibaka offered something different on the defensive end so they went with him.   Perkins was a red herring. People got annoyed that they didn’t amnesty him after he quickly became obselete, but that wouldn’t have really achieved anything"
"They don't call him Dennis ""Literally Kevin Durant in his Prime"" Schroeder for nothing"
That is some awful commentating right there. “I am the best... Kevin Durant!” Rucker needs a new hype man.
"You mean the series he casually outscored Kevin Durant and averaged 31/5/3? The series in which he dropped 36/7/6 with 14 PTS in the fourth quarter in the only Lakers win and had 42 PTS on 18-33 FG in the closeout Game 5? Also had a casual 38/8/5 in Game 4, but whatever.  I swear, LeBron stans in this sub  are the worst."
.......... the LeBron Heat are playing against the Kevin Durant OKC team ........
"Kevin ""I am the best"" Durant"
Not a big man but feels wrong to not describe kevin durant as a unicorn
Brandon Ingram Kevin Durant
Where is the Kevin Durant? He couldn’t even bench 185 lbs at the combine.
Kevin Durant can do everything and is freaken 7ft tall with a long ass wingspan hitting 3s.
"So, they can develop for another two years and still have the same bad culture. Maybe they're just doomed in this phase unless you think they're young to eventually one day land on a Kevin Durant in the draft or something."
Kevin Durant.
Carmelo Anthony because I never liked his style of play. His whole career he cared more about stats and money than about winning.   Kevin Durant because I’m still mad about him ruining the league for three years and about his 2 rings and 2 FMVPs on rookie difficulty. I hope he never win again so his legacy will be being TOP 5 player of his time who couldn’t win without joining a superteam.
That's because he didn't play with any great players. We're talking about Kevin Durant here. Of course you put money on a duo like that.
"A source is telling me that the Rockets have engaged in talks with the Nets. Kevin Durant for a variation of: PJ Tucker, Eric Gordon, Danuel House, and Chris Clemons. Nothing finalized, but Durant to the Rockets seems like a real possibility. If finalized, announced on Nov 22."
"Three main things  1. Whenever this discussion comes up people immediately bring up that Wade was a better defender (as seen in these comments) but I feel like Harden's offensive advantage is pretty under discussed. Wade was a really good offensive player but Harden is genuinely in that Michael Jordan/Lebron James/Kevin Durant tier of tippy top all time great offensive pantheon. Three straight scoring titles, an assist title, 29.6 PPG/7.7 APG across 8 years in Houston.  2. The playoff success argument would look a lot different without Harden facing the Warriors every year. I figure he makes the finals in 2015, 2018, and 2019 and wins one in 2018. With that, the argument goes from ""Wade was more successful in the playoffs"" to ""Wade won more titles but Harden could have won more too if he had prime Lebron next to him.""   3. Harden's longevity+consistency. 6 first team all-nba's and 5 top 3 MVP finishes between 2014 and 2020. Wade missed a lot of time during his prime due to injuries and only had a few complete elite seasons."
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Ben Simmons, James Harden, Marcus Morris, Paul George, Draymond Green"
Kevin durant before 2016
"What?  2013- 6th seed Warriors upset the 3rd seed Nuggets, Curry averaged 24/4/9 on 62% TS  2014- Took the Lob City Clippers as a 6th seed to 7 games, scored 33 points in game 7, with 14 in the 4th quarter, and lost by only 5 points   2015- Curry in the WCF averaged 31ppg on 68% TS(!!!) against who many people said got robbed of MVP, James Harden, also averaged 28 on 49/45/86 splits the last 3 games if the Finals after being down 1-2 against the Cavs, including 37 points in a crucial game 5 to go up 3-2  2016- Curry rushed back from injury off the bench against Portland scored 40 points on 60% TS and 17 points in overtime, a playoff record. Also averaged 33/7/7 on 47/47/91 the last 3 games in the WCF coming back from 1-3 deficit   2017- Warriors as a whole plowed through the playoffs, team was never really in trouble  2018- No crazy moments, but he did play well in games 6 &amp; 7 against the Rockets  2019- Scored 33 points in the 2nd half of Game 6 against the Rockets after being scoreless in the first. And in the WCF, set the record for *most points in a sweep* averaging 37ppg on 66% TS without Kevin Durant.   Curry, like any all time great has bad moments in the playoffs, but like any other all time great has lots of memorable moments."
"Not a college but Oak Hill Academy   PG : Rajon Rondo  SG : Jerry Stackhouse  SF : Kevin Durant  PF : Carmelo Anthony   C: Josh Smith   Notable bench pieces : Brandon Jennings, Rod Strickland, Stephen Jackson, Michael Beasley"
&gt; He has the exactly same career Kevin Durant had before joining Warriors.  When did Harden lead a team to the Finals? I must have missed that.
He has the exactly same career Kevin Durant had before joining Warriors. Also he is losing to championship teams literally every year. I swear you people pretend to hate players forming superteams but then count their rings all the same while putting down guys who want to stay loyal and try to win without switching teams and chasing other superstars.
"There isn't any reason to complain about what Durant did, he was pretty close to flawless in his time in Golden State, and literally every other player benefited from him being there.  You're out here talking about regular season. Didn't the Cavs prove every year that regular season success is irrelevant? How are you still on this. Those teams were always far and away the best teams in the nba because of Kevin Durant. Did you even watch those playoffs? Durant slammed the door on anyone who could slow down Curry, which teams had gotten better at. They would have 3 peated if he didn't get hurt.  Also your stats are just straight up wrong, in 2019 the Warriors had an 11.9 net rating when Durant played, and a -5.1 rating when he was out.   Source: https://www.statsperform.com/resource/analyzing-golden-state-with-and-without-kevin-durant/  Read through that article and try to tell me that Durant didn't make his teammates better. It also shows they were far better on defense with him. They were unstoppable with him on the court.  And then just look at the championships. They easily won a championship with Kevin Durant the year he came to Golden State, even though that Cavs team was even better then they were the year before. The Kyrie/LeBron offense had fully clicked and was absolutely lethal and one of the best in nba history. They got steamrolled.  &gt;It is stupidly obvious that Curry is the motor of the team. The 100% defacto leader.  Again, enough with this story bullshit. Stop trying to read the players minds. Curry and Durant synergized perfectly. Their games fit together like peanut butter and jelly, they played perfect basketball together. Here's what matters: they won.  &gt;Durant can always get a bucket, but it does nothing to help any of his teammates stay in rhythm.  Are you on fucking crack? You seriously don't realize the absolute massive amount of space Durant creates? You don't realize his gravity? His efficiency? His passing and ball handling? His basically perfect offensive game? The gravity he has when the ball isn't in his hands? I'm sorry man but this is honestly one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen on here. Durant makes everyone better, on both ends, and literally every statistic shows it.  &gt;KD's iso game is great for KD. It's not great winning, and it's not great for his teammates.  No dude. Just no. KDs game is great for everyone he plays with, and he elevates any team he's on. I can't help you if you don't see that."
I’m a Westbrook hater but he would instantly make us a ton better and way more watchable. If we were watchable and better a year ago we’d have Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving right now
"Kevin Durant averaged 30-27-28-28 Joel has averaged 20-22-27-23  So I think it’s fair to say Durant was someone who averaged around 30, while not fair to say Joel is “usually a 27.5 ppg scorer"
Kevin Durant
"1. LeBron James   2. Steph Curry   3. Kawhi Leonard  4. James Harden   5. Anthony Davis   6. Luka Doncic   7. Nikola Jokic   8. Giannis Antetokounmpo   9. Damian Lillard   10. Joel Embiid   HM: Jayson Tatum, Jimmy Butler   I think Luka Doncic might be better than Anthony Davis but he’s only played at this level for one season so I gave Davis the benefit of the doubt.   I’m not including Kevin Durant because I have no idea how good he’s gonna be."
"Harden can win in the playoffs. He had a better team than more than half of chanpionship teams in history in 2018 and was up 3-2 on a 73 win/back to back finals, title winning team that added Kevin Durant before his co star got injured    Harden can win in the playoffs you doofus"
**KEVIN LOVE LEGALLY CHANGES LAST NAME TO DURANT IN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO TRICK NBA EXECS**
"Assuming you can't use the players he selected, it's hard to beat. Something like Magic Johnson, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Larry Bird, Kareem would be good but that team is really good."
"Keep in mind that Kevin Durant championed iso ball as the best way to play in OKC, even calling Kawhi a ""system player"" who needed to rely on ball movement, before saying he'd always **truly** wanted to play in a freeflowing system like Golden State's when he signed there. We ate it up. Then he decided even dominating in that new, liberated system was not so fulfilling, and forged a path back to heroball heaven with Kyrie in Brooklyn. Take all of these kind of sentiments from frustrated players with a grain of salt."
Eye test don't hold much weight in comparison to statistics. Their scoring is nearly identical during RS + Playoffs. The fact Harden is matching KD's numbers despite his buckets is waaaaaay less assisted gives him the edge.  -----   #James Harden (2012-2020)  **Regular season**  29.6 PPG on 61.2 TS% (15.4% of 2Ps &amp; 34.0% of 3Ps assisted)   **Playoffs**  28.4 PPG on 57.8 TS% (15.0% of 2Ps &amp; 30.8% of 3Ps assisted)  -------  #Kevin Durant (2010-2016)   **Regular season**  28.9 PPG on 62.1 TS% (49.2% of 2Ps &amp; 74.9% of 3Ps assisted)  **Playoffs**  28.9 PPG on 57.5 TS% (46.2% of 2Ps &amp; 73.9% of 3Ps assisted)
Kevin Durant was right about Westbrook.. I think we should owe him an apology
"Okay, I generally don't like to dislike or discount prospects before they even have a chance to prove themselves but Pokusevski might be my least favorite first-round prospect in the past three years.   First of all, let's talk about his physical profile. He is 7' tall with a 7'3"" wingspan. Great on paper. Couple that with the fact that he can move pretty darn well on the court, perfect build for a modern center. Wait hold on, he's not a center. In fact, I don't really know what he is, I guess a power forward? Anyways, this man is skinny, a total stickman. Think Bol Bol if he lost a ton of weight. He is not going to be able to play center as he is way too weak to be able to operate in the post on offense or defense. He is a perimeter player through and through. Now the usual answer for a tall player who is too skinny to hold down the paint is to gain weight. Unfortunately, this is unlikely given the fact that he has a very skinny frame, which is different from just being skinny. Usually, when a player has a larger frame, they are able to pack on more weight and muscle. Think Giannis. Pokusevski does not have a large frame like Giannis or Jokic or most 7 footers with special talents. Now, there are a few exceptions in regards to tall guys with skinny frames who were able to succeed. Most notably, Kevin Durant and Kristaps Porzingis. Unfortunately, Pokusevski does not compare well to them at all, which I will address in the next section.  Now, we are gonna talk about Pokusevski's offense. Most importantly, he doesn't really do anything well. The man shoots 40% from 2, which is not good for someone who is theoretically tall enough to play very efficient basketball. However, it makes sense when you consider that half his shots come from 3. He takes 4.4 3s a game at a 32% clip. That is an awful percentage for someone who takes literally half his shots from beyond the arc and a huge reason why he plays inefficient basketball. He did shoot 78% from the free-throw line, so his shot is definitely salvageable, but it is still unlikely that he becomes an elite shooter or even a good shooter for that matter. At best, he will be an average to slightly above-average shooter. Also, given the fact that he is not a good shooter at the moment yet takes a ton of threes creates concern over his shot selection and also reflects his inability to score inside the arc. Pokusevski's handle is solid for his size but far too often does he look out of control when handling on the inside and this often leads to poor decision-making. While he does have some natural passing talent, he only averaged 2.8 APG (4.8 per36). That isn't particularly good for someone drawing Jokic comparisons. This leads me back to the Durant and Porzingis comparisons I mentioned in the last section. Durant and Porzingis stand out as special talents due to the skill they possess at their size. Both are incredible offensive talents for this combination of skill and size. While Pokusevski has the size, he really doesn't have the skill in any facet of his offensive game. Without major improvements in pretty much every area, he is going to have a hard time contributing offensively.  The defensive end is a lot easier to analyze. Pokusevski is too laterally slow to guard the perimeter and too weak to guard the post. Sure, he can block the occasional shot, but so can anyone with that wingspan. In any case, he is going to find it very difficult to not be a defensive liability in the NBA.  Last, I want to address the level of competition that he has been playing in. Pokusevski plays in the Greek second league. For anyone who doesn't want to bother watching extensive footage, and I don't blame you, the Greek second league appears to be a bunch of semi-skilled white guys playing in stadiums the size of a high school gym. The competition is quite simply, not good. When watching footage, Pokusevski cannot even stand out as the best player on the court. Given that he doesn't shine amongst the not-very-shiny competition, he is going to have a horrible time adjusting to NBA competition.  Look, I hope he can prove me wrong one day. There is definitely a path to the NBA for him. Unfortunately, it is going to take gaining weight, improving shooting, tightening his handle, improving his strength, improving his touch, improving his finishing, improving his lateral movement, improving his defensive IQ, improving his offensive IQ, and improving his shot selection. That is pretty much everything that he needs to improve. I know the allure of a tall talented big can be a lot but without major improvements to pretty much everything in his game, he is not an NBA-level player and it will be very difficult for him to become one."
The last time Kevin Durant played basketball was a year and a half ago.  I can see Steph but putting KD on any active NBA player ranking just seems ridiculous.  He hasn't actively played in 1.5 years.
Rondo shot at a higher percentage from 3 last year than Kevin Durant.  Not saying he’s a better 3 point shooter than KD but this isn’t a sudden 1 year change for him
something about kevin durant just getting an “o” on the end and an accent above the e is hilarious
"LeBron James exhibited what's unanimously considered his greatest offensive play-off run against the Golden State Warriors led by Kevin Durant and the most feared shooting duo in NBA history according to those who live and breathe the game. Was James LeBron, by your own definition, dominated by Kevin Durant in a vacuum(?), as Isiah mistakenly  claims he did to an evidently superior performer. Would it make sense for Kevin Durant to boast about dominating LeBron?"
"The nets and clippers are great examples of how being semi relevant is more attractive than tanking every single year. Free agents notice. Kevin Durant noticed, all I’m saying is getting to the playoffs at least puts you on the map rather than hoping to lose cause you can’t guarantee a number 1 pick either way"
https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/why-kevin-durant-believes-he-never-fit-his-warriors-teammates  He did explicitly say that he felt bad because he wasn't loved enough.
"Kd has absolutely never been better than bron.   There’s no precedent for winning fmvp on a losing team in the modern age. But yes of course lebron was the best player on the floor, he has been in pretty much every series he’s played in since 2007 minus the 2011 finals and maybe against the blazers this year lmao.   He’s undoubtedly the single greatest shooter ever. This hasn’t been arguable since 2016. I never said he could carry a team like lebron. He isn’t as good as lebron. He won a title as unequivocally the best player on the team. He won two more where teams prioritized him over kd defensively. Part of that is because he’s smaller, but it still says something when teams are more worried about you than Kevin Durant."
"&gt; The Nets’ regular season average audience size bumped up a couple extra percentage points (**44.34%**), increasing to 1.19 million.    &gt;   &gt;The average audience size of those watching the Knicks in 2019-20 was [330K](https://netswire.usatoday.com/2020/10/29/nets-crush-knicks-average-2019-20-tv-rating-nba-top-10-kevin-durant/)— down **67.02%** from the previous season.  🤔"
"Bc iggy robbed him and then he played with Kevin Durant lol.   I’m not overhyping him. His competition is big o, cp3, zeke, and Stockton. Steph is better than all of them. He’s the only guy that I’ve ever genuinely thought might be better than lebron at any point since like 2011, realistically since about 2008 though.   I was wrong about that, but his 2016 season is up there with the greatest seasons ever. The fact that it even made sense in the middle of lebrons era is crazy."
Rockets were pretty healthy in 2019 but they couldn't get past a Golden State team missing their best player in Kevin Durant  Also Dwight's been healthy in many post seasons with Harden
Kevin Durant is obviously LeBrons little brother
Like Kyrie and Kevin Durant obv while they win the lottery for Zion
"Kevin Durant is definitely a Karen already. I can see his and Kyrie's asses at some trendy coffee house ordering pumpkin spice macchiatos with extra foam and then complaining that there isn't enough foam, Bill Williamson from Rampage style."
"https://www.nbadraft.net/players/kevin-durant/  His defence was only rated 7/10 which is very low for a top 2 pick.   Also   &gt;Weaknesses: Defensively, he’s very lax. Tends to be too upright, and should focus more on his defensive fundamentals, getting low in his defensive stance, especially on the perimeter … Has all the potential to be a lock down defender, but doesn’t put the effort in on that side of the ball … Still needs to bulk up, although he has bulked up significantly since high school. May always be skinny and adding too much weight could slow his foot speed some"

"What else would you like to measure a team by?  The warriors are the biggest puzzle the league has spit out in ages--the fact the rockets had answers to that puzzle was *not* a pure 1 to 1 matchup solution, unless you believe james harden vs kevin durant is a favorable matchup?  I admit I don't really follow what you mean by this ""don't measure teams by matchups"" thing, as if that's somehow not a good way to measure how much talent a team has."
You really think Westbrook would do something like that? Last I checked his name is not Kevin Durant
"People complain about trades all the time, just like they complain about loyalty when players leave.  You think I was happy when Harden was traded and Kevin Durant left for GSW?   It's circumstantial not just black and white."
"Magic Johnson Tracy McGrady Kevin Durant DeMarcus Cousins Chris Webber   Magic, McGrady &amp; Durant could switch all day on defense and still be about the same with the height and length.   DeMarcus would be there for Shaq. He's the only center that could really challenge him on offense and defense. DeMarcus has the size and speed to make Shaq work for it on both ends. Then Webber is the added bonus, he can shoot, rebound defend and he would take advantage of whoever isn't Shaq guarding him.   Or maybe even Yao."
Steph Curry  Magic Johnson  Larry Bird  Kevin Durant  Kareem Abdul Jabbar
Steph Curry  Kawhi Leonard  Larry Bird  Kevin Durant  Hakeem Olajuwon
"Steph Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kevin Garnett, Wilt Chamberlain"
"The warriors were a top team because they had kevin durant and a somewhat decent draymond green, two things that they don't have now. The rest of that team is older and worse now than two years ago.   Your next point is equally as moot because there was a clear talent difference between the lakers and the heat- the lakers were one of the three best teams in basketball and have been since they traded for ad (ppl held them, lac, or the bucks as the favorites in the beginning of the year). The heat massively overachieved expectations held by the casual fan, and we're simply overmatched by the la machine. The nets are honestly an unknown at this point, but I can foresee the kyrie plus kd pairing working out or failing spectacularly- neither surprise me.   Yes, the lakers did lose rondo- astute observation- but hes a marginal loss considering the expected development of caruso and other players. There are rooms for improvement with Danny green and kuzma in particular, but please don't compare the improvements needed by the warriors and the lakers. One team has the potential to be competitive for 3 more years at least and the other one just concluded the most dominant stretch of play in recent history.   The series u refer to when talking about AD is hardly relevant considering the shape of both rosters. The warriors are no longer a 73 win juggernaut and AD is no longer stuck on that shitty pels team.   The duos are both great, but it's clear imo that one team outmatches the other."
Kevin Durant is such a Karen. IDK how I didn't realize this.
"I'm talking about the fact that when he doesn't have Kevin Durant or James Harden on his team, he's being ousted in the first round."
Kevin Durant doesn't have rings
"Not many finals teams are so injured that their second option is matthew dellavedova.  Listing the hawks and pistons was a joke insinuating that beating random teams in the regular season and racking up a bunch of wins because of ancall time great supporting cast os not impressive for ones legacy.  Lol nah.  Curry needed KD more for his legacy than the other way around.  Without KD the cavs 3-peat and without Kelly Olynyk the cavs probably 4-peat.  Kelly olynyk and Kevin Durant were the two most important players in the cavs/warriors “rivalry”, if you could call it that"
"???  2016 they were completely healthy and curry *folded* under pressure  2019 was completely their own fault, don’t sign kevin durant if you don’t want your entire bench to be terrible"
Harden can run an offense better than KD. Kevin Durant is the better player overall. Are these two statements contradicting?
"If you are arguing Harden is better at basketball than Kevin Durant, you need to stop"
"&gt; This is a dude that often didn't want to let Kevin fucking Durant take game winners when the game was on the line, preferring instead to take his own contested iso 3 when he can barely hit them at 30%.

This is a dude that often didn't want to let Kevin fucking Durant take game winners when the game was on the line, preferring instead to take his own contested iso 3 when he can barely hit them at 30%.   It's not necessarily a knock on him, either. He's a ball dominant player who's used that fire to propel him to a legendary first ballot hall of fame career. You just got to build around him if you want him on your team. He ain't gonna be second fiddle. He doesn't even want to be 1a when it comes to scoring. Whether that leads to a championship...."
Yeah Kevin Durant was so stupid to trade away
"My rebuttal:  Draymond isn't a shell of himself, that's an overblown narrative. He's scored less points, yes, but Kevin Durant was on the team. Everything else stayed about the same except shooting, but 2016 was obviously an outlier in his career.  Klay shouldn't be too affected by his injury. An ACL isn't killer with modern medicine, and Klay's defense isn't laterally based so he should be relatively fine. Offensively he shouldn't really be effected. Other than rust I see no problems.  The bench right now is a joke, yes, but there's still the draft and free agency. Paschall could be a really good bench piece, Lee's a good shooter of the bench, Looney is good if he can stay healthy, Chris looks like he's improving, everything else is a question mark. Them doing awful was 4 games + preseason with a brand new team.  While this isn't exactly the 2014-16 core, if the Warriors know one thing it's that you don't need to win 70 to win a ring. And the Lakers weren't particularly deep this year. While they did have two top 5-7 players, their bench was made out of players who played their role well. The clippers had a much deeper bench, but no set roles in their offense or defense, so they failed. The Warriors don't need to be 2016 deep, they just need players to fulfill the needs of the team. At this point it's defensive wings that's left.  I think that's more than the Thunder could say heading into this past season, so to me they are locks."
How would that even be possible? That’s some Kevin Durant Luka Doncic Lebron James Michael Jordan type shit.
The off-season posts peaked like first week with that Kevin Durant/AD thread
"&gt; yeah... the years he was already being recognized as the best by his contemporaries where he ran into ATG teams in the bird c's and the bad boy pistons  One more time, **recognition is not a championship.**  Wilt was recognized, his number of championships hurt him.

His winning in Cleveland helped him. His winning in Los Angeles helps him with everyone except those that are afraid he will exceed Michael's win total.  &gt;the question was **who benefited the most from having a great organization,** so you decided to point out MJ without scottie and phil but didn't mention lebron without his great organizations or anyone else  SIGH.

"Jimmy, Kevin Durant, and Kyrie."
Can we sign another kevin durant then please
"I mean postions are kind of silly in the nba besides center. I mean look at Lamelo he will probably play SG and PG for the Hornets, and Anthony Edwards might start at SF for the Timberwolves. I think positions don't really matter that much for the most part. The NBA is different from the NFL that way in the NFL you wouldn't see your star quarterback line up as a running back sometimes maybe go to WR. Kevin Durant  can play almost any postion in the NBA."
"Cleveland had a massive Salary because Lebron got guys like Tristian paid after 2016. He forced a trade of the first overall pick in the draft for a stretch four with a big contract in Kevin Love when he got there. I think you’re forgetting when Dwyane Wade got Lebron and Bosh to sign in Miami and when Draymond, Steph and Klay got Durant to sign in GS. Saying that players sign places because “they’re best friends” is crazy, money and rings are all that matters to these dudes. If that was true we would’ve seen Lebron, Melo, CP3 and a bunch of D leaguers on team for the last couple years."
"10 years ago this team has Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka on it."
Was Kevin Durant his Sasuke?

"&gt; They have the greatest collection of talent in NBA history.   That is genuinely hilarious.  What are you, about 12?  There are multiple teams in history with Hall of Famers coming off the bench.  &gt;High usage players, generally have high turnover numbers. And his usage are always near the top of the league. And turnovers by primary ball handlers are in general not a problem when you compare them to the offense they create. You aren't listening at all.   Harden has led the league in turnovers five out of six years.  He only led the league in usage twice and some years, wasn't in the top 5.  I'm listening, but I'm only hearing pathetic excuses for all of Harden's many failures and shortcomings.  &gt;He's also one of the best passers in the league, like top 5 or 6 so whatever turnovers there are its more than made up by the playmaking he creates.   And yet, over that span, his ""very very bad"" current teammate Westbrook has led the League in assists more often.  What a conundrum.  &gt; What?BPM is a good stat   BPM loves Westbrook, who you called ""very very bad"".  Another conundrum.  &gt;They were a third seed before Jimmy Butler got hurt, see context, see how nice that is.   ""We beat the team that was almost the 3rd seed in the first-round!  Whoot!  We're #1! We're #1!""   Keep sayin' dumb stuff, and I'll keep mocking you.  &gt;And it doesnt mean shit when you take into account his TS%. What are you taking about? TS% can be used at any position, a person drawing FTS isnt position dependent. Holy crap.   You're going to want to research that comment, and delete it.  &gt;  Like I really dont understand you are gonna compare league average TS% today to all those year prior.   We'll just add this to the lengthy list of things that you don't understand then.  The percentages you quoted were up through 2019, which is pretty damn close to ""nowadays"".  &gt;Okay? They've also had more talent on their team as well, what is your point? That you dont use context. I agree.   Jimmy Butler had more talented teammates than Harden has ever had?  Dirk and Dwight did, too?  That's a highly questionably claim right there.  &gt;Harden was 23 years old and this was as his first year as the guy on his team. Westbrook was not trash back then as he was still in his athletic prime. Also Kevin Durant is also ....well Kevin Durant.   Oh I see.  Guys are terrible when they play with Harden, but really good when they play against him.  And 23 year-old Harden can't be expected to make it out of the first round against 23 year-old Lillard.  That, I guess, is unfair to Harden somehow.  &gt; Yea he didnt play well that series?   He played that way all season.  In point of fact, Aldridge's career playoff effective FG% is an ugly 46.1%, so that was not at all an outlier series.  You can look these things up, instead of talking out of your ass, you know.    &gt;  Its hard to get to the WCF.   Harden certainly finds it such.  &gt;Let alone get to the finals   Even more so.  &gt; It was a waste of time talking to you.   Too bad, you could've learned something."
"&gt;Many teams don't, and still win more than 58 games. And they didn't have an all-time great playoff run, either.  No, most championship contenders, loaded with talent dont.  &gt;Still not the greatest team ever, regardless of how many times you pathetically bleat it.  Uhh yea they are. They have the greatest collection of talent in NBA history. You can pathetically go against reality. Where most people who know more about ball than you or I would agree with what Im saying.  &gt;That's a terrible attempt at making an excuse. He's led the league in turnovers five of the past six years! He should be a baker  High usage players, generally have high turnover numbers. And his usage are always near the top of the league. And turnovers by primary ball handlers are in general not a problem when you compare them to the offense they create. You aren't listening at all. He's also one of the best passers in the league, like top 5 or 6 so whatever turnovers there are its more than made up by the playmaking he creates.  &gt;Yeah, BPM. I nearly threw out my eye, I rolled it so hard  What?BPM is a good stat. So is VORP. And especially PIPM which Harden was third in that year. You can keep trying to deny it thought,thats fine.  &gt;Clearly your standards for that term are **way, way** lower than mine, or any reasonable person's.  They were a third seed before Jimmy Butler got hurt, see context, see how nice that is.  &gt;Those are all effective FG% numbers. Harden's are so low that they look like FG% numbers, so yours is an easy mistake to make. TS% is less accurate and meaningful, because it assumes FTA without considering position and play.  And it doesnt mean shit when you take into account his TS%. What are you taking about? TS% can be used at any position, a person drawing FTS isnt position dependent. Holy crap.  &gt;You seem to think these numbers are much better than they are. The league median TS% is around 56.5% these days. So you are bragging that Harden was just a touch over league median, and unintentionally reinforcing my point.  Nowadays, like this year lol. TS% has been on the incline for awhile, so in those prior years he was either right around league average or significantly higher than it. Like I really dont understand you are gonna compare league average TS% today to all those year prior. Its such a disingenuous way to evaluate a player. And you're wrong too.  &gt;Everyone who has been to the Finals has had more success than Harden.  Okay? They've also had more talent on their team as well, what is your point? That you dont use context. I agree.  &gt;That's an awful lot of excuses.  That's an awful lot of context.  &gt;That Thunder team wasn't loaded. Just Durant, and Westbrook -- who is very bad, according to you -- and some role players. They went out meekly in 5 to the Grizzlies of all teams, in the following round.  Harden was 23 years old and this was as his first year as the guy on his team. Westbrook was not trash back then as he was still in his athletic prime. Also Kevin Durant is also ....well Kevin Durant.  &gt;.Neither was that Trail Blazers team all that good. 23 year old Lillard and Lamarcus Aldridge -- the latter firing up bricks from all angles to the tune of a 45% eFG%. They also left meekly in 5 in the second round.  Yea he didnt play well that series? So? Players have ball playoff series. See Kawhi and PG this year and literally any other every NBA superstar. He was young and this was before he really exploded as an MVP.  &gt;So what you're telling me is that in order for Harden to get past the first round, he needs to be paired with an All-Star in their prime? That's an awful lot of help required for such a supposedly-good player, just to make the second round.  No? When did I say that? Dude has only ever had a true top 10 player on his team once in his career, and that team won 65 games and were on the way to beating the GOAT(yea I said it) team.  And dude this is the Western conference, its been the better conference for a long time. Its hard to get to the WCF. Let alone get to the finals, without multiple all stars on your team.And Harden has only gotten better every single year he's been in the league.  &gt;Maybe he'll get lucky and go to Brooklyn where he can ride Kyrie Irving's coattails to the Finals. I mean, at least Irving's been there before.  It was a waste of time talking to you. Holy crap good bye."
"They're on bballref team pages. But beware, you're gonna find A LOT more noise than meaning. Example:  Kevin Durant  - 16-17: +8.6  - 17-18: +1.9  - 18-19: +16.1"
"&gt; Edit: Nice edit bro  Thanks, yeh I had to make sure to get the age right. That was my edit. I had it at 28 before but that was actually Elton Brand. Kevin Durant was 30 when he got the injury and expected return is at age 32.   &gt; I am not arguing with you, i didnt say you were wrong.  No worries bro.  Interesting article if yer interested: https://warriorswire.usatoday.com/2019/06/29/dominique-wilkins-kevin-durant-is-going-to-be-fine/"
As a die heart and unbiased Lebron fan it pains me to admit this move easily makes Brooklyn the favorites. Lebron should just retire to prevent further damaging to his career by the best player in the league Kevin Durant
I met Greg Oden at a wnba game a few years ago.  I asked about how he was dealing with injuries and post playing career. He said he made peace with his post playing career and how he's not Kevin Durant. Told me that he's running some camps and was thinking about doing dental School.  I met Lamond Murray a few months ago after he had a medical procedure. We had gone to Berkeley at the same time so we talked about some of the food around campus. I had taught high school at the school that he graduated from so we talked about some of the old coaches there.  He told me about what it was like to play in China. he said the competition was like high school there although it was a life-changing experience. I think he told me that he's working with the clippers for some player development thing. He told me that his son was trying to get into the G league.  Both very nice and down to earth guys.
"Kevin Durant in his last season with golden state averaged 26 ppg on 63% TS, Anthony Davis averaged 26 ppg on 61% TS. So besides scoring what’s your justification for thinking KD is the better player, because AD has him beat in every other aspect of the game."

"I still remember him in the playoffs against the Clippers, getting a fast break with just seconds left in a close game. It was a 3 on 1 fast break vs Matt Barnes. Kevin Durant on his right, Russell Westbrook on his left. This jackass decides to take it himself, and Matt knew he wouldn’t fucking pass it, and was able to intentionally foul. Pretty sure OKC ended up winning, but my God if there was ever one play to define a player, that’s the one for him."
"Well I’m not comparing Vince Carter to Kevin Durant, who’s arguably the greatest scorer in the history of the game. That would be ludicrous.   That doesn’t take away from the greatness of those other guys you mentioned either. I’m just looking at the facts objectively; teams averaged around 97 PPG in the mid 2000’s and teams now put up 111 PPG.. it’s not ridiculous to suggest the premier players would find more avenues to score in today’s game, I’m not saying everyone would, but the top 20 players in that era were truly great players. Like teams are shooting double the threes today (34) to 2006 (16), and  Vince Carter was the original Curry in terms of range. The shots he used to take back then would get so much criticism yet those same shots are the bread and butter of the premier players today."
"Man you sound so old that calling someone like you a 15 years old kid would be a complement.   It's reddit, i wont go throwing things around like ""In my humble opinion there is a great chance that KD will not be the same player again!""  Dont be such a snowflake at your age. You said it yourself. You don't know, i don't know. Yet you act like its a given that KD will come back as a great dominant force at the age of 32. According to you though he is still very young.  &gt;  I’d bet on Kevin Durant before I bet on a 24 year old kid I’m arguing with on Reddit while a taking a shit in the handicap stall in my office.  Good for you, sadly its not on durant's hand how good he will be when he comes back, same as it wasn't on kobe's, boogie's.  Your arguement is fucking wack. You are just throwing that out to make me feel bad like you arent some random on reddit commenting like i am. I dont understand what your last sentence has to do with anything  Edit: !remindme 1 year"
"You’re only 24 years old yet post on here like you’re some old sage, full of uncompromising wisdom that we’re lucky enough to be subjected to. Trust me buddy, in only one year you’ll blush at the stupid things you said and the useless opinions you had just the prior year, we all do. If you were my age, you’d know better than to speak with so much confidence about a topic you know very little about. There is absolutely no way that you can predict with certainty what KD will be like after all of this rest and long rehab. I’m sure there will be some diminishing factors, but he’s still very young and a freak athlete that could easily bounce back and be in top form yet again, and if you were older you’d preface your post as mere opinion, not undeniable fact. Because we both have no clue, although I’d bet on Kevin Durant before I bet on a 24 year old kid I’m arguing with on Reddit while a taking a shit in the handicap stall in my office."
I wish okc would take wb and harden. maybe pick up that Kevin durant guy as well. That team would be unst... Wait.
"And 50% of KD's talent. By Ingram's age KD already had two scoring titles, had averaged 25+ PPG three times and 30+ once, KD had also already made the WCF, Ingram hasn't made the playoffs.  Imo, Ingram won't be much better than he currently is, dude plays zero defense and is an awful playmaker, he will most likely be a worse version of Melo and for a pure scorer, four years in and zero seasons averaging over 25 isn't great. He will be an exciting player who gets buckets for a while and nothing more, way closer to DeMar DeRozan than to Kevin Durant"
"Well, you clearly have your mind made up already, but if you’re saying that Draymond Green was a better player for the Warriors than Kevin Durant was, then I think you’re out of your mind. To each his own, though"
maybe the team doctors should adjust how they determine a players health. Kevin Durant had a billion lawsuit against them for his Achilles.

"Late, but Kevin Durant and Ty Lawson were on the same high school team"
"All-world defenders were leaving Kevin fuckin' Durant open on the break to lunge at *Stephen Curry at the three point line*.  The Warriors have always been Steph's team and KD played within it. That is also partially why he left. He hated that the fanbase didn't see him at the same level as Steph, although I would have argued that if he had stayed, would have gotten close to that same level of adoration. But everyone knows imports never get as much adoration as the homegrown stars, KD is just an odd dude in that way."
The one that has Brazilian Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant
Westbrook won them the first 3 games of that series. He outplayed curry hard and was the clear best player in those first 4 games.  Kevin durant played so poor and yet no one ever mentions that part. He was literally 10 for 30 every single game with 2 or 3 assists a game and getting outrebounded by his pg. Oh then he blamed everyone else and left.
To clarify you know i meant kevin durant right?
Well when that toy is Kevin Durant you take it. Doubt the Raptors regret renting Kawhi either
"Right so stories like this don't in any way shape or form originate from a source near him?  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2654113-russell-westbrook-reportedly-angry-hurt-by-kevin-durant-leaving-thunder  Tell me genius, do you think sports reporters just make shit up for shits and giggles?"
"&gt;I’m not saying Jimmy Butler is Kevin Durant or Chris Paul from mid range but he’s definitely good  He is definitely not good, he is okay at best (which in terms of mid range jumpshooting is pretty bad as it's an inefficient shot to start with). But more realistically he is pretty poor mid-range jumpshooter.  &gt;and a jimmy Butler mid range jumper in crunch time is a shot that scares any team  Why would that shot scare any team? It's an extremely inefficient shot. The worst offense in the NBA can produce a much more efficient shot in half-court.  &gt;Field goal % isn’t the end all be all.  FG% is a very good indicator of how good someone is at a certain shot. Obviously more context is needed, but in Butler's case no amount of context can account for the fact that it's a horribly inefficient shot.   And it's certainly a better indicator than only looking at his makes, which is what you're doing, and ignoring his misses.  Yes, he made a couple of jumpshots while up by a few points to put finishing touches on games this postseason (one against IND, one against MIL).  You're ignoring that he also missed mid range jumpshots in similar situations:  * Against MIL up 7 in the 4th (Game 3) * Against BOS up 5 in the 4th (Game 2) * Against BOS up 4 in the 4th (Game 4) * Against LAL up 6 in the 4th (Game 3) * Against LAL up 8 in the 4th (Game 4)  Butler made ZERO mid-range jumpshots (missed 9) over 9 straight 4th quarters in the playoffs (from G1 against the Bucks until Game 3 against the Lakers)."
"Haha if my flair didn't give it away, you're not going to get me to agree with that one.  I think your first Finals team had very little playoff experience, and I do think that matters in the playoffs.   Steph wasn't very awesome in those finals, and I think he learned and grew from them.   Confidence is real, even for elite athletes, and the confidence of winning that title pretty clearly propelled them to new heights (that whole ""breaking the Bulls regular season win total"" is a pretty good indicator that they were better the next season).  I think the Cavs and Warriors were more or less a wash in the year you lost to the Cavs.   It went 7 games, and Draymond was suspended for one of those games.   You *absolutely* didn't need KD to overcome that mountain.   You probably just needed Draymond to not kick guys in the balls, and the extra year of experience helps too (LeBron had already pretty much seen it all at that point).  And uhh, if you look at a lot of the flak that KD gets -- it's the 3-1 lead, man.   Everyone who has played a sport is kind of freaked out at the notion that an elite competitor can have their main rival *dead to rights*, completely up against the ropes, blow it, and then instead of being like ""Fuck if I just corrected *one mistake* we would have won"" they instead decide it's impossible to win and that they must build a mega super team.  Kevin Durant *and* Golden State did that same thing in the same year.   You both blew 3-1 leads, and both entities decided to go with ""help"" instead of ""I was really fucking close if I am just slightly better next year I can fucking do this, and I fucking know I can be better.""  That's anti-competitive garbage to a lot of people.   I understand why you disagree!   I would too if I were a Warriors fan."
“forced kevin durant to tear his achilles” makes it sound like bob myers personally did it to him
I’m not saying Jimmy Butler is Kevin Durant or Chris Paul from mid range but he’s definitely good and a jimmy Butler mid range jumper in crunch time is a shot that scares any team   Field goal % isn’t the end all be all. He was the clear cut best player on a finals team and closed multiple games in that run out with his jump shot
"Honestly, given the ""Houston won't trade Harden to the Sixers out of spite to Morey"", the one hope with the Harden situation is that the Rockets are the first team for a superteam creation to call their star player's bluff and say:  ""'Okay. You want to be traded? Fine. You want to go to Brooklyn to form a superteam? You won't accept any other trade but Brooklyn, guaranteeing we can't start a rebuild and have to accept a penny on the dollar for you? Fuck you. We showed you we'll be spiteful to our old GM, we'll be spiteful to our star too. I'm formally announcing the Houston Rockets won't accept any James Harden deal to the Brooklyn Nets that doesn't include one of Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving in the deal. You can go to Brooklyn, but you don't get your superteam."""
i mean we're approaching 3 years since they last won... that's a long time in NBA terms and hello... Kevin Durant??  they set the regular-season win record 5 years ago
[Link](https://www.tmz.com/2019/08/07/kevin-durant-says-hell-no-to-blaming-warriors-for-nba-finals-injury/) [Link 2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/08/08/kevin-durant-denies-being-pressured-play-finals-pressure-was-hard-ignore/)  There are many articles on the internet where KD says he was not pressured to play.  Should the Warriors held him out?  That is another question though.
"Kevin Durant is an excellent defender, I think he should have been All-Defense in 2017"
"an article about KD's rupture last year mentioned there have been 44 achilles injuries in 30 years, so i don't think it's anything new  https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/"
"i read elsewhere on the subject that there have been 7 achilles tears in the last 5 years, 20 in the last 15, and 44 in the last 30 years. it was somewhere on this subreddit that someone linked an article about KD's achilles injury last year after someone listed all 7 from past half-decade  it doesn't seem to be new at all, it's just happening to notable players at notable times, and that combined with recency bias makes it seem new  https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/"
"It has nothing to do with his race lmao. If that’s the case, are we segregating AD by calling him the brow because we call no one else that. It’s more brought upon by the way he maintains and carries out himself, like being basically useless and even a liability if “I’m Kevin Durant” is on the other team. Russ straight up wants to murder him, and we have a similar but lesser sentimentd"
Pretty sure Kevin Durant is reading this rn
"Three weeks later:  Fuck this soft ass Kevin Durant and so called ""Real team of New York"" Nets.  These guys are spoiled, overpaid bitches that doesn't appreciate anything."
Kevin Durant = Chris Bosh / Kevin Love
"The Warriors never relied on him to dribble and make plays. The season where he was supposed to develop that skillset is when they got Kevin Durant. By the time he sees the court again, the Warriors will likely have another PG to play alongside of Curry.  I feel terrible for Klay, but I would still be optimstic about his return.  Shaun Livingston is director of players affairs and engagement. Klay is in good hands."
"Teams hunted steph because if they dont, they are going against:  Klay Thompson, known leaguewide for guarding all star point guards  Kevin Durant, 7 foot monster with wingspan longer than steph curry's height  Draymond Green, former DPOY, also incredible wingspan  Andre Iguodala, also well know defender, resume includes guarding KD and lebron.  Not many point guards can be inserted here and not be the worst defender."
"Well simple answer is his combination (or lack thereof) of size (6’1) and age (22) which when you’re putting together an NBA draft board are big factors. The kid can ball. And he’s proven it, many times. He averaged 18+ the last couple years while taking the assist record. But you have to keep in mind that NBA teams are taking kids who have never played in the big leagues, ever. And it’s hard to go from playing against college kids to playing against Kevin Durant and Lebron James. So, they have certain metrics they base their picks on. Its hard to go off the typical eye test when you get two picks a year, which is why he fell. I think he’s going to succeed based on what I’ve seen from him on tape, but it’s a tough league to make it in."
"&gt;  I don’t think LA could’ve handled a healthy Curry/Klay/Dray core trio  That core isn't as impressive as it sounds when you consider that a)  they're all older, coming off major injuries, or both and b) no longer have a functioning death lineup, which was essential to them dominating from 2014-2016 before Kevin Durant joined."
"Super convenient to leave out zion, buddy hield, Anthony davis, Blake griffin, kevin durant, jj redick, Andrew bogut, jameer nelson and that's before going into the 90s"
https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2019/06/14/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-recovery-nba-finals/1447053001/  It isn't (significantly) more common today. 44 over the last 30 years. We just obviously remember the recent ones more.
"pritchard is overrated. I thought you Oregonians woulda let Pritchard's go after former GM Kevin Pritchard, who took Oden over Durant in '07."
Michael Jordan or Kevin Durant
I wouldn’t have pegged Kevin Durant for a Robin-type role.
If it makes you feel better. In 15 years you get kevin durant jr according to my latest 2k save
**BREAKING:** Golden State has traded all their picks in the 2020 Draft to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant.
"wow the thunder turned russell westbrook, james harden, and kevin durant into so many draft picks! -@HugoKitano"
"You're right dude. A team with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, a good bench, and perhaps even James Harden doesn't stand a chance in the playoffs. Brilliant take here."
"Presti is 1000% hoarding picks to get Emoni ""Kevin Durant Jr."" Bates. love it"
Kevin Durant is the 2nd greatest player of all time after Michael Jordan. He's just been extremely unlucky.  * Gets drafted to an extremely cheap owner * Team trades high level starter for scrub center * Team chooses garbage center over MVP even though they could amnesty scrub team * Team doesn't trade cancerous teammate that limits touches of KD * Injures foot which makes him less aggressive of a slasher for the rest of his career * garbage head coaches in OKC * No shooting outside of a mediocre stretch 4 * Goes to Golden State dominates builds best team in history * tears Achilles trying to three peat  Lebron is the luckiest player of all time.
Kevin Durant  EDIT: You also think Walker is better than Tatum??? Id argue Tatum plays enough 4 to be called one
"Using your definition, in no particular order: Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, Jimmy Butler, Paul George, Jayson Tatum, Pascal Siakam, Klay Thompson, Kyle Lowry, Bam Adebayo, Kevin Durant, Khris Middleton, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday.... I could go on for a while"
I mean they just seem like a bad team.   Kevin Durant was on 2 teams that went 20-62 and 22-47 and he turned out fine.  If you're picking between Ball and Edwards I would pick Ball but it's a scary draft to be near the top.
"So which of the 2015 or 2017 teams weren’t great teams then?   2015 and 2016 warriors were deep and had great benches.  2017 and 2018 warriors traded all of their depth for Kevin Durant.   Both versions of these teams won titles.   Also, if you’re going to try and say that Iguodala and Livingston helped make the warriors a great team, then KCP, Rondo and Caruso helped make the lakers be a great team."
Yeah wasn’t sure. Either way I think team Kevin wins. KG and Durant as a combo is lethal.
"He put up 23.6 per game for one season, every other season he averages around 20/4/2, Kevin Durant is a top 20 player of all time at worst, that's the difference"
"This is actually a fun shit post lol  But Kevin's easily I think  I mean you got LeBron Harden and Worthy leading James against Durant, McHale, Garnett, Love and of course you can't forget the great Kevin Martin"
"Durant, Garnett, McHale's racist ass, Kevin Willis, Kevin Love, Kevin Johnson, Kevin Duckworth  LeBron, Worthy, Harden, James Edwards, James Donaldson, James Posey  I think the Kevs have it."
A front court with Kevin McHale and KG would be so much fun to watch.  Kevin Martin and Kevin Love hoisting up threes.  Kevin Johnson running the point.  Kevin Durant doing everything else.  Spooky.
"Sources around the league believe there is a “verbal agreement” between the Nets and Rockets that would bring James Harden to Brooklyn, and create a superteam with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving."
"A rookie with an ego and Kevin Fucking Durant are not the same. You sooth KD's ego to get chips, you slap the living hell out of the rookie until he learns how the NBA works."
I wish hyperlinking worked for me  https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/10/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-golden-state-warriors-thunder-work-friends
"Nets will trade anyone not named Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, so this is what you’re left with:  Kyrie/KD/Harden &amp; the entire Nets G-League called up"
"I don’t think it’s fair to write off an entire season as an “outlier”. The 94 bulls had 3 all stars, all three of which were on the 93 bulls the previous season.   The best player (MJ) was removed and replaced with solid role players and they were contenders that year. Based on that, I think it’s fair to say the 93 bulls were a superteam. The 93 bulls had 4 talented all star caliber players in Horace, pippen, bj and Jordan, with a legendary coach in phil Jackson. Pippen and Jordan being superstars is worth noting as well.   As for the warriors. There’s an article made two years ago that states that the warriors were 25-1 without kd.  If the warriors had decided to not sign Kevin Durant and just kept Barnes, they would’ve been one of the top contenders for the title. In a world where the dubs don’t get KD, they probably still win another title or at least come close. Also you mentioned Barbosa/bogut but they weren’t key role players to the warriors success. They were easily replaced the following season by mccaw/zaza (even though those two obviously are prolly a lil worse) who played very similar low amounts of minutes. The key role players iggy/livingston were still on the team."
"I need a formal, written explanation from Kevin Durant regarding whatever the fuck he did at the 3 minute mark."
"Yeah Beasley is a bad man on the court. I found an article close to what I meant but I was off. He says he had a hard time because he got in trouble right off the bat (getting caught smoking weed with Chalmers in a hotel room) and it left a bad taste in alot of peoples mouth.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2755718-kevin-durant-says-michael-beasley-is-as-skilled-as-lebron-james.amp.html   If you care to read it, although you probably already have at some point."
"LMAO the video description:  &gt;February 16, 2008 - NBA pro basketball rookie Kevin Durant treats ESPN viewers to a feast for the ages. He mines a lovely nose nugget and carefully rolls it between his fingers. After mining and refining his ever so delicate nose gold he chomps it away in a tastefully and blissful manner. From myself and everyone past the age of 7, thank you Mr. Durant."
"KD’s a different guy for sure...he’s like a lost 20yr old navigating through life, trying to figure out what makes him happy, where he wants to live etc....  ....except he’s Kevin Freaking Durant and one of the best basketball players in the world. It’s truly bizzarre.   But you do you fam - I got nothing but appreciation for KD and he deserves to find that happiness he’s searching for.  I honestly think he’s just a guy who likes to try new things and experience a bunch of different life experiences."
Fastest sports affiliated restaurant closing at the time by a large margin. It’s now a similar restaurant called Charleston’s. Posting from mobile so hopefully this works well.  https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-durant-restaurant-closes-2016-7
"You’re entire argument is “the Lakers are a superteam” and “KD joining the best team of all time is no different than lebron teaming up with another superstar and mediocre role players”.   You have yet to explain how exactly the Lakers qualify as some super fucking team. Or some stacked god squad.   You have yet to explain how the two moves are the same.   I have explained to you how the Lakers aren’t a superteam:   -they lack depth  -they were missing Avery Bradley in the playoffs  -they lack floor spacing/shooting ability - A lot of their role players are mediocre and/or low iq (Caruso, Kuz, Dwight, green, and Morris)  - finally, they’re lack of depth makes them no better than the other top teams. Clippers, rockets, nuggets, bucks, the heat pre-injury, jazz and Celtics were on par with the Lakers in terms of team composition. As in, If you were to take lebron off the Lakers and take the best player from any of those teams off their roster, the teams are about even. That might be hard for you to comprehend so I’ll give an example.  Ex. The Lakers without lebron are about equal to the Celtics without jayson Tatum.   Some teams are obviously a little better with that example and some teams are a little worse (bucks/heat). But you get the point, the Lakers roster isn’t relatively insane like you make it sound.  Now, I have explained how the move is different:   Kevin Durant joined the 15-16 warriors who were arguably the best team of all time. This move is shitty to me for two reasons.   1) Kevin Durant was already on a great thunder team and could’ve beat the warriors had he AND Russell not choked. It’s not like KD had to join the warriors to win a title, the move was completely unnecessary because everyone knew that KD was completely capable of potentially winning a title in OKC, with that roster. Instead of playing with a good enough team to win the title, he chose to play with a team that would almost guarantee the title in 2017.   The league in 2016 was up for grabs, the Spurs, clippers, thunder, rockets, Cavs were all in contention. The warriors were the favorites but it was never certain they would win and no team really had an apparent advantage over the other. It was fun to watch these great teams compete against each other. Which leads me to my second reason...  2) KD broke the parity of the league like never before.  Never before had we seen a top player in the league join the best team in the league. That’s what makes his move different. His move mad the 2016-17 season a forgone conclusion. Regardless of what happened in 2018-2020, the warriors in 2017 were a different animal. Imo it was boring to watch a team be so unguardable and make easy work of the playoffs.   That’s what makes it different, the Lakers weren’t even favorites by most people this year. If Lebron got kawhi AND Ad I wouldn’t have bothered watching because it would’ve been stupidly unbalanced. I’m glad kawhi went to the clippers because it made things exciting again. I’m simply against moves that make the league uncompetitive. Even if the league was only uncompetitive for one year with the warriors. It was long enough to make me disinterested in NBA basketball for a while. That’s what makes his move unique, it killed the competitiveness of the league and the excitement of not knowing what was gonna happen in the end."
yeah but imagine having james hard AND kevin durant AND another MVP level guard!!  its never been done before...
"2016 playoffs:   -Kevin Durant: 28 ppg 7rpg 3 apg 1 spg 1 bpg 43% FG  -Russel Westbrook: 26 ppg 7 rpg 11 apg 2.6 spg .1 bpg 40.5 FG%   Yea, it’s all Westbrook’s fault for them not being successful though, right?"
"I mean, am I crazy in thinking that a locker room of James Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant is gonna have a decent chance to implode? All three of those players are notoriously fickle and need the ball continuously on offense.   * Kyrie demanded a trade away from the Cavaliers with LeBron and seemingly made every Celtic player on that team go crazy.  * Kevin Durant did the whole snake thing, and had noticeable locker room issues in Golden State. The Warriors still won so it's probably not a big issue, but there's still some kind of risk. We also haven't seen him play in an entire year, so we don't know how his injury is gonna effect him. * As for Harden, both Westbrook and CP3 have had troubles with the culture in Houston because they didn't think Harden took enough accountability.   They would obviously be probably the most talented team in history, but it's not a guarantee that they're gonna work well together. They're contracts also all run till 2023, so the Rockets would have 4 unprotected first rounders after they all enter free agency at the same time. They're also gonna have a ton of competition. The Lakers improved. The Bucks got Bogdanović and Jrue. The Warriors are coming back healthy with whatever they can get for the #2 pick (possibly LeVert, Covington, and Allen from the Rockets). The Clippers haven't made a move yet, but I'm sure are gonna be pressured into making one now (maybe Westbrook???).  Plus, even if the trio works great together, the Rockets are gonna still be getting unprotected Nets picks when Durant is 39 and Harden is 38. The Rockets would have to hope for a suuuuuppppppeeeeeerrrrr long term payoff, but it's not impossible."
"Yeah, Kevin Durant hasn't played a minute of game time for the Nets so far."
Kevin Durant is never gonna win an actually real ring LUL
"We literally just saw Kevin Durant bail on a multiple-time Championship team.  Why, exactly, do you believe that Anthony Davis would've stayed on a Laker team that is far worse without a healthy James?  Davis didn't want to play with Holiday and Randle, you really think he's sticking around to play with Avery Bradley and Kyle Kuzma after a first-round loss?"
That's exactly what I was going to say!  [Article about the restaurant rebranding after KD left.](https://oklahoman.com/article/5515056/former-kevin-durant-restaurant-will-reopen-with-homage-to-famous-oklahomans)
Are you forgetting that Kevin Durant is coming off an achilles injury?
"KD ""what you mean easy road again? i was just doing my thing and harden came to my team""     i struggle to see how that's going to work, iso heavy shooter with two ball hogging point guards that fall into the same iso habits very often     also mediocre defense     someone would have to be the bitch and i bet kyrie would not be happy being a third wheel after he hated being second     this would just be bizarre to me to have durant hurt his own legacy again and kyrie being involved in a situation he'd be the kevin love and harden continuing to say he wants to play beautiful basketball and then proceeds to team up with 2 ball dominant peers"
"They each present similar issues in terms of not being a scheme fit. Obviously Harden is over-whelmingly more talented than Harris. How the hell are we going to evaluate Harden now that the entire offense isn't going to be centered around him and he won't be averaging 35PPG? How on earth is the dynamic going to be balanced with Kyrie? How confident are we about KD's health returning and the fact he may find himself in a lot of the same predicaments he did with Westbrook in his OKC days?  This isn't NBA2k. They HAVE the two bonafide stars. Throwing ""the kitchen sink"" at a deal like this rarely works unless it's an incredible unique 2016 Warriors strategy where it was basically giving up Harrison Barnes and Bogut for Kevin Durant.   If I had to guess - this is going to lead to an implosion in the 2nd Round / ECF where we all wonder why the hell they blew up all their depth given the pieces they had."
Person posting this is the same type of person that thought Pat Beverley could guard Kevin Durant.
"they're saying it based on this Puccio tweet:  &gt; Sources around the league believe there is a “verbal agreement” between the Nets and Rockets that would bring James Harden to Brooklyn, and create a superteam with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving."
You mean the team that was missing Kevin Durant for 1.25 games? The Rockets were significantly worse in 2019 than they were in 2018 and every game in that series came down to 5 or fewer points.
Good luck stoping Brandon Roy and Kevin Durant + LMA
"PAT RILEY'S INCREDIBLE track record aside, it was hard to take him at face value nine months ago.  ""Whether you believe me or not, we're at the launching pad right now,"" Riley said during his annual postseason news conference. ""We've been through this now a long time. We know how to do this. We have done it in a myriad of different ways. We're going to figure it out.""  Riley's Miami Heat had missed the playoffs for a third time in five seasons. The Heat were capped out and had gone from chasing stars to overpaying role players. As a result, as the rest of the NBA was about to embark on one of the wildest summers of player movement ever, Miami seemed doomed to be relegated to the sidelines.  Riley, though, was undeterred.   ""Don't make any conclusions that we're stuck with certain contracts. That would be foolish thinking,"" Riley said. ""There aren't any obstacles, there are only opportunities.""  The Heat front office saw something they thought doubters were dismissing. Their choppy last few seasons aside, they believed their franchise and the city of Miami hadn't dimmed as drawing cards. They felt they didn't need cap space or high draft picks to make it happen. They needed only a star who wanted to be in Miami.  Sure, the Los Angeles and New York teams were rivals, but that was nothing new. The Heat had beaten those teams for stars in the past. Riley and his trusted lieutenants firmly believed an active marketplace played to their favor, and 2019 free agency would be active.  Once again, the old master was proved right. It showed in his wide smile as he sat alongside Jimmy Butler last July, the landing of a star that has become a turning point. To some, it was an unexpected sign-and-trade. As Riley predicted he could, he unloaded Hassan Whiteside's bloated expiring contract, creating the path for Bam Adebayo to elevate from role player to second star.  In short, the Heat are back, and back to doing what they've always done: gathering stars and contending. From Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway to Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal to the ""Heatles"" of Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Riley has done this time and again since joining the Heat 25 years ago.  Now the Heat are on the hunt for another big catch. Whether it's a member of the desirable 2021 free agency class or some other star, Riley has one more chance to create a Big Three on the shores of Biscayne Bay.   THIS REEMERGENCE OF the Heat as a force comes after five difficult years. James left in July 2014. Bosh re-signed, but recurring blood clots derailed his career. That they appeared for the first time just as the Heat were trading for Goran Dragic was a cruel twist of fate. All of it set the stage for Wade's ugly -- albeit brief -- departure.  The failure to sign any major free agents -- namely Kevin Durant and Gordon Hayward, on whom Miami put a full-court press to land -- was a reversal from the success the Heat had previously enjoyed.  As a result, the Heat changed tactics. In 2017, on the heels of failing to get Hayward, and after just missing the playoffs following a 30-11 close to the regular season, Miami invested heavily in non-stars. The Heat made more than $100 million in four-year investments to retain Dion Waiters and James Johnson -- deals that remain millstones around the team's neck.  ""There aren't any obstacles, there are only opportunities."" Heat president Pat Riley ""That's on me. You can put that all over me because I'm the one who made the deal at midnight [on July 1, 2017],"" Riley said last year. ""I didn't want the two guys on someone else's team, which would've been an even worse scenario.""  Riley also gave free agent Kelly Olynyk a four-year contract that summer. All of that followed the Heat's decision in 2016 to match a $50 million offer to reserve guard Tyler Johnson.  In settling for role players, the Heat adopted a slogan and hashtag to justify the method: ""Heat Culture."" And in fact, the Heat's culture has long been considered among the best in the NBA. But culture didn't deliver rings to Riley in Los Angeles and Miami -- stars did.  ""EVERYBODY IS LOOKING for a star,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Not everyone, though, can land them. Riley has proved, time and again, that he can.  The man proved to be a wizard of a coach and one of the league's great innovators. But Riley's best work has always been getting stars -- and getting the most from them.  By the time last season ended, Riley had made the course correction and was vowing to return to his roots. That's what led to his brash proclamations. While the Heat were proud that they always competed hard, and swore they enjoyed the chase for a lower playoff seed, they had reached a decision to get back to being the old Heat.  Riley admitted it might take until the summer of 2020 to get a star, and he hinted he might even have to pay a surcharge to dump some of his bad contracts. But once Butler became an option, Riley pounced.  General manager Andy Elisburg executed the sign-and-trade that required four teams to pull together. Complicated deals have long been an Elisburg specialty, whether it was the five-team, 13-player mega trade they executed in 2005 that stocked their 2006 title team, the Eddie Jones sign-and-trade in which Elisburg had 20 different machinations of Jones' contact in 2000, or the James and Bosh sign-and-trade deals in 2010.  The Heat were doing Heat things yet again."
Dwight Howard has made more 3s than Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant combine
mmm 2 years ago I put $50K on Dwight Howard ending the season with more 3's than Steph Curry + Klay Thompson + Kevin Durant in 2020
He said only Russell Westbrook can stop Kevin Durant.
"We may not have a chip like Cleveland, but we watched winning basketball in OKC for basically a decade straight and have what looks to be another decade of winning basketball ahead of us. We’ve watched stars like James Harden, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and Kyle Singler wear the letters OKC on their chest. It aint a chip, but it’s a solid consolation prize."
"Because Jrue Holiday is the head line guy for the Pelicans. Takes that pressure off BI, Lonzo, and Zion. He's also a guard that comfortably defend 3s. Those are rare.   By your logic, the Kevin Durant Warriors could have offload Stephen Curry for younger assets because ""they're fine without him""."
Kevin Durant
"Lol there couldn't be a more vague citation. Anyone on the planet could claim they are familiar with his thinking.     Hell... Let me tell you, I am pretty familiar with how Kevin Durant thinks. You can source me on this - he's forcing a trade to the Clippers this summer. Ya'll heard it here first."
Kevin Durant
"Whatever your opinion about Kevin Durant may be, dont fool yourself, he is easily one of the snakiest big men in the league and will always sneak away from any team."

"college ball is not NBA ball.. some of those kids need a lot of time to develop into the NBA game and it take a couple of year in the NBA in order for them to get there.     For every one Kevin Durant in the draft, unfortunately, there is about 200 Anthony Bennetts.."
Yeah he's just at a different stage in his caerer [58% of his shots this year have come off 0 dribbles](https://on.nba.com/38e4Dyb) only 13% of his shots have come at the rim this year his ISO poss have more than been cut in half compared to what they were back in 2016. He is a very good shooter but at this stage of his career a pull up 3 for him just doesnt happen often unless it's like in transition and it's wide open he's not at hte stage of his career where he will consistently generate separation and get say a step back 3 with the ease that Kevin Durant can.
ESPN: Jimmy Butler calls Kevin Durant a child.
"&gt; I think your ex was showing the opposite of this.   How? It is right to point out that Russell’s titles should be considered in the context of 8 team league, poor competition, regional drafts. The fact that I never watched Russell but have heard this from old heads perfectly illustrates what will happen with Durant.   I will be the old head telling the young guys why Durant’s titles and fmvps are meaningless. It’s not going to get lost.   &gt; Alot of this also just comes down to the fact people dont like Kevin Durant. And that has to go way beyond his decision at this stage.  Disagree. It’s just stating facts. Ask any 5 year old on the playground if they respect the best player on the losing team joining up with winners. No one will ever respect that move, it’s completely counter to all of the things we value in athletes such as competitive drive and perseverance. I was a huge fan of KD before that move and still am a fan of his skill. I’m going to hold it against him in legacy discussions because it’s reality that he didn’t earn his titles or fmvp’s. In the future if people are ignorant about his move the second you explain the context to them the immediate reaction would be ‘oh damn I had no idea he pulled that soft ass shit, you’re right I can’t defend that’."
&gt;never let go of the details  I think your ex was showing the opposite of this.   &gt;“he was one of the most talented players ever BUT the only way he ever won anything was by switching to the 73-9 team that he choked a 3-1 lead to’.  What a good bit of this will come down to is if KD can win a ring outside of GSW. If he can then just none of this is going to be remembered the way it is now that Im convinced of. If he doesnt I still dont think the emotional sentiment of vitriol there is now will be the same 20-30 yrs from now at all......but there might be some of it. Alot of this also just comes down to the fact people dont like Kevin Durant. And that has to go way beyond his decision at this stage. And the stuff like fighting with 12 yr olds on twitter being a part of his legacy in terms of him being unlikable 20 yrs from now that in particular Im pretty dubious of the idea truly holding and lasting.
“Kevin Durant is seven”.                                         ESPN: Jimmy Butler describes Durant as childish in recent players tribune article
"After the warriors experienced 2016, they needed a closer who could get to the line. KD wasn’t necessary for any team other than the cavs. The Cavs gameplan was pretty much foul the crap out of the guards and dare the refs to call anything + dare anyone else on the warriors to make open shots.  That gameplan is useless against a Kevin Durant. So in that aspect, he made them a winning team. He also made them a lot sloppier in their gameplan because people would rely too much on him and get complacent, but that’s besides the point."
"Kevin Durant joined a team that won  •	⁠67 games •	⁠the 2015 NBA championship •	⁠Had the 3rd longest win streak in nba history •	⁠won 73 games which is an nba record •	⁠Defeated Kevin Durant and his superstar teammate (who won mvp the following season) in the western conference final after durant had the worst choke job of his life  •	⁠Made back to back NBA finals  Then they replaced their worst starter with arguably the 2nd best player in the league who’s team was the top competitor to the warriors  in the west  What Kevin Durant did was flat out pathetic there is no other way to say it. The warriors made another finals after he got injured in 2019 and still almost took it to 7 with Klay missing key points of the series. The warriors didn’t need Kd to win titles and KD didn’t need the warriors to win titles either, he had a great team and is a great enough player that I wanted to see him earn a ring but I guess KD didn’t believe in himself. The warriors  and KD both knew that teaming together would make them so unbeatable that rings were a guarantee so he did it.  It’s literally like if Larry Bird ditched his Celtics teammates in order to win even more titles with the Lakers. They both could and did win titles without each other but if they were together they would have won ALL the titles  He didn’t earn those rings and he isn’t a true champion. The hardest part of the rings was reading the contract before he signed the dotted line  He didn’t wasn’t to actually test himself and battle for a championship like all the other great in NBA history. With a little bit of luck he could have won a title without joining a 73 win team but I guess KD didn’t believe he had it in himself and it’s sad that he gave up.   His playoff also numbers basically always dipped in OKC and were nothing compared to the efficiency he had when he joined a 73 win team    2016  Regular season - 28.2 ppg on 51/39/90  Playoffs -  28.4ppg on 43/28/89  2014  Regular season - 32.0ppg on 50/39/87  Playoffs -  29.6ppg on 46/34/81  2013  Regular season - 28.1ppg on 51/42/91  Playoffs - 30.8ppg on 46/31/83  .....  2016 vs Golden State (against the team he joined after he couldn’t beat them) - 30/8/3 on 42/29/92 splits (54% TS)  2014 WCF vs spurs - 26/8/3 on 48/33/76 splits (56% TS)  2013 WCSF vs Memphis - 29/10/7 on 42/36/77 splits (53% TS)  That certainly isn’t what he was shooting when he had the pleasure of playing with the 2 greatest shooters ever.  He wasn’t bad but it’s not the elite level efficiency that people expect out of him.  Kevin Durant wasn’t putting up the kind of efficiency numbers he had in golden state because he had the easiest life any superstar has ever had while he was playing with golden state. Having a 73 win team and goat spacing around you helps a lot  Again, I’m not saying these are bad numbers but it’s obvious he didn’t play as well in the playoffs compared to his regular season play until he joined a 73 win team.   Hell even in the 2018 playoffs KD only shot 34% from three with a 73 win team around him.   Despite KD winning 2018 finals mvp if you actually look at it again. Curry was better in the 2018 playoffs as a whole and better in 2 out of the 4 finals games and arguably 3 of 4. Somehow KD had the lowest amount of defensive attention in his life while curry was getting fouled off ball ever play in the finals and curry still put up better numbers most games.   The game KD was better in 2018 he had the best finals game of his career and Curry had the worst. The series was a sweep so that impacted the numbers severely and KD won finals MVP but don’t be fooled. Curry was the best player for them in the playoffs easily and in the finals as a whole"
"&gt;You don't trade away Jayson Tatum and picks so that you can maybe win a title if Kevin Durant is injured.  You sort of do trade away picks and players to chase a window. The Celtics window is pretty much closed at this point. They once had a treasure grove of valuable picks and young players, now they have expensive players and no assets. They have a competitive team for years to come and maybe with some luck can land a free agent to push them into contention, but they aren't a top tier team and missed out on being true contenders the last four seasons due to Ainge over valuing his assets."
"Running list of my thoughts   &gt;Allen Iverson '00-'05 (54 games): 37.5 points/100, -2.5 rTS  Yet another ex of why AI's playoff run in 2001 will always be rather overrated to me. Big volume scoring but hardly some one man carry job, had a top 5 defense people just forget the games like the huge game 5 vs Milwaukee he shot 5/27 and they still won despite that being a ""one man team!!"". People also go overboard making the excuse about his supporting cast causing his dip in efficiency, he just wasnt efficient, missed alot of shots all there was to it.   &gt;Kobe Bryant '07-'10 (67 games): 38.7 points/100, +4.0 rTS  Was a recent Ben Taylor episode on how he actually got better if anything in the playoffs.   &gt;Dirk Nowitzki '06-'11 (71 games): 35.3 points/100, +7.5 rTS  The irony in the Dirk playoff career is that many of his earlier playoff performances were really good despite being labeled a choker and it took his team coming back from 2-1 when he shot 38% those final 3 games vs Mia for people to say ""See he's no longer a choker he's now a winner!!!""  &gt;while Robinson and Karl Malone were the reverse  I mostly agree although I do think Robinson's importance in the 99 title is probably overlooked due to Timmy having the bigger volume stats. This was another Ben Taylor recent episode but the impact metrics as of then  him and Snellings were talking about how Robinson actually had better impact metrics than Duncan that time.   &gt;Manu Ginobili '05-'07 (56 games): 31.8 points/100, +8.5 rTS  +8.5 damn   &gt;Kevin Durant '16-'19 (66 games): 38.1 points/100, +7.0 rTS  There was definitely a difference in his efficiency in GSW vs OKC. Like 58% TS vs 63% or something  &gt;Klay Thompson's volume and efficiency both dropped significantly after Durant joined Golden State  Klay's a max player held to role player expectations the mythology of him being some huge playoff performer is based off 1 game in OKC and people only selectively remembering his good moments and in the bad games just blaming Steph or KD."
"Kevin Durant played for 10 minutes in the entire finals series AND Klay missed a game plus the latter half of the clincher. Come on now, those aren't comparable"
"This seems like a fun exercise. I'll take a stab at it.  Point Guard.  **(1) Stephen Curry** - He's #1 for now but the last time he balled out as his team's undisputed #1 was four years ago. If he doesn't come back strong, then then his position at the top starts to become contentious.  **(2) Russell Westbrook** - Top 3 playmaker in the league, crazy at pushing the pace, one of the best rebounders in the league, elite kick and drive game, has a history of going off for 40+ points  **(3) CP3** - Has shown he can still deliver if he plays in a team geared to his strengths. However, is injury prone and has lost a step.  **(4) Damian Lillard** - Is the most proven of all the other score-first guards in the league so he's fourth by default.  **(5) Kemba Walker** - Less flashier than Kyrie but is more of a team player and provides more effort on D  **(6) Trae Young** - Only reason I'm not putting him in the top 5 is because the Hawks have been absolute trash. Potentially the greatest offensive guy in this list.  **(7) Kyle Lowry** - Is a reliable floor general who's just all-around good at everything. Doesn't get the respect he deserves tbh.  **(8) Kyrie Irving** - He really showed his limitations on the Celtics last year. He's entertaining as fuck but isn't a great playmaker or a consistent elite scorer yet. I need to see more from him.  **(9) Ben Simmons** - He's fantastic at everything but shooting. Unfortunately, he's the 5th scoring option when everyone's healthy so his opportunities to demonstrate what he can fully do as a top is limited  **(10) Malcom Brogdon** - Is emerging as a top notch floor general too. Great length and can't wait to see him alongside Dipo  Shooting Guard.  **(1) James Harden** - He's a one-man-offence. Pass him the ball and stand on the perimeter is a legit winning strategy. 38ppg is absurd.  **(2) Klay Thompson** - Elite shooter. Top notch defender. Doesn't need to handle the ball. Would start for literally every franchise in the league.  **(3) Luka Doncic** - It's weird. I think he's a better player than Klay but not a better SG lol. His NBA career has gotten off to a great start but his impact against elite teams takes a severe dip and I don't know how he'd perform in the playoffs.   **(4) Devin Booker** - Is in the loaded Western Conference where most of the best guards play so gets a lot of disrespect. However if you use your eyes, it's obvious that he's a supremely talented fella.  **(5) Donovan Mitchell** - His solid defence makes up for the usual efficiency complaints. Has shown an increased playmaking capacity in Conley's absence.  **(6) Bradley Beal** - Considering he's in his 8th season, I don't think he's done enough to be in the top 5. I don't really see why he's a lot of people's #2 either.  **(7) Victor Oladipo** - If he returns to his pre-injury form, then he's basically a top 5 staple. A ball-handling bucket getter who plays great defence.  **(8) Jrue Holiday** - Watching Jrue clamp up a great guard is one of the most exhilarating things in the NBA. He's also good for 20ppg.  **(9) Zach Lavine** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Demar Derozan** - Is the gatekeeper for a top 10 SG imo. Has shown he can handle being a #1 guy but isn't clutch and hasn't developed his 3pt game since leaving Toronto.  Small Forward  **(1) Lebron James** - Kawhi coasts too much in the regular season for him to seriously challenge for this position. Still The King for now.  **(2) Kawhi Leonard** - Incredible two-way guy who is unguardable when hot. His questionable health prevents him from being #1.  **(3) Kevin Durant** - Absurdly good scorer. Can get a bucket in a multitude of ways. But he's third because he's not an elite defender and people who shed their skin once a month are creepy.  **(4) Jimmy Butler** - Jimmy G Buckets. The G stands for Gets. He's a closer, a good on-ball defender and a great team player.  **(5) Paul George** - I think he had a career year in 2019 because Russ decided to defer to him as a top scoring option. He's a streaky guy who's not as good a shot-creator as the top three guys in this list. I think him and Jimmy are very close tbh.  **(6) Khris Middleton** - Isn't marketable. Plays in a small market. Overshadowed by his MVP teammate. Still a good sharpshooting two-way guy who is reliable at what he does.  **(7) Tobias Harris** - When you consider how valuable excellent wings are, then Tobias and Khris' contracts make a lot more sense. These guys are in the tier below some of the greatest players in the league. Tobias is just another good all-around dude.  **(8) Bojan Bogdanovic** - Insanely efficient scorer and has been doing it longer than the guys in the next two positions.  **(9) Brandon Ingram** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(10) Jaylen Brown** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.   Power Forward:  **(1) Giannis Antetokounmpo** - is a force of nature.  **(2) Anthony Davis** - Most obvious #2 in any position lol.  **(3) Pascal Siakam** - Is currently in his breakthrough year but needs to maintain his form against top teams. Will make All-NBA this year.  **(4) Draymond Green** -Is fantastic at everything but scoring.  **(5) LaMarcus Aldridge** - Game is passing him by but he's still delivering.  **(6) Blake Griffin** - was very good last year but he needs to stay healthy  **(7) Kristaps Porzingis** - Ihas been very good this year but he needs to stay healthy.  **(8) Jayson Tatum** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(9) PJ Tucker** -Mr Iron-man. Great defender. Good shooter. Elite-tier role player.  **(10) Marcus Morris** - is currently shooting 47% from three in January. He made my top 10 on that alone lol.   Center:  **(1) Joel Embiid** - Can put up 27/13 while providing DPOY level defence. Can be a monster against anyone not named Gasol.  **(2) Rudy Gobert** - Averages 15 points while being maybe the best defender in the league. It's very close between him and Jokic.  **(3) Nikola Jokic** - Arguably the best playmaking center of all-time. I don't rate him that much on defence though. It's very close between him and Gobert.  **(4) Karl Anthony Towns** -Excellent offensive force but he's a negative defender in one of the most crucial positions. He needs to improve on that front.  **(5) Nikola Vucevic** - Doesn't get the attention he deserves because of small market. He's a 20/10 guy who's a top defender.  **(6) Deandre Ayton** - This kid is a stud but people don't know it yet because he's bad at peeing.  **(7) Bam Adebayo** - He's recently taken a leap but I just need him to do it for longer and to pepper in some great performances against top teams.  **(8) Clint Capela** - Kinda how I'd imagine Drummond to play on a good team.  **(9) Andre Drummond** - Has never had a good guard/roster to play with but has managed to impress regardless. I reckon he could take a major leap forward within the right system. I really hopes he goes to the Hawks.   **(10) Josef Nurkic** - Trailblazers fan will @ me if I omit him so Nurkic gets the #10 spot by default. Sorry Sabonis."
Enes Kanter = Penis Cancer   Dion Waiters = Dijon “The Mustard Man” Waiters (what me and my buddies called him in college lol idk)  Timothy Luwau Cabarrot - Jason Waterfalls (TLC)   Kevin Durant - bitch  Corliss Williamson - Scoreless Williamson
Oh come on now. We are talking about Kevin Durant.
I mean it's not nearly as crazy an opinion as you're making it out to be.  Give this article a read:  https://www.si.com/nba/2019/05/29/draymond-green-warriors-raptors-2019-nba-finals-stephen-curry-kevin-durant
NFL has it and isn’t usually a problem. Sometimes you end up with a less deserving story/rebound but usually it’s good.  Next year it can probably be Kevin Durant. Recently it could have been Derrick Rose.
Kevin Durant? Don’t actually know about any direct quotes but I mean he left for a reason.
You don't ever win by not signing Kevin fucking Durant.
"no they'd still be awful this year (even worse since no D-Lo) and get a top pick in June, but they'd have Kevin fucking Durant next year instead of D-Lo."
&gt; tall wings who aren’t very quick  Kevin Durant? Not quick? the fuck
"Or imagine if they somehow traded Westbrook and Nate Robinson (9M Salary) for Kawhi Leonard, Goran Dragic, Kyle Lowry and picks (9M salary)  OKC could roll out a lineup of:   PG: Goran Dragic / Kyle Lowry  SG: James Harden / Reggie Jackson  SF: Kawhi Leonard / Thabo Sefolosha  PF: Kevin Durant / Nick Collison  C: Serge Ibaka / Kendrick Perkins"
"I can see where they're coming from though. Even if they absolutely **had** to move one of our two teams, I think the Kings were the ones that deserved to go.   The Sonics were around in Seattle way longer than the Kings have been in Sac (they started in 68 and the Kings moved to Sac in 1985)  Also, the Sonics won a title in the late 70's. They had a long legacy of being a consistently good to great team.  They drafted Fred Brown, Dennis Johnson, Jack Sikma, Vinnie Johnson, Xavier McDaniel, Nate McMillan, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Rashard Lewis, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook.  A good number of those are Hall of Fame players and the rest in the group are ""hall of very good"". The number the Kings could boast would be much smaller.  Sacramento's crowning achievement is the playoff runs of the early 00's, which are still the stuff of legends around here, but the longevity of that run doesn't really compare to the Sonics making the Finals in 96 and going head to head with the Rockets Jazz, and Spurs through most of the mid 90's (though I'd argue the best version of the Greatest Show on Court could beat the best version of those Sonics teams).  Our team has also been terribly mismanaged compared to the Sonics organization. I don't want to get into the weeds too far, but the Maloofs were the first team to get us anywhere near a long playoff run, and that was 15 years after the team moved here. After that little run imploded they fired our amazing GM for no reason and proceeded to bleed every ounce of cash out of the team they could as attendance and enthusiasm depleted. We were damn lucky Vivek came and bought us up (as crazy as the dude is) because we were on life support.  And to top all of that off, Seattle is a gigantic city when compared to Sac.  I love my city and my team, and I would be devastated if they left,  But it makes no logical sense why the Sonics lost their team and we kept ours, and the fact that we did was a complete ""oops we fucked up, lets make it up to the next smaller market team"" move by Stern."
I’m sorry? But KD missed one game against the Rockets when they were already up 3-2 on the Rockets. Klay Thompson actually played every game in that series.  The Raptors wouldn’t have beaten a fully loaded warrior team considering they lost the only game Kevin Durant played.
They said that about Kevin Durant and then he joined the Nets.
Westbrook gave you 23/10a/7r on 36/32/88 splits with 4.6 TOs in the playoffs and I was told he was trash and it was his fault we lost that series.   I hope yall end up in the lottery and whiff on the next Kevin Durant again.
"So what does KD not playing this year for a team that isn’t the warriors have to do with them at all?   I don’t give a fuck about the warriors, I want to watch Kevin Durant play. Y’all warrior fans want to hold on to any relevance left haha"
Well for starters we had Kevin Durant who he's basically a generational score carrying   the loads for two people . Then you have Russell Westbrook who can't shoot but can score. It is really hard to find another guy that good as Kevin Durant for starters and we still didn't win like it was really rough in the fourth quarter when people world double KD and leave Andrew Robinson wide open.   But more importantly fergus's defense is not as good as Robertson and I actually do not remember Robertson finishing multiple games with zero points yet he's a really good cutter and a can actually finish Ferguson I don't know he's just I just don't understand how you can manage to play 30-plus minutes and finish with zero points multiple games  Sorry for the typos using voice to text

"Another quote  On the night of the 2007 NBA draft lottery, David Stern sat in the temporary bleachers lining the NBA's Secaucus, New Jersey, television studios and seethed. The three finalists had been revealed for a chance to draft Greg Oden and Kevin Durant with the Nos. 1 and 2 picks: Portland, Seattle and Atlanta.  ""The Pacific Northwest and the god-damn Deep South,"" Stern snarled in a hushed voice. ""Give me a big market!"""

"Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
"Sonics were so fun to watch, back when I used to live in Seattle that was the first NBA team I watched in person.   They had a rookie Kevin Durant that year and everyone was so hyped about him, then the team got relocated the following year and it was pretty disappointing. Hope Seattle gets a team sometime this decade."
"3 and D are players that are there to shoot 3s and defend players, guys like Danny Green lol not fucking Kevin Durant who’s one of the most dynamic scorers ever"
Maybe Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant doesn’t play for the warriors. If you’re talking that way we might be the most injured team in the league rn.
ah yes Jusuf Nurkic Rodney Hood and I don't even know who that is Collins is comparable to losing Kevin Durant Steph Curry and Klay Thompson
"Again, CP3 was not a normal defensive PG, he regularly defended guys like Kevin Durant."

Maybe now but I feel like down the road when people look back on Kevin Durant  people will appreciate and come to a majority opinion that a 7 foot guy who does everything a 6 6 guy does and more was objectively a better basketball player
Give him 8 years of Kevin Durant and he has multiple.
Regular season is always fun to watch. Ton of upsets and shit. I didn't watch the playoffs cause fuck Kevin Durant

"Even with a Finals MVP  Robert Horry has a better Hall of Fame resume than Andre Iguodala.  Golden State Warriors, for their 3 rings in 4 years deserve to have four players in the Hall of Fame. That is Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. That is the whole list of golden state Hall of Famers that are there because of this run that they had."
you named literally no free agent besides kevin durant who signed after the period i listed. please just shut the fuck.
Kevin Durant joined the chat
Kevin Durant was already on a winning team. Nobody is arguing Beal has to win a championship here.
"comments like this are what get Kevin Durant to join the Warriors. Fans are fuckin weird, these guys can't ever win."
What’s your point here? You already took an L on the playoff series bit. KD and Kyrie came here over the Knicks for a reason. We went from having no future to now having Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
The Rockets still caught a break with the Iguodala injury prior to the Paul injury.  But scratch that.  The following year the Warriors lost Kevin fucking Durant partway through Game 5 and the Rockets couldn't protect home court in game 6.  Come on.  The Rockets got a huge break and still couldn't do anything with it.
We are all Kevin Durant on this blessed day
I'm also not Kevin Durant and I think he's
Small ball with 7 foot Kevin Durant ok
Steph Curry  Paul George  Kawhi Leonard  Kevin Durant  Nikola Jokic  you run the offense through Jokic and use a shitload of off-ball movement
Everyone on /r/NBA is Kevin Durant except you.
Okay fine im Kevin Durant there you have it
"I'm not Kevin Durant but personally I think he has every right to do what he wants, and he works really hard. He's a great player and  shouldn't have got so much hate for going to Golden State, you'd have done the same thing if you were me. I mean, him."
"Ill challenge that by saying Kevin Durant, his sycophant friend Rich Kleiman, and Bill Simmons are up there."
Steph Curry  James Harden  Kevin Durant  LeBron James  Joel Embiid
Imagine r/nba is just Kevin Durant arguing with Kevin Durant   That’s a world I want to live in
We are all Kevin Durant burners.
Let the record show that Kevin W. Durant is now completely nude
Kevin Durant could pay me a small sum and I’d get his back on social media like a relentless hound dog for the rest of my days.   What’s that?  Who’s the goat?  KD.
That Kevin Durant guy is super cringe guys amirite
We are all Kevin Durant and we can’t win with these cats
There is no /r/nba. It's just you and Kevin Durant arguing.
Lol have you ever watched Kevin Durant?
"The best thing to ever happen to Kevin Durant was the Cavs deciding to double team and commit to Curry in back to back Finals series. Imagine all this without his ""tWO FmVPs"" excuse..."
Kd like a fuckin kid grow the fuck up!! Who gives a fuck what Klay do... you’re Kevin Durant arguably the best scorer in the league. He a walking bucket
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2714146-stephen-curry-on-friendship-with-kevin-durant-feel-like-im-on-a-dating-show  When I search for stuff on steph curry talking about the relationship with KD, this is the main thing that pops up. And some other articles of steph praising KD, or vice versa. Would you mind providing a source for your claim?"
"I mean, I think it depends on the context of the situation. If you will *always* believe a journalist over KD regardless of the situation, then I think that  you are likely a fairly biased observer.  &gt; Reporting what Kevin Durant does isn't ""KD bashing"" just because it makes him look bad.   Depends. To use an example from this thread, look at KD's claim that the media doesn't care about Klay skipping out on media obligations.   *Assuming that's true* (I have no way of knowing if it is or isn't, although I'd think if it was made up than Strauss would have refuted it), that suggests that skipping out on media obligations isn't actually that big of a deal.   If it isn't that big of a deal but they make it out to be a big/bigger deal when KD does it, then that's something I might see as bashing. It's like if I work at a job where lots of other people show up late all the time and nobody gives a fuck.   If I show up one day and people instantly start caring, going around broadcasting it and acting like it is a problem, then I'm probably going to assume they are intentionally trying to cause me trouble. I mean, why else would they not care when everyone else does it but then go out of their way to broadcast it to everyone when *I* do it?  Again, not sure if that's what actually happened or not. Just using this hypothetical since it related to the claims in the thread title."
"What kind of fool would believe KD over a journalist? Reporting what Kevin Durant does isn't ""KD bashing"" just because it makes him look bad."
They were a great team because they had Kevin Durant. They became irrelevant once he left. You can't win important playoff games with Westbrook as your best player.  And? You can absolutely win a chip with Westbrook as your second best player. You can’t just remove your best player and still expect to win a chip. They won 47 games.   It’s not a double standard at all. Lebron faced similar caliber opponents and won 3 chips. Durant left a great team to form the best team ever and won 2 chips. Also the goat argument for lebron is because he’s just flat out a much better player than KD over the course of his career. KD will be a clear top 15 player ever by the time his career is over.   Also it annoys me when people say super team to mean both a great team and a team not created “organically” because the thunder were just as much of a super team as the heat and Cavs from a player talent perspective. If you are just using super team in the one of your stars being a free agent then the 2013 Lakers are a shitty super team.
"&gt; That was absolutely a great team.  They were a great team because they had Kevin Durant. They became irrelevant once he left. You can't win important playoff games with Westbrook as your best player.  &gt; Also, lebron gets an absolute shit ton of disrespect despite proving himself time and time again.  Not compared to KD. People make a GOAT case even though he's 3-6 in the Finals and never won without orchestrating a super team, which is not terribly different from KD joining one. There's a bit of a double-standard there."
"Strauss has had a hate boner for KD for a loooong time. He once wrote a ridiculous long-winded article for ESPN that the only person that could stop Steph Curry was Kevin Durant.  Steph went on to average 26 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists, and 2 steals in the Finals as part of a 16-1 dominant run through the playoffs.  If you get your Durant takes from Ethan Strauss, you might as well get your LeBron news from Skip Bayless."
"&gt; Because Ethan Strauss said so?  Yeah, a prominent and highly regarded NBA reporter's sourced book is just a bunch of bullshit he made up to make Kevin Durant look bad. That's something that could actually happen. Totally."
so kevin durant doesnt count as a current player but tacko makes it in with 24 total minutes played
"Kd is going down as a top 15 player.   His TS in the regular season is 61.3. His TS in the playoffs is 59.7. Basically the same. There’s a reason he’s won two FMVPs, and was on a historic playoff run last year until he got hurt.   It’s Kevin Durant. Teams are very scared of prime KF."
"Goddamn Kevin Durant is so fucking good at basketball.  I hope he comes back just as good. His workout videos look incredible for what is considered a serious career speedbump and alterer.  Edit: Also LeBron’s footwork one that possession KD was guarding him, that’s so not what I think of when I picture LeBron’s playstyle goddamn that was good. He’s so fucking versatile"
"&gt;	The nine Klutch players are naturally led by LeBron James and include John Wall, Kentavious-Caldwell Pope, Dejounte Murray, Miles Bridges, Darius Bazley, Darius Garland, Terrance Ferguson and Trey Lyles.

Yeah saying Kevin Durant would sign with this team would freak me out. Good thing he didn’t or else it would’ve ruined the NBA
"I know the answer is likely Kentucky or Duke but honorable mention to University of Texas who has: Kevin Durant, LaMarcus Aldridge, Mo Bamba, Tristan Thompson, Avery Bradley, PJ Tucker, Myles Turner, Jarrett Allen, after Kentucky they may have some of the best bigs in the league, Obviously Kentucky has KAT, AD, Bam, Julius Randle, Boogie, WCS etc."
"Or Kevin Durant getting into arguments on IG/Twitter with regular fans about how good Kevin Durant is, but, get this, Kevin Durant is pretending he's someone else!"
"Here’s a more recent article with Kerr telling Chris Haynes how distant KD was. Well after Strauss wrote that article. Said it didn’t surprise him KD left   https://m.sfgate.com/warriors/article/kevin-durant-steve-kerr-warriors-free-agency-nba-14962704.php  No real reason to doubt Strauss’ credibility as someone that hangs around the team for a job, obviously has connections and also communicates regularly with other Warriors best writers."
"Serge Ibaka on KD in 2016: ""If he were an animal in the jungle Kevin Durant could lie out on the biggest rock and I would attack him, I would steal his eggs"""
"The right/easy answers are definitely Duke and Kentucky. Outside of that I think Texas probably has the best team.  DJ Augustine, Avery Bradley, Kevin Durant, PJ Tucker, LaMarcus Aldridge  Bench of: Jarret Allen, Myles Turner, Tristan Thompson, Cory Joseph"
"Definitely not calling you out, but there’s multiple pictures with them standing next to each other. Just honestly still not sure how they come up with heights.

"I'm not entirely sure what you're getting at. What are you going to believe, official measurements or a random picture taken from an angle?      [Boogie's height](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2859211-lakers-news-official-heights-for-lebron-james-anthony-davis-and-more-revealed)      [KD's height](https://www.si.com/nba/2019/10/18/kevin-durant-height)"
Until Kevin Durant came along
"There’s a clear distinction that you (and many people) fail to make :  lebron did not join a super team. He helped create one.  Joining a super team is what Durant did. Do you think that kawhi joined a super team going to the clippers? Or that Kevin Garnett did by forming with Boston?  Or Anthony Davis by joining lebron?   All these teams were mediocre at best until, surprise, they acquired good players. The only superstar who ever joined a super team was Kevin Durant. End of story."
"It was also like a perception thing. Whether a team had a ‘legit 7-footer’ versus an “undersized” (aka 6’10”) center was an actual debate topic up until like 2009 lol. Like 6’11” Tim Duncan playing center was considered a smallball lineup when smallball lineups were not viewed as a good thing in NBA basketball.   Also, a bit of the converse side of this, but how Kevin Durant didn’t like when he was categorized by his actual height (closer to 7ft) because the stigma of 7-footers being slow and unathletic."
"&gt; established Sampson as one of basketball’s ultimate “What if?” talents. Imagine today’s Oklahoma City Thunder **never fulfilling their potential**, getting sidetracked by injuries and drugs, **wiping their roster clean**, then winning championships with an aged Kevin Durant nearly a decade later.  Had to take a look at the date this was written, lol. 2012."
Kevin Durant has been located.
Kyrie Irving Klay Thompson Kevin Durant Blake Griffin  Karl Towns
Not really. They basically blew up at the exact same time. The only difference was Kevin Durant took a lot of the attention away from Russ
The also won a championship and made back to back finals wo Kevin Durant Js
"Yeah, he's saying 'if you truly believe the right move in that situation is to drive headfirst blindly into Draymond Green and Kevin Durant and try make a play at the rim, when you have one of the best shooters of all time wide open in the corner, purely because you're 'the Man' on your team, then you clearly have no clue what you're talking about'."
In game 1 it seemed like the Cavs were using their scheme from the 2016 finals and were acting like Harrison Barnes was out there instead of Kevin Durant
"dawg, warriors top 5 goes  1. Rick Barry  2. Kevin Durant  3. Wilt  4. Chris Mullin  5. Steph/ Monta interchangeably   Like, unanimously"
"They say Kevin Durant looks like he was intelligently designed for basketball, but Kawhi looks like he was also intelligently designed for basketball, just a different type of basketball."
Kevin Durant
"Lol one of the most efficient scorers ever? Hell yes I do. But it’s not even slightly abt who I like watching. I like watching melo too, but the question is would d wade and cp3 take the same amount of shit as melo if they were in his situation? I say no, because people had legit criticism for Melos game that isn’t there for wade cp3 and definitely Kevin Durant lmao"
"Michael Jordan, magic, Shaq, Tim Duncan, LeBron, Kareem, bird, Kobe, Kevin Durant, kawhi Leonard, Willis Reed  That's the full list man. Only guys that aren't top 20 all time are Willis Reed (60s) and kawhi (active player)"
"No way it goes the same way. These aren't the Kyrie Nets, they're the Kevin Durant Nets. I like the way that sounds."
Kevin Durant joining a 73-9 team
Kevin Durant would like a word
"I think it's interesting/cool that nobody is mentioning any Warriors. Speaks well of both the team's prospects and the culture they've created there.   But my vote is for (former Warrior) Kevin Durant. If things go south in Houston, I'd expect to see an aging James Harden jumping onto a bandwagon somewhere."
I think Kevin Durant has a claim as well
It pains me to admit it but Curry is not anywhere near the player Durant is...... Curry is a special player. But Kevin Durant is making a genuine case for being LeBron level good. Curry is great but not to their level.
If KD didn't have chemistry issues he wouldn't have left GS in the first place. The thing is he's still Kevin fucking Durant so it doesn't matter when he drops at least 20 a night.
"Gary Payton, Baron Davis, JR Smith, Kyle Lowry, Allen Iverson, Kemba Walker, Wilson Chandler, Jimmy Butler, Kevin Durant, Udonis Haslem, Dwyane Wade, Kyrie Irving and Patrick Beverly"
None of those guys are Kevin Durant lol
On an already historic team. It really feels like the trio of Curry Green and Thompson featuring Kevin Durant
"I like how this viewed in this lens.  Kevin Durant had no business taking less shots than Russ. If KD wanted to shoot 70 times a game, our entire organization/team/coach would have let him.  Go ask KD why he only took 1 more shot than Russ."
"I didn’t know that, but Kevin Durant was definitely not told beforehand and he was blindsided with the same scenario at warm ups during a playoff series."
Jaren Jackson has a combo of blocks and 3 pointers made that only Kevin Durant has also done. Problem is Jaren Jackson is a specialist and that is all he does and doesn't rebound and playmake.
Did you know both Kevin Durant and Kobe said Tony Allen was the toughest defender to play against? I can’t think of a higher compliment to his defense
Mike Conley  CJ McCollum  Jaylen brown  Kevin Durant  Myles Turner
"Firstly, I googled “2000s kids shows” and browsed until I saw a show with two or more titular characters, then I went to basketball-reference.com/friv/teammates_and_opponents and the name that yielded the fewest results was Kevin, so I went through every Kevin to play in the NBA looking for teammates named Joe and Nick. Kevin Durant was the only Kevin to have both a teammate named Nick and a teammate named Joe *at all, let alone at the same time.* Joe Smith played 35 games for the OKC Thunder in 2008 so I went to his game log and looked through the play-by-play of each game. Because Smith and Collison both played center the trio didn’t share the floor until the 4th game of the season."

"You shouldn't get downvoted, lebron and Kevin durant would thrive in the 90s and 80s with illegal defence rule and the no zone defence"
i mean when lebron joined the heat and called it a superteam wasnt it because he joined 2 other all stars? same with kevin durant?
"I will die on the hill that if Lebron gets called for a foul on Kevin Durant in game 2 in 2012 and the thunder win, that series goes to 7 and i would take the thunder to win that series. Games 3 and 4 were mad close and could have gone either way."
Not at all. One article was written and public outcry led to a retraction. [Source:](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/nba/2014/05/01/oklahoman-apologizes-calling-thunders-kevin-durant-mr-unreliable)
"Personally I think it goes 7. I see Paul George as a *significant* upgrade on Kevin Love.  He can stretch the floor just as well as Love but now you have someone else that can create their own shot off the dribble, not only isn't a defensive liability but is actually a strong plus on the defensive end and can defend Kevin Durant"

"Dwight Howard made himself like that in the gym. He was incredibly strong and athletic which led to his stretch of dominance with the Magic. There’s just no place in the game anymore for bigmen who just dunk, block and rebound. These days you need to be able to shoot free throws, mid range, pass the ball... etc. every position is expected to have point guard skills these days and you can thank Kevin Durant for that."

"   &gt;Harden's last 4 playoffs (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) have ended by him breaking the playoffs single game turnover record with 13 turnovers, getting blown out by 33 points by a team missing their best player due to injury, getting blown out at home by 39 points by a team missing their best player due to injury in addition to missing their starting point guard. Harden was also extremely inefficient in the Blazers series in 2014.   **2012:** Harden choked in the Finals when he played for OKC.   **2013:** Harden choked in the first round against a team missing Westbrook. Harden shot 7/22 at home in the elimination game against an OKC team missing Westbrook.   **2014:** Harden choked in the first round losing the first two games at home to the Blazers. Harden had an extremely inefficient series. Harden had 1 made field goal for 2 points, 0 free throws made, and 0 assists in the last 18 minutes of 2014 game 6 in a close game.   **2015:** Harden choked again. Harden got benched in a elimination game in the previous round and needed Josh Smith/Corey Brewer/Dwight to save him. Then in the next round against the Warriors, the Rockets lost by 35 at home in game 3 and Harden was terrible. Harden broke the record for most turnovers in a playoff game ever in game 5, and the Rockets were eliminated.   **2016:** Harden choked and got blown out multiple times by a team missing Curry (reigning back to back league MVP at the time).   **2017:** Harden choked against a team missing Kawhi and Parker. Harden lost by 39 points at home in game 6 to a Spurs team missing Kawhi and Parker and got eliminated. Harden had 3 times as many turnovers than field goals made in game 6. Harden lost at home by 39 points to a team missing a consensus top 5 player and best 2 way player in the league. After the game, 5 Hall of Fame players said Harden quit.   **2018:** Harden shoots 24 percent from 3 and goes 0-22 from three at one point during the wcf. Had Houston looking to Eric Gordon for ball movements and scoring late in games 6-7-   **2019** Harden shoots 58.3% from free throws &amp; caused 6 turnovers which accounted 10 points for a Golden State Warriors team without Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins and a depleted bench. Never mind that Harden missed plenty defensive assignments (which doesn't shows in box score) and that offensive foul against Dray with the remaining 2 minutes left during 4th quarter in a one possession game was inexcusable."
Kevin Durant
"Primary ball handler, OFF THE BENCH!!! Did you forget about Kevin Durant being one that team? Or a hot headed Westbrook who’s talent hadn’t matched his ego yet? Harden was a top 20 player regardless because of the super team dynamic there wasn’t any other competition really."
"  &gt;you're either agreeing with me or idk what this means  It means the top 3 guys were great (still not *as* good tho), but after that the Heat were not playing guys at the level of the Warriors.  &gt;when did i act like anything?  When you said:  &gt;relative to the leagues they were in it's really not that big of a disparity  ...in your comment it sounded like you were suggesting the league had changed a lot... This is verbiage people use when comparing modern players to Wilt  &gt;*fit is huge part of context*  &gt;no it's not- the post is about how both teams are loaded top to bottom with talent  Agree to disagree. I think fit can be as valuable as talent if not moreso.   &gt;yeah, because he meshes well in that system and his skillset is maximized... he's more valuable AFTER THE FACT, their perceptions were changed AFTER the teams used them properly/misused them and won/lost... how would he know? does kevin wayne durant have a crystal ball?  73-9"
"&gt;heatles had top-end talent but ran thin faster than the dubs?  you're either agreeing with me or idk what this means  &gt;don't act like  when did i act like anything?  &gt;fit is huge part of context  no it's not- the post is about how both teams are loaded top to bottom with talent  &gt;draymond is a DPOY  yeah, because he meshes well in that system and his skillset is maximized  he's more valuable AFTER THE FACT, their perceptions were changed AFTER the teams used them properly/misused them and won/lost  &gt;crucially, KD *knew*  how would he *know*? does kevin wayne durant have a crystal ball?"
"No, that's how teams defended the Warriors at times, just ignoring Kevin fucking Durant to focus in on Steph Curry."
Exactly Kevin Durant joined one of the greatest teams of all time and made them the best team of all time (2nd best team of all time at worst)
Check if his name is Kevin Durant or not
How is comparing warriors with steph and KD and warriors with just steph a good comparison? No one out here saying Kevin Durant is a net negative.  Curry has the dumbest haters who like these bad faith arguments a lot.  2+1=3. 3&gt;2 doesn't mean 1&gt;2. Go back to elementary.
I mean if you want to talk about the best player who can shoot from anywhere on the court that's Kevin Durant not Jordan.
Are we all just forgetting KD walking to the rim over and over again because they were key'd in on defending steph. KD was literally walking in and dunking/getting layups with no one around him. Kevin motherfucking Durant was getting a clear path to the hoop over and over because teams were defending Curry.
How convenient that he became a better passer out of traps when Kevin freaking Durant joined the team. Surely no defensive attention was paid to him that made it easier on teammates of his.

"When I woke up on the day of the Western Conference Finals, I was more excited than a 6 year old on Christmas. Playoffs was going great, and my favorite team had the number one seed in the west! I was absolutely hot and bothered by at the thought of winning the championship. But with all the great teams that were playing only one team had my attention: Golden State. I mean, who wouldn't want to defeat the best team in recent years. For months I had been watching highlight videos on YouTube and reading articles. I was fully committed to the Rockets. I prayed every night that the Warriors would fall to the Rockets and that we would be the next face of the NBA. I was, in fact, in love with the Rockets. When it was time for the Conference Finals I was extremely nervous. I locked myself in my room and sat on the bed hiding everything but my eyes under a blanket. I was almost certain that the Warriors are not going to be defeated, but I heard rumors that Kevin Durant is ruining the Warriors with his iso ball. It was actually going to happen. The Warriors was going to fall to the Rockets! When we were about to go up 3-2, I was on the verge of tears. The strongest team in years was going to fall to my team. But as the Rockets were closing out the game my dreams turned into a nightmare. Chris fucking Paul came on to the floor and did something that to this day haunt me: he grabbed his hamstring and limped off the floor. I instantly fell into a deep state of depression. I cried for the first time since my cat Broccoli died. I was completely lost. Fast forward to the Finals and the Warriors is looking like they are blowing out the Cavs every game while the Rockets is recruiting Carmelo Anthony. Now don't get me wrong I really like the Rockets playoff run and hope we continue to succeed, but it could have been so much better. Everytime I see the picture of the Warriors holding the trophy, a tear comes to my eye. I have a picture of teary-eyed Chris Paul saying ""H-Town, we're coming home"" after Game 4 on my bedside table that I kiss every night. Anyway I won't rant any longer I'm sorry for wasting your time. Christmas is ruined."
What are you talking about bro no one has forgotten how good kevin durant is lmao.
To be clear your point here is that if your social media account is a particular nickname then that means you refer to yourself as that nickname?  For example you think Kevin Durant calls himself easymoneysniper?
"Bron and Kyrie scored the same amount of points, so the points category should be tied instead of just showing Bron. And my comment wasn’t a dig at OP, it was to show how the media gives LeBron all the props so fanboys like yourself can cream yourself while ignoring anything noteworthy that his teammates did. Just further proving [KD’s comments](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-calls-environment-playing-with-lebron-james-toxic-says-it-ventures-beyond-the-basketball-court/amp/)"
"Not in the least lol. D’Lo was great in his two short years here, but he was and is no less injury prone. And he obviously doesn’t come close to Kyrie’s caliber as a player when both are healthy. Oh, and Kevin Durant."
"Even that’d be fine, compared to the actual Deron Williams situation, where the nets traded all their draft picks away to keep him happy enough to re-sign the super max, and then again to fortify a supposed super team around DWill as the number one guy. Kyrie was never meant to be more than a number 2 for Kevin Durant."
It really feels like Kevin Durant doesn’t even play for the Nets
Kevin Durant
The idea of a 32-year-old Kevin Durant devolving into Brooklyn Paul Pierce (who was 36) after this injury would genuinely make me sad. He's supposed to be in his prime dammit
Just sit out man ... everything will get way easier when you add Kevin fucking Durant to the equation
It's because Kevin Durant made the weakest move in NBA history. His comments will always be judged with that information in mind.
"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2837508-giannis-antetokounmpo-net-worth-breaking-down-salary-shoe-contract-and-more  is it a new contract than this one? cause this one doesn't seem that inspiring. per this article the big dogs make more than 9 mil a year:  https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779254-stephen-curry-net-worth-breaking-down-his-salary-shoe-contract-and-more   Also, nike will throw 10 mill a year at him to keep someone else from signing him. That is very much in their wheelhouse.   &gt;Considering what Harden ($200 million), Kevin Durant (an estimated $300 million) and LeBron James (possibly more than $1 billion) are making on their shoe deals, does anyone believe Curry's deal is still for only $4 million a year?"
"See Damian Lillard, Steph Curry, James Harden, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, Klay Thompson"
Ingra- I mean Kevin Durant
You’ll get burned at the stake for thinking that the warriors aren’t contenders once Steph and Klay come back.   Those pre-KD warriors teams were stacked from top to bottom. Their bench could beat a lot of starting fives that year. Then they lost some of that depth but it didn’t matter since they got Kevin fucking Durant.   Why is it so outrageous to think that the warriors might struggle next year.
Lebron lost to the best team of all time lead by Kevin Durant.
Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant isn’t getting any love, but that dude did come up clutch in the playoffs for Golden State.   Always one of the best scorers in NBA history with a complete scoring package"
"Say what you want about Kevin Durant, yea he’s a bit insecure and says some things that most people would say he should keep to himself but at the end of the day he’s one of the best players we’ve ever seen and honestly seems like a really good guy. I give him shit for joining the warriors as much as anyone else but at the same time I appreciate the player he is and what he’s done for the sport. I hope he can come back &amp; be the same killer he was before the injury."
Are you referring to why Kevin Durant wears 35? Because his old high school coach passed away when he was 35. I recall Eric Thomas mentioning that in one of his videos.
Marc Gasol/ Kevin Durant
One of the many bizarre trends of the internet is everyone posting is allowed to hate on anything and everything. But when someone *outside* of the forum/reddit post hates on anything it's now petty and uncalled for.  Best example of this here is Kevin Durant. You'd think he was found guilty of murder based on a lot of comments here. But when a first take/undisputed throws shade to get some views (which is the standard game plan for these shows)... The internet will be all over that receding hairline
Not everyone is Kevin Durant.
Nets supporting cast are underrated. When Levert goes off on a run its actually pretty ridiculous  Now imagine adding a healthy Kyrie and Kevin Durant to the mix
"Why really iverson? 27 points per game and an 11 time all star. He's a true great.  It's not disrespectful to say Thomas was one of the greatest players of all time but just did not belong in the GOAT conversation.  Your top 12, i agree no need to debate.  Next tier, again i mostly agree but you omitted some:   Where is David Robinson? Elgin Baylor? Charles Barkley? Havlicek? Hayes? Garnett? Wade?  Most experts would have those guys ahead of Thomas. They are barely off the top tier. Should i say you're disrespecting them?  What about the modern greats? Are you really gona put him above Kevin Durant the best pure scorer of this generation and perhaps ever? What about curry, he revolutionised the game and won rings hes at least as good as thomas was. And lets not forget chris paul who gets overlooked but has been incredibly valuable over his career. Harden seems to be in his prime buy i'd say already pushing close to the second tier.   So I do disagree. Maybe thomas could make it into the top 30 but it would be very tight. He's just not top tier or 2nd tier. Truth is hes third tier, which is still great but pales in comparison to the absolute greatest."
"&gt; he argued that Kevin Durant would be a bench rider if he played back in the 80’s  I'm sorry, but he's delusional. Don't take him seriously when it comes to sports."
"His agent setting an office there.  This news is from February but this was talked about in October, November too [link](https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-company-moving-office-180003549.html)"
Yeah James Harden is cool but have you heard about Kevin Durant
"They replaced Harrison Barnes with KD.   Lebron has had Kyrie and DWade, yes, but that +1 all star makes a huge difference. Imagine the 2010-2014 Heat, only they have Klay Thompson lol. Chris Bosh and Kevin Love are the equivalent of Draymond, having that 4th all star just makes the deck not just stacked in your favor, but ridiculously stacked in your favor.   If Klay wasn’t on the Warriors then KD’s stats would be a lot more impressive. But as I said, put Klay on any of Lebrons super teams...and you have your Durant warriors equivalent  Also, Lebron beat the 73 win team with Kyrie and a Kevin Love averaging 9-7 on 34% lol"
"The difference between ""pass to KD and let him shoot from the logo"" and ""penetrate and pass out"" is academic, but KD deciding to straight up sabotage the play because he didn't get the ball is more of an issue that whatever Draymond did.   Also considering that KD isn't willing to ever [shoot heaves](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1526943-kevin-durant-claims-he-wont-always-shoot-high-risk-buzzer-beater-shots), giving him the ball in that situation is probably the worse option. KD waits until the buzzer sounds and then shoots a second later."
"Well Draymond obviously just doesn't like Kevin Durant. Makes sense considering he's a real ass dude and KD is fake as fuck and softer than silk. Draymond didn't address his most interesting comments to KD which were ""we dont fucking need you bitch and we never needed you"" lmao if you read his lips thats what he was saying to him"
"Even in Draymond recount I still think kevin is in the right. Draymond got offended because arguably the best scorer of this generation told his FRIEND to ""pass him the fucking ball"". He wanted a please and thank you? Fuck Draymond for such a ""hooper"" you sure do have a dillusional perspective on proffesional sports and the way these generational talents address their teammates. Fuck, sports period guys would say shit like this all the time in hockey, baseball, basketball, volleyball, football, whatever when I played. If you are offended the mean words hurt you mr, triple single not giving KD the ball, bring it up to him after the game and not literally on the fucking bench. I stg draymond is the dumbest fucking guy in the history of the NBA. If I was an all star for basically nothing but my defensive capabilities and kevin Durant, who I consider a friend according to Draymond here, tells me to pass him the fucking ballz I'm giving my head a shake and wondering what the fuck I was doing with the rock when KD is apparently open and trying to score."
Spurs vs Lakers: dominated the West in the 2000s. Shaq/Kobe vs Duncan/Robinson. Kobe/Pau/Odom vs Duncan/Parker/Ginobili. Best coaches in modern era Phil Jackson vs Gregg Popovich  Thunder vs Warriors: the obvious Kevin Durant vs Russell Westbrook rivalry. 2016 WCF was one of the best series of the decade. Steph vs Russ is always a good matchup.  Lebron vs Celtics: Lebron could never get past the Celtics from 2008-2010. Lebron vs Pierce was always a good matchup during that time. Bron makes Big Three in Miami to get past Celtics. KG/Pierce/Allen/Rondo vs Lebron/Wade/Bosh. Ray Allen dips Boston to join Lebron in Miami and wins a ring with him. Cavs vs Celtics ECF in 2017 and 2018. Young Celtics take Lebron to 7 games in 2018 but Lebron prevails.
"I'm sorry Dray but that's just how it is. You said it yourself to Paul Pierce. You're not Kevin Durant, if you want the perks and the wiggle room of someone like Kevin Durant....be as good as Kevin Durant."
PG - Magic SG - Klay SF - Kawhi PF - Kevin Durant C - Jokic  Too lazy to do the bench.
"Here's what we all know already and hasn't changed:  1. Draymond made the wrong basketball play by not giving the ball to Kevin Durant to take up the court and create his own shot. 2. The Warriors coaching staff and front office clearly was catering to Keivn Durant and took his side, as lame as that is, he is more important than Draymond to winning more rings. 3. Kevin Durant is a sensitive snake. 4. Klay Thompson probably went to the ocean after all of this. 5. Smash that upvote button."
Draymond: I didn't like the way the best scorer in the league asked me to pass him the ball so I instantly flipped out and called him a bitch on the sidelines. I was already deep in my feeling because I thought he might be leaving at the end of the year so I refused to apologize.   Everyone : clearly Kevin Durant is a sensitive bitch.
"IDK if it's disrespectful to say he's a role player who's maximized his role. He still has to do it of course and he's an elite defensive player obviously.   But history is littered with elite defensive players or role guys that were essential to the team. Rodman, Ben Wallace, Bruce Bowen, etc.   I think that most people have a problem when he tries to take too much credit. He WAS essential to their success, sure. But he's the most replaceable OUT OF the core Warriors players. To say to Kevin freaking Durant ""watch who you're talking to"" or whatever doesn't sit right with a bunch of people including me.   It'd be in the vein of Chris Bosh or Robert Horry saying it to the likes of Wade/LeBron or Kobe/Tim Duncan. Know your place bro. No one is saying you suck, but know your place, you ain't better than KD."
Kevin Durant: “Pass me the ball”  Draymond: “it’s just funny how...”
"This is such a weird take. Like four second left to go, what the fuck was Draymond trying to ""run""? You have time to get the ball up the floor, make a move, and shoot. In that scenario, give Steph or KD the ball and get the fuck out of the way.   &amp;#x200B;  Dray is a great player, but in THIS scenario, I can't see how anyone can make an argument that from a BBIQ viewpoint, KD was at fault here. Give the ball to Kevin fuckin Durant with 4 seconds to go and get the fuck out of the way."
"ironically, you're doing the exact opposite. Supporting Draymond because he's a hometown guy. He's in the wrong here.  Draymond stole the rebound from him and ran up the court ignoring both players. When there's four seconds left in the game, you want the ball in the hands of one of the best scorers alive. There wasn't enough time to initiate shit. In these situations,  when Kevin Fucking Durant (or Steph or Lebron or Kawhi) wants the ball, he gets the fucking ball.  Being a homer and defending ""your guys"" is cool and all, but this is pushing the limit bruh. Open your eyes lmao."
Both styles work and suit the respective rosters. Warriors were much better because they added fucking Kevin Durant who iso'd all the time.
That was probably just the angle [here Cousins and Durant are the same height]  (https://www.google.com/search?q=kevin+durant+demarcus+cousins&amp;client=ms-android-sprint-us-revc&amp;prmd=inv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiitJCPtYbpAhVRQ80KHSOPCQAQ_AUoAXoECAsQAQ&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=695&amp;dpr=2.63#imgrc=mIMdl39tQaC62M)

"Here’s mine in no particular order, but the first few are some “Legacy” players since I think it’s important to include the non modern day players that didn’t make the original list.  - Dominique Wilkins - Bob McAdoo - Adrian Dantley - Alex English  - Gary Payton - Jason Kidd - Kobe Bryant - Tim Duncan - Kevin Garnett - Dirk Nowitzki - Allen Iverson - LeBron James - Steve Nash - Dwayne Wade - Stephen Curry - Kevin Durant - Russell Westbrook - James Harden - Chris Paul - Kahwi Leonard - Dwight Howard - Tracy McGrady - Ray Allen - Anthony Davis - Carmelo Anthony  If the first four weren’t added (since they didn’t make the original but I think it’s whack that Dominique/McAdoo didn’t get in for 50) then I could also see some high profile names like Dennis Rodman, Yao Ming, Deron Williams, Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Manu Ginobli, Kyrie Irving... I think though it’s really hard to remove any of the modern day players listed above (post-1997) when your factor in MVP’s, 1st Team All Pros/Defense, Titles, Stats...   I could definitely see Giannis getting in as the “Shaq” pick of the 75th Greatest Players list (Shaq got in the 50th Anniversary Team when many felt he did not deserve it yet as he had only been in the league 5 years at the time)."
"I’ll also try to avoid GOAT picks, just for fun. I’d go  PG John Stockton SG Klay Thompson SF Kevin Durant PF Kevin Garnett C Hakeem Olajuwon. I went for a defensive team that can also space the floor. Stockton is there to create fast breaks off of steals, and run the half court offense. Klay is there to play solid D against the opposing 2, while also being the 5th option, who you can never leave open for three. And if he gets hot, the game is just over. KD is a great defender who will be my number 1 scoring option. KG is there because he can stretch the floor, letting Hakeem dominate the paint and not get doubled. He is also a very versatile defender. Hakeem is my defensive anchor. He can also shoot the mid range, and he cannot be guarded one on one in the post. If you bring the double, I have shooters everywhere. If you let him go one on one, he’s gonna cook you. He can also hold his own against any other all time great center. He is also hard to pick on if you force the switch with a pick and roll, since he has such fast feet. What do y’all think?"
What? If anything that just further proves my point of how you can’t just not consider important details cause they are what ifs. The warriors without kevin Durant and klay for 1.5 games nearly took Toronto to 7. The raptors were obviously not better than the warriors last year when both teams were healthy.
[he said it ](https://www.slamonline.com/nba/kevin-durant-finally-admits-hes-7-feet-tall/)
"Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Nazr Mohammed, Serge Ibaka, Victor Oladipo, Paul George"
"I said an outlier for OKC Kevin Durant. His circumstances were very different on both teams. he was greatly benefitting from Currys gravity. He didn't magically become a better passer, defender, and scorer for no reason when he joined them"
I also wanted the Raptors to win last year and I am not blind to the facts even without Kevin Durant if Klay Thompson was just healthy the Warriors are winning that series.  I wanted the Nuggets to beat the Trailblazers last year that went to a game 7 and nothing to say about that CJ McCollum went off.  I wanted the wizards to beat the Celtics in 2017 and I’m not looking for any type of reasoning to justify their loss the Celtics just won.  there are a lot of different series that didn’t go The way I wanted and there’s no controversy around it.
"Not to argue either way but the voting wasn’t really close that year. Rose was way ahead, Dwight Howard was second, and then Lebron third. It wasn’t like Rose squeaked ahead like Westbrook vs Harden or Harden vs Giannis. Voters had him as the runaway MVP that year.   1.	Derrick Rose	1182 2.	Dwight Howard	643 3.	LeBron James	522 4.	Kobe Bryant	428 5.	Kevin Durant	190"
"From Lebron (LOL) to Shaq, players of the modern era have done this, I don't know why Kevin Durant is villified for it. Look at Shaq's earnings potential vs. Barkley who never won a championship. Shaq is at $400 million vs. Barkley at $50 million. Though Barkley lost $10-$30 million (wtf kind of estimate is that?) gambling, apparently Shaq had no such vice."
"Such a lazy and inaccurate take, and also a sign that you haven't taken the time to watch MJ's old playoff games.  MJ basically didn't shoot 3s in the regular season except for a handful of seasons.  He shot more 3s in the playoffs though and his playoff shooting stats are more informative as a result.  MJ's playoff 3pt% with the regular line is 34.5%  Compare to modern players like Kevin Durant - 35.2%, Lebron James, 34.4%, James Harden 33.3%  MJ's 3s point shooting ability really wasn't that bad."
"brilliant.. nailed it.  &amp; when the lebron centric system fails, the story becomes “he has no team” around him or “needs more help”  conveniently ignoring the fact that the roster was never designed to succeed without bron at the helm in the first place..  that george hill shit is the epitome of his downfall &amp; let me add kyle korver from the year prior..   bron is fumbling the ball around late in the game trying to isolate draymond.. finds kyle korver in the corner for a contested 3.   meanwhile kevin durant (who has stephen curry and klay thompson on his team) walks down the court and drills a series clincher in bron’s face... there’s two types of mentalities in this game.   the propaganda machine has really tried hard to make it so bron safe from any sort of fault or criticism, it’s always nice running into people with eyes to see."
"man fuck him biggest bitchmove in nba history, joining the best team in nba history after losing to them 4-3 like dawg every mf i know would be like aight man it was hella close but next year we‘ll get em, but this mans kevin durant, na he‘s like if u cant beat them join  them"
Kevin Durant.
"I would rebuild it and make it the NBA hall of fame instead of the basketball hall of fame.  It would be very very very very exclusive. It would only be the best of the best of the best.  Jordan, LeBron, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Kobe, Duncan, Hakeem, Russell, Wilt, Shaq, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry.  I might be forgetting a few players. But if they aren’t in the range of the players I named they wouldn’t get it"
"""Inarguably better"" lol Like without thinking about it much, I understand your sentiment that Giannis is a better fit than KD but it's still Kevin fucking Durant. Durant and Giannis are two of the most dominant basketball players ever. Not just Giannis."
So Kevin Durant is my All-Time favorite player. Back when he was on the Thunder it annoyed the shit out of me if Westbrook got tunnel vision and would take some dumbass contested three while KD was wide the hell open. I used to say that KD joining the Warriors was one of my favorite days as an NBA fan because I no longer had to watch Westbrook when I wanted to watch KD.
"&gt;There were some extenuating circumstances (playing next to the 2 best shooters ever) that would prevent me personally from calling it a GOAT-tier performance  I'm not sure how KD playing with Steph &amp; Klay is relevant into this conversation, do you think someone like Harrison Barnes (or literary anyone else) would've putting up those kind of numbers KD did on insane 70% TS He's one of the best scorers in NBA history who can shoot everyone. Going by you reasoning, then anyone can easily discredit a rando all-time great's performance due to having a stacked team...   &gt;Its just that LeBron James averaged a 33 point triple double on 63% true shooting over the 2 finals.  Why do you ignore their respective shooting splits?  Kevin Durant: 55.6/47.4/92.7  LeBron James: 55.6/38.7/64.9  And I'm not really sure how doing a triple double makes LeBron ahead of KD. I mean, people generally don't rate Russell Westbrook ahead of KD despite putting up a triple double for 3 straight seasons. Something nobody has done in NBA history."
"&gt;51 wins and a bottom 10 defense are just the facts, not bs.  It doesn't mean anything. Completely irrelevant to how good the team played during the playoffs.  &gt;The Cavs were giving up wide open dunks to Kevin Durant in the finals. Clearly, the Cavs weren’t able to turn on their defense like you suggested.  it's not like anyone else was able to defend that Warriors squad in 2017. I never claimed they were amazing defensively, just much better than their bottom 10 defense in the regular season. The '17 Warriors were simply overpowered (that's why they only lost a game where the Cavs made a finals record 3 pointers) and it's not like they gave Durant wide open dunks every other play. It was literally just a few bad breakdowns. He made a ridiculous number of tough shots."
"51 wins and a bottom 10 defense are just the facts, not bs. The Cavs were giving up wide open dunks to Kevin Durant in the finals. Clearly, the Cavs weren’t able to turn on their defense like you suggested."
I see Kyrie as real threat to yalls chemistry and the offcourt stuff. I meant supervillain bc Kevin Durant is just a deadly 7 foot tall shooter who was just a 2 time champ in the past three years. I'm hoping yall get some shine in Brooklyn too. I'm a Hawks fan but I was following yall heavily this season bc of KD. Hopefully we meet yall in the ECF soon and let the best team win!
I'm super excited to see Kevin Durant back in play. The game just ain't the same without everyone's favorite super villain. I think the Nets could do some real damage
"If you really want controversial, I'd say Kevin Durant"
Your comment will be looked back on years from now when people are wondering what people predicted about him after he’s the second coming of Kevin Durant or something 😂
"Dallas went to the finals and then won 67 games playing Erick Dampier, DeSagana Diop, Adrian Griffin and Greg Buckner 20 MPG.  Michael Finley was a great player but his peak came before Dirk's. By the time Dirk was the main guy, Finley was in a Wally Szcerbiak role. 16-20 ppg and shooting 3s with decent defense.  Also Van Exel, Jamison, LaFrentz, Walker were all 1 year rentals and Stackhouse was a 10-13 ppg guy.  You are also really downplaying Minnesota guys. Cassell in 2004 averaged 20/7 on 40% 3PT shooting and even if he was ""injured"" he still played 81 games and averaged 17 ppg and 7 apg after the ASG, Nash's peak in Dallas saw him average 18 ppg and 7 apg with 42% 3PT Shooting. Cassell played slightly better defense too.  Both Kevin Garnett and Dirk have similar Win shares and WS/48 in their primes, it's not like either of these guys were dragging a team of rec league guys to the finals. They had decent teams (like I said Dirk had some slightly better teams) but neither had perennial all stars around them. Both had 1-2x all stars for a season or so. Dirk's teams on average went a little farther, but we've already stated that Dirk had slightly better teammates in the way of Nash and Finley (who only played as a trio for 6 years, 3 of which Dirk wasn't even an all star yet).  From 2004-2011 Dirk had 2 all star teammates, both were injury replacements, Josh Howard was a 3rd string replacement and Kidd was a last second replacement who only was selected because the ASG was in Dallas.  I think we can all agree Dirk had some slightly better teammates but you are framing it like Dirk played with Steph, Klay and Durant meanwhile Kevin Garnett was playing with high school players."
Man I hope so. I hate seeing guys careers get robbed of their peak because of injuries. It makes me so sad for Kevin Durant. He’s my favorite player of all time and was playing the best basketball of his life when he cane back too soon and tore his Achilles.
I believe you’ve just described Kevin Durant my friend. Jokes aside i know I may be in the minority here but I really do think he may be the greater scorer of all time. Legit every time he shoots the ball I think it’s going in.. on the rare occasion he it doesn’t I’m genuinely surprised.
"Okay, how about the Kevin Durant Memorial Ultradome? If that sounds too long you can always call it the Snake Pit for short."
&gt;We see players like Kevin Durant take away from his legacy by getting in twitter fights with teenagers.  if that affects how you view a player's legacy than you're a moron and nobody should take your basketball opinions seriously
I mean Kevin Durant is a near 7 footer with a 7'4 wingspan and can pull up from 30 feet at a career .381 3 point percentage clip.  He's also a hell of a finisher at the rim and unfairly mobile.  I can see it.

"The 2018 rockets are a top 10 team of all time. When CP3 Capela and Harden were healthy (Capela and CP3 missed almost a quarter of the season each), the rockets went 50-5  50-5   They lost to four all stars and igoudala and looney in 7 games. They lost to Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green in 7 with CP3 missing two games. That’s a top ten team of all time"
Yes he should. It's a damn shame that Kevin Durant constantly lives his life in Jamal Murray's shadow.
"It's ""what a move **on** Kevin Durant"""
"Can you do kevin durant with kawhi’s hair, I think he could pull that off"
He's definitely going to be sponsored by Kevin Durant after this one
"For me I'd switch it up and say:  - Kevin Durant = Kanye: both are considered the absolute top performers in their profession but get a lot of flack for constantly saying questionable things.  - Steph Curry = Drake: extremely flashy, popular and undeniably dominant. Don't always get their respect, often clowned on for being soft. They're both also lightskins affiliated with Toronto.  - Kawhi Leonard = Kendrick Lamar: both Cali dudes who are no nonsense and considered the peak of their professions. They don't waste time with media or publicit. They also both have cornrows.  For Kyrie Irving, the best comp I can think of is B.o.B: Both came into the game pretty strong and had a ton of highlights, but really got into some questionable ""woke"" stuff and saw their career start to decline."

Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant if he's healthy enough. Height really matters and at the end of the game guys either foul or don't defend jump shots.  I'm not sure why people are so obsessed with getting NBA players to play one-on-one though. It's pretty ugly.

"Not when pierce was playing lebron, melo, duncan, Garnett, dirk, webber, jermaine o'neal, kevin durant that's 8 players who were routinely in the All-NBA teams when Pierce played   The guys who were ahead of Allen every year   Kobe,wade, nash, kidd, tmac Cp3 those were the guys making it over him every year if ray Allen was so great he would have more than 2. Having watched him he wasn't held highly compared to other stars when he played but since retirement hes suddenly been elevated to a higher status then what he actually was"

KD was being guarded better than both Klay and Curry it just didn't matter because he's Kevin Durant.

Kevin Durant in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals  43/13/7 on 78% TS
What if this hiatus gets stretched so long that Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are actually healthy and well to play?  Edit: Grammar
"If I said something that was supposed to be private, but was made public, then yeah. That's better than saying something messed up in public, completely flippant to the consequences of it.  It doesn't give him a free pass on it, but it's certainly different from the way Kyrie and Wilt handled their respective situations. They completely lacked tact and respect for their teammates. KD at least had the respect for their careers to not publicize it... intentionally. And, I mean, he was trying to defend his jumping ship at the time. It remains a weak move, but I understand how everyone dogging you can make you say something in self-defense. Even then, it wasn't supposed to be ""Kevin Durant"" saying it. He was trying to have his official stance on his ex-team be as amicable as possible."
"Because his intention wasn't to be the superstar ex-teammate burying his former team. Now, he slipped up and accidentally posted it to his real Twitter account, which obviously blew up, but the idea was that he wanted to state his reasons without drawing the attention of ""Kevin Durant says that his teammates suck"". So even though it amounted to the same thing, it wasn't something that KD intended to be public. He was pretty tight-lipped about it all, officially.  Honestly, if I was KD and people asked me why I left OKC, I'd just say ""because Presti traded away James Harden"". They had a homegrown big 3 and pissed it down the drain...  Also, I think last postseason showed that he has the fire of a competitor that people were accusing him of lacking."
"Steph Curry, James Harden, Lebron James, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis"
"Nobody is turning other quality all-star teammates into spot up shooters, it's more so role players, and even more than that it's that spot up shooters usually pair perfectly with ball dominant superstars who thrive by getting to the line and finishing inside as part of their repetoire.  I'd argue none of them turn their all-star counterparts into spot up shooters:   - Kevin Durant &amp; Steph Curry (didn't turn either one of themselves or Draymond into spot up shooters, Klay is one but they didn't turn him into that)   - LeBron (as others have said Kyrie, AD, and Wade were not spot up shooters)   - Harden (didn't turn CP or Westbrook into spot up shooters)   - Westbrook (didn't turn KD or PG into spot up shooters)   - PG (didn't turn Westbrook or Kawhi into spot up shooters)   - Embiid/Butler (didn't turn eachother nor Simmons into spot up shooters)   - Jokic (didn't turn Murray into a spot up shooter)  I think all of these guys are also capable at playing in the flow of the game and don't rely that strongly on shooters"
Kevin Durant ruined his career with the warriors move.
"They wouldn't have been able to add other significant pieces tho, in fact they would've lost some  Because if KD didn't come they would've maxed Barnes....which would've tied up their cap  &gt;God I wish my team could win 73 games so people could tell me our window is gonna close if we don't add KEVIN DURANT to our already insane team LMAO.  Them winning 73 games didn't mean anything. And the playoffs evidently showed that considering they lost giving up a 3-1 lead and was an all-time Klay performance from getting spanked in 6 by OKC. Y'all gotta let go of the 73 wins...it doesn't mean they would've won again. It doesn't mean anything"
"It's insane that to say the warriors window was closing. They were an insanely good, YOUNG, team that could have added other pieces instead of being gifted a top five player in KD. God I wish my team could win 73 games so people could tell me our window is gonna close if we don't add KEVIN DURANT to our already insane team LMAO."
"&gt;He made that dynasty what it was, not Steph or Dray or Klay or Myers or anyone else.  Damn right, my good man. They weren't shit before Kevin Durant got there."
And then to say it to fucking KEVIN DURANT of all people lmao. Like the most sensitive basketball player when it comes to criticisms and barbs. Geez.
"All-Time Nets somehow have Kidd, Kyrie, Kevin Durant (well after one game), Rick Barry, Julius Erving, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, Bernard King and Vince Carter. And a whole bunch of random other point guards.  Their skill at picking up over-the-hill legends and missed super-teams pays off in this case."
I think this is it  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/nba/2018/6/12/17454050/kevin-durant-warriors-parade-contract-bob-myers   Seems harmless but you really have to be careful about making jokes like this in public
"Sometimes I just zone out and remember when KD said “I’m Kevin Durant, y’all know who i am” and proceeded to take a shit on the Clippers. Snarky KD=Best KD lowkey"
"From the 2010s guys I think the final resting places will be:  1. Lebron James 2. Stephen Curry 3. Kawhi Leonard 4. Kevin Durant 5. James Harden 6. Chris Paul  Where that puts him all time? Probably ends up Top 15, given people have Durant ranked 14th right now.   I’m assuming he wins at least 1 championship for the Clippers in this. If he fails at that, he will be ranked below Durant and be in the 18-25 range."
"Kevin Durant’s 4 scoring titles might be worth more than Kwahi’s 2DPOYs. Kwahi might be the Mariano Rivera of closing NBA games, but Durant has been a consistently historic scorer and underrated defender.  Durant also took charge of OKC as a rookie, whereas Kwahi was allowed to grow into his role"
Kevin Durant and it’s not too close for me. Kawhi just doesn’t have as long of a body of work.
"It's not a diss to him at all.  [And he literally was quoted as saying that he thought winning a championship would fill a void, but didn't](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/), so it's hardly like he didn't make comments to a similar effect."
"In the past 30 years, any finals MVP not named Lebron, Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, or Hakeem Olujawon has statistically performed worse than Curry has in the finals."
"I'll think his defense is underrated too, and then he'll have a game where he makes Frank Kaminsky look like Kevin Durant."
"Curry is actually a good defender for his position. He even finished 2nd in DRPM among point guards during his first MVP season and his prime defensive ratings are comparable to Kobe’s (just for a point of reference).   He’s not a lockdown defender (you just can’t be at that size), but he is a high IQ defender that plays his role in the team defense correctly almost all the time and he’s an elite ballhawk for steals.  With that said, I think the impact of Curry, Giannis, Kawhi, Kevin Durant, etc is all pretty well equal at this point (well not KD any more because of the injury) and who is more impactful in a playoff series just comes down to randomness for that series since they’re all so close."
Kevin Durant
"Absolutely, i'm just accounting for why his point total was higher than people like Kevin Durant and James Harden (two individuals i believe we can agree are better than McAdoo). He played during a time when you stayed out on the floor for 40 minutes even if you were up 20. Kevin Durant is taken out of the game as soon as it is no longer necessary. That's purely to stop him from being another Bob McAdoo who has an injury list as long as his accomplishments."
John wall: optimus dime kawhi leonard: the terminator paul george: batman kevin durant: green room kyrie: the ankletaker (i like this one but never really heard it much)
"I don't think this quote is about KD personally at all, the quote is about how adding Durant to the team made winning an expectation and how that wasn't as satisfying.   &gt; The pressure that Jordan and the Bulls felt while trying to stay on top during both sets of three-peats resonated for Warriors personnel.  &gt; ""The second time with Kevin [in 2018] it felt like, 'Well, we just did what we were supposed to do, and great job,'"" Warriors president and general manager Bob Myers said of the last time the Warriors won a title. ""It wasn't joy."
Blocks numbers are so strange in international play during the Dream Team Era due to the minutes distribution and change in style of play (international teams not challenging people like David Robinson in the paint as frequently... or turning the ball over before they could even get there).   An extension of your trivia factoid - here's each Dream Team's blocks leader:  1992 - Patrick Ewing (1.1) (followed by Chris Mullin at 1.0)  1996: John Stockton (0.5)  2000: Ray Allen (1.4)   2004: Carmelo Anthony (0.7 in a touch under 7 minutes per game)  2008: LeBron James (1.0)  2012: Kevin Durant (0.6)  2016: DeAndre Jordan (1.1)  2020: COVID-19 (1.0)
"We are comparing it to Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant's success as leaders and the Warriors run has to be divided between pre-KD and post-KD, which is massive.  MJ had six championships in eight years and, at the time, the greatest regular season ever, Magic had 9 Finals appeareances in 12 years with 5 championships and Kobe as a leader/co-leader with Shaq won 5 with 7 appeareances. The sheer volume alone is not really comparable.  Steph probably is a great leader, i didn't say anyone else werent, i just said they were not AS successful. The problem with Steph in this case is that there is a gigantic difference between pre-Kevin Durant Warriors to post-Kevin Durant. Pre-KD they win a championship without facing a starting point guard in their playoff run and then after getting the 73-9 all-time record, blow a 3-1 lead to the Cavs in the NBA Finals. After KD arrives, they are so ridiculously talented when compared to the rest of the league that it's actually really hard to gauge how much Steph's leadership actually influenced the results.  I mean, at the end of the day Draymond still said the shit he said to KD and KD still felt disgruntled enough to leave under Steph's watch as a leader.  Again, i'm not saying other styles like Tim's and Steph's aren't successful, just that they weren't as successful and that MJ/Kobe/Magic's asshole style doesn't get romanticized for no reason."
“The Southern Dandy” Kevin Durant
"Thanks, I forgot who Kevin Durant was"
"Never forget Kevin Durant went out of bounds in front of a ref, no call. Shit they even extended a game that over to get the warriors another shot against Houston. NBA is blatantly corrupt"
On the team with Kevin durant? Yeah I wonder why he had lesser averages those years lol.   Don’t bring up mvp steph then use the 2019 warriors as your proof lol
"so many things painfully wrong with this analysis.  &gt;Cp3 and russ were a toss up in 14-15  No it wasn't a toss up, Clippers finished 3rd seed with 56 wins tied with the Rockets for 2nd, CP3 also analytically had a better season without question, by which I mean he contributing more to his teams wins.  &gt;2015-16 russ was all nba first team, clearly second to steph  he was first team because he had Kevin Durant on his team averaging 28/8/5 on 63% TS....., CP3s team still only finished with 2 more losses, Westbrook can thank KD for that 1st team selection.  &gt;2016-17 he was literally the best PG in the league during the regular season, no question.  Again this is wrong, Westbrook was playing a system where he had the ball 24/7, Curry was sharing with Durant, he had the best regular season for point guards because he was in that position, doesn't mean he was better than Curry.  &gt;It’s a joke to say kyrie was better, lillard has an argument but still no, and his team got swept in 4 while he shot 35% from the field  its not really a joke is it, and you mention Lillard getting swept, do you want to talk about Westbrooks playoff performance that year?  29/12/7.5 with 5 turnovers a game on 49% TS...  &gt;This year, gonna be all nba second team to luka sonic getting first team, again making him the second best PG in the league. Also kyrie has never ever been better than russ, I know you’re a casual nerd fan but never has he been better.  lool, Lillard, and Luka have both been better than him this year, Steph and Kyrie are injured so that puts Westbrook at 3rd.  And yes Kyrie has been better than Westbrook, there is no argument you can logically make to say Westbrook was better in 18/19, also the term casual nerd doesn't make sense, you are one or the other."

So you would have Buddy Hield guarding Kevin Durant and Kawai Leonard?
"Steph and Bron too.  Bron actually has a quote about this I think before a finals game with the spurs talking about how there are different types of killers. Let me try and find it.  edit: Found it:  &gt; *When people think about the killer instinct, they always think of MJ and Kobe. Do people underestimate your killer instinct? People say you have it but not like those two. Do you think you have it like they do?*  &gt; Ahh. I'll just put it this way, man. There are different ways to hunt. I watch the Discovery Channel all the time, and you look at all these animals in the wild. And they all hunt a different way to feed their families. They all kill a different way. Lions do it strategically -- two females will lead, and then everybody else will come in. Hyenas will just go for it. There are different ways to kill, and I don't think people understand that. Everybody wants everybody to kill the same way. Everybody wants everybody to kill like MJ or kill like Kobe. Magic didn't kill the way they killed. Does that mean he didn't have a killer instinct? Kareem didn't either. But does that mean Kareem didn't have a killer instinct? The same with Bird. That doesn't mean you don't have a killer instinct. Tim Duncan don't kill like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, but I've played against Tim Duncan twice in the Finals and I know for sure he's got a killer instinct. So there are different ways to kill. MJ had a killer instinct for sure. But if people really think that MJ didn't talk to nobody and didn't smile on the court, they're crazy. They're crazy. I've seen him. I was watching a clip the other day of him blocking Charles Barkley, and they're laughing about the play -- on the floor. Right now, if I block Kevin Durant on the floor, or I block Carmelo Anthony and we laugh about it? Ahh, I'm going to get killed [laughing]. I'm telling you. But there are different ways of killing.  &gt; *Do you think you'll change people's minds about that?*  &gt;I hope. I hope. I hope people will see that there are different ways of winning. And I win by … I don't want to say doing it my way. I am doing it my way but not in a selfish way. I want to win by having fun and having a brotherhood around me where we all have the same goals -- and that's just going out and winning, man. When I'm having fun, I'm loving the game, and that's what brings joy to me. [Leans back and smiles] Every now and then my look comes out, though -- like Game 6 in Boston [2012]. People say, Why don't he do that all the time? [laughs] Man, I don't even … first of all, I have no idea why that look even happened. Somebody took a great photo. The camera was right on time, and he happened to get me when I was a little bit tired and I looked up. Bam! Now, it's The Look [laughs]. It's the LeBron Look. The LeBron Face [laughs]. It's cool, though. It's cool. Don't think for one second, though, that I'm not zeroed in on what I need to get done to kill my prey."
"Yeah, he was good. I'm just saying I saw Kevin Durant in him."
Bitch - Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant. The thing about Durant is...he's just a walking mismatch. Physically he's probably one of the most agile 6'10+ guys ever, second only to giannis...Oh and he's a top 5 shooter in the league. What do you do about that?"
"Kobe was the more talented scorer with his techniques and footwork. Kevin Durant is practically built to be an ideal scorer in the modern NBA and the stats might favor him, but the numbers by themselves don’t really factor for team composition, pace, coaching and shot selection differences between their primary eras.   However, if you swapped their brains and bodies and put them both in their respective prime eras (2002-2010 for Kobe, 2009 or so through 2019 for Durant), I imagine Kobe would be a better version of Durant if he retains the same hand-eye coordination and footwork that he had before.  Not too sure on the inverse, so that’s what pushes me towards Kobe on this hypothetical.   A lot of variables, but like another commenter said they’re both all time great scorers and your pick likely comes down to what you value more when building a team."
"Probably because there's a massive drop off in the Warriors net rating when Steph is off the court, but not a significant drop off when KD is of the court.  The Cavs literally came out and said our game plan to stop Steph first and foremost and we'll live with Durant. There are plenty of plays where Kevin Durant would walk into open layups because the Cavs were so focused on Steph.   Whether or not KD is better than Steph, it's very clear that for the Warriors Steph was much more important than KD.   Check out Thinking Basketball's video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuP6-puSfRs"
"Kevin Durant is such an interesting case to me, because he has these really wide-spanning elaborate tattoos on his back and torso that are covered pretty well by his jersey. During the game he doesn't look heavily tattooed but definitely is."
Kevin Durant
this would have been a BAD look for kevin durant
"That is a little weak.  Some of these guys are playing way more broadly than their position. With small ball with the Warriors, Kevin Durant is often picking up some PF or C duties."
I would agree with but that doesn’t make sense for the last 3. LeBron wasn’t in the finals last year. Kevin Durant did NOT win the finals MVP for his defense. I don’t even remember his 1v1 defense in the finals but I remember his long threes and wide open dunks.
" - Generational athleticism (basically the most athletic woman in the world) - technically possible   - Very tall, at least 6'5"" without hindering athleticism (i.e. incredible athlete, full stop ... not incredible athlete for a woman 6'5"") - probably possible   - Incredible skill, be able to knock down 3s at at least 40% - possible   - Great BBIQ and awareness  - absolutely possible  So on their own each of these 4 things are possible, but all together is basically theoretically possible, but incredibly improbable. Having the skill to be an incredible shooter plus the requisite athleticism with a male physique would be the best player in the world (basically LeBron gifted with Steph's shooting ability).  Very rarely do we see 3 point shooters being the most athletic in the game - the main 2 that come to mind are young Ray Allen and Kevin Durant. Ray Allen was 6'5"" as a male, so the female equivalent would be around 5'11"" [if this website is accurate](https://dqydj.com/height-percentile-calculator-for-men-and-women/), so it would literally be like if Ray Allen was 7' and didn't lose any athleticism.  Unfortunately, I think this means that realistically it's just not realistically possible unless we enter an age of genetic optimization for some people. If a woman were to enter the league I think it would have to be in some capacity similar to a Steve Novak type to stretch the floor."
"Maybe Kerr was lying to cover for somebody or something, but it sounds like it was an organizational decision  &gt; This brings up the question: why didn't Steve want this for the Warriors ""last dance?"" &gt;  &gt; Simple. He didn't view the 2018-19 season as their last.  &gt;  &gt; ""You think about our situation with the Warriors, and we didn't have a final season,"" Kerr said. ""We're trying to keep this thing going. A lot of our players are still here, and we're trying to rev it back up, so there was no sense of finality. If anything, we're trying to avoid that."" &gt;  &gt; Kevin Durant's (then) upcoming free agency was the main topic of discussion during the 2018-19 season. Unlike the Bulls, Durant hadn't yet made his decision and the Warriors still had their original Big Three: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. &gt;  &gt; With Chicago, owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause made it known they had decided to part ways with head coach, Phil Jackson, before the season began. Jordan also said he wouldn't play for any coach other than Jackson. Krause felt that the Bulls were too old and decided it was time to rebuild.  &gt;  &gt; ""Having everybody in, inviting the world in and inviting cameras in and saying, 'Hey, we want to capture the final days of this run,' it's like you're violating a principle of the sanctity of the locker room,"" Kerr continued. ""So it never occurred to me, nor does it now, to do anything of the sort for our team.""  https://957thegame.radio.com/articles/golden-state-warriors/kerr-didnt-allow-warriors-edition-of-the-last-dance"
To Durant's defense though. Have we ever seen a system built around Kevin Durant

"The warriors with a strong bench would have been title contenders for the last 3 years without kevin durant.  It is likely that they would have won atleast 1 ring in that 3 year span, and it is likely that without a dominant scorer like durant, steph would have won a fmvp.  Considering that for most critics, the biggest knock on curry  is his lack of fmvp, it is likely that he wouldn't have any major flaws on his resume.  I say that in all likelihood durant joining the warriors weakened steph's legacy."
"They didn't just face a better team. The Warriors in 16 were a better team than the Cavs. THEN they added Kevin Durant.  I don't know who you hang out with, but no one though they stood a chance. I consider the 17 loss as out of his hands as the 07 loss. LeBrons only Finals black mark is '11."

"Harden is easily the better more consistent player and it shows in stats like vorp, war and win shares.  It’s eerily similar to luka vs trae. Luka is an offensive system all too himself, while trae a unique offensive talent in his own right like curry has to be surrounded with elite defensive wings to keep from a liability when his shot isn’t falling.   Harden has dominated in the nba under 3 different head coaches. Won 6th man of the year under Scotty brooks posting an insane 66% ts. Having being robbed of an mvp in 2015 under Kevin mchale who like mark Jackson has never gotten another coaching gig after his first stint and later on D’Antoni who most thought this marriage would fail due to harden being perceived as selfish iso player in the vain of melo. And with D’Antoni failing in New York and Los Angeles with 2 iso centric scorers the media was saying this marriage was gonna fail. Even going as far to mock harden for saying” he had some Steve Nash in his game” prior to the start of the 2017 season.  Curry’s only edge over harden is media perception and how he is viewed. You will never hear the media trash curry. If anything they always have injury excuses for him in the playoffs when he struggles. The media is basically guilty of accusing Durant of faking his injury in the finals  because they thought Durant enjoyed seeing the dubs struggle without him. Curry was getting exposed by Fred van vleet of all people. Curry scored 47 on his home court and still got blown out. That seems very similar to what happens to trae young alll the time. Scoring 40 but getting blown outta the building. Question ask yourself when’s the last time harden had an efficient 40 points and the rockets LOST. Almost never happens doesn’t matter if he is playing with g-leagers because similar to lebron and now luka. Harden can control the game flow with his pace"

"To be fair, some players like Chris Paul and Kevin Durant should still be called for a carry every second dribble. The nba just relaxed enforcement in favor of easier scoring"
Efficiency =/= better scorer. Most NBA people cite Kobe as one of the greatest if not the greatest scorer ever and his FG% was average and he iso'ed a lot. Kevin Durant was being called a potential all time great scorer before he even played a playoff game and started shooting 50+%.  LeBron plays within the flow of the offense because he is the offense. He's been ball dominant his entire career (as he should). And playing within the flow of the offense has nothing to do with how good a scorer someone is. Many elite scorers will break the offense to get theirs.
"The amount of jokes per second is crazy.  Common enemies,   Boogie - Nick Stauskas  Jimmy - KAT  Melo - playing defense  Draymond - balls  KD - Steph Curry  Westbrook - Kevin Durant"

Kevin Durant thinks so.
"Kevin Durant also liked the original post.   JR Smith: ✊🏿  Stephen Jackson (NBA): ""He was trying to educate people, educate himself, and he speaking the truth.""  What exactly does Stephen Jackson mean by he was speaking the truth and does JR Smith think that black power = Hitler quotes."
"Kevin Durant is an anti-Semite. Let that sink in folks.   Hey mods, don’t have a double standard."
And therefore we shouldn't talk about Kevin Durant supporting a guy who thinks that Hitler was right? foh
Remember when the mods took this sub down for a day for social justice?  Edit: since this post is back up I'll copy what I posted in the r/NFL thread  You have a guy praising Hitler and I can't find a single player condemning him  I'm searching twitter and I still haven't seen a single player condemn him.  I am seeing former players like [Rodney Bradley](https://twitter.com/RodBradley/status/1280509590908612608) and [Larry Johnson](https://twitter.com/2LarryJohnson7/status/1280522441886924807) support him  [Kevin Durant](https://twitter.com/guru_scout/status/1280354183653326849) liked the original IG post before it was taken down so did [Jameis Winston](https://twitter.com/guru_scout/status/1280347408774369280).  Stephen Jackson who was very outspoken about George Floyd [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCWMNjnlUFf/?igshid=10yb5s7ex84dk)   &gt;NFL owners are racist. Just the facts. U speak on anything involving Jews or Whites is hate. That say shit about us it’s kool. Fuk dat. I wouldnt apologize for shit.   Maybe Terry Crews is making some valid points that people who are outspoken about social justice that effects them and their race but quiet or supportive of the oppression and hatred of others are actually racists themselves.
Kevin Durant liked Jackson’s post as well. This shit is crazy. Can’t only be against racism when it affects you.
"I mean it definitely can be lol, have you ever accidentally clicked a button?  What if someone like trump tweeted out something like ""I like basketball"" and kevin Durant liked it, does that make him a racist? He liked a post by someone who is widely labelled as racist."
Bam Adebayo is who people wanted Mo Bamba to be.  Kevin Durant is who I wanted Michael Beasley to be.
"I always disliked Thunder-era Kevin Durant. The marketing around him at the time was that he was the “nicest guy in the league” and it seemed to me that he was supposed to be this quiet, humble and loyal superstar from a small market just like Tim Duncan. But as a Laker fan I saw him, Westbrook and Harden firsthand in the 2010 Playoffs screaming their heads off after a 1st quarter dunk as if they just won a title and for some reason it pissed me off (along with the parade of free throws they were being gifted.) It bothered me even more since I never saw “quiet humble guys” like Duncan or Stockton ever react that way and it irked me that Durant was supposed to be the next superstar in their mold.     Nowadays I actually like Durant and attribute a lot of my dislike towards him to his teams always punking the Lakers."

**2014-15.** The Cavs lost both Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving in the playoffs. It was basically LeBron vs GSW. I'm impressed he took it to 6 in those circumstances.  **2018-19.** The Raptors were fighting a hobbled GSW team who lost Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson midway through the series. I don't think the Raptors win against a full strength GSW team who are on the level of the 73-9 Bulls.
Kevin DURANT
And why is it Kevin Durant.
"Kevin Durant accomplished more.....  5 All-NBA calibre seasons, 5 MVP level seasons, much better playoff numbers...."
"&gt; 1) so Kobe has either the same or more amount of MVPs and FMVPs as Duncan? i don't see ""less"" in your comment  So Tim Duncan has 11 All NBA First Teams? So Tim Duncan was as crucial to his 5th championship as Kobe was to each of his 5? Tim Duncan has 9 All Defensive First selections? Scoring titles? Your nitpicking 1-2 items and the semantics of the word 'less' is trivial at best. Kobe Bryant outplayed Tim Duncan and the Spurs in multiple times and eliminated them, directly. You can say he 'won' the series MVPs against Tim Duncan in all of those match-ups.  &gt; 2) Okay you don't like PER, what about VORP? what about WS or WS/48? What about Net Rating? Which advanced stat do you like or are they all just BS?  List out every single one that you want. By your metrics, Chris Paul is better than Tim Duncan in every single way. You haven't changed a goddamned thing. And Hakeem Olajuwon is fucking 46th and you're citing that as a valuable metric? I honestly didnt even bother reading the remainder of your post. You're citing bullshit cumulative career statistics, when on a season-by-season basis, you're implying that:  VORP: Chris Paul, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Tracy McGrady, Russell Westbrook, KG, Shaq, Bird, Stockton, David Robinson, and Grant Hill have all put up VASTLY superior seasons than Tim Duncan.  BPM: I guess Giannis's current season is literally the 5th best of all time -- nearly 50% superior than any season Tim Duncan has ever put together?  WS/48 for CAREER: Chris Paul is your 4th best player of all time after Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, and David Robinson? Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, and James Harden round out the top 10?  Dude, really, shut the fuck up. Aggregate stats give a ballpark of player value, AT BEST. With Defensive stats, it's SIGNIFICANTLY less reliable.  I'd eat a bowl of shit if you answered correctly how to calculate any of the metrics you're citing in realtime.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Tim Duncan's teams were NOT weak because of ""salary"" you dipshit. You have half this sub saying Kobe is 'selfish for not taking paycuts' to make his team better and yet it's somehow still a plus for Tim Duncan to be on teams with lower salaries? The Big 3 Heat were probably a trash team as well right, because they were able to afford it via salary? All players took salary cuts. It's the most idiotic response out there.  Yes, you wasted your time replying because your reply is stupid."
In the words of Kevin Durant: Ain’t nothing gonna change me
"Oh look, its my favorite player, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Sad, the he suddenly retired in 2016, would've been great next season after being one game away from the finals."
I think that the current iteration of Westbrook doesn’t add up to playoff success.  He was a very young player when he went to the finals on a team with Kevin Durant and James harden. It’s not like that proved Westbrook can carry you to a finals
That's irrelevant. The point is Kevin Durant is one of the greatest players of all-time. Simply getting to the finals as a teammate of Durant's doesn't validate the criticisms. He needs to meet or exceed expectations at some point.
PG - George Hill  SG - Avery Bradley  SF  - Kevin Durant  PF - Giannis Antentokounmpo  C - Myles Turner
John Wall- $3   Avery Bradley- $1  Kevin Durant- $5  Serge Ibaka -$2  DeMarcus Cousins - $4
"I don't care how many titles Pop wins or anything, no coach will ever be better than Phil Jackson.   Tim Duncan gets too much consideration for what happened in 13 and 14 when that was a clear team effort. Tony Parker finished above him for the MVP race. From 08 on he's completely overrated.  Tyson Chandler was the most important reason why the 2011 Mavs won the title.   Ben Wallace should've been seen as a superstar on par with AI.   It's a crime AI didn't transition to a sixth man role better.   At the time of the AD trade, Brandon Ingram was head and shoulders better than anything anyone else offered and it was bizarre to see people make cases for someone like Dario Saric, whose not good.   Vince Carter wouldn't be in the league if the league didn't shift in his positional favor.   Trae Young can not lead a team to the playoffs being the number one option with no way to get better at D.   Devin Booker needs to just request a trade.   Chris Paul is the greatest to never win an MVP award, the second greatest is Dwight Howard.  Dwight Howard was better than Lebron from 07-10.   Kobe Bryant was the best player of his generation, and it was never more visible in the 2008 Olympics final game. He was also one of the least athletic superstars in his career's second half and so all we ever saw was like 75% of what he could do, which is fucking insane.   Kevin Durant was somehow better than Steph Curry and it's completely perplexing as to how he did that.  The Kings choked in G7 and that's why they didn't make the finals.  Magic Johnson's career ending so soon in the 1990s is the greatest what if in NBA history, the second greatest is Bill Walton in the early 80s.  Wilt Chamberlain was an unstoppable freak and is probably the greatest individual player of all time. Michael Jordan would struggle to beat peak Wilt in 1 on 1, and that's to no fault of his own. MJ, Phil Jackson, Scotty, Horace, Dennis -- this should be considered the greatest collective effort and coaching performance of all time.  Pat Riley is too good at his job to not lead whatever team he's associated to greatness, the Heat may, as soon as next year, find themselves competing.   Ben Simmons shouldn't be a point guard that initiates the offense if he can't shoot. Russell Westbrook shouldn't have been either and the fact that they were stunts the other places of the game they could impact.   If the Spurs make the playoffs this year I will be angry at every Spurs fan who considers this keeping the playoff streak alive.   Andre Drummond should just be out of the league, he is always going to be a guy with great potential whom teams don't understand how to unlock. He might be destined to be a role player at best."
Steph Curry is a better NBA player than Kevin Durant. He would have been regarded as top 10 all time by almost everybody if he never hurt his MCL in 2016.
"Forbes puts him at $1M invested with a return of $15M, but even if I use your additional $10M investment that is still an excellent return.

No I’m just scrutinizing Kevin Durant and his legacy.   I don’t think the 2 FMVP elevate his career as much as it would if he did it on any other team (except for one with LeBron)  And yes. I know our team won because is the Warriors not being full strength.   Honestly most Toronto fans knew this before this. We knew if y’all had injuries we could win but otherwise we were happy to be in the finals. But we did earn our way to the finals beating the bucks and 76ers both of whom were looked at as contenders.
"Kevin Durant exists more as a hypothetical player in most people’s minds than he does as an actual player.  People treat him like some Jordan-Rudy Gobert lite hybrid as a player who shoots 40% from 3 and who “doubles don’t work on, that’s why they double Steph” but then when you ask why his efficiency consistently fell off Significantly in the playoffs With OKC people start talking about a lack of spacing."
I like how Kevin Durant is listed as the sitcom for NBA player Bojack Horseman.
"the only nugget of truth in this entire post is that they didn't always have the best luck healthwise. the rest is all a complete and utter load of shit. there is a reason Westbrook has been voted on more than one occasion by players as the most overrated player in the game. you would argue i'm sure that Draymond Green is an elite HOF player based on nothing more than the Warriors record while he was there. i don't say that to slight Draymond, he is a great player, but clearly without Steph and Klay there is zero reason to believe he would ever make it to an NBA Finals. just as Westbrook being in a single NBA Finals in what, 7 years or so with Kevin Durant, does nothing to prove he is a winner. No more than Scottie Pippen's case is proven by being in 6 NBA Finals.   using assist btw to argue that he's a great point guard is cute, btw. this isn't grade school. you don't think a historic level of ball dominance and being the first guy to get his hands on the ball 90% of the time might actually have something to do with this do you? i don't know, just thinking out loud here. i mean, he is the point guard in Houston and averaging 7 this year, so obviously we can't tell a whole lot about how well someone is creating for others based simply on assist totals."
"You wouldn't need to run him off a screen, he would be 7'1, and able to pullup from 30  -  Why do you think he'd never develop his inside game?   Kevin Durant has a perimeter orientated skillset and game but can post up and finish well inside, but he's very skinny and 6'10.  You think this theoretical player would just never use the block?   Kobe and Jordan had great jump shots and handles, they both did a lot of work from the post.  A player as large is this isn't going to ignore a facet of basketball, especially if it makes them more effective and comes easily to them.  Players like being better, and if a player without as much work can be better then they will do so"
"&gt;“I'm treating everybody the same,"" Beverley said. ""Every team I play, I’m playing them like we playing the Golden State when they had Kevin Durant. Every point guard I play, I’m playing Steph Curry. Every shooting guard I’m playing, I’m playing James Harden. Every three-man I'm playing, I'm playing LeBron and KD.""  ""So lose?""  It's not about who's on the winning side. “I'm treating everybody the same.""   If anything, I'm spelling it out for y'all. If this is how your conversations go, I'm worried for your future employers."
"I'm not disputing his reputation.   *""So, lose?""*   doesn't make any logical sense in response to   *""Every team I play, I’m playing them like we playing the Golden State when they had Kevin Durant.""*"

"Why would the most no nonsense coach around sign up to coach Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, the 2 moodiest stars in the league?"
"Is it me, or does Jamie Fox and Kevin Durant look sorta similar?"
It's a shame Kevin Durant didn't exist for those years.
"Kevin Durant is like Jordan-lite. Kobe level. The only year they made the finals they also happened to have arguably one of the greatest 6th men in history - who happened to play 30+ mins a night, and a young Serge Ibaka. How good of a point guard do you think a team like that needs to make the finals in a given year? Someone less than Kyle Lowry would very likely still do it. And I love Kyle Lowry but nobody would be making the argument that he was a top 10 point guard all-time simply because he made the finals with that group."
"You're not understanding the situation. Playing Giannis more minutes is not a ""risky"" move or something that could ""hurt your team's long term goals"".  He was 30th in the league in [playoff minutes per game](https://stats.nba.com/leaders/?Season=2018-19&amp;SeasonType=Playoffs&amp;StatCategory=MIN), as a superstar. Of all the All Stars that made the playoffs, only Embiid and D'Angelo Russell played fewer MPG than Giannis. Everyone else was able to do it without risking injury or jeopardizing their future. That would true for any player at 34.3 MPG in the playoffs.  I think Bud structures his teams in a very specific and detailed way, and trying to mess with the rhythm has larger consequences for how his strategy can be implemented. But it's not a health risk, and trying to tie that to Kevin Durant, who was coming back off having not played, and attempting to ""save"" the series on a leg that wasn't fully healed. Way different"
He would win more if he had played with a HOF for his entire career like Stockton.  Stockton played with a possible top20 player of all-time. That's like putting CP3 with Kevin Durant.
Some Kevin Durant guy
"Yes, but if they win, that could set off a crazy domino effect. Does LeBron demand a trade at Cleveland, or more likely, a roster shakeup? Does Kevin Durant stay in Oklahoma? If not, does he still go to the Warriors, or somewhere else? Do the Warriors definitely re-sign Harrison Barnes, or go for another top-tier free agent instead of Durant?"
"What is your point here? That Trae isn’t KD or Westbrook? Yes, if we had a 22 year old Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook as his co-star, we would be in a better position than we are now with Trae. Is someone arguing this with you?  And even OKC won 23 games in KD’s second year. And then kd turned into KD and they became a legit NBA playoff team. We all know Trae has major holes in his game, but he isn’t the type of 2 way player to carry a replacement level team (which we were this year AND we had JC miss 25 games on top of it). Let’s build an actual professional NBA team around his offense and see what happens."
"r/nba, giving Kevin Durant #credit ?!?!?!;!!?;?!?!?!?  This is absolutely inconceivable"

"""You know who I am. I'm Kevin Durant."""
"He got ""booted"" from the Nets because Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving wanted to join the team.  He got ""booted"" from the Warriors because they always planned to trade him. They acquired him for Durant in the S&amp;T to use as a trade chip. That was always the plan regardless of the politically correct statements from Warriors people when asked about it."
Funny how the 'Kevin Durant from downtown' on commentary is also in perfect sync.
Even he admitted they weren't [fulfilling.](https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/30/kevin-durant-i-thought-championship-would-fill-void-but-it-didnt/)
Who cares man we gas great performances from players against mediocre teams all the time. Dude said I’m kevin Durant and averaged 40 for the rest of the series while beefing with a known shit talker/defender. That’s just a dope moment

"Nah us raptor fans are annoying but sometimes we can be dicks at times.

"I remember this moment vividly as it felt like it was out of a movie. I was in the airport in Belize wearing a Curry Jersey, coming home from a bacation. I was waiting on my flight, furiously refreshing The Score app. They were promising real news any minute at this point. A guy approached me wearing a Cavs championship shirt and started poking fun. He was a good sport talking, but about the 3-1 choke and lebron's greatness etc. I was still refreshing every few seconds as I was chatting with him. The guy made a comment like, I bet we will beat you next year too, just as the page refreshed with a new article at the top. KEVIN DURANT TO SIGN WITH WARRIORS. I held the phone up to him and asked ""are you sure about that?"" His response was simply ""holy shit... is that real?"""
"Trae's dad:   ""He just knows what he wants to accomplish. I never think my son is going to join a super team unless they all come to Atlanta. He's just got too much pride to do that. Maybe that pride will backfire, but who knows. My son has seen it happen here in Oklahoma City with (Kevin Durant). He wasn't one of those who called him a cupcake, but he's seen the backlash of something like that happen."""
"Klay used to piss me off the most when the Cavs/Warriors were a thing. Like Steph is great, I get it. But it was just so demoralizing when you're facing off against the greatest shooter of all time and you stop him and he passes the ball off to a top 10 shooter of all time. Like fuck man what are you supposed to do? Got even worse after Durant came in because you'd stop Curry and then by some miracle you stop Klay and the he passes off to Kevin Fucking Durant.  Those Warriors teams were something else. I feel hashtag blessed that we were able to take just one series. During almost any other time in NBA history I think those Cavs teams take 3 of 4."
"Kevin Durant, and it's not that he's really good. He's just an uncompetitive douche. Who gets the eventual world champions to 3-1 and loses... THEN JOINS THEM NEXT YEAR! He's the most uncompetitive player in the league. Now that he's got a championship he leaves, he's a coward."
"If he was texting us up 3-1, doesnt that just prove he liked us and wanted to join us regardless of whether he thought we were some insurmountable obstacle that he should just give up on? How do you know he wouldnt have joined us even if he *had* won the chip with okc that year? He left us after 2 titles. Winning and championships are clearly not enough on their own for kevin durant. So why is it so hard for people to acknowledge that competition is not the only thing that factors into player free agency decisions?"
Kevin Durant
The ratings this year is kinda understandable. Curry went down and the warriors are straight unwatchabale  yet they still have so many nationally televised games. Kevin Durant the 3rd most popular player did not play either and his not even costar Kyrie played. Finally the Pelicans had so many televised games yet no Zion
"Overrated in my opinion. KD had some great moments on the Warriors like this one but I feel like something was missing. Like when get hit that shot over LeBron I wasn't as hyped about it. To me it would've been bigger if he was on OKC doing that shit like I finally beat this guy. This team finally got over the hump, ya know what I saying but he did it on a 73 win team that beat him so when He says Y'all know who I am, I'm Kevin Durant it's like dude, we been knew. 38-7-4 on the warriors is like a guaranteed w for them but 38-7-4 on OKC im not so sure tbh. I'm just rambling I guess idfk"
"Congratulations to Kevin Durant for showing a far inferior team who’s boss alongside another MVP, two All-NBA players and a SMOTY candidate"
"I remember waking up to a text from my uncle and he was like “man I can’t believe Kevin Durant actually went to Golden State”, so then I instantly check my phone and saw a bleacher report notification that he actually went there. So I go to the tv and make sure it’s actually true and it was. I was pissed. We actually had a July 4th cookout day but I was too much in a bad mood to enjoy it. I remember all day I was hoping KD would pull a DeAndre Jordan, where he fleeced the mavs, but then I saw video of KD already being in San Francisco smh Lmao"
Kevin Durant man
"Kevin Durant talking shit and bragging when his team of another MVP, two All-NBA players, and a SMOTY candidate helped him destroy the opponent was always hilarious"
Notable players in the NBA but not in that article off the top of my head:  Steph Curry.  Klay Thompson.  Kevin Durant.  Kyrie Irving.  Karl Anthony Towns.  Trae Young.
You need Steph Curry and Kevin Durant on your roster before signing Draymond
Curry wide open? Yeah okay whatever pal. Even in the Finals they left Kevin fucking Durant alone to cover Curry
I wouldn’t say they “fell off” the next year but the following players had very marginal differences at best from their peak season:  Shaquille O’Neal  Tim Duncan  Kevin Garnett  Dirk Nowitzki  Charles Barkley  Stephen Curry  Kevin Durant  Magic Johnson  Chris Paul  Dwyane Wade  Steve Nash  Giannis Antetokounmpo   Jerry West  Oscar Robertson  Reggie Miller  Scottie Pippen  James Harden  Klay/Dray  Paul Pierce  Bob McAdoo  Dwight Howard  Paul George  Walt Frazier  Sidney Moncrief  Willis Reed
"Yes, the Nets have angled themselves to fill the void the Rockets left in being the default team of China. Kevin Durant has easily made his contract bonuses back on Chinese merchandise"
"You Westbrook lovers are something else. There is zero chance Westbrook ever wins a title unless he dramatically changes and becomes an actual point guard or moves to the 2.   Basketball is a zero sum game. You want to maximize your shot attempts that get a high rate of return. Every Westbrook shot is statistically a bad one because it comes at the expense of a better shot/better shooter. Lowest IQ player in the league.   When you go for a coding interview they quiz you to see if you know anything about coding. I have a similar one for talking basketball. If I say what's the first thing that comes to mind when when I say Kevin Durant, James Harden and Russell Westbrook and you don't immediately respond with something like ""2 all-time greats and Russell Westbrook"" then its clear you don't understand team and how it relates to basketball."
"Damn 8th seeded Kevin Durant was 2nd in MVP in 2010, pretty crazy."
The 2010 Thunder won 50 games and were led by Kevin Durant who averaged 30 ppg.  The 2011 Grizzlies knocked off the 61-21 Spurs  and then nearly beat the 55-27 Thunder.
"Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, DeAndre Jordan, Spencer Dinwiddie, Wilson Chandler, Nicholas Claxton, &amp; Taurean Prince are not playing in the bubble.  Also, when we beat the Bucks the other day, LeVert, Allen, &amp; Harris were also not playing.  Jamal Crawford is out, having gotten a sprain in his debut with us v. Milwaukee."
Because they needed the cap space to sign a little known player named Kevin Durant
"Kinda insane to think that next season, whenever that is, this Nets team has yet to add Kyrie and Kevin fucking Durant lmao. Really easy to look at them and think this is still the D'Lo nets"
"I don't think that's the case. I mean his first regular season game on the Rockets he had 37 points. Then followed that up with 45...The man has talent that supersedes needing to ""learn how to take over"".  &amp;#x200B;  Could you imagine a team where the person with the last shot is either Westbrook, Harden or Kevin Durant? Like...who do you double team? I think that lineup is better than GS' big 3 of Steph/Klay/Draymond by miles."
In the words of the great Kevin Durant: He’s an idiot
"Suns fans literally called TJ ""Scorin Warren"" when he was with us. The dude has always been a walking bucket. I'm glad he's finally getting some recognition for his offensive prowess. The dude is a really crafty and consistent scorer who now has a reliable 3 pointer added to his arsenal.    And if people knew about MPJ when he was in high school his recent ascension shouldn't be surprising. He was super hyped at Mizzou but obviously only ended up playing a few games and then the injuries tanked his draft stock because he was always argued as a top 2 pick and a Kevin Durant-esque offensive threat outside of the big health concerns."
"&gt; yeah but im not sure kevin durant was on the radar like that  He was first team all american, won some player of the year awards, and was MVP of the McDonalds all-american game. He was considered the second best prospect in the country after Oden though."
"KD’s teams have been good defensively because of him.......His paint protection/rotations/and switch ability is a reason for it. Rewatch the 2016 playoffs he was elite on that end before even joining the warriors.....  He was the reason for their elite D.  Also, KD doesn’t struggle against Double teams the way Steph does, He can literally see/pass right over them due to height. KD struggles with crowded space, Congested areas because of his high dribble like you said. I also wouldn’t use the Grizzles series as indication for him struggling agaisnt doubles because one, doubles isn’t the coverage they used on KD, and 2, He was 23 and his second best player was Kevin Martin.  It seems like you have a KD hate boner. I always see you in ‘unpopular opinion thread ragging on Durant’    Also, Why are you using the Grizzles series to claim he’s"
"lol do you remember last year, one of the GS threads in the playoffs had the title ""Kevin Durant shows his continued brilliance"" or some shit. Hate when people shove their opinion/commentary into a game thread title"
"the warriors were missing kevin durant and klay thompson  i dont want to diminish the raptors title, but any team that has kevin durant and klay thompson on the roster, and those players are not available, is goign to have a fucking hard time  those are 2 very very good players"
"yeah but im not sure kevin durant was on the radar like that  the bargs draft was truly horrendous, the best player you couldve gotten instead was probably lamarcus aldridge or kyle lowry, a reach for paul millsap or brandon roy for 3 years"
"The only animosity I bear towards Stern as a Raps fan is that we could've selected Kevin Durant in 2006 if Stern hadn't changed the rule on draft eligibility.  Instead, we selected a 7 foot tall bag of pasta."
Yeah I have and it’s not guard Kevin Durant
"Sorry but in my opinion no one is legitimately guarding Kevin Durant, and I mean no disrespect to the legends. He is a human cheat code that has mastered a game to his advantage. He has the speed and handles of a guard while being able to knock down shots over anyone from the elbow alongside with being a good 3 point shooter."

"I mean after the recent DeSean Jackson/Stephen Jackson antisemitism stuff, I wouldn't be surprised if many players hold some racist views in some way or another.  Especially considering how several high profile NBA figures (e.g. Allen Iverson, Kevin Durant) seem to be fans of Louis Farrakhan, who hasn't been exactly subtle about his hatred of Jews, white people, or gay people."
I’m pretty sure that drama was about Kevin Durant complaining all the time.
"What does the name ""Kevin Durant"" mean to you?"
He's not as cowardly and weak as Kevin Durant so probably not
"Kemba is ARGUABLY the best player on the Celtics. Obviously, Tatum will eclipse him, but a team with 5 Kemba caliber players is better than a team with like 1 Kevin Durant and absolute garbage around him. This kind of statement is pointless."
"“but it’s pretty glaring we need one more piece or two more pieces that will complement myself, KD [Kevin Durant], DJ [DeAndre Jordan], GT [Garrett Temple], Spence [Dinwiddie], Caris [LeVert], and we’ll see how that evolves  Let me just call out the team and praise my friends that suck while not mentioning players that are actually good"
Kevin Durant
y'all just don't understand Kevin Durant has to wake up at 8:30 every morning
The all time 3rd eye woke Truth team   SF - Kevin Durant  PF - Michael Porter Jr  C - Dwight Howard  SG - Spencer Dinwiddie  PG - Kyrie Irving  Coach - Paul Pierce
Kevin “the hardest road” Durant knows a thing or two about ‘raw truth’
"I would say because single players can make such a huge difference in basketball, it would make sense to define eras by a few players.  1960s - Bill Russell/Wilt Chamberlain/Jerry West/Oscar Roberson  1970s - Kareem Abdul Jabbar/Bill Walton/Walt Frazier/Dr. Julius Erving  1980s - Magic Johnson/Larry Bird/Isiah Thomas/Moses Malone  1990s - Michael Jordan/Hakeem Olajuwon/Scottie Pippen/Shaq  2000s - Shaq/Kobe Bryant/Tim Duncan/Allen Iverson  2010s - Lebron James/Stephen Curry/Kawhi Leonard/Kevin Durant  2020s - Giannis/Luka Doncic/AD/RJ Barrett"
"Loyalty is valued, but only to an extent. Since Devin Booker is a star and the Suns are trash, I'm sure very few people would hold it against him. The reason players Like Kobe and Tim Duncan are respected for their loyalty is because they were drafted into very good situations. Kevin Durant is slammed for leaving because he left a top contender and joined a team that just broke the record for regular season wins."
"Common is a relative term but [here's some NBA data on Achilles tears from 2015](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/basketball/news/history-not-kind-for-ruptured-achilles-recovery/) (I figure most are familiar with those who've torn them since then).   Being a bit older, the thing for me that sticks out is how easily we can watch and re-watch crazy injuries these days. It's drilled into my head that Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles because I watched it happen a million times in slow motion.  In contrast, I remember Isiah Thomas' career ending on an Achilles tear because I'm a Pistons fan. And I remember Dominique Wilkins rupturing his Achilles because he was a superstar and came back to average 30 a night. But a lot of those other guys on that list - LaPhonso Ellis, Maurice Taylor, Gerald Wilkins - all I remember is that they got injured for a while. I didn't even realize it was Achilles related. Just seems way easier to hyper-focus on injuries like that today.   That's kind of separate from your question but that link just brought it all to mind."
"Are you serious, after failing to grab Durant in the Draft due to Celtics falling low on the order. He brought in Ray Allen &amp; Kevin Garnett. They won a Championship &amp; went to another one. He then got Jayson Tatum &amp; Jaylen Brown from Nets pick. Drafted Robert Williams late in the round. His only miss was not taking Giannis, but so are 14 other teams"
"&gt;context?  Kevin Durant is a bitch, that's your context"
"Take a seat young nephew  Back in the day before r/nba was absolutely garbage, the warriors and Cavs were fighting epic duels for the championship.   ""It is bad for the league,"" they said. ""No one wants to watch the same two teams every year! What is the point?!""  So Kevin of House Durant took it upon himself to end that shit real quick  Rather than deal with the nonsense of trying to *stop* the warriors and possibly *compete* with a formidable foe, he just made the competition between two teams a competition of one, and thus the warriors dynasty was solidified.  What could've possibly been a split between the Cavs and Warriors championships turned into a forgone conclusion and the back-to-back championships seemed as easy to predict as hot takes in a post game thread."
i did not follow the nba prior to 1.5 yrs ago i hoewver knew lebron (cause lebron) steph (throwing a 3 1 lead meme) and kevin durant (joining the team that beat you meme) so i think these 3 make the cut (btw from europe)
"I see this argument a lot but I think this is just another attempt to find any excuse to delegitimize athletes that are part of traditionally marginalized demographics. Particularly when many of these athletes do a lot to give back to their community, such as LeBron who built a damn school in his neighborhood and he came from essentially nothing. I don’t have any statistics on how many came from nothing but it’s probably more than you think. LeBron and Kevin Durant came from single mother homes.  I’d agree with you that these guys may not be the most in touch with the working class but I do think that if they have this kind of platform, they have a duty to help the marginalized communities, especially when they come from them themselves.  Also, it might be a kids game but you watch it don’t you? Are all sports kids games? Does that mean you watch kids games all day on TV? Do you have an issue with white athletes getting paid millions of dollars for kids games? Or do you like it because they shut their mouths? Oh but now they’re speaking out against racial injustices and inequality so now you don’t wanna watch anymore? Do you see the slippery slope?  Edit: Removed Zion from single mother homes, that was incorrect"
Kevin Durant
I chanted “Russell Westbrook” at Kevin Durant while he shot free throws at a game his first year with Golden State. It felt right
Kevin Durant
I'm pretty new to basketball. Are steph curry and kevin durant actually as good as TJ Warren?
Billy Donovan:  Westbrook   Paul George  Kevin Durant  Al Horford   Steven Adams  Chris Paul  ~~Joakim Noah~~  ~~Carmelo Anthony~~
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, Wilt Chamberlain  Bench: Chris Mullin, Rick Barry, Tim Hardaway, Nate Thurmond, Bernard King or Tim Hardaway"
"As was posted below (but not written where people will see it), he said Kevin Durant is the one right after that. So I guess Lebron's reign lasted 4 seconds."
Jason Kidd  Vince Carter  Julius Erving  Kevin Durant  Brook Lopez
https://twitter.com/Le0verrated/status/1290859799110983680  Did you watch what he said immediately following that statement lol?  “Kevin Durant is the one man. The one.”  He said the exact same thing about KD right after what he said about Lebron. Some fan boy just edited it out. AI’s version of ‘the one’ apparently just means an all time great player like Lebron and KD.
"&gt; KD literally said he thought it was unfair for the Warriors to only get D-Lo through a sign-and-trade with the Nets last off-season, which is why he made the Nets include a first round pick.   KD insisted the Warriors give the Nets a protected first round pick, you dingus.  Not the other way around.  https://sports.yahoo.com/kevin-durant-made-the-warriors-sweeten-the-signandtrade-for-d-angelo-russell-165200122.html  &gt; First, Durant initially balked at being traded for Russell straight up, multiple sources said. He didn't think it was a fair deal, and in this case, the Warriors had to not just satisfy the Nets, but also Durant.  &gt; Leverage was applied by the player, and **Golden State had to include a first-round pick before Durant would agree to sign off.** The Warriors begrudgingly gave it up and did so with a heavy condition: If the pick falls within the top 20 next year, they don't have to send it, and instead will only give Brooklyn a second-round pick ... in six years. It's one of the most unusual pick protections the NBA has seen recently."
"What a great stretch of basketball in the final 5 minutes. Kawhi going takeover mode during the clutch is just insane, the only player on that level is Kevin Durant, no one else is even close."
[KD literally said](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/02/06/kevin-durant-i-never-considered-playing-for-the-knicks/amp/)  how nobody would ever go to the Knicks?  Edit; a word
Kevin Durant wouldn’t be too bad...
For years if Kevin Durant coughed the media would say Westbrook gave him a cold
My coworker told me Idk basketball cause I don't agree with his opinion that AI is better than Kevin Durant

"Most players called by their first names have unique first names.  LeBron. Giannis. Zion. Luka. Kyrie. Kawhi.  You don't hear anyone say Michael (Jordan), James (Harden), Kevin (Durant), Anthony (Davis), etc."
"I feel like he gets respect here, clearly, but whenever I talk about him in the real world people just think he’s another “good” player.  But yeah, maybe the Warriors thing diminished him too much in the mainstream especially when prior to that he was basically Kevin “Not Lebron” Durant."
"The Kevin Durant effect.  Look up after 3 quarters and he's got 28. And you're like, how?"

"Or rebuild like the Nets, just sign Kyrie and trade for Kevin Durant  It's that simple, folks. Catch up!"
"Here's a guy who's graduated from Michigan's Ross School of Business (which is generally considered a top 3-5 undergrad business school along with Wharton, Stern, Sloan, and so on) with a 3.9 GPA.   JD cum laude from Michigan Law, interned at Winston &amp; Strawn (I think one of the oldest law firm in the Midwest).    Started his career as a sports agent, representing Iguodala, Channing Frye, Eric Gordon, Andre Drummond,  James Harden, Kevin Durant, and of course Kobe Bryant.   An agent that was responsible for some of the biggest contract negotiations such as Iggy, Boozer, Kobe, Harden... would not know how the cap space works."
"Ernie Grunfeld, still. He fucked the team over so badly in 2016 that the effects lasted until this day, and probably beyond.  For starters, Frank Vogel was available, but instead Grunfeld hired Scott Brooks and instantly made a top 5 coach, in terms of salary. Gave him 5 years at $35M, after being on no one's radar. Meanwhile, Frank Vogel was hired by Southeast Division foe, the Orlando Magic.  After Kevin Durant clearly and adamantly stated he would not like to play in his hometown (area), Grunfeld arrogantly pursued him in free agency, but KD paid him dust, while making a visit to Boston.  Al Horford was the next option for a (near) max contract, but he chose to play for the Celtics. Then, Grunfeld (seemingly) made a panic signing of Ian Mahinmi for 4 years and $64M! Mahinmi was recovering from injury, by the way, so that makes total sense for an injured, non-starting, 30+ year old center. He also signed another 30+ year old C in Jason Smith (bringing the total to 3, including Marcin Gortat), as well as Andrew Nicholson.  The 2016-17 season started off rough, with a 3-8 record, and soon after trade season began, Nicholson was packaged in a trade, along with first round pick, for Bojan Bogdanovic. *That pick became Jarrett Allen, which hurts because Washington sorely needed a young C with defensive capabilities.*  Bogdanovic provided Washington with some much needed bench scoring, but he was not very effective during that playoff run. After the season, he left, so they burned a first round pick on a rental. And, that was the fourth or fifth consecutive season without a backup PG staying for more than a season.   Otto Porter received a max deal, and John Wall received a supermax extension, but all of this other stuff was well before the supermax kicked in. Since then, Washington has only been able to sign players on vet minimum deals or using the MLE, but Grunfeld still handed out unnecessary player options (Jodie Meeks received one), or players wouldn't return for the next season."
"&gt;Harden has played with Chris Paul, Kevin Durant and westbrook with a competent coach and front office his whole career.  Harden led a team of Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, Patrick Beverley, Trevor Ariza and Capela to 56 wins. His historical win record without Dwight Howard or Chris Paul is also much higher than AD.  By the way, Ryan Anderson was a bench player for the Pelicans, but the starting power forward for the Houston Rockets."
"Harden has played with Chris Paul, Kevin Durant and westbrook with a competent coach and front office his whole career.   AD has played with injury prone Jrue and half a season of Demarcus Cousins before tearing his achilles.   Harden is better but you have little to no proof AD can’t lead a team, this is his first time playing on a decent and competent team and they’ve secured first seed 60 games in.    I really don’t see any player except Lebron taking those pelican teams much further than AD did and even he’d struggle.   Dude swept the third seed blazers without his best team mate. What proof do you have he can’t lead a team?"
"No, I never said that. Chris Paul is a great shooter, especially in the midrange. Steph is literally the greatest shooter to ever walk the earth. In my opinion it’s less about the fact that steph “scores more” and more to do with the way his scoring threat twists defenses into absolute knots. Give him an inch and he’ll pull up from 35 and stick a dagger in your eye. Even when Durant was on the team defenders would help off him to deny steph 30+ foot looks. They would leave Kevin Durant, former MVP and one of the greatest scorers ever, just to deny steph what would be a bad shot for all but a handful of players in league history up to that point. Saying that his incredible three point shooting is the “only thing” he has over CP3 really understates the insane value that it provides to his teams.   I’m not saying you can’t be a great PG in the modern game playing the way paul does (I mean, he’s proving that right now), but the present and future of truly elite point guard play will be in the mould of the steph currys of the world.  Steph has had greater team success, even pre Durant, has won two MVPs, and helped open the eyes of the world to how important the three really is. IMO that makes him the best PG of the past 20 years, and it really isn’t even that close."
Kevin Durant... lol
I don’t think Jesus could have found a way to beat the Warriors with Kevin Durant
"&gt; If LeBron were the goat, he would have found a way to beat the Warriors even with Kevin Durant. Some people will blame Kyrie, I'm just saying I think MJ would've found a way.  I doubt it"
"&gt;If LeBron were the goat, he would have found a way to beat the Warriors even with Kevin Durant.  This is VERY unfair to say lmao"
Do you acknowledge that the risk of returning too soon from a calf injury is to injury your Achilles.  Kevin Durant questionably came back and tore his Achilles.  that is pretty damning evidence.    What’s the medical team going to say “oh yeah he wasn’t ready and we sent him out there anyway” lol get real. And KD is a baller of course he’s going to want to play in the finals.
"Lol you’re the one who claimed I’ve been repeating myself, not me. Must be in denial about what I’m saying, or you just want the last word. Lol  Raptors fans and laughing at Kevin Durant getting injured. Name a better duo.  All jokes aside, if he wasn’t ready to play neither KD or the medical staff would’ve allowed him to.  You can keep trying to spin it, but it’s just not true."
BI and Zion are just Kevin Durant and an XXXL Steph Curry.
Exactly. The injured warriors team lost in 6 games to the Raptors.  Me voicing my opinion isn’t “pretending to know the outcomes of an alternate universe”. It’s not really unreasonable to think the warriors getting Kevin Durant back (and Klay) would help them win the series.
"What context is necessary? Nothing you’ve said has refuted the fact the series went 6 games which isn’t dominating.   But...Yup, the Raptors fan claiming the Raptors would’ve taken the series to 7 (if were cutting the BS, we both know you think they’d win but didn’t want to admit it) if the Warriors got the second best player on the planet back. I’m the one who’s lacked reasoning! LOL  The warriors would win in 5 games if they had Kevin Durant. Sorry dude."
"Players have done similar things.   See: Durant, Kevin."
"Probably a combination of changing his playstyle, his body changing, and coaching. He said once his favorite player in Kevin Durant so it would have made sense that he modeled his jumpshot like that as a kid but now it just doesn't work"
"Kevin Durant, ironically."
"Not necessarily true and I actually would bet against them. They don't have the bigs to fuck with an Embid, Giannis and Joker combo and with Luka the tides have turned.  You could have a starting line up of Embid at the 5 and Giannis at the 4. You then surround them with shooters. I would start Bojan at the 3 because he would have so much room to pop treys but he would split minutes with Pascal because obviously he is deserving of the starting position . Then you have Luka as your primary ball handler. Your weak spot is the 2 guard but just put another guy who can shoot the long ball like Evan Fournier and your spacing would be ridiculous.  Giannis and Embid would demand constant double teams and whichever of those 3 players are on the court would have open 3s all day.  You could even play Bojan and Pascal at the same time and have Pascal guard Harden having a giant team to go at team USA. Then you have Joker as your back up big man who is arguably the best passer in the NBA. I would personally put Marc Gasol as my other backup big man because he can play more of a power forward role and space the floor. He has the brains and would be fine with a more limited role. Ben simmons is your back up point guard most likely matching up with Lillard and he could destroy him in the post and potentially slow him down with his elite defense.  Again they are weak at the 2 guard position but add someone like Buddy Hield who can launch open threes and your spacing is going to look tasty for all of these rim rollers. If you can get away with considering KAT as part of the rest of the world team (I don't like using someone who spent their entire life stateside but technically he's allowed to represent Dominican so fuck it) then he adds another ridiculous amount of space to the team.  If he isn't available put Davis Bertans out there and see what he can do with real basketball players around him and open looks. Dude has a stroke that makes your mom blush. Gobert can be your last bench player who really wouldn't play with all the great bigs before him but he would be a great insurance piece if Embid gets hurt as the guy who blocks every ones shot for 15 minutes.  Otherwise add Gallinari for another guy who can create his own shot. You have 2 elite players at every position except the shooting guard where they are noticeably weak. Also not sure if you would consider Bojan elite but Pascal is absolutely a top small forward in this league.  If you give team World KAT then I think they win but its a close game and I might lean towards USA if they don't have him but even then I think its a toss up. My last point is this all depends on how good Kevin Durant is. If he is his old self then I lean USA but if he's not quite that dude then I don't think USA can keep up with the tenacity and dominance of Giannis and Embid.  Edit: I forgot about Dragic who could possibly start as the second guard with Luka taking a spot from Fournier or Hield. Its ridiculous but Porzingus is also an option for a big man who might not be needed with the depth already mentioned at the big man positions."
"In a league where leBron, Kevin Durant and James Harden exist makes your point trash."
"The situation is this:  1.[Stephen Curry](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html) 470  2.[Ray Allen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html) 385  3.[LeBron James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) 375  4.[Klay Thompson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html) 374  5.[Manu Ginóbili](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/ginobma01.html) 324  6.[Reggie Miller](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millere01.html) 320  7.[Kevin Durant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html) 304  8.[Kobe Bryant](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html) 292  9.[J.R.

Playing a lot of playoffs games is for sure not garanteed for anybody.  \- If we look below in the list of active players Kawhi and George are too far with 184 and 177.  People tends to take for granted having many playoffs games played. It's not, at all."
PG - Steph Curry  SG - Michael Jordan  SF - LeBron James  PF - Kevin Durant  C - Shaq
I’d trade 1 Kevin Durant
"Yeah, similar to the guys who say ""Spurs would have won if Kawhi was healthy"", just playing that what if game. He wasn't, and most of his team wasn't, before the series started. What I did see from the teams those playoffs were that the Warriors were too strong; even at full strength Kawhi it going over 6 was going to be near impossible - they literally couldn't double KD without Curry dismantling them. Kawhi has had huge issues with KD in a ton of games throughout his career, because it seems being seven feet tall with long arms and a wet jumper is impossible to defend, so fundamentally, he would not have changed the strategic balance of the series too much, the firepower was just too much.  I could go into a deep dive on how the Warriors system after the 2016 finals was tweaked specifically to deal with defensive adjustments by adding more free movement and leaving the triangle roots of the system as more of an offensive initiation, and why that added level of randomness is much like Ichiro's hitting in baseball: you can't adjust to what you don't know, so you're forced to give your best effort and hope it's enough. It may not be as efficient as controlled movement, but you can't predict it, and if you have enough talent, that should be enough to create an open shot. Then I can show how the Spurs adjustments just utterly failed every time because of this. It isn't because Pop made bad calls; his adjustments were spot on to what was happening, it's just that there was no actual defensive system you can create for the 2017 Warriors because they had Steph fucking Curry and Kevin fucking Durant in their primes.  We don't know, but we can make educated guesses. Personally, I understand why people cheered for the Spurs so much, everyone wanted to see those Warriors lose. But they were fundamentally less talented and physically spent. With Kawhi they might have eked out a couple of wins, but we've seen the Warriors (and Steph Curry specifically) will themselves to the next round even when skill isn't the only factor."
Anthony Davis decided to become Kevin Durant in those catch and shoot midranges huh
Kevin Durant about to sign with the Blazers after seeing Carmelo Anthony hit all those shots.
Guys off topic but I miss Kevin Durant playing basketball 😓😢😦
Not without Kevin Durant
"Imagine the Blazers had drafted Kevin Durant as their #1 pick, it would be KD playing in the place of Mario Hezonja/Melo or whoever is playing at 3."
1. Kevin Durant 2. Kyrie Irving 3. Manu Ginobili 4. Yao Ming 5. Draymond Green 6. Kevin McHale 7. Tim Duncan 8. Stephen Curry 9. Donovan Mitchell (He’s not in his prime yet but I think I’d end up taking prime Mitchell) 10. Damian Lillard 11. James Harden
"https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/08/report-kawhi-leonard-asked-jimmy-butler-to-pair-up-before-paul-george/  &gt;In an appearance on ESPN’s “Rich Eisen Show,” Stein reported Leonard had not only reached out to Kevin Durant before George, he also spoke to Jimmy Butler, who has since relocated from Philadelphia to Miami."
- Kevin Durant - Gary Payton  - Manu Ginobili - Nikola Jokic - Draymond Green - Pau Gasol - Tim Duncan  - Stephen Curry - Donovan Mitchell - Damian Lillard  - James Harden
1. \*Larry Bird\* over Kevin Durant 2. \*Gary Payton\* over Kyrie Irving 3. \*Manu Ginobili\* over Vince Carter  4. \*Nikola Jokic\* over Yao Ming 5. \*Draymond Green\* over Dennis Rodman 6. \*Kevin McHale\* over Pau Gasol 7. \*Tim Duncan\* over Giannis Antetokounmpo 8. \*Stephen Curry\* over Dwyane Wade  9. \*Baron Davis\* over Donovan Mitchell 10. \*Steve Nash\* over Damian Lillard  11. \*James Harden\* over Allen Iverson
If thats Kevin durant thats a flagrant. Lebron gets penalized for trying to score there instead of flailing.
"I don't think you understand what happened with the Warriors trade.  Edit: I'm realizing this comment was just snarky and not helpful, even if it was true. Kevin Durant didn't get traded straight-up for DLo and a few smaller pieces (I don't remember any pick being in the trade, but I could be wrong) because that was a fair value. Kevin Durant was forcing his way out of the team and was about to hit free agency, and had rather publicly declared that he was going to test the market and not re-sign. The Warriors gave him up for *relative* peanuts because everyone knew they had no leverage. If memory serves, Golden State initially got even less for him, and KD made Brooklyn throw in more to sweeten the deal because he didn't feel it was fair for Golden State to lose him for nothing. Very Caeser-esque."
am I the only person who watches the NBA that understands they give the players amphetamines during the playoffs?     remember an injured kevin durant playing last year? same deal. all TWEAKED THE FUCK UP
"Yes they are number way below a max contract?? Does he look like a James harden, klay thompson, lebron, Leonard, Kevin Durant? He’ll no. Kris Middleton isn’t bad but his defensive is absurd and he’s shaky on offense. Do u think this guy is worth a max contract? He’s an overhyped player who can only play offense half the time. He’s just not the player they need to support Giannis"
"Kevin Durant always talked about how much he loves oklahoma city, no way he would ever leave"
Kevin durant is the best example
"Yeah the 3-10 ft stuff is interesting Ive wasted a bunch of time looking at it in the past am always interested in seeing who's teh best at inefficient shots  Highest career % from 3-10 ft Ive seen is Joe Johnson. Like 50.1%. Im talking non bigs.   Chris Paul is close in the 48-49% range. Sam Cassell is also really high near there. If you dont count Boris Diaw as a big he's in this area also.    Kawhi, Jarrett Jack, DWade, Kobe, Kevin Durant, those are some other good ones in that range 45-46%. Filters on range are also different [NBA.com has Chris Paul as 52/61 on shots 2 ft or less which is in line with that bball reference stat because I wanted to look up what the misses looked like](https://go.nba.com/xwyyp) he was 57/75 on 3 ft or less.  For bigs Nikola Jokic is the king of this.  Durant is absurd on the mid range. His 3 yrs in GSW including playoffs your talking about someone who was 51-52% in the 16-22 ft area."
"So, here's my super unofficial probably biased reasoning for this:  Kareem: 2 scoring titles, 6 year peak of 30.4 PPG, 38k points, 24.6 career PPG, 2 scoring titles, career 59% true shooting  MJ: 10 scoring titles, career 30.1 PPG, 32k points, 7 year peak of 33.2 PPG, 57% career true shooting percentage, insane for a 90's guard.  Kevin Durant: 4 scoring titles, career 27 PPG, 5 year peak of 29.3 PPG, career 49/38/88, career 61% true shooting, 23k points so far  Kobe: 6 year run of 29.7 PPG, 2 scoring titles, 25 PPG, 33.6K points, 55% true shooting, deceptively impressive for an iso guard in the 2000's.  Wilt: 7 scoring titles, career 30.1 PPG, 7 year run of 39.6 PPG, 31.4K points.  Harden: Career 25.2 PPG, 3 scoring titles, 6 year run of 30.9 PPG, 21K points so far, career 61% true shooting.  I don't know if Malone is in first tier or not, nearly 37k points on efficiency, 6 year run of 28.6 PPG, but never won a scoring title, though he played with Jordan.   I would say the next tier consists of Shaq, Dirk, Dr. J, Steph Curry,"
Nah. His ceiling is Kevin Durant
"No. Just because you think he made a bad decision or a soft decision doesn’t affect his skill as a basketball player. He’s still Kevin Durant regardless of the jersey he’s wearing, that’s his point."
"Some semblance of order:  Oscar Robertson, Kevin Durant, Shaq, Hakeem, Moses Malone, Dirk, Elgin Baylor, Dr. J, John Havlecick, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley.  Yeah that's 11 I know"
Kevin Durant on the Rockets 👀
11. Hakeem Olajuwon   12. Kevin Durant   13. Moses Malone   14. Julius Erving   15. Oscar Robertson   16. David Robinson   17. Stephen Curry   18. Kevin Garnett   19. Dirk Nowitzki   20. Jerry West
"With Fred, Kyle, and norm on the roster already with their ballhandling/ shot making as a raps fan I’d rather have OG for his elite defense being able to lockdown the best player on the other team while hitting 3’s. You need a guy that’s able to slow down elite wings and Nobody else on the raps roster can do it (pascal is a good on ball defender but he’s better off ball). 23 year old elite 3 and D wings who can lockdown 1-4 don’t grow on trees, even though levert is a way better offensive player and better overall I’d rather have OG for the team currently.   For the nets though, that would be a *great* trade with Kevin durant and kyrie coming next year."
"Against...An injured Golden State Warriors without Kevin Durant (their best player) and without Klay for 1 game and a quarter.  KD and Klay plays and the Raptors get swept, in fact if only Klay plays the Warriors win that series."
Kevin Durant has left the chat
It’s not even that imo. It’s “Kevin Durant wants him so we better fucking hire him” privilege.
Sounds like he needs Kevin Durant lmao
"Roughly in no order  1. Michael Jordan 2. Bil Russel 3. Elgin Baylor 4. Jerry West 5. Dr J 6. Wilt Chamberlain 7. Hakeem 8 Kareem 9. Magic 10. Larry Bird 11. Charles Barkley 12. David Robinson 13. Shaq 14. Tim Duncan 15. Karl Malone 16. Kobe 17. Lebron James 18. Chris Paul 19. Kevin Garnett 20. Harden 21. Kawhi 22. Curry 23. Giannis 24. Pippen 25. Zeke 26. Dwight Howard 27. Kevin Durant 28. Oscar Robertson 29. Dirk Nowitzki  30. Dwayne Wade 31. Steve Nash 32. Moses Malone 33. Iverson 34. Stockton 35. Lowkey guys like Chauncey Billups, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce"
I think we are taking shutting down to mean some Tony Allen on Kevin Durant throughout a series type thing whereas I imagine Kobe just defended Dame for some possessions and maybe Dame didn't shoot or something else happened. That seems pretty plausible without going back to watch the game.
The European Kevin Durant
"Obviously the team that has James Harden, Chris Paul, and Kevin Durant on it.  But the Warriors were already handing Harden his ass before KD was even in the picture.  You could argue that Harden was better than Steph the past two years.  I could argue that it was only because Steph was deferring to KD and that we've seen who was better when it was his own team."
Scared? Lol Kevin Durant wasn’t scared when he demolished Lebron in back to back finals
"Hell no lol. Its just the Celtics.   He aint better than, Lebron, Kawhi, AD, Kevin Durant, Curry, etc. Not even close."
Kevin durant
"Pascal would be more effective if he limits his 3pt attempts to 4 to 5 a game. The less the better.  The Raptors' problem is whenever Siakam makes a 3, he somehow convinces himself he's Kevin Durant and forgets he's not a shooter. At one point he was 1 for 11 or something. He'll literally shoot you out of the game if you let him."
"lol they had thompson for 5 games, if the warriors didn’t want to be terrible because of two injuries then they should have had a real bench instead of signing kevin durant"
"No, Kevin Durant is not at his best setting screens, rolling and getting put backs LMAO"
He'd be Kevin Durant 2.0 if he joins us.
Kevin Durant has entered the chat
"I was looking at different players' FG% by location and I noticed some really interesting things that make sense from watching these players. I'm too lazy to link, but these were all taken from Basketball Reference. I couldn't find league average shooting numbers by location, if anyone knows where to find that please let me know. I'm sure Kirk Goldsberry would know.  * Montrezl Harrell is a 6'8 center who can't shoot reliably outside of 10 feet---over 91% of his shots are taken from 10 feet and in. But he makes it work by shooting 70.5% from within 3 feet, and a decent 44% from 3-10 feet thanks to his weird floaters/flippy shots. I think in a previous era, he'd be an undersized PF who's lack of shooting wouldn't be much of an issue.  * Giannis shoots an incredible 78% at the rim (within 3 feet). For comparison, Shaq shot 74% at the rim in his career, peaking at 79.2 % in 2000-01. (Sidenote, BBRef says ""*Shot location data available for the 1996-97 through 2019-20 seasons. Shot type and location data quality from the 1990s is inconsistent, esp. 1996-97*"") However, his shooting plummets to 34% from 3-10 feet. It's clear why when you watch him. If Giannis gets to the rim, he is dunking it or ~~laying it in~~ dunking it. If you've managed to stop him 3 or more feet away, he is throwing up garbage over multiple defenders, as he doesn't have a reliable floater or jump hook. He also bypasses long and midrange 2's to shoot 3's (poorly), 4.7 per game this past year at 30.4%. Of course, this make sense, but you'd like to see him get that shooting to league average.  * Kevin Durant had an incredibly efficient shooting season last year, on a fairly even distribution of shots taken by distance. He ""only"" shot 35% (roughly league average) from 3 on 5 attempts per game, but he shot 75% from 0-3 ft, 54% from 3-10, 52% from 10-16, and 53.5% from 16-3pt. Yes, KD is so proficient on long 2s that he makes them an efficient shot. For reference, Dirk Nowitzki, one of the first names to come to mind when it comes to mid-range proficiency, shot about 47% for his career from 10-16 and 16-3pt.  * I never realized just how efficient Chris Paul is. While he barely gets to the rim, with just 7% of his shots coming within 3 feet this regular season, he shot 85% from there lol. He made 51% of his shots from 3-10 feet, 52% from 10-16 feet, 53% on long twos (30% of his shots came from there), and 36.5% on threes. For his career, he's 62/49/48/46/37 from those respective distances.  * One of the main principles for the three point explosion is the simple fact that a 3 is worth 50% more than points than a midrange shot/long two, but it isn't *50% harder to make it.* In prior eras, it was common for some players to shoot decently well all the way out to 20-22 feet or so, and then get a lot worse on 3's. DeMar DeRozan is a throwback in this respect---this past season he shot a respectable 43% on long twos, but a ghastly 26% (yes that's rounded up) on 3's, making those long twos actually more efficient for him. (Quick math: If he takes 100 two pointers and makes 43, that's 86 points. If he takes 100 threes and makes 26, that's only 78 points.) Of course, we know that DeRozan doesn't like shooting 3's, as he took less than one per game each of the last two seasons."
"For the sake of trying to answer your question I think all of these guys at least have an arguments chance against Westbrook: *Bill Russell *Wilt Chamberlain  *Shaq *Hakeem *Kareem *Magic Johnson *John Stockton  *Michael Jordan *Steve Nash *Kobe *Jerry West *Oscar Robertson  *Steph Curry *Kevin Durant *Larry Bird *Lebron *Tim Duncan *Scottie Pippen *D-Wade *Kahwi  *Kevin Garnett  *Harden *Isiah Thomas *Karl Malone *Charles Barkley *Dirk  *CP3 *Elgin Baylor *Dr J *Moses Malone *Giannis  *Iverson *George Mikan (I know, I know) *David Robinson *Brian Scalabrine"
If he joins the Heat he'd get so much more shit than Kevin Durant
If they can't beat Jimmy Butler and Goran Dragic they ain't beating Kyrrie Irving and Kevin Durant

"Houston’s might have secretly been the second best team in the league from 2015-2020 but had kept running in to GSW. Houston’s defense gave Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant problems. The Lakers don’t have any shooters who are even close to that. If they don’t find a way to get creators on the floor then they are going to struggle to score over 100 most nights."
"Wow first of all, where to even start. He was the second option on every single iteration of the okc sans 2016-2017. That’s it. That’s the aberration. Paul George was arguably better their first year, and hands down better the next year.   Russ has never been in mvp talks outside of 2016, you made that up. The highest he’s ever gotten is 4th, but so has Dame, and nobody is calling Dame an MVP candidate. The voters stop giving a shit after the top 3, and 2 of those years he was fourth, he didn’t get a single first place vote.   This is not regency bias. This is confirmation of who has been his entire career, he’s just been blessed with a team most nba stars who languish in small markets would murder for. Presti managed to draft well enough to cover up how atrocious Westbrook has been. Anyone would look great playing next to Kevin Durant."
"What are you talking about? LeBron has already defeated Kawhi to win the title once in 2013. [LeBron also defeated Curry/Klay/Dray in 2016](https://youtu.be/xzVM0Y9qdLs). Sure a Lakers/Clippers matchup would be a **Thrilla in Manilla** rubber match for Kawhi/LBJ but let’s not pretend that LBJ hasn’t beaten Kawhi already. Also, Kawhi needs to make it out of the second round first. If he can’t take care of the Nuggets over the next 1-2 games, then I don’t want to hear anything about him being on the same level as LBJ.  As to the Warriors, their three best players weren’t the most athletic guys to begin with and are now on the wrong side of 30. They’re going to need to make the playoffs again before we start thinking of them as still being on LeBron’s level and they don’t have prime-moody Kevin Durant to bail them out anymore."
"you're right I could, I just don't feel the KD warriors deserve respect after kevin fucking durant joined the golden state fucking warriors. they achieved a level of greatness that, in my opinion, they reached illegitimately just because the best scorer on the planet is insecure and wanted an easy ring. that, or, man was never meant to be that good at basketball. either way the thing is just unnatural.  a regular ass superteam is okay in my made up rules if they join together before winning a title  &amp;#x200B;  however, I also remember the day lebron announced coming to miami. I remember when shaq came to miami. good times"
" -Shaquille O'Neal  -Steve Nash -Dwight Howard -Chris Bosh -Grant Hill -Kevin Garnett -Kevin Durant -LeBron James -Dwyane Wade  -Anthony Davis -Kawhi Leonard  -Kyrie Irving -Paul George  Not a super long list, but some of the biggest names to play in the last 2 decades. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does it's a generational talent leaving whatever sorry team drafted them to go to a big team. So the teams that historically have gotten screwed over in those situations will always be salty about it."
They need Kevin Durant
i don’t know if they’d be better than the lakers but kevin durant.
The very same show that featured a cameo from Kevin Durant and ^^Lisa^Ann
The whole show is a treat to watch. It’s good for if you want to binge or go at your own pace.    Plus Kevin Durant makes a guest appearance in this show!
He’s Kevin Durant but didn’t join a super team
"The mid range is too important to win games and championships. D-Wade, Kevin Durant, Kawhi, even Stephen Curry takes mid range shots and they are all champions and MVP/FMVP's. I don't see why some players don't take those damn shots."
Wasn't the second bit of the first sentence from the Draymond Green to KD shout that got Green suspended and helped push KD out ?  https://www.slamonline.com/nba/report-draymond-green-told-kevin-durant-won-without-leave/  Probably mixed in a bit (second sentence) with Jimmy Butler rant (reportedly) that finally got him traded ..
That 1 peice would need to be one of the following though:  1. Lebron James 2. Kevin Durant  3. Steph Curry 4. Prime MJ 5. Jesus Christ
"They have faced Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the past 4 years.  Not many styles are going to overcome that regardless."
"Kevin Johnson  Kevin martin  Kevin Durant  Kevin love  Kevin Garnett  Edit: switch McHale with love if you want , I just like the spacing with love. Also I thought of love first idk why"
I mean when Kevin Durant joins a 73 win team there is only so much you can do.
Kevin Durant  30.9/8.8/5.0 against us on 51.8/.471/.910. Best splits against a team in his career.

"I know it's easy to forget, but the Brooklyn Nets have Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Caris LeVert, Joe Harris, Deandre Jordan, and Jarrett Allen. Miami's stock has gone way up during the playoffs, but most of our best players didn't even report to the bubble. We're the team to beat in the East next year."
"I think LeBron been the best player in the league for awhile.    If Kawhi Leonard wins back to back Finals MVP, I think he can make a strong case for the best player in the league.  Depends on how he looks next season, Kevin Durant is part of ""the conversation""."
"Kyrie has never played for any coaches he respects, in CLE he learned from Lebron who didn't respect any of the coaches he's had including Tyronn Lue, only Lebron is aware of image and doesn't make it obvious, and Brad Stevens and Danny Ainge never found a way to get Kyrie to respect them either, he was a champion going to a team that needed him not the other way around, severely doubt Steve Nash is going to let himself be walked over he's a hall of famer, and Kevin Durant respects him so he's not going to let that happen either  it'll probably play out like how D-Wade kept Lebron in check even though Lebron didn't respect Coach Spo but Wade did"
MUTHAFUCCIN KEVIN DURANT.
Kevin Durant cares
"But honestly.... How many players are by consensus, believed to be able to lead a championship team as the number one option? LeBron, Kawhi, Steph, maybe Kevin Durant? It's insane to expect him to be there."
"I've never heard of LeBron having a better handle than kevin durant, like ever"
"Kevin Durant, dude could probably be point guard if he tried to."
Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant has some great handles
"It was actually addressed in a recent article in the Athletic by Quick (massive novel incoming!)  &gt;First off, if you haven’t read [Slater’s piece on Lillard and Curry, check it out here](https://theathletic.com/2020741/2020/08/25/the-key-difference-between-damian-lillard-and-steph-curry-against-elite-defenses/?article_source=search&amp;search_query=Anthony%20Slater%20and%20Damian%20Lillard).  &gt;There’s some backstory here, and one I explored last summer with Lillard, but never published.  &gt;The background: In the summer of 2018, fresh off the Blazers being swept by New Orleans, Lillard worked out with Team USA in Las Vegas. There, Lillard had a conversation with Team USA assistant Mike Brown, who is also an assistant with the Warriors. Brown and the Warriors swept Lillard and the Blazers in 2017 and dispatched them in five games in 2016.  &gt;Brown urged Lillard to examine how Steph Curry worked off the ball — in particular how Curry relocated after defenses forced the ball out of his hands. Brown suggested that staying active after the blitz, and playing more off the ball could be the next evolution to Lillard’s game.  &gt;That evolution didn’t come in 2019 when the Warriors swept the Blazers in the Western Conference finals, a result that was keyed by Golden State blitzing Lillard and daring the likes of Al-Farouq Aminu and Maurice Harkless to beat them. That tactic was no doubt implemented when Brown and the Warriors staff saw throughout the season that Lillard hadn’t embraced Brown’s advice from the summer of 2018.  &gt;But, like all things, the concept of Lillard playing off the ball is not as simple as it sounds, as Lillard explained to me at his kids camp last July.  &gt;“I remember Mike Brown and I had that conversation, in Vegas, last summer (2018),” Lillard said. “We had that conversation, and I agree with him. But my team is different from his team. You have to have the personnel to do it that way. Because my main responsibility is to win games. Mike Brown is going to be in the playoffs, but I will be at home if I don’t say, ‘All right, we have to do what we have to do.”’  &gt;Lillard’s point is valid: As the franchise player, he needs to assess and determine how to maximize the Blazers’ talents. The Blazers during his tenure have had limited playmakers outside of himself and CJ McCollum. It’s why Neil Olshey in 2016 brought in Evan Turner: He envisioned Turner playing alongside Lillard and McCollum and being able to initiate and execute offense, much like Draymond Green and Kevin Durant were able to do for the Warriors. It never worked out that way, as coach Terry Stotts valued the defense and spacing/shooting of Harkless and Aminu more than the savvy and playmaking of the poor-shooting Turner.  &gt;“At the end of the day, Mike Brown coached Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson … and Draymond Green is a great playmaker,” Lillard said. “The last three years I’ve trained to do stuff off the ball, or moving without the ball, but it’s not that simple. You’ve got four dudes there making the All-Star Game. I would love to play that way, and not have to create and all that — it’s easier on my body. But it’s not that simple.”  &gt;Lillard also noted that Golden State’s system is in part structured around Curry’s mobility, where teammates are trained to look for him relocating after he gives up the ball.  &gt;“Golden State emphasizes when Steph does this, he will keep running, look for him,” Lillard said. “Based on our style of play, it’s not what we do. It’s not preached to us. Sometimes, I would have moments where I would pass it, relocate, and now I run over here and when I get there, somebody is attacking. And sometimes we would score. But how many times am I going to keep sprinting out to here and it’s not turning into a shot? And now I have to sprint down there and chase Steph (on defense)?”  &gt;So, back to the questions posed by James and Julia. As you can see, it’s complicated. To get Lillard off the ball more, it’s a three-pronged equation. The Blazers will need personnel who are smart enough and capable enough to execute with the ball in their hands. Also, Stotts would likely have to tinker the offense to emphasize Lillard relocating after giving up the ball. And lastly, Lillard would have to find a way to restructure his attack, which right now is largely based on pick-and-roll.  &gt;The hardest part, of course, is getting the right personnel. "
"I mean, that and having arguably the greatest shooter of all time...and kevin durant the next 2 times"
I miss Kevin Durant too. He’s 7 ft and shoots over you and then repeats for the entire game.
Just a reminder that Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were 22 and 23 yrs old in 2012...
FROM ALL THE KEVIN DURANT FANS TAKE THAT L TORONTO AND GO BACK HOME.
Good luck next year Craptors! im sure the east will just get easier with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving back.
he asked for Kevin Durant &amp; Jimmy Butler before PG came about.
Lets gooo white Kevin Durant!
I seriously doubt Kevin Durant puts a lot of thought into who *might* block his shot as a help defender. Who are KD's list of best defenders? Probably the 3-4 people *he* scores less on.
Robert Williams looks like Kevin Durant and Ski Mask the Slump God had a child
"How can a team with a recently built state of the art arena, highly respected front office, and an absolutely loaded roster be a budget or poor guys version of ""the NY team?"" What does that even mean - the Knicks?  What about Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving screams ""budget"" to you?"
"yes, fuck kevin durant"
"It's even worse than that when you see finals like 2006 or 2012 when natural great teams are formed but the finals almost look rigged and guys can't touch a guy.  I remember those two finals in particular because they both had the most phantom calls on the teams good shooters.  Dirk Nowitski and Kevin Durant respectively never got in foul trouble the whole season and suddenly in first quarters of finals games their getting hit with fouls and run into foul trouble late in games.  I think there was even a stat that had the Mavericks as 1-10 when a certain ref was in charge of their games.  Refs have way too much control (which of course is already obvious when you have a ref making money off betting based off it and getting caught...the problem itself he acknowledged is still there).  Even Phil Jackson has talked how there is a pecking order to the NBA and small market teams will get punished.    I think super teams are inevitable, especially when you see great natural small market teams suddenly have to play the refs in the finals too.  The NBA itself wants super teams, they just happen to support it when it's Lebron doing it a little more than when other guys are doing it.  It's also crazy that each year Lebron seems to be on the highest paid roster every single year even ok different teams... Like how does that happen?!"
"Kevin durant rubs his head, blows his nose and roots hard for Jamal Murray"
"I honestly take the players opinions with a grain of salt. The reason we need data is because intuition is not reliable. Players also insist that Carmelo is and always has been a great player, but statistically speaking he was not good this year or for the last 5 years at least. It's like when a player scores 50 and then says, ""I didn't know how many points I scored, I was just trying to help the team win."" and I 100% believe that is true. They may have a general sense when someone is a good defender, or when they've scored a lot of points, but they can't objectively say someone is one of the best defenders, because the difference between one defender and the next is increasingly marginal after you get above the 50th percentile, and that's the exact reason for statistics. Margins aren't intuitive. It could well be true that Jrue is the best defender of Kevin Durant, but that doesn't make him the best defender. That being said, of course, I would absolutely love for Jrue to be on the Blazers and he'd be a huge difference-maker and also he's just an amazing dude in general."
"Last season the Nets got Kevin Durant (sign and trade), Kyrie Irving, and DeAndre Jordan in free agency so I think they’re doing pretty well"
"Man that's such a lazy take. Yeah he joiner the best team, but as soon as he did he was literally the best player on that team and carried them to 2 more finals   If u watch the sweep vs the cavs it was the Kevin Durant show, likewise with all.those other series when he, klay and steph were all playing..."
Kevin Durant isn't top 20 until he wins a ring he actually deserves.
"KD missed 1 game in a series where every game was decided by 6 or less points. You really tryna tell me you don't think Kevin Durant is at least a 6 pt swing?   At any rate, I didnt mean they needed him to beat Houston specifically. I meant they needed him to win the chip."
I mean PBev knew that. Did you see him and Lou get interviewed about it? They literally laugh and say “it’s Kevin Durant”. Dude might be (IMO “is”) the most scorer of all time.
Kevin Durant at 80% health is a better player than fully healthy Giannis
Kevin Durant is going to miss more time than Jordan did during his first retirement.
"&gt;People act like KD was carrying Russ or some shit, KD was great but Russ was phenomenal in those Thunder runs as well.  Nah he definitely got carried some.   The biggest series they won before the Pat Bev incident was the 2012 WCF against the Spurs who were favorites to win, having won like 18 straight entering the series.   Durant averaged 30/7/5 on .662 TS%  Westbrook averaged 18/6/7 on .450 TS%  The only reason OKC was able to win that series with Westbrook playing so badly is that Harden played phenomenally (18/6/4 on .641 TS%) only to be dumped like trash a few months later for Kevin Martin and a middling pick."
"this is one of those things where you have to measure ""what actually matters.""  I'm of the belief that anything over 1-2 rings can be plenty sufficient. Esp. if you struggled long and hard/are the sole super star, drafted team, hometown team etc. It's why, in some ways, I'd put Dirks 1 ring above a lot of other people winning multiples.  What matters is that you play your best at every opportunity you are given, enjoy the ride, and don't make winning or losing define you. That is why I hate, hate, HATE the ""Michael Jordan"" winning is everything. It isn't. In fact, if it's in the top 5 most important things in your life, you've probably failed at life. It's why even though Damian Lilliard lost in the playoffs, I respect him 10x more than Kevin Durant or maybe even Jordan.  Family/education/giving back/health/friendships &gt;&gt;&gt; winning a ring to most sane people. The sad thing is, if you asked a lot of the old school crowd, they'd say the same thing and still judge today's players by rings."
"To be fair, dpoy is a regular season award  Also to be fair, who can guard Kevin Durant ever?"
Harden and Westbrook could really use another guy like Kevin Durant at their side
Just wait till the league gets Anthony Durant and Kevin Davis.
I do Kevin Durant is a snake.
So did Kevin Durant.
Do you Kevin Durant
At this rate no but Kevin Durant holds his HOF future in his hands.
"Kevin ""You Know Who I Am"" Durant"
"What separates Harden from Curry is Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green."
"I still don't agree with the fact Kevin Durant, arguably the second greatest player currently in the NBA felt the need to leave a team that was one game away from eliminating the team that he joined, which was arguably the Greatest Team in NBA History. That's not only ring chasing, that's inputting the Konami Code to ensure you never miss a shot. I know my opinion doesn't matter, but Iost all respect for KD when he went to the Warriors."
"""it's so easy to score against this guy""  I mean... but you're Kevin Durant... You score against everyone..."
"Giannis Antetokounmpo has disastrously underperformed for the last two postseasons, even more devastatingly so this year.   Kevin Durant might never get back to MVP levels."
I would argue that fewer attempts doesn't necessarily make a person a worse shooter. For example: is Kevin Durant a worse shooter than Harden? They both shoot similar percentages but Harden has many more attempts.
Kevin Durant hasn’t played against Lu Dort yet.
"His logic relied on believing that 23 year old Kevin Durant dragged OKC to the finals by himself (something he only accomplished once before joining Golden State) and Russ doesn't deserve the credit for also getting there, despite being the 2nd best player on that team. Whether you think Chris Paul is better than Russ is a completely different argument. A single star is not dragging a team to the Finals in the West"

Thanks to Kevin Durant   Give Chris Paul Kevin Durant and he'll make a finals too probably
"Plenty. Kevin Durant left the Thunder, then the Warriors. LeBron left the Cavs, then left the Heat, then left the Cavs again. Kawhi left the Raptors (and took.it ever further by only signing a 2 year deal with an option with the Clippers). Kemba Walker left the Hornets, Kyrie Irving left the Celtics. It happens.  It's a little rarer for someone to turn down the Supermax. Kawhi and Anthony Davis are the only guys I can think of that have turned that down so far. It's an absurd amount of money. For comparison, Kawhi Leonard is making $33 million on his max deal with the Clippers this year, will make $34 million next, and has a $36 million option the year after that. John Wall, meanwhile, is on a supermax and made $38 million this year, will make $41 million next, $44 million the year after that, and finishes it off with a $47 million option\*  \* Values are assuming full length, non-covid seasons."
"Kevin ""I'm not your savior"" Durant"
"Its unbelievable how you guys fall into the media hype.   Bron clamped Kawhi twice already, back in March and in the first game of the NBA Bubble. Remember that guy who wrote a thesis about how LeBron is gonna struggle in the playoffs because he trains the entire year for April but then the shutdown fucked his workout regime or whatever? lol   Kawhi beats the Warriors without Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson and somehow he becomes the best player in the planet.   Clippers couldnt defend Luka who one, basically is LeBron without the athleticism and two, never had NBA Playoffs experience but somehow people are convincing themselves they can stop LeBron. Doc Rivers cares more about offense than defense and his rotations prove it.   And I still haven't mentioned Anthony Davis."
"All these I would average 45 or 50 if I play today is simply a lie. If Kevin Durant can't do it, NO ONE in the history can do it, excluding of course Wilt Chamberlain because you know he had his own world record. It's even harder to average 50 if you are not adept on hitting 3's. Kevin Durant has the best chance of averaging 50 because he is truly a complete weapon offensively and truly unarguable while in his shooting form. He is a master of 3 point shot, master of getting foul, master of driving to the hoop, master of switches, master of mid range. Offensively, there is no weakness in Kevin Durant and he can't average 50 in today's era, not even close and you tell me Paul Pierce and Reggie Miller can??? Fuckkk outtta here."
"Zach Lowe suggested it the other day and I was just laughing away. Even if Zach thinks Kobe wasn't a better scorer, Harden played with Kevin Durant who is better than Harden."
"Nash: “Hey KD, I think we need you in a different spot for this play, OK?”  KD: “Do you know who I am?! I’m Kevin Durant!”"
"Kevin Durant who carried the Sonics to a finals, carried the Sonics to multiple conference finals, was the reason Golden State was heavily favored to win 3 straight championships,  was the reason Golden State beat Lebron 2x.  Is the same guy who deferred to Curry in The Finals and still won The Finals MVP.  Is the single reason the Nets are title contenders.  His 3rd year in the NBA took win-a-chip-this-year-Kobe to 6 games in his debut playoffs.  His second year in the playoffs he reached the Conference Finals, losing to the Mavs who smoked the Heatles.  His first Finals, lost to the Heatles averaging 31 pts/game - Westbrook should have stayed in his fucking lane and deferred to Durant but thats neither here nor there.  And I can go on and on.  Put James Harden on any team other than the Rockets, does that team get better?  Maybe, hard to say, James Harden is a piece and half to fit.    Put KD on any team in the NBA, does that team get better?  A whole bunch of them become title contenders instantly.  A whole bunch of them become deep playoff contenders immediately.  His game scales well with the lionshare of teams.  James had Golden State dead to rights in his backyard, no KD, Curry had 0 pts in an entire half of ball.  And lost in 6.  James has alot to prove still.  The minute KD left Westbrook, he almost won 3 finals mvps, thats why KD is that guy over Harden."
"&gt;Could you imagine a team with Harden, Westbrook and Durant  I[ photoshopped them together](https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/65/4/kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-james-harden-getty-ftr-110316_640lqph5exsk12vhr09kf9iaf.jpg?t=688696832&amp;quality=100). What do you think?"
irrelevant but yall might find interesting. Today at work I heard a dude say that Kawhi Leonard was overrated and I when I turned to see who said it it was a tallish black dude wearing a Kevin Durant jersey lol. then he talked about how Montrez Harrell is one of the best centers in the league because he is a 'dog' and would outplay Embiid regularly.  thats the end of the story.
"Think about the consensus top-10 or so players, and then think about how many of them are 6'5 or slightly taller, like Harden. The list is centers, forwards, and Michael Jordan. Harden isn't Michael Jordan. Kobe gets brought up in top 10 conversations, and Harden isn't Kobe.   Giant players with generational skillsets have an easier time moving up the all-time great lists than smaller players. Plenty of people think that Durant is possibly *the* most talented player of all time--the player you would grow in a lab if your goal was to create the best possible basketball player.   Harden's career is comparable to KD's (if you discount KD's rings because of the team he joined), but if you're building a team of the greatest players of all time in your head, Kevin Durant makes the team and Harden probably doesn't. Fair or unfair, that plays a big role in these rankings."
"We thought Kevin Durant was different, too.  Giannis may be the exception to the rule, but the history of the NBA suggests that elite superstars who don't win titles with small market teams by the time they hit their prime usually leave."
"Coaching opportunities in the NBA is a combination of who you know in the league, your experience either as a coach/player and how good/respected you were at coaching or playing. So Steve Nash is a guy that checks off all those boxes.   He has had a relationship with Nets GM Sean Marks for over 20 years, was a legendary player(2x MVP) who is well respected in the league and you better believe Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving approved of this coaching hire. He has a close/personal relationship with the franchise superstar Durant, being a part of the Warriors organization during Durant’s tenure with GSW.   Is there bias at play? Yes, because the facts says this guy is a good candidate and is favored by the executives and players of the organization. Is it systematic racism? I would say that can be answered with a resounding no. I’d say Stephen A Smith is purposefully conflating personal bias with racial bias."

It can't be that I was just trying to display a real world intuitive example of clutch performance. No! It had to be a hidden agenda where I was fudging the numbers to purposely mask that Russell Westbrook and Kyrie Irving are even less efficient in the clutch than we thought!"
"Yes we saw James Harden, Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker go up against Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nothinbutnets.com/2020/03/23/kevin-durant-defense-brooklyn-nets/amp/ Here you go. Not sure how accurate it is considering it is a fansided article so I may be misinformed. But yeah we both agree Harden has been a really decent defender this year.
"KD is the most unguardable guy in the league, he can just mid range jump shot you to death at an efficient rate, for example, I mean just look at what he was doing in that game 6 to the raptors. Kevin Durant could be a top 10 player by the end of his career but personally I don't think either one will be  but I will say that I am bias because I don't really like hardens style of play, while I find he is a great player and takes a lot of talent to do what he does, the way he plays is not consistent"
"When ? It was a point in time where people were debating whether Kevin Durant was about to pass LeBron as the best player in the league. Today, everyone still basically knows LeBron is the best even if he’s not getting the MVPs. harden is still below"
"Kevin Durant has been considered (arguably) the best player in the NBA at times in his career, plus he has 2 rings and 2 FMVPs.  James Harden does not have that."
"&gt;Kevin Durant averaged 2.3 assists   Thats 3 times what MPJ averages, I agree woth most of what you said tho"
"Kevin Durant averaged 2.3 assists and 3.7 turnovers during his first playoff run.    I'm not saying MPJ is on the same level as young KD but it's not uncommon for young scorers to have low assist-to-turnover numbers in their first playoffs.    Cut the kid some slack, he's pretty much a rookie."
Are you saying Kevin Durant didn’t up and leave the west?
"All it took was Kevin Durant rupturing his achilles, Klay Thompson tearing his ACL, and Stephen Curry breaking his hand."
Wonder why you left out the Warriors best player those years Kevin Durant.
I mean well yeah...   Here’s the all time top 5 career playoff PPG:  1. Michael Jordan 2. Allen Iverson  3. Anthony Davis 4. Jerry West 5. Kevin Durant  Only 2 people in the history of the NBA have scored more per game then Anthony Davis on average in the playoffs lol
MPJ thinks he's Kevin Durant out there lol
Jerami Grant is Kevin Durant again  Nobody else can score though
The Nuggets offense looks really bad when Jerami Grant and Monte Morris aren't cosplaying as Kevin Durant on that end
MPJ is Kevin Durant in his mind and I love it

"Since 1991, only 20 players have made an All NBA team in the same season they won a championship. Jimmy would join that group if he did so. A championship would immortalize him as one of the all time greats to ever play the game. So many players can't win a championship as a prime guy, and doing so would be huge for Jimmy's legacy.   * Kawhi Leonard * Kevin Durant * Stephen Curry * Draymond Green * Lebron James * Klay Thompson * Tony Parker * Dwyane Wade * Dirk Nowitzki * Kobe Bryant * Pau Gasol * Kevin Garnett * Paul Pierce * Tim Duncan * Shaquille O'neal * Ben Wallace * Michael Jordan * Scottie Pippen * Hakeem Olujawon * Clyde Drexler"
"The NBA has a pretty decent players' union, and they brokered a deal that made sure that the wealth was spread around to a lot more players.  If Jordan or LeBron ever got contracts that reflected their ""true"" value, there wouldn't be much left to build a team with. In this structure, ""true superstars"" are sometimes hamstrung by a limit to what they can earn, while the capped money for those guys gets spread around to other players, in sometime intersting ways.   For fans, the downside is that players are sometimes overpaid relative to their status in the league.   Some of this also boils down to timing, and when the player came into the league. There are still some pretty egregious examples though:  Curry at #1 makes sense. Followed by Chris Paul, Westbrook, then John Wall, Durant and Harden followed by LeBron.  I think that there's a reasonable argument for all of these guys, within the context of tenure and timing, being at the top.  Westbrook will probably draw a bunch of people out to shit on him right now, and I'm glad that the Celtic's aren't paying him, but I can at least understand why he's the 3rd highest paid player.  Chris Paul is pretty expensive too, but he also just had (yet another) historic run, and part of the way NBA deals work is that elite players like him, can still get paid even in what might be the twilight of their career. Even though he continues to prove that he's still an elite talent in the league.   Tobias Harris is the 10th highest paid player in the league rn, is there any list out there that would have Tobias as one of the top 30 players in the league?  Jimmy Butler and Kawhi are 11th and 12th. In context, I would consider those to both be bargains, with an edge to Jimmy Buckets, since he doesn't come with a built in load management.  Then some raised eyebrows, but not necessarily crazy with Klay, Kemba, Hayward, Conley, Kyrie, Middleton, and PG13 at 13th-19th.   I know this sub loves to shit on PG13 right now, and I'm a bit on board with that myself, however, of those players above him, how many would you take over him with his salary?   Paul Millsap is the 20th highest paid player. Ummm....  21-30 is pretty interesting discussion wise:   Dame, then Kevin Love, Horford (is this a good time to point out how bad the 6ers shit the bed with this one?,) at 24 is Vucevic, DeMar, CJ, Embiid, Wiggins (yikes), Jokic, and Booker rounding out the top 30.  I am going to go deeper into the list, but I have rambled on enough for one post.   Source: http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries"
Kevin Durant is an elite professional athlete and an all-time great who has been trash-talked and shut up players on every level he’s played on. Hiding behind a burner and responding to people who can’t even hold his jockstrap is level of insecurity that requires a diagnosis
"Yea, which comes with age. When was the last time a team made the finals with their best player as a 22 year old? I’m thinking OKC, and you can’t expect every player to be Kevin Durant."
i dont hate lebron. hes honestly my current third favorite shooting guard after dorian finney smith and kevin durant.  Edit: I meant small forward.
Kevin Durant and Melo have small hands too. Both seemed to have acceptable careers
"Chris Paul, Steve Nash, John Stockton  George Gervin, Tracy McGrady, Ray Allen  Larry Bird, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard   Dirk Nowitzki, Karl Malone, Kevin Garnett   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell"
"Lol this is totally different, let KD have fun on social media. He knows he’s Kevin Durant."

"hard to say     lebron has been kinda off two games now so he's kind of due for a good one, and he has been pretty money in elimination games in general     but he also seems to have a sore ankle and he got a few good shots to his legs last game so he might be sore still and that might make some stuff hard     then you also have AD who will probably be at least sore with his ankle too     the on paper/brain side of me says this is probably the easiest of the remaining games for denver to win, as i think AD and lebron will get over any soreness by the next game and i have a lot of faith in lebron and even green to come alive the brighter the lights get  it's an older, sore lebron but he's still probably the last player you want to see on the other side of the court when your future is on the line unlesss you're like kevin durant or a super team"
"Extra perspective, 2005 for Shaq is 2020 for Kevin Durant wrt years in the league. I doubt anyone would be shocked if KD declined in 2-3 years."
How about Kevin Durant? Seems like a good matchup to take.
KD going to the warriors and Kevin Durant tearing his Achilles
"Bulls, Celtics, Magic, Hawks, all great teams when he played them. They all really fell apart in the mid 2010s, but by that time he had surpassed the dimension known as the Eastern Conference and the only known force that could stop him was the best regular season team in histor-  Oh yeah, he beat them.   The only known force that could stop him was the best regular season team in history plus Kevin Durant."
"AD is somewhat like Kevin Durant. You think he had a bad game, and you look and he's still putting up monster numbers.   Game 3 where they lost... 27/2/1 on 53/0/90 (he missed all of the 3 attempts, but he still put up 63% TS% because he was good from the FT line)...  and +4 while he was on the floor. And then you look at his series stat and he's putting up 32.3/6.5/2.5 on 55/29/89.    And he's averaging 28.9/9.6/3.6 on 58/35/80 for the playoffs with 1.2 blocks and 1.1 steals...  Like, that's as good as you can be. He's averaging more points, more rebounds, and more assists than regular season on better efficiency."
"KD was the best player in the league and I don’t want to get into a KD vs LeBron argument.  You think Kyrie will be the first option on the Nets? Why are you bringing up his time on the Celtics when I only brought him up saying he has always been great in the playoffs as a second option?   I brought up talent as in depth. Yes, Levert and Dinwiddie are good. But they also have Allen, Harris (very likely he stays), Temple and TLC next year. What top 10 NBA has a better 3-8 than that?  What teams do you think will be better than the Nets next year?  KD doesn’t have to prove himself. He’s Kevin Durant. Just remember my comment when he wins MVP ;)"
"It’s gotta be a damn well oiled offense with elite FT shooters who can draw fouls and defend.   I’d say prime CP3, Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan. All these guys have played and won in the olympics so they’re able to put it together  And it was at this point in time I realized I should actually read the OP before commenting"
Name one team who wouldn't get better if you replaced their 2nd best player with Kevin Durant.
"EAST  Bucks: A small market team with a generational talent in Giannis Antetokumpo. Were seen as title contenders this season, but were beaten in the second round of playoffs. Will be interesting to watch how they improve/learn on this post season and Giannis' future.  Raptors: Won the 2019 championship. They have a great coach and good players. Also Kyle Lowrie's ass is phenomenal.  Celtics: Personally, I didn't think they'd be as successful as they would be now because of their drafts and signings being conflicting (Tatum, Brown, Hayward respectively). But time and time again, they always put up a good fight in the playoffs and I think they're a team to watch for the future.  Pacers: Riddled with injuries but they have good players but something's missing before they become a force to be reckoned with.  Heat: Honestly did not think they'd be one win away from the Finals. Huge respect to the culture they have down in Miami. Great rookies led by a great leader with great work ethic. Hope to see more of them next season.  76ers: Took a huge step back from last season. Honestly the only thing that'll stop this team is shooting and injuries. A fantastic big in Joel Embiid and a dangerous point forward in Ben Simmons, Sixers just need a good coach to bring them to the promised land.  Nets: Acquired Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant last season. Both expected to play next season together. Will be interesting as both players are considered ""locker room cancers"" and ""diva"" respectively. Both are coming off injuries so we will see how they fit into their current team.  Magic: Same with the Heat, I always thought they were a bad team yet somehow they manage to be closer to the playoffs than I expected. Don't really follow them too much so can't say too much about them.  Wizards: Star point guard John Wall was out for the season. This leaves their next best player, Bradley Beal to just shoot it. Beal has put up phenomenal numbers throughout the season on a bad team but we'll have to see how he performs once John Wall comes back.  Hornets: Stuck in mediocre hell. A team that has poor signings and underperforming players. Let their star, Kemba Walker, go to the Celtics. Really wanna see them compete in the playoffs. I think once they fix their roster situation they will be a young team to look out for.  Bulls: Cleared house. No shitty coach. New management. Their future can only go up.  Knicks: Actual hell. The meme team. Jokes aside, Knicks have seemingly let go of everything from their past, aside from the owner, and have committed to a full rebuild and focus on their rookies. Next season do not expect many wins, but hopefully a different future, because honestly I can't see how they fall even worse. I've also been saying that since 2014.  Pistons: Going through a rebuild, with star Blake Griffin on their team. Don't know what their future holds.  Hawks: They have a great shooter in Trae Young. Other than that, they need so much more before they're contenders. If you like watching deep 3s on the East, this is it.  Cavaliers: A literal rollercoaster. Drafted one of the best players to play the game, then went to the absolute shitter, best player came back and won a title for the city and have gone back to the shitter."
"Kevin Durant has never been close to LeBron. LeBron was better in both finals, he had similar numbers in 2017 and better numbers in 2018 and LeBron had the ENTIRE warriors defense scheming and game planning solely for LeBron. He got the most defensive attention in the league those post seasons meanwhile KD was getting role player defensive attention because the defense was so sucked out due to the sheer level of shooting and passing his teammates around him had.    On top of that LeBron was getting guarded by Igoudala, Draymond all the best warriors defenders meanwhile old  man Richard Jefferson and guys like that were just trying to guard KD 1 on 1 with a wide open floor    Durant was a marginally better scorer and that’s the only thing he’s ever been better than LeBron at meanwhile LeBron OUTCLASSES him everywhere else"
team Kevin is by far the best out of those but they have to play really big. Imagine trying to defend a Durant/Martin/Love/McHale/Garnett lineup
"I think if there was an excuse it's that the team is poorly constructed for title contention. It's been brought up before but no one on that team has a create for others mentality. They've got 4 guys on the team that can get a bucket but nobody was making it easy for them. They were having to really work for their shots because it was basically just iso after iso. And as a Thuder fan who has seen more than my fair share of that kind of ball there's only so far that can take you (first round) unless you have Kevin Durant. If they could get a solid point guard that knows how to set guys up and distribute they'd be much, much better."
"Don’t be scared. Super teams are never as unbeatable as they look on paper. Look at Lebron in Miami his first year, look at the Clippers this year or from the Chris Paul Era, hell even Golden State didn’t have a perfect run with Kevin Durant (yes he got hurt, but hey that’s life&amp;basketball). The KG, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen Celtics only won one ring. The only super team worth fearing is the Bulls in the 90s. Everyone else has growing pains, egos, modern day media to deal with. Plus, where does Giannis really “fit,” on that heat team? MAYBE he’d be a fit with the Mavericks, but honestly Giannis has to be the centerpiece to a team. I can’t imagine him clogging the lane when Luka is trying to drive and dish. He can’t space the floor enough for most teams. He’d fit better on teams that are built for Lebron. Because he’s gonna need to be surrounded by complete shooters and then he’ll need a closer like a Kyrie for when they can’t force transition buckets...  Then again, what do I know? 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"No Kevin Durant averaged 30ppg when he was 21, none of those dudes will come close to that"
Is it weird if I don't see a Kevin Durant in any of them?
"Yes, because they added Kevin Durant to a 73 win team that was 3  points away from being back to back champions"
"Every player who hits free agency as a superstar has the same concerns. They all have injury issues and would be mid-30s by contract end. Taylor is just not a good basketball mind and he still thinks KAT is the answer. Every year he doesn’t trade him, his value just lowers.   KG is no exception. EVERY player in the league when he came up was like that. From the lowest guys on the totem pole to the superstars.   I really don’t see any proof that today’s stars have shown any significant benefits to it. If anything, it seems that more players break down younger now in comparison to the past. Most of the top superstars now have long injury histories from Kevin Durant to Steph Curry to Kyrie Irving to John Wall to Kristaps Porzingis etc. We’re also seeing players shuttled out of the league faster it seems"
"""After the injury: Bryant played six, 35, and 66 games in the next three seasons before retiring. He averaged 19 points on just 37 percent shooting from the field."" https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/1/27/16940178/nba-achilles-injury-history-kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-future  I will say 22-24 ppg with terrible defense. I am hoping for the best though. The NBA is better with a stellar KD"
"Tristan Thompson was asked about this today by either Cowherd or Gottlieb, just laughed and said Kyrie is probably just trying to butter up Durant and bring them closer, because there's no way Kyrie legitimate believes that not just LeBron but also Kevin Love and JR Smith can't make key shots."
"I'm imagining Kevin Durant having sex, and it's pretty hot"
"Why did Kevin Durant do it? Why did Chris Paul do it? Because sometimes players have relationships with their team and want to help them out, dude. Sometimes a landing spot is chosen that can orchestrate a trade and not every player is a bridge burner.  The Bucks taught Giannis to drive. He doesn’t owe us anything, but he has a hell of a history in Milwaukee."
He's Kevin Durant. I'm sure he will be a little rusty but once he hits his stride he will be the leading scorer on the Nets and a top 3 player again.
"&gt; which Kawhi interpreted as a menu he could pick from lol.  ""I'll take a Kevin Durant with a side of Stephen Curry and could you add a little less salt to the Curry please? Thank you."""
"yes and the evolution of steph curry, draymond green and klay thompson is what changed that, not steve kerr.  adding kevin durant is just icing on the top."
"If Brooklyn can trade for a third bonafide star then he’ll have more freedom to comeback better. If they don’t then he’ll still be amazing top 5 easily. He’s Kevin Durant, you know who he is."
Running away from his only competition. Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant could both
Kevin Durant is legit cursed yo. You think he rep is bad now? Just wait till the nets implode.
LeBron clutch WPA: 2.35  Kevin Durant clutch WPA: 2.10
"Day 1 meeting  ""Ok guys, so in the interest of teambuilding and transparency, you're gonna have to let me know what all your burner accounts are, on what platform and the passwords so we can shut it down if someone finds out""   Day 2 media scrum ""We have decided to trade Kevin Durant to the Minnesota Timberwolves"""
"Every Championship has an asterisk  1999: 50 game season and there being numerous injuries against key players on the teams the Spurs faced  2001: Allen Iverson vs the Los Angeles Lakers who basically swept the first 3 series if memory serves me correct  2004: Karl Malone and Gary Payton were injured  2007: Robert Horry hip checking Steve Nash caused Amare and whoever else to leave the bench and get suspended soon afterwards  2008: Bynum was injured  2010: Perkins was injured  2011: A Monstar stole Lebron's powers  2012: Shortened season  2013: Ray Allen morphed into Jesus Shuttlesworth by making that game saving three  2014: Dwyane Wade's knees withered into ash  2015: Kyrie and Love were out  2016: Basketball Gods cursed the Warriors and Dray got suspended for a game  2017: The 73-9 warriors added Kevin Mother Fucking Durant  2018: Same as above. This fucking team had 4 all stars, a DPOY, 2 MVPs in their prime, a unanimous MVP and a 2 time MVP at that, two of the top 5 shooters of all fucking time in NBA history  2019: Warriors died  2020: Shortened season and now two of the Heat's best players got injured. Possibly three."
"Kevin Durant: 2 FMVPs, Curry 0.  Kyrie Irving: Hit a top 3 greatest shot in NBA history"
He also said the other day LeBron had no excuse in the 2017 finals for not beating a 67 and 73 win team that wins a title and made B2B finals and then added Kevin durant
"""I have always said Kevin Durant is the best player in the league."""
"I'd hate to be a Boston fan right now.  After years of rebuilding, we both basically started in 2013, you had all the advantages in the world, in picks from a stupid trade that went your way compeletely so you could develop youngs by not tanking but still getting a top pick every year, but also getting a trade that you won 100-0 and got an All Star Champion in Kyrie.......we're the ones with the 3 wins away from being Champions.  Oh, and the best part?  The Nets, the team you fleeced, have Kevin Durant and your former star, Kyrie Irving now.  Gotta love it."
"That swings both ways.  Bradley Beal could tear his Achilles next year.  We have no clue what the future holds. But paying a boarderline all-star the Supermax out of your salary cap is not a good.  I don’t care if MPJ never stepped on the floor again, that’s still a worse option.  MPJ ceiling is legitimately a Kevin Durant level scorer.  You don’t clear that for a Bradley Beal when your 2 best players are 25 and 23.  The upside is too valuable, and Bradley Beal doesn’t guarantee you a chip either.  The only time you trade an MPJ is if you’re a team like the clippers. Your best players are 29 and 30.  You have 2 tradable assets are walking in FA, both your stars can leave, and you have to take a gamble on the future with the more sure thing.  You trade someone like that when you need to Win Now.  You trade all your pieces for AD because you need to Win Now.  You trade all your pieces for PG because you need to Win Now.  There’s absolutely nothing about the nuggets that say they’re a must win franchise.  Even if they don’t win a title in the next decade, they’ll be much better off than going for broke, ending up in salary cap hell and picking up dead weight just to clear space."
"Jason McIntyre: “At the exit interviews, and this is just what I’ve heard, Paul George did not get rave reviews from his teammates. My source would not be shocked if Paul George was shipped out of town, and the potential landing spot is the Brooklyn Nets where he would then team with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. In exchange the Clippers would get something along the lines of Caris Levert, Spencer Dinwiddie, and some sort of second round Draft pick to balance out the rest of the deal. I’m sure the Clippers would love to get Jarrett Allen who had to take a backseat to DeAndre Jordan because DeAndre is friends with Kyrie and Kevin Durant.”  https://twitter.com/FoxSportsRadio/status/1311021677912891392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1311021677912891392%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffoxsportsradio.iheart.com%2Fcontent%2F2020-09-30-report-clippers-could-look-to-trade-paul-george-to-the-brooklyn-nets%2F"

"Next year: ""The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets. Russell Westbrook and James Harden were the driving forces in that trade, and Durant always wanted to play with both of them again."""
"Lebron and giannis would play perfectly. You trade the shooting of AD for an equivalent defender with better finishing who's not afraid to bang down in the paint. AD is pretty streaky also. He has a pretty jumpshot which makes it seem like hes an elite three-point shooter, but in reality him and Giannis have similar splits, where giannis is consistently below average/average whereas AD can go from being horrendous a few games to shooting like Klay Thompson. This post-season he has been hot and considerably better than in the regular season, but this is barring crowd noises as well as increased depth perception, which AD has adapted better to than almost everyone but Jamal Murray. So let's not get blinded by that silky smooth jumper and say that he's suddenly a Kevin Durant type shooter. In turn instead of a dynamic duo like Magic and Kareem, you get a kobe/shaq, KD/steph type duo, where you take turns running the offense and dominating. AD can score the hell out of the ball, but he can't run the offense the way lebron or giannis can because of their marginally better playmaking/vision and transition game. So yes, both duos would have their pros and cons, but me personally, i'd be glad to see another shaq/kobe duo over this one."
"in the finals KD got so many uncontested dunks/layups that were generated from the offense as a whole, many of which were created by Curry... or it would better to say that Cleveland defense was focused on Curry to the extreme to leave completely open several times Kevin fucking Durant. OP got a point  &amp;#x200B;  [https://youtu.be/GuP6-puSfRs](https://youtu.be/GuP6-puSfRs)"
"When I say choked, again, I mean compared to his own standards. The way he's known for having a certain gravity on the court is remarkable, and he didn't have much of that during those finals, especially against an opponent that, for most of the series, only had one real offensive weapon (and that, a guy whose scoring isn't even regarded as his best skill).  Watching those games, Curry wasn't the best player on his team. There's a reason they chose someone else to be the finals MVP, instead of gifting it to curry (although nobody deserved it even remotely as much as Lebron did). Sure, he had that 37 point game, but we're talking about the whole series here.  How does Lebron win a game with Curry shooting 5-23 for 19 points, while Klay is trying to bail him out with a decently efficient 34?  He bounced back in game 3 and was the best player on his team, but his numbers dipped again in game 4 and Iguodala was the player with the most impact for the warriors.  Game 5, like we've said, was his best game by far, and the only time he looked like a seriously dominant player in the finals, and he was pretty bad again in Game 6, with 0.42 FG% and 0.273 3pt%, while Iguodala and Draymond had pretty solid games to clinch the series.  We can skip 2016 because, like you said, he was likely injured then.  2017 game 1, Durant is obviously the best player on the Warriors and he's got a chip on his shoulder, trying to prove his haters wrong. He dominates the game and Curry is an afterthought. Much easier to make your stats look amazing when the Defensive focus has to be on the other guy - especially in a 113-91 blowout.  Game 2 - KD is the best player once again, with Curry having a pretty inefficient game (7-17 from the field, 4-11 from 3), but with inflated stats in a 132-113 blowout.  Game 3 - KD once again dominates while Curry gets his numbers on a 42% FG. Despite Lebron and Kyrie having 39 and 38, respectively, they still lose 118-113, because this team is simply ridiculous, and Curry could sleep his way to a championship.  Game 4 - The only cavs win in the series. 137-116 blowout victory for the cavs. The highest scoring game in the whole series. KD with another solid 35 pts, although very inefficient, as was the rest of the team. Curry? 14 miserable points with his team getting his ass wooped, and only attempting 13 shots and making 4 of them.   Game 5 - he finally has a slightly decent game, finishing with 0.500 FG and 34 points, although he sucked from 3PT at 2-9. Once again, Durant is the best player on the team, going for 39 on 14-20 and 5-8 from 3pt.  Fast forward to 2018 and he's already playing alongside the second best player in the league, two MVPs in their prime, the easiest run to the finals (and to a championship) in league history, despite facing a team lead by the best player of this generation.  He has two decent first games where he's not even the main focus on defence anymore because of a guy named Kevin Durant right next to him, a 7ft tall offensive masterpiece, and he still manages to go 3-16 for 11 points in a 110-102 win in game 3. This clutch master, this finals MVP calibre alpha dog. Of course he bounced back in game 4 with 37, but it's a 108-85 blowout. Everyone on the cavs is already checked out and planning how to murder JR.  So yes, Curry is not a clutch player in the biggest moment of all. He played on the best team and won 3 championships because of it. He was never the most dominant player on his team in any of those runs 3 runs."
The Warriors fielded two all-time great teams before Kevin Durant joined. Durant's teams have never won over 60 games and hadn't made the Finals for years before joining Golden State.
"Steph Curry, Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving"
Lol and no one has anything to stop Kevin Durant in the East
"It’s one thing to acknowledge the circumstances surrounding how the championship was one but I’ve never heard anyone say the Warriors first championship has a asterisk on it because Kevin Love/Kyrie got injured. I also am one who believes they benefited from playing a team depleted of 2/3 of their best players but I never considered their championship fraudulent for lack of a better word. They won. They were 2016 champions. I leave it at that. Same thing in 2019, if Kevin Durant is healthy I don’t really believe it’s even a series but he got hurt. With Klay it’s hard to say. Maybe he gets hot they force a game 7 and win another title, but he was there up until 2:22 left in the 3rd of game five and GSW was still down. So you never know but either way Toronto are just champion.  I don’t see they it as they have a asterisk either"
Also why the fuck would you watch AD footage to learn how to shoot when you could watch guys like Kevin Durant or Steph Curry lmao
"It wasn’t orchestrated by the players. KG wanted to stay in Minny, Ainge reached out to McHale. Allen wanted out, Seattle was banking on their new shiny rook called Kevin Durant, Ainge jumped on the opportunity.   Anyway, that’s my last post on the subject."
Did Kevin Durant die?
Kevin Durant
"This is not the greatest scorer of all-time, best player of the decade, two time NBA champion, MVP and largest penis in the NBA, the one and only Kevin Durant, I don’t know what you are talking about."
There were distinct plays in my memory from a fast break with Kevin Fucking Durant and the defender would guard Curry/Klay on a 3 on 2 and let KD just dunk it.
"Cavs were missing Love and Kyrie, GSW were missing Klay and Kevin fucking Durant but apparently Dragic's injury will fully discredit the series.  Warriors won 2015, Raps won 2019, whoever wins this year will be the champ."
"Absolute legend, I really think he is on that Kevin Durant level. Him and LeBron can go really far together."

The warriors killed it with Kevin durant
Lord I miss Kevin Durant
"Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green was a thing before ""microball"" by the way."
It’s valid since they blew a 3-1 lead the following year.  Then they needed Kevin fucking Durant.
Dude they're the Blazers. They passed on Michael Jordan and Kevin Durant. Safe to say they're never winning a finals ever again
"In 2018 they had 48 wins and were the 6th seed.  The 3rd seed had 49 wins.  The 8th seed had 47.  It's called the Western conference.  They beat the 3rd seed, and had to face the Warriors in round two because the Warriors, with Kevin Durant, weren't even the 1 seed.  The Pelicans were a team on the rise.  They got completely derailed by Cousins' injury.  They traded major assets to get Cousins.  When he got hurt and they let him go, there was no way that franchise could recover."
"I know stock is low on Wiggins right now, but I don't expect Myers to trade him. The return in depth they'd get for Wiggins wouldn't be great since he's seen as a negative asset, and imo I'd rather keep him rather than getting 2 contributing bench guys anyway. I'm high on Wiggins and he's been putting in the most work of anyone on the warriors(except maybe klay) over quarantine and the warriors need a guy to put on LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Giannis antetokounmpo if they wanna make a deep playoff run. Wiggins played great defense for the warriors before the shutdown and I expect him to average an efficient 18-20 points next season playing in the warriors motion offense."
Needs to be more intentionally shitty like Fuck Kevin Durant.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBQ2mjkvYY8
"Last year‘s Heat beat the Warriors, WITH KEVIN DURANT."
"I almost feel like anything related to LeBron, Durant, and maybe even Kyrie is like talking about immigration or Roe V. Wade or raising taxes.  They're reliable hits that people will fight through mobs to give their completely original and totally new opinion on. /s   I mean, it's the NBA Finals, Kevin Durant hasn't played basketball in 1.5 years, and I swear I've seen like multiple KD/Kyrie threads on the front page.  So if you're a small market talking head and you need a signal boost, why not @ Kevin Durant and say something something 73 win team/bitch/fake rings/DAE KD BURNER LOL. It absolutely riles the base up. Politicians have been using the same trick for years."

 Literally do not have to be a basketball fan to know this was a bitch move  # Jeopardy Trolls Kevin Durant Before Game 5 of the NBA Finals [https://youtu.be/Po3dYXlE8jw](https://youtu.be/Po3dYXlE8jw)
"It sounds like you're saying if you have a choice between driving, drawing 4 defenders to create a wide open 3 at the point OR taking a contested mid-range shot, you'd choose the latter.   Goes against most conventional BBIQ, but I understand you're saying you'd rather bet on a playmaker against a possible double team, than defer to an wide open high quality look from a role player. As much as I've hated reading your comments, I can empathize with a belief in your playmakers being the better bet sometimes.  All that said, there are players with much higher skillsets for that contested mid-range than LeBron and had it been someone one like Kevin Durant, I could find my way to meeting you here. But not with LeBron. That's not his shot."
Jimmy Butler is not a better player than Kevin Durant please stop this
Kevin Durant
Nobody remembers how good Kevin Durant was in 2012
"at this point, this is kevin durant train of thoughts tbh. Its like hes trying to convince himself that hes not take an easy route to win the rings, but deep down he always know that he did take an easy route."
"If you want to think Butler is a superstar go ahead. Don't get mad at me because I don't think your favorite player is a superstar. I don't need to define superstar. I can tell who is a superstar tho. LeBron James. Kevin Durant. Steph Curry. James Harden. Kawhi Leonard. Giannis A. Those are superstars, not little B+ Jimmy."
That combination is basically a better version of Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant doesn’t have burners you soft ass bitch                                                                     -sincerely your friend Devin Kurant
"Anthony ""Kevin Durant"" Davis has sealed his legacy. Not a hall of famer. Congratulations to LeBron and Rondo on a great series win!"
*Not Kevin Durant has entered the chat*
Counterpoint: Kevin Durant
"Steph has obviously done better than AD has in the playoffs all things considered and it isn't even close.   Steph simply being on the court was giving literally kevin durant wide open lanes to the hoop.  If we were being fair Steph unironically deserves a percentage of all of his teammates points  Giannis is probably the more influential defender. He makes people give the ball up too just with his presence. Giannis allows 42% of shots at the rim compared to AD's 49% for the regular season. He's also by far better on the perimeter and as a help defender. Offensively AD is the better shooter obviously but I think Giannis makes up for it between ball handling, defense, and playmaking. I think this one is debatable though"
"LeBron didn’t join a 73-9 team that beat him a year before in the Western Conference finals, that won a NBA Championship the year before. The Heat got knocked out 4-1 to the Celtics the year before. It doesn’t look as bad in retrospect because they got the model from the Big 3 Celtics. LeBron never went to a team where the players there were arguably better than him. The Heat team had to figure things out and not that Kevin Durant and the Warriors didn’t have some things to overcome themselves but the system he walked into was already in place. The only real similarities in that they both joined other all star players but a better comparison would have been if LeBron joined the Boston Celtics"
"Except when he is asking for Scarlett Johanson's bath water and [doubles down on it](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/08/kevin-durant-scarlett-johansson-bath-water-tweet-team-usa-rio-draymond-taurasi-trash-talk-funny-simmons-podcast)  &gt;	I hope she was aware of it. It is strange now because it made me look crazy, but now it made me look real cool because I would. I actually love Scarlett Johansson, and I would do that  No way he is insecure! /s"

Kevin Durant open shot frequency in the Finals - 27%   LeBron that same Finals - 45% Curry - 56%
"I'm watching the History channel in the club and I'm wondering how do these people kno what's goin on on the sun..ain't nobody ever been- Kevin Durant, 2010   im at knots berry farms n my butts 2 big 2 fit in da seats on ride. ahhhhhh (dats me yellin)- Shaquille O’Neal, 2009  Twitter is better than goin to da club-Kevin Durant, 2010  @rudygay22 your gay- Kyle Lowry, 2009  @ericachristina4 I do gotta big booty lol- Dwight Howard"
"&gt;Not knocking him at all. Just providing context for the stat that was brought up in response to “Cavs focused primarily on Steph leaving KD either open or with relatively easy one on one coverage”  You really believe the Cavs planned on putting George Hill on Kevin fucking Durant? Also, what if George Hill was on Curry? Grading on a curve are you? It's precisely like I said, knocking KD for being tall. That or propping Curry up for being short.  &gt;Pointing out that the Cavs entire defense was focused around slowing down Curry is not a knock on KD. It’s just what happened.  ""It's just what happened"" Is it? Take the 2017 finals: 48% of Curry's looks were considered open compared to only 27% for KD. I'm not so sure about that."
Steph Curry 6x All Star 6x All NBA 1x Scoring Champ 3x Champ 2x MVP (first unanimous MVP) No Finals MVP               Career PPG 23.5 RPG 4.5 AST 6.6   Kevin Durant 10x All Star 9x All NBA 4x Scoring Champ 2x Champ 1x MVP 2x Finals MVP  Career PPG 27.0 RPG 7.1 AST 4.1  I think if Curry wasn't so injured early on their stats would be alot closer but I think KD has way better defense plus with his ridiculous offense I'd go with KD. Just based on resume tho still KD but steph is close cause of his unanimous MVP but needs a finals MVP for me to put him above KD
Calling Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant but Steph isn’t far behind
Kevin Durant
"He might have signed to a 73-9 team and will never live it down, but Kevin Durant still went out there that last time KNOWING his shit was gonna explode on the court and played till it did. That’s gonna count for something, even if it’s a macho sort of mentality."
Did the same thing with Kevin Durant last year. He obviously was going to miss the series but they were milking the status for clicks and views which was quite sad.
We must have watched a season then Lol. Kevin Durant was definitely better than Giannis and Kawhi.
NBA bus rider: Kevin Durant

LeBron James - Kawhi Leonard - Kevin Durant - Steph Curry - Giannis Antetokounmpo - Anothny David - James Harden - Damian Lillard - Nikola Jokic
"If they can get Kevin Durant to sign there, they can get anybody."
"1- Kevin Durant isn't just any ""pro"". He's a top 3 SF in the history of the game.  2- I have heard Chuck and Shaq speak. Yes it can be irritating at times but Inside the NBA isn't an analytical show. Matter of fact, most NBA shows don't actually provide thorough analysis and just stick to entertaining the fans for some reason.  3- Magic was a horrible GM without question. However, that has absolutely nothing to do with the general understanding of the game... You know who else was a garbage GM and possibly worse as an owner? Michale Jordan. Are you gonna say he doesn't understand the game?   If you're well versed in soccer, let me throw you examples of all time greats that failed as managers: Theirry Henry and Diego Maradona just to name a couple. Many people theories that all time great players have a hard time managing/ guiding less talented and more mediocre players because they'd assume that these pros can do what they are capable of doing."
"Kris Dunn initials are KD, but KD is Kevin Durant. Isiah wasn’t called IT his whole career. IT is a specific nickname that refers to a specific player, and Zeke refers to a different one. It’s semantics, sure. but there’s a reason we make a distinction"
Kevin Durant is Clyde Drexler
"That’s why they said the 73-9 plus KD. As in not just the 73-9 team, but that team with the addition of Kevin Durant is what it took to beat lbj"
It sure is a lot easier if you're already a finals team and add Kevin Durant pretty much for free because of an outlier cap spike
"Hot take: Kevin Durant  Unless the warriors retire it, I could see OKC never doing it after the things he said when he left"
"Centers historically  Shaq, Hakeem, David Robinson, Ewing, Today Jokic, Embiid   Typically 6'10"" to 7 feet. The biggest humans in the world.  PF Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Mchale   now some of these players such as Kevin Garnett and Kevin McHale are tall enough to play center but typically lack the strength to hold up against the very biggest.   SF  SCOTTIE PIPPEN KEVIN DURANT LARRY BIRD LEBRON JAMES.   Typically six foot six to six foot eight probably the most well-rounded of all basketball players these guys can shoot dribble past defend and do everything on the court a total Queen of a chess piece on the court   SGs   Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant Jerry West Dwyane Wade Mitch Richmond James harden  Typically 6 ft 4 to 6 ft 6 typically better shooters and ball handlers.    Point guards magic Johnson John Stockton Chris Paul Isaiah Thomas,    Typically about 6 ft to 6 ft 3 with rare exceptions like 6 ft 8 magic Johnson.  these guys are typically absolute wizards with the ball ball on a string type of ball handling ability and are supposed to be the floor generals best passer on the court."
Lebron's peak is really from 2009 to 2018. To say Jordan had a better peak you'd essentially be saying scoring is the only metric you're going by. We also can't use the rings argument because Lebron unexpectedly ran into a fucking juggernaut with the Warriors and when he arguably figured out how to beat them they went and got Kevin Durant and became unstoppable. I do believe this final says a lot about his legacy. If he blows this 3-1 lead to Miami forget the GOAT talk. If he wins this 4th ring to go along with all of his accomplishments then I'm sorry it goes from ridiculous to preference at this point.   Someone posted a stat that said if you add Lebron's playoff games together he's actually played 2 extra seasons. Think about that for a second. He's actually had 19 seasons worth of mileage put on his body and he still is going out there and performing like this. It's something we'll never see again in our lifetimes. I'm confident in this.
"[Here's an article about it](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2018/6/12/17454050/kevin-durant-warriors-parade-contract-bob-myers).  Basically he was joking about giving Durant a crappy contract, and when someone asked why they gave Steph ""everything he wanted"" he replied ""That was different, he's been here since the way before days.. he's earned it.""  I mean these were all probably jokes, but we all know Durant is sensitive and took it personally."
"Not sure if there is a joke I missed in here or not? If I did, I do apologize.  But like, Kevin Durant is good. But did anyone really think KD was going to come in and daddy dick the Warriors operation behind a championship, a 2x MVP (and probably the best shooter, ever), potential HOF coach, and multiple All-Star caliber players behind Klay and Draymond."
Because teams thought it was a better idea to guard Kevin Durant than Andre Roberson or Westbrook on the perimeter?
"Depends on what Kind of Defender.  For Bigs Defender - Bill Russel or Hakeem (Depends on era)  For Wings Defender - Tony Allen and Pippen  For Guards Defender - MJ  I am surprised no one talks about tony allen.   Kobe Bryant said Tony Allen is the toughest defender for him.  Kevin Durant said Tony Allen is the Best defender that defended him.   Well, maybe because Tony Allen is not famous."
"Next year:    Woj: ""The Brooklyn Nets have agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets. Harden and Westbrook were the driving forces and pushed a trade. All of them wanted to finish their career together, but there wasn't an opportunity yet to play on the same team."""
So many Kevin Durant haters man can’t wait till Ky and KD shut all of them up
Kevin Durant is too monotone for these hosting gigs.
"Attorney Lieutenant Coronel Corporal General of the Garrison Tank Division Ryan "" The Next Kevin Durant according to my Laker fan friend"" Kelly"
It’s a shade. Check out kyrie’s interview.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/10/02/kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-steve-nash/
"Love the list tbh, your top 10 is kinda like mine with the exception I have a few ranked differently. But going off this list, I’m kinda surprised Kevin Durant isn’t on here"
"I think it's safe to consider the early 2000s West as a ""Super Conference."" If ever there was one.  KG not having much success in the playoffs back then is pretty reasonable when you consider how fucking super stacked the west was.    You could drop the Kevin Durant warriors into those playoffs back then and I'd only give them a 45% chance of making it to the finals."
"1.Luka 2. Giannis 3. Jokic 4. Kawhi 5. Curry 6. Dame 7. Butler 8. Chris Paul (yes, even if he is old) 9. Kevin Durant (if healthy) 10. Hot take: Murray and Mitchell  Ps: No order"
"Yes I do. It’s easier for highly skilled tall players to dominate, because they are tall. E.g. Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, and fuck it LeBron almost as tall as them too"
"that 2018 cavs team was terrible. one of the worst defenses in the league that completely relied on lebron to do everything. against the 73-9 warriors + kevin durant.  if you for a second thought one of the best scorers to ever touch a basketball would struggle being guarded by a starting lineup of kevin love, JR smith, tristain thompson, and george hill, when his best teammate is steph curry then idk what to tell you."
Javale McGee is basically Kevin Durant if he got touches as well
"Yeah there is. His name is Kevin Durant. It’s not nearly as sure a thing but if Curry and Klay can do it, Kevin and Klay could do it. Durant is better than Steph, and does most of the best things Steph does just a little worse. It’s not as if they’d take a huge hit in 3pts with Kevin if he was jacking up that many.   It’s all hypothetical so there is no teal way to prove it one way or the other, so really it’s pointless to debate."
Had that one take about Lebron should be traded last year to make cap space for Kevin Durant or Kawhi lol
"Mikan revolutionized the game.  He mastered the post hook and fadeaway before anybody.  He had nice floaters and a good jab step to a mid range shot.  This dude's game was way ahead of it's time.  That's all we can really judge about Mikan. It's not fair to switch the skinny white guys he played against with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and say he'd do worse.  Of course he'd do worse.  But for his era, he was one of a kind."
"See a lot of interesting teams. I'd buy the Pheonix suns for their Medical staff, and get this roster:  Kevin Durant:		39 Klay Thompson:		23 Buddy Hield:		13 John Wall:			10 Seth Curry:		8 PJ Tucker:			8 Keldon Johnson: 	6 Nerlens Noel:		4 Ben McLemore:		3 Dwight Howard:		3 Elfrid Payton:		2 Hamidou Diallo:		1   **Starting Lineup:**  John Wall / Buddy Hield / Klay Thompson / Kevin Durant / Dwight Howard  **Bench:**  Seth Curry / Ben McLemore / Keldon Johnson / PJ Tucker / Nerlens Noel  Elfrid Payton / Hamidou Diallo  This is obviously taking a bet on whether Wall, Klay and KD can return to at least 80% form. If they could stay healthy for even a season, this would be an incredibly fun team to watch"
"This dudes comments:  ""Lebron is not going to admit to getting worse. He's the last person you should trust.""  ""Im sure AD's ankle injury was disclosed. He was crying about it on the court all series.""  ""I'm under 30 and I think Jordan is better than Lebron and it isn't even remotely close.""  ""Kevin Durant didn't win a championship though. He won a *championship*\*.""  ""I believe that Tim Duncan, Chris Bosh, and Magic Johnson are closeted homosexuals.""  bro you are pathetic.. but my question is, am i the first person to tell you this? i really hope not.."
"He shared that goal with the owner. And I'm glad we gave it a shot because he's right that's it's unsportsmanlike, and the Sixers haven't exactly impressed the way they were supposed to. It's not how you build a winning culture usually, and we've just seen the Miami Heat display this.   Even the Blake trade - sure he got injured, and cynics said it was just to sell tickets (possibly part of it), but he legitimately had his best season with us because SVG saw the potential in him as a point forward kind of player who increased his 3P shooting tremendously - surpassing Kevin Durant that season in 3P%.   We made it to the playoffs man, that's not nothing. And I just mentioned the injuries - 3 of our starting PG's had career altering injuries, Jodie Meeks fucked his back up after we signed him, etc... But you don't watch the team so your only criticism is of SVG.   And besides, you're also criticizing him **being the GM** as well as the coach. I don't know if the Clippers are giving him that power. But even as a GM, SVG made some nice moves. He got Tobias Harris for Ersan İlyasova and Brandon Jennings. Look at the contract Harris has now with the Sixers... And he signed Aron Baynes, Boban, drafted Spencer Dinwiddie with pick 38, and I could go on.  People also criticized him for not adopting a 'modern' NBA roster. But the Lakers won doing exactly that - zigging when all the other teams were zagging."
"You’re original point is that Kevin Durant had no help right? Or his teammates underperformed? My point is that’s not always an excuse when it comes to LeBron is all. Right now the sub is full of LeBron fans because he just won a chip, there is nothing to hate on. Backtrack to the beginning of this season and it simply wasn’t always like that, this is my point."
"Lol saying KD crying is just me jokingly saying Kevin Durant lost. Also, me saying OKC is favored is just showing they weren’t the underdogs."
"The garden argument doesn’t necessarily work here...Harden went from being the 6th man with Russ and KD, to the main player on the rockets. Kevin Durant sure, doesn’t apply to James"
Kevin Durant delivers! He's done it again!  He was Lebron's greatest challenger. We'll see how he comes back from major injury.
"This iteration of the Warriors isn't the same team from 2014-2016. Your core is all much older now coming off of major injuries, the bench isn't filled with veterans and good role players like they had back then, and your 3rd legitimate star isn't Kevin Durant anymore it's Wiggins who is prone to a lack of effort and drive. If he buys in and elevates his game, this team can be dangerous especially because Curry and Klay didn't forget how to shoot, but I don't think they're anywhere near as scary as they used to be unless they pick up some decent vets this offseason and Curry plays like his 2016 MVP form."
"\&gt; They won the championship the year before...are you referring to Rick Mahorn? Lol. 3 finals appearances in 3 years, coming off a repeat. But they sure couldn’t be the team that...literally just won...without Rick Mahorn...who they just won without. Mahorn was replaced by Rodman at the 4, who they previously were playing at the 3. They were most certainly better off with Rodman at the 4 than Mahorn.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm referring to Zeke playing 48 games that season and \*clearly\* being past his prime. I'm referring to Laimbeer averaging 11.0 PPG and being average. Old. Aged. Had the wear and tear of multiple deep playoff runs against guys like peak bird on them before they got old. That team. 48 Game Zeke and 11.0 PPG Laimbeer. But go on sis.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; He didn’t play Bird very often in the playoffs. Not much you can do about that. And you’re calling the Pistons not peak when their best players were all in their primes coming off of two championship wins and 3 appearances but you’re saying the Prime-Duncan Spurs? Duncan was on the wrong side of a back injury that robbed him of his athleticism in 2007  My reply above establishes that the Pistons were not coming off their primes.  Tim Duncan was first team All-NBA and first team Defense the season he played a 21 year old LeBron in the finals. He averaged 20 on 14 shots and 54% from the field. (This is probably where you stop answering) Tony Parker was an All-star that season, Pop was already a COTY, Manu won 6th man of the year the following season, and that team had plenty of depth. These are facts.  This is my issue with Jordan fans. Your love for him overshadows what actually happened. What actually happened is that Zeke played 48 games and Laimbeer averaged 11 for the season when the Bulls won their title. What actually happened is a 21 year old LBJ faced prime Tim Duncan and friends coached by arguably the 2nd greatest basketball coach ever.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; You’re talking about KD Warriors who smoked him,  A Warriors team who smokes anyone it plays in the history of the NBA. There's no answer for KD, Steph and Klay on the same court at the same time. Pippen couldn't guard KD because KD would just shoot over him and Jordan couldn't primarily guard Steph because of Klay's catch and shoot ability. That's the greatest team ever. 4 Future HOF, a Future HOF coach. So what?  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; 73-9 Warriors  A 73-9 Team with a two-time unanimous MVP who happens to be the best shooter ever, the best catch and shoot guy next to him, a DPOY and countless role players that was up 3-1. LeBron beat that team on their own court in a game 7 and averaged close to a Triple Double lmao. The best half-court offense in the history of basketball was up 3-1, with 2 games on their court and lost to LeBron.  \&gt;  He beat the Stockton-Malone Jazz twice and broke my heart. He beat the Payton-Kemp Sonics. He beat the showtime Lakers, he beat the prime Drexler Blazers and the MVP Barkley Suns.  He beat the old Lakers. Showtime hadn't been ""Showtime"" since they won a title 3 years prior. The 1991 Lakers had one All-NBA player.   The 1991 Lakers were also coached by 1st time head coach, Mike Dunleavy. No. Jordan never beat showtime. He beat an old Lakers team, with a rookie coach and got cooked by Magic, so Phil put Pippen on him. This is what actually happened. Again. Revisionist history.  and  none of those teams are better than the KD warriors, 73-9 Warriors, or 07 Spurs. (Barring Magic)Tim Duncan is a better player than everyone you just listed, so is Steph Curry and Kevin Durant. LeBron also beat a team with KD, Harden and Russ on it. 3 MVPs.  \&gt; He denied championships to some of the greatest players to ever do it, the above listed as well as Patrick Ewing, Dominique Wilkins, and Hakeem/DRob only got championships when he wasn’t playing.  Jordan said in his own documentary he was worn out. The idea that he goes to and wins five straight is a stretch. The Bulls also would've had zero answer for Hakeem. Zero.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; You’re arguing...what? That because LeBron played the Warriors and Spurs and got his ass kicked that this diminishes MJ? Because MJ never lost in the finals and LeBron did that that makes LeBron better? You can definitely make the argument that LeBron had better finals opponents...but he has lost 6 times. That’s not a mark against LeBron at all, it’s an amazing accomplishment to make 10 finals, but you pretending that it’s a mark against MJ....well that’s a stupid argument  &amp;#x200B;  What's the difference between losing in the finals and losing in the first round or conference finals? Because I wrestled and played sports my whole life. The further you go the better. LBJ was in impossible finals situations in most of his finals when you consider injuries and teams. So if we don't hold it against Jordan for losing to the 85 Celtics in the first round and getting swept, How do we hold it against LeBron for losing to 2007 Spurs or KD warriors, or Warriors when Kyrie, and Kevin Love were out? That questions not facetious"
&gt;Name any other free agent in the last 40 years who did this  Kawhi Leonard   Kevin Durant  Shaq to the Lakers  Need more?
Why wouldn't we want 2 top 5 players on our team lmfao. Argue about fit all you want but at the end of the day we're talking about JAMES HARDEN and KEVIN DURANT
"I’d be more worried about their depth and injury prone stars. Kyrie is made of glass, Kevin Durant wasn’t an Ironman before his injury and he won’t be after. Harden is extremely durable though. The buyout market could help them out a lot towards the end of the season, that’s if they get their before their locker room implodes though."
"I just LOVE it when some stiff on Reddit decides that people who get paid to make these judgments and have their writing published on widely-viewed websites lack the credibility they obviously believe THEY have. LOL. ""A Legend in His Own mind,"" I guess.  OK, here's one from Bleacher Report. No Zion, and CP3 makes the top 20, but no Booker (he ranks 27 on this Top 100 List). Suns still not there.  (and again, this one omitted several good players:  Marvin Bagley III (only 334 minutes) DeMarcus Cousins (out for season) Stephen Curry (only 139 minutes) Kevin Durant (out for season) Blake Griffin (seriously hampered by his left knee) Luke Kennard (too few appearances) Victor Oladipo (only 337 minutes) Klay Thompson (out for season) John Wall (out for season))  Here's their Top 20 in reverse order:  20. Kyle Lowry, Toronto Raptors  19. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets  18. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz  17. Pascal Siakam, Toronto Raptors  16. Paul George, Los Angeles Clippers  15. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers  14. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves  13. Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder  12. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers    11. Jayson Tatum, Boston Celtics  10. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee Bucks  9. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat  8. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers  7. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers  6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets  5. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks  4. James Harden, Houston Rockets  3. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers  2. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers  1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks"
Kevin mf Durant
"Yeah it's difficult. I mean, those teams over the last 10 years included Kobe Bryant, Dirk, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Lebron James, and Dwayne Wade. So if you're looking for something they are doing right, it's ""get 1 or probably 2 top 30 players all time."" Those are always the most important indicators for winning championships. Even the Spurs model needed Duncan. I think once you have one or two of those players, the idea is to win now and throw all of your assets at other stuff to make them happy and win now. If you don't have one of those players, you still need to be careful as winning a title may not even be a possibility. So I'd say if you have one of these players, then you go all in and cry about it later if it doesn't work out. They also are more likely to be smart teams that trade their picks for actual value. The danger isn't from teams with a top 30 all time player who are smart. It's from teams that trade their late picks, don't have that player, and don't have a solid history of good deals. The Lakers are fine. The Bucks are still uncertain. Boston is still too young to go all in on Tatum in that way."
"Compete for what is the real question.   Theyve already traded Covington, actions speak louder than words with regards to their goal and direction.    Kevin Durant is 32 and coming off an achilles. Westbrook is 32 and not trending hte right direction. You can go 50-32 or something with them but it's not competing at a super high level and there's also like a 2-3 yr window before that starts falling apart.   If your goal is to just not suck and field a competitive product you can do that by trading for younger talent. Ben Simmons, Matisse Thybulle, and future picks as one ex.....your not going anywhere with that soon but you also wont be 24-58. You can go like 40-42 have a competent product if that's your goal in 2021 and build from there.  The goal ultimately if you dont want to bottom out should be to acquire young talent and/or with meaningful upside still. Harden is a good enough asset you can get players who accomplish this while also preventing you from completely sucking."
"I mean the result is the same I agree, but it's not the same thing. The Nets did not sign Free Agent Kevin Durant.      Just like how the Lakers didn't draft Kobe. The result is the same exact thing.      If you look up Durant's current contract, it reads :      &gt;Kevin Durant signed a 4 year / $164,255,700 contract with the Golden State Warriors, including $159,955,700 guaranteed, and an annual average salary of $41,063,925. In 2020-1, Durant will earn a base salary of $39,058,950 and a incentive bonus of $1,050,000, while carrying a cap hit of $40,108,950 and a dead cap value of $39,058,950."
Kevin Durant
IMHO... being a first option at some point in your career matters quite a bit so here is my all-time 12 man best shooting team ever!  Best shooter ever: Steph Curry  2-Ray Allen  3-Reggie Miller 4-Larry Bird 5-Dirk Nowitzki 6- Steve Nash  Otherwise you’re just shooting open jumpers or jumpers in rhythm which helps your % a lot...   7-Klay Thompson 8-Kyle Korver 9-Dale Ellis 10-Chris Mullen  11-Peja Stojakovic 12-Mark Price  IR-Kevin Durant ;)
"Oh shit, Monty should have just had Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Maybe next time!"
Kevin Durant improve as a player
"Props to taking the time to this and putting yourself out there. I've made plenty of my own lists and it's way easier to look at them and criticize than actually take the time to do it.  With that said, I think you're away off base here. Jamal Murray is solid you can't take the bubble games too seriously. He's closer to 50 than 20 and has no business ahead of Embiid, Mitchell, and others not even in your top 20 (like George and Adebayo). I have no idea what you're doing with Curry at 14, he still should be in everyone's top 5.   Butler, Booker, Murray, there's way to much recency bias here. However, I will throw out my top 20 so feel free to pick mine apart too, it only seems fair.  1) LeBron James  2) Giannis Antetokounmpo  3) Kevin Durant  4) Kawhi Leonard  5) Steph Curry  6) James Harden  7) Anthony Davis  8) Luka Doncic  9) Damian Lillard  10) Nikola Jokic  11) Joel Embiid  12) Jimmy Butler  13) Paul George  14) Jayson Tatum  15) Bradley Beal   16) Karl Anthony-Towns  17) Donovan Mitchell  18) Bam Adebayo  19) Russell Westbrook  20) Kyrie Irving  21) Rudy Gobert  22) Trae Young  23) Ben Simmons  24) Klay Thompson  25) Devin Booker  26) Pascal Siakam  27) Chris Paul  28) Brandon Ingram  29) Khris Middleton  30) Kyle Lowry  12-20 are very interchangeable and 21-30 are as well, you can also throw Jrue, Kemba, Ja, and Zion for top 30 consideration as well."
"They were the sixth best team in the east last season, and the seventh will add Kevin Durant."
"Eh, would a ring in BKN even help his legacy? I don't feel like it would move him up the all time rankings much.  For BKN to be a title contender, it means Kevin Durant is still Kevin Durant right? so he'd be the bets player on the team.   For ""legacy sake,"" it would look like ""Harden sucked in the playoffs and had to ride champions Durant and Irving to the Finals""  not saying it is fair, but that would be the narrative no?  It would be a hell of a lot different if he went to say, Philly"
"It’s really a toss up between Steve Nash, Larry Bird, Ray Allen &amp; Reggie Miller. Kevin Durant gets slept on for being a great shooter, but he should be talked about here as well (although I think he’s a slight tier below the aforementioned group). Honourable mentions to Mark Price &amp; Dirk.  Edit: Klay should be in the same tier as KD, but not in the top 2 ever conversation yet."
"How is it ""ring chasing"" ?  He's been with the Rockets for 8 years.  He saw   * Durant get a couple or rings after switching teams * Kawhi get 1 after switching  * Lebron move to the Cavs with Love and Kyrie, get 1, move to the Lakers and get another 1 * Kevin Love move on from the Wolves after 6 years and win 1 * AD move after 7 years and immediately win 1 * Paul George switch teams and hahahah, just fuckin with you  You can probably include Jimmy Butler moving to Miami after going through 3 different teams with shitty FOs, and immediately making the finals.   You don't need to be a rocket (heh) scientist to see that in order to win you need a competent FO (or Lebron).  If Harden wants to have any realistic chance to win a title, he needs to go to another team."
"This is my time to shine!  **Hawks**  Trae Young  **Celtics**  Kyrie Irving  Isaiah Thomas Home  Isaiah Thomas Alternate  Marcus Smart   Al Horford  Jayson Tatum  Custom Celtics Jersey  Rajon Rondo  Kemba Walker  **Sixers**  Joel Embiid (#21 ""The Process"")  **Knicks**  Carmelo Anthony  **Orlando Magic**  Mo Bamba  **Indiana Pacers**  Paul George  **Bucks**  Giannis Antetokounmpo   **Golden State Warriors**  Stephen Curry  **Houston Rockets**  James Harden  Clint Capela  **Memphis Grizzlies**  Jaren Jackson Jr (Vintage)  **Dallas Mavericks**  Luka Doncic  **San Antonio Spurs**  Kawhi Leonard  **Phoenix Suns**  Devin Booker  **Oklahoma City Thunder**  Kevin Durant  Shai Gilgeous Alexander  **Los Angeles Lakers**  Kobe Bryant  **Los Angeles Clippers**  Kawhi Leonard  **New Orleans Pelicans**  Anthony Davis  Zion Williamson  **Denver Nuggets**  Gary Harris  Nikola Jokic  **Utah Jazz**  Derrick Favors  **Detroit Pistons, Chicago Bulls Dennis Rodman**"
Assuming they didn’t use Kyrie to bait Kevin Durant just to trade him for Harden
Kevin „I can’t play without a super team” Durant
"A guy named Kevin Durant, another guy named Kyrie Irving."
Warriors traded Kevin Durant for DAngelo Russell..... the Warriors are a bunch of idiots HAHA right?
"Best offensive player =/= best or better player.   &gt; ""You're talking about Kevin Durant at 6-foot-11 protecting the rim, and scoring 35 points a game in the Finals, and getting to the line, doing whatever he wants to do,"" Kerr said.  &gt; ""**There's a different level of impact that's actually possible for Steph and for KD**. Steph is my size, he's literally exactly my size. So what he's capable of is all based on his amazing skill.  &gt; ""**In the playoffs especially, when you're having to protect the rim and do so many different things, there has to be a level of physicality that factors in when you're having these kind of conversations about who is the best player in the league**.  &gt; ""**And that's why LeBron is there, that's why Kawhi is there, that's why KD is there. That combination of skill and physical sheer force.**"" - Steve Kerr on Zach Lowe Podcast, 2017  https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/1319111"
"Lets be honest here, Harden definitely should have 2 MVPs as well. Not to mention that Harden has the highest scoring season since MJ. It should also count in his favor that he was able to push the Kevin Durant Warriors to 7 games, and probably would have gone to the finals if not for the refs."
 Kevin Fucking Durant will disappoint you. I promise that.
"Your list is disingenuous, as it only accounts for free agents *that changed teams*. Gordon Hayward wasn't the best free agent in 2017, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant were."
Draymond didn’t go cry in his car to Kevin Durant?
"I'm James Harden, I'm Kyrie Irving, I'm Kevin Durant, those 1 on 1s and some bench scrubs fed up with each other in 30 minutes"
"The last time LeBron won a title, Kevin Durant also became part of a super team the very next season with the express purpose of beating him.  Coincidence?"
To play with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving
Steph Curry  Klay Thompson  Kevin Durant  72 WINS
"I get why some people say KD was the best player in the world when he was with the Warriors. But Honestly I don't think he was even the best player on his own team then.   Never in my entire life watching basketball have I seen a superstar get double-teamed less because of the efficacy of his teammates.   I would have loved to see a KD-LeBron Finals where they were battling with their ""side-kicks"" but the dude basically filled in for Harrison Barnes on a team that already won a championship. Watching KD's 7 foot frame take either wide open jumpers or ""contested"" shots against JR Smith and Rodney Hood was not crazy impressive *for who KD is supposed to be.*  KD is the man. He is a hell of a ball player. And he is undoubtedly one of the best to ever play. But he has never undisputedly, objectively, without a doubt been the best player on his own team and won a ring. I think the problem a lot of people have with KD, myself included, is that you see someone who clearly has the potential to be the best in the world, to even compete for the best of all time, and they back away from that challenge [while also saying that they want to be recognized as the best.](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kevin-durant-im-tired-of-being-second--im-done-with-it/) Say what you want about KD, but I think it's a lot easier to argue he was second or third best in the league during his run with the Warriors than flat out best.   But yeah. Harden in a Mike D System with great shooters in the east? He'll definitely be competing for best but I think most of us agree that's b/w Bron and Giannis, with an edge to Bron for both recency bias as well as results (hence the recency bias)."
**Kevin Durant has entered the chat**
People also not paying attention to how Kevin Durant may probably never be the same after his achilles injury. Players just never fully make it back from a torn achilles. Especially 30+ year olds.
it's Kevin Durant. He's still top 5 level until it's proven he isn't.
"This whole thing is hilarious, either we get a top 3 player in the league for peanuts or we keep our homegrown favorites and see how they do playing next to Kevin fucking Durant and Kyrie, like both situations are pretty great."
Why does Kevin Durant always fuck with the Rockets? First he goes to Golden State and now he takes Harden away.
"All smiles, Kevin Durant trials// Had to blow it on a court, I must have blew a milli'// I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles//  DRAKE"
“Fuck Kevin Durant”
"""working out with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving"" I wonder what that looked like? And who had the ball in their hands."
Kevin Durant?
"&gt; To be fair, none of them were in MVP shape in 2012.   Kevin Durant absolutely was tf?"

"You can’t imagine ANY scenario where having Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden on the same team works out? Like not one?"
"Honestly,  underrated how they've positioned themselves for the future after the Kevin Durant debacle."
"&gt; He wins just as many championships as Kevin Durant did on the warriors.  Lol KD had 3 seasons on the Warriors, Kobe played 20 seasons in LA."
"so they could what, get draft picks that will likely never become as good as kevin durant?"
How? You guys are acting like pairing Prime James Harden with Kyrie and Kevin Fucking Durant is the equivalent of bringing in the corpses of Paul Pierce and KG. That's ridiculous.
He wins just as many championships as Kevin Durant did on the warriors. 2 Championships is not (almost) nothing. It is a very significant accomplishment.
They have this guy named Kevin Durant. I'm sure they don't want to make him mad
"&gt; Haven’t we all watched Harden flame out in enough big playoff series?  Imagine him with a guy named Kevin Durant  &gt; And does anyone think MVP KD, MVP Harden, and MVP Westbrook could have thrived together long-term.  They made the fucking finals and beat a REALLY good Spurs team when that core was 22/23 years old lmao.    You are crazy if you don't think they could have gotten at least one ring together from 2013-2016."
"this is such a fkn stupid way to look at things.  kevin durant was a free agent its literally his job at that point to pick whats best for his career.  but yall fine with AD tanking all his value, sitting out games, not adhering to a contract he signed cause lakers werent good the year before??"
Kevin Durant
"Kevin ""The Servant"" Durant"
"It's not just 8 more years of experience though, is it? It's not like Harden is going to go back to being a 6th man of the year. It's not like Brooklyn is gonna surround them with defensive stalwarts. It's not like two of them aren't incredible injury risks. It's not like Russell Westbrook doesn't want to murder Kevin Durant. It would be a disaster."
Someone called Kevin Durant Slimothy McVeigh when he left OkC and it’s honestly the best/worst nickname I’ve seen since then
"Brooklyn Nets win the 2021 NBA Championship  Kevin Durant Twitter: ""I told you I could win without Steph and Klay!"" #Mambamentality"
"If you tried to make a ""cult favorite NBA player"" in a lab, it would be Alex Caruso exactly.  * Undrafted * Spent time in the G League * White * Balding * Average looking, but surprisingly buff underneath * Athletic * High bball IQ * Hustles * Dunked on Kevin Durant"
